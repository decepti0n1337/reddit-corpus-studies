Dammit dwight, how am i supposed to get my anti-looping lv up
---
---
---
Theoretically Quentin should be his type, but he's been age-lifted by a lot.
---
And that way hooks become tracked only after partially saboed, making sabo builds still viable without voice chat. I like it
---
Where your edges at hoe
---
Who said i defend ruin
---
Making the game slower makes the game easier... that‚Äôs the point. It gives you even more time to get the balling rolling and early hooks without gens getting done.
---
Exactly, I never said it wasn‚Äôt easy, I‚Äôm only saying it takes skill and practice to do it right 
---
Thats riley reid, she does alot of BBC vids. 
---
Huntress is a total daddy. 
---
i too would love to see a movie based of the shape
---
What's up with these thirsty comments? I thought we were all gay
---
Ayyy she doesn't look like Gollum, grats
---
Its not like it makes the game super slow, you can still get gens done fast, just not super fast
---
Rip everyone downvoted me Ahahah 
---
A little confusing at first glance, I know, but here's a quick run-down:
---

---
The game is a 2D co-op platformer/asymmetrical party game.  Up to four can play, with one person controlling the paranormal entity.  As an investigator, you'll search objects in the environment to find ghost-fighting items, as well as a key.  As you're searching, you'll also encounter a breaker box somewhere on the map, used to power the environment. Once you have the key and the power is on, a ghost-capturing trap spawns from the back of your van, and you'll take it to the outlet that spawns randomly on the map, eradicating the ghostly threat.
---
As a ghost (currently invisible in the photo), you'll use your cunning and ghostly abilities to either kill the investigators, or stop them long enough for time to run out.
---
Just a fun little game I've been working on and off on for a couple of months. It's really coming together now, and will likely be released in the next month or so.
---
I have a lot of fun playing doc, but as a new killer you're going to have a harder time with him than others. Same with Plague. If you're interested in farming with doc, you're going to need to level trapper anyway for Unnerving Presence, so I recommend starting with him.
---
oh ok sorry. I thought you meant like the killers that were here from the start original
---
Feng min as survivor- she is bae and her red dress is too good
---
For killer I have many that I can‚Äôt seem to choose a favorite design wise, some for cosmetics and some for gameplay
---
The spirit- love the story and how twisted and creepy she looks in game, as she twitches everywhere chasing you
---
The legion- looks amazing, I like all of the cosmetics
---
Big daddy Myers- pssshh, please... such an OG of slashers and his ability is so fun and can be game changing. His ability to jumpscare like no other also sets him apart design wise
---
The plague- she looks so amazing and her ability is quite interesting compared to many in the game. 
---
Huntress- she is so creepy and awesome with her lullaby and overall being a mask wearing badass 
---
‚ÄúSurvivors rise up‚Äù
---
You don't need Billy to go against those teams. He just feels cheap. You can tell the difference between him and other killers right off the bat when you play him.
---
He does need to be nerfed however I'm not going to deny that Pig does seem quite shit imo. There should be a middle ground.
---
I'd argue that Nurse is in her own level above everyone else, but besides that there's nothing I can strongly disagree with. (Personally I'd put Trapper in C, Doctor in D, and Wraith ahead of Pig, but that's whatever.)
---
My real question is where does the Plague fit into this in your opinion?
---
I say small game shouldn't reveal traps or hex totems. I'm all for dull totems having their auras shown.
---
perhaps you should go to sleep earlier. 
---
Yes, another tier list disrespecting clown. Yet every time I beat SWF with him I get hate mail talking about how good he is
---
It's really bad and people don't seem to care... the team is at a disadvantage if someone dies quickly, it's pretty simple. I have honestly been a little less helpful to teammates who I am aware are farming me (if I even survive that long), it's just not fun. At least they're not getting hatch in games now. Still incredibly unfun for us, though, especially when all you try to do every game is the right thing. 
---
I find that *very* hard to believe. Your replies have hardcore 'survivors are op' killer main written all over them. 
---
It's not a counter to tunneling if you don't even get a chance to use it. Especially when it gets hard countered by Enduring *so much so* that you play with 3 perks the whole match with little reward for even using the perk because it's now so trash. Both of those perks aren't worth running anyway aside from Urban Evasion. Besides, Hangman's is not really a counter to Saboteur if you're sabo saving like you generally should be. Oh and some of the best every game Doctor addons are the ones that reveal the auras of survivors when they tier up so you can't really complain about that when it gets double countered. 
---
I don't know man I clap cheecks as freddy
---
I thought I saw other plagues do it and because I want to infect survivors who help their friends off the hook 
---
Weak? She can throw corrupt plague with no aim involved, spray and pray if you will. The cool down is a joke, she runs at full speed with it charged. That shit goes over barrels better than hatchets. She is not weak. She‚Äôs strong as hell.

I can't imagine what it's like at higher ranks, the new system sent me from rank 12 back to 15 despite how hard I tried to work in games. Before this update I was getting a lot of slugging in higher ranks, now it just seems so much worse. I'll see someone hooked and within a second the icon has changed back, how can anyone think that's a good idea for their team?  
---
You really don't get rewarded playing solo, honestly; I go from only being unhooked in second stage to being unhooked way too fast after the update, what gives. I won't blame people for doing more swf in future if it comes to that. 
---
Chainsaws on console tbh
---
The nurse for sure. So easy to escape the nurse 
---
she keeps em in her pocket
---
I think they had something planned but didn't go through with it. 
---
It's all good
---
Personally, I'd agree.
---
I was just curious since I've seen other people running around shouting "she's OP!" or "she's trash!"
---
Damn was hoping for ace in the hole.
---
Can someone explain?
---
Then they should be happy because they just got shamed for fetish shaming.
---
I wish we could put shirts and pants on any character not just set characters they are relased for.
---
nice all i need is blood warden and i got all killer perks
---
still need pharma and taps perks that shows everything when completing a gen
---
A Nurses Calling waiting list
---
Deranged Pursuit 
---
Honestly, I can puke a whole sem.. ehh vomit filled bathtub at it and still nothing
---
I actually know they are bc he told me in the chat afterwards
---
and how long have they been reworking Freddy for? Freddy is still unfun to play against in lower ranks and gets rekt at higher ranks. Devs can't really do anything with. 
---
Well good luck with that. 
---
Any killer perk nerf is a killer perk. And yes, I will complain about keys. Explain to me how something that turns a 4k into a 2k is fair, because they found a key, found eachother, did the "follow me" then wandered the map for 10 minutes, far away from the generators, then get out for free. Also, by that logic of "its not useful unless in SWF" then that means provethyself is useless without swf, leader is useless without swf, any perk that has you working together that benefits you is pointless because you can't communicate that you have it. PS. "Imagine complaining about Iri heads, which almost no one uses because its an ultra rare." "Imagine complaining about Prayer beads Spirit, which almost no one uses because no one plays Spirit" "Imagine complaining about Red pinky finger which no one uses cause its an ultra rare and no one plays clown" Just because something isn't used much, doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. Unless they're going to alter the way the hatch works, survivors should not be free just to look for it. Wandering around the map doesn't give crows, and it should, when they're doing nothing productive.
---
I don‚Äôt play on PS4, it ran fine for me, now I don‚Äôt even wanna play it‚Äôs giving me headaches. 
---
Even Surveillance post-2.5.0?
---
stbfl is very underrated, and surveillance is great. kind of hyperbolic, don't you think?
---
Correct
---
Would the hatch open even if Ace has been sacrificed/Moried?
---
ex: Ace and 2 others get farmed- can the last guy escape though hatch via Snake Eyes?
---
Yes it does
---
Yes, it is quite bullshit.
---
The demands for survivors are much higher then the demands for killers. hence why survivors get put into lobby in less then 30 seconds and why it can take 7+ minutes for killers
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Yay Freddy is high
---
How do you use Head On? I wait in the locker until the perk activated but when the killer is in front of the locker, I just climb out like regular instead of stunning them. Also, how do you grab a survivor when they‚Äôre jumping into the hatch? I never see the button show. I play on PS4 btw.
---
Let's launch a petition to give Kate a cowbow hat
---
Because I can't list every killer perk nerf off the top of my head. Spies from the shadows is one, getting a nerf now. There are plenty others. In terms of actual killer powers, maybe thats because most of them are generally balanced, and buffing them would make them like Legion, where you can't counter it at all. So they just nerf survivors, because they have something that is ALWAYS going to be strong, and there is nothing that can be done about it, and therein lies their strength. Communication. The sheer difference between SWF and normal lobby is massive. Its something that gives the surviviors strength beyond measure. THAT is why they will nerf survivors so much, due to the possible power they have. If you need more killer nerfs, then we can look back to the old stuff. Is there any killer you think recently needs a nerf themselves? (Other then Legion) Cause I can't think of one. They don't need to nerf killers, they need to nerf addons/perks, which at least in the case of perks, they are doing.
---
Sometimes I think too much about mind games and  anti-looping, then I realize the survivor I'm chasing is a potato :,) 
---
Probably, I'm sorry
---
I have doubts about your tier list when all it takes to change it is  "why is x better then y" :thinking:
---
Idk what your talking about, if a killer can‚Äôt find the last survivor before the third survivor bleeds out then they are legally blind 
---
Yeah but if the killer checks my gen 3 times and looks for me for 10-15s each time, thats good aggro.
---
The Wraith could be cool, since his backstory of coming to America in the pursuit of living a good life being crushed by himself due to his feelings on justice could be a pretty cool storyline to do. 
---
Oh I guess I'm just stupid then lol
---
Puke on their feet. The game treats it like they‚Äôre crouching. Or puke on them before you pick them up
---
That's assuming the survivor is near a wall
---
I mean, he‚Äôs gotta be better than trapper and leatherface at least tho... cmon now
---
Lmao fucking got me 
---
But they should play some what decent . I played 8 games in a row and most are DC or die fast it‚Äôs weird 
---
I'd have thrown my laptop out a window 
---
Are you on PC? 
---
Nice. I strongly recommend STBFL for all m1 killers without insta-downs. it'll really help in chases. 
---
They can easily locker hop and urban evade around.... really not worth wasting the time. Even if the killer finds the last survivor, then they may not find the survivor they slugged again in time. Is it really work a couple thousand more bloodpoints?
---
Yeah clown is low down but I think hes fun plus i like his mori... mm finger foods.
---
Thanks for the chat I enjoyed it.
---
When you asked, it had not changed yet. It has changed over now though. 
---
STBFL might as well be meta for m1 killers. 
---
Oh 
---
Meg‚Äôs game was simple
---
Do something for yourself for once. She failed.
---
Did you see the perks yet or do you still need to know?
---
Leatherface I admit he may be lower than Clown, but Trapper has definite advantages over Clown. Though Clown has advantages over Trapper, so it's opinion at that point IMO.

&gt;There's nothing wrong with survivors completing generators and escaping as fast as they can
---
Gens are part of the objective, but not the only objective (if it was, then only gens would be on the map). There's also: totems, chests, being altruistic, healing, being chased by the killer, etc. etc.
---
I got the achievement by luck with three others in a SWF, I managed to understand what they wanted to do and I thought the fourth player wasn‚Äôt going to make it but they did
---
Finger Foods are the best foods.

He is definitely fun to play for me too.

I am also glad we could have the chat, as I also enjoyed it.

Save the Best for Last, Surveillance, Tenacity, Streetwise
---
Unless theres a game mechanic im not aware of which is possible then nope. Each time you attempt its independent. Just because you missed the last time doesnt increase your chances.  All three times are 16%.

&gt;Nurse's ability to be relentless in a Chase
---
honestly i wish people would talk about this more. If a Nurse is bad, she'll likely never catch you but she'll never lose you either and it's quite annoying.
---
Surveillance is def a pick-up here.  The rework made it go from NEVER being useful to being practically always useful so long as you kick and observe the Gens.
---
Everything else is very meh.  Streetwise?  Never felt compelled to use it... Tenacity... I guess a fun/meme'ish Perk but just get Unbreakable over this. Save the Best for Last..again,could be fun with Iron Grasp &amp; Mad Grit for some meme build
---
I have dreams about chasing or being chased in the game reguarly
---
Gonna be honest with you, I didn't even notice the difference. I thought the one in the game was the og Freddy
---
Thank you
---
Amanda with the clap at the end was just hilarious
---
I see what you did there on the second category. 
---
Why didn‚Äôt you guys heal for point efficiency?
---
Discordance and Surveillance together are redundant. Surveillance is the superior perk, as it doesn‚Äôt require two survivors on the generator. I‚Äôve had success with Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, BBQ&amp;Chili, and Surveillance. Since she doesn‚Äôt need chasing perks, she can run generator stopping perks. PGTW is great because you can hit a gen and puke on it, regressing it by more than 30% altogether. The 3 remaining perks are just good on every killer, with surveillance being notable on her because it tells you when to go back and puke on a generator again. Also, never uses nurses calling on her. You always want to be breaking survivors with vomit, and they only heal at fountains, which don‚Äôt show auras. It‚Äôs a pretty useless perk on her.
---
It would be cool to just see your own though l, maybe not everyone else‚Äôs. 
---
No on Xbox . I was red ranks until reset and I am now 13 ! This new pip system on top of bad players is ridiculous 
---
Isnt the current aim assist the main reason why is it so easy to 360 a killer in console?
---
I feel like instead of bringing a better aim assist, they should just remove it.
---
And while we are at it, remove it on PC too PLEASE
---
Sorry, I was saying the same thing. Guess I didn‚Äôt come off clearly. 
---
I meant to say that nobody is going to get banned for being reported once, for pretty much anything. Unless maybe hacking with irrefutable video proof. But that if they dc enough, it will ( theoretically) catch up with them. That said, I have still never heard of anyone getting a ban, temp or permanent, from DCing too much. 
---
Nope. That‚Äôs the risk of running a build like that.
---
In which the part 2 of my comment comes into action. Just wait a bit before pickup, and then rush forward/look around you. You'll be easily able to spot anyone rushing in to make a save, at which point you either:
---
A) Turn away from them and make it impossible for them to get into position to get the right angle/timing.
---
B) Slug the downed survivor and go chase the flashlight guy, which generates a lot of pressure.
---
Tunneling the flashlight guy is also a waste of potential pressure, as you know they will be the last ones to get on the generators as they'll be too busy running after you trying to make a save. If anything, I'd save those guys for last.
---
I think you need to hold the running button to ‚Äúburst out‚Äù
---
Let me know if this helps 
---
no this is patrick
---
You're

Boosted means a person was boosted to get a higher ranks, basically meaning they either cheated or exploited 
---
ill get 1m tomorrow. i can show it to you. it can be a hassle with all the math.
---
&gt;because doing anything else really doesn't matter all that much
---
Then they need to be made to matter. Survivors consider escaping the only activity, there's so much more than that. Having everything be a priority would slow the game down a hell of a lot. 
---
&gt;The arbitrary numbers I used total to -20% speed at the beginning of the game, which is a huge hit.
---
That's my point. You might as well say the new gen speed is naturally -20% of what it is now. Survivors can just then cleanse effigies to make it increasingly faster. There is no comparison to the current gen speed, because that speed wouldn't exist anymore.
---
Does the new ranking system encourage tunnelers? That was the third or fourth game in a row where I start getting chased just a few seconds after being unhooked
---
I dc against iri heads + ebony too 
---
Because if you can't follow an audio cue when a totem is within range that's your problem.
---
I‚Äôm always tempted to let the chase go on longer than I need to when they are dropping pallets like candy.
---
Yeah but it's dumb that they make higher levels of it bigger, don't you think? Because that's a much larger range to go through
---
To use head on, you have to wait the three seconds and do a fast exit from the locker. Usually hold your run button when leaving it.
---
To grab a survivor in hatch animation, you only need to to a regular (not lunging) attack.
---
Why
---
Because iri heads aren‚Äôt fun to play against 
---
I find them fun when I‚Äôm survivor it‚Äôs challenging 
---
I thought you meant defend ruin in game
---
Yeah during one of the streams they showed a slideshow of how it worked. Based off what I saw It looks like the offering has more potential to be a game changer than before. The way it works now is hooks can only spawn a certain distance from each other and blocks any other hooks from spawning within that distance. Offering changes it so you either get more hooks closer together or less hooks that are farther apart.

---
Here's your source.
---
Discordance is a tracking perk more than a gen perk, once the survs realise you have that perk they work on separate gens
---
Do you plan to do the rest of them?
---
Wait I don‚Äôt understand what happened...did jumping out of the locker make the killer drop Meg? Is that a thing?

Don‚Äôt use the fountains 
---
I can see that, there are definately playstyles and game genres that are more likely to attract different  genders. I think you hit the nail (or survivor) on the head, especially with that support analogy. 
---
Though for shooters, I've also noticed women enjoy Battle Royals more than normal FPS because combat is generally elective until the very end so you can play that way (I also do this myself while other male friends like myself are far more aggressive while playing) 
---
Another interesting point was that there was a study done on personality types and apparently the more social you are IRL the more likely you are to be aggressive (aka interact with other players because murder is a social activity in this scenario apparently.)
---
I've been trying to get the Evil Incarnate achievement for a while now,each time I use both add-ons it takes so long to get to EW3 that by the time I actually get to it survivors are at the gates t-bagging
---
He‚Äôs slugging for the 4K. That‚Äôs pretty much it. Until hatch stand off is addressed somehow, you‚Äôll see a lot of this.
---
I thought about it but you'll only stay expose and you can't really hide when you're puking your guts out but I sure wanna try it.
---
Her ability has a weird hitbox, its a bit tough sometime to loop without being hit.
---
In a chase try to goad her into a clear line of sight and when she starts spitting, make a hard turn to avoid it and try to break line of sight and hide.idk if that's the most effective but it's worked for me so far 
---
&gt; 5) Nerf those two killers. You know which two I mean. They aren't needed to be so strong anymore. But most players ate still choosing them because....why not?
---
Which two? Billy and Nurse?
---
or how he makes elephant noises when he get stunned
---
This was my first try haha, didn‚Äôt even intend to get it. I even got EWIII with 5 gens left, but after ruin was destroyed those guys got to work fast. 
---
Nah I'm good, I enjoy my Ps4, I love the games, and all my friends are having a pretty good time with me. I'll consider getting a Pc one day but right now I have other ideas.
---
I've seen like five nurses in two and a half years on ps4. They weren't good. I think the way the controls are on ps4 (less control and forced slower reaction and movement, like turning) keeps people from playing her in the first place on console 
---
Maybe not bad, just works inconsistently. Like Balanced Landing, I find that it only works about 50% of the time. It has similar issues that Prepatch Lithe had with not proc-ing because chase requirements were not met. Balanced Landing can be cancelled by invisible ledges on the edge of drop points, and it‚Äôs starting to be a real issue because of it. It‚Äôs impossible to predict. For Dead Hard, I think what causes mine to not work is the Sprinting requirement. The slightest hesitation in Sprinting is the main issue most are seeing.  You have to watch your back to time the perk but if you run into anything or brush against a wall you‚Äôre running past it can cause your character to slow down and thus prevent the perk from activating. (And I‚Äôve been testing it too, almost every time this is the reason why) The distance you lunge could be a tiny bit better too IMO. Plus at high rank you can really only ever get ONE good use from it, and then the killer never usually falls for it again and baits you to waste it. And it can be really obvious when the player has it too. 
---
I just feel like they could patch it and Balanced Landing so they don‚Äôt glitch and just outright not activate like they sometimes do. It nearly always results in my death when it happens. Lithe finally got the fix it needed. It‚Äôs time for Balanced Landing, Dead Hard and Sprint Burst to do the same. Sprint Burst needs an additional activation button so that you don‚Äôt waste it or crouch everywhere (hating having to bring urban to compensate). Balanced Landing and Dead Hard need bug fixing.

LOL

i like how you implemented 3 dc
---
‚Äúsweet cheeks‚Äù hehe boi
---
That‚Äôs exactly what you want.. then you can easily patrol gens and pick them off before they get them done as it takes much longer to safely complete a gen on your own
---
Don‚Äôt you dare blame this on the pip update. People have been doing this for ages before pipping was changed.

I get error codes from a few games, dbd is in a transitional period i feel, its a self fulfilling prophecy now where we expect it to mess up so when it does we make a big deal of it

Just do totems, do you know how many survivors pass fucking totems and not do them?

How does that not please the entity

It‚Äôs a perk for Jane Romero, the new survivor

Pulled this off by accident. Playing solo queue on haddonfield when guy gets facecamped by myers in street hookm hatch was right there and kate unhooks and gets hit whipe the unbooked meg ipens hatch with her key and we all jump in. Was amazed because I was the third to jump and didnt know where the last one was. She jumped in shortly after
---
But they still have time to release cosmetics for $$$ and DLC for $$$
---
I will say to BHVR what I said to the old DCUO devs who killer their own game for the same fucking issues. 
---
PRIORITIES. Real fans won‚Äôt care about cosmetics or additional DLC if your game continues to NOT WORK for large percentages of them. 
---
love me some tru3
---
All I can say is as much as I love this game and believe in BHVR, I am still nearly dumbfounded how some bugs are still stuck around even after being constantly mentioned. Like I think some from like 7 months ago could still be in here. Not saying BHVR should be perfect but we could use a time where the devs focus on making the game less unstable, if you get me. At the moment it's not completely unplayable but a lot of things can get in the way of enjoying it.
---
I feel like I am going to small pp jizz
---
I‚Äôd be okay with something like this. Ruin is so damn inconsistent. I hate even running the perk.
---
I get what your saying, yeah people on here have been whining, understandably but we need some patience as this shit is hard to do and we can‚Äôt just say fix it and except it to be done.
---
Maybe if BHVR sent out a social media post and said something to the effect of ‚Äúhey we hear your complaints and we‚Äôre working on it‚Äù might help people understand more and be less complainy
---
Very clueless and a little cocky, two were cleansing a totem next to each other with me visibly on a hill after i chased them, a third was running in the distance and a fourth was hiding to my right in the killer shack. Managed to get a good amount with all those three, then the one in the shack got things going üòà

Had a match on The Game map with Plague, this perk, and was experimenting with Hematite Seal (+10 seconds of infection on objects) and Severed Toe (considerably increases the rate survivors gain infection from interactions). Went around barfing on the unblocked 4 gens, leaving them infected for 45 seconds each time, and never had to puke on the survivors directly, they all became broken sick quickly and I had great pressure on them. They couldn't even touch a gen without getting sick, and at one point they gave up on cleansing at fountains since it gave me easy downs. 
---
So yeah, it can totally work and apply pressure to them, but once the gens are unblocked, you have to play normally until a few gens get done, but keep infecting every gen you come across. I Have also experimented with double infection time on objects add-ons (max of +15 seconds = 50 seconds) this time on Coal Tower map, which wasn't as useful, but lasted long enough that I could infect 5 gens on my patrol and no one could work a gen without getting sick. 
---
Message them before and say you wanna farm .

&gt;Me (Killer): 75% bonus points in sacrifice
---
&gt;Me: *Down a survivor for the first time and start walking to hook*
---
&gt;Survivor: **YEET**
---
&gt;Me: ...
---
Yeah I stopped playing for a long time and now I'm stuck in the black hole of rank 15 due to getting back into it and dealing with this BS
---
Yes I love the scalding glare in my glasses, perfectly burningn my retinas
---
Yea but it does tell you when there‚Äôs one nearby even if you aren‚Äôt looking, what small game should do is increase cleansing speed and give bonus blood points for cleansing totems and hexes.
---
Patrolling gens is boring as shit
---
I think the perk is great. It isn‚Äôt as much of a set back for good survivors, as they can just go for greats (which isn‚Äôt really that difficult imo) and noob survivors can just look for the totem.
---
Depends which Jason iteration you're talking about. If we're taking the newer movies into account, Jason is a lot smarter and faster in his 2009 remake and was only really slow in FvJ for no reason other than to give Freddy a chance since it seems the writers knew realistically Jason would of been able to beat Freddy too easily in the real world, thus needed to give him weaknesses to even it out. 
---
And while the Friday movies are disjointed and don't connect well, its proven Jason is an undead zombie with superhuman strength and regenerative abilities after part VI. I don't see how old man myers or thorn cult timeline myers would stand a chance. He'd probably be able to beat pre-part VI Jason when he was still more or less human.
---
Its not just looping its when you hide and he just goes around using his shock. Its a 0ersonal dislike for me. Bad players can use it to find you in ways a bad legion couldn't. 
---
I'd say yes. Make ace a viable supportive role
---
Hag is fun once you hopping around the map with all your traps at light speed.
---
I do it for more playtime, points are just a plus. 
---
Whooshception
---
You can directly compare Legion with Franks Mix Tape to Huntress with Iridescent Head. It isn't fun to play against for the majority of players, since they are very very strong addons.
---
Funny how everyone complains about NOED when it‚Äôs so easy to counter and I‚Äôm a survivor main on PS4! I can‚Äôt believe on how many times I‚Äôve seen people run right past a totem, unless it‚Äôs lit and they know hex ruin is going, they even have a perk to find the damn things. 
---
It‚Äôs a great side mission only wish they would put a counter instead of having to count them and do gens and evade the killler ect, ect, but you know what I do it and when I‚Äôm done I know if this is number 4 or 5 I‚Äôm cleansing. Normally I see the broke piles and count them as I‚Äôm making my rounds. 
---
But seriously people NOED is easy to counter just start cleansing totems, then you watch that poor trapper or spirit who sucks and is counting on that NOED to pop when the last gen is done to see the hope drain from them, because I just cleansed that last totem seconds after the last gen was done to hear the explosion! Lol yes I‚Äôm that asshole! 
---
They also need to buff totem BP to 1000 for dull and 2000 for lit ones, you would see allot more people finding totems and NOED would become a useless perk like DS is now! 
---
Stake Out and Dance With Me for survivor. Surveillance and Third Seal for killer.
---
:D Nea's Killer apprenticeship is going nicely I see!  We need a downloadable Gif of Pig clapping though xD I must has it fer my online shenanigans
---
You can‚Äôt use the top 1% of killers as a control, ‚ÄúIf Zubat/Scott can run a killer without Ruin, so can you‚Äù. Like come on dude, those guys have 4,000 hours logged and don‚Äôt represent the average killer pop. They can run killers perkless and still slaughter survivors.
---
Second, even they use Ruin on their killers. Unless they are running Billy or Nurse, they absolutely use Ruin too. Not sure what twitch streamer you are referring to, but Zubat is probably the best killer main out there and he uses Ruin.
---
Horror as a genre is pretty campy. Hell, NOES2 has pretty heavy gay overtones. I love horror and am a lesbian but my love of horror doesn't actually have anything to do with my sexuality so I guess I'm no help lol
---
You thought tbagging would bring them back to their keyboard?
---
The more this conversation goes on, the less I believe you actually understand what it means to play killer lol
---
Seems like you played a bunch of dumbasses.
---
I will never, ever, ever understand how people walk around their lives this dense.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
God forbid the company you're literally screaming at (out loud, I can hear you) try and find a way to keep paying the people they diverted from making new content (you know, like every other game studio's business model) so they could continue to try and grow a popular game (that YOU like so much you're literally rabid with rage that it isn't perfect and exactly the way you want it to be).
---
I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve been working on a gen in a dark corner and I see this shadow moving towards me and I think it‚Äôs the pig or something and get the shit scared out of me and it‚Äôs just my Claudette teammate! 
---
Lol. I feel so bad for you. You are missing out. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you rather just get into another game where you actually do chases and kill survivors than spend 10 or more minutes looking for an urban evading survivor who all they care about is escaping the hatch lol
---
I don't really get the "only care about $$$" argument, only for bhvr specifically. If you *had* to buy dlc, and *had* to buy cosmetics, sure I'd agree. Instead you can mostly earn this stuff through playtime. Cosmetics are handled by a different team than gameplay, so that shouldn't concern you whatsoever. Not to mention, the game is almost 3 years old. Do you think they keep getting paychecks because of new game sales?
---
It's true, there are a lot of bugs in the game that prevent people from enjoying it, and their priorities seem to be out of whack, but I genuinely believe they love the game, and are trying hard to improve it, but are having trouble because of their inexperience. 
---
Totem perks just need a rework. The system works for Devour Hope that yield incredibly devastating results for survivors but perks like Huntress Lulably are virtually useless.
---
That would be bad ass! To have a predator as the killer and with his thermal imaging vision! 
---
I don't care about bugs or glitches until it makes it to where I can't even open the game. This isn't some little issue in blowing out of proportion is the thing 
---
Meg best girl! Great art! 
---
You ran NOED too didn‚Äôt you
---
I can do that easy lol, Im also wanting to make a remake of the rage gif of the bald guy acting calm and then going nuts but in a meg version or something üòÇ
---
Yeah couple years ago killers were complaining that the hitboxes were too small (they werent they just sucked) so the devs made the hitboxes larger 
---
Sounds like you wanna camp, then tunnel, but doesn‚Äôt work out because a survivor outsmarted you and you don‚Äôt like it. Hmm ü§î
---
And I agree about the transitional period. It's just that I'm getting kicked off the game due to backend server connections and now it's starting to say I have possible corrupt save data due to that 
---
&gt;the "gen-rush meta" doesn't exist
---
Its not a meta but you're dumb if you think the phrase is meaningless. Gen rushing is when you ignore everything else to get gens done as fast as possible. This includes but isnt limited to leaving people on the hooks, not cleansing totems, and not opening chests.

---
&gt;Spies from the shadows is one, getting a nerf now.
---
... after it got buffed pretty well the patch before?
---
lol
---
I want to believe they still care. But they do so many things that remind me of the old DCUO devs that it‚Äôs hard to have any faith. I will say they seem to maybe be finally trying to fix this things with the latest patch. Teachable perks can be the issue for DLC characters, and sure I may not have to BUY the character but the amount of grinding required is done on purpose to compel you to just buy it. I want BBQ &amp; Chilli but will NEVER spend money on Leatherface because I will NEVER play him. If Shrine actually out out good perks more often....
---
I‚Äôm just getting sick of seeing games go down the drain because the Devs make a little money and then only care about that. And I‚Äôve seen it happen a lot. 
---
I see nothing wrong with this. You're playing and teasing your food, they are ment to die.
---
It's not camping if they're running straight toward the hook with me running at them. Wiggling underneath a hooked survivor isn't an intended mechanic, and is considered a bug and an exploit, you fucking bent projectile.
---
Never happened to me yet but maybe the canadian servers are different?
---
Perfectly Balanced.
---
Lmao
---
I'm talking from a rank 2 killer's perspective. I used to play games where I can spare the survivor who lived long enough to see the exit but got downed at it or gave hatch almost every game. I could play subpar strategies that would make it very hard to get a 4k like rarely defending hooks. Not possible anymore since I need a 4k in every game I play
---
Unfortunately, community managers are some of the least important employees in the eyes of the upper management. The people that decide who gets paid what and who keeps their jobs, don't understand that communication with your player base is important. That's when things like this happen. 
---
I have always agreed that transparency is important. As many faults as it had, I commended the Friday the 13th devs for laying out a roadmap of exactly what they were TRYING to accomplish, and telling their players why it wasn't working. But there's also the other edge of that sword - When you announce that something is coming, and it doesn't come quick enough, the players complain \*cough dedicated server\* \*cough console optimization\*. They assume that because they heard one update and no more, that it was discarded. People are just incredibly ignorant to the fact that things take fucking time and effort and are alongside 8 billion other things.
---
(To clarify, yes I agree with you &lt;3)
---
which part are you confused about?
---
The hitboxes are bull shit all around in this game. You only notice the bull shit hatchet hits though. Do you ever notice the hatchets that should of hit you? 
---
That‚Äôs the reason the hatchet hitbox fix a few months ago didn‚Äôt fly. The hit boxes are just completely fucked up in this game.
---
Nope I was going for the adept
---
I knew you were going to post that image for Michael. It's perfect.
---
This is another attempt at the Chameleon killer we all want to see. Of course a disguising killer won't really work with swf, so the idea with this isn't just that the killer can look like you, but that it could be you without you even realizing. The only way to really pull off a split-personality killer is if the killer is a survivor for some of the time, and a killer for the rest, so how about a killer that any of the survivors could become at any moment?
---
I thought also it'd be interesting to have a chapter that's based on something with clearly defined characters, but that is in the public domain rather than licensed. A lot of the quotes and details are based on the musical however.
---
I didn't write lore sections because that's time consuming and that's an existing story.
---
In a nutshell, if he stares at you long enough, it exposes everyone on the map for a one shot down. It also increases his lunge/window vault speed.
---
Nice save! :D 
---
Yes, this one
---
I see. That's pretty wild. 
---
She still runs fast enough that it doesn‚Äôt matter. She‚Äôs very strong. She doesn‚Äôt need buffs. We don‚Äôt need another spirit. Spirit was fine at release and they buffed her so much she‚Äôs up there with billy and nurse.
---
Me and a friend spent a good long time trying to get this with randos and when we finally did, the achievement didn't unlock. Still bitter about it. :(
---
Dotson...DOTSON....WE GOT DOTSON OVA HEEYAH

---
Ghost probably has a Mori.
---
Thank you lol I always hate my voice üòÇüòÇ I was told I don't sound British today though which shocked me 
---
Confirmed, Claudette is a Meerkat.
---
Nah ik about all the other hitboxes especially the one where they hit u through a window after u walk away from it. And yes they definitely are, they need to balance it out tbh
---
Not saying you can't criticize it, but at the moment it's not DS anymore, it's a different perk, you might as well use a perk you like using in place of a perk which you don't &amp; if you like using DS your free to use it, it just sounds like you want to keep using it because it's always been in every surv build. And from what I have seen from playing both surv &amp; killer, is that survs in solos are still very altruistic. If you get downed &amp; then DS &amp; downed again, there is a surv on the to help you. And if there is no surv or vault nearby, learn to do what killers had to do with the old DS, suck it up.
---
Also could we like, stop. I don't care who "wins" or "loses" this argument, I just wanna say it's over, I've got... well I'd say better things to do, but well... as I stated in our other conversation, I don't think either of us do. So I'll just say that I've got games to play.
---
This is beautiful 
---
Google is your friend. You can look at all the killers powers and perks. 
---
*plays Lion King - We are one*
---
probably yes
---
everything has its time dude
---
They've mentioned the infinite load screen and have said that it's hard to fix because the game never crashes to give them an error report. You can ask McLean about them when he streams on twitch. 
---
They obviously still care, otherwise they wouldn't have promised an extra 5 years of content updates. 
---
On the topic of new characters and their teachables, what would you want them to do? They spend money on adding new characters to the game. They spend money on fixing the bugs everyone complains about. They spend *extra* buying the rights to Leatherface, Michael, Amanda, etc. to bring beloved horror icons into the game. Of course they're going to cost money. Of course they're not going to put their perks in the shrine that often. They still need to make money. If they don't make money, they can't update the game. This should not be a foreign concept. 
---
Think the toxicity is a tad up for this 
---
Disagree..Gen Rush is a thing...no matter how you want to phrase it's meaning.  Bringing Toolboxes in (2-3 often) and in some cases Perks to speed that Gen completion is def aiding in getting them done asap. If a Killer chases a decent person, gets them downed and Hooked in a decent timeframe and 3 Gens pop with a 4th soon after...that is a Gen Rush.  Just because it's their main objective doesn't change what can happen in a game.
---
I play both sides and sometimes it happens, competent Survivors can easily get 3 Gens done in no time.  Sure there are many factors that help or hinder this: Map, Killer, where spawns where, Killer's Perks, Killer's map pressure, Killer skill, Survivor getting chased skill etc.  
---
This is why I'll always love playing my Gen Doctor build off and on.
---
Technically, that is just doing the objective. And I think it speaks volumes that if one side just does their objective competently then the other side has almost no chance. 
---
No. In fact tunneling pretty much ensures you‚Äôll safety pip at best. 
---
It isn't an insult....taking it as such is a silly silly thing.  Killers can Camp/ tunnel for a Kill...part of their objective and as such is the label and definition of it, same as when Gens get done within several Minutes match starting.  That's part of the reason the Emblem System was reworked...
---
We can mince words all day/night, but it's tiring when players want to downplay what is a thing that happens in a game.
---
Keyword: PS4. Try playing mouse and keyboard red rank Nurse, Billy, Spirit. Games are over pretty quick and if they aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs hot potato on hooks.
---
Look at Minecraft. Bought out by Microsoft after having been THE most popular game for a year or two and they still suffer the same shitty lighting bug since beta 1.3

Hahah Joan of Coffee/Tea instead of Joan of Arc? :P 
---
Well I luv em all the same and tour videos are always a nice bit of entertainment!
---
So fun using stbfl and hitting someone half second after hitting someone on the other side of the map
---
Unfun things I found while playing hag: rotten fields
---
Notbhating or anything, but seems like saying: Just dribble the old DS if you don't like it. It takes you precious time of gennys.
---
She was French I think but near enough I like it üòÇ and thank you üñ§üñ§ glad you like them
---
I would absolutely be on board with this!
---
Erin is a modern day Ellen Ripley!  That is one bad ass Aussie!
---
I agree players can be dicks but you sound too hard on yourself with Ruin. It's not exactly a make or break perk, you can still do well without it 
---
Bugs are typically categorized as: Minor/Average/Major/Blocker
---
Blocker bugs take IMMEDIATE priority, no matter what that dev is doing. These are bugs that BLOCK the player from playing the game.
---
Major bugs are the ones that have a huge impact and are very common, and are to be worked on first, WHEN working on bug fixes. Keep in mind, bug fixes are not the only thing the devs do.
---
Average bugs are worked on during a devs 'bug fix' time, along with minors. On some days, a dev will fix a couple dozen minors, along with a couple average and majors, to make sure his day of work was well spent.
---
Alongside all of their other work, there are plenty bugs that the have to look at and say "I know how much time this is going to take, is it the best use of my time". Unfortunately, it's usually not. So as I said, if it's not a blocker, it won't take priority. And a dev spending and entire day working on one bug is not an efficient use of their time.
---
That's not even taking into consideration that sometimes they just don't know what causes something, or worst-case scenario - the code that was written is so bad that if they try to fix it with the current code, it will break 80 other things. so the need to slowly work on rewriting the other pages of code leading up to this one bug. And again, they need to juggle this with the dozens of other tasks they have. That is why a 'seemingly easy to fix' bug will get put off for so long. ESPECIALLY if it's a minor. Minor bugs include anything that is just visibly unappealing such as the mori cams, or a tree disappearing.
---
Oh I know she was French xD was making a funny about you being called Joan Snow and was putting a spin on Joan of Arc for ya xP I have failed *hides in nearby Locker of shame*
---
Hope you have a good one and good future matches!  Do,you ever upload any of em?
---
... And ruin is still mandatory because now there's pseudo totems that are 10 times bigger than a regular totem and it's the perk that makes them take a decent amount of time to blow up.  And all decent Survivors will power through just like they do now. 
---
  
---
I appreciate you trying to find a nice middle ground, but I think you're on the wrong path. 
---
On April 1st, I expect to see all of my killer portraits replaced with these images.
---
Badham is an elementary? Or a preschool. 
---
Immersed Claudettes will be pleased.
---
Ugh... The only good perks are Save The Best for Last and Surveillance... And the killers I use the most are Piggy and Stalkie Boi! (Both already lvl. 50)
---
&gt; . &lt;
---
That would be a nerf to oblivion. I highly suggest you play survivor and use small game. You will discover it's not as op as you think.
---
\*smells good
---
I do, I have another one coming up because I've been voted on another dare, ONE I MADE UP AND SUGGESTED AND THEN I GOT NOMINATED AND MOST VOTED TO DO IT THANK YOU FRIENDS, I don't mind though I like it anyway. Gonna be called "game of tag" and it's going to end badly no doubt üòÇüòÇ the poll ends tomorrow but I'm more than double voted from the second most voted so I know its gonna be me again
---
Nothing you do as Trapper would be considered that, well...other than an ebony offering. But the stuff myself and others listed are considered OP by not just survivors, there‚Äôs even killer streamers who won‚Äôt run that stuff because they know it‚Äôs broken OP.  I wouldn‚Äôt criticize you for using them necessarily, but I also think survivors are totally justified in just leaving the game if they want. 
---
Killers use "Gen rush" to render to the fact that 3/5 of survivor onj can be done in less time than it takes for 1/4 of the killer's to die on a hook.  It's a convenient shorthand to refer to the fact that competent Survivors can end a game in 4 minutes. 
---
When you get 1 guy on hook and the second person you chase is one of these guys, it's the easiest game in the world
---
no,  cap is the same but whatever you get is doubled. you can still only get 8000 in the category in game but the bp goes to 1600 with a single bloody party streamer. I find it easier with an example: If you only do gens the entire game then you get 8000 points in objective, after that you don't get any more added. you're maxed. but at the end your points are counted and multiplied by whatever the thing is. so your 8000 becomes 16000. they're effectively the same thing but they make a big difference if you look at it from a wide angle
---
Give me an iridescent head and I‚Äôll miss it every time. (Playing on console)
---
Used to be Nurse. I still have trouble with her sometimes, but I spent a lot of time with her after a rank reset and was able to get to / maintain rank 1 with her. I try to switch up killers often, so I don't really have trouble with anyone but Nurse.
---
fair enough, it does seem a little overkill to get exposed and a speed boost. but it's not a SUPER noticeable boost, just enough to actually get to doors before they're open and people are leaving.
---
I‚Äôm not that good as a survivor, but Huntress. I feel like I‚Äôm playing a free spinoff of Call of Duty: Dark Souls - Merciless edition V.3.14 cause the instant I‚Äôm in line of sight, I have hatches whooshing by.
---
The last (and only) time BBQ appeared on the shrine was in 2017. you can check all perks on the Wiki's Shrine of Secrets Archive page
---
When did I mention getting rid of the detection? If something increased cleansing speed and bp I would bring it, it would be another counter to thrill of the hunt and all hex builds.
---
Can confirm somer rank 16 dumbass in a Spirit tunneled the shit out of 4 of us survivors when we ran bps. Dumbass didn't even hit his 4k of despite all of that.
---
Honestly the hag would be such an interesting movie. Her lore is great imo, kinda dark. I think it would be along the lines of a horror or psych thriller. 
---
Huntress would be neato, it could be like a true crime mockumentary. By the way, the song she hums is a Russian lullaby Bayu Bayushki, give it a go some time. Russians are hard core dude. 
---
It was on 2 or 3 weeks ago i think
---
Better safe than sorry
---
Ah ok I thought you were saying get rid of detection. Oops.
---
So hitboxes are fine when I can, as killer, swing through every pallet I see because 9/10 times I know I'm still going to get the hit? It's fine when I can be all the way through a second story window, falling down, and still get hit because my head is still peeking above the sill?
---
   I play both killer and survivor, so I get pissed for the survivor when I get bullshit hits that just should not have connected. It's every single game, and the lag isn't the problem. It's the hitboxes that extended past the pallet/window.
---
He probably won't have his robot hand or boomstick so he has to run
---
Yeah drastically! I was getting so many games 
---
Is the Plague's adept trophy on PS4 bugged? I've done 2 games with 4k with only her 3 unique perks equipped and it still hasn't popped. I've done every other one just fine but this is a bitch and a half. 
---
the way you described it would be really fun but the lore makes it seem like he was already a sadistic bastard before he got hired. for this reason he seems more like a cheap villain than the main character of a horror movie. would love to see a movie based off what you described though
---
I just do not get it,It is mainly me who disconnects but not him,but no lag is detected even often on the killers side. I am wondering if it is a new way for killers to trick the system but then again it should DC the both of us in that case..also..bots are so pointless..Botting for maybe 2k points a game? Gross.
---
It's probably because he was an early killer. The newer og have much more fleshed out backstories. The devs definitely have gained confidence in their lore writing and I think it's great. I'm sure they want to touch up some lore for older killers but it would be iffy to do, since what they do have is already set and fairly well known. I think they probably felt people wouldn't be as interested as they actually are in lore, so they didn't put too much emphasis on it for quite a while 
---
bringing out new content every three months is ruining the game, they should rescind that promise and instead focus their effort into making the current state of the game better, even just qol things like the new queue time text , looks so bad on the ui, could be implemented in a way where it looks nice stuff like that, just stop bringing out new killers and survivors, theres no need

---
i think they intentionally made you able to hit from above, because you used to be able to keep the killer above your head on certain maps. swinging through pallets happens because there‚Äôs no pallet vacuum anymore, so you can be touching the survivor when you hit them before they even decided to throw it down and it‚Äôll push you back. the hitbox sizes themselves are fine.

i use claudette about as much as i use the laurie strode i havent bought, but thanks?

Two words.

They seriously need to do something about this, I don‚Äôt get why the closing the hatch change didn‚Äôt go through

HEY C'MON SHE WAS ASKIN FOR IT, EH? 
---
Two words btw: ROLEPLAYING. CHATROOM.
---
although it might make some people mad;
---
halt new chapters, if any of the cosmetics team know anything about fixing bugs, lump them into the engineers and halt cosmetics too. fix the game's big problems like 3 mans, hitboxes, lack of dedicated servers (yes i know they're coming soon) etc etc, then focus on balence, THEN add new stuff. if you add new stuff that could break old stuff onto already broken old stuff, it just makes a fucking mess.

Sure. I'm not about to hate on you for your opinions. We can all be civilized. 
---
Here's my first question--is this list based on how well a killer can actually perform or is it based on your experience with them? 
---
Would've been sick if she was thrown in the hatch after that mori LOL
---
Better than sniffing coffee. More invigorating too ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
If you want to see my proposed trapper buffs, I made an entire post recently. Shameless plug over. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what singular thing I‚Äôd change. I know a helluva lot of people would change legion in a heartbeat, but that character isn‚Äôt the sole reason the game is unfun. I know people will have my head for that, but legion isn‚Äôt the sole reason this game is unfun, it was just the last straw for a lot of people. People tend to confuse those 2 statements. 
---
Gens being done at Mach speed is an issue, I agree, but there are more issues that do take time to handle. We can‚Äôt expect one single chapter or patch to fix every single issue with the game. 
---
For starters, I think survivors playstyle should change. This is an asymmetrical game, meaning that one person is almighty and super powerful and there are 4 less powerful people. I think stealth should be buffed immensely. Back when Darkness Among Us released, that locker change was amazing. Running directly at the killer and looping them for 5 gens is not how anyone would act if a crazed serial murderer was hunting them down, you‚Äôd be hiding at every possible chance. I‚Äôm not exactly sure on how they could, but I think survivors should favor stealth over going toe to toe with the killer. Laugh at me, call it a dead game, but Deathgarden is handling that aspect amazingly. All throughout the map are tall patches of grass that scavengers can hide in to avoid the Hunter, that‚Äôs how DBD should be too. 
---
Look, there are a lot of changes that I think should happen but I don‚Äôt want to make a long comment, but just to summarize I think stealth should be favored for survivors more than going head to head with the killer. I know how hard it can be to change a game‚Äôs entire design and how it plays when it‚Äôs been out for nearly 3 years, but something needs to happen. I feel like the devs are too afraid of delaying or scrapping chapters to work on game balance, and that‚Äôs an issue. The more killers and perks that are added means more balancing changes which means previous stuff that needed changing is delayed. Legion and Freddy are a perfect example. 
---
Considering it's normal for developers to do nothing beyond the occasional announcement, I think they do fine. 
---
It makes sense, I‚Äôm mediocre at her but I try from time to time. 
---
How are you gonna tell him what his experience was
---
its literally what it is rn, only 1 to 2 proplrbget downed average so whats the point
---
It makes sense, Huntress is actually hell to play as. 
---
I like this, or they can make it so it doesn‚Äôt go down when you‚Äôre slugger, or they can make it so that it only activated on your last hook, I would like that a lot 
---
Can you link the panel with the reference?
---
I play on PC and I prefer the old matchmaking they re-implemented. 
---
I was running 8-12 200ms+ Lobbies for everyone ONE 75-150ms ping lobby.  And further more it was every 16-20 Lobbies for a 35-50ms Lobby.
---
This is stupid and I'm glad they fixed it. Plus at Rank 7 I'm getting instant matches now, whereas with the "new" system it was taking minutes.  (I know, MINUTES.)
---
Matchmaking sure needs fixed, but that new system was not it, at least on PC.  
---
To me this is Devour Hope. I always use it when I wanna have a good time. 
---
Oh, man... I can perform well enough with most, but Huntress is easily my worst. I can't aim her hatchets for shit. They're inconsistent and have ridiculous cool down time. I pretty much require the Manna Grass/Flower Babushka to do much of anything, and even then...
---
I‚Äôm not seeing them. Where are they?
---
*cleansed in two seconds*
---
BS thats ingame model... Right?
---
Hitboxes are broken though. Trying to pallet stun a killer is hard enough. Most of the time it simply doesn't work as all they have to do is backstep 1mm to avoid it.
---
I‚Äôm currently on my first rewatch of the series and it‚Äôs just as great as before.
---
BOB would be an awesome killer, but I can‚Äôt exactly pin down what they would do for his power, seeing as possession is his thing, and that would be tough to work into DBD. Maybe a power based on crows? ‚ÄúThe crows are not what they seem‚Ä¶‚Äù
---
Coop would make an awesome survivor, just about anyone on the show would.
---
***Who hurt you?***
---
hah, he said something I don't like, let's condescendingly reply!!1!!
---
I know people on here look down at Twitch, but it's a good indication of \*most\* games, especially this one.  And people are getting frustrated with it.  That bodes ill.
---
fairy tail is a manga about a guild of wizards that take on jobs and fight bad guys. it was made into a popular anime series as well. the author has started a new manga called eden's zero. he liked video games and sometimes puts references into his works like in fairy tail there was a competition that played out like assassins creeds multiplayer 
---
anyway a chapter of the eden's zero manga has rebecca being chased by a killer, the imagery looks a lot like DBD. then it cuts away and shows that rebecca isnt actually in any danger she was just playing a game like DBD
---
Legion
---
Overpowered
---
Nice!
---
I got this one totally by accident, by jumping through the hatch without even realizing it was because someone had opened it.  Suuuuuch a good feeling.
---
&gt; (how haddonfield music got super loud I'll never understand
---
Spaghetti code.
---
Fix hits through pallets?  Breaks the generator in the bathroom in The Game!  (lol.. dunno, just being silly. But still, spagehtti code.)
---
A noed face camp
---
I mean it doesn‚Äôt matter though, your experience isn‚Äôt gonna trump the people who‚Äôs experience is garbage rn outcry 
---
I get the idea of giving the last person a way out, but it's so frustrating to get 3 people dead and lose the last one just because they got 2 gens done. The hatch is definitely a problem.
---
Username checks out
---
Let them believe...its all they got
---
That's the problem, I only play solo and people don't seem to understand cleansing totem s is kind of important. If I spend all round running around trying to get 5 totems, even with small game, I lose time that could have been spent on a gen, it seems that small game is more rare than anything which is sad
---
It would‚Äôve fit perfectly if it was a David with the trap on him
---
Stake out helps me a lot of the time, especially for stealthy builds
---
Huntress..I can play Nurse good (console) but Huntress oof
---
It‚Äôs just amplified by the need to pip/safety-pip  
---
this is the single worst bot on reddit
---
I'm not 100% sure because I don't play Nurse, but I'm willing to bet it doesn't affect her fatigue. 
---
I haven't found a voice for him yet and I thought up the idea last night when my friend who voices meg was already with me at the time üòÇ I'm getting more people though so there's gonna be more varied characters around soon but nobody's claimed poor little David :(
---
No. The headpiece. Incense burner and other things are custom. There is some cgi elements for the picture but it‚Äôs not a picture from the game. 
---
I can't play Huntress well at all. I imagine I would just embarrass myself trying out Nurse.
---
Nah I don't see a reason to down vote you. :D
---
**SUPER FAST**. **GOTTAGOFAST**.
---
They changed that last patch
---
It reduces snowball potential drastically. And makes cleansing other dull totems worthwhile since it would also reduce the number of tokens. 
---
Ik its just cuz its so well done it looks like its from the game. Props to whoever did this (if you didnt do it)
---
Yeah, the second game had a note that said he studied it so much he could remove it without needing a key.
---
Oh good. I hate being a try-hard. Makes games more scummy and less relaxing when I need to play a certain way. 
---
But your blind and can‚Äôt see at all
---
&gt;It's an end game perk meant as a last-ditch effort. 
---
(Im tired right now so I'm probably talking shit) 
---
If its suppose to be a last ditch effort then why do perks that aid or speed up the process of escape of survivors exist?
---
Doesn't that mean without a possible Noed at the end od the game, killers are put at a disadvantage?
---
Of course it's harder on ps4, we get lag spikes after a blink and can't see them half the time. 
---
Is the dark trap bug fixed?  The one where the Trapper can see the trap is darkened but the survivors can't.
---
Spirit 
---
That's a classic meme 
---
Didn‚Äôt the guy say he saw 3 disconnects or am I just being stupid?
---
Myers. I'm just not good at finding good stalking locations and always end up being spotted early. 
---
Yeah I feel you. Today I had to mori someone with wraith but I only had a yellow one. That wasn't fun for me or the survivors
---
I'm surprised at all the killers in this thread like you who dare to feel sympathy for survivors who have braindead teammates.
---
I, meanwhile, am filled with glee when I see that one survivor is scared of me and screwing up big time. Call me crazy, but I enjoy playing the villain in this game.
---
Actually, I do think Nurse should be nerfed. The only reason the vast majority of people can't 3-4k every game as her is because they don't play her much. Almost anyone who has a respectable amount of time on Nurse is capable of completely dominating games and making it a super frustrating experience for the other 4 people in the match.
---
I disagree that DBD is a difficult game to learn compared to other mp games. There is more you have to learn to play at a basic level, but once you get that stuff down there really isn't much more to figure out. From there it's pretty much just getting over fear of the killer and optimizing loops. When balancing, I don't think they should consider people who can't even bother to read the ingame guides considering they are easily accessable and the game tells you about the tutorials when you first start.
---
The thing is that most of the stuff the devs are nerfing now isn't stuff brand new players would be using anyways. If you don't even know to go fix generators and don't know how to use pallets, you aren't going to be using stuff like decisive strike anyways. There's no point leaving stuff that's super powerful for high ranked players untouched just because bad players need it to win.
---
Also, I do personally think that everyone can get good in this game. I am roughly average in every game I play, but in this one I'm pretty good. This game takes almost no mechanical skill (except for a couple of killers) and the game knowledge and decision making you need to get good are gained over time. The only people who have a lot of playtime and are still bad are people who either don't have the low amount of mechanical skill needed or don't try to get better.
---
No, I'm aware of the issues. I play the game. I just mean why do you feel the need to tag them in discord? They're aware of the issues, the community throws it at them every day. Yelling at them isn't going to do anything except make you look extremely negative.
---
Also, the team that fixes bugs and the team whose job it is to create DLC and cosmetics are completely different parts of the company.
---
Coincidence? I Think NOT
---
Just wondering, what games have you worked on?
---
Lol
---
I have a rule that if a surv camps or otherwise misuses the god pallet I make sure they die
---
Ummm pirates?
---
YEEEET
---
I am a killer main. No matter what the fuck I do survivors get mad at me. I can relate...
---
If you see someone with a flashlight, bring Lightborn. 
---
I'm not? I'm telling what my and everyone else I know's experience was
---
everyone complaining about animations, character design, cosmetics, etc...
---
but what I'd really kill for is how smooth survivor movement was before the first engine udpate (I believe that was patch 1.4?)
---
back then, if you wanted to 180 and run the opposite way, you could do that in an instant - now you need to wait for your character to fully turn first.
---
Oh. Haha. Nah, no stupid here. It was a reference to the 1v1 from the screenshot.
---
Bruh
---
Depends if you want a lot of stuff on the bloodweb go to it but don‚Äôt get it right away only get it when you see the entity 
---
&gt;with it's ability to switch obsessions mid game
---
Literally only a problem if you tunnel once the obsession is dead. 
---
I have a better idea for you to get through ur book fast
---
Dwight goes into locke --&gt; 1 page
---
Shack pallet dropped before first gen is popped (AKA the tydetime tek) ---&gt; .5 pages
---
NOED Facecamp with totem 3 feet away ---&gt; entire fucking book
---
AH YES MY DEAR QUITE PUNGENT INDEED
---
To me, STBFL fits that criteria. I don't really think it's considered meta, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
Yeah it's really good. It also gives you 300% more Deviousness bloodpoints and is best paired with her ultra rare addon that makes traps give you the hindered status when you trigger a trap while also making her slightly faster.
---
Super Freddy.
---
It would've done nothing here if the killer wasn't a reject
---
People complain Bc there tired of the constant bull from the devs. if they were "Trying there hardest" they would be fixing the game when its at its worst state instead of adding more annoying killers 
---
"Guys help people left the game when i denied them fun!1! pls report abnd ban!"
---
There's literally an achievement for hitting through pallets.

Honestly. Wraith, i feel like i do wayyy better against him then freddy. i enjoy playing wraith lots so i might just know how to play against him lmao

My thoughts exactly, what game do they think we're playing
---
I got reported for getting in a game in less the 2 minutes ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
"great ducking job, youre the next Einstein now aren't ya"
---
It was a mind game /s
---
Could I add you too? If it's okay that is
---
The shack pallet is sometimes called the god pallet because it's one of the safest pallets in the game. One of the reasons is due to the long looping area with easy access to a window. It is also easy for the survivors to mind game with due to its shape. It's typically reserved for use if the basement is in the shack as well, and a survivor needs to escape, or to last a ridiculous amount of time if you play your cards right. One of the problems of using it early is making escapes from the basement really difficult.
---
I voted no for one reason. I want them to focus on Patches and optimization for now. Hell never even heard of evil dead before this, but im sure there are many people out there who want it
---
For those wondering what the iridescent button does, whenever the legion hits someone with feral frenzy, it causes their terror radius to spread across the entire map. To survivors it causes the heartbeat to sound like they are right behind you. 
---
For legion, it allows him to see where the survivors are in feral frenzy with the added bonus of breaking pallets if they vault over them
---
Oh lol.
---
Remove 3+ blinks, nerf omegablink, reduce her post-blink lunge. 
---
Ew wtf that's a guy?
---
Also allow her to be pallet-stunned mid-blink.
---
This isn‚Äôt the make America great again subreddit. Sorry. 
---
Just make them personal stats. For tracking your own improvement/whatever
---
Mate I‚Äôm sooorrryyy
---
Evolve had a cool feature that replayed the match from a top-down perspective after the match finished. Showed where everyone one was during the game. I think it would be cool to have in the game, to show things like gens getting powered, pallet stuns, saves, hooks, sacrifices, active totem breaks, etc. Easier to rewatch your own mistakes or watch a skilled player to learn from as well.
---
Probably would be useful for bug reporting as well since you'd be able to screen shot. (broken vault zones, unreachable totems/gen spots/ jigsaw traps/ fountains...)
---
Please i dont want 2 go back there, purple and red ranks ARE HELL
---
Yes 
---
Which I understand, but I've also had a few moments as killer where I go for the farmer after the unhook, lose them quickly, and immediately find the person who was unhooked because they were close by. DS can be used for 60 seconds after the unhook, and you don't always know if someone has it. The point of the 'new' perk is to reduce tunneling caused by the perk, but it's still something to take into account. At least this way, the perk doesn't completely reset upon a DS obsession switcheroo. This isn't a criticism of people who tunnel/don't tunnel/use DS/ don't use DS. I'm also not trying to balance around DS exclusively, though it needs to be taken into account. Just a potential fix to a very underwhelming perk ATM. 
---
This is art honestly.
---
if its brown flush it down, if its yellow let it mellow
---
It's public domain. Basically it's so old that it can't be copy-written anymore, anyone can use it. A specific rendition of Jekyll and Hyde can be copy-written, but not the general characters or story.
---
All up to you, I guess. I like to protect my teammates if I can, but everyone has their opinion on it. 
---
They are. Trans women do drag sometimes, but usually drag queens are men. The personas are considered to be women though, and almost always use ‚Äúshe‚Äù
---
I usually end up dropping the pallets early when chased, but that's because I don't want to get the killer close enough to attack me, because when the killer is that close, I'm suddenly nowhere near any pallets.
---
All BP offerings multiply the bonus to what's gathered in-game, upon game end.  The Perks like BBQ and WGLF do the same thing.
---
If you got 10,000 in a round and used a +100% to all categories offering (Escape Cake/Pudding), you'd have 20,000.  If you also had all 4 stacks of BBQ/WGLF (+100% Perk) you'd gain another 10,000 making it a total of 30,000.
---
If you use a perk or addon that adds to the points in-match (eg. 'Thrill of the Hunt' perk or Hillbilly's 'Speed Limiter' addon), it will only ever help gain points up to the category's cap of 8000.
---
So this whole concept is actually possible?
---
Who cares if they have fun?  It isn‚Äôt your job to make it fun for a killer or survivor.  That is the job of developers and it is called balancing.  If the game lets you do something then it is 100% fair for you to do so.
---
ok
---
&gt;New matchmaking was way worse on both PS4 and Xbox for me. I was lucky to play.
---
&gt;No it wasn't. 
---
Probably because she's new, the idea hasn't set in yet. 
---
It's been nerfed twice to its current state and perks have been added since applying NoeD to detecting totems.  I think they're happy with how it works.
---
Still...I feel like a potato. Lol this what I get for taking a break...

Because they aren't capable of doing so. (Maybe they are, but I expect it in 3 years - Remember the July 2016 promise of not having to remake SWF lobbies after every game?)
---
Agreed. 
---
Wow if he doesnt get any kills its his fault. It would be very dickish if you were to let the killer kill your teammate
---
Destroy it before noed activates!
---
Micheal would lose hands down don't get me wrong I love Halloween but as mentioned before. Jason is a super human zombified slugesqe demon capable of turning people into him basically. And Micheal is only "unkillable" because of thorn which as stated before was retconed meaning he's just. A human as shown in his ability to age just because he's super strong still doesn't mean he isn't human
---
Yeah me and another guy posted it and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen.
---
Billy and Quentin 
---
Yes please
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question but how do you make these?
---
With my current survivor farming build I run WGLF and always pair it with We‚Äôll Make It. It makes me feel better about being eagerly altruistic, because at least then I can quickly heal my teammate right under the hook and we can both be off doing gens quicker. I‚Äôd try it paired with Botany Knowledge if I had it to throw on just to see how that works out.
---
It fucks me up a lot when I expect a survivor to do the smart survivor things but then suddenly they *don't,* so when I start gearing up to counter those smart survivor things, and they don't, they somehow manage to gain an advantage by being bad.
---
I do the same sometimes. But if it‚Äôs the beginning of a match or something, that‚Äôs different. 
---
I came here to upvote this post not to get attacked!
---
A big nope, seeing that devs don't even have basic 2019 features such as match history, proper SWF, stats, etc.
---
This encapsulates my feelings about solo survivor right now entirely. On top of all this is load screen freezes. About 30% of my games it'll need the task manager on top of farming survivors who haven't got the common fucking courtesy to at least use BT with their WGLF, and straight face camping killers, this slows down the game and my enjoyment to almost non existence. Been feeling the same ever since and I barely get any fun out of it. 
---
Kind of a long shot finding the other three players on here, no?
---
The part where you sub to a game you're trying to learn even though you can't play it. That's the confusing part. 
---
They reverted the matchmaking system, ps4 is fucked again at later hours 
---
Ok, stupid question. What's the point of cleansing a totem that is dull? Genuinely don't know the answer to this question. 
---
Sam Rami makes more money. 
---
That's fine by me.
---
Basically everyone on reddit whined and whined about the matchmaking disparity in ranks in the new system to the point where devs reverted the change.  It sucks too because on PS4 that new matchmaking system is what made survivor playable for us again.  We were getting 30-60 second queues no matter what time if day it was or even if you had a swf!  It was incredible I haven't been able to play survivor in forever.  But alas they ruined it for us and now we are back to 15 min+ queues.  Basically just have to play killer exclusively now if we want queues.
---
Chances are the entity took his robot ha d and boomstick so he can‚Äôt fight back and fixed his old hand
---
well that fucking sucks
---
THIRD SEAL!
---
I think hes new...
---
She and legion are the only killers how don't have to rely on survivors making mistakes to catch them, why wouldn't you play her?
---
Yes daddy 
---
Getting to rank 1 as nurse isn't an achievement, it's an expectation.
---
Yeah, it pisses the ever loving shit out of me when I‚Äôm the killer who‚Äôs getting body blocked, but what are they supposed to do?  Feed their friends into my gaping maw?  I wouldn‚Äôt want to play as a survivor if I didn‚Äôt think my teammates had my back.
---
...As an aside, I don‚Äôt want to play as survivor.
---
I would love to but I am too busy urban evasioning behind some rocks on the other side of the map :/
---
Wait, was there lag? I just saw you on the gen near-ish the hook I'm heading to.
---
Damn, I never check lobby ping.
---
It really depends on the killer, and how good that killer is.
---
I don't think I'm absolutely amazing, but after practicing a lot with Nurse, and then later as Spirit, people who get my attention usually get hooked pretty quickly. There are times I am having an off night, but for the most part I rocketed to Rank 1 because of Nurse, and then later Spirit. Having also faced amazing Nurse and Spirit players, I'd say purposefully getting in a chase is not a great idea.
---
Spirit... cant track scratch marks because, well... scratch marks... &amp; sounds well everybody just stops moving. I can only find someone if i run into them while haunting
---
if you know the survivor you‚Äôre chasing will give you a hard time to down, i t3 the good survivor and leave them, and go for someone else easier to down, hook, kill. it‚Äôs sometimes not worth the time and effort to chase a good survivor for 3 gens when you can find someone else easily as doctor. a lot of times the good survivor will go out of their way to give you free hits etc to get you to chase them, and that‚Äôs how i get them \O/
---
Staring contest runs for 3 hours
---
I did this to an immersed Claudette on Badham couple weeks ago. Saw the trapper place trap between fence opening earlier.  I motioned for her to follow me then pointed through the gap and she ate it.  I'm not completely heartless though I helped her escape it and healed her.  
---
As I said,  I don't blame him at all. Just sucks when it happens. I agree, I player killer as well and after a few bad matches I don't wanna let anyone survive but if I see someone constantly hook farming. They'll be my main attack. Lol. Just how I personally am.
---
Its like that glitch in f13 were some random furniture just goes ultra light. 
---
It's 50-year-old Ash, so he's rocking a Nintendo Power Glove and Jeff's chub-manly physique.
---
The chainsaw will be added as an item, obviously.
---
Entitled crybaby‚Äôs never learn or have any bit of iq points
---
Why I have my messages disabled. Impossible to play a killer and not get a brain dead hate mail like these. 
---
April Fools is coming up...
---
Thank god they fixed it. I was actually able to play survivor and have fun for a change. Phew, close one.
---
Then the survivors probably weren't all good either, cause as nurse it's all about predicting whenever there is no LOS, and so every good sirvivor will immediately try to break LOS and then get you to predict them wrong.
---
And this is why nurse is balanced, since you gotta know the survivors tactic, before even he knows it, now combine that with a power that also requires muscle memory in order to allow accurate plays, and you got a killer that is really hard to play (against survivors that know how to juke the nurse atleast).
---
Huntress.  I cannot stand fps shooting games, they bore the shit out of me so I'm just not used to aiming projectiles.  Doesn't help that I play on console with her frames. 
---
Holy shit it‚Äôs meg but pretty
---
F
---
That build is cancer dude lol.  Iri heads alone are rough enough to play against but combining them with an ebony Mori is like putting a hat on a hat. 
---
Your point being...?
---
This is dark. I love it 
---
I love it on Freddy. And plus you get to play 5D chess with yourself because the survivors see a Freddy and an obsession and think he has Remember Me. Even better if the obsession actively avoids him because of this assumption and/or the rest of the team actively tries to defend them because of it.
---
One of his perk icons is literally his robot hand so it makes sense for him to have that instead of a chainsaw.
---
Very true, another benefit.
---
I doubt it. Cant blame them honestly dont run broken shit
---
Where are all the teammates like you when I'm being chased and injured running toward the gate :(
---
Freddy is way too high
---
Clown should be with pig, doc and wraith. Clown is better than them imo but the same tier
---
Or you know rather than be an apologist for them it would make sense that ummm they don't release the dlc from the play test when it was known to have issues. 
---
Not sure how shit match making isn't a major bug. When there is such rank disparity between survivor and killer, the game isn't fun and you then you realize it's time to go to a new game that's actually fun. ..... and doesn't freeze 25% of the time when you start a match... a bug that seems to never be getting fixed. And since they can't seem to figure out how to fix it, maybe they should at least give you back your offering if their shitty coding skills cause you to lose your streamers/escape cake/etc.
---
I know hating on the new system is the circle jerk rn but I‚Äôm fairly new to this game and killer and I‚Äôve managed to easily rack up multiple double pips on my way to rank 10, seems like players just aren‚Äôt as good as they think they are?
---
Which? 
---
This would simplify mob grinders
---
This is really cool, convenient, and would be a great addition - which means BHVR would never do it. 
---
tampon red lol that's a good one
---
that's why perks like Mad Grit and Sabotage/Boil Over exists
---
Seems like survivors are stuck with the long matchmaking times lately, I've had the same issue more or less. Although when playing killer, i find games relatively fast 
---
Honestly he was prob working with the killer 
---
i always love scrolling to the bottom to see what the bigots are saying 
---
I wanna write shitty fanfictipn now lol
---
Yeah your correct my mistake the new one is:Surveillance, save the best for last, tenacity, streetwise
---
Thank you very much :D
---
Don't act like killers are saints. Both sides of this community are sensitive whiners.
---
On the flipside, a survivor dares to run away, pallet stun, or loop slightly longer than the killer wants, and they get face camped.
---
Sure camp the little shits who teabag, flashlight click and point at every given chance, but to claim a survivor is 'toxic' and requires facecamping simply for using the environment to survive is wrong.
---
But would they really go out of their way to create functional perks for a joke? I dont think so.
---
I find its just better for the killer to take the L and move on, as a killer i can't stand long hatch standoffs just for a few extra thousand BP so i usually just let them go
---
that‚Äôs ok sweetheart. we‚Äôre not impressed either, with your poor excuse of a comment.

Try tombstone piece, better for that achievement and in overall because there's no movement debuff
---
And a big dick..right?
---
Come on Frank (Suzie, Julie, etc) teleport us to marss. 
---
Well I stole quotes from the musical, I'm not sure how that'd play into things. Other than that, there's no legal reason they couldn't do Jekyll and Hyde.
---
His treatment mode is way harder to use than you'd think. Yes it is easier to use,  ut it's at the cost of 5% movement speed. Many good doctors often decide to stay in punishment mode to traverse the map. His shock therapy might prevent a survivor from jumping a window or pallet, but as a survivor, you can prevent this from happening to you quite often and the doctor looses his movement speed when he does so. Nurse and Legion are the 2 killers I think are bullshit. Once they see you, wether they catch you or not is pretty much up to them, not you
---
Honestly though, everything that isn't an exploit is free to be used.
---
If you like playing competitively, then you can do everything this game offers as actual features in order to get the win.
---
I mean, just look at other online games with pvp, where, unless maybe when you're playing against a friend, you're not showing any mercy to your opponent whatsoever, cause why would you?
---
Sorry mate, bodyblocking isn't in my nature.
---
*I will however, take that medkit afterwards*
---
Oh my god, do it! :D
---
Meme: you are gay
---
Using a meme: memeing
---
but nobody is working on gens, everyone is just selfcaring and hiding as soon as they hear the the heartbeat for 1/10th of a second. Also nobody really uses Botany Knowledge at red ranks. 
---
Smh that's fucked up. Hopefully the issue gets resolved.
---
no
---
do a gen then i'll rub you, it will feel much better
---
Same haircut so fair game tho, but feng‚Äôs mouth is a little wider! 
---
Find the broken spots? They know where they are lol. Shit like the abbatoir window, ironworks window, coal tower window, inside crotus penn. All the action revolves around theae areas because 90% of the time you chase a survivor they're gonna run straight for them. Who can even blame them? It guarentees them the killer will probaboy abandon chase. However it's just really poor map design and game design.
---
It was better with the new matchmaking. Yes some of the estimated times were off, but it was more quick to find matches.
---
The frustration of waiting 15+ minutes to find a game, and being found first, tunneled, and sacrificed 4 minutes into the game makes me never wanna play this until we can find consistent matches.
---
Assuming they don't already do that, regardless of if the play did do well or not.  
---
At least you could go:" Check my stats I did 200 seconds of repair time, clearly I wasn't going anything."
---
&gt; unwanted lore. 
---
You take that back!
---
I think I will lol. Thanks for the idea and encouragement 
---
We will watch your career with great interest.
---
Sometimes. OP makes it sound like it has increased, and yeah I've heard about killers wanting the double pip so going for the 4k now.
---
Bingo
---
10/10 Would DC again
---
In all seriousness though, pretty good job so far!
---
What? Did you step out of your SWF safespace?
---
It better because I'm livid right now.
---
That looks very alike though.
---
Honestly I'd take Wraith, Clown and Freddy over Pig anyday 
---
Wraith is strong if you use add ons for running speed and uncloak speed. Like surprisingly strong. Without those though then yeah he's a bit shit.
---
Clown again with the right add ons I'd take him over Pig as hes far better at anti-loop. Just need the ones that slow them down more.
---
Freddy can juggle a few by putting them to sleep to slow them down. Discordance is great on him. Benefits from the range add ons.
---
I'd take Pig over legion though. Also feel Doctor is quite shit. Trapper too unless you play campy with a basement build then he's strong.
---
I just don't find farming games fun. Let me play the game I queued up to play.
---
Not messaging the 4 survivors to ask for help with the achievement
---
That is true i suppose. My thing is legion usually doesnt catch me even though he is more than capable of i won't deny that. My experiences with him haven't been that bad unless you count camping. Besides the doctors madness those tiny skill checks really just get on my nerves id rather go against a non camping legion. Its not really my playstyle to get into a lot of chases i just sneak and do gens and hope for the best. 
---
Any must have perks for alturism playstyles?
---
I'm a newer player and as a killer, I can quickly tell when I'm against survivors with hundred or thousands more hours than me.  
---
In these games I can barely get a few hits. In the meantime, 2-3 gens have been done and I start panicking.   
---
I try to not focus the better survivors and if I see that I can't catch a survivor after say 30 seconds chase, I try to find someone else. Unfortuntaly these games end up with me not getting a single kill, and I'm lucky if I hook one - who will quickly get unhooked anyway because body block, flashlights and a bunch of other tricks I don't have a lot of experience with yet.
---
What's the best way to deal with these games? Is it just practice? Is there a "strategy"? I main doctor because I find him easy and helps me find survivors. I know he isn't good but I'm around rank 13 and I feel like I need a lot more experience before playing nurse or spirit .
---
Yea this is bullshit i lost many cakes becouse of that
---
... So... Who hurt you?
---
_Hex: Haunted Grounds_
---
No worries, I'd be sad if my 20% charge medkit didn't make it out alive.
---
 I'm watching your character to the end of match, rooting for a basic item to live, whilst continually reassuring myself that Franklin's Demise is so meta, I just HAD to run Self-Care with a medkit.
---
It‚Äôs because balancing and changing a game like dead by daylight needs to be well executed and takes time (many games are in the same position)
---
Lol no
---
To be fair if you are a killer who has a shit connection and you are still playing killer you deserve the hate coming for you. It kills the fun for everybody to just tp around the map. 
---
I would be too. Try contacting Sony too. I'm guessing when you paid for it they sent an email saying thank you for your purchase. It gives a confirmation number that they probably will ask for. 
---
Tbf that's the only option you have besides eating it. Just like cleansing all totems. Is it a viable solution? Hell no. But is the only other solution.
---
I just want to imagine OP found this random shrine of skulls in someone‚Äôs backyard.
---
No, that would make it too easy. Try to use skill and memorize which ones you saboed.
---
2.7.0?
---
They reverted the change to further improve the system before they fully roll out the matchmaking update. A better explaination is on the BHVR twitter.
---
Can‚Äôt agree more
---
I love you 
---
Not at all. It means rank boosted, as in they‚Äôre playing awful for the rank they‚Äôre at, implying someone ‚Äòboosted‚Äô them up to there (though likely they either got lucky, it‚Äôs easy to rank up, or they‚Äôre just having the worst game of their life).
---
Lmao that gotta be the weirdest brag Ive seen.
---
I‚Äôm just tired of the crying posts about how ranking system is broken and should be changed to the original one 
---
Tru3 is terrible, problem solved
---
I believe you have to do the gen, no?
---
^^I get the reference
---
As crutch as it is, it‚Äôs still quite necessary until the devs add the secondary end game objective.
---
I stan a lewd queen. 
---
Wheres the total teabags done?
---
I'd never heard of her before but Twitch recommended her and watched her stream the other day  for the first time. I thought she very good in chases, unfortunately I've found her very toxic and a sore loser.
---
No, it's Parry God (left) vs. Sekiro End Boss (right) ü§£
---
Nurse the most difficult? Even baby Nurses on PC rock survivors. Are you playing DBD or the knockoff?
---
The one where you can get stuck in them from slow vaulting, or the removed hag space program cause that bug was amazing.
---
Exactly what I thought when I watched. I don‚Äôt get it. One of the faces of the game and just tells people they are boosted, tunnel, etc..
---
Seems to depend on the build. I use a massive terror radius to keep them screaming and keep the pressure on. probably helps that the skillchecks on console are laggy af so they're tough to hit without madness.
---
*HMMMMMMM*
---
Ew.
---
Try dropping the pallet slightly earlier than you than you think, you aren't you going to be able to stun the killer every time.
---
Kill Rates are mentioned nowhere in the post, unless I've missed something, and the VOD is unavailable.  
---
Sorry, but this source is insufficient.
---
Console he is a lot better since there‚Äôs quite a diluted player pool and I‚Äôve found more people hide than loop. The opposite is true on PC.
---
Fun fact, skill checks are clientside. The only thing making them harder is lack of frames rather than lag.
---
Dead 'ard.
---
Bop, bop!
---
Nice.
---
Nearleh.
---
Bastard.
---
Hm.
---
Was that (insert any perk here)?
---
Fookin' Quentin. 
---
I don't like her as a person, but I watch big streamers, who are good at their gameplay to understand the ranking system. I always try to be good at the game and try to figure out, am I bad atm, if so how or what do I have to improve.
---
She sounds really negative and toxic, but that's the nature of pvp games.
---
I agree there are issues. One issue I have is if the killer sucks and never can hook anyone, I get no altruism points making it hard to double pip.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say there are ‚Äòmust have perks‚Äô - but there are a couple that work really well with altruism. 
---
Borrowed Time can still be extremely useful, especially if it‚Äôs the end game or the Killer has a tendency to always go after the injured survivor. 
---
We‚Äôll make it, brilliant to heal the unhooked survivor in seconds and get them up and going with objectives.
---
Autodiadact is amazing once you‚Äôve gotten stacks. Allowing for insane healing skill checks. 
---
But make sure you stil bring an exhaustion perk, no point in being altruistic if you aren‚Äôt survivable. Otherwise everyone else will be saving you! 
---
I feel like this would just contribute to the shit talking and saltiness end game 
---
Crotus Prenn, Ironworks Window, the *outrageous* barn window on Coldwind? Usually every map has a very good pseudo-infinite towards the middle of the map. Wrecker's Yard is a good example of one that doesn't. 
---
Send a support ticket, for me they gave 600k BP for a mini-reset within 24h of sending a ticket, if they don't help you then it's a bit fucked tho
---
The problem is a Float won't go that high.
---
That sounds like a positional problem on your end. Every flashlight has the ability to blind within 2-3 seconds base. 
---
I second grabbing a mate and practicing on KYF. The best way would be learning when to time flashlight saves during the pickup animation. 
---
On survivor? Do it then and post again to prove us wrong. It is unreasonably difficult to get rank one on survivor as shown by some of the best survivors with thousands of hours in this game unable to do it.
---
I agree it should be difficult to get rank one and it showed be skill based, but the current way they determine pips is just some stupid check list of did you get enough unhooks, gens, and chase points. 
---
Not every game is the same and not every game will even give you the opportunity to earn a pip in the current system. 
---
Yeah that's my issue as well, you shouldn't have to show mercy.
---
In my experiences, at R1, the perk proc once, probably at the start of the.match. It's clearly a OP perk. This perk is actually pretty weak against decent survivors.
---
Maybe I will :/
---
In *your* experience. Not others. 
---
&lt;/3
---
You really hurt me this time, man.
---
Source film maker :) I was making dumb pics on garrys mod before someone told me about this lol I hadn't heard of it until then 
---
I'd say the infinite loading screen is pretty blocking...
---
Of course go ahead :)
---
That's the whole issue. His design is to pretty much ignore all survivors defense options. It may not be OP and it may not be broken but it is not fun to fight against. I pretty much only play killer and now that I think about it I don't think that I  have ever fought Legion. But i cant imagine it being fun when windows and pallets get ignored like 99% of the time. Especially with something like Fank's mix tape.
---
Round
---
I watch a lot of videos on looping and played killer enough to see people do it well im just not good at it. What i am good at is when tucking into a spot when i hear the heart beat and then finishing up gens quick. All i do is bring a tool box and do repairs and do my best to avoid the killer. We dont really have a time limit so as long as people arent getting hooked left and right you really can't waste time. I will admit if the hole team used this playstyle at once we would probably drop like flies but i just haven't found good enough tips to get looping yet. Im only a 100 hours in. 
---
It was so hit and miss for me. Had four lobbies in a row where myself or one of my SWF teammates got the infinite loading screen trying to join a lobby
---
On swamp of all maps too. Bravo 
---
Wow literally rare items x4 is more than a rare item x1 WOW. Bring up a legitimate point  
---
I haven't complained one bit. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend Mori's bring any uniqueness to the game, get real.
---
Never thought I'd see Don't Starve in this subreddit
---
Play with your food, survilians, Tenacity, dot remeber the last one
---
Yeah I can imagine on survivor sometime you don't get the chance to pip because other survivors do all the gens while you gets chased and hooked and you lose out on points from being altruistic and objectives. As killer it seems like just don't tunnel and you will at least black pip so you will eventually move up
---
So if they use the pallet early it's a misuse and you make sure they die  
---
But if they use it too late they are camping it so you make sure they die  
---
Doesn't that just mean that anyone who uses the god pallet gets killed?  
---
I was a killer main up till recently. It's because of my killer expecience that I know how killers think and this helps me a lot with successfully looping. It also helps that I pretty much play every killer equally (Nurse and Legion not included, screw those guys)
---
Personally its not that useful to me. You see, the survivors mostly spawn on the gens that are the furthest away from you. So i go to the gens the furthest away from me and if they been worked on, i know that survivors are nearby. However with that perk, survivors first need to go to the other side of the map where i came from, and i have to go back from where i was already. then most of the time is over, time and a perk wasted.
---
I don't think you know what misuse means...
---
Misuse means throw it down when you don't need to.
---
Camp means to sit at it without even looping the shack.
---
Misusing is blatant ignorance, so not as bad.
---
Camping the god-pallet to me is the exact same thing as sandbagging or bodyblocking a teammate, blatantly putting your team at a disadvantage, intentionally done it's griefing, out of ignorance still a bad thing.
---
Dead by daylights map generation means that bar the main building each tile can spawn a variety of different structures for each map.
---
This makes each game slightly different.
---
Thank you for telling me that! Its not as bad as I thought I suppose.
---
*furious unzipping*
---
So Tru says it is trash but he‚Äôs been running it on Plague? Lol okay. No, I will not admit anything because you are not right. It‚Äôs just your opinion. Accept that and go away. Take a hint. Stop replying to a thread nearly a month old. 
---
Killing the obsession cause you have Dying Light isn't tunneling. When you have DY the obsession becomes a high priority target. 
---
you can escape the corrupt by not cleansing.
---
They reverted the change to matchmaking what more do you want lol
---
Freddy main? I salute you sir! And again... i dont care about this conversation anymore, I have other things to do...
---
i don‚Äôt feel bad for killers anymore, all the toxic pricks that camp/tunnel/use op addons every game have ruined that for me.
---
&gt;I stopped playing her because the game was too easy
---
Yeeaahhh that's a lie. 
---
[removed]
---
And these panties are no longer dry.
---
How and when was photoshop considered cosplay?
---
What‚Äôs wrong with more A+ tier killers??? 
---
Why can nurse and billy be the ONLY ones?  
---
You wont see him coming 
---
Its a tile, you can even see it if you're lucky at Huntress' map. 
---
*You‚Äôre
---
FunGoose is nuts
---
i feel so old right now
---
I had 1-5 min queue times at red ranks with the new system, now back to the old system i'm waiting 20-30 min for a game on PC.
---
Im with dashedspring on this one, you sound like an entitled noob. Why is it that all the players crying about pipping are the ones that were low-middle ranks before the changes anyway. Stop crying about the game now demanding you learning how to play it on a holistic basis. Why does every player base spam reddit threads until the game becomes noob friendly to cater to their inability to play it in the first place. Now your making a thread whining about achievements being hard??? your the type of person that joins neighborhood watch you parasite.
---
Don't give up after 30 seconds. Sometimes I get looped for 2 full generators but in the end still catch him or her! You'll learn the tricks they pull on you and find a pattern. Go with it for a while and then suddenly change. If you get looped at a window+pallet, and the survivor goes left every time, anticipate on this and let them fall into your hands.
---
Should get more of a bonus imo
---
Especially if they dc before you even get to hook them once... like a full 3 hooks worth of points for that person 
---
That would be abused hard by a lot of SWF groups.
---
\*Draws penis on heat-map\*
---
Wait, so you need to do gens for the hatch to actually spawn? 
---
"Not gonna waste my time disabling this trap, he might even have a bloody coil, this claudette will have to take the hit instear"
---
Prayer beads Spirit is best in slot.
---
U wot m8
---
You don't lose items, though. Nor do you lose the add-ons.  
---
The fact that we'll de-pip from the killer DC'ing is bullshit, though, even if rank doesn't actually matter.  
---
It used to not depip us, but with the new pip requirements, it's pure BS.
---
I've got a lot of keys stacked up and am planning to spend a night tryong to get the achievment in SWF
---
It is a character that does not punish you if you are really bad as a killer, but instead punishes the survivors even if they are decent.
---
Your on lvl 10 gtfo
---
What "million counters" mean to you exactly? Because it's only counter is destroying all the totems which is a difficult thing to do if you are playing with random people.
---
With the new system.. anyone who can remain rank 1 deserves my respect
---
Friend's first match: 
---
Friend: "Haha wow getting off the hook is really fast"
---
Me: "wait NO"
---
Yeah, I had been playing Myers with blood warden and rancor, and hooked a survivor to get BW active after the gates were opened. Walked into one gate area, rancor killed the obsession, went after the unhooked survivor as they ran to the other gate, downed them, got DS'd, and then caught back up  at the other gate still blocked by BW, and Rancor killed them too. It was honestly hilarious, and I ended the game with 3k and 1 escape. 
---
&gt;itd mainly a problem that he can vault andrzej stan you loads of times well that is just op not broken it is just like doctor can stop pallet loops
---
I can tell you're an intelligent individual
---
You realize no one speaks Japanese here right?
---
When you're playing Nurse you're not really playing Dead by Daylight.
---
T5 Claudette is looking pretty good so far
---
meg‚Äôs not ugly but she seems like it because of her facial expression :(
---
Since when do guys wear panties
---
Yes but she has fatigue after she misses. Legion gets zero punishment for missing or getting outplayed. The cool down is barely an inconvenience
---
Nice hat
---
Man sherlock you mean when MLGA and ingame tell me 60 and once loading is over its 400 because they disabled their VPN that will help?
---
yep everybody uses vpns just to not get dodged
---
Trapper/Hag/Myers. Those killers that require me to be...patient and strategic. I'm that hag who draws all over the floor and walls of the basement.
---
yep
---
Since sissies became widespread. No pun intended. Or maybe it was. You'll never know.
---
Velocidad de raptor, evidently omg 
---
...
---
what exactly was it that was so bright lol?
---
WTF man ? I was taking about BBQ here, not about NOED. Next time, read my thread more careful.
---
" if I do not get my cell packs or get a refund I will take this to a level I do not want to go to. All I want is what I paid for. " you sound like a fucking school shooter. get a grip you entitled freak. I mean i was going to make a post addressing how dysfunctional you are on a fundamental level, but on second thought can you give me a line to your parents? that might be a better solution Jesus Christ. Read your last line back to yourself and if your not red with embarrassment maybe aspirin and a pocket knife.
---
White Noise 2 was like a gateway for me to get into DbD and after game stats are actually the only thing I miss
---
Crying
---
Well, what counters are there for BBQ? You still didn't answer. Also elaborate on why Nurse Billy and Spirit are strongest with it? - is that to do with being able to make up distance fast?
---
You need to do all 5 gens with 4 people alive for the hatch to spawn.
---
Not going to lie, even if I play killer more than survivor. A chainsaw item would be hilarious 
---
Maybe just one time use item that stuns a killer and is super rare to find only in a trial
---
&gt;not impossible to pip at high ranks. 
---
Lmao you're rank 10 how would you possibly know?
---
What is immersed?
---
It‚Äôs sad that you get disliked by rank 15 killers who use noed for a living because you said that tru3 is not good. He isn‚Äôt good! He‚Äôs a sore loser with a gigantic ego, he‚Äôs who you‚Äôre supposed to watch when you first start out and want to learn the basics.
---
But after a month of grinding this game, I realized this guy isn‚Äôt actually a god at this game.
---
Zubat, scott, fungoose, and maybe Jen are the best streamers playing this game currently (Jendenise being only godlike as survivor, and shit at killer)
---
Zubatlel is the best of the best, literally a god on both sides
---
Scott is the best guy to watch to learn how to play killer and also have a good laugh
---
Fungoose is the guy you watch to become a calculative machine that doesn‚Äôt make any mistakes.
---
Oh hi internet troll
---
The thing with Iridescent Button and Frenzy is hitting a Deep Wounds survivor a second time will end your Frenzy. Your terror radius will return to normal, and even if you Frenzy AGAIN, you'd have to hit a totally different survivor and hit the original survivor to apply Infection Fright across the map.
---
I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just highly unlikely that's gonna happen.
---
Mm Drake Parker, that‚Äôs a good meme. 
---
I like this detail, because the killer is like: Where did they go? Hence the name of the achievment.
---
Hey dont judge till you try it.
---
The consequences will never be the same! 
---
Neither was Ruin, considering how often it‚Äôs found at the beginning. Does that make Ruin bad? Hell no. 
---
don‚Äôt watch ochido thanks
---
Because the game doesnt save deranks anymore.
---
Theres no debats, shes admitted tonpurposefully deranking on stream before
---
No one needs ruin. Change my mind.
---
Zubat has a far bigger ego than tru3. His personality and his fans are so off-putting.
---
Its basically "How great am I? üòé" "Oh you're sooo good daddy zubat üòç"
---
This is nothing new.
---
It has been my Tier 1 look since years. 
---
Thank you 
---
Its probably be a little while since its "random". I haven't even seen Discordance yet.
---
Yeah. Well I hardly play anymore id just like infectious fright for Myers that‚Äôs it really 
---
The achievement is fucky, it seems.
---
I got a PM from the leader of a random set of survivors asking if I could let them get it. I said sure, let them do the gens, and escape through the hatch with the key.
---
They then told me none of them got the achievement.
---
I said 'Aw, I'm sorry. gg anyway!'.
---
I didn't have the heart to tell them I got the achievement instead. 
---
Imagine each map as being a big grid, like a jigsaw puzzle. The big buildings, shack, and other static landmarks have set places in the grid that they'll always go, but the remaining spaces will be filled in randomly with tiles from the map's theme. The locker tile you're talking about is one of the Red Forest random tiles, so it could be randomly placed in any empty space on the grid, or it might not even be placed at all.
---
Increases your movement speed while transporting bodies by 6/12/18 %. While transporting a body, your Terror Radius is increased by 12 metres.
---
Here‚Äòs the english text from the wiki in case you need it. :)
---
People overrate it too much
---
Need more simpsons dbd memes. Lots of potential 
---
My favourite is when the pallet dropper pipes up after you've killed them talking about how long you chased them for, and they just can't seem to understand that they actually screwed everyone over 
---
Wow, I feel like everyone here is overreacting a bit here. No, the will not be banned for that, and while the add ons you were using were strong and not fun to play against, dcing should honestly carry more punishment, even if they could let themselves die, which is fine.
---
No I quite like that mechanic. I also like that you lose your item and add-ons that you brought. /s
---
Oh
---
It CAN be. Any perk is bad if the survivors play against it. Ruin Totem found? Useless. They magically did all totems? Bye bye NOED. Jane running that healing perk? Sloppy Butcher nerf. 
---
Because bamboozling in apex is used as a more effective term than in dbd
---
I don't know what happened but it feels like all the good players left. The survivors I get put with all go down in 5 seconds to low tier killers. There used to be a mumber of decent players who could evade for longer.
---
On the plus side toxicity seems way down.
---
Perhaps these are related. Those toxic tbagging DS users? They've gone. Which is good for reducing toxicitiy but bad that it seems a lot of the survivors we have left can't loop the killer for shit.
---
On top of that you've got Ruin in 95% of games. I get why killers take it but fucking hell this is dull. It used to be you wouldnt see it every game until red ranks. That was fine because you had the games leading up to rank 1 where it wasn't there. Now it seems to be there all the fucking way every day. Its just boring.
---
Plus I'm rank 8 at the moment. Used to be a decent rank where the game started being fun as you got away from the noob trappers that tunnel.
---
Now however almost every game I play is Hillbilly. Hillbilly with Ruin, and often Noed. That's it. It's so boring. I want to derank so bad so I can have some variety. But a few levels down from there and its the tunneling trappers and camping wraiths again.
---
In short I've completely given up on survivor. It's not fun as atll and everygame is likely to be the same killer with the samee perks and the same tactics.
---
As for killer - it hasn't been hit as hard but some games are so easy and braindead now that it takes the fun out of it.
---
The main problem is cleansing. People just rush to cleanse the second they get sick, just to get on a gen and get sick again. If you‚Äôre broken and don‚Äôt give her the corrupt purge, you can continue to do gens and she is as easily looped as any other killer. Play smarter not harder. 
---
Shelter woods. It's an old map and I was talking about new maps but ok. But even that isn't the worst since it's dark that killers can't spot you a mile away (Claudette is invisible in some spots) and you can momentarily break los/chainsaw Sprint with trees but yeah it's not great. 
---
Hiding is preferable to running in circles, but what I was talking about was losing a chase. This game is at it's worst when you know based on the map you're never going to lose the killer if they find you. Having a chance to shake them is what makes the game come alive. 
---
Why do people keep bringing this up? I can't think of anyone that puts out April Fools things weeks in advance. It just sounds so stupid.
---
I didn‚Äôt say zubat doesn‚Äôt have an ego, he does, but he‚Äôs was better than tru3ta1ent, and doesn‚Äôt brag or complain about anything (except for poor game designs and bugs) If he loses (which never happens) he will get salty.
---
No, I like the challenge of finding the last person lol.
---
Yea I'm not saying it can't be used wrong. Trust me I know how bad it can be. I'm saying as long as your a half decent survivor and know when you should self-care and when to not heal and go do a gen, it's still good then. I've been using Botany Knowledge, Self-Care, Balanced Landing, and Jane's new perk Solidarity since the update came out. Botany Knowledge, Self-Care, and Solidarity are a MONSTROUS combo.
---
Chill the fuck out tru3ta1ent this game is for fun remember 
---
Your reply shows that you are a very cold hearted, miserable human being with zero sympathy for anyone. Do not insult people that you do not know because YOU‚ÄôRE going through your own stuff and want to make people feel bad. How did this one persons post offend you and get to you so bad that you had to reply with such hate?   I hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for and find happiness. 
---
What makes you think this?
---
Playstyle that focusses on not being seen by the killer instead of getting in and out of chases. Immersed players often run perks like urban evasion, iron will or lightweight
---
Has a bit of a negative connotation because immersed players may spent more time crouching on the edge of the map where it's of course safer than doing generators or helping their teammates
---
No, ranking up and getting to the highest rank should be hard. If you think green ranks are hard wait till you get up, it gets a lot harder in red.
---
mclean said on one of his streams that‚Äôs what is causing the BS hits. that‚Äôs how i know this.
---
That works pretty good with nurse ;)
---
Ah, okay. So the survivors that always leave the match when I get a mori on em. üòÇ
---
Also running in one direction directly after someone gets hooked, then changing directions when BBQ is gone.
---
Nurse Billy and Spirit are the only ones actually capable of capitalizing on BBQ because everyone else takes too long to travel the 40 metres, so survivors can often already be on the other end of the map
---
Yeah I completely agree. I try to only play survivor when I have at least one friend in the lobby because everyone else at best can only do gens and not much else. I haven‚Äôt been a high rank in a while but even still I find myself going against ruin most games and it gets stale. I definitely haven‚Äôt been struggling as much with killer and I have at least gone up one or two ranks in minimal play time since the update.
---
Because all it takes is one person to fuck up and the killer gets to snowball. Unless you are in a 4 person swf, saying "there are counters" only goes so far when your teammates make it so you can't escape.
---
They can't fully remove it since killer will have latency so they have tune the killer mechanics to function, which will still lead to weird hits sometimes.
---
Dr. Freddy M.D., made you a nice fake dream world pallet. It was never there. 
---
Let the circlejerk commence
---
If I was that killer, and you didn't save that survivor, I'd just feel bad for the survivor that didn't get saved, might drop them at the exit even. Pity kills are the worst. If I didn't earn it, the free kill isn't anything but a confirmation that I failed.
---
Yeah, I've been randomly dropping from games too. Also noticed 2-3 bots in the last couple of days. Prior to this, I haven't seen a bot in at least 6 months.
---
The message I scribbled over was a message I was supposed to send to my friend but accidentally sent to him (irrelevant to the convo)
---
Ever since the new patch you can no clip onto everyone it‚Äôs weird. 
---
Like I said I‚Äôve been from ranks 2-4 last summer. I get that. However, recently and especially since the update, I feel like every random survivor has been completely garbage. Maybe in that way green ranks become more difficult. I agree that ranking shouldn‚Äôt be easy but I still think that the game should provide an incentive. Otherwise, many high rank people looking for lest frustrating matches will drop down to dominate new or unskilled players.
---
Billy and Nurse, by far.
---
Damn, imagine his dick in this form......
---
op you‚Äôre into some freaky shit
---
Lmao exactly small game is fine as is. If the perk lighting up and an audio que isn‚Äôt enough for you to find them I don‚Äôt think you ever will 
---
Is the player's name in the last message? Cause I see you tried to protect its identity above but there is visible :)
---
Is that what you took away from my comment? Maybe go back, reread, and actually think before typing again.
---
Wait do the characters die?
---
I once saw a Laurie who dropped the god pallet when the Huntress wasn't even chasing her. All of us were doing the gen in the killer shack together and Huntress came. Laurie dropped it as Huntress landed a hit on Tapp.
---
The fact that people think I‚Äôm serious saddens me. 2 dislikes for a joke, congratz
---
&gt; I have been playing against top competition
---
Rank never was skilled, it was always just about how much you played, and now it is just kinda luck based.
---
Put your messages on friends only, fuck those losers 
---
Mine was probably something akin to that. I had been playing for some time before I ran into a Myers and when I saw him stare at me i was like, about 75% through a gen and was like "screw it just commit" and then the theme played and man it terrified me
---
Train time
---
Doing objective is for the baby survivor?
---
Alright then, chasing, wounding and hooking survivors is for the baby killer.
---
Thanks for finally posting something that shows killers too are often just as toxic as survivors.
---
Not sure about the items but you deffinitly lose your offering, iI have had this happen to me many times already.
---
So you blew up because I said I want what I paid for? Ok Mr Stable, as if you would not be upset if you spent money on something and got nothing for the money you spent. Dude that would make anyone mad. If you don't like what I said then too bad.
---
I completely agree. At least when it was based on play time, the people who played a lot would be generally better. However, now you have to play a lot and get generally lucky just to pip and slowly make your way up
---
Bring us that end game rework that was talked about ages ago. Freddy rework too, hopefully they go together.
---
Punish DCs better, put a wait time on searching for a new game after dcing.
---
It's honestly fine I had a great experience with a survivor. You know what he said to me? "YOU'RE ONLY A LEVEL 1 HAG? YOU WRECKED US GG". I was so happy to hear this and complimented the survivor back. I did let then escape via exit gate because I felt bad after placing 4 runes on the switch :)
---
wait, my flair is Dwight?
---
I'm not so sure about this. In a game full of potatos, yeah sure they're screwed. But one very long chase at the beginning because the potatovivor is dropping all the pallets on you, and 3 generators may be done or close to done by the time you get the hook. Then you're very behind - only 2 gens left and 1 hook.
---
It's just sacrificing the ease of the late-game for a strong early-game. If the survivors end up not needing to run much from you because there isn't a lot of time left in the match, the killer is screwed.

---
It‚Äôs unbelievable isn‚Äôt it? The game it‚Äôs self is not hard to master yet theres so many egos floating about. 
---
They usually have deeper issues, ignore them. 
---
Patrolling means I was hunting for the nearby survivor. Camping would imply I was there it stop the hooked man getting revived. I personally wouldn't class going to the hook every 30 seconds as camping. Oh I wrote 10 my bad.
---
I don't see why the most nerfed killer in the game needs even more nerfs. 
---
Fun to see some add-on suggestions though, even if most are boring. 
---
Also a god pallet is any pallet that you HAVE to break if you want to keep chaising that survivor, like the cow tree pallet, some of the possible pallets inside the school in freddy's map ecc...
---
He dies so PRETTY GOOD JOB, SO FAR! this sand bagging shits must return the hell where they come
---
?
---
So that we can even make the  toxic salty nobody that flames you even more mad ? You cruel evil genius ! 
---
Or whenever you click on Bloody Party Streamers icon the tab just closes.
---
Might aswell.
---
You work for them or something? 
---
I've already read it and yes I agree with what he said. I'm just ranting for a bit. I'll try to stay positive in the future. :)
---
Typical rank 20 killer. Have fun with that when you start facing real survivors.
---
*looks at downvotes*
---
‚ÄúThey hated him because he spoke the truth‚Äù
---
Still not shirtless, there must be more forms
---
Good players left becouse they got bored of the game becouse its pretty trash for  survivors and way too easy for killers. And the most important thing no rewards for ranking up besides long as fuck queues and 300 ping games. 
---
Kind of with a perk (Thrill of the Hunt shows how many totems are up), but IIRC it doesn't say where dull totems are destroyed, just that they are.
---
&gt;Patrolling means I was ~~hunting for the nearby survivor.~~ proxy camping. Camping would imply I was there it stop the hooked man getting revived. I personally wouldn't class going to the hook every 30 seconds as camping. Oh I wrote 10 my bad.
---
Yea you're camping. It's ok you're new so you don't know any better. You'll learn one day
---
Cock Destroyers!
---
nsfw tag?
---
Oh okay I always thought it was differentiated by intent? Kinda like a wink versus a blink. I only patrolled the area to kill the survivor nearby. If no one is nearby I run across the map destroying gens.
---
all the hair since spirit is fucked up, i'm hoping soon they will revamp character models and fix janky cosmetics that once were good and now feel like wasted money. 
---
I never thought I'd be happy to see surveillance on the shrine
---
Oh my list can go on and oooon
---
Survivors should be able to hug the wall, to hide.
---
punish dc's with longer match making waiting times and less bloodpoints
---
Using the god pallet inefficiently isn't the same as sandbagging . Bye.
---
Yeah, they could do that.
---
I made a really long comment but my college Wi-Fi went crazy. Long story short... Thanks.
---
ARCHIMEDES?
---
Don‚Äôt Starve isn‚Äôt the only successfully managed game Klei created. ONI is another wonderful example
---
It's the same reach as any other killer besides nurse , huntress, or legion. 
---
What were PC players experiencing?
---
I like Jane's perks, the locker one especially, also first latina survivor baby!
---
I am a killer main though, so I'd pick Plague first. Yesterday I body blocked a Quentin in a corner and just puked for a while
---
And then he teabags as Myers stalks him
---
I usually play a match or two before work 
---
He‚Äôs not trolling, he phrased it rather mean, but I too was worried about how you were addressing this. 
---
The reason cosmetics are blocked is so that, for good reason, they don't start adding random cosmetics that make him look un-freddylike. And it messes with the franchise.
---
However that doesn't mean to say that they can't release a licensed cosmetic that is actually in line with the characters story and franchise. Your negativity is unnecessary. Sure it might take some time - but this is the only route they can take if they do want to introduce cosmetics for licensed killers.
---
It would also be a win-win because they would make more money. The licesning rules are there to stop abuse and obvious reasons, not because the owners of the license are really tight and stubborn.
---
The guys that do patches and optimization are a different team to the guys who do new content
---
That's horrifying
---
Did you uncap your fps? Otherwise its locked at 60
---
From what I can tell, they were facing Ps4's queue problems with ranks being all over the place and poor queue times. Hopefully Behaviour can adjust it for everyone I believe they can.
---
I'm sorry for you 8( and no problem
---
I would say yes you can. Phase shifting is an attribute of the Spirit herself, not of her terror radius. If anything Dark Devotion would be a hinderance to the Spirit because you don't hear the phase shifting sound while you're within her terror radius so if she's chasing you and phases, you'll be able to hear her if the perk is active as you're technically not in her terror radius.  
---
I think this might need to be tested.
---
People that think Dead Hard is a bad perk are simply wrong. Objectively speaking, it gives your survivor temporary invincibility. What other perk does that? Its extremely versatile and thats where its stenght lies. It gives you an out in situations you wouldnt otherwise have. 
---
Survivor auto wins every single hatch standoff. Stalemate until killer hits then survivor wins. There is no way for the killer to win unless the survivor is downright special. So don‚Äôt complain if the killer does their best to draw it out. 
---
On the same note, could you explain how rights pertaining to modding work? I've seen iron Man mods in gta so can marvel sue those modders for using their asset? 
---
Just for the record...
---
https://youtu.be/RkvHEqsHrTs
---
There is another example of her admitting to disconnecting to derank. Dont buy her lies though, she plays victim when people call her out but is toxic to others in the first place.
---
To this day I don't understand what people have against Legion. As someone who loves playing Legion it's super confusing...  
---
I see post that are either stating Legion is weak and gets nothing done, or posts stating he's so OP it's unfun (which is why people disconnect).
---
Actually, he's right. The God Pallet should only be used once the gates are powered. If a survivor uses it at 5 gens, and I see this a lot when I play killer and solo survivor, I won't save them and if I'm the killer I face camp them. Wasting shack pallet should be a soft ban for a few days since it's basically working with the killer. 
---
Sorry I think I was actually referring to co*caine*  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
Beyond mean. He started talking a ridiculous amount of crap. As I said all I want is what i paid for it don't have to turn into anything serious.
---
Can't tell if you're trolling.
---
As a survivor main , nurse Billy and spirit tunnel the most it's like ridiculous , than every other killer tunnels because it's a new strait smh PS4 user , add that with the ridiculous survivor pip system and ridiculous killer connection , pretty much play at your own risk 
---
Your mic is scarier than the bug,
---
TBF it has a token on it so you could use it as a discount bond. 
---
Thanks for the help too bad it would be really good for yoinks if so
---
Fun Fact: One day I was playin Wraith and had to leave the pc, but i didnt leave the game. When I came back, I had it
---
This is a problem, Behaviour.
---
You need to revert the pip requirements or do an early rank reset.
---
You should have done one when the new system was implemented.
---
Now red ranks with no games until the 13th of April.
---
Yep sounds like r/deadbydaylight to me
---
Oh hell yea the abattoir "Matt Walker-window" is the greatest (pretty good) job they have done (so far)
---
Okay sorry u don‚Äôt like him I watch his video because he is good at the game he‚Äôs not my ‚Äúleader‚Äù I watch a bunch of youtubers 
---
This hasn‚Äôt been posted 1000 times already nice find
---
Wow that is odd, you actually loaded in.
---
It was too easy to pip up, and now they've fucked it. 
---
Ok you've convinced me, your assessment of my play style is absolutely spot on - I'm nothing but a monster in human form üòÇ
---
From now on I will only play in a way that makes it fun for survivors.
---
I hereby promise I will never 4k again.
---
I constantly try to explain the principles of looping and wasting pallets to my friend and he simply doesn't get it. He wastes to fucking things before the killer even comes close to hitting bloodlust
---
he isn‚Äôt that good at the game if he plays rank 20 all the time, plus you‚Äôre choosing to ignore the fact that someone manipulates children for their own sexual desires just because you think they‚Äôre good at a video game, that‚Äôs pretty nasty tbh.

---
Well, balance Landing gives you infinite loop !
---
If you play the game long enough you will understand the value of shack pallet. 
---
Mostly because there's no counterplay against Legion so its really boring - I get that most chases are just run until you're eventually caught but its worse against Legion because the only things there to help you last longer/escape are negated. Also deep wounds is annoying.
---
Look I didn‚Äôt known that so if you wanna explain cool
---
I didnt say balanced landing is bad...
---
My wait times also shortend by a lot, its almost instant
---
In order to use head on, you need to hold the sprint button when you press the exit button. And grabbing survivors: you need to get very close, and then attack, but you have to tap the trigger and not lunge. As long as your close and attack you should be able to grab.
---
I don't, no. But she's probably in the most balanced spot she has ever been in. Her add-ons needs a look-over because they're outdated as fuck but herself.. she's fine.
---
Hey you know I don‚Äôt often say that Legion needs a nerf or not but the fact that I read your post in a stuttering 5 year old kinda speaks for itself no?
---
Made my morning, thanks OP. Michael Myers is Daddy indeed 
---
Oh ok. How I read your original comment made it sound like it was bad that Nurse was nerfed so much she doesn‚Äôt need more. 
---
Man, you do realise I got a 4k this game, right? 
---
Also, check the descriptions of achievements on Steam. It literally says "get a merciless victory".
---
Makes it incredibly easy to down people by allowing you to down someone in 1 less hit (usually it takes 4 hits total, with Frank's mixtape you hit, hit again, fatigue, frenzy and hit once more and they're down). A lot of people hate the Legion, but everyone hates the Legion when they use mixtape.
---
Well whatever you're saying, I'm not coming out.
---
I don‚Äôt know who would want the unnecessary queue time for killers back lmao
---
r/dadbydaylight is looking pretty small, I bet you guys can liven it up
---
And that's good. Actually the should go from queue directly to the loadscreen. The lobbies are absolutely useless. As a killer main I wouldn't mind not seeing the survs before the match.
---
However letting the survs see the killer would make it impossible to find a game with some of them. 
---
Double pip requirements go down the lower in rank you are.
---
And again, it's not an issue of skill. It's an issue of having to play the way the scoring system wants you to play. Read my other comments here.
---
True, but this one had a milky glass, so it's a matter of what I'm using the key for.
---
She is likely to be the hardest killer to master (maybe the same difficulty as huntress idk) but that doesn't excuse the fact that the survivors are kinda defenseless when placing against her (if the player is good). 
---
Even having survivors, they will DC anyway. So, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
Lol what.....No one wants to know if you popped a boner dude regardless of what caused it
---
I mean with literally every other killer you're at the whim of the survivors, as you can only benefit off their mistakes so with nurse it's a good turn
---
Theoxf
---
Replying to you feels like a mistake, but here goes: on the off chance that your post was sincere, and not a troll, come back when you're ready to talk like a grown-up.
---
Wait what? ‚ÄúDestroying the enemy team gets you a safety it‚Äôs dumb.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt that the point lol? If I‚Äôve killed all survivors in the Trial I have done my job.
---
Usually EST in the states
---
Used to live in China, so it used to be the opposite timezone lol 
---
Ren and Stimpy &lt;3
---
Killers dodge constantly. They're making the same choice as those survivors who are dcing. People have the freedom to do as they please.
---
I'm glad people are dcing against legion still. You make the choice to play that killer and they make their choice to dc. Dont act surprised after choosing an annoying killer that people dont want to play with you.
---
MY QUEENS!
---
I JUST WHEEZED
---
meme
---
He literally called him a deranged school shooter. Sounds like a troll to me.
---
Evidently everyone according to this sub right now lol
---
Well then don‚Äôt gen rush
---
Espically when playing Bubba, and they drop to a full charge saw. 
---
Okay cool, I was like "I can't be the only one who benefitted from this.." but I guess the majority of the sub is having a different experience 
---
FOR THE LAST TIME. BAJHEERA DOESN‚ÄôT LOOK LIKE FENG MIN.
---
It's true. I just got quite a few entitled Survivors lately.
---
Hats off to the Adam Francis who teabagged me, threw a pebble at me, and then DCed when I downed him. He proceded to call me about 40 different swears and racial slurs in the post game chat.
---
His profile icon was that one [Polish Jerry meme](https://i.imgflip.com/2ko532.jpg) so that tells you the kind of guy that he was.
---
I absolutely love STBFL on Freddy, it's so strong it has saved me a few games
---
IIRC TotH gives a visual cue when a hex totem is being cleansed along with an audio cue, dull totems only give a small audio chime with no visual cue
---
I completely agree that finding and killing the obsession right off the bat with dying light is the correct tactical decision. What I'm attempting to do is minimize the fact that it can ENCOURAGE tunneling. Most killers will go after only the obsession, never even blinking at other players until the obsession is dead. 
---
This playstyle of running one survivor into the ground as quickly as possible with dying light is, sadly, the correct tactical decision when you have dying light, and I would never blame someone for doing what is tactically sound in a competitive game. I get it,  there's no point in playing if you aren't trying to win and have fun. But my issue with the perk from the survivors standpoint is that it can completely strip away those aspects of trying to win and have fun away from the survivor unwillingly just because some else is running a perk that you didn't chose. 
---
That being said, I'll say again that this is not a criticism of tunneling, people who tunnel/don't tunnel, or if running Dying Light and killing the obsession right away should be considered tunneling. I simply have an issue with the core design of this perk and I'm offering a fix. Nothing more. 
---
I like it. I don't have any issues with it
---
I don't compare camping to playing against SWF. I agree that it isn't fun but it's more the fault of the devs than the players. If the strategy works you'll take it: I have to admit that I proxy (or even outright camp) sometimes against overly altruistic teams.
---
It's not even a fire mixtape, it's just makes you wish they could kill you faster.
---
Might have been a conscious choice by BHVR to get better framerates, then.
---
I play killer and survivor but as survivor it was so much quicker. Especially if I played with a friend. Now I'm waiting 20 minutes as SWF and were only rank 9. Then there's the disconects ect.
---
As killer I don't mind waiting a minute longer and be more fair for everyone.
---
Why DCers give Brutality Bloodpoints is beyond me.
---
ist the same if you Kill all 4 very fast, you will lose a pip/dont get one
---
I‚Äôve noticed too probably a bug though 
---
And then there's that one Survivor who drops every pallet in existence the moment they reach it.
---
A proper good morning.
---
I like it, sir. 
---
I like this!
---
The first time I played against her I heard a lot of moaning sounds and for a second I though it was coming from my phone, but no...
---
First of all I'll assume you're not one of those frank's mixtape/moowalking abusers because what's wrong with that is pretty selfexplanatory.
---
Now, if you're just a regular legion player i'll tell you from my point of view what's extremely annoying abut him. He's not OP, I mean, nurse is OP, billy is OP, spirit is OP. Legion is just unfun. Why is that? Because of the chase mechanic. You can't loop him, you can't window vault/pallet vault him. A half decent legion will just frenzy when it's necessary and keep chasing you until he four hits and downs you, and that's all. There's no counterplay. Pallets and windows are survivors counterplay and his ability makes them useless. It's kinda the same as nurse (she renders pallets and windows useless aswell) but she at least requires skill.
---
 So, I enjoy this game when the killer is after me. Being a gen jockey or an inmersive player might be fun for someone else, and don't get me wrong, I do my fair shares of generators, but I get my dose of adrenaline when being chased. With legion there's no fun. If he wants me he'll get me, and it will take him long not because i'm a good looper or I know how to use my windows, but because he'll frenzy four hits me. Yeah, I know you can try to vault again the window you've just vaulted and hope that he loses your track but I feel every legion knows this little trick already.
---
tl;dr: no counterplay + the user playing legion doesn't require any skill to efectively use his ability. 
---
I think you found the crystal from behind the wall from Monster Squad. Use it to banish the killer!
---
No you're not, I got down voted to high hell because I said I was happy they reverted back to this matchmaking. The previous one, it was impossible to find a match on my PS4 and 15-20 minutes on my Xbox. Now, as soon as I start a lobby, it's filled right away, and if someone leaves, he/she is replaced almost instantly.
---
Sorry, missread.
---
Still not know what million counters has BBQ. Run into killer's  direction and getting in a closet are the only I know, and these movements are not exactly counters. What I do is running in a direction for 4 secs and then change it.
---
Yea I think killer is in a good spot. Survivor needs to be tuned imo
---
That's not how a request sounds!
---
Yeah that would of been a huge part of it. Solos in this system get priority. But with the changes before everyone was in the same queue. Hence the waiting now.
---
Also with waiting times being longer for SWF your more likely to go against toxic survivors as they are frustrated waiting for the games. 
---
It is a very difficult challenge to get it to work for everyone though sadly.
---
As I mentioned before, I don't like her as a person, but I don't deny skills either.

Your YT vid is from January and the ranking system was different.
---
I'm talking about the actual system.
---
As far as the corners go, both billy and LF can instantly down you if they body block you, so I honestly never saw that as an issue. Why is it any different for the plague?
---
Either unforced tiered bans or disable blood point awards for x number of games
---
No, as the hag you should place a mine on the hooked survivor and maybe use make your choice to go for the guy who unhooked.
---
Of course hiding is a counter. Barbecue is only active for 4 seconds. 4 seconds of hiding isn't wasting much time for a survivor.
---
Please bring back the classic drake and josh meme

Don‚Äôt forget insidious and fire up

Why are you being so aggressive, even the OP replied to me and wasn‚Äôt a dick unlike some other people who replied to my comment &gt;.&gt;
---
Thanks I dont have make your choice yet but I saw youtuber Bricky use it. It seems amazing.
---
I don't deny that fixing things takes time, and I don't expect new bugs to be fixed the moment they appear. But there are bugs (as well as general gameplay and performance issues) that have been in the game for literal years now and we haven't recieved so much as a "we're working on it" from the devs.
---
Some of the biggest complaints are for things that could be fixed very easily. Latency issues (which will hopefully be fixed with dedicated servers) and perk/Killer reworks take awhile but ranks being meaningless has been complained about since the Clown chapter and nothing has been done. Is it really that hard to add what must be about 2 to 3 lines of code? when "rankReset", if "Rank" = (number) then give "shards" (amount)? I don't know what spaghetti code Behavior works with but to my understanding of coding adding such a small feature like rank rewards really wouldn't take that long.
---
I'm one of the biggest advocates for Behavior and I always reply to complaints about ~~Legion~~ bugs with "Behavior knows it exists and making another 50 thousand threads about it won't fix it faster." But for some of the smallest missing features have been missing for so long that "things take time" no longer becomes a valid excuse.
---
I love the new chapters and this game's lifeblood is new content. The people who say that they'd be fine if they stopped making chapters for 6 months or even 3 months to fix the game instead are dillusional. If Behavior didn't make new chapters a huge portion of the playerbase would lose interest.  
---
But that being said I think people would be happy with a "rework Chapter" instead of flat out new content. A rework of the Nightmare on Elm Street chapter would be great. Freddy is terrible and this is known, his perks are terrible and could use heavy tweaking, and Quentin's perks are all worthless with the exception of Pharmacy which only serves niche use. Freddy and Quentin aren't the only ones who could use a rework update: I'd be happy if they chose to forego a chapter to rework some of the really bad starter perks. (Monsterous Shrine, This Is Not Happening, No One Left Behind, Deja Vu, Slippery Meat)
---
I wish I could give this post Silver because it honestly says a lot that needs to be said. The majority of people bitching about the game not being fixed don't understand that there isn't a magic "fix the game" switch that Behavior can pull. But again: some of the smaller problems that have been around for years really have no excuse for still being around.
---
Yeah so you should pip not safety pip. 
---
He wanted to take the hit I know, but we could‚Äôve all escaped if he bodyblocked the killer instead of me lmao
---
Did you make the level super buggy? Just to complete the feeling
---
I've been wrecking people all morning. 
---
I love when they hide all match, and get caught. 
---
I especifically remember her bm'ing  a huntress for half the game because she couldn't hit her axe. She called her terrible, tbagged her, the usual. The thing is, this huntress ended up killing her and got a 4k. 
---
After the game, the killer said "gg", and jen went on to bm her for her missed axes and how she didn't have any skill at the game.   
---
 Huntress politely reminds her that not only did she died, but she's also playing in a map that strongly favours survivors and against a mid/low tier killer.  
---
This, plus the fact that she was in comms with friends, and had a few ranks over the huntress.   
---
You can hear how she starts making sounds of frustration and types "uninstall" and leaves immediately.   
---
I mean I guess I'd be just as frustrated if someone so "bad" still beat me, but it was very satisfying to watch how karma bit her in the ass.  
---
It would with a killer, rather than ez emblem simulator 2018
---
I see no bias here
---
It wasn't worth reporting tbh. The salt was actually kind of funny. Just a whole lot of "mommy let me play Call of Duty when I was 3 now I'm just like this."
---
Hey look at that this is the funne epic gamer meme westy boi
---
Nurse about to be nurf like the insta blind flashlight he went through lol
---
I actually think it should be the opposite. Reward players who don't disconnect with a bloodpoint buff which stacks up to 10 stacks or so for every consecutive game you don't leave but you lose all stacks if you leave or DC.
---
This way the grind would be reduced by a bit and people would be incentivized to actually finish their games.
---
&gt; wraith, **clown**, **trapper**,  doctor, Leatherface, **Freddy**, and **legion**. **None of the named killers has  an answer to pallet looping or a way to slow down the game** 
---
Excuse me?
---
Legion flat out ignores looping as his power, Clown is the game's anti-loop Killer, and Trapper's traps end loops immediately in a free hook when used correctly.
---
As for slowing down the game, Freddy is the best Killer in the game in that regard when played well.
---
*disconnection sounds*
---
Oh boy this is gonna take long to cleanse ! 
---
Ah... Ouh .... Ah 
---
People cannot handle defeat. 
---
The jaded survivor in me instantly assumed that the Meg was going to try and rat you out but was smacked before she could, but then i watched it again and saw her actual intent of pulling this off :p
---
[ur ugly](https://youtu.be/9ejzqm1KWjg)
---
Does disarming a trap alert the Trapper?
---
Yeah, with the instability of the game, it would suck if someone is having just an unlucky number of crashes, and then gets put in a pool of players who are just dickbags.
---
Yes!
---
Except one was a good perk and the other is still not.
---
Hide as good as you can XD
---
sorry guys, early day at work and i totally blanked on reading the title and just saw the question of who best killer was.
---
sorry about that.
---
I hate it with a passion. I didn't like playing against nothing but low ranks, but at least I could mess around with them and have fun. Now I can't play killer at all. I've been able to play twice in the last two days at rank 1. It's fucking awful.
---
Glad it made you smile. 
---
I just love killers who take some time to fool around a bit. I do that myself when I play killer. It makes me forget BMing, ease survivors' pain if I was too ruthless and what not :)
---
100% agree with you but man noed is neither fun to play against or with and the complain about that are fine.
---
I was playing basement Leatherface the other day and was surprised when I saw the hatch open and then everyone leave.
---
That is the one time I've seen that achievement be done with randoms. :P I'm happy they got the achievement for free from me.
---
Pressing ctrl (crouch/uncrouch ) in front of the killer repeatedly
---
If you've got a good survivor it can be good to chase them until they drop a pallet. If it's a safe pallet just break it and leave the chase, if it's a risky pallet you should be able to get a hit. If it's a good survivor with sprint burst just don't chase them. They'll use their SB as soon as you get near so ignore them unless you find them while they're still exhausted. 
---
Sometimes you just might not have good perks yet. Even as an experienced killer if I use a killer I don't have good perks on like Wraith I'll struggle against good survivors. 
---
Sometimes luck just isn't on your side. Because the maps have an element of RNG in this game sometimes the survivors have better/more pallets and windows to use, don't worry too much about losing games, at the end of the day it is just a game. 
---
I'm not saying it is wasting time, it is just that hiding is a fundamental of everything you do as a survivor. It doesn't counter the perk, it just puts you back to square one - hiding and evading the killer after he knows where you are. Hiding is not going to stop the killer knowing where you are in that 4 seconds. The killer can use that knowledge accordingly - whether to go to a geny, stay by a hook, go looking for you, set traps or whatever. There is no direct coutner because he is always receiving that information.
---
You are saying you can counter the basic killer/ chase relationship by hiding... Sure... That is also dependant on the killer though, and perhaps other perks.
---
The only sensible counter mentioned is distortion.
---
Quick edit: Ace should be S+ tier

"but but I only use her cus I like her!!" - Every hatch camper who picks Claudette so they can easily urban immerse around the edge of the map and not be seen.
---
Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to fix legion with em 
---
It seems like PC enjoys it, console hates it. It was working perfectly on console for me and for a lot of others. It's a bit surprising to see how many console players are actually on the reddit, I thought it was more PC people. 
---
No the system literally helped PS4 survivors and sorta Xbox survivors but completely screwed over everyone else
---
I don‚Äôt like where this is going
---
What do you mean by fix Legion?
---
‚ô™It affects his nutrition~‚ô™
---
It was not on the the tier list maker so i couldn't add her, but if she was there she should be in B since she is THICC
---
Thanks!
---
I apologize for the late response.
---
I have nothing against the Plague, but since I didn't play the PTB I haven't played with her all that much. From what I've seen she is somewhere in either B or C tier.
---
I'm on Xbox 
---
those are the type of people i love to hook
---
Stalking counts as an offensive action so it‚Äôs not that useful for gaining tier 3
---
Generally how well they do, but my bias still shows so that's my bad. 
---

**GOTTA GO FASTER FASTER FIDDIFIDDIFASTER WOW WOW**
---
Nurse is the only killer, that does the same thing surviviors do to other killers. And that‚Äôs why survivior mains cry about her.
---
Hardest killer to learn isn't really saying much. It took me less than 10 matches playing nurse (With max range addons of course because they're broken) to become competent with her. She really isn't that hard to master and all the reasonable nurse mains will attest to this.
---
Claudette is S tier, but players using her are F tier. Meg can also join the potato league. 
---
Dweet Mains are fucking awesome, will do the gens AND distract the killer (whether intentional or not lmao)
---
Yea, devour hope is also great on the hag.
---
Generally the hag is the fourth best killer in the game if played correctly, and I despise going against a good hag because I simply can‚Äôt loop her at all.
---
Quick tip, place your traps in areas with a lot of traffic for example - Killer shack, long hallways, the asylum etc. Where survivors like to be a lot.
---
When you camp you don‚Äôt get to fully learn the game and you won‚Äôt get better, which is why a lot of campers use ‚ÄòNo one escapes death‚Äô because they need that extra help to get at least 1 kill against decent survivors.
---
Anyway if you want to be a good killer:
---
 -Don‚Äôt Use Noed (no one escapes death) because it rewards bad plays and mistakes.
---
-Don‚Äôt camp, just take the L and learn from your mistakes, if you camp because you‚Äôre losing then it just creates a toxic environment and you won‚Äôt learn (I used to be that way) Important: You absolutely SHOULD camp if all the generators are done, you have nowhere to go so ensure you get a kill by camping the hook. (No one can complain about a killer camping when the exit gates are open)
---
-Just patrol the fucking gens, when you hook a survivor go to the nearest gens and check if they‚Äôve been worked on, sometimes you‚Äôll find someone else and then you‚Äôll have huge map pressure and no one will be repairing generators.
---
-Use Bbq and Chilli for the love of god, it‚Äôs the best perk in the game and reduces your chances of losing by at least 60%.
---
I made this long ass comment because I got time right now and enjoy teaching people idk why. Best of luck
---
As far as I've seen, the pip gets returned to you, sometimes it just takes a while
---
It's a little harder though if your Obsession's the only one you can consistently find and the only way to bait the others out is to give 'em hook. 
---
But hiding can hide your aura so the killer doesn't see you at all. If you're close to the killer they won't see your aura. If you're in a locker or use distortion they won't. If you hide behind a generator it is hard for them to see your aura (though still possible). If you run one way while bbq is active then go in a different direction after 4 seconds the killer won't know that. There are plenty of counters and frankly finding survivors isn't the difficult part of the game for killers. I run bbq on my killers for double bloodpoints. If it shows me someone and I can actually get to them before they've left the area or got to a loop it's an added bonus. 
---
How do you feel about deerstalker in its place?
---
Isn't this ranking system amazing? It accounts for so many variables wow!
---
Oh good
---
It takes ages to find lobbies at red ranks as survivor
---
Just an homage. Haha. BUT, if you break the totems, you do curse the match and give the ghost a boost to stats. So, it's kinda like a simplified version of Haunted Ground.  That's about as close to the feeling as you'll sadly get.
---
I only play Claud to flex with my barely rare pink pants B)
---
also keep in mind (and i say this as a person who mainly plays survivor) that survivors can be,,,, kind of testy when they lose
---
i see it a lot when i play with friends; usually the person who dies first is absolutely raging over it even if the killer wasn‚Äôt playing mean, or if their death is their fault
---
this is obviously a pretty common issue with online games where someone has to lose so as long as you‚Äôre not playing in a way that is deliberately scummy, you‚Äôre probably okay! dying just sucks sometimes, especially if you‚Äôve had a few bad matches in a row
---
and since you‚Äôve said you‚Äôre better with spirit than other killers you‚Äôre probably just getting more of the ‚Äúi died and i‚Äôm mad about it‚Äù salt than you did before
---
She might be one of the few (if only) instances in which Unrelenting might be better. I miss with her a lot. 
---
Mathematically, that's incorrect. On a full team of solid survivors that actually know what they're doing, tunneling one survivor to death is suicide. It takes 80 seconds for one survivor to do a generator given that you don't make any great skill checks or fail any skill checks. Now let's assume that you insta-found and insta-downed your obsession, and instantly put them on the hook without a problem. Not particularly likely, but I'll still humor it. From first hook to dead takes one minute for each stage of the hook, 2 minutes total. This means that the survivors would essentially get 3-4 gens done during this time if they realize you're camping and just go do generators instead. If they attempt an unhook of any sort while you ARE camping, they either don't understand how the game functions and are effectively killing the survivor on the hook themselves with their own neglegence, or they have borrowed time, which only adds more time for them to do generators. If you aren't camping, then they will most likely unhook, causing you to spend even more time hunting down that sole survivor that you want dead. This is not taking into account the time taken to find and down that player the first time, any possible unhook, the inevitable DS, or survivor looping. Simply put, a survivor team that fails because you killed one person without interacting with anyone else only failed because they chose to, and from experience, that kind of play only happens from ranks 13+ (I know rank doesnt matter, but sometimes, it really does). Attempting to tunnel and kill one player all game in a team of survivors that have an understanding of how the game functions will net you one kill, 3 escaped, and dying light activating while the exit gates are already open. But I will say again, this is not a discussion about tunneling/not tunneling or if it's a viable strategy. This is simply a fix to a rather underwhelming perk that I believe takes away from both sides when it's used. 
---
I do everything you said except barbeque and chilli lol it ll be a while before I get that. I d say on average every game my rune gets activated 15 times. Don't know if that's good or bad but it's that. I always place 1 hatch, some near gens, some in high traffic areas and some in random areas. I always save 1 for hook so someone gets hit.

All the thicc thots approve!
---
Its honestly great! I love having teammates with 1 perk going against Mr. ttv P3 nurse main
---
The concept is sound but I don't quite like the secondary part of his power where he can possess survivors.
---
With the increase danger of faster vaults and faster pallet breaks using pounce, he already pose a huge threat as Hyde with his increased mobility and dash attack. There's nothing stopping him from being forced back into being concealed. 
---
To play with the idea that Hyde was always brought forward temporary with the aid of potions, it'd make sense that he'd eventually revert back into his concealed form if he cannot keep up with the chase. 
---
I can't activate the perk even with the killer standing still, one inch away from the locker...
---
Thats.. not true.. they got reverted because of the waiting times
---
I haven't played with Nurse in any dedicated fashion for months, so I'm not sure I could pull off the plays I used to, without lots of practice, but I always felt like my success with Nurse was because I had a really good grasp on blink ranges, and the areas I could cut off survivors when they tried to juke me by losing line of sight.
---
With Spirit, it actually is somewhat of a gamble, because it all revolves around mind gaming, which maybe I've just been getting very lucky with. After some initial struggles with her, I've found that a lot of people seem to have a lot of difficulty predicting what I'm going to do, as I often like trying to bait people into think I'm gone into spirit walk, and then they double back right into me.
---
Like you said, however, there are certain people I've faced as Spirit who just seem to always guess correctly what tactic I'm trying to use to catch them, and it can prolong chases long enough for me to waste time so that I'm not getting the benefit out of the Spirit's power.
---
Yes this is correct. But to be honest I don't think it would be a good idea to go spend time finding something to get infected on, and then got to a fountain, then spend time cleansing and alerting the killer of your location and giving a corrupt pool just for a heal.
---
They are dressed as the Plague. I think that makes it a cosplay right? Or am I missing something? 
---
..since when?
---
Instead of placing her traps on generators, place them on loops like half a meter in front of a pallet, and always remember that they recycle so don‚Äôt be scared to place them anywhere.
---
Also, BBQ is an absolute must more than ruin. I am currently playing on my smurf because my main acc got suspended for bad language (lmao), and I went from rank 20 to 4 without BBQ and it was fucking catastrophic.
---
This bug we call a *game* 
---
Just don't play gen simulator like a bot and try to be aware of where she is... she hooked someone near you? You prolly shouldn't stay on that gen (or at least you would start tapping it at that point). 
---
It's a god tier addon at the start of the game - after that first grab people *should* start to make it hard for you to grab someone. 
---
Not true? Well, true to me ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Then you should check the image I just posted. Took all of their tool boxes. Dudes had the nerve to try and pick it up after 2 stabs and then a swipe to down them. Right in front of me. They cared more for their precious item than to not be put on the hook. Then all died lol 
---
So killers wanted DS to be nerfed because they couldnt adapt to it? wow.
---
I got it on release, I think I even pre-ordered it. I played it very often, but stopped playing after they added new characters you had to pay for. It pissed me off so much. Especially since the new characters were also stronger. In dead by daylight, you only have to pay for the licenced characters, in PC, you can unlock the others trough gameplay and apperently, you get them for free on PS4. Evolved had a good progression system and could have used that system to make the game feel very rewarding when new characters came out. I'm sure I'd still love to play the game today, but last time I checked, the game was dead and que times could take over an hour
---
yeah the lonest i‚Äôve waited was 2 minutesish
---
I actually do this and also I‚Äôll down people and not hook them just for this
---
Lol. This guys doesn't seem like someone who wants to get better at the game... D/Cing won't make you a better survivor
---
I just hate that you can be really good and crush the other side (genrush and all 4 escape or kill all 4 near instantly) and still depip or safety pip. You shouldn't be punished because your enemy is bad. It just doesn't make sense to me. 
---
learn from Vermintide's folly
---
Be happy people are online at all hours! A year ago on Xbox the game would almost die after 2 am EST on the weekends. Now I almost instantly get a game at 3 am on a Tuesday. Plus its always interesting to see the change of playstyles from people depending on the day/time.
---
There isn't a pink flashlight btw, purple is the highest Rarity for survivor items. You can get pink add-ons though.
---
Tbh I think it was added in as a transisiton for dedicated servers ? 
---
I agree. That‚Äôs not how other games work.

Noone uses nurse anymore

I was wondering about that perk combo, but didn't have plag to test it. Thanks.

It is better with me as well, but I think that console players are having some problems with it, because the new matchmaking shortened theirs and made PC longer. They should leave the new one with consile and let the old one at the PC.
---
Your brain must be very big if it is capable of processing this much information at once.
---
Quitting players is already punished to the right degree. They get no points and masssive amounts equals a ban
---
&gt;Ranking is how the game match makes people, basically.
---
We know that‚Äôs a goddamn lie, I play at red ranks and I‚Äôve gotten rank 18 killers more times than not. Same thing goes for the other way around.
---
I love that you got downvoted for telling the truth. Let them believe what they want.
---
While I agree that it can be pretty scummy, most survivors will literally loop you for as long as you let them. I‚Äôve gotten frustrated and chased someone for like half a game.
---
How do you feel about killers camping a hook? I know it‚Äôs shitty but if there are only two people left or I know I can‚Äôt catch anymore before they open the gates I‚Äôll just stay there and secure my one kill.
---
Don‚Äôt worry they grow back...
---
no they don‚Äôt
---
That seems strange. May be worth reporting as a possible bug in the official forums? 
---
She's extremely toxic no doubt. Then she turns around and plays victim. She was a very poor choice to represent the company as a fog whisperer. BHVR has no ethics though, they're mass banning everyone on their forums over the past week who speaks out about the state the game is in.
---
I used to think noob3 was bad but there are times when even he realizes hes gone too far and pulls back which is good I guess. I think he just gets carried away in the moment. With Jen I've never seen that, theres just a straight up viciousness with how she treats and speaks to killers. She's like Ochido but without the mental handicap.
---
Yes, and you get a free survivor pudding every match if you hook everyone 
---
My personal favorites are Ruin, Iron Maiden, Monitor &amp; Abuse (or Shadowborn if you don't have it), and Tinkerer. The smaller or even outright suppressed terror radius makes her really fucking dangerous because you can get it close. Survivors generally put their guards up when they hear the Lullaby but do not usually react until they either see you or hear the terror radius. 
---
Sounds delicious 
---
Small dev team btw. DBD is big enough to have a dev team who is even semi competent yet here we are with the equivalent of severely mentally handicapped monkeys.
---
What an entitled douche.
---
Let me catch someone saying this post isn‚Äôt true üò§
---
It tastes salty
---
I don‚Äôt get much of a difference tbh 
---
God I'm so entitled for wanting to play a game that isn't completely bug-ridden and unplayable. It's not like BHVR has made millions from the store.
---
Definitely, I use both of these and they help really well late game 
---
If the exit gates are powered camping is justified to secure a kill. When there are only two survivors left camping only loses you points. You might as well look for the other survivor because if they unhook you'll still be able to find one of them and put them back on the hook.
---
That's not true. I am allowed to call them incompetent because I am a customer and the service that BHVR is giving is piss poor
---
Praise the entity indeed!
---
This would be so sick to add to the game. I really really reallllyyy love the map portion. I just hope is something like this arises, they can add a second tab that shows a map of the opposite side (if youre playing killer, you see where survivors went). That way you can build up some good game knowledge.
---
It‚Äôs a good perk but I never seem to get the other tiers in my bloodweb ü§£
---
But remember playing kIller is *hard* :( 
---
Same. I've already got the 3k, so I've probably made a fair amount of BP. Don't see the point in wasting my time pissing around for the 4k (unless I'm going for adept then like, yeah, sorry).
---
then unsub and stop playing and buy god of war or red red redemption 
---
Gotta move that gear up
---
BBQ, Ruin, Whispers, Nurse's Calling.

In a lot of games you have a rank reset it just takes a longer time for it to reset, Legue and Overwatch for example. But there is also a larger player base and they have a better way of calculating skill than DBD. DBD only goes by your rank, and if it's to easy to rank up you will have matches where the killer is really good and 2/4 survivor are terrible, or vice versa. Black pips ate just dumb TBH. And the entire emblem system is also kinda dumb. The only goal of a killer and a survivor is to kill or survive. If you survivor that should be a win, if you kill them all that's a win. I think it would be a lot better if survivor got a pip for surviving and lost one for dying, and maybe give out 2 pips if all 4 survived. Same with killer, if you kill 2 that's a pip and killing all 4 would be a double pip. So if you want to win as a survivor you need to help out your team so that you can get the double pip and as a killer you would want to focus on different survivors, and delaying the game so that you can get your double pip. This would make a lot more sense, but it might be to easy to rank up
---
But...isn't Friday the 13th dead?
---
you don‚Äôt know how games work and clearly are an entitled brat, go play something else and unsub

Here‚Äôs a solution: Don‚Äôt try to tell people on Reddit to stop complaining. 
---
You‚Äôre comparing Rockstar to BHVR. 
---
The problem is not the game bug process, it‚Äôs that whenever they fix a bug, another three pop up. Some of those new bugs being a lot worse than the last ones. 
---
How the fuck.. h h h how could you tell where your body was going?!
---
qt pie
---
I agree, in part. It isn't great that you get punished if the enemy team is bad. Something should be done if survivors genrush and escape without anyone getting hooked but only safety pip or single pip. And if a killer instadowns four idiot survivors, they shouldn't depip or single pip. The system is better than it was, but still isn't what it should be.
---
But, wow, you really set yourself up for criticism by posting this at rank ten. Should have hit red ranks or excluded the screenshot if you wanted to be taken seriously. 
---
wait...that happens???
---
Does It also work for Pig and her dash attack?
---
I have not browsed this subreddit or played in almost 3 months and the recent chapter has really brought to light the absolute shit state that the game is in.

Was playing survivor the other day and everytime I rescued this Kate she'd step in the completely obvious trap not far from the hook. Somehow, somehow it was her and I that were the only two left and I unhooked her for what felt like the billionth time and she steps in another trap. I just pointed at her to let her know she's fucked and went and found the hatch.
---
I recently had a standoff (was playing surv at the time. As killer I almost always just let the surv go), where this killer was not having it. Well, I had nothing better to do with my time so I just pulled up youtube on my other monitor and fucked off for roughly an hour. This guy (was playing hillbilly) decided he would rather just DC than let me have hatch. I gotta say, I respect the "fuck you, no hatch for you", but was it worth losing all the bp for that game after such a long standoff? 
---
On console nurse is so hard to use. Such a drop if framerate blinking hitting anyone is a mericle. 
---
I'd be irritated with a pity kill in the killer's shoes. I don't want charity. 
---
Plus, as others said, as survivor, I'm not going to feed my teammates or myself to the killer. It can't be fun for the person who *knows* their teammates could have bodyblocked and didn't, so who's fun is more important? That survivor or the killer? 
---
With time, the killer will get better, or decide they don't like playing killer and switch to survivor. The only time I feel bad is when matchmaking strikes and my red rank self gets matched with a brand new killer. That's always a bit of a feels bad, but there's no way of knowing that until the end. 
---
Dead but at least it hasnt been nerfed amirite?
---
Heres the thing. You are not on the killers side when you're playing survivor. Losing is the nature of the game. How would the survivor ***you*** let die feel if you let them die just to make the killer feel better? No matter what, someone loses. Play for your team, not the enemy team. Simple as that.
---
Ya know when you cant move then all the sudden ur on a hook, I don't think that was lag
---
yes and bigger companies do the same that‚Äôs one of my points that you can‚Äôt expect quick work from a small team of indie devs
---
What does that mean, friend?
---
Welp, my hopes for just grabbing BBQ without purchasing LF might have gone downhill.
---
I mean I saw your comments earlier on that guy‚Äôs post. If you don‚Äôt want people to complain about the devs then don‚Äôt come on the sub. This sub shits on the devs. Telling someone not to complain won‚Äôt make them stop. 
---
You can‚Äôt break certain parts of a game every patch and expect the community to say ‚Äúoh yeah they‚Äôre just human‚Äù. People are going to get frustrated, with or without coding knowledge. Players want to play complete games and have fun doing it. 
---
You forgot healing 
---
yes tap the rest of 4 to 5 gebs not only it's fun gameplay but now it takes even longer for you to do gens 
---
You now eliminated being grabbed for being hit 
---
people wanna complain just don‚Äôt wanna be told that they‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs kinda human nature guess
---
Does hag have a shorter lunge?
---
They wouldn't put a licensed character into the game as a joke. They can't just use names without paying for them and I doubt they'd pay for a name as a joke. It'd be an...*interesting* business decision if they did. 
---
If they use the insta heal does it still show then in the end screen?
---
You‚Äôre childish af
---
Actually it's even worse then the example I gave, because it's way more like instead of just their quality decreasing, they also stop by and make their old, good work even worse, not only is the new content getting worse, but you completely lose access to their older art.
---
But I can see you are literally going to defend them no matter what, they could literally make the game unplayable and you would go " But coding is HAAAAARD"
---
I mean, is it coming in 2.7.0? We‚Äôre currently is 2.60.
---
Maybe bwvause im not english
---
Have matchmaking times gotten /much/ worse for anyone else? Just last Sunday I was playing 4-5 games an hour as a killer, but now I'm lucky to get one game in 20 minutes of sitting in a lobby.
---
Then go and learn English so you can understand what I'm saying
---
Yes
---
Hmmm, medical gauze?
---
Because Billy and LF both have one shot abilities who should be able to instadown people if they catch them. It's probably not intentional for the Plague to be able to play that way. 
---
"We just reverted our Matchmaking to the previous version. We gathered a lot of feedback in the last weeks that will help us improve the general quality of the system. More information will be provided later this week on the upcoming changes. Thank you for your understanding." Thats all I know
---
Same
---
Delet this
---
Were you playing the Plague?
---
Ace has a teachable perk that allows you to find items with addons from chests, and this includes Stypic Agents, the "very rare" quality insta heal. The perk is Ace in the Hole.
---
Huntress? Hillybilly? Clown? And now Plague? Any of these decent killers that can play and influence survivor chases? Not every other "killer".
---
I know what you are saying, you are just another player bitching about a game they play, if you really liked the game you wouldn't talk shit about it.
---
Don't like the game... Leave.
---
Also fuck you, just because i cant type English that well doesn't mean i don't know, i dont originally speak english so your way of speaking is different than mine
---
Uh, OP? Don't put your porn folder next to the meme folder this is what happens
---
Nah I was playing myers.
---
&gt;I've got about 150hrs in the game  
---
Watch out, we have a badass over here, lmao
---
I don't think he was bming or trolling. He probably just forgot about the Mori at first.
---
I agree that the constant 3v1s and 2v1s etc. suck.
---
I‚Äôve thankfully only encountered once that refused to even after a minute of looping. I was tunneled from two seconds in (spawned in the open and took two steps to the side to try to move behind an object) until I died roughly 10 minutes later. Accidentally ran him by a friend twice. He Frenzied off my friend the first time, but the second time he just ignored my friend entirely. And by tunneled I mean aside from the one time he hit my friend, no one else was hooked or even hit. Four and a half gens through ruin, too. Easiest depip of my life.
---
The end game screen shows what they came in with, not what they left with, I believe.
---
Sounds like I need to change disciplines then. I'd much rather get 6 figures playing a drag and drop programming game than make 5 as a full stack .Net/js/SQL dev. :/
---
I can tell you never coded or know how a game works üòÇ. I compaired dbd to rdr because it shows that even big companies do this. The game is still bugged and has even bigger bugs than the beginning. Also you only using the coding is hard points really shows you just wanna complain and be negative just go play a better game there‚Äôs lots out there.
---
Hmmm weird, got a video?
---
Distressing is a no, surveillance is okay but I prefer other perks like nurses or shadowborne 
---
Items found during a trial aren't displayed in the end game screen. If the survivor had Ace in the Hole, then he could have found an insta-heal add-on with a medkit. 
---
Your welcome 
---
May i too? I have very few friends who play it and the one who does play haven't done so in a while. 
---
It doesn't mean you have to gen-tap for the rest of the game. You have many situations where you are perfectly aware of spirit's whereabouts, i.e. Empathy, Alert, Object of Obsession, Spine Chill, when she picks someone up, etc etc. 
---
Also yes, the people are upset because they think there's no counterplay to grabs, when obviously there's a lot. Getting a free hit at the start (for a purple addon) isn't bad, look at Wraith or Pig. 
---
I haven't played the game in 3 months as stated many times previously. Please fuck off you are probably some muslim who is leeching off a social welfare system somewhere in a rich country.
---
Yep that's a lot
---
What video game are you talking about? 
---
I say that healing nerfs were OK, even when I play survivor, but now Thanato and Sloppy Butcher together are BS.
---
I briefly made it using Wraith until about rank 10 and then Billy for the rest of the way. I actually really enjoy playing as both of them
---
*You're
---
TBH, juking a Nurse has very little to do with actual looping - two different skillsets.
---
Grab perk first so it summons entity right away. Pay attn to the strains, you can ‚Äútrick‚Äù the entity into taking entire sections if you play your cards right. Other than that, go brown.
---
*dabs in feng main*
---
Killers get: buffs to pick up speed, trapper, wraith, NOED, BBQ, ruin, map design
---
Survivors get: nerfs to pallets, windows, flashlights, BNP, healing speed, DS
---
Killers: "survivor is OP"
---
Survivors: *stops playing the game* because after all the nerfs you still have to deal with: bullshit hitboxes, frozen loading screens, Moris, tunneling, facecampers, Nurse, Billy, Iridescent Head, Franks Mix Tape, Prayer Beads, Vile Emetic
---
In all honesty I personally think instead of working on new chapters and stuff like that, they should put that to the side for a while since we have enough killers/survivors for now and focus on the issues at hand like the bugs and balancing everything out. Then once that is done THEN make more killers and stop changing good perks and other things that's just gonna cause more bugs in the longrun. It would save a lot of time and it would save them a lot of community rage, plus I think everyone would be happy.
---
Racism, wow
---
Btw im canadian who speaks originally french but thanks for discrediting your entire argument by being racist.
---
I totally agree but the sub isn‚Äôt for bitching about the game and the mods should consider it over saturated as there‚Äôs atleast 3 posts about the same things every hours. and You kinda missed the point, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs justified i‚Äôm saying have patience as they‚Äôre not the only companies who have done this
---
and I agree people will get mad with coding knowledge or not but it‚Äôs the difference of yelling at someone woth facts and yelling because you saw others yelling and cab get them on your side
---
Oh god now I know why you're so desperate to suck the devs 'cocks.
---
How does it feel to be on a deserted island?
---
&gt;You're talking perks counter power which doesn't make sense for this game because you can never go against a certain killer
---
Exactly, this is the game that we're playing. The game isn't competitive and never will be, you can't always be prepared. If you dislike prayer beads spirit you got plenty of options. Too bad most of them aren't "meta", right?
---
That seems to be the core issue with people who dislike everything that doesn't speak against prayer beads. They're meta slaves and can't adapt against something because they feel forced to run perks that counter other top tier killers (even though survivors aren't even that dependant on perks). You can definitely drop a situational perk (probably iron will or adrenaline at high ranks) for a perk that counters prayer beads and you'll still be fine. 
---
&gt;Alert? What's that gonna do?
---
It tells you where spirit is when she breaks something. It gives you a timespan where you know you're safe from grabs, if you have good positioning. 
---
&gt;And spine chill can be played and toyed around with by approaching the gen to your back.
---
In theory, yes. In practice, no killers does that, let's be honest. Killers would only start to do that when stealth killers became meta and survivors would run that perk more often, which isn't the case. 
---
It's always the same in threads like this. People try and make up reasons why the addon can't be countered, when they can only sit on gens and hold M1. 
---

Lol u better be glad u had that. They mustve been SWF and planned on getting ur hooks to 99%. Then once u down one of em, they was most likely going to break each one u try to go to. I did that once to a Bubba xD. I did it 6 times and made him drop 3 ppl. He got really upset and tunnelled the hell outta me. My team loved me enough to take hits at the gates for me when I got downed and we all lived.
---
I don‚Äôt know honestly you can fond posts dealing with that. But if people seriously think that the game gets stale that quick and rather have new content and a broken game lr expect them to fix ot and add new content then I think the devs are better off losing those ‚Äúfans‚Äù
---
&gt;you forgot they even nerfed locker
---
&gt;edit: kinda nerfed lockers
---
Didn't they buff lockers? By making so it blocks all aura reading perks from killers? 
---
Exactly, basically like a good widow in overwatch, has counters but most likely you'll get fucked
---
You actually have to think about what you do. So it got more skillful. When do you use your exhaustion perk, instead of just waiting on the cooldown. Where do i run if he catches me here and so on.
---
Looks like you gotta play survivor and have fun with some baby killers (assuming you don‚Äôt play survivor often)
---
A cool idea they could try is ranked lobbies and unranked maybe it could help? or not
---
yes. but they also removed your own aura reading abilities. they also added head on/iron maiden. hence kinda nerfed
---
 Meishin Railway.
---
Survivors' escape rates do not specify against which killers, though. The only comparisons are maps and ranks.  
---
There's nothing regarding specific killer kill rates, meaning Freddy's supposed 50% kill rate has still not been proven.
---
The Saw games.
---
But unlike league or overwatch, you can't move to counter her once the game has started... 
---
not really i‚Äôve had a bunch of discussions on here üòá
---
You‚Äôll be lucky anyway if you don‚Äôt get face camped anyway if the killer doesn‚Äôt already know to even pull it off 
---
So many other games have it and are fine. I‚Äôd love to see my own stats at the end game and my teammates. 
---
I think an overall stat page would be awesome though. Stuff like how many times you get out the hatch, how many totems you‚Äôve cleansed etc etc. 
---
I'm getting instant killer lobbies and around 1 minute wait for survivor lobbies. My issue is that 80% of those games at least one person has the infinite loading screen and never loads in. I played 10 games yesterday and 8 of them had at least one person affected by the infinite load screen (one of them had 2). It's getting out of hand.
---
I got one tonight as the doctor! But most of my other games had atleast 1 dc-er
---
I mean, they don't depip, and you don't lose items. However, it is complete bullshit that we lose our offerings. Fuck that shit BHVR, if some huntress rages at getting a bad map, I should not be punished for having used a bloody party streamers.
---
Surveillance, tenacity (tapp crawling perk), Save the best for last, and Streetwise
---
Bless your parents, they're angels in disguise.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why this is happening to some people. I‚Äôm in canada but I doubt that has anything to do with it.... I‚Äôve only waited about 2 minutes 
---
Exactly this. It doesn't matter if I haven't found a specific person all game. I can get 5+ hooks and finally find them, then they DC and stay after the game just to talk shit and brag about how they "denied me of a BBQ stack," etc. Some people have been legitimately disconnecting, but most do it because they are a poor sport, a complete scumbag, having a bad day, or a mix of all of those. Either way, it's annoying. I'm sick of people feeling like I should give the other 3 a free escape because someone DC'd. Sorry, it's part of the game now and should be expected at this point. Just back out right then and there and not waste anyone's time if you are expecting an easy game. Don't get mad at me, get mad at the DCers. If all At this point if 2 DC before any gens are done I just DC myself and move on. It's not worth the time and it's not fun for anyone.

---
I‚Äôd say more Tyde than Tru3. Tru3 plays Freddy with Overcharge quite often.
---
I have several friends who have stopped playing the game for this reason. The constant nerfs to survivors while completely ignoring things like Nurse, Hillbilly, Moris, b.s. add-ons etc. coupled with freezing load screens and toxic behavior. 
---
They've ust stopped playing. Theres a million good ganes put there, why should they struggle through all the bullshit to get to the fun parts of the game? 
---
Is that what you want, less players? Im not defending DC'ing, but theres a reason players do it so frequently. Maybe look at the cause instead of just calling everyone bitches. 
---
I'd settle for just an audio/visual cue, like the explosion you get from a regular totem. Just make it look/sound  a little different so we know it was a dull and not the lit.
---
That way you know which area of the map has been cleared too.
---
Also, give a little lightbringerfor dull totems just so whoever takes the time to do the totems doesnt lose out.
---
Did you try closing the lobby and making a new one?
---
Exactly. At the very least they could try to maximize their own points and 3 hook everyone right? Nope, gotta slug one and chase someone else, down them then camp the bodies. Get like zero points, piss off people who are already pissed off, and... win? You were going to win anyway so all you did was be an asshole. Ok, good for them I guess.
---
Meta perks. Better? 
---
Wait you actually reached 1?!
---
Yeah I agree, should not be a hard thing to fix. We will probably see it being changed very soon....hopefully.
---
Just play the tutorials 
---
Are you a high rank killer, by chance? The "current" matchmaking system actually takes rank into account when matching you with survivors, so if you're a high rank, there's many less survivors to group with you. The "new" ranking system didn't care about ranks at all and only cared about queue order, so you would've been getting lobbies much faster.
---
Well lol a few people are taking me seriously when it was obviously sarcasm... I‚Äôm glad a lot more people realized that
---
Red rank? That's a big oof, good luck friend :/ 
---
A quick little bonus... that you can get in the next game. Killers would be facecamping you besides, about five seconds after the patchnotes dropped that said survivors aren't automatically sacrificed if they're hooked as the last survivor. Remember, the killer is a person who wants to play the game as well. Like I said, the game is over; time to move on to the next game.

**Rule 2** - Unrelated Content. All posts must be directly related to Dead by Daylight, the fanbase surrounding the game, the subreddit itself or associated properties.

* Content must be directly focused on Dead by Daylight; referring to the game in the title is not sufficient.
---
Too bad that will probably never happen because "muh NOED is balanced it doesn't need changes" or BHVR is just too busy with other stuff. I am still waiting for a toggle option for certain longer actions so I don't have to hold down M1 for a full 80 seconds.
---
That is terrifying 
---
Nightmare for Freddy that is
---
Happening to me too. I don't know what's going on. I'm getting really frustrated. I just want to play on my free time. I had TWO MATCHES today and I've been trying for 3 hours. Damn. :(
---
Billy &amp; Spirit right now, we still have to see where the Plague will tier as a killer.
---
I get waiting on bugs but the infinite load screen is like a DEFCON 1 level of urgency. Its affecting game after game after game and has been extremely frequent since the December update. Sure it waa there before that but not every third game like it seems now.
---
That issue needed to be gone months ago.
---
This would be cool, would it still activate once all gens are done? Or would the tokens be consumable right away? Either way, thrill of the hunt with a full hex build would be strong (all totems visible and they take much longer to break)
---
It's awful. Seemed like it was going to be my favorite perk to run on him, but now, nope. 
---
My current preferred build is Save The Best For Last, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Ruin, and BBQ. I was replacing Monitor &amp; Abuse with Dark Devotion.
---
Save The Best For Last is already a good perk on Freddy because he's one of the only killers you can tag your obsession with your power withouting hitting them while still having an effect. It also makes him less of a punching bag to the survivors in my experience. So the game plan was to get full stacks, tag my obsession, but them once, still have a lowered attack CD, then go for any survivors I also had tagged while not having a terror radius for a surprise hit followed by a lowered attack CD again. Extra points if the faux-terror radius the obsessions as emiting wouldn't impair my aura reading. But now, nope. 
---
Honestly upset over it. Was really looking forward to how fun it would be. Every match would have a taste of Red Paint Brush Freddy. Fuck me. 
---
I've already read all the threads and stuff here. I agree complaining about certain things is getting old to see real quickly, and it becomes annoying at times. Personally I don't have much complaints aside from when bugs and backend servers make it impossible to open the game. 
---
That said, as someone else has said to you, it is bugs galore. One goes away, two or three more pop up from their fix. Take the gigantic characters for example. I think the devs set themselves up for some of this, because they're very ambitious (good for them) which causes people to encourage  (in one way or another) the devs to fix these issues- some of which have been here since the game was released. 
---
The frustration comes from knowing the potential of the game, wanting the game and devs to reach their max potential, and then becoming frustrated, duscouraged, annoyed, so on that the game breaks more the more the devs touch it. Sure, games like red dead redemption have bugs as well, and of course they take time to get fixed and the fixes themselves can cause more issues. It seems like a fair comparison but it isn't. Even with the bugs, the game still functions like it should majoritively. You still get the storyline. Dbd doesn't have a storyline, offline mode, other play modes, or objectives. As much as we love the game, we can all admit we're stuck doing the same things over and over, and when that happens (wether you like the game or not) the bugs become increasingly obvious. We can't escape yo a different area of the world, because there is no world like there is in rdr2. So while that seems like a fair comparison at face value, it isn't. There's still a lot in that game that makes it amazing, like the storyline. That's something dbd wasn't and won't be designed for. 
---
Again, I agree that a lot of things do get old to see complaints of. Complaining doesn't mean someone hates the game though, and everyone has their own breaking points. Mine is connection issues kicking me from trials and chasing the game to take hours of fiddling to open. Others are going to be smaller issues like hitboxes. I do think the community needs to give the devs time and space to breathe and think, and I think the devs need to worry more about fixing bugs than putting out new content to make money. They'll lose more money in the long run due to their prioritizing content over bug fixes, but they've been on a roll with content release so idk if they realize that. They need to actually listen to their community instead of saying they do and then releasing another chapter which causes more things they need to fix. Everyone can do better here, the peiple complaining aren't the only ones at fault. Even if you're irritated, it's not fair to put the blame solely on them. 
---
Getting points for yeeting off the hook would benefit the killer aswell, more points. The struggle can easily be just instakill, but let me at least try to yeet off, the hatch could be right next to a hook.
---
If Myers is stalking and you go into his hit box, then he stops stalking. What happens?
---
What does it mean to be respecting pallets?
---
When they spend 3 minutes changing direction on a pallet then you slam it down on then anyway, and they could have had the same result in 10 seconds by just commit to a direction.
---
I think that‚Äôs because a crow got scared outside of your perks radius.
---
Sorry for spelling mistakes btw, dyslexia on top of cutting my nails recently has messed me up 
---
you will still be in his hitbox but both of you can move apart. you wont get stuck
---
I haven't really experimented becauae I dont have many perks for her but every good player I've seen tends to take Ruin, BBQ and Nurses. Last perk varies.
---
Thanks for the explanation. This was actually pretty revealing for me. I see why survivors might get frustrated playing against legion...but as a killer I just find it as frustrating playing against 4-man SWF with insta-heal and uber-flashlight. I am in no way a killer-pro, I would say I am a pretty decent (with Freddy, Legion and Hag even a good one; although after your text I might have to scratch Legion from that list). 
---
Anyways, for me those games are lost the moment they begin (don't want to derail this to a thread about BMing but that's in those games pretty much guaranteed; in short the fuller the SWF, the cockier they get), I find it impossible to win against those, but that doesn't make me disconnect. 
---
Actually I try even harder to kill them because if my odds are already bad, everything I get done is a plus.
---
What I originally wanted to write was:
---
1. It's a game, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. 
---
2. Life isn't fair. You will get Legions, I will get 4-man squads.
---
3. You are playing a 5-man game. Just because you are fed up with one of those guys, doesn't give you the right to ruin the game for the rest of them. If you REALLY want to quit, at LEAST do it so your mates can get something out of it (get chased as long as possible, struggle till the end, etc.; it might cost you a few minutes, but it sure won't ruin the whole round for all others).
---
I actually wrote far more than I intended so sorry about that.
---
I used "man" and "guys" but the girls can rest assured I do know you also play DBD. I was actually just lazy, so I only used the male form.
---
More crowded than I thought 
---
XD I'm spending them as we speak 
---
Odd, I haven't experienced that issue yet. I have seen others commenting that it happens to them as well. I guess I'm in a sweet spot or something 
---
I had a trapper game last night playing on crotus penn and I had those addons for random set traps I trapped shack I downed this dwight hooked him feng unhooks him I hit her and she goes straight to shack steps in the trap I pick her up and she disconnects. Needless to say we all made fun of her in the after game chat.
---
They‚Äôre the same folder 
---
Survivors hate frankys even though they call it a weak perk 
---
Dude... you just gave me a heart attack. I dont think any killer could win against that. Ever. Shit im depressed just thinking about having to go agains that. 
---
This would be really awesome. Average time not getting downed for the match would be killer! 
---
Well, Killers dodge (mostly) in lobby, which doesn't ruin the game for the others at all. Since you can just quickly re-queue to get another match. I do understand the argument that survivors don't have that choice and I would have no problem with not seeing the survs prior to the match.   
---
The thing is: the game would die if survivors would see the killer before the match.  
---
The second thing is: quitting after the match started ruins the game for 4 other people.
---
The solution? Voice your concerns here on reddit, in the forum and during streams.
---
Of course, change won't happen in a day, so you will have to play against Legions without disconnecting.   
---
"now if I was the survivor I'd actua-
---
Nope the just kept running"
---
Haha lucky you! The infinite loading bug has been around for a while, but I've never seen it as bad as it has been this week.
---
That's when the killer hesitates to get near them during a chase to avoid being stunned 
---
It means the killer will play to always avoid a potential pallet stun during a loop so they'll stop short of the pallet and back away so the survivor tosses it without stunning them.  The reason this is bad is because any good survivor will take advantage of this playstyle by simply continuing the loop causing the killer to add time to every loop in the game.  It's a really poor way to play killer.  The removal of the pallet vacuum makes this an even worse way to play then it used to be.  Just say no to respecting pallets people, it will lose you games.

This is Freddy's Hell

WHY ARE AURAS SO HARD TO SEE ON MOUNT ORMOND?
---
Odds of that happening are ~8%. It's pretty unlikely, but not outside randomization scope. It's been 74 weeks since it's been on the shrine, shrine was down for 4 weeks. So, odds of not getting it are .9649 (55/57) ^70 = .081 or 8.1%. it might technically be a little lower since the odds of not getting it on the shrine were lower before new perks were added, but that's the quick math answer. 
---
I already figured that. But stranger things have happened. So I could not confirm it without testing it. 
---
Back in the day, this was basically an insta-heal. And when I say "back in the day" I mean waaay back in the day.

On PS4 the old matchmaking system resulted in 20 minute queues for swf consistently and solo queue broke similarly at times.  The new matchmaking system gave us 30-60 second survivor queues regardless of swf or time of day.  It was amazing!  But alas we've been banished to the forever campfire to watch the smores simulator since they reverted it.  Welp back to nothing but killer games for me unfortunately.
---
I mean since the update/retraction. I have before haha
---
What perks do you use? 
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Hag and Trapper usually require ruin, which I hate running, because once you fully place all your traps 4 gens are completed with it 
---
But when he throws his bottles he slows down to 100% speed. Plus, using a bittle to force a medium vault on a window actually makes him lose distance on the survivor.
---
What do you play on? 
---
Well I thought it was going good until you said that last part. That's not a gg.
---
For me it's spirit and hag
---
Iron Grasp is a great perk for killers. It says it cuts down the effects of wiggling by 75% but it definitely feels like 100%. You can carry a survivor anywhere you want and they‚Äôll never force you into a wall or a doorframe. 
---
Wraith, just waits invisible until everyone else is gone and then goes in for the chicken dinner.
---
I don't know what you mean.
---
That's a classic 'Gone Girl.'
---
Killers actually do though.
---
You're saying it like this doesn't happen but in every game where I successfully lose the killer in a chase they DC as soon as they realize they can't find me. And I've been in many games where the killer DCs as soon as he get hit with (pre-nerf) Decisive Strike or some other perk he doesn't like.
---
Killer are just as bad.
---
Survivors were broken, very fucking broken. The actual true lowest the killers got was when the flashlight and pallet saves were changed so that you didn't need any timing to save a survivor.
---
Killers could literally not even pick a survivor up if they weren't close to a wall. It's like you got punished as a killer for downing survivors.
---
In the past 3 months I saw one nurse
---
Devour Hope 
---
Wow, that oppinion was unpopular
---
STBFL Is pretty God on m1 killers like trapper I use it in my current build but otherwise it's a meme
---
Well i got teased thats for sure
---
Clown because he would just consume everyone
---
Oof, I feel like that would be game breaking. All the stealth would basically be gone. 
---
Huntress or wraith. As much as I love them I cant do shit
---
no a 11 year ild did
---
Pallet Vacuum?
---
So, who‚Äôs going to edit this and add in the music star gate music from **2001: A Space Odyssey**?
---
Sure. So yell at your teammates and bad survivors, then.
---
Exactly. If that's how the first chase goes, those three survivors will bang out one more gen before going for the save. By the time you can down two of them for another hook, the last one is done.
---
Red ranks as killer? Oh. That's the problem. There are very very very few red rank survivors now. People want their kills. Causes survivors to depip. So, when killers realize they have to wait on matches they depip themselfs and punish the now deranged survivors, which pushes them lower. 
---
That's one thing that baffles me about this community. Every game is a ranked game. Why is it seen as "clutch" or sweaty to use strong characters/builds? In most games you'd get chewed out for deliberately hamstringing yourself.
---
I'm not saying it's wrong to "ever" respect a pallet, but in general you want to swing through that shit.  No pallet vacuum means you're going to hit them through a lot more of those than you won't.  But you know what I mean.  Weaker killers will respect pallets as a matter of default.

Its actually true, as a former SC2 and Hearthstone player, I cant adequately perceive ''gg'' anymore, especially after stomped game to one or another side, like if you did 4K with no gens done as nurse - okay, but why do you consider this game good? Its harder to withhold toxicity, and gg does sound mocking in some scenarios, you are right
---
Yea it would be pretty sick to see, if their limp bodies slid down
---
Launch game as soon as its ready 
---
You didn‚Äôt have to say that
---
I WAIT IN LOBBY FOR 10 MINUTES AS SOLO SURVIVOR. FIND GAME AND GET INSTA DOWNED BY PLAGUE , CAMPED/TUNNELED TO DEATH. WITHIN 5 MINUTES. 
---
WAIT 10 MIN FUCKING AGAIN FOR ANOTHER PLAGUE TO CAMP ME IN BASEMENT AS THE LAST GEN POPS. FUUUUUUCCCKKK THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE RIGHT NOW 
---
Since they're fictional characters it depends on the person writing the scenario.
---
While some Killers like Freddy, Myers, and Spirit have obvious advantages I could write a feasible situation where Legion or Pig wins as well as I could write a situation where Freddy wins.
---
That said, Freddy is the most likely candidate, followed, in no particular order, by Myers, Spirit, Trapper, Huntress, Doctor, and Plague.
---
Remake Freddy is virtually immortal in his own fiction, having survived a fatal wound after being dragged into the Real World.
---
Myers is also nearly immortal and incredibly strong. Even though he only has a knife, he'd be able to shrug off fatal wounds and just keep killing.
---
Spirit is already a bunch of magically held together body parts; depending on whether or not she can be killed again she could just kill everyone without issue.
---
Trapper, Huntress, and Doctor are all big and strong; their powers could also make winning the fight easier in various ways.
---
Plague could make everyone sick with the plague. Even if she dies she could win by attrition since the 'winner' could eventually succumb to the disease.
---
Yeah, that's what everyone is saying. There must be something more complex from the Dev point of view that they have to roll it back on all platforms. They must not be capable of having different matchmaking on different platforms. Or its just their incompetence. Who knows. 
---
Wraith because he‚Äôd do nothing
---
Or Freddy... for the same reason 
---
Sure, mate. Let me do that. What a brilliant idea 
---
Sure it's bad if they loop you again. Definitely a killer mistake. Most survivors won't loop again, however, especially if it's a 50/50 on whether or not the killer will 'respect' it.
---
Probably better when possible to attempt to loop back/moonwalk, however, especially if the survivor can't see you. You might get pallet slammed, but that shortens loops significantly.
---
Are you the person who wrote an imaginary killer fight several months ago and at my request had (Clearly superior) Leatherface win? If so from what I remember it was very detailed and glorious! I'll have to go through my comments and try to find it again.
---
When it first came out, as a killer you had to wait like 3 minutes for the salty survivors to accept death and as soon as they got off (if they did) you obliterated them instanstly. No point on letting struggle
---
THE OLD/REVERTED MATCH MAKING SYSTEM IS COMPLETE SHIT, I CAN BARELY EVEN OPEN THE GAME DUE TO ERROR CODES. ENDED UP WITH A SAVE GAME ERROR CODE BECAUSE OF ALL THE CRASHING AND HALF THE PROGRESS I MADE EARLIER YESTERDAY WAS FUCKING GONE CUZ I CAN'T CONNECT TO THE BACK END SERVERS WITH THE OLD SYSTEM. THE NEW ONE THEY HAD, I COULD AT LEAST PLAY THE DAMN GAME. I'D RATHER FACE A P3 RANK ONE BILLY AT LEVEL 15 SURVIVOR THAN NOT PLAY AT ALL BUT THAT'S MY CONSOLE PROBS FOR YA
---
Not saying you can't be a good killer if you don't but I see more upside to not doing so. Without vacuums being a thing there's a good chance you'll get the hit or just eat the pallet. The less times you get looped at one spot the better for you as a killer.
---
And never respect God pallet. You force that bitch down as soon as you can.
---
Can someone tell me if there is anyway to counter a nurse with the add-on to see where they blink to? My friends and I do kill your friends sometimes and one of them refuses to play nurse without it and we always lose because we have no clue how to counter that add-on. I just wanna be able to loop my friend and tbag him 
---
Or equip new DS which is specifically designed to counter bad teammates like that. If you get caught two times, enjoy your stay on the hook?
---
For a points argument sure maybe the survivor could get those pints after being last hooked, but they shouldn‚Äôt have the ability to get off since this would just cause the killer to sit in front of the hook until you went into the struggle state.
---
I get what your saying though 
---
In some situations it could be beneficial to the survivor. For example being hooked near an exit gate or hatch. I‚Äôve seen it happen a lot, and survivors with sprint burst, adrenaline, or dead hard actually might have a chance to escape.
---
Discordance
---
THHAAAANNNKKKYYOOOUUUUU I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN THE GAME MUSIC OFF IF I DAMN WELL PLEASE
---
The face looks like shaggy and i cant unsee it
---
How about not nerfing the killer that stands the most chance against swf and buff other killers to the point where they can stand against swf
---
I'M PRETTY PISSED OFF WITH COLDWIND LATELY. EVERY TIME I GET THAT MAP ON KILLER I WISH TO UNVACCINATE MYSELF AND ENTER A SICK WARD. THERE ARE NO MIND GAMES. MY TOTEM SPAWNS NEXT TO SHACK LOOP AND THEY SPAWN ON MY TOTEM. I SPEND A SOLID MINUTE FUCKING GOING THROUGH SHACK AND THEN THE FUCKER RUNS ME THROUGH PIG LOOP WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO SHACK. OKAY THANK YOU. I GET THROUGH PIG LOOP AND FINALLY DOWN HIM AND THERE IS ONLY 1 GEN LEFT. OH BOY
---
I FUCKING **LOVE** COLDWIND. I TRY ANOTHER CHASE BUT THEY CAN SEE THROUGH THE WALLS IN COLDWIND SO THERE IS NO MIND GAME SO FUCK IT I GO BACK TO THE ONE PERSON I DOWNED AND FACE CAMP HIM UNTIL HE DIES.
---
FUCK COLDWIND!
---
WHY ARE PARTY STREAMERS EBONY MORI MAGNETS!?
---
Wraith has to sleep eventually. 
---
Freddy beats everyone assuming dream world. 
---
Yeah I run enduring on several killers but even the ones I don't I won't respect shit.  I'll gladly trade a stun for a hit.  My survivors die with tons of bps due to this too so wins all around.
---
Ok and? 
---
 Tables have turned, bitch
---
FUCK THESE QUEUE TIMES WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK
---
So I don't think event items just disappear like that 
---
Why not just make it so the survivor has 10 seconds to attempt the hook jump, then if the killer respects they can run, if not they still earned 1500 bp, or just reward that of they‚Äôre on first hook as last survivor, because that means they either outran or avoided the killer all match
---
Is that a giant tongue?? It can't be.. why would they need to model a tongue??
---
Yh I'm just waiting for BBQ and ruin
---
Ugh. 
---
I'm in Britain and I've had better connections against people in Canada than people in Eastern Europe.
---
I don‚Äôt think you read what Op said clearly they said they escaped with it meaning not an item that was already in their inventory. 
---
Where you really playing well if you couldn‚Äôt save a single friend
---
I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING KILLER AND LOSING MY IRIDESCENT BECAUSE THE SURVIVORS LITERALLY JUST WONT LEAVE THE HOOKED PERSON ALONE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO WALK AWAY FROM THE HOOK. ITS SO NICE BEING ABLE TO BLACK PIP EVERY GAME DESPITE ACTUALLY GETTING A 3K. I REALLY ENJOY THIS YES SIR YES I DO THE NEW PIPPING SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY FINE MMMMMMMHHHHMMMMM.
---
If it's their first hook they should get a chance at unhooking themselves which inversely would make Deliverance, slippery meat, and luck boosts not wasted simply just cuz you died last.
---
As for 2nd hook, I say it should still kill you instantly but at least give you the 900 survival points. 
---
WHOS IDEA WAS IT TO HAVE A INVERT CAMERA BUTTON ON CONSOLE. IT JUST SCREWS ME UP IF I GET JUMPED SCARED
---
MY PROBLEM WITH THE EMBLEMS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS TO PLAY A SPECIFIC WAY.
---
KILLER TUNNELS AND CAMPS? NO PIP FOR ANYONE, EVEN IF THE PERSON THEY'RE CHASING ESCAPES.
---
2 SURVIVORS DC? *MAYBE* IF YOU FARM THE OTHER TWO WILL PIP UP, BUT IF YOU FARM YOU WON'T SAFETY.
---
YOUR SURVIVOR TEAMMATES DO GENS REALLY FAST AND NEVER GET DOWNED? DEPIP FOR YOU AND THE KILLER AND PROBABLY A SAFETY FOR THEM.
---
KILLER FOLLOWS YOU ACROSS HALF THE MAP IN ONE CONTINUOUS CHASE? NO CHASER AND PROBABLY NO LIGHTBRINGER. DEPIP FOR YOU.
---
TEAMMATES FARM EACH OTHER OFF HOOK AND SELF-CARE? UNLESS YOU DO ALL 5 GENS AND NEVER GET DOWNED, THAT'S A DEPIP FOR YOU.
---
SURE, IN THEORY THIS WOULD PROMOTE BETTER TEAMWORK AND COOPERATION AMONGST PLAYERS, BUT IN PRACTICE IT JUST MEANS THAT EVERYONE SUFFERS BECAUSE ONE PERSON IS PLAYING A CERTAIN WAY AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T EVEN FAULT THEM FOR THE WAY THEY PLAY.
---
FOR EXAMPLE, PLAYING IMMERSED AGAINST THE NURSE WILL PROBABLY GET YOU A DEPIP OR SAFETY PIP, EVEN THOUGH STEALTHING AGAINST HER IS THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID DYING. 
---
LIKEWISE, GEN RUSHING A KILLER AND ESCAPING WITHOUT ANYONE GOING DOWN WILL PROBABLY SAFETY OR DEPIP EVERYONE IN THE LOBBY EVEN THOUGH THE SURVIVORS ARE DOING REALLY WELL.
---
His breathing is very quiet compared to other survivors
---
Predator: Makes scratch marks work correctly.
---
Would be a pretty good buff.
---
A simple rework for Predator would be to make is so scratch marks (for survivors that you are actively in a chase with) are shown in a bright straight line. The current version of Predator makes you lose survivors more than not running it.
---
I HATE IT THAT SURVIVORS WRITE ON MY STEAM PROFILE LIES ABOUT MY PLAYSTYLE AND OTHER USE THESE LIES AS EVIDENCE THAT I AM A PIECE OF SHIT AND WRITE MORE LIES.   
---
I WILL NEVER MAKE MY PROFILE PRIVATE OR DELETE ANY COMMENTS, I WON'T GIVE THEM THIS VICTORY. 
---
NEVERTHELESS THE CYCLE OF LIES, ASSHOLE SURVIVORS AND MORE LIES HURTS A LITTLE. I AM JUST A SIMPLE KILLER TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY IN THE UNIVERSE. I NEVER FACECAMP OR TUNNEL BUT I SURE AS HELL PLAY TO WIN.  
---
NOT SURE IF IT'S AGAINST THE RULES SINCE IT'S EFFECTIVELY CALLING OUT MYSELF:   
---
IF YOU WANT TO READ SOME SURVIVOR SALT LOOK UP MY STEAM PROFILE, SAME NICKNAME AND MLP AVATAR (NO I AM NOT A BRONY, I WAS YEARS AGO AND THE AVATAR IS KINDA A PIECE OF MY ACCOUNTS PERSONALITY NOW)
---
If by ‚Äúthe Plague sucks‚Äù you mean you think she‚Äôs weak, I agree. She‚Äôs not very good and that‚Äôs why so many of them resort to camping. I don‚Äôt mind playing against Plague because I know chances are good I‚Äôll get an easy escape as long as I‚Äôm not the first one hooked. 
---
probably freddy krueger. he can just wait out the battle and then intercept the last person in their sleep
---
Where he would lack in offensive power, I feel like his madness and illusions would probably be very strong in a clusterfuck of a fight.
---
this post isn‚Äôt true üò§
---
Because people are idiots. 
---
Considering that it doesn't happen consistently, it's neither a blocker nor easy to fix. It's like you didn't read OP's post.
---
Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
---
Very true, hoping the new ranking system will have fixed that after next rank reset
---
What good will it do? The killer will just chill around the hook and smack you down again. Like, why? Waste of time.
---
Lets See...
---
Trapper: High Physical Strength, but also Human.
---
Wraith: Invisibility with a hand axe, and is a spectral being.
---
Hillbilly: Extreme Leg Strength and a chainsaw. However is Human by technicality.
---
Nurse: Blinks far ranges which can stop any retreat but suffers from fatigue. Spectral being.
---
Myers: High Physical Strength and Endurance. Human but considered immortal.
---
Hag: Weak Physical Strength but can cover a large range. Was human but used magic to become a monster, which is possibly immortal.
---
Leatherface: High Physical Strength and has a chainsaw. However is also human.
---
Huntress: High physical arm strength as she carries a 2 handed axe and throws hatchets. However is human.
---
Amanda: Literally just human with a hidden blade.
---
Freddy: Spectral Entity that was human but is now considered immortal. However his glove is fairly weak.
---
Doctor: Controls electricity using his body. Considered human but with high endurance to electric energy.
---
Clown: Obese human with chemical knowledge and High arm strength.
---
Spirit: Literal ghost which can materialize at will. However is affected by physical collision.
---
Legion: Literal human teenagers with knives.
---
Plague: Human that was possibly given blessing from her gods to be immortal.
---
Out of these probably Freddy even though his claw is not as strong like a blunt weapon.
---
If you need 5k to make it 1mil and yo get 6k from a match that 1k difference is wasted so... 
---
I know crazy right?
---
Starting to believe that more and more.
---
Sounds cool
---
You don't think I try? I am just saying how easy it is.
---
I try to pip, but killers pip when survivors depip.
---
I love facing instant saw billies with enduring and spirit fury for the 8 to 12 pallets on a map.
---
I love facing omega blink or three. Blink nurses.
---
I love facing instant down Huntress.
---
People want their kills. Most of survivors points and progression for rank is tied behind surviving and making saves. If survivors are not allowed to do it by aggressive killers they don't pip and depip. 
---
mr rogers in a blood stained sweater
---
I swear on my yeezys we gon have some trouble üÖ±Ô∏è
---
Survivor mains will tell you, with no irony whatsoever, that loopers that are too good should not be targeted. That it's in your best interest to let them live and find some one else to chase. 
---
The game wasn't region locked? Now I get why I kept getting players from Asia in my lobbies, I thought it was bugged. How did this even make to the live client? 
---
I think some of them DC at the end of the match so people get to play normally and they‚Äôre not screwing over everyone else. I‚Äôm too addicted to bloodpoints to ever do it, personally. 
---
As survivor you are not guaranteed to reach the end game, as killer you will ALWAYS reach end game unless you've killed everyone and basically won the game. In order for a survivor to use Adrenaline they have to put some effort into winning the game, meanwhile a killer can sit on his ass for literally the entire game and still get a freebie in form of NOED.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGRGGHH
---
Spirit, Billy, Hag
---
Oh wow, the survivor hypocrisy and double standards continue, bravo on the lack of self-awareness
---
And Shmock i hope? If not im fuming mate
---
tru3 is ok yea but just because he does something doesn‚Äôt make it the right play, in all honesty he‚Äôs just an average red rank killer, nothing special about his playstyle.
---
I just take breaks from one side of the game if I get to the ranks where I'm not having fun anymore. Eventually rank reset happens and then I play again.
---
Wait if I run this and unhook and heal myself does we‚Äôll make it work on me???? 
---
You üëÜbetter watch üëÄ yourself fam before I get my üòà timbs on and send you to the shadow realm ‚ö∞Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è‚ÑπÔ∏èüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏è
---
That sounds like your problem. Let me get it it straight; It's fair for you to capitalize on your teammate's *good* plays, but when they make a *bad* one, it's unfair for your opponent to capitalize on it..?
---
Because plague is boring to play against, Plague and Legion were the worst updates this game has ever had..
---
Im predicting -8 downvotes on this :)
---
A couple weeks ago I had a dream that I was nea and me and some other survivors we're running from Mr.X from Resident evil 2 (I had played the remake a lot that week lol).
---
Also about that killer idea, me and my friend was discussing one day a killer idea of a mannequin killer whose power was turning into the survivor they hooked for 30 seconds (longer with add ons) we thought it sounded pretty cool. We never discussed any balancings of it tho (like how to tell if it was a survivor or the killer, any small differences to look for like slightly lighter skin or something)
---
‚ÄúFiX yOuR FuCkInG GaME!‚Äù
---
- Shouted from the back
---
Duh? If a teammate does good, give him many points and don't give me much. Simple. 
---
Give me 1 survivor perk that is the equivalent of noed
---
You just know that if they add swimsuit survivors, Ace is gonna be rocking that banana hammock.
---
WAIT TIME UNKNOWN
---
That moonwalk? How do you do it that way? I do it such a different way
---
Eww legion
---
I think the Trapper should be up one tier. I always do better with him than Wraith or Leatherface. 
---
I also think the Clown should be down a tier. I find him really easy to play against for some reason.
---
Also the Doctor should be in the Go Fuck Yourself Tier because damn lul
---
Because of legion ye
---
Personally I prefer to use Brutal Strength. Yeah stun times can hurt overall, but I find myself so rarely getting stunned that breaking the pallet faster is usually the better option. Plus less time spent breaking pallets and damaging gens is more time spent on tracking survivors.
---
What if the fun is in climbing the ranking system? 
---
I'm just trying to play killer and after waiting 20 minutes for a game, I finally get one and land an infinite loading screen. Its stuck at 5% and the hatch symbols are still moving so it's not my game not responding. Bah! Unplayable!!! I just wanted to play nice killer, or even fair killer. My Billy has his speed limiter on and wants to fly around.
---
No fair. 
---
You can't just benefit from your teammate's good plays that lift your team up, and then say it's unfair when they make bad ones that bring you back down. That's the core conceit for having teammates. You can't get everything you want at all times dude. 
---
It's part of her stereotype! She legally cant help you in that situation. 
---
im just not allowed to play M games or horror games. mainly because if my little sister
---
Good point. I‚Äôll start using it more
---
It used to work that way. It doesn't anymore. Botany Knowledge still increases the speed of Self Care, but not We'll Make It.
---
I K N O W you didn‚Äôt just tell me to watch myself bruhüò§ Imma knock your ass to sleep üò¥ ü§í

---
Anyone know original episode?
---
oh yeah lol 
---
I'm personally not sure what to do with the killers in the third tier as I don't feel they're bad, just easily bullied at times.
---
Meanwhile Freddy as everyone knows needs an entire rework. Working within his current power confines I feel like the only thing you can do is make failing a skill check not guarantee that you're removed from dream state. But that's RNG on top of RNG. 
---
Bing Bong Boi is just meh, he does well with getting the first hit after that he's just a standard M1 killer with nothing special about him. Possibly make him completely invisible so you can actually surprise people, even with his loud ass footsteps but that could be OP. Maybe make his bell distort the vision of survivors within a certain range of him while in a chase.
---
Trapper needs a lot of love. I've heard Trapper mains say he shouldn't start with all his traps because that'll be OP. Personally I would like to see some effect of his traps opening on their own, not every 30 seconds like the Iridescent Stone, more so every 2 or so minutes one opens. Also instead of him starting with all his traps, you could place "Trapper bags" around the map near to him that contain 2 or 3 traps each so he doesn't have to trek the entire map just to get all his traps.
---
The game loads ? 
---
Wait a minute there, Not so fast buddy
---
New deliverance buff ‚Äî the hook does not progress to the next time if you slip out. Additionally, you have a 30/60/90percent chance of getting off the hook if you get captured. Although, you become exposed for 2 minutes after your hook escape
---
clown chasing survivor in a skimpy bikini 
---
It‚Äôs not about the BP. It‚Äôs about sending s message.
---
Mercy is a mistake...
---
That sounds better than my idea
---
Maybe the killer can't attack while disguised, he can fast vault crouch and even repair gens (without making progress, the bar will stay at the same place it is) but he will do a not so loud sound when nearby, like very small bells ringing, and if he wants to attack he would have to wait for the timer to end counting the 30 seconds or will have to do a small animation (like wraith's bell) to go back to his killer form
---
Gotta be honest man I find Brutal Strength to largely be a waste of a slot.  It encourages you to stop and break every pallet midchase which is a horrible idea since you're just giving them free reign to position themselves at the next looping area.  Enduring I like because your recovery is so fast the stun doesn't matter and you stay right on their ass.  I only break pallets that can be reused against me by that survivor midchase, the rest I break after downing.
---
I heard a suggestion once that they rework Small Game to incorporate a totem counter. I think that would be perfect, because it would be balanced around needing to use a perk slot. Plus it might make Small Game more appealing at high ranks. 
---
Welcome to the brotherhood, of those who fell victim to claudette/nea teammates
---
Holy shit, this looks like it took a while... How long did it take?
---
You are very right on plague being boring, you just get puked on and downed right after, its just boring and annoying to deal with because you‚Äôre just constantly cleansing yourself, I always just kind of turn into a baby survivor when I go against a plague because playing against them just isn‚Äôt as fun as like a myers or hillbilly. 
---
At least they're communicating with the community. Thanks for posting 
---
Most useful against tier 1 Myers. You just leave if you know they‚Äôre gonna go one direction and loop even more 
---
What perk is that? Seems OP
---
Oh fuck off, I can point to a thousand upvoted comments about some dude dressing up as Myers and some gay dude saying very similar things and getting highly upvoted. 
---
Knockout is kind of taboo, though 
---
I don't remember the killer's perk 
---
Actually this is more of a detriment to the team than you think. A survivor who is overly aggressive with the killer is one less survivor pumping out generators. And usually these survivors arent all that good at protecting the weaker links since they can only do so much to draw your attention. Just ignore these survivors and go after others, and make it clear that just because they're good it doesnt mean their teammates are.
---
Spine Chill is sooo good. I use it on my Dwight rn 
---
Honestly I think what people find annoying about The Plague is the deceptiveness of the vomit. I haven't quite figured out the range before it hits so i can use dead hard. Face camping is just the result of someone not knowing how to play/play effectively with the killer or just because they are for some reason salty.
---
How does a sweater stun Jason? Do you flash him?
---
Moonwalking legion is the best
---
I think Trap daddy needs more love than the three above him.
---
And Thicc Boi main here. Whenever I play a Clown they don't play him correctly. He lacks map pressure so you have to end chases quickly. The issue is a lot of Clowns use the wrong perks and don't understand bottle placement. You either needs perks that help find survivors (but I find those to be a waste) or perks that boost him even more in the chase (now we're talking). Meanwhile bottle placement in tricky but if you know how to play killer it's really not that hard. Understand survivor pathing and you're good to go. They're aren't too many Clowns out there that understand his power.
---
Kinda shocked this wasnt always a thing
---
I know you meant ‚Äúderanked‚Äù survivors, but your autocorrect made me chuckle. It‚Äôs not wrong. 
---
Double engraving billy is faster
---
The part about "adding 2-3 lines of code" is BS. I didn't work at a game dev studio like OP, but I did work at a software house - developing a mobile app, much simpler than a game like DBD. Adding small features to that was not a matter of single digit lines of code. It had to be checked against *everything* that might be involved with it, it had to be thought through, implemented, and inevitably bugfixed. This all takes time, and in a high pressure enviroment like an overloaded game studio, I imagine there are much more immediately pressing concerns. Not to mention that the process is undoubtedly much more complex. 
---
I agree wit the rest of your post, but I just couldn't let that part slide. The devs are in a really tricky situation, and I don't envy them at all - the least I can do is not scream at them constantly.
---
Never swing through pallets. If you swing through pallets I will ruin your game. 
---
Pretty sure tru3 is rank 1 in both. took him a bit longer to get rank 1 im survivor. But thats the point of this system is to spread out the players among the ranks. half the people that were rank 1 aren't good enough to get there with the harder system. 
---
Great idea!
---
The animation part I def agree with. Idk bout the 3seconds over thing tho lol. Depending on add ons and survivor items that could let survivors get way ahead.
---
What about new DS? 
---
That is why I said "In my personal experience". It is rare I have a David in my lobby, let alone one who  is an imbecile lol. It be Jake for me.
---
Don't you love Mobile?
---
I NEVER REALLY CARED FOR RANKS, TO BE HONEST, BUT WITH THE NEW SYSTEM IT'S JUST BAD. I'M ALREADY GETTING MATCHED WITH RED RANK KILLERS 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES SINCE THEY REVERTED THE NEW MATCHMAKING, SO I'M DEPIPPING AND THEN I'M RANKED WITH KILLERS THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND DC ALMOST EVERY TIME.
---
Just because you're the last one alive doesn't mean you did well. Sometimes it just means you licked the walls the most.
---
And heavens to betsy, a perk not being able to be used to its fullest extent in DbD? Say it isn't so! There certainly aren't ANY other perks that are disabled or rendered useless within the first 30 seconds of a game or made pointless by other perks. 
---
Honestly there is something satisfying about slugging someone who has been hiding all game, letting the 3rd person completely die, and then finally hooking them and watching them get insta-gibbed by Spider-God-Man
---
You need to get iridescent in at least 3 of the categories which is pretty dumb when two of them revolve around your team and how good they do.
---
Don't have much to add besides co-signing all of the above. My soul aches for people who move to F13 from DBD due to balance.
---
Brutal Strength is pretty terrible
---
NO NO NO NO, I will quit dbd if this is real. I don‚Äôt want to play with Asian players, I wanna play against Europeans! Wtf is this!!!
---
He can die, i hate legion and other people do to
---
Hmmmmm
---
I call this super saiyan 3.
---
I wear the white sweater that has the scarf, the 4500 shard one, dont charity case ;_; 
---
That‚Äôs why the other solution would be to just award something like ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù, give 1500-2000 survival points, and kill them. Because if someone lasts without getting hooked once to the end of the game, then they managed to outlast the killer in some respect (Running, sneaking, or hiding), and should get something for that
---
Killers dodging is literally limbo and I don't know how you can say "since you can quickly re-queue to get another match." Do you understand how frustrating it is to finally( sometimes after 5-10 minutes) get into a game and then have the killer be like "no, these people aren't walking potatoes" and leave. 
---
To then have to leave the lobby it puts you in, wait 5 seconds cause you just left a lobby, invite your friends, search for a game for about another 5-10 minutes, and have this process repeat until you finally run into someone.
---
Other note I've had hundreds of games at this point where someone cleanses the killers totem and they DC immediately. At least if a survivor DC's everyone else still has the chance to play. A killer DC ruins that for everyone else. So killers need to be the ones punished harder, and to me that isn't debatable. 
---
He's definitely far above average, but he just gets shit on for having bad games because he's a public figure. 
---
Lmao thats what you get for playing freddy
---
The reason the killer wandered away is because they knew you can't  get off at that point. If it wasn't the way it currently is, you still would have zero chance at escape, except now they're face hugging you.
---
Killers get *all* the breaks, you see.
---
^Oop, ^pardon ^me, ^here's ^my ^free ^escape ^hatch ^since ^my ^team ^did ^shit. ^Deuces!
---
Nah even if I knew they'd bm I still wouldn't have played it any differently.  If I accept that kill that's survivor killer coop and I don't cheat ever.  She ended up being a piece of shit but regardless she has to live with the fact that her 3 man swf got destroyed by a Wraith.
---
I really have a hard time using those three together, can you give an example?
---
Lol, had this the other day. Claudette morphed into a gigantic psychidellic Meg. 
---
You only got one red badge, you need at least 2 or 3 I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs not impossible it‚Äôs just challenging. 
---
WAIT TIME UNKOWN
---
It‚Äôs so helpful, it puts the new DS to shame now lol
---
&gt; "But but only survivors r toxic!!"
---
No one says this.
---
It's almost always shit like "well this happens to [other side] too!"
---
*blip* ü§≠
---
Sorry, I just found that funny - in a cute way :3
---
Is this your attempt at reverse psychology so you can trick killers into allowing you to continue looping them lol?
---
Game has never been region locked, idk what youre talking about
---
Yesterday I was getting game in no time (I'm rank 12, that's why) but today I have to wait 10 minutes to find a lobby with 1 person and then mora 10 minutes to finally full the lobby with a shit ping killer, wtf
---
Completely agree, there's no reason not to have both. 
---
Bad internet? Here's a 15 minute cooldown to go fix it. Still shit? Here, have 30. Or an hour.
---
Bet those "net" problems would clear up real fuckin' quick.
---
Ive played Clown a total of twice so I cant really weigh in on that, you could be very well right here. If I had to guess I would assume it might have something to do with the fact that the Clown shuts down loopers really hard and Ive never relied on that to survive. I prefer good old misdirection and hiding during chases.
---
Been waiting for lithe forever. 
---
Un-fun aspects of the game like your teammate DC'ing like a little bitch and fucking 3-4 other people over?
---
No, he gets shit on because he has a huge ego and complains about everything, he is also a sore loser.
---
 and makes sure to call himself non-toxic even though he is the most passive-aggressive public figure I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
I used to be a subscriber back when he actually enjoyed this game, now you can tell he does it for a living and is bored and frustrated with dbd.
---
And no, he‚Äôs not far above average. He‚Äôs an average rank 1 killer, you‚Äôll get to the red ranks one day you‚Äôll know what I mean.
---
If they release a killer that mimics survivors I want the tell to look like glitch or lag. It's naturally occurring in game and if you aren't in a 4man swf lobby it makes you hesitant to interact or be around other survivors. Mind game to the max, figuring out who to trust. 
---
"Why do pallets only drop from scumbag Hillbillies who will just treat them like trash break them? Why won't any pallets drop for a nice guy like me, I respect every pallet and would never hurt them! My (blood)lust is so hard to hold back, but I still do it and hope that some day a pallet will acknowledge me and drop for me. But no. All pallets only want jobless bad boys who will break them with their brutal chad-strenght and give them no respect. It's disgusting. I hope that some day society will be fixed!" -Leatherface, probably. 
---
Flashlight macro bug is back.   Ran into a streamer who was using it to crash killers last night.  Assholes like that need a hardware ban.
---
Woah! People still respect pallets?! The only time you should respect a pallet if you‚Äôre playing super pallet kicker Wraith with double shadow dance and Brutal Strength.

I‚Äôm more just salty that I was 1,500 points away from a perfect game and still only got 1 blip. It makes no sense to me I can do so much and be rewarded for it.
---
I agree. Direct Bitter Murmur counter.

---
Yeah you‚Äôre right . But ignoring them will result to body blocking , sabotaging the hooks and cover their friend scratch marks with theirs so i lose track on the injured one.
---
to be fair Lissandra-abusers all deserve a beating so I don't see your point. 
---
Just a short comic about Anna and Evan, Herman, Susie and Michel. Btw, "The Addams Family" is one of my favorite movie. Oh, it would be great if Wednesday Addams join in DBD game as a KILLER! 
---
How was this not a thing already? Regardless, maybe I'll finally stop finding back to back 600 ping connections from China
---
"ew legion lol"
---
The thing that gets me about Trapper is that you basically have to spend the first genny worth of time walking around the map picking up and placing traps before his power even becomes relevant. It would be a good buff I think to be able to pick up more than one trap at once.
---
Yain‚Äôt shit famüò¥
---
That's his whole power, stopping loops. Most survivors aren't good at stealth so solid strategy. With his lack of map pressure he really needs to find people quickly. The weakness can be tough but for me he's so fun to play.
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt matter how many points you get unfortunately. They need to fix the ranking system ASAP
---
Ok in that case it‚Äôd be bs lol
---
Do you mean slow vaults, without sound cue to killer or medium vaults?
---
This is so relatable holy shiiiiit
---
R5 Survivor and R1 killer, killer isn't a problem right now, it's actually fine.
---
He went after 3-4 games over to Mortal Combat and didn't look happy at the end of the DBD stream.
---
Nothing feels better as Legion than tagging my first person and running to the next person only to hear my first victim panic drop a random pallet. I like to cancel frenzy and just nod at them. 
---
‚ÄúYou. I like you.‚Äù
---
Cuz with the DS rework, they now don't have any LUL
---
Said the Claudette 4 secs before DCing
---
He wastes a lot of time in game doing that. Unlike hag, he can't relocate his setup mid game if all gens get done on the side of the map in which he did set up, granted I'm no Trapper main so maybe I play him a bit wrong. But being able to set up a bit quicker would be huge for him.
---
So long as killers dont lose points for being close to the hook on the final survivor.
---
/r/nicekillers
---
I don't get why people keep talking about bloodpoints and using it as reference to why they should pip or double pip. I mean, come on... its 2019, people shouldn't be this dumb, should they? 
---
I'll try to explain. 
---
If you COOP a generator, you will earn a shitton of bloodpoints in **objective** category but only half value of emblem points. If you COOP two generators you will most likely max out your **objective points** but you will be lucky to have a silver lightbringer. The rest of Lightbringer points you get for cleansing a hex totem or opening an exit gate.
---
If you farm your teammates and they go down instantly, you will still keep those bloodpoints but lose emblem progress. 
---
If you are chased for 5 generators, you will get 8.000 bloodpoints in **boldness** but being chased isn't the same as completely evading the killer and therefore, winning a chase. In order to get points in Evader emblem you need to **EVADE** the killer, not get chased for X minutes. 
---
Your screenshot doesn't prove shit because just as easy I have multiple games at the same rank where I double pipped **as survivor** and my screenshots also doesn't prove shit. 
---
Double pipping is hard and it should be. Ranking up is still fairly easy but it requires work. People got used to AFKing in corners and walking out with a pip every game. 
---
I think making totem counter baseline is better. SwF already have that information for free, why shouldn't solos?
---
You could be on to something here... Im going to try this
---
I imagine survivors frothing at the mouth, strangling the generators in a vice grip, furiously trying to squeeze out any points they can.
---
They can't change it.
---
They still give no reason to give the last survivor the "attempt to escape" because once the Patch Notes come out all killers will be notified that the last survivor can still try to escape and so they won't leave you. It's useless. So stop trying to fix things which don't need fixing.
---
Honestly it's fun, I've all but switched from a killer main to enjoying surv much more and I'll be damned if I don't bm the shit out of a camping or noed killer
---
survivors: *does the objective*
---
killers: omg nerf survivors they popped 3 gens because i wasnt applying pressue
---
You can call it what you want, I‚Äôll call it what I want
---
You know it gets harder to rank as you move up? Like the bars required to safety, pip, and double pip are further up the progress bar as you go. So its not hard at 10 doesnt mean its not hard in the red ranks. 
---
Rebecca &amp; Sophie ugh gay icons 
---
Nope it's true. Respecting pallets is bad. Swinging through pallets is often bad as well. Alot of the time if the survivor doesn't drop the pallet when you swing they can get another loop. 
---
I don't think this is a concern because this community cannot actually get any more toxic than it already is.
---
funny how it use to be, well at least back in 2016-2017, they used steam region setting for matchmaking.  People who to bypass it by changing their DL region.  Tricky dicky
---
New feature so you don't get bored while struggling on the hook.
---
/s
---
Hahahahaha üòÇ yep 
---
Adding to this, I think this will be settled between supernatural killers - Freddy, Myers, Spirit, possibly Hag. The rest is just slightly modified humans, no match for an intangible dream killer or an invincible superhuman badass.
---
Freddy is problematic because he can't hurt others outside of his dream world, and others can't hurt him (assuming the supernaturals don't need to sleep). So I will make like the devs, and forget about him.
---
Myers is super tough, super strong, and lives only to kill.  
---
 Spirit shares that last part, and possibly the first? She's undead, so might not actually be possible to harm her.   
---
Hag, as seen in her mori animation, can be freakishly quick, and her talons are sharp enough to effortlessly disembowel a person. But with her weak, twisted stature, she seems more like an ambush predator than a fighter - so I'm guessing she loses to anyone in a fight.
---
So, since the big three (Freddy, Myers, Spirit) would have tremendous difficulty killing each other, I choose to believe they'd all eventually stop maiming each other and go for ice cream. The real question is, what flavours would they choose?
---
It's his mom's sweater, so you use it to pretend to be her (even though she was a elderly blonde woman and you're a [teenager with purple hair](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyIv-VX8lTA/maxresdefault.jpg)) for a few seconds.
---
You know we can tell which hits will land and which ones won't right?  If the alternative you're suggesting is us to respect pallets so you can get an extra 3 loops per pallet you're not fooling anyone here man.  I wasn't born yesterday. 
---
then you most likely understand this community all to well :D
---
100% agree. I'm sure BHVR has ways to see if a player didn't load in because of a loading screen error, so such people shouldn't be penalized I'll leave them out of this.
---
But for the rest..
---
The bad internet excuse for DCing is the extreme minority. The overwhelming majority of survivors DC because they don't like when they've been outplayed. The rest DC because they don't like the killer. And such people should be penalized extremely hard. 
---
I would base it over a 72 hour window just to be sure. 15 minutes ban for the first DC (that isn't internet related/bug related). 60 mins ban for second DC within 72 hours (that isn't internet related/bug related). 12 hours ban for the third DC (that isn't internet related/bug related), 1 day ban for the fourth DC (that isn't internet related/bug related). 3 days ban for the fifth DC (that isn't internet related/bug related). 
---
Upon returning from the 3 days ban, you have 15-day probation period where if you DC once you'll get a 7-day ban. 3 7-day bans in a year? Permabanned.
---
People want to talk about camping and tunneling, but DCing is a worse problem and it needs to be fixed immediately. Nothing destroys a game like DCing because it destroys it for everyone, not just yourself.
---
Upon returning from the 7-day ban, you get a another 15-day probation period. If you get three 7-day bans over the course of a month, you'll be perma-banned. 
---
Just a short comic about Anna, Herman, Evan, Susie and Michael. Btw, "The Addams Family" is one of my favorite movie. It would be so great if "Wednesday Adams" join in DBD game as a KILLER! 
---
Do you have other pics like this? Its for school 
---
"Just go to sleep, bitch!"
---
*maniacal laughter*
---
Pretty much how I imagine that'd go.
---
But points dont correspond to doing well. For example, if you're killer and you get a lot of points in the chase category you had an extremely drawn out chase because the longer a chase lasts as killer the more bp you get out of it when it ends (just using it as an example)
---
Thank you!!!
---
Hah. that was me last night trying to play with no sound. So much harder
---
YES!
---
You can figure out that playstyle quick though and in that scenario you simply continue chasing them and get a free hit on them since you called their read.  Either way that still is you not respecting pallets it just means you're hitting them mid loop instead of at the pallet.
---
What broken perks lol? New DS?
---
Adrenaline and balanced landing are the strongest survivor perks, both dont hold a grain to NOED that can single handedly win a game for a killer.
---
Survivors love to frame this as "they are too good let them go" but the real problem is they have control in the chase; they are going to the looping areas, they know where it's safe to run and where it isn't etc. If you can get a hit and have them drop a couple pallets and watch them run away from gens, call it good and go to fresh gens to chase others away. 
---
It's way easier to hit a survivor working on a gen then one who is in a good looping area. Approach a gen from a direction that cuts off their ability to get to a good loop and you'll be surprised at how easy it is to down a good looper. 
---
Trick is to respect the first couple and then stop respecting them. 
---
Doing a generator together gives more points than doing one alone, but doing them by yourself helps the team more and gives you a better emblem
---
It is a Claudette totem
---
Freddy.
---
Despite being shit in game he can wait everyone else out. By DbD cannon he doesn‚Äôt have to wait to force people to sleep he can do it himself where he is immortal
---
That would be fine if there were just one doing the body blocking. Most of the time its more than one. And by the time you hit the last one body blocking you will drop the one you‚Äôre carrying. 
---
So that‚Äôs a yes on the flashing?
---
Lmaooooo I‚Äôm dead üòÇ
---
It's also pointless, because Legion's base power does what Infectious Fright does, but better. So no point in using that.
---
Plague is fucking weak as shit, you're just not used to playing against her. She's like a Walmart huntress, honestly just figure out counterplays before calling her boring.
---
Killer was a nurse. Let's just say we all got slugged and hooked in literally 2 minutes. 
---
This. I hate when it happens, but it never happens twice in one loop. If you do it once you‚Äôll do it again. And I may not respect the pallet, but I will not whiff again. 
---
I mean, she's killed platoons of soldiers armed with machine guns by herself.
---
Unless it's someone like Freddy or Michael, who have problem with death, she could probably take them.
---
I play survivor with No Mither and hope i die fast. I run around leaving sprint marks, i use hook perks like slippery meat and the one that destroys hooks off of save. And i think its Up The Ante for more luck. But honestly that build doesnt help me much. I've noticed i gain and much pips as i lose match to match but thats what i do.
---
I KNOW RIGHT? I DIDNT CARE IF I MATCHED UP AGAINST PLAYERS WELL BEYOND MY RANK. JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME AS MUCH AS I WANT! 
---
NOW ITS BACK TO 3+ MINUTE LOBBIES, WHAT AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE BEHAVIOR!!!
---
Depends on the loop. A long loop sure you will get a hit, a shorter loop they can get back to the pallet in time and drop it on you. It's something to consider.
---
Ahhhh this is amazing! Nice one 
---
Agreed I usually respect the first pallet by default on every new survivors first chase just to see how they play it.  Mixing it up is important for both sides.  But you know the killers I'm trying to help here.  Way too many respect all pallets by default which is just the worst way to play a chase against a strong survivor.
---
No he blew up because you said "I will take it to a level I dont want to go to" like what? What the fuck are you gonna do? Not to mention this whole post is fucking dumb because you act like youre writing to them when you're writing to a portion of the DbD community lol.
---
Sucks you didnt get your shit right away.  It will be handled in time. This post ain't doing nothing for your cause. 
---
Ik im late to this but [tfw your maymay gets kinda stolen](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b45umi/legion_too_op)
---
Well yeah she is not real, She is from a video game...
---
Noed is very strong thats true .but you can easily counter it if you do totems and not gen rush. 
---
Somebody's triggered
---
Thanks for posting the 97273rd matchmaking post. We REALLY need more of these. Each one helps.
---
Literally slow vaults, like mid chase my character decides to slowly walk over the edge of it 
---
Had a Billy call me a 'sweaty survivor main' for not dropping pallets when he respected them and revved the saw. He had Enduring. God forbid he eat that one second stun, poor guy'd rather let me loop him for five minutes.
---
Or it's because the survivors have only two tools to defend themselves with, windows and pallets, and she entirely ignores both mechanics. You can't even pallet stun her during a blink. The survivors are force to only play in areas where they can lose line of sight. Even then they are buying themselves a chance that the nurse will miss. The best a survivor can do against nurse is to change a guaranteed down into a guessing game.  
---
I'm not opposed to killers being powerful, but I do think that Nurse's addons remove all meaningful weaknesses from her kit. There are no other killers that allow you to make anywhere near as many mistakes, and still come out victorious. You don't need to aim for the skill ceiling on nurse, you can 4k as long as you hit the skill floor.
---
Mine went from 4 min to about 20 seconds altho it's back to being a problem when theres 3 survivors trying to find 1 more. still way better overall
---
Hold shift harder and press space harder /s
---
"Balanced" Landing ^^^JK
---
So if there's multiple people body blocking that means there is a max person of 1 person on gens and you get free hits, easy downs, and slow generator progression so how is this a bad thing? You might drop the person you're carrying but now you have 3 people that are 1 hit downs. And besides, before you pick up a survivor you should be scouting out the hooks anyways in case survivors do get in your way you can just turn around and do hook them on another one that you'll get to first.
---
I almost got this, just needed one more survivor to do it but the stupid Claudette ran off üò©
---
She's got a meme to live up to man.  Unhooking you ruins her reputation. 
---
Spirit would get Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Myers would get plain Vanilla and then stare at until it melted, and Freddy would [make himself a pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/fyhdU4ADvbLva/giphy.gif).
---
 You can get points as survivor by breaking totems, saboing hooks, opening chest, sitting in basement, standing next to the killer. All of which do not help your team towards escaping, but okay
---
Man they sure fucked things up. I remember all the hype to the game, and people getting mad that streamers first found a way to kill Jason. Lucky for me and never bought the game.
---
\*X-files music plays\*
---
The game is buggy. You kinda have to accept that if you're playing DBD. It's definietly got better from where it started but the odd ones are still out there
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art :) 
---
I'd say she's on par with The Spirit which is good and the vomiting on survivors is very satisfying. Even if they are waiting for you at the exit gates. Last night I had a cocky Kate that was waiting flicking her flashlight outside the gate and I hit her with my vile purge injuring her. She then proceeded to go inside closer to the escape and flick a few more times and I hit her again with my vile purge knocking her down and was able to pick her up and hook her. So good.
---
The Temp Quintin not able to voice his opinion 
---
Not sure because I don't recall any fps cap option in the dbd settings. I leave the 'Auto-adjust' option off if that's what you are referring to.
---
However just yesterday I played a game and had horrendous unplayable framerate issues(literally &lt;20fps) and I have no idea why since I haven't changed any settings since before then. And of course I try asking this sub for help and my post got immediately removed(thanks, reddit, glad I can always count on you)
---
The only thing that annoys me is IF I HAD TRIED THAT STUN AT THE END THE KILLER WOULD HAVE HIT ME! I hate this game, but good job on the escape.
---
EVERY CLOWN I EVER GO AGAINST, WITH NO EXCEPTIONS, RUNS EBONY MORI. WHAT THE HELL CLOWNS. 
---
ALSO, AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SEE GENS, HEX TOTEMS, AND ANY OTHER AURAS ON MOUNT ORMOND? WTF BEHAVIOR? FIX!!!!
---
Activate Windows
---
I think it's quite clear from his crying that he's one of them. 
---
On the bright side, 4 more killers will be in by the time you're done installing.
---
And you're an idiot. Guess we're even.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a hit box issue that was an internet issue 
---
Then it's the killer's fault for not taking out the weakest link first. If the killer goes for the flashlight-clicking P3 Nea first then he deserves to lose, a good killer will not waste time with the looper.
---
Also I never said survivor isn't easier than killer, I said bad killers shouldn't be rewarded for playing badly, same as bad survivors shouldn't win.
---
She is in a different league than the other killers. If a nurse is good enough she can eliminate counterplay. Mostly its the addons that enable this, but her kit is pretty stacked as it is.
---
I got adept on accident and rank one with freddy
---
It won't. You'll whiff through the pallet. You'll assume i'm going to drop it, but I won't. 
---
Well how old are you? If you're 16+ I don't see a reason why wouldn't be allowed to play an M rated game in your own room. Unless there's only 1 console and it's in the living room.
---
On who‚Äôs side though? The killers was a steady 180 ping. I‚Äôm wired so I don‚Äôt have any excuses as to why I‚Äôd lag.
---
spirit fury is easily countered, just throw down the pallet early
---
Nah I never wait longer than a minute or two for a game on PS4
---
Not really. He just wanted to mori her at a different position because doing it near the hook will make the animation look dumb.
---
You never know what his intentions are, maybe he's just done this for the sake of making a montage or something.
---
A flashlight macro to my knowledge is basically where a survivor can use a keyboard or mouse macro to click the flashlight so many times in a short period of time it can potentially have a killer disconnect and thus everyone else 
---
Hehehaha weston this is a funne you have the smart laughy memey haha so rel8able
---
You're telling people to swing through pallets. That's baby killer shit. I don't believe you're a good killer.
---
Because SWF is the exception, not the rule.

&gt; If every game is ranked there are no ranked games
---
Or ranked is the only mode? People talk enough about their rank for it to be relevant, regardless of the rewards (or lack thereof).
---
Different people like doing different things. Streamers do a variety of things to make it interesting for their viewers. As a player it's up to you to decide what you find fun. If a player's version of fun is getting good at the powerful characters and reaching/staying at rank 1 while winning most of their matches then that's what they should do.
---
bad Survivors be like...
---
I get hit through a pallet once!
---
NERF KILLERS
---
&gt; There‚Äôs 2 insta heals. Syringe (iridescent pink rarity) heals 2 health states but a styptic agent (purple rarity) heals 1 health state. They might have had the Styptic Agent then?

You know both can heal 1 health state right? 
---
What‚Äôs the deal with Silent Hill anyway?
---
Wow thanks for the advice, I'll def have to try it. I always seem to suffer on loops, Escpecially when they run around shacks.
---
Yes but OP only stated they didn‚Äôt see a Syringe. I thought I would mention there‚Äôs a second one in case that was there.

The whole game is just fucked, there's no way of balancing it when someone with 1500 hours can be a rank 17 nurse or 3 friends with several hundred hours each can sit in voice comms while playing against a baby wraith. Whenever I want to play a normal build I run into SWF and then when I put on Ruin to slow down gens I of course get the actual newbies who will all die before a single gen is done.
---
Uh maybe vs low skilled loopers, if you respect pallets you will get looped for ages and lose the game. Why risk it when you can just take the pallet out of the equasion for ever. Imo theres only one way to play around simple pallet loops, W until the pallet is dropped and broken, if you respect it they might move to another structure and now there are 2 loops for you to work around. 99% of the time its a misplay to respect the pallet. Or take the right approach, run enduring and respect absolutely nothing swing thru everything 
---
Jesus dude...there are so many times it makes complete sense to swing through the pallet it's not even funny.  A good killer can tell when it makes sense to do so or when it makes sense to continue chasing through it which completely counters your strategy by the way which you haven't acknowledged.  I've played the game for years, rank 1 every month, I know what I'm doing.  I don't have to try and convince an obviously toxic survivor of my merit lol.  You can think what you want I won't lose sleep over it but I wreck survivors like you all the time.
---
Hey I wanna swim in pussy how do I do that? 
---
How many memes you gonna do in one day?
---
But if I cleanse totems that means that I can't rush my opponent out of the match....doesn't seem like a good solution, they should just remove it. 
---
If they had even a remote ability to see where everyone was during the games and what they were doing, you wouldn't need video evidence for half the reports. 
---
They do that already. 
---
Leatherface mains just came so hard because of this picture.
---
Fuckin' mad lad.
---
Jesus xD In Polish version of the game now, Thanatophobia slows donw survivors' movement speed xD
---
You just listed exactly why Ruin is so prevelent, not only does it slow progress thru regression, it eliminates the 2% bump from normal great checks. Gens get wrecked immediately. 
---
After the last patch buffing tier 1 &amp; 2, the devs also reworked spawn positions removing the forced locations on many maps the Koreans discovered. The result is Ruin is better than ever, and it wont go anywhere until the Devs powercreep an alternative, or address gen mechanics. 
---
The Internet was a mistake
---
I thought this was going to be a good change but the queue times have tripled lol
---
Oh there's still a fun game somewhere in all that mess, but it's a lot harder to find now then it ever was and anyone who is leaving DbD for F13 and expecting to find an easier and more intuitive game is in for a nasty shock.
---
No this one was just a standard blank body and head 
---
Brought to by Survivor Main gang
---
IDK how people are having such a hard time accepting that people want BPs. You all definitely have found other ways to waste time lmao. Killers included. Yes, not going to the exit gate to smack the teabagging survivors because you're a softie who didn't get to murder a bunch of people  is wasting time.
---
You're telling people to swing through pallets. I don't believe you're a good killer at all. Your cited credentials are pretty basic too, but whatever makes you proud dude lol.
---
I think this update was a great idea. Now when I play as survivor I always get lobbies with 60-80 ping. Thank you BHVR
---
I'M GONNA GET A LOT OF HATE FOR THIS, BUT I GET MORE ANNOYED DEALING WITH SURVIVORS WHO SUICIDE ON FIRST HOOK/DC THAN I DO WITH FACING LEGION.  I THINK WE'VE ALREADY JAMMED IT INTO EVERYONE'S HEADS INCLUDING THE DEVS THAT LEGION IS NOT A FAIR KILLER AT ALL, BUT AT LEAST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PLAY THE DAMN MATCH.  TO HAVE PEOPLE RAGE QUIT NOT EVEN 30 SECONDS INTO THE GAME AFTER WAITING SO LONG TO EVEN GET INTO ONE REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS.
---
It's not, that has been an issue since the day I started playing, over a year ago. Sure nowadays a rank 1 nurse will not be thrown back to rank 17 or sth, but you only need to stop playing for basically 1 month and 1 day to go back to that rank. Not to mention that boosting/smurfing is a thing and if you really wanted to you could always change your rank with SAM. Or make a new account and family share.
---
You‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúrust up‚Äù. What you described here is an acquired skill. You‚Äôre not just going to forget how to hit great skill checks. This is how games work when you pour hours into them. Your logic is flawed. I would hope that high rank survivors or survivors in general would eventually learn how to hit greats constantly, ruin or not.
---
You have to manually uncap it in the config file. Which is stupid but takes all of 2 min. You can also turn vsync off which could hurt your fps. What are your PC specs? 
---
Yup 
---
Spirit's story is tragic and would be great to see. 
---
Clown's is scary and I like the idea of him taking a giant carnival with him everywhere. 
---
can y‚Äôall add me too? i don‚Äôt really enjoy playing by myself. my psn name is jim_halpert420
---
As a killer main, trust me if you try out killer, 95 percent of the time there is one guy who will waste pallets by dropping them early during a chase. Find them and make them waste most of pallets and you will be fine. Either that or play trapper with bloody coil or iridescent stone, or play hag with that one add on that gives your phantasms collision, and start trapping loops immediately. You could also play huntress for obvious reasons, clown to block of loops and slow people down, or just play nurse because nurse is the best for countering loops. Or you can just get good at mind games like the rest of us, there is no excuse for getting looped, other than admitting you don't know what you are doing. 
---
I also told them twice in back to back comments you refused to acknowledge exactly how to beat your strategy lol.  But it's obvious you only came here to be toxic and attempt to flex.  We're done here I'm not feeding the troll anymore 
---
If the points are next to nothing then don't give a Quitter Bonus to killers for survivors who DC.
---
Youre sitting there wondering why and I just told you. Im guessing you did a bunch of totems to get your obj points maxed without getting red lightbringer but again its clear what gets you to rank up whether you want to ignore it or not is up to you. 
---
Reinstalling the game won't reset your progress, nor will it erase any purchases you've made. Those are tied directly to your account.
---
Only seen a few of his streams but he is definitely not modest. On those few streams he kept saying he has an analytic mind, i was like ok dude we get it.
---
Don't. Please just loop around that pallet. 
---
&gt;you refused to acknowledge exactly how to beat your strategy lol
---
Because it's not a strategy, it's a read. There's no "strategy" to respecting and swinging through pallets, it's simply a read. A read that you've already overlooked the minute you started telling people to swing through pallets. I don't care how butt hurt you are, I know you're not a good killer lol.
---
I think, just speaking about NOED here, it shouldn't be a free thing. Slap a token counter on it and have everything swing you take deduct 1 token. Maybe even give additional bonuses (BP and movement speed/etc.) for each token spent on a connecting hit. That way NOED would actually mean something and only a good killer could take advantage of it. Whiff a swing and uh oh, 1 token out of 3 or 4 is gone. It would be a buff while also being a nerf for bad players and a nerf to the spammability of the perk. If you miss too bad, but if you hit you gain 1 hook victim as well as additional bonuses.
---
Thanks. Now to wait the 12 hours for the game to download lol
---
I have no idea what is going on with this game anymore 
---
"Survivors fall for basic killer mind games"
---
"Nerf killers"
---
See, it goes both ways.
---
Lol go edge somewhere else lord.
---
I'm sorry I downvoted you, I just realised that you have very valid reasoning 
---
I'm much more concerned that with that matchmaking system I was waiting upwards of 30-40mins to play rank 15s despite knowing my rank 1 friends were looking to play against me...
---
Are they going to talk about that at all? 
---
It's the same on both sides. If the survivors win they are a 4 man toxic SWF, even if they are 4 solo players. On the other hand, I've been in games where a guy dies on hook and the killer gets accused of camping, even though they were chasing me in the complete opposite corner of the map. For the most part, people just want to complain.
---
Before he goes sausage on those survivors?
---
You need more momentum or run up distance. But sometimes the game registers it as a slow vault so it‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Yep, it's real bad now. I just gave up after waiting for a survivor queue for 3-5 minutes, getting into a lobby and then waiting forever for it to never fill the last spot or two. Yesterday was great, got into queues no problem as both Killer and Survivor, so I'm not sure why they reverted the changes.
---
True true.
---
What was wrong with it the first time you posted?
---
You told them to swing through pallets, that's all you said, now you're back tracking because you realize your advice was terrible.
---
&gt;You're just a toxic survivor with no understanding of playing killer and that is painfully obvious.
---
Little boy, I said it already, I'm a _much_ better killer than you are. By a long shot. I don't go whiffing through pallets like you do. I play more killer than I do survivor, but I'm more known for my survivor.
---
For some reason if I‚Äôm the last surv Alive I kms because my heart rate goes up by like 200
---
The big problem is that there isn‚Äôt a real different ‚Äúantibiotic‚Äù in the game for gen rushing. Outside of being able to apply an immense amount of pressure. But if you‚Äôre that good ruin would still be good to use as it applies even more pressure, which only serves to help in case you‚Äôre against a good player who can counter pressure. 
---
I mean, Huntress turns pallets into a death sentence so you can play it both ways. 
---
Either swing through it and get them to learn that pattern then mix up with a hatchet, or start with hatchet charges as you approach the pallet and possible drop to get them to keep going for another loop in the future, and that's when you swing through instead. 
---
Reddit removed my post cuz I didn‚Äôt select a flair.
---
No Mither counters all one shot totems (Hex noed, and hex devour hope). 
---
Nurse is still the best, no question. Yes, it‚Äôs harder to master than on PC, but she still breaks the mechanics of the game. Billy and spirit just below, then Hag.
---
I would buy that
---
That's when the game suddenly stops and goes to the match results screen and you collect those delicious 3k bloodpoints

---
Most huntresses I‚Äôve played are bad and usually wind up the hatchet on nearly every lap around a loop, lol.
---
It certainly could cause issues I would recommend Googling the trick to uncap for dead by daylight as it would turn vsync off which can help.  Im not sure exactly what your specs would run as dbd is actually more intensive than some other games but you can play with the settings to get your desired Fps.  Dbd is definitely a game that doesn't look absolutely stunning regardless so pushing for high isnt worth the fps in my Opinion
---
Also, some games are more CPU intensive and some are more gpu intensive. That would be why some games you can run at high and some yyou cant. 
---
Honestly as a killer I dislike it, I would be able to go around and get so many extra points if that didn't happen. Let them struggle dammit. 
---
Camp tunnel NOED, the rookie trifecta 
---
Huntress is considered the middle of the totem killer by most players and tier lists. She is strong, but also has her fair share of weaknesses. She is by no means a bad killer, but due to her skill-cap and actually being very balanced she ends up being the poster child mid tier killer. In the right hands she is easily a god tier killer, but in the wrong hands Freddy would be better (since he‚Äôs still considered by most to be the weakest killer in the game and with fair reason)
---
They get a fat teabag and a couple points
---
I'm not backtracking on shit man.  Swinging through pallets is very smart you can tell when it makes sense to do it.  I never said seeing through EVERY pallet.  That's you putting words in my mouth.  If you don't think swinging through pallets ever makes sense you are a trash killer.  
---
Wtf Behavior, seriously?
---
WTF is going on with them.
---
If you want to be toxic:
---
Distressing/M&amp;A + Unnerving Presence + Huntress' Lullaby + Ruin and The Game offering.
---
This just seems like a watered down version of Scott's huntress guide
---
Currently there are bugs in the game that cause random DC's and infinite loading screens making players restart the game. Due to these bugs, BHVR are no longer punishing DC's because they can't tell if the DC's are happening due to poor sportsmanship or bugs. Entitled little brat survivors and killers are taking advantage of this and DC'ing En Masse because there is no repercussions. 
---
Up against a killer you don't like? DC! 
---
Got downed first? DC! 
---
Having a bad game where all of your teammates are potatoes? DC! 
---
Might lose your precious item? DC!
---
Can't catch the click-y flashlight guy before a gen is completed? DC!
---
Up against an obvious Toxic SWF group? DC!
---
Survivors brought in all flashlights + a farm map and Hook distance offerings? DC!
---
Got into a match? D-FUCKING-C!!!!
---
It wouldn't be too bad if the ranking system wasn't different now, but DC's are now actually a counter to the killers/survivors ranking progress. This is what's killing the game, and must be dealt with, but until BHVR fixes the bugs causing random DC's, we're stuck with entitled ass-hats getting their way.
---
besides all this sjw stuff it was obviously a joke . Are you new to the internet?
---
edit: people spam gachi despite beeing homophobic.
---
Bloodhound might help. It'll more than likely blend in with scratch marks but at that point you have them in a chase. Also try to rely on sound rather than sight. An injured survivor is quite easy to hear if you tune in for it. I also play on PS4 and headphones do work.
---
He kinda deserved to go down... Common sense to leave enough space, he should've stayed away , then run in-between you and the killer, not stand in the way so that there's more of a chance for them to block you.
---
&gt;Swinging through pallets is very smart 
---
Haha okay dude. Like I said, I don't believe you're a good killer. I have proof I'm a good killer/survivor. Just stop telling new players to swing through pallets and we're good.
---
Just go play civilization or something.
---
If you've waited more than 5 minutes and still haven't gotten a game, then remake the lobby. I don't understand why people wait obsurd amount of times in a clearly bugged lobby 
---
I KNOW. IT WAS JUST A JOKE ABOUT THE STATE OF THE PIPPING SYSTEM. I HAVE NO ANSWERS FOR YOUR REAL ISSUE I'M SORRY.
---
The problem that I forgot to mention is that it's a lot harder for solo players to counter it. Sure, if you have a swf of four you can easily communicate and get rid of each totem, but if you are alone, you have no way to know what totems are done. To completely null the possibility of the killer's NOED you need to go and find all five totems yourself, while hoping the other three survivors are doing the primary objectives themselves. 
---
legion is a braindead killer and fuck Frankie's when I'm plundering. 
---
you need to double pip for the adepts since they changed how emblems work
---
i play Fortnite. its the only game i can play online on Switch abd PS4
---
WHY AM I STUCK IN A THREE-SURVIVOR LOBBY PURGATORY. I JUST WANT TO DIE! LET. ME. DIEEEEE
---
I'M HATE IT. I PLAYED A FEW GAMES TODAY. I HAVEN'T BEEN BELOW RANK 10 FOR ABOUT A YEAR SO I'D FORGOTTEN HOW BAD RANK 15 SURVIVORS ARE. IT'S SO HARD TO PIP WHEN YOUR TEAMMATES HAVE NO GAME SENSE. I WAS BEING CHASED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND NOT ONE GENERATOR WAS FINISHED. NOT EVEN WITH RUIN.
---
Bad killers? this is Actually like 80% of this sub.
---
I don't think you know the amount of Truth this post holds.
---
Really?! Aw man that sucks. 
---
how do you get the legion achivement? 
---
I'm gonna give you a yes here
---
Basically the broken status effect, but not 100% sure about this idea
---
I agree, except 1000-1500 BP is too much. You usually get around 850-900 (I forget the exact amount of a full struggle in BP), but you should get that.
---
It's the game game on the same system so yes but cross platform is a no
---
Then run Small Game and be the person that takes on the responsibility of hunting down the totems. There are 4 survivors, one can use a perk slot that can help destroy several killer perks with ease.
---
Not every survivor needs to run Lithe/Adrenaline/SelfCare/Unbreakable or the like. 
---
Sweaty from all that running am I right? üëå
---
Is that for sure though? Granted it's an older game but Skate 3 had this issue.
---
I do agree that a totem counter would also be a very good idea, knowing facts like that helps lower the advantage that swf gets over solos. But to your first point, another somewhat similar perk that I consider good design, Rancor, has a very obvious way for the affected survivor to know what is coming and play against it. If you loop the killer the entire game and get hit once at the end with NOED, you actively got punished for wasting the killers time. The killer did nothing to earn it, and gains an advantage for just getting to the end game with a single totem intact.
---
&gt;I don't think the blame is unwarranted. Don't be an ass. If you're killer and see some sap get farmed, go after the jackass teammate that did it.
---
You're asking your opponent to handicap themselves on account of your teammate's mistake. The killer doesn't expect you to defer the benefits of your teammate's good plays, right? Asking them not to capitalize on their bad ones is a tough sell, the killer is your opponent, and they're trying to win as efficiently as possible. I get that nobody likes being kill rushed/tunneled but they're just doing the objective efficiently.....same as survivors when they slam gens.
---
Still learning the small tips and tricks for killer. Good to know that respecting the pallet hinders more than helps. PUT ON YOUR HARDHATS BOIS
---
I never understood Hex perk complaints, because they are so freaking easy to destroy and then the killer loses their entire use. Sure, totems can be a pain to locate at times, but there's literally a survivor perk that finds them for you. Run it, spend the first 2 minutes running around and boom, safety for the rest of the game. By which point, at least 2 gens should be done, and the killer rage quitting üòÇ
---
pretty good point but whats the difference between survivors hitting the great skill checks when there isnt ruin? why wouldnt the survivors just normally go for greats and get better at hitting them? 
---
'I did 3 gens, and got real immersed and let my teammates get chased every time the killer got near us.
---
 That Nea chased the killer for 5 minutes and I let her die on the hook, but I was never hooked, so, I deserve a free pass."
---
I can't see any problems with that logic.
---
It was in SoS a few weeks ago, have fun waiting for the next time lol
---
It's unfun to play against.
---
I uploaded it for people to skim, but thanks for your feedback; I've put it in the garbage where it belongs. 
---
How are 4 solo survivors that have no way of communicating with each other supposed to know who cleansed how many totems? 
---
Right purple, I was thinking of the pink lightbulb.
---
I mean have you ever been slugged before lol?  It's just a painfully unfun experience.  I mean play how you want but that's where they're coming from with their hate.  They're essentially just taken out of the game, there's no playing at that point.  Somehow it feels worse than sitting on a hook.  The worst is when a killer does it to go search for the last survivor to prevent a hatch spawn.  Laying on the ground for minutes at a time while the killer continues to play his game is just incredibly unfun.
---
I play mostly Myers and stay eating pallets. They can't escape
---
So many people saying nurse perks üòÇ she isn‚Äôt even dlc just spend some of your bp to get them. Such a waste, why not get cosmetics, or better yet, the dlc killers/survivors? SoS is a waste in general.
---
It pretty much takes the game away from a solo survivor, not many of the randoms I play with will go out of their way to pick someone else up. Swf it‚Äôs completely different you can actually somewhat rely on someone to pick you up.
---
He was asking for decent streamers and I gave my opinion, yeah. People have different usernames so you can see who wrote which comment.
---
Not with the hatch being a thing. 
---
&gt; That sounds like a positional problem on your end.
---
I was standing on the other end of the pallet though, directly in front while they kicked it.
---
Cuz not everyone runs that? 
---
The storm dlc
---
It's not. 
---
If it's the same game on the same system, you can play with other people playing the same game on the same system.
---
Thanks for your thoughts! I'm not deadset on this concept, I sort of just thought of the complains + the name and tried to make a balanced perk that was fairer and more rewarding to use, so I just wanted to get a good brainstorm going to get a bunch of different inputs on it so I could see what the community thought of my ideas.
---
Thanks for the time spent writing it. More detail and elaboration around maps and how to play certain scenarios would be great. 
---
Thank
---
Slugging is fine imo but only if u eventually hook the survivors. I don't mind if you wait until all four are down before hooking but simply waiting on people to bleed out is completely toxic. It prevents players from getting in a new game and they are forced to either sit there and just wait to salvage like 5k pts or just DC and take the pip losses and no bps. Just an unfun experience since you as the killer already won the match no need to prolong it.
---
im sorry but unless the hatch is like right next to the hook and you also have dead hard or the killer is stupid and hits you during iframes, then it doesn't matter if there's a hatch because you won't get anywhere and that one in a million chance is not worth dragging out every game an extra min
---
15% faster opening exit gate speed doesnt even compare to remember me's bonus 25 seconds to opening a gate
---
Nah, that‚Äôs Ron Funches 
---
Would pay to see Ricardo up there xD
---
He also plays huntress most of the time who happens to have an attack that hits over dropped pallets. 
---
I‚Äôm just going to say tier list are opinionated, imo legion is one of the top three alongside nurse and billy (even though I suck with the saw, I still see him as a strong killer) if I based it all off my own play, my list is legion, bubba, nurse/hag, doctor/trapper, Freddy, huntress/wraith, Myers, billy, pig/clown, plague (haven‚Äôt played her enough to really get her down, so she‚Äôs actually unlisted rather than worst) spirit is a bit of a wild card, if I have prayer beads she can be a lot of fun doing totem roulette, but otherwise she ranks around Myers for me. 
---
Honestly though fk tier lists, play what you like, if you get good at a killer then it‚Äôs the same as an S tier or whatever. That‚Äôs probably why legion and bubba list so high for me. They‚Äôre 2 of the three BBQ killers I have (nurse just got it but I haven‚Äôt played her much, and PS4 so the blinks are a little harsh on me lmao) 
---
Thats if he gets full tokens
---
Thanks! Planning to include more details about mind games and certain scenarios in the next part. I just wanted to give a quick introduction and not overwhelm with information right out of the gates
---
Probably was omegablink nurse with Make Your Choice and Ebony Mori or Billy with instasaw
---
Thanks, I was really confused then.
---
Cheers for all the answers, considering noones said no so far, I'm go ahead and pick up a physical copy for my friend. :)
---
lol I'd feel bad but tbh her fault for rushing into things 
---
I really hope you are joking.
---
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, much like the ruin billy is the powerhouse of the sweat lodge.

I was using my sensitive controller so that‚Äôs why the camera angle was messed upüòÇ

[It's a video.](https://youtu.be/IQRDijaX5Io) Similar info, but I appreciate your write up nonetheless. 
---
Oh! I understand now. Thank you.
---
*DEAR GOD*
---
Yeah, that's when he thought that not respecting pallets is bad cause they give the survivors easy 1k bp, which took him long enough to figure how silly that is
---
skilled huntress and deranged pursuit are really hard to get. farming helps alot :)
---
Who do you play? 
---
I guess my logic was that you have more vault opportunities on most maps as opposed to falling opportunities. 
---
The new wave of NOED dissent is intrigueing. I guess it was the next thing to complain about after Decisive Strike, but it still perplexes me how this totem's been around for *years* and it's only now being bombarded. 
---
Yes. 
---
Yup. I was R5, had a game ~2 minutes, 4K 0gens only 2 hooked 1 survivor, got safety pip minimum requirement. If I‚Äôd been one rank lower I‚Äôd have lost a pip for ending a game so quick. 
---
I'll teabag to try to draw attention if someone's being tunneled or camped something.
---
or if I'm tunneled all game and make it to the gate
---
Yup they fucked up match making for killers again. Haven't played survivor yet so idk about them. They added an arbitrary wait time to even get into a queue. Then they don't even tell us how long the queue to get in queue is.
---
Yeah it's pretty difficult now, I regret not getting the achievements before the new system 
---
Lmao I've seen many many more heavily downvoted tier lists. People actually agreed with him on that one.
---
How kind :)
---
REEEE FOR ONCE ITS NOT JUST CONSOLE, I'M WAITING AGES EVEN ON PC, HAD NO PROBLEM GETTING INTO GAMES BEFORE EVEN IF PING WAS MACABRE
---
Nice! I only need that fucking legion one.

PLAY DBD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 4 DAYS - AS A SOLO SURVIVOR.
---
GET 1 MAN LOBBY, NOBODY JOINS FOR 5 MINUTE - KILLER LEAVES.
---
GET ANOTHER LOBBY, 2 PLAYERS, NOBODY JOINS - KILLER LEAVES.
---
GET ANOTHER LOBBY, 3 PLAYERS, 1 PLAYER LEAVES, - KILLER LEAVES.

GET A 4 MAN LOBBY, READY UP INSTANTLY GET NURSE WITH MORI. 1 PLAYER GETS DOWNED, D/CS, I GET HOOKED, A SURVIVOR COMES TO RESCUE ME AND GETS DOWNED - THEY D/C. I GET UNHOOKED, KILLER TUNNELS ME AND MORIS ME. LAST SURVIVOR D/CS.
---
TIME SPENT ON GAME - 40 MINUTES.
---
TIME SPENT HAVING FUN - ?
---
Damn this is budget ochido
---
It's no fun because you end up spending the whole game on the ground almost.
---
By all means, do whatever works for you in terms of winning- it's just never going to be any fun to play against. That's the game, though.
---
Well of course you don‚Äôt NEED cosmetics, but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more worth it compared to spending those hard earned shards on a free killers teachable perks.. right?
---
All of the killers; my highest ranked killer is Trapper because well... He's the first killer people usually play. Nowadays I mostly play Nurse because of how powerful she is. I also play Spirit sometimes but I'm horrible with Spirit, I've never gotten more than 1 sacrifice in all the matches I've played her.
---
Thanks for the mammeries? 
---
I don't think itd compare to even 15 added seconds.
---
I think it takes 20 seconds to open a door? If you add even 10 seconds to that door itll still take about 23 seconds to open it because 30√ó15% is 4.5, so thatd be 4.5 seconds saved with wake up. If he gets all tokens, and the door is 20 seconds, 20+25 is 45, 45√ó15% is 6.75 or we will say 7, meaning itll still take 38 seconds to open the door if my math is correct. Wake up needs a buff, other than the fact it is still very niche, it isnt that powerful
---
Shadow play doesn't record my own mic for some reason so you can't hear me asking my friends if it looks like she's running weird and too fast
---
I‚Äôll take itüòÇü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
What exactly doesn‚Äôt look right? Her passive phasing that looks like she teleports a little is a part of her power. That first hit is questionable but most hits in DBD are questionable lol. 
---
Not really, the joke is that I'm making a reference to how people say that p3 Claudette is invisible.
---
I've never seen killers in videos spam it like that though, doesn't the ability need to charge up for her to phase walk or whatever?
---
THE SERVERS ARE THE WORST. I CAN'T PLAY A SINGLE GAME WITHOUT THE SERVER CRASHING.

Yea they‚Äôre working on it, the game is in deep deep trouble if the devs keep this up
---
I'm a balanced player but I tend to agree with them. If chases aren't going anywhere because they are a really good looper I reprioritize. The second survivor will throw other pallets or find destroyed ones and the cocky good looper can be downed going for the save. 
---
It's a common misconception that NOED punishes you for completing the objective or doing a pretty good job so far. In reality, your objective is to escape alive, not necessarily pound out gens ASAP. Repairing generators is just a means to that end. Sometimes, so is countering or avoiding NOED. 
---
I think it's more that games are more balanced to killers in general now. The Plague is fine, I don't see her 4K survivors anymore than any other killer really, I've escaped from her a good few times.
---
I watch him, but I do notice that he always has an excuse when he messes something up. The game glitched, they must be running this or that perk, must be a SWF, etc. It‚Äôs rarely, ‚Äúwhoops, I fucked this chase up.‚Äù
---
lmao have you ever coded anything in your life that wasn‚Äôt on scratch? ‚Äú2-3 lines‚Äù get real
---
Oh, no worries, I completely believe you. The rank system is *fucked* right now.
---
If you drop that pallet, you have constructed a killer proof fort! 
---
Cringe
---
How could I be so blind?!
---
It‚Äôs almost like both sides have to be toxic in order to have a good game :P
---
I don‚Äôt main Doc, but I like playing a 3 Hex Doc with the fourth perk being Thrill, and then Interview tape and + 75% range (ideally with a cwf offering) and snipe people off totems.
---
Does WMI?
---
At least you can find games (i guess)
---
Perks aren‚Äôt supposed to be tailored for killer‚Äôs powers. Calm Spirit and the various trap items are an exception because Trapper was the one and only killer and Jake was an early addition. It can‚Äôt be 30% in Dream World but it could be like when injured or something else.
---
I took many months of potato training. I have prestige MANY characters and have never gotten past level 11.
---
It's a lonely life. 
---
You could always just kill folks without tunneling, face camping or slugging. 
---
You seem to be an experienced player if you have those perks, still shit matchmaking though. And you can‚Äôt beat him with bad teammates 
---
took me 30 min to get that game
---
Well I got most killers. A few cosmetics, and a couple of survivors. So it shouldn't be TOO bad, now that I play on a daily basis I've noticed leveling up doesn't take but a few games. I think a few days or maybe a week I can have one piece maybe two of a cosmetic set. Plus I can always use Auric Cells to buy them as well. 
---
Ahh. Totally didn‚Äôt realize it reduces the actual movement of the survivor struggling. I recently took iron grasp off all my killers, because someone here said it was garbage due to new hook changes. I‚Äôve always run it, and I‚Äôve noticed huge differences in the amount of getting knocked around while carrying a survivor. I thought everyone was running boiled over nowadays. Haha
---
I'm playing non stop since 1 pm, now is 5 pm and I only managed to play 5 games, all of them with rank 1 or 2. Note that I'm rank 11 (12 now because I can't do nothing)
---
You arent true friends if they havent farmed you off a hook and/or sandbag
---
Its popular i think
---
Exact same feelings. Since coming on here and playing more survivor with my brother, I've only run it if a clear 4-man with toolboxes appears, and for my first Nurse match of the day to calm my nerves a bit.
---
Still defending it staying at it's current level, as long as the devs are willing to better solidify totems as the secondary goal.
---
&gt; The biggest problem I see is that people don't seem to include popping dulls to prevent NOED as one of their goals to survive.
---
This. Exactly. Many players are just patting themselves on back for having five generators repaired, as if they just crossed the finish line, and see NOED as having taken away the victory they felt entitled to. In reality, if people just stopped assuming that they already completed the objective before they're exited the gates, the resentment over NOED would drop. 
---
oh im sorry then
---
You should at least be given the max struggle points. That way you aren't punished for surviving, but you aren't drawing out the game for no reason either. 
---
So should u just run straight through the pallet? Legit question, is that better than waiting and breaking.
---
Dude autocorrect. I mean there‚Äôs a chance he actually meant blip but it‚Äôs obvious it was a joke no?
---
Yup super annoying i have to force close steam everytime i quit or it keeps  saying im playing
---
Tbagging sprint bursting megs, sure. 
---
But not the sweet Jane that lets me oink dat ass
---
Like everyone's saying, it isn't very fun, but I'll be honest, it's just about the only way to put real pressure on survivors. Two guys slugged means the other two absolutely must jump for the save, or lose the game, guaranteed.
---
I bet they loved playing against Ruin and NOED for the 100th time in a row üôÑ
---
I forgot about ONI, only ever really played don't starve. Their transparency with the community was always refreshing
---
All I read was "Bing Bong" and "12 inches".
---
Yeah, and it doesn't reveal the aura of the exit gates, or anyone nearby me, and apparently not even me to my friends.
---
Wrong sub dude lol. https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
The argument as I understand it is that they want to be able to rush their opponent out of the match, but they don't want there to be any downsides or consequences to it and for making the wrong gameplay/loadout decisions. These are the same players who will tell you, without irony, that rushing gens is just doing the objective efficiently while tunneling is toxic. 
---

---
In public matches, with The Legion while in Killer Instinct, down 25 DIFFERENT Survivors.
---
I'm not posting/ reading much on this subreddit. I just played The Legion and thought of a good meme after a few rounds. Sorry that I kinda stole your meme without me noticing!
---
A lot of people don't understand how to use it or that it lights up when active.
---
yea i literally only play as the killers in this game.   and i havent touched billie since the first day i had the game.
---
boring
---
i just picked up the plague.  spirit and legion didnt interest me that much.  same with clown.  i did get the pig because i love her ability.  and plague looks interesting so i'm enjoying her so far.   but really i like playing as mikey or the pig the most.  i'll occasionally bust out trapper or the hag.  wanted to get freddie just to try out too  
---
CK2 is better, so
---
thanks, I understood what was meant by tile, I just hadn't found anything on their wiki that said some tiles are changed match to match. it makes sense though, thanks for clearing it up.
---
A big, unanswered question muddies up the results: What powers does everyone have?
---
I‚Äôm talking about particular immunities, ranging from the obvious (Myers is basically immortal, Spirit is likely invincible) to the subtle (Do spirit and wraith and nurse sleep? Does anyone?)
---
Freddy is a strong contender for the same reason everyone has pointed out. He‚Äôs pretty much immune to everything unless you go into his home-court. But half the cast has otherworldly bullshit that could easily be said to work even in dreams. And that‚Äôs even if the undead boyos can fall asleep.
---
I think Pig, Trapper, Billy, and Bubba are pretty low. They‚Äôre just assholes with traps or assholes with chainsaws. Legion is similarly low, even if they‚Äôre... not human anymore? Idk. 
---
Doc is probably barely above them. His madness zap is potentially dangerous to them, and even if not he‚Äôs a thicc boi with enough beef to contend with them in a physical fight. Clown would be around this tier for the same reasons.
---
Huntress is probably a bit higher, her whole schtick is hunting soldiers and mercenaries, as opposed to just hunting dumb kids, old people, or helpless folks.
---
Myers is a good contender, but I assume (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, my Myers lore is lacking at best) only resilient to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù attack like guns and knives. A cursed sword wielded by a ghost? A cursed spinal column wielded by a wraith? Perhaps not.
---
Plague is in a similar spot. Exactly how ‚Äúunkillable‚Äù she is is hazy at best, but she‚Äôs clearly supernatural and thus likely has a tangible advantage over the asshole squads.
---
Both Wraith and Spirit are likely quite high, both being able to become entirely intangible for extended periods of time. Nurse is probably behind them, because her blink is both painful and limited in range and time intangible.
---
However, Wraith and Spirit both have the best argument for killing Fred-Bear, because they might either be A) immune to exhaustion and never sleep, or B) potentially able to use their powers in his dream world or cross between the two at will. Because Freddy doesn‚Äôt have a choice on whether he‚Äôs in disney‚Äôs dreamland or not, he‚Äôs at best going to stalemate, or at worst have his power turned against him.
---
Anyways, that was my unnecessarily long  examination.
---
All those needed to be nerfed. Ds was a stupid perk that didn‚Äôt deserve to be in the game, it was almost impossible to cater survivors with the exhaustion perks not having cool down.
---
It shouldn't even need to be said.
---
 Your goal as a survivor is to get out alive. Until you've hit the post-game screen, there's no reason to get sloppy.
---
 Gens are the main means to that, but calling them the only objective ‚Äì like everyone on here seems to do ‚Äì is definitely a big part of why the community hates NOED and constantly wants to rework the endgame.
---
Ruin reduces the bonus for both greats and goods, hitting great skill checks doesn't 'counter' Ruin per-se, it's just less effective.
---
well you but my buff would not be such a big thing in the game and it goes nice with the dlc but ye you only somtimes get freddy i get it a bit
---
Still would have gotten 1500 for unhooking even if I get downed immediately :P
---
Plus DS would have kicked in at that point as well.
---
I have and for something that simple two to three lines of code seems accurate. Looks like a very simple if/then statement.
---
Maybe not 2-3, but something like 15 minutes to write the initial code and another 30 or so to test it internally.
---
ITS EVEN WORSE ON CONSOLE BECAUSE YOU LOSE PEOPLE IN THE FIELDS DUE TO FRAME DROPPING WHEN YOU TURN, ITS NOT EVEN SKILLFUL
---
Hmm that can also be another solution, totem counter plus maybe more bloodpoints for cleansing them can work. It‚Äôs iffy to change the perk based off of what survivors do or even what the killer has done to them because you can have survivors who don‚Äôt really help or throw you under the bus so that they can escape. I don‚Äôt actually want them to be rewarded but see you never know as the killer if they are doing stuff like this. 
---
ran the killer around for 3 min they did 1 gen
---
Im running no mither and dead hard until I get "wounded healer" you wont hear me complain for awhile but killers still slug me.
---
I love how survivors are so naive that they cannot even fathom the idea that perhaps the developers didnt absolutely nail it with the pallet nerf and there are still far too many of them especially on certain maps and instead assume that all killers are bad. You shouldn't have to only play nurse or billy to rank up. Other wise what is the point of there even being the other killers. And on that note what is the point of the game anyways if you as a survivor are never actually scared, not even a jump scare? Is "generator repair simulator the game" just exactly what you wanted to play, while your meg/claudette is playing "hold down the shift button and run around this pile of trash on the ground"  the only reason that this is fun for you is because survivors are too strong pallets are too strong and people who play survivor predominantly are actually kind of horrible people and just generally toxic. They are the same people who used rocket launchers in halo.
---
Whenever I turn on his stream I count the seconds untill he says how good a read he just made and how only a great player like himself would've made that call. His ego is baffling considering how average he is for a high rank killer.
---
what does wglf mean?
---
Can‚Äôt agree more !
---
Oh wow i haven‚Äôt seen the originals in over 10 years
---
Anyone moving from DbD to F13 looking for something better is going to be really disappointed. 
---
It is a popular perk, there‚Äôs numerous top tier killers builds that is in a part of. 
---
What I've been doing lately now that my SWF is active less and less is using the pre-game chat to go over roles and communicate to each other what we're running, and what we'll probably end up doing in the match. I suck at chases so I generally run stealthier builds and rush gens, and I say as much. I'll ask if anyone is running a totem hunter build or looks for Ruin at the start of the match. If nobody says they do, then I'll swap out a perk like Bond or Prove Thyself for Small Game and I'll do it myself. Most of my pre-game chats are quiet but once I start coordinating roles the others usually start participating. 
---
are you supposed to lose pips? i thought if the killer dc‚Äôs you just get a safety pip.
---
cant relate. have liek 500 hours with ruin almost every game... i still suck at great skill checks
---
Don't worry about slugging just play the way u see fit. As long as ur not a tunneller, camper or the kind of slugger that leaves everyone on the ground to bleed out lol. (Ik that sounds contradicting but those are toxic as hell and very unfun). Personally I play both killer and survivor, as a survivor ik how frustrating it is to be tunnelled and camped and ik how boring it can be to just be crawling around waiting for either someone to use unbreakable and save u or the killer hooking u. But to be fair, all 3 of those "strategies" cost u big time on blood points and to top that off they aren't fun. This is why survivors get so upset. As for killer, since ik how it feels for a killer to do those to me, I absolutely will not do them to anyone else (that is unless they are toxic asses that t-bag then they deserve it) as for slugging tho, the ONLY time I slug is when there's 3 or less gens and 2 survivors. (Yes I'll admit I do it for the 4k). I will slug one person and go to patrol gens, after each gen I come back to the survivor to check on them (usually works out and I find the other one). Sometimes I find them, sometimes they use unbreakable, sometimes their teammate let's them bleed out and they get the hatch anyway. It all depends. But this is just me, I play for blood points, sue me lmao
---
What I'm saying is the Plague isn't your problem. It's the illusion it's her but the reality is, the issue is the ranking system. 
---
What do you do if you cut bait on that survivor....then see them again later in the match? Do you just turn and go the opposite direction now that you know they're good at wasting your time, and it's even later in the match and more gens are complete?
---
They really need to implement DC bans for constant offenders or disable blood point rewards for DCers for a certain number of games after the DC offense. It's not fun for killers or survivors
---
Go out of your way and find a totem ?! yeah cuz totems are well hidden hard to find and takes forever to cleanse lmao 
---
Honestly, the infinite loading screens, long queue times, completely broken survivor pipping system, and abundant bad ping lobbies are more of a reason to jump ship than anything else.
---
With that said, leaving for F13 is the very definition of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
---
Yeah instantly joined games yesterday.
---
Just hopped on now. Desired I'd try a quick game of survivor since its my daily even though survivor sucks now.
---
- wait 3 minutes to join a lobby
---
- killer dodges
---
- wait another 3 minutes
---
- Claudette leads killer to me as expected
---
- run for a while until broken (plague)
---
- go down
---
- Killer wont leave hook area, keeps circling around
---
- Unhooked before struggle phase, tunneled down instantly with corrupt purge
---
- disconnect
---
Yeah i couldnt give a fuck about disconnecting so save your breath.
---
This game is garbage now. Absolute garbage. Wait like 7 minutes for a game just for that shit.
---
Dont know why people keep defending rhe devs they're incompetent as hell.
---
And you could play without ds, dead hard, selfcare or pallet looping but do u?
---
I would like it to kill you if your in struggle but not the first phase
---
we're gonna live forever 
---
Seems fair. Lol
---
Yikes brother, that's some major heresy.
---
What the fuck are you high-ranker survivors doing against a trash-rank killer like that?
---
His rank is red FOR A REASON!
---
IT MEANS HE'S NEW TO THE GAME AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE BULLYING HIM LIKE THAT!
---
Fuck you and your entitled-survivor lookin' ass friends for beating on baby killers.
---
Honestly, I'd say NOED is a gamble, and the killer can't be effective at chase and map pressure AND protect at least one dull totem, in almost any case I've seen.
---
It usually comes down to the survivors' playstyle deciding if it pays off, and even then, they can hard counter it even after it comes into play.
---
If the major problem is survivors not taking totems as secondary objective seriously, that's the issue to address. The fact SWF already can (and frequently do) communicate totems they've removed makes this a win-win quality of life change, at least in my eyes.
---
If you feel that bad sacrifice yourself, don't feed team mates to him like a dick.
---
freddy buff op
---
Yep, doesn‚Äôt stop there either. I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer and I almost exclusively go against all yellow ranks. It‚Äôs the product of the new emblem/pipping system I believe. 
---
2 Davids suddenly become female.
---
***Whatever could happen?***
---
AS A COLORBLIND PERSON I FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED WHENEVER ITS THAT MAP. I CANNOT SEE GENERATORS, TRAPPER TRAPS, OR HOOK AURAS THROUGH THE WALLS AT ALL. THEY ARE COMPLETELY INVISIBLE TO ME.
---
Ruin is effective no matter what. Good survivors always adapt to hit greats, doesnt matter if you use Ruin or not. Hitting greats are always better w/ or w/o Ruin so adapting part isnt very logical imo. Ruin just creates more pressure which means more chance of fucking it up which is better for the killer.
---
w/o Ruin: Nothing at good, %2 bonus at Great
---
w/ Ruin: %5 Regression, Nothing at great

---
What a set of amateurs.
---
Tunnelling is the killer's gen rush. It doesn't exist, it's just doing the objective efficiently. A five minute match lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it. 
---
WOW THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY MAD THAT YOU PLAYED NO-SKILL KILLER AND HIGH-SKILL KILLER, IMPRESSIVE
---
i'm sorry ok me and these randoms just have bad luck it's not our fault that we got a low ranked killer
---
Erm... Generally easier to find the totem than power through it since you're missing out on the sweet great skill progress. 
---
WHATS THE POINT IN MATCHMAKING AND RANK IF EVEN IN RED RANKS ALL MY TEAMMATES ARE RANK 15 AND THE KILLERS RANK 1.
---
I don't want to waste my Deliverance just becuase I was the last one alive, that's bs.
---
The main problem with NOED doesnt even seem to be the effects, just the counter because there is no reliable counter
---
IM A FILTHY CASUAL AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN RANKING UP, SO WHY AM I BEING MATCHED WITH (AND SUBSEQUENTLY HARASSED BY) RANK 10 PLAYERS? GET A LIFE OMFG, I KNOW IM TRASH AND I HAVE NO PLANS TO IMPROVE. IT IS A GAME.
---
The 2 perks stack. In "We'll Make It" when it says "maximum of 100%" it is only referencing that you can't stack 2 saves to get 200% healing speed
---
Lol triggered killer main
---
Sounds fair
---
I'm not the one retreating to killer haven on reddit because the mean survivor said a nasty word to me, buttercup. You know you're using a scummy play style, you got called out by survivors for using said play style, then came here for killer back up only to find most people agreeing you're using a scummy play style. So now you are throwing a tantrum saying you'll just face camp and tunnel instead.
---
Maybe, just maybe, you're the problem and not everyone else.
---
and you get to see like the original height of Myers but to balance him you gotta stalk like you are trying to fill 2 tombstone pieces.
---
Firstly, I don't see anything in my comment besides me saying that "Jason cannot be stunned after the 10 minute mark making him completely unstoppable" (which is **true**; he can't be stunned aside from shotguns, bear traps, and the sweater) that warrants this tirade on how Jason sucked but whatever, I'll contest the point anyway.
---
I mostly play Part 7 (because I think he looks cool and he used to be the only Jason who could use the DLC kill 'The Pamela') and I did fine way back before the pocket knife nerf; when around 7 PKs and 3-4 shotguns spawned every game (not including Tommy Jarvis'). I got more than a few 8/8 games during those admittedly dark times and I always killed over half of the counselors, even when facing party-chat ninjas. Part 7 didn't have neutral Shift or the +Damage Strength stats at the time either: I relied on Morph, Blocking Attacks, Throwing Knives, Smashing Windows, Breaking Doors, and Destroying Generators to secure kills.
---
As for getting ganged up, it wasn't a problem if you utilized Shift, Throwing Knives, Block, and Twirling + Quick Grab Kills like the Head Punch or One Handed Choke. Lobbies who tried to mob Jason only won if Jason didn't know how to fight back and prevent the demask.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMdU8zZ7adM)'s an example of a good Jason slaughtering a group that tries to mob them back around December.
---
Until the Rage update Jason was balanced. Those who knew how to play him were strong and would only be challenged by people using group chat. Those who didn't would get stunned and danced on by cocky counselors. He took skill to play and good Counselor players/teams would give him a challenge.
---
Ever since the update Jason can do whatever he wants and still kill nearly everyone. The only way to avoid dying is to spam the Escape vehicles.
---
Its less about the bloodpoints, and more about how i don't want a wasted perk slot just because I survived till the end. I don't care if i get downed, just let me kobe with Deliverance. 
---
"You cant run away from what you cant loop"
---
\- Tier 3 Myers
---
Then survivors run up to a hook and nod to suicide on hook. And hey! Fast bp for doing so! 
---
Welcome to the new matchmaking!
---
I think BHVR catches a lot of unfair shit in general, but this is just amazing to me how badly they're botching this. 
---
Yesterday: 
---
"We listened to community feedback, and as it turns out, killers *don't* like arbitrarily waiting "&lt;5 minutes" for survivors to trickle into their lobbies! Wow who would have thought!?"

Today:

"Hmmm maybe we need more data on that, are we *sure* nobody likes the arbitrary wait times? Let's roll it back"

&gt; it punishes the player for ~~doing well~~ sitting on gens the whole match sticking their neck out for no one
---
FTFY
---
yo thanks for telling me
---
I want my Deliverance. I dont care about getting downed, I want the points for kobeing. Its a wasted perk slot if I survive till the end, cause I can't use it.
---
&gt;Plague is entirely dependent on survivors to give her corrupt purge bc without it she‚Äôs just an M1 killer with everyone broken.
---
Should survivors do that, they expose their positions so much all the time PLUS she's an average speed killer, capable of handling most loops and areas in the game. Also there's an addon that exposes their aura on vomit, so they get punished if they don't.
---
Hillybilly may not be able to control chases but he can infulence a little bit using his chainsaw. A survivor from some distance trying to get to a window might not be able to if he chainsaws past them and blocks the window.
---
Then salty survivors would waste the killers time, maybe make it were you get points for surviving last or if you have Delieverance be able to use it.
---
I literally explained in two posts why giving the last survivor the "attempt to escape" option. If you're the last survivor left and you're caught, you will die. That's the end of the game, the killer won. Having you use Deliverance wouldn't change that, you'd still be dead. The killer would smack you down on the ground the moment you gained control of your character and put you back on that hook. It doesn't work in this game and it's only a waste of time for the killer and for you. 
---
That‚Äôs just not true. 
---
Happened to my Kate too right from the start. When i get chased and i hit A or D, she would do a weird right hand flexing and jus stopped running. I had to play the game like Billy on charge
---
CAMPING KILLERS CAMPING KILLERS CAMPING KILLERS CAMPING KILLERS CAMPING KILLERS CAMPING KILLERS
---
You would be surprised how many times it spawns right next to where you get hooked
---
I love playing lobby simulator for 40 minutes only to get a 4 man lobby with 4 toolboxes. Boy oh boy. That 4minute game was worth it. 
---
Oh, well I didn't get the reference to the podcast as I don't know about it so... sorry for the inconvenience. 
---
They must not have been having fun in that match.
---
It's been like, 3 months now. You should now those words only bring down votes!
---
Well it‚Äôs so that you can dash away without the killer hearing you or being able to track you, so don‚Äôt let them see you do it
---
Just give a 1500 "last survivor" bonus. Ease peas.
---
I mean not everyone cares about pipping, sometimes I'd rather escape with my item and safety pip than die and level up, and sometimes it's more fun to go for the 4K instead of a longer match with marginally more BP. It just depends. 
---
Honestly, I wish I was playing against red rank killers. That's what I'm used to and it's better for trying to gain pips as a survivor. I'm stuck at 7 right now because I keep getting green killers and they just all face camp making unhooking very much a pain in the ass. Maybe I should just wait till I can get a group of 4 so we can deal with these camping killers properly rather than hoping one of my teammates have borrowed time. 
---
Personally if the unhooked survivor is right there for the smacking, I'll hit them, but leave them on the ground and go after the asshole.
---
Its okay for survivors to take advantage but not killers here. I think it's wrong to consistently rehook someone if a new person is there but at a certain point if you don't start taking out memebers of rhe team the killer will be punished for it. Even just killing one person can throw a match in the killers favor. The killer doesnt owe you any favors and i don't see any killers not tunneling me so im going to do it as long as i dont see you being pulled off the hook. 
---
All i read was Wraith 12". Am disappointed.
---
People need to realise that the game is unbalanced and need to learn how to get better not nerf the other side
---
*Spirit noises*
---
Entity Displeased
---
It wouldn't be a flat bonus for each completed game but a point multiplier. Like 1.5x points if you didn't leave for 10 games.
---
So that's the new Freddy buff huh?
---
WhY iS TheRe TwO KilLeRs( jk this is actually pretty funny)
---
Lol at the downvotes.
---
I went from having games back to green ping or at most ~ 100ms yellow after they reverted the matchmaking to today having "wait time unknown" and taking 5-10minutes as survivor just to get 300ms+ lobbies again...
---
NA, NY. 
---
Could say the same things for *some* survivors when they get downed
---
You have to hit the skill check
---
Oh. That's pretty cool.
---
Well if you hit it...
---
Yeah I don't understand the hypocrisy; survivors don't go around 99%'ing each gen, making sure that they don't pop them too soon if the match is going quickly and the killer isnt having fun. But they put that same obligation on their opponent, like it's a crime only when *they* get rushed out a match. 
---
I did. You can hear that I did.
---
Then they should stop trying to balance around it 
---
How about bunny Jane?
---
And your point? That will be nerfed within a week due to killers bitching 
---
I always do this because I'm so used to playing full speed killers, but I make up for it with my 360noscopes
---
I did hit it.
---
I mean you can run a loop perfectly to kill the pallet asap and have the chase still take 3 gens just because there's too many loops on most maps. The only way to cut a chase down for certain is with mind-games, and some survivors just won't ever fall for them.
---
I experienced it as well. 
---
top tier oc
---
camping and tunneling are impossible to punish without severely hurting killers. The only thing that can punish those play styles is survivors.
---
First time I've seen this.
---
But if you let that looper burn through pallets and take them out of productivity by chasing/downing/hooking, the others aren't going to know which pallets were smashed and which are still up. I mean, at least try funneling them toward a gen and seeing if you can find another target, but just cutting bait on a chase never made sense to me unless you're really not feeling it that match. And again, what do you do if you spot that looper later in the match?

Fredddy b tier and nurse last tier, LOL it ain‚Äôt April fools yet

---
Console tier list?
---
There is a DbD discord, but it's run by a group of power hungry nazis.  I would avoid if possible.
---
If you‚Äôre serious about this list I‚Äôd like to know why you put killers where they are, cause for the most part it‚Äôs making zero sense to me.
---
Because it was fine before they buffed it last year. Also cry me a river, NOED3 wasn't nerfed, the 8% cooldown reduction literally never matter. Unless you have 4 survivors right next to each other with insta heals it won't matter. 1 hit = down, so there's no point in having a 0.2 or whatever reduction to your melee thingy.
---
It's true, but it really shouldn't be like that.
---
You shouldn't need to rely on survivors playing like shit, and loops need to have a higher skill ceiling for killers with more opportunities for mindgames.
---
For example, every coldwind jungle gym is completely safe with no mindgame potential since you can see through the loops and instantly react to any mindgame attempt. As a result, you just need to brute force the loop and hope the survivor doesn't know how to run it optimally (on Thompson house this is especially bad, since there are two locations where a double gym can spawn).
---
You should have more options here than "play a better killer".
---
What rank are you?
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
I don't even see NOED that often, maybe once every 10 games? It's not even an unbalanced perk, you can easily counter it and its only really used as a crutch by killers who can't anti-loop. 
---
Billy is too low and huntress is too high for a console list.
---
Unpopular opinion but I agree with you.
---
Awww. If you want a fun game to play online, try Don't Starve Together. It's on PS4 too and it's pretty nice. It's a pretty difficult survival game that's mean to be played with other people. The visuals are tame so I don't think your parents would mind.
---

---
That was the thing. The guy in my example in another comment literally returned the second I was unhooked and hardly gave me a second to walk away, more or less heal. Some people can‚Äôt get kills unless they tunnel sadly. 
---
That‚Äôs why, don‚Äôt bother going into red ranks very few survivors ever go into those ranks now
---
VEREEEE FUNNE!!!1!1!1!1!1!!!!11

*Second knife sold seperately
---
Have you heard of Small Game? I don't know why this perk is underrated? If I bring Altruism offering I always lock it for extra points. If you are playing vs Trapper and you have this perk.. 2 in 1 my fellow surviour. 
---
This is like a randomized tier list with nurse added to the end to piss people off 
---
Oh yeah. There's a certain streamer that shall not be named (not a big one) that said they were mad about matchmaking changes being reverted back to the old system.  Then they complained it got returned to the new system today. lol.  
---
If I were to replace any of my current perks with one of these which one should I do?  I was thinking noed or rancor. 
---
Aw hell yea dude more matchmaking posts!
---
I disagree with the literal soul of this post. There's no point to struggling or using Deliverance when you're the final survivor. You will legit just get whacked back down and rehooked. It's pointless and wastes everyone's time. They should just give the last survivor a "Last Alive" bonus to the last survivor that would be equivalent to the struggle points.
---
OK well now you know if you chose to stop there you haven't done enough to get a red lightbringer emblem meaning you will have to get reds on the other 3 emblems in order to double pip. 
---
No its not i just dont like nurse you dont know where the blink is going and its an easy juke
---
This has to be bait. I don't even care if you're rank 10, no one thinks clown is s tier.
---
From a killers side sure you instantly get put into one from a survivors side this is not the case especially if you're play swf like the person said they were.
---
I just logged onto my friend account to gameshare Leatherface,  so I wouldn't have to waste $ for a perk. 
---
You are correct. I‚Äôm still red ranks both sides. Killer is 95% of games a quite comforting 4k. Solo survivor is hell. 
---
That‚Äôs fucking disgusting 
---
I'll have to disagree. I use NOED sometimes because I think it's fun. It's hard to call all endgame perks "crutches" when you consider that they give you *nothing* during the rest of the game. "Crutch" perks are stuff like Unrelenting which helps if you miss a lot, but becomes useless once you no longer miss.
---
I say both sides have it bad and cry for the other to get nerfed. DS was a top tier survivor that was nerfed recently so I'm willing to bet something heavy for killers is gonna get nerfed eventually like noed or ruin. 
---
Can I save this copypasta?
---
I'd much rather not drag the game on for up to 2 minutes because some pissy cunt decides they want to waste time. Using Deliverance to justify this change is pointless because the Killer will have no reason to leave and you'll be swiftly downed and rehooked.
---
Sure, this change could make for some clutch plays but it'd be extremely situational and just not worth making a change for.
---
\^\^\^\^\^\^\^SO MUCH TO THIS. Like I legit cleanse almost every totem every game if I can because its worth it but we should be rewarded light bringer points for cleansing dulls and evader for hook sabos cause they are things we can do in the game but get almost no reward for 
---
Without a doubt you should get some points for being the last alive.
---
The thing is, Deliverances trigger isn't environment specific or situational. Its just safely save someone off the hook. Its being prevented from being used as the last survivor by game mechanics, and that making it wasted in an even worse way than say Unbreakable. I come into the game knowing that I probably won't be able to use Unbreakable, but with Delieverance and its requirements, I come in expecting to use it, and being denied, not countered, denied usage of the perk i activated isn't really good. 
---
Read the flair guys ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

When its on sale its like 2.50 you get a killer as well as the perks.  Its that cheap and people still complain. 
---
yea, the old matchmaking system went much faster for me. as survivor, id get games after max 15 seconds. now its 1-2 minutes
---
the other rat is the Bubba facecamping? x)
---
If I had to suggest a replacement I would definitely say bamboozle. Spirit isnt really designed to get into loop chases. You should be using her ability more and window hoping less. And I would swap it for either stridor or predator because they work really well with her ability

WTF did i just watch?

Is Trapper wearing Wraith‚Äôs mask at the bottom?
---
This is for a good looper, I've prolonged chases with bad loopers as they tossed pallets like a mad man. A bit of a rule of thumb if you've been chasing a guy close to the start and they are down 2 gens and haven't got a hit yet you may want to re-evaluate or you'll likely end up with a 0-1 kill game. If you switch gears and push a different surv on a hook (they went through the dead zone of the other looper) you just bought yourself a lot more breathing room as they can no longer straight gen rush you. If the looper shows up later chase them if need be, but if I don't think I'll get a pallet or a hit in the next 20s or so I may not commit (at this point they only have a gen or 2 left so finding another surv isn't difficult). And like others said if they see this a lot of the time the looper with start taunting/chasing you giving an easy hit, or at the minimum be unproductive.
---
How many times will this be reposted? 
---
I totally understand your argument, and I do see both sides of it. I wouldn't be surprised if there changes to the design of it in some way, however I genuinely feel like the perk is in a really good place. It's a High Risk, High Reward gameplan. Same with most Hex perks, they can impact the game more than a lot of standard Perks, but the survivors can completely wipe them out in minutes and leave you royally fucked. 
---
I think you touched it better with changes to the likes of Small Game, so that it rewards survivors with additional BP or something, and encouraging people to hunt down totems more. Though if that was to become the case, then I feel adjustments to either sabo speed, or spawns would be needed to balance it a bit otherwise Hex perks would be weaker than they already are. 
---
Haha yeah
---
Lol how frugal.
---
Damn, basically turned it into a worse more op decisive strike.  Maybe there is a middle ground.
---
Im on ps4. But i pointed at it with another player next to me and they saw it and got real close. The body language said "wtf?" Lol
---
I agree with solos being not so good but I definitely still think SWF has a strong upper hand in general. I don‚Äôt think anything has really changed that.
---
And ofc thats literally all I run into and I‚Äôm too nice to just lobby dodge so I accept my fate üò≠
---
Not a defense . It's just the way of reddit. It's like saying "Off topic" is just a defense from people who dont want to read your off topic rant
---
That sucks my current rank as killer is 10 and it was taking up to 7 minutes the longest to find a game.
---
If you suck at nurse that doesn‚Äôt mean she is bad lol
---
I have a little over 1000 hours so I'd say I'm pretty good at both. Not your always rank 1 streamer good but usually able to successfully win at red ranks as survivor or killer.
---
Not sure what's happened after the patch but survivors are dropping like flies. Nobody can loop for a gen anymore. Sure you can say they're bad survivors but if the killer chases me I don't feel like they're an amazing killer. It's just seems like the average killer is able to steamroll the average survivors now.
---
I mean maybe the ranking is messing things up and I'm getting inexperienced survivors but again, that would balance out because I would be getting an equal number of inexperienced killers.
---
Either way I would personally bet money that the survival rating has seen a large decline recently. I wouldn't be surprised if the devs announce some buffs in the next chapter or even mid-chapter patch. Hopefully it's good buffs and not just broken perks like DS.
---
The mind game is not to play. 
---
A killer should be chasing survivors around in a way that takes them towards different gens. If a good looper starts kiting you back to an area you've been in recently, break the chase. If you hear someone working a gen, and you already have one hit on your current survivor (also depends on how good they are at evading), break the chase. 
---
My strategy is to have at least 2 survivors in an injured/hooked state at any given time. Because even if they all have self-care or Kobe off the hook, there are at least 50% to 100% of survivors not doing gens. 
---
Then I patrol gens while chasing down survivors and make sure to lock each one. After that round, I beeline back to the last ten I saw that had highest completion. I would say that most of the time when I play this tactic, there is an injured survivor back on that gen. It's an easy hook.
---
I think killers have to deal with more bullshit because there can be up to four dickheads in a single game, whereas no matter how much of a dickhead the killer is in a game, there's only one.
---
i never shitted on freddy lmao. Do you think that turning freddy into a slighty better wraith with blocks and ignoring range, skill check chances and free wallhacks is a good idea? Talking about free wallhacks, class photo is his best addon. You can stall the game and basically pause it by just switching targets with Class photo. It gives him one of the best pressue and snowball potential in the game. Now lets talk about range, they are block addons except you dont have to be next to someone to use them. Its far easier to patrol hooks, generators and even gates with it.
---
Survivors with half a brain will do generators if they are not asleep. Freddy‚Äôs power is all about keeping everyone under his mercy and Block addons encourage chasing one person, which is exactly what freddy does NOT want to do
---
Truly horrifyingl
---
I mostly have super amazing games with the best teammates ever. I got caught off guard because I'm just honestly not used to having bad teammates anymore. (And in that case I was unsure if maybe they were farming with the killer and I was the only one not getting it) Anyway, sounds like you had a great game! :D
---
We should have badges to indicate our lofty status, comrade 
---
Oh sorry I clearly missed that shitpost tag
---
I understand where your coming from but it wasnt my choice to no get chased, also I dismantled the ruin totem.bShe was a terriblenliller who we avoided which is the game. Its evade the killer not get chased by killer
---
Wait I am in the same boat and will we get the cells we purchased when they fix it?
---
You're thinking of Up the Ante
---
Yes. Because a good player will make you regret respecting pallets and cause you to extend the chase. 
---
Well no, I mean we all know what people are trying to accomplish when you preface your opinion with "unpopular opinion". You expect it to insulate you from criticism you think you'd be exposed to without it. I guess my disclaimer was for a similar reason, yes. 
---
Give me bunny feng, or give me death!
---
Until they address the infinite loading screen of death, this can't be implemented. 1 out 5 games I play end up in that screen now. 
---
I'm usually last alive, I rarely escape. Unless I find hatch before killer, gone are the days of being given hatch for a fun game or out of sympathy. I am being farmed to death or sabotaged by team mates constantly. It's not a fun game as of late.
---
I have no idea they didn't tell me that 
---
I can't get over how tiny michael's head is, it adds to the hilarity tho lol
---
What themed cosmetics? 
---
On the one hand this sub tells you that survivors need buffs, on the other hand they admit that good survivors can't be caught anyway.
---
So what is it now? Should I have to stop chasing people because they are "too good" or do killers need nerfs?
---
Obviously that would have to be adressed. That is also a part of the reasoning why I am against punishing.
---
freddys good, but nowhere near spirit (around michael level), probably why it got downvoted
---
I DONT EVEN CARE ABOUT MY RANK ANYMORE. I WAS GOING TO TRY TO GET KILLER RANK 1 BUT NOW IM JUST GOING TO BP FARM EVERY GAME REGARDLESS OF WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE BETTER PLAY. MY NEW GOAL IS TO PRESTIGE EVERYONE, THEN P3 MY MAIN KILLERS AND SURVIVOR.
---
Whenever someone kobes in my matches, I let them live. They get a free escape ticket. If they want they can even farm bp on me. 
---
Guessing not until the fix the auric cell issue on Xbox 
---
I don't see them correcting that oe any of the long time  bugs anytime soon

Well yeah the Syringe can but technically it heals 2

They posted 7 hours ago on Twitter that they are looking into what‚Äôs causing it.

---
Imagine being too cheap to spend $5. I didn't know there were so many people out there with PC's living in poverty.
---
I've been slugged enough times and used as bait to know, it's the least fun one can have as survivor. When a majority of games end up the same and you're waiting for a second slug to save another teammate (if you even have that chance), it gets old fast.
---
I DISCONNECT AND I DON'T EVEN DEPIP. ONCE I RESET MY GAME I GET MY PIPS BACK. I'VE WRITTEN ON THE OFFICIAL BUG REPORT FORUM BUT NOBODY GIVES A FUCK.
---
Hmmm I'm getting the opposite experience since the update, I have 1600 hours and am red ranked on both killer and survivor, and I'm seeing a ton of tryharding on both sides, likely in response to the matchmaking and insecurity over downpipping. Survivors are looping me like crazy, and NOED Nurses are wiping me at high rates, too. I don't know man you may be underestimating your skill. 
---
Work on your humour a bit then ;)
---
me too, taking a look through his posts and comments show how big of a survivor main he is who only wants to bully the killer

For real. I can accept a bad loss because survivors have teamwork. People who want to nerf survivors are the biggest whiners.
---
I got dos attacked by a survivor for playing with scratched mirror. I only know this because he sent me proof. Ive never once gotten hate mail from a killer. I play both survivor and killer equally and only get toxicity from survivors. For winning, losing, playing to well or too bad and just overall existing.  Ive made more friends inviting players to my party than any other gane though. Shits weird. You either meet the coolest people or the absolute worst people in DBD. There doesnt seem to be an in between. 
---
When you're that pretty you don't have the energy to be concerned with anything else.
---
They give up on hook too. A lot are solo. I feel this frustration with solo survivor will be contributing to the increase of disconnects/suicides.
---
While there are certainly many pallets on some maps, it's not something that can't be played around. Mindgames are incredibly easy to pull off with a lot of loop areas, not to mention that Nurse or Billy isn't necessary to do well in each and every game. It's about optimizing your power to the best of your ability. Oddly, I rarely see anybody talk about how Hag, Spirit, and a majority of the killers can be played incredibly optimally and instead refer back to the same 3 killers. Also, Dead by Daylight is simply a thriller game over a horror game. If somebody learns what all of the "scares" are, they won't find themselves frightened nearly as much as once intended. The "horror" aspect for survivors is in the thrill of the chase more than anything else. Also, it's incredibly easy to make anything sound terrible by grossly oversimplifying it. "Playing killer is just going around the map and clicking M1 on them." Survivors may be strong, but a large part of it is a lack of optimal play on the killer's part. Quite rude of you to generalize an entire playerbase by the way.
---
It's all good mate  :)
---
&gt;"Maybe people don't like the idea of basically paying for a perk and/or buying something that will need grinding."  
---
The entire game is a grind, but okay.

SO brave

I did not avoid the killer I got their ruin I just went gen to gen normally and they only downed 1 person , it's not my fault they were terrible

Stabbing and running probably

I have faith. One day it'll be there for everyone to enjoy &lt;3

Try getting Evil Incarnate where they all rage quit during the Mori......
---
I understand what your saying, and I agree, but I still feel like this perk shouldn't be wasted cause you tried your hardest to survive but got screwed over by odds. If everyone else dies and I get caught, I want to be able to use my perk. Its not even with Deliverance, any perk should he usable to its purpose and not be denied by a game mechanic that isn't even mentioned to stop the perk in the perk.  I mean, whats the point of grinding Adam when his perk can't get me out of tight spots like it feels like its meant to? 
---
Also, please don't tell me how to think, I'm a human being who thinks differenrly than you,  I'm not gonna think the same way as you.

merciless is now getting a double pip, not a 4k.

I really hope you are not saying i don't have the dlc just for the shake of the argument. I do have it and it's one of my first. The issue i have was with this specific attitude of the other person, you can buy this dlc 100 times or ignore it for all i care.

&gt;Just take the loss, jump in or hit the survivor. Sucks but unless you want to sit there for eternity, there isn't anything else you can really do
---
As a survivor, instead of running straight to the hatch even if the killer is standing right on top of it (starting a standoff), you can do gens and force him out of that location. This is what I do and hasn't failed me yet. 
---
First I locate the hatch. If the killer is hard patrolling or straight up standing on top of it, I just keep that location in mind and go work on gens. 
---
Oof boi, that attitude stinks. Not understanding something and going on the offensive is the last this sub needs more of.
---
whats ya rank?
---
People have been pretty vocal about it for a while from what I've seen. The perk itself underwent like 3 or 4 major changes I believe.
---
The biggest spike of people having issues with it arose when it got it's exposed affect on all 3 levels in a recent patch making the perk a LOT more prominent across all killers and ranks with it being a base non-teachable killer perk available instantly with it getting the exposed effect even at level 1.
---
I wasn't around for the entirety of it admittedly, but I'm pretty sure it's always gotten some flak ever since it became a hex.
---
I actually enjoy the new decisive, it‚Äôs a must have for me now. Sucks it‚Äôs affected by enduring though

Spirit literally wins. She can shift while invisible, that's pretty powerful. Myers has some demonic prescence going on but nothing is stopping spirit from shifting near him and decapitating him - if he gets decapitated then he's done for a while.
---
Freddy can only get you when you sleep but Spirit is literally a demon, I'm sure she doesn't sleep but even if she did - she'd still best Freddy with her invisible shifting. 
---
He is the cutest, he isn't wrong
---
I don't get it

im at 6 and im getting decent games, but my teammates range from newbies to god loopers

But there are less survivors right now so i guess just wait a bit, it may take time for you to get survivors

To be fair, NOED was already changed three times from its vanilla version, so that's probably why bombardment comes in spikes. Gotta say that the last change for NOED 1 feels like total bs.

Your reaction towards me proved a very clear point. Not only are you insult the person who created this thread, now you feel the need to insult me.  Anyone who can read a psychology book can figure out the type of person you are based on the way you speak to people. His way of saying he will go measures they don‚Äôt want him to or whatever could be hounding him for his money, countless emails, filing something. But no you want to act like a wanker and say he sounds like he‚Äôs shooting up a school.  How would you feel if you were robbed of your money on something you could enjoy?  You have zero respect for anyone based on your arguments alone and like I said, I hope you find peace. You project your hate onto others because you hate yourself... point blank. 
---
It's on the internet man it's yours now.
---
Swinging through pallets is situationally useful, but it's good to mix it up so you're harder to read.
---
are we just saying random words now?
---
For your first issue, you are too kind of a killer by allowing survivors to do their objectives &amp; not capitalising on your advantages. 
---
- First off you say you dont camp. Camping in itself is a bad strategy as it results in you wasting time near the hook while survivors work on gens. Its only a viable strategy when you have survivors that you know are near the hook waiting for you to leave or if the exit gates are opened &amp; you want to confirm one kill. Proxy camping is a useful tool if you have 2 hooked survivors in a nearby proximity. It heavily encourages alturism too survivors to save their teammates which you can capitilise on by attacking &amp; chasing them off. If a survivor is near the struggle phase then standing near him just until he reaches it then leaving is a good idea.
---
- Chasing someone you have recently hooked is a good practice for not tunneling a survivor. Especially with the new DS out. It is also the reason you are likely having issues killing people because you are spreading the hooks out too thinly. By the time you reach 2 gens you want to have at least one person dead. In desperate times you might just have to capatilise on the person you hooked just so you can eliminate them to increase the pressure on the other survivors. Once you turn the game into a 3v1 you find that the pressure drops massively for killer.
---
- Avoiding the basement is a bad idea. If you can get a survivor in their then just do it. Its the survivors poor luck or bad play to let you down them at the basement. the basement provides you with the opportunity to waste both the survivors time &amp; place pressure on them especially if you can catch them before they escape.
---
- All though this sounds dickish, DBD is a competitive game at the end of the day &amp; by doing these nice things for survivors will definitely result in you not gaining any kills. The game is a competition between you &amp; the survivors &amp; if you do not take advantage of their faults then they will always have the upper hand of you
---
- When a survivor DC's, dont let that hinder your gameplay. Its him that gets the flak for doing it now you the killer. Doing nice things like that is sure to make you lose the game as it provides to much of a benefit to the survivors. 
---
- Overall if you played less politely and took advantage of the basement while also just prioritising your targets. For example, if a survivor unhooks another right in front of you, capatilise on it. Its the survivor's fault for doing an unsafe hook not your fault for downing the unhooked survivor
---
Second issue
---
- Usually players hang out at the exit gates so that they can troll you or to make sure everyone else makes it to the exit gate to escape. They get extra points if they can help another survivor out of the game. They may also want to stay so that they can chat with you after the match. Some survivors may also just want you to chase them out the gate for extra chaser points.
---
Usually it's either a) they're making sure the other survivors get out or b) they just want to initiate chase one more time to get a few extra points

Wait BHVR isn‚Äôt punishing DCs anymore? When did they say this?
---
Exact opposite experience for me, but I have noticed killers seem better on PC compared to ps4. 
---
Had a hag Ddos me and 2 teammates. On his profile, he wrote some shit like " try to escape and see what happens". Should have known by how he was setting 6 traps around one hook. Ugh.
---
What is your reasoning for that line of thought? And why does that same reasoning not apply to getting hooked as a last survivor?
---
you're right, thanks for the correction.
---
You got downvoted lol ‚Äúhow dare he play the game! *downvotes*‚Äù
---
Not bright enough she needs to lose her only power
---
(Nice drawing by the way)
---
I have PTSD from the SFW group of Claudettes with flashlights and DS

That's great and all for the Survivor, who I think has the edge in this situation due to what you've said. And they *win* a standoff, this is all just ways to avoid it. What does a Killer do? 
---
Actually, I am a survivor main who doesn‚Äôt like to play Killer.  So, wrong on that guess.  Just because you are fragile doesn‚Äôt mean they are wrong.
---
just chest piece = hood down
---
chest + head piece = what you see in the pic
---
just head piece = bunny ears
---
Make the jacket some sort of ultra rare tier cosmetic that is both the jacket and the hood. If you wear the jacket, you can have the option to have the hood down (heresy) so you can wear a different head option or you could wear the jacket and have the hood up in the head slot.  
---
That'll real cute 
---
could say the same for any toxic player who doesn‚Äôt contribute to the community 
---
Being hooked in the basement by a insidious leatherface 
---
I hate when they do that to me as killer and I end up finding the injured one by accident and losing the one who saved them. Like I‚Äôm not gonna just let them go if they‚Äôre all I find but I feel bad, man. 
---
It‚Äôs not rookie hazing. Some survivors and some killers are just shitbags. Not all of them, but there are more than anyone would like.
---
MATCHMAKING DIDNT REVERT, ITS WORSE THAN EVER, EVEN AS SURVIVOR YOUR WAITING AN ETERNITY PLUS A DAY 
---
My ass you're a survivor main defending facecamping and tunneling into moris off hook.  
---
BUT THEY HAVE REVERTED THAT AGAIN. IT'S NOW THE NEW MATCHMAKING AGAIN BUT THIS TIME THE LOBBY TIME HAS INCREASED. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS COMPANY IS DOING.
---
The best advice is to not care. Its like middle fingers, you can acknowledge the insult and take it, or just see it as a random ass gesture and ignore it. You know what way is the best for you enjoyment
---
i played friday the 13th before i played DBD
---
and honestly i didnt like DBD at first when i initially tried it 
---
honestly i still have the opinion that when everything was working right friday the 13th was a more enjoyable game over all 
---
but the devs killed that game to the point where it became a chore to play and wasnt as fun. 
---
if they ever do release the spaceship map i might reinstall it but thats not likely 
---
"I'll be the victim!"
---
"All your life"

This was a shitpost and people are writing whole paragraphs
---
Look we all know Michael's got the biggest one okay.
---
every bps increases the chance of an infinite load screen/game crash by at least 20%
---
I think they should double or triple how much survival points survivors get from struggling. I think it's around 800-900 if you struggle until death on the hook. 
---
Most are pretty adorable. Maybe he was just going and making ramen. 
---
Thats arguable. Playing survivor is a lot harder now after the numerous nerfs in almost every single patch. And killer has never been easier than it is right now.
---
&gt; Then just pick up the medkit at lobby and get a better perk jeez
---
Literally the exact same thing can be said for Self-Care.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
didn't know spirit had a gift now i'm gonna be afraid when i get mori'd 
---
Clown 8in+ ? Usually fat niggas got 3-5in and the skinny niggas 6in+
---
This is why I don't do hatch standoffs. Seriously, fuck that. 
---
Spirit for some reason. IDK why I just hate playing against her.
---
Whys freddy bad though specifically ?
---
(Laughs insidiously)
---
Depends on the map. But when you vault, you dont need the speed boost you are already safe. But when you fall down, the stagger reduction/speed boost is actually huge because the alternative is to be stuck for 1 second and lose all momentum.
---
Another player playing this game in its wonky state is always welcome to me
---
Does that actually happen?
---
this is what i was gonna say lol
---
No salt. It's just a scummy thing to do
---
one of us is DCing to force a spwan
---
Are you people stupid? You know there's a point bonus for quitting, right? I *hope* you quit. 
---
"You tried to kill all four of us, we'll just quick then!" Brilliant strategy. 
---
Like I said in my other comment, you have screenshots saying "proof its impossible to double pip" and I have mine. A few minutes ago I managed to double pip in two matches not too far apart from each other. 
---
[First match](https://i.imgur.com/Dh884vc.jpg)
---
[Second match](https://i.imgur.com/Csm2DY2.jpg)
---
Does't look "impossible" to me. 
---
What a generalization. 
---
Leatherface has bbq already. It gives extra points. I had the teachable unlocked in maybe 2 or 3 days tops playing him plus he can be fun to play. Its not a big deal you cant complain about not having the perk if you don't want to work for it like everyone else. 
---
You mean, "Waaaa, I don't want everyone to escape, waaa!"?
---
No, it's more to ensure "Hey they are slugging. I'm quitting for you. Good luck."
---
Holy shit, this will kill the game on latinamerica, all latins that i have played with that aren't on my country have thrash ping
---
To be honest they were really fucking bad. Really fucking laggy as well to be fair but I looped them for quite awhile. Could barely blink onto me in an open field. The only person who died (bottomscore Jake; also the person who said "thanks matchmaking") got hard tunneled super hard and face camped in the late game.
---
Honestly I don't know how on earth that Nurse was Rank 2 she played like a Rank 20, but she was P3 so there's that I guess.
---
Something being scummy is purely subjective. Do you realise many people here dont share your opinion ?
---
A lot of people don't assume that playing Killer is much harder and much more stressful than playing Survivor. 
---
I think the chainsaw audio is bugged on console, it seems to cut out a lot which makes it impossible to tell where he is. Leatherface‚Äôs is bugged as well.
---
Yes. Several times.
---
Yep as a freddy main no one stays in the dream world long. Its easy to get out. 
---
please read the capitalized letters in my previous comment
---
Oh, you mean like this exact reply? üëÄ

This one is Suffocation Pit, but I'm pretty sure this land mark is on every MacMillan map except for shelter woods.

A nice trick I‚Äôve found is if you get a hit walk away a bit. sometimes they start trying to chase you before they heal, then you can turn around and slap em. Another great trick is called moon walking. You can do it by walking backwards around walls if you think the survivor is waiting in front of an pallet so they can‚Äôt see your red stain, it helps to memorize the time it takes to walk around corners. After you go around the corner you turn around quick to hit them.
---
Clown bc he's ugly
---
Well, they shouldnt (?). I would agree on the stressful part but harder ? Can‚Äôt really compare. Theres wayyy to many variables involved
---
* Killers have to deal with survivor's bullshit due to ~~more people maining~~ there being 4 times as many survivors as there are killers
---
Fixed
---
She rushed into an ass whoopin. 
---
I've asked for Bunny Feng before and this is what I have always thought, but why it would take so long to code is beyond me
---
Can't be too surprised considering they're recoding the entire game for dedicated servers apparently, though
---
Maybe people say it because it's simply a unpopular opinion and they want to talk to other like minded individuals? 
---
You say that I exaggerated what a killer chase is and yet this whole "meme" that this is about is Rude and generalizing, as well as being extremely exaggerated. I'm not sure you know what irony is, but you're it. You made no points period, I wasn't arguing against anything I was explaining to you why you are wrong. I didnt avoid you comment about optimization because yes OBVIOUSLY, if you have the best add ons and perks for a certain play style on a certain killer you will perform better. I chose to not comment on it because you're literally just saying if you have the best stuff you will do better with a low tiered killer. You even discredit your own argument referencing Ardetha by acknowledgeing they main nurse. Yes when you play against a smaller player percentile and those survivors are used to only seeing huntress nurse and billy they will not be used to something like the hag giving you the advantage most times you do that. Once again pointless. The obvious flaws are that survivors are have been way go strong for a long time and a major part of that is Pallets. Some of the maps are huge and there literally  no way to cover both sides of the map and if the survivors are using discord or party chat of some kind they can easily manipulate the killer to follow there best runner who is all perked up and ready to lead you to every single pallet on the map. This "discussion" if you can even call it that is why this game will die sooner than it should.
---
I'm glad my boi Bubba getting some love in a tier list. Though not exactly the type of love I was expecting.
---
Agreed.
---
If I‚Äôm doing a gen or something I leave traps so others can step in them and I get the untrap and heal pts while I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs also nice to use during chases. If it‚Äôs still there when I‚Äôm done with that area I‚Äôll disarm it, unless it‚Äôs at a hook. Those are reserved to get survivors off shoulders in the most humiliating way. 
---
You're making the assumption that we aren't doing our jobs as killers. Play Killer at least four times. You might actually learn how difficult it is. 
---
With a side effect of guaranteeing at least one survivor getting camped/tunneled out of getting ANY points
---
BBQ for survivors 
---
AS SOMEONE WITH COLORBLIND FRIENDS I WISH THIS GAME HAD BETTER COLORBLIND SUPPORT WITH HOW COMMON COLORBLINDNESS IS, SERIOUSLY, THIS GAME NEEDS IT
---
*Laughs in Plunderer‚Äôs Instinct*
---
It really bothers me and I wish it didn't.
---
Except I DO play killer. Fairly, might I add. Sometimes I 4k sometimes I don't.
---
I don't act like a little bitch and try to be an asshole to get my kills either
---
I hate playing against Bubba. I love Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the actual character but there's something about his playstyle that makes me sick to my stomach, the instadown chainsaw, the sounds he makes, insidious basement build
---
Some people think the Nazi's were right. Some people think the world is flat.
---
Some people are just wrong
---
Oh shit that's good. I regret not buying it from the sale when it was like $2.
---
Clown because he is fast and to add to that he has that stupid potion thingy that slows u down by half ur speed. It's just annoying
---
I agree. I personally don't play a lot of killer, and I don't think I'm that great at it, but I still got to rank 5 as Trapper and Spirit without using Ruin, BBQ, or NOED. I feel like I still could've gotten to rank 1 without them if I played more killer. It feels way too easy as killer sometimes. I 3-4k almost every match, and most killer games I play don't even make it to end game.
---
I do play a lot of solo survivor, and it sucks so much. I constantly get paired with dumbasses who go down like 15 seconds into a chase and DC, people who hide in corners and don't do generators, and people who just let me die on hook or purposely farm me. It's been so unfun as of late, I can't enjoy it without friends.
---
I get that killers were really underpowered back in the day, but I feel like killers now are more powerful than ever. It feels like they're balancing the game around SWF and not just survivor. I don't really know what they could do to make it better, but I hope they figure something out.
---
While that is true, it doesnt add anything to your point. Youre saying that an actual strategy is scummy, what can I say ?
---
Yes. There was a big uproar about it the other month. JenDenise was deranking about 5 levels off stream every night.
---
She admitted on a podcast that the people moderating dbd once told her the disconnect rate and said they gave her a heads up that one of her friends was close to a ban on their system.
---
This on top of much extremely toxic and abusive behaviour yet this sack of shit company won't drop her. 
---
Oh, my god! They're flashlighting me through a pallet when they could keep going! 
---
Yep. 9/10 times they're just waiting around the corner to get smacked before the chase music even starts. 
---
Though I've also been running Franklin's lately because I seriously cannot even with Flashlights sometimes. I'm very much a killer operates visually so not being able to see is generally annoying. My ears are a little too weak. :(
---
You misplaced Leatherface. He belongs all the way down in blue. (It's why he's so mad and has a tantrum all the time)
---
Well, at least you used your Bloody Stream for yourself
---
Hey my little brother said Freddys was 5 inches ok, do some research beforehand smh
---
To be fair, debates (as mentioned in the title) are rarely concise. 
---
FUCK ROTTEN FIELDS THAT MAP CAN DIE IN A HOLE
---
You forgot ‚ÄòNOED too OP‚Äù lol
---
Burn in holy fire!
---
A lot of people don't really know how us killer mains even function, including us killer mains truthfully. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even be angry
---
I got a skeleton key my first game. 
---
I'm gonna fucking PISSED if David doesn't get a speedo 
---
It's almost Easter, let's just do bunny everything. 
---
Freddy! No way to really escape him, hate his stupid song 
---
I think they want it this way. NOED being the prime example. A huge crutch on bad killers and OP on good killers as they can pressure survivors so much that they don't have time to do the totems.
---
The only saving grace is that a lot of good killers don't run it. Meanwhile if you see a bad player you can be 99.9% certain they're using NOED.
---
Combine that with the noed and ruin changes so that both give the same effect at tier 1 and they're essentially training wheels. Well noed mostly. Its like "here you did bad but everyone gets a kill today".
---
Not gonna lie killer can be extremely frustrating when first starting out, especially when you go against more experienced survivors. Perhaps they use these crutches so that new players dont quit.
---
Either way killers dont need fucking noed anymore that's for sure.
---
For me it's the fact that if I can vault a window I'm already on a somehow safe spot, but if I drop down I need bl not to get hit.
---
No need for the condescension; I'm well aware of what irony is. It is true that this meme is quite rude (to those that don't optimize chases), but a key difference lies in the nature of the post. Yes, this is generalizing to some extent; however, this is intended to be a joke, while your post was trying to make a point. That is simple. You did simplify what a chase was for survivors (as did the post), but you simplified it to such an overwhelming degree that it made survivor gameplay seem banal and primitive. The original post could be argued to be doing this, but it is highlighting a key flaw in killer gameplay rather than the entire spectrum of gameplay that your post suggests. When I talk about optimization by the way, I'm not referring to load-outs; rather, I'm referring to optimizing your play-style. It may take experience, but learning the actual capabilities of your killer will push them to a position to the point of being even as capable as Nurse. Even if Ardetha does play Nurse, you shouldn't ignore the entire basis for the argument considering the fact that he still does main the Pig, who is generally considered to be very weak. Theoretically, your argument about repeat encounters with the same killers should show that survivors can adapt to Nurse and Billy gameplay very well; with repeat encounters, they should generally be little of an issue. Preparedness from experience is not necessarily a factor in the matter. While maps are large and might make pressure hard to establish, that point alone neglects the fact that defending absolutely everything is likely not something to do. The "3-Gen Strat" exists for a reason. Manipulating the killer to follow a good player can simply be rendered moot by ignoring them. If they bodyblock, attack them. Time will be spent and wasted on the good player's part by constantly having them follow you. This game might die, but that's more likely going to be due to lack of action with glitches and connectivity rather than balance. Once again, no need for the condescension. This can be quite literally defined as a discussion (though it's moreso on the argument side of things).
