You shouldn't, that's how you learn.
---
---
---
I mean, if it isn't a negotiation and the two things aren't balancing one another, shouldn't you post the suggestion in its own thread?
---
Hex-a-gone because it gets cleansed before even joining a lobby
---
I’m just trying to learn Huntress, man. I love her hahaha. I honestly think I got matched with two SWF groups, too, which didn’t help. They were way too coordinated at the end for it to be coincidence. 🤔
---
I'm literally watching a fortnite video as we speak lol. Game is still for locals and if you play it casually over 20, you need some new hobbies though. Epic has a thing for ruining games.
---
Can you give a bit more details? Not quite sure what you mean. :)
---
Killer is Succeeding at what? Not landing two hits? 
---
*Rage Quits*
---
How does a token cap correlate to what I said? Only use that you said was hook saves. You are an ass if you are farming people. Unless you have BT nothing is gonna happen.
---
That hurts me. Why would they do that? Lol. That's just a buff to swf...
---
Carl it’s me CJ! Chill!
---
It's a Hag addon: Waterlogged Shoe. It removes her teleport ability but her traps slow you down. 
---
They fully deserved it. Welcome to the kindhearted community of dead by daylight
---
I think that was old rank 1. They changed it.
---
Meaning that even if you've saved your teammates all game, they're pretty much guaranteed to just leave you there even when you didn't deserve it. That's one of the worst things about noed. Not the strength of the perk, but how it promotes bad teammates (especially bad in solo). 
---
Sounds like you were camping to me. I don’t see how that’s even fun. 
---
I had this daily on 178/180 before the bug started, kept it for the entire week after before I finally realized it was time to let go
---
Because inherent tokens wouldn’t have to generate by being in a terror radius. 
---

---
Hook saves, vaulting, gen repair, opening exit. All things you can get interrupted for. 
---
Me and some random decided to run the purple mist offering, just because. The killer decided they didn't want to play and DC'd during loading, which made the offerings disappear. I only had one mist offering and wanted to see what it looked like.
---
I usually just start doing 180's after every vault to punish that shit, if they're smart they try to do other jukes, if they're dumb they get the smack every time
---
well done, young Killer
---
Yup, its been like this since the newest patch I think. Its just bugged. So you should just reroll it. 
---
There’s been a lot of Daily bugs, the escape with a certain survivor was bugged for a while (haven’t seen it in my dailies recently so dunno if it still is). We’ve just learnt to live with it unfortunately.
---
They were on the hook but the camera/game glitched and thought he was on the killer still (billy uses his chainsaw during the video).
---
I think the whole point of legion is they can't get away. Even though he is a guaranteed down killer, he does it a lot slower than nurse or spirit ect. Minimum bleedout timer is 30 seconds without any addons affecting it. That's a long chase. That's why he has the ability to hit others and then chase someone. Without them wasting their time mending, gens will be done very quickly. So if the killer is unlucky and finds no one near the person he just hit with frenzy then he either chases or finds someone else to hit so he can snowball. Quick answer. You need a competent team to do gens and not group up so he can't hit you all with one frenzy sprint. 
---
I use it out of fear of Lery's
---
Okay! Thanks! 
---
Like a reverse Michael but every stage is on a timer like evil within 3?
---
This is ridiculously unfair and the only way it would work is for nobody in a swf group to see it until all members of the group are dead or escaped. When playing solo, sometimes you can die on your first hook or get tunneled/farmed to death. Not everybody waits until the end of the match, and what if someone is holding the game hostage or there's a hatch standoff? You shouldn't be forced to wait until the whole match is over to see if one of your assumptions was correct. Adding the change as you've suggested would only frustrate and annoy people to no end.
---
They were not wrong when they posted it. I went back and looked to see it was posted 2 years ago. They changed how Rank 1 worked a few months later! But thanks for the information! Good to know. 
---
Oh, my bad. I already said why unsafe saves shouldn’t be preformed. I’ve never been vault interrupted. I’ve vault interrupted like 10 people in my life all of them with Trapper only cause people underestimate Trappers. Opening an exit is super situational. Tanking the hit to open it even more is useless unless you have like 75%. (Then you could probably open it and let your friends out and maybe even you.) They might also have NOED.
---
2nd worst exhaustion perk that constantly doesn't work. 
---
I think it's just to prevent killer dodges. 
---
That’s why there should be a 20 second channel (like the exit gates) to open the hatch. If you get to it and I’m not there then fine but if we both get there I shouldn’t just instantly lose the 4K or sit there for an hour. 
---
So does dead hard, even if it is working. 
---
Yeah I always joke that if your on cons you have a hidden 5th perk.  Telepathy 
---
That's why they wait for dedicated servers and only make the perks invisible to those in swf ques
---
They aren't. That's a ridiculous statement. You blame SWF for things that go wrong in your games, so you assume you're always facing them. You aren't. You're also ignoring all of the times you destroy games and they are SWF, because you think of SWF as some kind of elite playstyle for professionals. It's mostly people dicking around together yelling and cursing that they just got caught.
---
Yeah I agree but I just think they shouldn't even be in the game since newer nurse players will just see 'adds 1 additional blink' and immediately equip it. 
---
I say just penalise multiple dodges instead. Make them wait a couple minutes after a couple of dodges in a short time frame. 
---
Literally only lithe is worse.  Dead hard gets easily countered with exhaustion add ons bad ping, exposed, and good killers can counter it quite easily. 
---
Yeah but you never said that in your post. All you said was that they should remove the killers perks for all survivors until the match is completely over, regardless of anything else. 
---
Average perks aren't meta. 
---
tapp
---
It was a joke, ma nig
---
Well to me it appeared as if they were all close by. I didn’t facecamp, I kept checking the nearby areas but I was reluctant to leave line of sight of the hook for more than like 15 seconds bc I got no BBQ readings. Wasn’t too boring for me bc I was actively searching and playing defense. 
---
That's why I'm saying it now. It was an oversight on my part
---
You’re being rude for literally no reason. No where in my messages was I rude/baiting/looking for a rise out of people, just making a statement.
---
And you begin calling me pathetic and harassing me. Are you 12 years old? Read the Sub Rules maybe? :)
---
Yeah that makes more sense IMO and I'm not too keen on the idea anyway since both killer and survivor wait times (unless of course its a swf group, again giving them an advantage) will seem so much longer. 
---
Jameson earned you an upvote, also good good song choice ;)
---
Rank 20, level 1, no perks (or just one perk that comes with the killer), no add ons, and absolutely zero awareness to the sounds of survivors so they couldn't get a single kill if their life depended on it. That's the definition of Baby Killer.
---
However the meaning has been perverted to mean any killer who falls for jukes or accidentally mind-games themselves.
---
Yeah maybe add an edit to your post with any additional information on your suggestion so other people don't comment similarly to me. 
---
Even when I was new to the nurse I saw the other effects and said hell nah. I didn’t even touch the uncommon one.
---
As a Nea main can confirm, that and "Kidsbopdeathgrips" killed me
---
Yeah the saving part is something my swf does a lot, because we realize swf is stupid easy and almost boring if you actually play sweaty as fuck. So we usually mess around and try to make the biggest plays during save attempts if the killer is camping one of us or something and it usually ends with the killer getting all of us or like 1 or 2 extra kills lmfao. But it’s fun for us because pulling off a really well played escape against a camping nurse or billy is really satisfying. If we don’t get it, oh well, we at least know in our heads we could have just all escaped and gave him only the 1k.
---
That's like, so much effort
---
Then i had a idea for a frosty eyes and added some glow in the dark powder. The outcome was stunning.
---
Versus legion unless he somehow does this (drunk or rank 20 killer) then the skill level of either player doesn't really matter. You will go down eventually.
---
Easily the most broken and horrible killer to play against in the game. Devs need to completely rework him.
---
Heh i see you feng min!
---
No Feng mins here, only a bush
---
Fair enough lmao
---
Yeah, what box?
---
I wish some people were as observant as you then lmao
---
Lmfao I love this
---
Omg we actually got it to hot xD
---
Invisible hatch is new, I've had invisible pallets 3 times now. Once as Freddy, once as Huntress, and once as Doc. Noped out of the Huntress game. I suck bad enough with her I didn't need the extra aggravation. It can happen as Survivor, too.
---
Yeah you wan sum karma?
---
What the fuck is up with these toxic Kates at the bottom here
---
You just said they added interrupts to add pressure, then said that interrupts never happen. 
---
Think about that....
---
If interrupts 'never' happen, then why does this bother you so much? Don't take the perk. 
---
They always add new abilities to add pressure, then they also add in options to escape that pressure. For instance, there's a lot of aura abilities out there like BBQ and Nurses Calling. Well now survivors finally have one ability to counter that, Discordance. It's all in how you play the game. Also, "pressure" goes both ways, not just towards the survivors. 
---
Git gud.
---
I thought it was only me and was too lazy to post. Then I got my third version of this daily challenge in a row and came on here to post and saw this one.
---
They would have to, bill’s perks are just default perks for console.
---
Wraith is the simplest of the vanilla killers. Cloak to move around the map, uncloak to hit/chase.
---
I can play survivor terribly :) 
---
I miss the Halloween event where survivors had additional objectives that just rewarded large amounts of blood points. Made games run longer which Killers want and gave survivors something rewarding to do other than sneak gens and leave
---
Definitely not
---
y o s
---
It’s all about that small game, get very totem in two minutes on any map
---
If I see a killer going toward me or hear a beat and know they aren’t in a chase, I have to get off the gen. I was pressured out. I didn’t get what you meant by that but my rant(?) did come off as slightly dickish. I just think that this perk idea is good but since interrupts rarely happen it’s really only a way to stop a standoff. I don’t like standoffs but a solution that basically completely favors survivors and could encourage people to play for the hatch.
---
So you don't know too? Nice we can both learn :) 
---
How are your bloodpoints calculated from your ingame scores?
---
Each hook is 500 points, and each stage is 200. The only way to get 8,000 without moris is to get all four survivors three times each. If any survivor stays on hook for two states, you've lost a perfect game without a mori.
---
So then by your logic.  It's ok to steal if I think that no one will notice that I'm stealing?  
---
Freddy /s
---
If cats programmed the game at least they would then be cute.
---
Yeah I always prefer to learn a killer without any addons at all (I used to learn them at level 1 so I would never be tempted into using addons and perks too). Using addons and perks just gets you used to having them and then when you try to play without them you end up being at a disadvantage so it seems pointless. 
---
If there was a way to hide the perks only if it was SWF, then I totally agree it should be added
---
Again, reported. 
---
I dont know if you know this but when the game launched there was no SWF; it was only added because people were saying it was too hard to get into the same lobby as their friends. Meaning that the game was literally designed and shipped for players to not have the ability to communicate with each other.
---
It startled me when I saw it, I can only imagine how difficult it might make a chase if both killer and survivors saw it.
---
Show me yours I show you mine 
---
In a reddit poll, the game was shown to have approx 50/50 killers/survivors mains which is a big problem. Therre should be 4 times more survivors.
---
It is, co-op healing actions are the only thing that advance it atm.
---
Yes
---
Leader is garbage. The little it does isn't worth a Perk slot (and then you have fucking Prove Thyself)
---
Urban Evasion is decent but my goodness it's overrated.
---
Alert is pretty damn useful for the info it gives you.
---
Bond is the same as Alert as it too gives useful info and is also good if you don't run Self Care.
---
Lmfao still thinking being a bitch, complaining, and reporting people who call you out makes you somehow morally superior here...
---
Bullying that poor Dwight
---
I just tried it and they keep jumping into lockers i hate it but still got a 4k because they aren't aulturistic
---
Trapper can help you learn the game while trying to learn mind game and anticipation as well 
---
Nah, I just let them win, and held back when they all called me a baby killer
---
No question or opinion, legion is underpowered, they can't kill easily with their power, however, people don't realize it's not really an offensive power, it's designed to keep them still and away from objective and that's what it does. You can kill with their power however making their ability better than doctor in regards to offensive capabilities. I think legion is well balanced as a matter of fact. I just wish they had a secondary ability like pig does. 
---
It’s 25 sacrifices per
---
He’s awful to play for both sides is the issue. When you get hit that’s literally it. He either tracks you down while you bleed out or hits you again every time his free hit power comes back and downs you. 
---
&gt;This creates an unfair advantage to SWF 
---
lol SWF is unfair advantage out the gate. 
---
Once a totem is located, the entire SWF knows where it is making running any Hex's pointless.. constantly able to inform the others when it's safe to unhook, where you are on the map and when to rotate..  and it's them snitching out your perks that you think creates an unfair advantage? 
---
Admittedly it would be terrifying to have Bubba coming after you while blasting Death Grips.
---
Nurse, Spirit, Billy/Hag and Huntress are the top 5 killers (listed in order of strength), I recommend Billy or Huntress as the other 3 have very particular playstyles 
---
Dwichael here! 
---
I was thinking the same thing iv been playing him as my main killer since Halloween and I dnt have any of them 🤨
---
Well it’s a wraith, you’d of got camped regardless. Boil over op.
---
Yeah it’s really weird 
---
I get called a camper when I play hag.
---
Killers can already interrupt the hatch. Even worse, your entire animation could be completed with your survivor completely in the hole, and they can still pull you out of it, which is some next level BS. There's zero point in making an ability that allows survivors to ignore a couple of interrupts if you're just going to let killers have the interrupts anyway. 
---
It's like saying "Okay, we have discordance now to protect survivors against BBQ and Nurses Calling, but screw it we're going to let you see them anyway."
---
It's like how killers will pickup and drop survivors between their downing site and the hook so they can't use decisive. They get a free method to outplay a survivor perk, and not all survivor perks need to be so easily countered. 
---
Yes, but also when the killer sees 4 items, for example, that’s an automatic Franklin’s to the face, no matter what the addons are. Most killers do that anyways. 
---
While for survivors you absolutely have no idea what killer, addons, and offerings you’re up against. 
---
I’m not saying that survivors should be able to see these, I’m just saying it’s ok the way it is
---
Ah, yes the tile you are describing is known as a T-wall/L-wall tile, or a T-wall for short.
---
Best bet is to try and move away from the tile and hope you can get away. If the killer keeps trying to predict you vault or tries to meet you on the other side, try faking the vault (i.e. run at the window like you are going to vault, but then change course). If successful you can use this to buy more time and distance.
---
However, that will not work if the killer is vaulting the windows behind you.
---
"baby" is used to refer to a new, innocent player who is bad but it's cute instead of aneurysm-inducing.
---
But a certain youtuber who shall not be named turned it into a general insult.
---
That’s kinda gross haha
---
Yeah you are right, I thought Prayer Beads were ultra-rare
---
Some people are just way to nice.  You are one of them. Keep it up :D 
---
Imma beat a motherfucka with anotha motherfucka
---
... I meant if your perk was added. Think about it. Since you have this perk you are GUARANTEED the hatch if it’s a standoff. I can’t interrupt you if you don’t jump but you can just ignore the killer. Dribbling ain’t bannable and we are talking about DS so...
---
Kinda like The Thing then in that it can take the appearance as another survivor.
---
In the film the paranoia level is high cause they don't know who to trust.
---
Same could be said for this killer.
---
2:20 am here. But thank god it's Saturday. 
---
Not for those like me that want nothing to do with voice chat in this game. Sure I can mute it, but now I’m facing buffed killers. They would be screwing over part of their player base cause I guarantee there’s gotta be others out there that don’t want chatter during the game...especially playing solo where you’ll probably get 12 year olds screaming for you to unhook them. No thanks!
---
Sorry to break it to you bub, but long range saws are always 100% on the surv being ass.
---
Still satisfying tho not gonna lie 
---
I get these challenges done easily I don't understand what's the problem.
---
What about an offering that spawns an extra hatch (maximum of two total hatches per game) or an offering that makes the hatch spawn earlier 
---
You defined tunneling in your post.
---
Again, that's just an end-game offering. I'd want a pink offering that's effective for the game's duration. 
---
Awww, love your name &lt;3
---
I’m not saying it was aliens, but...

The hatch spawning earlier would make the hatch kick in earlier in the game?My thinking was it would remove the count of gens needed for the hatch to spawn or with a team it could be there from the start, but that’s seems pretty OP
---
IIRC they've said they wanna add a leaderboard
---
Honestly I hardly see camping leatherfaces, I get camped more by trappers and wraiths. Wraiths are the fucking worse for it. Leatherface is just a meme now, unless you get put in the basement then he is going to keep your ass and anyone who dare rescue you down there.
---
Not really, class photo is prolly his best addon and that actually increases the time. 
---
You haven't missed much. Another underpowered, already nerfed killer to make it easier to farm for survivors.
---
Had that happen as well. Me and a friend hyped this game up so much to another friend so he bought it. First match is against tombstone myers. 
---
He goes “Uh is this normal? He just picked me up and is stabbing me. Is this how killers down people? Wait, he just threw me to the ground. Guys I think Im dead.”
---
I was dead from laughter, also dead from myers shortly after. Sure enough he never played again.
---
Cosmetics tho? Maybe like for one event exclusive to the no. 1 of each leaderboard, nothing else. Bloodpoints for R1 would help with the deranking issue
---
Leatherface with bamboozle and enduring makes him pretty good.
---
So what would satisfy you? If I land a hit on you and then go find someone else so you can heal? This is what confuses me about tunneling.
---
Even Claudette's one is perfect
---
OH MY GOD HE HAS HAUNTED GROUND PLEASE DONT CLEANSE THAT TOTEM WE WILL PLAY THROUGH IT, OH GOD, OH FUCK, HE JAS AIRPODS IN SOMEONE TELL HIM NOT TO CLEANSE THAT TOTEM! 
---
Killer: as long as no one escapes through the gates is a win for me
---
Survivor: a fun match.
---
Ye and it would be really creepy to play against :D
---
Claudette is there though
---
You just... can't see her
---
DBD is not a competitive game, you can play how you want but remember: you can't stop yourself from getting unhooked and getting focused like that is literally 0 fun, I assume you're new and/or haven't been on the receiving end of that BS enough to understand.
---
Poor Optimization- Unlocks the potential in one's aura reading capabilities. Console Survivors have a GREATLY increased chance to experience glitches PC players can not. 
---
"And in the fog I saw everything I was not meant to... and I am forever scarred." -Lost Tapes- Unknown
---
If your getting interrupted nine times out of ten it's the survivors fault situational awareness when doing a gen is crucial and those who don't pay attention get pulled off it.  Hiding in a locker is a risky move it can pay off but if your found and try to leave it's still your fault the idea is good but the perk would be essentially a second chance perk like DS it would probably stun said killer and become a "crutch" perk, as I said good idea but maybe something more like this.
---
Untouchable-if a survivor is hooked or you are the last survivor standing in the killer's terror radius for 60/50/40 seconds would give you a token.  When the killer attempts to grab you he misses and is stunned and the token is used.
---
*note* the token is only used for hook, vault, and hatch interruptesions.
---
yep
---
Well, looking at your video, you absolutely deserve facecamping. I'll sure remember to facecamp you first next time we play, may that ever happen.
---
Yeah I know but trust me it isn’t half as bad as it is on a regular PS4. It’s unplayable.
---
that scene make me laugh every single time i see it
---
Rank 2 and I’m on console, 
---
Should be. 
---
hahahhahah nea killer 
---
Imagine from the other perspective:
---
&gt;Get unhooked by some asshat whose being chased by the killer or unhooks 5 seconds after
---
&gt;Killer goes after you instead of that dipshit
---
&gt;Gaming_experience™
---
Again, I don't care about how you play, you paid your 20+ bucks so ad long as you don't literally exploit or cheat idgaf, I'd block you on MLGA and give you some spicy BM and if you somehow wouldn't manage to kill me you'd get an interesting post-game chat (no, I don't mean the "reee tunneler kys -rep" crap, but I like being a snarky to assholes).
---
I do however understand situational tunneling, such as some dipshit hugging a broken tile or abusing a glitch in a map, they're getting the Gaming_Experience™, also sandbaggers WILL die, even if I have to throw my game for that.
---
If you want to play like that, go for it, as I said, you paid for the game and everyone has the ability to avoid it (on PC at least), but at least have self-awareness.
---
That turned out longer than it needed to, anyhow, good luck in the fog.
---
Nurse is a joke on console
---
That's usually because of the ridiculously high skill requirement to be good with her. It generally requires a more intelligent player, and more intelligent players also tend to be less toxic :P Toxic + skilled Nurses are not common, from my understanding.
---
Platform: PC 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Types of bug: In-game and Visual
---
Issue 1 : *my ruin totem is NOT lit on survivor's perspective*. There has been several times that survivors told me that they cleansed a dull totem and then realize it is the ruin but on my end it is perfectly lit and fine. I only play nurse so I'm not sure if other killer also has this type of problem
---
Issue 2: [https://clips.twitch.tv/FunPunchyCarabeefTakeNRG](https://clips.twitch.tv/FunPunchyCarabeefTakeNRG) Survivor A is able to locate where I am at after I hook survivor B while A could *not* see where I hook B. I did not experience any lag at that point so maybe there is something wrong with my personal client/server (idk) ? Also after someone unhook that guy he is floating in survivor's perspective when on my end he is normal and just down on the floor: [https://www.twitch.tv/caperoff/clip/SplendidConsiderateDumplingsDeIlluminati?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/caperoff/clip/SplendidConsiderateDumplingsDeIlluminati?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) 
---
I do not know why or how my game has these kind of bugs. I doubt it's bc of my pc is bad: GTX 1060, i7, windows
---
Absofuckinglutely lol. The red rank pool is small when playing against people and there are certain people I would love to avoid
---
Bitter Murmur is extremely easy to read lmfao what. If you're found immediately after a gen and you didn't run away, they have Murmur.
---
Your Remember Me thought assumes that they get unhooked and healed every time. Good killers won't assume that.
---
If you're that scared of SWF knowing your build, and it's that big of a deal to you, slug them and use them as bait. There isn't a perk in the game that's enough of a surprise to change it and screw over the majority of players
---
That's not a new or original phrase.
---
I simply disable the chat from my ps4, so many crazy people around...
---
Console players can see right through the entity’s petty attempts at a stable reality, but not by choice.
---
No. In its first person point of view at the generator its hands will rip something off the generator causing it to explode. Then you can attack after 2 second transforming back as the survivor is suffering from hindred. The transform time you are slowed from 4.5m/s to 4.2m/s and get back to normal. 
---
Because healing takes so long that you get totally not 2 seconds
---
*WACK*
---
Ace does not respect wamen how dare you &gt;:(
---
Yeah because killers NEVER go near a gen that popped if they don't have bitter murmur. It's completely different to know they have aura reading after each one, especially after the final one.
---
Didn't know if it was the Pewdiepie subreddit or the Dead By Daylight one because of the title.
---
I’ve had that hooking situation happen a few times. Such a scumbag move. I always let the unhooked guy go and then I’m sure to get that pos that unhooked him on a hook to teach them a lesson. I wish there was a way to deny getting unhooked lol. 
---
SAME i have 70
---
Legit made me lol 
---
After hitting 7 ruin skill checks in a row i feel like a fucking god
---
Agreed.
---
r/pewdiepiesubmissions
---
Lmfao I love how you didn't read what I said
---
It is against terms. However, in this game, you can be griefing all day long and got no penalty, it seems. It's a dead reporting system.
---
dude weed LMAO
---
even working on a gen gives none. If you do a gen solo you get practically no points for it, which means if you really want points you have to waste time finding teammates to do gens with
---
it is just a game that if killers have enough, swf will have no one to play...
---
Omg I'm crying I recognized Quentin but until I read this I didn't realize it was smallville and it's 1000 funnier pls add killer lex luthor devs
---
Survivors buffed to have DS by default.
---
I don't even know what you think you're arguing.
---
"Wow, I'm so good at the game that I don't think a completely unnecessary disadvantage to playing against already coordinated players should be removed because I don't think it impacts how I play."
---
Even if that's the case what's the point in being against it being removed? You're just being a contrarian for the sake of arguing and to show how highly you think of yourself.
---
You guys seemed to like my previous video so i thought I could throw together a edit of some clips I had laying around :) [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw)
---
He's  spectacularly average, no matter the skill level of the killer, nobody in the game has fun, the killer loses and the survivors win as fast as possible to get out of another shitty legion game, that or the survivors give up on hook to avoid playing a legion game.

Only 420 hours since 2016? Bruh.

I’ve been maining it and a
---
Jeff on PS4 for about 70+ hours so far on PS4 
---
I agree it’s underrated as in not used as much but I think it’s good that not everyone has it equipped, I think just 1 person having it is enough especially in swf for map/key focus group play 
---
What do you mean? Only one of the Spidermen were pointing in that scene.
---
This is so sad can we keep crying 'cause survivors are 2 op??
---
I agree and I’ll admit I have done this once or twice because of people tagging or pallet looping me and making me upset but only until they’re hooked and then all is forgiven. I don’t just go after them. 
---
The only issue (massive issue) I could see with that is that there’s now 0 potential for mind games anymore. You couldn’t moonwalk certain loops and what not. Overall it would just be too OP in the chase
---
You're making a lot of assumptions about what *I* think swf is. swf isn't an elite playstyle, it's people who can communicate, something that is purposely not in the game because it gives an unfair advantage to survivors. My guide is for people who are frustrated playing against people who are clearly communicating with each other on a third party program.
---
This is a guide *for people who have trouble against players who can communicate*. It is *not* saying "I hate swf hurr-durr", it's saying "hey, when survivors can plan and communicate and some of them are definitely above your skill level, these are tips to help you cope with it"
---
&gt; You blame SWF for things that go wrong in your games
---
Never have I mentioned this as the reason for posting, I only posted advice on *if* you are against swf. You seem like you want an argument, but the truth is there's nothing to argue about. My guide is for people who have trouble against groups that play together, it does not say that every game that doesn't go your way is swf, it is merely a guide for when the situation arises.
---
Yeah most people seem to call it moonwalking or cheesing, never heard anyone call it a “bloodhound exploit”. You don’t need bloodhound to do it, you can just watch the blood normally and use your sound
---
Nope, and it doesn't matter. The suggestion still seems too over powered. 
---
Then they should have never put SWF if they didn't want people to find outside sources of communication.
---
I dont run noed on Myers, my guess though would be for increased speed, and not having to rely on tier 3 going back down to tier 2
---
What's a solo player supposed to do to learn whether they misplayed or they got screwed by a perk if they can't see the killers build? Wait for fuckin 10 minutes while the rest of the randoms play? The majority of this game isn't SWF, no matter how salty you wanna get over getting outplayed and blame something else for it
---
That wouldnt accellerate the process just increase the amount of bugs being worked on at any given time
---
Hell that is me, but for the past two weeks 12 hour shifts, with one week being 6 days.
---
Camping is a legitimate tactic (sometimes the only one, considering how easy it is for survivors to win). Teabagging is just being a dick.
---
That bug where the store thinks you don't own something is getting really really weird

Thanks, stranger!
---
oh god
---
It's good, I just prefer bond.
---
* I have it from the start of the match. It's a huge benefit to me to see when the survivor being chased is sprinting directly at the gen I'm working on, and I don't get fucked over by shit plays that early in the match.
---
* I don't need to build it up, and I don't need to re-build it every time I get hooked.
---
* It affects everyone regardless. If a teammate is immersed, or a gen jockey, or just hasn't been hit yet, I still have aura reading on them and I'm not reliant on healing or being healed by them to get information on what they're doing.
---
werewolf seems way too strong, but depends on what considerably faster means
---
Games like these are frustrating but I have a feeling it was just a low rank scared to do gens. If it continued for an extended period of time then it would be bannable but probably not in your case. 
---
Wouldn't fixing two a patch be better than one a patch though? 
---
[removed]
---
Like everyone else on this thread has said; dedicated servers are coming this year and it'd be completely reasonable to only block out the perks for SWF.
---
That doesn't answer my question
---
https://youtu.be/0iKRVFqp_5E
---
Is this no longeraccurate?
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
The entity can only be summoned in such gruesome acts that result in death, what would he have done to summon the entity? 
---
Similar concepts have been suggested tons of times. The problem is that swf groups can completely counter the killer, as well as aura reading perks. If the killer isn’t affected by Bond, then it would be easy to tell because they don’t have an aura, but if they are effected you essentially have permanent aura reading on the killer
---
As a lover of SWF: I love SWF due to comms, not figuring out what perks they have because I died first.
---
I'd suggest a really original name like Bob
---
Sorry if that came off as a complaint it wasn't I said it would be a crutch perk because everyone would probably use it because of its power people wouldn't like it and would be called a crutch perk I myself don't really class any perks as crutches but some are extremely good.  Although we could dispute about who's fault is who's some sometimes it is completely the survivors fault there caught by a grab not always though, what should be a fast vault could be a slow vault or you could blow a gem though a messed up skill check that's not always the case so I believe with a little tweaking the perk would still be powerful yet not a perk that forgives those who aren't playing attention.
---
(P.S.  To your post was one of if not the best "new perk/character post I've seen, good job)
---
Yeah as a killer boi on Xbox/pc I can say there’s literally no difference at all. Having a computer doesn’t magically make you any better or worse at the game than you would’ve been on console.
---
It's been what, 3 years? 4?
---
A Legion perk.
---
(As a member of killer gang, I agree)
---
So it's a conspiracy that the killers did this?
---
I use dead hard constantly and it has failed me less that bl
---
Well yeah, nobody is saying that lol
---
How many times was this one reposted by now?
---
I get to play at work because of graveyard and the circumstances of my minimum wage job which makes me and my counter grave staff extremely lucky but if we ever want better pay we gotta give up the perks for a better job or position ( which would be management and fuck that lol it’s only like 20$). But yea I get to play about 8 hours of my 10 hour shifts :) 
---
Oof. Hey man for future reference look at it this way. Bloodpoints will always be there. The money you spent on those classes won’t be 
---
So you admit it's better.

Your post got more upvotes than mine... here take another one!

As a legion main I want a mask less/ broken mask so badly

I'm not fucking Scott I just linked his video dipshit.

That's also a shitty thing to do in my opinion. Higher rank survivors can absolutely run a train on low level killers. Please don't do this
---
Agitation+Mad Grit. Legion’s perks all suck except for Discordance. They are only good for memes which is unfortunate.

I mean I guess, you would kinda think the person would just not be a dick though instead

He forces them to slow vault windows. And when you get some decent perks on him and add ons then he's gonna make you happy. So don't be too hasty in your judgement.
---
Fought 3 leather faces all 3 camped
---
deerskin gloves unfortunately don't stack ;-;
---
Even then, we still had this exact picture with camping leatherface at the last panel before.
---
is it based on how easy they were for you to play or genuinely what they bring to the game? 
---
well i haven't seen it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
wait, name checks out
---
Neat how Survivors can be invincible. Wait no it isn't
---
I had a game on xbox where the survivors stood on a hill and waved at me. Being the killer, i just shook my head left and right to say no because they had flashlights and a way out lol. Eventually I finally go up and I get a message that says "kill me leather daddy" and I wound up my chainsaw and ended them both lol. They were super cool about it. Good people. Fun game and we laughed about it afterwards
---
Well if we're talking game play then I'd say claudette.
---
She has natural camouflage in many maps, comes with built in self care, and is played by tryhards often (for some reason) which gives her a higher win rate I'd think.
---
Nea has some good perks too, but nothing to match self care Imo. Balanced landing is fun but unreliable unless you camp on the high ground, and urban evasion is very good for stealth, but doesn't compare to healing yourself with no medkit.
---
So claudette is what I'd call a better survivor
---
In terms of character and personality I'd also give it to claudette.
---
She might have a reputation for being an asshole because of her strange ability to attract toxic players but her character is just a shy botanist lady who posts on internet forums, seems like she'd be a nice lady, I'd like to sit down and talk about plants or something with her.
---
Whereas Nea is a punky rebellious vandal, she might be a cool person but she doesn't seem terribly nice, kinda sketchy, breaks the law and sneaks around a lot.
---
Finally judging them by appearance I'd also give it to claudette.
---
Claudette's dark skin and earthy colored clothing give her a natural stealth advantage, and she's a pretty looking gal in terms of character model.
---
Nea has *some* stealth oriented gear, but most of her clothing is very flashy and colorful, and her default appearance looks sort of like a gremlin.
---
So all in all Claudette is the superior character in all 3 categories, it has been proven scientifically. 
---
Maybe when the gates are open, otherwise you’re just being a trash player and an asshole at the same time. Why play killer when you’re bad at it and have to suck the fun for every player
---
Oh really?
---
I have over 1500 hours my thought is if they BM you don't have to play fair anymore
---
If I play killers and I down a survivor and they just dc, I think of it as if they killed themself on hook, I don’t give sympathy, but if they just leave for no reason then I take it easy on last survivor at least. 
---
High lag can cause that in this case maybe he lagged switch but who really knows. Did look interesting how you stopped lagging once he got you down 
---
She's the vanisher of the team
---
It maybe weird to say this but I think balanced landing is the worst exaustion perk or lithe the reason I say this is because some maps dont have a highpoint to drop from and used only with the basement.Lithe because you have to be in a chase and with certain killers can be right behind you yet still not be in a chase
---
Lol np 
---
Botany and toxicology probably overlap
---
What a man
---
Not a bug, if you drop a survivor over a certain line at the exit they can escape
---
This doesnt happen to me but I usually find the hex totem the first totem spawn I check! I almost feel bad.
---
Fastest cleanse in the realm
---
That game is too much killers oriented, no wonder is so hard to find a lobby with 4 survivors...
---
This is a fucking mood. 
---
He's extremely good in chase, so if that's your struggle get him whenever you can. He's also very fun to play. Only issue is map pressure, but that's the case with many of the killers.
---
Is that challenge bugged?
---
You were pretty dead on
---
okay but these seem like one time plays an not a genuine experiment with multiple games played on each killer to give an accurate statistical answer. Saying if something was fun or not is completely subjective and ratings need to be objective
---
I feel bad for the killer. I’m a terrible killer and I have games like these. It’s the worst. But GG! 
---
This game is a buggy mess at the moment, oof.
---
I got trolled as the doctor once. These assholes kept trying to see how close they could get to me. They ignored the gens till it was too late. By the time they got the gens two died. Not my best game. Now, one managed to escape, the other decided to troll me again. He baited me all the wag up to the gate. I got a good shock right before he got there. Madness 3. Clone appears right in the gate. Moron somehow thinks it's me and runs. Right into actual me. Fucker got captured. He then messages me after the match calling me a virgin bitch. Then says that I must feel so good hacking. I didn't even reply.  
---
They do though
---
Danke Sehr. 
---
Laurie is one of my main girls! She looks terrifying in P3! Haha.

But ur console players so ye gotta use rennigan to see that shit past the 4 frames

Hella good editing.
---
I got this game in June and i'm already at 500+ wth
---
I’m done wasting energy over this, just know if you camp, and i win, you’ve only yourself to blame for the teabag
---
What is he saying
---
There was a change in game that made trap to not activate when put by the exit gate, but the case where the survivor go back off of the exit gate (in this case on your shoulder) and then back again to the exit gate, I'm not sure...
---
Seen it a few times. Surely. 
---
David King can now mori killers.
---
Thanks monto for blessing us with this Feng face for all time to come.
---
Dude this is just some random current raiting. Nothing official. I just got bored and wanted to post something. Jesus.
---
Just checked the game to make sure, they don't stack. It says so in the flavor text
---
You need to learn how to throw your bottles more efficiently! You’ll get better with practice I’m sure, like any other killer. I personally don’t enjoy playing him though. 
---
Why is this so funny? It just a lame joke! Why am I laughing at this so much?
---
#neaandthepusycats
---
Well, know that if anybody facecamps you, you deserved it. And, if you suddenly get banned for toxic behaviour, youndeserved it too. Wish you all of it!
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Nice!
---
NANI?!
---
I figured it was lag, I haven’t seen it quite that bad though, the floating nea killed me lol.
---
I’ve heard lag switching is fairly common on PC but I haven’t really heard of much incidents on console, but yea it was sort of suspicious how it stopped as soon as he hooked me. 
---
If you have friends and they felt the unbridled power of Tombstone Piledriving Myers or Iridescent Headhuntin' Huntress and their first reaction is to never play again, sorry to say, but your friends aren't cut out for this life.  
---
Now, if they became killer mains then all would be understandable. 
---
My mistake i thought thats what you were inplying and didnt fully read
---
I DC when it's a doctor I cant stand him 😭
---
Ive been playing nurse to the point where im confident in my blinks, but i WILL bloodlust you/DC on rotten fields.
---
DARN
---
The first time you play him you’ll chuckle about as hard as he does after hitting a survivor, at least that’s how it was for me anyway. Good luck!
---
Just hide in a locker.... Hiding in lockers now block BBQ auras. 
---
do you mean that they're bad because they're OP or they are hard? They're the top 2 most OP killers in the game, they just take practice.
---
So its a slightly less ugly nea?
---
the n word
---
It was a haunted grounds wasnt it 
---
I’ve heard she’s amazing on PC but is a lower tier killer on console. Something to do with frame rates or whatever. This true?
---
"I'm gonna say the n-word"
---
Is the movie worth the watch?
---
Nope. First of all, stop relying on crutch perks. Aw boohoo they know a perk you have, cry me a river! Secondly, Maybe you should think about that before tunneling and killing off survivors straight away, it makes the game more exciting and fun for all players if you snowball players who are dead on hook and wrap up the game when you can. No one likes a killer who tunnels and it ends up giving you less bloodpoints and likely less kills in the end anyway. Coming from a rank 1 killer main, grow a pair and deal with it, we don't need some shitty and annoying game mechanic because you can't use a perk to it's full effectiveness, it happens.
---
Trust me it’s 100 percent possible to lag switch on console not as common but it has happened fuck someone even used it on me once or twice. 
---
Yes 100% true. Nurse is on her own tier on pc. She’s extremely deadly for the fact that she ignores every mechanic of the game. If you’re up against a good nurse, you cannot loop her etc. 
---
Also I think it could also be mastering her blinks is harder on controller since she’s mostly muscle memory. 
---
I laughed so hard. Good one, op.
---
10 hour loop with remix track of Claudettes running into the traps pls
---
Ultra settings 
---
It was just what it set it at.
---
Can’t ban on console GOOD LUCK!
---
David definitely seems like a StreetFighter or Mortal Kombat player.
---
No, its defensive strike. (Lol)
---
Still wish you all the worst in game for being a shit player.
---
No. Its there still
---
What? Why are you so triggered? And what about those are crutch perks besides Noed? And why does everybody think you have to tunnel and camp to get kills before the gates are opened? I usually get a kill in two gens and I refuse to tunnel or camp unless it's a terrible save... But no, make all the assumptions you need in an attempt to validate your point instead of logic, lol
---
I've tried them together they do stack! It says they don't but Iron Maiden and Deerskin gloves do stack
---
U have good framerate?
---
Only works for healing and not generators
---
just make your own?
---
Are you on mobile?
---
I always dc during the loading screen if the killer has a hidden offering and there’s no punishment
---
My biggest complaint is killers dc’ing in the lobby after waiting 20 mins to find a match. It’s getting worse and worse.  The easiest fix would be to not let the killer see the survivors before the match this way they can’t  cherry pick their challengers..... or for multiple disconnects will result in bans of several weeks to months. I know if I was gonna get a 90 ban for dc’ing I don’t think anyone would do it. 
---
I don't know who the real killers are in this game. Tunneling cunts or the idiot noobs who fucking unhook you 5 seconds after you get hooked. Fucking pathetic. The devs must have not played this shitty game to implement a feature to make the hooked person to stop someone from unhooking them. How hard is that?
---
If we're 2 survivors left I DC before i get hooked it to deny BBQ aura so last guy has a chance to get Hatch.
---
If I'm against a squad using several hook-removal or extra-fog offerings I dc immediately nowadays.
---
I always trash that one the pointa arent worth the time
---
Freddy is S tier now.
---
I mean it is quite killer sided as of late. Even Freddy has over a 50% kill ratio. Doesn’t mean Freddy’s op but it does mean you should think twice before saying stupid shit lmfao
---
What perks and add-ons are you using? I know Bamboozle+Whispers+Enduring+Spirit Fury can be good on him, and for add-ones you can go with Ether 15 Vol% and Garish Make-Up Kit to practically guarantee a hit. Once you get good with your aim and quick thinking he's pretty good at challenging what would otherwise be a strong loop. 
---
Because its a good meme. 
---
Sooo what happend
---
I was curious how her face would look like. Thanks for sharing.
---
The Wraith is a low-tier killer, but a fun one. 
---
Devour hope or Thrill of the hunt one of the 2.
---
If I see someone 0:06 a different item / character, I absolutely tunnel them.
---
Myers Tier up music is muffled when you are in building like any other sound. I doubt it should happen to music.
---
You’ve already lost all your credibility. Go camp someone who cares
---
I lost my credibility because some toxic trash says so?
---
And you obviously care.
---
It's a bug. It's happened to me three times so far, and it lasts the whole match.
---
I think allowing him to slice through pallets is enough, might even be too much. I think there would be a problem with counter-play because he could just saw right through a pallet and you can’t do anything about it. He’d be able to down a survivor in 20 seconds almost every time without fail. The only counter to him would be windows
---
David King
---
Jennifer, Cassandra, Tyrone
---
Dude its spelt rating. 
---
There's a difference between OP and good
---
They're not bugged. They're just shit.
---
Surprisingly enough, I've never had an issue with this at all, normally finish mine within an hour or two of gameplay max. Unless my game i broken. Wouldn't be surprised.
---
Yeah during the time I’ve spent in this game i’ve learned one thing to NEVER EVER DO
---
Bm a killer with instadown or if I don’t know if they have Noes
---
Hell yeah lol
---
"Scared" dbd? Lol never
---
I wonder if something is going on with consoles on their end
---
They can’t though, your net is just shite
---
Yeah, no.
---
After about 10 games you'll see how good the tonics are and learn how to throw them in right places
---
Less blind time because big makes zero sense to me. 
---
it should be during the lunar new year, so like February
---
Give me a few damn, I gotta wake up first, and smoke before you turds bully me.
---
I've had dead hard fail on me a handful of times but i don't mind it not working 10% of the time, because 90% of the time when it does it saves my ass or it keeps me alive for a couple more seconds.
---
It’s not BHVR though, it’s a site advertising their discounts
---
If you get saved by someone with borrowed time and a legion frenzy hits you then you cant mend yourself
---
Just because Nurse is overpowered doesn’t mean we should make other killers overpowered.  Thing is the devs don’t want to change things until they have a good change like the hatch and decisive. Nurse needs a change but they don’t have an idea for one. Also leatherface should at least take some skill to be that good because Nurse takes skill to play. Trust me I’d like every killer to be playable I just don’t think this is the best way to do it
---
Most of the maps are already too big. None of them need to be bigger, except maybe The Game.
---
Looping is a strange one killers will hate it survivors would like it also give us more bp for totems gens and healing others its sad some survivors refuse to get healed by others because they need the bp
---
Like your unwanted comment? You want a glass of milk with that cookie? 
---
I DC if loading screen lasts too long because I believe someone else can DC during loading too and there’s no sense playing with one or two survivor.
---
I have a few tips for using deliverance
---
**Activating the perk**
---
•Play it safe and try not to be found by the killer first
---
•once someone gets hooked play aggressive to get that unhook.
---
(You want to have deliverance active as soon as possible and use it as late a possible)
---
**Using the perk**
---
•do not use the perk if a teammate is near or coming after you let them unhook you
---
•The safest time to use deliverance is when the killer initiates a chase far away
---
•if the killer is camping use deliverance when the killer try’s to defend the hook. Or when you are just about to hit struggle. This will at least waste the killer’s time and sometimes you can escape
---
**when you’re broken**
---
•unless the killer is coming back work be productive and help out your team. You can usually not run into the killer for the 60 seconds you are broken
---
•Heal as soon as Broken wears off
---
•use your teammates as a meat shield
---
Borrowed time does not work with deliverance. Dead hard might be a good idea to bring as well
---
 
---
They said a new update will come which won’t allow killer to know if you’re swf or not 
---
Why in the hell would you want the transition to take longer? You just make it take longer to hit people.
---
For me I had never gotten hit hooked or saved. 
---
Also I was legion and these two dudes dropped from my mend, they messaged me saying they can't mend and it was my first time hitting them.
---
Meanwhile, I was about to say Dwight is me.
---
If you use Frank's Mixtape Overpowered because you can 3 Hit Survivors using Frenzy.
---
If not then Underpowered because your Power will take forever to put Survivors into Dying and 110% makes them easily loopable.
---
So pretty average, needs a few tweaks like changing moonwalking or looking down to not initiate chases so Survivors don't just eventually end up into Dying from Frenzy and Iridescent Button and Fuming Mixtape need to be changed because both of them don't really give a strong effect (Fuming Mixtape is just Wraith's Addon)
---
If a survivor knows how to use dead hard, they can easily keep looping you. You can't counterplay it if they are actually good.
---
Meanwhile, balanced landing needs you to dropdown to get the speedboost. By that time you could have already taken a hit. Or you need to run through a deadzone just to make it to a hill. Or one just won't spawn at all. Or there will be only ONE. Sorry, but since balanced landing has so few places to activate, its not that good. Stop trying to say that like, 3 maps make it good. The fact is that its too situational. It can have a chance to NOT ACTIVATE because of your map, or have few places to activate. And by few i mean 1 or 2. If your good, dead hard is good.
---
Dead hard can be used anywhere, while balanced locks you to ONE place to use it. 
---
Mistakes were made. 
---
"Activates haunted grounds"
---
Wow
---
Thick mist on corn map and I'm not doctor ? Closing app. No points for you. Next survivors i face will get this lerys or game offering.
---
You need to buy default nEA cosmetics. :)
---
Legion requires no skill and guarentees at least one kill.
---
Legion is weak in the sense that his quickest time to down is 15-20 seconds when compared to other killers who can all down people quicker (bar Freddy).
---
The problem with Legion however is it is **always** 15-20 seconds, regardless of the map, or skill level of the players.
---
Happens a lot on PS4. Killers dodging the lobby. I'm a solo player and hardly ever SWF and even when I do, I play with one friend only without mics lol.
---
There will never be a killer that can transform into survivor for the simple reason that any and all swf groups can completely negate them.
---
What in the goddamn
---
I had not been late to work in years, but was last week. Thanks Behavior! 😎 Love this game. 🖤🖤🖤
---
That's a fair point. I guess if you're just looking to jam out some games and not screw people intentionally. I've just absolutely seen people do exactly that too bully with flashlights and stuff
---
The Spongebob memes fucking kill me, god I love this community.
---
They're all Haunted Grounds. Please leave all totems alone for your own good.
---
Nice ty. Susie by far looks the best of them all even without mask.
---
I figure if anyone can actually use those POS properly then go for it.
---
In my mind flashlights are useless and waste of points. I never neee em
---
I’m Dwight. 
---
I mean, I may not necessarily give the kill, as I really do find games where the pressure is highest to be the most fun, but I certainly wouldn't try to do something cheeky like that to ruin someone's achievement
---
I don't trust you i'm gonna..**[Exposed]** god damnit!
---
I realize the map offerings exist, however haven't seen an offering for the Yamoaka Estate for about two weeks
---
Legion main 🤣
---
Nuu why would you wanna go to that hellholeeee! I personally love Coldwind as survivor because corn blindness for killers is real. Ahaha. 
---
Marth is a youtuber who ran SWF 4 man and deranked killers using 0 perks on anyone. They played against killers with full perks.
---
Survivors are skins, yeah true but you don't need perks. Claudette probably the best because she blends in better.
---
You don't need perks to cloak or tier 3 Michael, no. But you also don't need perks to run loops, run jungle gyms, slam pallets, use items, or do generators.
---
That’s why I said as a survivor. Corn blindness is the worst man. I main Myers and getting corn makes me cry.
---
No that would be bad probably for killer main
---
Scroll down to the history portion and see what it says.

Killer had to preform a break action within 12/24/36 meters. Yes, there was a cooldown too, which only means we’re both right, but my original statement about the distance was valid. 
---
Charles, or even better, refer to the suvivors weirdly, when i play huntress i call them "my child/children" and as The Pig i call them "meat" and "Pigs". I dont know why but it makes veing a creepy, scary killer so much more fun.
---
No, not important enough to start its own thread. I felt it was adequately similar enough a topic to add on here.
---
*THAT'S RACIST YOU CAN'T SAY THE N-WORD!*
---
I mean, survivors can just last second switch to a pre-built character so the killer can't plan accordingly anyway.
---
I think your confusing New Years and the Chinese/Lunar New Year, i believe its early-mid February.
---
Are you playing with SWF? Are you playing with friends at all? Is there 4 toolboxes or medkits? Are you wearing legacy? Are you wearing the classic toxic Claudette w/ the pink pants and orange top? Are you living in a place that gives you a high ping? There's a lot of reasons why a killer might leave a lobby, to name some reasons.
---
See ya, chump 
---
Ditto. I was hoping the progress meter was just bugged. Looks like I’ll be resetting this task tomorrow. 😕
---
      If anyone is staggering to get deviousness points with pig, try crouching and ambushing mod chase, it’s basically unavoidable in the open and hard to predict, survivors immediately try spinning me on reaction, this does not work, the only time I M1 is if I know I don’t have time to ambush before they get to a window or pallet.
---
    Also never put to much faith in the beartraps, they merely waste a small amount of time.
---
If two or more players disconnect it's time for the fun killer. And I main the doctor so that's like 90% of my games.
---
Maybe against low rank survivors, but experienced players verse a nurse can be difficult. And the way you described the situation does make them sound crutch, you're asking for a mechanic to be added to remove swf from telling eachother what perks you're using. Sounds pretty crutch to me. 
---
Real facts though. I only camp 5 feet from the hook, not in their face!
---
Happened to me today with a trapper. He was afk all game, we opened gates and all and I went up to him to blind him with my party starter to farm blood points. The guy downed me as soon as i got close to him, he scared the shit out of me :’) 
---
Where will you be when diarrhea hits?
---
&gt;It's hard being good with a survivor but it's very easy to be a decent or great killer. Half the time you don't need nor use your perks as killer. you can do fine by the killers natural abilitys alone where survivor you HAVE to rely on perks.
---
This is seriously some of the dumbest shit I've ever read. I rest my case. 
---
Hatch in general needs fixing. It's a boring, momentum killing mechanic for both killer and survivor sides. 
---
Yikes
---
You never heard of a freezer what else are you suppose to put ice cream in 
---
tbf thats probably because she is the only in game model with hair. The others kinda looks like g-mod characters. 
---
Charity Case is Green/Rare
---
It can only be countered if you're using dead hard to only dodge a hit, in the open, with no vault or pallet nearby. Dead hard is best used to close the gap to a vault or pallet, and as such can help extend chases by at least that 1 vault or pallet. You can say the same for the other exhaustion perks, but I find dead hard's usage far more powerful, as it is activated at will and can be used as long as you are injured, making that usage more reliable. As such, I find that the arguments against dead hard, those people saying that sometimes it doesn't proc, as in you get exhausted and dont dash and still get hit etc, are utterly meaningless because dead hard's invulnerability isnt the main use of the perk, its the dash itself and the distance you gain using it. This is why dead hard is the best exhaustion perk.

Platform : PS4

Bug type: Gameplay 
---
Description: Michael Myers being able to stalk survivors through certain materials with no line of sight,  including but limited to; certain trees,  blue barrels,  haybales, and lockers. 
---
Currently tested on the game and cousins farm,  will update as I find more that he can stalk through. 
---
You’re gonna lose your distortion tokens pretty damn fast.... 
---
I know the saying of "stiff as a board" but you don't have to take it so literally. 
---
Just wait until the new matchmaking starts.  All survivors load together regardless if they are swf or solo (according to the devs). Wonder how long it will take some killers to realize that.
---
It’s helping my team. Especially when I bring a flashlight or an instant heal. I just can’t sit in one spot for a minute staring at my screen for skillchecks. Lol I rather actively be running around
---
Doing gens, you?
---
It over complicates a minor problem. As someone pointed out, this would be super annoying to people who aren't in swf. And do you really think they're going to make it so somehow only swf players have to wait? What if there's two swf's and one pair dies? What if one of them is a streamer? They could just look at their stream and see what perks they have after he dies if one from the swf is already dead. See the problem is so minor yet the solution is so complicated and most likely people will just find a way around it. Not worth it, just deal with it. 
---
Object of Obssession, Self Care, Balanced Landing, Urban Evasion/Lightweight
---
I literally defended my point in a comment below. I'm to lazy and copy and paste so your gonna have to go read it. It should be fairly obvious. Example you don't need a perk to to tier 3 with Michael or a perk to knock mutuple survivors with ONE charge stack with leather face 
---
But you do need perks equipped with survivors to self heal or  use dead hard or use decisive strike. These are the perks thay are special to each character before being Teachable perks 
---
A person behaving such as you isn't worth any more effort 
---
Look at the bottom of my original post. And not everybody is a streamer lol so I'd still fix the problem most games. It's really not complicated it all lol.
---
My main concern. 
---
I think it’s manageable though if you only try to use it if your group doesn’t know where the killer is already. 
---
Also not dumb if i can perfectly defend it with valid points in a humble manner. 
---
Hi. Friendly survivor swfer here.
---
This is silly
---
Not because it's a bad idea
---
But because it won't work.
---
We always play around Blood Warden by not hiding in the end gates
---
Remember me does fuck all tbh
---
I got DCes, hook suicides, constant locker jumps, and hatch campers match after match after match. Eventually ran out of wards and down to my last Tuft and Tombstone, resorted to force quitting the game to protect my add-ons. Had dealt with so much BS just trying to get a trophy I didn't give a shit anymore. 
---
So glad I finally got that fucking trophy. My eternal thanks to the Claudette who jumped right into my hands, and the Ace who gave up and let me know him at the hatch.
---
Thanks, thats a elaborate explanation. Hatch standoffs seem interesting lol.
---
Weren't you the dude saying that if one person dies the game will be over quick? If a full ass swf squad is dead the game will be over soon enough imo. Or they could just find a way to code it to where they show up after just your squad dies
---
I live for the day Nea takes the throne
---
That’s pretty pathetic ngl. 
---
That's not what I mean. If you know bw is coming, you just charge the gate to 99% and wait for the hook. It completely negates the perk. And there's more perks that would be effected besides the one
---
Sounds fair to me. Most killers I know live by the rule of securing the last kill when the gates are open unless its clearly farming or you don't care. They could have easily walked out holding hands and singing, instead they got cocky and lost a member. 
---
Lol. You couldn't care less. Hahahaha okay.
---
At first they were to me, but now it’s so pointless lol... as a killer main I usually don’t care whether I get a 3man vs 4man, so I’ll just smack the survivor once and let them jump in so I don’t waste 30mins+
---
Are you serious? Here I was convinced it just didn't work with Jeffs, because I had 3 matches in a row where every co-op action I did was with a Jeff.
---
DBD makes me Ps4 chug like a passenger jet engine whenever it's loading.
---
Like I sincerely worry it's going to burst into flames just trying to start the game.
---
And your welcome. Learn something new every day my dude. 
---
No it's just a meme people like...
---
I mean. It's a fun movie and it's definitely better than the book.
---
So the devs accidentally made an all but on demand fully stacked 10 seconds' worth of a Sole Survivor and Dance With Me combo? 
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
I also would like to major in bat man
---
Yep its billy
---
Oh shit we're facing Jaraxxus, Eredar Lord of the Burning Legion. 
---
You do realize they'll just DC in the match instead of dodging the lobby, right?
---
Perhaps a X% increase to all actions involving generators and altruism (exclude door and dying state recovery) for a DC to all survivors. The quitter bonus for killer is a hard set bloodpoint amount isn't it? I've never really paid attention to it but I don't think giving x2/3/4 bp would be a good alternative. Especially if its a DC at the end of the game when you already have 90% of the gens done and Mr Toxic finally goes down and rages.
---
obviously, but I mean getting killed by it, not me using it on others. but I would assume it'd be equally as annoying
---
Stranger...? 
---
**It's the cyclooooops!**
---
  
---
**RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN**
---
Ranks dont really mean much in this game since the start of 2018, all it represents is the amount you play each month
---
I have a new rule, run Mori ONLY if I think the enemy is SWF.  
---
I lost all mercy for SWF, too many bad people turned me into a less caring killer.  
---
Of course, if they are friendly and just want points, smash that pallet in my face and lets go baby 
---
I think you missed the point.
---
Ive hated claudettes since i started the game. My very first match was a claudette who farmed me and tbagged my dead body. Ever since then i will be very cautious while playing with them
---
Im with David
---
Ok thanx
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that has been noticing this trend. Solo queue is a nightmare right now on PS4. Most of my teammates don't know what they're doing and I feel like I have to be the one that does everything. Gens, rescues, wasting the killer's time, etc. Meanwhile they're crouching around at the sound of a heartbeat, being over altruistic, or desperately looking for Ruin. 
---
Seen this post so many times
---
Yeah seen this post so many times already
---
Why? Because she used a perk to help her escape?
---
i know. it's more of a personal achievement for me than anything.
---
Damn. That is really sad to hear. Even if you are a bad killer, you can easily get to at least  rank 7.
---
Well my point is that your suggestion wouldn't actually fix the problem. Maybe you're right for BW but that's about it. Most perks are so easy to read during gameplay and once it is, it's then communicated across the Comms and that's it.
---
Smart people play around perks so heavily anyway even without Comms. What you're seeing as swf communicating after death might not even be that.
---
It's also only effective if you're running an aura reading perk AND only works three times. It's not that amazing unless you run Nurse's Calling.
---
First off, Welcome to Dead by Daylight! There are lots of pretty cool players who will happily wish you "gg" after a good match, whether they're on the winning or losing side. You have lots of cool games ahead of you, with really fun players, close calls, and other good stuff. 
---
Unfortunately, there are far too few players who view this game as having actual "people" behind the names, and many would rather use it as a place to act on their own insecurities. There's plenty of toxic players, both as survivors and killers, who would rather make the other player(s) feel bad, than actually have fun playing a game together. 
---
DBD makes it really easy to be that kind of toxic player, so you just gotta roll with the punches, and enjoy the games you can. 
---
Also, DBD's ranking system usually prevents new players from playing with seasoned players (and most new players aren't as toxic as you're describing), so there's a good chance you were playing with seasoned players, who had intentionally de-ranked to play with less experienced players, because they couldn't handle an experienced killer. It doesn't help you, but might make you feel better that they went through that much effort to feel better about themselves.  
---
Hehe whoops
---
This has happened to me with haunted grounds
---
What I don’t understand with this game is there’s no way to communicate to your teammates in game, tf is the point of that? If they didn’t want people to communicate then why would they allow SWF? They haven’t thought it through.
---
Spine chill isn’t a survivor perk...
---
Using third party software to alter the game is against the rules. Providing voice communication theough third party programs in a game which doesn’t allow it is altering the game.
---
well the issue is they nerfed BNP even though it's an ultra rare which to me didn't make much sense
---
I wish I played the game just to see how laggy it was 
---
People who use aimbots or speedhacks can be people who just want to have fun with their friends too. Fun is not exclusive to legitimate play.
---
No. Spirit cannot see blood while Phase Walking without the glasses add-on. And glasses work like Bloodhound when phased, so it's a waste on her.
---
Ok, one yes it is, two neither is BBQ and Chili
---
&gt;billy
---
It looks like the entity went on a little bit of overdrive in the basement right here
---
oh.. okay, thank you.
---
R/woooosh
---
That's amazingly evil and I'll probably use it, thanks!
---
You get more and more as your level goes up, but when you hit level 50, the amount of xp required to level up and the amount of shards you get remains the same until you hit a new devotion level
---
&gt; find a way to code it
---
I don't code, but it sounds like a complicated solution for a minor problem to me. 
---
Sure they would feel guilty but i dont think they would snap espically since the entire time they didnt even know they were commiting the murder and theres a difference between going batshit insane and feeling guilt for something you have done
---
The irony is that playing against the build people run to get the acheivement isn't fun either.
---
i just found that the higher i went, it was harder to get by without getting gen rushed into oblivion. i couldnt even count the times where by the time i downed one person there were 2-3 gens popped. i wish i didn't feel the need to run it, and im envious that you can get by without it!
---
Don't need no buff just use frakies tape ezzzzz
---
The killer probably wasn’t using ruin to slow the game down.... “just a little bit”
---
forever stuck between 16-14 on console and Ill get teammates that just walk around the map and act too altruistic in front of an oncoming killer 
---
It wouldn't be hard to track.
---
Oh God this game has gotten too toxic help
---
It’s ridiculous, if they are bringing it Dedicated Servers in the summer they also need to start implementing systems that other games have been doing for years to counteract this type of behaviour 
---
its not fun but blame bhvr for making it.
---
Was thinking more like the ring 
---
"In a game of life or death you either live, or you die"
---
It was never funny
---
That's why I use Stake Out
---
DBD is the only game that ever crashed my whole console.  I can't remember if it was an Xbox One S or if it was after I got the Xbox One X but the game itself didn't just crash and you had to restart it.  It would completely crash the console to the point of it needing to do a full reboot.
---
Was definitely concerned about the well-being of the console when that was happening.
---
Why not, his boss is the person who made the arrangements. If it weren’t for his boss, Philip (the wraith) wouldn’t have killed anyone. He had blood on his hands because of his boss. If he had lost his mind because of what he’d done, killing the person who he saw as true evil would be fine. 
---
Does anyone have a blank canvas of this
---
im quaking in my boots what does this mean jglfjgldfkjg;dg
---
i mean object of obsession does work when you are in a locker while concealing your aura from the killer tho... dont really feel the need to use distortion on it tho...
---
And this is officially the first time I’ve ever seen a 4-digit ping in any game. Thank you
---
Thanks, Scott. For a moment I thought my info was completely off. Get better soon! 
---
“All for nothing” was my favorite part. Happens to all of us. 
---
Is there such a thing as a passive rape scene?
---
&gt; It definitely competes with lithe for worst exhaustion perk.
---
I will take lithe over Sprint Burst any day
---
I think the first one might be nurse specific. A nurse with noed was camping one of my friends and we all looked but couldn't find the lit totem.
---
I just don’t get why he would go into insanity, yes that is a traumatic experience.
---
The other killers kind of made more sense and felt like they had more thought put into them.
---
I’m sure people would feel a lot more than guilt learning they’ve killed so many. You have soldiers who fight on the battlefield, who are trained to kill people. And still are heavily traumatized once they’ve done that. So some average person would definitely lose their mind
---
The worst is when you’re getting camped and they all just stay crouched nearby waiting to unhook you. Which they never do anyway. But they stay crouched there till you die then run off. If I’m getting camped at least do gens. 
---
&gt; wait for bbq in shrine.
---
Prepare to wait longer than matchmaking with SWF.
---
Just buy Leatherface, level him, get BBQ, and never play him.  Thats what I did unfortunately.
---
&gt;whole shit show that went down 
---
what happened?
---
It’s easy to pip with legion because by using hi ability you also injure survivors. So you get a lot to your emblem for 1. Using your ability and 2. Constantly injuring them by just the use of your ability. Also when you hit then, you ‘win’ that chase. 
---
I relate to this on a spiritual level
---
I bought, leveled, got bbq, and now main. Because I can’t play billy.
---
McCauley Culkin? 
---
The legion buff came all ready as he got released it's his add-on Fraikes tapp
---
yessss, I put Kindred3 on all of my characters so when I get hooked people can at least understand whats going on
---
thats hilarious hahaha
---
Sounds like holding the game hostage to me
---
Report all!!!
---
*hit or miss, I guess they never miss huh?*
---
I'm sorry
---
Just long enough they will quit all together 
---
why you mad? hetting moried is part of the game imagine a killer not being able to kill and just only put people on hooks
---
Yeah it does ruin the game in my opinion. But the worst is when Myers runs unlimited Tier 3 and can also kill healthy survivors. That’s so stupid and I don’t think that should be in the game at all. 
---
Yep. That is why you crouch away and hide till they come and go. I have the worst luck with killers coming towards me at the very start of the game so u naturally just crouch and hide until they come and go.
---
Just chase them out and move on. You’ll get more powerful perks and add-ons as you level up which makes games easier. Sometimes you’ll have bad games and have survivors teabag you at exit. Just eat it and move onto the next. Sorry if this is just as wrong but when you do end up having that good game then nod your head at the last survivors on the hook as they die. That’s basically one of the killer’s ways of teabagging lol
---
Just annoying when is happens 4x in a row is all 
---
this is oozing ochido and has humour potential for about 3 seconds before it gets old 
---
*insta leaves generator*
---
Hmm yeah that can be frustrating 
---
I missed the part where that's my problem 
---
theres a lot of things I dont know on this planet but if I do know one thing and that is your a dirty mf'ing liar jk congrats 
---
Surprisingly no, just really bad at the game
---
Flashlight items can be tough to play against but now they added flashlight map offerings? They’ve gone too far with this one 
---
*oinks in teleportation*
---
yup. i'm feeling like because of that legion is the easiest to climb to 1 with, lol.
---
On PS4 everyone loads in at the same time regardless a lot of times. So it’s really hard to tell. 
---
He def deserved it for using mori lol. He also deserved it for not even attempting to juggle u
---
it’s an alright movie and a better but sometimes boring book.
---
Epicc addon for Hag
---
Removed for double posting 
---
I honestly don't know whether it's because I'm lucky, good, or console Legion's easier, but once they finish the first 2 gens, things tend to actually get a lot easier. There's obviously been times where I just get rushed regardless, but they seem to be surprisingly far in between.
---
Literal baby killer
---
Wraith is my favorite lore because it's pretty unique, and Philip Ojomo is just such an everyman. 
---
Dead by Daylight in a nutshell
---
Y did u do dis
---
Exactly
---
11 now
---
He was too. It's honestly bullshit that spawns can literally remove a perk before you even have a chance to defend it
---
I got the game 1/weeks ago so still a bit new
---
I think it makes the game way too easy for killers but it's not like it's every game or anything. 
---
Whenever I use it, I try not to actually use the mori until survivors are on death hook. Get more BP for 2 hooks, plus it gives the player a chance to play more. However, I always have players suicide on the hook or straight up DC when they see I have a mori. It can get annoying. I'm sure that's why you have killers who "ruin the game" and just mori off the bat, because otherwise survivors don't even let you use it. 
---
Hail Lord Potato!
---
I have no idea how you came to that conclusion lol
---
Dam that’s shitty then
---
&gt; I'm punk so I must rebel
---
Wtf, I thought you *must* rebel to qualify as being punk
---
Predator is really good. helps you out a bunch with current shitty situation with scratch marks. 
---
well I play killer mostly but I'm usually around rank 8 survivor and rank 1 killer but even I don't use mories much but I can say that killers i  higher ranks who are aware they can do this and a bit more toxic will have it on often  but the fact that you get them is bad luck I suppose 
---
the box on the ground. 
---
It takes quite some time for him to hit T3 with tombstone and tuft. I main Myers and it be rough. Also if you realize he has tuft and tombstone just jump into lockers. They’ll be forced to hook you and can’t tombstone you. 
---
But if you get injured/ are injured , the slowing down could mean a hit, or if you aren’t, you get auto sprint burst from getting injured. Also difficult to time and is canceled if you want to: repair, sabo, unhook, heal, slow vault, hide, cleanse. Only really useful application is throwing down a pallet first before doing, and there isn’t a guarantee one will be present. I guess if they are distracted by teammates that could buy enough time, but unless they’re running empathy/bond, the timing required would be very difficult. Unless they were walking and the killer saw them, started chasing them, and they were near you, then, noticing the killer, sprint bursts away, probs won’t hadplen.
---
well damn eve n worst q bad intro well everyday isnt gonna be like that so that something I'll say 
---
A David and I were having a hatch standoff. I had an overall pretty bad game against a good swf team and they got an exit open where three escaped. I knew where the hatch was so I just immediately went there following the three running out. I met the David there right when the hatch opened. He obvi didn’t dare to immediately jump in when I got there and it was clear he wanted the hatch escape so this standoff lasted about five minutes (thankfully). I frankly didn’t think he deserved it so I was not gonna budge. Eventually after he spent the five minutes teabagging the hatch and me just standing there completely still, he ran to the nearby open exit. However, he did not run out. He ran all the way back to the hatch where I was standing completely still, he attempts to jump in right in front of me and I grabbed him and hooked him. After the game he said he thought I was AFK and his swf group was laughing at him. I said that’s what he gets for being greedy
---
I think it’s more of a getting 10 games in a row with ebony moris is frustrating cause legit during the winter event with how easy it was to get ebony moris on my blood web, I wasn’t surprised myself that when playing survivor I was getting ebony moris b2b. 
---
If I’ve never reached R1 on both survivors and killers in time in 400 hours, do I suck?
---
As a psychologist I can confirm that it can happen. People react to things differently. 
---
Def made a mistake not bringing franklins and smacking everyone around the downed survivor lol he was in for a bad time from the beginning
---
I'll probably be down-voted for this, but the bottom left one has never made sense to me, if you dye your hair crazy colors is that not literally looking for attention? i'm not saying it's a bad thing but why else would you dye your hair if not to want people to see it?
---
Lf is just a shitties Billy tho
---
Yes. If you play often and like getting things from the bloodweb for that character often then absolutely. Why waste time upgrading the same bloodweb over and over. You actually get far more rare items and add ons from the bloodweb more often at higher prestige
---
Leatherface? Good on early ranks.
---
I used to DC against Myers because I thought his lack of a terror radius was bull shit.
---
I used to main Myers and use NOED a fair bit, I’ll give you my reason:
---
By the time it’s the end of the game, there’s no more stalk/no time to stalk: Everyone knows they’re exposed when they hear the music but NOED is a silent pop. The only time I used NOED on Michael now is if I can’t hit Tier III by fast/normal means.
---
&gt;Frame rate is always at 62
---
It is capped. You can change it in the game files if your monitor has a higher refresh rate.
---
Hahahah!
---
Mori is cool and all because of the awesome animation of killing with your own hand uniquely with each killer but it does ruin the game. Especially ebony mori. As a killer main, I never ever use mori because I want a fair game. I’d say a fair way to keep it in the game would be to only let the killer mori if the survivor is on death hook
---
Yes that seems like a good balance, it is cool and fun for the first time but after that it’s just frustrating 
---
Yeah until they fix the bug 
---
Nani?
---
It costs survs time to get in a locker. You may use another Cannibal perk that hides downed auras or let a downed person rest for 20 secs or so, then when you pick him up, survs usually don’t jump in a locker in time.
---
Monitor and abuse + Carburetor Tuning Guide + Muffler is more reliable.

Tinkerer just doesn't cut it sometimes.

It's literally opposite when I'm the killer, I get gen rushed with 3 tool boxes and and medkit with ds, with 2 p3 Claudettes, but when I'm the survivor my team is literally brain dead XD. It's a hard knock life
---
I would love to see him having an option of masks. 
---
The Game is actually a terrible map for Nurse, as her ability is only useful when she has line of sight with a survivor. If not, you'd be taking a shot in the dark blinking through a wall, something that you will swiftly be punished for, most likely by losing the chase.
---
Dwight fo sho
---
Well #1 welcome; #2 they aren’t really being dicks. I will teabag regardless
---
It really depends on how altruistic the survivors are in combination with how soon she can get the first few hooks secured.
---
My idea to fix hatch standoffs. 1: let the killer close the hatch if the killer finds it first. 2: just give the hatch a damn timer, I think 2-3mins is plenty of time to find it and if you can't then you don't deserve it. Simple as that but survivor mains would cry to the devs and get it reverted
---
I think it is a bug. There's been a lot of other threads about this very issue and everyone has been saying it's a bug. I only made a new thread because no one really sees the others.
---
Yeah I do that but I didn’t actually think it would work cause I thought it wouldn’t this saved my life and is what eventually allowed me to escape 
---
Sorry bro you gotta get tough fast if you want to live on these streets. Don't come down Lampkin Lane we gonna take your shoes.  &gt;:)
---
Don't take the post game teabagging personally. Survivors get some extra points if you hit them on the way out, so a lot of us hang out at the end gates a bit. Just give 'em a good slap and send them on their way.  I'd go as far to say don't take any teabagging personally, it isn't always meant to be insulting.
---
I feel bad cause sometimes it’s some people going for the Evil Incarnate achievement which honest to god is one of the hardest to get. But I GOTTA DO WHAT I DO TO SURVIVE.

Why’s she wearing that? As the new top tier killer I thought she’d have Freddy’s sweater for sure

I've met like 1 Leatherface that was a cool dude in the game (cool dude meaning they weren't an absolute cunt with camping and using nothing but their chainsaw)
---
Wow! It’s almost as if we don’t like being flashed and taunted every 5 seconds!
---
Yeah that achievement is haf 
---
People are downvoting because they don't understand the reference. They should just keep their mouths shut about things they don't understand
---
she's so cute!!!!!!! i love ur art style and it kind of reminds me of velma from scooby doo
---
Legion dosent need a buff, even im his current state he can still do work due to his movespeed, ability to injure most of the team at a very fast speed as well as being able to ignore dropped pallets and windows at the cost of an extra hit.
---
Personaly in my opinion the devs should go with their origional plan of making legion gain hes power by stalking, increseing the threat of getting pallet stuns and in turn they should also make franks mixtape base due to legion now needing to work for their power. I would in addition also like to ser a version of maskless legion being apart of their kit, mabey as a form of map control (attackless frenzy thats has infinate use but a slighly longer stun when its cancled.)
---
Oh boy yeah

And we thought Nea was the spy/killer this whole time...

So I was looking through the tutorials and tip sections, and found this little tidbit at the end of the hooks and sacrifice section. This makes it seem like getting a 4k will be something special; after all, it earns the Entity's favor. I'd assume that'd mean something big would happen. But getting a 4k gives nothing different from any other game. There's no special reward for it. So is this just worded wrongly or what?
---
Dave said whatever nutrients the entity gets from devouring pieces of hope from survivors it can choose to share it with the killers in the form of moris. I believe one of the moris says something along the lines of “you have done well this one is yours”. So I assume the more they kill the more bloodpoints they get to get resources like the moris. Kind of like throwing some of your food on the floor for your dog to eat but.
---
Probably something to do with the Entity infecting his mind. 
---
Wouldn't the opposite of an aggressive rape scene be a tender rape scene? Still I'm not sure how that would look like.
---
Dead hard is good though? That’s why almost everyone I go against as killer uses it
---
He’s literally the price of lunch, skip lunch for a day, his perks are well worth it.  
---
Lf allows multi kills and that's enough reason to be an experience in its own
---
holy fuck. Thats toxic.
---
Yeah... thats litteraly what i said. My suggestion would make legion need to work for a down by needing to stalk allowing for more outplay opertunitys and in turn increaseing the threat of getting pallet stunned makeing it a valid counter as it forces legion to need to build up his stalk again.
---
Probably SWF or you have to many toolboxes. 
---
Dude I was at full health as he hit me once before I could run to the exit and was insta downed the second he hit me. 
---
You get 3.5k No One Escaped.. that's S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
He hit me once and I went from full health to downed I was so confused. 
---
You see I thought this achievement was bugged thank you for this info.
---
Sounds like NOED
---
Like you went down instantly? Or was there some waiting time?
---
If it was instant, we’re all gens done? Or did you just pull somebody off a hook? 
---
Use Whispers if you have it 
---
Hardly, all I see is PS4 players moaning about framrate and getting DLC weeks later then everyone else. 
---
Well i use bbq and distortion hides the user pretty much for the whole game. Good for being the gen jockey.
---
It is amazing cause first and foremost, it's a counter for BBQ and it works pretty well here.
---
Yes, when you get LUCKY, your perk lasts more than a MINUTE. What a great perk, truly amazing. And how likely is it that you get this lucky minute when you're using infinite tombstone? Not very likely. Even if it somehow lasts that long, you can be sure it's about to be cleansed, because once they see you have Ruin, they're going to make it their only mission to destroy it.

it's more fun than going against clown, spirit or legion

Holy moly!

I love Doctor. love playing him, against him, dream about him, love him, breath him. he's gorgeous.
---
Same the doctor is just annoying to go against

Good video but it woulda been great if you would have matched visual gameplay of the build with the build you were talking about

Latency maybe ? I always dodge when it's over 100 ms

He may have other games to play

I lose most my Doctor matches but I have fun, more fun than LF anyway

this is what i signed up for after buying dbd
---
I hate him the most. I’m a legion main, so I don’t mind playing against him since I know what to do... but I have no idea what to do against doctor. Run?? The screams reveal you. Do a gen? Impossible skill check. Heal others? Pray he doesn’t have Nurses
---
I did that once, he told me that I sounded like a fat sack of shit that spends their time in the basement.

I go 30 minutes without a lobby as survivor, my killer fills up fast though.
---
Most relatable comment I've ever seen looool
---
When I first started playing the game I did, since he can counter stealth quit easily.  Nowadays I do not even bother with stealth, so I have no real issue with him.  I would rather go against a Doctor than a Trapper, since I am always paranoid about random traps being all over the place with Trapper.  Doctor is easy to loop with the only real threat being his ability to sometimes interrupt then, but that can be avoided pretty easily by just throwing down pallets a little earlier than one normally would.
---
That's what getting ill, going to hospital, and having to take a 9 month break from Uni leads to
---
you know, you can see the ping in lobby right?
---
Must have a better gaming chair 
---
Remember to do something else too! But good thing you aren’t that sick so you can do stuff.
---
Out of that 1 of 10000 scenarios when it actually happens
---
I mean, I completely agree with you except for the ranking system part. I’m Rank 2 Survivor and was put with a 10 survivor, 16 surv, 17 surv and a 17 killer. The killer was a Myers who facecamped me and when I asked why he said it was because “I pissed him off for looping him” when all I did was put down two pallets on him
---
Thats exactly it
---
Platform: All
---
Type of Bug: Visual, In-Game
---
Description: When wiping blood off of The Clown's blade after hitting someone, the animation doesn't fully play, thus resulting in a stiff animation where the knife doesn't bob with The Clown's movement. Seems to happen nearly everytime you hit someone.
---
Reproduction rate: 100% I'd say. 
---
To really consider yourself knowing most of the important stuff, you'll need about 300 hours of gameplay. People say looping is easy, but it's really not, it's a lot of experience in play. Yes for veterans with 1000-3000 hours it's jokingly easy, but newer players need a hell lot of time to even get to the point were they feel kinda comfortable versing a good killer. 
---
It appears good then in game it magically gets back.
---
explain
---
Because Kate
---
Just because she has a ranged attack doesn't mean everyone will be good enough to use it correctly
---
Haha yes karma farming haha yes
---
Then simply say lack of skill of players is why they run noed lol. 
---
tbf thats why she is locked behind a pay wall.
---
Hey, that was me haha
---
I remember this, I was stalking the other guy and I heard Jeff healing. Saw him running above me and well... gg LOL
---
I suspect in some form the reason they have not done this, as with all the license killers is that the different costumes and iterations of the characters are their own Copyrights stuff, which mean that more purchase negotiations would have to go through, and for every new costumes and version they would likely have to be the rights to that version.
---
Idk am gay so it was funny 
---
I found it funny don’t get me wrong LMAO. It was more of a oh god whyxjdjjd die of laughter y did u do dis. It’s brilliant. Wish I thought of it sooner fam.

Let the man speak.

You literally compared Huntress to Nurse...

So you're saying huntress is a M1 killer with 110% move speed?

No, but if you are absolute garbage with hatchets, you might as well be

---
I believe it is one of the tips in the loading screens: The main goal of the killer is to hook survivors
---
You obviously don’t get what I’m saying here. You said she needs noed because of her movement speed. In your first comment up above, which I responded with huntress has long range hatchets which is why she does not have that movement speed? Now what is the nurse movement speed? 96.25 which is lower than 115% speed as well. And you said by blinking, which is what I mean with huntress. 
---
The reason why some killers have a lower movement speed is because they have some form of ability that does not rly need the average movement speed other killers have.
---
Yes, once hes hooked i start smacking him until i just swing up in the sky.
---
I didn't say she needs Noed, but if you aren't good with her, you should probably use it
---
I personally don’t encourage people to use noed to get better at a certain killer because it doesn’t help you improve. Most tend to just rely on noed for that kill. NOED doesn’t help you aim hatchet better anyways.

They are just salty because they lose

---
I think killers should be able to pick where on the map their totems spawn from a list of preset hex spawns.
---
Would add a neat dynamic because survivors could learn the best hex spawns and check there, but then the killer could predict they would look at the best spots first and put it somewhere else.  There would have to be a ton of hex spawns on the map to choose from to prevent everyone from easily learning all the places. After the killer chooses where the hex spawn is, then the killer / survivor spawn points would be chosen, with a certain distance between the hex and any survivor spawn being accounted for.
---
God I hate that structure. I can never find my way out as survivor of killer.
---
&gt;I heard that this use to be a thing but survivors would constantly dodge killers that they didn't like.
---
Well maybe there would be less actual DC's ingame.
---
&gt; Killers shouldn't be able to facecamp and be toxic towards a survivor that they don't like because of their name. 
---
It's not so much about their name, there's just so many killers who check your profile and see you have screenshots with you wearing legacy or that you have above 3k hours and then they just leave because "they don't want to be bullied".
---
I think it's annoying.
---
You can’t fix it, the killer is the host so these things happen. Dedicated servers will probably fix these lags
---
but i have it every game not only with this killer..
---
That’s the joke!
---
Upvote for awesomeness

Would be neat if it really would be gone from chests. What remains is only to remove it from bloodweb and voila! :D

Max for 2 secs ye. As you Said. I do 180  then start wigle to sides left and right As much As i can on my left analog stick. Kinda more to downer part of that analog. If i do it in upper part of that stick it never work l. If you know what i mean. But ye i must be super Fast and it works only like 1x from 5 attempts. Sorry bad english :) Hope u understood.

**NO WHOOSHING BECAUSE OF MANY WINTER GIFT BOXES GIVING ME INSANE ADD-ONS**

A better idea is for the first 30 seconds of a trial, no totems are visible.

r/nice

I would say any killer under rank 5 is probably not going to make any mistakes. My favorite ranks are 6-10 because there’s a variety of killers and they still do make mistakes in chases. Survivor rank doesn’t matter too much BECAUSE of the deranking. Killer rank is more accurate because it takes too long and is harder to derank due to only being able to afk or DC. 
---
I swear its bugged because I've been doing gems with others and it won't go up at all
---
I'm probably gonna end up doing the same, always been a procastintor too. Besides, I can't really do much now since my supervisor has been absent for the entire semester (research leave lol) and the substitute doesn't care. I guess I'll equip some good perks and speed write my dissertation when the time comes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Buff them, nerf them, rework them, idgaf. But take away their ability to farm BP like a champ and I’ll be salty lol.

Please tell me the cowrus comment is copypasta

&gt; Hi guys. So i just need to know.
---
Why so you can continue being toxic? Of what possible value do you NEED to know it?

also when somebody missed a skillcheck

&gt; I would say any killer under rank 5 is probably not going to make any mistakes.

I like how you've seen only one guy baiting you and now think nobody does nothing
---
Just asking? I would like to know what you're going to do with it. That's all. I guess I'm a bit butthurt. I just don't see the reason to be able to do it. NOR the reason to post it on reddit instead of just searching it up on YouTube or truing to learn it yourself.
---
Tbh nothing in this game frustrates me more than non-obsession dickstrike.
---
I can be flashlighted all game, juked, looped, get 0 hooks, that’s all fine. But have someone hop off my shoulder when I don’t expect it? At least a pinch of salt right there.
---
That glitch annoys me so much especially when the survivor disconnects mid grab so the gen is still progressing.
---
Cuz i want to Master dbd even more?? Its skill that i can want to be able to bring off. 
---
And this is why I hate pèlaying as or aginst legion. Playing as him makes you fell extremelly weak, compared to most other killers, even wraith. Playing against him is even worst, since you can outplay him 3 times in quick succession like in the video and still get hit. If legion decides to tunnel you, then you will go down, becouse as soon as frenzy comes back he will hit you. The only counterplay is hoping that your team is doing gens and not crouching in a corner
---
Will it offer you no advantage TBH. I personally have never seen anyway make use out of moonwalking, unless it's just to be cool.
---
Lmao stop being smart ass There no tutorials for it. Thats why iam asking here. Leave i Dont care. 
---
It's your overall score multiplied by any boosts you have. In this game there were 2 party streamers (+100% each) and bbq and chilli (100%), so there was a 400% modifier
---
Now that invalidates data instantly, you cant just take data from all ranks for ballance.
---
I meant if you're tbagging the killer. If you're tbagging the killer, the only reason you're doing it, is to insult the killer. Tbagging other survivors is different
---
U can easily pull of 360 out of it and confused Killer. So ye no use ať all.. - _-
---
Well I've never seen it happen in one of my games as killer or survivor.
---
It's not about everybody else, it's about the person who was hooked and now being camped.
---
So, they had around \~5-10min of matchmaking in best case scenario, including map loading and stuff.
---
They may have a rare item with valuable addons.
---
They played around 3 minutes at best and now they are hooked.
---
They watch LF camping until they die.
---
It's a real quality gameplay, you should play survivor, find LF and be camped several matches in a day.
---
You clearly seem to care since you keep responding.
---
He didn’t give it a chance did he
---
how? legion is stupid? franzy, hit, chase, second hit then follow the survivor BUT keep him out of your field of view. let him bleed to 1/3 health then a last stab.   
---
takes about 30 seconds.  
---
maybe BBQ to make it to a new player in less then another 30 sec  
---
&gt; There no tutorials for it.
---
Here you go buddy.

It's not uncommon to see survivors tea bag to draw aggro, or just to see if the killer will tilt and play more aggressively. It's as much of a function as it is a statement. 
---
I  was leveling up have and saw this but now I got ruin ahhhhh reeeeeeeee
---
When did I say NOED was fine?
---
All I'm saying is that for me personally DS feels the worst. It's the most unfun thing in the game.
---
If I'm being chased then NOED sucks ass because I'm guarenteed to die unless thebther survivors fid the totem quickly. If im not being chased then its possible to hide. Many killers just camp near their hook once NOED activates. The main problem with NOED however is that it enables camping during the game as many killers fall back on Noed to mop up the rest. Meanwhile DS enables toxic little shits to carry on being toxic. Both are massive crutches.
---
To me DS, NOED and Adrenaline all need to go at once.
---
U R so dumb omg. Watch that video u dumb shit. U R the one that need to be smart everytime. Watch that video u shithead. He did not explain it at all. Gtfo u morron
---
You're still telling the killer they suck, even if it is to get attention. 
---
I saw the video, and from what I got, it doesn't matter in the clip he fucked up and would have died if it weren't for dead hard. Feel free to send me a clip/video so I can see how you are suppose use it.
---
What?
---
Anyone ever tell you the definition of insanity?
---
A lot of casuals have quit. 
---
The NOED change has made playing survivor tedious. Search times are too long and there aren't enough new players because the game.is overpriced on PS4 anyway.
---
Just blocked bye noob

I like how the only realistic advice got downvoted

This feeling, something I haven’t felt for a long time

Because it's also a copyright issue. There's also the risk that he'll look too different if they go for Hobo Myers.

That being said, the Myers from Zombie's first film would look cool. I'd rather the 2018 mask though.
---
Haven’t seen the other two, but Bird Box is awful.
---
Looks more like he's sitting than squatting 
---
DCing for deranking is still annoying. I hope those people will get a temporary ban for DCing for more than a few times a day. I hope the dedicated servers will do that.  Thats one of the things I really hope for. I'm sick of people DCing because they just got downed for the first time .

it's just because of the blur. it hurts my eyes

ScottJund made a really good idea regarding hex totems. 
---
The totems only lit up once they actually come into effect. So for example devour hope starts after 1 stack, Huntress's lulaby after 1 hook, ruin after a skillcheck, etc.
---
Removed - Unrelated Content
---
I've been to rank 1. I am currently rank 12, because I barely touched the game for two consecutive rank resets for a handful of different reasons that have nothing to do with intentional deranking (a sudden move, other video games, etc.) It has nothing to do with how good you are, it has everything to do with how much you play every month. Very few people, comparatively, play the game enough to get to red rank every single month -- especially to get to red ranks IMMEDIATELY after reset. (This is why someone like ScottJund plays other games on stream after rank reset because waiting 45+ minutes for a lobby isn't fun to watch.)
---
Yeah, the locker option is great but you don't always have time for this. The new Jeff perk is intended to be a BBQ counter and it works great to use it as that. But yes, you can also use the locker to keep the token and counter it a couple of more times.

Nea with her new Mean Streets collection outfit. If not that, then her Mean Streets hair, ugly Christmas sweater, and the ripped leggings.

This is how mafia workks
---
What the hell are you talking about? People loop to survive and delay being caught to buy time for their team to work on gens.
---
If you think looping makes someone toxic (an "ochido wannabe") then you either suck as survivor, or suck as killer. 
---
But you can also hide behind a gen. You don't need to use a perk to counter BBQ, there are so many options anyways. Rarely will you not be able to do one of the 3
---
Being behind a gen. Gens have red auras, so ir you're behind a gen from where the killer is hooking, your revealed aura will be in the red aura of the gen, and therefore the killer won't see your aura. You didn't know about it?

Tell her she is awsome !

Turn your sadness into hate.

Mirrors exist.

Thank you brother :D

Bad take. The Game is fantastic for nurse. Listen more carefully, use aura perks, and just get some experience and you can blink through floors and walls very accurately. 
---
Wear it like a badge of honor. My steam profile is full of salty survivors. 
---
Probably because you don't camp, seems like the only way to make survivors stop doing gens is to camp lol. Because whenever I'm getting camped, none of them are doing gens and they don't save either, literally just standing there waiting for a moment to save which never happens.

It's true people fucking hate legion, I played her for most of the double bp event and got so many angry messages for playing him. Wasn't messages about me playing unfair or anything, just about playing legion.
---
I would say the Spirit is too complicated for a beginner. Theres a lot of good DBD streamers but I'd go with Ardetha since he always comments his videos and gives advice and explains why he does things and stuff. He also has a series called DBD Coaching where Killers send him footage and he comments on it about what things they did good and bad and how they could improve.
---
So watch Ardetha and start with Billy. Simple killer but still top tier.

While all skins including prestige are just cosmetic, P3 Claudette does have a minor advantage over other skins because the model is dark and harder to see on most maps. Unless you are getting it for that reason, or just looking for something new to grind out, not really worth it. It is far from her best skin aesthetically, just the 'best' survivor skin.
---
Yeah, everyone else’s backstories are a bit darker and more macabre. It makes sense for them to be taken by the entity. The Wraith seems so much less violent in comparison. 
---
Isn't P3 a weird flex in itself thi
---
You have to be joking. I've seen literally all of the vaguely popular DBD streamers DC while playing survivor. Hell, angrypug and puppers both DCed from the same match - they weren't in SWF. 
---
Also, check out HybridPanda on YouTube. He does a weekly shrinewatch video that explains perks, but also he plays some amazing games. 
---
Practice is key however and learning your abilities. Find someone you like killing with and go from there. 
---
**NO**
---
No. It's not even how easily he can find me, it's that i'm playing on console. The framerate turns to complete shit and if you wait a pallet to throw it down when you're in madness 3, instead of throwing the pallet down, you start snapping out of it, because they're the same button and the killer gets a free hit. It's really annoying
---
A rule that i like to stick to when playin killer..(that i got off a well known dbd  streamer)..is APPLY MAP PRESSURE
---
whether it be:
---
chasing survivors
---
injuring survivors
---
downing survivors 
---
slowing down generators
---
applying various status effects
---
etc.....
---
I don’t, where exactly is it from?
---
I’m a super sensitive person too. But I’ve adapted to the toxicity. You have to think of it as normal competitive ribbing and less about you as a person. It takes time, but it absolutely gets better as time goes on. 
---
I would also suggest playing survivor to learn more about what they experience on their side. It improves you gameplay immensely to practice both sides. And there is less “performance anxiety” as survivor. So take advantage of that to learn more about the maps, how to hide, how to escape, etc. This will all help you predict them later as killer. 
---
About 8. Or the teammate might have Adrenaline. I can't count thennumber of times I was on the hook and my teammates went for the save before finishing the last gen. Of course, the killer is panicking and tunnels me to oblivion. As soon as I get hooked, the last gen gets done and I die, whereas if they did the last gen and then unhooked me I would be healthy and could even loop the killer to give time to open the gates. And yes, he could have NOED. Its a gamble.
---
You mean deranking as survivor or killer?
---
First part of your post makes me think survivor, but then later you make it sound killer.
---
Killer I can kind of understand because there can be queue time issues. Survivor however though I've never seen anyone have them.
---
I assume you're talking about JenDenise too. Never seen her but hear people often refer to her deranking.
---
This just helps prove my point that devs allow the toxicity because it seels the game. Oh look how funny it is to derank and bully killers. Run around someone less experienced because they dont know how broken the map design can be so they dont know how to play around it. Loop them all game. Looks like fun. Its what keeps people coming back.
---
The devs know this stuff sells, they're a right set of cunts.  This is why they'll never nerf DS.
---
I didn’t loop him though hah
---
People handle extreme situations differently than others. Finding out that you personally have ended who knows how many lives can be a huge shock to the system.
---
Noob3, from the video titled "I got chased for 20 minutes" or something like that
---
Still, it isn't toxic in literally any way. Even if you had looped him, it'd be a terrible excuse for facecamping. The fact that you didn't only makes it worse though
---
If you're bored at least post something thats not useless and that doesnt drown the sub with crap
---
is that a los ... ehm a no0b3 reference?
---
The Meg was never seen again
---
Thank. 
---
Maybe controversional opinion but dont follow "survivor rules" as killer. By this i mean tunneling, camping, 3 gen strat etc basically all the stuff that survivros are complaining about. Play how you want, how you enjoy. Personally i only tunnel when there are 2-3 gens left. Practice is the key so dont be disappointed if you are gonna be demolished in your first games. Also dont facecamp just becouse someone tbag you or stupid shit like that. Its just not worth it. When you facecamp smart survivors will do gens at this time and you will eventually lose the game. Personally  i recommend you to watch ZubatLEL, ScottJund and Tru3Ta1ent if you want some high level killer gameplay.
---
I don't mind him at all. In fact he's pretty easy to beat.
---
Personally I find Hag way more annoying. Especially since I don't use Urban Evasion anymore.
---
Thank you for telling me. I'm unfamiliar with the 3 gen strat. What does it mean?
---
Thnx
---
 Does this mean She can say the n word now?
---
Thanks for the help man, I know lockers lower madness, but is that really the best way to cope? I’ve searched online and it was like “just be good at skillchecks lol” so I don’t really know, help much appreciated 
---
Meta perks are your best friend. Each killer has a unique play style but several meta perks work well on just about every killer. Trouble with loops? Spirit fury and Enduring are your new best friends, ruin is a staple for most killers and is devastating in the low ranks. Nurses calling is great for those pesky survivors constantly bandaging themselves, and or course BBQ and Chili the staple for almost every single killer, 1 stack for each individual survior hooked once for a total of 4 tokens, each token adding 25% to all blood points earned up to 100% its like playing with built in survivor pudding, "But wait, there's more!" It also gives you an aura reading of the whole map (minus the direct area of the hook) great for finding those pesky survivors or discovering all 3 are within range ready to sneak and unhook from you. Youtubers to watch, Monto, Puppers, tru3talant.
---
How do you pull people off of actions? Is it space? 
---
Always try to chainsaw people when you have enough space. Use Q and E to sprint around map.  As Billy main i recommend you to practice using chainsaw without addons. Also change your controller sensitivty to 100% in killer control settings. Hold your chainsaw if survivors are spinning around you. Just watch ZubatLEL if you want to become good Billy.
---
No, they don't. They do it to survive, because it's the most optimal thing to do in a chase
---
Thanks!

I get people do it to survive I do it to survive but I also have seen people go look for the killer to try to loop them
---
Why on earth would you want to? I'd be ashamed to use P3 Claudette.
---
Oh i know, im just saying a realistic consistent implementation of this strategy would involve two people with the same setup
---
Appreciate the kind words! 
---

At rank 1, if you depip you will go to rank 2. You can never not derank at rank 1 if you depip. You might have just played against players who lost badly enough to depip from the rank 1 they started at. Or your game is bugged, both equally likely with this game.
---
I wish I could say I land my D Strike everytime I bring it. I’m such a boosted rank 1 I always miss that shit, but to be fair I do play on console so its harder to land it there x.x 
---
Honestly, the best way to learn at first is just to play a few games. Watching you tubers and learning tips and tricks are better for when you have the basics down. The people you’ll be playing against at first will probably be new as well, so you can experiment with different killers to see which ones you like. 
---
medium if i'm playing survivor and low if i'm playing killer, ultra is too much of a strain without any noticeable difference and it's much easier to see survivors on low since everything is sharper and also there's no fatigue vignette
---
Prob chopped your hear off tbh. 
---
&gt;The devs know this stuff sells, they're a right set of cunts. This is why they'll never nerf DS.
---
Well that's a mean non sequitur.
---
&gt;devs allow the toxicity
---
Are you suggesting to ban people for toxicity?
---
Because that's the only way to not "allow" the toxicity...
---
Playing against unsportsmanlike people is just bad and frustrating but it's better to just bite the bullet and move on. I only get 1 game every ~20 as killer like this. Playing survivor it even more rare. I believe it's bearable.
---
There is no need to overinflate the problem.
---
Nope, it's really easy to do as long as you don't have to stop for generators/healing. Wait until a sliver of exhaustion is left and start sprinting, as long as you don't stop you will Sprint Burst immediately upon letting go of shift.
---
I play 50/50 killer and survivor.  I would absolutely love if they just got rid of DS and NOED as well.  Just straight into the trash can. 
---
not tunneled lol
---
Imagine being slowed down by a fire and a bunch of bones.

I don’t endorse the way survivors are acting but I understand it, with all of the best survivor perks getting nerfed while killer perks that were already good like noed getting huge buffs, it feels like the developers are siding with the killers and we can’t do anything about it, it gets frustrating getting tumbled and camped then told to git gud by the killers who say it’s your own fault, I try to play killer to see if it really is as easy as it seems and it is, I played 4 games and got 4 quad kills and only one of the games the exits got powered. Playing killer is far too easy and makes it not fun for survivors which makes us salty and we can’t do anything about it. Again I don’t endorse this behaviour but I understand it and I want more people to try to see it from the other side.
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying. It counts for pretty much anything cosmetic though; only for her even more. But in general, who the fuck does their hair to then sit inside and play DBD all day? 
---
And doesn't punk inherently mean that you rebel to what is considered 'normal'? And the Asian is so out of place. Two are lifestyle choices and the other is about race. 
---
when i play on my alt to practice killers i’m inexperienced at (alt is currently at rank 17 i believe) i constantly see people at rank 16 and 15 at prestige 3 with other survivor’s teachables it’s absurd
---
That doesn't mean it should be considered ok. I ignore toxic survivors and I don't really care, yet I've had rounds where they are so bad I had to take a break for the rest of the day.
---
If you're brand new to a game and are only getting bad experiences that's super shitty. 
---
I hate this opinion of "Assholes exist and you are a child if you can't deal with them" it should be "Assholes exist but we should try to reduce the number of them"
---
Tell that to the one with the house, I think rancid abattoir (?)
---
I have had the same brach of it for my last 15ish games.
---
I'm sick of it even using map offerings don't work
---

As a stealthy boi he really rains on my parade
---
Let memes breed organically, we live in a cultured time. 
---
Well drawing attention is a great way to keep the killer busy... Which is a mechanic IMO really, some people just think everyone is pointing and laughing at them all the time irl too.. but i do say gg after the game no matter how many t bags went down.
---
I do the same with bubbas box, I’ll carry you out if you touch it, but once that box is open, everyone in the basement is dead
---
They worded it weirdly, it says you have to down people in plain old feral frenzy when you actually have to be in killer's instinct. Its definitely one of the harder character specific achievements out there though.
---
well, he is
---
It really pisses me off when people who shouldn't be at low rank actively keep themselves at low rank just to bully new players. I have some friends who are fairly inexperienced and while I enjoy playing with them I don't tryhard too hard and abuse certain loops/gimmicks that newer players can't play against. I often play with No Mither (or at least without Self Care) so that I'm not as much of an issue for a more inexperienced Killer.
---
yes it was
---
This is so low-brow I'm surprised someone didn't do it sooner.
---
Well played ladies and gents; well played.
---
Ah yes, my experience on both sides after not playing for a while, and rank resetting down to 20. The kills are a constant 4k slaughter, these people can't run away worth a damn, and nobody is on freaking gens. 
---
ok?
---
No...
---
Mither
---
Thanks, we got a fantastic meme to start the year off! 
---
here's a very simple solution: instead of being a cunt, keep scrolling

---
i see you're a man of culture
---
I'm not ashamed to admit I do this a lot
---
use kindred at low ranks (20-8)
---
Depends on the manner of DC. Leaving game = 5k survival, pulling the plug/force DC gives nothing.
---
Not only that, if you force DC the survivors by cutting off your internet for ~20 seconds and reconnecting quick enough, you even keep your bloodpoints as if the Survivors had disconnected.
---
Their Internet just sucks, that's all. 
---
Actually, no. Not in my experience. So I respectfully disagree.
---
They forgot the greatest combo of all, overcharge on freddy.
---
Adding to the ardetha thing. He has a series called Dark academy where he goes way more in depth of how to Play, he reviews gameplay and talks about it more. It can be found on YouTube. 
---
Murdered a teammate.
---
Hid in the basement and ran up while killer was checking a locker. Crouched nearby.
---
Dwight vaults in through a window and starts walking towards the basement.
---
I'm teabagging furiously.
---
At the top of the stairs the killer comes up, downs him, and carries him to a basement hook.
---
Well the thing with tombstone is that it's incredibly hard to use correctly and survivors can realize he has it, and then counter it. The same with the Trapper's Bloody Coil, it's dangerous but there's counterplay. Having an add-on that just straight up puts a survivor into the injured state is just mean. The Malware booster is cool because it also reveals the killer so the survivor is given the oppurtunity to take action. Idk how exactly to fix it but don't remove player agency is my #1 tip
---
If you level through the bloodweb you get random Perks on the lowesr rank you dont own.  For example if you have bbq 1 you can only get bbq 2 and Not bbq 3 in the next bloodweb.
---
He's annoying but nothing i can't deal with, only killer i hate going against is Legion.
---
Unless you're brain dead you can't seriously believe that voice comms is cheating... Am I arguing with a 7yr old?

Please appoint to me WHICH point using voice software would be... if it exists I will (even though I must have played 2/3 games on comms since I main killer) report myself to bhvr so I can get banned for using voice communication software...
---
And you know they're asian how?
---
I used an internet
---
Hoping you got Balanced Landing, looks like a hella long fall.
---
Nah dude you want Kindred for that. Decisive just puts you at more risk of getting buttfucked by the killer.
---
Can't repair?
---
I main nea and p3 Dwight 
---
On nea rn I use the new mean streets skin, but I will eventually start mixing it up with grim matsuri and the 80s suitcase stuff.
---
On Dwight I usually just wear full p3 lol
---
than your experience is like this Post, shit
---
And when you end on a good game.. “that was a good one, maybe just another one!”
---
Oh definitely not, it goes from good to trash.
---
This
---
[throws pallet down]
---
[pallets falls flat on the floor]
---
[Killer laughs while I sprint away]
---
I dont hate very many perks or addons but I hate Myers players who run insta death and unlimited tier 3. It doesnt make for a fun game at all. It turns into your team just hiding and not doing anything ultimately dragging the game out forever.
---
Get friends.  That will be my strategy.
---
10/10 greatest combo
---
A few days ago some dude held me hostage in a game for 15 minutes, after the 3 other survivors escaped. 
---
I can handle flames, and death threats, but prolonging games is so fucking annoying. It feels like, every 2nd game I have to run to each gate to watch them perform their expressionist dance before they leave.
---
Are you queuing as a solo survivor? I think that's my problem. As a killer, I get matched up against SWF. When I queue as a survivor, I'm solo, so I probably get matched up with other solo players. 
---
It means you, as the killer, ensure throughout the match that three gens in close proximity don’t get completed. You’ll chase and hook someone and then return to that area. Since there’s seven gens total on the map, there’s three left at the end. You’ll allow gens in other areas to be completed. So at the end you only have to patrol a small area. It makes it extremely hard on the survivors and you can essentially hold the game hostage. I play survivor 99% of the time and I’m okay with the strategy to a certain point. It’s smart to neglect the gen in BFE when there’s three close by and only four left. It’s smart to patrol those gens when at the end. What I think is stupid and over the line is not even chasing after survivors when you find them while three gen patrolling. Just hit them once then continue to patrol. If you chase people off and try to hook them then I’m okay with it personally.
---
While it is true, I would assume whoever OP is talking about tries to purposly avoid the diehard killer mains who will punch them in the mouth ingame for trying toxic trolling. Thus those diehard mains who auto rank towards rank 1 can be avoided by deranking.

You could have all perks on her
---
Me IRL:
---
*running away from a serial killer*
---
*throws pallet down*
---
*starts t-bagging*
---
The killer:
---
*tackles me down and slashes my throath with a severely confused face*
---
I think I do but do teachables not count? Or do I have to prestige?
---
Teachables count but the only circumstance in which no perks comes up is when you have all perks unlocked to lvl 3 on that character 
---
Nope. As soon as I see sparks on the ground I never fail to roll my eyes 
---
Wouldn't this lead to the killers knowing which map they are playing on before the game? 
---
There’s unbreakable for a reason
---
That makes sense 
---
BBQ and Chili is a wonderful perk for that :D
---
n word pass obtained
---
*Pulls out a random flashlight tries to flash him in the eyes*
---
It's happened to me when playing against Hillbilly.
---
That would be cool but pretty shitty for the killer. Maybe have a rare offering that let's the killer spawn beside it or survivors as far away as possible.
---
Yeah you pretty much have it right, but the Entity doesn't eat just hope, it eats all kinds of emotions, from the survivors and the killer as well.
---
Why :( I love the hair &gt;&lt;
---
Oh sick, I don’t really play Billy so I wouldn’t really no other than what I have experienced. To be honest I mainly know about it from memes.
---
but what about pallet stuns?
---
You get achievements and bonus bloodpoints via 4Ks
---
Yeah me too
---
CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE !
---
I'm not blaming him, if I did blame him I'd be saying that people are taunting him because of something he did, which is not what I said. What I said is that being taunted and/or taunting is part and parcel of playing a multiplayer competitive game, and therefore, it should be expected.
---
I did it. Lol. 
---
I cri errytime
---
What is even going on with the camera perspective here?
---
Honestly not many people cheat in dbd besides lag switching, when I first met the people I play with now they asked me how I was finding them every time and it was just they all played stealthy which means if you go near a gen and it’s started go look around trees and walls to be sure most of the time it works out well
---
Yes, you also didnt say bigfoot was a survivor xD
---
It is how the entity works, also wasnt trying to start an argument, i just wanted to know more lore about your fan man chapter is all. But never mind. 
---
Billy can get around the map faster than any other killer except the nurse. Because of that, seeing someone on the other side of the map for 4 seconds gives you enough time to rev the chainsaw and sprint towards them, often catching sight of them before the aura has even worn off. With most other killers, you get the aura and need to start running towards a survivor, and predict where they will be because there is a longer delay before you can get to them.
---
Thanks for the information. Thought that I have missed something in a dev Stream. 
---
Yeah it is sad that they messed up the opertunity to create something unique with the legion theme. Especially when they could have given hin another theme and released the same cosmetics without the nametags behind them. 
---
Too late now. Have a nice day. 
---
Git gud 
---
Stop camping pallets you noob!
---
With clown I use BBQ. Nurses. Bitter murmer and NOED.
---
Little bit over the top but so much fun and the salt is lovely.
---
Right, I think people are forgetting they make money off this...the #1 priority is providing entertaining content to subscribers. Common sense.
---
I love Jen and I do understand not wanting to play at Red ranks all the time as a streamer because they aren't fun games to play. But yes, she is incredibly toxic and pretends like she isn't. I used to watch her all the time but just kind of stopped because she was either stomping killers with her full comms SWF (and then tries to say she doesn't do it when they are coordinating dull totems cleansed and who is being chased when/where) or the games shes in are meme games because she knows and is friends with 90% of the killers at the ranks she stays at.
---
Again, I don't think it would be any better if she stayed at high rank 24/7 because a lot of good killers Derank for faster queues and rank is not an indication of skill in this game, but time spent. But she is toxic and pretends like she isn't. It's not even the SWF that is toxic, she'll sit at the exit gate for ages waiting for the killer to hit her with the pretense of "lol I'm giving them more points" which is the most annoying games as a killer.
---
But in her defense, I don't think she joins and leaves, I've seen her stay in plenty of games she wanted to DC from because she felt bad so I think she stays in games until they are about to end and DCs then. I obviously don't know since she does it off screen.
---
Hopefully won't do a slow vault or your screwed
---
I've never watched any of her stream, the first time I really heard from her was when she tweeted about survivor being too easy because of how the maps are made and that she was dropping the palets early to give chances to killers.
---
But since then, I only really heard about her on Reddit, people saying she's really toxic only playing in SWF. That's pretty sad, but being toxic to get views is nothing new I guess, people somehow like that.
---
Prestiges doesnt make you find better perks only better addons (If you had taken some time to read the prestige description you would know it instead of doing this shit on reddit) 
---
Thank you for doing the meme correctly.
---
Okay, explain to me what the line is for third party programs that alter the game experience is then. Even if we both agree that the advantage given by voice comms isn't an insurmountable advantage, it definitely does give you a competitive advantage from using a third party program in game. So how much of an advantage are you allowed to give yourself using programs outside of the game before it becomes cheating? If voice comms are okay, are HUD mods okay? How about a numerical cooldown timer for your perks? Would a perk analyzer that blinks on the screen when a survivor uses a perk so you can track it easier be okay? How far are you allowed to use third party software add features that are not in the game before it becomes cheating?
---
Cause of just how absolute dogshit the spawn locations are. Almost always fucking spawn right beside a gen or out in the open. Like a simple hotfix would be a godsend. I don’t think haunted grounds would even be used nearly as much as it is now if the hex spawning was better. 
---
Wouldnt Quentin be the weed one?
---
Unpopular opinion : Slugging is a valid killer tactic
---
You get it. It’s all about entertainment which in turn makes money. Jendenises streams are fun to watch, and you correct in that many times stuff they do like divebombing for saves end up making the killer a bunch of extra points! 
---
what about 666?
---
Voice comms is what makes it fun to play with friends...how awful that people socially interact and enjoy a video game, we can't have that at the expense of salty killers claiming it ruins their experience!
---
More than 50% of the time you load into a lobby with a SWF group of 4 people the pussy killer backs out of the game anyway, God forbid you have to face a challenge!!
---
Quentin is a good christian boy he would never touch the devil’s lettuce I’m shakinjg and crying rihgtn now
---
Omagerd you're right, im so sorry.
---
nice
---
More than you think. If anything it was not being stealthy, it was straight out predicting because, as I said, she wasnt looking for us, she didn't look around, she went in a straight line to a specific point.
---
And this is a "build" that people use when they get in the same lobby as a killer and survivor. You as a survivor use perks that increase chances of being the Obsession, almost guaranteeing it and the Killer uses anything and Dying Light. As soon as the match starts survivor and Killer look for each other, the Killer downs the survivor, the survivors kills himself in the hook and now is a 3 surv 5 gen game with 25% speed penalty for survivors. Additionaly, the survivor can spectate and tell the Killer where every other survivor is. 
---
I know this is a thing, but it had never happened to me.
---
Just chase them out the exit gate, you will usually get a hit and some extra BP! Sometimes you will even down them and they womt be able to escape cause you hooked them. Either way, you either end the game or get the kill. 
---
That is just kind of dbd for you, dont let it discourage you, just keep practicing.
---
Git gud
---
No that's just the red lights perk that Claudette uses in case she ever needs to move across the map.
---
Pink perks?
---
How old is this? 
---
I'm a face camper, goodbye cruel world.
---
selfie meyers :)
---
I’ve actually never heard of people doing that but it wouldn’t surprise me, I think in this case it was just unlucky since he doesn’t have any obsession perks but again you can never really know if someone’s cheating unless it’s super obvious like speed hacks or lag switches
---
Cutie

It makes them feel better that they don't get to rank 1. Untill recentely I've never made it to rank one as killer(because I didn't play enough games to ever get there) and when I grinded my way to rank one the last few weeks I started to notice that the games became harder and harder.
---
Where I would 3 gen 4k every game from rank 10 to rank 6 and 1 gen 4k at rank 5 it became hard once I got at rank 3. Thats where it became harder to do better because the survivors actually knew what they were doing and not just run aimlessly once I found them.
---
It's the same for survivor, the killers at rank 1 are much better than the killers at rank 10. When the rank reset happens I usually don't play for a few days so the sweaty people get back to higher ranks and I can have some fun against killers that are a bit worse. After that I just make my way back again without any problem.

Just throw out my opinion, voice comms don't exist in the game, using an out of game program to give you the ability to do something you can't in game seems like it is cheating just as much as giving yourself permanent aura reading or speed hacks. I grant that it isn't as egregious or impactful, but both seem to me to be giving you in game abilities that you don't have when playing the game within the rules and boundaries set by the game.
---
That's hilarious 
---
Outplayed.
---
That smile will haunt me.
---
OMG SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WE ARE GETTING UNMASKED COSMETICS FOR LEGION THIS WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE
---
Aren't you so cool? Here, have a cookie.
---
I feel bad for that Bill, but that was an awesome blink.
---
Did this once
---
Survivor in end game chat - "That is bullshit, fuck you, I was all the way in the hatch"
---
When the etiquette "shitpost" is 100% accurate
---
Happy cakeday
---
Kindred exists to shame myteammates  doing nothing while I’m being hooked. 
---
&gt;Go bother someone else.
---
Honestly what isn’t. I hate it when people hide bullshit behind “Its a vaLid tACTic”.
---
Oh, good shit XD.
---
Not at all, i'm saying that if you dye your hair crazy colors like neon pink or blue then that's literally asking for attention. It's one thing to style your hair in a way you like it, it's another to literally make is as attention grabbing as possible and then saying you never did it for attention.
---
Welcome to DBD! 
---
I shouldn’t have to waste a perk slot for something like that.
---
I personally think they should implement a push to talk feature 
---
Keep in mind not everyone at the moment is DCing for deranking. 
---
Since the last update people just can't get into the game after it starts loading.
---
Every 5/6 games either my game freezes for no reason once it gets to the loading screen or it just doesn't load at all even though the game still works.
---
I agree. The fact there are perks to counter it, even if they aren't popular in the meta, and that it comes with the inherent gamble that people may just pick up the people you have slugged, or you might lose the bodies when they crawl away gives pros and cons to the killer for slugging. It isn't an unfair tactic, just kind of rough for the people left on the ground for a long time.

Noice 
---
https://youtu.be/pshlJLOeX7k best one ive seen 
---
Oh shit I didn't even look at my own picture, you're right. It was a weird game.
---
I don't think it would be a horrible idea, provided they did it right. Just adding the feature to the game as it currently is feels like it would just be a straight up buff to survivors. But I was more asking if it constituted cheating in the game in it's current build.
---
I shouldn’t have to waste a perk on something that may or may not happen when I should be able to so it regardless ONCE.
---
My friends were laughing so hard 
---
Wow. I would just leave lol.
---
The PC I used to play DbD on is now fried. I don't know if I had Steam Sync on, but I'm getting a new PC, I heard that this game has offline saves so do I have to retreive my old hard disk to keep my progress?
---
Nut.
---
Thanks boi
---
He's not a bad killer IMO.  Why do you think he's bad?
---
Thank you thank you
---
Agreed. I'm not really a great killer, I just have good moments. So I usually average between 5-8. But I also have really poor vision and it's been getting worse lately so my reflexes aren't nearly as good as they used to be. 
---
There's a video of a lead dev playing against popular YouTubers that play DBD,  and those survivors kicked that devs ass and not only embarrassed him but pissed him off too. You could literally see the salt in his eyes. It's just sad. That would be like the Overwatch devs all being in bronze rank. 
---
Yaaaa its a rough life but someone’s got to do it
---
Legion's power is a joke, without Frank's it's just weak as hell. And even then, the fact that basic attacks reset your power... Come on. They made Legion weak on purpose, so survivors won't cry, it's a common thing in DBD. If Legion's power were any better, there would be massive outcry that he's OP. Now survivors can easily mock him and play like there is no killer in game, unless he somehow gets Thanatophobia to full stacks and nobody destroys Ruin/NOED.
---
The truth hurts.
---
hello i am an entitled survivor main who died so now i'm doing a bigmad and turning rng into a conspiracy 
---
Oh yeah it’s ok for killer to talk about things they think should be change but it’s a big fucking problem if a survivor says ANYTHING about ANYTHING they feel should be changed. Get the fuck out of here. People like you is the reason this community is toxic.
---
This reminds me of instagram comedy and I hate it
---
Always happens to me.
---
Unpopular-ererer opinion: Unbreakable needs a buff.
---
Geez. I can't understand this. This is game about fixing generators in order to win. I always play with friend, so we have at least 2 people that fix those damn things. But I really wonder how random matches look like where entire 4 survivors wander aimlessly trying to find someone to heal, or dull totem to get rid of. 
---
Dislike all killers who run NOED but that's up to the survivors to do the totems.
---
I wish he never had his shock treatment haha 
---
TBH, I prefer immersed survivor games. They're more fun. If I notice they're immersed while playing killer, I always play along and pick them off slowly. Usually I'll give the hatch to the last one as well. The game feels so much more fun that way.
---
lol true 
---
All he needs now is an addidas tracksuit and semechki.
---
I just don't like playing against the Doc in general.
---
But it IS a valid tactic.
---
Just because it's annoying/boring to face doesn't make it ineffective unfortunately. :(
---
i dont even argue with survivors post-game. When playing killer there is a 80% chance someone will flame you, no matter how fair you play so i usually just make fun of them with stuff like "these salty tears are delicious" or "git gud". I know it drives them nuts and im not even mad at the flames anymore, its part of the game and a lot of people cant handle to die in this game.
---
I assume you are talking about Jendenise. I have played against her several times and she was never toxic in post game chat or in game. 
---
This is coming from someone who knows who she is but doesn’t watch her stream at all. I find survivor play to be incredibly boring to watch (especially swf). 
---
Nah man just no tolerance for unnecessary drama, thanks for asking though :)
---
It’s because you unlocked all of them
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
Good for a laugh, sorry you got cheated outta that grab tho
---
Just break the damn things and move on. Most survivors use about 3-5 if you let them then they have almost nothing to use against you.
---
Oh, so it is cheating if it extracts information the developer did not intend you to have? So like for instance extracting the location of teammates and killer even if you don't have the perk equipped that the developers intended you to require in order to have access to that information? That certainly sounds like allowing information you are not intended to have access to through the use of third party programs.
---
As for BHVR's stance. They have said before in their FAQ that voice comms are not an intended mechanic in the game. I would say that they don't intend to ban people or make it explicitly forbidden simply because it is a prevalent enough concept in team games that even if it, in BHVR's words "ruins the survivor experience", it would reduce the player numbers by too large a degree and be ultimately a poor business decision regardless of the balance question.
---
Doctor is shit in general. But distressing, ruin, unnerving and overcharge is shit to play against. Also, double calm or iridescent/electrodes. Noed could be there as well; but it rarely ever ends with the end game anyway. 
---
One more gen? Lol 
---
Thnx bb
---
I'm new to the ranking system is level 13 survival a good thing 
---
Okay I am confused. You are saying BBQ and Chilli on Billy is not as good as it is on other killers. But now it is apparently really good on Billy, which I said in the beginning. Please explain to me.
---
They already made a killer weak on purpose - Freddy.   
---
All killers are nerfed. Nurse - bugged ability and weak base stats, Bingbong - got a buff that changed nothing, really, Legion - explained before, Trapper - he even got perks directed to beat him, Hag - despite her getting some buff, her abilities are still easy to counter... And so on, and so on.  
---
Meanwhile, survivors getting nerfed "a ton" were necessary changes to give this game any fun on the killer side, other than being looped for infinity (which still happens today considering how handholding this game is for survivors). And in some cases nerfs were reverted anyway (I've noticed how instablinds are back now). And killers have all the right to complain, as BHVR is 99% focused on giving survivors fun at the cost of killer's fun. It's just one-sided bullshittery.
---
You spelt Legion wrong
---
Been playing since it was the free game on PS4. Heres my take so far:
---
Since Hex: Ruin was offered in the Shrine of Secrets, almost every killer now has it.  Almost every match expect Ruin to be active now. I try to make builds that can easily track totems, especially Detectives Hunch.
---
If you are playing with randoms as a survivor, you are going to have a rough time, a lot of players are waiting to farm you off the hook or hide and not do gens at all.  
---
And recently it seems every killer facecamps. Do yourself a favor and put Borrowed Time on your survivors, so the victim has a fighting chance to escape. DO NOT rush to hook save right in front of the killer unless you have Borrowed on, youre only feeding the entity if they get grabbed again.
---
And yeah, when Im the killer, it definitely seems like im always against a SFW Seal Team 6 Expendables crew with flashlight stuns and 360 jukes for days. Punish the bolder players and if a chase lasts too long, abandon it and pick off the weaker players first.
---
Yeah and unfortunately people can’t talk about anything from a survivor perspective without getting shit on by killer mains, but a killer says they don’t like ANYTHING it’s perfectly ok.
---
It is not hard to find a game as a survivor in red ranks at all.
---
I am playing from soviet Russia and have never had an issue with that. Yes, sometimes I need to change lobbies due to ping, but overall it is still pretty easy.  They do it because they want to abuse lower-rank players, which is a douche thing to do, but they do so not only because they are toxic, but mostly because their viewerbase endorses it.
---
Behavior need to make it harder to get ranks in order to give them something to lose, implement a working report system and smite people for sandbagging in streaks of games(judging by stats) I don’t think they are competent enough to implement a working model of any of those systems though.
---
Yea, its funny when you get salty messages from a SWF all using DS and Adrenaline, 2 with purple flashlight, 2 with Insta-heals and they call you a "NOED Noob". I told them "Noobs finish gens as fast as they can and fail to cleanse totems"
---
Survivors are not getting nerfed holy fucking shit
---
* you guys are harder to see in foliage now
---
* you guys are harder to hear now
---
* you guys can easily completely hide from BBQ &amp; chili
---
* at the very least, Alert and Diversion were buffed
---
* NOED having tier 1 and 2 being changed so that they're not useless is not a buff. If NOED wa changed so that it also showed auras for 5 seconds, that would be a buff. survivor mains have no fucking idea what words mean
---
I agree with parts of this. Speaking as a rank 1 killer, rank 1 survivors do gens incredibly fast. I will say that some of the best survivors I have ever played were rank 15 though. 
---
4 x mori is more op I think
---
reported for reporting :P
---
If it is such a trash tactic then it sounds like it doesn't need the nerf. Slugging is most commonly used though when you are down to 2 survivors left, you down one and then go hunting for the other. There is a reason it is used this way, it is a killer's best counter to the hatch that arrives as a consequence of being at a disadvantage if a hatch standoff arrives. If the person you knocked down could always get back up, that adds another 2 people you need to knock down to make this viable since by the time you have caught the 4th person, guy 3 will be back up, and once you catch guy 3 again, guy 4 will be back up again. Your suggestion is simply a big nerf to slugging as a concept, which I appreciate is your intention, but maybe just be upfront that you don't like slugging as a strategy and would want to see it go away rather than trying to pretend that it is just a quality of life change.
---
Dude you have no idea what extracting is... they can't (and I mean legally I'm pretty sure they can't) ban for voice comms, since it has nothing in their ToS nor has any precedent for it... you're just a kid trying to hold on to their argument which makes absolutely no sense. I already explained to you why voice comms has nothing to do with cheating, I can only hope you'll stop behaving like a 7yr old, even if you're one.
---
Hahaha yeah. Or when they use dark sense and say your a noob for using bitter murmer haha.
---
If survivors do there job then it's harder on killers but they don't ever think like that 
---
*Tries to stab them in the shoulder with a shard of gl-* oh wait, that actually works... :s
---
“Wait, Claudette, please come back! I just wanted to talk!”
---
I love playing Bubba's Box.
---
If you get a fun SWF you're in for some silly shenanigans.
---
And act like an illusion, lol
---
What about a Ben Tramer mask?
---
bad for bbq stacks though :(
---
Technically it is not cheating as you have broken no rules of the game to do it. But it breaks the game so much you may as well be cheating. The really problem is that coordination becomes too powerful to deal with everyone knows which pallets are gone, where trap characters have placed their traps, who is getting chased so gens pop super fast.
---
Dont forget the part where they also say "besides dying" right afterwards.
---
Love it 😂
---
People unironically use fire up?
---
Ah yes, the wall backflip into dragonkick to the face. Good choice sir!
---
Saamee. So much same.
---
I care because I am playing the role of the killer, my goal in the game is to kill the greatest number of people I can. I don't owe you an escape, you earn that escape if you can pull it off, but I am not going to give you a freebie. Points don't even come into it, this is jsut a matter of fulfilling your role in the game, which is to achieve the greatest number of kills as possible. Slugging is a tactic which, with the gamble that someone may help pick up the person I have dropped, or the person I dropped possibly having unbreakable and countering my strategy gives me a greater chance at killing both than if I kill one and then hope to find the last survivor before I find the hatch. Either way, the "just let them escape, you got three kills" argument is needlessly entitled.
---
Michael's cock POV
---
I hate the doctor.  Randomly screaming, visual cues giving away your position.  Not being able to interact with anything until snapping out of it.  The wonky skill checks.
---
LAG!  The lag is unbearable and makes all of his annoying perks that much worse.
---
Gotem.
---
I typically use small game, premonition, plundering, and light weight. I am objectified to the max. If I had technician I would use that instead of plunder.
---
Yeah, I appreciate that. It isn't like I don't get why people voice chat. Even if you aren't in a competitive group who is consciously choosing to voice chat for the gameplay advantage it brings, a lot of people just like to play with your friends, and it is more fun to talk to them while you play. You would need to be intentionally obtuse not to see that this is the reaosn the vast majority of people using voice comms are using them. But it still just kind of rubs me the wrong way. I'd probably feel different if it was a feature in game. Still would think it was an unbalancing feature, but not a cheat if you could do it with in game mechanics.
---
A mix of distressing, unnerving presence, ruin, overcharge, and noed. Super annoying
---
I popped into her stream one day, she started a game, disconnected against a Myers because she didn't like how he was playing (well)
---
ENTITY WHAT THE HELL
---
This is why I wanted to have a thread like this. I am curious why it is or isn't considered cheating and what makes getting information like this from your teammates different from using a HUD Mod which would give you the same information.
---
Remove SWF from ranked play.  Problem solved.
---
Shut the fuck up you baby. You're whining about something that's totally fine, not an actual problem
---
that's the difference, idiot
---
And you.
---
&gt; oppressed. 
---
Oh my fucking god get the fuck over yourself
---
lmfao
---
Actually im fighting the argument that the average person would go insane just at the realization they have  been commiting murder but what would i know im just a chikd who plays video games with no experience of the outside world or any trauma at all 
---
Or four decisive strike claudettes with adrenaline 
---
Anyone who has played killer a lot knows the game is not at all balanced around killer. Ask any of the high level influencers and they will all tell you that at the highest level of the game, survivors are (as a team) more powerful than any killer except the nurse. Also, I think you are in a minority to say that you only want 3 kills. I personally consider 3 kills to be a game I 'win' even if it is an arbitrary point to label it. But it is not an unreasonable thing to want to go for the 4th kill.
---
You said yourself earlier that slugging is a tactic of a trash killer, if it is a tactic only poor killers would use, then you must be aware that there are multiple viable tactics to counter slugging killers. Adding your suggestion of one free pick yourself up for every character would make the unbreakable perk even less more niche than it already is for one, but second, would eliminate slugging as an option because of what I explained earlier. It doubles the amount of work you need to do in order to actually achieve a slug. It would also encourage people who want to slug to just camp a body on the ground rather than running off to hunt because they know anyone can get back up on their own if they want to. 
---
No people hate him because he's annoying and boring to play against,it has nothing to do with tiers 
---
Also I have notice a strange rise in killer main domination. You're idea wasn't as bad as others say at least in my opinion. Honestly I would love to see it be implemented in the game in some way.
---
You could try using an ethernet cable.
---
Can you get the fuck out of here? You can’t say survivors aren’t when killers are complaining and they don’t get shit but if a survivor says the don’t like anything it’s “git gud, entitled survivor”. Just shut the fuck up already.
---
Or you're getting paired with an overly altruistic 3-man SWF that drop what they're doing as soon as someone as injured to rush in for a save. It amazes me how people never seem to realize that chase time, carry time and even first hook time is time the killer isn't bothering you on your gen.
---
Omg Myers you look very cute, don't let anyone tell you otherwise &lt;3 Let's catch up sometime gurl. 
---
That killer is literally a pain to play against because he's so boring. And chases have no fun in them because you can't do anything against a legion with half a brain. They can just cheese the chase and you have literally nothing to do.
---
I gave up one day when I went 3 matches in a row versus a killer/survivor team, where the killer would never hit them, but everyone else got facecamped &amp; then farmed by the survivor.  The survivor in question would always run OoO &amp; Bond, and the killer always had a Mori, but it was never the same two accounts.
---
... but then I was back the next day, because I have no self control.
---
Rather than that, I would rather the soft ban system most games like this use. If people DC X number of times within the space of Y time period then they get given a status that only allows them to play with other people who have the same disconnector status.
---
Can’t double the amount of work if you just....hm....let me think.....DUDE. HOLY SHIT. I CAME UP WITH AN AMAZING IDEA. JUST FUCKING HOOK THEM YOU GREEDY FUCK.
---
Ya lol I was happy to see a survivor man to get the frustration of being a bullied killer. Guess she went back to her dark side :/
---
More like: *acts all smug because they are healthy, gets stabbed once, falls to the ground dying why yelling: Nerf NOED!*  
---
It's not even a huge problem and there's a lot of ways to play around a camper. 
---
Let people play how they want to play tbh.
---
Well when you're playing hag and all your perks are hexes because you know you can trap/camp them, this is bound to happen.  
---
Sidenote: Lawd the number of times I've had to deal with a hag babysitting their hex ruin. 
---
Honestly in games where it's like this I would get 0 kills if I didn't camp. I played a game where it looked bad for me but played it right in the end and got them all on and off the hook by them being greedy until I killed 2 as they were at the gate and trying to save one another
---
Honestly survivors can’t say anything without getting shit as I am right now by some dense asshole.
---
Yes, absolutley. You are gaining an unintended and unfair advantage using out of game mechanics to do so.
---
It's not the single worst thing to be in comms with friends, but it has the potential to be. It has the potential to give survivors, functionaly free perks (survivor aura perks) and to nullify many killer advantages and perks (broadcasting hex locations, and nullifying blindness effects and aura nuliifiers.) 
---
I have a rule in my chat, that killer location, perks (after death) or hex spawns are not to be communicated. The survivors already have enough advantages without needing more.
---
You should really be flossing
---
What time zone are you in?
---
Le maymays
---
Im thinking that if push to talk was implemented the kill could hear it in proximity so it negates cheating i think swf isn’t cheating in my opinion because ur going to be playing with ur friends why not be able to chat with them in skype or discord, u can do it on other games and also sometimes maybe one or more of ur buddies isn’t playing dead by daylight happens all the time to me where im the only one playing but i wanna chat with my other buddies (granted im on console so I already have a disadvantage but still)
---
Yeah, but why hook them when you could let them win. I mean, obviously it is greedy to hook all 4 right? why even hook the third person, you could let two of them go? In fact, killing 2 is greedy, it is stealing points from those two poor survivor players. I guess killers shouldn't kill anyone. Wouldn't want to be greedy.
---
Calling me names won't change a thing, shitface. Nurse is still bugged, Wraith is still trash, you can't even counter my Trapper argument, and Hag is so high tier that barely anyone plays her. Instablinds seem to be either back or flashlights are bugged, but you would have to play killer once in your life to know that. It is in the best state - for survi mains like you. Try bending reality more to fit it to your "survi nerfed!!!!!!1111" propaganda. This subreddit loves it.
---
I agree, the Doctor is a bloodpoint machine
---
Or just get Gud?
---
What program are you using anyway?
---
Hey, if they want to use Fire Up, I say let 'em. I prefer killers I go against take it over something actually useful.
---
Hmmm, maybe I should try that out. Thanks for the tip! 
---
You had no right to say the last phrase. It’s just very wrong.
---
So you are a toxic ASSHOLE that says to others that they should kill themself and you are the victim her because of the comments? Are you mentally crippled? 
---
That’s my ideal build, but you really need Ruin. You could swap out Crapper-Up for It. 
---
Negative, you 
---
Yeah, so the best case scenario for Legion is - if survivors aren't totally braindead - one kill. Before you get someone with him, considering all the loops survivors can do anyway, you can easily get all gens. So Legion is bad and needs buffs. Which won't happen.  
---
Am I the one crying? Are you new here? Or to the game? Or you just close your eyes every time your side starts to spam how unfair this game is for them, becuase they can't do 4 escapes every time?
---
It sounds like you are bragging about it imo.Just say gg and move on
---
I know. But you can be sure,when servers arrive that the DCing people are assholes that want to derank or just ragequit. My game crashes sometimes too and I also got some hate on my steam profile for "quitting" the game despite me not even losing a pip because of the error message i got from DbD. 
---
Competetive level 😐
---
seriously...git gud
---
Use Borrow time, or just focus on Gens while the Killer wastes his time.
---
on the other hand, if a survivor acts cocky and t-bags me, I make sure he dies asap
---
What
---
Lol
---
This image is cursed
---
This... actually sounds really fun... ima try this lol
---
I've consumed a lot of hours of her stream, and every time she and the other streamers in her swf play at rank 1 the community moris, tunnels etc. If you are a streamer, your viewers do not want to see this. Even when she is solo qing at rank 1, every game it's a mori and tunnel. If she doesn't want to play against that because it's literally her job to promote the game and make money off it then why should she? 
---
Mountain time, I live in Colorado
---
Surprisingly didn’t see many doctors this time, mainly Freddy’s and legions
---
Yea that's true I guess
---
Oh yeah for sure it can just be like that sometimes and it sucks but that's just the risk you face when going solo, not even DS is going to save you from that level of BS.
---
Explain, i want to farm I’m playing as doctor i got like one sacrifice (I’m not a good killer) and only got 18k points 
---
I just switched from console to PC and last night I had a group where two of the survivors DCed in the first few minutes after I downed one of them, so I decided I would let the other two go. I don't think they got the memo that I wasn't going to kill them so it took over 30 minutes for them to do the gens while I just sat there and threw my tonic bottles, bored as hell. I'm going to blame it on being at a low rank currently but I was about to pull my hair out waiting on them. 
---
The best part is that in the after game chat they were mad at me for not chasing them lol
---
Anytime ma dood.
---
i always see this view of him !!
---
I feel like stuff like this only happens to Bills lol nice play
---
She has the face of a gravedigger.  
---
Damn a respectful conversation on the Internet. How rare to see yet alone being involved in one. Damn the comments are so toxic.  😂
---
This is wrong by the way, they changed auras to orange so any experienced killer can differentiate 
---
Yes. Very iredecent indeed. 
---
Umm
---
I think you forgot something 
---
I didn’t say I was trying to be the good guy. Of course I tried talking to him, and he just left and put a comment on my profile. If I wanted to brag I’d be way more morbid about it
---
Aww cmon, he went through all that trouble of doing a gen, and someone DCd. You could have at least thrown him the hatch. 
---
Doc is a delay killer, plus he has a strong passive ability, by using those in conjunction you can make the game last as long as you want it to
---
The two biggest requirements are Distressing and Chili
---
Distressing gives extra deviousness (docs best category) and makes your Treatment Mode insanity radius enormous (because its reliant on your terror radius)
---
Chili is a big requirement because it doubles your bloodpoint gain, self explanatory
---
A lot of people don't want to play leatherface to unlock chili, but I think its a gamechanging perk and I got the teachable in a day, its really the best
---
The other two perks are up to you, I choose TOTH and Ruin because I care more about long games than I do winning said games, again this is a farming build
---
The playstyle is simple, walk around in treatment mode (to raise survivor insanity), shock the hell out of them (to farm deviousness points and further raise insanity), and hook everyone once, minimum, that means no camping (until you have all 4 chili stacks)
---
When all survivors have hit maximum insanity(signified by randomly holding their head and screaming), then shocking them twice and hitting them once makes them useless for a little over half a minute, assuming they're going to heal
---
1. I will believe in buffs once I see them. They may just be meaningless changes as in Wraith's case.
---
2. I was speaking about your side spamming. I suggest you learn to read.
---
3. I am good enough to earn a high rank. I, however, rather see the game good for both sides, instead of it handholding survivors and fucking up killers.
---
4. You, so far, can't prove that anything I say is untrue. Is Legion trash? Yes. Is it since the beginning? Yes. Is it made so survivors are pleased? Yes. And so on...
---
I love playing with either Tuft Of Hair or Tombstone Piece. So satisfying seeing survivors panic when you have unlimited EW3 
---
not op, but maybe you?
---
Dude, campers are not that hard to beat. Hooked survivors have 2 minutes before they die, and generators take 1 minute and 20 seconds. Assuming your team has already made gen progress before the first person goes down and gets hooked/camped then your team should be able to finish all 5 gens before they die, especially if toolboxes are involved. Then when you go for the save you just bodyblock the hell out of the killer and run to the exit gate. Bubba is tricky but not impossible to trick out and jupe. The more killers fail to do well with camping (because it's a shit strategy) the less it'll happen. You want to fix the problem? Kick the problems ass, there's your solution.
---
My favorite “counter” is to DC if it looks like the other guy has found the hatch. 
---
Hmmm good point, maybe once the survivor fully recovers their arua is revealed for 3 seconds. That way you see where they are going and it all come down to skill.
---
I'm rank 12 ps4 and I see a camper maybe one every 3 days, maybe slightly more if I get a leatherface. It's usually not a good tactic, but as others in this thread have said, sometimes it's all you have.
---
Inplementing your idea would be harmful to the game. For a start, it would severely hurt leatherface, and would really punish killers after exit gates are powered.
---
Camping is easily countered already with things like borrowed time anyway.
---
Really, compared to more pressing issues the game has like long queue times, no dedicated servers on console, and bugs all over the place, camping is a non-issue.
---
It's usually a bad idea to force your players to play a game a certain way. Implementing this would be straight up bad game design.
---
Wait clarification did he make up that you said to kill himself or did you actually say something like that?
---
Okay, so what happens here is that killers, to stop you from being able to abuse the hatch, will now slug each survivor once, guaranteed, so they don't have the BS free gettup for the hatch.
---
What you have just done, is incentivised killers to slug more than they do, because if they don't waste your free up, then they lose a kill for it. You haven't sped the game up, you just slowed it down. Now you are stuck doing nothing for longer.
---
There is a reason unbreakable is in the game. I know you don't want to spend a perk slot on it. I don't want to spend a perk slot on trying to make the game go at a reasonable pace, or a slot to actualy be able to hear you because the sound is buggy. Or a slot to deal with the fact that opening gates takes no time at all.
---
It just takes so long to get to tier three when using both. If ruin doesn’t hold up very long and the survivors are anywhere better than half decent plus you get a not so good map then you’re more than likely screwed. I’ve been thinking about running this build soon but I just don’t have a good feeling about it lol I just hate being kinda slow most the time 
---
Then get good enough to do that against rank 1 killers. They play the game exclusively, if you can't manage that then you don't deserve a view. Even AngryPug stays at high ranks; I absolutely despise his attitude but at least he plays at his rank without even doing SWF.
---
Streamers like Zubat and Scott are where it's at anyway.
---
They implemented this system. This happens, except I think it's even more harsh, like yoy straight up just can't play if you disconnect frequently
---
Dude I have honestly tried I just decided to block him because he’s hearing but not listening. Look around in the post for him and see for yourself.
---
When you title starts with "I beat a dude so hard", what do you think people are going to make out of it? If someone was attempting to harming themselves, reddit would not be the first place I will be,just saying
---
If he was made for survivors to be pleased, why in the fuck would they make his power concentrate around tunneling, making him literally the most unfun thing in the game especially when there's nothing to do against him in a chase. Also you're the one crying here so it's pretty hypocritical of you to say that "my side is spamming", I mean sure there are dumb survivors who want to spawn inside exits but there sure also are dumb killers like you who wont be satisfied until all four survivors spawn on hooks. PS: It's extremely easy to pip so if you play enough you'll get high rank eventually (the system is shit so you're probably playing against people miles better than you so you think it's a balance problem) if you were good you would actually get kills and realize that the game is not as unbalanced as you think it is.
---
yeah, things are very blurry from medium to ultra, but things on low are much sharper so it's easier to see. also yeah, a lot of shadows and effects are removed so things are brighter
---
lol what I left the game as a joke and this happened
---
# relatable 
---
I think that might actually break it in the other direction honestly. The issue in my eyes with this is that it makes a 4 person slug build basically impossible. Not the biggest loss as 4 person slugs suck to go against. But the bigger issue is that in a 2 person slug game, it just elongates the game without really adding anything. Unbreakable works right now because it is is a surprise. If the killer tries slugging, the player can pull themself up fairly quickly and negate the chase that the killer just did. That in itself is a good counter to slugging. I accept that unbreakable is kind of niche as a perk, but the fact that the ability to pick yourself up isn't useful every game kind of suggests that the ability isn't really needed as a universal ability for any kind of balance reasons to me.
---
I will always hate the corn
---
Tenacity was that buff.
---
I have better BP numbers with Hag
---
Lots of streamers and players do this. A very common given reason is that it’s boring playing against only Billy / Nurse, for 9/10 games. I in no way agree with it, but I think the better solution would be to nerf those top 2 killers, or buff / balance others, giving more killer variety. And I say that as someone who primarily plays killer.
---
They should remove pallets from the game and decisive strike needs to be removed. It's boring and unfun to be stunned by pallets. If the killer is able to hit the survivor they should go down, because chances are the survivor will run away. That or make suicide an option because being stunned just isnt fun. Its annoying to find a survivor and try to end the game only to be stunned. I mean, come on, you've been caught, now die so I can move on to my next game.
---
Accurate 
---
I have a better idea, if a killer spends more than 5 seconds at the hook, he loses 10% movement speed for the entire match, gets teleported to the basement, and his current BP is reset to 0.
---
It's a race to rock bottom! C'mon boys, lets kill this game!
---
this has happened to me pretty much since i started playing. doesn't matter the killer, all the survivor has to do is sit there bc we're powerless. 
---
Oh sure that's why he deleted it. 
---
Alternate universe me is that you?
---
That pallet is shorter than my temper against squadettes.
---
Yeah I main Legion and this have never happened, given I often find the survivor quite quickly after downing / hiking the third guy. 
---
Legion is a better BP farmer now.
---
maybe he deleted it because of all your comments
---
I can't disagree, slugging is frustrating to counter. If you don't have unbreakable, your choice on the ground basically boils down to crawl away and hope you have a team mate find you before the killer does. And hope the killer doesn't down the other person and then not find you because it means you are probably just going to be waiting 2 minute to bleed out. It is why I tend not to crawl away and just find a nearby pallet to wait under. either the killer will find me or the other team will, either way, someone shoudl pick me up and I don't have to wait to bleed out. I'd rather be sacrificed than bleed out after all.
---
I remember literally carrying someone to the hatch. Let them get wiggle out.
---
And afterwards they said "Ez" as if they outplayed me
---
I too hope that there will be implemented some kind of a timer for such situation. It's ridiculous. The hatch should be an ultimate/unique and limited escape. Take it or die.
---
On quick vault Myers it can be scary. I hopped a window against tier 3 Myers and he went right over it and was on me before I had any chance.
---
You will literally never needed iron grasp unless you're doing a basement build, sloppy butcher takes longer for them to heal
---
If you think your teammates are 4Heads who are going to race each other to the hook, maybe you should be the smart one and keep doing gens.
---
If im a rank 17  im playing other rank 17s and If I’m getting quads every game then I am clearly ranking up. Are you seriously trying to say that noed getting it’s tier three effect at tier one is not a buff then you are not very smart, imagine if all survivor perks came with tier three bonuses at tier one, you wouldn’t be happy would you. We could always hide from bbq if we were smart. Alert and diversion are still both shit and hiding in foliage doesn’t work against people with eyes that actually pay attention. (Btw I’m rank 4 so it’s not like I am facing noobs)
---
I've recently bought legion and have been meaning to try him out, what perks do you currently run with him?
---
Is example true? Yes. Was it similar case to what happens now? Yes. Was it a good example then? Yes.  
---
Balancing this game around low ranks is a bad idea and was discussed hundreds of times here before. Really, stop making yourself even more of a clown.  
---
I am making kills, but it is not a pleasant game. Knowing that I, as a killer, can't make a single mistake, because it probably means I've lost, whereas survivors can make mistake after mistake, because of their huge amount of "out of jail" free cards, is frustrating.
---
agreed!
---
Yeah but I don’t freeze that stuff into an ice block my man
---
&gt;Just do the gens. That's it.
---
When your the only Survivor doing Generators while the other 2 watch the Killer camp :(
---
Seriously though this is the counter to camping, if at least 2 Generators don't get completed during the entire time the first Survivor got chased and camped (and they're not suiciding on the hook) then something is terribly wrong with the Survivors and they're just rewarding the Killer for a bad strategy.
---
Everything's fair when Gates are powered though.
---
Or like a feature to derank to 20 or 10 (if you‘re rank 19-10 derank to 20, if you’re rank 9-1 derank to 10) for 500.000 bloodpoints or whatever 
---
Pig with insidious
---
I usually let the last person get the hatch anyway, but killer is under no obligation to do so.  It's not something we should "expect" a killer to do in that situation.
---
I had a game with a Nea and a Tapp where both of there comrades were dead within the first 60 seconds (one Ace looked AFK, but the instant I hooked them they suddenly sprung to life just to kill himself.  The other one, an Ace wearing a different costume, immediately DC-ed after the first Ace died) and I was playing a jumpscare Meyers.  I tried to show Nea that I meant no harm by guidig her to my Hex: Ruin and letting her cleanse it and she got the message almost immediately, but Tapp just kept running and running and running and running.  I would follow along behind him refusing to swing even when I was literally touching him, I stood still under pallets and nudged them with my body so he could get stuns BUT HE JUST KEPT RUNNING, hell Nea went so far as to stand right next to me and teabag just to show that I wasn’t going to kill them **BUT HE JUST KEPT RUNNING**.  Nothing I did could make it clear to him that I wasn’t going to hurt him and I just wanted to farm and have fun in this catastrophe of a game.  Finally, near the very end, I got fed up and I slapped Tapp down.  I  hooked him, then I very deliberately backed off, turned around to face a wall, and allowed Nea to unhook him.
---
And he just kept running.
---
So I knocked him down again, deliberately walked him under a pallet that was massively out of the way, and about halfway there he stopped wiggling.  Nea to stun freed him, and Tapp FINALLY got the memo, dropping his toolbox as a token of appreciation before running to the exit gate and opening it.  He tried to stay in the game to get the hatch, but for whatever reason I felt that Nea deserved it more (for she did 4 gens and farmed with me while he just ran away) so I slapped him down and walked him to the gate.  He seemed to understand this message much more easily, and he left.
---
It was simultaneously the most and least fun I’ve had playing this game, it was like learning to speak an alien language with a savage creature
---
Offline saves are no longer used by the game, so you don't have to retrieve them
---
SWF needs to go.
---
"I stopped reading after that." then "your idea of fixing camping is pretty bad".
---
If you'd stopped reading at my mention of the crutch perk, then you never made it to my suggestion. So either you cannot follow simple logic, or you're a liar. 
---
My idea is bad? Why? Can you elaborate? (really? do you have the ability?)
---
"Why would a killer leave a hook if there are 3 other survivors nearby not doing generators?"
---
Because that's how trolls like to troll. 
---
Jason seems so out of place! Go back to your own game Jason!
---
1. Not using things every game. 
---
2. 1 but also playing just this game constantly.
---
3. The winter event just handed out a ton of items/offerings.
---
It's not similar. HE IS GETTING BUFFED NOT NERFED. When will you get that in your head? You're basically saying you're playing perfect and survivors are doing mistakes all the time. Seriously grow a brain, you're not playing perfect and neither are the survivors. So you're basically whining that you're not getting a 4k every game and at the same time be relaxed and making dozens of mistakes.
---
TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS
---
Why would you want to save your distortion tokens? What else are you trying to use distortion for? Running distortion for BBQ isn't good in the fish place because of all the ways you can counter that. Be close, get in a locker, hide behind the aura of a gen, be really far away. For the rest of the aura reading perks... actually what perks are you trying to avoid? There aren't enough to justify running distortion, it's pretty bad
---
Very kind of you! My last match had 2 dc’s and one dead in the first minute, and I decided to try and farm with the killer. He didn’t want to, apparently, and hooked me instantly. 
---
your reading comprehension skills are appalling. we both sat there for thirty minutes. i found the hatch before her. nice try. fuck off. 
---
"Bubbas box" I assume basement chests?
---
Yeah but no one wants to play their first game of nurse at rank one... that’s a gg ez baby killer before it started
---
Cant blame him, claudettes fucking invisible on most maps. 
---
If I ever dont play killer for a while and end up in the same situation, I tend to just meme around a bit. I know that if I was brand new and my team and I were just constantly getting shit on I'd be less likely to play afterward.
---
Are you sure? It normally didn’t happen unless we had 4 gens done and the killer didn’t have any sacrifices yet. It seems like it would be pretty convenient for the game servers to crash. 
---
Distressing + Calm Addon + Medium/Small Map
---
Then throw in Iron Maiden and you have a terrible time trying to hide.
---
The majority of available offerings give blood point bonuses, plus killers have BBQ for double BP.
---
"I'm rank 12 ps4"
---
I really don't care about your rank. Like... at all.
---
"it would severely hurt leatherface"
---
Well maybe leatherface killers should stop camping so much.
---
"and would really punish killers after exit gates are powered"
---
That's their fault. If you aren't actively getting hooks and kills throughout the game, of course you're going to get screwed at the end. If you camp throughout the game with this new implementation, you'll get double screwed. 
---
"Camping is easily countered already with things like borrowed time anyway."
---
No ability should be a must-pick just because killers want to be jerks.
---
"more pressing issues the game has like long queue times"
---
Seriously? This is a killer issue. Too many killer mains and not enough survivor mains. 
---
"no dedicated servers on console"
---
There's no dedicated servers PERIOD. that's not a console issue, it's an 'everyone' issue. We're getting dedicated servers this summer, so you really can't make that complaint anymore. 
---
"bugs all over the place"
---
The fact that bugs exist doesn't magically negate that trollish gameplay is an issue. 
---
"It's usually a bad idea to force your players to play a game a certain way. Implementing this would be straight up bad game design."
---
Which clarifies to me that you know nothing about game design. Campers can camp with this implementation, but they'll pay for it dearly. That's the point. 
---
NEEF FIRE UP TOO OP
---
I think it's you that can't follow simple logic.Why do I have to give you a reason why your idea is bad where you already made up your mind that killers use BBQ&amp;Chilli as a crutch perk and that patrolling is camping.And yet you can't reply to me without insulting me and asking if I have that ability to do so.Yeah, stay classy
---
Don't forget to nerf Surveillance as well
---
If the Wraith is standing over the downed survivor then the standing survivor can go work on generators to work an escape, check chests for items they can use to save (flashlight especially because lightburn), and if all chests are searched or there are too many gens to run an escape plan then you just lost, you got stomped and your teammate is dying so go find the hatch. Btw, the Wraith is not perfectly invisible when cloaked, even when standing still you can see his big glowy eyes floating in the air. Unless you got totally stomped, you are not powerless. Adapt to the circumstances.
---
You insidious camp the basement box the whole game
---
That will never happen. People WILL stop playing if they can't group up with friends. Horrible marketing decision right there. 
---
An obvious stream snipe, so annoying
---
I run Distressing, Chili, Ruin and Thanatophobia. You can replace any of the last 2 with Thrill of the Hunt (or any other of your favorite perks) for more guaranteed hunting points but I can usually max all categories without it.
---
And why should they have that ability then? They shouldn't. Crappy strats need a crappier detriment. 
---
Currently the game has no dedicated servers, the killer is the host of the match. So all the survivor's ping is dependent on how well they can connect to the killer, and the killer to them.
---
First person to the hatch should get the hatch, period.
---
Why is this so true, lol. I usually let the last guy escape if they had a DC on their team or someone was sandbaging. But some of them are so scared they take like half an hour to actually finish the gens.
---
Yeah the killer hosts the match, their computer is the game's server that everyone else's inputs are channeled through.
---
Yeah just people not running their best gear and also Christmas just happened
---
Playing against noobie survivors is the most hilarious shit
---
I don't have a full build yet. I would run BBQ, distressing, ToTH, Ruin. Ruin is stubborn and won't appear on my web yet though :(
---
Legion benefits from high TR just like Doc so distressing is a win/win for their power and points. ToTH for the extra hunting points and to protect ruin. BBQ cuz it's BBQ
---
Legion is able to get decent points in Deviousness, Hunting, and Brutality all in a single chase. Between ending chases quickly, hitting survivors 3+ times in a seconds, and just using their frenzy can net you roughly 1k-2k points across all 3 categories in a single chase.
---
There are for sure better perks to run for Legion, but these are if you just want to focus on BP
---
I knew i was right, thanks for the answer
---
That's what's happening to me like 90% of the time when only 3 survivor load into the match + dc xD
---
I had a game yesterday where the survivors got the exit open and all ran out except for one of them. He just wanted the hatch escape. The hatch was very close to the exit and he was healthy and I didn’t have NOED or anything. I got to the hatch before he did and so commenced a hatch standoff. Usually I’d just let the last one get the hatch but if the exit is open and within safe range for the survivor to just escape then I won’t give the survivor the hatch just because they want to be greedy. The standoff lasted five minutes of him just teabagging the hatch and me not moving. Eventually he just ran to the exit. However, he didn’t just run out. He came back to the hatch where I was still standing there. He tried to jump in right in front of me thinking I was AFK. This is where I promptly grabbed him and hooked him. Sent him a message after the game saying that’s what he gets for being greedy. He said his swf group laughed at him after the game. I’ve never felt better after a bad game lol
---
I guess the entity had a rough night...And forget to clean up. Happen to everyone ..or thing..
---
I completely agree, getting massacred and escaping through the “so you dont feel completely bad about getting dominated” hatch shouldnt reward more points than going through the gates(the primary objective). maybe swap the points given between the two.
---
i agree with those points you got there. Still doesn't change the fact that i almost only see huntresses use it. Like no one else would bother trying to use it or even have it unlocked for other characters. (speculation)
---
oof...
---
must of been shit survivors.
---
ok so to make it more clear, he crawled to the exit, passed the escape limit, and nothing happened, so he tried to get out of the map, he ended up falling then he got thrown somewhere random in the map, and died bleedin out, crazy...
---
Then you let them get the hatch because wow bro. Have all the blood points 
---
This is how I feel because I only play killer every so often. I feel bad against some of the new players; tonight I fought survivors so new they dropped *every pallet* even when I was a mile away.  I saw a survivor so unfamiliar with looping they ran *away* from pallets! 
---
I just play normally. The only way they'll learn to get better is to be faced with tougher opposition. New players have to see what works and what doesn't.

---
You put a lot of work Into this. Great job, I love it 
---
Hatch is worth 7K while gate escape gives 5K points, right?
---
I agree, propper escape giving almost 90% in survival category and emergency way out giving a little more than a half makes more sense.
---
I haven't gone up against it and actually used a locker yet. When you get out of the locker does the exposed effect show up on screen or is it a secret? 
---
i understand that, but it really doesn't seem intentional to me the achievement description really doesn't suggest that and given the power doesn't track people who are already in deep wounds, i really doubt they expect you to hunt down someone who's like just about to finish their mend. something about it just feels off to me.
---
Sadly mimic powers will never work because of SWF, they can tell each other who is real so all you're left with is no terror radius on a timer.
---
You literally said "can't make a single mistake, because it probably means I've lost" So you're saying in almost all cases you have to play perfect to win. Maybe read what you said before telling me I can't read. THEY ALREADY BUFFED LEGION. I've told that to you so many times now so at this point I'm assuming you didn't even fully read any of my comments. What words have I put in your mouth? If you're talking about "HE IS GETTING BUFFED NOT NERFED. When will you get that in your head?" You said this situation is like Freddy ("Is example true? Yes. Was it similar case to what happens now?") But he's not getting buffed so it's not the same. Survivors are constantly punished for their mistakes just as killers are. And the fact that you're getting kills means that the game is fairly balanced. Also as I have stated before Wraith buffs did help with him pushing him from trash tier to low-mid tier so using him as an example is just ridiculous.
---
Mori smh
---
You know that if you don't buy that perk it'll just show up again later right?
---
This bug is from good ol' 2016, all the way back when Saboteur was a must-use perk, and [the bloodwebs were absolute cancer](https://imgur.com/a/ZKWmrXx). 
---
Why? Killers are there to kill, not to be nice.
---
The entity is a 15 year old emo kid who likes to decorate with glow lights now 
---
Mike Myers picking up his baby from the crib...."C'mere snookie cookie..."
---
Well, just to clarify, the killer is the host but the connection is between both the survivor and the killer. So, the killer could have a great Internet connection but if the survivor lives extremely far away the ping between them will be bad.
---
why not post a clip of what happened instead of a offline twitch channel
---
It sucks I hope they change it
---
The exposed effect shows up on screen and its such a niche perk that tbh the only killer i think that would get use is huntress to be able to reload hatches faster bc you open lockers i think 50% faster too.
---
Ah I see
---
i posted the clip man, wtf
---
At this point I have to assume that you either lie on purpose again or are just too dumb to notice how everything you say is wrong. I've tried to help you, but I see it's pointless. I've wasted enough time on someone who just covers his ears and screams "I CANNOT HEAR YOUUU! I AM RIIIGHT! LALALALALAAA!".   
---
Have a comfy echo chamber there.
---
Yea I think it’s a perk used by soft survivors who like to crouch around and hide smh. I love killing survivor friend groups who all use urban evasion thinking they can just hide in corners. Bonus points if they’re Claudette. I will kill them immediately if I see it’s a Claudette using UE
---
Dude, the trolls will always find a way. We can only do so much before we hurt the legitimate players.
---
Oh. Yeah that makes more sense. Well, regards from North America!
---
I was against a really good hillbilly who had good perks on, and with out something like spine chill I never know if he’s actually up or downstairs.
---
Dude don't even bother doing totems, just do generator bruteforcing through the ruin. If you miss great skill check wait until the lightning effect is gone and go back on it. Looking for the ruin totem is not a good strategy.
---
Dude I thought the exact same thing. This is hardly worthy, needs a redo.
---
I use BBQ, Bloodhound, Monitor, and Beast of Prey. The last one is great for farming builds since legion starts and ends a lot of chases.
---
Once you get pretty good, killers will often see you even if you hide, so it kind of just becomes move as quickly as you walk, except you are shorter. It isn't worthless, just there are better stuff you could fill that slot with. But then, I already said it is my favourite survivor perk so I wouldn't exactly say you shouldn't use it...
---
Why would he though? It would just be wasting time, it's better for the both of you to just get into another match. 
---
Just go look online for a video.
---
A single hook worth about 15k BP? And even more if Survivors played BPS? Damn right it is.
---
Probably cause I don't fall for their shit. Or maybe it's cause there's at least 3 bear traps on the hatch by the time they get there
---
On it
---
 ok so to make it more clear, he crawled to the exit, passed the escape limit, and nothing happened, so he tried to get out of the map, he ended up falling then he got thrown somewhere random in the map, and died bleedin out, crazy... 
---
I used to have a mohawk because I wanted a mohawk. I'm an introvert so I don't enjoy random attention; and although it did indeed generate more attention to myself, my purpose for my mohawk was to just have a mohawk.
---
I've addressed your bullshit many times. You ignored it over and over, only trying to insult me more. I am right and I know it, you are wrong and you probably don't realise that.
---
Although I don't run it often, Kindred is one of my favorites. Nothing is more frustrating as a hooked person or another survivor when you have multiple people coming for the save. Numerous times I've been on a gen and waited awhile, then realized nobody is going for the save, run across the map, then right when I get there, someone gets the save. Same thing as a hooked survivor. Wait forever then three come at once. This also allows my team to see gens are that they might have trouble finding.
---
Meat plant isn't exactly a strong billy map. He can't get from gen to gen nearly as efficiently as any of the outdoor maps. But even so, if you are dealing with a ruin you can't find, it can make for a rough game for you.
---
It still doesn't justify people being a dick to the player who picks him.
---
Interesting angle ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
The map’s bad, especially as a newer player.
---
You’ll start to get used to the floors and rooms. If the killer it camping hatch, here’s what to do:
---
1. Find hatch, jump in if killer is no where near, or follow steps below if he’s camping
---
2. If he’s camping don’t let him see you, slowly approach, until you’re as close as possible but try not to get seen.
---
3. Once your close, sprint towards the hatch, but DONT jump in, stand on the hatch with the killer
---
4. If he swings at you, instantly jump in. He will be in a locked animation while your jumping
---
5. If he doesn’t swing, stand alongside him. The problem is, if you jump in, the killer can grab you straight onto his shoulder, and then easily take you to a hook. 
---
6. This becomes a hatch standoff, neither player can do anything - if you jump he’ll grab you, if he swings then you’ll jump in
---
7. Simple play the waiting game. He might try to bait you by backing off, and you can do the same - try and get him to accidentally hit you. 
---
8. Jump in when available. Most time, the killer will let you in if you wait long enough
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Lmfao as a previous trapper main, I can tell you're in the green and yellow ranks. No good survivor is going to wait for you to set traps around the hatch before they just jump (because setting traps takes at least two seconds with the fastest addons), and if you're wasting three traps when the hatch spawns, you're just stupid.
---
come off it. you're making yourself seem like a shit killer.  
---
20biteen y'all.
---
Shoulda just turned around and crawled back over the line again. Woulda triggered the escape.
---
I have been facecamped in the basement as LF, and you know what? Them's the breaks. Maybe next time I'll be more sneaky and not get caught first. The counter to camping is gen rushing; and when I'm on the hook I tell others to let me hang and get the job done. Once 4 gens pop the camper will have reservations about doing it again. Sure, I die but I die so my teammates can live.
---
It would just encourage trolling so people lose on purpose to not hit a certain rank threshold.

There is literally no way to tell if a survivor knows where the hatch is or not. You're just trying to play devil's advocate for a subject you should be agreeing about. when survivor mains try to pretend they play as killers 🙃😐.
---
Aww thanks :3
---
Please don't encourage hatch standoff behaviour... It is just the worst. I give the same advice to both killers and survivors, if you are in a hatch standoff, just take the loss. It isn't worth 20 minutes of your life.
---
Much better~
---
Fuck you.
---
I am aware of that. Being associated with someone has no basis on this discussion but nice try?
---
As for the 2nd part, we just got done with an event. The top ranked players are the ones that played the most so naturally they have an abundance of addons and offerings. Give it a week or two.
---
It’s a confession thread idc, wasting killer moris is fun

he gen’t

Better.

thanks!

You are the one insulting I hope you realize that. Examples: "Try bending reality more to fit it to your "survi nerfed!!!!!!1111" propaganda.", "But hey, typical survi." and "Please, either go play F13 or stop being such a moron" Also you haven't responded to me telling you that they already buffed legion and that how is the game extremely unbalanced if you're constantly getting kills. You've also apparently closed your mind so you just keep shouting the same shit at me "I am right and I know it"
---
The hatch tends to exist before everyone has completely died. Besides, it never usually comes to that, because everyone's usually dead. No kne will ever have the same game, I always try my hardest to put measures in place to stop hatch standoffs if I can. I really have no idea how that makes me seem shit. It's like you assume survivors have fucking x Ray vision on the hatch. Not everyone is gonna find it instantly
---
(by the way, is anyone else getting told they're commenting too much, but only on this sub reddit, or is that just me? Cause its making it really hard to actually reply when I want to) 
---
yeah, it's hard to implement it if theres SWF.  Plus an in-game voice chat wouldn't work because of things like discord
---
Unbreakable let's you get back up once

Styptic Agent/Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe to instantly heal a Dying Survivor
---
&gt;Deerstalker needs to be removed to prevent end game slugging.
---
If we're talking Gates are powered end game then no, everything's fair game once Gates are powered
---
&gt;If survivors are able to get to the “FIND HELP” point they should get one freebie and pick themselves up because chances are if they do have a perk that does that the killer won’t allow it the second.
---
If a Killers strategy is Slugging I highly doubt they wouldn't be chasing a different Survivor unless end game where everything's fair game.
---
&gt;That or put a suicide option
---
Wouldn't mind it so if you're outside like 24 meters of the Killer and not moving, recovering, or being interacted with for 3 to 5 seconds you start bleeding out faster up to 25%, would make it so when the last two Survivors are both Dying and the Killer can't find one of you much better.

You sound like you're having fun typing this replies.
---
Eh I've been against it and won
---
Not to be a dickhead but I’m rank 1 survivor every other season and I main stay urban evasion. 
---
Going into lockers to counter madness is something that's rarely done, but on paper iron maiden doesn't sound like a bad pick on doctor. It's still a perk slot being used, but it would really extend the doctor's anti-stealth abilities
---
I'll just spirit fury behind you yelling GET SPOOKED BITCH!
---
Your not taking either human error or map difference into consideration, without bloodhound following blood trails on places like Thompson house or really foresty places is pretty difficult and takes a keen eye, which in the lower ranks (8-20 in my experience) isn’t a common ability of killers understandably, and the killer doesn’t have a way of confirming you have distortion so if you are using distortion against a proximity aura reading they likely won’t stick around too long if they didn’t see you at first, without evidence of a survivor near by they most likely will move on and look for someone else
---
Time is really important in a game like this, so time spent doing something like healing or doing a gen is incredibly worthwhile
---
If outside of a chase and the killer doesn’t know where you are, trying to heal when they have nurses is a death sentence, but using distortion you’d be able to heal without them knowing your nearby.
---
 Distortion isn’t just a lame counter to bbq, it’s got just as much practical use as something like “dance with me” or even decisive.
---
Just because there are other counters to aura reading doesn’t make it viable, you use decisive to escape the killer’s grasp, why not just not be caught?
---
ahahahahhahaaha
---
Honestly, i just smack them/let the killer grab or do remaining gens. Youre not going to find me waste time pussyfooting around at the hatch. Just take the L; who cares. You can get more points moving on to the next game than to spend 40 minutes playing the hatch game. Its really that much of an issue. 
---
Its very good for breaking chase once you lose line if sight with the killer so they start looking for you in an area to then you can just move out of there 
---
The Entity is pleased with this revelation 
---
I see you're unable to conjure a proper response. Such a shame.
---
This is why I always run empathy. It's a crutch I guess, but I always have a sense of where the killer is chasing the tasty sausage and which sides of the map are safe. 
---
Survivors rarely recognize nice. I had a 3v1 the other day resulting from an insta DC after the map loaded (we were still in the spin around d bit), so they still had 5 gens to do. So I mostly screwed around only trying to get points and BBQ stacks. The Adam still played immersed AF forcing me to 2 hook a Survivor to draw him out. Got him, let the other save him after, and they still teabagged on the way out.
---
Like, bitch please. You lived because I was being nice, not because you're good. Cause other than the Adam, you weren't.
---
Either bad intentional design or really lazy technical design.
---
You should be interrupted once you finally transition at the very least.
---
Ive tested it in a kyf match. It does work with object of obsession! So you get 30 seconds of free peeks  without the killer seeing you! 
---
As a P3 Dwighty, when I read legion's perks I was immediately scared. Two of his 3 perks counter Dwight's reserved, team orientated playstyle. The iron maiden is a given to the stereotype, but even discordance is nasty to the leader+bond combo
---
again, if you're wasting three traps when the hatch spawns (and if everyone's "dead" the earliest that will happen is 3 gens and two survivors) you're a shit killer. every good survivor main has an add on that allows the transportation of more than one trap, and you're more likely to trap a survivor by placing those traps under windows and in loop able tall grass areas due to survivor already looking for the spawned hatch and trying to be sneaky. 
---
your scenario only works on noob survivors. bc every survivor can disarm traps, and unless you're sitting there camping the UNOPENED hatch, your traps are getting disarmed, and your strategy is bullshit. i have a p3 trapper. i know this very well. 
---
Remember when Fire Up was the all-around speed perk while Brutal Strength was just for pallets? Darn
---
Susie&gt;Nea any day of the week
---
he's setting some mood lighting...he just wants to romance you
---
yes, it's really that much of an issue. what if you happen to be trying to get an adept trophy? point blank is that hatch stand offs shouldn't happen, and if you're defending them, you're a survivor main. lol 
---
Fair enough, maybe I get more value than my perception of it is. Or maybe I don't use it to full power. I would like to say that I never said it was a bad perk, but it's a pretty valid point you make all the same.
---
Right! Like as a survivor main I don’t teabag not only bc I find it rude but like.. you gonna feel dumb as hell when you get downed. It makes me lol when new or bad players do it bc you know they can’t escape the chase but oooh I’m the bad one because I didn’t tunnel your ass
---
Happy cake day!
---
He'd grab it by the foot what're you talkin' about
---
The entire double points week for me. 
---
I'm still new to this game and I'm just now learning signs that the killer wants to farm but god, if this wasn't me the first few times it happened. 
---
The accuracy of this post
---
Monitor and Abuse and Pharmacy. No joke, I love these perks. MaA makes most killers a lot more stealthier. And the increased FOV is very nice, and the fact that you lose it in chase makes you able to go for those max range lunges without fuckups. And Pharmacy I've been using since it came out, cause IMO and with my experience it's better than Self Care. And with the healing nerf and buff to Sloppy it just got better.
---
IM ABUSING THE SHIT OUT OF THIS MUAHAHAHA!!!
---
&gt; You don't pick it to counter camping
---
Except you do. Borrow time only works if the killer is in the area of the unhook. Otherwise it has zero affect. 
---
"guess I'll just throw my 6 years of experience in the fucking garbage"
---
100% a statement you cannot prove, and your commentary strongly suggests otherwise. 
---
"o be honest, you sound like you always go down first and get camped, and are salt venting to a forum where your opinion doesn't matter anywsy"
---
Seems to matter enough to you to respond every single time. 
---
"because the devs aren't gonna read your post and they certainly aren't gonna use your idea."
---
And here's where you blatantly tell me that you don't know anything about game design, or being involved with any legitimate company. Doing outside research is always a great place for data, not just your own forums. 
---
"This thread is a waste of space."
---
Kinda similar to the inside of your head. If you don't like it, move on. 
---
I like how the video stops just before the chainsaw death lol. But yeah, distance is kind of hard to judge in this game.
---
Only if they dont stop coming.

---
I'm a shit killer? Boi last season I was rank 5. I can guess that you're gonna say "that's a shit rank" because you're clearly a dead by daylight god since you're able to hit level 50 3 times. Just because a strategy doesn't work for you doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You're probably on a different platform to me. Which brings another variable into the mix and again, (here's the main point) I havent played killer since about the end of november since my friends own the game now. 
---
I don't know who you're playing against bit they're definitely not even close to the same people I am
---
not worth the effort. you are just salty 
---
nobady cares lmao
---
i would love a 8 team game with 10 gens. Would be a complete shit show full of toxicity and would be great 
---
I had the same thing happen to me on survivor. Every pool of blood that formed turned into a blinding blue light. I couldn't look at my screen without wanting to pass out lol.
---
go to their profiles and they are for thailand, china and philipinas
---
losing the game because 2 survivors are hooked at the same time rarely happens because of things like DS, insta-heals etc.
---
Also, you don't seem to understand that killers asking for buffs isn't for personal gain, it's to allow us to actually feel like a killer and not as someone who gets bullied by 4 powerful people.
---
I run a catch me if you can kate build. 
---
Light weight, boil over, self care, Urban.
---
I always spawn near the killer and it became a running meme in my friend group to the point that they would ask me who the killer was as the match started. So with that build, which I recommend you give a try. Anytime you get a pallet stun? You are gone.
---
Between the lightweight T3 making your marks vanish as they are breaking the pallet and the speed boost from urban evasion you can almost always turn a pallet stun into a full map juke. Just 1 pallet, killer breaks it comes running around the corner, marks already gone? But of course he’ll search. That’s when urban comes in, with good camera panning you can stalk the killers every move hugging corners and cutting angles while he desperately looks around.  
---
well, china not but japan 
---
That's great, bro. I play survivor just as much as killer and i'm rank 2 in both. You're bragging about getting to rank 5 LAST season? k. 
---
your strategy exists, and it's a shit strategy. and good trapper main will tell you that... next. 
---
No witnesses, discordance, nurse, gg
---
I'm also a Dwight main. That's why I posted this because I fear it.
---
Just make a casual mode where you dont gain or lose rank. It will be just for fooling around or trying new things out.
---
Bitter Murmur &lt; Rancor &lt; Discordance
---
BM is okay, but the information it feeds you isnt always useful. Sometimes it will show you survs far enough away that by the time you get there they have cleared out. Its most useful aspect is for end game when the last gen is done and it shows you where everyone is imo.
---
Rancor is a levelled up BM because it feeds you the same info, except it shows you where *everyone* is, not just the people beside the gen that just got done. The free mori is just icing on the cake, especially if you are running NOED
---
Discordance is the best genny perk because it really helps slow the game down. It also gives you info on surv locations while you still have time to do something about it. 
---
Criesinxbox
---
Nah i last for a whole 5 seconds 👌
---
Doctor is the first that comes to mind. In his shock therapy mode he makes survivors within a range of him scream every now and then, even if you haven't shocked them yet. 
---
Nnnnnnnnnyyooooooooom
---
Throwing "survivor main" at anyone who disagrees with your opinion, as if it were an insult or something, reinforces my "petty" comment.  
---
As a killer, if we make it to the hatch and the survivor is anywhere near, we lose. It's a dumbass system but it's what we have. If you need to sit there for 30 minutes and force a standoff because of your fragile ego, you cannot come here and complain about the situation YOU created.
---
Con: You'll still have latency to wherever the server happens to be located. If you live far away from the server, it might not be the best.
---
Con: There's a chance a lot of the BS in DBD isn't connection, but rather hitbox programming; things like killer weapon curving around corners, hatchets that miss by a mile hitting, Nurse swings etc.
---
Con: We will have to live through BHVR implementing dedicated servers. Every big update has bugs, and who knows what kind of bugs we'll get with dedicated servers.
---
Not even reading your shite. You're a fucking hypocrite first you comment "next" trying to be a smug prick and then come back to chat more shit (the difference here is I asked if we were done, which we obviously aren't btw) then you complain about me "bragging" and then go on to brag about your ranks. You're either incredibly stupid or blinded by your own salt. Now I am actually done. Don't expect another reply, you salty prick
---
Oh, I do like that a lot! I'm embarrassed I didn't think of it first! Haha!
---
Well thank you for you input!
---
it's crazy that they can "work," on something for so long that's easily fixable. survivor stands near the hatch while it's open for a certain amount of time, it closes for that certain amount of time. 
---
but hey. i guess it's rocket science. 
---
Becuase it wouldn't be fair.
---
And im not saying it wouldn't be fair for those getting banned cause screw them. but seeing as how console players can create an account with dead by daylight every 2 minutes for free while pc players have to pay each time, something doesn't feel right about this
---
My other response is just run for the hatch and jump in. If the killer gets me then he gets me. I’d rather the game be over and get into another match instead of wasting a lot of time not getting any bloodppoints. 
---
Won't argue the map isn't a mess at times. The RNG on the pallets, generators and hooks can sometimes make the map just ridiculous with having all the gens on the bottom floor and all the hooks on the top floor for instance. Some killers like doctor can just utterly dominate because it is fairly small in size. But I just like the aesthetic of it and the two floor gimmick.
---
great, be done then. 
---
You're welcome! Also, if you could inflict Mangled on them if they were downed normally via a Mori length animation, that'd be cool. 
---
try turning down ur bloomquality in the launch options
---
Trapper, not too much to think about with his power, just set traps and wail away at survivors. He's good for learning the basics of killer
---
I wouldn't mind settling down with Huntress, Trapper, or Pig to be honest
---
I was highly confused then I read your name/flair.
---
Or just simply add like one new map in every second month? Or is it too much 🤔 would still love it. Or make a series of new maps involving the old stories, how the maps are different depending on what season it is, which is an easy way to variate the old maps. They could realease them one by one and it'll make a lot more interesting to play in the maps
---
Even better is killing them with kindness. "I hope you have a better night. :)" has gotten me quite a few "Fuck you"s back.
---
noed on a spirit oof.
---
I genuinely love urban evasion.
---
T3 urban evasion means your crouch speed is equal to your walking speed. Never have an excuse to walk now, always run around, or crouch around.
---
I play in a very weird play style for survivor, where I try to escape the killer in a chase and not loop him. I turn a corner, and urban evasion while hidden, then urban evasion away.
---
It doesn’t sound special, but it can work, and I’m currently at lower ranks where it does well.
---
I’m also pretty immersed in the game too, so I guess you an say that, but I genuinely think it has a great use

---
It’s harder to convince people as LF. He’s a good boy but lots of people who play him are scumbags. It doesn’t help that he can get multiple insta downs.
---
I have a much easier time convincing people as doc or trapper. 
---
On Myers, I have over 30 of his common add-ones. I simply don’t use them in my normal games, in fact I don’t use any. 
---
As survivor, I seem to probably lose my item once every 3-5 games, so everything just builds up over time 
---
It’s not just 7k in the survival category, it’s 5k in survival and 2k in objective.
---
It's very bad. The thing is if you have 3 people, it needs to find lobbies where there are only 1 person in them. I know that it should be easy but for the love of this game, I can't understand why it is hard as fuck.
---
Camping is hard to counter because it's human behaviour, and those who do it just like making people mad, therefore not caring about points. Best thing you can do is just not get caught in the first place (which is the aim of the game already)
---
Gotta love it when someone gives up because they realize they're in the wrong. :)
---
i'm throwing survivor main out there because this issue directly benefits survivors, and any survivor main commenting on this thread trying to make it seem like it's anything other than a bad game mechanic is delusional and playing devil's advocate. 
---
Again, if someone is trying to get adept killer with ANY killer, they can't unless they slug or are in lower ranks. facts. and if you're a survivor main trying to argue with me, you're wrong. sorry that hurts YOUR ego.  bye. 
---
The mechanics of tilting an opponent is something not to be underestimated.
---
Generally when I see a person tbag that I am not engaged in a chase with, I know there is someone else that does NOT want to be found, so I ignore the looper and keep hunting.
---
Only person that lived*** .. that I was a body camper and is toxic. No auras were shown so they were obviously near. Just do the gens if you think I’m body camping. Calls me toxic but the more toxic thing is to message somebody after the game . Lol
---
Oh god it looks like that ugly retro jason skin from f13. Retro trapper skin incoming!

Or a city styled street  map ? Or a dusty old wild West Street village map? Or anything, just with a little imagination

Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
If you are doing a gen then then BBQ doesn't matter. It's obly useful for nurses. 1 perk. That the killer might not even run. What's good about a perk that a might not even be useful? If you're talking about healing other survivors then just do one of the multitude of things that counter said perk. Why run a perk that will maybe help you sometimes during a match, when you can just run other perks that help you the entire game? All of claudette's, any exhaustion perk, we'll make it,  etc. You want perks that you know will help you.
---
You can simply counter killer aura reading perks by just using the in game mechanics, you don't need a perk to do it for you. You can make back anytime you used avoiding those perks by using other useful perks.
---
Its been a while. I think actually the last time he got a new cosmetic was either his classy charlatan (Which is his bright blue flamingo shirt and his hat with a nice mustache) or his robes. I cant find a date for his robes but his classy charlatan came out july 31st. So he hasnt had new ones since 5 months ago 
---
Someone t-bagged the shit out of that box.
---
Ace Ventura handle and deliver that package?
---
Had a teammate dc and we played against a camping huntress aiming her hatchets from a far. It was 1 v3 with 5 gens. The first message I get is feed me your salt. I really hate people sometimes. 
---
If you DC you are even worse than them.
---
Slugging is a tactic
---
Yeah but in that case you just self care and it’s a gg. It’s still a fat L for the killer.
---
Seriously. People act like Dead By Daylight is some competitive e-sport. It’s literally her job to entertain people, and it works given how popular her stream is. I’ve never seen her be outwardly toxic, unless you count SWF and DS to be toxic. If you do, you’re fucking wrong, sorry. They make dumb plays all the time because they don’t care about escaping. 
---
As a main killer I recommend trapper bc you'll learn all the basics without worrying about power and he has nice base perks.
---
Truth. Heroes of the Storm has b-stepping; pretty much t-bagging for that MOBA. I play Murky, a murloc who only gives 1/4th of a normal kill. My goal is Murky is to pull other opponent aggro away from actual valuable members of my team. So yes, I do b-step to be an annoying bastard.
---
That being said, unless I get b-stepped back, at the end of match if I win, I generally do not b-step. I maintain it as a tactic to tilt, but during the game, not the afternath.
---
So you had 3 minutes to do a gen and a totem what’s the problem?
---
Trapper is your best bet for a beginner killer. His power does most of the work for you, and all you have to worry about is setting traps and hitting M1
---
That’s a nice idea actually.
---
Remember though, the closing hatch mechanism they trialed was completely one-sided to the Killers
---
Nice pallet, be a shame if someone flew over it.
---
It's called leveling up smh
---
BITCH DONT MESSAGE BACK!!!
---
Gameplay wise it doesn't make sense, being that if the killer doesn't take survivors off of gens he loses every time. Camping doesn't work if the survivors play smart, killers will get one kill and Derank. Additionally his does it make sense that a champion of this dark entity cant even defend a dude on a hook from getting pulled of it by another person. I recomend you put some time into killer, cause if you've played even a semi-decent amount of killer against actual good survivors you'll see how camping will work extremely rarely and is sometimes needed (spending 15 seconds patrolling hooks to confirm kill when gens are getting rushed, defending exit gate hook, etc.) for any killer. 
---
I'm a Surv main but I'm red ranks with Survivor and Killer (for a very rough estimate of perspective).
---
You have -2 in karma
---
Almost, the sliding part could be hard.
---
Sure, keep making excuses and justify things for their behavior :^)
---
Honestly, fair enough.
---
As killer, I kinda like the challenge. I’ll never make the hatch standoff boring. I’ll try my best to keep you on the spot - moving back and forth, maybe swinging a little, or binging and bonging my bell a lil
---
You can't just compare two situational perks and say if one is good they other one is also good. We'll make it can activate more than 3 times, and is much more likely to proc. Also pretty sure that gens can sometimes just not conceal your aura
---
In total or just for that reply?

HILARIOUS, SO FUNNY TO SEE THIS POSTED 50 TIMES A DAY! NICE JOB BRO!
---
You got soke serious dental problems of you're shaking off blood like that
---
You wrong boi. We are committed to delivering the pizza on time no matter the distance. 
---
Yeah it actually helped you and it’s always fun to see this game freak out from time to time aha 
---
I remember I had a game as Myers and I hooked 2 survivors within the first minute and then the 3rd came to unhook in front of me while I was Tier 3 so that was 3 survivors already dead bc they all killed themselves and the Jeff messaged me "Welp" (I play on Xbox, so yeah) and I just told him "Let me finish this ritual and you can have hatch" and he agreed
---
And how about you fuck off asshole
---
Yeah but how can he justify deranking if he can't make shit up like that?
---
Dont worry. You can only submit links every 10 minutes, even across different subreddits. Might be the same for text posts.
---
Sorry but not sorry.If they sat on their ass 3 minutes then they deserve it.
---
I’m not saying that because wmi is good distortion, I’m saying in their own rights they’re both good, distortion is balanced to proq only 3 times, wmi might not be used at all in a game just like distortion, using both you could get singled out early in a game and be camped to death, playstyles obviously differ using different perks. Being a hook jockey and being a gen jockey use way different perks, wmi for hook, distortion more likely for gen, if you don’t see a use to it that doesn’t mean it isn’t viable in any way
---
The generally accepted action to represent friendly or farming killer is to repeatledly smack a generator with your weapon. Don't expect every survivor to get the message though.
---
I know right
---
I support this
---
That's what Kill Your Friends is for. A casual mode will probably still have tryhards in it. A perkless and add on less mode would be nice. 
---
I'm a killer main, and even I think the flight buff was overkill for Billy.
---
Happens to me alot. It's all RNG unless you use a map offering
---
What you said is completely illogical - your applying a status to one circumstance and to another, though those are two very different circumstances.
---
If you don’t want to be in a hatch standoff, just don’t start one. Instead, look for the survivor and not the hatch.
---
*but they’re looking for the hatch so I should go there*
---
No, just don’t. Act as if the hatch doesn’t exist and walk past it if you want to. If you care so much, stand near the hatch and do whatever. In my opinion, it’s the killer who keeps the standoff going as they’re the ones with the power
---
Not only that, but some of the best killers are also amazing survivors. You can go watch Zubat play survivor and he doesn't run into any of these problems as a red rank survivor, but apparently Jen does, after all if she didn't, how could she justify to her ignorant viewers that it's fine to derank because "EVERY KILLER HAS MORI'S/TUNNELS/CAMPS/IS A NURSE!" Please.
---
If you are on console, it was disabled for a while because it caused the game to crash. Otherwise, just bad luck.
---
Your killer teammates CAN do gens? Tell me the secrets...
---
The only killer more tedious to deal with is Legion. I severely dislike how he takes no skill to play, because simply walking around spamming his ability finds survs. I get that he's easy to loop but I hate looping and being looped as killer so I try not to do it.
---
Idk why you have to be such a jerk.
---
Downvoted because your meme sucks
---
I know, I've just been excited to see it. Youd think after somewhere between 100 and 200 games itd pop.

Dude, gens aren’t always able to hide your aura, even if a slight corner of you is peeking out behind a gen through aura reading the killer can tell it’s you because of the small movements, hiding in a locker is time that could be spent working on a gen, and any time your aura can be read it will most likely lead to you being downed, bbq is meta, and so is pretty much anything that easily locates or slows down survivors (ruin and whatnot), you aren’t always able to hit your decisive skill check, or you aren’t always able to unhook, but you will most likely be able to successfully use a token of distortion to your advantage, stealth is pretty much everything in this game (except against doctor) so anything that helps keep you hidden is a safe bet to put trust into, chances are people are more likely to hide in lockers than drum distortion so killers are likely to check lockers, which leads to an instant carry, use your decisive then and it’s almost just as useless as no perk, don’t use it and you might not ever get off the hook, distortion allows you to stick to your guns and be able to roam around rather than stay in one place that can easily get you killed, and you can use perks along with distortion, you know, running something like lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and distortion leads to easily being able to juke the killer with vaulting, getting in and out of lockers fast and quiet, no scratch marks and no aura reading for 3 times, and being safe with tokens use means your likely to be able to utilize distortion effectively

Not to defend her and her SWF's actions but some people really really have the mentality of "kill the streamer". If I get the same treatment you bet that I'm gonna play civ or some shit. For reference, this is almost 2 years ago and still people are having the same mentality of making streamers life hell in game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqiqq3Zl0Ac&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLJPNNFSh4wcp7L_sI29YZxjpV7IrI1Kpr
---
Sprint burst level 4
---
Yeah hook campers make me want to not play as the survivor especially when people feed the killer 
---
You can't really stop campers and tunnelers. It's frustrating af but also shows that you're good enough to piss the killer off or killer is crap himself. I get your pain tho 
---
I had a DC as a Leatherface so I dropped from murder mode to farm mode.
---
...But I accidentally miscounted my hooks on a Nea. I felt so bad I pulled her from a gen to kill her. I DCed out of shame. :(
---
Try that very rare wraith pallet breaker thing + the stompy perk
---
BOPBOP Funny as shit, I spend half the game just breaking pallets FAST AS FUCK BOIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiiiIIIIIIIEEeeeeeee
---
1. Stop assuming people are something when they’re not, and no need to insult people for going against you.
---
2. Try to be a little less narrow-minded about other people’s opinions. Read them, take them in and think how that would work, then logically reply with your side, and work to a better conclusive result for the both of you
---
3. As killer, you’re extremely powerful in this situation. If you feel as if the power is in the survivors hand, than (perhaps I’m wrong) but I feel it heavily weighs to your side.
---
Okay, now I’ve replied, try to respond with a logical approach to my reply okay, and try to keep it as clean as you can, so we can work out a result between the two of us. No need for disrespectful slang either, so keep that to a minimal :)
---
Yeah but if the survivor has half a brain cell they’ll self care before they go look for hatch and if you don’t find them it’s game over. Imo a much better solution would be that if the killer finds the hatch they can close it with a 20 sec channel (like opening an exit gate) or if they power a gen then the exit gates get powered without having to do the other gens. This way if the surv legit finds the hatch before the killer then they get out right then. If not, then the killer has to patrol multiple objectives of which the survivor has a few choices of how they want to get out. Everyone gets a chance but it’s not totally survivor sided.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
"OH GOD I'M FREE TIME TO RUN VERY LOUDLY AWAY"
---
My entire point was that other streamers deal with this shit and even have fun with it, why does this particular streamer deserve special treatment? 
---
Considering it only takes 40k-55k on average to buy everything on a level 50 web, you're better off just going through it normally then.
---
Otherwise its a pretty bad trade and a bit of a bloodpoint trap
---
35k to "reroll" a bloodweb and acquire nothing or 40-50k to at least get a bundle of add ons/offerings some of which are at least useable. I don't think I've ever seen a completely useless bloodweb spawn 
---
😂
---
I've noticed that whenever I have been playing lately, I get at least one survivor who disconnects every game. At times two or everyone else but me will disconnect. I have noticed that it's mostly when it's The Doctor, Clown or Legion. In my opinion they are the most annoying killers, but those have been the camping/tunneling ones I get. A lot of the wraith too.
---
But yes, I've noticed the trend. It effects just about every match I play lately. 
---
End game and hatch mechanics isn't rocket science but the system they tested before way **worse** than what we have now.
---
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean.
---
The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
---
The chance was really high when the Chapter released as I was getting it every few games and seeing the same happen to various streamers. Then it was removed for a while and since it returned I haven't been to it once, so I can only assume the chance is equal to all other maps.
---
Just bring a toolbox and do 2-3 gens and then leave in the hatch.
---
You are acting dense. It is not a negotiation, but its related in the sense that both give the other side information. They are not intrinsically tied together, but talking about one naturally made me think of the other. Lighten up.
---
Good luck using Urban in the chase when I trapped every possible loop around
---
I downvoted because i hate nea so much and her face makes me downvote any post(im just kidding i loved this meme)
---
Take a week break then man. I'm telling you that all killers and survivors are stocked up right now and are going to be using them.
---
&gt;Not to defend her and her SWF's actions 
---
She does not. 
---
i know. i'm still happy with it regardless.
---
Sometimes just the way it goes. Beat to say gg and move on
---
The only thing I hate about it is how far apart the hooks are from each other.
---
yeah, legion definitely isn't the strongest choice by far but they're just too enjoyable!
---
*T H E E N T I T Y*
---
This wasnposted literally 1 hour ago
---
I'm a killer main (Been playing survivor a lot more lately because it's easier) and I still react like this, because not every killer is gonna let a survivor *off the hook*
---
Nea is a dude?
---
Huh i guess that makes sense
---
I haven't read all the way through it yet, but my initial thoughts on the overall concept are that you've got a really neat idea... it's a lot like a more atmospheric doctor.
---
Jesus christ.
---
We are playing the same fucking game. Stop thinking that who you play is anywhere different. I play killer too. No one plays one side exclusively. You can't just throw around "survivor main" to invalidate someones opinion.
---
The hatch is broken, yes. But you just have to fucking give it up sometimes. You just waste your time by sitting there, the survivor can just go do gens anyway. If you want to waste your time and sit on the hatch for 8 years until they fix it, be my guest. But you should go try to find the survivor, instead of just sitting there while the last survivor does gens. You already won, just move on to the next game. If you really don't want to deal with the hatch then kill then all before 2 gens are done, or slug one of them when there are 2 left, then find the last person. But sometimes you gotta realize this game is trash, and just take an L (even though you already 3k'd).
---
Everytime the last player left is a newbie and i'm trying to lead them to the hatch.
---
Shit trying to lead them to the cankers on Halloween was a nightmare. They just run off to hide in lockers.
---
That ugly mofo
---
Sometimes I want to farm but they all think they're smart and start mocking me  so I get mad and sacrifice them instead.
---
It makes sense, overall best killer perk in the game atm. 
---
sloppy butcher is definitely one of the best options imo, but it didn't come close to slowing down the game as much as ruin did for me. that's just my own personal experience though.
---
granted, butcher will always be a better choice for consistency since i swear survivors always spawn in on the totem.
---
Huh, never had it that bad. It's always triggered the escape the instant I tried to re-enter the map.
---
I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say here, be it:
---
1. That BBQ and Chili is too strong
---
2. That it's way too common, and as such, needs to be nerfed
---
Or
---
3. Etc.
---
If its one, stop complaining. BBQ literally has two direct counters now. Distortion (I think it should be buffed, but whatever), and if you don't have that, all you literally have to do is just hide in a locker before the other surv gets hooked.
---
If it's two, stop complaining. Of course it's common, not only is the perk reliably strong, you also get those bonus 100% bloodpoints. And would you say the same of self-care, DS, or even sprint burst?
---
i ran bbq, ruin, thanatophobia, and discordance. thanatophobia and discordance are more flavor than anything though and you can definitely afford to play around with other options!

So then what’s your point? That streamers have to deal with more toxicity than then average player? We already knew that, just some streamers handle it better than others and that’s their own problem.
---
Same here, after a clear meme game we'll often pretend to be super toxic "ggez baby killer" "toxic crutch users uninstall" usually ending with a heart to ensure no bad blood.
---
Sorry, they're a small team, they can't fix that, hands tied.
---
Ah that was the beauty of it! What if that's the best you could get since you can only afford dial up? Back then that was the norm. So pretty much everyone would have the same horrible ping. Location of the host used to be much more important than it is now. You needed to find a game in your city honestly. People did it cause there was just no alternatives and multiplayer was the new hot shit!
---
I am pretty sure that ensures more bad blood.
---
Well...kindness is sometimes never returned..
---
Yea camping is something that happens a lot. All you can do is play generator simulator for 2 minutes. Or if you are getting camped, do literally nothing for 2 minutes. It's not fun in any way, but "iTs mUh pLaYsTyLe" and " U cAN eASiLy CouNtEr iT".
---
Jimmy John's eat your heart out. 
---
No witness sounds like total dicks.
---
Dude I have no idea what people do anymore in this game. This is only at low ranks when a new season is here. The killer will chase me for a while, and the teams literally do nothing!! No gens, nothing. I’ll get hooked. I’ll see their auras, and they most of the time literally just walk around. Not run, but walk around and do nothing. Do they save me? Not usually..
---
The Obsession Claws and the disconnect symbol.
---
I've had this on the past few days with PC as well
---
&gt; Zubat just plays the game. Using addons and such is not toxic.
---
I'm sorry bud but if you think Ebony Mori Omegablink Nurse and toxic you're *that* killer everyone is not wanting to play against. The whole point of his current stream is to show how incredibly broken some of the shit you can do is.
---
Op probably hasn’t touched that bloodweb since legacy got released, which is why it’s still has the old stuff in it.
---
Surgical precision is outclassed by sloppy very hard
---
Maybe all the console killers who said they were going to quit because of the poor optimization actually did?
---
That could make sense, yea
---
Well played
---
Honestly I don't know how people encounter this issue on PS4.
---
I play solo and SWF and in 5sec I have a group while solo, in 2-3min I have group for SWF.
---
It's true that the matchmaking gets bugged so everytime we play in a party, if it takes more than 3 mins wait time, we restart the game and resend the invites. Works like a charm. 
---
We find games all the time after restarting the game. Don't ask me why, but somehow it gets stuck if you wait for a lobby for a long time, the killer DCed or if one of the players hits ready and unready, so the game needs a reload.
---
Hope it works for you too :)
---
the channel solution you suggested makes it function identically to the current version if the survivor gets to the hatch before a killer closes it. That makes it so that it might as well not have bothered to change it.
---
K
---
If the killer has nurse's calling you can use it in the middle of a chase after you get to get rid of scratch marks to pull some pretty sneaky shit.
---
I can hear the music just looking at this
---
Hope you'd be ready for the worst, possible trolls spamming that.
---
That has to be the most annoying thing. Every time I've tried to watch her it's "oh this is *insert name*" and then they farm and sandbag until the killer gives hatch. It was really boring to watch.
---
Oh for sure! 
---
I've had the same problem. I think the games broken. I was playing with a full survivor squad and could not find a killer to play with.
---
Huntress may be from the forest but it's a jungle down there
---
Gen stopper when the Doc tries to take the game hostage and doesn’t just take advantage of Survivors messing up with the gen placement. If he’s taking advantage of bad gen placement then I don’t mind that. It’s the Survivors’ fault and they deserve their punishment. 
---
That’s why they would have a mute button in setting and you could go to match details and it would be right by their name
---
Billy should be the standard all killers are balanced to. There's no reason to nerf him.
---
Never said it wasn't broken. Blame BHVR for imbalances, not the player. As I've stated before this discussion has nothing to do with what was originally talked about. If Zubat lag switches or does something not intended by the devs then come talk to me.
---
I really really  like this concept. Part of me thinks that it might be a tad OP, but then some of me thinks that there'd be allot of counters to this killer. Very good idea though 
---
Or you could just not have voice chat because it's fine without it 
---
What do you define "toxic" as, then, if you truly don't think the most broken thing in the game isn't classified as such?
---
Well some people would want it and it wouldn’t really be a bother cause you could just mute them
---
thanks for the input, this is a rough idea but i really wanted a vision-obscuring killer and didn't know how to make one.  I definitely agree that this killer could be OP
---
I like using enduring on everyone just so i can disrespect pallets. That being said i tend to run nurses or myc with the rest of those perks the same.
---
What do you get when you prestige legion for the first time? 
---
So just play smart unless you're the killer?
---
So people are supposed to just pause their games in the middle of a chase to mute someone who was being obnoxious?
---
Waiting for Bamboozle to show up on my web to try it with Legion. Anyone know if it works on pallet vaulting too?
---
Or you could just go find the survivor and not camp the hatch.
---
If you don’t want voice chat then when the game is on just mute everyone since you say you’re fine without it
---
“Both” lmao sounds like it kid, It’s alright though any moment now Phil Spencer will appear and tell us you’re the worlds most powerful Xbot 
---
When you know that is a mechanic though, it just gives you incentive to run nurse's calling so you can counter that. It isn't as though there isn't any counter to self care.
---
Imagine being so unlikable as a person to run the mental gymnastics to come up with this excuse as to why someone watches her content.
---
Yes, it must be because she has a vagina. It couldn't be anything else lmfao holy shit
---
Well, if you play with your comms muted, then that's entirely your choice, and you can't really complaign if you lose because of that.
---
**Do not shamelessly repost a previously removed submission. Last warning.**

He said the same "survivor main" bs to me too. He is a little dull.

---
You know what's actually toxic to this community? Game breaking bugs, exploits and boring gameplay that has yet to be fixed.
---
You know what isn't toxic? Deranking so you can play against a larger portion of the population rather than rank 1 NOED nurses and moon walking legions.
---
Maybe actually address why people have to derank rather than (very, very blatantly) addressing a particular streamer who does the same as literally every other DBD streamer?
---
But all know why this is even a problem and it's because she's a girl so have fun pretending I guess?
---
What hard to believe ? The ps4 has better exclusives ? 
---
I'm still kinda new myself and I for some reason feel compelled to show mercy and usually try to give the last person the hatch. From what I have heard of the red ranks though I doubt I'd feel that way there.
---
Stridor with headphones is the best method for tracking. And trust me, a good third seal game is better than any devour hope Moris. 
---
I've done all of that with my PC. Like I said, I can play all night without a single crash. It just seems to happen with 2x BP offerings. Maybe a really bad coincidence, but I'm pretty fucking mad as I've lost 5 Puddings and 2 BPS today.
---
Flashlights don't last forever. 
---
The survivors t posing after the legion update
---
I just have a question for you. How would you rather spend your time: hatch standoff for x minutes or move on the next match? Doesnt matter if i am killer main or survivor main. It is the same outcome. 
---
shut up fuckin freddie main
---
I love this, the mask makes it so that even if they’re SWF they won’t know who’s who as you’ll all look the same (maybe it’ll remove their cosmetics too and put them in mime outfits?)
---
Presence throw is real nice but I think it has way too much to it. Ditch the stealth part and just have when you hook a survivor, another one gets a 32 terror radius probably
---
This is an edit of the original which is by the same person because their first version was a failure.
---
👌
---
Pretty sure he showed about as much as the book would allow (where didn't the main character go?). I mean it had boring parts and  PVP vs. PVE parts that didn't make sense, but I can't agree with you.
---
I actually thought it was the circle showing a hooked survivor going to the entity for a second there
---
You're right, it's not about agreeing or not. As I said, it's about a different experience.
---
There's a current one that makes me laugh on PC. Where someone is walking/running, and even though they are moving, the avatar is frozen in standing position as it slides around the map. 
---
i can spend my time however way i please. either way it's a waste. playing video games is neither productive nor life changing. if i'm on playing video games, I have time to kill, so why do you care and why does it matter if i choose a hatch stand off? what matters is that the game has broken mechanics that aren't being fixed. next. 
---
Okay, that's unnecessary. There's no need for that.
---
Yeah it's like blocking a window or pallet

IIRC ther is a program, I will not tell the Name, that will get you to what ever rank you want in one minute. I don't know if it is still working because I never used it. as per Google it still does. I am sure that BHVR can find out who is using 3rd Party programs and / or is disconnecting for deranking. IMO that is also why Noob3 got a ban more or less recently. the streamer mentioned by OP is awful. She and her Friends are skilled Players, no doubt. But have you ever listened to the bullshit they are Talking all the time? She also states in her twitch description that she is deranking on Purpose. IMO she should get banned because I am Pretty sure I will when I derank on Purpose.
---
Looks like Bethesda and Behavior have settled their lawsuit ‘amicably’. I was hoping this lawsuit wasn’t going to have the effects of gimping DbD in any way (such as bankrupting BHVR) but with no details on the settlement, we have no idea. Your thoughts?
---
Thanks man. Not sure why it keeps happening. Been trying to trouble shoot it, but it's only during those offerings that my game locks up :/
---
I like this, this is neat. I think the isolation and insanity mechanics are a little unecessary overcomplicating the passive a little, and I think the active power could use a little more love. Very cool killer idea. I am curious as to what happens when he uses Insidious or Tinkerer tho.
---
I mean , in a game where you have two opposing parties there are always going to be winners and losers , eventually someone is going to get pissy. If she wants to play that way then fuck it , her choice , not that rank even matters anyways , up to the devs to fix the games flaws not the players.
---
Besides , being toxic brings views , you all gotta understand scot and jen do this shit for a living , whatever makes money. If you don't like it then don't give them publicity? Vote with your wallets? Idk feel like 90% of people who bitch about toxicity on reddit are toxic inconsiderate cucks themselves.
---
the flexing bug you get as a killer when a survivor dcs on your shoulder 
---
Devs have been adamant about not implementing voice chat of any kind, so far they seem to still follow this philosophy. 
---
The lack of information this brings along is precisely the intended effect, and is a big reason why SWF groups on comms can pose big problems: they feed each other valuable information they are not meant to have. 
---
Imperfect decision-making based on incomplete information is a big part of this game's formula, so I wouldn't expect changes anytime soon. In the long term who knows with these devs, they change tune whenever convenient.
---
It usually happens after dropping a pallet with me as killer and an animation is missing, is sped up or some other thing I can't understand. Like with Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, unrelenting.. Each one of those, when it happens, makes the survivor do the sliding for about 2 to 3 seconds.
---
"Kill the game"
---
Well the problem WOULD be solved, you right.
---
for this Post? absolutely?
---
Hit box is fine. Killers should be able to apply map pressure while being good in a chase. 
---
Nah, why would I?
---
Damn you sure are angry, maybe somebody destroyed your traps with a flashlight
---
Do gens bro
---
Nurses or not any killer that has a 32m terror radius gives away their location before nurses takes effect, and running nurses purely to find the last guy in the event he even needs to heal himself is a worse version of running whispers to find the last guy. Your fix doesn’t change the major issue that the hatch is extremely survivor sided. If anything you make it easier to escape through the hatch as a survivor. The killer needs to have control in the situation and not the one hoping the last guy runs into him. There needs to be more the killer can do than aimlessly wander around searching for the guy.
---
"Weeb chick" What part of exlusive dbd seems "weeby" to you like real talk and being a "chick" doesnt automatically fucking net you thousands of subs and followers. Of course that doesn't matter to you or anyone else here probably. Don't like their content? Dont fucking bring publicity to it , they do this shit for a living sorry you dont enjoy it.
---
Normally yeah but that was my friends first match ever and to encounter such a killer, who was running noed too is kinda disheartening for him
---
Even if you moonwalk they can position themselves accordingly to be able to react in time
---
Pharmacy gang rise up ☝🏻😤☝🏻
---
Dbd is a bug.
---
I dont play by made up rules
---
Just be unpredictable. I play survivor and killer equally. When you loop at twalls, you watch for the killers redstain. 
---
Run them through the inside instead of outside. Don't vault it, ever. 
---
✅memes when killers are memeing✅rarely leaves another survivor even when the gates are open and they're getting camped✅genuinely feels bad when killers dont get any hooks✅ must be the toxic jendenise
---
Zubat literally DCs every single Legion game.
---
Which I mean, you should, because its the most boring shit on the planet to go against.
---
People already do this so what difference does it make? Hatch standoffs have always been a thing because devs can't just fix the stupid mechanics of it. They've got their heads up too far up their asses. But don't worry, they'll come out with some miscommunication much like EA and it'll make everything ok. Pretty good job so far.
---
ITS NOT A PHASE KATE
---
Mindgames are key in T-walls for both sides. Vault one of the windows unexpectedly, moonwalk, or change direction when the survivor is not in your sight. If they are a problem you can also use Bamboozle
---
I mean from the video, you can blatantly hear her, but possibly yea.
---
Thanks for reading~
---
I had the power inputs swapped, but it got too confusing on how to "cancel" the dash, since you were holding the power to start, it would have been a "let go" to cancel but press M1 again to swing, which would could lead to input issues with lag or mouse boogles. The "shot" being on release made sense cause that's how you huck hatchets, the dash just made things confusing.
---
The second perk had a "recharge" if you hooked many survivors, but it seemed too annoying without locking it to 1 recharge. It's designed to give a lot of power right away, then nothing, compared to end game powers. It was also because in my head, it would be funny if you downed someone as Huntress with hatchets, and someone ran to body block and then just ate the basic swing and was like "OH GOD".
---
That's why I said "I" do it... I wasn't saying EVERYONE should do it... Y'all Reddit mfs really be mad annoying thinking everything is an argument against them
---
Thanks~
---
She's designed to be a simpler Huntress and Billy hybrid, while still having a higher level of play with map travel and ranged disruption. So good for newer player, and rewarding for higher skilled movement and shots.
---
That’s the joke yes
---
Sorry for this late answer. Everytime I join a lobby, the ping goes up to like 400ms but then drops to 40-60 and the game begins. It was the same this game. The lag started in game though.
---
Pretty cool idea actually
---
Trust me when I say 2k is not an impressive karma total
---
I was just telling you why I didnt give that Bill hatch, I wasnt arguing with you
---
If you have leatherface unlocked, he is the easiest killer to play in my opinion. 
---
Go to YouTube and just look up monto, he does builds of killers and survivors and he's fun to watch
---
So have I. Not at all saying the DC was valid because of those things but those things definitely helped toward to rather than just your skill. 
---
Bamboozle
---
It's more the time I've been on reddit as well as the karma  not just the karma that I'd consider as brag worthy
---
New perk BQQ and smoothie 
---
I think ghost face would be a cool addition
---
Force the survivor to the outside of the twalland Lwall, to they have a harder time fast vaulting 
---
I’m always so tempted to just body block them there for a while hahahah they kinda deserve it
---
Same. 
---
Agreed, unless your the one shitty survivor just d baging every where like your hot shit tbh I ll tunnel that motherfucker into the ground everytime idc if i depip,derank or lose the match fucking hate those Chad ass motherfucker s irritates the shit out of me everytime. So solution tunnel hook camp that mo fo.
---
Misspell detected: You accidentally wrote "everytime" instead of "every time". You fucking nazi.
---
"What they do to every other Killer" - being better by skill not killer design? doubt that. 
---
Yes, unless he’s trying to take the game hostage. I have play differently against him and I like that. 
---
Yeah thank you. She’s super fun to watch but the toxicness just gets too much. She literally calls every killer fucking lowlife trash etc and then tries to laugh or meme so people don’t think she’s being serious when in reality, we all know she means it. 
---
Same could be said about the speed of gens getting done or any other number of things that happen in the game. If I got half the team in the area of the hook I don’t have a reason to go hunting. If I have a certain obesession perk I’m gonna be encouraged to tunnel you and make sure you die. 
---
Thanks for everyone for their feedback! I have made a few changes now to The Ripper!

* Did a complete overhaul of The Ripper's power and renamed it.
---
* Reworked Reign of Terror.
---
* Got rid of his Perk Surgical Precision and replaced it with Opportunist.
---
There's a phone app that'll randomize builds for both killer and survivor for you and allow you to save builds you make, but I'm not sure that's what you're looking for.
---
When this happens when they're only 3 people ingame and another one dcs I stand next to the Gen and hit it some people realize what I want from them other just keeps running all game long xD
---
thanks for crediting 
---
I bet they probably abuse perks like Dead Hard too. 
---
So am I supposed to just stand around or walk towards the tunneling piece of shit that ended a chase or stopped literally anything he is/was doing just to come hit me again before I've healed? Just wondering. Most of the time I'm not going to just casually walk away because 9 out of 10 times the killer is a tunneling piece of shit. That other 1 out of 10 times I either can get healed right under the hook or walk away and heal myself.
---
So you see, my point here is, you should think about what you say before you say it because a lot of the time it's always situational. No one is just gonna walk away on the unhook because a lot of the people who play killer are shitty players to begin with.
---
Yesterday a pig tried to guide me into destroying her hex ruin. I thought he was tricking me into distroying hunted grounds so i ran away. Pig.. Thank you for farming with me after all that anyway. You are a great person. 
---
Idk it just doesn’t seem fair to me. It’s cool and all but even as a killer main I can’t bring myself to use it anymore. Plus you get less bloodpoints for doing a mori rather than killer by hook
---
Good job dude! 👌
---
There are plenty of survivor perks that come with their big bonus across all three tiers. Take literally any exhaustion perk ever, self care, DS, adrenaline, saboteur, urban evasion even (because seriously 90% at tier 1? Why not like 50/75/100?). The list goes on and on.
---
Yep, the exit gates weren't open very long and I didn't expect her to be there already.
---
lil baby nurse all grown up now
---
yeah that guy sucks
---
Dont chase clockwise
---
i just watched bird box last night.
---
The trailer made it look soo much better than it was, ugh.
---
Did they change this because I deranked from 1 to 15 recently ( for the event) 
---
I welcome all downvotes.
---
I wasn’t there for sabo-Meta, why was it so good?
---
Mhm , you should check my last dbd artwork then.
---
I have the same shit with BPS. I wanted to prestige my Dwight and every time I used a BPS my game froze
---
Thanks :)
---
Your karma score on ***THIS*** subreddit isn't high enough. It doesn't matter what your reddit total is. If it bothers you that much just make a meme. You'll have enough at the end of the day to post how ever often you want. 
---
Hooks were down.
---
But like, for good. They didn't respawn.
---
Lmao its none of that. If the team was in the area i could understand.
---
This is straight up just circling the hook of the first person you catch.
---
I've played 10 games tonight. 9 of them consisted of the killer just camping the first oerson they caught.
---
Its fucking garbage. It ruins the game completely. I cant even touch survivor on nights like these.
---
Good thing it doesn't affect your nose area i guess
---
Yeah the best you can do is just circle the outside of the tile and make them burn all their vaults and then resume chase. Any mindgame you try is more wasted time in most cases. Just play huntress lol /s
---
How long did it take?
---
Yeah, I know that now, but thanks
---
ewww , no 
---
And thanks , I'm glad you like them 
---
If you hate camping use BT, literally one of the best perk in the game. DS is a problem, and so is NOED. Both are crutch perks for bad players but since they are so good they get abused by better players.
---
“I feel that if you’re playing nurse you should give last survivor the hatch as an apology for playing nurse”
---
That, in fact, isn’t just your opinion but it’s your opinion that you mentioned in response to op, so your point of “oh that’s what I do had nothing to do with you” means two things: 
---
1. Miscommunication of your sentence
---
2. Backtracked real quick
---
Do you get why your whole “reddit Mfs be mad annoying” is very ignorant considering your situation?
---
Welp I’m glad I wasn’t there for that
---
Yeah so how useful would a whole killer power be in that case?
---
Ok, now you're playing into it by arguing even after I honed up to it
---
20 min game capping 32k vs 10 min game ( any killer without insta downs ) ending around 24-26k. ( before bonuses, bbq, etc )
---
Blood points per hour are more efficient on other killers that actually ends the game quicker without using insta downs.
---
For cosmetics: Yes
---
For characters: No
---
*the next line you are going to say is "eat this pallet!"*
---
**Eat this pallet!**
---
**NANI?!**
---
You could have the charge just impossible to cancel at full charge, like a nurse blink or hillbilly blink
---
I know that feeling all too well. About 3 months ago,after the rank reset,I never got past yellow ranks because I was getting tunneled/camped almost every game. 
---
Was Frankie before, it's now Susie
---
I get that but noed was already getting heavy play as it was so good so it just feels unfair that any killer can now get that effect from level one, previously it was good but barely seen, but now it’s every game and the fact that it is a powerful effect, even compared to ds it is far better in strength and ds gets much better with higher tiers encouraging getting higher levels, there is no incentive to get noed higher than one, when compared with self care it is similar but self care doesn’t give the survivors a free win like noed often does. I can see your point and I haven’t thought of it like that so thank you, I just hope you can see my side as well. This is probably the best argument in the defence of noed I have seen so thank you.
---
Lately I've started to see no real point to Decisive Strike, because each time I do happen to hit it, I get chased for 10 seconds and get downed again
---
a standard build that's really good for him ( i use it ) is:
---
Decordance ( 2 ppl on gen perk )
---
Monitor ( lower terror radius outside chase, bigger in chase )
---
Ruin ( obvious )
---
Stridor ( tracking perk, great for tracking people who don't heal / mending )
---
Well done!!
---
Cool idea, they were originally going to do the same thing with hooks, but killers complained that it took away a serious advantage of surprise so they stopped making killer hooks and now make map hooks instead.
---
A map wide deaf seem pretty useful since no survivor would know who should worry more compared to trip this trap and you're deaf with a adorable mud woman chasing you.
---
I never have that issue. A game here and there sure but 9 seems excessive 
---
Cool idea but on some it is a slight buff so the community might get pissy
---
Just instaheal it
---
It's reddit, what do you expect :(
---
Gotcha
---
Hit the gen multiple times while they are wiggling on your shoulder.
---
That way unless they're rank 20 they'll surely get it.
---
monitor is better than distressing in everyway.
---
the bonus points don't even matter since you're going to cap deviousness by default anyways. And monitor gives you the increased terror radius when it actually matters ( during chase ) and also helps you get the drop on survivors with a smaller terror radius when searching.
---
I KNOW I got absolutely dumpstered when I depip with legion lol.
---
The Coldwind map with the house is Thompson House. Rancid Abattoir is the one with the abattoir.
---
Tunneling, camping, and ebony moris are all those poor pitiful killers have to counter those toxic GEN RUSHERS !!!  Lmao. 
---
People complaining about this “unnamed streamer” in this thread are absolute snowflakes without two brain cells to rub together. 
---
Watch as their one condition is that Bethesda gets to make a DbD DLC
---
Nah they say they’re gonna fuck around and they do but that includes trolling and mocking killers to the point where they’ve ran them to the ground and then just possibly give them a pity hook.
---
Fookin Dead' ard mate!!!
---
I think map hooks make more sense, anyway. Like, the Doc's hooks would look completely out of place on Yamoka, for instance.
---
But that 4% speed buff is just so insanely overpowered, we don’t stand a chance against that kind of speed😂
---
Yah I get you, I will say tho that NOED 3 is def way better than NOED 1 for the S P E E D and in terms of NOED being more powerful than DS I propose this: There is one killer and 4 survivors. The killers perks are supposed to have a greater effect on the game than the survivors perks. There are also 4 survivors for a total of 16 perks. If we were to compare DS to NOED in terms of strength, we’d have to pit 4 DS against one NOED. I don’t know how much killer you’ve played all around but lemme tell you my man you ain’t been living the OG killer experience until you’ve sat yourself through the p3 squadette that bodyblocks so everyone can get a DS off. You leave a part of yourself behind in that match lol /s but not /s about 4 DS. That shit is the big A I D S
---
Yeah. I called out the irony of my statement. I had a balance change suggestion blow up so I've had idiots in my inbox and day arguing stupid shit. The Reddit disease must be contagious
---
The toxicity is strong on the survivor side. I have made it to red on both and I would say less than 10 percent of killers are toxic meanwhile a good 60 percent of survivors will be toxic in and out of game to both the killer and fellow survivors. I still let people escape if they weren't being overly aggressive all game which is rare.

r/thatshowmafiaworks
---
Yeah I guess. I just wish the trolling didn’t include so much shit talking against what appear to be inexperienced players. Just makes me feel bad for the killers which is not something I usually do.
---
I just had one where the killer kept downing me and letting the other guy heal me but not the other way around. Weird.
---
That last bit is them trying to use Dead Hard when you didnt even swing and they just smack themselves into a wall.
---
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME THAT EXISTS, BUT NOW ALL THE NAMES ARE GONE BECAUSE IT WAS TWO DAYS AGO!
---
Her main point is actually that in red ranks you constantly face the same killers and it gets boring for some people because they know what perks you run and how you play etc. and you know what they run and how they play.(which is true). 
---
You are playing in the Pale Rose ( 10304 m^2 ).
---
It is a squareish map so one side is ~101m.
---
You are near a wall, the hook is around the middle of the adjacent wall, so if the line between you and the hook were parallel to the wall, the distance would be 101÷2 = ~50m.
---
But because the line is oblique that adds a few more meters. So yeah. Defenetly more than 46 m, probably more than 50 m.
---
I don’t always wash my hands after I shit on Freddy the whole game
---
Yeah I do understand they say “well the killer played shitty” they kinda had to to stands. Chance of getting a kill 
---
He's gay, dude.
---
6 counters to BBQ:  
---
1) be close eonugh
---
2) be so far away that the killer will not come for you.
---
3) run in direction A, then change to direction B after 4 seconds
---
4) hide behind a gen. If you do it well for 4 seconds, there's a 90% chance that the killer will not know where you are.
---
5) lockers are now hiding your aura.
---
6) since BBQ comes in every single game, if it REALLY bothers you, you can just use Aura hiding perks like "Sole Survivor" or "Distortion" etc.
---
BBQ is fine tbh \^\^
---
The broken hitbox is recent, trying to 'fix' ghost saws. And his instadown is one of the most balanced and avoidable skills in the entire game. So yeah, barring technical issues, does sound like a great level of balance :)
---
Imagine thinking that flashlight macros can crash the game when that ability was removed months ago. Typical 4Head Reddit post 
---
heh heh nea's a killer
---
Imagine not being able to read. I said "used"
---
"HE DIDNT WANT TO LEAVE YOU A CHANCE, HUH?"
---
Looks like they AFKed on hatch. I'll do that if I don't feel like having a stand off but don't think the last person did enough to earn the hatch. The point is to force them to finish the gens and leave via the gates.
---
Have to be next to survivor jumping in hatch and push m1.
---
Maybe he had a daily to get chased as Tapp /shrug 
---
I get you with bitter murmur but rancor is a sweet insurance policy against obsession based perks. If you run bitter murmur or rancor and win the game before you can get much use out of it, then who cares? You won. If the game isn’t going your way you still have your insurance and get to punish them accordingly. But yeah rancor is sweet when I don’t feel like getting hit with DS. Imo it’s always a good idea to have an insurance perk in your loadout for any serious build. 
---
BBQ, Distressing, Thrill, and Beast of Prey.
---
Ran into a Huntress running that build and she farmed with us. Think she ended with like 80k.
---
There's the con for killers that they won't have straight up 0 ping. It'll be a difference because there's gonna be some complaining when people experience that.
---
It'll be worth it over all though.
---
If they are SWF why the multiple map offerings tho
---
Deathclaw killer when?
---
Maybe to guarantee a map they like. Killer map offerings are the same as one survivor map offering
---
I think the Doctor’s static may briefly confuse people into thinking they are playing against a Spirit, and vice versa.  Whether that is a positive or a negative is up to interpretation.  That said:
---
Wraith could have the sound of grinding and crushing metal that rises from light crinkle to a horrible screeching to reflect his past as a car crusher.
---
Leatherface could have his heartbeat accompanied by the sound of boiling water, rising from a light bubbling to a rolling boil, to represent his affinity for home cooking.
---
Nurse could have the sound of coughing and choking be her heartbeat, with the coughs growing more wrenching and desperate as she gets closer.
---
mOm gET tHe CaMErA. 
---
“Whoever’s map it is gets 10 dollars”
---
Spirit Fury is probably the biggest *Confused Screaming* perk in the game and god it feels so satisfying to omae wa wo shindeiru some cocky Survivor who's teabagging behind a pallet.
---
I need to get it on my Clown...
---
I got the game 4 days ago. I’m like rank 15 lol
---
Ｄｅａｄ　ｂｙ　Ｄａｙｌｉｇｈｔ　シ佳い
---
Diversion. Nothing is better than Diversion
---
Lightweight :^)
---
If they camp do gens and leave them with a pathetic 1k. You can even get the save and get him a 0k. He may DC tho.
---
To quote the greatest character in all of anime, random soviet guard #17  from Season 2 Episode 12 of **Archer**, “What an asshole!”
---
Just make them all the USSR anthem that will go from whisper to earrape
---
I feel like monitor and abuse could be good? I have literally only ever played pig once so idk if it would be or not
---
Gotta hit my highest before rank reset
---
Lmfao, did you get two of them to DC?
---
I'm not saying you should let them escape but at least play the game, it's not like you can't get the survivor before they get the hatch, it's the simple fact of not playing at all anymore when on top of it that Just seems scummy to me, I mean he could've just as easily smacked him without getting off that hatch. 
---
similar, but just the normal standing position
---
Completely agree, and it's pretty annoying solely due to the hypocrisy of it. They get mad when NOED or ruin but then bully low rank killers and think it's not toxic. like wtf
---
Probably they just gambled for the sake of it by putting 3 map offerings or individually put their favourite maps.
---
Absolute stab fest
---
First of all, I wouldn't recommend running NOED as you shouldn't assume you're getting to end-game. Ever.
---
As for the build, I play pig as I do with every typical "M1" killer: BBQ&amp;Chili, Enduring, Hex: Ruin and Spirit Fury(You can replace Spirit Fury with Whispers as it is pretty good for Pig)
---
I hate rank 15. Survivors are potatos but killers start understanding the game. At least in rank 20 the killer is also a potato. Purple/green ranks is where its at. I will never get close tonred ranks again.
---
I mean, in that case why is she deranking all the way down to 10? There's plenty of people in the player pool between ranks 1-10 to make the justification that "she doesn't want to play against the same 3-6 people at high ranks every game" invalid. Especially as we're getting later into the season, there's definitely more than 3-6 people at high ranks at this point in the season. Also, other streamers deal with it, AngryPug does longer streams at high ranks and gets plenty of variety, so this excuse falls flat in concept and practice.
---
I want to see it on
---
Except it's not 60k if I don't get that last hook, is it? Or I could get a coordinated 4-man SWF who cheat their way to a hookless escape, or a 4-man SWF who dives the hook and dies in 60 seconds, or my game could just not load the next match, or it could be a 3v1 or a 2v1, or I could get a bunch of DCs.
---
"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
---
*Super fun "looking in the ground" abuse with legion*
---
Excuse me, the sacrifice is not being able to see survivors in any direction and probably using a perk slot on Blood Hound. Seems more like something that's overlooked, but not at all "abuse"
---
It’s a lot more fun than you’d expect, always welcome to whip out on a swf
---
I'm never getting close to rank 1 again. I'm very comfortable in my rank 8-10. Good luck tho.
---
I feel like im the only one horrified by her face
---
Yep, both of them DCed before their death hooks. Felt so satisfying when i saw their build on post game. Although they most likely did it to preserve their items. Since if you pull the plug or alt f4, you don't lose your items. Still, high levels of NaCl probably helped too lol.
---
Same. Been stuck at the same spot rank/pip wide all night.
---
You either get camped and lose 1, or someone else gets camped which makes it hard to gain a pip. Its just garbage gameplay and i dont see how people can enjoy it.
---
They all have NOED too to back them up. That and decisive both need to go.
---
That’s why I question if the survivor team are actually playin in a way to encourage camping. For example I get called a camper cuz I have 2 survivors on hooks within ten feet of each other and only have 3 gens left that are all within eye shot and one way off in the distance. If I can see the survivors are not a threat to my gens then I have zero reason to leave the area. I’m literally protecting the entire map cuz they chose to do gens in a way that the only ones remaining are all next to each other
---
Who won?
---
i understand what you mean and yes he will be a weak killer since no chase ability.  But i prefer to come up with new ideas rather than just one type, just for some inspiration (although i very highly doubt BHVR really takes the ideas and suggestions from these posts)
---
Eh doesnt help. I went in for the unhook earlier because i wanted the points for the pip. I got hit unhooking then downed and facecmaped.
---
BT isnt effective because then someone else gets camped. The old BT would have helped but obviously survivors abused the shit out of that so now its gone. This is the problem with this game, everything gets abused to no end.
---
It's not about the points. It's about the freebie escape for no work. I've had Claudette's hide I the corner never touching a gen or making a save, just waiting for the hatch. No. If you want to leave, do something.
---
Coldwind offering, it was the rancid abattoir. My favourite coldwind map too.
---
Lucky you...I played noed for the 8% attack cooldown buff but survivors had to complain AGAIN like they always do and now it’s gone. This world truly is a cruel place.
---
Don't try to reason with these people. It won't change anything anyway.
---
Then who’s the level 60 godfather?
---
How do you properly derank yourself? For future reference XD
---
Yeah, i just wanted to point it out. Still a cool idea and you clearly put effort into it. I really like the perks
---
Nah B, NOED players be sweaty af
---
Yeah. Usually at mid ranks these guys try to copy the “oMg yOu’Re ToXiC” builds and streamers they watch, because they’re tired of getting their ass kicked when they were low rank where killers dominate. 
---
Exactly!  I feel they do gens 100x faster when they are all solo and hide everywhere.  I prefer chasing than to playing hide n seek 
---
I just find it weird I don't observe other streamers going against the same 2-3 people every game. Its probably something to do with the fact that they dont complain about it nonstop, but its also probably because those numbers are *highly* exaggerated.
---
Yep, for sure.
---
The edgy names are through the roof
---
"Sorry this isn't related to DBD, we'll have to take it down."
---
-This Subreddit
---
Voicecom gives survivors every single aura reading perk in the game for free
---
That's usually how games work.
---
They always think they are good when i play nice and teabag and send mails. Thats why i just hook them all and spin circles while they hang and write ragemails
---
&lt;rank 10 is bitter murmur
---
I mean I played Tribes on dial-up and never had ping that high...
---
I am pretty sure these guys are getting their asses kicked on mid ranks too lol. They weren't so bright in the game even with this build, got me a sweet 31k points(+ bbq and bp offering). They need to d/c more and get to rank 15 to actually try and bully killers lol.
---
That brutal strength
---
That’s not how mafia works
---
Well I usually go in with some friends but even when in don't I've yet to experience survivors like. That in turn then would be indeed a good argument. Maybe make individual survivors have to do something to get access to a hatch? Like have a certain amount of points or something before it opens for you?
---
because it seems most people play in pairs, so if your lobby only need 1 player you can wait for ages but as soon as you have two open slots bam insta filled
---
literally me today, i switched from ps4 to pc and in my first killer game had 2 dc's within seconds so decided to farm...i tried my best lol
---
Would I get banned if I posted a selfie of my frog
---
Ha! When it comes to hatches, I never get caught! That bill was dumb in trying to jump in immediately when he knew it was a nurse.
---
1. Was bill added to PC before legacy was given away?
---
2. I don't think the mystery boxes looked like that, I think they did this look for last Christmas (the most recent one), because my first winter solstice (the one with the new achievements) each box had three own rarity
---
Maybe the killer has the ability to close the hatch, and if the survivor completes a gen, the hatch reopens permanently. Theirs gives both sides the chance to get what they’re after 
---
How does it work then? 
---
Dunno?
---
Today I learned Claudette has a penis. 
---
I had this happen to me the other day when I was playing Spirit except it was the textures on the generators that didn't load. They were all just plain white.
---
Oh, you mean tunnelled?
---
I like the new nea cosmetic but her wig is shit and shows her bald head every time she turns around quickly. 
---
i think the easier (but not best) way to fix this will be once you reach for example red rank you cant leave red ranks ever until rank reset where you will go to a purple rank based on what rank you were and you cant derank from purple only move inside purple and go back to red if you still got it. Apply the same to purples so they have to wait for a rank reset to go back to green ranks. Does it prevent people from red going back to greens and bully newbies? no, but it will take them 2 months of basically not playing for reach that point
---
Now, that sounds pretty good! 
---
David's new Punk jeans and his rowdy pants are a buggy mess with shirtless. How is this bug in the game for so many months when we are even forced to pay aureric cells for some of these cosmetics?
---
Yup, we all 3 restart the app if things like that happen, and then resend invites from SWF. Something is fucked with the matchmaking, so everytime we see the killer DCed, we get looped in waiting for a lobby, get a disconnect from the host during a match, etc, we close the app and launch it back. 
---
This was our only work around to play it together and works for us, we play it for hours.
---
Uhhhh, no it doesn't. Aura reading perks give you aura reading. Just simply having comms allows you to have a general idea of where the killer and the other survs are.
---
