MOOOMM ITS NOT THAT VIOLENT
---
---
---
No, its just a problem Freddy has and survivors abuse stuff like that with him. Hopefully the devs will fix it when they buff him.
---
I think it‚Äôs in February. It started February last year. 
---
Probably something like sloppy butcher, deerstalker, knockout, and nurse's calling. Or third seal instead of knockout, but that's harder to pull off. 
---
There were quite a few of those
---
Damn who gave him my red bull 
---
Damn, you hit the salt lottery
---
Lmao, you forgot the /s.
---
:(
---
Contact behavior and they can check logs (or whatever the process is idk) and they‚Äôll give you back your stuff. Or at least they should. 
---
I just bought this game. It's fun, but I keep losing my most powerful offerings on endless loading screens. From what I can tell, people were hoping this issue would get fixed in January of 2018.
---

---
Now I feel the despair of my survivors.

The thrill of being hunted comes from evading a merciless killer.
---
***This*** is the quality content I come here to see
---
I'm a level 10-12 trapper with about 100 hours on killer.  I play pretty hard unless I see that I have the advantage and I'm going to 4k.  At that point I'm happy to let people do their thing; as long as daddy has his BBQ, he's happy.  Try that sometime - I think it's appreciated.  
---
  
---
A 4-man SWF flashlight clicky group?  Well that's why I bring deerstalker, you pieces of shit.
---
I hope that person is trolling.
---
Thanks for the reply, it's still shitty that I have to do this, when there should be a proper saving system in the first place. Where should I contact them?
---
To be fair, one of the first reasons I played Killer was for the fun of being merciless. 
---
If you press the home button while pressing another button the game sustains that action.For example of you‚Äôre searching a box and press home while holding R1,you‚Äôll find that when you leave the home menu the box has been fully searched 
---
I play on mine with multiple family members playing and some are paranoid about hackers so it's always on private even though I really do want to message people GG ¬Ø\_(o_o)_/¬Ø 
---
Yeah even when I lose as long as the killer was fun I would like to send GG.
---
I try not to facecamp because I want to spread the positivity so hopefully they do it too. I also don‚Äôt care about pipping because in the end it just gets you lower rank where it gets actually cancerous. I‚Äôm about rank 3 rn and it‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôve gotten threats and been called the rudest names possible. One guy threatened to Dox me. 
---
Cute. 
---
After a while I stopped caring. 
---
Honestly the only reason I play SWF is because I wanna have fun with my friends. I don‚Äôt even fuck around with the killer because I want them to have fun too. I mostly mess with my friends like sandbagging them and t-bagging their corpses. I‚Äôm a great teammate btw. 
---
The absolutely only reason I would facecamp is if they wanted to ruin the game for others, they farm their teammates, or overall shitty things in general. If you‚Äôre gonna ruin the game for your teammates, allow me to introduce myself. Let‚Äôs play hard ball together. 
---
Lunar New Year isn't til February 5th so probably won't start til next week
---
Imagine playing killer and getting looped for 5 gens. You finally down the guy because he ran out of pallets or smth, and then you cant even bring him to a hook because he can just wiggle wiggle wiggle.
---
Lmao, you forgot your /brain.
---
Lunar new year is in February so we gotta wait till then
---
Their website should have their info. I‚Äôm not entirely sure as I have never had to file a ticket but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs on their website
---
I didn't, but you did.
---

Dude just play Flee The Facility on Roblox
---
That's because of the 4v1 statistic. 3x more likely to meet a jerk if you're playing killer than you are playing survivor.
---
Check out some streamers if you have the time. Not all of them explain what theyre doing, but you can at least see if they do smth different from you. 
---
Im sry =(
---
Clearly you did, you don‚Äôt understand the fundamentals of this game yet you come in here and start spewing trash like the creator of this post. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre as stupid as he is. The game is balanced you just suck at this game overall get over it 
---
I had the same thing happen last night except I was the meg lol
---
Damn it, and I just got a bunch of days off. :(
---
Now that's a masterpiece right there
---
Small game? Detectives hunch you mean. Or just use both like I do. I like situational perksü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
None because the maps are too small and SWF with mics hard counters it. Sad but true. 
---
Clearly, I didn't. I'm not gonna get into it with somebody who clearly doesn't see how strong survivors can be, and forgets important game mechanics like perks. If anyone doesn't understand the fundamentals of this game, it's you. Stop assuming negative shit about people you don't know just because you don't like what they're saying.
---
Entity, facts are facts
---
Nope.
---
A quick, cheeky teabag is fine especially if they're trying to pull my attention away from a chase.
---
The only time I really don't like it is when a survivor combines it with hostage taking or specifically signals they're at the exit gate by fast vaulting so that I come over only to see them furiously teabagging before they run to safety.
---
Strikes me as immature and being a poor winner.
---
P.S. if you're running Object of Obsession simply to teabag from a distance then you had better know how to win a chase. Cos I find that shit really funny when I stride over and immediately down you.
---
I've gone against a lot of Pigs using Knock Out in combination with that addon for the RBTs that causes blindness.
---
It's absolutely diabolical since if you're downed and blind you can't even attempt to crawl towards people to get you back up. It makes for some intense games sometimes.
---
But in general Third Seal and Knock Out on any killer would probably work too, I've just personally encountered more pigs doing it.
---
Something something inches something something size doesn‚Äôt matter something something aristocrats 
---
You're saying that in term of strength. Huntresses one shot is pretty much a guaranteed dc and I just feel any item that makes the survivors in the game not want to play at all shouldn't be in the game which is pretty reasonable.
---
It's fine, don't worry. It just annoys me a little bit, but in the future if necessary try to edit the pings out, that would make this clip 3x more enjoyable!
---
Every inch matters to a man 
---
I‚Äôm so confused why they didn‚Äôt remove your decisive strike post then ?
---
That makes a lot more sense. Thanks!
---
Many a time have I needed BT for that last unhook when the exit gate is open and we want the killer to get no kills. Even a facecamping killer can't counterplay that. We'll Make It is extremely weak, especially if you get a good team that rarely gives the killer hooks. BT I can see being useful in more games than WMI, since WMI would pretty much only be good solo or in a swf when you know you and your teammates aren't too good at looping.
---
That offering slot better be for the game map
---
[removed]
---
Pls explain. Totems take 15 seconds to do, not including finding them. DS usually just gets you a short extra life.
---
You say it's difficult to stock up and you'll loose them but I've got over 100 ultra rares from the Christmas boxed alone. If each game goes for 20 minutes that is over 33 hours of overpowered items.
---
I mean yeah the lore was weak but they had something really cool going there. 
---
When I say his power sucks I also mean that in the context of while not very strong it is also obnoxious to play against. In general he's just not a fun time and feels like a loose attempt at coming up with a concept that could sell cosmetics. 
---
Apparently you don‚Äôt know the ‚Äúfundamentals‚Äù so let‚Äôs use your logic and bring it forward shall we? Let‚Äôs give the killers hex ruin,balanced landing and sprint burst, along with adrenaline. And let‚Äôs make it so the killers can cancel out all generator progress? But let‚Äôs remove tool boxes and med kits from survivors so they can‚Äôt get generators done or heal themselves because they are so over powered with their pallets and flash lights.. 
---
I feel the pain. My guess is on the 30th since it's a Wednesday which would suck since that's when I go back to work too
---
Atleast on PS4 you can not allow anyone to message you if they are not a friend. People will still try to send you a friend request with sit talking in the message as that‚Äôs all they can do but it‚Äôs really annoying for them to have to do so it‚Äôs very rare that that‚Äôs gonna happen. Usually if they see only friends can message you they more then likely will just move on.
---
Oh no
---
My tip for a pig main? Switch over to being a doc main :D
---
It honestly works on every map, and I don‚Äôt want survivors to DCüòÇüòÇ
---
Plus, seeing them flee my tier3 Myers from 50m away is where the chuckles lie my friend.
---
and there you are.. bitching on reddit. LMFAO
---
I take in brown add ons for regular games, but my daily includes a Mori and purple add ons. 
---
"slowing down your progress with any perk imaginable"
---
Exact words from my first rebuttal to you, so I clearly know about the "fundamentals".
---
Guess you forgot your /eyes too.. 
---
Hahaha, funny joke. I said "asymmetrical in the favor of the 1 in the 1v4". I said nothing about any of that stuff. Poor try.
---
my mom after me telling her that this game is my only reason to live
---
More insults, yikes.
---
I got my own BP tyvm
---
Uhhh its caught on shadowplay =/ n trimmed with photo sooooo yeaaaaaaa
---
I hate when someone brings up that noed is a problem and then there's the obligatory "DECISIVE STRIKE IS BAD TOO" like ok dude I agree but that isn't the topic
---
Poor try? You just had no comeback, you got your cheeks clapped and you don‚Äôt know how to respond just take your L and run home. Go back to playing your underpowered killer and maybe get good at the game so it may eventually be more balanced in your eyes. You literally are using the same trashy excuses like the original poster you got your ass beat but survivors and are in here crying about it 
---
Nothing to say, yikes.
---
No gens, chests contains bomb parts to open the door.
---
He will strike later. He will always return
---
Nah, I didn't get my cheeks clapped (what kind of an insult is that, anyway?). I just had some douchebag assume a ton of shit about me and put a fuck ton of words I never said in my mouth, though.
---
You can't even read what I just wrote, double yikes.
---
Don't forget that the mirror add-on lets you have wallhack in a vast radius. You are never not able to find someone on Lery's!

I was the killer

On PC? I get during regular work week hours but at night or weekend it‚Äôs always instant for me.

---
Try survivors pudding...10 times in one night ffs.
---
You mean the actual weapons or the killers' powers?
---
Yeah, but I think nurse is way easier to fix and should be fixed. My opinion is to make nurse get no chain blinks without addons. one chain blink with a very rare addon, two with an ultra rare. No stacking on extra blink addons. Reduce the lunge range to a tier 1 myers lunge too. Now you actually have to aim your blinks.

I'm on console (Xbox One), waiting times can take up to 10-20 minutes. Especially at higher ranks. 
---
I got to killer rank 13 on console and got reset back to rank 16.
---
Show me how I‚Äôve tried to make myself bigger? You have no proof of anything. I‚Äôd reinforce my point against, you said survivors are overpowered I countered that point with how you want the game balanced. You tried saying survivors have perks that speed stuff up which they do. But killers have perks that slow it down or stop progress all together. So I think you have the shoe on the wrong foot, you are trying to make yourself seem dominant with your non existent points that I literally eradicated in seconds of you making your ‚Äúpoint‚Äù and now all you have for a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù is trying and failing to attack me directly. Which as you and I can both see isn‚Äôt working as you‚Äôve lost this battle by steering away from your original point and only going for insults 
---
Gameplay from No0b3, thought it would make a nice Gif.
---
So you‚Äôre assuming it will come from Dead by Daylight‚Äôs budget? Are you that clueless?
---
This. Ever since the exhaustion changes, I've been using dh and bl. It's not really as bad as people think.
---
D...did you mean 4x more likely
---
Let‚Äôs make the surprise perk that is so effective BECAUSE of it‚Äôs hidden aspect known by all survivors at the start of the match, essentially removing 90% of its value. Sounds like a great idea
---
It always was and always will be. 
---
Who you calling pinhead?
---
That‚Äôs definitely false because I was like 12 and stopped playing for a reset got back on, got bored stopped playing for a reset and last time I got on a reset I was rank 16 maybe even 17. Or maybe my memory is bad but idts 
---
You‚Äôve clearly thought about it and I‚Äôll personally a fan of the changes you propose, might need a little fine tuning for balance of course but yeh... I like it :) 
---
I was rank 14 earlier today in a game against a rank 20
---
Cursed
---
1. Trapper
---
2. Billy/Bubba (they have the same relative size and weapons) 
---
3. Huntress
---
4. Meyers 
---
5. Doctor (it‚Äôs literally just a pointy stick)
---
6. Frank and the other dude 
---
7. Julie and Susie 
---
8. Clown (fat old guy with a pocket knife)
---
9. Pig (having your blade attached to your arm would just be a pain in the ass)
---
10. Hag/Freddy (weird claw weapons on scrawny little shits) 
---
11. Wraith (skinny boi with a weird weapon that looks useless)
---
12. Nurse (because saws require you to, you know, stand there and saw at something)
---
13. Spirit ( I mean if we‚Äôre disregarding magic/entity fuckery her arm would just fall off soooo) 
---
Trapper is definelty at the top if you disregard powers because he‚Äôs huge and the only killer with an actual weapon in his size class. 
---
Billy/Bubba and huntress could probably be switched since she has more useful weapons but they look a lot more built.
---
Pretty much anyone below doctor is just tiny as fuck, has a weapon that would be marginally more useful than your bare hands, or just wouldn‚Äôt function without the entity. 
---
To expand a bit on that: the horse was blind and when they went into the Entity's realm it got badly burnt. I guess the Entity doesn't like harming animals (I mean it has all those crows after all) so it gave Maurice a third eye so he could see.
---
That being said, tell me again how the game should favor the 1 instead of the 4 if they both have perks that can counteract each other? Mind you, one has weapons while the other has flashlights. Your entire point, the original one, is completely invalid.
---
I was probably one of the killers you encountered. Was playing as Huntress, my ID started with a S.
---
The amount of BP for each side needs to be fine tuned so everyone is getting the proper amount. But I don't know what the average amount of BP is for Survivors without WGLFE or offerings.
---
This entire conversation is proof, lmfao. I never said anything about survivors being OP, that's YOUR words. I merely insinuated how this game isn't balanced like it's being sold to be. And again with you assuming crap and putting words in my mouth. *Again*. You didn't eradicate anything, but phrases like that and putting me down are yet even more ways you're trying to make yourself seem bigger than you are. And I'm not attacking you either. Sorry that someone proving you wrong and cutting down all your points seems like it's an attack. 
---
Please, please show me one time in this entire thread where I insulted you that wasn't just me making a point about an insult you used against me. Just one. You can't find one because it isn't there. Keep on lying and saying I've insulted you to try to shift pity onto you. It's not working. 
---
What did they expect? Lol
---
I hate that she's the face of toxic survivors when every character I've faced as killer has been shitty to me, especially Bill and Nea. I feel like this is more a player thing than a character thing. Neas are the friggen devil.
---
Sharp objects are worse than guns? I can‚Äôt speak for anyone else but I‚Äôd take my chances against a person with a kitchen knife if given the choice between than and a gun.
---
The Hag looks like a Metal Gear 5 boss in this
---
It's not. Last time I checked, the killer has to be on top of survivors to use their weapon. Survivors have a ton of tools at their disposal, that you're clearly forgetting about: DS, sabo, Unbreakable, Adrenaline, insta-heals, bodyblocking, actually being decent at looping, etc.. This entire conversation seems like a misjudgment on your part.
---
Did he get downed I cant tell from the gif.
---
Honestly at that point it‚Äôs funny cuz you know they just wasted 2 minutes for you to reply ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù and then you get to see them waste another 5 minutes explaining why you‚Äôre garbage
---
okay but that's the actual expression I make 
---
What I'm trying to say is... where is the 5th gg?
---
From my games without WGLFE you end up with between 16-20k if you die or 20-25k if you escape. Currently a lot easier to get BP on killer. Maybe have BP from saves shared between the surv team somehow, like if you distract killer or are nearby or distract, because taking a hit for a hook save or distraction is only 200 BP which is minuscule to the rescue BP 
---
You didn‚Äôt attack me? You called me a douchbag at one point, and yes you did say the survivors were op you said the 1 should be dominant not the 4. Ergo the survivors are the dominant op force. And I as I recall I never insulted you I just called you out on your bullshit excuses to cover your mistakes if saying this game isn‚Äôt balanced when it clearly is you just Must be losing matches as killer or just getting SWF matches and getting beat by a group of FRIENDS which is the point of SWF so it‚Äôs not unbalanced, they are all just better then you or were in that instance in that game. 
---
It's like he missed the slogan "Death Is Not An Escape."
---
To be fair before you know how to loop survivor feels like hide and seek where you die as soon as you get found, and free weekend happened pretty close to rank reset. 
---
\*Marge voice\* I just think they're neat.
---
Doesn't Identity V play like this? Only you're placed on a rocket instead. I could be wrong
---
(Don't give them any ideas)
---
I'm shocked it took em 10 hours to figure it out.
---
Because I wrecked u
---
Timer is too short, not enough time to find a gen that is adequately done to warrant a PGTW, and even if you do find a gen that you could use it on there's probably people you could just chase rather than kick the gen. 
---
Why is there Nea wearing these clothes always the one who is toxic?
---
You wrecked me? Have you even read your post, you deleted it because you got your ass clapped and didn‚Äôt want the world to knowüòÇ
---
I like to just say ‚Äúgg ;)‚Äù for whatever reason that always makes them wayyyy more angry, it‚Äôs amusing to me.
---
Every means of getting BP in game would be used, and probably boosted a bit for Survivors. If that's the amount people get then they should be getting good ratings.
---
The Hag! She benefits from it because most good survivors will pop her traps once she picks someone up. Plus if you slug someone and they start popping your traps, you and teleport over to them and punish them.
---
You have 30 seconds to get to a gen. If you are running bbq, you will most likely go in the direction of a survivor, and most likely want to confirm a new chase asap. 
---
If theres a working gen on your way, great. Otherwise you are not really accomplishing much. Ends up being pretty underwhelming. 
---
Why does Michael's hand look so fucked up? It looks like something out of Half Life
---
I've wanted this game since it was free on xbox for a weekend like 6 months ago. Got an email that its 10 bucks on steam.... couldn't resist
---
Even if I have no friends that have it I've loved every minute of it
---
On both killer and survivor sides, by far the most typically toxic player has been Quentin. It seems like there's never a Quentin that doesn't play like a pile of steaming ass.
---
I honestly watched people play this game on Twitch more than I played it. 
---
Saying one should be dominant isn't the same thing as "OP". Another assumption on your part. 
---
And no insults? Please. You've insulted me nearly every damn response, saying shit like you'll win matches with underpowered killers and I don't (like you JUST did AGAIN, by saying I must lose against SWF), I've "lost" this argument, the damn cheeks thing, and on and on. You haven't disproven anything I've said, merely exposed how you've assumed a horrifically wrong assumption and blown this whole thing out of proportion. 
---
Also lmao, either you clearly don't get why everyone's mad at SWF or that's a very poor attempt at distraction from the real issue.
---
Yeh that right, emphasis on BP in the unranked game mode might actually help remove toxicity, but who knows 
---
Dunno what it is about 13, it just doesn't seem fun after several plays. 
---
Isn't there a chest spawn cap?
---
It came with Clown, so yeah.
---
I fell in love with it on the free weekend!  Bought it within the day!  I don't get how people can drop such intense reviews on such a nuanced, complex game based on a weekend of game play.  It's clearly something you need to learn and adapt to, and that's what makes it amazing
---
yes
---
I‚Äôve never noticed the third eye
---
It‚Äôs very entertaining to watch. There‚Äôs a sense of tension and adrenaline that makes it feel like you‚Äôre watching a horror movie 
---
It feels almost repetitive after a while
---
Dude stop trying to bolster yourself up, well then prove me your point of why the killer should be ‚Äúdominant‚Äù and btw saying your cheeks got clapped when it did happen isn‚Äôt an insult at that point. But either way you lost this battle ages ago and now all you are trying to do is get bonus points for yourself and make yourself look better in front of people and trying to get approval since you mustn‚Äôt have gotten that ever in your life. So now either tell me about your point or take your virgos jar of clapped cheeks and find the hatch because that‚Äôs your only escape out now.
---
Okay new player here. Is cleansing totems a good thing to do? Should I always do it when I see one ? And what in the world does the map do?
---
While Dead by Daylight's superior in every way possible, Friday is more fun. I'll elaborate here, when I lose games as Jason or even a councilor, I'm chilled. I have had matches that gave me fond memories to this day but Dead by Daylight while an enjoyable game does not give me this experience. I am getting grey hairs. I mean it's just a game and losing happens but playing Killer feels like such a gruesome chore. Playing as survivor on the other hand is thrilling and is really fun. I don't particularly care if I live or die as I am pushed to be more competitive when I'm killer.   
---
Disclaimer: That doesn't mean Dead by Daylight is bad and I still prefer it to Friday the 13th: The Game. Nor was this a killer vs survivor post. 
---
It‚Äôs timer is way too short. It‚Äôs way too situational as well, whereas a perk like Overcharge works on every gen at all times. 
---
I have dealt with my fair share of Quentins that were toxic and they're usually slippery fucks too. lol
---
I wish I had a recording of the time I went to unhook another survivor and accidentally ran right into her back as she was crouched in the grass. Luckily she didn't notice me and I made a hasty retreat! 
---
May I ask what other projects are keep BHVR afloat moneywise?
---
thank you!!! :)
---
If you're running Scratched Mirror, I would swap out Hex: Haunted Ground for Iron Maiden. Once they figure out you're running the Mirror, that's how they'll try to hide from your eyes... and that's how they'll die!
---
i cant think
---
I have about 200 hours in the game and took several great tips away from this.  Thanks!!
---
Lol. I can understand that comment in the context of camping, because camping can outright lose you the game 50% of the time by default, but for hatch? 
---
You already know this guy is a liberal
---
I‚Äôm LIVING for your name
---
Saw one with 20 minutes played saying first impressions are everything and it was complicated and not fair for survivors I dont need any more time to tell this game is terrible....
---
20 minutes is not even enough time to finish the tutorial lmao
---
I wish I played against killers that were this bad.
---
Also happened to me 
---
*Ladies and Gentlemen.. I‚Äôm gonna blow up the city.*
---
I like to use Lithe And Balanced Landing together, It opens up many more options for running/looping, and makes drops much safer!
---
I can understand that. I agree with your point about playing the Killer. I‚Äôve had matches where I‚Äôm practically sweating because I‚Äôm running around the map trying to keep with all that‚Äôs going on. Generator explosion on one side of the map, Someone getting saved off a hook on the other side. It starts to get kinda annoying. Like you, I‚Äôm not trying to make this Survivor Vs Killer, but I understand how you feel
---
I'm a free weekend player and absolutely loved it. Gets the heart pumping. Learn to play smart use the cover and 3rd person aspect its such a good time for 10 bucks honestly even full price at 20 CAD that's an absolute steal for the replay value
---
If they were playing killer it‚Äôs no so shocking that they didn‚Äôt hit anyone 
---
&gt;When Laurie remembers Michael‚Äôs into incest.
---
When Squadettes stop and teabag around me, I teabag as well then we all do it together.((I main the Pig, mind you)) Even though I teabag like a Grandma, I feel cool, hip, and privileged to be one of them. Silliness aside I don't think anyone should be bullied for their choice of killer. I don't think Legion players play Legion to be malicious and their design is the fault of the developers, not the player. Even I like their character designs and stuff. 
---
I'm not "bolster" myself up, but you are. And nice attempt at trying to use my own phrasing against me. Not gonna work. Plus, by your own logic, merely saying "my cheeks got clapped" doesn't mean it happened. You don't get to say you won and have that be it. 
---
Why should the killer be dominant? Let me count the ways: this game is meant to be an asymmetrical 1v4 game (as said on the right of this very subreddit) with the 1 being the power role. The 4 should be weaker individually but use their numbers to balance it out. The Steam store page mirrors this through its phrasing in the game description: " one player takes on the role of the **savage** Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to *escape* the Killer and *avoid being caught and killed*." This is reflective of game balancing as a whole. The 1 is powerful but alone, and the four are weak individually, but find strength through their numbers and teamwork. 
---
Also, nice attempt at an out on the whole SWF issue. I must have been right about that, as well, since you offered no rebuttal. Please, keep insulting me to try to make it seem like you've won, it's kind of pathetic at this point.
---
I've been saying my points. All you've said is the equivalent of "you're not right because I say you aren't." You sure the hatch isn't the only escape for *you*? 
---
I cant tell. Are you against no0b3 and glad he went down? I am just confused at the point of this at the moment.
---
Legion honestly is the best concept in the game next to The Clown and the Spirit. They're different in a way that doesn't scream "generic scary guy" they are a concept that could actually exist in our world. That being said, I wish they were a larger group like a cult so you could unlock more characters.   
---
If nothing else, Joey and Julie are awesome.
---
Rank 18 killer here. I have been above that rank before, but due to not playing killer much I have dropped again.
---
You right
---
it‚Äôs just who i am hunty
---
Pipping used to be based on bloodpoints before
---
Now it's based on emblems.
---
I don't remember exactly how many of each emblem you need to pip, but in order to Double pip you need to get 4 iridescents emblems(doing fine on all 4 categories)
---
It's the collision of a survivor/killer. Hitboxes in this game are especially notorious.
---
"The Pussy Destroyer" -Ochido
---
Okay thank you. Makes more sense. 
---
True enough! But less so my words and more people who think 1 min of looping makes them good.  If they had there way killers would spend all match in the basement or something and leave them alone to skillcheck simulator. But you are right.
---
This game isn't balanced, killers require survivors to make a lot of mistakes to down a survivor.  And survivors have a lot of perks and addons to give them second (and third ect) chances.  The whole idea of complaining that a killer spent a lot of time to down them is just a plea to 'go chase someone else who makes more mistakes then me'
---
What do you do if all the survivors are good at looping?  You lose.
---
Personally I say don't swap targets.  Tunnel that sob down and learn the tricks they use to loop so you can punish mediocre loopers faster.  You'll still never catch loopers that are truly good but being better at chases will help you hit rank 1, while switching to chase derpy loopers just makes you good at catching derps.
---
3 iridescents and one gold for double pip. Maybe even a little less. 
---
Yeah but thats more or less to deal with apples strict guidelines for their store. Im sure if it was a google only game it have a bit more violence in it as google tends to not really give a damn as long as you describe it right and place it in the right places as for apple they have become something that they mocked back in the 80s and 90s
---
I'm all for getting those kills, but who is so sweaty that they need to have a hatch standoff?!  You killed THREE of them.  Don't be so fucking greedy.
---
Maybe Empathy? That way, you can get close to the chased person quicker and secure your saves. Otherwise, I like what you got. (: 
---
I have nothing against no0b3 i just was watching one of his videos and thought it would make a nice gif brought it here to reddit.
---
The timer is too short, and it's really only good on highly mobile killers (because, you know, obviously Nurse and Billy needed that buff /s). Slower killers need PGTW, but they can't always make it over to a gen that could use PGTW. Either there's not always a gen that has a significant amount of progress on it nearby after a hook, or the killer might not have enough time to get all the way across the map to a gen that has such progress on it after a hook before the timer goes out. And that's if the killer even knows where a gen that's been worked on is in the first place.
---
You might say based on the Day 1 problems, that F13 was...
---
DEAD BY DAYLIGHT!
---
I really like Spirit Fury and Rancor
---
Im only sure about the 4iridescent = double pip for sure
---
Dropped the game for a while now, you kind of forget stuff
---
the beginning of a beautiful chain
---
But therein lies the problem. If the only advice a killer can get against a good looper is "don't chase them", that seems inherently flawed to me, whether it be via a simple map design or the killer's power itself. A survivor shouldn't have that kind of power, ever. 
---
And wiggle DS.
---
no this would make survivors complain
---
It would be nice if hooking have you tokens you could use at any time, otherwise it‚Äôs only really viable as a defensive perk...and I personally don‚Äôt like playing defensively.
---
Well atleast it isn't the gsh-18
---
I prefer Wraith, it just feels very unsatisfying to get people with Legion.  With wraith you can walk ahead of people and bodyblock the pallet before you uncloak, if they stay there then you get a hit, if not then you don't have to deal with that loop.  Mostly though ya gotta brute force some stuff as Wraith, and know when to abandon chases to keep gen pressure. 
---
Those whiffs at the start, I feel your pain. Fuck the FPS on console, especially on Doc.
---
This is hard, sense i main both
---
I had one guy that would just spam my screen with gg, fag, jew and other stuff until I finished with a 4k, I tried to report him but I don't think it does anything 
---
I like how your only comebacks are things I‚Äôve slapped you with. What SWF issue? That you must have gotten your ass beat by them and that‚Äôs why they are dominant? How does that make sense? You literally said how the game is balanced and now are saying it isn‚Äôt? How are you this illogical? The killer is as you said savage but alone. But apparently because the survivors are a TEAM and meant to work together that makes them dominant? Like what? So as survivors we aren‚Äôt supposed to do anything to win? I don‚Äôt see where you have any points. What are the survivors supposed to do? Leave someone on the hook if they get caught? Apparently so cuz how I see it your bleeding out on the ground and you can see the hatch but your team died because you left them all on hooks GG bud. 
---
Play Flee the facility or Identity V
---
Remember kids, don't chase them until they glow like a highlighter. 
---
Also, healing someone while you're still in the dreamworld? Oof.
---
Three Iridescents and one Silver or two Iri's and two Gold.
---
Yes. "What you feel is wrong" is clearly the superior stance. Fucking fake-outrage bullshit. as a pansexual dude who has no problem with any of it, it's still obvious that some people are going to be freaked out, and you acting like this is a moral issue is fucking nonsense. Pick a cause that actually has some validity. 
---
Fun fact: Before the rocket chairs they were gallows
---
I'd pick legion bc at least you can make a (sloppy butcher, thanaphobia, nurses calling, and stridor/deerstalker) build preatty consistently if you get multiple hits with the ability but wraith dosent even have a good build 
---
lol best part is that Star Trek was actually all about that, it was about inclusion and equality and literally sjws couldn‚Äôt ruin it because it‚Äôs already supposed to be that haha 
---
What perks would you recommend for wraith ?I get looped in circles for days and it‚Äôs really hard to deal with . I‚Äôll break pallets but then when it comes to loops like the bus on wreckers where they can keep going through same window or T wall is frustrating 
---
I didn't read the title ¬¨¬¨ let's just say freddy pulled me into a dream yesterday 
---
I would hope so. There's always going to be toxicity here, but if people aren't worried about their pips and seeing their rank get ruined because of a bad play by their teammate or by themselves, then it would reduce the likelihood of dying or failing to kill someone being so upsetting.
---
Didn't that game died? The third one
---
it would be, if the hatchet's hitboxes weren't shit
---
How do you play legion ? I have ruin 3 , thanato 3, bloodhound 3 and BBQ 3 and I get barely any kills 
---
That thing is a peashooter 
---
I've only heard of 1 &amp; 2
---
Do u play on console? 
---
RuN bamboozle on wraith if ur having trouble on t walls and vaults 
---
I drop what I'm doing and rush to the downed person as soon as they go down, and I usually get the save, so unless I feel MEGA altruistic and bring a flashlight, I don't think I would need Empathy. ~~plus I don't have the teachable from claudette yet~~
---
My point of view is as follows: As a survivor, a quick 2-squat teabag at the exit gate is my way of saying ‚Äúgg‚Äù in case the killer exits post game chat quickly and I can‚Äôt say it. As a killer: if you‚Äôre looping me, then drop a pallet and spam teabag on the other side of it, you‚Äôre being unsportsmanlike. It‚Äôs the need to gloat and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you.‚Äù It‚Äôs rude for the sake of making someone else try to feel bad/get in their heads. As a killer, if that happens to me I either hunt that person down without remorse, or completely ignore them because they‚Äôre normally the type of people that are excellent loopers. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
You don‚Äôt use ruin ? I‚Äôm about not to anymore since gets cleanses so damn fast . I use thana 3, bloodhound 3, BBQ 3 and ruin 3 now 
---
Holy shit that Billy should be a DBD APPROVED watermark or something from now on
---
If ibdo something like this my build would be we'll make it botany knowledge and any other 2 perks 
---
It's not my only comeback if you don't get back on the issue until I bring it up for you. Nice try, though.
---
SWF commonly uses voice comms. In a game that was expressly designed to be used without voice comms, designed around the fact that survivors aren't supposed to be able to communicate, that's a huge problem. 
---
Again, with your assumptions. My point was that this game is a 1v4, you're saying "dominance" means OP. That's on you, dude. The survivors are meant to gain their strength through numbers, but that doesn't mean they should be able to 1-up the killer just through numbers and teamwork alone. 
---
"So as survivors we aren‚Äôt supposed to do anything to win?" "What are the survivors supposed to do? Leave someone on the hook if they get caught?" No wonder you're having trouble finding my points, with all that stuffing of words in my mouth that you're doing. I don't let my teammates die, but thanks for YET ANOTHER assumption and insult. GG, indeed. 
---
You the one who got destroyed
---
Rancor + Borrowed Time save with powered gates = 28 deep wounds
---
Yes I play on Xbox 
---
Oh and i have two builds, bbq, thanto, ruin, and a perk of your choice
---
And the other is bbq, ruin, blood hound, and stbfl
---
What about Aftercare? Since you are Altruistic, you are going to be touching most of the team. It will give you alot of map awareness giving you better positioning on who is going down next.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Think I'm just gonna block you now, cause honestly it's like talking to the equivalent of a stupidly stubborn brick wall. I'm tired of having words stuffed into my mouth and insults spewed at me, too. Try not to do that next time you get into an argument.
---
I am? How come my posts are still here but you deleted yours
---
Thanks! I am glad they are all unlockable. I prefer to play survivor, so that is good!
---
I have that on him but only tier 1and still doesn‚Äôt help . Any other perks good for him ?
---
The timer needs to be removed. Make it token based. For each hook gain a token, up to x amount of tokens, tokens are consumed when smashing the gen. 
---
The timer alone makes the perk a bit annoying because if I see someone then I'm initiating a chase, won't even get to use the perk. 
---
Who the hell cares? The guy isn't into it because of the violence, that should be your only take away from it. Why waste the time and energy fixating about someone else's opinion of a game?
---
Hmm i can give u tips and tricks if u want
---
Hm, gotcha. I'll definitely take some time for that tomorrow. I am guessing there is a wiki with them somewhere.
---
Ah I see. Your title says though and I couldnt tell if it was supposed to be though or thought which would change the sentence drastically lol.
---
Definetly the best map for it, the windows can be a pain but people always try to hide and you can give them a paddlin‚Äô
---
Not sure how it happened but the static image kind of made me think of a personalized result screen based on who you used. In this case it was the Pig. 
---
No sorry I barley play killer try to get teir 3 u need that 8 seconds 
---
I thought the game was poorly balanced when i first started playing. I was having a hell of a time but the reviews and player count made me think there was something to the game.
---
Fast forward a couple months and a few rank ones later I'm still finding new nuances every game. Huge but constant learning curve but an incredible game.
---
I mean I think it's a fair review. If they dislike violence then of course they won't like the game. Idk what the big deal is, just go play the game yourselves and have fun.
---
Yeah, it won't take much searching. 
---
Finally you accepted the L. Like I said you left the team on the hooks because you think this game is a free for all. Which it‚Äôs not as steam states it‚Äôs a 1v4, but it‚Äôs all good man you win some you lose some, but in your case apparently you lose them all. On DBD and on the reddit. So as I said GG you kinda tried I‚Äôll give you that much. But if anything you maybe safety Piped but that‚Äôs barely because you relied on steam to save you.
---
My maths need work :/
---
DEFINITELY Aftercare. It's already one of my favorite perks in the game, and knowing that (once I get it to tier III) I'll be seeing everyone in the game, that'll improve it much more than Deliverance ever would. 
---
I wouldn't even say slowly. It absolutely got massacred so quickly because of the incompetent devs. 
---
I use it every game. Even on low mobility killers I find I never have trouble getting to an opportune gen in time. It buys way more time in a match than ruin. I find it you get a good hold on the game, it really keeps you in control and continues to pay off all match. Nothing more satisfying than kicking the same gen 3 times with it and having them make no progress in a match.
---
All the people saying "the timer is too short" either haven't played with it much, or are just parroting what they heard someone else say.
---
That‚Äôs okay! I was just like... wait
---
(to be fair, I‚Äôm not exactly stellar at math either!)
---
That bad huh?
---
I ain't delete nothing mods removed it because I wrecked u so bad
---
The fact that they downloaded a 17+ game with the word ‚Äúdead‚Äù in the title and then played 10 hours just to write a negative review because it didn‚Äôt fit their preferences is such an asshole move.
---
Excellent pun sir üëèüèª
---
The emblem system is what's used for piping. Each level (bronze, silver,gold, and iridescent) has a value of 1 point (bronze is 1, silver is 2, etc) and you need 6-8 points to safety pip, 9-13 to go up one, and 14-16 points to double pip.
---
The old system just used blood points from the 4 categories. Objective, survival, altruistic, and boldness.
---
Copy pasting response I gave to someone else
---
&gt;The fact that they downloaded a 17+ game with the word ‚Äúdead‚Äù in the title and then played 10 hours just to write a negative review because it didn‚Äôt fit their preferences is such an asshole move.
---
Yeah. I loved that game. Each "patch" broke something new, promises that weren't kept...they did a lot to fuck up that game, and they succeeded. 
---
I think at the start they truly wanted to make a fun game but they got way in over their heads and just said "fuck it". 
---
Ao3 is probably a better platform 
---
I'll buy you brunch after one gen but you can't drop any good pallets if you get chased.
---
Would thano and sloppy be good combo ?
---
K ill have a yt vid by Either tonight or tmrw
---
Your concern is a noteworthy one: would a change like this be too difficult for new survivors? Or would it be picked up as "how it is", and instead be more difficult for *veteran players* to learn?
---
Yes
---
Okay and what does NOED stand for?  And how would I know if the totem isnt worth cleansing? I've only had the game 1 day but I'm absolutely loving it. But theres just a surprising alot of things to learn (that's not a bad thing by any means)
---
Ok cool thank you 
---
Np
---
I think the entire point behind adding more stuff to do is to slow down progress as a whole, so there would be no compensation given at all. If not generators, then there should be more to do in order to power the doors. I'm not sure what else could be put in to power them, though. Just something in addition to the generators.
---
How do you bring "politics" onto r/deadbydaylight? You're a fucking idiot.
---
You don‚Äôt like blood hound ?
---
I dont understand what the hate on claudette is all about. can someone explain for me?
---
I think they should add a gas mechanic to the game but I also think that maybe there should be more to the end game cause it‚Äôs just find the exit and leave. Maybe add a number key system to unlock the exit or something. Or even an unlocking mini game (Spoiler for red dead 2) like during the bank heist in valentine. Maybe there should be a number combination that the survivors have to look for or just try to get with very little help except for a sound queue. I feel like that would add a new element to the game and it would make it much harder and interesting. 
---
It‚Äôs not the game bro,or the devs.It‚Äôs the entity that brings about all these glitches and bugs.
---
Hatch standoff I'm guessing?
---
r/woosh
---
No not really the scratchmarks are just as good for me 
---
How about if you had the entity appear when repairing a generator? Like at a random time the entity could "take" a generator, and you have 5 seconds to stop repairing it before it traps you to the generator. Once you're trapped you have to struggle like you're on the hook and the killer gets a notification. It would last for like 10 seconds (whether you move away before it traps you or you get trapped).
---
Or instead of a timer you just make it spring a tremendously difficult skill check like overcharge when it takes the gen, and if you fail you get trapped.
---
This is like reverse surveillance 
---
Here is where we may differ on opinion. Your idea describes slowing match progress, but my question specifically relates to the difficulty Survivors encounter. While that may lend itself to slowing down the match, I'm not very focused on that particular aspect currently. Your ideas are good so far though!
---
Where? What's the joke?
---
I‚Äôm just saying it doesn‚Äôt make sense to write a negative review about a game that‚Äôs violent and 17+ just because you don‚Äôt like violence. 
---
Your example doesn‚Äôt apply at all to this because the game isn‚Äôt about rape or abortion. Dead by daylight never pretends to be anything other than what it is. The violence isn‚Äôt hidden under other layers of the game.
---
Ok so BBQ, thano, sloppy and what else would you say would be great with that combo 
---
Ruin
---
I'm not sure. Hopefully they do. 
---
Your game, your choice. For me however, unless they get 2+ disconnects or are actively being farmed by teammates I do not play nice.
---
Agree to disagree. You don't seem to be listening tbh but I digress.
---
The memories that hide in dark crevices of my mind reawaken
---
yeah for a full thirty minutes
---
Eh , ruin gets cleansed too fast for me 
---
You take the l
---
This is an interesting take on the idea behind powering the gates, and might make the landscape a little more interesting. Should it be something the Entity does by itself, or should it be a perk/ability that a Killer can use?
---
I am listening but I don‚Äôt think it really apples here. Anyways it was nice to be able to discuss this. Have a good weekend
---
It's another perk that looks good on paper but in reality it's kind of crap. The problem is that (1) unless you use Billy/Nurse there might not be a nearby gen to kick before the ability depletes and (2) even if you kick a gen that was pretty far along (say 50%) that only sets back the Survivors by about 20 seconds. That's it. 
---
So, Behavior could go ahead with their change to the perk they mentioned once or twice where the perk is token-based rather than having a timer. It still wouldn't make much of a difference because leaving a hook completely to regress a gen by 20 seconds isn't worth it in the long run. If Weasel regressed a gen by 50% and was token-based then it would be worth it and we wouldn't need Ruin anymore. But then Survivors would endlessly bitch about it until Behavior undid the changes.
---
You can't win. 
---
I once had it spawn right in front of the exit gate right where the 3 remaining were waiting 
---
Maybe an April fools one we‚Äôre Dwight Reskin as locker trapper is nea cladutette is grass etc
---
how did the pig not hear her
---
Monitor maybe
---
So with the additions to the survivor side, are we doing anything to killer? Can they still camp and tunnel?
---
Didn't you choose to watch the standoff though? You're spectating someone else :/
---
Downvote because no myers in background
---
What about monitor and abuse on him ?
---
I seriously don't understand survivors who stay in the trial when they don't have to.
---
If the gates are open and no one is hooked or injured I'll leave immediately. I get going back in to help another team mate and I also get healing at the exit gate. Lone Survivors searching for the hatch is annoying but again, understandable. However just standing at the gate waiting for the killer to show and then running out is a complete waste of time.
---
The code idea sounds like it would be pretty complicated and a little unfair if none of the Survivors have come across it. If this were a much slower-paced game, I could see it making sense though.
---
I'm interested in this gas mechanic and how it might relate to the endgame. What do you mean by it?
---
Simple, it's your fault too.  Now don't get me wrong they suck and I've had my fair share, but you stood their as well.  So solution?  Go to the nearest gen, either they follow and hit you then you go to the hatch (usually works), or they stay and you get the gens done
---
Ditto, have a good one
---
These days you can‚Äôt tell 
---
sfw should've said that
---
That would make for an interesting april fools prank. Would the nea be stretched to fit trappers normal size for the animations? 
---
His idea does more then slows match progress it literally makes it one sided if a killer starts with his weapon and everything and survivors have to ‚Äúsearch‚Äù for stuff. All the killer has to do it start slugging them and it‚Äôs GG 
---
I am ignoring the Killer's gameplay for now, since I don't play Killer enough to know the stress and struggles they go through. I'm focusing on Survivor gameplay in this question, since I think we can all agree that most of us rarely, if ever, fail skillchecks nowadays. Did you have any input on Survivors' difficulty?
---
Make another post so you can get another L
---
I've seen a ton of 10 hour negative reviews of survivors complaining that the killer is overpowered
---
I had a game with invis pallets
---
Monitor and abuse really dosent work with his ability, it actually wouldn't be a good or a bad thing since you want to slug multiple survivors 
---
Yeah but you still didn't have to watch. And your friend didn't have to be stubborn either.
---
true but we had all the gens done in the proximity of the hatch done my friend would've rather not have risked it (we're really trying to hit rank 1 again this season)
---
Then, did he get it?
---
Rank also deems skill to an extend. The matchmaking would match Survivors to Killers based on their rank, with some leniency. Rank 10s would be matched up with ranks 11s, 10s, and 9s but should rarely be matched up with anyone rank 12 and lower or rank 8 and above unless it was SWFs whose team rank average equals the rank of the Killer.
---
Posts like this make me so happy 
---
I perfer post game chat than being harased in my messages
---
Additional difficulty is not necessarily a penalization, as long as it's handled well. And I'm aware you didn't say it takes skill, but that's also what I'm trying to discuss, even though you seem to think I'm trying to malign Survivors and their difficulty. But I have to tell you: I am a Survivor main, and my job isn't even a quarter as difficult as the Killer's job, and it really should be, if you think about it. That's why I'm trying to have this discussion.
---
Oh and what do I do about constant T looping ?
---
It can be harder then the killers if your killer is actually good at the game and vice versa for the killer if the survivors are good. Which I agree with you completely on 
---
How do you play legion like do you find one person and try to get multiple stabs then stop yourself and down one ? He is so slow in regular chase 
---
*uh actually this laurie is taken from halloween 1 so you're wrong mfriend*   
---
 *^(/s)*
---
Make it something the entity does to enjoy itself. So maybe if a survivor is above level 14 in a lobby then it'll have a chance of happening, and the chance increases as the length of the game increases.
---
That‚Äôs true, it definitely wouldn‚Äôt be fair to the survivors but I would like to see more to the end game stuff on the survivors end. The gas mechanic I was thinking About was either that there needs to be gas to fuel the gens (since that‚Äôs usually how they work in real life) or maybe you need to fuel the exit gates or something. The gas could be found on certain parts of the map and each gen needs a certain amount and there could even be perks or equipment to carry more gas or something along those lines.  I feel like the gas would be of a gen thing then a end game mechanic, but there could be like a certain amount of gas to fuel like a gen that is connected to the exit gates and you have to pour enough in there to open it. This probably seems like a mess since I just thought of it lol. 
---
That's a lotta damage
---
I don't think moris, any kind, should be used as a band-aid to help lower-tiered killers. They need buffs, plain and simple.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be against something added to both sides is all I‚Äôm saying. My response was to the reply that survivors should need to do more, which alone I totally disgree with. If you want to make skill checks a little harder, I guess that‚Äôs fine. But i think there should be a non teachable perk added that all beginners can have access to starting out to help them out with a larger zone or something.
---
Right. That's what I'm getting at too: the variance in skill levels is evident in the gameplay, but pretty much everyone is "good" at the objective that requires the least actual skill. I'd like to be challenged a bit more on gens, personally, and like I said in my post, if the needle starts in a different place almost every time, that's less time I have to scope out my surroundings and more of a chance I might mess up the gen, making it slightly harder for me!
---
There's a difference between you disliking something and it being bad. That rape or abortion scene could just be needlessly shoved in for shock value which would make it bad, but if it's handled well and serves a purpose in the story then you dislike it but it isn't bad.
---
Please just let me throw these hatchets at you. I promise I'll let you all escape after that.
---
Please please I just need to hit four of you. :(
---
The only problem with posts like this are they are from people that have been playing the game for a while. I don‚Äôt know if you guys forgot how your first matches went but I know I was horrible and got hooked left and right. I know I was scared shitless my first 5-10 matches whenever I saw the killer and ran and hid or got caught so, but Increasing the difficulty even slightly may throw the game off majorly. Especially around rank resets
---
So.... what story does violence serve in DBD?
---
Thats when you add them, apologize but you dont add shitty players, and block. 
---
No one escapes death.
---
Basically, if a totem is glowing then it's a hex totem and you definitely want to cleanse it.
---
If it's not glowing then it's not doing anything except giving you some points when you cleanse it.
---
I know what you mean though, there's a lot to wrap your head around. I'd recommend watching Monto on youtube, he's a great player that does lots of different builds and he always explains what each of the perks and items he's using do at the start of each video. It helped me learn everything a lot quicker when I started playing a couple of months ago.
---
This was addressed by someone else earlier, and I have to say that I think new Survivors would be more inclined to accept this kind of thing as "just how it is", and will learn it well to begin with. The real trouble, I personally think, will come from us veterans who might be taken by surprise!
---
That's been happening a lot to me. 
---
Stop thinking of just for you. Look at it from a beginner or new players perspective 
---
i hurt someone named Matt's feelings
---
Off the top of my head:
---
Maybe secondary objectives, Survivors make more noise, no pallets, no scratch marks, no red glow, no terror radius, no perks, just add-ons and maybe items (except Instant Heal), and definitely no SWF. Basically a hard core mode. But like I said, Survivors would avoid it like the plague. You could give them a million BP for playing this mode win or lose and the majority of them would still avoid it.
---
As killer, I usually let the last person go in a standoff situation, unless they were toxic (teabagging all game, etc.) As survivor, I will usually stake out the hatch area before running up to it. If I see the killer is camping it and appears to have to intention of leaving, I‚Äôll do what the other commenter said and go 99 done gens. They usually panic and don‚Äôt know what to do at that point, leaving either the doors or the hatch unattended. 
---
Standoffs aren‚Äôt worth it. Nobody is earning any points for just hanging around staring at each other. I really try to avoid the situation. 
---
God damn it...
---
8 survivors; 1 killer; 5 gens to finish. The survivor with the lowest score is killed every time a generator is completed down to 2 survivors.
---
Noed is such a waste of perk slot that its a meme. At best its a huge crutch that gets survivors killed because they're dumb and at worst it is simply waste because it only comes active after exit gates are powered. There are so many more useful perks.
---
Sounds meh for solo survivor and annoying when going against swf groups. Although most groups don‚Äôt coordinate builds beyond items unless it‚Äôs for memes 
---
Probably, given the amount of things that get taken away. Getting found by the killer would be a death sentence and there wouldn't even be a way to know if they are near you besides if you actually see them.
---
Being a better killer increase the difficulty for survivors. 
---
There's no other way of saying it but sadly the case is always the killer lacks time management, focus and the ability to process multiple things at once while ignoring distractions and they dont have the ability to juggle different objectives as well as efficient pathing and efficient knowleged of maps and how to run loops and jungle gyms. Killing isn't the only objective a killer has. It's the main one but not the only one.
---
Meanwhile in Black ops 4 limbs are torn off torsos by gernades. 
---
Oh for sure, I definitely agree with that. 
---
I don't know if the game will be able to handle that
---
Exactly
---
Which at rank resets that will be rampant 
---
glad to see new people.
---
I use Myers with knockout because you tier up with EW III and down who is in front of you then run around and find someone else, your kill should be there when you get back and if they do heal them you can repoet and stab the healthiest survivor.
---
Technician is pretty underrated, the main part isn't the skill checks, it's that repairing generators is *8 metes quieter*. Many people have told stories about Killers wondering why they couldn't kick the gen, only to go over to the other side and see a sneaky Claudette.  
---
Detective's Hunch could get a really simple buff (along with Dark Sense) by making it so any generator completed, period, activates the effect, instead of you having to get on the generator and be there until 100% completion.
---
The hex break sound is coolest noise in the game
---
#OMEGALUL 
---
That's how mafia works. 
---
Survivors have to slowly and loudly moan and rub the parts together to make a shamble of a bomb.
---
Stalin got it right, but he forgot the good ol' fashioned jigsaw puzzle piece.
---
I love when they tea-bag and they all get hooked &lt;3 
---
I had that game with 3 survivor friends + one random claudette. All the survivor friends tried to spam me with their flashlights, teabag and trying to do 360‚Äôs only to all end up being dead on hook and I let the Claudette escape through the hatch. I think it becomes personal and a challenge ? But no it doesn‚Äôt offend me. Personally I teabag other survivors to say hi and killers who face camp
---
Sure! But please credit me @Romanthicca on Instagram! Thanks :) 
---
Well that‚Äôs exactly why I said both sides need to be addressed, not just one. 
---
Well the pig is a normal sized woman with impaired vision. She‚Äôs much less terrifying than some of the truly inhuman monsters or huge killers in this game. 
---
Steepest learning curves? Ok..
---
This free weekend combined with a rank reset around a week ago; I think seems like a recipe for negative reviews. 
---
Daily / Sporadic killers like myself end up Rank 15 but have every meta perk maxed and are familiar enough with the game to exploit excessive 'headless chicken' behavior the new players display.
---
I just finished a game with 14 /15 / 16 / 20. No chance at all.
---
It would be bold to presume that they played the tutorial before complaining that the game is confusing.
---
Just curious, what do you mean by his tonics making you nauseous? As in the visual effect of the tonic being a purple cloud makes you sick irl? How does that work? üòÇ
---
There was a great video recently uploaded by a very good killer player that demonstrates how to handle those walls, and some other common loops.
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
After the Wraith rework a few months ago, most of his add-ons are solid now.  My favorite ones are Swift Hunt + Windstorm.  The Coxcombed Clapper + The Ghost makes for a completely silent bell + no terror radius after uncloak for really good surprise attacks, which can be fun.  You can achieve a similar thing with Bone Clapper + The Ghost. Shadow Dance is also good for dealing with pallets/loops. 
---
They tried something like that in a PTB a while back and it got removed because survivors abused it by running the killer around the hook or something like that so it never went in. Tunneling however can be prevented by not making bad hook saves, and if the killers camping then honestly just don‚Äôt go for the save unless you have BT and they‚Äôre about to hit the next phase bc otherwise you‚Äôre just wasting time.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see that...tho I did see a terrible nurse with one(new player so didn‚Äôt have the teleport down at all!) and gave me a mini-heart attack when I opened the gate and she was just floating there head banging like no tomorrow.
---
This is why I change my name to Just Doing Daily
---
Yeah I had one just stand infront of me the entire time. I just thought "well that's lame" but thats a tactic and I totally get that. But that makes alot more sense I thought I would get some hate for my awful timing on fixing the generator and healing people lol
---
no
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt mean jack, Freddy is objectively terrible.
---
2.4 hours spent trying to finish a survivor game against a 3 gen doc
---
No, it's memes.
---
The sequel continues...
---
Amen!
---
Was just about to say this. Game itself is actually really good.
---
You might notice a bit if you make mistakes as a survivor, especially if it's just after rank reset when you're playing with people that are a lot more experienced than you. I've only seen it a few times though, most of the ire is definitely heaped on the killers.
---
Sorry to comment on a old post. But is there anyway you can do the pink background (ultra rare background) for the perks?
---
I mean, that‚Äôs not a lie?
---
Survivors have been beefed repeatedly and killers have been bugged repeatedly. That is a fact. 
---
It was an effort to achieve game balance, but they were still buffs and nerfs. 
---
I love the ''alert'' perk. I enjoy knowing where the killer is.
---
SWF makes Knock Out useless.
---
It is in a terrible kind of way(Developers are fine with it). I don‚Äôt like it, I don‚Äôt accept it, and I certainly don‚Äôt do it when I play LF but it‚Äôs kind of the whole point of the perk/build. Finish those generators, get as many blood points as you can, and escape. It sucks but that‚Äôs the only counter you just have to have one die for the greater good.
---
Its doing no harm at all.
---
So you don‚Äôt have an answer to the question?
---
Without context, yes. These survivors were a pain in the ass with teabagging, flashlights, and being up my ass when I was carrying someone. Thought I‚Äôd show how toxic I can be.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA170WQsL9c
---
- Self-care in PtB was a test to see what they want to try and how we would react 
---
- Prove Thyself is trash and needed a major buff
---
-Scratch marks and sounds are bugged, not nerfed.
---
- A lot of the maps are fair now, and many more are killer sided now than ever before. Pallets are sparse mostly and can only be used properly if the survivor knows how to judge distances and the probable risks of hits through pallets 
---
Not anymore. The level of delusion is way too fucking much. You fucking morons are beyond hope
---
What makes this review even funnier is that the white house actually made a video recently trying to link video games to violence and some DbD gameplay was featured.
---
Incompetent casuals being forced into an asymmetrical PvP game. Did you expect anything less?
---
Flashlights are part of the game 
---
Teabagging does nothing to harm you besides your ego 
---
And bodyblocking to help someone wiggle out isn‚Äôt BM or anything toxic. 
---
You just wasted 4 minutes for yourself and some one else, andddd for what?
---
I think this is only really PS4 I have honestly no issues on XB1
---
I love going to Crotus and just nodding at Maurice when I can. 
---
"Timed Out Near A Nightlight" is fuckin' hilarious. Thanks for making me laugh &lt;3
---
I'd take my chances against any of the killers than have to do any form of public speaking.
---
Enduring is the best counter to all stuns except wiggles.
---
I understand some of the reviews; the games pretty buggy, compared to other games it‚Äôs pretty bad. I know studio scale comes into it but people expect more in 2019.
---
It was huntress gameplay right?
---
I want it I want it I want it I want it I want it I want it I want it so bad
---
Same with me, though once I did have someone go out of their way to message me just to say I was doing pretty good with her despite being new and that I just needed practice, and they then gave me tips. That felt really nice, considering the rest of their team went out of their way to be obnoxious :‚Äô)
---
How about improving your skills so that you don't have to rely on such crutch perks? 
---
Nurse&gt;Spirit&gt;Billy&gt;Huntress&gt;Legion&gt;Clown&gt;Myers&gt;Hag&gt;Pig&gt;Doctor&gt;Wraith&gt;Leatherface&gt;Trapper&gt;Freddy
---
Honestly this game is not scary in the slighest once you get into it because you just think about it all mechanically and think of them as other players and trying to guess what they‚Äôre going to do rather than a scary ass monster. I‚Äôve definitely been startled when I pop a corner and didn‚Äôt realize I got double backed and then getting sliced 
---
to be petty
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd mostly emphasize that you should consider 3 man your victory condition and the fourth kill to just be an extra little bonus.  Sure, you can slug the third and go for a 4 man or even just get lucky and find the fourth before they know where the hatch is, but 90% of the time against good survivors one will get the hatch and that‚Äôs fine.
---
When I was playing today I had a particularly bad game as Myers. All survivors escaped and I was pretty down about it. I got messaged by one of the survivors and he gave me advice and added me as a friend in case I ever wanted someone to play with. That made the match way better and I was pretty happy in the end.
---
Could be fun
---
1. Billy/bubba chainsaw would tear your back open and probably severe your spinal cord
---
2. Trapper the guys a tank and he carries a machete he would fuck you up differently 
---
3. Huntress because of the size of her axe 
---
4. Myers classic kitchen knife  never failed at killing and it probably won‚Äôt bend/break if it hits bone
---
5. Spirit because that thing would leave exit wounds in you (she pushes it in your stomach and it comes out your back) but it may snap idk much about katanas 
---
6. Legion believe me his/her knife will leave your intestines hanging out or puncture your lung but I‚Äôm pretty sure Myers knife is bigger 
---
7. Pig quick 5/6 stabs in your chest leave you on the floor gasping for air in a pool of blood but knife on your arm is a bit weird 
---
8. Wraith that would be like smashing someone‚Äôs head in with a brick 
---
9. Freddy I feel like pushing it in someone would be difficult 
---
10.  Clown because I think that knife could do serious damage but it also might just about puncture them because of the size 
---
11. Nurse because a saw I feel like would only sometimes cut them and even then It wouldn‚Äôt be deep
---
12. Hag my sister clawed me a lot when we were kids so I think I could handle hag 
---
13. Doctor idk if that would even make you bleed but the shock wouldn‚Äôt be fun 
---
That game has infinite‚Äôs tho üòÇ
---
If you break chase often (even when you‚Äôre still in a chase) you get quite a lot.
---
Got the totem worth!
---
I like the way you think
---
offend me? no. do i feel satisfaction when they die? oh yeah
---
I think they did a pretty good job so far, maybe you should just play Civ V for a while instead, it's a really good game.
---
&gt; Prove Thyself is trash and needed a major buff
---
Interesting because a bunch of ~genius~ survivor mains are complaining that trash killers and mechanics being fixed is unfair to them
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
&gt; and many more are killer sided now than ever before.
---
There's that good old fucking delusion you people are seeped in
---
&gt; Pallets are sparse mostly
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
there are not pallet towns anymore, but mostly sparse? come on
---
if you're that broken I don't think I can help you
---
&gt; Not anymore. The level of delusion is way too fucking much. You fucking morons are beyond hope
---
Not anymore. The level of delusion is way too fucking much. You fuckers are beyond hope
---
Of course it does. It's not an aura perk. 
---
Yeah you‚Äôre definitely a little kid or something üòÇ
---
It builds up the frustration in you. After you miss your swings, after you get pallet stunned, after you play like an idiot, if you get teabagged it pisses me off beyond a limit 
---
&gt; I always thought this subreddit leaned killer.
---
fucking lol you poor thing
---
&gt; This is the only DBD community I've been near where I've seen people unironically say nurse isn't op
---
There was a huge post about removing her but okay lmfao good god
---
I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
---
When in doubt, spread em out
---
The issue that I have with t-bagging is the arrogance. Don't taunt me and then get mad when I kill you, I don't need to face camp you for you to die and you should really humble yourself. The only thing that warrants a face camp from me is if a survivor lag switches at that point I don't care about that match anymore. From my experience those who t-bag usually end up dead and are toxic afterwards. Whenever I see it my reaction is more of a really? Than taking offence.
---
Attempting to knock meg from dapper doc
---
&gt;Legion is not viable at all without add-ons and on large maps. So uh yeah sorry but that doesn't make your point either.
---
You don't need perks or add-ons to stare at the floor and follow someone until they drop or start trying to mend.
---
&gt;So the person in the image is saying that the changes are unfair to survivors.
---
What exactly is fair about having most of his best add-ons cost 3k points and one of his add-ons is an actual killer perk which gives him the ability to run a 5th perk at the cost of a 3k bp add-on? 
---
&gt;maps are survivor sided, as they should be, but at least there's some fucking balance now. It was absurd in the past
---
It wasn't that bad actually. But we all have opinions based on the difficulty someone has at learning something and learning how to counter it.
---
&gt;Because the game needed to be slowed down. Gens are able to get done way too quickly at high ranks. I don't know why they chose healing, it was a dumb decision, but something needed to change
---
There's this really awesome perk. It's called ruin. You should try it out. Contrary to popular belief, it isn't broken as fast as everyone complains about. 
---
I've been doing a social experiment with ruin just to see how long a match lasts with it up the whole game and no pressure on survivors. Matches still last 10 minutes with no killer on their ass and that's just them powering through it. Skill checks can vary from having 3 to having 12. Probably more. Each time they don't hit a great check it resets their progress 5%. 
---
Healing for the majority of the match was a disgusting bandaid for killers that suck and don't want to and have no desire to better themselves as a player.
---
the map needs a buff, they were a great farming tool but they double punched it hard by making them more rare, and reduced point generation. undoing either one would be good IMO, I wouldnt mind using up all the map add-ons on a yellow map, or the point buff could make it a great item to use with BPS.
---
Mhmm, that‚Äôs why every time someone replies to one of your comments with even a slight amount of common sense and genuine game knowledge you choose to ignore them right? 
---
Anyways, just to show how stupid you are, I‚Äôve been playing almost solely killer for the last 2 months and before that I played about 60/40 with the 60 being survivor. 
---
3.6k hours, all achievements and I‚Äôve been playing since beta. 
---
Im sorry that you refuse to believe that perhaps your views on the game are flawed and choose to assume that everyone who has differing views to you is wrong. 
---
It‚Äôs likely the cause of some real life trauma which I truly hope you get through ok. 
---
Much love, dark.
---
Yes that laptop would be fine but I'd recommend an hp omen 17 ti. I own one and it can run dbd on ultra high graphical settings at 60+fps 
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking. There‚Äôs purple blood in that and the ‚Äúcage‚Äù idea is similar to rocket chairs. Harmless but fun 
---
Needs a boost!
---
Give bloodpoints for the basement sacrifices and ild probably run it often
---
Its a sign of autism is what it is
---
lets see if the survivor leaks
---
&gt;Comments are disabled for this review

So violent!
---
Reported to Apple. 
---
Honestly it takes longer to type on ps4 than it does to find a game as survivor nowadays 
---
Did common sense media write this review 
---
I feel so bad for that cat :( 
---
Well actually, there have been several nerfs to survivors and several buffs to killers since clowns update. It‚Äôs really not deniable, go read any of the patch notes of the last 8 months and you‚Äôll see it to be true. 
---
I say use Shadowborn, it‚Äôs nearly a must. I managed to get decent at nurse even with the awful FPS. Just got to have good TV brightness and get used to the blink ranges so you won‚Äôt have to look around much
---
The game really isn't a horror game, it just has a horror aesthetic. It's no scarier than running into an enemy soldier in another game.
---
Makes sense 
---
Cage idea isn‚Äôt actually that bad, if there were a map that instead of hooks there were cages, the killer would aggressively toss you in and close the door. The entity would slowly makes its way into the cage before killing you. Instead of unhook attempts you could attempt to pick the lock and instead of being unhooked your teammates would go through a short animation (same length as the unhook) to get you out 
---
I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it free weekend was hell for me because of my teammates who just got the game which I thought was weird because I‚Äôm rank 10 and I was getting rank 20 teammates and    Rank 5 killers
---
Honestly just play the game in whatever way you have the most fun. If you enjoy being the ‚Äúnice‚Äù killer and not tunneling/camping then continue to do so. 
---
I play mostly survivor and I have fun trying to loop the killer, so I‚Äôll usually try to do a gen in he middle of the map to get the killers attention and do my best at looping him/her. I might win more games spending my time hidden, but I have more fun looping the killer. 
---
Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how you should play the game. You bought the game to have fun and that‚Äôs what you should do.
---
When I need to be, then yes most definitely. This is the first time I've done something like this, especially with bing bong (look at those perks, yuck). When I feel bad for the last survivor and there's not more than two gens done, I let them fix them, while I watch, then lead them to the hatch. I can be good too :)
---
This is an online game. You cant make the killer ridiculously overpowered otherwise no one is going to play the other side. If you want to feel uber powerful and instill fear then you should play a single player game. No one wants to play a game with someone who is insta kill Myers all game. Take a step back and realize why this is made like that.
---
In regards to people who know the game not being ultra terrified of the killer. Obviously. With experience you learn what to do and not to do and become more comfortable. I dont know many people who when they first started this game werent stressed and scared when the killer was coming after them. It wears off as you become better though.
---
Y'all Godless heathens clearly need Jesus/Allah/Budha/Haruhi/whatever deity your ancestors worship in your life. 
---
indeed it is.
---
I totally understand. I sometimes switch to killer when I‚Äôm annoyed and be the exact opposite of everything I hate. Never camp, never tunnel whatsoever....everyone gets a fair chance to play. I don‚Äôt farm but I do end up letting people go kinda frequently as it feels rewarding to me to be nice to someone. I‚Äôll always be a survivor cause it‚Äôs the role I like to play but it‚Äôs a good way to relieve some frustration. 
---
A millisecond later, and he would've caught you. This is one of the greatest hatch-jumps I've ever seen.
---
Jeff and Jane are Staples of Internet cringe but I dunno the others
---
They just need to remove prayer beads and maybe the glasses. Neither are fair to play against.
---
And also teleport forward. You can literally outrun a 110% killer.
---
It's a lost art my friend
---
little off topic, but shrouds are so worthless to me. Seems they help survs more than anything. 
---
No, they are the ones to stop tbaggin Claudette‚Äôs. You can‚Äôt flashlight click if you can‚Äôt hold a flashlight
---
*laughs in Judith's Tombstone and 99% Evil Within II*
---
Really hope you got reported and end up being banned.
---
I‚Äôd be down with a scarecrow, but definitely not another corn field map
---
Broken Key would like a word with you.
---
you literally said that you like prestiging the " worst " killers in ur comment history 
---
I'll never DC because i think it's pretty stupid as well as a good way to throw the entire game for the remaining survivors. Does that mean that I'm happy about playing against Legion? No it doesn't, just not fun to play against and it feels like a pretty brain dead killer as well. When I lose to a hag or a nurse it's because I get outplayed through and through, that feeling is almost non-existent with Legion. 
---
Every single one has this. It wasnt that bad until people started moonwalking. Super boring to play against but if they changed it to where they could no longer just moonwalk then it would be slightly more bearable. Like if you're in the terror radius or something because I'm so tired of the moon walking esp when they're 2 feet from you around a pallet.
---
Do it. Make survivors spurt Gatorade that crashes their game.
---
I haven't even realized this and I have an interest in creepypastas! (before you ask, yes. I have been on the r/nosleep subreddit).
---
We should boycott op Billy tbh
---
Julie gang approves 
---
the bottom review is so informative
---
Billy would be fine if they'd just fix the fucking chainsaw hitbox. That things hitbox has got to be twice the size of billy himself.
---
They really need to fix all hitboxes in general. Solo survivor wouldn't be such a miserable experience if I only go down when the killer actually hits me.
---
Probably Easter 
---
I just hate them because I feel like most people that use her do it for the advantage she gives alone. She‚Äôs very small and hard to see due to her dark colored clothes and blending in. I personally have never had problems with Claudettes in chases but I absolutely cannot stand the ones that urban evade around and hide in corners
---
upvote for visibility
---
the other 2 are basicly the same rhing, edgy teen gets abused and then goes psycho mass murderer
---
I'd love a joke mode like this
---
So they buffed the Pig cuz it was the year of the pig.
---
I feel the same but I feel that survivor is the chore and killer is fun
---
I have shitty internet and people complain a lot when I play killer and someone with like 20x as many hours as me comments on my profile ‚Äúeasy report for lagswitching when I have green ping‚Äù
---
welcome. even if it doesnt show in post-game chat, we all love u
---
At least Nea isn‚Äôt impossible to see... I swear I‚Äôll be chasing a Claudette and she‚Äôll disappear in plain sight in front of me. Even the red tracks hardly do justice as her body is practically invisible
---
Pharmacy + Plunderers is amazing when people pop this many coins. Even better when you add that Ace perk
---
Probably my best story is I managed to kill a group of DS flashlight survivors who invited me in to a party to scream at me for the next 30 seconds post game
---
Chinese Lunar New Year? 
---
Lol dead by daylight better graphics then f13?
---
Playing on console?
---
F13 looks beautiful on pc
---
This is a two way street. If youre participating in a standoff youre as much an ass as the other party.
---
Yes, tongue in cheek humor, and humor in general, should always be taken seriously. 
---
I fucking miss that show, so underrated. lol
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind tunneling a DS player. They all deserve to die 
---
I like this. 
---
Lmao still avoiding it. Not irrelevant whatsoever. If I made a topic on how killer needs to be more difficult, are you telling me that someone replying gens go too quickly would be an irrelevant post because it‚Äôs a topic about killer? Of course not. These are linked issues. You talked about gas cans, I replied that this additional time is going to reward campers. You have no rebuttal and call it irrelevant. How so? You don‚Äôt see the connection between gen speed and camping/tunneling? 
---
Im saying they're equally as toxic. Especially when you dont have ds or good items and the killers still an asshole anyway which is 90% of my games at this point.
---
Glad to see someone enjoyed the game after the free weekend, leave a good steam review for the future of pc I don‚Äôt play on it personal but I‚Äôve seen only negative reviews from it
---
As a newcomer to the game in 2019, I wholeheartedly agree.  I enjoy every aspect of the game so far except spacebar (or whatever you bind it to) mashing.  Those of you who are defending it are only doing so because it's always been this way.  
---
As you clearly are referring to me with the beginning bit, I never said that killers haven‚Äôt received nerfs or survivors haven‚Äôt received buffs.
---
I‚Äôm merely trying to defend my points while Ankle  repeatedly bashes everyone who has even a slight disagreement with him. 
---
Both sides have their issues but what the guy said in the steam post isn‚Äôt entirely wrong especially coming from a new players perspective. 
---
On the Dead by Daylight Wiki page for The Clown they talk about Maurice in the [trivia section.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Kenneth_%22Jeffrey_Hawk%22_Chase#Trivia)
---
In addition searching "Maurice" on the Wiki will redirect to the Clown's Wiki page, which is how I found it on the Wiki.
---
The dude you replied to is a prime example of why your right tbh. 
---
It‚Äôs not a bad thing nor is it definitive as there are also plenty of survivors who complain but personally I‚Äôve noticed a lot more from the killers of reddit.
---
Yeah
---
I do believe he can get banned for this lmao
---
What happens when your in the ‚Äúcage‚Äù and the timer runs out? The entity makes you take a nappy nap?
---
Wait wait wait. There was a free weekend? Dang. Must've  missed it.
---
Legion is the one killer who can focus down a single survivor and hook them without needing any skill. If a legion wants you on the hook, there isn‚Äôt anything you can do about it, and that‚Äôs frustrating as a survivor. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs hard for a legion to 4K without strong add-ons, but that still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you literally can‚Äôt do anything to loop him as a single survivor.
---
My favorite part of the game is the mind game that comes with looping a killer. Every other killer needs to beat you in that aspect, except for legion. If you beat him to a pallet or window, he can just use his ability and just like that you are hit, and he can continue to stab you without a penalty for missed hits. At least with Nurse you are heavily punished for missed hits and the survivor get a chance to escape.
---
I think you tagged this wrong.
---
Really? I find the newest map (Ski Lodge) to have the worst FPS hands down.
---
Lets hope they reported me. I have it recorded and won‚Äôt take it down so fingers crossed
---
Gotta love the aim assist locking on/forcing you to swing at someone who isn't even asleep while Freddy. Feels darn man
---
Happy birthday! Oink!
---
I know right
---
Yeah this is everyone's first opinion. With enough play time you realise it's a time management team game rather than you vs a killer. 
---
I‚Äôll try that, thanks. I find the sensitivity cap an issue too because it‚Äôs hard to scout during blinks even at 100%. I have seen some good console Nurses so I know it‚Äôs possible, but damn if it isn‚Äôt frustrating.
---
True, but it‚Äôs easier to run from a person with a knife than a bullet.
---
Make it so it exhausts you
---
&gt; You unironically said that the Nurse being able to ignore a large majority of the game mechanics is a necessity
---
And it's no surprise you completely ignored the context in which I presented it. I didn't expect any sort of honesty out of you, so I'm not even disappointed.
---
&gt; Why do you just assume I'm referring to my experience at rank 10?
---
Because your nonsense describes the game at rank 10 and above. Sure, plenty of boosted players exist in the red ranks, but if you're going to list off that string of hyperbolic diarrhea as fact, then you've very clearly declared the rank at which you reside. Perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps you've been rank 1; perhaps you're currently rank 1 and just have a retarded thought process and a penchant for exaggerated lies. I don't particularly care one way or another, but it's not hard to see through you.
---
Now that that's over, let's get into your attempt at rebuttal.
---
&gt; Well because experienced and skilled survivors playing optimally is too strong so that means ALL survivors need to be nerfed
---
This is where you really miss the boat. Never once has it been suggested that survivors *themselves* are to blame, at least not in any meaningful point. The core issue is map design, as it always has been. The complaints of perks and item combos only really exist because of how terrible map design currently is, and it's an issue that's existed since launch; you may not have been around during the infinite era where places like the magic school bus or the safety tree existed, but it was impossible to deal with those areas unless you were a trapper that had the area prepped before a survivor ever approached it - good luck not having your traps disarmed. Things like insta-heal don't really rely on poor map design, but further show the issue with it because of how long chases can last, especially when giving yourself an extra life. Things like dead hard wouldn't be as large of an issue if their execution didn't lead to another large time extension on a chase. Decisive wouldn't be nearly as problematic if you didn't earn another 60 seconds easily, even longer if the killer isn't running enduring. 
---
&gt; Well because experienced and skilled Nurse players playing optimally is too strong...
---
I'm not even sure where you came up with this paragraph because it's not even remotely been suggested in anything I've written. I've skipped quoting the entire thing just to eliminate some of the text wall, but you and I know what's being talked about. The Nurse represents how things should actually be in this game dynamic-wise: a killing powerhouse that you have the ability to elude or distract, but if you're marked for death, you can only prolong the inevitable. Stealth gameplay is virtually worthless despite P3 Squadettes with their urban evasion and murky reagants because there's nearly no penalty for being caught due to the strength and safety of map tiles in the current design. This has gone from a survival horror game to an MMORPG tank-and-spank encounter, and it didn't take long to do - refer to aforementioned magic school bus and safety tree. You can have a single survivor provide immunity to the rest of the team by occupying the killer's time while they play M1 simulator. This isn't efficient play on the killer's part, and nobody disagrees with this; however, it's quite odd to tell someone who is supposed to be an all powerful agent of death to "just leave that guy alone". That doesn't fit the atmosphere one bit, and it puts full control of a match into the hands of a survivor who's smart enough to use it.
---
&gt; I get that when you play against a 4 man SWF group
---
You don't need a full SWF group to embarrass a killer and work him over. You can have all solo survivors that have good game sense and efficient play and they'll still pull it off. Optimal survivors don't go running from generators when they hear a heartbeat, shitty ones do. Optimal survivors don't rush a hook and crouch behind objects waiting to dive a Leatherface who's checking the immediate area of the hook for would-be saviors; even if he decides to go full face camp and not move an inch while having his chainsaw at max rev, smart survivors won't stand there and complain about not being able to get the unhook, they'll just go do every generator on the map in the time it takes the guy to bleed out.
---
&gt; However, have you ever considered the exact same thing applies in reverse?
---
What is there to consider? Last I checked, the killer doesn't have anybody to work with him. He doesn't have someone on discord telling him to go for a save or to call out the location of the ruin totem while being chased off it. He doesn't have someone that warns him of the location of traps or the killer's direction after being hooked. He has to run an entire map against 4 people that have the ability to endlessly frustrate him because of design flaws leading to an outrageous level of potency for his opponents. Survivors already bitch about anything that benefits a killer, demanding the highest probability of escape because of "muh fairness" or "muh game experience", but could you imagine a world where survivors had to play in first person view? Could you imagine if there were less pallets on the map, windows? Survivors have gotten so spoiled and their sense of entitlement so coddled that the only response to anything that takes them down a peg is tantrum. People want to complain about the Nurse, or now the Legion, because of the ability to give survivors the middle finger when it comes to chases, wholly and willfully ignorant of the multitudinous middle fingers they've given to killers throughout this game's entire existence.
---
&gt; that's trying to get a 4k 
---
Let's revise this paragraph and hopefully you'll understand how stupid you sound:
---
&gt; When killers are playing trying to enjoy themselves and have to play against good survivors that are trying to survive then it can absolutely be WAY too strong and not fun to play against as the killer
---
Do you have any concept of how ridiculous you sound? The fun comes from the chasing, the hiding, the trying to juke the killer, even the Nurse. Fun has been conflated with winning, and while I don't blame anybody for wanting to win, it's spawned an awful virus of entitlement and poor sportsmanship that's infecting the playerbase, killer and survivor alike. There are killers that believe they should steamroll every survivor group without effort because "muh theme/muh role" and survivors that believe they should be able to dance around the killer without effort and have enough safety nets for if they do make a mistake because "muh agency". This isn't healthy competition, and I'm afraid that because of current attitudes, anything done map-design-wise that shifted some of that power away from survivors would erupt in a bomb of selfish indignation. I don't particularly care about the butthurt that would ensue but it would be disappointing to see people who want to call themselves adults acting like toddlers.
---
&gt; Point is stop looking at 100% optimal survivors and wanting to balance around that
---
I didn't say I did, but there's a far greater margin for error on the survivor's side than there is the killer's.
---
&gt; but then looking at mediocre killers and wanting to balance around that
---
That's not what I even remotely suggested. Again, I'm not surprised by this mischaracterization of my argument, but it's becoming pathetic. This discussion isn't ending because of being unmoving in our positions, rather because your dedication to misrepresentation further exacerbated by hyperbole.
---
&gt; I know I likely won't reply after this anyways
---
Indeed. I have nothing left to say of someone that's not only completely up his own ass, but conveniently twists everything into accusations and preposterous claims to support his position. 
---
#AddMauriceOnEveryMap
---
For every one asshole killer, there‚Äôs four asshole survivors. 
---
We can go faster. Double speed addons Legion with PWYF, D:Hope and Bloodlust 3 and Beast of Prey. Once your red stain goes away, just try to find the nearest survivor and freak them out. 
---
That has always been weird to me. I'll go with you on the hard to see part, I imagine I'd be hard to spot in the dark as well with the right clothing but her worse crime is being dark skinned? I failed to see how that's something to hate the character herself over. Hell, Meg in all black could easily lose me. Megs dressed as Batman scares me more than any Claudette. 
---
It's a matter of the characters making use of Claudette's features to get an edge. But that doesn't make her any more toxic than the others. 
---
I don‚Äôt see the issue here, care to elaborate? 
---
Hardcore immersion:  No HUD, No Music, Just Environmental Sounds Cranked Up including (Foot Steps &amp;  Breathing of Survivors/Killers),  No Red Stain, No Heart Beats, No  Visual Queue,  only mode with  Proximity Chat.
---
I imagine it's different for everyone, we all have our own stress with the game. Yours being just as valid as mine.
---
I could care less what happens 
---
**Entity's Maze**  
---
It's mostly normal, except there's four exit gates (one on each side of the trial) instead of two, and the Hatch does not spawn. When survivors escape the trial, they are immediately put into another trial, depending on which exit gate they left from. There are a total of nine trial areas in a 3x3 square (It would look like this:  
---
\- : Trial  
---
o : Starting Trial  
---
\- - -  
---
\- o -  
---
(If survivors go from the middle trial to the upper trial, for example, Exit Gates will spawn at the left and right sides of the trial. None will spawn on the top or bottom sides.)  
---
Survivors that die in a trial are removed from the game mode, and each time a trial ends, one extra Survivor is added to each active trial. (Say four survivors escape out of one gate. An extra survivor will appear with them, bringing the total up to five.) Generators scale normally. (So if there's five survivors, six generators require power, and eight generators will spawn)  
---
Multiple trials can be going at one time.  
---
Upon finishing a trial, both Survivors and Killers receive Bloodpoints.  
---
There is no pipping or depipping, but you'll generally play with Killers/Survivors around your rank.  
---
Inactive trials do not have a Killer until they activate (atleast one survivor goes into that trial area from another)  
---
If atleast one Survivor has escaped from an active Trial and there are no more survivors left, that trial becomes finished and can no longer be accessed. The killer in that trial will be removed and granted Bloodpoints.  
---
If a killer kills all survivors in a trial, they receive the No One Escaped bloodpoint bonus, and that trial does not finish, it simply becomes inactive again.  
---
The gamemode ends either when every trial has been finished, or all Survivors participating have been sacrificed.  
---
If all trials are finished, all living Survivors are granted a total 1.5x BP bonus.  
---
The killer who sacrifices the last living Survivor throughout the maze gets a 2x BP bonus.  
---
At the end of each trial, Survivors and Killers see a map of the gamemode, showing any inactive, active, and completed trials.  
---
Any questions or criticism would be welcome!
---
New players already have trouble with Freddy, don‚Äôt make it even worse on them. 
---
Nurse isn't hard enough to justify how good she is. And once you're good with her its just 4k's forever unless you get a godlike team and you fuck up
---
Umm... Because they are at the hatch and not downed yet?
---
Always?
---
Are you forgetting about Feng?
---
that is when dead hard fucking works
---
They also have issue with the killer/add-ons mentioned. Nothing new here.
---
What a pussy. Wow.
---
&gt; fix the damn hitbox
---
I don't disagree with this. There are plenty of things that should/should not hit that are victims of poor hitboxes. Huntress is especially considered here; throwing a hatchet a full body behind your target and it landing, or seeing the hatchet fly through their head and not landing, is pretty frustrating for both sides respectively. 
---
&gt; she sometimes completely ignores the stun impact and hits you anyways
---
This is another design element. I don't know to necessarily call it a flaw, though I could see the case for calling it that. Similar situations can be observed when dropping a pallet on a killer picking up a survivor before a certain part of the animation; the same can be said of flashlight saves. I agree you should have to time things properly and not waste them, otherwise they become too powerful, but I wouldn't oppose a little more clarity around it.
---
Because they arrived at the hatch and were not yet captured by the killer.
---
Cool if only you had more important things to do with the time in your life. V good killer.
---
Awesome :)
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Awww, but the music is lovely though :(
---
For every accurate statistic, 4 are made up 
---
They also have issues with basically everything in the game. Don't make it even worse, indeed.
---
I just quit the games if someone camps or tunnels hardcore. No points for those assholes.
---
Part of what makes Freddy so stealthy is that he can't be detected with survivor aura-reading perks when the user is awake. OoO wouldn't proc anyway.
---
Hey! I loved to read your feedback and the insight you gave.
---
So, let's talk a bit about what you bring to the table here!
---
&gt;Look around? Get Fear and then get grabbed. Don't look around? Just get grabbed (due to the 0 terror radius).
---
I didn't thought about numbers, but we could fix this problem by making **Fear of Sight** last for a good bunch of time, with that kinda short cooldown (5 seconds), so there is a margin for Survivors to peep really shortly. But I also thought that even receiving a stun from him if he's far will not lead him getting to you. You would still have time to run since he as a Killer does not have any natural form of displacement besides walking. What do you think?
---
&gt;Tier III has the potential to be worse than Tiers I and II, unless the aura would've disappeared upon hit with tiers I and II anyways.
---
A successful strike in Tier I and II will make you lose the Survivor's aura aswell! I believe the Tier ladders are balanced thinking that way.
---
&gt;Crows are everywhere, though, making a 6% boost seem a little too high IMO.
---
I gave it a 20s cooldown on Tier III, but it may be overpowered now that you're saying. Maybe we could go somewhere around one minute and a half, or even maybe 2 minutes.
---
&gt;The slowdown on Tier III seems just a little bit too strong.
---
Yeah, the idea of **Hex: Rotten Field** initially was to create unique scenarios with different killers. The slowdown could be somewhat inferior, but that would need testing I believe!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BTW, thanks for the feedback! I really like reading your thoughts. Please do not mind replying!
---
Why the hell is this so funny? I'm in tears.   
---
I'd love to see more Joey and Susie art tho. 
---
Not quite as many hours but same here. Ran across the game and have had a blast so far. Really chill game to play with the wife. Can‚Äôt wait to put more hours in
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
‚ÄúMy daughter, who is five was playing this game and now I need to douse her in pyramid scheme oils and chant sacred mom groups posts‚Äù
---
Hold on, I think I fucked up. Is it Julie or Susie that has the pink hair?
---
https://youtu.be/fYdCGrclMVY
---
I screamED lmaoo too real
---
I got it this weekend and definitely feel stronger as survivor. Bought it and a dlc, loving the game! Only gripe is non dedicated servers, but heard that was coming. 
---
Okay has anyone else noticed this? That's so cool!
---
Interesting. I've had both spine chill and premonition trigger while awake Vs a Freddy. But it was a while ago.
---
Just bring noed and an ebony if your gonna go that sweaty
---
Using logic and reason in your arguments? DOWNVOTE HIM REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yeah basically. The max you could play as a survivor is 9 games. I'll agree that it was really complicated, but by the time I realized that I had already spent about 10 minutes on the suggestion and I didn't want to rework it. The survivors' goal is to finish all the trials, while the Killers' goal is to keep as many of them inactive as possible. It also rewards killers for not getting 4Ks but still getting some kills, as then you're not dumping five survivors on the next Killer. It could probably cause some major lag if one survivor goes through each gate on the middle trial (and therefore four trials would be going on at once, since this game can barely even handle *one* trial sometimes)
---
I lost brain cells reading this 
---
Honestly after like a week you stop fearing killers. 
---
i feel your pain
---
Except to the rating on steam 
---
That's how mafia works.
---
I‚Äôve had a couple games that were stressful. One where everyone died and I had to do like 2 or three gens solo. Had some really close jukes where I was clenching. Dayz and dark souls has taught me to like the heart throbbing 
---
Had 4 minutes to spare out of the few more years im willing to live
---
I just played this game recently. Lemme tell you a game has never made me cry more than this because of my outcomes.
---
I both love any hate this meme being popular on DBD
---
Amazing review.
---
And yet playing as Survivor is STILL easy as fuck.
---
Well you still use ruin or nurse.That shows your skill.
---
For every one thing killers complain about, survivors make up four rules killers ‚Äúhave to follow‚Äù
---
This is a stupid review, I agree. But I would love an option to lessen the bloodsplatter and gore, partially for performances sake, partially because my younger siblings want to watch sometimes. Just a switch to toggle on and off excessive blood. 
---
Susie, god damn it I thought I found another Julie fan 
---
I dont think I was referring to you at all. I was actually referring to how most of the survivors in this thread are mentioning that the recent patches have been all survivor nerfs and killer buffs (which is in fact true, at least reading the patch notes) and how the main killer argument I've been reading is "hur dur".
---
I dont believe I was insulting you. At least, you weren't my intended target.
---
? 
---
Let me explain it once more....
---
You believe survivors should be slowed down with the objective being extended, gas cans was your suggestion. My rebuttal is that both sides need to be addressed to slow the game down, because survivors being slowed down gives even more incentive for a killer to camp/tunnel to win.
---
Your response is that this is in some way, not on topic. That‚Äôs NOT an answer lol.
---
There‚Äôs only one semi bad rank issue and they still killed you, hardly what I‚Äôd call shite...
---
2019 was a mistake
---
Yes but it‚Äôs a pretty well known fact that new players struggle with Freddy more so than every other killer. This change wouldn‚Äôt affect veterans hardly at all but would completely neg new players even harder when playing against Freddy.
---
Then ya meet legion.
---
nah just another bug.Being noticed by the killer isn‚Äôt even the worst part of this bug..the continuous blood splurging out of you slows the game down a shit ton and even makes it crash...
---
Feng is a 12 year boy with a bowlcut.  
---
I get you. The only part I disagree with is you can move onto another match. Combine this with double digit match making times and it‚Äôs neatly unplayable. The times have actually driven to to cut my dbd time by a good 70% over the past few weeks.
---
Can‚Äôt do 5 gens by myself ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Ah, my mistake then, only assumed it was directed towards me because I said to check the patch notes of the past months. 
---
I used to use noed but not anymore. It‚Äôs such an unfair and dumb perk. If I can‚Äôt get you legit I don‚Äôt deserve to kill you.
---
Anyway, there‚Äôs so many other great and awesome perks that I don‚Äôt have a space for this crap anymore.
---
Haven't seen it on PC. 
---
I still see lots of double pallets, double windows in my games. I won't even play Swamp, the building in Grim Pantry and the boat in Pale Rose are broken as fuck.
---
It took me a while before I escaped the first time, but if it were easy it wouldn't be as fun, to be honest. 
---
"I have outsmarted your outsmarting!"
---
His review is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, a drop in a large ocean. No one is going to read that review and be convinced of anything but to keep scrolling down. It takes an actual problematic game to bring the games rating down, not a bunch of half assed negative reviews.
---
You just wanted to let them hear your song without any interruptions lol.
---
When I read the title I expected an actual trap remix with Bing bongs in it or something, slightly disappointed tbh
---
I‚Äôm not a pc gamer so I don‚Äôt know but doesn‚Äôt it have an algorithm that scores the game?
---
*Laughs in Relaxed Bun*
---
Or rather what does it represent i dont understand what is means or what it is supposed to be.
---
Sounds good!
---
So says the puppers fandom.
---
Jeez at this point Keys with Gold Tokens are useless now.
---
U r v cool and v good killer.
---
Talk about dramatic. -_- 
---
Mate, I'm a killer main, I don't get salty about getting killed when I play survivor, since it's kind of obvious that that's what they need to do. I do however get salty about people using an unfair exploit to BM. I find it's similar to when a survivor used to be able to dead hard on top of places that killers couldn't reach. 
---
It separates by overall and recent.
---
It's a bunch of gears, either a direct reference to the inner workings of a generator or a metaphor for the "part of a whole" nature of survivor team play. 
---
It's only annoying when they do it at the exit gate but other than that I don't care for it, if anything giving me more time to catch up. Is funny when you body block them at a corner and they turn and do it.
---
That was actually most players. Freddy‚Äôs power was very new for dbd and even some of the longest standing veterans of the time thought he was op during his ptb. I‚Äôm sure new players didn‚Äôt help but they most certainly were not the only cause. 
---
Now I do agree with you, new players not knowing how to deal with Freddy is not really a good argument to use for why he shouldn‚Äôt receive certain buffs but at the same time if you don‚Äôt consider the new players at all you are blatantly hurting the condition and lifespan of the game as without the constant flow of new people we would never have gotten to where we are today and the game will never grow past the point we are currently at. 
---
Welcome to the insanity. You are now one of us.
---
It didnt have billy face of course it didnt belong here /s
---
Tbh, I have to look away during the Moris, they're a bit too much for me
---
Two of them got enough points that they clearly did something... 
---
That happened to me twice. Another survivor would be hooked and I would get the animation of being hooked
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
This is on pc though, that problem is only on console
---
With people like Michael Myers...less violent...Michael...hmmm

Fellow Comrade 
---
ummm call me crazy but you insulted me first by saying ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get much thicker than you are right now.‚Äù In some ways, this could be deemed a compliment, but not in this context!
---
"I've played at Rank 1 on killer and survivor. I've played around with ranks 5-15. I feel like I just don't have fun anymore. *But I want to*. This isn't a dev complaint thread or a DS/NOED complaint thread. This is me nearly giving up on a game that I've dumped hundreds of hours into because of one thing."  
---
Your experience with the game is valid regardless of any of that. You shouldn't feel to bring up your rank or your preference to vent safely to us. I hate the environment here made players feel they have to do that. I mainly play killer and Dead by Daylight fatigue sucks no matter who you are. If anyone gives a shit, I do at least. lol  
---
My advice is to take a break and return to the game with a clear head. That's what works for me sometimes, I return then get wrecked for a bit before finding my groove again. 
---
Okay man, you were there so...
---
Take a break for a month or two. 
---
I did, and I recently started playing again and it feels really nice. 
---
hmmm
---
2019 was when the universe single handedly fucked earth
---
When one directly effects the other, it is every damn bit on topic. The only real counter to bullshit camping and tunneling off hook is popping gens. That‚Äôs what every damn reply to camping threads is
---
....‚Äùjust do gens‚Äù. You know that. Here we are talking about things to SLOW that down. Bringing up how that effects camping /tunneling is 100% reasonable. 
---
Lol complaining about unfair ranks when you're the lowest rank and still died. Ummm. . . . .
---
It's also on PC. Had it happen to me.
---
No, it's telling all your friends "This cafe is terrible and you shouldn't go there. They should be ashamed to run a business like that."
---
And the one being nasty and toxic is you. I did nothing but give an example to clarify the logic of my opinion, and you proceeded to insult me.
---
mood
---
Survivors move at 100% speed. Killers move at 115% speed, with a couple exceptions. You must get better at following, young padawan. 
---
Yeah, people tend to not want to play with you when you abuse an glitch in the game to make it unfair for the other side. Funny that.
---
I need a team
---
how are you rank 19 with that perk build
---
ngl I‚Äôm down for bearded Jake too 
---
This guy just explained what a dbd rip-off mobile game is all about
---
I have been playing other games more recently because I feel like killers are ruining the game. Before you shout cry baby survior main,  I play as both... I was playing survive with friends with ONE other person,  we waited around 20/25 minutes for a match. Excited to finally get one,  only to get face camped by a unprovoked wraith. He literally instantly found a player as soon as the game started. I would of d/c'd as well, if it happened to me, well it did but I was to far in to leave. He then taunted the last survior by carrying him to the hatch, dropping him beside it,  then hooked him right next to it... When what he did took absolutely no skill. Why ruin the game for other people? If your goal is to face camp,  your a piece of shit and literally should quit playing. I get sometimes it's deserved but for no reason is just sad. Okay my salty ass rant is over, let the hate begin‚ù£
---
Fair fair, I apologize for antagonizing you.
---
The reviewer never bad mouthed the game though, clarifying that it was not to their liking twice. There was no mention of it being terrible, no trashmouthing the business. Just a dislike of violence. I kind of feel like you're taking a review as an attack on your game.
---
I am so tired of people calling Nea hideous, like come on it isn't really that bad, she may be ugly and all but killers have feelings too
---
You think killers feel any different about survivors? I know I don‚Äôt go into a match wanting to get tbagged and flashlight clicked and told I‚Äôm tunneling literally no matter what I do? If I choose not to kill its ‚Äúgg easy baby killer‚Äù if I get even a single kill it‚Äôs ‚Äútunneling, facecamper!‚Äù Except I have to deal with four people doing it and at all times of the match
---
You‚Äôre abusing a known exploit... that‚Äôs why. 
---
SS: Nurse
---
S: Hag, Billy
---
A: Spirit, Huntress
---
B: Wraith, Doc, Pig
---
C: Clown, Myers
---
D: Trapper, Legion, Freddy
---
F: Bubba
---
Steepest is one hell of an exaggeration, this game isn't really very deep
---
For the kind of player you seem to be, sprint burst would be a good option.
---
Try to avoid walking all over the map by 99% your burst. It'll save you a lot of time.
---
You‚Äôre an inspiration my friend
---
&lt;3
---
This is the second time I've seen it. I haven't had it happen to me yet but it happened after he couldn't pick her out of a trap so maybe that has something to do with it?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm with OP I‚Äôve never had more butt clenched moments and making god awful gasping noises while my wife sits there and looks at me like an idiot.
---
Play the tutorials that are provided. You get a grasp of what to do and a nice 25k bp for each one
---
The majority wouldn't get the reference
---
Gotta get off the door to give them some teabagging
---
Did you watermark a reaction meme that you just added text to? Lol
---
Fucking kys bitch this game is not for FUCKING CASUALS
---
What are the unspoken rules I keep hearing about?
---
After the free weekend instantly put the sale price. Too hard to pass up on, great game.
---
Sorry, I uploaded the wrong image without the markups earlier!
---
How‚Äôs Billy op?
---
Save your iridescent shards from leveling then you can get the clown without spending money. 
---
My god that would be fucking terrifying lol , also I love it , lets pitch this idea at the devs. What would you manifestation of the entity be though a spider?
---
I usually get destroyed while doing dailies. And when tryharding, trying to be friendly, grinding, playing casually, with or without friends, etc
---
Yes even after you heal
---
People arent going yo be scared of you its a game. Get over yourself lol
---
Yea so either bring some bps, or find a real game üòÖ
---
"puts you in cage..." okay
---
Alternatively, the glitched co-op quest that requires you to co-heal 180s. 
---
Took me a week to clear it - mostly because I was at 160s because of a farming match. Took a slugging Billy for me to get it.
---
That‚Äôs really whiny. Who cares how I feel? I didn‚Äôt say it was wrong. But I don‚Äôt want to look at it. It‚Äôs not my thing. Go fuck yourself.
---
Alrighty little guy
---
I'd rather survivors knew which killer they face. Killers know not just which survivors, but what items they carry. It might result in people leaving a lobby when they see a wraith, but it's better than them leaving the game. I realize the latter punishes them, but it punishes the survivors that stay too.
---
That game is good. Except that the 90% of the times the killer doesn't even know what he has to do, survivors always skill checks and when they are being chased they just hide through two ground holes.
---
Not to mention survivors can easily abuse Freddy, moreso than any other killer in the game, *by using his own power against him*. Freddy can't do shit against people who are opening doors, finishing gens, healing someone he just downed, etc. etc. *in his face*, just because they haven't finished the dream transition yet. 
---
Lol thats what she deserves
---
It definitely wears off as you play more, so enjoy it while it lasts.  I'm 200+ hours and it's just starting to go away.  Except for Myers.  And hag traps.  And Freddy when you're the last survivor.  OK I said it's STARTING to go away...
---
Me and my friends play it whenever we are bored
---
I think u had a stroke lol
---
Moris are the most unbalanced shit ever. Its essentially a free win
---
Sounds like Identity V on mobile!
---
Pallets are more sparse now than ever. Dead zones will sometimes naturally spawn now, and if played correctly the distances between pallets can cause hits if a killer is optimal with how they deal with the pallet.
---
Both survivors and killers need fixing. Perks and mechanics need adjustments, and will be fixed over time in an equal manner eventually. Just because there is a bad vocal minority doesn't mean that it reflects the views of all players. 
---
Many maps are growing ever more killer sides. Some maps need more pallets than others, and others definitely need much less. 
---
The game is in a good state currently and is growing even better over time. 
---
Lol we posted the same thing at almost the same time 
---
I've seen maybe one or two bugged double pallets, but it's just bugs. Some structures still need tweaking still, but most maps are balanced now
---
Yay new ~~blood~~ I mean, fellow survivors and associates :)
---
Telling survivors not to teabag is like telling water to stop being wet lol
---
lmao me today. They somehow got the memo and let me
---
Yeah Autodidact says "Screw you" to healing debuffs which is what I like about it.
---
Instructions unclear, got sucked into an unescapable hellscape run by a spider god.
---
Because you are an asshole.
---
One of us Michael 
---
Yeah that's The Initiation. Luckily the next patch will fix that (But the devs may make it even more broken, you never know with this spaghetti code)
---
Good save. We don‚Äôt want to scare them off until the Entity takes them completely and it‚Äôs too late to leave.... like the rest of us..
---
Depends on the person. I only teabag when I see a fellow survivor
---
ICINUT. Yeh!
---
"Darn"
---
I call it "Nope, I'd rather have to mori as a Nurse, atleast that gives me actual bloodpoints instead of what I'd get out of one Doc match."
---
I really hope people notice and debate about this Killer!
---
"He's just standing there, menacingly!"
---
Wasnt expecting you to reference supernatural 
---
It‚Äôs the main reason I believe he should get a rework rather than a straight up buff.
---
Which is why DCing is a problem. Btw rank reset can also still get you back to 20-15
---
Billy isn‚Äôt OP, you just don‚Äôt know how to juke him me thinks
---
I had that the other night it was everywhere. Does it notify them or just easier to find? I have only seen it once while playing survivor.
---
Hell, TF2 (cartoony team shooter/hat simulator) is more gory than DbD
---
I'd just stick to kyf matches... Just to be safe
---
r/fridaythe13th
---
Dribble them like an NBA all star
---
What mindgame? Most loop spots have 100% visibility of the killer or enough holes in the wall to see where he is at certain points in the loop like the shack. 
---
See, I get this to an extent. When I play survivor, I get Hardcore potatoes. When I play Killer, I get the fucking Avengers. If I didn‚Äôt run survivor with people some times, I‚Äôd have lost my damn mind by now.
---
holy shit that‚Äôs real
---
So it's not really a cap, just no way to get higher lol. A cap would more be if it was 9 the last offering would be null. 
---
We won't let our Ace in The Hole + Plunderer's Instinct + Open Handed + Pharmacy build go to waste!
---
ur a nerd lol
---
I also could crop your watermark out bud
---
It's endin' cuz now the Earth's shadow is no longer blocking most sunlight. Sorry if you missed it!
---
best yet
---
it‚Äôs a shame about the lawsuit. i was really hoping to see f13 become a great game. that lawsuit fucked us all over
---
On an unrelated note, R.I.P. that David.
---
and none of them were so much funny as just oh look it matches
---
Enjoy it while you can. The first few hours are the best because then youre really on edge.
---
Lawsuit? I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm unfamiliar 
---
Ugh, stolen unhooks are the worst. Especially when you're trying to be careful so the guy doesn't get tunnelled, and so you can get your Deliverance, and the thief YOLOs in with the Killer still near by and fucks up everything.
---
I know the feeling, I‚Äôve dumped...let‚Äôs just say a lot of hours into the game (devotion 3 and started playing when it was free on PSN) and I‚Äôve been burned out from time to time. Best you can do is take a break, play the other side for a while, do No Mither Mondays or something dumb like that to make it fun, or just play some Civilization III, I heard it‚Äôs a great game
---
Inside THAT chest is another chest with another chest in it which has another chest inside it with yet another chest inside that chest with more chests inside the chests IN THE CHESTS, TO REVEAL:a brown medkit
---
Yeah there's not a mechanical cap, but it is technically capped at eleven (atleast until we get a 2v8 mode and that cap becomes nineteen)
---
You all are falling for bait. This review is clearly satire.
---
It's happened to me more times than I'd like to admit...  
---
~~especially when I wanted to give the killer extra hits but didn't position myself in time~~  
---
~~or that time where I could've escaped if I had brought balanced landing but got downed in the gate~~
---
Dick
---
I actually confused this game with F13 at first and wondered why Jason wasn't one of the killers. I was like "wait, didn't this game completely fail?"
---
Real talk though, the format could apply itself to more than just horror games
---
Killer is a bit more of a chore to me, since things like trying to find the last guy for 20 minutes who's been hiding in bushes for that time and most Survivor strats like pallet looping (which I don't really mind since what else are they meant to do, run in a straight line?) are just exhausting to play against as some Killers - granted there are Killers that can fairly confidently make loops last a lot less or such but killer variety is cool to have personally + I like doing Dailies if I can.
---
I still like to play Killer fairly often and I think Survivor can be similarly annoying, so it's not like I think Killer is worse to play or anything. Killer can be fun too. It's just that if a Survivor knows what they're doing, it's usually more tilting to play against than playing against a Killer that knows what they're doing personally.
---
Run insidious instead of overcharge. Then you can freak them the fuck out by going silent periodically.
---
&gt;You can‚Äôt even dodge them. 
---
Technically speaking, Dead Hard is a dodge. 
---
How about no?
---
Hook vacuum is still there, but let‚Äôs not remove it and let‚Äôs remove the pallet vacuum because KiLlErS
---
Isn‚Äôt this practically Death garden?
---
at lower ranks players find that killers are overpowered but as you rank up you will find that survivors are more in the position of power. why don't you try playing killer and rank up. you will soon see how fast survivors can get the game done with.
---
Camps and self heal.
---
I'm not asking for like a Ubi balance, but half the time the flashlight doesn't work and time and time again I get hit after slamming the plank down and hit after I'm done vaulting
---
[I changed some things for a slightly better look](https://i.imgur.com/FGh9Txu.png)
---
Idk, but I always run into those pallet drops like a dingus cause I never stop in time
---
Haha lol the Game had literally JUST started so... nothing!
---
So we just keep getting hook camped and hit through vaulting till our team has the right skill set?
---
You clearly haven't played the game a lot, you just need to get better
---
You don't understand. He was looping the killer, completing gens solo and spectating each of the 3 other survivors all at the same time. You just weren't there to see it. 
---
What tickles me is how much you seem to dislike tydetime, despite being exactly like him lol
---
If you are someone uncomfortable about feminine people, then yeah you should evaluate why.
---
yea sorry those types of watermarks are generally ineffective 
---
I'm level 26 with Jake, is there any special skill I should look out for?
---
Inexperienced killers have an advantage over inexperienced survivors. Experienced survivors have an advantage over experienced killers. 
---
Harder for a survivor to hide since the killer can see the blood spraying everywhere
---
This game is missclassified as "horror", you're not meant to be scared, it's just aesthetic.
---
They keep buffing it so I dont see why not
---
If you include mending maybe also add snapping out of it 
---
My Hero Academia‚ù§Ô∏è

ikr
---
I DC vs Frank's Mixtape or if the Legion starts chase-breaking to exploit the deep wound :)
---
We must find this guy and Mori him
---
There's still one survivor left, you'd have to wait for them to be fully dead before the hatch can open.
---
It woukd just be an alternative controller, so i doubt VAC would even detect it as unusual.
---
Sorry it's already scheduled for a repost next week but with a shittier caption. 
---
Not really, because if it was there wouldn‚Äôt be loops on every map and there would be actual stealth besides Claudette‚Äôs p3 outfit. This game doesn‚Äôt have any elements of a stealth game besides a crouch button and the only way to really hide is to juke killers around an object 
---
It's dogshit.
---
Walk up to the lockers. You can interact with them, try it!
---
Best tactic is immediately purchase a perk to hasten the entity eating the other perk etc. Only works once you get 2 perks available on web
---
The gen got finished the smallest of moments before Kate got hit. 
---
Seriously? Do you have a link or the title of that video? I have to see this.
---
Well, if you can't loop and can't hit normal skill checks all the time it certainly seems that way.
---
Game balance for beginners and even average players is fucked, every potato Killer can 4K against players which don't have anything to prolong a chase. 
---
*BINGBONG*
---
The lighting of this photo made me think it was another Claudette, holy shit.
---
It‚Äôs a mechanic to fall back on to give you a chance when the killer has slaughtered the rest of your team. That mechanics still needs to have play and counterplay. To say the survivor is entitled to the hatch just because they‚Äôre the last alive and the killer got everyone else is like saying the exit gates and hatch should shut when three people escape just because the survivors had a good game. 
---
I‚Äôm not advocating for the hatch to be removed, but it should be a first come first serve mechanic. If the survivor finds it or gets there first, they jump in. If the killer gets there first, he can close the hatch. If they both get there at the same time, the killer closes the hatch or the survivor gets their shot at jumping in and hoping they don‚Äôt get grabbed. If the devs want a mechanic that gives the last survivor a chance, then it should be an equal playing field, not a free escape.
---
At least its not the fabled grey pallet
---
The survivors sit with him in a nice room and talk to him about all his problems. This is actually more terrifying now. I just imagine that soulless masked man stare at me from across the room. Not even responding to anything. I prefer running away in fear.
---
Nobel Prize, Otto.
---
I‚Äôve just played enough that I know where totems usually spawn with the exception of the Ormund Resort, so while everyone is doing gens, I break totems and I usually get 3-4 of them and find the last one with a gen or two left. 
---
I play this game a lot and i rarely and i mean rarely ever see a toxic 4 man squad. The odd teabagger sure but its really not that common. 
---
I dont believe youve had 7 games in a row of it unless your playing like a dick. 
---
Anyway if you want some tips against good survivors im open what arw you struggling with?
---
Did you just assume why I quit? I quit because I don't want to have free points to noobs who can't play the game without camping and tunneling. I'd rather spend my time against a good killer.
---
Take a break.
---
I've played for over 800 hours since October 2017, and this is my favourite multiplayer game. But despite this, I occasionally have to take a week to two off.
---
Does that mean your proposed buff only affects healing/mending other players and not yourself? Because you should specify that, it only says that the BPs are awarded for altruism.. 
---
Feng Ming*
---
And to be completely honest, once you have everybody‚Äôs teachables, every survivor is the same, so just pick the one you like the looks of. Since you just bought the game I‚Äôll assume you don‚Äôt have any teachables, and you‚Äôre running Lithe?
---
With Lithe just remember that you want to try to hit the window/pallet you‚Äôre vaulting square on so that you get a fast vault as opposed to a ‚Äúmedium vault.‚Äù Also remember that the killer can hit you as you‚Äôre vaulting, or grab you midway if you‚Äôre injured, so don‚Äôt depend on it if the killer is right next to you. Other than that just play some more and you‚Äôll pick up on how to play well. Don‚Äôt attempt escape when you‚Äôre on the hook, don‚Äôt fast vault or drop pallets if the killer isn‚Äôt near, etc.
---
All that aside, welcome to the community! :)
---
This is how Insidious was supposed to be used right?
---
He that was my post :). Never tought I would be this famous. OINK!

Once again hi. I am so famous!!! Oink

Plot twist: the class is just Michael Myers.
---
Small Billy is not sufficient anymore due to our most recent rule changes:
---
&gt; For non-text posts (e.g. images, memes), the rule of thumb is that the viewer should be able to immediately tell that the main focus is Dead by Daylight without reading the title of the submission.
---
Small Billy (or whatever portrait is chosen) does not count as "main focus of the post". 
---
The reason this repost is following the subreddit rules now is the caption edit, not the portrait.
---
I remember when I got this game when it was still quite new. First times I played with friends, none of us had much clue about what we were doing and after a few KYF games, I went into normal matchmaking and didn't get COMPLETELY annihilated at least if I remember correctly anyway.
---
I can understand that it's not a fun experience to play against people with dozens or hundreds of hours as a new player, but I also don't recommend going in matchmaking at first. If you have friends with the game, you should learn the ropes in KYF because it's absolutely 100% more fun to learn stuff there.
---
Maybe he got stuck on the tutorial?
---
It‚Äôs called Smol Billy.  &gt;.&gt;
---
Either that or they would just DC. Although the hatch sucks I understand it as 1 on 1 vs a killer no survivor is going to escape any other way. 
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Exactly he doesnt have a fucking counter, making him the worst designed killer in the game. 
---
Because of the caption. A few months ago, only graphic edits were considered "related to the game". We changed that rule lately so text edits or captions are also sufficient. 
---
Only referring to the game in the title is still prohibited, which is why the previous post has been deleted.
---
Let me show you a nice meme why survivors can't loop a killer for more than 15 seconds https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aa1nxz/great_meme_boys/
---
Wait, was this on Mount Ormond Resort??? I am 99% sure I was the Nurse, then. My PSN is Clopin09, lol.   
---
So for weaker killer survivors should start on the hook because hE iS wEaK
---
I absolutely agree, it is rare to find a good teammate that actually knows how to take a hit or do gens with the killer nearby. From my experience, I have found probably 10-15 decent players in my experience. (Ps4 OCE)
---
2nd achievement is literally impossible to achieve as it's the most difficult to pass off.
---
Fixed.
---
Already discussed in this subreddit and, for obviously reasons (basically "the game") wouldn't work... At least in my opinion.
---
Which leads me to another thing discussed here and with friends. Why "kill your friends" still exists? For practice?
---
This game needs a "crazy mechanics" mode where you can mix stuff, 2v8, killer playing survivor, etc.
---
I‚Äòm speechless 
---
lmao wtf
---
I, too, was newbie like you. But then I took a camper to the basement.
---
Don't forget running a killer for at least a minute or longer to finally be caught and you think 'huh why have no gens been done'. You look around to see the survivor auras and two of them are in a corner crouched and the other is staring at a wall intensely, those moment's I just have to laugh at now. 
---
So Billy was our savior all this time...
---
- after all this time?
---
- Always
---
I... don't follow what you're trying to say 2nd paragraph onward.

OP is upset because he wanted to do the hook save but a horrible Nea "stole" it from him

BOOP THR SNOOT!

Dbd unkept promise: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to rebalance some of the weaker characters/perks/aspects of the game!‚Äù
---
F13 unkept promise: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make it so when you left click, the game no longer blue screens your pc and fucks your mom 
---
Playing F13 on release and watching its downfall really put into perspective how bad things could be and has inspired a little more patience in DBD than I‚Äôd otherwise have 
---
Yeah I was wondering if people actually get mad with stealing save like seriously well thx
---
Someone is a bit salty about their in game experiences. I recommend playing a stronger killer (due to your perk selection), or using better perks that aren't for tracking.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA dbd violent XD 
---
There are other ways to solve these problems.  the hatch is lazy.
---
If you get facecamped and tunneled then your teammates are to be blamed. 
---
If a killer is facecamping a survivor the others should do generators. In the time it takes to finish a Survivor on a hook all 5 Gens can be done.
---
But of course,if your teammates are idiots and try to rescue you each time,then the killer does get more points.
---
But if they dont,then he gets more points by you killing yourself on the hook
---
Interesting, I feel the same about Nurse personally. I feel that I can never escape her and its literally the most unfun thing in the world. I can kinda outplay legion, but Nurse? Might as well just DC anyways imo.
---
Surprised it's not 69
---
I main Doc, Huntress, Hag and Trapper. I was switching up my killer for once
---
It‚Äôs actually very simple. It‚Äôs outside of my social norms. Therefore I have grown up with that being taboo. I‚Äôve also had it hammered in my head that gay is bad since I was old enough to understand what it was. Has that changed as I‚Äôve gotten older? Of course it has. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs perfect. Also I don‚Äôt really have to justify it. I‚Äôm not hurting anyone and it‚Äôs my right to think and say whatever the fuck I want. If I‚Äôm not hurting anyone just let it be and leave me alone I‚Äôm done talking about this.
---
Although, if you're chill enough the salt is pretty laughable, and I did meet a swf that I had a very good game with and they invited me to their Discord, and we play swf/customs and they're very lovely. Of course I had to Wade through a lot of salt to get there, but I never would have met them otherwise.
---
I find the hatch pretty sweet when im playing with complete nooblords as teammates. Only yesterday did i singlehandedly do 2 gens on my own from start to finish, and by the time I was done I was the only survivor left alive. How could teamwork have saved me there? It was my overly altruistic teammates that all killed themselves. I was the only productive member. I believe I earned the escape. 
---
&gt;killer perk.
---
(Õ° ¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)
---
ok
---
The last guy escaping feels like a loss.  
---
oh, btw. does anyone know what's up with Deranged Pursuit? is it just me or it doesn't work? I hate playing Legion but I was trying to farm for this achievement and after multiple downs in Frenzy I never got a single count. 
---
And immediately get hooked if the killer has a brain lol
---
I had this earlier when I had a legion daily and only used grey add-ons
---
I love that you can see the killers train of thought. ‚ÄúDid she just...no... well.. I better check just in ca- OH SHE DID.‚Äù
---
I did both. I'd down them without Frenzy and with when they had Deep Wound. seriously, not a single down counted. 
---
Welcome broether. Good luck
---
David is everyone‚Äôs daddy UwU 
---
Snap Out Of It isn't a healing action. If the perk says Healing than assume it's including healing yourself. Healing is healing. Mending is mending.
---
Meh, if you‚Äôre enjoying Legion, then I‚Äôm glad. 
---
The reason that I play video games is to have fun. I hope everyone else plays for the same reason. 
---
I mean I don¬¥t really mind. If  I tunneled or played a bad game from my own part I deserve to get tbagged I guess. I don¬¥t mind that really anymore. It¬¥s a good meme if a survivour stuns me with a pallet and tbags little because I run brutal strength so it¬¥s fine. After spirit fury I get my revenge ;D 
---
I only tbag fellow survivours because it¬¥s funny to mess around with them. Once I thought I saw one far away from me running to me. I waved at him and tbagged too because I wanted him to come and help me repair gens. Well turned out it was legion and I was disrespectful for no reason haha.
---
Nice, dude! 
---
You‚Äôre slowly turning into one of us. The collective group of people who have poured entirely too much of their lives into this game. 
---
Now, aim for 500!
---
Well if you don't change that mindset you will be one of those slugging try hard killers that people don't enjoy playing with and you will more likely not enjoy the game as hatch escapes are common. It's like people who will hatch standoff for ages just slap them and let the survivor go and move onto the next game as its really not worth it. 
---
Its boring to use them also
---
This is the first person I‚Äôve found on this sub who doesn‚Äôt despise legion and his players. Thank you, spread this positive attitude on. 
---
You are talking about what others need to do? But what should I do when I get face camped, camped, tunneled hardcore? Nothing. I care about my experience too. If I can't enjoy a game, I am quitting and I expect my teammates to quit too because 3 vs 1 is hard and why should you give points to that asshole anyway? If every survivor quits in games like this, there won't be any campers or tunnelers left in the game.
---
Fog maybe 
---
If so that's an epic fail since fog is 3 letters not 4 .
---
They usually say on their dev stream that they host every Thursday when events are gonna come out. They give dates most times but for this one they said ‚Äúend of January‚Äù so I‚Äôm gonna assume next Tuesday since that‚Äôs when updates come out.
---
The FO4 one was funny. Took 4 headshots to kill a man. Just like real life!
---
Actually Feng Min if youre gonna correct in the first place 
---
Along with that, if you are with one other person and get an exit gate open, LEAVE! For the same reason. That gives the last remaining survivor three escape routes instead of two. Two of which will be open already. They might be in a chase and desperately need it. They might be waiting for it. Etc. So many times I‚Äôll be in a chase waiting for the hatch, die, then spectate and see my fellow survivor waiting to teabag at the exit gate. So frustrating. Same goes if there‚Äôs three left and two at the exit gate. Four left and three at the exit gate. Etc. If you can help then help of course. Like if they‚Äôre already hooked or something. If not, leave. Please. 
---
Okay thank you!
---
If you don't restrict it to healing actions, which meaning isn't, and don't restrict it to altruistic actions only which healing yourself isn't... For what exact reason do you exclude snapping out of it? 
---
Soon the only scary thing will be a wheezy ass Michael stalking you from afar @_@
---
I'll be using Detective Hunch for a while just to learn the new spawn placements.
---
I don't feel like the aesthetic and tone of Telltale's Walking Dead really fits into this game. Left 4 Dead is also a zombie game, but it's more tonally consistant with the rest of this game.
---
Jesus christ that mouse is scary af, thank god is not a killer, I would panic every game against him
---
I like legion most dont get why people take this game so seriously 
---
how to make Entity consume Pink Moris? I aim for green add-ons ffs
---
Are there plans to change something ? Actually you have the choice to leave the hatch and do a generator ;)
---
This is outdated. The competing game is Last Year now. 
---
It‚Äôs not really ‚Äúyour save‚Äù in the first place. I‚Äôm sure the person hooked was happy anyone was unhooking them.
---
"Oh my god Michael is bigger than I thought!"
---
Agreed. As coming from both sides, I am confused how a rank 8 Feng min didn‚Äôt know about looking behind her. 
---
Kids started being able to graduate from kindergarten...that's what happened.
---
Good way to prevent that healing problem you have is to run at least one of the "Block" addons so the dream transition takes less time. Some of my best games were running 2 block addons (the purple and green for a total of 3.5 seconds less and they do stack even though the addon doesn't say so) So when you land your power they've got approximately 3.5 seconds(iirc) to finish what they're doing before they're at risk. You get a lot of really ballsy survivors who know it's supposed to take a long time and will finish what they're doing and are surprised when they're asleep in half the time.  
---
A good rule of thumb is to try to keep as many people in dream state as possible. If all 4 are asleep then they are forced to fail a skill check since only awake survivors can wake up sleeping ones. And utilize your terror radius to your advantage since you can see sleeping ones outside your radius. I use this to great effect in corn maps because if they're asleep I'll just go a way I know they didn't go and let their aura pop up and head that way. 
---
My favorite addons to run with Freddo is the Z Block (2 sec faster to fall asleep)/Paint Brush and the Pill Bottle (Survivors don't see you while falling asleep only once they're fully asleep) it really messes with a lot of people because they use the time and flashes of freddy to know where to run to and it takes both of those away from them. It's great for mind games and jump scares. 
---
 I just P2 Freddy and I still love him hope this helped you out
---
Ah, so they only put them in there for a red herring, got it.
---
They‚Äôre going to fuck you up, dude. 
---
Good god why do you think getting a 3K and 1 escaping via hatch is a loss? You get a ton of points for a hatch escape. You clearly won if that‚Äôs how the game ends. 
---
I never thought of using it like that
---
New killer perk: Assert dominance. 
---
It is without a doubt, way scarier. 
---
So essentially absolutely no way for a killer to prevent NOED from potentially being killed almost straight off the bat by someone cleansing that one totem that spawned next to the first gen they ran across?
---
Fine. But then allow me to remove survivor perks at random without them being able to counter it in any way.
---
Sounds like someone‚Äôs not enjoying their free weekend.
---
Better than having the game take for-fucking-ever with nothing happening because the last guy is trying to solo 3 more gens stealthily.
---
99‚ÑÖ of those hours were spent on the loading screens
---
Is this the "Do everything to get someone in the basement, then insidious camp them", or the "I only attack if you come down and interrupt my nap in the basement."?
---
Even if you can‚Äôt do it by clicking their name in the after-game lobby (it‚Äôs odd, sometimes it lets me and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt), you can still get to their profile via shift+tab and recently met players. 
---
What a valuable comment.
---
When you have pig trap on your head and other survivor just stands at the gate getting you killed.
---
Hell ya.  It really neutered me.  I couldn't tell if my 360's were working or if I was just a spinning moron
---
Im not sure about the mending aspect of it because i feel like we all know legion is gonna get some nerf soon and this might be to much.
---
+ it would make borrowed time and this an unthinkable combo
---
Im actually part in that group. My post is more about the tpose.
---
Im not expecting fear, but Killers possess barely any threat. Yes, they are obstacles, but once a player understands what to expect from each one, counterplay is immediately obvious. There should be a more inherent danger to killers.
---
Same, actually hooked a fair few baggers today (Huntress main) and they were good sports about it in the chat after. Killers who don't get offended can stay focused &amp; have fun. It's all still a game; point of a game is to have fun :)
---
Beware of the wayward etiquette code, whatever people say you have to do, ignore. Play how you want to play as long as it won‚Äôt get you banned. Just remember if you chose to play like a dick, you deserve the facecamp. 
---
You can keep playing Feng, but use the bloodpoints on other characters to unlock their teachable perks. 
---
it was the same for me when I started. you just get used to them. 
---
While I don't disagree, it's still in the game, and can help you win a game, which is what some people might care about if they're trying to get to Rank 1 for the achievement.
---
I used NOED on my climb to Rank 1 because I didn't have Ruin at the time (bought Hag when on sale), and at red ranks people gen rush the absolute shit out of you.
---
I mean, yeah, doing gens is the whole point of a survivor, but too many games basically had survivors who would all take a separate gen, so even if you downed and hooked someone within the first 30 seconds to 1 minute of the game's start, and didn't get D-Striked, you would probably still lose 2 gens by the time you got into your second chase, and then lose another 2 gens by the time you ended the second chase because whatever gen that person was working on got picked up by another survivor, and the unhooked survivor and their rescuer murdered another gen.
---
Games at red ranks have a tendency to end REALLY fast if you're not able to apply massive pressure across the whole map, unless the survivors are just playing like idiots.
---
I mean, getting to Rank 2 was a fucking nightmare, and then the game that actually got me to Rank 1 was a Myers' game where I managed to yoink someone off a gen at Tier 1 with M&amp;A, basement them, and then all 3 other survivors just kept trying to basement dive and I was just chain hooking all of them until I got Tier 3 and got all of them.
---
Still mostly positive, so.... It's on par with Freddy rework, for importance. 
---
&gt;scared of sharp objects.
---
Must be UK.
---
What a valuable post.
---
That‚Äôs crazy though how I had four games in a row like that lol.
---
Sometimes I really miss the times where we had no post game chat. I know that I could just turn it off, but I'm just too curious. 
---
lmao so true
---
Adding snapping out of it to the list would also make the perk better so there's that... 
---
No one left behind has the theme of only boosting altruistic actions atm and imo its good when a perk has something unique to it.
---
The original numbers are 4/8/12%. So by increasing them to 25% at max is plenty buff already and it keeps the unique trait of the perk. 
---
Man she looked at you all disappointed like "man, its so obvious she's in there. i really don't wanna kill her i feel so bad" LMAO. I do that all the time as killer
---
Insidious camping best camping 
---
Don't worry about it. They've been doing this for awhile now and it's only brought more players to the game. 
---
I mean you did die, perhaps the game is right
---
:3
---
Then you do the escape daily but it doesn't give you the bp anyway because it's bugged so you just give up.
---
SCP secret laboratory had this "feature" for a long time.
---
It truly is terrifying. Scary killers are a lot more scary when they don't telegraph any moves, and operate as an emotionless, unexausting machine. 
---
Also not to mention a soft counter to DS
---
welcome, but i got 1300hrs in DBD, and hopefully players from now on will get less abused. yes abused is the right word here.
---
\*\* Tee Hee\*\*
---
It be cool to see something new and innovative 
---
Tru3talent on YouTube is currently on the road to rank 1 with no perks or add ons as both survivor and killer. So there‚Äôs that.
---
Check out the Youtube tutorials,there are tons of them by various known DbD Players. Thats how i learned it. 
---
But dont expect much out of it, a 360 wont work against good killers
---
I was 100% ready to write Ru a strongly worded letter when she told Latrice to shantay. I can't believe they brought her back, literally the least impressive queen all season smdh 
---
I once had it spawn on a dull totem I was mid way cleansing. I was so confused at first.

As a Legion main, I'd say just. Try to dodge while he's frenzied, because when the frenzy ends, he gets stunned and stares at his feet for a few seconds. At that point, break line of sight, hide in grass, behind obstacles, etc. That's the best way to get away from a Legion. A smart one won't keep trying to look for you, cos Legion works best constantly moving.
---
What are totems? Bought the gane today
---
I'm playing around with boil over. My plan is to level jake and get sabateur for my kate. I have tested it with a toolbox and destroying hooks then running to a corner away from other hooks unsabataged makes kate kind of a "tank" build since you can keep the killer busy while friends fix generators. You still get a decent chunk of blood points but it has worked well so far for me.
---
That's really the only perk that synergizes with boil over other than decisive strike and being able to pick yourself up from the dying state if the killer leaves you on the ground.
---
Still testing it but so far it is working pretty well. My buddy plays david who is injured with buffs to his action speed while injured. So as long as I keep the killer off him he fixes generators pretty quick
---
I don't know, that felt like a bit much to me. It's clear the Devs don't want to do that either or they already would have.
---
This sounds incredible! It's so innovative seems to be really well balanced (some number changes might need to be altered but concept wise it's perfect)
---
When I first started playing the game, I used both SP and DH, and wondered why I couldn't use both. Figured out why eventually, but yeah 
---
I like that idea of a sneakier killer, and I don't just say that as someone that spent most of their time playing Pig. Maybe heartbeat doesn't start until you spot them, letting the Legion get closer, making survivors need sight lines above the heartbeat warning. For a weakness, maybe something akin to the Legion's frenzy in its current state? Multiple stabs needed to down the survivor. But that sorta opens itself to the painful experience of like, even more chases. Maybe sell the idea of the Legion not being prepared for this? Something like the Nurse's looking down after a teleport, with the Legion stopping to catch their breath and panicking a little after they attack someone. There's a little giggle or a chuckle, and they get back to their job.
---
For a potential mechanic... Multiple roaming Legions would be pretty spooky. One could feasibly imagine something like, bonus Legions that  act as lookouts. Only one is being tested today, the others are there to judge them as they go about their grim task. Survivors get heartbeat off the rest of the gang, and if they get spotted the player playing the killer gets an alert to the new victim's location with like, idk, a whistle or something. They'll move out the player's way to keep things fair, but act as a bonus source of heartbeat/get counted as the killer for perks and stuff. Creepy idle animations as the rest of the Legion play with their knives. The player gets too used to one being nearby and the heartbeat, goes back to working, never notices today's killer sliding on up behind them.  
---
Tbf the Legion Trailer made me think "Shapeshifter", but I don't think that would really be that different mechanically from Pig Crouch/Wraith Bell.
---
A school in the Netherlands. I was making my homework at the same time. 
---
Probably because hiding in a locker stops your madness from going up
---
The nurse has counterplay
---
Not as much as the other killers but more than the legion.
---
Oh. I honestly thought my sleep deprivation was making me crazy for not being able to read those words. 
---
If someone is being camped with gates open, that means the killer didn't do well throughout the game. The problem is that most survivors don't understand this- they're not being toxic, just securing a kill. Yes, borrowed time can get you a cheeky save, but also not saving them is not a bad thing. It's just that survivors are angry and salty so they'll get mad at you if you don't save them. I personally wouldn't mind dying on the hook to a camping killer once the gates are powered.
---
Apart from that example, borrowed time will not help as much as we'll make it. When I'm in swf I constantly hear my friends saying "ayyyyy" because I've got we'll make it, whilst the other guy with borrowed who rushes for hook saves just does nothing to speed up the game. Healing times are really important at high ranks for keeping pressure. Borrowed Time is just for people who want to unhook almost instantly right Infront of the killer, which is why it got nerfed.
---
Challenge yourself... To get BP ?? Hello??
---
Story: Me and friends did a kyf match and I was the killer. After we were done, my friend asked me where my ruin was and i showed him. Then he said "It is not lit" and he sent me a shot from his view (right). He couldn't see that my Totem was lit like it was on my screen (left)
---
Good or bad?
---
Lithe and BL can be a good combo :) But you can't combine anything with SB :D
---
Was playing solo survivor against a wraith running ebony mori. Wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the loading screen and was the first survivor to get hooked (after looping him for 3 gens). Dude tunnels me for an extensive amount of time right after the unhook, much to my confusion (at the sheer length of this tunnel before i saw the Mori at the end screen) and saltiness, but thankfully my other 3 teammates were all SWF with anti hemorrhage syringes, and all of them literally did their damnedest to make sure I lived
---
Added them all and we had some real good subsequent games :-)
---
So, you don't want anyone to take a hit for you on your way out?
---
Out of all the things in this game you want to teach him how to be a pussy.
---
There‚Äôs typically a lot of bugs in KYF so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs just exclusive to that mode 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias
---
**Confirmation bias**
---
Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.

---
Very much so. I'm a novice on playing Nurse but this was satisfying.
---
Not sure if its just related to bloodlust or just because her speed is increasing.
---
Wonder if that effect could be achieved with lower levels of bloodlust and perks that affect movement speed. 
---
I like M&amp;A, Ruin OR Noed (you can probably get a grab from ruin), Remember Me and then a flex last perk. I don't take a pallet perk but you for sure can. 
---
I tend to cut chases a lot more and go for the surprise attacks. You can slug your obsession to get stacks fast, if you slug I'd say take Sloppy but you don't need to. But as the other guy said Discordance is good; haven't gotten to try it out yet though but it sounds legit. I imagine it might be good in finding your obsession if you run RM. 
---
Bamboozle is okay since it's Lerys and you might want to cut off the library loop. But if they try to loop you there you're better off going for a surprise attack. My last perk is usually Blood Warden just for insurance but tbh it never pays off.
---
It seemed to kick in after Bloodlust 2, I dont know if that's faster than PlayWithYourFood 3 Stacks but it never happens with that perk.
---
You forgot the part where they shrug off mortal injuries because of "adrenaline". Having read all of them, the only one where that's even remotely plausible (I use that word loosely) is Ticci Toby.. Because that's actually a Slenderman story.
---
It's still edgy, self-insert BS though.
---
This.Like do they really expect me to save them when we got shitted on and have 4 gens left?If it‚Äôs their first hook I‚Äôll always save them anyways but damnnn it really sucks when you find hatch and the killer finds you before your teammate dies... 
---
So you want another decisive strike? 
---
Each level of bloodlust adds 0.2m/s, which is the exact same as each stack of Play With Your Food(at tier 3).  
---
Yeah seriously, how‚Äôd that happen? No doubt you got a good chainsaw from the start but you‚Äôre at red ranks, you ain‚Äôt playing against Noobs. How‚Äôd the die? 
---
It would be amazing on characters like wraith, billy, and spirit who can traverse the map quickly 
---
Dude i thought a huntress was getting her hatchet daily, and they really sucked so I felt bad and stuck around once the exit gates were opened for them to get their hatchets in, like i literally stood and stared at them as they hit me while my teammates left.
---
They fucken hooked me and then told me in the after game chat that I deserved it for not leaving. 
---
I dont even mind dying, its the attitude that got me, like im sorry for trying to do you a favor
---
Might've been afk 
---
Had it happen to me yesterday. I wish more people knew the hook signals, I was spamming unhook and a guy came running straight for me and we both ended up on hook. The other two got it after that and they got away. This doesn't work in swf though, so I don't really mind it.
---
i kind of want to see this bs too 
---
When u play bloody serial killer but get offended by croutching, lmao nice one 
---
beyond the fact that this is nearly illegible if im understanding it correctly its an almost objectively way better version of pop goes the weasel.
---
Instead of boycotting matches and ruining the game for people who enjoy it, why don‚Äôt you just sell the game and move onto something else that won‚Äôt make you rage quit
---
I like perk counters like rancor or enduring and using positioning like trapping people in a corner or making them fall down the basement to fuck people using ds, but I can't stand people who dribble...
---
Playing against him is just like playing against doctor. Both aren‚Äôt good killers but they make the game take absolutely forever and are just really annoying. I would never DC just because of a certain killer but I can see why people would 
---
NOED and DS shouldn't be in the game and reward Bad Players Change my mind
---
Yikes.
---
Whispers or BBQ and chili usually do the trick
---
Wraith's dual-bladed axe that is also a skull and spine that he straight up tore out of a dude's body in a fit of vengeful rage has gotta be one of my favorites, what an awesome fuckin weapon.
---
I cleanse all dull totems if i can. The problem is, usually killers who run NOED are not that good with map pressure/chases = team does gens before i even get all totems (since no one else goes for em).
---
Well, Im about to reach my 800 hours, but congrats anyways, I cant even remember my 200 h
---
omg the devs don't cater to new players? ugh the killer is sooo op... Yeah i only have 1.2 hours why? honestly most people just think if a game isn't automatically easy that it's bad. I have nearly 850 hours in fortnite and i recently just permanently quit because of the constant catering to newer players by nerfing strats that take skill, plus the fact that epic games seems to be much more involved in creating new 20$ skins every 2 days than fixing game breaking glitches with their game. This is what is driving most of the long time players like myself away and as long as they're getting mommy's credit card number from a bunch of 12 year olds they just dont care
---
Yeah in the beginning it's tough as fuck though for survivors. The concept of looping isn't something that comes naturally for most people. So the only things they know is staying hidden and running in a straight line towards a pallet.
---
I used to play that game a lot, it was one of those roblox games that were pretty well made. If that game was the real dead by daylight, then the killer would have no chance at winning at higher ranks, but I had a lot of fun in the game since I always won because other people just didn't know what they were doing.
---
She is a top tier killer in the right hands. Her perks are really good too. 
---
I would recommend buying the DLC for sure. 
---
Her perks are okay.
---
Her power is really good. It can apply good pressure and makes chases impossible if you learn how to use it well
---
&gt;I just imagine that soulless masked man stare at me from across the room.
---
Isn't that how Michael works in game?
---
No, what you're saying is just not true. It's complete nonsense, so I can say nothing more than that it is false. Gens do not get completed in every game regardless of skill. Especially if you play killers like Hilbilly or Nurse. You're statement has no proof.
---
How were the survivors toxic tho? By running a situational perk that doesnt usually pay off?
---
I just do it because I‚Äôm bored lol and need a button to push. 
---
Well, I love Slashermovies and I'm a lil' gore whore when it comes to stuff like this. However, I'm still incapable of seeing even little amounts of blood in reality (especially my own) without fainting. Getting my blood tested is always gonna be fun for the whole medic team. Ever wondered why you need to wait this long at the doc? Yeah, because I'll block this treatment room for the next hour because I'm unable to stand up.
---
So... don't know about this one. 
---
Same boat here. I started playing Killer and I'm in love. How's survivor?
---
Yes it was!
---
The generally accepted form of communication, which has been in place pretty much since the game came out, is that flailing hands = camping... Just because one player wants flailing to mean they're good to be rescued doesn't mean that's "correct." Most people who have been playing for a while or are familiar with the game use this same system, so playing by different rules is basically asking not to get saved.
---
Yeah, and I got stomped as Nurse, so she must be shit tier.
---
What is tbagging  considered in this game? Seen it being used a lot on this sub but i have in all honesty, no clue what it actually means in game.
---
The hooks were the most brutal, it looks fucking awfull having that hook shoved trough your sholder on a daily basis
---
I feel she‚Äôs to young ?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
He didn't have dying light. The obsession had dstrike tho. And what i meant as tunneling i meant tunneling as in if he got off hook he got chased after.
---
I miss being an innocent player so much
---
They need to change the second one. 
---
You seem upset at someone having a different opinion than you. Maybe you should take a break from this subreddit :)
---
You‚Äôll get a lower ranked killer at least, and lots of people to unhook! 
---
Not gonna lie. If that happened  me, I wouldn't even be mad.  
---
But they'll take it like the champs they are! Just got stabbed by several centimetres of hygienic questionable metal? Gotta lift the same fated dude off this thing real quick!
---
Yes, and now we get hit while dropping it when it shouldnt, thx devs
---
I would imagine that not being able to raise a value higher than a certain number makes that number the cap.
---
Why?
---
Do it
---
A soft cap maybe, but not a hard cap
---
You probably have the expectation that you have to kill all survivors and if you don't achieve it, you think you lost or as you said, you are not in control. I had a game last night as a Killer, didn't kill anyone, but hooked a lot and you know what? It was a blast playing that match. Probably that helps a bit. And the other think is ... maybe the survivors were pretty good, because you do have a chance to win the game.

The Hun-T-ress

I think the licensing issues are what killed it.
---
I guess he didnt see the 18+ mark
---
I mean ds is pretty toxic. In saying this I‚Äôll either get a ton of down votes a ton of upvotes or it‚Äôll remain neutral. 
---
Why does this game just ATTRACT the gay crowd? Scientists EXPLAIN?
---
He probably got morid on the first round and said fucc it
---
It's even harsher when they left the remnants of their future content in the game if you were patient enough to work your way through the virtual cabin and had teased a new game mode for the survivors.
---
They basically gave you a small taste of the future content but because of the lawsuit they were forced to scrap everything, only being allowed to bug fix the game.
---
The developers for the game abandoned ship and it's just the publisher updating the game with bug fixes.
---
Well done, my apprentice. 
---
Angry birds is way more violent 
---
Normally this is because one guy is running Ace in The Hole + Plunderer's Instinct (and possibly Pharmacy for the search speed boost and Open Handed for the range boost on Plunderers, but honestly you're better off taking two survival perks instead), and is running around looting for everyone and supplying their teammates.
---
Feel like I've seen this on here before
---
Danggg you played for like 17 hours a day
---
This meme is incorrect.
---
You get points for struggling, so why give them up?
---
I wouldn't follow my own perk build because I'm bad at mechanics and chasing through loops is a weakness of mine personally.  
---
But I use, Barbecue and Chili, Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound, and swap between Remember Me an Discordance. 
---
Usually Remember Me is pretty legit if you can find your obsession and get those stacks, just remember to kill them before the last gen so the rest of the team is forced to go through that extra gate time. 
---
I like the sloppy/bloodhound combo because it makes tracking them super easy (more blood and turns the blood neon) if they lose you in corn maps or other high foliage you can follow blood instead of scattered scratch marks.  
---
I had another bug happen with Ruin, I had the status/totem effect whatever appear on the right side of my screen that said Ruin. However, afterwards it remained and I kept getting skill checks in white instead of red that when I hit, it acted like normal generator progression. The weird thing is, there was a person on a generator next to me and they WERE getting the effects of Ruin so idk.
---
Go on...
---
It was a joke, idk why you are comparing our comments. And as an fyi older posts are more likely to have more upvotes anyway.
---
Welcome \^\^ I don't think anyone has mentioned this yet but if you haven't played the tutorial for killer and survivor go DO IT It's an easy way to earn free 50k bloodpoints (25k from each).
---
It‚Äôs, what, 500 points for a full struggle?  Not even a fifth the cost of the cheapest nodes on a bloodweb.  Even if someone was so selfish that those 500 points were worth more to them than letting an ally get the 7,000 for escaping, they‚Äôd be better off just not struggling and using their time to get into the match quicker quicker and earn points there.
---
r/notreally saying something like that is more cringe than actually playing fortnite. Its okay dude after playing for 10 years I've heard every insult and plus im the best so nothing really you can say to insult me and plus its the internet so i can say whatever i want and you wont do nothing about LOL so no point in arguing with a champion
---
I hate you so much!
---
love reading funny stuff like this
---
What? The majority of the raimimemes subreddit wouldn't understand a dbd reference
---
Didnt she grow up with her mother alone?
---
I think the Photo got stolen, would make sense
---
More and more people forget you can disable the post-game chat
---
I normally get around 800 or so for struggling right to the end I believe. And if the other survivor can use that time to loose the killer then great. If they get caught then they were going to get caught anyway.
---
slap there any other killer but Nurse and Huntress and you got yourself a deal 
---
It is 800 something for a full struggle.
---
I'll never understand why people insist on doing that, like they're some badges of honor or something. 
---
Traps don't activate if survivors are in the dying state.
---
Anyway, 75% of the times I used it I either finished the match before the 5th gen is done or the survivors destroyed my totems before I could use it.
---
I prefer playing with 4 perks that I will use rather than 3 and a maybe.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you can use it if you want but after a certain amount of hours you‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs not that good. Just look at the streamers‚Ä¶ nearly none of them use noed because you don‚Äôt need it to win even if they have DS or whatnot.
---
But they do once the survivor stands up. I'm not suggesting that the timer starts ticking while they're downed. 
---
Welcome to the fog. I am happy to see this community grow. 
---
yeah, I agree with your description. but want to add not only skill she needs but also brain. you can't afford 28 stab wounds and you can't just bluntly memorize the mechanical side of her power.
---
and people who say Beads are op are damn idiots. not only two perks that counter it, you can also hear her footsteps in phase(grass and beards - weak counter upclose but can also save your booty if you see them on the distance). 
---
no I actually want post game chat. A lot of the time I just want to say gg but i'm sad to see they are set to private.  whether it's win or lose some matches are still very fun and awesome stuff happen in them and it's sad when you can't celebrate that with the others.
---
I agree on rancor. I'm almost always the obsession so I usually go up against it. I have not died to that perk once and it's so obvious when the killer's running it. Like ok cool, just dont be the one to open the door this round. Horrible perk.
---
Oh no. Not the bunnies. I'm sad now
---
It‚Äôs also a way of saying; ‚Äòstop being a tunnelling twat.‚Äô
---
PG 13 dbd
---
Cool. If playing for 10 years makes you a god, what does playing for 25 make me? 
---
They should buff Kindred to be able to see the Killer ANYWHERE in the Basement, and maybe a 15-25% slower Hook Regression? It‚Äôd be a nice counter to Basement Camping.
---
Wait what
---
It's not tunneling if you see a survivor saving another. I'm supposed to ignore them?
---
See that's why im better then everyone else because of losers like you always playing for fun and that causes players like me to lose on team based games that's why i don't play survivor you're the reason why people who actually want to win and not be a fucking loser casual play on teams because they can play with other winners.  
---
Immunity frames only happen on the unhooked survivor. Not the unhooker.
---
"Too many zombies" üòÇ
---
At the moment I am on my way to bring every killer and every survivor to level 40 for the perks. And I made myself use the character I am leveling so I can learn this character and try to get the adapt achievement. I haven't started to level nurse (because I already got nurses calling) and save her for last. But since I got some of the same problems with Huntress/ Spirit/ Hillbilly this might help:
---
Try to focus on the things you achieved. So instead of: "Shit everyone escaped again, I am so bad" it would be something like: "I used my power more often this game and it was harder for everyone to escape than last game". This + easily achieveable minigoals will keep you motivated. Because a "Yeah I did it" for a small goal achieved, is more likely to keep you motivated than a "Shit I failed again" for a big goal missed.
---
Lmao I just follow them from behind until they spot me, it's fun.
---
I laughed way too hard at this shit lmao
---
Propper placing would be a much better fix.
---
Let's start by not having totems that spawn within 2m of a gen.
---
I wasnt aware you could mend others.
---
Probably lf. He has the chainsaw but without doom engravings you'll be hard pressed to get any hits on good survivors unless they get caught out. At the end of the day he has no map pressure, just like Michael or clown but with a significantly worse power. I know how triggered people get when you talk about personal experience but I've played a lot of lf and had better results with freddy than him.
---
It works eh. Usually they‚Äôre so focused on the hatch you can even cleanse all dulls in case of NOED, then rapid pop remaining gens.
---
I get what you mean here. When I talk about ds I am typically talking about ds users, it inflates your ego and makes you more cocky. Something that allows you to be cocky makes you toxic, is what I‚Äôm trying to say. 
---
you try versing a rank1 p3 5-blink nurse with ruin/noed/haunted grounds/myc + ebony mori and say that.
---
If you learn her it is a lot of fun but the Forst games will be hard for you. When u can play her the mindgames etc are a nice change to the other Killers. 
---
And he played for over 9 hours lol
---
This exactly, I'd rather them put more resources into new killers. They've been delaying freddy and look at the killer we got, legion, and everyone likes say what they think about him.
---
It's a broken game mechanic to counter a broken perk.
---
Yeah that and having them spawn a certain distance away from survivor spawns. I donno it doesnt bother me since I rarely play killer but I do agree this is an issue that needs to be fixed.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I cant because I'm on console and dont have enough time to get to rank one. I was just getting at that I get totem spawns suck and I feel the other sides pain.
---
Its hilarious when they keep trying to blind after failing. A good survivor will only get hit once cause of lightborn, shit ones will die still trying to blind
---
If you feel down or someone called you a bad name just look at the messages, where you totally DESTROYED the salty one
---
good mod :)
---
Well its not. The last survivor getting the hatch is hardly a win for them
---
Let me guess are you in green rank ? Becouse if it is than it explains a lot
---
Dude, this legion chased me and only me for the whole game just so that he can rancor me. Right from gen 1 to gen 5. What a pathetic loser.
---
What's wrong with dribbling?
---
all the higher ranks will come back to the lower ranks, had a 4 man swf where 2 had more than 4k hours tell me I'm sweaty while they were sabotaging hooks in my face as I carried someone
---
Survivors with DS should feel lucky when they get dribbled. There‚Äôs times where I won‚Äôt pick them up at all. 
---
Last I checked OP means over powered. If there are 5 totems on a map and 4 survivors, each survivor has to cleanse 1.33 totems. If you‚Äôre telling me that is difficult, you may not be as optimal as you think. If an ability can be negated entirely it can‚Äôt be called op. Both noed and ds are far from op, and can easily be taken care of. Small game, detectives hunch, and maps only make it easier to find totems. Just as enduring, and unnerving presence help counter ds. Things that are OP don‚Äôt have counter play, that‚Äôs what nobody understands. everyone likes to complain instead of changing their perks or changing the way they play slightly to get rid of what‚Äôs bothering them.
---
1 down vote = 1 bad killer/survivor
---
Did you wiggle ?
---
Claudettes face 
---
Yeah, SWF group earlier today, had a leatherface do this to us. We literally rushed all 5 gens by the time our guy down there died. Sucked for him, but killer literally walked out with maybe 1-2 items worth of bloodpoints.
---
Good in a hyper altruistic pug group, otherwise? poop tier
---
Are you actually including green ranks in your 'easy 4k' ranks? You honestly think there is a big difference between red ranks and green ranks?  
---
It's just time invested per rank reset. Most of the people in green ranks have been red rank countless times.
---
I wish this trend would end
---
Sounds good but devs don't give us free legacy sadly 
---
You died against a rank 14 hag with doo doo perks and add ons. Meanwhile u had DS, a map offering, and a toolbox. You gotta uninstall lmfaooooo smh
---
Therapy by Daylight
---
Still blocked ? How did it end ?
---
I hell have special place for you
---
The Issue is,most or atleast alot of Legacy Players would be upset because their Legacy Clothing loses its status.
---
I wouldnt mind the change,however i think it would be smarter if the Devs add some different unique Sets for Devotion 10
---
I have this issue pop up fairly often when playing Solo Survivor and SWF.   So whenever i play SWF I always tell everyone to just bust every totem, stops noed and hits bugged Ruin totems.  Win Win.
---
Wraith is not a weak killer and definitely doesn‚Äôt need mori....
---
Can also click the settings gear icon and the farthest right tab has all 4 survivors profiles linked.
---
I guess this was the most frustrating moment I ever had on DBD. Trap on the head, waiting by the hatch and this fucking Dwight tbagging at the gate, pig came, hooked me and he left.
---
Not sure where you live, but I'm fairly sure that's illegal, and could get them in legal trouble if you were inclined.
---
It was. It gave me a chuckle myself, especially seeing it from a survivor's perspective!
---
My favourite DLC character is the Spirit, but since she's not licensed, you can unlock her with blue shards, like I did. ;)
---
I read reddit on the way to work fam and this t posing Huntress made me laugh hysterically about causing me to have a motor vehicle accident
---
The correct answer is actually [this watch](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/0/02/FulliconAddon_pocketWatch.png?version=cc6b5c88ca50a8d922deb2e09fede718)
---
Looping was not ORIGINALLY intented, but the devs liked it and instead chose to make balance decisions around it, they nerfed dribbling instead of stopping it from happening in the first place.
---
If dribbling is an exploit, so is looping, or moonwalking to hide the red stain.
---
(No, I don't think any of these is an exploit, and anyone who does is an asshat)
---
The swing-bug has already been fixed I'm pretty sure.
---
Only once I‚Äôve seen that happen, and it was glorious. Killer hit a survivor about 2 seconds after it cleansed. Tbf the killer took it like a champ and didn‚Äôt dc so respect to them. 
---
Good Try
---
Laughing so much reading his comment üòÇ
---
I had a 3v1 5 gens on the game yesterday. Safe to say we didn‚Äôt win. 
---
Really I mostly get killers that act like a ass to me. A killer sent me and my friend a message after we beat him saying we sucked and he let us go and showed me his ruin and blah blah 
---
sounds like a mom
---
Norman Bayes from Psycho, would be cool to get a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù character as a killer.
---
I feel most ppl even though they say they hate it love it just so they can post it on Reddit lol
---
Posting this again, as it wasn't flared and removed.
---
The 'sharp objects are more offensive than guns' thing probably says something about desensitisation.
---
It's like 80% timing, the "quality" of the spin itself makes very little diffetence.
---
Pick part 3 Jason with a spear and slash. 
---
Still remember when Deathgarden had it's free week and there were a bunch of replies from people who said they hated asymetrical games.
---
???
---
It shows recent review scores and will often show a warning of potential review bombing if a game suddenly recieves a huge influx of negative reviews.
---
They‚Äôre the skulls you can find around the map. If the killer has a hex perk, one of the totems will light up (some candles will be underneath it)
---
If, as a survivor, you cleanse those totems, the killer will lose that perk. 
---
Big "oof" after seeing everyone's score.  
---
I have been the 1 BP player multiple times though.
---
It's called a perk. you use them on your character to help you kill people or survive being killed.
---
See you in the fog. 
---
No offense at all, but i think you should grow up a bit to get a better perspective on life. 
---
Welcome! Nice to know someone at the same age have a similar experience with the game :) never had much interest in playing games like this, but got it when it was free on ps plus and have been playing it on a daily basis ever since. It‚Äôs a huge surprise for me because I usually don‚Äôt play any games for longer than a month or so. 
---
Ruin (if it's the only hex in the killer build) has fixed spawn areas anyway since the last totem rework.
---
On the Pale Rose you just need to do check one wall of the map (the one near the boat and the pier).
---
On Azarov's Resting Place it's always on the side with the killer shack
---
On Suffocation Pit it's always on the side of the mine.
---
On Coal Tower it's always on the left side of the tower looking at it from the center of the map.
---
I hope they fix this with the next patch...
---
It would, legacy players had to go through a huge grind to get a full set. Bloodwebs were bigger at every level, no tier 1 perks were given for free when starting a new character/prestiege etc. If you wanted legacy, you have to have played the game and prestieged your character to P3 before the end of 2016. 
---
Giving away prestiege to players now would definitely cancel out the reward early players got for grinding like hell early on. So face it, not gonna happen.
---
I'm all for devotion rewards, but they should not be legacy clothing, but something new, since the same legacy clothing would definitely make the already-earned legacy sets worthless. 
---
It doesn't really matter that devotion also takes a lot of time and some rewards would be nice, but legacy is not the way to go.
---
Something something too hard to deal with. Honestly I think powering the two exit gates was a good comprimise since it gives you two points to exit instead of one but those points are a lot easier to defend. It's maybe a bit hard to deal with against supressed Terror Radius killers like Pig/Wraith/Myers, but you can still see them and that's the natural danger of supressed TR killers. I think if the exit gates opened faster (50% faster?) it would be perfectly fair.
---
DBH- You cry because of your choices
---
DBD- You cry because of your teammates' choices
---
And get a lot of pleasure from sending the killer messages after saying GG Rekt.
---
I decided to play Trapper and mix it up a bit because I've started streaming and people will get sick of watching Fred, and I was flashlit, body blocked and bullied out of the game by an swf team. One of them then sent me a message asking how I was rank 10. 
---
*sigh*
---
Yeah, screen shot or record your own screen.  
---
As a killer main, we are just going through trials like everyone else. POSs like that ruin the game. Please report them.
---
Let all your friends die and escape through the Hatch so that they can't activate NOED #BigBrainPlays
---
Definitely just for her perks. All 3 perks are extremely powerful top tier perks and massively change the game.
---
Spirit Fury: coupled with Enduring lets you counter pallets. This is insanely god-tier levels of perks even if you have to couple it with Enduring for the full effect. 
---
Haunted Ground: protects Ruin for longer and allows you to get an instant down for 60 seconds. Another incredibly powerful perk that massively helps mid-tier Killers.
---
Rancor: finally a psuedo perk counter to DS. 
---
I intend to run Tinkerer, BBQ, Rancor, and Monitor and Abuse. Currently have BBQ and Rancor, waiting on the Bloodweb to finish my build.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure after this he went and soaked his eyes with holy water and prayed for forgiveness with his family 
---
(Issa joke people... I know it‚Äôs 2019 so I have to claim it as a joke)
---
I don't know what ruin has to do with it lol Ruin is a meta perk and I run it on every killer except the nurse and billy because my map control is already strong enough, but even if you're not using it, how is that an excuse for dribbling? 
---
These are all meta perks. NOED loses it‚Äôs quality rapidly as you rank further up.
---
For me it‚Äôs usually after a week that things are back to normal. After December‚Äôs rank reset I wasn‚Äôt able to play for 2 weeks, then the next time I logged in I double pipped so many times as a survivor and generally had a good time. Come this month‚Äôs reset and I‚Äôm raging again, nothing but tunneling, face camping and team mates who are completely useless. (I had one sneaking up to save me like the killer was Hag, but it was a Huntress who was miles away from the hook... I was like WTF are you waiting for?!!)
---
Welcome! I first played this back when it was first released. Didn‚Äôt really think I was going to enjoy it so I got a refund. A couple months later, I decided to re-buy and try it out again and I am thankful I did because I am hooked! 
---
What a perfect april fools opportunity tho. Behaviour could replace all the weapons with rubber chickens for a day and cite this review 
---
Rancor is the epitome of a pity kill. No counter and a reward for playing badly the whole game
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Imagine how that review would've been if there was a killer that had a gun with a bayonet attached
---
Stop with the "People said he was weak before and now they say he is OP lmao make up your minds", stop with that shit. That was our first impression. After people learned and saw more of legion, we realized he has no counter play, takes no skill, and is unfun to play as or against. I don't agree with people quitting, but legion is just an ass killer to play against.
---
It‚Äôs the closest thing to spies vs mercs I‚Äôm ever going to get, love the game just wish it was more balanced. 
---
Hey, the artwork is from Injustice 2, the character being the Scarecrow.
---
If they did that, the perk would be too close to what aftercare does, which is why I just run aftercare instead of bond and empathy 
---
Just wait for a week or so and things will get back to normal because the majority of people are where they‚Äôre supposed to be, rank wise. The past week was horrible but after playing a few games yesterday, i was actually having fun again! For me a win is when I get my precious BP, it‚Äôs nice to escape but not a must.
---
Well done
---
Yes 
---
I've been getting every color of the rainbow in red ranks. Matchmaking is messed up right now.
---
That‚Äôs true. I just usually have a team that does all the saving and I typically do gens so I usually never have a use for aftercare. 
---
Aftercare 
---
Enduring on Huntress. Gets stunned with DS, survivor runs ten feet away then is smacked down with a hatchet.
---
True story btw
---
Her perks are good. Spirit fury is great, especially on killers with no counter to looping. Haunted grounds is ok, works very well in a totem build (ToTH, Ruin, Haunted Grounds + perk of your choice). Rancor counters DS but is pretty scummy.
---
Please see my reply to the above user 
---
What are these people doing wrong? It's easy to ay with him. Too easy. 
---
I can see were you are coming from; a skill that makes Survivors instantly stop moving *seems* a bit OP.
---
The mechanic is actually simple to deal with though; it's just something we're not used to in the game, and that's why I think it's innovative. So what should we do, then?
---
What you would have to do is make sure you're not looking directly at the Killer, and if you do, there's actually a margin of a second/half a second to look away, and also if The Scarecrow is not using **Fear of Sight**, then you will never get stunned. It also has a cooldown and the gap you have to look around would be his heartbeat. If his heartbeat can be heard, than it means that he's not using **Fear of Sight** and that's a good moment to peep around.
---
I would love to hear some more of your feedback thought, so we can discuss more about it!
---
I guess that's the upside, 2 years of patches and content.
---
Read my edit.
---
You make it sound like infinite loops are possible. If you tunnel the guy who just hit their DS, don't lose them, and know how to beat a loop, the max it's going to extend a chase is 2 minutes, but that's the point of the perk. If you're worried about 2 minutes, then use ruin to slow the game down a little bit.
---
#DeadByDayPolite material right here.
---
Sure lol 
---
Those escape metrics that they posted right after the *ridonkulously* skewed Hallowed Blight? Those statistics?
---
I wish we got Ghostface instead of the dog agit chapter x was 
---
Pig is about stealth and slowing down the game, Spirit is about mindgames. Spirit is better overall but more difficult to master, so you may havenmore fun with Pig, specially now that she's getting some tweaks.
---
Killer mains ftw
---
It might be a hard one to notice all the time.
---
it's not a trend, it's a fetish and pls don't kinkshame. we're all just horny
---
that would be interesting haha **\*worried laughter\***
---
I have the pig but not the spirit, but the majority of this community would advise to buy the spirit.
---
I love playing the pig, because not every survivor is paying attention to the surroundings, which can definitely catch them by surprise due to supressed terror radius.
---
However, when I play survivor it's harder to play against the Spirit, since she can move around the map much faster and undetected on top of that. I can't say anything from the killer's perspective, but her perks are better than Pig's.
---
Im osrry I don't think there's enough stuff to show me where to look. I honestly can't find it.
---
Stop playing Leatherface, play wraith, you'll never lose any game of tag

On another note, I've been thinking a lot lately about his particular skill and I could see it opening a lot of room to mind game Survivors as the Killer.
---
I feel like your design has a lot of potential to build upon. Personally, I would reverse the appeal of your power to have the survivors be forced to stare at the Killer for a certain time. This would make chases a lot more challenging as you can't always look where you are running but are forced to look back or snap to a certain point. The outplay potential would be gigantic.
---
I definitely not disagree with the initial mechanic being fun for the Killer, it would probably just be a little frustrating in the long run. Especially when the thrill of the Killer being new is over.
---
Please explain how!
---
Spirit is more like a gamble for the survivors. Either they choose correctly or they didnt
---
The amount of stalk left in a survivor is dependant on their colour, white means full, red means empty. 
---
The last update to the Unreal Engine completely fucked up sounds, especially on footsteps, which the Spirit relied a lot on when phasing (since she's blind during phasewalk).
---
Other than that, she's a really solid killer. 
---
Dam grammar police always tryin to get me lol
---
I know. An exact bar might help a newer player. Chess piece is actually useless but it helped me when I started playing Doctor.
---
You play killer or survivor?
---
The wish that keeps on giving
---
Deranged pursuit requires you to down a survivor while in killer instinct. Which means: you must hit one survivor to get him into the deep wound effect, go off to find another survivor, hit them to get into killer instinct, then go back to the original survivor to downed them while in killer instinct. It's obnoxious
---
I wish, she's not into gaming sadly. Candy Crush on her cell is all she plays. üòî
---
The idea of making Survivors stare at the Killer if they are caught in his Skill seems good aswell.
---
The only thing that bothers me is that he, as a scarecrow, is a character primarily designed to scare stuff. Making you stare at him for longer doesn't necessarily implies that you are scared. Still, it may work, who knows. 
---
I think that the Sight mechanic is something that would have to come along with this particular Killer, and what it would actually do to the Survivors (stun them, make them look at the Killer, or even maybe reversing the running keys) would entirely be decided w/ testing by the developers. I just would have to be something plausible and that fits the theme of the character itself.
---
What if I were to give a negative review to Barbie's Horse Adventures because I don't like Barbies. The word Barbie is in the title, so I'll obviously not like it. This reviewer played a game called Dead By Daylight and rated it negatively because they don't like violence (well, duh).
---
TFW when 8 year olds play a game thats R rated.
---
She needs perks that help her in loops like any other mid-low tier killer
---
Sometimes I'll tell randoms that if they have hatch and I'm hooked, "tbag" on it so I know to suicide. I wish this was common practice.

---
Free weekends should not allow comments. Or they should, but be considered an off-Steam purchase so that they don't actually contribute to a game's rating either way.
---
Also, comments disabled. I think this one's a troll, if he's genuinely upset that a game about killing, or escaping a killer, is "too violent". This person is clearly a uh, interesting person, and I'd be curious to see the bubble of a world in which he lives.
---
**EPIC FAIL** /s 
---
Bond, because if someone is getting chased but it's not in your radius, it doesn't matter. Also gives you multiple other benefits. 
---
Welcome and have fun! 
---
What the hell is up with fengs proportions in that art lol
---
I was thinking more so places like the jungle gyms where you can‚Äôt see the killer at all times or killers that that may try to hide their light by moonwalking. 
---
I guess a more general statement would be that I enjoy trying to evade the killer, but normal evasion techniques don‚Äôt work against legion.
---
It's a bit of a dead meme though, considering F13 is actually dead.
---
Legacy? No. They've made it clear that's not coming back. I do however think you should get something for each devotion level. 
---
Sorry about picture of tv but I just need a quick answer. 
---
You‚Äôll be scared of my Myers with scratched mirror and monitor and abuse
---
I mean it looks like you used the brown addon that gives you 1 more blink and less range. So next time dont use it or charge longer
---
Exactly, having played both games a lot, I'm glad we have DBD with those devs.
---
I do not like this idea because i alresdy have it and even tho i dont use it i dont want too many people running arouns with it eventually.
---
I know. Im miserable.
---
Half-joke aside, it has been explicitly prpmised that Legacy will only be available for those veteran players, who leveled their chars in the old system. We would feel a little bit betrayed if potentially anyone had access for it. Those who achieved it in legitimate means do find some kind of gamer-pride in showing it off, and it would be unfair if it became accessible to others.
---
On the other hand, it is unfair that its NOT accessible for those who discovered the game later. And people with that kind of playtime SHOULD be acknowledged in a similar way. And there has been quite some talk about rewarding players for skins (altough in the context of high ranking players in a still non-existant leaderboard).
---
I think it would be fair to give high-devotion players a re-skinned Legacy though. They've clearly earned it in a very similar way as players did with the original. They would still get their own acknowledgement, and the original legacy owners can keep theirs.
---
Are you talking about looping or dribbiling here ?
---
Probably recruited for war
---
Ill try spine chill again and sees how it goes main problem I have with it is I usually dont notice it go off

I mean, fuck reviews, i bought the came yesterday after the free weekend.

Self care, leader, we'll make it

Hey. Someone sent me this link and it's interesting to read your comments, especially yours. I made a deal with the Survivor and it was the best choice in this situation. He didn't bother to leave and try to escape in any other way and I was not willing to let him go. I'm sorry to see you being so confused over us spending our time like this, since both the survivor and me chose to do this standoff. The blacklisted joke is something connected to another stream that my viewers know, since we regularly join it. If you would listen to me during the standoff I've told my subs several times not to bother him, not to add him as a friend and while someone asked, if I'm angry, I just said: It's a decision both of us make. We both make the decision to do a hatch standoff. I can not be angry about something I myself do too.  
---
If someone in my chat says he will camp him, the only thing I can do is ask them not to. I know my people and I know those who extraggerate their jokes. Please get your facts clear before you accuse me of stiring up my viewers. The way you put this is not correct. We had a good time in the chat and none was hurt during our standoff.
---
With it you also get the best killer in the game.
---
How were they heavily skewed? Not accounting for d.cs? Ok lol. I play at rank 1 which i understand isnt hard blabla, but my teams get 4kd more often then we have 4 escapes, by a massive margin. If it's allegedly worse for newbs and its not good at the top, that means survivors arent favored nor have an advantage. The only advantage is swf which i dont play nor can we count bec of how it skews the game so badly. 
---
Myers: oh boy that wasnt entity juice
---
You should first level a character with a exhaustion Perk,so you can unlock it on everyone
---
Imagine a billy flexing on you as he's chasing you
---
I prestige Kate. I have exhaustion perks don‚Äôt worry. I just want to know to use for the time being.
---
I play nurse alot and it should've blinked forward XD The add on takes SLIGHTLY so it doesn't really do anything to the blink. Nurse is really hard to play against when you know how yo play her but sometimes.. Theres some trouble with the blinks lmao
---
Almost looks like an actual person
---
Are you on console or PC 
---
You need to hold the blink longer. Why DC?
---
How can you not counter him with stealth? If he does find anyone, then you‚Äôre safe

#BigBubbaNotSorry
---
At this angle, me neither.
---
I guess that‚Äôs your problem, it makes perfect sense to me. Why wouldn‚Äôt I prevent noed from appearing, and if they don‚Äôt have noed I get more bloodpoints. There is literally no downside 
---
That's bound to happen on any game when you play that much; I know it happened to me on a few ones.
---
What I would like actually is advise on how to improve my game.
---
Best thing to do is to quit if killer gets an early hook, denies them 25% bonus BP :)
---
you're delusional. eat pavement scumshit
---
I will, thanks!
---
I hope you only get to play against legion for the rest of your life.
---
I mean, you don't have to believe me. Your choice. But apparently any kind of play style is playing like a dick i guess. Play trapper and drop traps around the hook? "Best camper in the game." Play wraith and try to bing bong with NOED because no good add-ons? "Wow, you're aids." Play nurse? "Tryhard much." Play billy and get lucky with hitting someone inn the middle of something? "Nice map, enjoy your ban." Play huntress and hit the same guy that was pulled off the hook because that is who I ran into first? "-rep great tunneler". Play doctor? DC and "Play a real killer". You can't win.
---
Last night I had the joy of playing against a bunch of folks who did nothing but flashlight spam and t-bag at the gate. At least two odd bulbs and at least two of them were in a group, might have been two SWF groups, but let me tell you all I wanted was to try to play Mikey and burned a splinter to do it. "Hey, i have twoof these And I want to try a character I have no access to, so why not?" Half the game was me being blinded or not being able to get the stalking off because somehow they kept seeing me. Finally downed someone only to have some random douchebag come from behind the shack and blind me like it was his birthright. And if course everyone was doing squats and flashes at the end, and of course at least one person was streaming. Needless to say, that was my last game for the night.
---
I swear, it's the streamers that do it the most and perpetuate the BM. I have played with a total of maybe two survivor that had their twitch handle that wasn't an absolute toxic ass in post game, and one of those was a killer.
---
I'm tired of genuinely posting "good game" or "GG wp" in the chat to be met with this "gg ez" and "you're cancer" shit. I've honestly never met a community that was more hateful and more toxic that playing this, especially during rank reset. And I've played League of Legends and Overwatch. It isn't as bad on here, admittedly (just a lot of DS vs NOED and a bunch of other memes) , but then again on here,you aren't in the game. 
---
If there was a way to turn off the post-game chat, I would, because I'm done with trying to be nice at end game with killers and survivors only to be met with that shit.

Did you not read my comment? Wasting time is a massive downside. This whole game is about time management. If the survivors aren‚Äôt doing gens then the killer isn‚Äôt under any pressure whatsoever. Wasting minutes of a match (that usually only last 10 minutes) cleansing totems just in case the killer has noed is a terrible idea. 
---
I just looked it up isn't it used for religion? 
---
I hope your mother has to bury you :)
---
I love how you think thats an insult lol I hope so too
---
There's clearly space for the nurse just to walk around. I tried first blink 2 second hold to try to get to her, second was tapping cause I thought it didn't work so tried to get slightly closer. Didn't go ANYWHERE and the third was just the same. And DC cause that happened to me like 5 times. Also she blinked to basement eventho I was on the boat and blinket forward clearly... Smh.. 
---
Shut up meg 
---
&gt; With it you also get ~~the best killer~~ a killer in the game
---
FTFY
---
That‚Äôs tuff
---
I disagree. This subreddit is much more rational (most of the time) than the official forums or steam forums. I‚Äôm much more likely to have a civil debate about something here than over there. 
---
And I think the game is pretty well balanced and that the devs, while not perfect, are more responsive than most companies are. 
---
oh my god this is so wholeso- aaaaand she got a fourman.
---
I played a trial as killer the other day where every pallet was invisible to me but not the survivors. Needless to say, it was a painful game. Is this a common bug other people have run into or was I lucky?
---
Comment below says his Lullaby is separate to his terror radius, but RPB and MA will make his terror radius 0 in the dream world, and his lullaby 8 metres. Is this right? 
---
Oh nice, that sounds convenient!
---
I believe you because you felt the need to say so....
---
/s.
---
Just don't forget to get Insidious and Noed perks
---
That sounds like a slog, but since I currently have none of the required currency anyway, I predict it'll be a while!
---
PC 
---
Okay thanks for the advice 
---
He probably voted labour
---
Comment above says M&amp;A does affect his lullaby, but I think this is true (to what I know?). Not sure though.
---
Also can Freddy initiate a chase while survivors are in the overworld?
---
I play Freddy on PS4. He has no terror radius with monitor and abuse and red paint brush. 
---
Look up montos (ninja Freddy) video to see the results
---
Boy you weak. Only I'm able to make her feel bad /s
---
Does he still have an 8m lullaby? The question at hand is pretty much if M&amp;A affects his terror radius
---
inb4 mods remove it
---
&gt; Best thing to do is to quit if killer gets an early hook, screwes all your team :)
---
No his lullaby is 0m
---
Freddy's lullaby is unaffected by anything, perk or add-on. Only his terror radius can be affected.
---
Just wait. It'll be in the shrine next week. *Haha.* 
---
No his lullaby is 0meters
---
You can also still use a pallet stun to try and break them out of Frenzy.  Makes them have to break the pallet to continue the chase, and Legions HATE breaking pallets, lol.
---
It's also a desperate bid, but you can try cutting off Line of sight after jumping a pallet, and as they follow, try and slip past and jump the pallet again.
---
I've lost a few that way, although it will only probably work 1-2 times before they wise up.
---
I'm no cryptozoologist, but I think the Spirit is a ghost. ;)
---
Nope. Survivors in the waking world technically don't exist to Freddy, until he puts them to sleep.
---
@ mods please dont remove it, I took it as a joke :(
---
F13 was fun. But not addictive like DbD. Also it was screwed from the get go because they did not practice due diligence when working with a licensed and franchised character.
---
It might have been different if they weren't frozen in legal stuff.  Regardless I feel like DbD has an extremely good formula for repetitive play. F13 did not
---
Ahh! Thanks for the help :D
---
Also no. Freddy's lullaby is unaffected by anything. Only his dreamworld terror radius can be changed.
---
lol its not even that long ago.. Remember when you could lay traps right below a surv and unhooking from any angle wasn't possible?
---
Pepperidge Trapper remembers 
---
New perk idea.  Hex camouflage.   Makes all hex totems look like dull totems. 
---
No problem.
---
Are you 100% sure about this? I‚Äôm almost certain you can reduce his lullaby radius. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong 
---
There's a lot of people that forget how many hours of fun they've stacked from this 20 dollar master piece.
---
Too busy being cry baby tryhards.
---
*happy FTFY &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;33
---
Don't forget about Agitation and Iron Grasp!
---
Monstrous Shrine is pretty top-tier for him too...
---
I had that same feeling when i first got the game. i turned into dwight 3.0 with the amount of lookers i hid in. But still you get use to it.
---
man it's not about you, it's about letting people tell KYS or not
---
What perk is that?
---
Are killer mains *still* actually crying about this?  
---
It's time to let that go already.   
---
"Developers and parts of the Community were not satisfied with how the changes played out in the Public Test Build"  
---
Wasn't just the survivors, developers didn't like the mechanic either, bud. 
---
You don't necessarily have to be sneaky, you can make yourself more prominent with Unnerving Presence, it makes your terror radius larger and as the doctor this can mean survivors have a harder time landing skill checks and will scream too, giving away their positions. 
---
Red Paint Brush is TR only. His lullaby is like Huntress's humming, completely set in stone and unchangeable.
---
There's a desync issue with killers. When I was playing survivor it almost looks like they're lagswitching before they disconnect. This game is a fucking mess at the moment.
---
Ahh ok. Damn. I really wanted to surprise my friend my randomly pulling him into the dream world.
---
Thanks for the help! 
---
Awwww
---
Yes. Freddy's lullaby can't be changed by anything.
---
Map knowledge is your number one friend for both killer and survivor. Just by playing you‚Äôll get better as maps become more familiar and you learn routes people take and common places of windows/pallets
---
gens before friends
---
Wait are you sure about that? I could've sworn the red paint brush affected his lullaby. Now that I'm thinking about it I don't remember reading that anywhere but I'm also not sure why I would've assumed so.
---
This is weird to see but I want more.
---
Remember when you could mori without having to hook first haha 
---
It also doesn‚Äôt help that at low hours played they likely have a limited set of potato perks to choose from. 
---
Oh, I‚Äôm bringing a lvl2 plunderer‚Äôs instinct, a lvl1 botany knowledge, and a lvl1 empathy. 
---
Hey look, a rank 15 killer with a full compliment of rank 3 meta perks and an ebony Mori.  This game is fun!
---
I mean come on dude it's the internet, what do you expect?
---
When I run Spine Chill I have to keep my eye on the perk corner for that reason lol.

---
Positive. Play a fair bit of Freddy. The paintbrush reduces his movement speed, TR, and dream transition time. Nothing affects the lullaby.
---
That's due to bad Survivors, not your skill as a player. Gens get done really fucking quick. 
---
We can do some kill your friends later on it you want help some help learning the game better 
---
Fair enough
---
Ye.. Good ol' times :D
---
this has happened to me just recently rip
---
that‚Äôs the real horror right there 
---
I love doing this to people üòÇ
---
I like this and think it would fit in with Claudette's lore. 
---
Minor though (like you said) so as not to make Empathy obsolete.
---
fresh meat
---
Yea honestly I‚Äôll take a much faster and easier game with a little less bp cuz I‚Äôll still make more bp per hour or however you want to measure it
---
Legion is hated not because of the Lore but because of the mechanics. The killer is very easy to play and actually quite fun but their is an exploit when you put someone in the deep wound state where upon if you look at the ground you can follow the blood and scratches but your technically not in a chase. This means inevitably the survivor will go down and Legion will be right their to get the hook, their is no counter play and if the Legion uses Bloodhound it's ruthless.   
---
I quite like all the lore they make behind the characters and I am very torn as to whether I want them to reveal more about the entity or not lol.   
---
I wouldn't describe DBD as a horror game. Once you played a while the tension goes and only a few killers will give you the heebie jeebies or jump scares such as a silent Michael build. If your able to watch videos of it I think you would be ok playing it.   
---
Found the Nea. 
---
I too like giving the killer a 3v1 out the gate
---
^Ve ^a ^Configuraci√≥n ^para ^activar ^Windows.
---
Most likely just lag working against you. It‚Äôs happened to me more than a few times. 
---
If you're the last survivor alive ( other sur left / DC / dead) on the hook you won't have the chance to struggle. You'll just instantly die.
---
Not talking about this, I mean when you have others alive 
---
As shitty as it is, without the proper perks (Spirit Fury, Enduring, Brutal Strength, etc) the best bet is to give up the chase. Overly committing can waste a lot of time
---
Flashlights and avoiding myers isnt toxic behaviour. 
---
Anyway teabaggimg at the gates just hit them, its annoying but it gets old quickly. 
---
As for postchat bitching i again rarely see it anymore unless the killer is genuially being a twat. As long as you try your best to not camp/tunnel you should be fine. Ignore the few people who moan 
---
Adapt. Get Brutal Strength and find the right method to stop it. It's how all killers such as myself have learned.
---
Well no, DC before actually getting hooked right. If you DC on the hook he gets the 25% BP Bonus. 
---
Those days...
---
I‚Äôve only ever been basement bubba‚Äôd once.
---
I wasn‚Äôt even mad. The madman was just waiting there the entire match. Respect for basement bubbas
---
You have to press it fast enough and consistently (no stopping for a split second). It‚Äôs happened to me when my finger got lazy and forgot to tap A. That or lag because PS4 is terrible with that
---
Yes, she's fun to play and learning her power of entertaining also she's the queen of mindgames
---
Play smart and use bloodlust to your advantage.
---
Or play one of the various killers meant to stop pallet looping. Such as Trapper, Legion, Pig, Billy, Leatherface, Nurse, Spirit, and Clown.
---
Or play one of the many perks &amp; perk combos that stop pallet looping. Such as Enduring + Brutal Strength + Spirit Fury
---
I would've voted for The Game
---
*if it was even on the list, I don't see it there*
---
Best bet is to find somebody else. In my experience there‚Äôs always at least one survivor who is very good at running the killer and the other survivors just run in a straight line and easier to kill. Always leave the best runner for last because they typically don‚Äôt want to do gens either 
---
Another cool bit of trivia! This is up there with the Michael open/closed hands thingy.
---
i would've sworn that his lullaby and terror radius both change with m&amp;a and paint brush but after reading the comments im not sure anymore. 
---
Actually, I've ran PWYF on Spirit before and the same thing happened. It looked almost as if she was infinitely phasing. Might be a bug since she's possibly supposed to do only put her arms up like that once a certain speed is reached by using her power, but I wouldn't mind this as an Easter egg. If intentional, it does a great job at showing her vengeful and bloodthirsty nature.
---
You tunnel on Freddy, therefore you think he's the worst. Change your playstyle and you'll change your opinion. 
---
Devs need to embrace Nea being a killer. Her teachable need to be No One Escapes Devs. 12/10 would not escape Devs again
---
Taking 15 seconds to cleanse a totem is hardly an issue , and neither is finding them. You can probably spot two of them while looking for a generator. Hell if you‚Äôre looking for ruin, you may even find every full totem. What you aren‚Äôt understanding, is that noed can‚Äôt be called op if it can be destroyed before it activates. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a waste of time, it‚Äôs a counter. If a killer is bad enough to use noed they probably struggle and need to win the end game. Why would I risk letting myself and other teammates die at the end game when it could‚Äôve been prevented. I guess you and I have different play styles. Mine being I will cleanse any totem I see and not get destroyed by noed 
---
Well, no. Since Hatch Standoffs are still a thing and it's a still a thing because cunts like you cried about it. And the devs bend over backwards to appease you cunts all the fucking time, bud. And you fucking know they do. Do I have to bring up the Freddy Nerfs? Or the constantly post-poned DS nerf? 
---
Hi, PlayClayfighter!
---
I just wanted to stop by and wish you peace and happiness!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
i liked the idea of aftercare until my teammate brought the killer to me twice. never using that again. 
---
He didn‚Äôt?
---
Just that his mother outlived him
---
Actually he wished his mother good health in a way as long as he stays healthy and lives to 110+ his moms gonna be real old if she‚Äôll be there to do the burying 
---
Tell me that was random.
---
Why is it that 3 gen doctor is said to be especially bad? Is it because he can increase ppls madness at every generator by being in treatment mode in the middle of the 3? 
---
you can catch some off guard the first time but its not gonna work anymore after that 
---
Thats Hope, you get Hasted after all gens are done for 2 minutes.
---
Sounds like you should have no problem making the first move and taking a loss if you're gonna go by that logic. If that's the case, you shouldn't be complaining at all and should love the current hatch state. But here you are.
---
I just saw this know and holy shit is this amazing! I'm praying that she comes to the game!
---
wait, free weekend players that only get like one or two hours in can review but shared libraries that would die for this game can't?[!](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSNoQs4ttVYPhjmg4eQW1bq8k6DUHqxZ-KUVFGaY7X8NHglvY2Y)
---
Had a team beat me and they all proceeded to send voice messages of the singing "I be Flossin" terribly. Its much worse on console.
---
How about you try useful perks like Adrenaline, Borrowed, Decisive, Dead Hard, Self Care??? 
---
Keep practicing, obviously. You'll naturally get better with time. Check out different builds you can make with your killers on youtube (Monto has a lot of good ones.) And check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) for help with looping survivors. When it doubt, search youtube for help lol
---
As for some killer specific tips. Save your pig traps for when all the gens are done. It stops people from leaving and it auto-starts the countdown clock to their death. An end game build including perks like blood warden, bitter murmur, and remember me can be fantastic for her. 
---
Sit right on the edge of tier 3 with myers until you're right behind a survivor. You can stalk for a quick second then instadown them. Monitor and abuse makes his terror radius basically disappear, allowing you to sneak up on survivors all the easier. Combine this with scratched mirror and lery's memorial institute and *oof*, you'll terrify the survivors when they run directly into your arms. 
---
Try and keep a huge terror radius as Doctor, distressing is his best friend, and you can build a nasty anti-skill check build with distressing, huntress lullaby, overcharge, and unnerving presence (you could also toss ruin in there instead of overcharge if you like.) 
---
I don't really play Leatherface, but I know he's really good with basement builds since he can hit everyone down at once, so that's always a good option for him. Territorial imperative, agitation, iron grasp and perks like that help him in that type of build. 
---
I wish killers would always get +1 token if a survivor disconnects. It's just unfair to miss out on BP because of people ragequiting.
---
I‚Äôve done the insidious build about twice, both times landed me a 3K at around rank 12-10 , but I quickly got bored of that play style. 
---
I‚Äôll still run a basement build but with just iron grasp/Agitation to get them in the basement, as we all know LF is one of if not THE strongest killer when there‚Äôs a survivor in the basement, and I think it only makes sense to play to his strengths. 
---
It's happened to me several times as killer where I hear the gate powering sound, and immediately an explosion of my NOED exploding. I just go, "darn".
---
What about a red Legacy?
---
feelsbadman for you, feelsgoodman for the survivor

i just hit P3 for the first time ever in this game as I only started a few months ago and dont play every night. i loaded in yesterday to find it reset some of my levels! i went from P3 lvl 1 to P2 lvl 49. I decided to report it to devs even thought I didn't loose much.
---
in under 24 hours i got a response and resolution! they have me about 180,000 bp and i was not only able to theoretically cover what i had been lost! but i got to level 10 on P3 so i don't have to redo going in with no perks at all!
---
thank you, DBD support team! &lt;3
---
If the pallet is safe, then ,don't try to mindgame it. Like if the survivor have full vision of you, around a truck or a bunch of tires or something like that don't run back and forth it's useless.  
---
If the pallet is unsafe then look at this it's a goldmine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crgMmyoDzNQ&amp;t=668s 
---
this. when you get to higher ranks , a 1 minute run it's a damn good job imo
---
Look with this post guys lay off the down votes and more unhelpful comments it‚Äôs just a normal dead by daylight things that happen I was just putting my point out there I just wish both survivor and killer should get punished for just trying to get one pip 
---
I‚Äôd say so. If you equip the bloody clothes you get it‚Äôll really help you hide from the killer. 
---
okay, dumb question. i‚Äôm new to reddit, how do you have the ‚Äúfreddy defense squad‚Äù by your name?? i, too, would like to be part of that squad 
---
Shape is hard for a first killer! Its cool you took the initiative to go for him, he's super fun to play against. I wish you many sweet future survivors!
---
Honestly those survs, if they were matching with rank 20 killers, shouldn't be mean in the first place. A rank 20 killer very likely could be new to it.
---
Nea got moved to the killer category
---
I saw it yeah
---
Just ask BI to add a "no gore" feature in the settings they always do that the community wants.... 
---
I‚Äôve noticed that with just the shirt, will pants make it better?
---
The "killer" tickles you. If you're tickled twice, before you can catch your breath and calm down, you fall to the ground. The killer then puts you on a comfy couch where other survivors have to shake you awake. If you're on the couch 3 times, your mom comes over and picks you up and takes you to your room.
---
He s new to the game.. so I guess the doc is a bad choice cause he can‚Äôt improve his survivor tracking ability
---
i would suggest either Balanced Landing or Lithe for unexperienced players, Dead Hard takes a bit of skill in order to not be wasted in vain, the amount of people that uses them without planing to reach for a vault or a pallet is too damn high, end up downed 1 second after wasting DH 
---
Cleansing dull totems (unlit ones) are good to do in game as it prevents late game hexs from spawning/restricts where they can go. Be careful, some hexs can let the killer see where you are while cleansing or put on exposed (exposed= one hit down).
---
Check out youtube for gameplay on them both if you haven't already, since you're torn between the two. I play them both, and love them both. 
---
Personally, out of the two, Spirit is my favorite. She has an add on that makes her sound when she's phasing completely disappear and *that's* terrifying for real. You'll sneak up on them and get grabs all the time. But yeah, she does have a pretty big learning curve. But there are perks that can help you in the beginning like predator and bloodhound (though I wouldn't recommend you keep running them, they're kind of garbage but good for learning spirit.)
---
But at the same time, Pig is one of the strongest end game killers in the game in my opinion. And there's nothing better than crouching up to someone and knowing they did a double take because they thought you were a crouching survivor friend lol
---
Oh okay that's good. I don't know much about steam because I play on console only.
---
Add a totem counter to Small Game. People who complain about totems can run it. 
---
LOL! Sounds like a Trump snowflake... can‚Äôt take it.
---
Well, for Myers, family was the first victim.
---
most players don't realize you can block attacks as both jason and counselors
---
And what proof do you have that this is the generally accepted form or communication?
---
Seems to me like your making a pretty big assumption here. 
---
Most people that I play with and most streamers/tubers don‚Äôt do this. Once again, seems like an assumption.
---
Rank means fuck all nowadays I'm afraid
---
So you're saying the more experience and the better you get wont make this game easier? Everything you see on this reddit are people bitching and moaning because they got beaten. Dont fall to believing you're helpless because you're not. A lot of people on this reddit are just bad and want to blame anything besides their own skill. Keep practicing and things get way easier. As I said in my other comment though you need to learn strategies of killers and survivors. How you do this is playing killer and survivor and becoming good at both. This makes playing killer way easier because you dont get juked easily bc you know the options.
---
I think it would be great that we could just see if the killer has noed when the last generator gets completed
---
Can we make this a thing ? Asking for a friend.
---
?
---
Where did you get the models from?
---
Yeah when it's packed into a synergy it can be very strong, but if you use it alone it's a waste of a perk slot.
---
Remember when bnps instapopped gens
---
Yeah but less time to get away
---
Don't worry, all he needs to do is hold M1 for \~15 seconds
---
Must be a meme, I refuse to believe this isn't a meme.
---
Sooo a two minute hatch standoff that the killer is guaranteed to win?
---
Probably, yeah. But most of the healing I'll be doing is after an unhook, so 233% healing speed doesn't sound all that stronger than just 200%. I'd still bring it over Deliverance or WGLF.
---
I keep getting Myers dailies, and I'm hot garbage with Myers. I don't have Ruin on him yet, and basically I lose 2 gens before I can get to Tier 2.
---
What's really weird is I run M&amp;A on him, and I know angles to approach gens so survivors can't see me coming, yet they always seem to know I'm close so I get to the gen ant they're long gone. Spine chill maybe? No clue.
---
Either way, I usually get dick slapped trying to play Michael, unless I get lucky with an early down and some good early stalking.
---
Not true at all, if I see 4 claudettes I'm going to take different or additional detection perks than if I'm in a lobby with 4 pizza Dwights.  Or run a different killer entirely.  If I see 3+ items there's a good chance I'm going to bring Franklin's as most survivors will loop back to pick up an item they had dropped out of their hand.
---
Knowing the killer would similarly allow you to tailor your perks to counter their ability and be a huge boost for them.
---
So what? I dislike playing against her.
---
Which doesn't matter once they hop a window or reach a pallet. The chase still gets reset and it only costs you an entire perk slot.  
---
NOED is countered by just taking totems which becomes very easy to do once you are familiar with maps.  
---
Remember when you could do generators after the gates were powered? I miss that for farming reasons.
---
((Hope))
---
Yes exactly. I think my reply somewhat went over your head. I will make the first move if I have to. I either give hatch or jump in. The only time I wont jump in is if there is 1 gen left. Then ill take those extra 2 mins it takes to finish a gen and gtfo. 
---
Also, I dont see giving hatch or jumping in as a loss. When the hatch spawns the game is pretty much over. Either my team got wrecked or I destroyed the survivors. So yeah, I would like to get out of that game and move on to the next. If other people wanna stare in eachothers eyes for minutes on thats fine, just dont complain about a standoff. You choose to move on and get more and quicker points in a new game or you can stay and waste your time ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the game.
---
This and five stack Devour Hope
---
That's one of the weird reason I like the legion.
---
I want to know if her animation changes for survivors too. This also happens when you use PWYF!
---
Now they just need to fix her face little more
---
Thanks
---
This happened to me, but I bought the game about 2 years ago. I payed it and sucked at it so I left it and started playing pillars of eternity, recently I took it again and I still suck but I'm enjoying the game A LOT! 
---
Hopefully you guys learned alot from this insightful guide should you ever need to pop 4 gens back to back.
---
I think Small Game should not only have a totem counter, but also give double BP bonus for cleansing. 
---
What we could do is add the totem counter for everyone including the killer. And also let the killer see the auras of all the totems just like the generators. Hex totems can be a different collour
---
I main him and Feng, nice to see my guy finally getting some love &lt;3
---
Yes. 
---
&gt; Knowing the killer would similarly allow you to tailor your perks to counter their ability and be a huge boost for them.
---
Right, survivors definitely need it easier.
---
If you're serious about the game and continue playing you'll prolly break down and end up getting all the dlc, so get what you want first
---
More consistent at getting 2 kills* 
---
Gotta watch how you say things. I read that as he‚Äôs more consistent at getting 3-4k‚Äôs lmao
---
Very true. The only exception is that he's sitting in a chair instead of looming over you from over yonder.
---
You can tell if Spine Chill goes off if your action bar turns yellow, or if you notice something brighter in your peripheral vision to the right (The perk)  
---
Don't use Spine Chill Tier I. It's garbage outside of Pig and Wraith. Tier II and III are good, however.
---
When you play an omega blink nurse
---
Yep, "all files successfully validated" or something like that.
---
I've started just not using an offering if I see 1/4 survivors take an abnormally long time to connect to the lobby, which seems to cut my losses a bit.
---
Dead hard = useful. Omegalul. Good meme pal
---
It is stronger when sloppy is active, which is always.  Plus it gives you more heals in other situations.  I'd add a high charge medkit for extra crazy heals.  You should probably run empathy with this... You could always run empathy instead of botany knowledge.
---
Put it at the top of your perks so you can notice it easier. That's what I do. Helps a bit more.
---
It makes his passive zappy radius bigger
---
I think it's super strong at purple ranks and higher.  Love six second heals.
---
I always thought this was just memeing until I actually started playin Leatherface 2 days ago. What a snoozefest
---
His lullaby are his tr are different, it's basically like the Huntress humming, out of the Dreamworld he has no terror radius.
---
But in the dream world he has a normal terror radius, which is affected by perks that change tr's
---
If he finds anyone just one person you have the chance of having your location revealed to him. And you still have to do gens so you have to make some noise as well, if you wanna win. Have fun this killer should be removed until a proper rework is made. His kid should never exist end of story he simbly ruins the game.
---
Dip that shit in chrome bitches love chrome

distressing increases your terror radius and the Doctor's madness range is the same as his terror radius. Having a larger madness range helps disable survivors and makes it easier to track them. It's an excellent perk for him
---
Damn i never thought to mix franks with dirt
---
Gotta have your hands held through everything dont you? Jesus Christ, survs complain about everything. Why not just make it so killers can only mori in the exit gate area? 
---
Does he just stab people? Jigsaw and Leatherface are way more violent. XD
---
So it makes his shock therapy radius Bigger? Meaning more people will scream from longer distance?
---
In the Soviet Union? Did the USSR have conscription?
---
I know people who's families lived in the former Soviet union and while they were forced to recieve military training I don't know anything about conscription in the USSR.
---
I think that i might have been the killer in that match... Black mask/red smock huntress? 
---
"don't mind me i'll be leaving shortly"
---
Same here. I already had my eyes on the game but i had heard some negative stuff about it and decided not to buy it. Then it became free and i'm still playing it. I'm so glad, because otherwise i probably would have never got around to playing it
---
same. I give them headstarts or farm or whatever. it's jsut a flop when someone disconnects. then I message the farmed result screen to the person who disconnected xD   
---
"Oh look! we farmed cuz you left :D "  
---
Pretty sure it's eight seconds since the healing nerfs, unless you're talking about WMI + Botany.
---
Its even more op, i think its the best combo. The 2 pink addons are trash.
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt think this should be baseline. Hex perks are already hit or miss and totem spawns are mostly garbage. I personally don‚Äôt find it too hard to keep track of totems, even as a mostly solo survivor, since there are always 5 of them and you can see the remnants of cleansed ones. 
---
The idea of adding it to Small Game seems good though, it gives more of an incentive to run a somewhat niche perk. 
---
Only when killers stop using noed
---
are you implying that dead hard is not useful? wowie
---
Nah just WMI.  I'll have to time it. 8 seconds makes more sense.
---
#cleansealltotems2k19
---
This is exactly what I do an it works wonderfully. Opinions on this are divided and you can tell because I've come across a lot of survivors that wake up instantly with the skill check and taunt me like saying "wtf were you thinking with OC???" They're so excited to do that that they don't realize they messed up a generator. HOWEVER I know that with this build it can either go really good or terribly bad.
---
I gg and leave immediately so they can't respond and honestly I think that makes them even more mad than if i left right away
---
If the killer could t grab people out of the hatch jumps, there would be a lot more slugging in the game. 
---
Best map for a tourney is probably campbells chapel or wretched shop to stop people from corner cheesing as claudette 
---
Wow,I haven't noticed that at all after so many hours.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. Normally, I struggle for as long as possible if I can see the other survivor is on the other side of the map and I‚Äôm being camped. I wish I could tell them to just leave me to die but often then try and save me and the killer gets a 4K.
---

---
I have a friend who refused to buy Leatherface for the longest time (she was eventually gifted it on her Birthday and I mean she got it for free so :v) because she dislikes the entire principle of his DLC. Leatherface literally only exists for his perks. He adds absolutely nothing to the game other than camping because his power is literally just a worse Hillbilly in most ways.
---
I think if Behavior got the liscense for Leatherface today (instead of last year) they'd just give Billy a Leatherface cosmetic. It's also what I hope they do for Legion if they ever get the rights to Ghostface. (Though I do still really want a Syndey Prescot or Gale Weathers survivor.)
---
WMI halves the healing time at Tier III so that'll be easy to remember.  
---
E.g. Coulrophobia + We'll Make it = 50% healing increase instead of 100%, so 12 second heal.
---
Spine Chill :v)
---
New Legion buff
---
Reeeeepost
---
Most of the time, I just rely on the bar turning yellow to tell me it's active.
---
Don't buy Freddy - at least not yet. He is supposed to be getting an entire rework.
---
I think it should tell you once the gates power cause the worst part of noed is the sucker punch feeling of it catching you off guard 
---
I bought it last year and for some reason I got a China Hillbilly and I had to level him up for some reason to get the perk, I didnt like it
---
Recently had an Ace try to wait for the 2 hooked survivors (one of which was me) to die so he could take the hatch. The killer wasn't near either of us, and even if he found one of us being camped, there was enough space between the two hooks so he could get one. He was behind a hill less than 10 meters from me.
---
I struggled until the killer found them. Sent a message asking why he didn't save either of us.
---
"i work alone"
---
Monto? Is that you?
---
Yes because nobody bought the dlc or continues to do so
---
It doesn't have to be big. Just like the generator counter. 
---
A madness 3 survivor cannot repair generators or stop regression, so a 3-genner doctor's main focus is just to zap survivors into M3 and force them to snap out, wasting their time.
---
Identity V is a pretty good non violent alternative
---
....yikes 
---
Lots of high rank survivors are complete noobs 
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Meh is gorgeous as she is now, I adore her.
---
Yes, going out of your way to harass someone online for any reason is toxic. 
---
Are you thick?
---
it's not a fetish as much as a weird turn on
---
Ironically, why would he ever need BBQ&amp;Chili? He's so OP he doesn't even need to search for survivors
---
But were you camping? You cannot expect people who wait 20+ minutes for a match to not get annoyed by getting camped to death on their first hook. Killers are always quick to make fun of surviors but NEVER will admit the absolute bullshit they put surviors through to ruin the game for them. Just sayin' 
---
Rip bot
---
This game was definitely a surprise to me as well when I first tried it out.  I was all like, ‚ÄúEhh I don‚Äôt like horror games, so I won‚Äôt be able to get into it.‚Äù  Well, I tried it, and have absolutely loved it!  Sure, it has its problems, but as long as you don‚Äôt go in and let all the survivor vs killer toxicity get to you... you will have a good time!  Welcome to the DBD community!
---
While you're running away while looking back, look infront of you too sometimes so you dont end up doing that. Your main priority (for me atleast) when getting chased is to find a loopable location like jungle gyms, shack but avoiding to use the god pallete early on the game, T-walls, etc.  
---
T1 Michael says hi
---
Agreed. Make it appear at the start like Rancor. Either that, or make it that Rancor doesn't show as Exposed until you get hit. (You'll mostly already know that the killer has Rancor, because you've been seeing their auras.)
---
I have similar memories 
---
I jumped off and came back outside of the map. Took me awhile t realize I just had to walk back through the gate to escape.
---
Hadn't played killer in a long time, at rank 20 and tgise poor bastards fed the evil like a buffet
---
Negatory üòÇüòÇ
---
Compared to other exhaustion perks? Its garbage.
---
I personally think that that map is better for perma tier 2 myers
---
This always happens to me, but only when another Survivor's already made it all the way to me, and it makes me seem like a huge jerk.
---
Thank you!
---
I agree. Dying light is worse, especially when a teammate starts farming you
---
I made this from scratch but I suppose someone could have used the image before. My bad.
---
Anyone can do this, it‚Äôs not specific to one side of the community. 
---
Thanks bud! Will definitely farm points. Idk what it is about the trapper but I always play my best with him rather than anyone else 
---
Space eSports had a good track record up until the aniversary tournament, where something seriously fucked up and the company basically imploded on itself. You need only search for the "ESCAPE anniversary dead by daylight tournament" to find all sorts of videos covering the shitshow of a tournament. (As much as I dislike TydeTyme his video sums up the event quite well.) Between incompetent casters (if you ever see this community memeing about "Valhallah" it was an unfunny joke made by the ESCAPE casters which was quickly memed. They also talked a lot about Dragon Ball on stream which is fine for a small event but not an anniversary tournament backed by the developers), very questionable management (there was a large debacle with Space eSports stealing someone's art of DeviantArt and using it as the banner for the event), and poor regulation of the whole event. (#MarthWasRobbed and the supposed final PC victory given out to a lag switcher) the entire anniversary tournament was a disaster.
---
I'm not going to judge an entire corperation based on one fuck up but as the joke in the DOTA 2 community goes: ["Shanghai was an ass, and we won't be working with them again."](https://youtu.be/hNVrqS1wUYY) While Space eSports might be a great company it's hard to give any respect to their corperation after such a huge fuck up.
---
Yeah dude I played for a few hours over the weekend, enjoyed it, and made the purchase. I've also considered getting Last Year: The Nightmare since that looks similar and pretty good.
---
Get good.
---
Shes pretty much the second best killer in the game and hecka easy to play so yea you should probably buy her.
---
F
---
You said the word hatch, typed in a winking smile and have a Claudette flair. You just got stereotyped by people on the reddit, who downvoted you as they didn't even read what you wrote and just disliked.
---
I dont know what rank as a killer you are but when you get in higher ranks usely there already 2 or 3 generators done before you catch the first survivor. The legion is a bad killer but there is no counterplay you can do as a survivor against him (if the killer is not a potato atleast).
---
He takes to long to catch a survivor but catching the survivor is garanteed. So the legion usely ends up with 2 kills, 3 if he uses good addons.
---
Yeah not his chargeup zap but his terror radius in zap mode emits a zap that slowly makes them tier up 
---
Many people are saying that Dead Hard isn't as good as it once was, because many Killers will fall for it only one time. After that, you can pretty much only use it to DH to a pallet in time. Balanced Landing on The Game is probably the single best perk in the game. Or in Ironworks of Misery.
---
I was tempted but was too much of a pussy to test it lol 
---
There is 2?! I honestly thought he just had that shitty pin
---
I'd probably put balanced landing first and dead hats last tbh dead hard is fun to use in the same way as pebble is fun to use the one time it's works you're beaming and then after that it's a waste 
---
The fucking Tapp faceüòÇ
---
DH can literally extend a loop. DH can save yo ass when you're about to get hit. DH can give you a lil speed boost to reach a small distance to position yourself better for flashlight saves, palette saves, etc. Idk what you're talking about but we all have different opinions I guess.
---
I haven‚Äôt played it myself, but I have seen gameplay of it. It looks like it‚Äôs a lot of fun 
---
Either they killed themselves on hook, they kept getting found, or Leatherface did what Leatherfaces do.
---
That‚Äôs a yikes from me dawg holy shit.
---
I do understand the badness of Dead Hard as I said in the post but answer this, ‚ÄúIs a Perk that can counter so many things at once be easily be counter able in one category a good Perk?‚Äù
---
Lol how did you not notice crows the first time down there? :p
---
You didn't get OP. If you die ok the hook, the trap door will open and it will be much easier for the last guy to find it EVEN IF HE WAS GETTING CHASED. He just needs to hear the sound.
---
Sprint burst can extend a loop. Sprint burst can save your ass when your about to get hit, as well as bl. Sb can give you a massive amount of distance, as can bl.
---
Dead hard is so easily countered. Dont lunge. Perk becomes near useless unless youre near a pallet or window.
---
Just sick of seeing the same old shit on here every day. 
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt hear them I thought someone was nearby outside, that‚Äôs why I explored nearby.

Frank‚Äôs mixtape and cold dirt.

Just pretend like you phasewalking
---
Close the hatch, powering the exits. Or after a minute show the aura of the survivor to the killer, prevents them just urban evading for 3 centuries. 
---
After you found the guy in the third locker and started going to the fourth I was like "there's no way... right?" XD
---
Dh can be countered by simply walking up behind a surv and doing a quick attack. Wat. Or they can literally just scare the surv into using it. Again, its a garbo perk that only works on new killers.
---
EXACTLY XD
---
A friend once told me that I look like Quentin. From the game, not the movie.
---
Perhaps that's why he came with her pack? She was hunting him because of a resemblance to her father?
---
Unhelpful-but-helpful advice following: Just keep playing, making sure to take a break from one side to play the other.
---
The reason I'll say this and other people probably will to is that when it comes down to it, Dead by Daylight is a game about mind games. Putting aside all balance issues and game length concerns, no matter which side you play, it's about trying to trick the opposition into making a mistake. 
---
And the unfortunate thing is for new players is that you can't really mind game someone outside of the occasional "Who does that, no one does that!" moment because they were expecting a more optimal play.
---
By playing both sides you'll come to appreciate what your limitations are and what you can get away with. You don't even need to be concerned with super fancy moves. Just playing enough  so you start to know things by muscle memory and instinct is where you want to be.
---
 Someone else said map knowledge is important, and I agree. Probably the first 100 hours are completely different from anything that comes after.
---
* As a survivor you'll feel a sense of dread/fear because you have no idea where ANYTHING is. Generators? Pallets? Safe vaults? Who knows, every map is a mish mash and trying to find your way around can get your heart racing
---
* As a killer it will feel like survivors instantly lock onto every pallet in the map and you'll never win a chase. You'll feel like more of a lumberjack than a monster with how much wood you'll be breaking down. 
---
In time you'll learn as a survivor all the major landmarks and potential pallet/safe zones are. And as a killer you'll learn where you can "herd" survivors and try to chase them so they have limited/no options.
---
It's going to take awhile though so don't  get discouraged. Don't worry about pips, don't worry about your rank staying stagnant/ going down. And if it helps you can disable end-game chat.
---
Dead by Daylight has uniquely awesome experience when you're first starting out. Enjoy it while you can and don't feel rushed to learn everything at once. While the game is still fun at 500/1k/2k+ hours, the moments where I'm actually sweating bullets and feeling nervous are few and far between. 
---
**tl;dr** Keep playing both sides and use that knowledge to help adjust your tactics. Learn the maps, if need be bookmark [this page](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Realms) and reference it if you want to get a little heads up on what they look like. Learning the major landmarks of each map will assist in getting yourself oriented. And most of all, have fun and don't feel the need to master this game ASAP
---
It's not that we think the devs are useless or don't care, it's that they don't have the manpower or money to do the things we want.
---
This is probably the one time I wish they'd take a page out of valve's tf2 book and let the community volunteer a bit to ease the load.
---
It would atleast reach you till 37 or something if you aim for the cheapest ones
---
tell him to go stalk someone else
---
I had pizza today :)
---
How did the match end? 
---
My point isn't to give the survivors an advantage, but simply to minimize the "I just heard the wraith, time to DC." And while obviously there's different counters to different killers, how does knowing which killer beforehand change that?
---
usually I run a toolbox to get the most boring part of the game faster
---
Excuse me sir behaviour this game isn't very christinan.
---
Why does every good survivor and streamer use it then lol
---
Monitor and Abuse, Ruin, Thanatophobia and Discordance is what I'm currently running.
---
under where it says create post it should say edit user flair 
---
Same, it mostly comes down to the survivors thinking its going to be an easy game then really fucking up.
---
Or just getting really bad survivors. I had a quentin that thought that his party starter would prevent me from grabbing him while he unhooked.
---
Glad to read this.  I'm 43 and am in a similar boat as you described.  I saw my teenager playing this and dismissed it, thinking it was for the young folks who still have the twitch...  
---
Except I got sucked in over a year ago.  And I can tell you: Your first 500 hours at DBD are precious.  You will remember them fondly, even as you get butchered over and over again.  Your second 500 hours will still be awesome, but you will look back at your beginnings and realize how green and vulnerable you were, how you've come along and learned some strategery.  
---
And once you get over the 1000-hr hump, you'll feel like a pro.  You'll still enjoy this game, but the thrills may come from a different source.  For me, I'm engrossed in the complex time management and risk assessment facets to the game.    
---
As others in this thread have mentioned, " noli illegitimi carborundum", don't let the bastards get you down.  The toxic players and the hate speech and the player entitlement is out there.  Report it or ignore it and move on.  The goodness of the DBD community greatly outnumbers the poison, but you do have to defend against it from time to time.
---
And to learn, you have a wealth of streamers out there.  I like tru3ta1ent on YouTube and occasionally watch not\_queen on Twitch.  I find them to be fun and \*honorable\* players.  
---
Welcome and see you in the fog,  
---
Octothorpe
---
    I'd recommend watching Monto and Tru3talent for killer basics, you'll outgrow them eventually but they're good to start with.
---
    For survivor I'd recommend Ussylis who happens to have really great youtube tutorials on survivor. I'd avoid tyde and scott jund like the plague.
---
I would assume so, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any official info.
---
Cause its apparently a staple perk among the community. However its still garbage, only being able to extend a chase for a least a few more seconds. The only time itll work is the first time, when the killer doesnt realize you have it.
---
What the fuck am I looking at
---
Myers has a time limit for that and he has to stare at you for a decent length to activate that timer. The Halloween music is your warning. Your best defense is to hide until he leaves tier 3 or become really good at looping. 
---
Indeed. So if u dont want to start with shit perks, aim for the 1m bp. U could also level up other killers while continue to play trapper. Ruin for example is almost a must have.
---
Then you'll probably notice the red skill check things to the right of the yellow progression speed.
---
What is wrong with angry Dwight's body?!  
---
Left:first time Myers player
---
Right:2k hours Myers main
---
To be fair, the Sloppy Butcher buff / healing nerfs really did give him a shot in the arm to be better than he used to be. Still not super strong or anything, but he doesn't feel as frustrating to play as anymore. 
---
Trying to self-care yourself awake with mangled in the dream world? That's basically a torture considering how slow you'll put charges on the progress bar.
---
People get careless with Freddy and make stupid mistakes.
---
How about we remove flashlights and DS? No? Okay than deal with it.
---
Spirit is stronger, Pig is funner.
---
Spirit is great. 
---
Uh, ok?
---
I was looking for video content to watch tho
---
4
---
Ahh yeah i never knew the mixtape existed kinda weird purples are better lol
---
The game simply wouldn‚Äôt get voted for. There‚Äôs more survivors than killers so no one vote for it, no survivor is going to vote for a map that disadvantages them and killers wouldn‚Äôt want to waste their vote
---
Show full body model 
---
Yeah, the amount of trashtalk and tbagging you get as Nurse on PS4 is insane. 
---
For Adept I just started burning my 27 Ebony Moris until I finally got everyone. It was very tedious, difficult, and annoying though.
---
Maybe cause i am right about him. His design breaks the game and all counterplay making him cancer for the game. This is not an opinion its downright fact.
---
Identity V is basically what he‚Äôs asking for. A cartoony version with less violence.
---
The only reason I struggle in that scenario is if my teammate was dick lol 
---
I thought the same thing, honestly. It helps if you‚Äôre a higher ranked killer 11-20 to go against players who don‚Äôt really know how to counter her. I also would blink the whole time, cause I‚Äôm not the best at it. So it came to just following them in a chase haha 
---
This is art
---
Congrats! All I have left is the Feast for the Entity trophy and I'll be right there with ya!
---
I used to, but it's so goddamn boring I've stopped doing it (usually) on single person DCs. I'll still farm on 2 person DCs unless at least 2 gens are done. If the hatch is spawnable then I still play normally because they've got a chance at escape.
---
Right, totally get what you mean. I got super lucky with that trophy. A month into the game I played with friends, and we messaged the 1 random to come to us when the gens were done. Without SWF it‚Äôs hard, you‚Äôd have to message the other players. 
---
Welcome to the family.
---
Honestly I just think there aren‚Äôt enough killers. I literally get the same survivors back to back to back whenever I play and it‚Äôs getting insane 
---
Done :) 
---
It probs would, but it's not regressing while it's blocked, so just go work on a different gen until the timer runs out.
---
Sweeeeet! Can‚Äôt wait for ya to join me in wherever the hell the entity is keeping me. :) 
---
Hope so
---
Oh i realize im stupid now xD i get it this one is his lost cousin facecamp with chainsaw def bubba influence
---
I would definitely recommend the pig. She is tons of fun, and she has multiple playstyles, you can even make her ultra stealthy with the right Addons. But it‚Äôs your choice
---
Yeah farming is really boring. But at least ez points, with matchmaking these days it's valuable
---
"But the internet" is a lame ass excuse. No one should do or say anything online they wouldn't in person. And if they do they should be held to the same standards as if it was in person.
---
Just be legion lmao
---
No bbq n chili on billy, ... why
---
What perk is this?
---
Oh shit! That‚Äôs so smart, damn wish I thought of that haha. 
---
Yea that's definitely SWF. The average is about your rank, so actually the MM worked pretty well here.
---
why tf my pp hard 
---
They're looking for Identity V.
---
I mean, any good survivor with an available loop should be near enough to a vault or pallet in order to use dead hard tbh, unless no pallets are left, at which point you're fickes anyways. It's not about luck at all. I've managed games where I've dead harded to a pallet or window 4-5 times and prevented myself going down. It is by far the best exhaustion perk, and often in endgame game after my adrenaline has procced i find myself wishing I had dead hard instead of the extra health state because of noed, instadowns, myc, devour hope, etc.
---
This is beautiful. We should make a petition to get this in the game.
---
Hey also new to prestiging here. If you prestige do you have to reteach your teachable perks? Like get back to level 40 to unlock them in other webs?
---
Yeah, I already had nurses 2 and when I was looking at the description I just saw 24 meters and I was like "I know what else is 24 meters." Complete luck I saw that.
---
This is why people hate legion mains
---
She told from the beginning "he can do the last gen whenever he want, but not go through the hatch..." :D
---
Nah both DH and BBQ at the same time
---
What platform?
---
How the heck I damn want!
---
It looks like PC
---
I was for thay aswell, cause I became really interested in the Killer and wanted to know more before buying it. Didn't find a main but Monto had a lot of interesting videos that helped me decide buying it.
---
Everyone else but one guy died with 3 gens left, a dwight got the hatch tho
---
Bought the game during Xmas sale at my brothers request. Bought LF and played with him exclusively getting a ton of 4ks because I was playing other new players...get all his teachables and now it makes switching to other killers so much better! Franklins and BBQ are so good.
---
To be fair that's a good point. 
---
This is so cuuuuuute!
---
For a second I thought I was in a loop
---
Mind if I get the template friend? Google is unhelpful.
---
Not gonna deny that, but sometimes thats how it is. 
---
Looks like a dead rising survivor
---
I can only nerd on games when summer's holidays come up,feelsbadman I would love to spend my winter on dbd I used to play the game on ps4 but now I'm far too busy to buy it on pc
---
quentin is love. quentin is life.
---
Yknow that feeling you get when you use sprint burst and then like 2 seconds later the killer comes through? Its to prevent that feeling of "FUCK!"
---
i‚Äôm not spending money on a killer i‚Äôll never play for a perk i can live without. i‚Äôll wait for it in the shrine
---
I'm not sure what to think of it myself. 
---
Then take a break for awhile?
---
[IG acc](https://www.instagram.com/p/BswRLWMHFZB/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=p04hg7lyuee5)  This should be the link to my post! 
---
Have fun waiting years for it. Not to mention the conspiracy theories about the devs preventing it from appearing in the shrine.
---
It's discouraging at first, but there are ways to outplay him. Most importantly, you need to split up. If he one taps someone and he's still in his one tap phase, don't go running to hooks or trying to heal people on the ground nearby. When he knocks someone down you can see their aura so you know whereabouts in the map he is - go the other way until his one tap runs out.
---
Did someone say Overcharge?!
---
Why don't you just make it only go off if you do a fast vault most of the time if The Killers is not after you, you're not going to be fast vaulting anything
---
Don't get your hopes up too high, it's space esports we're talking about here.
---
hello fellow quentin main :) 
---
To awake survivors it's only the Lullaby. Of the survivor is in dream state the Lullaby is replaced with heartbeat. The only thing that changes his terror radius in the way you want is the red paint brush power add on. One of his best. I recommend that and either the add on that removed glimpses of him in dream transition or the one that make all sleeping survivors visible at all times. 
---
Also! Always run Remember me as it's amazing for Freddy in End Game scenarios and great for beginning Freddy players too. Make sure you kill your obsession just before gates are powered though. After you get 6 stacks of course. And there's no need to tunnel the obsession for Remember Me. You can literally just keep slugging them, and leaving them to get picked up. 
---
Distressing plus his Calm series of Add-Ons make his Terror Radius absolutely massive. Somewhere between 50 and 60 meters, and anyone in that radius is building madness.
---
Same, I‚Äôve decided to take a break. It‚Äôs not fun dying to ping/lag-switchers/broken-hatchets/broken-chainsaws/5-blinks anymore.
---
Try to play as killer or maybe play as survivor with some chill music in the background,trying hard to win is ok but do not forget that you are playing a game to have fun too
---
That‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been around for a really long time. Just go back to the exit and you‚Äôll escape. 
---
Damn this new update looks so cool.
---
&gt; Stop crying and just get good
---
Is this directed at me?  If it wasn't clear, I'm a killer main and am 100% against letting survivors know who the killer is.  I'd stop playing entirely if they did that.
---
No? Just git gud TBH
---
No. Once a teachable is unlocked it stays unlocked.
---
That‚Äôs also a good build to add Unnerving Presence to. 
---
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, THE most hated comment of 2019. No flash photography, please.
---
Yes I got Platinum in 2 weeks 5 days, 100% in 3 weeks 5 days. 
---
My sad claim to fame, I was showing as number 1 on for fastest 100% on PSNProfiles (until the most recent DLC that I didn't bother with).
---
Congratulation to you btw.
---
Wdym by inconsistent? Does it not work properly?
---
They have reduced chances of getting skill checks. This is a lot better than chasing a survivors you cant even hit for 7 seconds. I've played Freddy for 700 hours, and I had no problems after a couple of games. You just need to learn how to play him clearly.
---
Mostly because I perpetually look like I didn't sleep in 3 days.
---
Against stealthy killers, and some of the time it doesnt pop even when in a chase.
---
Constructive feedback is always welcome!
---
Nice 4k. Hate it when those groups game the matchmaking system to try and get easy wins in green ranks. 
---
I‚Äôd say generally yes, but I think there‚Äôs an argument for neglecting to pick up a teachable you know you will never use to avoid ‚Äúwasting‚Äù three levels on it on every other character.  Can always get it later if it gets buffed or you find a strange use for it.
---
Your constructive feedback is welcome :)
---
i play legion when im tired of playing michael. it's refreshing and running around like a maniac is fun sometimes. 
---
I've never had problems with Lithe against stealth killers or that it doesn't pop sometimes
---
I hate haddonfields with passion. Still have PTSD from a game where I played memey T1 mirror Myers and I could not physically catch survivors because of the loops around fences and in houses. Also can't play Hillwilliam on this map. I'd rather get looped in Badham preschool and the shitty autohaven wrecker map.
---
Basically what Aari said, i'm only fast vaulting when in a chase so it's not like sprint burst
---
but I'd like to keep my perk pool clean for killers since I dont like getting shit perks every level and wanna get the good perks quick
---
should I do this or no
---
You need to get skill checks in order for i to work and if someone heals the same target you have less time to get skill checks. Botany is good 24/7 and works on yourself
---
He who walks faster than anybody can run.
---
Actually I‚Äôm still in the game waiting for him to leave, i‚Äôve tried going out both exit gatws but nothing seems to work :(
---
while it's nice of the developers if that's the case, i'm not fast vaulting every second of the game
---
It's clearly not me, I've been getting my 3k and 4k bp, but going against him is so easy, he's no CHALLENGE at all, I can sit on a generator and hit those great skill checks over and over again whilst being in dreamworld.
---
Come back to me when you've bought the DLC and played him, xo.
---
Makes sense. I guess it‚Äôs one of those perks you use for the memes. 
---
it used to be my most hated exhaustion perk until i paired it with urban evasion, then i looooved it!
---
You had the mori 
---
They were doomed from the start
---
I hAte playing Freddy. Idk why but I do
---
I'm 99% sure the survivors were just memeing, considering they were all in the basement and had the exact same cosmetics.
---
Had a game the other night where a Feng saved me right as the last gen went off. She was then put on a hook right next to the door as we got it open and without coms or anything, we all decided this Feng was going to get out. We all body blocked for her and took hits, all getting out. It was a nice moment of kindness paying off &lt;3
---
Huh, that‚Äôs really odd then. I‚Äôve experienced this bug a couple times before and seen some of my friends get it too, and that always worked. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up this time. 
---
This is by far the single best gameplay clip I've seen on this subreddit. Ace mains have the big brains.
---
After rank reset, I like to run Unnerving Presence, Huntress Lullaby, Ruin and Overchargre (or Ruin depending on my mood). I noticed that this build causes a lot of pressure to players in the 13-15 ranks after monthly resets. They really have to hit the rapid great skillchecks with delayed sounds/no warning.
---
Once I'm in the 1-12, BBQ, Ruin, Nurse Calling, Whispers. Whisper is a definitely for me. Sneaky urban evasion folks.
---
If you can win the lottery whenever you want use it otherwise you will likely not get a good use of it
---
But not so lucky... not this time at least
---
and that is the games fault that you are doing bad?
---
That's up to you
---
Perhaps
---
Oof
---
This was the most annoying bug, all generators emitted bright blinding lights in different colors.
---
I guess it‚Äôs survivors who are being flashlight blinded. 
---
On a side note, what perk would you recommend in my last slot? I‚Äôm using Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, WGLF. 
---
Did you check to see if they were SWF? because they all had the exact same cosmetics, and were all in basement lockers. They didn't even locker hop to prevent crows, so I'm pretty sure they did this for memes.
---
Lag ?
---
Again, I'm not doing bad, I don't get why you think I'm doing bad when I'm saying he's not a challenge to the survivors (when I  go against him) or when I play him
---
nice trolling tho dude, reported.
---
rip swf
---
tenacity also, im a fast slug, i also enjoy throwing pebbles at the killer
---
I do too cause I know how weak he is.
---
Lmao
---
Don't have Michael what does tombstone do
---
They were all different characters at the beginning then they switched to aces last second. Maybe? Maybe not? Regardless lol what are the odds 
---
Self-Care is the obvious pick, but everybody loves a teammate who runs Borrowed Time.
---
Nonetheless, this was the best thing I've seen today. After the second Ace got grabbed, with the exact same cosmetics, that's when I started to die laughing.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I haven‚Äôt really used self care after he healing changes so idk how long it takes to heal, but if I bring Botany it‚Äôll be easier. 
---
Botany
---
I reeeeeally like to look at those loading screens dude
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest. I went down there said... no scratch marks ... no blood anywhere... &gt;:) silly survivors don‚Äôt heal in my basement... then I saw huh no one down here ... went straight for a locker and said haaaa no way... but just in case... haaa no fucking way... alright ace bless me with luck.... andddddd two more aces 
---
Yeah if they all did a 0:06 switch that's definitely SWF. And that gives me even more reason to believe they were meming because SWFs are usually coordinated, and if they were playing for real they would say "Ok \[username\], \[username\] got hooked, go save him"
---
She‚Äôs probably 3rd best killer.
---
Shit ive got a green one on my doc and. Its guaranteed 60k points
---
More with a deviousness boost
---
Yeah swfs, I‚Äôll upload the full clip of me loading in if you‚Äôd like. 
---
i used to love aftercare until my teammates have abused it couple of times by bringing the killer to me. never using it again. also used to love we'll make it but ever since the heal nerf ive found autodidact more effective especially since sloppy is a pretty common perk now. 
---
this game is more like "dead by survivors" cause you can never catch up to them and their toxicity
---
Maybe, when you're standing directly in front of a hook survivor, reveal the killers aura for 10s, so one can watch for a safe unhook? 
---
The god of luck smiles upon you, and grants you a big laugh.
---
"Things really fly past you."  
---
\*sighs\* I understand that you're a troll, but I'm not tilted so easily by ad hominem.   
---
"What exactly is it that im complaining about? "  
---
You've yet to actually establish a viable argument. So currently, you're just spouting nonsense.  
---
" I just replied to the tilted dude :/ "  
---
Nope, not at all. You replied *to me*. I had brought up a particular point that killer mains are still butthurt that the hatch close never made it out of test into the main game. Then you went off going on about stale game endings.  
---
"I never said I loved it, I just dont feel like its worth crying about"  
---
And yet here you are going on and on.  
---
"And those ‚Äúextra points‚Äù you want through a hatch standoff can easily be obtained waaaaaay quicker and in a less boring way if you just move on to the next game."  
---
I'm starting to think you're a liar tbh. You talk so much about moving on to other games quickly as a better means to earn points, yet you're stuck here replying to me instead of moving on in life, like this is a competition you can somehow win. The philosophy doesn't seem to continue in your everyday life. Seems more legit to me that you're one of those types who actually *will* sit there forever and refuse to make that first move. If it didn't bother you so much as you say, this entire post wouldn't have grabbed your attention.  
---
"You got more issues with the hatch than I do."  
---
Find a SINGLE sentence I said in this post where I indicate having problems with how the hatch currently works. Please, go on. Oh that's right, you wont' find any, because I never said anything like that.   
---
"but please go on about how im complaining about something I dont see as a problem."  
---
You *literally* indicated that it's not a problem for you because you don't mind ezpz gtfo into a new game, and yet you're still here, complaining. So yes, I am right on that one.
---
That'll no doubt make it even funnier, I wonder if they do other meme stuff before the big finale.
---
Did this dude just say that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to stun Freddy while awake and that it is a bug? 
---
Dude, lay off the coke.
---
I found this one pretty funny [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFvLH9bSezU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFvLH9bSezU)
---
But ye, i feel like theres a lack in spirit players, and everyone keeps saying how much potential this killer has
---
Maybe I‚Äôll try and look them up. Someone please get one of these guys to see this üòÇ
---
He‚Äôs just standing there...T-POSING!!
---
Removed - Shaming other players, no salty messages of any kind
---
Self care, adrenaline, dead hard (or sprint burst) and we‚Äôre gonna live forever
---
Monto has done some spirit videos
---
Aftercare has good parts a lot more than the bad parts. If you're healthy and they're injured, and you can loop (Since you're a p3 Quentin main, I'd assume you're a god looper), maybe it would be better for the killer to switch targets, so the injured person can heal and the other 2 people can do gens. If they're able to loop, though, then they're just being jerks. Still, Aftercare gives you total map awareness, which is something Empathy and Bond can't do. Autodidact is another one of my favorite perks, but whenever I use it I tend to get 0-2 stacks per heal, and We'll Make It will always be a huge boost to healing speed. Sloppy only reduces heal speed by -20%, so We'll Make It will be 180% healing speed with Sloppy.
---
Because self care is obvious and adrenaline, dead hard to give an extra life and we‚Äôre gonna live forever for blood points
---
I just faced a doctor who did this lol
---
been using it on freddy A LOT recently and must say it slows the game down A LOT. they never made it to the endgame. 
---
Removed - Shaming other players, oversaturated content
---
Why yes actually! a ds user that doesn't dc if they miss or get juggled
---
I expect people to act like decent human beings. 
---
Wow, that would turn a suck perk into one that I think would approach meta. I would sure as hell run it often. 
---
That's a myth.
---
Sure, it isn't necessary but survivors wouldn't run it with just a counter added. Extra BP would warrant a lot more attention from survivors. Besides, survivors are in desperate need of more BP generation increases.
---
Removed - Spam
---
***Last warning.***
---
First time I played Doctor, I was just doing it for a ritual, so I "Chased" people in Treatment mode. Never switched to Punishment.  
---
But now I feel like Doc is becoming my favorite killer... Can't believe I used to treat him as something to complete daily rituals.
---
I've been experimenting with it, and now I pretty much only save it when I'm not sure where the killer is, or I'm 1-hittable and can't afford to chance it. Walking everywhere is super bad, and only a step up from hiding in a locker all match.
---
Agreed I dont even get it.
---
16,08s 
---
Gameplay wise, I agree with you, that‚Äôs a terrible idea. But lore-wise, why is it that Freddy can‚Äôt interact with awake survivors but awake survivors can interact with Freddy? It‚Äôs kind of just a weird hole in the lore.
---
Git Gud, Scrub 
---
123
---
It's not lag because its THAT HOUSE specifically. Somehow there is a bug in coding (idk i'm not a game developer) that causes THAT PARTICULAR HOUSE to fucking warp spacetime in 8 dimensions. 
---
You think you traveled 10 meters one way, when in another dimension you just walked into a wall and got hit by the killer. Then the illusion stops and you warp through walls and time.
---
Nah. He ugly 
---
I find this happens all the time on xbox. You're not doing anything wrong it's just how it is 
---
Especially because I would've gotten my 600 Boldness bloodpoints from that totem anyways.
---
Issue with the save files. If you restart and he's still level 4 there's nothing you can really do about it. Happened twice with my Leatherface from level 30 back to 25...
---
It's pretty long, I think 16 seconds, 32 when it's self-caring. Botany will definitely speed you up a good bit though, knocks it down to about 24 seconds if I did the math right.
---
Dwight head and legs, Freddy body arms and weapon.
---
Oh I have been in this situation.
---
I recall a time where the friends friend said we should all tell this Killer to Kill themselves. Holy shit.
---
And YES, I reported him!
---
Probably 3542 seconds if you don't have sloppy butcher effect.  
---
/s in case you don't get it.
---
Sometimes it do be like that 
---
That's not his fault ;-;
---
After playing a couple more matches that‚Äôs exactly how I play now :D
---
Hello Bri K. You forgot to block the part where indy drummer added you and it shows your full name. One of the upper bubbles.
---
I always feel so bad for the killer because the people I play with aren't that good at the game so they almost always message the killer after the game and I have to always apologise for them afterwards.
---
they can't interact with him, per se, it's that he interacts with the "real world" in the trials.
---
I mean yea if you jump in a locker when the killers coming you are playing wrong bc good killers will just immediately grab you out of them 
---
Which is fine but at least give me the points as if I had struggled!
---
He‚Äôs not a Spirit main persay as he mixes it up a lot, but HybridPanda has some pretty entertaining Spirit videos. (: 
---
No, killer is already way more rewarding. The problem is console optimization sucks. Frame pacing is complete garbage. Anything makes the game stutter.

---
Welp, I'm here before there is a rant here about DS and NOED.
---
I go for the pointer 
---
Just got this game yesterday btw
---
Or just play identity V
---
For perk builds check Monto, he is very good player. Panda is funny and I like his streams a lot but I prefer Monto to learn some tricks and builds. 
---
Wow that‚Äôs impressive! :)
---
I die to Freddy often. I don't change the way I play. But I also don't run self care and it seems like I can never out run a Freddy. I rarely see him know console but since I picked the game back up a month ago I don't think I have an escape vs a Freddy yet.
---
I'm at 3k and I still feel like the one on the left
---
Unless it‚Äôs confirmed by the devs perhaps stop trying to say that it is true? 
---
Freddy is constantly underrated. Is he a good killer? certainly not. Is he the worst character in the game? Possibly. Does that automatically mean that he is hot garbage and picking him is basically throwing the game? Definitely not. Freddy is *much* stronger than people give him credit for. He slows down the game just by virtue of him existing, he's a phenomenal tracker, he can get free hits on survivors during the dream transition, etc. His only real problem is getting pallet looped, which is something a lot of other killers have to deal with too. From your post, you clearly don't play him very often, if at all, and if you don't play the character, don't be suggesting changes.
---
The huntress mother bear outfits toys glitch and stretch in the players vision about 5 times a game
---
Clearly you don't know how to read because those are not "my standards".
---
Survivors are supposed to be hiders. Killers are supposed to be predators. So yes, I'm fine with killers having movement speed increases, survivors shouldn't.
---
So remove noed and that perks it will be balanced 
---
It's literally part of the perk and characters, and giving survivors a chance. Yes, they're annoying, but it isn't that big of a deal (except for adrenaline).
---
I would advise using self care because sure its slow but I don't use it to heal myself all the way. I use it when I'm trying to get away from the killer. So once I lose them my teammate can heal me the rest of the way. 
---
Whichever is closer and more hurt
---
If you die to Rancor, you played badly. 
---
I'm sorry, is this post about noed? Is this post about killers? No? 
---
dont bully LF ;(
---
&gt;I really hate the Small Game argument. Yes, it counters NOED, but nobody will use it because it's a waste of a perk slot. Same reason people don't run Unnerving to counter DS, because it may work, but it's still an utter waste.
---
Considering how many people bitch about NOED nonstop in this sub, why would you call it a waste of perk slot? If survivors had enough of NOED gamers and are not experienced enough to find totems without the assistance of a tool, just use Small Game or a map with add-ons and scan for possible totem spots while traveling from one gen to another, you don't even need to go full on totem hunting. 
---
People don't run UP against DS because in the end whether or not the DS will happen is entirely up to the survivor. If you run small game and if they add a counter, it will be 100% on survivors hand whether NOED happens in the end or not. 
---
hey how did you load the models in? and where did you get them?
---
if anything the killers are crazy underpowered at this point
---
Ah dumb bitch if you remove exhaust perks you remove noed. You must pay for that nerf lol
---
ü§ëü§ë
---
Yeah but survivors literally can‚Äôt lose on that game if they have a brain
---
thanks my dude
---
Camping/slugging forever/tunneling/blocking is just a dick move in general. Killing them the legit way is way cooler (even when done with some op shit).
---
When I watch a streamer, Id much rather watch them get killed by a 5 blink mori nurse rather than watch them get facecamped for the whole game.
---
As someone who plays both survivor and killer I personally never saw those perks as something too difficult to deal with. Just follow the scratch marks or keep your eye on whoever your chasing. 
---
BBQ, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, Enduring. Done. You now counter tons of bullshit in the game and Survivors will hate you even more.
---
Definitely drop Brutal Strength. It's pointless on chainsaw Killers. Just equip charge add-ons and you're good. I wrote a little essay (didn't intend to be an essay at first) on how to start out with Billy: https://xz.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ah4rqh/billy_mains_what_am_i_doing_wrong/

The fact that we sexualize a mentally unstable murderer is ridiculous. But he‚Äôs hot, so... üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Again, is this post about noed?
---
Again you are fucking dumb or what? 
---
Am I mistaken or is this implying that wraith is OP ?
---
My brother said that Matt has the most punchable face and idk why he thinks that. 
---
As a killer main myself i reccomend you actually stop spreading your delusional message when you dont even give a shit about the health of the game. This is about seeing a problem in the game and not a personal attack so dont spread your delusions when you dont know shit and dont care.
---
Again, are you dumb? 
---
Ah, another "I can't deal with this perk so instead of learning how to deal with it I'm gonna demand it to be removed like a manchild" post. Keep em comin.
---
It gives the survivor time to find the hatch first and ends the hatch standoff. It's unfortunate, but there needs to be a way to end the hatch standoff and one side has to win it. I'm thinking it should be the killer because the killer is supposed to be the dominant one versus the four human survivors so when it's 1 v 1, the killer should have the advantage. 
---
Maybe it only temporarily closes or something. Or the idea where it closes until another generator is done. If a killer is camping hatch for two minutes, it gives the survivor time to skeddadle and go do a generator to 99%. As soon as the hatch is closed, they pop gen and it pops open for another two minutes. Killer then has to decide whether to continue to camp the hatch or make sure another gen isn't done. 
---
Do you have any ideas to stop hatch stand off? 
---
*I'd personally facecamp you and just wait till thats over before i go and play normally*
---
My ruin lasts 30 seconds most of the time
---
Face-camping is a shitty thing to do absolutely. Only time I ever face-camp is when I don't get a single hook by the time 1 gen is gone, when the gates are powered.
---
Welcome to the Community!
---
What was your best experience during the free weekend?
---
Guess so. Or maybe Freddy. But he‚Äôs hardly OP.
---
Clearly youre just a shitty killer who thinks he deserves kills/sacrifices
---
I guess all the other overpowered Survivor perks that let you escape Killer does not count in this equation huh?
---
Adrenaline is possibly the most situational perk in the game lol
---
but gen rush isnt real though
---
its something salty killers made up so they could pretend that its a bad thing for survivors to literally do the one objective they have quickly
---
I'm waiting until this new album called 'NOED' drops. 
---
Or just trying to have fun with friends?
---
That‚Äôs all that matters. 
---
I only need the Billy and Doctpr specific trophies. The Doctor shouldn't be a problem, since I've played him plenty of times before, I just hate playing Hillbilly. I've only played him to get my adept and I didn't have a chance to use the chainsaw effectively because it was the 'the Game' map. So I have to start from scratch and I'm complete ass with his chainsaw.
---
did the match start like this? did anyone else but you see this? ARE THE COWS OKAY?!?!? 
---
Gotta use quick and quiet dance with me lithe for maximum Houdini potential
---
Low tier.
---
Devour hope. Enough said
---
For a second I thought you were asking for .... billy to get fixed seen the result of your round but then I read below the picture ... silly me 
---
Myers is a biscuit! Let him sop you up!
---
Agreed. This is why I don't understand the huge complaints some killer mains have about SWF. I used to hate it myself but I realized that if those groups are anything like my friends, it is going to be a good time. Honestly I get more "toxic" games from full solo groups.
---
Not in an SWF, it can really fuck the killer over.
---
You don‚Äôt actually think that noed, instadown hatchet and an ebony equal out to DS right? 
---
Huntress is a dlc so you don‚Äôt need to play with huntress to get the platin trophy or were you just trying to get all the possible trophies?
---
That‚Äôs not true in certain situations where killer happens to be chasing you when last gen pops, because eventually they will get a hit
---
Ahahaha what the fuck. 
---
I would beg the Entity to please come take me before whatever fresh Hell was about to be unloaded on the map
---
What perks? There‚Äôs no perk as strong as DS on the survivor end.
---
Wow someone has a lot of pent up rage
---
It‚Äôs a shitpost buddy calm your tits 
---
We're Gonna Live Forever
---
You get 25% more BP postgame (up to 100%) for every hook rescue/killer grasp save/hit taken to protect another survivor
---
If you're truly a good survivor you can see the shimmer as the Wraith moved when invisible.
---
I played for 2-3 hours tonight with it - got it once to 5 stacks, few times to 3 and thats it. I think its usabsle only in party with other ppl where u can constantly heal other people otherwise it is just on paper  fun but you nevet get to see it in game
---
I don't know why everyone hates leatherdaddy :(
---
He's my main killer and honestly I love his chainsaw.
---
(And no I don't use NOED or Insidious)
---
I mean, I get that Leatherface is just a meme at this point but I honestly think that he can be a pretty decent killer if played right.
---
You know they have Rancor from the moment the first gen pops, though. That should be your cue to let some one else work the gates and play more conservatively in the late game. Sure, there will be those times you're unlucky and happen to be both the Obsession and also in the middle of a chase when the last gen finishes, but that doesn't seem very common. 
---
Well, the last lunar new year event there certain amount of event hooks and event generators on the map. Using/completing those gave bonus BPs (I think around 4000-5000). Halloween was similar with the hooks, but for survivors they added a secondary objective to collect nectar from blight flower things. BP gains were around the same for both of those. 
---
BBQ, Enduring, Iron Maiden, flavour perk
---
My favorite experience was when DS finally got nerfed. Oh wait. That didn't happen. And now you guys are just forgetting you ever talked repeatedly about nerfing the perk for over 6 months and even stated in a stream that the perk was horribly overpowered. 
---
I expect a nurse whine post from OP in a couple weeks
---
That wasn't something to put the cows asleep...
---
To be fair, Legion deserves it.
---
Mid-tier, not very strong, but not weak. He's viable but vs a good group of 4 tryhards, like anyone else besides Nurse and Spirit, will get his shit pushed in.
---
LMAO I'd lose my nerve too if a t posing killer was after me
---
~~Not~~ My proudest fap.
---
So. Use. Sprint. Burst. Thats the actual answer to ypur problem. The perk changes you want already exists in another perk.
---
i‚Äôm a toxic cutie
---
Both
---
I think he's saying that if you want to avoid Decisive Strike, some combination of the stuff in the graphic are necessary. 
---
It was originally going to be pretty good but they nerfed it before release and it isn't too great now. Just use botany instead. 
---
Just another day of getting BVHR‚Äôd 
---
I don't specifically care if someone gets salty, even a streamer, if they're stupid as well though then it's fucking hilarious.
---
Rancor synergizes well with STBFL. Leave them until either the gens are done and kill them, or just kill em last.
---
Again, most situational perk in the game. 
---
The finger addon is an insta down but you have to hit the survivors directly with a bottle then hit them to down them 
---
Itisdecent heads remove 4 hatchets so they aren‚Äôt worth using unless you have the infantry belt 
---
Noed can be COUNTERED by doing totems. 
---
Turf of hair and tombstone will make you stalk way slower so if you‚Äôre planning to use both get ready to hold m2 for the majority of the match and if you decide to use one and the addon that increases stalk you still have to use another addon to make it viable. 
---
guys literally only want one thing and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting
---
That actually makes more sense, thanks for the explanation lol
---
Same on ps4. Tonight when I was playing with my friend blue screen appeared when offerings got burned MY PURPLE SHROUD, ;_;
---
Self Care, No Mither, No One Left Behind
---
Enjoy your 100% escape rate
---
What about monstrous shrine? That's just a fucking joke of a perk AND the most situational.
---
You KNOW as soon as he hits T3 hes coming after you to impale you on that gun
---
I think they should add prestige 4-6 on each character with each prestige giving a Legacy skin. BUT, the 4-6 bloodwebs would be the same as they were when you could get legacy, ie much much larger and denser and more expensive. 
---
Would be pretty rare and exclusive but still achievable for players after 2016. Plus, if you got it before, you got it easier than it would be under this new system. And all the new characters could finally get legacy skins.
---
Thoughts?
---
You‚Äôre probably using him wrong, when I use Freddy, which is 99% of the time, I tend to put as many people in the dream state as possible in a short period of time before attacking one. I also use perks that allow me to see people when the finish gens/BBQ, which makes it easier to track the non-asleep survivors. I consistently 3k/4k as him. He‚Äôs basically a killer that‚Äôs used to wear down the opposition.
---
It's the killers face light
---
I'm very out of the loop. Would someone mind explaining to me what new event is coming?
---
Once you realise you can get hits by just standing still, she becomes a hell of a lot more fun
---
That's the buffed version of bloodwarden
---
Guess there are more Ace mains than I thought there were
---
Enduring, BBQ, Ruin, Bamboozle is imo the best build for billy
---
god same
---
I'd actually like an alien killer. Even if it's not a licensed one
---
About 20% of my matches as a survivor hang on the loading screen and force me to close the game through the task manager. It's been like this since Legion was released on live servers.
---
This has happened so many times I actually got mad reading this
---
I know they said they only did humanoid characters, but aliens would be amazing. Opens up so many cool possibilities for maps, items, etc. 
---
Bloodpoint farming simulator
---
What is franks and cold dirt.
---
The healing change nerfed his one real strength. Since slugs can recover all the way to 95 percent and be one tapped up he lost a good chunk of his late game power.
---
Wouldn't mind seeing Predator added somehow. Though.... Since we have the wraith they'd probably have to keep the invisibility out for him.
---
Any killer is weak unless played by someone who knows what they're doing.
---
Short loops? Do you mean like loops in general? Because short loops specifically are so incredibly easy to bypass as a killer. Huntress can't be zig zagged forever. Good Huntresses will flick, or just hold their hatchet until the surv is right next to them, or just not even pull up their hatchet at all. There's a lot of variety to Huntress's play. 
---
Hag is another killer that's not invisible. Same thing with Nurse actually.
---
&gt; I highly suggest either Tinkerer or Monitor and Abuse.
---
Er, wut? If you're chainsaw-ing around the map then they can't hear you anyway until you're right on top of them. Tinkerer is fine IF you don't have BBQ yet. 
---
Engravings add-ons are garbage. All of his add-ons except ones that reduce charge time are garbage and you should never use them. 
---
I'd probably try and kill them both, but start with the pointer first and give the other a chance to leave the area. On one hand, I empathize with the frustration of loading into a match with a troll, or a burger of a teammate who drags you down. On the other, playing with teammates means more than just benefiting from them when they make good plays that help you while refusing consequences from bad ones, or expecting your opponent's help with it. 
---
It‚Äôs not at all situational, unless your considering more than just the perk itself. 
---
The best ones are the people that don‚Äôt crouch when unhooking against hag..
---
Do it, but bring Calm: Carter's Notes + Calm: Class II, Unnerving Presence, Distressing, BBQ &amp; Chili, Huntress' Lullaby, and a puzzle piece. Never death-hook anybody, and after you have five stacks of Lullaby and four stacks of Chili just AFK in treatment near the 3 closest gens. You'll get heaps of salt.
---
You do need it lol. He can be looped just like any other killer
---
There are actual stats from BHVR showing that only 6 percent of load outs have it.
---
Watching few games of Monto with the insta down clown, didn‚Äôt seem that hard to down the survivors.
---
Iridescent heads are always used with the infantry belt and it‚Äôs just so op especially on pc.
---
Turf of hair and tombstone both alone with some other decent add-on are very strong and can easily win you the game.
---
Noed can be crutch when survivors aren‚Äôt swf because there might be just one totem left and that‚Äôs usually the hardest one to find. 
---
I hope your joking. Or just new. 
---
bruh just learn to be a good survivor player.
---
Yes that is how it works.
---
Iri heads are pretty broken man. And most of the time, if a huntress uses iri heads, they're using infantry belt. I agree with the other things, though. 
---
If you're truly a good survivor, be aware of your surroundings.
---
Nooooooooooooooooo
---
Quentin is OP 
---
I love when I don't have obsession perks but get to be the obsession because sometimes if you don't wiggle right away the killer will dribble you and help you fill up your bar
---
Truth. Being a kille is stressful. Could care less when I play survivor, unless I'm facing myers. That dude gets me every time lol
---
The best ones are the baby Claudettes that you see quite clearly see but even if you're right behind them playing the god damn to bone they'll still commit to the tall grass in the corner 
---
And BP
---
Using Ruin on Nurse or Billy doesn't make you a bad Nurse or Billy. If you can't win without it because you aren't good enough at applying map pressure with the two killers with insane map pressure, then you aren't good at them.

Nah ruins a waste anyways shit gets cleansed within a few minutes anyways
---
tell that to the borrowed time glitch it is still broke and is only fixed in the ptb
---
If the team is like rank 20 - 10, he pretty much destroys. I played him for the first time and couldn't figure out how to hit people until halfway through the game and still ended up with 2k.
---
claudette just said the n word infront of me oh god shes on her 2nd hook she cant hear us shes got airpods on claudette you gotta press space
---
I had exactly the same experience - knew about the game but didn't bother to try it out until a Free-to-play weekend and instantly got obsessed! Welcome in the fog, mate! :)
---
I actually got the Mori one recently using the Spirit prayer beads build with the totems, In my case I used Rancor, HG, Thrill of the Hunt, and in this case, most importantly, DH. This requires luck obviously, but even if you lose DH, you can at least get three or four kills. I don‚Äôt run it often, but it seems like the only way to reliably get a mori without using an offering. I ran Rancor for security, but it didn‚Äôt end up coming into play. With no Ruin, it took awhile for the survivors to pick up on the Ruin, and when they did, they were already exposed. 
---
I absolutely adore playing Freddy but that's only because I have played the game so much none of the other killers are a challenge for me, EXCEPT Freddo.
---
I think twitches are fun and nice to play against. But thats just me
---
yes its true
---
Hmm, I know you don't play nurse and apparently don't use ruin on Billy right? Why do you use it on huntress since you're so good? Every game I see you play its a 3-4k.
---
They were obviously messing around
---
I wish trapper had that stun resistance
---
You would be surprised
---
Quentin is my main since Day 1. &lt;3
---
Swap Bamboozle or BBQ for Spirit Fury.
---
Best addons are Tuning guide and Thompson's mix or Primer Bulb. Depending if you want instasaw or insta cooldown.
---
I've been using Monitor and Abuse, Discordance, Tinkerer, and BBQ lately. Slap on noise reduction for the saw and watch Survivors shit their pants as you suddenly charge in from nowhere and slice them in half.
---
They could've at least given it a skill check or something. I understand why it doesn't but It annoys me beyond belief when I'm having a good game and then hatch
---
really? idk seems to soon as that would be almost 2 weeks of the event going on I would think
---
So yeah, I repeat. Sit, and fix yourself. You're making excuses as to why you're a bad person. Sit and better yourself.
---
if you‚Äôre down to the last two players, knock one down but don‚Äôt hook him. i wouldn‚Äôt recommend camping the body, that tends to either a) irritate people or b)if it‚Äôs a swf they‚Äôll just tell them not to come heal. but you don‚Äôt kill off the third person you have a little bit bigger chance of knocking down the fourth before the hatch opens. 
---
Slug the 3rd guy and go look for the 4th and hope and pray that the 3rd guy doesn't just disconnect to give the fuccboi a free hatch escape. 
---
If you're asking how to grab them when they use the hatch you just tap the melee, you don't hold it down like doing a lunge attack. 
---
If you're asking about how to deal with hatch standoffs, you don't. You just hit them and let them get their free escape because the assholes will seriously wait as long as humanly possible to get their free hatch escape. 
---
In SWf at low ranks DS is the time needed to rally your friends to body block and flashlight. SWF +DS teams are try hard as hell and make many killers not viable.
---
Ain't that the truth. I tell my friends "fuck you!" When I have it. I don't even run obsession perks so loading into a game with those tendrils is just evil!
---
just adding to the salt really
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Moonrise
---
Thompson house, fuck off. That map is so survivor sided. Whoever this guy is, I hate him without even knowing anything else about him.
---
On good survivors DS is undoubtedly the best perk in the game. If you don‚Äôt believe that then I‚Äôm afraid your a lost cause.
---
No, they said Enduring!
---
First game of hillbilly since launch week and 4K'd FeelsOkayMan
---
Always the pointer. He gets a tunnel too. 
---
Wraith when cloaked ends a chase. Rendering the perk useless until he uncloaks.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs just gonna be a while if you save. You only get so much. Just don‚Äôt DC from games since I believe you always get the same amount of XP to level no matter the length of the game. And you can only earn up to 300 shards each level once you get high enough. (Not quite sure what level you hit that cap since I haven‚Äôt hit it myself yet.) but it‚Äôs very feasible. I had nearly enough just after a month of playing but decided to get some perks from the shrine instead. Just depends how much you play. 
---
There should be a better way, like a skill check or the gens are really quick or something
---
It starts the 29th. BHVR confirmed it ages ago when it first leaked. I expect 2.5 tomorrow, though.
---
That whole article is dedicated to why this reasoning is incorrect.
---
The fact that given enough trials the distribution should converge doesn't mean that you have any new information about when a streak is going to end. A streak is as likely to end as it was last week and it will be next week and doesn't change. 
---
Check again bud
---
But that doesn't change the fact that it will eventually converge. That's all I'm saying, and we are continuing to increase the number of trials. I have no information about when it will end, but given enough trials it has to end.
---
I suggest legion üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Just kidding, you forgot about him. I‚Äôd say if you want a survivor go for Jeff, if you want a killer go for clown or spirit. You forgot the clown and Kate too üò•
---
*using Claudette because of ochido 
---
I know it's just confirmation bias but I swear I've never played a match against a chill Quentin. 
---
They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
---
Wait did u mean to reverse the text? 
---
No double BP. It's going to be like the Hallowed Blight with side objectives to do that give you extra BP and progress toward free cosmetics. Only this time both sides have to do a side objective, not just the Survivors.
---
This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs the best perk though. 
---
One word: bloodpoints
---
Thatis him, but you know, toxic.
---
Ok.
---
\*4-Mans as nurse*
---
Because they were burned? Once your passed the offering screen those offerings are gone, their effects applied to the loading match. Doesn't matter if it loads or not, they're used. It's the risk you take.
---
I don't care much about cosmetics, actually. I use the cosmetics that are already given by default on the character, and I manage to be proud of what I create.
---
It‚Äôs worse then terrible. 
---
Seen a few posts about it. I had the same thing, but as a survivor
---
It's a joke because almost no one uses him from my experience. 
---
Calm down Dr. Satan!
---
i posted something exactly like this screenshot a month ago and i got bullied and hate for it so i‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre not getting attacked at least
---
Power kinda reminds me of Billy's with a mix of Legion's. I love the perks and concept though.
---
Borrowed time for the campers
---
I also love empathy. Am trying replacing it with aftercare atm, but still unsure whether this will stick.
---
Average pp?
---
Now that you say that, I was injured and telling him I needed healing on the top floor. I watchin him slam his head repeatedly into the staircase and gen and him saying "ok let me heal you" ok come here "i am" no bro you are right at the gen.
---
Bot getting any kills is a testament to the player's lack of skill, not the Killer's lack of power.
---
Some one added Garry's mode to dead by daylight.
---
If you're by the hatch, you can wait for them to jump in and mid-way through you'll be able to grab them back out
---
Using Claudette with patrol cap, fitted button-up (light blue, muddy combat boots (Booty shorts). Killer gonna chase this ass and enjoy the show
---
**MRS. SHERWOOD GET DOWN!**
---
Looping means nothing, that's the literal chase-mechanic of the game.
---
If you think Billy needs Ruin you are not good at him 
---
This is awesome. They could add a map in space. Give survivors astronaut outfits. I want this. 
---
Ah my b
---
I made tru3 camp me and ban me from his chat for asking why. Gotta admit that I'm proud of that.
---
anyone who says he‚Äôs low tier doesn‚Äôt know how to use him properly nor understand how versatile he is with perk combinations
---
i consider him to be in the upper mid tier and that may just be my bias but he‚Äôs my favorite to play (and the only killer i play but that‚Äôs hush hush)
---
Who shit in your cereal?
---
I play as normal and then check out their perspective after the match. Good learning opportunity for myself.
---
This is a shitpost, right?
---
It's not about the killer, it's a out the player. I've seen Freddys 4K Discord Premade SWF and Nurses get 0k against randoms.
---
WGLF - When a player unhooks a survivor, the unhooked survivor does not leave scratches for 10s.
---
I love how you approached the fire witu caution. "Will this hurt meeeeokaynoitdoesn't"
---
Wait is that Bitter Murmer on a Myers? Lol what
---
All in all you seem like a toxic manbaby. Its a game. Who cares. Are you angry about losing your rank? Awwww thats so sad. How many times have I seen wraith with sloppy butcher abusing that bug? Once. You make it seem like there are legions moonwalking and wraiths with sloppy butcher in every other game. Grow up.
---
Because it would be a trash perk otherwise.
---
Ah, Part 2. The Halloween 3 of A Nightmare In Elm Street.
---
lol yep
---
You done complaining?
---
Never have done movement speed before, so I took a guess.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Could always be buffed! 
---
10 seconds seems like way too much time to me but I totally like the idea of WGLF getting a rework. Good job. 
---
I'd like to see a corrupted priest or some sort of savage hunter.
---
Or Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf. 
---
Leather face, he‚Äôll just down all of them.
---
Play with fire ya get burned my friend. 
---
Freddy as he is already dead and he pulls people in the dreamworld where he is a God and decides everything that happens. 
---
115% sounds better, it's the base movement speed. I really like the perks though and this looks pretty damn professional. You did a good job
---
Haven‚Äôt even played for 10 months and I got 96% of the entire game, DLC and all. (Because I‚Äôm lucky as fukkkkkk)
---
P2 Jake. Then P3 Jake. Then throw away the rest of the list
---
I'm more confused by the insidious.
---
Yeah, this happens. I've been playing a killer that I have almost no perks on and I keep getting matched with SWF survivors with 4 tier 3 meta perks. It's a little infuriating.
---
You ready to help? 
---
When I play killer trapper is one of my favorites. I place traps in places I would never expect them as survivor. I always get people in chat saying why would there ever be a trap there it makes no sense. That's the secret lol. 
---
This game reminds me a lot of Starcraft only because when I play it, I get stressed out and immediately wonder "why the Hell do I play this?"
---
I have played only 1 match and have no idea what's going on.
---
No, your are conflating two areas.
---
What else are they running?
---
If we run by your logic, obviously the other perks must ALSO be the best perks in the game.
---
THUS proving DS is not the only extremely good perk.
---
"Are you thick kid? You just proved your own argument wrong." - you said it.
---
Thank you!! I was worried that be able to use the power in chases would be OP and too similar to Billy. 
---
You don't count
---
perk tiers should be done away with and they all should be tier 3 as their base
---
All perks mentioned here are good. I like to use Discordance and Bitter Murmur too, for those juicy cross map snipes.
---
As someone that still missed ds sometimes, I felt like a god hitting it.
---
afaik Some default cosmetics are only given if you buy the DLC i.e. feng's cardigan+bun. I'm pretty salty that I wasn't aware of that before I bought her wish shards. :( 
---
üòÇüòÇ I usually put it wherever I would run as a survivor.. works either way 
---
Why tf would u want jake? Worst teachables of all survivors
---
Get used to it, it's not going away
---
"I've only ever seen it happen one time so therefore no one out of over a million people that play this will ever have to experience it because it can only ever happen to me."
---
And you want people to take you seriously when you're so unaware of game vreaking bugs and exploits. Ahahahahaa I can't even with you. Thanks for the laugh. üòÇ
---
Bbq, then ruin to grind for points
---
Spend points on Megs teachables (sb is meta)
---
Level Claudette to get self care
---
Level your killer main. Play whichever survivor has youe favourite teachables
---
I had someone camp me the other day when I asked why they said because I was a claudette and they're toxic. I hadn't even seen the killer all game until they got me.
---
Oh trust me I know. I've been around since 8 second self cares, shitty gen kick regression, and true infinite loops. But even back then I didn't go up against SWAT team level Claudette squads as much as people claim nowadays.
---
Deranged pursuit ‚Äúdown someone while in killer instinct‚Äù it takes at least 2 hits to do that (with Franks mixtape)  but the 1st hit in killer instinct MAKES IT SO YOU GO INTO A RECOVERY, so in conclusion FUCK DERANGED PURSUIT.
---
Tru3ta1ent plays Spirit really well. He uses her mind games well, which other killers can‚Äôt do.
---
PC players will never know the pain. 
---
A friend and the rest of their swf joined my perkless Myers lobby so I messaged him, pretending to have just gotten out of a game and looking for someone to play with. 
---
It only took him most of the match through my oddly specific taunting to realise that I was the killer. 
---
So funny.
---
I disagree for tanking hits, at least depending on how long the aura reading lasts. It helps telegraph who the killer is going to chase even after making distance/losing LOS so that you can quickly evaluate whether to heal or keep running.
---
I can't think of a decently balanced benefit to give to hook blockers though, affecting the wiggle bar would probably be too powerful
---
nah I feel you.My game will almost always crash if I‚Äôm playing for at least an hour and a half.Also if I leave it on rest mode and start it up again,I‚Äôm pretty much asking for it to crash.It‚Äôs fucked up but we can‚Äôt do shit about it.Devs just gotta bless us.I play on ps4 so it‚Äôs hell sometimes 
---
Have my upvotes, nemesis
---
I've been playing this game idk how many hours and I - until now - thought they were pigs. Huh.
---
Freddy. Wait until only one is left and weakened, then sleep them. Easy win.
---
I used to play her a lot in the beginning. I have to admit, though, that I got the 'From the void she kills' trophy in a farming match, because it's otherwise nigh impossible to get
---
I don't know why this perk didn't get the same treatment as Deliverance.
---
Only safe unhooks should count. The taking a hit/bodyblocking etc is fine.
---
They said it was gonna be in Summer? They said the optimization was gonna be December. 
---
TL;DR: Self Care and two others. lol
---
You just countered your own advice to run Nurses Calling. Sloppy is much better because you force them to heal for longer, and leave them 1 shot if they don‚Äôt.
---
If you run the perk to widen field of view does he open his other eye?
---
Slug the third person and go hunt for the fourth one.
---
I seem to have far more crashes when I play killer vs survivor. It‚Äôs very annoying as it will freeze during loading. So I have to kill the task ugh 
---
might be the case üòÇ
---
And why do they have physics
---
So think of it like the campfire. You all throw in your offerings into the campfire before you leave. They burn on the first page of the loading. Once they burn they're gone. So once you start the loading process they have already been consumed so it doesnt matter what happens they're used.
---
Spirit she is already dead so she can‚Äôt die she has visible scratches and cuts what‚Äôs a chainsaw going to do
---
The ‚ÄúI cheese chase mechanics‚Äù build: 
---
Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bloodhound.
---
The game is still going downhill for about some time now, the player base is more toxic than before, there are people who have more than 5000 hours and say 300 hours players are players that are starting to know the game, I'm sorry I play other games besides DBD
---
Wait seven seconds and then say that to my face.
---
Would be a great opening animation for that perk of him cutting it off and installing one of those hooks that hold his eye open lol.
---
Facecamping wraith is the dumbest shit ever. He thinks he's being so sneaky but he's not even softcamping. Legit just standing there waiting for someone to save the first hook. In the last 4 games I played, 3 of those were wraith and one was Michael. All of them just straight up facecamped because of the free weekend, so we pretty much left every survivor they hooked to die.
---
Before some smartass wants to be like "hurrr he can't hit you while coming out of the bell you should be able to run" 
---
No. No you can't. Did you forget addons exist? This fucker skips leg day but he's still sprinting at us and just camping whoever he kills until we pop all the gens and leave. But at the end of the game, the first person to get hooked just had to wait for queue, got hooked, and just had to sit there with the wraith wandering around 10-15m while everyone else got to play the game.
---
What? 90% of posts here are shitposts and memes, i love it.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me too, except I also get no refunded, did your bps get refunded?
---
It wouldn't matter, unless they changed it you don't get credit unless you do 100% of the opening, a teammate can't touch it at all
---
Damn I guess that's a rip for my party streamer :(
---
I'd like to mention that is an A-Pose and not a T-Pose
---
Nope I still had 25k bp and I spent like 400k last night 
---
The only ones I ever see initiating a hatch standoff are killers, though. Whenever I'm killer, I'll just let them go if the hatch is available. When the killer is camping the hatch when I play survivor, it gives me plenty of time to find all totems to deny NOED, just in case, and 99% all remaining gens. 
---
Care to link that. Today alone I've encountered NOED 4 times out of 15 or so games. I cleansed all the totems in 3 of them though
---
Cause I played a lot of games with escape cakes and party streamers and wglf 3
---
Exactly. Now get ready to be attacked. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Waiting for the owner of Hellraiser to sue BHVR for stealing the doctor's design. Look up Hellraiser's surgeon action figure, then compare it to the doctor. BHVR completely copied Hellraiser's design... (there was a post about it here a while back, we're just waiting for the lawsuit). 
---
Yeah dont attach value to offerings only items. I rarely get good map offerings (I have like a million jigsaw pieces) and the game always crashes when I finally burn a good map.
---
Whatever ingame coms system rules put in place would do nothing as third party software could be used instead, like it already is. 
---
NA
---
That‚Äôs tough, sorry dude
---
Pretty sure it makes a point about how her back or dominant arm gets broken, but she gets up and carries on like nothing happened.
---
What does that have to do with the Optimazation? They said it‚Äôs this year....
---
My cat found out she can chase stuff while I am playing. I bought a heated blanket and put it next to me while I'm playing so shes not inclined to so this.
---
It adds a bunch of cosmetic items.
---
Sorry sorry, but this game is going downhill with the optimization issue and network issues 
---
Woah, take it easy man
---
Wow they really are stupid
---
The match lasts too long. Legion would get more bloodpoints in a quarter of the time with less effort
---
I hear that and they kinda mapped out some bigger internal issues for this year. The optimazion was in theory supposed to be a big one time thing in December but it was just the groundwork, I guess is the best way to define how it feels. Then over the course of Spring months, roll out more stuff to give the game more consistent stability. Then on top we have Dedicated Servers in Summer so hopefully by June/July we can be having much more fluid and on par/standard gameplay. 
---
Oh okay, thank you!
---
"QUACK"
---
(I'll be disappointed if you don't get the reference)
---
I think if you‚Äôre in the animation, it should still count, same if they all DC, have it count as kills
---
What about pokemon?
---
I think you mean enTIDDIES
---
I was pretty stoked when I finally got the platinum, Evil Incarnate was one of the hardest though since people kept disconnecting before they got moried.  Finally back up to 100% of all the trophies, Deranged Pursuit was so dumb.
---
Breh, he doesn't need them. He moves fast enough as-is. Engravings are completely worthless on Billy. 
---
We- I mean, Quentin's don't exist. It's just a visual bug, you can't actually play as Quentin.
---
The Nightmare DLC isn't even on the store. It never was.
---
I swear I'm the luckiest player in DBD.
---
I've had all of 4/5 crashes in over 800 hours, and have never experienced any of the major bugs that you see in montages.
---
More speed never hurt anyone

The nurse would just use gorilla warfare once only a few remain. Spirit could also do the same, just that's she's stuck to a physical plane, while the nurse isn't.

Nemesis?

feels bad, Aussie here. hope you get your game buddy!

DS idk what you're talking about I haven't seen a Claudette  in weeks
---
What did he say lol 
---
but huntress's era was in the Tsarist period
---
Did I say that? 
---
If survivors couldn‚Äôt interact with Freddy when he was in the dream state you would literally never have a chase in which Freddy doesn‚Äôt begin it with a free hit. 
---
It‚Äôs a balance issue and lore wise makes sense as the entity controls the game in the way it chooses meaning it‚Äôs not truly Freddie‚Äôs dream world. 
---
Well, can‚Äôt read your perk idea since the link leads nowhere.
---
You also seem to lack the cognitive recognition that bloodlust doesn‚Äôt always activate at a loop and break the use of it, doing anything you said, is still pointless, besides, most loops can be mind gamed and you will still lose at least 1 gen going after a survivor, 2 if they aren‚Äôt playing stupid
---
1 gen can't be done in 15, even if all three work on the same one. And 15 seconds, *bravo* you want a gold star? Try to stall for at least 1 gen then get back to me. 
---
Source? 
---
Because every official source says either "late January" or the end of the month.
---
Saying stuff like "it rewards the killer while he's/she's failing to protect their generators" then going on about how you can't possibly cleanse all the totems in the next paragraph.... Maybe NOED punishes survivors who only focus on gens and don't cleanse all of the totems before they finish the last one, instead.
---
BBQ is usually the rarest one to get in the Shrine next to Ruin.
---
Happens every 3 matches +- to me.
---
I never said other perks weren‚Äôt good... I said that DS is the best perk in the game and none of the other perks can compete on the same level as it. This doesn‚Äôt mean that other perks are all bad. 
---
Buddy, your making yourself look real bad here and I don‚Äôt feel we should continue this at the rate it‚Äôs going. 
---
1. Hallowed Blight was 2 weeks. This seems like it's going to be similar.
---
2. The PTB came out on the 8th...
---
we do. and that's why we're pc players. 
---
It motivates me to get off my ass and help teammates
---
Especially when they're the first one to DC when they can't bully the killer. 
---
Something interesting I thought of recently would be proximity voicechat. That'd work better in favour of the killers and be more immersive for survivors. I think if implemented right, proximity voicechat could be a great addition to the game.
---
yeah man it was crazyyyy
---
5 seconds is enough, and it'll work because BBQ and Chili has an effect as well!
---
Currently playing Legion to get his perks, and he might actually be the dullest killer in the game to play (IMO at least) and he can be god damn infuriating to go against. My boi/girl/group of edge lords really need a rework.
---
That's not illegal though. I'm pretty sure that's within the rules as it gives the tournament exposure. 
---
And 
---
No worries! Thanks for asking! :)
---
Don't tell him that the dedicated servers would be meant to solve all those problems.
---
I hate the over the pallet hits when you‚Äôve cleared it due to lag.
---
Yeah, you did.
---
People already whine that Freddy gets "free" hits, even though they're not really free. People either don't respect Freddy and move very far before the timer runs out, or they don't seem to understand that the chase has started even before they've finished the dream transition. A good Freddy will use his transition flickers to mindgame. 
---
It is a balance and lore issue. It shouldn't be happening. Freddy and the survivors should be restricted from interacting with each other before the latter is fully asleep.
---
Legion isn‚Äôt *that* bad
---
It‚Äôs the killers job to make survivors make mistakes, there are scenarios in which the survivor even has to make a 50/50 GUESS to make the right play. 
---
A good killer can use mind games at effective points in a chase to force a hit upon the survivor and after a period of time down them, regardless of skill.
---
I never said DS wasn‚Äôt a poorly made perk, I simply said that it is the strongest perk that survivors have as on good survivors it is, hands down. 
---
Not surprised a legion player is saying this 
---
He is badly designed tho.
---
The requirement is being removed McLean said in his stream it's not this midchapter patch though so hopefully the next one
---
Well, I've spoken to the organizers and they said the way the map is decided will be changed due to that.
---
One thing at a time
---
Spirit most definitely 
---
I wish WGLF had a secondary effect as well, just like BBQ. I would‚Äôve liked it if the rescuer (or the unhooked) saw the killer‚Äôs aura for a few seconds to know if healing was safe but Breakdown does that now. 
---
I like the scratch mark idea, though the time is a bit long. What if it recovered the rescuer‚Äôs exhaustion status? This could be nice for protection hits during chase as well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
&gt;most rng reliant
---
Oink
---
yeah homie we can play civ v instead
---
How does he have 14 million subscribers, wtf I've never even heard of him

---
WGLF could use a rework, compared to BBQ its kinda trash
---
Survivors should basically get a BP bonus if someone ragequits as well, because you have no chance of winning a 3v1 with 5 gens up unless the killer is much lower skill level, AFK or wants to farm.
---
Ah my bad, I didn‚Äôt realize I said fuck Freddy, allow me to go and change that. Oh wait, you made that up, now ain‚Äôt this epic kiddo.
---
Freddy does not get free hits now and the people that claim he does are just bad however if pallets could not be used on Freddy during dream transition he would get free hits almost every time without the use of windows. 
---
It‚Äôs only a lore issue for Freddy, which doesn‚Äôt matter in DBD due to the game having its own lore otherwise this would be a very strong argument. 
---
In terms of balance, this would simply make playing against Freddy incredibly unfun and wouldn‚Äôt fix and of the core issues that Freddy has. 
---
Nothing much, just wanted to share my "fun" post game chat. Feel free to downvote.
---
Except literally holding the game hostage, like body-blocking the last Survivor into a spot on the map.
---
i completely agree on aftercare, it's a good perk that gives you total map awareness which is great bc i play exclusively solo BUT my teammates bring the killer to me WHEN IM HEALING. i thought that was just an accident, no this has happened during different matches. maybe in a month or two i will give this perk another chance. also in what world are we p3 quentin mains good loopers? 
---
Sounds neat
---
Let him live 
---
&gt; I have no information about when it will end
---
Exactly, so why are you saying stuff like this which is wrong: "the odds will converge and BBQ will appear and with the number of trials we've had it should be soon."
---
&gt; but given enough trials it has to end.
---
The point is there is no way to know how many is enough trials for it to end before hand. It does not "have to" end given that the shrine and game isn't going to go on forever.  
---
I play anything, but Killer a lot.
---
I had someone DC right before getting hooked once. The killer hooked them, and I was actually able to pull the DC'd person OFF the hook and heal them to full, and get full altruism emblem/BP for it.
---
Honestly I feel like that's the way it should be all the time. Killer basically gets full BP from the survivor, and the survivor gets a chance to get the altruism/benevolent they are missing out on.
---
As someone with a potato...yes we do
---
My darling console players: you willingly walked into the blaze set for us (PC). We have no sympathy,  and may the entity have mercy on your soul. DuuDuuDuu. 
---
It's 14k xd
---
Instead of "one thousand" it's "mil" and instead of "million" is "milh√£o".
---
Since "mil" is only 3 letters, it fits there and youtube shows it as just "mil", as to one million, it's just and M
---
Didn't say you said those exact words, that's the gist of what you said, "kiddo". Nice passive aggressiveness. 
---
Again, those hits aren't free.
---
It is a lore issue. Freddy's in-game description says he is the indisputable master of his victims' nightmares. Your argument is moot
---
Playing Freddy can already be unfun. This needs fixing, in addition to all of the other crap Freddy has to deal with. 
---
I really think some Ring girl-esque poses would've seriously added to the creepiness factor.
---
*Tapp gently cries in the corner with his 3 perks no one remembers*
---
I use autodidact in swf and it works great as they let me use them for stacks. Not so great with randoms though, even with empathy.
---
still made mad points tho lmfao
---
*NOED activates* 
---
Silent Hill could never!!
---
1.) Killers cannot make survivors do mistakes. The survivor is entirely in control of where to go - it's the Killer who has to follow-up on the survivor's response, during a chase. It's not the killer's job to make survivors make mistakes, it's the Killer's job to hope the survivor makes a mistake, and capitalize on it if it occurs.
---
2.) If the survivor is 50/50 guessing on the right play, then he isn't a "good" survivor. By "good" I mean Ace gods that loop for 5 gens while moon walking. Those dudes with 2k hours literally do not make mistakes and, as a killer, you cannot catch them. You literally cannot. They do not give an opportunity for any killer to get close to them in a chase. Every vault, pallet drop and loop is perfect and efficient. There is nothing a killer can do, unless they can teleport (oh look at that, Nurse).
---
3.) You're right, you never said DS wasn't poorly made. I was just emphasizing how it's for bad survivors to cover up their mistakes.
---
I'll sum up the core mechanics of DBD right now. The killers hope survivors make mistakes, while the survivors hope other survivors and themselves do not make mistakes. The entire game revolves around the survivors, whom (by their own skill) dictate how the trial goes by the number of mistakes they make.
---
Both. They fixed some issues relating to audio cues when she is spirit walking, and with adding she becomes quite the power house. 
---
Replace Freddy with Clown and you've got it.
---
The thing is that every Killer is a decent Killer if played right. Even Freddy can still down Survivors and hook them. The problem I personally have with Leatherface and a lot of people have as well is that he doesn't add anything to the game. He plays like a default Killer and the only thing that differentiates him from other Killers (other than camping power) is literally just Billy's power.
---
I dislike Leatherface more than Freddy for that specific reason. Freddy might be unfun cancer but at least it's not boring. I at least feel an 8 hour slog; I don't feel a match that's done in 8 minutes against a Killer who essentially has no power.
---
I have a love hate for dedicated servers. It'll be amazing for the game, but once the devs stop supporting the game at some point, they'll turn the servers off and finding games will be impossible. But if it's p2p, you can always find games well after game support as long as there are killers queueing. 
---
Of course it's never when something not important is happening
---
You're not special. You aren't the chosen one who's figured out and unraveled the Freddy mystery. 
---
You have zero choice but to tunnel with Freddy. If you sleep everyone 3 times (3x hooks), that's 84 seconds. That's enough time for 3 gens to pop and doesn't even include chase time. 
---
I wiggled off a Freddy's arms. Three times. WITHOUT Boil Over or sabotaging. No Petrified Oaks, either. That map has some of the worst hook spawns in the entire game.
---
I have a """" friend """ like this... If we... If H E escapes (just him, nobody else matters, i don't and neither the rest of the team) he's like "gg ez EZ  E. A. S. Y.  Kys lol bb killer git gud." but if he dies...oooh boi... Imagine a six year old crying for losing a game..."OMG TUNELLER (killer only chased him twice the entire game) CAMPER (Killer is on the other side of the map) TOXIC KILLER (ironic no?)." and he's also constantly bringing the killer to someone else on porpuse to save his life
---
I said that his lore was irrelevant because dbd has a separate lore, quite different from, ‚Äúfuck Freddy,‚Äù and sorry about the, ‚Äúpassive agressiveness,‚Äù just taking a page from your book.
---
Those hits are free in most situations, you being a Freddy main should realize that, especially once combining addons.
---
This is due to them still needing to include a description of who Freddy is. The entity controls what is aloud and what isn‚Äôt in DBD making Freddy‚Äôs actual lore worthless in terms of gameplay.
---
Freddy could really use that rework. 
---
Legion.
---
I said "PC players" not "potato PC players". lmao  
---
So... more Ohmwrecker stuff? :D
---
Ochido kicks door down*
---
DID ANYONE SAY
---
M O L E S T A T E G I R L S?
---
I mean...
---
T O X I C C O M P I L A T I O N ?
---
Body blocking in general is toxic
---
The Buzzer Beater sweatshirt for Meg, I know...
---
Quentins are usually some of the best survivors in the game, or toxic, from my experience. And Aftercare, even if I had bad experiences with it, I would still use it because it allows you to reach SWF levels of coordination, without SWF.
---
We just ask for a rework man, it should still be fun for atleast a majority of the people.
---
DOWNVOTES INCOMING AAAAAAAAAA
---
True lol but still you have those games where you ALMOST wiggled free and you wish you had boil over. Just like when my friend could have easily crawled across the map and out the exit gate if he had tenacity since he was seconds from escaping without it and he got caught lol.
---
Spine Chill has saved me so many times in similar situations.
---
Haha thanks, that makes me feel a lot better
---
guess the joke went over your heads üò©
---
Haven't had that problem with pallets yet but played two games as killer in the past week with invisible gens.
---
3 times they were offered a better perk in the bloodweb...
---
No you typed it in the chatbox. Was just curious what would follow xD
---
Hey, players who are terrible at killer but still want to hit rank 1 don't dislike it.
---
I never said they can make survivors make mistakes, which they can but whatever. Not here for a lengthy discussion right now.
---
There exist certain loops where if the killer double backs the survivor won‚Äôt know until a second or two later. In these situations the survivor can either keep running or turn around and guess the killer doublebacked. 
---
Go watch zubatlel or ScottJund play killer to see this as they do it often in chases.
---
The core mechanics of dbd are for survivors to do gens and open a gate and for the killer to chase the survivors and kill them.  You overcomplicated it. 
---
At lest she kinda looks like a survivor now?
---
I need all three of the nurse trophies, 1 doctor trophy which is the uh 500 shocks one, all the hag trophies and a feast for the entity and then I should have platinum. I should already have adept Hag but unfortunately somebody dc'd during my 4k match and because of that I didn't earn it and I'm terrible as killer so I don't know if I'll be able to do it again + being ranked 15 with tryhards to purposefully de-rank themselves to rank 15... 
---
Billy got tired of meg's shit and cut himself to die
---
Oof, it was a joke?
---
If this were true then Tapp, Adam and the Doctor would have stronger perks. 
---

Spine Chill and Premonition are a full on waste. It's not 2016 anymore 
---
I've seen A l o t of toxicity on this game since i started but holding the game hostage WHILE streaming gotta be the most toxic aaand dumb thing i've seen so fat
---
Keep your secrets
---
well he still is bad imo he just breaks the mechanics the survivors depend on to escape or slow the killer down
---
like 18 months ago this was a thing.
---
Less figured out how to play him and more figured out how to break his power, but yeah more or less.
---
This is the issue with people taking e everything TydeTyme says at face value
---
Simply the best killer perk in the game.
---
You described the basis of the game, but not the core mechanics on the game - how it is balanced. If you want me to simplify it even further, here; Big Dude 1 chases Small Dude 2, hoping small dude 2 makes a mistake.
---
Zubatlel and ScottJund are good killers because they capitalize well on survivor's mistakes. You literally just gave an example - the survivor looped around an unsafe area where the killer can double back on them. Zubatlel and ScottJund didn't force the survivor to do that loop, they didn't force them to be unaware. The survivor chose to.
---
I have played multiple games as Freddy where I‚Äôll hook a survivor just for them to be immediately saved so obviously I sleep them both. Most of the time I get called a camper and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm playing Freddy I can‚Äôt teleport to the other side of the map in an instant you fucking walnut. 
---
Only true for certain killers, for example the nurse makes this go the other way round. 
---
When the asshole survivor glitches inside the locker so you can't do shit about it
---
Looping and doing gens is a toxic strategy. 
---
Stylish despite The Doctor's horrific appearance. Very nicely done.
---
He‚Äôs so handsome omg. 
---
I agree completely, though big_yobama91 is right, it‚Äôs a little different for the nurse and a little for the spirit too since she has the most mind game potential of all the killers. 
---
That‚Äôs why I like both the trapper and the pig. You can kind of force survivors into those mistakes. 
---
Killers don‚Äôt even want to try anymore. He got what he deserved. Genrush these twats.
---
I love how everything mentioned by him has to do with killers
---
So whats the phrase I'm looking for then. If my statement is not what I believed to be the core mechanics, then what? The game's fundamentals...?
---
I think the only reason why Nurse is good is because she doesn't have to wait for survivors to make a mistake, and huntress to a lesser extent. 
---
Then why can't he consistently get 4ks?
---
Freddy or Spirit. Freddy can't be hurt because of Dreamworld and Spirit is already dead.

---
yeah, maybe im too harsh on myself but still wouldn't consider myself a good survivor. im more like the worst lol well, that's the issue with my teammates, zero coordination despite aftercare. i can wave all day, do you think meg would come to the gen im working on? of course not, she starts working on another even though we have to fix just one to open exit. im mentioning all negative experiences, there's been a couple positive ones, but it's more of a rarity in my case. i would really like to enjoy aftercare. ughhhh 
---
I'd rather not because the perk seems designed for late-game and if it's a hex it'll be cleaned. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Huntress_Lullaby Huntress Lullaby also has an addtional regression penalty but you have to hook survivors to power it up, the regression penalty does not increase with tokens, and it has the added affect of making the skill-check chime noise have less of a delay or be silent. 
---
Blackout is a bit similar to [Fire Up](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fire_Up) where you get benefits from gens being done. 
---
So IDK if it really should be a hex perk. I'd rather it not but this is coming from a P2 doctor main so there's likely some personal bias from me going on. 
---
I didn't realize the link was broken. Also you still don't understand your point.
---
Like Nurse, one of the most well-liked killers?

I‚Äôd rather not either.

The match started off laggy, both the Trapper and his traps were invisible. Cows were flipping the f out from afar already, unknowingly stepped into a trap while laughing my butt off watching them.
---
The Trapper got me twice this way, the third time was me simply giving up.
---
The other survivors didn't seem to have experienced the same issue. At least while spectating, none of them seemed as fascinated by the cattle tree as I was. And they also avoided the seemingly invisible Trapper, as well as his traps!
---
~~I came to the conclusion that the game is excluding and hating on me.~~
---
I mean, they are pretty equal.
---
Each mask is tied to a random box on the map. 
---
Is it faster than when they mend himself
---
Last time I was on this sub everybody demanded buffs for Legion, what happened? legit asking 
---
I am going off the actual lore not the botched representation the devs have made
---
25% chance for a box to have the key.
---
i just played a game where all 3 traps the pig used were the 4th box to unlock for the survivors so i guess we mustve been super unlucky
---
Not sure.
---
This is so sad
---
I don‚Äôt mind lobby skipping high ping but lobby skipping just because of who the killer is is pretty trash. I also think it‚Äôs bad for killers to lobby skip survivors
---
Ughhhhh why isn't this realllllll??? I got so excited reading it.
---
yeah it says that with e1 michael its still useful

fucking fix this shit 
---
What is? 
---
No.

Ha my summer ends on the 29th

Enduring + Near a Ledge is a better combo.

---
I really really like these perks, but maybe tweak the power a bit? It seems like he‚Äôs just a better, more fun legion. I like the 2 stances idea but the movement speed seems a little too high, maybe something more like 125% would be a bit more balanced imo. Other than that awesome work!
---
That would make legion be able to wreck this perk when it actually is a decent counter to him currently
---
I run dc :) 
---
Haha everyday. Also i have a small space between keyboard and screen where my cat likes to sleep, and sometimes he does sudden stretches that pushes play on my keyboard and turns the volume to 0 or 100(usually on 50) and shit like that. Really helping me with my chase when music suddenly start blasting in my ears at traumatising levels of volume. 
---
Yeah what the other commentator said. Or allow survivors to recover up to 50% of their exhaustion while sprinting.
---
I‚Äôm all for the extra points but I wanna add that any bonus altruism points in the game need to be for SAFE unhooks. Stop farming your teammates people. It‚Äôs not fun for the survivor or killer 
---
The Game isn't even a good map for killer anymore.
---
That's the only way I saw to do it? What did you think?
---
Just stop this whole DS v NOED nonsense, it takes up a lot of the posts on this subreddit and is getting really annoying, it's just people headbutting themselves constantly. 
---
Corn isn't even the reason Coldwind sucks (though it is a reason). The fact that survivors can see through walls removing all ability for the killer mindgame.
---
*Giggles profusely at 0 Sacrifices and 8 hour match length.*
---
He isn‚Äôt trash but he really messes with the current perk meta and people don‚Äôt like change. Survivors don‚Äôt wanna specialize they wanna run jack of all trades.  if people actually had to specialize then other killers would automatically move up rather then creating this crazy rank one nonsense of omega lvl nurses and Billy‚Äôs at rank 1 being the only killers you see
---
Do you play in Antarctica?
---
People figured out about:  
---
1. Tunneling one guy with Frank's Mixtape  
---
2. Moonwalking
---
Bugs like this are ones that I hope they don't fix. Innocent silly shit like this and the sliding Survivors and the flexing Killers make me smile whenever they happen.
---
Valid excuse to camp tbh
---
You think all 3 of them combined equals out to ds? 
---
God don't lol I am a Freddy main because he scared me most as a kid and it's just depressing lol. I still think a Dev hated him as a child and get's off to the fact they make him so weak lmao. 
---
There's me to. I really like them. ;-;
---
Though I do admit that they are very flawed right now and need a lot of tweaking.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what it is, it was your phrase after all. 
---
Nurse is good because she ignores all of the things that survivors are given in order to survive. The only obstacle nurse faces is how good you are at her.
---
put in a ticket to the support team. i did that once after losing a chunk of progress and they were happy to refund the bloodpoints to my account.
---
I'm literally level 15, I should not be with these people

I hate to be that guy, but this is just one of those *git gud* situations
---
&gt;Not a Tapp perk
---
&gt;Tapp
---
    (Yes I know the meme features LeBron James originally.)
---
You know you can just count to like 2 sec and swing after pickup on your obsession to cancel out DS. Ive been hit only a couple of times when i realy fuck up the timing. But 4 people with DS is broken
---
Nope,  ps4 in the good ol us of a.
---
Well, first of all you can't make Bloodlust into a perk. If you do, then you are creating a must-have perk. BUT! I do like the idea. Just implement it as a passive thing and not a perk. Bloodlust should make you able to end **tremendoulsy** long loops, yet shouldn't be "abusable". Getting a decent speed boost to end a loop at the cost of not getting bloodlust for *X* amount of seconds until exhaustion expires seems fine to me.
---
I'm of the firm belief that Freddy isn't bad but rather that every other Killer is better. He can still kill and he has his strengths and weaknesses over other Killers, it's just that his weaknesses far outweigh his strengths. Map hacks, game stall, and perma-invis doesn't outweigh the delay in being able to down a Survivor and the intense RNG involved in your effectiveness.
---
