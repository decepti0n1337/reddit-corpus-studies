Yep. Wait times are hideous at the moment. 
---
I was expecting immediate lobby connections with more players in the pool. Something ain't right. 
---
---
---
deserved
---
&gt;NOED "can" be used even if I do not usually run it on them. 
---

---
NOED is as useless on him as his 110% run speed. I can't figure out why you're recommending this when you say not to cancel out of Frenzy because he's too slow just before.
---
Right now
---
Yes
---
No one expects unrelenting!
---
So many killers dcing when gens get done. With only 1 event offering per web i dont think you can gain much bp this event.
---
Maybe if the matchmaking worked I WOULD GET A CHANCE TO TRY IT
---
As trapper I sometimes I gather all my traps from around the map and put them in one place, then I like to find survivors and down them so that I can show them my trap collection.
---
Laugh while you can
---
Buckle up chucklefucks, moonrise is here and so are teabags and disconnects 
---
...I'm not lying, that is the build that he was using. And it was effective. I thought that Dying light did effect the exit door time but was unable to verify this as I was only able to open the exit gate about 5% of the way. Apparently I was mistaken which makes me a filthy liar. Excuse me. 
---
Unfortunate
---
That’s just immature players showing off their stupidly. 
---
Lol you're a joke.  Probably a camper too
---
This is so sad Alexa play for whom the bell tolls by Metallica 
---
It's funny because it's clearly the least fair realm since the release and bhvr still have done nothing about it
---
I use it all the time. Super useful perk.
---
This post has inspired me. 
---
Time to use the 35 ebony moris I have collectively.
---
If one survivor escapes with a lantern, does every other survivor get 25+? I somehow got the generator points and the lantern point when it wasn’t me who took a lantern away. 
---
It's working now!
---
Is it a space issues?
---
I always run borrowed time and adrenaline. I run into it quite often too
---
This event really sucks for survivor.  You seriously lose the stuff upon your first hook for the rest of the game and can't get it back unless someone miraculously didn't grab one?
---
Well, some of us actually come here to try and have a discussion about things rather than look at braindead memes.
---
Indifferent 
---
They have now fixed the glitch so you're good. :)
---
oki ty :3
---
Tomorrow? It's already kicked off!
---
its about forming a moral dilemma for the killers and survivors alike. 
---
This event promotes the most selfish and sandbagging behavior I have seen to date.  I gurantee BHVR's data will show decreased escape rates across all ranks, as survivors are surface-level incentized to be less altruistic and team-oriented, even though doing gens and working together would net more gold coins in the long run.  
---
Is there no alternative to this where the survivors are rewarded for the TOTAL amount of lunar vessels with which the team escapes?
---
well, true! but thats more of a mental achievement thing. its not really about the game telling u you've won or lost u know
---
I’m the cat.
---
I hate them as both survivor and killer too lol
---
If anyone is going to hatch camp it's always a Claudette. They pick the character thats hard to see fot a reason.
---
I use Bond a lot and if I see a claudette I'll lead the killer to them without a shred of guilt. Its the only way to get them to help the team.
---
Good. I have around 50 Halloween offerings that are completely useless
---
the vessel aura makes you able to be seen if youre in a locker or behind a crouch level cover too. The little embers give you away, so you want to pick it up right before you leave
---
Ahhahah that's hot. That's hot
---
why is this so funny? ( im chuckling so much at this) 
---
Just realized this calculation doesn't work at all. You don't need 900 points for all clothes, you need 4500 to get 9 coins.
---
100 for the first, 200 for the next, then 300 and so on.
---
The disconnects, too...my god. 
---
Im playing solo and getting lobby dodged constantly.
---
"WAAAAH THAT 1 PERDON HAS A FLASHLIGHT"
---
"WAAAAH THAT 1 PERSON HAS A TOOLBOX"
---
"WAAAAH THERES A CLAUDETTE!!!"
---
Normally I can put up with it but at the momen its no fun at all sitting and waiting 10-15 mins just to find a lobby with good ping only to have some bitch throw a strop and lobby dodge.
---
Or literally any other directions. OP is clearly a rank 20.
---
⭕️W⭕️
---
“Works on my machine”
---
Dude you can’t deny swf teams have the advantage 
---
3 points for smashing a lantern. You get 2 for a hook. It's better to just hunt survivors down and only smash lanterns when it's convenient. Or just ignore lanterns entirely and just play as normal.
---
AAAAAAHHHH my Amanda looks so cute &lt;3 if she's into girls  i'll kiss her &lt;3
---
dude, do the gens strategically means NOT LET THE 3 GEN HAPPEN AT ALL.
---
to the part where it happen, I seriously don't understand what's salty survivors' problem? you ever heard of Doctor not being able to chase more than one person or shock one gen at a time? the gens are never in that close distance for him to be able to 100% at all times protect them all. you split in two teams, fix two different gens - furthest from each other. maybe even 3. he gets confused and voilà, one of them will pop in less than like 4 minutes, man. 
---
you just said the range add-ons. means you'll need to shock people several times in order to get them to tier 3 madness. it WILL take time even if they're so newbie they can't dodge your range and width of the single zap because, my dude, the range takes time to actually zap and your static doesn't give good madness gain. 
---
you say you can't do anything, you literally sound like someone who doesn't play long. I legit never had any problem with Doctors on red ranks. neither did my teams of randoms. Doc is lower mid-tier when you know how to loop. and his presence is little bit annoying if one is bad or needs the 3 gen strat. good Doctor never aims for it, he never even shocks you much. 
---
your example of shitty strategy would be acceptable in case of Claudette at least touching gens around. like tap - urban immerse to another one hearing terror or whoosh - repeat. that would be the 3 gen Doc. annoying? yes. holding the game hostage? no because doing the attempt to finish a gen to escape. 
---
and I literally right now see you complaining about 3 gen Doc when it's really not hard to prevent or actually beat lol. it will take little bit of time but you'll get there eventually cause you know you need to only fix one gen. therefore it's all on you. gen is there, opportunity is there. you see Doc, Doc sees you. game is progressing. everyone is playing it. just like if you were tapping gens. 
---
"used to be like you" LOL you can't be like me. first of all cause you're a salty survivor main who doesn't know how to counter Doctor thinking there's something impossible in surviving the 3 gen strat, you don't even know which add-ons to use to effectively execute this strat haha. and wtf is a "treatment shock add-ons"? all of his add-ons are treatment shock add-ons why even saying it. 
---
you're giving me a piece of shit solution, ok? for 3 gen strat you don't need anything special as survivor. really, nothing. you tell me to use perk I don't like using and be dependent on it just for the sake of cases like this one as in 1% of my games instead of having beloved Bamboozle that helps me every game, or BBQ, or PGTW, or literally any other perk that I can need 100% of games? I don't like Whispers. I have no problems locating survivors when they spawn, when they immerse to start doing gens, when they just hide with intention to go do objectives. and I give 100% I won't find a piece of shit in some locker on God damn Lery's or Ormond with its legion of lockers unless I get lucky. even knowing they're in close range, I won't find them without luck because they have one sole intention to hide from me for no other reason than hiding. therefore I won't pull them out of their corner where they're emoting for dozens of minutes.
---
and you being so confident it's not banable is weird cause there's nothing on the rules that says it isn't. it is griefing. griefing is banable. 
---
...weren’t they gonna change it so lobbies fill automatically so its impossible to tell if it’s a SWF team?
---
Is that an identity V allusion ?
---
You're overstating it. Being able to communicate with teammates doesn't immediately make them all omnipotent pros.
---
Not everyone wants to farm or play any differently during events.
---
As a killer main, I'm not doing that. I want that huntress outfit bad lol.
---
But I would say that it's a killers chance to be able to be an asshole back to swf that have been dicks to us. Like, if killers had a punchcard for swf douchbaggery, then this event is like getting that final punch and we can return the favor for all the toxic nonsense dished out to us. 
---
Idk how on the mark I am, but that makes sense to me. 
---
We heard the bell for the event and we all said...
---
"Let the Purge Begin"
---
I can't get Trapper because he's just trash as long as you know where he's put traps down. 
---
Toxic swf groups have made killers more wary of playing against them. I’m willing to host an swf group of up to 2 players. That’s it. Otherwise, dodge and onto the next batch of survivors. 
---
As a killer main with BBQ I support this development. Hide in a corner and do nothing all you want!
---
I have the weirdest erection right now
---
Not much new there.
---
Outstanding!
---
I hope we get more fun bugs with the next patch. 
---
Of course not. I’m just saying they have an advantage that a lot of killers don’t want to deal with when they can play normal matches. SWF effectively start the game with kindred, dark sense, premonition, empathy/aftercare by default.
---
Idk why but pornhub is like 99% weird ass incest porn now
---
Oh God oh no..... Please I have Quintin's I need to take care of 
---
How could I avoid SWFs if I don't dodge the lobby?
---
i think you mispelled, mankini clown
---
1. The killer doesn’t know how long you’ve been waiting.
---
2. If the killer sees survivors with flashy cosmetics and good items join all at the same time and the killer isn’t confident in themself, they will unfortunately leave.
---
3. Why do you like the word spineless so much lol
---
That's just the game. Survivors won't want to play against Iridescent hatchets or a pro Nurse, doesn't give them the right to DC.
---
If you're gonna decide to quit because others are playing in a way that annoys you personally, maybe DBD isn't the game for you
---
I have to wait like 10 to 15 minutes or more to get a game,just by myself 
---
There being quite tight with them so far too.
---
Only having 1 per bloodweb 
---
I personally don't blame the killers for dodging a lobby that has somebody with as shit of an attitude as you seem to have in it. 
---
I dodge lobbies so I can avoid SWF/boosted parties. 
---
Dude I’m not arguing with you. I like this game but SWF changes the way the game is played. Kthnxbai
---
I've learned that attacking someone's character is a great way to get them to do what I want. Keep it up. You're doing great! 
---
/s 
---
Ok.
---
Nah, skill doesn't have anything to do with voice comm taking some fun out of the match.
---
Im playing killer as often as I can. Ill fill that gap for you....
---
Honestly, as a survivor, this is the first time I have ever intentionally deranked. I have had nothing but super try hard killers and it just isn't fun to play a 1v1v1v1v1. I just want to derank and get easy games to get the coins then not play until after the event. It is just systematically horrible.
---
It's because everyone is playing as survivor. It seems easier to get points as a survivor so less killers. Less killers means less lobbies. Longer wait times by consequence.
---
Poor Mikey :(
---
Toxic swf groups like you are exactly why I dodge lobbies. Not exactly helping your case, you toxic bag of waste.

Again, you're strawmanning here. *Nobody* is saying that it's an insurmountable challenge. We're saying that you're enjoying a competitive advantage over your opponent that the game is not balanced around. And let's not equivocate lobby dodging, a mechanic they've purposely designed for killers, with using third-party programs like Discord/PartyChat that aren't even in the game.
---
Both around walls but I mean actually angling while inside the tile. Like whenever I get a coldwind map as survivor and I find a gen in a jungle-gym tile, I'll always try to level camera so I can see between the wood-gaps in the tile walls because I *can* do that with the 3rd person camera - and I shouldn't be able to but because of the tile texture, its possible.
---
Even if they only covered parts of the jungle-gyms on coldwind farms, it would be a massive improvement. Right now there's no mind-game opportunities for killers as you said, and it doesn't make sense that there are see-through tiles on those maps and not any other maps in the first place.
---
I meant to say “do the bare minimum for the hatch to spawn then sit ontop of the hatch and wait for your team to die”.
---
Do you have any tips on applying pressure? I feel like that may be my biggest downfall, tbqh. I’ll play and they’ll have a gen or two done before I hook someone. 
---
Found it. Thanks 
---
Git gud 
---
Delivery Boy Dwight, too...
---
No because you would've picked them up with Whispers earlier and no survivor typically will run at you 
---
yes
---
Why is Laurie in the think section? Also, why is Jake in the N-Word pass section? Otherwise your list makes sense.
---
Same here man :(
---
I remember thinking that once I had all of the killers prestiged I’d be able to play more comfortably with the better add ons and such, but man, time is scarce now :/
---
Thanks mate. Gonna be a long 2 week grind then XD.
---
How most new survivors treat Michael stalking them...
---
Coldwind farms have some of the most unbalanced designs for killer I think, especially if you get bad rng on maps like torment creek or rancid abattoir :/
---
On the subject they should introduce like. Flattened areas of corn in the coldwind farm fields, because the massive areas of corn-stalks is still nearly impossible to track through rip
---
Lost count of the times I had an ascended Huntress camping with Insidious.

oh ya lol. I'm almost up to 2 coins 
---
And I meant to say you're an idiot

Judging by the salty comments, OP made his point very clear and it seems to have struck a nerve lel
---
This fucking guy....
---
Just show no mercy
---
Nice haha. I haven't got 1 yet. I'm 4 short of my first coin.
---
I'll crack on with it tomorrow 
---
This is so fucking funny thanks for sharing 
---
Nice change from the usual distribution of bloodpoints. ^^
---
When breaking a pallet? I dont think so
---
DYLAN!!!
---
Sorry for the salt, just a little angry...
---
Yo I never asked for farming, I don't care if they play differently. But it is an event for a reason and maybe some killers have no interest in it, but there really is no reason for every killer to be bringing in moris and shit like that so literally no one can partake in the event.
---
My beautiful babe! Your art style is great. 💕
---
Getting flashlighted at pallets is literally the least significant time to be flashlighted
---
That kinda happened to me with Fo76 and I had to put 50gb back on only for my Xbox to crash every 5 minutes 
---
I don't lobby doge but OP is being a dick about it. So he's getting negative comments back. He didn't strike a nerve so much as he's just getting a dose of his own medicine.
---
Sorry, I didnt know you were a claudette who spends 90% of the match self caring in a corner and 10% on top of the hatch waiting for the last survivor to die. Didnt mean to hurt your feelings but yeah your garbage. Try not to throw pallets instantly and try to fight the urge to run in a corner after you hear the heartbeat for 1 second
---
The issue is they are purposely make it super hard for causal players to get anything to force more people to buy it. If BHVR doesn't change it'll go the way of EA
---
Someone doesn’t have to participate in the event. If I want to see Claudette scream in pain I’ll fucking do it and you aren’t gonna stop me.
---
It’s not only survivor mains that think it but still he should follow your first 4 words
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE BLOODWEBS LIKE THIS EVEN A THING?
---
WHY THE FUCK DO WE SPEND HOURS GRINDING TO HAVE TO WASTE 2-3 GAMES WORTH OF BLOODPOINTS TO SWIM THROUGH THIS POOL OF SHIT

Leaked footage of a scene that was deleted in Halloween (2018) of Laurie vs Myers
---
Also no Double BP activated 
---
Assuming that you're using Bloodhound (why wouldn't you with Legion) then no, you don't NEED Frank's Mixtape because eventually they will go down. The problem is that it just takes a helluva lot longer. 
---
Frank's Mixtape and the Green add-ons that extends the duration of the Frenzy are the way to go. But the Dirt Very Rare that decreases the cooldown of Frenzy stacks with the Green add-on that decreases cooldown. And if you run those two together the stun is about a second and is very strong for obvious reasons. Legion can actually defend a hook with using those two add-ons: just stick the douchebag doing the hook rush once, cancel Frenzy, and then you can just regular stab them.
---
I remember spawning in as Hag and Myers a few times and needing to pick up my power. Strange times.
---
I was doing a gen then the killer came and downed me, the survivor then quickly did the gen and teabagged me lol 
---
I love how loop is a free space, but I'm a Nurse main. 
---
&gt; I was in the Spirit
---
Believe me, pal.  I wish I was in her, too.
---
This is so wrong, there's no other way to describe this monstrosity. Fuck us all for this existing, me included.
---
Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside.
---
Honestly nothing beats the feeling of doing all 5 totems before the last gen is popped and denying a killer their NOED
---
Blackout after one game
---
There’s no point in trying. SWF defenders will never have a good faith discussion on this. Ever.
---
At this point i'd be surprised if it doesn't happen.
---
Run borrowed time, we'll make it, adrenaline and an exhaustion perk of your choice. I pick one person who's "bodyguard" I'm going to be and that match I literally throw myself in harm's way to protect that one person. And for me, there's nothing more satisfying than a killer camping me from being in their face the whole game and watching my priority target escape. 
---
Another fun one is leader and prove thyself with a tool box that has a brand new part. That is the true meaning of gen rush xD
---
This next one is a little more risky but my friend has alot of fun with it. Put on urban evasion and  the Pebble perk...and follow the killer around. Throw pebbles at lockers. When this doesn't work throw them at windows or at gens no one is on. Or work on a gen for a bit, move a little ways away, and throw your pebble at the gen. This gives other survivors more time to work on their gens when the killer comes to look at the gen they think just exploded from you failing a skill check. I also just find the pebble throw animation to look really funny lol
---
Honestly though, just change up your perks every game or few games and try to have fun. All the events BVHR does are bad. Not sure why we don't just stick with event gens and hook objectives *shrug*
---
Yeah, I'm really not sure how this event works tbh. It's kind of convoluted.
---
A lot of survivors have Adrenaline.
---
Just ask the killer if they wanna farm
---
Please tell me you're fucking selling this
---
If you had to estimate, what would you say it would cost to buy the game+all DLC
---
The irony, a bunny calling a pig little when IRL a bunny is much smaller then a pig lmao
---
Balanced and Dead Hard go together. The 75 percent stun reduction is what makes it broken, very good for looping Myers house and Coal Tower. 
---
Considering your attitude, I’m not surprised that they dodge lobbies you’re in.
---
I have been noticing the same thing. Trying to figure out if this is intended or not. Happened to me when my friend got a vessel and to her when I escaped with a vessel. 
---
How many times did he shoot him? Sorry, always the answer of this particular question I just can’t seem to remember for some reason.
---
well I got 45 as a Killer in 2 Games and 1 was a 3v1 and only 3 Offerings were used in total, so your Math cant be correct.
---
Also, survivors share the Points if they all escape
---
Pebble is the greatest perk.  It confuses the shit out of Nurses when used properly.  And that's the best reason of all.
---
Yeah, Evan MacMillan, the spoiled rich kid... black? lol
---
Pipe down Mr. Smith.
---
pffffttt i played for 2 hours when the event started and didn't get one point and i escaped with zero vessels 
---
I noticed this too. Seems to be only the Huntress event items that have this issue.
---
I'm just putting numbers to it. I will enjoy it and probably get the 2 outfits I want. 
---
Lol couldn't of been me I was banned last night. I've never called anyone that anyway
---
Oh, thanks for clarification. I thought it was a troll...
---
Usually I’d just upvote but I thought I’d let you know I actually laughed out loud
---
If you mean they go back to 0, yes. If you got the first 100, you will then need to go from 0 to 200, then from 0 to 300 etc.
---
4500 points in total. 
---
Yo, 2 birds with 1 stone. Shirtless Clown but with painted black &amp; white stripes to go with this mime face.

just check on steam?

you can even do that on a phone
---
Wow is that rank 20? that Billy was bad he could even grap him
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think you did a pretty good job so far
---
I feel like if we help them with the guilt, walk them through it, like, *"I know you're just trying to enjoy your night with your buddies, it doesn't make you a bad player for using boosts, lets just agree that this system isn't working for everyone so BHVR can address it better"* or something, less people would feel like their competency is under attack or obligated to defend themselves. I'm trying, man. 
---
Oh I can? Awesome lol. I know very little about steam
---
It avg out the ranks then tries to find a suitable host
---
Nope us killer mains think he's fucking stupid too.
---
\- A little too complex for a killer. Remember that it should also work with controllers, which this doesn't.
---
\- No survivor listed
---
\- No origin listed
---
\- No perks
---
Honestly, a pretty shallow killer, with a power that's too complex for DBD, and doesn't sound good either.
---
Reddit does not equal the sales numbers, though. Licensed chapters sell more copies faster and bring in fans of the character to potentially buy the base game AND the add-on. 
---
Selling copies and DLC is how the lights stay on- there’s a cost to maintaining DbD, from staff to office space, and that’s why anyone who loves it should hope they keep making content- they can optimize and bug patch as well, but if they stop producing any new content for months at a time it’s going to be bad news.
---
Just swap the role Everytime you have a shutty game?
---
and yep, you sound very salty :D
---
Herman is literally African American...?
---
I just played against a killer that legit tried to 4K, like wtf?? Did they forget to read their calendar?
---
Its not that serious. Sometimes I wish that noed activated when there’s only one survivor left... you can realistically only get like 1 good hit on a survivor before the jump into the hatch. 
---
I don’t do hatch standoffs, so if you find it... you can have it. And if I down then near the hatch then I just carry them to the hatch
---
I'm waiting to see a MySpace plug hit them with the unexpected 
---
I absolutely agree and I'm certainly not one sided on it.
---
I just feel like much more killers are using moris than usual, and wanted to just bitch about it lol
---
like $80?
---
Stop right there or the mods on this sub get triggered and crucify your good words
---
I think it's safe to say killers don't get points by letting their opponents do their objectives. And hooking 10 times isn't physically impossible, since each survivor can be hooked a maximum of three times, and 4 x 3 = 12. Did you destroy any lunar vessels after hooking a survivor by chance?
---
I was in a game and the killer had an ADD-ON! I used my Brand New Part and ran right away from him, I tell you what!
---
Did I say "Don't use moris"? No, I didn't.
---
I was just bitching, as it is tagged in salt/rant.
---
My best advice. Turn off chat, and if you want to tunnel than tunnel. If you want to facecamp than do it.
---
I'm a survivor main and I wide with the killer in most arguments, survivors are entitled little whiney shits.  
---
I watched a survivor in my lfg on ps4 run a killer and pallet loop him by an exit gate for like 5 minutes while I watched at the gate. He kept teabagging him and pointing and laughing that he was shitty.  
---
Killer took him down right by the exit ad he tried to get away, i laughed so damn hard and called him out for being a douche. I refused to save him and said it was his own damn fault lol
---
He screamed a bunch and kicked me from the party. I walked over and pointed for the killer to kill me, he deserved it for putting up with that piece of shit.
---
I hate toxic survivors. They'll bitch and cry about a killer tunneling and camping but they only do it because assholes like them make the game so incredibly unfun to play. 
---
So much things, can we just dance around sex ?
---
It’s just annoying really, removes any sense of challenge for the survivor. I play to win and the hatch makes that impossible sometimes
---
My new wall paper, thank you for this its perfect 👌👌👌
---
I do not like this. 
---
Cool that's what my math came to
---
Two things, mainly. It alleviates some if the stress from doing three gens solo, getting multiple hook saves, and running the killer for minutes at a time, while your potato teammates are incapable of touching gens and get downed in seconds flat. The second thing is it makes sure games don't drag on forever, with the obvious exception of two stubborn people getting into a stand off. Imagine if there was no hatch and the last one just crouch walked everywhere tapping gens and leaving before the killer shows up. If you want to 4k so bad, slug. If you value your time, just accept the potential three-man on move on to the next game.
---
Person was most likely grouped up with one of the low rank survivors. 
---
Nope, just a baby Meg who didn't know how Michael worked! 
---
just put all the dlcs+game in your cart and check it :)
---
Now it's JEFF'S scream lmfao 
---
Lol that's kind of exactly what I figured it was. But I try to play respectfully, so it just feels like recklessly being dicks to me.
---
I totally getcha though, I've seen my fair share of "toxic" survivors and then some.
---
doc looks like he's takin a leak
---
Okay, any survivors to try?
---
This is literally the comment I was going to make. Adrenaline and Borrowed are a must in 95% cases
---
It also doesn't work...
---
It’s such a let down
---
If I had money I would gild you 
---
I read Huntress' voice as a female version of TF2's Heavy
---
I've played about 5 games on each side and honestly it's pretty boring. Maybe it's just how long it takes to get a cosmetic piece, but nothing really seems great. The amount of event offerings and items per bloodweb is kinda meh and doesn't  really feel rewarding. 
---
Lol alright. They did some bans for people exploiting the prestige glitch too if you did that. 
---
lol You do you, man. Never asked anyone to stop, just asked why.
---
Thank you! 
---
Why else play killer unless your gonna be gutting or torturing Claudette? Who cares about some lamp?
---
Same issue here on Xbox, it's been like this for months no matter what rank I'm in. I'm so sick of waiting 30 minutes to get matched with someone who has terrible ping
---
Survivor conditions are much easier. As a killer, I'm getting so many DCs on the first down, half the time I'm pulling single digits. Only reason I'm sticking to killer is queue times.
---
I get where your coming from and I respect your opinion but I think an easier solution would be that every game could only last 15-20 minutes, or once the third survivor died the last one only had to do one generator to escape, hell even letting the killer close the hatch and make the survivor do something to open it would be better than an easy win.
---
I’m a console player, Stop flexing on me 😤
---
you can try the no cd build where you hit them, run in Front of them to block pallets and deactivate your Power to down them.
---
Works quite good, even on Red ranks
---
Killer Hook people and destroy lanterns, Survivor Find lanterns, do gens and escape with lantern. That’s the whole event
---
I’ve seen ebony moris in every game i’ve been able to play so far. It’s incredible the lengths killers will go to make sure survivors are miserable during events. 
---
Adds one more lantern per envelope and (assuming it's the same as the other events) enables bloodpoint gains from the event.
---
omg the nerve on some people
---
what whats going on ? r/OutOfTheLoop
---
Looks like a katana on her hip
---
That's why I play survivor lol. Althought I do switch to killer to get some revenge when some asshole swf tries to get me killed.
---
Who else can agree the skins suck? Fang looks good and the Huntress looks eh but as an Ace main I’m disgusted to look like I should be pulling wagons from tourists in the China Town.
---
Is it just me or does it seem like vaulting is broke since the last patch also.  It seems like no matter how far I am from the killer he always hits me 
---
No I’m talking over half of my games just miraculously disappeared out of my library when I turned my console on this morning.  PUBG, DBD, FO76, BO4, R6S, and BF1 all disappeared. 
---
It adds one more lantern per offering. A survivor drops a lantern when hooked. It then goes back to where they got it. While a survivor is hooked, the killer can destroy any hanging lanterns they see
---
Definitely not. Was just focusing on chases and hooks.  I’m pretty sure I didn’t even get nine hooks as the last person I hooked hadn’t been hooked twice yet.  
---
The gen thing certainly wouldn’t make a ton of sense, was just the easiest explanation I could imagine for the extra points.
---
For real. I kept dodging lobbies where 3 joined at once until I got one where I had 2 solos and a duo. One from the duo changed to a p3 Claudette at the last second. Turns out she was rank 2, and someone else (maybe her friend) was level 6. Like what the actual fuck?!
---
I could be wrong but I think Evan McMillan -an American- is white. Oh, and The Wraith is African and The Doctor African American. And we shouldn't forget that Amanda was raised in 21^(st) century America while The Huntress was raised in a Russian forest during WWI.

Either Bad killer or they want something new

---
Uhhhh okay, pal
---
Like I said it normally doesnt bother me but word is getting around that queue times are a bitch right now and it would be nice if killers could make an effort to help the game along.
---
Funny how they think they have a right to dodgs lobbies but then cry foul when survivors dodge moris.
---
Seems like you only get like 10 more points as survivor than killer.  Might have to just grind killer for this one.
---
same for ps4
---
Doesnt matter when you're on the hook and the killer wont leave and 95% of them run NOED.
---
Every game.
---
Event started and for a while you couldn't make any progress
---
Already got Huntress and working on Feng
---
Consider the fact that Survivors play SWF with mics and DS and they think that's A-Okay 100% fine. In that case then anything goes. 
---
Ive only had 1 mori tonight and im prettt sure thats becauae everyone in the lobby had a toolbox.
---
That's a pretty depressing move by them :/
---
Yeah, I've been playing killer and just kinda ignoring the event objectives. I burn an envelope only if I have no other decent offerings and I just smack lanterns when it's convenient, since you don't even have to stop or slow down. Lanterns are only worth one and a half hooks for you anyway, it's better to just hunt down the survivors and make the games quicker.
---
Now if only they stopped DCing on their first down... some people are a-holes.
---
Console player. Lost two kills due to survivors running in circles, disappearing and reappearing four feet from where I swung. This has been happening too often. Uninstalled. I shouldn’t be this stressed about something so trivial, but I am. Done with the game.
---
Who was the killer?
---
I used to hate them but now I hate DS more
---
I heard someone calling Legion a "Survivor main killer". For people who don't know how to play killer.
---
As a survivor main, I can relate
---
I think everyone has misconstrued my intentions with this post. I will admit that yes there is some salt behind it...obviously, but usually with this community both factions would work together to get the most out of the event. It seems though that this time nobody is working together and its the first day. I would be able to understand actually trying after the first week when most people have the cosmetic that they wanted. I'm red rank on both ends and play this game religously. I know that this community is capable of good things when we come together. I remember farming during the halloween event without any troubles with killers or survivors. I'm thinking that because the rewards are somewhat scarce everyone doesnt really care too much about reaping the most rewards they can with this event. Just wanted everyone to come together that's all guys. I have no hate for anybody except people who farm hooks with WGLF :,)
---
yeah no shit, I dont think you understand my point

Relevant meme is relevant

I guess clown didn’t get a party invite :’(
---
Just usually play the game with a duo partner but I enjoy killer more I just don't want to ONLY play killer which it looks like I might have to, till rank reset.
---
I honestly just bought all mine with auric because the event has been AWFUL. 
---
only if she also has self-care
---
Try playing killer
---
play long enough as killer, you'll get lonely. we just want a friend cause survivors don't want to be our friends :c they're too busy clicking their flashlights and butt dancing like madmen. 
---
but yeah, in all seriousness I do think it's the fact that you're alone as killer. getting bullied by swfs would be much less frustrating and sad if only you'd have like a pup on your side that will wave its cute tail and cheerfully stare at you in the end of the game instead of just Entity being displeased with you (T_T
---
Does eternal loading screen count to game crash? If not that one needs a field too.
---
Legion: "Baby want a bottle?! A big cold dirt bottle?!"
---
Survivor queues might be better next week, but for the first few days, Killer all the way.
---
These two arent comparable. 
---
I got into a game earlier and the killer lunged and hit me even though I was right in front of him, like of course the toxicity wouldnt stop for an event lol 
---
pig on macmillan
---
Thanks, now the OOF theme is stuck in my head with that DBD sound. Thank you, you bitch.
---
But I play solo and get dodged too just because the gane loads me in the same time as other players.
---
Killers dont know who is swf and who isnt. They dodge based on fucking hunches.
---
I mean if we ever get an AI buddy it better be the Horse. That good boy gets slapped and poked by so many killers and survivors. I just want to hug him.
---
Huh. Okay. You'd think they'd give some kind of visual indication where they are.
---
Kinda reminds me of JoJo’s bizarre adventure 
---
Yes they're for sure persecuting you and not just trying to have fun
---
I’m not really that focused on what survivor mains have to say, I just used that metaphor as like a comparison, what I really care about is finding a setup that isn’t mindlessly good, y’know?
---
Yeah only if you dont pressue
---
Glad im not the only one that noticed nobody is doing gens. I've never seen them go so slow.
---
Sorry we like to have fun 🤷‍♂️
---
Where’s the clown? ☹️
---
sorry did you say everypony
---
1. Some people don't give a shit about the event. I myself don't like huntress and don't want very, very Chinese outfits for survivors.
---
2. An early mori can prevent a gen rush. Considering survivors get rewarded more for gens at the moment you do what you can to take control of the game timing early.
---
Farmings not that important to me anyways. I jist want to have a good solid match, get some event points and be on my way to the next one.
---
Why? I don't have a problem with them
---
I feel this. 
---
Plus by his comment that's what? 6/7% of the event done? It would take more than two weeks to achieve 100% at that rate. 
---
Plus not everyone has two hours a night free to play it and that doesn't include bugs, dc's, bad games ect...
---
yes :D no one cares for bronies anymore cause of furries and I always thought the cartoon is actually pretty cute and I like the phrase and finally can use it unironically :c (I'm not a 40yo man, I swear) 
---
This ain’t it cheif
---
I used it to grind 'taking one for the team.' 6 months later I just wanted variation in perk builds
---
Cold Dirt and Joeys Mixtape
---
I Run with Bamboozle for maximum Passage blocking and BBQ Sloppy and thanatophobia/Ruin
---
It really was.
---
Today i learned your penis size directly corresponds with your playstyle in DBD
---
it seems that this event is bringing out a bigger shitstorm than legion
---
Damn son 
---
Its gotten to the point where I just turn the game down until the match starts.
---
I have to say, I like how survivors have more earning potential than killers, it should incentivize  people to play sure and ease up these awful survivor queues. 
---
They always wanted that in DBD. You could be a team player, but you’d risk your team not helping you. People have been playing survivor as “looking at the team as a whole”, when the devs wanted it to be “you or the team, your choice”. It wasn’t just the killer survivors were supposed to be worried about. The event probably sucks ass regardless though (I haven’t played the event yet). 
---
Still better than the hallowed blight...
---
Nah they’ll suspend him. I’ve seen people get suspended for less. PS4 is real strict on that
---
is the event cosmetic also called the donkey jacket? bc i have both i just forgot 
---
That's fair, I did not take into consideration genrushing as a factor. And I get that some people don't want to participate, that's fine.
---
No0b3 is my favourite because he can never hit his DS and that really speaks to me on a personal level 
---
I believe someone did the math and as a killer, it takes approx 180 games to get 9 coins...
---
You say that like there's an appropriate way to shoot a puppy
---
You fell for BHVRs trap.
---
*screaming from doctor’s madness commences*
---
Excuse me, is it one of the "where is Michael?" pictures?
---
There just aren’t enough killers. They need to significantly boost the incentive to play killer.
---
Downvoted because legion
---
And then he saw how much of a shit cunt OchiDO was and stoped talking to him.
---
Is BHVR aware that people here basically shit on them for breaking the game every patch, or do they just not care? This isn't circle-jerk, I'm genuinely curious. 
---
If you’re gonna insult someone with a quote at least be accurate, it’s cocks, dicks ruins the cadence of the line 
---
I mean. I don’t mind buying it. /shrugs. 
---
Killers: *basement hooks everyone and proxy camps the basement the entire match*
---
Also killers: Why dont you get alot of points as killer in this event? God this game is so dumb!
---
Survivors: *only work on gens until two get popped, then proceed to stand still waiting for your team to die to get hatch*
---
Also survivors: Why cant I get alot of points as survivor? This is so unfair
---
Event in a nutshell
---
The last list wasn't funny. Why try again?
---
I like her expression. 
---
SPICY MEATBALL
---
I agree with him. So do many others. Nice insult. 
---
You start from zero after every coin
---
Personally idc about this event, it has barely anything worth grinding for. The two outfits for Feng and Ace don't appeal to me and I don't play killer much anyway. Would have been nice to see a few more options for the likes of Jake (he's Asian too I think), and maybe Jeff since he doesn't have much at all
---
Holy shit I'm sorry that happened to you. This community is more toxic than LoL
---
face camping doesn't last for 30 minutes. you physically can't do that. the person either dies on hook within two minutes or 1:40 if they attempted, either they unhook themselves and potentially have a chance to escape by killer's mistake of hitting too early or sprint burst/dead hard. or they can be saved by teammates. the face camping mechanism does allow you now to unhook even if the killer face camps. so, yeah, the progress goes down real fast and no one actually is wasting much time. killer loses gens and other opportunities to get points with you. but you get the points for struggle and self unhook. while killer gets jack shit for searching the survivor. 
---
The devs cave in to survivors eventually anyway.
---
Why do you think all of them load in together now? It wasnt just about improving the matchmaking, it was to stop bitches like you from disconnecting everytime survivors loaded in together and assuming swf.
---
Keep dodging though and rhe devs will change it eventually.
---
Huntress is the most loveable killer
---
killer only gets no points if he doesn't hook or try destroy the lamps?
---
No, that scenario is 100% in no way shape or form holding the game hostage. Prolonging the game isn't holding it hostage.
---
Holding the game hostage is very clearly defined by the devs to mean the killer blocking survivors in a spot that they cannot get out of forcing the survivors to dc or a survivor getting in a spot to prevent the killer from ever being able to down them.
---
Pretty much any other scenario is just either side making the game last longer. 
---
In this scenario, you could still find the survivor at any time and down them, there was nothing preventing that except for your own skill. That isn't holding the game hostage.
---
I'm trying to play solo and every killer is dodging the queue it seems.
---
survivors average about 8k if the die and 13-15k if they escape. as a kilelr id say ~24k, but as doctor i rarely get below 30k even if i lose
---
No such thing as too thicc
---
Same with PS4. I watch people stream this on PC all the time and they seem to get into matches almost instantaneously. I really don't understand what the issue is with SWF queues on console tbh. 
---
In a perfect world they wouldn't.  But it's been in the game since launch sooooo there is your reason.
---
You would rather circle the map for 10 mins while the last survivor crouch walks everywhere and does gens super slow because they know your checking them over and over? Or lose a few BP and get on with your life? I’ll take the latter thank you. 
---
They fix it bud.
---
its been lobby sim for me these past few weeks
---
I mean patrolling the boxes, ignoring gens and catching the poor bastard over and over as he tries to get his head gear off through the frustrating boxes - box -camping
---
It's like $10, lol
---
Yea. There are nice killers out there that want to just have fun but if you don't see any this event don't sweat it. Killer mains are just getting a little payback
---
Nah, they probably won’t. 
---
Don't let dumb shit like that get to you lol...
---
He is right, it reappeared.
---
you wrote Killers can get 21
---
He added an edit for you
---
it’s probably because you’re in a swf lol
---
That’s the pigs objective. That’s like calling another killer a gen camper for patrolling the last 3 gens and not letting the poor last survivors get out
---
Nah just the brain dead ones, it’s not difficult to look at the sky for a second and continue with your business. I’d actually prefer the Chinese fire crackers, they’re way more noticeable 
---
Tequila. 
---
Well actually it is as once your off the hook they down you again and get mroe points (+1 to survivor found, survivor chased, survivor hit, survivor hooked, entity summoned, player sacrificed etc) its a lot of points for literally standing there waiting then hitting one injured dude instantly as soon as thier off the hook
---
4500 points for all 9 coins is way too much, it's complete bullshit.
---
///SMALL PP DETECTED///
---
but what about them not doing their part of ending the game? cause in this scenario only one side is actively doing what it supposed to be doing. while other does an optional objective that doesn't let the game progress. therefore prolonging the game for other side to disconnect therefore griefing which is, in fact banable. 
---
and where was it clearly defined by devs? can I get a link cause I didn't find any strict explanations. 
---
but it only works once doesnt it?
---
today i met a few survivors that failed their gen positioning. last 3 gens could be patrolled in literally 5 seconds. they couldnt be any closer to each other and had hooks in between them. 
---
those survivors werent happy that i "camped" there. well... what am i supposed to do? walk away for no reason? their penis size was obviously unimpressive like their game insight
---
To be honest, 2 aren't that hard to get, 1 is basically gifted, you wasted money.
---
I was in a college band called "Carressed into Oblivion"
---
Anyone else think this event is absurdly hard for killers to get points?
---
we get 3 per hook and 4 per lamp broken.
---
The problem is that lamps are insanely hard to find and get to, theres no aura for them meaning you have to waste time looking, and if the hooked survivor get's saved then you can't break the lamp at all. Meanwhile all survivors have to do is gens and then if they escape they get a flat 25 points.
---
I've played two games as survivor and earned more points than 4 games as killer.
---
I already had auric cells in my account. I mean it’s my money....? I’ll spend it how I want? 
---
Dude. Idek tbh
---
that's not a reason. what I see is griefing by holding the game hostage as in not doing your part to end the trial. someone in comments said people were banned for these things.
---
I personally don't see why killers ever "respect" the kobe
---
At least once, yeah, but then there was Tombstone Mike. He was kind of a dick lol
---
Unbreakable only works once, but no mither allows you to come back constantly at the cost of going down in one hit
---
.... Well okay. Someone brought to my attention genrushing so yeah, I could see why a mori would be helpful there.
---
I guess that makes sense
---
If survivors have a higher earning potential, then more people will play survivor and thus make the survivor ques longer not shorter?
---
pebble time 
---
really? thats fucking atrocious, did they fix it?
---
kneecapping
---
&gt; 2 games so far and 2 mori’s during an event you’re supposed to farm in. God I hate high rank.
---
The problem you're having is that you think you're SUPPOSED to farm, there are players out there that just play for fun and don't care about the event, expecting the other side to farm because you want them to is a little asinine. 
---
Tbh I'm not super upsetti about it, it'll just take a bit longer to get all 9 coins.
---
This is a really nice picture, I'm glad Amanda is getting some recognition since  you know.....
---
Beautiful.
---
^(Event points, Mr. President.)
---
I can't tell if you are joking or not lol I only played Freddy for 2 times and I thought keeping survivors in dream world was how you're supposed to play him?
---
Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape is actually way better than Frank's. And people don't even know it.
---
More like "No one else burns red envelope, im the only one get to keep the points"
---
I actually don’t play legion. But good one. I’m sure you think you’re so smart for coming with up that’s one 
---
Ok whatever pro
---
I solo play because my friends stopped playing! But that’s a good idea to take a break, thank you! 
---
I didnt say it was a crime. Its just funny that you’re complaining about the event and then doing something that encourages them to keep making shitty events like these. 
---
Nps
---
My only complaint about this event is the toxicity of the players. And that honestly is something the devs can’t help. My games have been legit nothing but moris, or me/friends getting facecamped. I get that this happens even when there are no events, but it’s been amplified. 
---
Cool. I’ll do the same with SWF 👍
---
Killer point gain is too slow and to make up for it killers are being extra toxic. Sure love these events BHVR
---
Lack of killers, over abundance of survivors 
---
no, for the event
---
wtf? why would anyone who doesn't need Whispers 99% of games use Whispers for this 1%? that doesn't make sense. i need Bamboozle and PGTW to not get looped forever and to actually slow down the gen progress cause I don't like Ruin. I need BBQ for points. and I need Discordance on Spirit for better map pressure cause I don't use try hard add-on builds. there's no spot for Whispers to slightly help me in 1% of games. 
---
Okay?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RT68x-AZOQ
---
Yeah events are so lame. Dont get why people act like that. Its in the communities best interest to play normally or just farm during events. But this community is so lame that they think ruining someone elses game is “fun”. Just a bunch of grown children.
---
Little bit late on this, and I’m not defending OchiDO at all, i think he’s a scumbag, but these pedo allegations are just that, allegations. There’s no solid proof like screenshots or voice messages. I’m not trying to say the girls are lying or that OchiDO is not a pedo, but we have to look at this realistically. All we have are people stating their experience with him, so until I see some solid proof I’m gonna remain skeptical, and so should everyone. These could easily be fake as they have no solid evidence behind them. 
---

I don’t really struggle playing survivor, i just get outplayed by killers often. Majority is me being camped though... which I have not been able to counter campers and it’s irritating lmao
---
45 is the max.
---
45 should be max. 
---
4 points per generator, 5 generators = 20 points. 
---
And 25 for escaping with lantern. 
---
Not totally sure how the gen points work. Sometimes I get them from teammates finishing and sometimes I don’t?
---
Yeah gg, as in “git gud you tunnelling POS”
---
r/canrelate
---
it's very strong on Billy, Nurse, Huntress and Spirit. I wouldn't call it a meta for other killers. it's more of like BBQ on them, they still need to get to gens that were tapped/are being worked on, plenty of time to hide when you notice killer comes back to gens. 
---
You only get 3 for destroying lamps though, so really.
---
Lol people think that the F13 lawsuit *increases* the chance of him being in the game? Nah, if anything it was the final nail in the coffin. The rights are going to be in limbo for years 
---
This is not at all related to the topic.
---
yikes
---
It's truly about sending a message
---
Was supposed to be a reply to a different comment 
---
I jump around between a lot of them. My favorites are Michael, Pig, and Leatherface
---
Sometimes I even pull out a random number generator to choose who I play as
---
why is this downvoted? it's not sarcasm. 
---
Drat, had a fun run-in that resulted in a ton of traps in the basement...honestly one of the best times I've had thus far in-game
---
Aaaaand just got an ebony mori huntress. Like this is just getting rly unfun to play. :/ 
---
4x2x3=24*
---
All night long. It's so bad. And on top of camping and just being horrible. 
---
Game crashed 3 times. 8/10 all survivor's DC'd. Killer mains being the nicest and letting me play when everyone else DC'd. Rituals broken.

All fun stuff

Well it was a joke and I was under the impression he was talking about lobby fireworks, not items. 
---
I was watching this at work and it made me laugh loud.  This is pure comedic gold!
---
Im not sure where i said i wanted to farm? It just doesn't teach those guys much when they get camped and tunneled 
---
Gotta admit I like the billy
---
They're probably bringing moris because of the massive amount of SWF happening. I had to quit playing killer because I got four SWF matches in a row with 2-3 legacy prestige outfits and all kinds of toxic BS happening. It just is not fun to play against, period.
---
The event isnt fun JUST for the reasons you explained. 
---
Discord actually kinda makes sense.
---
I had 20 minute queue as survivor and and even longer queue for killer so I’m not sure it’s even that :/ 
---
Flashlights are very easily countered
---
All, gets boring using the same one all the time, while different survivors are or less just different skins every killer is unique. Plus you never know you might find one thats more fun or you might even be better with a different killer. 
---
I think it’s better to let them off after so that they can get escorted to a door though 
---
I always hate to complain about something so soon after it comes out but yes, playing this event is incredibly unfun as a survivor. I really want them to go back to the BBQ style event where doing generators gave you progress so we could just play the game normally. All this event does is encourage people to take a lantern and go hide in a corner hoping their team does at least two generators before they die so they can find hatch. Doesn't help that you get essentially no extra bloodpoints which, to me, was always the fun part of the event. Only getting 5k extra if you escape with a lantern when their idea of balance is 2 or less escape per match is just really counter-intuitive to their balancing ideals. Every single event leaves me wondering if the devs actually play their own game.
---
as a survivor main you are 489% correct. i feel like my teammates manage to play at their absolute worst. 
---
who zaps someone because they're pissed off?
---
I knew the hatch opened at 2 gens done but I thought it spawned at 1 for the last person alive
---
Anyone else having trouble getting into games?
---
I got the top and head. I am done my grind for the event😌 good luck to all ace, huntress and Min mains 
---
Also im a killer main and tunneling is the worst strat and by far the least effective if not the most toxic one. Camping is worse, you dont apply pressure or anything. My complaint is where new guys playing cant learn when this is all lower rank killers do. I could give a shit about bloodpoints. 
---
Anyone tryna play 
---
I thought he was taking you to the hatch because he walked past a few hooks on the way? 
---
I knew it was gonna be bullshit when the outfits cost THREE coins. I cant get teammates who do anything so there’s obviously no way for me to survive. 
---
That's why I've made it my mission to help every survivor leave with 45 points.
---
or just waste it early in the game, only good survivors can actually get away with it.
---
Most of the time its easy to down them again.
---
Swf* are insanely altruistic. None of the people I play with would go back into a match to unhook someone getting camped, too risky, but SWF groups literally go to die, one for all and all for one style
---
Did you bring a red envelope offering?
---
Personally I think this event is much more geared towards normal play style. You get points if you survive long enough for some gens to be done. Win. Grab a lantern and escape that's a bonus. 
---
Killer gets points for every hook. And can get more if you can find and destroy a lantern.
---
I like it. I found the other events. Specific gens and hooks always made the games worse. People would literally concentrate on the lunar gens or the flower harvesting letting people die in the process not really playing the game as usual. And that always sucked. 
---
Wanna play a normal killer game. Get bitched at for not farming. Farm with survivors they screw you over and don't let you get your hooks. Etc etc. 
---
This event allows you to earn coins through regular play with only one real bonus objective that you could ignore. It's a step in the right direction for the events I feel. My personal opinion anyway.
---
It is, yes, but they want to get out of it all the time. Whats the way to get out by yourself? Miss a skillcheck. If they miss a gen skillcheck while lullaby is up, it smashes the gen back 6% of its total progression. So theyve been really slowly progressing the gen while in dream state, and all that progress is smashed. Couple with Overcharge and its 11% total progression. Plus, it lets you know where they are.
---
Its kinda like playing freddy on expert difficulty because you constantly have to put them back in dream state (and logically goes against his power), but it totally works - IF lullaby stays up for a while.
---
Is it the ideal build for him though? Absolutely not, but it does work pretty effectively if that hex stays up. For shits n giggles I like to run dying light remember me lullaby and overcharge on him sometimes
---
Atleast you can GET to the exit gates. My teammates refuse to touch gens. 
---
Normal for me.
---
Honestly I rly dont even care if I leave or not, but like the ebony moris at this point is hella draining. And it’s all billy and nurses. 
---
How did he see you?
---
they all got banned \^\_\^ 
---
Just about getting 3 coins. Then break time lol
---
well its not about getting away with it its about wasting time. Say a chase lasts 45 seconds, up to like a minute and a half if you get looped. Just for them to ds you and run into another potential loop or waste another 20-30 seconds. Think of the generators done during that time if you have good teammates
---
If they've got the black mask or the Wolf one they're a particularly angry kind.

---
no, it helps YOU.
---
Its been like this for a while even before the event. Its hard to get into any survivor game :/
---
lol I guess you've never heard of Fashion by Daylight.
---
Wraith and Hillbilly are my two favorites but I tend to use almost all of them 
---
Swap spirit fury for sloppy butcher or enduring then. Np
---
wow you're new 
---
Not to mention because of the killer/survivor point imbalance the survivor queue times are really long because everyone’s playing surv. Lobby simulator is currently a wasteland lol you wait 15 minutes just to get dodged
---
WHAT!?
---
memes actually give me enjoyment, some generic huntress artwork is boring, to each their own. that's what tag filters are for.
---
So since the lunar event is up and everybody is playing survivor I waited looking for a lobby for 15 minutes and didn't get anything, so I went to play killer and my first game I get 2 legacy SWF team that juked me and I couldn't hit them cause (as you can see by the rank) I mainly play survivor. I'm assuming they ranked down or didn't play the game for a while and got ranked down by the resets but it just annoys me how good survivors get matched up against baby killers like me.
---
Thats how it feels to be a woman everyday.
---
Oh fuck, I forgot about him
---
now they need to stop telling me to prestige every bloodweb. 
---
Let me try turning it off and on again.
---
FEELS GOOD TEAMMATES SNIFFING GLUE IN THE BASEMENT INSTEAD OF UNHOOKING ME. NOT EVEN LIKE THE KILLER IS CAMPING ME THEY LEFT ME A LONG AS TIME AGO TO CHASE THE ONE PERSON WHO TRIED TO UNHOOK ME. BUT THE OTHER TWO ARE PLAYING MUSICAL CHAIRS WITH THE BASEMENT LOCKERS.
---
I don't think I'm smart enough to get this joke
---
You can prevent crows from appearing by: 
---
Emoting constantly
---
Switching between 2 lockers
---
Moving around the map
---
Literally anything. 
---
If crows showed up when you didn’t progress the game at all then they’d work fine, but crows only show up if you’re pretty much afk. I guess that makes you the numb nuts.
---
No the pigs objective is to stop the survivors doing all the gens and escaping, same as the other killers, tunneling one survivor and camping them is just well, camping and bad sport... 
---
my bad managing a few posts
---
Not enough pp for this action
---
that means there's no rule, man, okay? they said console optimization, but it turned out console optimization pass, alright. you can't reference the one time they said something in stream. it's not an officially written. down rule. 
---
it does matter that other side isn't doing their objectives because objectives are the way for killers to locate survivors apart from the fact that they're means for escape. when survivors do jack shit, they don't progress towards escaping. this could go on forever if killer can't find the survivor. because, bare with me, it's not a hide-and-seek game. it's cops and robbers. if it was hide-and-seek, one side(survivors) wouldn't have the advantage of killer making noises, having terror or perks that allow them to know the killer is heading their direction. not a single perk on killer has this mad help like Spine Chill or Premonition. Whispers don't give out direction or actual distance. 
---
So, am I correct that this is still bugged? I mean...it’s nice for me...I got 25 points for escaping a trial with a vessel I never saw
---
I got called a try hard after using a tombstone piece, I'm also a killer that will never tunnel nor camp. Yes if I see an injured survivor who I've hooked I'll down and hook them again, if they get salty that's their issue. It's rare enough to find killers that don't tunnel or camp but the mad survivors will always remain.
---
We’ll have to wait and see
---
I'm rank one and I didn't know it's really situation that you are the last person left with with one get and a key you it's possible to not have situational knowledge.
---
I'm generally playing with the licensed killers. Piggy is probably my main overall right now closely followed by Freddy. I also like playing with Hag
---
I let Myers &amp; Leatherface out of their cage now and then. The rest have been a little neglected over the last few months though they all get a go here and there.
---
That isn’t what the skin actually looks like. It’s just blurry for a second before it becomes clearer when you select her. It’s the same way for every character.
---
What particles do you mean
---
I mean it *is* pretty fire music. Something about it just works :D
---
Right? Oh well. As broken as it is, I still enjoy it more than other games right now. 
---
Ok then I’ll use it. 
---
I've met a Clown on green ranks yesterday who played better than rank 1 Clowns I usually play with. 
---
Didnt get points when I repaired gens and when I picked up the lantern when I escaped #Ps4 
---
do you need help? is everything alright?
---
please let me mute the fireworks, dear god.
---
It doesnt take much to get rid of crows and the claudette can hide in the area until she hears the killer.

No I understand. It's a fun trick to do, but if it doesn't work you have wasted extra time in a chase and that loses you the game. So in most cases it is just better to use the killer's higher speed to run them down. The only time I can think of where mindgaming is worth it is if there is multiple windows very close together.
---
Its still the default in Germany for privat customers. Unfortunately its also still default that you are forced to disconnect once a day to change the ip which is really annoying when you tend to play late into the night and it hits then. But i still like the little bit of extra security it gives since you cant be tracked by IP alone.
---
In all reality it is unfair and it’s why the queue times are broken. As a survivor, you just need to power all gens and escape with a vessel for 45 points. As a killer? I hope y’all brought your offerings because you need 12 hooks and 7 destroyed vessels if you want the 45 points. 
---
Seriously BHVR? It’s crazy innit that no one is playing killer right now
---
No I’m fine I just don’t understand I just said that you should use a perk. 
---
Also using david's "no id training" jacket conects all his fingers from his left hand with a bar
---
I've played every day I'm able to since I bought it so my complaints are hollow. Even broken I truly love and enjoy this game
---
Probably because of you didn’t get any kills it means you didn’t abuse the cancer mechanics legion has 
---
Hey don't put adam in there &gt;:c
---
I break totems
---
Had a game with Meg during the event and the first thing i hear is a player disconnecting, so i'm like "Oh well, might as well get as much points as i can, Me and another Meg were working on a generator when i saw The pig through the wood crack (We were on Cold-wind) and i ran, But when she just saw me and stood crouched i knew instantly what was going on, So i ran up to her and crouched and rubbed noses with her. She did her little tiger roar and kept nodding her snout as i booped her nose constantly. I nodded my head as well and continued to get all up in her face, which i could imagine was a somewhat cute sight for the person on the Killers POV. The other Meg and Nea joined in and she decided to let us farm and get out with the vessels. 
---
Communicating with her was ez, When she hooked someone i instantly told her to go destroy a vessel so she would get some points and she instantly knew what needed to be done, at the end of it all she kicked slashed the other two of my teammates out but turned and saw me crouching there and i inched my way towards her and looked up, then she crouched, and what happens next had to be the cutest thing i have ever seen in my life time of playing this game. 
---
The next thing that happened was she started nodding her head, and i did the same, then she started twirling it around and i did the same, it was as if we were playing a little game of monkey see monkey do. And with that i booped her for one last time and left. In the end game chat it turned out she only knew one person but i could tell that most of her contact with me meant that i had to be her favorite. 
---
I got a mesage acusing me of wallhacks on xbox... Doing great so far thanks for asking
---
Because no one is playing killer rn 
---
You are a terrible person not bringing NOED with the wraith who do you think you are.
---
Ever since the new event, the console matchmakings are acting like they have down syndrome, happy that you're able to enjoy it though, or I am getting whooshed
---
Yeah, my bad. I don't even have Ace, so I guess that's that.
---
and I said that I don't need the perk unless it's an extremely rare situation of survivor refusing to progress the game therefore I'm not going to change my build. yet you saying it's a perk to be used in every game while to me it's a wasted perk space cause I don't need Whispers to locate people who actually play the game. those who don't are rare and I better report them cause their intentions are bad. 
---
i am finding it impossible to find a game as a survivor waiting for so long :(
---
Honestly if I’m trying to pip I let killers down me after a couple loops because high rank killers are the biggest fucking babies and will camp you out of spite if you do anything to make them look bad. Lower ranks where people don’t have such a hyper inflated ego are way more fun. 
---
Jake’s race is a mystery. He could be anything lol.
---
There aren’t enough people playing killer.
---
How is Trapper black..?
---
*beep beep* ERROR DETECTED! NO NOED! CANNOT COMPUTE *whrrrr, link clank* ERRORERORRORORORO
---
Just played three games and escaped one with a vessel. At 0 progression still. :(
---
Killer gets 24 points if he gets 12 hooks... 12 hooks. The other 21 points are only achievable if EVERYONE burns an offering and the killer gets all 7. Both sides can get a maximum of 45 points but the killer has to have a godsend of a game while all you need to do as a survivor is power the gens like normal and grab a lantern on your way out. You don’t even need to burn an offering to get 45 points as a survivor, not to mention how bloody annoying it is to hook someone and run around the map trying to get to that one lamp only to have the guy get unhooked right before you can get there. 
---
The event is really survivor sided and it’s the reason why survivor queue times are so long right now.
---
Play Civ V /s
---
I usually listen to music in between killer games to detox/wind down from a match. Doesn't work as well on survivor with the shorter queues but it helps still. you just need something to distract you from how the last match went.
---
Depends. For example, some people say Hag is low tier while others think she’s top tier. Imo, Bricky’s Tier list is pretty damn accurate and is really close to what mine is. 
---
I'm a 60/40 killer/surv player but I see no reason to play killer in this event.
---
Where is that tier list?
---
I'd tell you to shut up but you don't even have flair. Lol who dis? 
---
Don't you know it's toxic to down survivors!! Reported... 
---
You owe me a lot more than one...
---
[here’s his tier list ](https://youtu.be/UD3eQuQLrqc) 
---
It doesn’t include legion, but imagine legion is right above Freddy. 
---
He could have not played since rank reset or in awhile
---
Mods, delete this garbage please
---
no need to get personal, fam, that's rude. I slightly insulted your game knowledge and questioned your expertise judging by your comment and you immediately jumped on my personal life without knowing anything about me in a very patronising way. 
---
and if you say something is an easy win just because you had this one time afk, do consider not voicing your opinion cause you really don't know since you have the magical job you so proud of as if it's a score in life to have one lol. I do be thinking not being forced to work or do anything you don't like is a good place in life(and unfortunately I'm not there yet but it seems you know my life and preferences better than I do). 
---
This sort of reminds me of that We Happy Few game...but in a sad clown kind of way
---
They look like some sort of joggers 
---
I do D: I was just confused too 
---
Our fun should be put in priority above theirs, since we sat in queue time no one else can see.

No, it didn’t, that’s a good outlook on it anyways. It’s over and done with haha.

---
Freddy
---
Spirit and billy can be switched with each other depending on who makes the list so just imagine they are tied and legion is debatable as despite his lack of 4K potential, it’s nearly impossible not to 2k which means they are very consistent. At high levels of play they are likely a few ranks below where I placed them.
---
As for bubba being over trapper, it could just be my bias showing but trappers setup time and the amount that he relies on survivors to fuck up makes me think of him as inferior to bubba. 
---
We are just one step away from the half nude outfit. 
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about your disgusting sense in Fashion.
---
Precisely. Amateur hour.

Yes , it means youre a fucking degenerate who cant find a girlfriend so you sit on pornhub fapping until your pencil dick is wore to the raw vein.
---
Dont know anything about your life, don care, gotta get back to mine! Amazing
---
Someone (probably David) nutted in Dwight’s bum
---
P.s. didnt read most of that. 
---
It’s not because of rank, it’s because too many people are playing survivor. 
---
Trust me, the last thing I want is to end up going sicko mode with nurse on some survivors that are clearly r20’s. That’s gotta be horrible for them and it ain’t gonna be the most fun thing for me.
---
Are you rooting for survivors or killers?
---
Thats my point exactly. Everyone's going to realize this, and throughout the course of the event its going to end up nobody is playing killer because theres no point, which will lead to excessively long queue times for the survivor side.
---
They need to up the amount of points to at least 4 per hook and 5 per vessel destroy. That way at their perfectly balanced 2 dead 2 live you get at least 24 points for 3 hooks each - which is where it is for a perfect 4k 3 hooks each right now.
---
The notification look like gems exploding kind of. Although some one else did just inform me you can get rid of the crows by demoting. Did not know that. 
---
Wondering the same exact thing...
---
Interesting. For real. Good to know. I will keep that in mind when I play killer. 
---
I think I get more DC on console than I do on PC. If things dont work out in their favor its DC time. I think a slight change of mechanics might be needed but who knows it's only day one 
---
aww, couldn't "go back to your life" without informing me, that's actually sweet, thanks. 
---
Thank you. I was trying to figure out why I was getting 45 points without a lantern. 
---
Sweet. Didnt know that, thanks
---
Crotch joggers 
---
Early days. Keep at it and watch some decent streamers for tips 
---
I just saw one while playing. They’re up on hooks and you just go over and pick them up.
---
Not sure if they appear only at certain times or if certain events materialize.
---
That name tho....
---
awwwwww, so cute. had the time in your busy schedule to inform me about this too, you're to nice.
---
Iconic
---
The ~~tickets~~ envelopes will spawn more Lunar Vessels on the map. The vessels (aka Lamps) can be picked up as Survivor (which will cause a bunch of particle effects to flutter around you) or "destroyed" as Killer (pressing spacebar on a lamp when a Survivor is hooked will make you do the attack animation.) Picking up or destroying a lamp will award Bloodpoints as well as give points for getting the gold coins to unlock cosmetics.
---
For Killers it's a done deal. After you destroy a lamp it can't be picked up by the Survivors anymore. Its destruction will award Bloodpoints and Event Points at the end of the trial.
---
For Survivors holding onto the vessel throughout the match will gradually provide "carrier" Bloodpoints which are seemingly infinite. They will be gained periodically and will boost your post game Bloodpoints. In addition escaping with the vessel will grant a large Bloodpoint boost as well as points for your golden coins.
---
Note that carrying a vessel will not award event points and neither will hooking Survivors who are sparkling. Hooks in general award points as do gens but you have to either destroy or escape with a vessel to gain extra points.
---
You can still pick up the vessels and still destroy them without burning a Red Envelope but to my knowledge you won't get Bloodpoints for it. You won't get Bloodpoints for hooking vessel carriers or destroying vessels if you don't have an Envelope. I don't know for Survivor.
---
ye, maybe an extending time ban from public Match making?
---
like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1hour etc.?
---
Yup and encourages working together as a team!
---
Nah just dont care. Not a busy schedule fam. Only 70 hours a week. Not bad at all actually. And I am not working right now. Obviously 
---
Oh really? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? That's INSANE. What the hell.
---
Amazing 
---
Clown's knife hitbox is large because it's a large knife, and it feels bigger because his power slows you which makes it harder to judge range.
---
Pig's knife however is shorter and it's often due to lag compensation if you get hit.
---
They can't magically make more players. You wait a long time because they are trying to find killers with a decent connection. If they just gave you any killer waiting, you'll realize the lag we occasionally get is minimal compared to that. 
---
I run Plunderers really often and from what I've seen it's pretty crazy now. Ive been finding pink keys nearly every game. I used to just run it so I'd have an easier chance at grabbing a med kit to heal, and occasionally something nice to escape with, but now it just feels really good.
---

---
Lemme see that dwussy 
---
They look like lanterns hung up on hooks. Just go up to it and you’ll be prompted to take it with you. 
---
Anyways I'm really out now. Word of advice. Dont ever take anything some one over the internet says personally. Seriously, you know who you ate and that is all that matters. Trolling is a real thing. And th seconed you take it to heart, you let them win. You are beautiful in your own way. Have a good night 
---
A man of culture i see
---
tbh if i found people spamming clicks flashlight on me, i'd tunnel that guy and at the end of the match i said "i can be more asshole than you :)"
---
lol, dude

This is causing the uncanny valley effect in me to an unsettling degree 
---
how so?
---
My mistake
---
r/wooosh
---
I'm getting Feng, and the Huntress mask.
---
That's it. After that I will just be running around like a bastard, trying to give killers and survivors more points. 
---
What is even happening here?! 
---
Actually laughed aloud.
---
P O S E 
---
They really need to add a soft time limit. Tired of games being held hostage and games that just run on forever in general. 25 mins should be plenty of time
---
put that away
---
Found this on the discord tried to look for you couldn't find you
---
Legion is mid tier
---
Oh, yeah. My bad.
---
Nice! Very accurate! The detail is amazing !
---
Happening to me on Xbox One as well 
---
For a whopping 12-16 points yah, but when you take into account the amount of dc’s I get when someone goes down and decides screw it, the hook suicides to deny what little points I get from a vessel, people refusing to save their teammates bc fuck em lmao and in turn preventing me from getting a bunch of hook points, this shit is AIDS. 
---
People get like one event offering per blood web too so on killer if I make like 60k I can get an offering each match but the survivors take forever to level especially if it’s all you play so I’ll be damned if I see more than 2 red envelopes per match.
---
When you take into account everything that makes this event a massive clusterfuck it’s perfectly reasonable yet stupid that I average like 20 or under points a game, and screw me if I run into the illusive dickbag Claudette that wants to hide for 30 minutes because 2 people dc’d and there are 4 gens left. 
---
This event is stupid hectic and it’s been out for under 10 hours. Here I was thinking that killers disconnecting to deny points would be a major issue but goddamn people just decide they don’t wanna play anymore if they go down now. To top it all off you barely get any BP for the actual offering if you’re a killer.
---
I believe it is a side effect of them allowing players to interrupt being healed without needing to sprint anymore.  If they bump the joystick at all, it'll interrupt the action but it doesn't even happen immediately either.  I think people still aren't aware/used to this change, combo'd with lag sometimes interrupting actions like that and it can potentially create frustrating situations. 
---

I’ve had this name since I was a kid...
---
And I’m in the low ranks right now because I don’t play often
---
Mines always 10-14 min wait and I'm rank 5 😭😭😭
---
Honestly I learned way late that standing on the hatch blocked the jump. I always just thought that was the best grab spot.
---
Not saying this guy didn't (he totally did) but its a plausible scenario.
---
I honestly believe they’ll somehow help by doubling points the last week or something similar. BHVR have always listened to the community feedback. 
---
We hadn't even done a generator when the pig began face camping lol. Literally no reason for it. Someone got hooked,  and killed themselves, which I instantly knew the killer was face camping... Even when we got someone off the hook, she would tunnel them to death. Every event just brings out toxic killers who love to ruin the game for everyone else. 
---
That’s not the point. It’s not a bannable offense. It’s extremely douchey to do, but honestly, being banned for uninteractive gameplay is not the route to take.
---
The route that needs to be taken is the fixing of hatch spawns
---
Oh my god!

You know... Bravo.

Survivors freeze in place in direct eye contact with the killer for 3/4/5 seconds because of how fucking adorable they are.
---
This perk is unique to The DBD Community until level 2, for how many times they have celebrated Oochido’s bans.
---
Oh no, Killer mains got to actually grind some shit now, except to get everything for free. That shit is INDEED terrible.   
---
\*Keep in mind that the Killer gets 20+k Points for his MAIN objective, while a survivor get's 8k for doing his.   
---
I'm just having too much fun, reading that. Don't feel offended. 
---
Happened to me today too! 
---
This. It isn’t a bug. It happens on pc too. You can’t touch anything if someone is healing you or it breaks the heal immediately.
---
A teabagger is someone who teabags. By quickly and repeatedly crouching, as if to say “this is me dipping my nuts in your mouth”. A sign of disrespect and dominance. Utilized by survivors while they’re doing well because they have the delusional outlook that their objective is difficult to attain.
---
A camper is a killer who sits by the hook, refusing to let any other survivors make a safe attempt at rescuing the hooked survivor, who is often camped for teabagging in the first place. 
---

Yep. It's pretty shit. What's funny, too, is that I figured I'd play killer anyway, because that's the role I prefer--but every round is full of assholes that are exhausting to play against so I can't be assed. Just going to play Kingdom Hearts 3.
---
Survivors are the main demographic, you don't want them to feel like they don't have hope of winning just because their team was outplayed, it would alienate too many customers
---
Yah that guy is big trippin. Leave it to BHVR to screw up someone’s queue time with each event.
---
Other way around, not enough killers so you get placed with someone really far away because no one else is available
---
Except you’re wrong. The Kate cannot *move,* let alone enter the hatch, even if she wanted to. It’s not blocking the hatch, it’s holding the game hostage which is 100% bannable. Watch the whole video.
---
The order in which killers are listed in the tier is not representative of ranking in the tier, just how I made the list.
---
S - Nurse
---
A - HillBilly, Hag, Spirit, (Huntress arguably high B tier - low A tier)
---
B - Myers, (Clown and Pig arguably in a low B tier or C tier)
---
C - Doctor, Wraith, Freddy, Legion
---
D - Trapper, Leatherface
---
You just don't want to think. If Scott said they're in front of you, so be it, because it's Scott, and he's a killer main and he has a Twitch and Youtube channels...
---
Have a good day...
---
This makes no sense, did they catch the bug before the released it or something?
---
You sir are fucking hilarious!
---
typical Zoey pants Meg
---
They are literally blocking the survivor in a corner so they can't leave the game at all. It was never about not letting the survivor go, the Wraith obviously had the intention to make the survivor dc.
---
There are two categories of Ace head cosmetics. The ones that have sunglasses, and the ones that are worth less than the mud I scrape off of my boots after a long, rainy hike. 
---
If you aren't using an Ace cosmetic that has sunglasses, you might as well be playing as Dwight.
---
Damn, they really messed up the event
---
Yep prettymuch
---
Ive never laughed harder at an lol in my fucking life.
---
Nobody wants to vs a legion.
---
The event fucking sucks. Every lobby some getting in is red bar. 300 ping lobbies is not fun.
---
...you can literally do that if you spawn far away enough and the killer finds someone else earlier.
---
Afk counter doesnt kick in this game just keep spawning crows - update i went for a 4k run and hes still there afk and occasionally moving lol
---
Apparently its a exploit you can now do on this map?? 
---
I can never not fill a lobby as killer on PS4 but as survivor currently waiting between 5 to 20 mins for a match. Then an asshole D/Cs right. FML
---
I don't see how the event promotes toxic playstyle. Nobody was tbagging or clicking when I was playing. DS sure, but no toxicity there.
---
&gt; plus a vessel escape
---
You think that's a given? Or 5 gens done is a given?
---
first match &amp; are all the killers. sure you ain't playing it longer just to justify your say?
---
There’s “toxic build” and “toxic behavior” I’m referring to “toxic build.”
---
Another good thing about the event is incentive for the killer to leave the hook and destroy vessels. The devs did very well at making sure the event improved gameplay. In fact, this process of additional points through the vessels should be a normal mechanic in every game. It only improves the experience for both survivors and killers.   
---
Ive escaped 4 or 5 times now. But ya ppl.be selfish and theres only one red dealy bobber per blood web.
---
Normal for me - ps4 pro
---
Why is it a toxic build? I'd say it's more of a crutch build. Builds aren't toxic, it's the person's behavior that's toxic. 
---
I’ve been hearing about it since the event came out whether it was from friends or reddit. Was proven true by my first match lmao 
---
Also you don’t even have to touch a lamp to get the 45 points. Lol. Been raking in max points as survivor simply because a teammate left with a lamp before I made my exit. 
---
They definitely need to up the killer points. Personally I feel like destroying a lamp should be a decent amount(maybe 10-15) since you have to rush to one and hope someone hasn’t picked it up or the time runs out. I’ve not managed to destroy more than one in a game. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/allyjy/redesign_for_bubbas_meg_face/ Got you fam ;)
---
It’s a interchangeable term nowadays. Idk it’s fucked but that’s how it is
---
Pig is my most played, then Nurse, then like 5-6 others. For the killers I don't like to play I do dailies.
---
Literally same, the first guy got camped and just gave up, sadly I was the second one to be found 
---
Nailed it
---
Haha glad to hear 
---
Sorry, for a moment I thought it was Freddy. I can see now I was wrong. Excellent work.
---
Ya as a survivor you must be aware of gen placement. You didn't camp in my eyes.
---
Leader no longer affects generators though. I would use bond or empathy to see where other people are so that you can best use your prove thyself. 
---
I barely watch streamers or YouTube on DbD at all.
---
How he explains it does work 99% of the time for me, so that works for me.
---
If you're trying to say that I'm just using his method because I must be a drone following his "indisputable words" then it's just making you look like a goof because the method works. 
---
I really like the incentive for killers to leave hooks to destroy lanterns in this one. There is a very good time based incentive to not camp since lanterns can only be destroyed when someone is on a hook. 
---
It’ll label it by itself sometimes. That’s probably why it happened.
---
I think they *did a pretty good job so far* with that skin.
---
I started on console then went to PC and never got legacy but I racked up 1000 hours in a year. They need a skin that’s worth getting. Imagine a light blue legacy. That’s kickass. It should be like, 1-2 weeks long, and you have to start from lv1 and work your way up. Old bloodweb too. After the event all characters are restored to their original levels (unless they got to a higher level than previously) and you keep all teachables too.
---
Template?
---
Agreed. I miss how these events used to be done.
---
Oooooo that's good to know! I'm glad we are now able to stop someone healing us (for times like when you see a tier 1 Mikey boy coming but they don't) but damn o wish it wasn't that easy. I feel like it should be a dedicated button or something??
---
Thank you for answering, hopefully I won't get as frustrated now hahaha :)
---
Thank you for reading
---
I respect your opinion, but
---
I just really really want to stare into Ace's deep chocolate brown eyes and reconsider my life decisions
---
You also drew Freddy I see, well done!
---
Can confirm this. Have tested it multiple times in Kill Your Friends to see what the cause was or if it was a bug that could be recreated and any movement on either survivor's part will cancel the action.
---
Also if everyone bought a bbq invt and 1 person got escape cake (back then it was for all surv) you could get 100k BP for only doing cocktails because only 1 person needed to finish a gen for eveyone else to get 4.5k BP 
---
Shuts down all your other perks and all bloodpoints you earn while having it equipped are pissed away on fog reagents
---
Giving me black ops PTSD
---
Should have sunglasses
---
Exactly why those events were amazing and this event sucks
---
If you are moving in a searching manner from left to right in a straight line, the whispers would light up as your front faces the asylum, in the cone in front of you.
---
I got two in a game, but thats it. Ive never even seen a third in a game in time to kill it - its hard enough to find the freaking things, let alone you only have a chance if they havent picked it up yet.
---
is that actually a skin for the pig?
---
No you haven’t showed me Barbecue!!!! Its still not in the shrine...
---
Yep. Honestly if you want to recreate a meme like this just crop off the wording hahaha
---
I mean he is 19 years old.  Expect a lot of dumb mistakes to be made at that age.   It's different from people in their late 20s or 30s being moronic. 
---
Do you keep the 1k bloodpoints if you lose it later
---
Can you do one of Wraith Grabbing the Claudette next time?
---
"Horror" game
---
Look like sweatpants to me?
---
It was kinda funny because I was running away from the killer, going where all the pallets where supposed to be and was like how did someone throw all of these down already. Then I saw the prompt when I was running through one 😂 so needless to say it was a challenge
---
The combat straps are almost mandatory, really helps your work faster. Would also recommend monitor and abuse as a perk,  Great perk on her with her diminishing radius when you go in to crouch.
---
I also agree and I want another reason to stay up all night lol bbq farming 2018
---
Cause Noed makes him 114%
---
Ahh... the fabled Michael Meggers...
---
Nurses calling, sloppy butcher, claurophobia, pop goes the weasle
---
I think people like that should get banned tbh. I have this happen at least 4 games a day and then get farmed into a Mori.
---
There are like a bajillion lamps around...
---
what? why did you take it so personal, had literally no intention. I didn't call you or your knowledge anything, I just said it's weird. now it's even weirder. you had 1.6k hours and never been in a situation to have 2 gens and 2 people on the map and never questioned why the hatch isn't there to take the time of 3-4 seconds to Google it. and also, as of again, said that bhvr should be changing loading screen tips to be actually helpful. but damn you're a pussy lol. you done here? are you sure? no itch to reply on my message? cause now I made it personal in case you are unable to tell these things. 
---
Just ignore them. For a new killer, basically ignore everything that isn’t a generator. Try to keep 3 generators (bonus points if you have a Hex in the mix) that are close together as close to 0% as possible. Attack survivors that go for them. If you can win the chase in a timely manner, do it. Don’t spend more than a minute or so chasing one guy you aren’t gonna beat.
---
Ignore toxic survivors, chests, hook sabos, flashlights, firecrackers, anything that isn’t your 3 gens.
---
Before long, you’ll get to the point where you realize how little that shit matters and can try out some different strats. 
---
Ohhh, okay. That makes more sense. I was gonna say like, whaaaat. How. It's really hard to get points as killer right now.
---
Everytime i pick someone up the firecrackers make me drop them, I've played for a while I'm not that new it just seems like this perk survivors get with nothing offered to killers which is frustrating when the game is already so survivor leaning. 
---
It's how they sell less attractive/trashy looking porn actresses...at least that's why I search for fake incest porn.
---
I know same!!! It’s not like it’s going to be hard to put it back on 😒😒😒 haha 
---
idk i escaped with a lantern and didn't seem to get any points
---
I know, I think I only got maybe 10 points? Can't remember exactly. I'm barely getting more than that as survior. I'm fairly good at this game, and have yet to escape tonight. Just a constant string of face campers. 
---
That’s fine. That means that survivor doesn’t have it anymore. Consider it a win, It’s like burning a DStrike.
---
And the game is *not* survivor leaning. A “good” match is 2 Kills and 2 escapes.
---
Somebody make Puppers play this!
---
That could be true but they want your lamp
---
You would need 180 vessels NOT counting gens for points. 
---
Ok so i afked and did a 5k run, came back had a shower. remembered id left the game and apparently there no afk kicking... hes still there twitching and moving around outside the map lol
---
They can console ban him which would require a new ps4
---
At least not everyone is suiciding
---
Some cosmetic gestures or just straight up double bloodpoints would be nice.
---
Scummy if you ask me, just play the game
---
That's called Zarya
---
She wasn't a troll tho it does look like it! The Meg is my friend who was trying to take a hit for me, but she is a newbie so didn't know the Michael was stalking her. She had only good intentions in mind!  
---
;/ for me it’s been working, I’ve escaped with like 2 or 3 lanterns so far. Not sure how the points work totally because I don’t know if my teammates have escaped with lanterns aswell ;/
---
Youuu son of a bitch!
---
Meh, I can't really be mad when I have gotten hours of amusement from her blundering and besides, she will know better next time.
---
These are fucking evil
---
Dwight is a false prophet, I'm gonna need you to take that back before the entity hears what you said
---
Okay so fun fact, the maximum amount of points for both sides is 45 points. If the killer gets a perfect 4k where they hook each survivor three times, everyone brings an offering, and they destroy every single vessel, they will get 45 points. If the survivors get all 4 gens, and a survivor escapes with a lunar vessel, that survivor gets 45 points. So I see where the points are coming from, but the second scenario is way more likely than the first, and you don't even need everybody to escape, but for max points on killer you need the 4k. So yeah, probably makes more sense to play survivor if you're grinding, except for the queue times.
---
Why are you jelly?
---
He means that the points for killer are horribad compared to survivor which is absolutely true.
---
Also, let me be very clear on this point... I have no problem with the amount of points survivors can get. It is a fair amount. But the fact that even if your team epically fails and you have to escape through the hatch with that vessel, there is absolutely no reason you should generate more points than is possible for the killer... for this action. 
---
I dont want to see survivor point generation lowered, just killer point generation raised... or theres literally no point to play killer at all during the event.
---
Ace and his shiny pants are everything. 
---
I love pencil mustache Ace though :P
---
live your dreams
---
But their prestige clothing is shiny
---
Mainly Huntress and rarely Hillbilly/Myers. Also do others if I have Daily Ritual.
---
I think it's an Azarov map, one with a house in it with broken floors, one that leads up towards a chest and a drop off. I forget the name.
---
I put a trap outside the window, as shown, and it was hidden under the dirt. Ok.
---
The trap above and to the right is HIDDEN UNDER THE FLOORBOARDS AT THE TOP OF THE BASEMENT STAIRS. Easiest 2 traps I've ever gotten on people, holy Christ.
---
I'll settle for any Survivor with a kilt.
---
I'm watching the Mario 3 AVGN episode as I type this so this is extra funny
---
Is this a subtle goodfellas reference? 
---
#That’s how killer works
---
Thanks !!
---
iT rEwArDs BaD gAmEpLaY (even though you essentially played the rest of the game without perks to have an endgame build)
---
Only your lantern matters, so if you escape through exit with one, you get 45 points.
---
Look away when they throw it
---
That's how mafia works!
---
Proof: happened to me, and saw it on a stream! 
---
Joe &gt; prestige 
---
What have you fucking brought upon these cursed lands
---
You need to understand one thing - it is not BHVR's intention to give all 9 pieces for free to a lot of players. They want you to buy cosmetics.
---
Also, is it confirmed that 25 bonus for escaping with lantern is cumulative? 2 survivors escape with lanterns equals 50 bonus?
---
That is how the game works in general, like anytime a new chapter comes out everyone is playing the killer, so survivor queues are good.
---
Heaven forbid the killer be able to stop the survivors from completing an objective in a multiplayer game, oh god, the horror.
---
Motherfucker has whispers, I just know it.
---
Im only using plunderers instinct and the worst ive gotten is a yellow medkit ONCE.
---
Can’t see shit my friend
---
Someone called me a “mong” and they got suspended they are really strict 
---
Not sure why everyone is freaking out, saying this grind is absurd and too long. I'm literally 100/900 in about 2-3 hours of playing. Easily completable within the duration of the event. This sub is something else. 
---
Where have you been?  I've Kobe'd about 20 times and it has never been respected.
---
Can’t report for teammates that just died right away and dedicated servers won’t fix bad games from happening you just sound petty 
---
MacMillian Estate or something thing similar is that house. 
---
Well from Halo blindness Wonder at least mixing it up so it's not just "do gens". They're starting to get unique at least.
---
Thing is, people know that teabagging annoys the killers, especially if they're not having a good game. Whether you believe people should or shouldn't get upset is irrelevant to the reality that it often time does.
---
If your goal is to make someone angry, and they get angry, and then do something you don't like, you only have yourself to blame.
---
This is also sandbagging.
---
Oh.... ;/
---
Try zooming in?
---
maybe you stick out more than the rest,
---
anyway lobby dodging will be a bannable offence when dedicated servers come out, detected by the system similar to the dc's
---
bitch, I"M SHINEY!!!!!
---
Yeah I understand they want people to buy shit, they could’ve made it scaled down or made the event last longer. And I wasn’t sure if it was confirmed or not so I put in () my thoughts. I was hoping it’d be that way for the lanterns but it wasn’t which made it even worse....
---
Are you a p3 Claudette?
---
Makes me remember my old battlefield 4 moments when I was in a tank, pointing at infantry, a lonely medic starting moving his head saying "no" as mercy and I just nodded with the tank and went with my havoc away
---
what do we want?
---
A shirtless myers 
---
when do we want it 
---
NOW
---
The bug is not the more serious issue, unfortunately.  The lobbies are broken for survivor because they haven't balanced the event well.  Nobody wants to play killer because there's no high reward option.  Lobbies are all survivor sided: takes me 5-10 minutes to get a survivor game and 10 seconds to get a killer game.  Bugs are bugs... But failing to make adjustments to the event balance?  People are going to stop playing until the event is over.
---
this should have been fixed by now, restart the app and try again 
---
Yeah same, on PS4 myself &amp; Its happened all the time when I try to heal. It heals for like 4 seconds &amp; than stops.... ;/
---
And you're why they locked hallowed blight skins behind a paywall.
---
Thanks
---
Firecrackers aren't really that bad and you can't really say the game is survivor leaning anymore considering a lot of changes have made killers better, this is excluding SWF as that is always going to be strong. 
---
If your not new then just bait the crackers, pretend your going to pick someone up then hit the person using the cracker it usually scares them off. Also as soon as you pick someone up look into the sky so if they are brave and come back to use them they won't work. Remember a kinda balancing thing about crackers is they can blind survivors too so if someone uses them when they are all bunched up good chance another survivor will be blinded.
---
I mean, dbd isn't f2p ive spent a good chunk of money already. 
---
To a extent, twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern, and considering how consistent it has been with how almost every patch has introduced some new extremely present major bug. Sound bugs making many killers unplayable, scratch marks bugging out, chase music starting for everyone and so on. Its hard not to get frustrated or be pessimistic when more and more times we have to ask what the Patch broke, instead of what its actual content is.
---
if you have the time to grind then do it. they want people to get half sets and then buy the remaining. i grineded hard today and got 1000 pts so im almost 25% done. i played about 6-8 hours.
---
&gt; This game is a buggy mess &amp; they expect people to pay for shit?
---
How often do you see killers or survivors wearing cosmetics that can be bought with auric cells only? There's your answer. Yes, people buy a lot of cosmetics in DbD.
---
&gt;  Lmao, what happened to buying a game and it actually working and than getting the complete package.
---
You want DbD with 3 killers and 4 survivors back? That was a complete package as far as I'm concerned.
---
Hang in there buddy, you'll catch on.
---
This event in the worst one DE has ever designed and promotes a selfish playstyle on the survivors part.
---
It doesn't help that things are even worse for killers because they gain so incredibly few points per match.
---
No lol. I’m a meg and I wear the puffy black jacket with the red long sleeves. I feel I look average? 
---
Was it really? Games back in 07 had the same graphics &amp; more content. Hell they probably even had dedicated servers
---
I regularly crash my game by switching between the store tabs lmao
---
It was a fun event not sure why they have to try and change things
---
Well, I remember someone suggested that it'd be around 40 hours to get 9 coins. Looks like they were about right.
---
Now let's see how many players can get these hours in 2 weeks.
---
The fuck are you on about here
---
That’s the thing though I don’t even bring items in the game 90% of the time. Mainly cause I’m a hoarder who wants to take things from the chest to add to my treasure pile 
---
Welcome to Wendy's 
---
Yeah ONCE, as opposed to three times in a normal game.
---
For some reason the image of Afro-Clown fighting Afro-Samurai popped into my head and... actually I don’t have anything to add to that.
---
That's at Sonys discretion. Getting a new system and being smarter about hiding who you are outweighs losing YouTube ad revenue.
---
Be more wary of toolboxes
---
Body blocking should be kinda banned as I’ve been body blocked in a corner by a killer who afks or dies that go down as something else? either way it’s cheap and annoying
---
Lol same.  I got dodged 12 times straight once solo queue.  Lot of soft killers out there that will dodge for the weakest reasons.  I don't care if I see everyone load in simultaneously with 3 flashlights I will play that shit.  
---
May as well check our killer privellages and just put the controller down until they escape 
---
Maybe a killer is looking for a friend to farm with for the event, that wouldn’t surprise me.
---
Ok, go back to 2007 then. 
---
You have an option to not buy "unfinished" and buggy games. And, of course, you don't have to play those games and whine about lack of free cosmetics.
---
Why make it a video? Could have just been a text post. 
---
pebble timr
---
I would love to hear an official response to this question.  I'm guessing the answer is $$$.  More people wanted to have a swf mode and even though it breaks the game balance it makes the devs more money.  Sounds somewhat likely.
---
Howdy, I have some tips for 360-ing. This’ll be for console to help OP primarily. Start with increasing camera sensitivity to 100%. Hold the sprint button, and either spin the left stick left or right and the right stick the opposite way until you’ve completed a 360. Try and keep your turn as tight as possible.
---
Well as a killer I smashed 4 lanterns and got a 4k, with 11 unique hooks. I got 34 points. I, as a survivor, escaped with 1 lantern and got 45 points. So a LOT of people are playing survivor to farm the event. That tilted the time
---
Once I was Wraith and I did block a survivor like that, he friended me and said that he couldn't even jump into it, so I let him go to try to do some mindgames or repairing, whatever he wanted to risk. From that time that I find myself in that situation that I leave a little space to the survivor so it can jump or go away. 
---
It's been live for a while. This is why Survivor queues take ages and Killers are generally always getting all 4 Survivors joining at once.
---
Basically, the game groups Survivors up before putting them in a lobby.
---
Are there only 3 outfits that you can buy with the golden coins?  AND you have to pay for them with real cash???  Why the heck would I want to grind just to have the ability to pay real cash for something?  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  Please tell me I have this all wrong.  Back to DBD after a two year hiatus.
---
I mean, I think /u/DetectiveCookeh made it canon
---
Ha
---
hex: devour meg
---
Not gonna lie I would. Meg is thicc.
---
Lol camping gens as if that is even a thing.  Sounds like a potato that 3 genned themselves hard
---
Don't be so entitled, you're getting a fair chance at 1-2 cosmetics for free. Is missing that one extra cosmetic drastically going to affect your gameplay?
---
I got one coin in just a few matches.
---
I think it's fair considering it lasts quite a while.
---
Even if you don't play much you can easily get 1 coin a day.
---
Jesus christ hag. For once can you have some self control 
---
i will im a no life nerd :)
---
No, but I think it’s poorly executed
---
Challenge accepted
---
Which you could do before.
---
When Survivors team up on gens, they all recieve a 10% reduction in repair speed. Prove Thyself simply removes this.
---
Which is why Killers should run Discordance.
---
Pebble time
---
Keep an eye out for the big glowing things as you're wandering around the map. It might help to kind of unfocus your eyes and see if you can find any warm light sources in your peripheral vision.
---
Blood Lodge
---
Why?  There's literally no point.  You're just wasting time.  You will get many more pips and points by playing more games in that time than standing there doing nothing.
---
It does nothing but waste time and makes you a dick.
---
Lol, oh how I've missed this sub
---
Yesterday I sent someone GG to be nice, and I got cursed out. So take that how you will lol.
---
&gt; don’t hold these companies accountable
---
Do you hold them accountable by still playing their game? Or maybe even buying DLC/cosmetics?
---
Did you check the killer’s addons? I’m pretty sure Amanda has one that lets her see auras while in a certain range and crouched, and bbq probably screwed you a few times as well.
---
those damn vampire chicken always making me look bad 
---
At least on PC you can switch to another app or just mute the game...
---
True I should be playing on PC 
---
I once got called out for 'camping' my totems. I was playing leatherface with thrill of the hunt so I would get notified every time someone touched a totem and I just went after them lol.
---
Hire this man
---
Oofing*
---
:D 
---
Satan be with you, Lizzy
---
Figured they had. Since 2.5.1 I'm not trying any exploits 
---
im on the verge of suicide over these images do not mock me fool
---
This goes double when the killer runs ruin. Players just run sneak around looking for hex but sprint towards hook the second someone gets saved. 
---
Honestly if I had to put up with what my swf group puts killers thru I’d prob face camp to. But then again even that doesn’t do much. Coordination will always beat out face camping
---
bad for them face camp give very low point in this event.
---
Only losers eat ramen from a cup (jk)
---
most of us get tired of the loops while i do think they are necessary its rather annoying and unfun i would say  most killers that face camp are mad/salty at something you or your fellow survivors did
---
Yes, it does. No, it wasn't a nerf, just a bug fix.
---
I wouldn’t count on that.
---
I got the game in September and it's great to have flexible builds after a little bit of the grind. I played a lot during the 2x events and in combo with the shrines I have a lot of perks and can equip whatever I want on my pimped David.
---
careful guys the survivor will complain if you face camp him for looping all game this is a 2 way street
---
Because it’s the highest rank in the game? You should get a cosmetic or something. Lmao 
---
what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land?
---
Doesn't the number of needed points for a coin increase?
---
Joey is black, so he's the most powerful member of the legion 
---
How is that scummy? Who is it hurting? Making an event this grindy to lure players into paying for cosmetic microtransactions is a bit scummy, but this definitely isn't.
---
*Some* people camp because they're unable to properly play the game, were probably peeved by a survivor, or just get enjoyment from camping salt.
---
Camping isn't rewarding and survivors can play around it by just doing gens and bailing. Its pointless but you can't stop anyone from doing it regardless.
---
Just find me in a lobby. I'm so bad the past couple of days/in general that I probably won't even manage to hook you, I've just been letting a lot of survivors get their vessels and go after a good fun chase since I don't get too much out of it anyway and nor do I care for the cosmetics too much.
---
Queue times have been horrible on PS4 for me since the Winter Solstice ended.
---
And loves CRAFT BEER!!!!!
---
You have a bonus of instant lobbies

I wouldn't go assuming that. Seems like another one of those "I got rank 1 you guys, but fuck this game til next DLC lol" posts. But that's just me I guess (probably not). There used to be an abundance of these. Nobody cares when anyone gets rank 1 because theres just no point to it, annoyingly enough. I think an achievement suffices, personally. Prestiges are all grinded through points along the way, they could maybe pump out some t-shirt for survivors or weapon for some killers but I just think it'd be overshadowed by the rest of their cosmetics, y'know? They could do a seasonal amount of shards but it would be a bit dumb due to resets functioning how they do now. Rank one just doesn't feel like anything that justifies much solely because of how BHVR goes about handling things half the time. 
---
Its hard to word, and I'm not trying to be a cock by going "lmao" in reply to OP, but expecting anything as a reward for ranks and levels with DbD with as long as the game (and the levels/devotion) have been out just feels silly. I dont even get why the games got a ranking system, it doesnt feel like one of those games even meant to be played competitively
---
Hope im making sense. :&lt; its late
---
Really like how you did her hair, face and hands nice job!
---
If I see this I'm going to facecamp you. Look how he massacred my girl.
---
I had a match where 1 survival didnt leave the map and I dcd the game lol
---
He just looks disappointed. 
---
Hey, it's MY credit card. While you were grinding get event skins, I was working.
---
Also, why be so elite? It's a video game.
---
Hey, you hear about the new patch where it takes 20 minutes to do 2 gens?
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
get out. GET OUT! I SAID GET THE FUCK OUT MOTHER FUCKER
---
Cool.
---
nah first time she found me that I found suspect was way after anyone was hooked, I was crouching behind wall with the teammate, she was hit so I started walking away thinking she'd chase her but killer came right back to me. Last one was after gates were powered, and I wasn't near exits or anything, just behind a random wall.  Add-ons were yellow and green (think it was slow release toxin? didn't have Bear trap on at the time)
---
you get 4 points for each 5 gens being done and 25 points for escape with vessel, so that's a natural 45 points right there
---
blame the community that demands they release new content every 3 months because their ADHD brains can't be happy with the 20 survivors and killers and laundry list of perks already in the game and cries when they don't 
---
Little hard to work on fixing shit while trying to make new shit under a deadline and making sure that new shit also don't break shit adding already to the list of shit that needs to be fixed. They're a company of sub 500 employees and not all of them are working on DBD
---
No one is hoping for anything...I’m not new here. I have the same hours as you. 
---
Bro they had DS and insta heals. Imma bust out the noed if I don’t have good perks from the bloodweb. Especially against obvious SWF. 
---
That's not really a bonus if you're not enthusiastic about playing Killer, though (or Survivor, if the roles are reversed). If you offer an in-game reward for playing the other role, the queues start balancing out.
---
Both sides have to grind a lot. Don‘t forget that survivors need an escape for 25/45 points. 
---
Thanks..........You know the rest
---
Their average rank is 11, so it's not even that bad.
---
Legion extra? There’s no extra legion there’s 4 as aways 
---
I'm just angry that I was pitted against a level 3...
---
you don't get the bonus BP for event actions if you didnt drop the offering (at least that's what I think I observed)
---
What about r18 and 17?
---
I never said you were new or said anything about your hours or time on the game?
---
Its been out for a long time and with talks of potential rewards years ago (if im not mistaken) and still no show of them, hope that a good batch of people had for some form of reward for getting rank one (especially when the old reset rules were in play) just kinda dwindled. So idk what you mean by that. They said things and people expected stuff down the line, if im not mistaken again.
---
Agreed, people rank 18 and 17 shouldn't be facing a rank 11 killer, totally unfair. 
---
I mean that's unfair to be at least it's somewhat better then the level 3...
---
*Duel of fates intensifies*
---
Killers get more BPs on average outside of events, that doesn't help with queue times. How much of a bonus would you consider big enough to play a side you don't want to play?
---
Don’t see the problem here 
---
Got it then? 
---
it was sarcasm. everyone knows haddonfield is a mess.
---
Not everyone has the time to play this game and grind for the event items. If I want to spend my money to get the items that's my decision. If you want to grind it out to not spend anything, that's your choice too. It's great to have choices!
---
This is the worst looking David I've ever seen. He's even wearing Ace's pants.
---
Disappointing.
---
Pancake boy is autistic
---
r3 is 8 ranks "better" than r11, r11 is 7 ranks "better" than r18... pretty close, I think. But you get r17 also.
---
They are like little lanterns. The spawn is rng, from what I can tell. 
---
In case you haven't already searched for it on youtube :) https://youtu.be/nP4RpXqOEFU
---
You effectively get nothing if the killer hits it anyways, it does spawn another lamp yeah but no extra BP my man
---
My record was getting lobby dodged 18 times in a row as a SOLO survivor. It's really bad in red ranks. PS4.
---
I never mentioned a nerf. 
---
They're Claudettes dude, what would you expect? If you want some class (where I'm at) you can go on the official dbd discord to get a nice swf team.
---
This happened to me earlier too. At rank 12, got a rank 2 and a rank 5 playing with their rank 17 friends.
---
Don't forget to post the video on liveleak
---
I'd peg it to the degree of imbalance, honestly - if Survivor queues outnumber Killers 12 to 1, offer a 3x Killer BP bounty. If as many players want to be Killers as want to be Survivors, establish a 4x Survivor BP bounty.
---
Idk why you have so many downvotes, since what you say is actually true. I consider myself a killer main and whenever I camp I actually know that I'm losing, but I do it out of salt because I got outplayed by pallets and DS. 
---
What really pisses me off is when I'm the survivor getting camped and my teammates are just watching me die instead of doing gens. As the killer when this happens I kinda realize why some people actually camp all the time as a strategy.
---
It does reward bad players. It's not "end game"  it's a perk straight up for bad players who know they will not get a single hook during game play they need a participation trophy kill. Just like DS was added for shit survivors who can't loop or run the killer. 
---
Are you seriously that bad or lack that much confidence in your skill that you have to build around the fact the survivors will power all the gens and likely get the gate? 
---
Whats broken? I have only played it one match beacuse of school but whats broken
---
Space has been known for inefficiency, and they have also been known for being unable to take any criticism.  They censor critique, hold explicit biases towards specific participants, and actively promote toxicity in their community.
---
REEEEEEEEEE

I'm honestly not mad about the perks or add ons I'm just mad about the level differences.
---
Just look up
---
CAN'T-WE-JUST-DANCE-AROUND-SEX ?
---
You should remove this like they asked. 
---
god i wish that were me
---
I had a game were some shit head kept going to the corner of the map so i could not get the lamp, i think its awesome how even if the last person is dying on the hook the lamp still goes back to the yellow state before they are even dead.
---
I mean still, 2 rank like 20's. even for a rank 1 thats hard to have on your team.
---
Damn that ochido also looks really detailed 
---
Mmm I guess that's a way to play him but still I would rather end chase quickly. My brother used to bring dying light and black box on Freddy and I also think it's a decent build but I have difficulty using dying light cause I have so few mori's on Freddy and I don't want to tunnel :/
---
Sorry, I’m a fool and forgot to specify that it was a 3 man.  Was saying the third person who died on the hook hadn’t (I’m pretty sure) even been hooked twice previously, so I shouldn’t have had nine hooks let alone ten. 
---
I never demanded the roadmap they showed, when they did I got worried cause I knew it would cause problems.
---
Do you know what dedicated servers are?
---
He had plenty of time to jump. @ 1:20 he puts a cut in the video...something he edited out that was a few secs long that he didnt want us to see. Also I thought it was impossible to block the hatch...besides this dumbass can go finish the last gen and stop thinking he is entitled to the hatch anyway.
---
gee i wonder why.
---
its almost as if you get more event points from being survivor than you do as killer
---
False. You earn 500 BP on a regular basis for holding onto the lamp.
---
How? There are tens of thousands of players in this game; there's not some vast conspiracy to manipulate populations. People play what they want to play - if a huge portion of the community wants to play one side or the other, it makes sense to reward people to choose something they'd favor less.
---
Franklins demise, makes Hillbilly drop his chainsaw, GG
---
Cause I can
---
Do you see they Urban evading as you are being chased? This probably means you are bringing the killer to not repaired gens... 
---
If lantern guys escapes all will get 45 points if everyone is alive before leaving the gate.
---
Man, seriously though, what is it with you guys assuming that everyone who pays for event skins is a kid using their parents' credit card? Like if anything, kids are way more likely to be the ones grinding for them.
---
When everyone know about bonus, it's logical to load into the game, see which side has a bonus, queue for other side to make imbalance even more, and then queue for bigger bonus.
---
Yeah: you killer mains weren't complaining af all at the time of the Halloween event, guess why
---
I personally don't get why we need a progression system. It just makes us spend time leveling characters we don't use once you get 1 with all the perks. and instead of getting offering/addons for leveling you could just get it from finnishimg matches and the better you do the rarer the addons. But thats just my Opinion. DBD is the only game I have 1K hours in that has a progression system.
---
Didn't even notice the downvotes here. Dunno why I would when I'm just spilling out the only reasons that come to mind but oh well it doesnt bug me
---
Survs have to work around it, if you approach that hook and the heartbeat lingers, just hop to work. And the hooked surv needs to pretty much stall time (although they don't have to). Camping won't get you much nowadays but theres only so many reasons why it could be happening.
---
Is this a cult?... Oh sorry, I mean pebble time.
---
I just want to live a quiet life!
---
*someones last hook*
---
*corrupted for 1 second*
---
This 100% man.  75% of the randoms I get paired with at rank 1 pull this shit with that disgusting combo of urban evasion and premonition.  Crawling around map and hiding when killer is chasing someone else across map.  They develop a horrible allergy to gens as well.  You'll run a killer for what should be 3 gens and nothing gets popped lol.  Immersed survivors piss me off more than camping killers.  At least there's counterplay to them I can chase a killer but I can't make teammates be useful lol.
---
SUPREME REEEE POTENTIAL
---
Your incorrect in that assumption.  First we had to go for specific hooks in order to get our nectar.  A lot of killers were running iron grasp to get to them hooks.  We were also getting alot of baby dstrikes when we were trying to go to specific hoooks. Survivors were cominhg into game getting there full vial in under 3 mins then suiciding on hooks to get into another game.  Killers had to finish the game lets call it 15 mins a pop.  Survivors finished off their cosmetics so fast that they jumped into games as killer to get the cosmetics.  This resulted in long wait times for killers on all platforms, so bhvr changed it so you could earn all cosmetics playing just one side.  Thanks for your sweeping statement but back it up with facts.
---
You beat me to the comment
---
Sorry koichi got other plans
---
I absolutely hate the entitled "Me. Me. Me. Me." types who whine about things not being exclusive. Can't think of anyone but themselves and their "bragging rights." A prime example of what's wrong in the gaming community. People should be *happy* that everyone has a chance to get what they want. Their fellow gamers also being able to enjoy the things they themselves like should be a *good* thing. Instead they get jealous that someone else has to pay actual money for something they got for free just by playing.
---
yeah that's where it comes from with me, I use it to say hello to fellow survivors and sort of treat it the same with killers
---
Lhana Rhodes Bratty sis
---
Idk why complain when killers get x3 survivors points eh. Also all previous events has been killer biased anyways
---
Search for '' Canon rock - Jerry C cover by Laura''. I considering making the video longer just to drag the song out cus It's so got damn good, but w/e 
---
First game with this event I see a survivor running so i start to chase them, they run right up the hill to grab a lamp as I'm behind them revving a chain saw... i hooked them, walked up and hit the lamp, they DCed. Yay, what a fun event...
---
I started using it a while back then stopped as I learned almost all totem locations.
---
Put it back on now that they added a lot of sneaky spots for totems, it's a really useful perk.
---
Pretty much every game it's either used for finding ruin or NOED. Effectively countering both those perks with one perk. Even more so if they have more totem perks.
---
I NEED AN ADULT WHAT  DOES THIS MEAN
---
Woah.
---
I did both sides during halloween even before they made it a mutual count. 
---
I made a post on the numbers. 
---
4500 points in total, 45 for a perfect game (7 vessels, 12 hooks) 
---
He is both.
---
He is overpowered because survivors don't have any way to counter him during a chase and at the same time he is weak because without add-ons he needs multiple hits to down a survivor.
---
Literally my 2nd game during the event saw someone through bond who was just chilling in a corner of the map for ages - went over and it was a Claudette who clearly had a vessel. Selfishness has gone through the roof.
---
Much like any killer in the game, if you know how to use them, they are really good.
---
The Legion is probably one of the killers that has the hardest learning curves of all killers Imho.
---
They're so hard to find/see. :( &amp; I have a very poor map memory so by the time I find one, they're non-destroyable again.

Tbf tho this all this subreddit is about, shitty meme that belongs in comedy cemetary or circlejerking around the new cool thing to hate to farm karma, makes me check it less and less because even the "memeless" version doesn't fully work because of  badly tagged posts.
---
I wonder if there's an actual discord where we can discuss stuff about the game with less memes and downvotes just because you like Legion.
---
How so?
---
Yeah, I don't understand the need for the winners to talk shit. It's so immature and pointless. It also makes the game super unenjoyable &amp; makes people continue the cycle.
---
Moth is meth but with an O instead of E  
---
It aint much, but its honest work
---
Actually she can take on up to 4 ppl at once so...
---
Yeah your just gonna piss us off lol. It’s like waving with your left hand in middle eastern countries, Americans won’t give a shit but others take offense, it’s practically cultural within the community. 
---
Around half the games of survivor where we are pwering gens and looking good the killer dcs as they are losing or just facecamps a guy. The community sucks not one side
---
Well yes. Because you cannot take critique. 
---
There is an event going on btw. Event points don’t count towards any category, they are their own kinda category with no cap. 
---
ps4 bans?
---
But when you have 0 stacks 
---
WH for witch hunter?
---
THIS. I make $36/hr and I work from like 11am until 7pm every day. My free time is extremely valuable to me, but I have a bit of disposable income to kick around.
---
Hey! My dad is there too lol. how did u know?? 
---
Noed gamer. Got what you deserved loser
---
If I’m playing against legion and my teammates heal each time they get hit I just let myself die. These Claudette’s are so afraid of life. Especially the ones with holding on the lanterns that sit by the gate all game. 
---
pls be troll
---
You mean when you load into Haddonfield.
---
First I thought you did a Claudette.
---
Thx for the laugh btw
---
Idk if they fixed it but the last time I checked, speed add-ons didn't worked even when stacked so I don't bother using them.
---
The blades add-ons are pretty neat but it's like what you use when you can't afford any better ones.
---
Durations ones are pretty neat with a TR focused build.
---
Pins are completely worthless, they need to change the effect to something more useful, same for both ultra rares.
---
Recharge rates ones are decent, and with Frank's I feel like it's almost as good as cold dirt.
---
Cooldowns ones are just his best add-ons overall.
---
The most powerful combo is obviously Frank's with either cold dirt or the yellow ruller, second most powerful would be stab wound study replacing Frank's, I feel like using Frank with the study is a waste of perks but that's just my opinion.
---
Totally unfair since you had rank 17 &amp; 18 which are easy  victims. 
---
Since he also got 45 point I don't know why he start bitching me lol. Ty for ur advice.
---
Don't it return to the same lamp you've picked it from when you've been hooked?
---
There is no point to pick it before hatch/gates are opened though, unless you have the key.
---
You need to find them as a survivor too? Getting 25 points as a survivor is a lot, I agree, but so far while playing killer I’ve only had a handful of survivors actually escape. I’m guessing it’s going to be the same in similar ranks (red). People are more focused on finding the vessels than actually doing the gens, IME. I’d say it’s easier to hook people and destroy vessels than it is to find one and escape as a survivor.
---
Weak but very fun to play as, he gets gen rushed easily and he takes a long time to down someone. 
---
i [reposted ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/alnzhv/blind_hatchet_throw_blind_hatchet_throw/?st=JRKG3W9F&amp;sh=ca401bb3) it!
---
&gt; I'd rather derank
---
Lol is it a bad thing?
---
Debuff is more synonyms with a status effect. Either way you answered my question. It’s kinda weird to see having multiple people on a gen cause a red status bar. The only reason you’d know it’s red is if you’ve been following the development cycle and understand how Prove Thyself works now. I’d just have more than one person have a normal bar and give PT the yellow buff bar. 
---
I'd put it up to survivors killing each other to guarantee their escapes. The lanterns are fairly easy to find if you keep your priorities straight.
---
So saying GG now is Toxic? And here I thought this subreddit couldn't become any more ridiculous.
---
Yeah even with dedicated servers they won't ban people for leaving a potential game before it starts.
---
It's gone downhill for me, it's as if I were watching a really shitty made slide show.
---
Darn.
---
yaaaaayyy
---
Oh you brilliant bastard.
---
Thanks. I would also recommend you put the video in the description, so people can find it more easily.
---
These look insanely impractical for sprinting and vaulting in. 
---
Anyone got a link to the original image? I'd love to play this
---
I am not going to run this shit, hell naw
---
Forcefully exhaled from my nose, have my upvote good man
---
Surv main here
---
That's fucking cool as fuck . I love it
---
NOED doesn't apply to Hatchets
---
also, i did report a player with a proof yesterday. today i got a response: said the standard stuff "we'll begin investigating for you" which previously in my reports twice resolved in a ban for people(one for hacking, one for holding the game hostage by bodyblocking basement with two healthy survivors in it).
---
however, i will ask cause i'm curious since there's really nothing strict about this matter, which i assume is due to fact that it always depends on the game overall. if someone urban immerses for say, 5 minutes, to figure out how killer travels from gen to gen, that's different since they have intention to actually start progressing the game towards end while getting the evade points. but someone literally only immersing in corners might be considered hostage situation or griefing. 
---
Teabagging is someone who presses crouch repeatedly
---
Camper is someone who stands next to a cook insuring that one person doesn't get to play the game
---
People comparing these are shit tier killer mains that love circle jerking on this sub, but don't say that or they'll mass downvote you
---
The survivor cant move in this scenario though. They dont have the option to go do gens, so yes this is bannable.
---
But you get the exposed status when the gates are opened, you didnt realize?
---
Are you selling? Because I'd love to hang this piece on my wall 
---
Can you send the unedited picture?
---
It’s not disproving anything. It’s not a debate. Not everything on reddit has to be an argument. It’s just something that happened that related to what he was saying. 
---
Irony
---
I messin with ya. Feng min 
---
Yeah, it's so toxic to not want to be facecamped. Only toxic people actually want to play the game
---
I had 3 games as killer tonight, I found one vessel after I hooked someone but ran out of time to destroy it. Besides that single hanging vessel, I didn’t see any others. 
---
If you’re green/purple ranked survivors on PS4, You’ve got nothing to worry about in my lobby.
---
Amazing on the bunny.
---
Except there's manbaby killer mains who literally camp for no reason. I main killer and I've been called toxic purely for looping a killer long when I was doing a daily on survivor. So many babies on both sides but this sub pretends that it's only survivors for some reason 
---
He’s talking about the lobby fireworks. 
---
survivor #1 is incorrect, as a killer I can destroy lanterns in close proximity to a hooked survivor even if that survivor didnt have a lantern. also you gain 500 BP per minute you carry a lantern, so might as well.
---
killer #1 is always true w.r.t. BP gain and gaining more coin points emphasizes this even more. if you camp you're screwing with yourself as much as the surv (who even gets additional coin points while being hooked if his fellow survs finish gens -- you as killer do not!)
---
Bubba and his pudding ❤️
---
Literally what...Are you mentally ok? Do you even realize what you're typing?
---
I always do a quick double teabag after someone heals me as a sign of thank you... 
---
I remember seeing a video where a twitch streamer and his friend were playing the killer and feng in a KYF 1v1 game to see how they played. (This was a while back, so maybe it was the PTB?) And the guy playing doctor was literally right behind feng Chasing her and zapping her and it wasn't doing anything.
---
Rank means nothing after you hit the greens, it wasn't unfair, you were just bad.
---
Maybe start bringing the killer to people that are claudetting...
---
There's two susies
---
As a fellow treasure hunting ace main, maybe try new builds over the next 2 weeks? Turn that frown upside down by throwing pebbles at killers.... or megs.
---
I get your point but you still can hook survivors if you have the perks. You can use Franklins in order to stop people from gen rushing and I'm pretty sure BBQ is a must have during this event. And I'm not saying survivors shouldn't pick the vessels/Lanterns until the very end. I'm just saying they shouldn't pick them up literally when the game starts or when no gens are done
---
Damn do I wish I already had pebbles unlocked. I spend my sharts on characters only and I do not have adam yet
---
I don't think you're allowed to advertise like this?
---
There is no ultra rare medkit, else I’d have said go for pharmacy and get some medkits.
---
Maybe your meme can do with pulling an insta heal out if a chest? 
---
Love these killers...also have seen one where they killer the hatch camper then kill me but let me out cuz other person didnt do a thing except hatch camp
---
This is correct. Hooking a survivor without a vessel will turn an existing, non-claimed vessel red. 
---
Source: me hooking the last non-glowing survivor just to see a vessel turn red. 
---
Quick question do you still get blood points for carrying the vessel if you don't burn an envelope? I hadn't tested it without the envelope yet.
---
&gt;1) Don't take/pick up the vessels at the start of the match! You're just risking losing the vessel for nothing and you're helping the killer farm the vessels. Killers can't destroy the vessels unless a survivor who caries them gets hooked.
---
This is incorrect, the killer can destroy any lanterns as long as he hooks someone.
---
"I'm committing!" "God damnit its like 99.9%!"
---
I’d go Bbq/Nurse’s/Iron Maiden/Shadowborn (I would go for bitter murmur for one of these but I don’t have it yet) 
---
THIS. I took off all possibly toxic Perks ages ago and only rely on skill. I don't Teabag and I don't Facecamp, nor do I do anything others complain about.
---
 Yet every single fucking match in this event everyone's either been Facecamping, Proxycamping + Tunnel or verbally abusive in Post-Game chat. I don't wanna succumb to this fucking toxic trash but the Playerbase doesn't really make it easy.

Yeah, but I knew it would be just as toxic. Survivors sandbagging to get the lantern, killers dc'ing to stop you from getting it etc.

Hello fellow "I know how to dress Nea, the queen, properly". Sorry you had to go through this prime example of red rank killers in EUW since a month. 
---
Can you Eli5 that perk cause I’d have thought Whispers would have been more practical. Sorry to seem dumb I just watched some YouTube comparison videos with that perk and didn’t notice much difference 
---
and if it messes up badly enough, it'll get another patch out to fix it... which happened in this case quickly.
---
Can we get that costume for the pig please?
---
He’s looking very dapper, nice artwork!
---
Am I the only one who can't get in? Instant error code ever since last night. I figured it was still the usual event server thing but it's still happening and everyone else seems fine... 
---
Hex: Third seal
---
Its sooo good when every killer has it to annoy the people with lanterns and then he hits them and nobody gets insta downed. It was worth taking of my 2nd Chance "I make Killers angry" Perk Deliverance for it. 
---
Matchmaking is not broken. Its just the fact that its way easier to farm the event as surv
---
On xbox just bring up the side menu or play pandora

With 1 gen left the killer is going to camp anyway, if you unhook me before the gen pops I'm 100% getting tunneled and doesn't matter if he uas NOED because I'm injured, so 100% I'm going down. At least with Adrenaline I have a chance. Pop the gen before unhooking. And for the love of god, open the gates.
---
They didn’t change them in the end.
---
*screams in nurse* *actual nurse* *help me ace this pathology test*
---
Btw, I don’t bully in an Ochido way, I only bm when the killer was either tunneling or camping. Then again, just saying that this is a game where everyone plays the way he or she wants to. Could have phrased my comment better.
---
You don't get any points of you don't leave with vessel?  Do you not get the gen points either? 
---
Oh fuck... uhhh bookworm but is actually a huge chad
---

You’re a gamer girl. My statement was correct

Plot twist: Am a dude

OoO does not work in lockers.
---
thought it was freddy for a second, good job
---
&gt; This event has turned into a “prevent the other side from getting any event points” more that anything else
---
That's like every DbD event ever, no?
---
🦀🦀🦀
---
OH FUCK
---
It's been the case since the game came out and I've played for nearly that long so I'm generally just expecting it to break in some major way by now. 
---
My expectations are low enough that minor (e.g. sliding around) or medium bugs (e.g. that Wraith Sloppy Butcher bug) don't really surprise me and big or gamebreaking bugs (e.g. the one where you could stack perks or use other Killers' powers a long time ago) make me mostly just say "Oh". I still play (if it's playable) and I admit it's always a bit interesting for me to see how it's broken this time when a new update goes live.
---
Simply put, [you get used to it](https://m8g.s-ul.eu/tofp7sUo.png).
---
That depends on survivors-to-killers ratio and it's not a public knowledge, so I can't say. But if it was possible in the past to wait 15-20 minutes for a game (in red ranks soon after rank reset) then I don't see why it can't be like that now.
---
*Cleric beast noises*
---
Is this the real life?
---
I just got out of a KYF doing some testing and it does work in lockers. There was a bug that made it so that, if you entered an animation like doing a gen or entering a locker, your OoO would lock in place and think you’re looking in one direction. I’m assuming they fixed that thought.
---
Its just standard event issues. Killers were having to afk in lobbies and play other games while waiting during the last event
---
Not talking about that.I reach them and then they just kill themselves right when Im near.
---
That's the point. You should focus on gens because you get 4 points for every gen done. Doesn't matter if you escape or not. 
---
I kinda want s hillbilly cosmetic now with this skin color
---
Yeah it's survivor sided.
---
i wouldn‘t even bother saving the clip lol 
---
This is OP
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/1jarli](https://imgflip.com/i/1jarli)
---
That was obviously lag.Nothing to do with skill.
---
Yeah, if you don’t mindgame you also waste time  so why would you NOT want to mindgame?  Have you seen the video? Also, saying to use the “no mindgame” mindgame is a mindgame lol... so mindgames SHOULD  be used to cut chasetime significantly. It’s the whole basis of skill in this game, being able to run tiles and predict whether or not the survivor is going to fake or not fake certain tiles. 
---
Freddy getting that buff 2022!! BOIIII
---
Pharmacy helps get an automatic first medkit
---
It seems like almost every event brings in these posts every day of the event 
---
Personally I use self care, adrenaline, borrowed time and in the fourth slot I differentiate between Bond, Empathy or Balanced Landing. Those perks are definitely worthwhile getting. There's also Laurie's perk called Decisive Strike, commonly known as DS or the perk killers cry about. If you're using DS, prepare to get facecamped more than usual!
---
Urban Evasion is a good perk if you're the stealthy kind of player. On a Claudette with the right cosmetics, you can hide pretty much anywhere and still get across the map fairly fast.
---
A lot of perks are just not worth getting, so here's a short list of the perks that are. I might forget to put some on in but I'll correct it if I remember them again.
---
Dwight: Prove Thyself 
---
Since the new update, if you have an swf with at least one Prove Thyself, you can gen rush like no tomorrow.
---
Dwight: Bond
---
Just a handy perk to find people. 
---
Meg: Adrenaline
---
This perk is so underrated, because if it pops during a chase, you get healed and can run away. It saves many of my lives. 
---
Claudette: Self Care
---
Self explanatory really. 
---
Claudette: Empathy
---
A good perk to see where injured survivors are, either in a chase or in need of a heal. I personally use it to get a flashlight save on my mates. 
---
Jake: Iron Will
---
If you're going for a stealth build, this can help. It makes your survivor stop grunting from pain, so the killer can't sound whore on you and find you again. 
---
David: We're Gonna Live Forever
---
This perk just gives you more bloodpoints as long as you get the altruism stacks. 
---
David: Dead Hard
---
If you use Dead Hard, you basically dodge a Killer's attack. Handy on pallet or window loops, but an experienced killer will just wait it out once he knows you run it. 
---
Nea: Balanced Landing
---
Also a chase stretcher if used effectively. On almost every map, there is a drop from height, such as hills or structures. This perk puts distance between you and the killer, allowing you to make another pallet. 
---
Nea: Urban Evasion
---
This is stealth perk number 1, makes you pretty hard to spot while also traversing the map at a decent pace. 
---
Laurie: Decisive Strike
---
Basically gives you another chase if you can make it far enough before killer isn't stunned. For new players it's a pretty hard skill check, but it gets easier as time goes. 
---
Every perk on this list is available without buying any DLC except Laurie, but it might appear on the shrine of secrets. 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
There's a difference between using a pallet once and running around the pallet 50 times like an incel. It's not fun for any of us (talking for all killers and survivors).
---
I recently played a game with a survivor that kept juking me, quickly hiding behind some corners after vaulting so i walked right past him, i was impressed because that required actual skill and was much more interesting than those "YeS i RuN 50 TiMeS aRoUnD a PaLlEt, u wAnT mE tO rUn iN a StRaIgHt LiNe aNd lEt yOu kIlL Me" survivors. If only the game had more players like that guy, he did survive and actually deserved the escape. 
---
Exactly
---
There are 14 survivors (15 counting Bill), and more than enough perks to mess around and make builds with. 
---
so whispers &gt; sfts still?
---
"no mither" i giggled 
---
Easily still one of the best perks...
---
I think you’re on to something. I did 3 survivor games last night and managed to get 45+ each time. I got a coin fairy quickly. For killer, I was definitely harder to pull higher numbers. My queue times have been very quick as killer. 
---
If you play in a SWF it’s not that good alone yes or if you don’t have any thing els
---
saggin' oversized slim jeans, a typical style for \[read the first word backwards\]
---
I mean, it’s not bad on huntress, but can you honestly say it has more utility than BBQ, Ruin, Whispers, and Nurse’s calming? I imagine it would be ok on a mapwide TR doctor build so survivors can’t just hide in a locker, so they have to choose between getting T3 madness all the time or being exposed every once in awhile. 
---
this video made me a fan.
---
If no-one escapes do we still get the gen repair points?  They're secured?  
---
Are the gen points collective?  Like if I repaired 0 gens but other survs repaired 3 and then I died, would I get points for their repairs?
---
Or do I just get gen points for the ones that I repair?
---
Something like “when you’re a SWF team with comms but the killer still gets a 4K” may have worked better. 
---
What the fuck, piss of this subreddit psycho 
---
Prepare to get a shit ton of downvotes from salty survivor mains 
---
*inbred screeching*
---
Downvoted, not enough survivor salt.
---
The first game I ever played as a killer I killed one survivor and had another one hooked, they had the gates open and I found them all teabagging, obviously trying to bait into attacking so they could save their friend, but instead I just waited at the gates until their friend died, they escaped and then complained about me camping. I’ve met some toxic killers but I think survivors are worse by far 
---
Well if there’s one good trait he *did* get from his parents, it’s his mothers presumed thiccness
---
highkey disgusting
---
It actually does because the killer can just destroy it if survivors aren't carrying it. 
---
I played as p3 dwight and i just somehow fucked up struggling when i guess pebble boi was going to save me. If it was you then sorry :/
---
No, i was thinking maybe it’s my remote but i don’t have a problem healing myself or doing gens, maybe I’m high lol idk :-/ I’ll try to make a video of it when it happens again 
---
Ah right, I watched a part of it so i may have missed that
---
Small PP sure, but my kill percentages and bloodpoints are stellar.
---
Teach me how to draw like you! Agreed everyone here is so talented 
---
Same with the BBQ event as well. Although in both cases killers weren't much better. An abundance of Mori's and anti-gen builds.
---
Yeah, Claudette players are usually very passive and assume their teammates are going for the save. It’s not until you reach struggle phase that they realize “oh shit my teammates aren’t saving him” and they go for the save. Don’t fault them for that. Healing over sloppy butcher instead of going for the save when you’re near struggle phase though? Big no no. 
---
&gt;2) Don't tunnel survivors during the event cuz this is the most toxic thing ever since survivors can't really do anything about it.
---
You're cute. 
---
nice bro, it's just that it seems like one of his head spikes is missing, other than that, completely realistic and detailed
---
He gave credit though. 
---
Thank you! :3
---
I did that once. I had the time to spare and I wasn’t in the mood to let the survivor escape. Waited 45 mins just chillin listening to music and looking at memes until he jumped and I caught him.
---
This post was brought to you by the killer gang 
---
Thank you!
---
Either trollin or mad salty.
---
Thanks! Her hair was the hardest part...mostly because I'm lazy :p
---
Yea this need to get removed
---
Flat chests are a lifestyle
---
In a perfect world, yes. But you always have dumb fucks who will wait near the hook till you die on the hook. 
---
Yes, especially if you know how to use it to triangulate effectively. But IMO it will always be better just for being far more reliable than crows. You could always try running both in tandem if you're real doubtful about your tracking but I found it was excessive and Whispers ended up helping more anyway.
---
I will *heavily* consider it ewe
---
That was lagswitch at its finest.
---
Cool you don’t need to be rude. Keep scrolling 😁
---
Yes thank you. 
---
Big oof; tough choice 
---
Probably Huntress. She scares me less in game haha
---
it does make sense if the survivor taking it is burning the offering. you get 1000 bp for taking it off and 500 bp per x seconds. i dont see whats the issue in getting some bp
---
you can do that sure. but what OP is showing and that /u/sgt-sevens
---
doesn't seem to realise is that the survivor isn't being given the option to do anything, its all in control of the killer.
---
You can "wait 45 minutes" or two hours or however long... but there is no point in waiting if the survivor doesnt have the option to do anything at all.
---
selfcare is garbage but people still do run it. it takes too long to heal oneself
---
sprint burst is replace by dead hard (david perk) for the better survivors
---
bond and iron will is good as always
---
Yes, you need either escape with the vessel (looks like a lantern) or at the very least hold one multiple times throughout the match. Every time you're hooked while holding a lantern, it goes back to where you found it and you need to grab it again. 
---
Great idea, lets ban SWF (insert anything here) cause it ruins for killer.
---
But i saw this more than all the axes in stock that the huntress have
---
Yeah but it's not like that here! It's just super annoying. You just grab the best items you have and burn an envelope but guess what, killer finds you first and tunnels you. That's just stupid
---
You can buy the cosmetics anyway. 
---
Yes you do 
---
no you dont
---
They already ran a test where killers could do that. It did not make it through to release.
---
I just hit the survivor at that point because of the un-fun time investment it takes.
---
I think the only way of stopping it would be some literal divine intervention. It needs to force one of the sides to 'win' the hatch standoff automatically to avoid the un-fun bhavior. 
---
I vote for a stun effect being applied to the killer after 10 seconds of the final survivor and killer standing around the hatch.
---
Sometimes yeah. I was able to play 3 games last night 2 of them I gained progress but the last one even though i finished 2 gens held a vessel and escaped with it the entire game, I didnt gain any progress while my friend who did 2 gens and didnt have a vessel at all the whole game got max progression 
---
&gt;The killer can only destroy a lamp if the person they've hooked was carrying one. They can't destroy lamps otherwise.
---
Wrong. Once you hook a survivor, you can destroy any lantern around the map. 
---
Hooking someone carrying a lantern only causes it go back to its spawn. 
---
Camping is not bannable or even reportable. Devs consider it a legitimate tactic.
---
That's no truth, that's utter bullshit.
---
Not the same game... 
---
How to get rid of campers:
---
Step 1: Git Gud and loop him for as long as you can.
---
Step 2: Rush gens. 
---
Step 3: Use Borrowed Time and trade places in the hook to gain more time to rush gens and open the exit gates. 
---
If I tunnel I can get more lanterns broken and more kills, why would I not do that?
---
#FBI open up 
---
It doesnt. They get salty and insta dc instead lol so no one has time to write in the chat
---
All lamps become destroyable but keep in mind you can only destroy one each hook. 
---
You will. A macro can be considered third-party software that gives you a competitive edge, which is one of the report categories. You'd keep going for a while because it's hard to catch since it's not that difficult to struggle effectively, but you will get caught and banned eventually.
---
Keybinding is fine though, there's one specifically for struggling. I bound my struggle to mousewheel down. It's in the game, you're not using any third-party software to change the keybind, so it's fine and IMO a lot easier to scroll than hammer space.
---
I honestly don't know if using a macro is bannable or not. So I just recommend that you change the struggle key to scroll mouse wheel. That way, you don't break your spacebar and still feel a struggle.
---
Ochido grammar lookin ass
---
Nice photoshop. Everyone knows camaraderie is not possible in this game./s
---
will they remain in the store or will it be a legacy item like the david jacket from last years event?
---
If it remains in the store then there's no point in playing, lol
---
It'd not increase revenue so it's never gonna happen.
---
1 hour? no thanks. Dc and other match
---
Well when you play mountain characters that aren’t the best at hiding then what, with all the aura perks that both sides have, and a whole killer dedicated to anti stealth, stealth is not viable at all
---
They'll stay in the store theres nothing to worry about 
---
Yeah i've seen those players. I personally bring DS just to counter tunnelling and most of the time I don't even use it. 
---
+1000 everytime you pick up a vessel.
---
+500 from time to time when carrying one.
---
+5000 when escaping with one.
---
You’re the one insulting me buddy. I can clearly tell you’re one of those people who insults the killer after a match and teabags at the exit gate. 
---
Damn. I take it back. Sorry, mate
---
No worries
---
I don't understand
---
Just make it so the survivors can't see the outline of the boxes until they get trapped, and make it so getting near a hatch pops the trap.
---
Pig is right now the strongest late game killer, give her NOED and Remember Me and save your traps until there is 1 gen left or the gates are open. It extends the game longer then you think, especially if you get 1-2 kills early.
---
I've had the opposite experience on PS4. Past green ranks no one cares and I never get dodged. 
---
In b4 Micolash is the next killer.
---
kinda looks like the clown xD
---
Get into high ranks. Eventually you meet those who stuck it through and evetnually you find yourself surrounded by those who actually do shit instead of urban potatoeing around the map. 
---
That's not true. You're just using the easy way out. But I can't really blame you. It's what devs should've fixed but they can't fix it in a way it doesn't get abused by SWF
---
It's not?
---
I like the shading and the little details on the weapon! Awesome work dude
---
Gotta love killers getting way less than survivors 
---
If all survivors are 21+ and meg is still in high school, does that mean leatherface is actually on par or possibly even better intelligence wise with meg?
---
The killers job is to kill. The survivors job is to escape. 
---
What you called toxic is still in service to getting kills. What survivors do is just being a douchebag. When teabagging for ten minutes in the exit gates becomes an objective, we’ll talk.
---
Ye i agree, It was about the principle. That he wanted to go so far to body block just to force an dc. I regret nothing! :D
---
True.  Will his moaning be a perk?
---
Then get off Reddit, get a job, and buy more.
---
When you’re working on a gen and you hear Michaels tier up music but can’t find him
---
99.9% of the time my ruin spawns right next to a generator 
---
The other 00.1% is actually good
---
Or you’re just not good enough to actually be able to get them.
---
Hahahaha
---
It has nothing to do with matchmaking it’s just way easier to play survivor during the event so everyone is playing survivor rn
---
Exactly, it seems this person did not know otherwise.
---
You *ascended*
---
Seriously? Lost what, a few hours of progress? I've played about 4hours of the event after the fix and already have 3 coins, it's not a huge deal. We have two weeks to get it and it's not hard
---
you’re missing the point. Killers should NEVER respect pallets, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t mindgame. Watch the damn video already, and you’ll know what I’m talking about. 
---
I remember getting chased by a Billy for at least 2 minutes (0-8000 boldness when I went down), and 0 generators popped during that time. When I go down, I see all my teammates crouching around, looking for the Ruin. This was Rank 4 on PS4. *ffs it's not even that hard to hit great skill checks I hit them about 70% of the time*
---
Oh so that's why I got instant lobbies on rank 2 as a killer... 
---
Yes, thanks
---
Just an Exhaustion perk, an Aura Reading perk, a Chase perk and a freebie. For the 4th I usually run a Killer Tracking or Immersion perk. Today I'm running Lithe, Bond, Urban Evasion and Spine Chill.
---
I don't believe you can destroy carried lanterns right? I think you may have misunderstood 
---
The other 0.1% you mean? That time it spawns next to a survivor.
---
One thing I’ve learned as a survivor, with or without events, is that other survivors owe you nothing. Sure you may be really altruistic, but that doesn’t mean the other three randoms HAVE to be as well. 
---
My point is, they’re called “survivors” not “rescuers.” Yeah it sucks, but not everyone is going to help you. 
---
As survivor the maximum amount of points you can get is 45.  That is assuming that every match you live to see all 5 generators completed and escape with a lantern.  As killer if you consistently 4K and collect at least two lanterns per game you can get 30 per match.  Largely as killer it depends on how many lanterns you collect.  The problem is that most survivors right now if you go into this solo are treating this as a battle royale, and a lot of killers are bringing in their mori's or dodging matches wasting everyones time.  So all in all, it's about the same for both sides in point gain.  But in my opinion it's more consistent for Killer to gain event points.
---
holy fuck that sounds like you me and my people
---
Franklins to stop gen rushing?
---
This belongs in a museum 
---
Man it's a really shitty event. 1 skin outta 3 is meh
---
In console dead hard works as long as the frames want it to work
---
all this did was annoy me. what an asshole meg.
---
text was funny though.
---
Time to t-bag again
---
And why is a survivor entitled to the hatch? They can leave and go do gens and if the killer comes run back to hatch take hit and jump or  keep doing it until the opportunity is right or they have gens done and go for doors. You survivor mains disgust me with your entitlement.
---
Sam goes for me, I never win anything
---
Legion is busted overpowered with the right add-ons and perks. 
---
They are borderline unplayable weak without the right add-ons or perks. 
---
With *some* of each they can do moderately well in some cases, but typically reaches a point where survivors will power creep them out until you can run the right add-ons every single match or finally get access to the right teachables (if you didn't have them already).
---
So, extremely high ceiling, extremely low floor, and is heavily dependent on what their build is. Their strength is very asymmetric in that they don't really gain any advantages with their add-ons and perks until suddenly they're nearly unstoppably powerful.
---
Dead hard is not as strong as BL or SB even if it works
---
The killer can wait for it or just hold m1 pressed if hrs close enough
---
Against insta downs it is useless unlike SB or BL because those two give you a bigger distance
---
Against Nurse dead hard might be better but any stealth killers (Pig, Freddy,Wraith) can be countered by SB
---
Balanced landing is kinda map dependig
---
Id rather have 4 dead hard players than 4 SB players
---
10/10
---
nooooo i wanna play videogames :( 
---
So Friday the 13th?
---
I, no shit, pebble distracted 90% of my killers last night. I laughed so fucking loud when they happened.
---
pebble cult
---
Thank you Kanye very cool
---
&gt;about
---
I mean, Myers wears all black, has a white mask, and never talks. So . . .
---
my favourites are the ones that refuse to let you heal them and just self-care themselves. Even better when they then fail a skill check and then run away again
---
I've spawned inside the killer shack with the hex totem inside the killer shack at least twice (as a survivor)
---
Claudette comment gimme karma
---
You called me toxic, kiddo and sad.
---
Get off your high horse.
---
You probably use P3 claudette with flashight decisive, hide all game then jump the pallet repeatedly at the end until the killer comes over to ser you tbagging before you get the hatch.
---
Checkmate.
---
I'm hyped for my thermodynamics test today.
---
How did this make me laugh?!?! I need to play more games....
---
That feeling when you realize that **the event hooks can be sabotaged this event.**
---
You're missing the point. I know that he had the time to jump, I know he put himself in that corner (unintentionally ofc). This videos purpose is not about people analysing if the survior could have done something differnt. I'm pretty sure almost everyone was aware that he had the time to escape or had the time to run away. Idk why you feel the need to even make an comment like that when It's super obivious. That's why I named the video like that, I'm tired of inrelevant discussions on reddit. So sorry if I made you mad for that title.
---
Hmm, that sounds like a good idea. Sadly my scroll is busted. Been trying difference mouses but it refuses to scroll properly.
---
How can he get 45 points when dying? Max is 20 for the 5 gens
---
Yep. Enjoy the grind.
---
That’s because it’s a, early in the morning (at least in the us) or 2, not very many people have checked out this post, since typically the only types of people to go on rant posts are either people who agree or douchbags. 
---
Sometimes the rants also make a point and draw people who either agree or disagree with that point, and sometimes the rant crosses the line into toxicity and gets well deserved downvotes. 
---
Yes probably but I haven't played killer while using an offering so far.
---
Awww, She's really cute!
---
omg...!facepalm
---
Both kinda suck to be honest. Spine chill will help you if you struggle with invisible killers though.
---
Why do i not get those survivors in my killer games. 
---
That happens like 1/10 games that lore than one is insanely immersed 
---
If you really want to avoid the killer, Premonition is better. The problem is it will go off at times the killer isn't heading your direction so if you leave a gen to hide, you're wasting time. 
---
I prefer Spine Chill since I don't have to keep looking around to know the killer is coming and that extra boost has helped me finish getting an Exit Gate open just in time to escape.
---
Haha don’t bother the cosmetics are shitty anyways 
---
So your answer is to just buff killers? That doesnt seem fair especially as the killer already has a 3k at that point
---
I already got my whole feng min outfit so it's working
---
“We have come too far to back down!”
---
This hurts to read
---
You're having to explain yourself and getting downvoted for using certain perks. That's what's really fucked up. Grow up and learn to play around these perks people. Killers can make it as hard as they want, they aren't in it to make it fun for the survivor. They are in it to kill the survivor. 
---
They are already planning to do something with the hatch. The fact how the hatch standoff is won or lost depending on who acts first is stupid. This was just an alternate solution to preventing it
---
Well i only like the Feng cosmetic, other than that its shitty
---
ue right fam
---
all this event has done for me has gotten me tunneled more as survivor, and make me feel more like a piece of shit as killer. people are farming left n' right because the only time killers can break lanterns is when someone is hooked.
---
Too wholesome.
---
Next time, don’t make a bush your house.
---
Well its a terrible suggestion by you
---
Some alternatives, I've seen people bind it to E, F or C. My friend uses M1, seems weird to me, but that's also an option.
---
Probably wouldn't work for me, I tired out at around 20% or so. Don't think a smaller key would do anything.
---
Iron maiden is really not that good. You also really should not get rid of whispers on huntress. It's a very good perk on her, better than the joke of a perk iron maiden.
---
This is the other way around. Everyone is playing survivor so you can't find any killers. Don't really know why though since the event is easier to complete as killer anyways lol
---
Really nice drawing man❤
---
!redditcopper
---
You got a YT, Twitch or something else my dude? You seem like great fun, and you'd probably make it quite far if you start making videos!
---
Did I ask
---
I don't think this is true, i had 2 people escape with a vessel each, and I escaped like 5 seconds after with no vessel. Only got 20 points for 5 gens and that's it.
---
My idiot ass decided to try to save the last survivor that was hooked, while I was standing at the gate witt my latern.. the other two players who were dead at this point were selfish, never tried to help anyone that was hooked, barely did any gens etc. But the last hooked survivor tried to help them, but whenever she got hooked they didn't help her. So I felt bad and tried to save her, even though the Wraith was face camping her and had NoeD. Ofcourse we both didn't make it :(
---
Yes, enjoy collecting 4500 coins for everything.
---
The nodding is always a good route to go! If people can be absolutely sure you're not chasing them when you approach it's helpful as well. It's a lot easier I've learned on stealthy killers? I think it's because the spooky heartbeat of the other killers throws them off! 
---
spine chill
---
That’s gonna run survivor queues up and killers will still dodge anyways
---
Yeah, but that wasn't really the scenario I was speaking of. I also get face camped for looping / tossing down pallets, or just... because I have no idea.
---
But almost all of the most toxic post game chat has come from survivors, win or lose. It's actually not been so bad lately, but there have been a few special cases.
---
Good bot
---
Eww
---
I like the idea
---
both perks are bad but if you had to choose between them spine chill is much better
---
premo is bad since it can go off even if the killer isn't coming in your direction, which makes you hide from nothing and wastes a ton of time. spine chill on the other hand tells you exactly when to leave and is therefore more efficient. It also gives a buff and has no cooldown.
---
isnt that the slippery meat Icon?
---
What would you recommend instead then? In all seriousness, I'm still playing around with survivor perk builds and would appreciate recommendations. 
---
You can do your job as the killer without being an absolute dogshit asshole tho, you know. But that would actually require you to be good at the game.
---
&gt; I don’t play huntress.
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
Sure, you can do with your money whatever you want, 100%. I didn't say anything against that.
---
But it doesn't change the fact that it's pretty dumb to not at least play for 1.
---
Whichever is higher. If they are same tier, Spine Chill.
---
"Killers who run the shittiest builds and camp you just to get points from altruistic survivors"
---
So nothing new then. 
---
Wow, thats pretty harsh.
---
&gt;get off Reddit
---
What does that have to do with anything
---
&gt;get a job
---
Once I'm out of university. Also, I have parttime jobs
---
&gt;and buy more
---
No, I prefer earning them trough gameplay.
---
Just use technician on Feng, instant Electrical engineering degree

I played a few hours last night, was too triggered by the toxicity. I’m honestly just not gonna be playing much tbh. I’m happier getting this all done. /shrugs.
---
How is this any different from the norm? 
---
I prefer pigs over bunnies
---
I do upload my content to youtube aswell, I tend to use reddit so I get some form of views, haha, [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw/featured](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw/featured)
---
Luckily i haven't had to experience a hatch standoff this long before.
---
Keep up the good edits! 
---
F - Fashion
---
That's unfortunate, hopefully more people pick up the mantle of killer, it is the more difficult and frustrating role but like so many bloodpoints! 
---
Ok whatever people tell you please don't run balanced landing or urban evasion. BL is the worst exhaustion perk and I don't know why everyone wants their crouching at walk speed but there is literally no point
---
I'm rank 9 survivor and I have to wait around 20 minutes most times
---
Frustrating
---
You’re pretty good 
---
on ps4 the player base was very small
---
when tha game was free on psn many players came
---
after 6 months most of them just left the rest will leave until summer
---
"doodling"
---
You fucker I couldn't do that if I tryharded for my goddamn life because someone holds a loaded Pfeifer-Zeliska .600 on my head, about to splatter my brain all over the wall you call that DOODLING?!
---
4th grade art class. Mrs. Johnson lol
---
Exactly what I did when my friend got hooked and the nea just hid not going for the save even though I ran away from the hook so she could save at some point the huntress noticed the "immersed nea" was just hiding so she let me go cause fck her then she gave me hatch gg huntress well played. Dont recommend doing this most of the time lol
---
Rtgame on youtube has some videos with titles like *blank* is a flawless masterpiece with no flaws whatsoever
---
U
---
No. It have 1 charge so it must be op. If you want to remove fireworks you delete huntress ultra rare deal? 
---
Yes. Exactly.
---
I'm genuinely curious as I'm new. How can you "run" an addon in this game when it's a very rare single use thing? Is it possible to farm them somehow or something?
---
Well the killer can't just wait to hit you if you are at a pallete. And yeah there a there are multiple ways to insta down in the game, but there are fewer places to drop down on every map. Some maps have a chance to have literally none
---

But really, thank you!!
---
Lucky you!  
---
Thanks man, appreciate it!  
---
I don't think that's the issue, I think this is a bug cus even with a 4-man the queue time is over 30 mins
---
It's behaviour way, need killers like Bubba or Doc and buff nurse. I don't even. What Doc nerf btw ?
---
And other dumb poeple say dS oP nErF iT dOn'T hAvE aNy cOuNtErS 
---
survivor or killer? i played about the same not even on 1.5
---
I mean, you kind of did.
---
May I talk with you about prayer beads ghosties?
---
It is a doodle!! But it def takes practice! A LOT OF IT. I'M NEARLY FOUR YEARS IN. I pretend to be an artist for a living, so it's a matter of time put into the craft! &lt;3 
---
Sooo... You had time to do this meme while studying... Mhh... 
---
Yeah, I feel like if David is gay, he's likely more interested in someone with his own body size or someone like Jake. This is based on gay couple I've seen IRL.
---
But then again fandom like to pair strong guy with weak guy. I don't know why. Also it doesn't help that both David and Jake are very popular characters who are paired with many other characters, make and female, I guess. 
---
Yes but I believe you need to burn a Red Envelope offering to get bonus BP. Otherwise, you only get Lunar Points.
---
The shittiest builds is kinda new. I've encountered fair shares of asslaholery but some of them are going to new lengths.
---
Gens are shared. If a gen is done by anyone, everyone gets 5 points. 
---
Doc is getting nerfed?
---
Lol man why can't I get more killers like you? I'm the freaking nicest survivor (unless one of those dicks tries to kill me, gloves are off then.)
---
Calm Spirit counters madness, Snap Out of It removed from Nurse's Calling, buffs to other Killers to make them more viable (indirect), and adding more big maps. 
---
Not saying these should be reverted, by any stretch, but that Doctor could use some lovin' to compensate.
---
Aweee. I'm so honored! Thank you so much! 
---
Oh,  I thought you meant they were about to flat out nerf him
---
there
---
https://imgur.com/a/qPt54yQ 
---
i was right
---
Old nerfs, see above
---
Same here. Only one red envelope per bloodweb and my characters are also level 50. 
---
Nah but I wouldn't be surprised
---
I main doctor because he's the most fun to me and all the blood points he gives is insane. Doctor is really good at finding people, but like you said his power is useless and more like a "farm" thing 
---
nobody uses calm spirits
---
and nurse calling is not a good perk for doc
---
i dont heaed many players use that perk with doc
---
r/humblebrag
---
Yeah I'm playing more killer now because of them.
---
Such a shame as I had a chance of reaching rank 1 For the first time.
---
The funny part is that you  probs didnt need to leave matchmaking to doodle that since matchmaking is that long...
---
Great doodle though :)
---
I agree that he doesn't need to be nerfed, but I'm a pretty casual on and off player.
---
That being said, he's absolutely my least favorite killer to play against because of the running around shocking everything strategy. Sometimes I luck out, but good Doctors are frustrating to go against and I always die. Should I just be getting in a locker every time he comes around or what? It seems like when you get down to the last couple of generators (and especially if he gets an early kill) his ability to patrol gens is really top notch! Maybe I should play more Doctor... but I just want to be Michael if I'm killing.
---
No he meant like repair speed is 0% when nobody is working on it, and one Survivor adds 100% to that.
---
I HATE 30 MINUTE WAIT TIMES 
---
Honestly think he’s fine where he is. I just saw the movie and o think dbd nails it. What are people’s gripes with him?
---
*Hissssss*
---
I've been downvoted before for saying that Doctor is a bottom tier killer, same tier as Freddy and Legion (Though Freddy is just straight up worse). 
---
"What about using his best add-ons?" Listen, every killer with their best add-ons are a force to be reckoned with, but Iri King Doc is easier to deal with than the likes of Exhaustion Clown, Iri Head Huntress, or Silent Spirit.
---
He's nothing but an M1 killer with amazing tracking (which isn't needed for most good killers using one or two tracking perks) and a situational "vault denial" that can be played around. He's easy to play, and punishes bad survivors, but vs good survivors, his ability barely does anything.
---
I say this when (currently) Doc is the killer I play the most. Because I'm new-ish to killer and I'm not great at tracking yet. In games as other killers, I've been having much faster chases, just longer gaps between them.
---
I didn't hear about him getting nerfs, though. What did I miss?
---
It was in game don't it? I remember I can open it when I wae on the ground
---
&gt; it takes 2 seconds to destroy a lamp,
---
LOL, it takes 2 seconds if you happen to hook someone next to one.
---
Hook someone on the other side of the map? well let's hope you know where a lamp is and can get to it before they get saved or die because then you wasted 10-15 seconds for nothing.
---
Plus it's super funny to kill all of them and on the scoreboard they have all rare perks and items while im just sitting with yellow discordance
---
Last survivor camping the hatch only hurts their team, and without the hatch the killer gets an automatic 4K if they get the third kill with 2 gens left, one on some maps. The best survivor in the world can’t 1v1 a rank 20 killer with multiple gens left because all the killer has to do is follow them and they can never repair, and because of how chases work will eventually catch them. 
---
One thousand fucking upvotes.
---
Maybe it's the killer DC'ing
---
If it's on console it might be fore the same reason people barely play nurse or huntress. It's that the frame rate while using their abilities is terrible
---
y u mad tho
---
The problem is, before event survivor queues on consoles were just bad. Around 10 minutes. But now it takes 30 minutes. I was in SWF yesterday and we played 1 game per hour.
---
i love that drawing it's adorable 
---
Poor Mike
---
Not at all dude. I only support straight relationships. 
---
More than one game hun...
---
Devs said it’s not bannable, but anticheat can react to your program and ban you and they won’t do anything about it. Talking from my experience I know a few ppl who use macro for a long time and never got banned so I would say the chance of getting banned is pretty low
---
getting 6k bp is losing. getting 28k bp is winning
---
When only killing the one survivor who looped the shit out of you by sitting in front of the hook and smacking him until he dies becomes an objective, we’ll talk. 
---
\^ yea i phrased it badly
---
I'm so glad you like it!! &lt;3 
---
&gt; what about his best add-ons?
---
Yeah if you're comparing based on that, then you need to compare against every other Killer with their best add-ons. Tombstone Myers is on that list. Might as well act as if you have an Ebony Mori by default at that point.
---
I play Doctor simply because he gets the most bloodpoints. Deviousness can be difficult to get on any other Killer, Hunting is easy when you can find people to farm it off of, you break a lot of shit and get some free hits so Brutality does well. I get 31900 bloodpoints almost every time I 4k, and max Deviousness even when I don't. 
---
See my other replies for the past nerfs I'm talking about.
---
Suck ass without franks mixtape, so op there’s no point in playing out the game with it 
---
Getting a direct hit with Redhead’s Pinky Finger addon though, that’s pretty satisfying.
---
All they have to do is change some of the totem spots (I'm looking at you, middle of the cornfield) and make it so that the totem ALWAYS spawns near the killer and away from a gen.
---
Yes, because they don't want another Event where its too easy to do Event progress on Killer side. (Hallowed Blight)
---
But it seems they have gone too far in the OTHER direction, now there are too many Survivors and too few Killers in my region.
---
the entity took the survivors
---
You get less event points way more blood points. 
---
"well at least i wear SHOES" -pig
---
thanks i hate it 
---
This is a very tricky case isn't it. I don't think it's a bannable offense though since this can't be replicated consistently. 
---
Lol downvoting regardless of the truth is so mature: i bet that you all think NOED is not an OP perk lmfao
---
On my first survivor game I managed to snag that lamp thing and escape with it. 
---
My reward?
---
ERROR: EAT SHIT LOL
---
Survivors also get points by doing gens, so......
---
So I had a thought while playing him the other day. His power seems kinda weak right? Well what if, when you put a survivor in the Dream World, the last generator worked on by that survivor also goes into the Dream preventing non-survivors from working on it until they wake up their teammate.
---
This would put more emphasis on survivor team play, and slow down the game a bit so that he has more time to get looped into oblivion (I cry every time).
---
Seriously though most complaints I see are about him being too loopable and his chases just taking too long. Plenty of killers are susceptible to looping but that just means they need a way to slow the game down so that their long chases aren't such a hindrance. My change might successfully do that. Might not. Needs playtesting.
---
There are too many folks playing survivor and not enough people playing killer. Part of that is because the event offerings aren’t worth running on killer because the BP gain is comically low compared to any other event in DBD history. 
---
The grind isn't that crazy at least 
---
Too bad i can't buy the cosmetics with bp
---
Agreed. Need more incentive to play killer.
---
Ahhh your one of those gotcha 
---
Nurse's Calling is a great perk because Self-Care is the most-run Survivor perk by far, and also then you are likely to still get someone even if you lose them in a chase. Snap Out of It just has to be done before healing, so it's less viable on Doctor without working on that.
---
&gt; not many players use that perk with doc
---
Because they're playing for fun and/or bloodpoints, or didn't know about the interaction (there's no reason to think it would work). 
---
Feeling of reward you say? What's the reward for playing as Myers? Nothing . He is one of the easiest killers to play as and many people play as him on PS4. There is no clear reason for why people don't play as clown. Most of the people out there want to have easy games and thus choose Myers. 
---
*doesnt get a single hook because noed player*
---
In the case of Huntress, the hatchets just go through the survivors when they do 360s in front of you. It sucks.
---
I like where you're going with this
---
At least tag this NSFW. Some of us browse this sub in public, FFS! 
---
There is not one thing that is NSWF in that image 🤨
---
I am at rank 10 and I need to wait for 10 to get a game. Killer games? I get those in 10 seconds 😑
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ubwbbc9.jpg
---
Because a few people dumb enough to try are really going to skew the imbalance so much that they'd get a bigger bonus in a pool of thousands of players.
---
Wasting exhaustion for one 15% faster vault? That's garbage, man. Should either be 15% always with no exhaustion, or one time 100% faster vault (maybe with invincibility) with exhaustion.
---
If the someone leaves with the vessel first everyone gets the 25+ bonus so 
---
If the survivor loops the killer all game and their team doesn’t do all the gens, why should the killer just get a free kill?
---
What he means is that it's low skill cap low reward, but Myers lets you insta-down people, which is pretty satisfying.
---
Few? What makes you think so?
---
What? Where would you get a free kill in that scenario?
---
4 new chapters a year is awesome, in theory. In practice, with the balance problems in the game and spaghetti code, it just seems like it will lead to disaster after disaster.
---
Because the last survivor has no chance if there are gens left and their teammates sucked and all died 
---
Just wanna say thanks to all the replies!
---
So basically Self Care is trash now, and the Exhaustion perk can be either Dead Hard or Balanced Landing, gotcha. I'll play around with the perks a bit. 
---
Oh, and do the new survivors have any new good/useful perks?
---
"I know adrenaline is *severely* powerful already". Well then what do you expect us to say to you lol. It would also indirectly buff decisive strike.
---
Do you hear our prayers?
---
Then the team sucked and the killer deserves the win... the hatch is way too easy, survivors barely have to do anything to get it open
---
Isn't that how it use to be?
---
The killer already won if he got a 3k
---
It's not really low reward. I feel it very rewarding to anti loop with the bottles. But I get it somewhat. Anti looping with clown is not exactly the best skill out there. It's easy. But so is Myers.
---
But why should a killer be limited to that, if a team isn’t good enough to escape no one should escape 
---
They finally fixed the no network connection error on ps4 
---
I dont grab a lantern til last gen is completed.
---
Thank you so much!! 
---
Hats off to anyone who reads all that 😂
---
Unlucky this time friend! Maybe we'll run into each other in the fog soon! 
---
What would be the killer counter to this? Exposed effect for adrenaline users? Built in rancor for adrenaline users? Adrenaline is fine now as frustrating as it can be its a great counter to end game camping.
---
Then they should change mechanics do killers can’t camp, why should a bad killer get a kill when they can only get one down the entire game? If the survivor got the hatch the deserved to escape because you didn’t stop them from getting it. 
---
I stopped playing when Moira came out, did they keep killing DVA's shield?
---
I can't believe that actually exists, what the fuck. 
---
I didnt even get to read it yet and im already afraid just based from this comment
---
Appreciate the thoughts
---
I just gen focused and I was getting plenty points no matter what. 
---
Well what perks do you have.The best perks are teachables.An ideal immersed survivor build is dance with me(kate) lithe(feng) and urban evasion (nea) and at last iron will(jake).This allows you to get away from the killer more often than not after jumping a window.However if you are a confident survivor in a chase I recommend self care(claudette) balanced landing(nea) bond or empathy(dwight or claudette) and adrenaline (meg).Its a very tedious process to get a good build.However both these perks are completely useless.Spine chill activates when you are hearing the heartbeat so useless and premonition has a cooldown.Best non teachable perks as a survivor are kindred(kinda guarantees you are getting rescued) small game(counter to noed) and resilience(boost to actions when injured).Survivor builds are very different depending on the playstile.
---
You have it all wrong. You can use coins OR Auric Cells. So gameplay or cash.
---
I didn't hook anyone while I was doing it! But I'm glad you got some points out of it! I just followed folks around, and enticed them to follow me! Haha. 
---
The worst I did was knock people down when I had NoED. It would be so cute, because they'd all panic, but then I'd pick up someone and let them wiggle off. 
---
Well, the same counter as Decisive users. Enduring or something. But I see where you're coming from. 
---
Unsure honestly.
---
At this point it's more a lingering reputation from like 2017. It can still get pretty bad, but the community's come a ways since the worst days.
---
XD let me know if you agree 
---
fucking christ
---
Straight lines.
---
If a survivor gets caught that’s their own fault what the killer does with them afterwards is fair game, if a killer is stupid enough to hook camp then the survivors should be smart enough to do generators instead of rushing hooks. It could actually work to the survivors advantage
---
Yay lets add something with 0 counterplay to replace something pretty well balanced
---
1. No "h"
---
2. 4 "o"s
---
Conclusion: you are a worthless human being, please do not talk to me ever again
---
Im telling you a fact survivors could get a full vial in 3 mins and leave the game, for a killer to get a full vial 4 envelopes had to be burned, then they 6 hooks spread across all the map hoping they didnt get dstriked by baby ds en route.  Most games take about 15 mins to complete.  Survivors finished days early rhen killers so jumped to killer queue which warped the killer queue.  You have zero conception off what happened, wah wah killer op wah, remember every 10 seconds to carry survivor to a specific hook is 30 seconds free time for 3 other survivor to do what ever,  you wqarped sense of reality.
---
I played them last night so I must be good at dream-gaming then
---
This is like a nature documentary.
---
DAMN, as a Huntress main I weep for that post-game convo...can hear aimbot accusations already
---
I appreciate randomly kind killers. Had a Huntress literally give me my lantern yesterday. I think I’ll have to pay this goodness forward! 
---
Not really. Unless the killer is trash you can’t not get caught as survivor, there are no more real infinites, no matter how well you loop the killer will eventually down you. 
---
I'm just starting to play her on console now and oh boy. It's awful. I had heard about how huge the hatchet hit boxes are but my hatchets seem to be as thin as paper.
---
You have 0 clue, survivors like you make me sick
---
Caught in a bear trap...
---
Darth plagiarism the unwise
---
I never expected the devs to make ace a daddy when they introduced the store but here we are 
---
Just drop out and put experienced killer on your resume instead. Give you about the same chance as getting a job as post secondary education.
---
Its actually easier to rack up points as survivor than killer.
---
The killer scoring is abyssmal compared to what you get as survivor. 
---
When they say flicked, it brings to mind the thing I hate where, for just a split second, you have complete control over your turn. Ive ran into so many walls by revving and expecting a slow turn.
---
started this game with premonition and later spine chill.
---
Premonition helps to identify the direction just before the heartbeat. This allows you enough time to walk away without being noticed. Cooldown is the downside.
---
Spine Chill give you a slight boost in doing those gens that is just about to be completed in the case the killer is heading over to your direction. Downside is you need to keep looking out for the killer.
---
When you are used to how the killer move about the map, both are kinda dead useless.
---
Yup. A perfect score as Killer requires 5 event offerings to be played. It requires you to 4k and break every lantern. You get 45 points. A perfect score as Survivor doesn't require any offerings to be used. It requires 5 gens to be completed and you need to escape carrying a lantern. You get 45 points. Survivor is a fuckton easier to grind out.
---
Wait, they're nerfing the Doctor? Since when and why? I would put him around the bottom of the mid-tiers. The only thing he's good at is finding Survivors at the start of the match. He's terrible at stopping loops. Putting them into Madness 3 doesn't waste very much of their time. Yeah, you can track them but he's still mediocre af. 
---
Everything the Doctor does other Killers do better: Clown can stop loops about as effectively and isn't slowed down while using his power, plus Clown has that GDLK add-on that counters Exhaustion perks and with Enduring can counter DS (Obsession only and if they're not near a pallet or window). Freddy can track, can sneak up on them, and his power can force them to waste some time and can lead you to more Survivors. 
---
This is what he was saying. "if a killer is camping do gens and escape while he is doing it. he will get one kill but you will get to escape if you make them relies it doesn't get them many kills then they might stop doing it. there is no true counter to T-bagging and all it does is make the killer angry." did that clear up what jay is saying?
---
I've escaped several times without a vessel and still got the 25 points tho
---
Do you still respond every time I pay you attention, or have you moved your stupidity to someone else?
---
If you’re over twelve you should be seriously ashamed of yourself. You care more about rank than I do, which is fine, but you seem to have forgotten that literally the games objective is so gens and escape. 
---
I’m going to ignore you for a few days now, buddy. If I get bored and want to watch you dance I’ll be back, though. 
---
Lol
---
Use the template correctly!!!
---
Meanwhile my classes will start only at feb 18.
---
My boy ace about to transcend the entity's realm and shit
---
I am most positive it's live and that they are prioritizing region.
---
I played for a couple months before the update. I would rarely see the same person twice in a row. Last night I played 3 straight matches with a random, that never happened before. Regular time, same rank, etc.
---
That applies for killers too. I rarely got the same killer twice, now it's like every other or 2 or 3 games I will see a killer I just played against.
---
Furthermore, IDK if I ever saw a sub-100 ping before the update. When it went live, I had quite a few 30-100 ping games and majority were yellow instead of red 80% of the time pre-patch.
---
So eloquently put. 
---
If my boss saw this over my shoulder, would he approve? If no, NSFW. 
---
That would make sense but you can use the coins from either killer OR survivor to buy any of the cosmetics.
---
Ok, so now you’re just resorting to name calling instead of an actual argument. I have complete conception of what happened, considering the fact that I finished both sides vials before they changed it so you didn’t need to finish both sides, and I can tell you killer was infinitely less stressful. As survivor, I barely ever won since everyone was too concerned with getting their vials. As killer, it made it much easier to 4K, and the suicides you’re talking about rarely ever happened. Anyway, thanks for assuming I’m a survivor main when I play both 50/50. Are you serious that someone having a different opinion than you makes you *sick*? It’s a fucking game, man. Calm down. Done with this argument as you clearly would rather resort to mocking and name calling.

---
I don't know why the artist didn't include Hag, Spirit, and Pig. :/
---
Agreed. I don't know what I was thinking. I'd likely go with the second option, considering one of the perks is already a constant 15% speed increase.
---
Ya, que times are REALLY bad this morning as survivor
---
And to make it even more fun the killer will probably dodge the lobby that you waited 20 minutes to join, so fun!
---
It's an obsession perk, but not a Myers perk.
---
The aim is to distract the killer long enough for the other survivors to get the generators done, this is a horror game, when was the last time you watched a horror movie where all the survivors escaped and no one died? If the team is good enough at least someone should be able to escape without the hatch, the hatch is a cop out
---
Which means if you really want to get the coins you can just play survivor 
---
Obviously there could be more to it and could add some sort of defense for the killers. As simple as an offering that defends them from it. 
---
It's a shame, Clown is my favorite to play :(
---
Ngl. 
---
I'd rather you get out, since you leaving before I die gets me 45 points.
---
I saw one earlier
---
Give us eyes.
---
I found it!! Thx
---
This isn’t a horror game though, it’s a slasher themed action game. The hatch isn’t a cop out and if you play well enough to deserve a 4K you’ll get it regardless of the hatch. 
---
Just email the devs bro

To be fair, calm spirit isn’t really worth running even with the buffs because you might not run into a doctor or a clown that much, especially in higher ranks (though with the new spies from the shadows buff, maybe more people might run it, though I doubt it). But yes, the other nerfs are pretty painful as someone who loved playing doctor.

All I wanted out of this post was to get more ideas for different event items.

Amanda needs a skin :(

They said to close the hatch?

WHO said to close the hatch?

That feature never made it out of PTB.

It’s fun knowing you’re tilted 
---
Your solution is only a killer buff. 
---
No thanks. 
---
You're going the wrong way. Adrenaline shouldn't proc at all if you're on the Killer's shoulder or on a hook.
---
Told you guys, i walked on your faces already, too ezpz points, how can killer mains even compete?
---
Did you get hit too?
---
I’ll okay I’m on Xbox 
---
See, lately there have been a LOT of people saying that, yeah? It's not even close to being underused anymore.
---
Sometimes the best mind games are no mind games at all. 
---
Yeah, they even said as much. But it's just gone the other way because Survivor is super easy to score this time.
---
Exams in January? The semester should only just be starting. 
---
Ehhhhhhhhhh
---
Still survivors gets about double the amount of points a killer gets for the same effort.
---
I usually play killer but for this event i'm going survivor since the point gain is abyssmal as killer.
---
Why 
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeees ✋🏼👌🏼
---
DBD is an asymmetrical survival horror game, that’s its official description. You could be the best killer in the community and you the hatch could still fuck you over, it is a cop out because it’s a free escape for the survivor, it’s points they didn’t earn 
---
survivor mains tend to not understand the game well and complain about literally everything, and for some godforsaken reason BHVR listens to them. It's awful
---
I like swamp\~
---
Don't browse reddit at work?
---
NSFW means not safe for work. 
---
You made a statement saying it was easy for killer in the blight event to get vials and I'm asking you why survivors finished they side days before killer and so jumped ship to get the huntress out fit.  It eaveraged about 2 killer games to get a full vial.  If only 3 envelopes got burned we could only get 5/6 of a vial and so we had to play another full game to get the vial.  I have a really strong disagreement with your views.  Your right about killer games itrs so stress free at rank 1 I'm always just chilling, hitting all those skill checks with survivor is stressful af
---
Well lery’s does suck
---
I can hear the bingbong from here.
---
I would never go to school again
---
The only horror element this game has is a killer and loud music, and they earned the points by finishing the hatch before you even though it’s much easier to find it first as killer. 
---
Obviously.
---
Yes. They made the hit box really good. This is how it should be on PC. But considering that it's on PS4, I feel that it should be made slightly bigger.
---
I'm going to start this this a cliche but true statement.  I used to play Killer pretty much 90 percent and survivor 10 percent.  That has changed over time to mostly 50\50.  Teabagging a killer has literally NO effect on gameplay except for the fact that you might hurt the killers feelings.  I think that most killers feel humiliated by survivors when they are getting ran around and teabagged at every pallet.  IMO it's just BM and there is nothing wrong with doing it,  as long as you don't cry and complain when you get caught and the killer does everything in his power to end your game. Camping,  I absolutely hate to say it,  is a part of the game that will never leave.  To me most* camping is also BM,  but at the same time it is furthering your goal of getting kills.  If the last gen pops, and doors are opened, I feel the killer is justified to stay close to the hook and possibly bait other people to come in for the possibility of even more kills.  I'm not talking face camping. Teabagging is BM and has absolutely nothing to do with furthering your objectives. Camping is also BM but it does get you possibly closer to your goal.  I'm not an advocate for either and I think they are both stupid but this is just how I see it.  I LOVE BOTH SIDES. zubUwu. 
---
So, if it's not safe in the workplace, where your boss is, then it's NSFW. 
---
"Micheal is impressed"
---
*bruh*
---
As a killer main I don't actually mind adrenaline all that much, the only time I actually got mad at adrenaline was on the game map I was playing as legion against a swf and they were all injured and then the last gen popped and they all had adrenaline, other than that I don't think it's a big problem
---
I love how much you valued the pancakes. Priorities.
---
/u/jambo973
---
As well as the event, survivors are able to earn more points than killers if they play their cards right
---
It is definitely just you. Also why the random /s in the middle of words
---
Thank you my dude, appreciate it. I’ll also look forward to that subreddit.
---
At the end of the day it's a game, we can do anything in the game that can be done. I'd beg to differ saying it wasn't well deserved lol. 
---
This used to be commonplace.
---
FOURTY EIGHT!
---
Mandatory 165 vs 164db comment
---
No I camp people who run through every single pallet in the fucking map and teabag at it too
---
I was actually the one that got hatcheted while running to the lamp, my friend cleaning the totem got away while I got hooked 
---
Yea, insta-down hatchets would be broken. Could you *imagine . . .*
---
Oh well, I don‘t them 
---
Finally! Now i can play Killer and insta find survivors.
---
I agree. And yes another ds but it could also get the killer another survivor on the ground if they have to be injured and have to be that close
---
Don't worry, half of my time goes into finding a lobby. 
---
Man, y'all making me wanna leave work and make pancakes.
---
That's honestly a big reason why me and my crew just dropped the game. Takes too long to find a game, but then when you get a damn game, it's 1/3 chance that the killer will have a shitty connection or just leave. If they don't then a survivor usually disconnects, and that's if one of us don't get disconnected. The game's real shitty on console.
---
He's alright especially with the right addons
---
fuck legion
---
Whenever the Wraith uses Sloppy Butcher, everytime a survivor gets hit, the blood never stops spewing out. It'll eventually look like a blood fountain if he keeps hitting them over and over and I think it's a funny bug.
---
This is super irritating, fortunately I've just prestiged my Kate, so Blood Webs are small but one Feng it's so annoying... And when I burn it I usually get killed by loading screen, somebody dcs in the begining of a trial, killer camps me or it's omega blink God nurse with 6th sense

Mine runs fine ?

Nobody wants to play killer on console right now. I wonder why?
---
I need more incentive to play survivor, killer gets guaranteed 40k bp with BBQ and survivor gets like possibly 30k with wglf
---
haha yea
---
Lol!  This exact scenario happened at rank 1 at Lerys to me too.  I was playing trapper and with 4 gens p3 Claudette refused to touch a gen.  7 minutes in she would toss a pebble with diversion to troll.  She did this twice.  After 10 minutes I randomly saw movement nowhere near a gen.  Naturally I responded by slugging her, camping her corpse and hooking her on her last possible frame of bleed out.  I can waste time and bm too.
---
I think you mean Señor Smith. 
---
Bait is a cool idea, but the other two seem pretty weak. Pharmacy does what insatiable would do, but way better. 
---
Meanwhile a survivor can afk in a locker and get 20 event points.
---
bruh moment
---
Break this, BITCH!
---
"All of the other events have been 'killer biased' so let's make it so killers don't earn shit!" Sure, that's totally fair. Have you played all of the events? Because the *only* one that shafted survivors was Hallowed Blight. Every other event was survivors (and killers) completed event hooks or generators. Enjoy your long ass survivor queues. Because most killers are either playing survivor or have dropped the game entirely for Kingdom Hearts.
---
They do like booping the snoot!!
---
They need to make more incentive to play killer!!!!! The games are way to short, especially 5 minutes gates in high ranks
---
Says the killer who can’t 4K when bad hit boxes and nerfs have made survivors weak as fuck. Maybe get good and the hatch won’t be an issue :)
---
Piggies are good friends! 
---
That's interesting. By the way they define holding the game hostage it shouldn't be bannable. Please keep me updated on whether that individual actually gets banned or not. If this is bannable then so would hostage doctor.
---
I'll make my own ticket and ask directly whether both scenarios are bannable. If they are, that's a good thing.
---
So they cant use the Event offering for the duration of the event?
---
You realize how silly it is?
---
5 minutes gates, being the survivors gen rushing the hell out of killers. I’ve done it and I’ve had it done. Ruin shouldn’t have to be a crutch 😂
---
I'm pretty new to DBD, so I didn't even know Pharmacy was a thing. Feel pretty stupid now. Thanks for the feedback though!
---
Yeah I tried that. I was really hoping it would fix it but I still have 0 points. Fingers crossed i can gain new points in a match now that I restarted it. 
---
100% this
---
Yes, that is possible, but this comes at the cost of fun for the killer as it’s essentially a pallet stun to drop a survivor without the actual need for a pallet or the timing to get the stun. Most survivors would not use it while injured for the same reason you just used, being that it would make them likely to get downed. It’s a neat concept but with the game the way it is, maybe that could be what DS is changed to, instead of something in addition to the current DS we have!
---
Yeah that screenshot was from my nurse.

Thanks to no ultra rare addons.

Doc is annoying particularly that 3 gen build people do. Still hes not very good his base shock is pathetic
---
I’m a little uncomfortable with the hips on both of these two c
---
Between lags, frame drops and piss poor control i only play for occasional lazy couch play. It's not very fun on PS4 and there are better games I could play on it. (Also fog and brightness is worse on PS4. Dunno if it's just me but can't see claudette, even megs sometimes)
---
On pc..it's different game altogether
---
holy shit this is hilarious I'm actually dying lmao
---
Get your first hook as soon as possible. As awful as it sounds, if they’re doing gens super quickly just tunnel the first person you hook. Get someone out of the game as quickly as possible. 
---
Also don’t spend too long in a chase and focus on gens, leaving out gens that are far away. You want to make the final 1-3 gens be in the easiest possible loop for you to patrol
---
Your artwork is amazing!
---
LEGIOOON!
---
I counter your Urban Evasion with my Doctor with Iridescent King.
---
Reddit ain't safe for work
---
What killer? Perks? 
---
Gens go fast until the killer gets map pressure by hooking someone. A few gebs will get done during the first chase but after this it depends
---
Open your eyes...
---
No one wants to play killer with how poorly optimized the game is + it being far faster to get event points as survivor. Queue a killer game real quick and see how fast your lobby fills.
---
Devs are stupid as fuck. They are just encouraging toxic behavior. They should add a mechanic to punish campers while also helping the guy who is getting camped.
---
If "unfun for survivors" was a bannable offense, there would be no killers left because everything is unfun to survivors. You're a fucking genius.
---
You are everything that's wrong with this game o/
---
camping is easily counterable by doing gens? thats great that my teammates get to sit there and hold m1 all game instead of anyone having any fun because a player like you is salty i crouched. reddit killer mains are such children lmfao
---
*Explodes*
---
the support said what they said. i didn't edit anything. 
---
besides, some reddit user in my other post said people were, in fact, banned for this kind of behavior not even once. 
---
Its a lot easier for killers to get there scoring event as such they get less. The balance isnt too bad overall, coins are shared between both sides this time anyway
---
I see 8 killers but also see Ginyu poses
---
A variation of this could exist, but this by itself seems not very likely to be done
---
I used to swear by Premoniton, but Spinechill increases your repair speed so it actually helps in this situation when you are just to determined to finish the genny.
---
Disagree, Ace is fire!
---
There*
---
Event
---
I hate that I have to tunnel to stand a chance of winning. It sucks for the survivors and they usually borrowed time out of the door anyway. I wish there was a more fun way to do it.
---
many thanks, friend :)
---
PSA:  Discouraging people from posting makes you look like an asshole.   
---
I just wish I could zap someone as doc and not have them vault the window like nothing happened.
---
You can't truly afk without getting crows. You still have to be present in the game. It's a complete waste and I doubt anyone is actually doing that.
---
Hang in there! I'm sure things will turn around for you!
---
It’s actually a glitch, easy to execute to
---
Just before a match, press the run and action buttons for three seconds
---
Then tap quickly the “struggle button”
---
Then let a member of behaviour fuck your asshole dry 
---
Then you wanna ALMOST quit the game but don’t 
---
At the end of the match you should have a multiplier
---
Hope this helps 
---
Not like it was the same last event where you also needed at least 4 offerings to get enough hooks to completely fill a phile in one game. Seems bhvr really learned from past events...
---
Honestly Feng imo had the only good stuff. Ace looks more like a hipster than a wise man and the huntress sort of looks like one of her green/purple skins that are normally in the store. :(
---
Huntress is free...
---
I hope you die on first hook.
---
The frustration comes from new survivors that are over reliant on stealth. In other words, people that don't matter.
---
Usually pig, bamboozle, ruin, enduring, and bbq. They have enough perks, pallets, and windows too easily take all 5 gens and I don’t feel like there’s much I can do about it.
---
Haven’t played a game as killer where all survivors play and don’t d/c.  Worst event as a killer.  Even just the double blood points event was more enjoyable.
---
No mither, self care, object of obsession, price thyself. Best perk combo in the game as there is a glitch that makes it to where you can heal yourself from the injured state instantly using prove thyself.
---
Doesn’t look like anyone knows how to spot a joke 
---
I understand why they are less and all, but with the variability of points decreasing based on the survivors teammates not unhooking, or not burning offerings. It’s just way easier for survivors to get more points as they just need to exist for the generators, they don’t have to actually do them. 
---
This makes queues for survivor suck since everyone will play more survivor.
---
That response is basically saying they arent going to ban people apart from if they are 100% sure they are trolling. There is no way to prove that
---
Technically he’s not killing anyone in the first movie, it’s just a nightmare from beginning to end. He’s not real
---
Another way if they really don't understand(usually in a 1v1 or 1v2 scenario) is to intentionally down them and show them you're not trying to kill them by carrying them to a hook, then carrying them somewhere else like a pallet for them to wiggle off of and use to farm points. Even the really thickheaded people get the point by then lol.
---
I mean Feng and Ace, i wrote "Survivors"
---
Oops &gt;.&lt;
---
Killer: dribbles Survivor: I hope you ... you... Learn to play without ruin and BBQ Tryhard. Of course only toxic fucks behave like that but it makes me smile every time.
---
If you get stung in the face, have an allergic reaction and puff up like fuck with snot running down your face and some nurse calls you handsome do you think shes being nice? well shes complimenting you! At best its belittleling. It always depends on the situation. A killer gets looped and flashlight stunned by a swf group for a whole game, the last survivor hides in a locker for an additional 10 min, killer gets 0 kills and 5k points, and the survivors all write gg. Survivors being nice?
---
Don’t forget about the Halloween theme on haddonfield after patch 2.5.0.
---
Especially with the event breaking bug not allowing people to get points for games when the event launched. Like it could be a server side issue, but don’t they have a development build PTB to test these network issues on???
---
Quite annoying the constant salt directed towards the small team of BHVR that works on this game. Dbd is not the companies only project, and it's sad to see the consistent hate and discouragement directed towards the team. Can't imagine how everyone at BHVR feels when they read posts with nothing but comments saying they're incompetent and how everybody has redditor has magic solutions that would fix the game and appease everybody. Not to mention this game is undoublty better than it was when it first released or even a year after it did. Give people a hand and they'll take your whole arm. 
---
Lol to everyone downvoting my “that’s racist” comment. Clearly I was being silly. “Are you new to dbd?” 😂😂😂😂😂 thinking I’m all serious n shit y’all funny
---
Is this a LARP?
---
Mori time 😈
---
I mean you dont need the offerings much for this event. They help but the gens and hooks give a good passive effect over time
---
I choose to believe that Sally is staring dreamily at Anna. 
---
She's a really easy killer to be wholesome on! I can go from a 4k on the Spirit, switch to her, and be a smol cinnamon roll piggy. 
---
ok
---
52 minutes, and even that lobby was crashed in the loading screen so we didn't technically play a round.
---
I didn’t gild myself. Some random guy did. Pretty sure you can’t gild yourself anyway.
---
That's fair! Everyone does events their own way. I just enjoy being kind to others after I've gotten my stuff for the event. ^^
---
Oof, apparently I am stupid. Or your sarcasm is pretty good because I totally ate your bait there and thought you really think like that. 
---
Imo, even DS and NOED aren't toxic, they are just OP. A perk can't be toxic and 
---
Or Freddy
---
A good survivor aways wear 4 layers of jackets to avoid the slashing
---
I’m not saying earning points as killer is hard or anything, just that being as efficient as possible means survivors don’t require anything in order to achieve the maximum of 45 points. While the killer requires that all 5 players burn an event offering.
---
Ruin spawns suck. By the time I down the third person the game is usually almost over. The chases aren’t even that long either.
---
Don't tell Meg i said this, but feng be looking like a snack 😭🍑

Darn

I’m actually trying that right now

Yep.... Have fun

its a bug anyway, but maybe their character has to be removed from the map before you get the lantern points regardless of actually having one?
---
wanna be a real toxic killer 
---
destroy all but 1 lamp and stand in front of the last 1 pop open netflix and relax. you should have enough points to not care if they all leave by now.
---
MUAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Oh my god, that is cute as fuck. Especially the ginyu pose
---
lmfao I have about a dozen of my own ass pics. if i wanted to look at a real ass, id look at my own. if *you* want to look at a real ass, you'd probably have to go to pornhub. tragic
---
Knowing bhvr,I highly doubt they'll buff Doc,I mean look at Freddy and the brain dead killer that is Legion.
---
That's so sad. I'm sorry that happened to you all. I've had a bunch of lobbies crash on me recently, in the load. Whether I'm killing or surviving, it doesn't matter.
---
That's so frustrating that it happened to your only match.
---
I love Pig and it sucks not being able to play her. I always get yelled at for using NOED and it makes me feel bad so I try not to use it, but that’s the only way to be a threat. I get gen rushed with every killer though. Hillbilly is the only one who stands a chance but I hate playing him all the time.
---
Bubba cries in the basement 
---
I can't play for the rest of today because I have to work, but there might just be a kind Piggy later this evening! -and who knows, maybe other people have seen this post and want to join in the fun! 
---
please behvr dont eat my ass 
---
hahahaha
---
If you like good booty, you should be playing more often as Kate. Hers is thick as fuck 😥
---
Queue up as killer. Game starts. Count to 10. 3 gens done. Queue up as survivor. Chased around the map twice. 0 gens done. 
---
I play survivor as well. It’s not hard to end the game before killer gets one hook.
---
Says sorry and gives bowl of bbq n chili
---
Well. Played.
---
Can they fix the bit where I crash every second game in the loading screen? It is literally at the point where I don't bring an offering every second game because I know that I will lose it.
---
its weird though because all of them look hella flat but once they bend over they're thicc as fuck

So basically....
---
"Oh shit, you're right, eh? Well then, thanks for telling us this! Cya, crybaby."
---
Maybe this idea isn't too great but tbh summer BBQ was crap. Nothing new to a game, still m1 simulator for survivors and normal hooking for killers.   
---
What I don't like about this event is the fact you can actually get crap with survivor. I keep running into tunneling omega blink nurses who find me straight away and wouldn't leave till I'm dead whenever I burn a red envelope... They should split those points you earn somehow... (you get points for keeping a vessel for certain amount of time or something)
---
&gt;When I try to zap them in a chase, they just get another loop out of the pallet and/or know how to dodge the beam.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;at the end of the day, **his Treatment Mode can't kill anyone**. 
---
You're doing something wrong then, perfect timing on his shocks mean very short chases.
---
In any case as someone who mained Doc for a while I wish they reworked his elctrode addons and buffed a bit the base shock to promote the active gameplay that makes him good but nobody seems to understand.

---
I think the ranking system is fine. Everyone in the game can pip if they play correctly. Changing it would make the game zero sum where one party can pip and the other de-pips.
---
That being said, some rank 1 killers are doorknobs. 
---
Agreed
---
See, I've tried that. I've also tried carrying them to a hook, shaking "no," then not moving at all so they wiggle out.
---
They still flee in a mad panic. XD
---
Doesn't really matter if you mori survivors cuz if you mori them, you get less points :P
---
It's a boot. 
---
“I would like to know what the fucking thought process was behind this event”
---
He can still put them back to sleep. Adrenaline is fine the way it is . They just need to remove the wake up from self care that is all. 
---
As a survivor it's not that bad if you manage to keep the vessel for a long time. As a killer, though, I could barely feel the difference.
---
Think DM has stayed at 2 seconds with an 8 second cool down. She’s still considered a weaker tank, but I’ve heard my friends who still play say they’d prefer her missiles get buffed so they actually feel dangerous.
---
This is so adorable thank you for it! I also love how you drew their expression even with the hood Nurse is very expressive! 
---
I’m have no problem playing normally I’m just teaching them a lesson and bringing justice for other who suffer through what they do
---
Just found out that you get 5k bloodpoints if you manage to escape with the vessel.
---
Regardless, still pathetic compared to previous events and as someone who prefers playing killer this just makes me even sadder.
---
Ah, I'm trying to play mostly survivor, the queue times are beyond painful. Guess I'm a killer main untilk the 14th
---
Please no, my PTSD would flair up every game
---
I want this to be made into a short sped up black&amp;white noir style clip 🎥 
---
The same people who will tell you to kill yourself, tea bag at the exit, body block, and flashlight blind you are going to say something whether you use NOED and get 4 kills, or don’t and get 0. They’re toxic. It took me awhile to realize that but  just play how you want. 
---
I hope so! Every time there's an event, every match is a complete mess haha!
---
I don’t buy any cosmetics for survivors, unfortunately, because I tend to play immersed and stealthy, (I can still loop when I need to) and so my go-to cosmetics are really just a bloodstained Claudette xD
---
Sounds slightly better than my normal SWF experience post midnight. 
---
If they add any more incentive to play survivor right now I think we’ll have hour long survivor queue times 
---
I like the way traps encourage gen stalling honestly, it's one of the few ways the killer can dictate the pace of the game.
---
I've had this happen before and they said they were going to report me for hacking. XD I always wonder how some killers don't know this yet.
---
do you get shit from other games for being a girl. i feel like people go out of their way to talk to them in most gaming circles because "gamer girls"
---
Yay!! I'm so excited to hear this! 
---
I dont run ruin on pig since she has built in ruin with her traps anyway. 
---
And noed is a big middle finger for survivors who played really well lol. Imagine doing all 5 gens with no deaths or few hooks, only to get bopped at the very end and having the killer secure 1 maybe 2 or more kills depending on how altruistic the survivors are.  
---
Well. First set costs you 600 points. Second set costs you 1500 points, third set 2400. Its not a bit more. But if you play as survivor it shouldn't be that difficult to do to be honest. Only if you play as killer you have to work your ass off.
---
I escaped with a vessel and didn't get hooked once, but I only got 8 points?? Is this a bug? (PC)
---
Lol, that would be great!
---
Yes, matchmaking isn't great to put it lightly, arguing against that would be pretty stupid.
---
But my points were that
---
A) matchmaking issues are a completely seperate topic and have nothing to do with how the event is designed
---
B) having bloody clothes neither being an indicator of skill, nor granting any ingame advantages (P3 claudette memes aside)

Are you spending too much time crouching?  Pig moves too slow when she's doing that and can't reliably pressure the gens if her ability is used too much 
---
Also as for bamboozle I would recommend replacing with save the best for last.  That perk helps you in two ways.  The tokens make your recovery post attack do fast you can often get right back on their ass and down them before they can make the next safety spot.  Also it encourages you to completely ignore the obsession which we all know wants to be chased with their decisive crutch and often leads to a hard loss if tunneled anyway.  I only go for obsession when it makes sense typically after I've already killed some of her teammates.  
---
You're not wrong! It's rough! But, hopefully we can all get our things with a little friendly cooperation. ;3 
---
If the killer finds the hatch they should be able to close it, survivors that are bad don't deserve to escape unless the game starts with 3 or less survivors then the game should just kick everyone to the lobby with no penalty.
---
i mean, the countdown stops in a chase
---
Maybe sprit fury as you have enduring. Other than that whispers maybe or sloppy butcher or remember me/noed if you struggle that much with map pressure
---
or i think that's what it does
---
It would be great if everyone trying to derank would just play the full game and dc at the end. It's called not being an inconsiderate shit bag.
---
yikes. this is too accurate. 50% of my brain is like 'giiirrrl get yoself ready for that oral clinical exam' and the other 50% grow into 100% and make wraith snoring sounds I don't know where this is going 
---
oof, id report that
---
Haha I might! The killers are so fun to draw
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it! :)
---
only seems bad if you're trying to get every single item from what you're saying.
---
yeah ive met a shitton of women
---
I’m on right now
---
Yeah, but they aren’t all like that. I just wish everyone could have fun and still have a fair game. If I see that they are toxic I do what I need to do but if they aren’t I just feel bad.
---
yeah but the killer wont pip and depending on how good the survivors play they will pip, and thats all that matters
---
2 teams each with prove thyself and brand new parts on a god tier toolbox? Add resilliance and the injured state too? That HAS to be not much more than 30 seconds if at all.
---
Trapper is shit hes so slow setting up his power.
---
Wraith isnt great but zero terror radius often gives you a free hit
---
Kinda true. I don't want the killer skin. Its lame.
---
GOOD LUCK!
---
Idk who to 
---
I’ll try that. What would you recommend in its place?
---
Damn thought I was on r/comedycemetery  for a second
---
Yeah but that’s the fastest way. It’s not like that would even come close to happening every game. This guy/girl said it always gets done literally in 30 seconds 
---
Object of Obsession
---
I've never understood people who target harass females in games. I'll flame people if they are shit, I don't care if they have a weiner or a vageener though.
---
I rarely crouch unless it’s too mindgame a pallet. She’s way too slow. Thanks, I’ll give that a try.
---
Playing solo isn’t as much of a wait though 
---
It exists to keep the game going and be resolved rather than the survivor just hide, it also gives survivors who have done well enough to power a few gens a chance to escape. Also youve won please dont be one of those killers who think only a 4k is a win. 
---
this person needs a calming chamomile tea real fast.
---
Good list for a beginner but I would put Hag over Trapper, Wraith over Cannibal, and Clown over Shape.
---
"*60% of the time it works every time*"
---
Nope, uncap away!
---
Yes BHVR mods this post right here.
---
That’s not true. If the killers really bad, you get all the gens done quick and don’t get into any chases and leave you will certainly not pip. You’ll maybe safety pip. If there’s no one to save off hooks and you got into no chases, you won’t earn any of those 2 emblems. You’ll get iridescent for not going down and maybe a silver for gens. 
---
Sloppy personally. But really it depends pig isnt the best killer in the world to begin with but she isnt bad
---
Huntress is too low, clown is too high
---
Trapper is wayyy too high. He is pretty bad in his current state, and he's not easy to play effectively 
---
Can't relate wtf. I can never find a lobby when i play as killer, but as soon as i click join lobby with survivor i get thrown in. (PC)
---
Something
---
Oof.
---
Still wouldnt be fair but acceptable.
---
Mostly a consequence of the event.  Best way for survivors to earn event coins is to gen rush. So all of the toolbox addons earned during the christmas event are being used now. Event has brought out the swf teams in full coordinated force.  While before they may have screwed around with unhooks or trolling, the event focuses them to bring their purple toolboxes/addons and complete generators as their top priority.  With the insane amount of grind needed to earn the cosmetics, expect to be rushed for the next two weeks at least.
---
select the message you wanna report and press options and then click report.
---
A) True. Matchmaking has nothing to do with event specifically. Its same with event or without it. But its bad.
---
B) True again. Not necessarily indicator of skill but more often than not at least experience. But I suppose experience doesn't matter if you never learn.
---
To be fair, this game is much harder for survivors when they enter the game. New players have no idea whats going on, they don't have perks and there is little time to learn in every match if you die as soon as killer finds you, which is always. If you put survivor without perks against killer without perks, I think killer is quite a bit stronger by default.
---
sure, but the games a team game and if there’s more than 0 gens left not repaired when the 2nd to last survivor dies the game becomes impossible for the survivor no matter how good they are. it’s stupid to have no chance to win whatsoever just because your teammate suicided on first hook and i assure you the amount of people that go immersed claudette and don’t touch any gens for 15 minutes until the killer dcs or finds them will skyrocket to 40-80% of games the moment you enable closing the hatch. 
---
This is basically it.
---
I had a match today, and I was fortunate enough to find the survivor before they found the hatch. I was able to herd them away from it and down them, securing the 4k. In the end game lobby, this survivor told me that they earned the hatch.
---
I will not debate that they played very well, I lost them a few times in chase and after looking at the scores, agree that they did most of the work. However, you don't earn the hatch until you escape through it. The mechanic is already a "get out of fog free card."
---
Also, I am a rank 12 killer currently (call me a noob, whatever I rank 1 survivor every season because it is almost impossible not to.) and this individual was rank 4, with a rank 1, rank 20 and rank 18 teammate. So...
---
hold on, let me put on my serious hat
---
There are basically two sides to being a female gamer. You either get a ton of toxicity thrown at you, or you get a lot of creepy men follow you around.
---
In video games that require/have voice chat, it is obviously much worse. I do not personally use my mic a lot in games like that, because I'm afraid of the outcome. I'd say maybe 60% of the times I have used voice chat, I have received a sexist remark.
---
In games where there is only text chat, such as League of Legends back in the day, they wont know you're a girl unless it's somehow obvious. Like your name, who you're playing, skins, etc. The toxicity in that game would be the worst but it did not happen very often due to me not "seeming like a girl".
---
The thing about creepy people usually only happens in gaming Discord servers. A ton of people join vc the second I do, I get a lot of messages, a lot of people wanting me to play with them, even people buying me stuff. 
---
I don't dislike attention, but this type of attention is uncomfortable because I know it is only happening because I'm a girl. They're here because they're not used to being around girls. I also get a lot of friend requests or messages from people once they realize I'm a girl
---
I have it fairly easy though since I don't really use voice chat
---
Hey claud. What were you up to :D
---
Oh my god! You have a full battery wtf
---
I’ve been trying to get spirit fury 3 but the game won’t allow it. I’ve heard it works really well, though.
---
Atleast clown got in this one.
---
no, because I imagine that's a bug. If you die early you're still getting &lt;= 20 points. And like I also said these games aren't consistently filled with 7 vessels, allowing for the killer to easily deny the 25 points for all if they just smash the 2 or 3 vessels that are in most of the matches.
---
Wish the same could be said for my wife on xbox, her online gaming experience for the past few years has been filled with sexist douchebags that were easily blocked and ignored. But DbD on xbox brought all the sexist pricks to the forefront. The amount of hate she receives seemingly for being a "girl gamer" is incredible. The red rank community on xbox is relatively small and she would without a doubt get tunnled/camped etc. Almost every game for being a girl? Aside from the creepers who would hand her a win or whatever and then expect a back and forth conversation for doing so which always led to unwanted advances and the like. About 2 months ago she changed her gamertag to a more (mostly)gender neutral name and most of the bs ended. Still upsetting that she had to change her name just to be given a fair shake or to be left alone in this game.
---
we can appreciate ass without jerking off to it
---
That's definitely very weird.
---
Except the radius for Whispers is tighter and more definitive. The point of BBQ is to give you enough information to get you into another chase, or at least away from the hook, and that change wouldn't do either.
---
GG EZ l0l trash baby killer how do i turn up bot difficulty git gud git gud get fucked idiot
---
As a survivor main, I disagree, I prefer to get out of the hook fully healthy
---
In all my matches, I’ve never had a friendly pig. Must be nice 😢
---
Fool.  You think there can only be one?
---
Yup those are the try hard filth that insist on hatch standoffs or mandatory slugs even if they have no clue where last survivor is.  I just take my obvious win, pip and bp's and queue up my next victims
---
Karma for playing legion
---
Wow really 500 hours is like a friggin ton!!!
---
Because he is complaining about nerfs to the doctor when he wasnt nerfed and wont answer anyone who asks what the nerfs were except for this comment.
---
someone was a little triggered
---
Honestly with playing more today now, it just really seems to be a roll of the dice.  But yeah survivor is quicker.
---
*touches lamp*
---
Maybe it's just normal for PS4 then. On pc, the queue times are up to 30 minutes for a game, just to get dodged and requeue. 
---
I still campaign for hatch dance off with unique kill for killer if they win. Or a good old game of rock, paper, scissors.
---
Just a little bit
---
Well your friend had a great idea. Cute/10
---
I’m just a competitive individual. I don’t get seriously upset if the last one gets away, but it does bug me lol. More of a self-esteem hit than anything. 
---
But the 4th person rarely gets away from me 😈 * laughs in *iridescent add-ons* *
---
The math disagrees.  You need 4,500 points to earn all the cosmetics.  At a maximum of 45 points per survivor game, you need a minimum of 100 runs that complete all the gens and escape with a lantern.  Even if you can gen rush and the game lasts 6 minutes, you need 10 hours of game play not including lobby time  if every game is a flawless run.    
---
A more common scenario would be 3-4 gens and a hatch escape possibly, putting your points at 12-41 per game, average around 25 points or so.  That puts the number of games needed to complete at 180.   With game times lasting around 10 minutes usually, since not every game will be a gen rush or a 3 gen purgatory, that puts time needed at 30 hours, not including lobby time.   
---
This is nothing more than to drive people to the cosmetic store to spend their money instead of being able to reasonably earn them.  At $10 per skin, earning it the fastest means your play time is worth $3 an hour, while on average about $1.  Killers have an even harder time, and will likely resort to more toxic tactics the more they get gen-rushed throughout the event, resulting in even less point gain for some, further degrading their points per game.
---
Thank you OP
---
wtf, really? thats surprising. but honestly, i think its because most of the kids go on console. consoles are cheaper and easier to get from your parents, so i could imagine kids are more prone to playing games on console. and then if the game is full of kids, more toxicity is bound to take place.
---
but yeah, a lot of the ways girls can stop harassment are really dumb. in games like Overwatch, i get told to mute them. but if i mute them, we cant community, and then we're more likely to use. and we shouldnt have to change our usernames or the characters we play just to please 15 year old virgins
---
I’d say instead of hooks make it so each phase grants 2 points and increase the points per destroyed vessel to 5. Killer will technically be able to make more than survivor but they won’t on average especially because you only get like one offering per bloodweb so it should help fix the issue where nobody wants to play killer while also making it so people still play survivor as well. 
---
Also, make it so instead of only being able to break a vessel while someone is on the hook, make it so you have 15-20 seconds once you hook someone to destroy a vessel, and if a survivor disconnects once the game starts then the killer receives the remainder of points they would get from hooking them. This should reduce the amount of hook suicides and insta disconnects to deny points as they screw the killer and the rest of their team over when it happens, and the 20 second thing actually gives killers a chance to break the vessels if the survivor decides to kill themselves or is on death hook. 
---
Finally, literally just buff the BP killers get from the offering by a lot and by a fair amount for survivors as well. You get 1500 points for breaking a vessel. I’d make more if I hooked one guy during hallowed blight than if I destroy 3 lamps.
---
Yeah I can understand that lol
---
I've just seen a lot of killers get seriously pissed off and even act like they lost because the 4th survivor got hatch.
---
No but it certainly seems to glitch some things out on the survivor side. I get stuck in the basement 90% of on the time with 150 cap. Sometimes I can't search chests or cleanse totems either.
---
Ok thanks i finally have insight about this, but this does not change how he plays at all especially with nurses, because let's face it people who are salty about a bug that makes the survivors visible while not healing should probably stop using it as a crutch
---
1 yes. 2 red means lantern can be destroyed by killer
---
3 no. Sparks only. And you get bp by holding it.

---

---
4. 2 by default. Each offering spawns one more
---
it's a lot compared to receiving at least one sexist remark per hour which happens in most other games
---
I have seen this used as an actual strategy in order to have enough time to complete a gen in such a 1v1 scenario.  If the killer is just going from gen to gen, they're almost always able to do the full cycle fast enough to ensure that the survivor wouldn't have time to actually complete a full generator.  If the survivor hides, and doesn't touch a generator for several minutes then the killer may assume that they are just hiding and start patrolling around the entire map to find the hiding spot giving generators more than 80 seconds between visits, allowing them a chance to survive.  
---
Even if it *can* work, it takes forever and is very unrewarding for both remaining players since spending that time in a new game would be worth much more than trying to drag out the current match over 10 minutes more just for a few more points.  Mostly it's just a shitty thing that people do due to the poor design of the end-game. It's similar to slugging the 3rd survivor in order to get a 4k.  Yes, it can work, but it takes forever and isn't fun or rewarding for any players involved.  
---
Absolutely not trying to defend any survivor that does this.  It sucks.  In most cases that I've seen though, it's not even part of some "strategy" in order to get the last gen done and survive, it's just to take the game hostage and be a dick.
---
Be brave! Go with Object of Obsession! 🙃
---
Run Tombstone or tombstone piece Myers for the super salt then.  
---
*The Nightmare swirls and churns unending!*
---
Hope you get banned asshole.
---
6. If you dont grab it, killer might break it. High risk high reward
---
Lol no. Bamboozle is useful on the odd map that still has an annoying window ala ironworks. A perk is not worth taking just for those moments. Its much better to learn how to play jingle gyms/t walls without it
---
Possible you got exhausted before by an addon or something and didn't notice
---
Sorry thats answer for 4
---
Idk about everyone else, but when I play, I play my best to win. I I'm not the guy to do a 5min hatch standoff, but I will slug second to last person for a bit trying to find them. I dont usually get upset during the game. If it cost me a second person getting out, good for them. I hate people who refuse to help a downed team mate while they t-bag on the hatch. 
---
Cries in long sleep transition.
---
That's also true, even though my experience was a lot different. I have really bad eyes, so finding survivors was (and still is) horrible for me, but I digress
---
I get how the matchmaking thing can result in the event being unfun for soneone,and I truly wish newer players had fair matches, but the way OP blames the event for matchmaking's shortcomings while having played 2 games of it before making a rant post on reddit is hilarious. Sounds harsh, but it is what it is
---
Same here
---
I don't understand how the Clown is a better version of the Huntress, when the Clown's ability is meant to slow down the survivors so you can hit them, and the Huntress's ability... just hits them.
---
I think that you dramatically over value some killers and dramatically under value others. If I was going to rank them I'd say:
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Hillbilly
---
3. Huntress
---
4. Spirit
---
5. Myers
---
6. Hag
---
7. Clown
---
8. Doctor
---
9. Pig
---
10. Leatherface
---
11. Wraith
---
12. Trapper
---
13. Freddy
---
The Legion is a weird one, and I'm not sure where to rank him.
---
They’re just being the biggest of babies. I get bootyhurt over it, but it’s not like the survivors I went against will ever know. I just kinda put the controller down, go talk shit about the match to my husband, make a snack, and forget about it. I’ll never understand the logic in hate-messaging people :/
---
I want an energy drink to remove my exhaustion
---
Answer 4
---
Double mistake. Thats answer 6
---
See, the thing is I don't consider getting a 3k a loss. It's not 4k or nothing
---
I may be in the minority here but I find it so hard to subscribe to this sub when my feed is just littered with garbage. I know it would personally improve the experience for me, but what about you guys? Vote on the poll and let’s get a consensus! 
---
Sounds like a salty survivor that get destroyed by a legion xD
---
There is no nerf. OP is referring to the fact that calm spirit now lets you resist the urge to scream and nurses calling doesnt let you see auras of survivors snapping out of it which it shouldnt. Nurses is to see people healing. Snapping out of it is not healing.
---
I was playing solo yesterday and had pretty bad wait times. Usually I get lobbies almost instantly.It was to the point that I actually did homework between matches.
---
Gross
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm on a Huntress kick right now, nothing more satisfying than landing a hatchet on a fleeing survivor lol especially when it's some good distance.
---
I can’t play Killer sorry
---
I dont consider it either a loss, but if I can get a 4k, why wouldnt I? It's more blood points anyways 
---
As a wraith main this makes me sad. Seems like every other wraith uses their invisibility for the sole purpose of camping and tunneling. Very sad
---
No its not top ten lol. So many perks are better than bamboozle
---
In that case nerf adrenaline too. If that's your logic then how unfair is it that you knock someone down and the last gen pops and people get up off the floor and sprint away?
---
The game is actually really balanced right now with the exception of legion.
---
Upvoted for noed nerf suggestion
---
Unvoted for it being the 100th not constructive in any way noed nerf suggestion
---
Downvoted for acting like a 14yo about it
---
How is that a poor rebuttal? It’s such an easy thing to counter....
---
If you really can’t find the totems use Small Game
---
Nah it has been considerably noticeable since the event 
---
No. Complaints and Salt/Rant posts should be. At least memes can be enjoyed. I don't want the sub filled with idiots who sit there and complain about NOED or some shit. 
---
Ill just chill with my friends at the otger side of the map until you get bored.Or start vaulting pallets so you get annoyed by the notification.
---
It never has, people have just always been confused. You can check the wiki.
---
Talk for yourself
---
Just for you, I'm gonna derank even harder now.
---
(HOLD) AMBUSH
---
Opposite for me on PC, depends on your region and time of day.
---
Yeah, not me still, I'm on PC. queues have been great.
---
Same. I enjoy getting a 4K, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not gonna waste half an hour of my life slugging or doing a hatch standoff for it. I think the game would be in a worse state without the hatch, too, so it’s a necessary evil. 
---
On the other hand Adept achievements are a complete pain in the ass just because of the hatch and I wish they’d tweak them slightly. 
---
Oh yeah! I didn't play her for a long time too, and it was rough getting back into her again, but it's been fun to just relax for the event! 
---
The perks I generally run are: NOED, Make your choice, BBQ &amp; Chili, and usually something random after that. I've been using bloodhound a bit, as well as a few others. 
---
It's kind of hard to find strong builds for her because so many perks work well with her! I often completely switch things around... aside from BBQ. That's a permanent fixture on her because sneak. I might try whispers! I haven't used it since I played the nurse way back when.
---
Legion is balanced, if you actually die to a legion then you need to get good
---
"Sometimes you just don't find the last one"
---
Then find it and cleanse it, or quit bitching when you get downed. You are creating your own problem here. 
---
I see thx
---
For real. It's almost like there's a direct counter to Hex totems. 
---
Same its sad that my group has been having to split up into 2's everytime we play and even then it still takes awhile. It seems to have been like this since the holiday event ended.
---
Someone did this for me once lmao I  was the only one left alive just running around in a panic and I expected the killer to just sign off eventually, but he ran into me finally and started helping me! It was the most exciting feeling. 
---
Ah I see. They take it to keep tabs on me and communicate it I'm guessing 
---
NOED has already been heavily nerfed. It used to be uncounterable and permanent. Stop being salty and cleanse the totems if you care that much. If you don't cleanse don't come on here complaining you didn't get a free escape for playing poorly.
---
The day memes are banned is the day I unsub
---
Let's just remove perks entirely. I am very smart. 
---
Wait do they really have 500 people?
---
I've always assumed they are an indie developer group of like 20 people. 
---
His swap is pretty quick fav moment was watching these streamers bitch and looken for reasons to ban me.. i was useing highest voltage and they were like" he shocked me and HIT me at the same time.. impossible.. litterally impossible!!!! He cant zap and hit at the same time!" I can when I zap and run while switching in the path of it and their dedass stays by the pallet. Lol. But yeeeeesssss make it faster 
---
Id like it if switching and shocking doesnt make you lose bloodlust
---
the event is way easier for survivors that killers so more people are survivors and less are killers. same thing happened last even till they fixed it. it shouldnt be that hard just make it even points for both sides
---
I appreciate killers who don't slug the penultimate person. As someone who plays the game more for fun, as a survivor as it's less stress and tries to only play an hour or so it really sucks when someone slugs you and thinks its ok that you wait 5 minutes whilst they hunt for someone else, then they get butt hurt when you DC but they are wasting my time so they can get that blessed 4K 
---
this Dude is just an annoying prick....probably even a teen or kid...
---
 &gt; No
---
Not an argument. Try again.
---
 &gt; "People who put a lot of time into dbd or other similar multiple games are typically (insert generalization)'
---
Hmm....
---
But did survivors ever scream when they ran Calm Spirit? I thought this perk was already usable for this exact purpose. 
---
No i've hit my dead hard for a killer to down me right as i did it and i was exhausted, thats why i run BL instead. Dead hard just isnt reliable enough
---
I cant read, where is the nerf announcement?
---
something something TdS
---
I tried to do the same thing as nurse lol. Every time people see the nurse they panic
---
I consider everything under a 4k a loss personally because 90% of my games are a 4k and I don't camp and I don't tunnel 
---
I don’t play him much anymore, but I cut my teeth on wraith.
---
I always saw his power being good for mind games and map pressure. Using it for fuccboi camping sucks. Someone will always try and go for the save because survivors have to get altruism points somehow, and camping like that essentially removes it as a possibility.
---
People act like camping isn’t a viable strat, but because of the need to gather altruism points it is. A really toxic one.
---
I actually did this just the other day! I loaded into a game with just me and another survivor! We worked on a gen 'together' so they could escape! 
---
https://i.imgur.com/Dbmrq2i.png
---
Sometimes it ain't fair! Sometimes you gotta' help out the other side. &lt;3
---
Against competent survivors, I'd put Hag above Myers and Spirit's just better than Huntress in general(she's way more consistent).
---
Wraith is the most wholesome killer wdym?
---
I play wraith sometimes and I Ding dong ditch hooks cuss bbq! Get them off gens bby toxic wraiths
---
Really? I think it's way easier as killer. All you gotta do is swing at the lantern things (I haven't gotten to play much lately so I haven't learned the name) when you hook a survivor. Survivors can lose the embers if they get hooked while killers will never lose their progress.
---
i still haven’t gotten achievement for getting a 4k and i’m a rank 8 killer and i’ve had the game literally since 2016.
---
Right now on my meg i'm running sprint burst, spine chill, quick and quiet, and urban evasion. Keep in mind i'm just starting to play this game a decent amount so outside of urban only meg's perks are teachable right now for me. I enjoy engaging in chases and moving around the map quickly to do objectives and rescue teammates. 
---
Yeah me too.Sitting 20 minutes for someone to dc at the beggining is really fun.
---
That's so cute  
---
Love it
---
lamp me up daddy!
---
I have a Keyboard and mouse, but DBD doesn’t support it on PS4. I’m left handed too so I can barely use a keyboard :(
---
I need lömp
---
Yea I can see that even then I really don’t because I like to get my BBQ stacks lol I just don’t get it at all lol. Maybe I’m a little salty but it’s honestly frustrating being made out like I’m the only one that exists in the damn game lol. 
---
Switch those textbooks out for American court systems, biochemistry, and botany and it’s me...
---
But but I need 1 kill.
---
I am impressed you waited 45 minutes.  I would of gave up after 5 minutes and played something else.  
---
What about for people who can't get games in there region at high ranks? Or if your learning a new killer so essentially like a newbie again? I de-ranked only to rank 10 as killer but I did it via staying in basement and letting people just get on with the game. Considering it on survivor now as I am red rank and it takes a long time to fins a game but I have seen others on ps4 at purple and green are getting games. 
---
that give 4 points each while survivors who escape get 25. so for a killer to get the same 3 for hooks and 4 for destroying the lantern it would take 4 hooks and destroying of lanterns. at base rate thats 2 matches while survivors can potentially get 25 from one plus the 5 gens. 
---
killer is more consistent but survivor is way more efficient if you are good at escaping
---
Oh! I thought you meant it doesn’t work at all, my bad. You were right, my OoO aura is suppressed in the locker lol
---
Wait you get blood points for the objectives? I’m not even earning progress lmao
---
In response to someone saying they would get PWYF in the hopes it gets buffed
---
He said "It's really not that useful. As far as Myers's perks go, Dying Light is really the only decent one..."
---
Because:
---
 "Hey, wanna get the benefits of sparing the asshole with DS and have them basically be guaranteed to escape despite karma"
---
To which I said "RANCOR", because it fixes the thing that makes him consider STBFL AND PWYF bad and flawed
---
Fair enough lol but you could have multiples if you didn’t tunnel you could have the person who took me off the hook as well as me. 
---
Medium vaults are completely broken.But fast vaults haha getting hit all the time.
---
That I wouldn't mind but when your downed and then just left to crawl about uselessly til you die it just sucks and wastes time. 
---
Are you okay? You sound like my post made you a little too upset...
---
I love lamp?  knew it LOL
---
With pig I get it if you have the rbt on because you are already out of the gen game so going after the person who unhooked you makes more sense but in other situations it just is what it is because that’s one less hook you need or it could take you completely, plus it’s only 1 hit compared to 2 and a whole other chase. Usually you get tunneled when your team makes a bad save and the killer is close to the hook so unless he’s camping then they should of waited so you can’t get tunneled. Blame goes both ways and you can’t really fault the killer for doing his job just like they can’t blame you for rushing gens
---
Unless in a trade you sit out one gen since the killer gave up a kill for sparing your life lol
---
I'm so glad you do!
---
Did not know that, once again I didn't play much of the event yet.
---
I once had a team where 1 dced 1 got tunneled to death and I legit had to do all the saves and gens and ran the killer around for days he had to give up on me all the time. I got hooked after running him around waiting for a door to open. None ever did not till I got hooked for the first time... she spilt as soon as the door opened and I has 24k points and she had 6k.... 5 k for escape and however much for opening it.. i mean tf was she doing?! Not a fkin gen.
---
Idea: take the wake up affect from Adrenaline, and add it to the perk Wake Up
---
TFW you are Freddy so you can't even defend your hooks
---
Oh jeeze! Well, like I said! Respect to you! It takes a lot of skill to play with a controller. :O 
---
Players are leaving because the game is in a tragic state, all the bugs and glitches plus the ridiculous frame rate doesn't really attract someone...
---
Nea, you sneaky little killer you :P
---
Oh, the killer can break it at any time?  I was under the impression they could only do so after a survivor holding it had been hooked.
---
I tunnel for shorter chases, not for the survivor to have fun
---
TBH thats what i really like about the DbD community.   
---
I used to wonder why girls didnt play competitive games that i enjoy, and i came to realize that a lot of it has to do with those types of game's communities  having a toxic or creepy attitude towards girls.   
---
I love watching all the different kinds of streamers that play. It's especially interesting to watch the barriers that are broken, when i see someone playing that doesnt "look like they'd play" a horror/thriller game. 
---
I’ve only seen it once from a killer perspective. Dreadful, especially against poor sharp hand joe. Hopefully a rework in 2.6 &lt;3
---
(Also a killer that isn’t like the legion).
---
Yeah, killers crying about DS is embarrassing. 
---
How to beat the doctor:
---
Don’t pull down the pallet and just keep looping him. He has to bloodlust you at that point because every time he shocks you the bloodlust timed resets.
---
Doctor is tough at low ranks with new players, but he doesn’t need a nerf. We need buffs though. Freddy and Leatherface.
---
Switching between Pig and Spirit? Are you me?
---
He’s becoming the nurse
---
By 4k I mean me killing me all the other survivors 
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear pig masks and cloaks. 
---
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Thank you for blessing my eyeballs. 
---
Damn, I’ve been waiting to go to badham for a while now.
---
yeah np just telling you the stats. the devs just need to balance the killer and survivor side for event points once again like the last sidequest event
---
This one made me smile from one cheek to the other.
---
Uhhh...because the picture clearly shows it?
---
The name of this leads me to think memes are fine, but not ones where you put little effort into making them. Using a meme for something completely different and changing one thing/only adding a picture of a face to make it relevant is a bit boring.
---
There are some amazing high/medium effort memes that are damn near untouchable though. 
---
Idk I don’t get it like I said most killers at rank 1 and 2 all have BBQ and even I’m a rank 1 killer I prefer my BBQ stacks than going after one single person. I get there’s no rule and you can do whatever you want but it makes the game less enjoyable for everyone and I’m sorry but some cases gen rush doesn’t apply lol. I never have an issue because I don’t tunnel I usually get my 4Ks with atleast 4 generators still needing to be completed. 
---
I might have played against you. other two people just left right away but me and my friend stayed and let the pig hook us a couple times.
---
Yeah. It's very annoying. Especially when the rescuer doesn't have borrowed time. These guys mostly are killer mains who don't know how unfair it is to get tunneled.
---
As long as I get my BBQC 4 stack, I am more than ok if the 4th guy gets away.  I do prefer though, if a 4th does get away. Its the guy who played the best in the match. Sorry, not giving it to DS users HAHA
---
I’d ambush (that ass)
---
I do that as well. And when the last gen and noed pops I kill them all
---
Like I said ultimately they can do what they want but it really feels like if you’re tunneling to get a kill and maybe it’s just me but if you’re tunneling for one kill than maybe this game isn’t for you. 
---
Survivors get litterally no bp this event but buff killer bp amirite?
---
I hope you die on first hook
---
Take me back to the Summer BBQ please
---
I thought they fixed that bug? It used to happen all the time but now it never happens. Maybe try using dead hard a little earlier? Or play lower ping games. I dunno what I did that made the bug stop happening.

---
I'll be sure to post it, and any others I may do!
---
You can’t really blame them for pallet looping 
---
my thoughts exactly, but i think hitting madness 3 through static field shouldn’t be removed
---
Farming for points is bannable only if you don't allow all the survivors participate in the farm(as far as I'm concerned).  
---
I don't know why the Nea cared about getting farmed. The faster you get out of the legion match, the better. 
---
3 man made it to end game i opened 1 gate, the other 2 were across the map near a gate. i got mine open but no ed was in affect and they both got hooked. me being who i am was like fine i'll try got em both off hook i got dropped saving the second buy near the gate he opened it and they both left my ass behind &gt;\_&lt;  GG LAMP
---
ah it was a clown running instant down bottles and the no ed was near the exit gate they were hooked at LOLOLOL
---
I figured lol. 
---
Should have.
---
No this is Patrick. 
---
You realise it's both sides? It's a never ending circle of shit. Your now lobby dodging because people have been shit to you which means the people you dodge will be annoyed and frustrated, especially if they are on PS4 right now with the wait times, and then they are more likely to try hard and be shitty to someone else.
---
Farming is only bannable if the killer doesn't let everyone farm or you sandbagged to help the killer. Since he was also inviting the Nea but she refused then it's not bannable.
---
I noticed that. With the past events there were waaaaay too many people being killer so survivor wait times were mere seconds. Now though it is quite the opposite.
---
Again if you need to tunnel to get 1 kill per game then this game isn’t for you did I stutter? 
---
yeah i get you but right now playing as killer will almost give you insta lobbies so dont always be thinking its a 4 man
---
But why? Is what I’m asking. Why isn’t the game for them? 
---
not enough killers playing for the amount of survivors
---
Emo clown
---
It's a good thing I like the Huntress. 
---
A good thing for this game, horrible for me.  
---
I can blame them however for being shit about it. I play through the game without leaving, the least you can do is not do a lil' jiggle every time you hop a pallet. Be a good sport, not a shit person.  
---
Then again, I could always run Legion. : \^ ) 
---
Change prayer to anal and you have my attention 
---
It only happens to me when I try to join with three of my friends.  Sometimes longer.
---
&gt;That depends on your play-style.Do you like avoiding the killer and stay hidden or get chased?
---
avoiding
---
It’s honestly faster to just play killer 
---
thanks
---
You can't change how others act but you can change your outlook on it. Just quit being sensitive and viewing everything as bm and "toxic." Easier than you think
---
Nurses calling and Calm Spirit changes aren't very big changes. You still get the bloodpoint notification against calm spirit. And the nurses change was not needed, but still not that big. No one even runs Calm Spirit.
---
yeah every time that happens i usually give them hatch unless they were teabagging or something, some killers are just sweaty cunts that make it really un fun to play the game. I have a friend tho that's like punched holes in his walls cause he lost a 2 hour hatch standoff that he caused, I've since distanced myself from him but it never ceases to amaze me how salty killers get about not getting a 4k. To be honest though, I play killer much more than survivor and when i get the opportunity to give someone hatch it really makes me happy knowing how happy it can make someone to get an escape in a game that most likely their teammates screwed them over in. especially since it happens all the time with people getting caught first or missing their ds and leaving and it completely screws the game over for their remaining teammates.
---
Hatch dance-off!!! 
---
Unique hatch kills included!!!
---
Alternatively Rock, Paper,Scissors!
---
Yes. Altering Game Files is bannable
---
Had a Wraith on Ps4 that facecamped a vessel while cloaked. My friend harvested it right in front of him. Wraith disconnected. 
---
It would have been really funny if it didn't take SWF on the Ps4 15-20 minutes to load into a lobby
---
Because clearly they don’t know how to play the game. How is it better to tunnel 1 survivor and let 3 others escape vs not tunnel and no one escapes? 
---
Sorry, Mercy is not in my Job Description. Mwhahahaha!
---
I am not talking about inst-dcing. As I said when I de-ranked I just mae a game of it. I played bubba, hid in basement, I ran insidious and all hex perks so survivors had things to pop for points and I only attacked if someone went for the chest in the basement. I would then carry them upstairs and dump them out of the building and go hide back downstairs.   
---
Survivors where able to get points and go and I only killed them if they repeately came down and started BMing me. This way I was able to de-rank so I can have a crack at huntress and survivors still got points.   
---
I've seen the Wraith's mori animation so many times and yet I'm still left with soul crushing disappointment.  
---
Spirit 
---
Thana 
---
Ruin
---
Thrill
---
BBQ 
---
I bet the Freddy mains told them, first time they are invited and it gets leaked, smh  
---
\-Clown main
---
survivor is really unfun during events and i’m saying this as someone who plays 80/20 killer on ps4
---
True that brotha! Or sista! Or gender unspecified being! 
---
"Infinite" pallet looping doesn't exist. Just don't respect the pallet.  
---
Besides that, this game, like every game, is about fun. And for one side to have fun, it needs to make the other lose(which is frustrating). I'd say I'm decent at killer and SWF groups mostly fuck around and not go all out on getting gens, which is why I don't really care for survive with friend groups.  
---
You also shouldn't dodge groups. It just makes you play the game less. Instead of complaining about "toxic" SWF groups, try getting better at the game by winning against them. Getting more kills as the survivors become more coordinated is fun, in my opinion.
---
At some point, the penny has got to drop. The cycle will continue one way or another, but in the end, someone has to stand up, say ' No more, stop. '. I'm tired of being treated like shit. And just letting them does nothing to better the whole. What would you recommend I do?
---
Yea but I want a none stressful game right now lol, currently trying to learn huntress and my hatchet game is none existent lmao. 
---
It has taken nearly 20 minutes to get a game as I was dodged by 2 lobbies.
---
^(Same.)
---
I only got a got PC recently after playing console my entire life, and I played a ton of Dead by Daylight on console (despite how laggy it is and how poor it looks), yet I rebought Freddy on PC despite now having the hindsight to see how bad he is rather than instantly buying him on release, because I like to have all the perks unlocked, and it feels weird to have one locked killer.
---
Though I do admit, Freddy came a whole paycheck later than the rest of the cast.
---
Yeah, that really sucks. Sorry for that. Since the event I've saved at least 5 people with the exit gates open and a lantern in hand.  
---
Some people are selfish in this game. Let me introduce SWF to you!
---
What about Bam Bam?

---
If I’m feeling super killerlike I’ll throw on an ebony 
---
Can I talk about the maths or is it a secret
---
I run both, use my bl, next chase, dh. Even with exhausted, bl has that stagger reduction, so you can kite killers
---
Where did they say he was getting nerfed? Also I'm ready for it every blind killer plays doctor for free kills
---
Times are gross as survivor so I've stwich to killer
---
Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you are saying. I’m thinking tunneling as I hook you then walk away and before I get too far you get unhooked so I turn around and there is you (hurt) and the other guy (healthy) and I go after you and throw you right back on the hook. How is that going to let the rest escape if anything that will get one kill out the way early and since it was so fast you didn’t lose a gen 
---
I mean ya teabagging is bad. I’m just saying looping in itself is not toxic at all
---
Ace is always fire.
---
But I didn’t say I 4K every game I said I can usually 4K 
---
This event is a joke, only 3 cheap cosmetics and nothing interesting to do. Boring
---
Never said that you victimized me either, but I’ll leave this thread alone now so nothing else I say gets taken out of context. Sometimes people are just making friendly conversation. 
---
According to the list of bannable offenses, I don’t see farming.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/16/1474222499230242023/
---
Same. As someone that runs at 144 hz, the basement was a rubberband death magnet since the latest patch.
---
With the cosmetics for the event I'm maining Ace for Plunders + Ace in the Hole. The items I'm pulling are freaking insane and everyone is so caught up with Lanterns that boxes are untouched!
---
Technically it could be seen as bannable but it's one of those things where if somebody actually did report the incident they are probably disowned by their family and their ten cats all hiss at them when approached.  
---
a female character tells me what to do well thats a yikes 
---
love everything about this piece. really great work. &lt;3
---
Now if you mean like purposely waiting for a tunnel and going one by one through surviors then yea I think that’s a dumb idea and you will probably lose since you’re wasting time
---
The killer just wants to get newbies so he can feel better about himself.
---
Out of the perks you currently have I'd recommend:  
---
Dark Sense - Lets you know where the killer is after completing a gen  
---
We'll Make It - For faster Healing after you save  
---
We're Gonna Live Forever - More bloodpoints for faster progression  
---
Hope(for end game)/Dead Hard(if you ever get in a chase) - Hope and Dead Hard are much better utilized the better you are at the game, which I believe, if you try learning how to use them effectively, would make you a much tougher survivor to chase, which will prolong your life, make your team have time to do gens and just make you better at survivor in general.  
---
As you are a new survivor, I'd really recommend learning how to lead a chase.
---
Ahh. Yeah, I feel weird seeing locked killers on my roster too. I mean, I have moooost of their perks, but not all of them. I honestly think if I buy a new killer, I'd sooner buy Legion than Freddy at this point though. o~o
---
That’s exactly what I’m saying even if you’re across the map you break off chases just to go back to the hooked person and make it your sole obsession to ensure you get the 1 kill. 
---
&gt; So, I see three-four people suddenly pop into the lobby, all at the same exact time? Leave Lobby,
---
This is one of the biggest causes of 'toxicity' in the game. Sometimes SWF are waiting 20, 30, 40 minutes for a game. If you leave, they are going to hate killers.
---
In before someone tells you “just don’t get caught!” with no irony whatsoever. 
---
Oh yes survivors have been nerfed, I'm not saying that. But I'm saying the reason killers get nerfed is not ow strong they are, its complaining.
---
Btw the game is still survivor sided with all the nerfs, it is as fair as its ever been, but still.
---
There was once a time where as killer you could stand right in front of the hook and they couldn't save at all, you blocked the hook. This was overall a good change, but it was handy for securing a kill when the gates were up.
---
And if survivors could adapt there would be no complaining about Nurse, or about Freddy for that matter.
---
I try to msg the killers and I don’t really pour salt into my msgs I’ll say something like you realize there’s 3 other people in the game or you know you lose points by focusing on one person. 
---
Pretty sure I played with you. Happy year of the piggy.
---
&gt; Nurses calling wont let you see auras of people snapping out of it.
---
Botany Knowledge also no longer speeds up Snapping out of it. It was a Doctor buff all along, wake up sheeple!
---
I will go to the hatch if I know where it is after the third kill, but if they beat me there or I dont find them before I just take the hit and let them escape. Not worth wasting my time or theirs.
---
i definitely hoped it would be like the hallowed blight with each side getting an equal opportunity to get points instead of this tryhard all game to get 20 while the dude who did gens and grabbed a lamp gets 45 
---
Yesssss lmao. Urban evasion baby!! You’ll never be seen stick to the outskirts and wait it out!!! 
---
&gt;As you are a new survivor, I'd really recommend learning how to lead a chase.
---
thank you
---
is dwight the devs
---
Yeah, turns out it's bugged. From what I've gathered, if the FIRST person to escape has the lantern before anyone dies, then everyone gets points. But I haven't managed to confirm anything lol
---
This is dead by buglight afterall
---
TL;DR I suck against SWF. Waaah!
---
True, but many still avoid playing as killer because of the stress. The stress of the uphill battle against time. Its pretty easy to rank up as killer and once you reach those high ranks, boy do the survivors know what they are doing. They dont waste ANY time. xD sure killers get much more bloodpoints, but the amount of stress from the match doesnt make it worth it for many people. I personally find the bloodpoint gain lucrative so I continue being mostly killer, but many people prefer the lower gain as a survivor because it isnt as stressful. Wish I could play survivor again without waiting for more than 20 minutes. :/ Killer side needs more incentive to attract more people. Maybe not in bloodpoints, but in some form or another. Honestly dont know though so here we are with the survivor-to-ratio messed up. :(
---
Is Freddy a manlet, or is every other male killer just really tall?  Doctor, Wraith, Leatherface and Michael gotta be clocking in at around 6'7-6'10.  These are some big boyz you're matching up against.  
---
Ok I got you then yea that makes sense, I was talking about more like just being a few steps away after hooking because that happens a lot. If you are across the map or in chase stick to what you’re doing but if I’m barely 20ft away and you get unhooked I’m coming back because it will be quick 
---
You may have! Happy year of the Pig to you too! 
---
I'm a survivor main, but play killer 25% of the time.
---
Do what everyone else does. If you see 3-4 man SWF, ruin their time with a mori. You don't need to be a good killer to get at least 2 kills and shut them up. Save your mori's for these games, but don't dodge them. 
---
If your frustration is really bad, insidious + face camping around the corner out of sight is a great way to get their egos in check. 
---
Well you are like 1/20 who do that.The way you did that its completely fine but do not tell me that this is normal.
---
The strongest thing about the Pig is her ability to stall a game with her traps. If someone is trapped, they likely are twirling on a gen, and they can’t escape. 
---
Your change would completely neuter the Pig. 
---
that is cute and wholesome but farming is not fun :( Whenever the killer wants to farm against 4 survivors I usually just go into a locker and DC. I wanna play plz chase me. 
---
As a killer main it is easily to understand why.
---
I have a ps4 pro and on a lot of maps on killers side the performance is very poor and the fps drops are real. 
---
Also playing killer on rank 1 is pretty boring since i ranked up with 1 killer (hag) and rest of them are low level without any perks so i dont wanna que since i know im going to most likely get destroyed unless i play hag.
---
And there is the event which for killers is just a joke so why bother. Thats my insight on this based on my experience. 
---
Self care?Tf?Imagine tunneling because of a perk that doesnt involve you in any way.
---
it's xbox's fault. the software is trash. I should know because I own one and it does this shit constantly. might have to delete and reinstall the whole game.
---
Killer is so lame! Why would I waste time going to go look for a vessel to get shitty bp when I can go and chase a survivor off a gen???
---
6
---
BBQ and Ruin are toxic? Ruin at least is mandatory to play against good survivors and have a chance. I'm in total agreement with NoED tho, it's a crutch perk
---
That fact you know this...
---
Ace: 10/10  
---
Feng: 9/10  
---
Huntress: meh/10
---
This is late, but my friend and I played against you last night! We had no idea what you were doing, but appreciate the gesture even so!
---
Do you happen to play on PS4? 
---
I need more than luck on my side when it comes to selfish people grabbing Lanterns and letting me die on hook so they can escape.
---
denial for what? That just because you suck as killer and can't get more than 3 hooks and all survivors escape against you means the event is survivor sided?
---
So can we blame you for face camping and tunneling?
---
People want sauce. I provided sauce.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
No it's not and I don't agree with people just doing it via DCing, however they are the one's more likely to be doing it to feel godly beating new players rather than legit reasons like learning a new killer or trying to get more games and not play lobby simulator 2019 lol. 
---
Instead of letting them wiggle in front of the hook I just walk to a gen and repeatedly hit a gen while they wiggle free. Most get the message but some are just dumb and still run
---
I mean that’s fair but even when I’m a few steps away I try to avoid the person whose hurt and go for the one who dehooked. Idk I always keep track of my hooks so I know who has what left and I go from there. I get it sometimes it’s unavoidable but I try to maximize my points every game. 
---
That is how I message but I usually just get abuse back lol. Like the one today showed they where very homophobic which I didn't agree with so I had to report them. 
---
Oh, I don't farm. I let them get their points, and then I make them leave whether I have to use force or not. I'm just helping people get their event done! 
---
Lmao, so you don't want to do anything in the match? Good call. This won't work on killers who are smart.
---
Lmao I’ll admit sometimes I get super salty in my msgs but for the most part I try the best I can to get my point across without trying to seem like a jerk. 
---
I don't get it either. They're taking their own problems (can't cut it at their current rank, long queues, etc) and instead of dealing with them, they make other people's experience bad instead. It's the epitome of the "I got mine so fuck ya'll" attitude.
---
I'm so glad you did, and yeah there were plenty that were a bit confused, and I don't blame them! I played plenty of survivor games last night and I saw how brutal the killers were being! 
---
I'm glad y'all were happy with it. &lt;3 
---
You don't hear the phasing sound if you're in her terror radius.
---
the purchased items are in the shop. you need to contact them for the others
---
shoot, I guess the dead body hanging in the police station is alive, same for the pool of blood left in that other guy's room.  
---
Freddy kills in the nightmares, you die in the dream you die in real life, like thats the whole point of the movies, did you even watch them?
---
Honestly, IMO, spine chill, premonition, alert, and all other perks that alert you when the killer is near is pretty useless to me Bc that’s what the terror radius is for. Personally my god build is Adrenaline, BT, Bond, Balanced Landing. You can switch bond off for plunders Bc let’s face it, plunders is meta as shit 
---
Wake Up doesn't need that, it's basically a counter to Remember Me anyway. Adrenaline just needs the nerf.
---
I think it's pretty fun to run bombing raids on generators with him. I M&amp;A my terror radius down and try to heave bottles onto progressing generators just outside of it. A little stupid, but entertaining.
---
Lol this guy is a troll sheesh. 
---
Next killer is confirmed to be Ludwig. Y’all better run from that horse 
---
It's happening with me too, but I play on ps4.
---
Ye i guess we are agreeing then :)
---
Oh didnt know that, thanks &lt;3
---
That is the tough part because most people would say by lobby dodging you are now being toxic like the people your avoiding. There isn't anything we can do it has to be the devs but it took an exploit that broke the bloodweb grind, taking away one of the main things they rely on to keep people playing, for them to finally instigate bans on console. Not the constant complaint about toxicity but the fact they could lose out and it was done in a day, I don't think they really care how people play there game which is sad as eventually it drives people away.   
---
It's pretty much ignoring them and just trucking on, or you give them a taste of there own medicine and face camp etc which will work on SWF as they are always way too altruistic but it means lowering yourself to there level.   
---
Me I am hoping for a new game to come out with devs who don't just create new skins and events and instead fix therre buggy ass game, who care if there game is becoming known as one of the most toxic communities and do something to stop it. 
---

---
Survivor pro tip: dead hard is the worst and I hate it
---
Yea I get it, everyone is different and I’ll switch up from game to game but I know I’ve let ppl go only to later get tbag at the exit gate by them lol so it has its risks sometimes taking the harder route 
---
Lol toxic behavior is a different story. I have no sympathy then but if you’re playing legit then you’re good. 
---
I don’t try to tunnel or camp but if I do and I get 3K or 4K from it then, don’t blame me blame your team for being stupid.
---
Exactly.
---
you can have multiple obsession perks in your build, gaining a higher chance of becoming the obsession.
---
for example if 2 people are running ds one will have the option to get out of killer grasp 1-2 secs after getting picked up
---
while the second/third/fourth person running it have to wiggle to 30% to get the ds skill check 
---
So bootstraps pig can have the smallest PP?
---
"highlight"
---
Brilliant! Thank you :)
---
Ruin is only mandatory if you already believe you are going to lose map control because you can't help but tunnel someone. Same with BBQ. 
---
Slightly off topic, but I had a guy send me the most vicious messages after a match once (like the hell?) But like midway through the convo, he realized I was, in fact, a female. Then he proceeded to apologize and ask if I had a boyfriend. Overall, it was a really odd experience. 
---
But I do enjoy that no one targets me because I’m a girl, as well. I wish people would tone it down with the after-game messages though ... Messy. 
---
None of which he did on PS4 to my knowledge
---
3K + Hatch is a 4K in my mind. You couldn’t finish all the gens and had to get the pity escape? Congrats you didn’t really “win” (unless you’re just looking for a pip). I just wish they’d give the killer some points for a survivor getting the hatch, like “desperate escape” or something. Right now, I just try to get them to jump for like 10 seconds and if they don’t it’s a smack and a see ya. 
---
Precisely
---
The guy is rank 15.
---
Woah there pal that’s a little to harsh. I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy.
---
When we first started it was pretty rough as the survivor, both between having new teammates and not knowing what to do ourselves. But after a number of matches we started winning consistently, learning little tricks like not just running away at full speed, but ducking around corners and crouching ect. 
---
Huntress still gives me the most trouble, not because of her throwing axes, but just because it always feels like she's after me. I know she's one of the slower killers, but most games against her I feel like I spend 90% of the time evading her instead of going for objectives. Though it might be that the majority of huntresses we fought we're just good. 
---
Pig is scary as well, for some reason sometimes she has no terror radius, not sure if it's a perk, but she's come right up to us on a generator multiple times with no heartbeat. A very rectum-clenching experience to be sure. 
---
Overall though, the game is pretty dang fun, and I can't say I regret picking up two copies for us. :3
---
you could say he is a **fire fist.**
---
Holy shit was that you? On steam? I ran into a pig doing that for like 4 games in a row last night it was amazing lol. 
---
Feng looks pretty good, and the pig head for huntress is fun
---
Pigs are the worst 
---
Sure they are anti-camper - but there are other incentives for not camping besides having a handicap that lets you know who to tunnel next. Also I am failing to see how this perk has anything to do with anti-tunneling.
---
You all can get butthurt over what I am saying all you want. But there is a reason that red ranks solely rely on these 3 perks. They are ruining the community. Just like SWF ruins the game, these "must have" perks are doing the same. 
---
3 gen is pretty easy to counter. And I agree they shouldn't make tier up screams stun, but removing tier 3 from field seems like a big unnecessary nerf. 
---
That might have been me! Without giving away my full name, it has something to do with doggos!! 
---
wat
---
I agree 100%
---
You mean "SWF" main, because otherwise you are playing a SINO. I've never played as killer and said, wow I need to tunnel this person so hard that I lose map control and give away all the gens so fast I need RUIN. 
---
The bloodwebs can cost more than 40,000, and it's hard to get envelopes, I'm probably going to resort to leveling one of the level 1 survivors just for this event, It's still terrible that I'm going to have to resort to using a level 1 character just to participate in the event and get bp/cosmetics, when my main isnt even p3 level 50 yet on the survivor side
---
It was only my first down and swf so I knew my team would at least try to save me. I'd rather save syringe for saving someone from their last hook.
---
On the one hand, if it's in the game you should be able to use it. On the other hand, the devs really need to re-tune some of the perks. Things like hex ruin and noed are more balanced at higher levels of play, but are disproportionately effective at lower ranks. Maybe they aren't overpowered, but they are bad for the game.  
---
  
---
These perks reward bad play, and make it much easier to rank up early on. Then you get killers who plateau because they are suddenly playing against survivors above their skill level. They can't catch them because they have noed and ruin instead of something like bamboozle, brutal strength, or spirit fury. What's worse is that noed can usually get you at least one free kill, which does a lot towards preventing depipping. Ruin delays gens without you having to do anything, which also contributes towards ranking up significantly, as you get points per second for each gen left up. This isn't a killer exclusive problem either. DS has the same effect. Just using DS gives you 30 out of 100 points you need for the iridescent benevolence medal, since it seems to count as wiggling off.  
---
Perks like this reward bad play, give free points towards ranking up, and prevent depipping. This is how we get midrank killers who dc when you cleanse ruin, and survivors who dc when you juggle them to the hook.
---
Oh goodness! I had no idea you were new to the game! Welcome!! It's a really fun game, and I have almost 1k hours in it. (Help me.)
---
But for the pig, when she's crouched she has no terror radius! She can very quickly stand up, or charge at you as well! 
---
For the huntress, they usually require a lot of skill! It's not easy to land those axe shots, so a lot of the huntresses one would run into would be those that are confident enough in playing the killer that they could land the axes, as she's almost useless without them! 
---
Yes I agree
---
Ah ok. Didnt realize. Thanks for clarifying.
---
When the killer is tired of you and just makes you the weapon 
---
I really should have got the killers username. I'll keep a look out next time! But thank you for doing this. Seeing freindly killers is always nice in dbd
---
I love doggos man I work with them! 
---
Can we agree that running Ruin is a dick move during this event at least?
---
Under 6’0 = manlet
---
You fail to see how it's anti tunneling? You get a token for hooking every one once. If you want poins you go after the ones that aren't hooked.
---
I have only seen a few people complain about BBQ. If you have such a big problem with being found via BBQ try these helpful things
---
- Hide in a locker
---
- Stay inside the heartbeat area
---
- Use anti aura perks
---
- Run in one direction, count to 4 then double back.
---
No, I'm on PC &lt;/3 But I'm all up for talking about the game and making friends anytime! 
---
You're welcome.
---
The empty lantern hooks aren't very distinctive either... They could at least put some fairy lights on them.  
---
Also, I'll see a light in the distance, oooh lantern lantern, get there and it's a stupid fire or other form of decorative light :(
---
Doggos are the best! If it was a consistent pig, it was very likely me unless there's another kind pig soul out there!! 
---
That said, I'm so glad you had a good time!
---
Ahhh! I was hoping you were on PS4 so we could play together because you seem really cool. Sad, haha. 
---
No, im a survivor main, suck it up and push through ruin
---
I don't know if getting them all is super realistic. 4500 points total, if I did my math right.
---
But yeah, the skins are pretty neat, and I'll definitely at least get the Huntress set.
---
You are just being stupid.I have no more to discuss with you.Point is have fun being in a game for 60 minutes if you do this.While we can stay afk you will still try to get a 4k.Blocked you so I dont get any more trolling replies from you.
---
Prestiging is a waste of time unless you play this game everyday. Especially on killers because earning all the perks again on killer is super grindy and annoying
---
Is it a seperate 5k though? I noticed this too yesterday when I played a few matches but I was under the impression it had just replaced the normal 5k from surviving. :O
---
Also, i think there's an epic rare addon to make her whooshy noise go away?
---
Ive run into Noed, Rancor, and ebony mori more than anytime before lmao
---
No it just had up to a 90% (i think) chance of crows not flying away when you run by them. Counter to spies of the shadows 
---
We did a pretty oink job so far. 
---
Nurse ebony mori.
---
The emotion, not the perk
---
The cosmetics are pretty nice. But Huntress got another ridiculous looking head item which is lame though. 
---
Tunneling is a bad strategy if it was a dumb meme then devs wouldn’t have made it less points when you camp/tunnel vs actually going out and popping people on the hooks. You tunnel because you aren’t a good killer and you can’t get kills otherwise so you feel the need to tunnel. That’s pretty much what your post says to me. 
---
Me: Dead Hard is the worst Exhaustion perk. It provides the least distance, only works when you're injured, and often doesn't work due to lag compensation or long lunges.
---
Other people: lol no ur just bad
---
Also other people: I can't escape the Killer with Dead Hard!  
---
Also other people: Shit the Killer has an instadown(/on-hit Exhaustion) so I can't use Dead Hard!  
---
Also other people: WTF I pushed the Dead Hard button and it didn't work!
---
Me: https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/913/excuse.jpg
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD XD I play too much claudette...
---
I didn’t see the rest of her hand as I was scrolling down so I just thought she had a huge chin
---
tier 3 DS lets you DS 3 times monkaS
---
Yeah good point. Makes it even more sad that they’re bringing ebony moris. Also been seeing Basement leatherfaces...do they not realize basement hooks arent event hooks...
---
Got an Hug so just did this :) 
---
They should just give us a double bloodpoints week for fucks sake. Or at least weekend. Grinding this fucking game is so time absorbing just to get my characters to where I want them to be
---
just use the memeless mode and everyone wins
---
Luckily you can get two out of three of the sets for 2,100 points, cutting the grind in more than half.
---
Good progress! -and even if you don't get too much higher, don't let that bother you! Just enjoy the ride! 
---
The pig is rough, but she also has limited traps, and if you've got a trained eye you can spot her, so it will just come in time! 
---
Huntresses usually do have that advantage, yeah! They have more of a chance to catch just where your blood trails/scratch marks are going I feel. That, and they really -have- to be persistent. There's really no other option for them, because leaving a survivor as a huntress can cost you the whole game because of how slow she is + how far away you can hear her from! That's not even to mention hatchet pit stops! I admire Huntress players, I used to play her when I was more serious, but it's just not worth it to me anymore! Too much to do!
---
If you're in Red Rank you always assume Ruin and BBQ. Just like you always assume certain killers have NOED. Like almost all Low-Tier and Mid-Tier killers.
---
BBQ only helps you find survivors if they don't do anything to counter it. After that it's your looping and Mindgaming skills that comes into play. 
---
This is so positive it makes me wanna high five something
---
Im getting both survivor sets.
---
the difference is killers cannot adapt to a lot of what makes survivors strong. There is no real counterplay to the "survivor meta" except playing nurse or having a lot of moris. Less so now, but still. Many things swing the meta into the survivor's favor even with some of the most depressing things nerfed. Self care is still a thing no one talks about, D-strike is still a thing for some reason, hatch is still survivor sided even when the killer doing well is the only reason it spawns in the first place, SWF exists. But that's just me rambling.
---
I'll give you Legion, but Legion is the exception, not the rule.
---
He's saying two aren't good at all, and the other one has managed to be as good as "meh". Took me a second too. 
---
wow yea you’re such a good human hehe kindness in vidya is very important tbh i really love your post please continue the good work here on the reddit i appreciate 
---
“Putting you back on the hook takes at least one survivor off a gen” 
---
You’d still have 1 survivor off a gen if you hook the other person plus and extra one because the other one is wounded trying to heal and if they find their other teammate to heal them then everyone is off the gens. Stop making excuses for why you tunnel none of what you said can’t be achieved by putting the healthy survivor on the hook as well plus again you get more points and then you have two people with only 2 hooks left. 
---
So as the title says, the last survivor escaped, game didn't end. She came back, I downed her, brought her to the escape hatch, she couldn't leave that way. brought her to the other gate, she left, game still didn't end. I ended up having to hook her to get us out. Anyone run into this before?
---
Imagine a survivor getting away and then healing  when you couldve just downed them instead
---
yeah, that Claudette. 
---
and it really is a tricky situation. well, not this one, this one is crystal clear. rank 1 survivor can't be doing such a thing unintentionally. 
---
Lol 
---
You realize that console bans wont happen unless multiple people  (talking like 10+) report you or you’re a known streamer/youtuber caught doing something bad so that they’re forced to ban you.
---
I was joining games with a part of the ace cosmetic on and the killer instantly dodged...like what is your problem.
---
Dude, stop trolling and get a life. Plus, I wasn't the killer here.
---
Nah, 5 is way better. 
---
your posts say to me "I don't play killer much" or "I can't into math".
---
Lemme spell it out for you: Any points I lose for tunneling someone I make up for with the time that the early kill nets me. Sure I lose out on a few points in the short term, but when I get a 4k because I slowed the game down off of one bad player, it makes up for it.
---
Good killers tunnel when its necessary, because good killers do not care about what the survivors think.
---
True, I guess the event is promoting co-op gens. Time to buy Legion. 
---
i use dead hard a lot and think its inferior to perks like sprint burst or  ... "sprint burst after falling". they are good most of the time. dead hard just isnt. noed or myers happen a lot. bugs happen a lot and then there are ping issues, making timing kind of hard. 
---
I mean, one is playing the game to win and the other is leaving early in attempt to spite the killer, but ok.
---
I refuse to believe that some people would think that getting a lantern and immediately DC'ing is an actual strat.
---
there is. game logs, player hours/level/rank/possibly other reports(because most i'm sure would be in-game reports). taking all the fact to consideration, i believe it's how they can decide if person trolled or genuinely didn't know what else to do. 
---

Something similar happened to the streamer Marth while he was playing nurse and wrecked a team too quickly, the last survivor was crouching around the map and purposefully wasting time. Marth then left his computer and went "to get ready" but actually was just hiding out of sight of his camera and the survivor eventually finished a gen.  Marth then quickly stepped in and zoomed to them and of course they DC'ed -_- can't remember if they were stream sniping also
---
Yeah I see what you mean I just don't like how during this event at least 1 side gets completely screwed over no matter how you play it and with the bonus points you get it's ridiculous 1000 for grabbing it 500 every 45 seconds for a max of 3000 and 5000 for escaping that's 9000 bonus points in the other events you gut that just for doing 2 event objectives
---
I just give up and play killer. Legion with Frank mt so they suffer 
---
Ok
---
Repost no jutsu
---
Honestly the devs tried something different this time is was a good concept but very poorly executed with the fact that like you said the others had equal opportunity yet this one doesnt.
---
Lmao stop crying. Learn how to be a decent killer and you won’t lose all the time and you’ll see you don’t need to tunnel anymore. Yea I am calling you a bad killer because every post and point you’ve tried to make so far has said I’m a bad killer who won’t get a 4K unless I tunnel. That’s literally the gist of every post you’ve made. In every post you’ve stated it’s easier to go for the injured person than the healthy because a chase takes too long lol. That’s saying I’m bad and susceptible to being looped so I need to justify my actions by tunneling so I can get a kill. 
---
The early killers have such awful moris. 
---
Well that's just your opinion I think all 3 are pretty good. 
---
Clearly you need to learn how to be a killer and learn how to mind game people so you’re not susceptible to looping. If you want I’ll give you some tips. Feel free to drop me a DM or add me on PS4 and I’ll run a few KYF games with you to teach you how to be a decent killer lmao. Later bud. 
---
The hitbox “distortion” is packet loss, your player is dragged behind you like one of the screenshot says, and when packet loss occurs he can hit that “ghost” being dragged behind you.
---
People dont realize that unless you’re SWFing, killer gets way more points than survivor this event. All solo survivors do is camp the hatch and hide with urban evasion in corners of the map
---
I mean, sure? Survivor queue is bonkers, anything to balance it a bit. (also Survivors get between 5 to 10k on average per offering. I know its not much and it can all go wrong with a camp or tunnel, but hey, its there) 
---
it looks great! :D
---
that was pretty good. 
---
A lot of survivors don’t work as a team and that’s the problem. Unless the killer is face camping that shits dumb. But if a killer is on his way to the next gen and the dude gets unhooked why the fuck wouldn’t you go for the easy kill. Also if I see some one limping I’m probably going to go after them doesn’t make me a shitty killer makes me fucking efficient. And again that’s on the survivors for not working as a team and healing each other. If survivors actually ran distractions when players were hooked and drew attention away they’d probably win more. But they don’t you will have one other person trying to be a team mate and two other dudes just doing their own thing.
---
Sometimes it just be like that. Often I will see someone moving to the hook.
---
 If I'm in a chase I'm obviously not going to come back, but I'm not always in a chase. And if I'm not and I have no other pressing matters to attend to, I go back to the hook. could just be injured survivors are easier to track, but I usually find them before the unhooker anyways.
---
And if the unhooker is obviously trying to get me to chase them, I don't. Partly to make them mad and partly because if they want that they likely have a trick up their sleeve, and I'll take the easy kill first.
---
Well assuming you can play the game with the bugs that is :) 
---
L O N G D W I G H T
---
They are pretty good but only streamers will earn them all. At least it’s possible, even if it’s not possible for the normal player I guess. 
---
Or you could practice and learn and eventually you can kill the toxic survivors, but naah keep skipping lobbies and never get better
---
I partially agree with what you’re saying there are a lot of idiot survivors. I’m more complaining about killers who go out of their way to tunnel 
---
I.E. I get hooked, killer goes to other side of map starts chase with another survivor, killer sees survivor unhooked, killer breaks chase and bolts back to hook to try and find injured survivor. 
---
Spirit iridescent add ons suck 
---
Wraith have the lamest mori. 
---
Except Bubba has a much better close range mobility and can down up to all four survivors in one swing, if they happen to be so unlucky or stupid to be there.
---
Hahaha, this.
---
I’m gonna be a Feng main from now on because the outfit is so awesome
---
More spirit art 💜
---
Or people might play him, simply because he is fun to play as, not because we have tracking problem, you know.
---
At lower ranks it does get much worse due to lack of players on consoles ... but SWF is simply a matter of filling the slot with what’s available.
---
10 minutes? That’s a dream for me lol
---
Trapper's is worse. He just spanks the Survivor.
---
the fuck
---
"Learn how to be a decent killer!"
---
"But you should stop doing that thing that works because I said so!"
---
???
---
How is doing the easier thing a bad thing? Its optimizing. I've played at high ranks for a long time, I quickly got bored of making things harder on myself simply to please people.
---
I always eat the ds, why save it? May as well get it out the way, like you said they usually go down after ten seconds anyway.
---
Well I'm a rank 1 killer so ruin is kinda needed at the lower rank, and thanat cause the more people you have injured the slower everything goes and you can change the game to fit how you want 
---
I have a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aljuze/megathread_the_moonrise_event_has_started_and_yet/)setup for you, please share your event stories. 
---
I still don't understand how anyone found it funny in the first place.
---
Thanks for the reminder ^^
---
No, this. This is a repost.
---
Because they are just people and people are mostly dumb as shit. 
---
Same.
---
I got Left for dead 2 days ago but two of us escaped.
---
if you could get Bubba with shards I would say him. He is a hoot to play and surprisingly good against disrespectful survivors.
---
Hag isn't my jam but her perks are nice. 
---
Freddy is abysmal and you should forget he exists until they rework him.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAlTOfl9F2w
---
Get over it ms. Poontang
---
You shouldnt be forced to prestiege to participate. Many people don't see a point in prestieging because realistically,it's benefits are small. If that was the answer, the event gives you a temporary reason to prestiege.
---
Sometimes people want all perks on a single character. In my case, I wanna work on my Quentin who is p3 level 47. I can't prestiege and I'm being punished for leveling up the character I wanna play when compared to leveling up a level 1 survivor.
---
I'm already working on some level 1 character. And the fact is that my perks are probably going to be garbage for him, in order to consistently play the offering, I have to play a character with no perks that i want to use because bad event design. 
---
Point made
---
ok so the hitboxes arent right then
---
Yea I agree with you there! Look I’m not one of those entitled survivors who believes you need to play by an unwritten rule ultimately a post on reddit isn’t going to change the mindset of a community in the game but I just take my own personal experiences from playing killer and what I do to be successful and I just feel like if a killer has to tunnel that they really aren’t that good at the game and they also have no problems cheating themselves out of points at all. It could be a lack of understanding or a lack of experiences on their part I just feel like you shouldn’t have to feel the need to tunnel when you can win a game and keep it enjoyable for yourself and other by playing the game the way it was intended to be played. Again if that’s someone’s thing whatever but then I’ll call you out on it.
---
Heehehehehe -Doctor Main
---
Nope. I don't play huntress so I have no real reason to care about the event. Nothing changes for me.
---
Children who gets mad and reports you for being better at the game than them. 
---
If you pallet stun them while they lunge it should play parry noise
---
Hag for the ruin teachable, helps slow down the game
---
The ones that hook someone and then cloak camp, waiting to uncloak and jump on the person who gets unhooked. Most play like this unfortunately 
---
most likely this is all we get. I'm a simple man, I'm enjoying the event simple for the fireworks.
---
Ruin is a waste on Pig, that's what the traps are for. And Thana is such a minor change (Tier 3 4 stack only adds ~11 seconds to a gen) it's pointless and another wasted slot.
---
Why does Vince's head look so tiny in the last frame?
---
FYI, you can click on the players name after the match and message them directly and even say thank you. 🤦‍♂️
---
Ive seen lots of threads on this in the subreddit and its also happening to me. You are not alone. Its so bad my 4 man swf group split up in 2's every night
---
Poor killers 😩🙄
---
Yes!  I had a decent hooky game and actually found a few lanterns, about 25 points.  It's stupid, work so damn hard finding the lanterns etc.. For nothing.  Oooh and guess what?!  I just had a game where I sacrificed someone went straight to a lantern and it wasn't even red!  This happened twice in the same game.  So looks like the last hook for them doesn't let you smash a lantern...!  That ain't fair :(
---
When she said: GG ez, you should have killed.
---
When she said: thank you, it's okay what you've done 
---
Hmm... maybe I will start playing killer and right before the timer gets to 5 seconds back out resetting the queue for all the survivors and they can get a taste of what killer queues used to be.
---
The turntables have turned.
---
Dead Hard is good solely for the fact it lets you make risky saves in the basement/prevent getting basement camped or farmed. Or making a last ditch effort for the exit gate. No other exhaustion perk can do that. The only exhaustion perk thats better is Balanced Landing but its heavily map reliant. Thats why in general dead hard is better.
---
Sprint burst if you’re learning the maps and have bad positioning
---
I think I’m gonna get hag, thank you!
---
Do you draw any rule34 art? Asking for a friend :D
---
Ps4 so there’s no chat 😂
---
Look man like I said ultimately you play the game how you want. Whatever I say to you here isn’t going to change how you ultimately play the game. So you keep doing you but don’t get mad when someone calls you a bad killer. 
---
Nice. I sometimes am the distraction and probably the best of my group running around killers but its nice to sit on a gen while someone else gets chased for a bit lol
---
It has nothing to do with hitboxes lol
---
Huntress may have something to do with hitboxes and how her hatchets have huge ones but all the m1s are a connection issue
---
Fuck haters, Amanda's the best
---
if you want good perks, get hag
---
if you want fun gameplay, get bubba 
---
if you want to spend the rest of your days in horrible agony, get nightmare
---
sorry but you need to hook me first to mori me, and if you're using noed you probably can't without it
---
Ohhhh. Okay, that makes so much more sense now - thanks!
---
It takes like 4 games to get the first cosmetic.
---
The build i have been running lately is BL, prove thyself, bond and DS with a good medkit bc i dont like to count on randoms healing me 
---
Grant us eyes
---
Both sides are too busy screaming at each other over the same shit for the past few years to care what gender we are screaming to.
---
It's 7 pieces more than pre Blight events gave.
---
I can’t find vessels easily and i don’t want to walk around the map for 2 weeks when I could be murdering people.
---
The best solo build is Dead Hard BL Adrenaline and Iron Will
---
3 exhaustion perks lol. Especially if you plan on being the distraction.
---
Did you read the text? I don’t care if you buy I just think it should be timed.
---
The devs do not ban for changing those files. But if EAC flags you and band you the devs will not help you. 
---
No, I've never gone out of me normal gameplay routines for events before, the furthest I'll go is maybe carry a survivor to an event hook if it's in my view, otherwise I either get the bonuses passively or I miss out on them. 
---
Ok then
---
Haha I do. Hardly ever post them.
---
I used to have a Tumblr where I kept all my art but then they shut down :p
---
Survivor toxicity?

Killers are unstoppable right now when it comes to toxicity. I've lost all symoathy for that side. They're doing whatever they can to completely ruin the event for survivors.
---
Why exactly do you feel like Huntress is inconsistent? With the way that windows can fuck the Spirit, she has a really hard time on maps like Haddonfield or Lery's. That isn't to say that she's bad on those maps, she just loses access to some of the tools available to her in a similar way to the Hillbilly. The Huntress can get fucked over by los blockers and has a hard time with corn, but I think the fact that she requires such a completely different mindset while playing against her than any other killer, due to the fact that windows and pallets can actively get you killed, means that someone who really knows how to play her will find her to be incredibly consistent. Although that could be said about most killers as well, but I just feel like it's just a little bit more true for the Nurse the Hillbilly and the Huntress.
---
No because low eFFort or not that shit can still be pretty darn funny.
---
T h i c c
---
I'll tell people to stop encouraging the double standard with kill/gen rush, and start using the post-game chat to give better feedback to your teammates instead of flaming the killer for rushing the objective. 
---
Not that you're necessarily incorrect, but this written exactly how rank 18 killers or people faking write
---
There’s no benefit for killers. The point bonuses in past events at least gave me a reason to burn offerings and think about going for event hooks.

---
Ooooh I didn't even realize! Maybe it was for people running Sprint burst? Though there are still many buttons that aren't currently being used for anything that could have been used.
---
Would it be dead by daylight without stupid decisions like this? Hahaha
---
I feel like she absolutely would
---
I’ll post screenshots for you. Lol. 
---
Everyone will want to play survivor, then the game just stop...!  All around the world, survivors waiting in lobbies, for games that will never ever start XD 
---
Like I said, I wasn’t able to play survivor because of the queue times and so I acknowledge that there are likely respective issues in regards to that side as well, but I have played killer and can definitely say the BP is crap.
---
Do you get points for holding it as well?
---
I thought they meant event points as in "BP gains from event objectives" haha mb
---
the Freddy build is OP
---
Imagine complaining about ruin, hit skill checks, or if you're so boosted gen tap. 
---
But they got away.They deserve to heal.By this logic this guy could call medkits op.
---
It's really not as personal as you're taking it tbh, they're just rushing the objective to increase their chance of winning. Like how you'll finish gens ASAP and rush the one you're on, rather than just touch-and-go each gen because you feel the match is going too fast and the killer isn't having fun. 
---
this balances all the times I’m fully on the other side and moving away from the window and still get hit.
---
Fuck you.You are denying my fun asshole.Why are you more entitled to fun than I am.
---
Maybe you should go at it with a different attitude. Just play the game and get event progress at the same time. If you're being sweaty about it, that's not even fun. Not like the cosmetics are exclusive anyway.. which I really think they should be tbh
---
I kinda lucked out with my high school exams, I had one the week before and the other two the day before.
---
Thanks for the laughs. Much needed!
---
actually such a good idea
---
I was... but I just find that going out of your way to find a lantern to break for just a few extra points... is not really worth it now that I have Huntress’s full set. 
---
well honestly I'm spending 20 minutes to find matches if anything. Sorry, but I haven't gotten less than between 20-30 points on killer(not counting my first match where I didn't know what to do or the matches where no envelopes are burnt). While true I've gotten more in the survivor matches I escaped in, I've also gotten less in the survivor matches I died in.
---
That legitimately seems fair to me. escaped survivors &gt; killers who do good &gt; killers who do bad &gt; dead survivors. While I'll concede that if you escape every single match as survivor you're better off getting points there but it makes no sense that you're getting better payoff dying halfway through a game as a survivor unless you're so awful as killer that you can never kill survivors or destroy any vessels.
---
Might be better to send a support ticket. 
---
Ok. All I'm saying is that you're not writing your thoughts out in a way that inspires confidence is all
---
Survivors are doing the same to Killers, and there's four of them per game. I've seen so many pre hook DCs, denying event points, tons more teabagging and insta-heals, increased DS use, etc. I watched 1 teammate yesterday run the killer for a gen, then chase the Killer when they gave up just to keep flashlight clicking and teabagging them. And I saw **3** Sabo squads, normally a rarity, while playing yesterday.
---
Whatever sympathy you lost for Killers, they lost it 4x faster.
---
Jesus lol you're literally arguing that they're *entitled* to heal....
---
&gt;Fuck you.You are denying my fun asshole.Why are you more entitled to fun than I am.
---
Why are you?
---
Yeah that is incorrect. This was a recent change.
---
Yes that was very nice. But also could have put her in a chase, that way both of you get points. 
---
The lamp! lol! seriously though this event is fun but i don't get mad at the killer for hooking me when i have the lamp, i find that when i have the lamp im forced to play more carefully i don't expect the killer to be like oh!! he has a lamp better fuck off then. 
---
You may have been banned by accident, but lets be honest mate. you prob got banned for hacking/being a pee pee in chat 
---
make some porn while you're at it
---
Posts primarily in /r/OnePiece, calls others weebs, k.
---
You very obviously care a whole fucking lot
---
They are usually not far from hooks and gens anyways. Killers got the better end of the event. I was able to rack up hella blood points as killer without going out of my way 
---
I snorted really hard at this made my day 
---
I think you'd just need to reduce the increase in points per coin(even though it isn't that bad getting all 4500 points). Maybe make it around 75*X instead of 100*X(which would make it 3375).
---
Use Alert. Its the same thing as Windows except better.
---
People usually say she is atleast ok. Do you think i should start working on someone else asap or level pig up? My pig is level 40
---
Basement hooks are not event hooks
---
Not about if you think I’m being honest or that lol that I don’t give a damn about. The other stuff sure I do. 
---
6min later you're at a +3.
---
This post is dumb though. Just report it to BHVR. 
---
Congrats! It’s not that much better in the red, but you might find you get some nice teammates willing to help bossy block or flashlight save for you. It’s nice when it happens. 
---
My thought is NOED is fine as long as Adrenaline stays the way it is. Gotta counter that broken full heal somehow.
---
Your tone is fine. It's the substance of your post that's iffy
---
its ez. just run a pipe build
---
OwO
---
try to play as a killer then 
---
i did, it finally worked. xbox was having issues with downloading games. first time it’s ever happened. 
---
“Stop. What are you doing? Stop.” 😂
---
Well, you can still do well with any killer, until you get closer to rank 1. Just play who you like, practice, and get better perks and you'll get better. Getting a couple kills each game is still good anyway, you don't need to get a 4K. 
---
And the killer doesn’t like playing at high ranks so he’s taking matters in his own hands. Sounds like ur mad
---
My DM’s are open. 
---
Need another large killer
---
Nods Furiously. 
---
Lerys? So Claudette was hiding in the clump of grass on the outer edge? Little butch.
---
Killers get more bloodpoints in general. Survivors only get more points if they escape, which makes sense because that means they played better.
---
Play whatever is fun for you. If you enjoy pig keep playing her, if you’re good at playing killer you can do well with any killer 
---
Hard R? jeez
---
Idk what perks are good. I try to run huntress’ lullaby, but they always find my hex 
---
It looks like he has a daiper on when he slightly bends.
---
If the perk is awful then why does almost every survivor run it?
---
Your post history makes it really obvious that you're a survivor main who, at most, is quite new to killer. Which is fine! But you're trying to act as if that's not the case to strengthen your arguments. Which is not okay.
---
looks like my read was correct
---
You fucking toxic deviant, you mean to tell me that you're still using strong perks and addons, even trying *kill* survivors...? You know there's an event going on, right?
---
I don’t really care about the cosmetics from the even because I don’t play huntress. Not sure why they didn’t widen their cosmetics at least a little more for this event. However, I do still bring event offerings every game and do go destroy lanterns and play the event. Just out of respect I guess
---
Idk if im good or not
---
You get 500 points every 30-60 seconds. Not sure the actual time
---
Not as new as I was and I’m still sitting here at rank 1 as a killer too once again and I actually play killer more than surv anymore. 
---
I think thats the whole point.
---
They've never given away this much loot. Even Hallowed Blight was only meant to have 1 outfit until they caved and gave 2.
---
They want 3 to be ultra hard to get so that they can still make money off it.
---
Just escape with a vessel in 100 games bro, its so easy!!
---
It worked for me earlier when I got the hatch
---
I'm more buggered by my teammates not playing how I want them too lol
---
I Just saw a friendly wraith who helped me learning 360°. Hope you're gonna see it.
---
Love,
---
Jones
---
k
---
I know that. But they should at least make it easier to get just two of he skins. The point gains are so dumb, and the fact that killers and survivors are pitted against each even more this event is even dumber since it increases the toxicity level so much 
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
Yeah new surveillance with clowns pop goes the weasel and hags ruin make a mean combo
---
Trapper is not good for medium skill players like me, but he's not too bad for newbies, and wraith he's terrible for beginners and deserves 2nd worst, and would be worst unless you don't count dlc
---
That is true, but it happens less
---
i feel like the person in after game chat did not give him the salt he wanted so he came on here trying to get survivor mains to be upset
---
So then play until you're gonna die, then d/c. Dont d/c at the start and instantly ruin the game for everyone else involved.
---
What a strange time machine 
---
Sounds like that Claudette I was playing with. One gen left (I did three of them), just her, me, and a Myers with Judith's Tombstone. I stopped counting the length of the chase after 5 minutes; and I did it on the opposite side of the map of the three gens we needed done. He didn't have Tuft of Hair, so he lost his EW3 at the beginning of the chase.
---
When I finally went down, Claudette got OUT of a locker (so she wasn't doing it to avoid BBQ, she was just being useless).
---
Myers proxy camped me so instead of looking for the Hatch, Claudette farmed me.
---
Conclusion: I'm not playing Survivor for at least the rest of the event. If I'm smart I'll never play it again.
---
Oh yea, how could I forget Ruin lol. But yea these 3 make a mean gen pressure build.
---
Lmfao anyone that blocks me is 100% getting the killer run off on them. I get it though, everyone is mad at everyone else, so everyone wants to get revenge. Circle of life
---
Alert instead of technician plz xD Gens are dangerous
---
Nah I actually gave him hatch, just wanted to see some reactions.
---
Wow I’m super dumb. For a second I thought you were playing Michael because of the white border thing alongside the end of the street. I thought it was his knife. 
---
So you arent really good enough to judge.Hag is just Nurse without blinking.If that isnt good I dunno what is.Huntress is very good because she cannot be looped and spirit is a goddamn beast.Your opinion is not an opinion anymore.You are wrong.
---
why is that? is that a bug?
---
It worked for me too
---
I can actually see that lol
---
You all do understand why the points are so hard to get right? its bc people will just want to spend money instead of grinding. BHVR cant act like they did not notice how BAD the grind is.
---
Where are you on PlayStation? 😖
---
Nope, you can only play the killer yourself if you have them unlocked. You can play against them, and all maps are available and random, unless you bring an offering. To try out a DLC killer you can find an ultra rare offering in the bloodweb and use it to have a free match as them. Your perks won't be used for that match.
---
Short matches where there’s very little interaction and/or variety of gameplay are unfun for both sides, definitely.
---
Same right now to be honest.Exams will last until late February for me feelsbadman.
---
The cosmetics are a good excuse to start playing those characters then!
---
I never said that DCing isn't a douche move.  
---
I did say that using IriHead Huntress is though.  
---
Quick FYI: Flashlights aren't nearly as strong as toolboxes and medkits because they can be countered and even used against the survivors.
---
There's a bug megathread and you can make a post that says, "PSA: Wake Up Currently Bugged Not Showing Gate Auras". 
---
Then leave it at that. Don't come back and whine about some downvotes. 
---
You should already be getting that many points with BBQ lol. Before this event I average 80k points on a 4k with Hillbilly using BBQ. 
---
Not Legion. His gameplay and perks aren't worth it.  
---
Jeff or Kate... survivors are just re-skins.  
---
Cosmetics are meh.  
---
If you're using iridescent shards, I'd recommend getting shrine teachables for either bloodpoints or the teachable itself.
---
Take it on the chin and move on. That'll happen sometimes.
---
And yeah survivor has always been a more casual game mode
---
Yep. Lost a couple games today because of this happening at crucial moments in the game
---
So bringing a killer add on is a douche move? In what world
---
Everytime i even think of bringing a medkit in red ranks, the killer d/c's in lobby.  And if 2 people have items, you can bet youre going to verse a nurse or legion with either a mori or at least epic rare add-ons.
---
Thanks! So far the only DLC killer i played against was Myers which i already had, so its just a coincidence in the end (coupled with the fact that i play way more killers than survivors)
---
My philosophy with Huntress' Hatchets.
---
"Can I hit them? Let's try!"
---
sorry op. you're not allowed to use the stuff the devs put in them game. thems the survivor laws
---
That doesn’t makes sense 
---
This is true, as long as all players farm equally and none are targeted, it is not bannable. A DBD mod posted a response with this gist on the forums.
---
You’d be better off reporting it as an issue on the official forums. 
---
You've never seen Jen trash talk? wtf? She trash talks every 2-5 minutes it seems like. Most of it is just to herself but that still counts.
---
Also deranking to 10+ is way different than like 4
---
Thats not even remotely close to what the OP is saying. Running a basement build with an ebony mori and then camping the basement is not “playing the game”. They are obviously doing that to ruin the event experience and make sure one person doesnt get any points. How can you even defend that?
---
Maybe those streamers talking about “reddit killers” were right. Thats actually how people here play. Pathetic.
---
I like how you represented the Wraith with 23 perfectly parallel lines.
---
9/10.
---
Dude, don't even. Billy can do the same exact thing, only difference is that it's a little bit harder. And guess what? If you're playing Survivor's who are gods of doing 360's (or they're just using a macro) they're still a pain in the ass to chainsaw even with Leatherface. 
---
Chainsawing more than one Survivor at a time is so insanely rare that it could be considered as rare as popping a head with the Pig. More effective at low ranks but practically never happens at high rank.
---
He's not quiet enough to be a mime.
---
The long con.
---
They don’t, hitboxes are static and not dynamic. You’re talking about packet loss and hits that shouldn’t hit due to this is connection based not hitboxes. To change hitboxes they’d have to push a small update every time, I’m assuming you never see a Dead by Daylight update without them announcing them. Therefore hitboxes cannot change.
---
Welcome to what console players deal with when trying to play SWF's everyday.
---
No, but bring a killer add-on that pretty much makes you win the game instantly does. Iridescent head Huntress is something I'd put in close second to Omegablink Nurse.
---
Respond to rest of what I said, instead of being selective. So, imagine running around two T-shaped walls with 2 windows in them, that's 6 window jumps until the entity shuts them down. The occasional pallet nearby. Constant looping, even if you cut all corners to get closer. Even if you do the occassional mindgame, because survivors have their third person vision (which the killer obviously does not). How does that make for interesting and fair gameplay?
---
Also, why let him/her run? Do you see a point in that too?
---
90% of the killers I have faced the last week have had NOED. It's crazy. I put on Small Game just to find totems. 
---
Take a look at the front page; it's filled with entitled lil' babies, bitching that they can't get their opponent to "respect" the event and change up their gameplay. Nobody is going to go to bat for some Insidious Leatherface camping the basement, clearly that player is a douche. But OP is asking killer players a general question, not just complaining about that experience. 
---
I'd say so. 
---
Unless a Survivor points or crouches at a hook, letting them live and pip is usually the nice the thing to do. If they do the former, they probably just want to die and move on to a new game.
---
Just like in real life, being nice isn't required but it doesn't cost much and can help other people.
---
I'm try-harding my ass off now. 
---
Played as the Wraith last night and brought bloody party streamers. I rang my bell over and over at the start of the match, let everyone farm the generators, and then they all just bolted out the exit game. Ended up with like 20K total. Since then, I've been running my regular killer builds and trying as hard as possible to 4K every game. 
---
Imagine bringing that add on set up at rank 15
---
BING BONG BING BONG
---
Rip Add-ons LMAO better try get some karma for those at least.
---
If given the opportunity, you can also smack them to dying, and then haul them to a lantern or hatch if nearby and drop them on it.
---
Was gonna downvote u cuz Legion but I do agree that being an asshole as killer will hopefully make more people play killer 
---
How is it shitty at all for survivors?  The alternative is doing gens and opening the gates.  It's apparently much more preferable than just finishing the game the way it was meant to be played for survivors
---
I made a post about my opinion on a video game. Sorry if I offended you in anyway. 
---
and you are suggesting the survivors have the patience to listen to the Leatherface mains?
---
-Clown main
---
I didn’t say it was. But it’s hypocritical to use it as a tactic and then acting like I’m somehow a cheater just for trying to use my perk. 
---
Tbh its a catch 22, killers hate 4 man swf, 4 man swf hate killers dodging. My main thing is at the end game if i see stupid mixes of ranks, like 2 rank 2s and a rank 16 with a rank 7, thats fucking toxicicty at its finest, i understand both sides but theres nothing you can do to safely truly balance it.
---
Waited for 20 minutes to get into a game and this happened.
---
We gave up on playing together.
---
Buy a PC nerd
---
If I'm not trying to kill people, I usually down one, and then pick up/drop them repeatedly on the spot until it automatically makes them escape. I've not had anyone fail to understand yet!
---
You sound like you need a trip to the time out corner. 
---
Well darn, you're probably right. More likely it was legion mains then. I heard that they were getting cozy with Nea mains lately.
---
\-Freddy Main
---
coming from the guy so upset at a random person in a video game that he makes a reddit post complaining about him
---
If you’ve ever played Killer, then you would know it’s quite common to be kind and not too dickish to everyone in the game except for the one asshole using his get-out-of-jail-free card
---
Sweating isn't bad, as long as you don't use bullshit add-ons.
---
They really need to increase BP gain to match the sheer amount of perks in the game. 
---
*nerd*
---
I hate Sprint burst way worse. Literally waste it by accident 90% of the time. 
---
In my defensive build I like balanced landing, dead hard, DS and borrowed time. If you're near a 2nd floor - sweet start looping. If you're not on a balanced landing map use dead hard as insurance if you overextend a pallet loop or to get to the next one.
---
It's best use is basement escape though. When he killer is standing on top trying to tunnel you just dead hard through them when they swings. 
---
It's not perfect, I don't think its meant to be. It's a clutch perk that can act like a mini-ds by not letting you go down. 
---
A really good survivor might not need it but the rest of us who can't mind game like gods dead hard insures you a bit. 
---
Beats me but they’re wrong
---
&lt;3
---
I don't think it's all that serious as anybody "shaming" anyone, honestly. It's a video game and people are gonna bitch about the other side and their way of playing, and I see plenty of people who play killer complaining about gen rushing too. In my opinion, though, it's ultimately up to the developers to make tweaks to the game that promote fun and balanced gameplay. Doesn't mean I can't complain about boosted SWF or tunnelling killers in the meantime.
---
please stop
---
Yeah small game is such a useful perk, but I hate having to run it every game. Especially solo when you aren't sure what the others are doing. 
---
I was just thinking about it, lol
---
thank you &lt;3
---
Did I say I was upset? No. 
---
My post is asking why trapper is so upset, since it’s his fault he lost his game. 
---
But you certainly sound upset. In fact, you seem more upset by a post than I would be at this game. I won after all. I escaped. 100% not upset. 
---
BBBUT dude she’s a female you’re not allowed to hurt someone from this gender please stop hurting them that’s just brutal dude 
---
Status: *Exposed*
---
Really I started Deranking because I wasn’t having any fun at rank 1/2/3. As a killer at those ranks games took forever to end, running no perks people would take 10 minutes to do gens and leave and my time is not endless. Or worse people would go lookin for me afk in basement and just spam taunts and it’s like “why the hell am I concerned with this?” 
---
I also tried touching it out at rank 2 to play the killers I wanted to learn or just any other killer and learn them but against other players who are good the game was over before I could even do anything. Not to mention player BM in general does wear on you constantly and no one should have to be made to feel bad about not doing the most. 
---
IMO getting a deranking killer is frustrating yes, but remember there’s another person on the other end of that controller/mouse and keyboard too and people don’t like deranking unless they’re doing it solely to bully less experienced players. Majority of the time it’s because they aren’t having fun either and are just trying to enjoy the game for their own reason too, and I wouldn’t imagine there’s a person out there who puts other people’s fun over their own. 
---
https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8xqkqs/from_ptb_testing_calm_spirit_does_the_following/#ampf=undefined
---
This is wrong then as well? Apparently this person did all this testing which is completely wrong because “it is wrong”?
---
It depends on how many other players are healthy, really.  DS while 2 are on a hook and one's self caring in the corner?  Who cares.  DS when everyone's healthy?  That's probably a gen.  Delaying it can be really helpful sometimes.  
---
This is why I prefer to save my DS when I'm on death hook unless I think there's an ebony in play. It has actually saved me from death and let me escape once. It also catches killers off guard, because they'll think you missed it but then you strike them decisively.
---
“If you’ve ever played killer”
---
Lmao. 
---
Of course I’ve played killer. And if you read my post, you’d see that I never even got to use my, as you so intelligently implied, “get out of jail free card”. 
---
He slugged. He let me crawl to the hatch. His missed his chance to catch me. His fault. Period. 
---
Yes, but your wording in the post implied dribbling was a toxic thing to do. That’s all I took issue with. DS players deserve no sympathy 
---
You're not losing anything tbh!
---
I like the skins but event is pure shit!
---
Can't get in matches as survivor and playing killer is not profitable.
---
For people that play the normal killers that’s just what the game is, regardless of skill. You run loops and hit each person twice while hoping to get opportunities to disrupt and slow down the others while trying to win the chases you’re in. You run loops until someone makes a mistake you can capitalize on but sometimes no mistakes happen for a very long time and you get no other opportunities, so you just do the loops. 
---
Loop, loop, loop, hit? No, pallet, crack crack, gen poped, it’s too far away for me to do anything, loop, loop, loop, loop, hit? Yes! loop, loop, loop, ect... that’s the whole game, people don’t just let you get a hit on them for free. 
---
I actually almost never see killers complaining to survivors about rushing the objective, it's usually a complaint directed at BHVR with how quickly generators can pop and matches end. In the mean time though while they work on good solutions, maybe you and I and everyone else in the community can do a better job of being aware of the double standard and try not to support it. 
---
Iridescend Head + Infantry Belt + Ebony mori *chuckles*
---
Eat my shorts. Or provide constructive criticism your just a killer main toxic Boi. 
---
It's the same reaction every time, and yet you probably subscribed... :P
---
There isnt a point. Some people are just cunts, they don't play to have fun they play to ruin the fun of other people.
---
Not sure why you factor looping under swf. Good loopers play solo too. Yeah most of the bottom half of the killer roster is shit because they can't do anything at all the ultra safe pallets in the game. I mean you can try to confuse the survivor but you're relying on them to mess up.
---
Just stick with the top 5-6 killers or so.
---
The game is slowly becoming unplayable without dedicated servers.
---
The amount of people that like these memes surprise me. 90 % of them aren't even clever or funny. Typically they involve someone trying to use cheesy urban language to describe the most mundane things in the game. If these memes aren't banned, fine, that is cool.  But they really add 0 value to the subreddit.
---
Gotta love...
---
#Shitty memes
---
LOL. Just when I thought this event couldn't be more bugged.
---
Why not Omegablink Nurse + Ebony :)
---
That was a change in the PTB... it didn’t always do that.... that’s the change that happened...
---
Thanks for proving my point? Lol
---
#People complaining about wait times when this is what console players deal with when trying to play SWF's everyday

I feel the same.

This needs chainsaw sprint noises at the end
---
10 people have fallen for the bait
---
How are you allowing survivors to loop around TL walls and jump through both windows 3 times? At a TL wall you cut it through the middle, pushing them to run around the outside and cutting off the window of the opposing wall. This forces them to go around the T or L, they have two options, vault through same window they just vaulted through, in which case you can moonwalk and hit them or to run through middle of the TL wall to take opposite window to the one they vaulted (you should be able to get a hit here too).
---
Looks like you just copy and paste from Google yourself.

last event the killers just basically had to play normal, but hook on special hooks, while survivors had side objectives. This led to basically survivors throwing the game to do the side objectives while killers could just play normal. It was terrible.
---
So I guess to try to remedy that they tried to give both survivor and killer side objectives. The issue is that killers just don't really have the time to do side objectives, and on top of that it's not even worth the BP to possibly let a generator get done or something if they care about winning. 
---
Meanwhile I burn party streamers, walk around Bing-Bonging the whole match, and let myself be pallet stunned and get death and rape threats, in that order. 
---
I totally agree about making the killer side more appealing for players. Vessels are not highlighted to Killers and they don't score many points unless there are a number of event offerings added to the game. 
---
A survivor just needs to escape with a vessel for 25 points and also gain points for any completed generator. It is also much more appealing when you still get points if other survivors complete generators.
---
The long survivor wait times suggests everything is on the same mindset. They need to up the killer points to attract more players and to increase the number of lobbies. 
---
See the issue here is that you didn't use the pebble. /s
---
There's the common "360" juke but jukes often rely on the killer being bad.  
---
My best advice: improvise.
---
The lanterns are next to impossible to find hahaha. So yeah, people are just doing what they'd normally do. They're probably bringing out all their strongest stuff, too, because survivors are.
---
Don't understand what you're talking about but okay.
---
Yea I know what you mean I am not good at Killer either I am rank 12 right now. I have mostly just say fuck it use it a way to learn on being a better killer by learning from my mistakes. I try not to let them being a bunch of toxic little shits get to me. I always say gg at the end of every game and ignore all the GGEZ and other toxic comments. The thing that sucks the most is when you get a SWF who are like rank 2, 4, 13, and 7 when you are low rank killer.  
---
From my experience, and rarely will you find, is a lot of people swapping roles (killer mains to survivor's etc) and letting others grind for the event points. 
---
Yh but my friends are really low ranks so when I play with them the killers are awful
---
SWF's lobbies have always been broken on PS4.
---
The amount of people saying no are wrong. I personally know 3 different people that were game banned, (not through eac) for this very reason.  Just because some out there haven't been caught yet, doesn't mean it's not bannable.  It is bannable because it is a direct violation of the EULA. This was explicitly explained to my 3 friends that were game banned.
---
"Let that shit just mutilate her white ass and leave!"
---
Honestly just take the ruin games as practice, eventually youll just be good at getting ruin checks.  
---
also similarly to thanataphobia, ruin feels worse than it actually is,  just sit on the gen and try to hit the checks, if you miss a couple its not a big deal.
---
What's the material of the mask?
---
The worst part is, killers are still lobby dodging and dcing when they don’t like the map... it makes the waits even worse. 
---
Honestly it's up to you if the perk stops you from having fun. That said, the reason almost every game feels that way when the Killer uses ruin, is likely due to you have shitty teammates. A good squad of survivors now where to look for totems. Not every survivor ignores gens while looking for ruin, and sometimes if all the survivors are together, they'll power through the first gen or two and then find the totem. 
---
Either way, the higher up you climb in the ranks, the less problems ruin will cause you. It will be used more often, because the point of it is to slow the game down for the killer, but again, you'll be with better survivors and they'll know how to play around ruin. If that's not something you want to do. Then yeah, Dead by Daylight probably isn't the game for you. 
---
stll don‘t get it
---
savage
---
Good survivors will just power through ruin. Ruin is honestly not that strong, it is just a necessity on killers that can't get enough map pressure quickly because it has a chance to slow the game down immensely. Against decent or even above average players, Ruin might do a really good job making the game last a big longer, which is really useful at times.  
---
If you're that tired of a single perk, take a perk of your own to counter it(Small Game) or just bring a map with double range add-ons or range + charges.
---
I was thinking about it tbh, but i wouldnt say better because while windows has a cool down, you can still see if there's pallets around you and make plans there, maybe I'll try running both tbh
---
First time?
---
Friggin awesome! Practice the creepy humming 
---
Yeah, I agree about that but I’ve ran matches for the past six hours and both with a killer or a survivor. I was having the easiest time of my life. 
---
Of course you don't,  your obviously inept.
---
People forget the devs have explicitly said they balanced the bp gains around a killer using addons every game while they balanced survivors around not using an item every game (since they can keep it all if they escape).
---
Dedicated servers are scheduled for a release this summer, hopefully. 
---
This isn't a large patch but it definitely helps.
---
Nurse got a thumper I see.
---
I see your point. With Prove Thyself my SWF always have at least e gennies done before the killer even sees one of us. On the killer side it basically makes the first part of the game either super hard or just regular hard. Then the killer has to cram all of his killing into phase two relying on perks survivors usually complain about ( NoEd ) and others.
---
An ebony mori isn't a slap; it's a response to the enormous tactical advantage SWF groups enjoy. I don't think SWF groups are necessarily toxic, but they *are* going to be tougher than a solo group, so it makes sense to burn rarer add-ons to deal with them.
---
Now, iridescents? *Those* are a slap - reserved for groups that are obviously preparing to be toxic or people on your personal blacklist.
---
Pizza time
---
Good luck keeping the vessel tho. Carrying that thing makes you light up like a fucking Christmas tree so the killer can see you from halfway across the map. 
---
It would be nice if it at least showed the aura of the vessels after hooking someone
---
Worst event this game has ever had by far. Killer side is ridiculous and makes the game just more annoying to play. Survivor side gives coins and some bp but also makes the game more annoying to play.
---
Doubt I'll grind more than 3 coins before just stopping play until the event ends.
---
Yeah but never wait for over an hour broken
---
I'd hire this mf and make him the manager
---
I hadn't considered that. Plus I'm a relatively noobish rank anyway.
---
ewe
---
Power through ruin. Solo survivors dont understand it and cant hit greats either so I understand your pain.
---
I still have bbq invites on my kate lol
---
Just play killer for the event, you’ll probably end up with more points because you don’t have to go against some cunt with a mori
---
Your
---
Nah man my Jake Park has some cattle tags
---
As I said, try improvising. Bait hits, window jukes and fakes, try getting creative with it.
---
Had no luck tonight but it was way better than yesterday. :D still watching out for you guys 
---
it worked well yesterday but now i again don't get any points LMAO
---
Also having this problem on PC
---
Gotta love the DBD Sub. I'd argue but the post sums up your intelligence. 
---
damn thats gotta be pretty far back considering i dont even know what cattle tags are
---
When survivors stop playing swf with instaheals, keys, and decisive then sure
---
I was thinking the same thing. It makes the survivors have to take a risk. Do they want to hold the vessel from the start of the game and risk being tunneled for more bp? Or wait til end game so the killer can't destroy them right away.
---
Oh yeah, this drawing is really good btw.
---
The worst part as well is when you finally get the game to get tunneled and then camped. I mean... you get more points when you hook us more!
---
Jukes are important, but survivors rely on them too often. A good killer (even a decent killer) isn't going to miss that many jukes. It's best to hug walls and corners, and find pallets and windows. Like someone already said, bad killers get juked easily, but that's not going happen once you're past rank 15(?).
---
You were just in a match against a rank 20 Pig on Father Campbell's against a Twitch streamer. How funny I saw this post and happened to be watching the stream that you were in (hexy), thought the Ace looked farmiliar.
---
All the good items like insta heals and keys are lost upon use (or the add on is lost for the key). If you are using infantry belt one shot hatchets and the survivors didnt bring gen rushing toolboxes, a key or an instaheal its not even fair. The point of those add ons is to just tilt the game heavily in the killers favor.
---
I don't need all 9 - I want Ace's complete outfit but got Min's hair immediately because it is perfect. After that, I'll get as much of Huntress's gear as I can, but I can take or leave the mask.
---
They are basically brown map offerings I have one of each because they hold a memory in my heart because they don't spawn anymore
---
That’s just like, your opinion man.
---
Oooooooold as shit non-green Cooldwind map offering.
---
You're saying that as if every game has instaheals.  
---
Key's aren't strong and decisive could be dealt with in separate ways(still annoying like every second chance perk).
---
Actually he messaged me after that he did it specifically so i would die.
---
Omega is a letter. Shouldnt it be pentablink?
---
That’s like saying NOED player deserve no sympathy. He had that too. 
---
I wait in every lobby till I fell asleep. It's so annoying right now
---
u qualify for a veterans discount
---
Did they recycle that McDonald's sign out of a bunch of other McDonald's signs? I've never seen one with the name textured throughout it like that.
---
I think it's more that they are finding a lot of people saying to the contrary of what you're saying. So it's harder to believe you, random person on the internet vs the larger group of random people on the internet.
---
But the Wiki entry pretty much sells it for you being right. 
---
Dude this sub is toxic af I did not realize.
---
However, I'm not really bothered by your comments.. So, nice to meet you. :-)
---
[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
Understandable, have a great day.
---
Why they didn't add an aura for the lanterns for killers after hooking a survivor is beyond me. By the time you find one the survivor is unhooked. Since you've already walked past a couple empty lantern posts.
---
Just gonna drop by and say you're both wrong.
---
Calm Spirit was changed last July, so with regards to those other threads you're just flat out wrong. It's what happens when you don't read I guess.
---
But you're right in that it wasn't always like that so good for you?
---
wow they patched the one thing that made the event a little better
---
The Doc fix is nice, knowing when you'll tier up is very useful. Disappointed they fixed the lantern escape bug, was hoping to rapidly farm points tonight. Oh well.
---
When your thigh tumors enlarge from how fucking cancer the clown is
---
Yeah, of course you’re gonna find a lot about it stopping screaming now, but like I said, it didn’t ALWAYS stop screaming
---
If you are having troubles with ruin, run stakeout to help with the skillchecks, run small game to help hunt for the totem, or simply brush up on your skillcheck game. [http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/](http://www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/) is a great place to practice if you need that.
---
I'm fairly certain that the other people that you are playing with at rank 5 simply don't care about dealing with ruin as they are good rushing the gens even with it active. Or are simply unable to memorize totem locations to check and don't want to do more trouble to gens that is worth.
---
However the underlying reason ruin is run so often is due to the massive amount of genrushing that it can prevent. No killer wants a 5 minute game because the survivors just genrushed the entire game then everyone pops adrenaline. That is not a game many killers can gain a foothold in and we use Ruin as a bandaid fix for that issue. 
---
Try playing killer at rank 5 without ruin. The massive amount of games that take 10 minutes from start to end are just discouraging. Ruin in its current state is almost required with any killer that isn't nurse or hillbilly. 
---
First costume or first piece of a costume? Cause I was playing all day yesterday and only got 1 coin.
---
Buy Spirit, she’s fun! And by the time the new killer comes, you should have enough shards! 
---
but like why 
---
I didn't mean 5 blinks.  
---
Double range add-ons are stronger.
---
That seems to be the intent - give the hardcore players something to work toward but make sure even casual players can earn a set or two - and maybe support the devs by buying the third if they're so inclined. 
---
My only (minor) gripe is that they didn't push to license cosmetics for Amanda. It *is,* after all, the Year of the Pig.
---
👌
---
She's ripping off the trapper! Holding her traps in her hand and everything!
---
Funny how somebody made a joke about that yesterday, and yet here we are.
---
Well oof
---
there's a very inconsistent thing you can do at a pallet, I dont know how to really explain it but once the killer breaks it you have a short window to run through the side and go behind them. 
---
I think Ussylis covered it in one of his vids. 
---
Not to mention it's bugged right now where if the first survivor gets out with a lantern, every survivor in the game gets 45 points even if they die later. What a joke for killers.
---
I think the bp gain of this event is just fine. Survivors actually getting bloodpoints for once is nice. It might look small but those 500 points stack up the longer you hold the lantern. I've been ending games with 30k to 40k bp as survivor consistently, and that's far better than how it's been in the past. It's high risk, high reward, and I actually kinda love it. 
---
Killers haven't really changed much point-wise, but they also have a very effective way to double their bp regardless. It's a lot less risky playing killer, but there's less rewards, and I feel like this was to make playing survivor or killer an actual choice, unlike the hallowed blight event. 
---
wow what a dickhead 
---
It's actually the only one I don't particularly like (although that hair is probably the best that has ever been released for any survivor and goes well with any of her other outfits).
---
How am I wrong? I said Calm Sprit has been in the game since July, and it was changed, so a wiki entry from September 2018 is updated.
---
ya it made it so survivors would show some kind of teamwork now it will just be sandbagging. hopefully if enough ppl complain they will revert it 
---
That's fair. 
---
I honestly had no idea it stopped screaming. I fucking hate Doc so that shit's good to know.
---
Dude... who hurt you
---
Most players are playing Survivor for the event, so Killer's are hard to come by. This causes extended wait times and the game to match you with more distant Killers causing increased latency.
---
Yeah, I don't care about 4ks either. There's only been a few times that I have cared, and that's because I had a personal vendetta against the team I was against.
---
Perk: Blood Echoes. After performing a certain amount of ability-based attacks, your terror radius would briefly become narrowed on a single survivor with the red stain on them during the duration, All other survivor's scratch marks become invisible until the effect ends.
---
So you wish for him to play Dead By Daylight?
---
Through Steam? The matchmaking used to work via Steam location, but it doesn't anymore so without meaning to sound rude, I don't think that's what fixed it. It would still be trying to pull games from the region you actually are in.
---
Eg: I'm in New Zealand, but I have my Steam set to Canada too from a while back, but I still match with people from NZ/Aus.
---
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if it's literally just started working again, matchmaking issues in the past have had a habit of magically fixing themselves. Glad to hear it's working though!
---
To be a toxic little shit. Just mlga block her and if you want save her profile information. Next time you see her mori spam.
---
Normally i'm quite good at getting the ruin checks but unfortunately it's not always the case :/
---
Wish you were my killer. All I've gotten today are sweaty, try-hardest Huntresses. 
---
I'd like to think the 'How?' is about Rin's ass, not the floating limbs.
---
Tier 3 let’s you *kill the killer*
---
Exactly why they did it. This whole event is intended to be incredibly slow and frustrate you enough to spend the $30 to just buy the skins. 
---
That's why survivor and killer objectives are mutually exclusive. That's why the event point gain is so low. That's why it takes **4500 GODDAMN EVENT POINTS TO GET ALL 9 COSMETIC PIECES!**
---
Thats a good idea i'll give that a go
---
Dwight when he sees Nea
---
That just got hot fixed.
---
And then it went live with patch 2.1.0 on the 24th of July 2018.
---
But I get our misunderstanding: It hasn’t always works like that from 2016 on. 
---
I have been playing since August 2018 so for me it has always worked like it works now. 
---
And in reference to the comment I replied to (courtnovo's comment) it is just wrong because the changes to Calm Spirit are not a *recent* nerf to Doctor as they have been in game since summer 2018. 
---
So I don’t get the “current Doctor nerfs due to calm spirit” thing.
---
Honestly I just hate the toxicity of the game amd I hate when people point the finger at survivors or killers because it's both sides. Wish things were different but what can you do.
---
You can juke a killer of any skill level (amount of hours) as soon as they don't expect it. Tho it will definitely not work multiple times on good killers (over 1k hours) 
---
That would also break the game. People would just DC once they thought there was no chance of getting 5 gens.
---
&gt; I said Calm Sprit has been in the game since July
---
Ok well it's been in the game for way longer than that, now you're just making up shit.
---
The wiki was "last edited" in September which could mean anything, but patch 2.1.0 was out much earlier.
---
Cool it.
---
The devs said they balanced killers bp and power level to assume they are using addons. Thats not speculation or up for debate. Its a fact.
---
Underated comment
---
:Thonk:
---
I haven't come across many nasty people while playing, except for one.
---
Got a message after a match from the killer, straight up asking if I would email him pictures of my feet because I was beautiful and exquisite. 
---
Sad night for him though, for he did not receive a single toe.
---
Aptly named because when I use it, the killer knows I try. Then I die hard. Thx team for crouching and hiding in bushes...^(Claudette). 
---
You won't get banned for a single report, and taking advantage of a Killer's "generosity" isn't against the rules. 
---
Ok, so I don't look down on people that do this, but it's kind of a crutch. I'm not a noob myself. I never use NOED unless it's on a killer that I have no other good perks on. I never use mori's unless I get a super toxic game. I also recently stopped using ruin on most of the killers that I play regularly.  I also rarely use super good add-ons. Still 4k, get rekt survivors.
---
Its not a bug. basement hooks aren't event hooks.
---
sorry to say this, but PS4 waiting times have been horrible for most of us. it has nothing to do with you, it's just this game itself
---
It's just the way it makes the game go tbh I never seem to get the team mates that "power through it" like a lot of people here have said
---
Told them to delete the thread. 
---
&gt;Every killer is running ebony Mori, iron grasp and agitation. **Carried right to the basement, camped, and moried if someone happens to try to get me.**
---
&gt;Is there any reason killers are playing this way? They clearly aren't getting event points, and are simply ruining the game at this point. Can someone please enlighten me as to the idea behind this play style? **I'm not asking to escape or be given gens**, etc. I'm just wondering why no single killer seems to be playing the event.
---
Let me quote the OP because it seems like you didnt read any of it. I even bolded some key parts of the OP for you. There are killers who are running builds or playing in a certain way for the sole purpose of ruining the event and making sure one survivor gets no event points.
---
No one cares about killers playing normally because the event was structured so that you could complete it in two weeks through normal gameplay. There are both survivors and killers purposely trying to ruin the event by playing in a scumbag toxic way. I’ve never seen more urban evasion hatch camping survivors or basment hooking proxy camping killers ever in my time playing this game. Seems like this community is filled with a bunch of babies with a victim mentality and like to “punish” the other side or their solo queue survivors for whatever weird reason.
---
Nobody said they were entitled. The point of this video is that they literally *can't do anything or go anywhere or even try to jump in the hatch* because the killer blocked them in the corner. The survivor literally had to sit there in the game or just DC. Apparently you've never been held hostage before in this game. Nothing to do with the hatch.
---
The I-Head + Belt was a joke I believe, if that's what you're referring to.
---
Dodging is always going to exist in the game. Firstly because there are legitimate reasons to dodge - mainly for ping. I promise they aren't dodging you because of p3 (this is got to be a myth seriously who gives a shit about P3 clothing?). Killers are probably dodging because they suspect SWF and since survs que up at the same time now more or less, it can be hard to distinguish if the lobby is SWF or not, so some killers will just not risk it and back out. That or they see too many toolboxes.
---
Keeping survivor items and the survs themselves hidden is just stupid tbh. I think that's an important area of balance to let the killer prepare for the game by seeing what survs bring in. A four man flashlight and a four man toolbox game are going to be different and the killer should know that going in given they are the single role. 
---
I know getting dodged is frustrating, but it's a reflection of the greater problems in this game. I won't play a lobby that looks like it won't be fun and a lot of others share that sentiment.
---

---
My least favorite part is for me to gain extra bps at all I have to use the offering. Which I get once a web, and when I do burn it. It’s almost always a guaranteed dc from a teammate or killer plays like a jerk and you get nothing. A wasted offering and less than 20k how toward that next web you have to fill. Just frustrating how many offerings were completely wasted
---
I'd agree with just NOED removed, it's a perk that rewards bad gameplay, much like rancor.
---
Love killers like you during the event. Yesterday during a game, 3 of my teammates DC'ed against the Wraith. Mind you I was the only 1 who did a gen and then was keeping the killer busy. In the end when he was coming back to me I just was crouched and bobbing my head up and down - praying to the Entity that he would show mercy, and he did! He let me do 1 more gen to then find the hatch and escape WITH the lantern item. :) 
---
To the Wraith who was in the game from yesterday on PS4, you're awesome! &lt;3
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/17318604/r
---
I wish I was able to send the poll to only Killer players because I'm sure that some DS users voted in protest because they know just how OP DS actually is and would rather deal with NOED if given the choice. 
---
That was the whole reason I got back on surv during the event anyways. And we get shit bloodpoints all around anyways.
---
*sigh*
---
Yeah i recommend not solo queuing as a survivor this event. But then you have to deal with 10 min queue times and lobby dodgers as a SWF lol.
---
Ah, typo. Meant to say 2016, am stupid.
---
The change happened in July, which places your wiki from September after the change, confirming what I said.
---
Ochido’s experience with the huntress 
---
Yeah seriously, don’t push yourself being altruistic. Three things usually happen, everything goes well (not likely), the person you’re saving dies and blames you, or the killer takes you instead. I don’t about you but I don’t like those odds.
---
Oh yeah, they've been terrible for me when I play survivor lately, my problem is the game's been kicking me from playing killer since I got the game with connection errors so I rarely get to create a lobby. I've spent ages trying to fix it but barely anything works. I just wish there was a solution on the way for all of this. 
---
Your fault for readying up when you saw you had 400 ping in the lobby.
---
I try really hard not to get salty but I reported some dude today for body blocking the exit door handle. He sounded the alarm, canceled and started crouching in front. I still escaped but this was infuriating.
---
You say that but majority of games when ruin is one they don't handle ruin well... literally most games i play with ruin 1 gen will get done max, I appreciate peoples advice and outlook but honestly this idea that it can be "powered through" is almost never apparent for other survivors
---
Omg I am so sorry, gamer girls are so hard to come by, maybe if I am nice she will want to vore me. You are so right my gamer fellow, how could I act this way
---
I was about to say it would be funnier if it was wriath but i now understand
---
Team game for fun. Playing and risking yourself is the fun in this game(for me at least) as survivor. I don't see a point holding M1 on gens the whole game, why not play a singleplayer game at that point?  
---
Besides, would you like people to just not save you, ever? No, it's incredibly frustrating. 
---
Yeah I agree on that point, OP doesn’t know what he’s talking about lol
---
100% not upset that you felt the need to tell everyone on reddit. Definitely not upset. Just laugh at the loser and move on.
---
For me, P3 clothing itself isn’t a problem, but on a character like claudette who’s already hard to see? I’d rather back out than strain my eyes with that mess. 
---
It’s fixed for me. I’ve earned 3 coins with playing both killer and survivor. 
---
None of the things you said are true, at least for me.
---
Is it really that bad? I was playing exclusively survivor last night with my friends to see just how terrible survivor is, and I ran into 1 NOED and one Ivory Mori. Out of about 30 games, I’d say that’s pretty good.
---
Live for the thrill of it, it's fun, it's exciting, this is what makes the game enjoyable to me. Sometimes you do need to know when to lay back and do a gen though.
---
That's what I'm saying. 
---
This is so wholesome, very cute!
---
I actually agree with you. I am saying you should work together. But we don't HAVE too work together. I am not saying that I just play solo style. I am saying however. I don't HAVE to save them in EVERY situation like this guy seems to think. He seems think that since we're all survivors we must 100% of the time try to save each other. Sometimes. You have to get a gen and hope the other two do it. It benefits us greatly to work together but at the end of the day if it's too risky. I don't have to help you.
---
Wise man say: Drop clock in toilet, have shitty time.
---
SO I was going to start a new threat but meh
---
Things wrong with this event.
---
Point Balancing between Killer and Survivor - Survivor has a better chance for points then killer by far.
---
Wait Time Per Que - because of unbalance people are playing Survivor over killer.
---
Diminishing Returns on coins - Honestly what idiot thought this would be good with the point balance?
---
Long story short, I used a plasticine model, covered the model in paper towels and Pva glue, finished it in acrylic wood putty, and sanded it down to be smoother. Basically I watched a vid on YouTube. If you wanna check it out, the channel is called “Goryashchiyeklyuchi”. Took me 7 tries to make the final one, so it wasn’t easy.
---
sorry sweaty, it's yourn'tsv'ent're\*
---
It’s reddit, and it was marked as a shitpost. You chose to read it, buddy. Chose to comment to. The only person wasting their time is you, it seems. 
---
&gt;Sounds like a salty survivor that get destroyed by a legion x
---
sounds like someone who never faced a moonwalker legion
---
Third time’s the charm I guess
---
I kinda wanna buy her, but I also don't now if I will have the time to get all those shards again... I feel like the new killer might be stronger and I will regret buying her like I did when bought clown and she got released 2 weeks later.
---
At least you got pie :)
---
I'll definitely give that a try, Thanks :)

Hmmm...what you're describing doesn't sound like players who are at or near rank 5 but I'm not with you, so I don't know. That said, if they truly are as bad as you're making them out to be, then you'll have to do it alone. Bring perks and add-ons to repair faster/more efficient or to find the totem. Again, if that's not a challenge you want to take on, that's fine. Maybe Dead by Daylight isn't for you. 
---
I dunno, but it looks cool
---
It never even began for you bro, sorry :/.
---
Simply not true. Survivors get points faster. Only one survivor needs to escape with vessel and all remaining survivors get 45 points.
---
Only 91 votes.....
---
Just play pig so you can teabag them back when they are on that sweet meathook.
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[Can you still get vessels and escape with them without the red envelope offering?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/alv1dh/can_you_still_get_vessels_and_escape_with_them/))
---
It depends on the type of killer really. 
---
If the killer is more mobile, there’s a good chance to find and get rid of the totem ezpz. 
---
Then there’s the totem babysitters. A good crew will gen tap while one person constantly goes over and tried to break it, constantly bringing the babysitter back while everyone else gets gens done. 
---
Hags and trappers will trap their ruins of course. Hags the the absolute worst hex babysitters unless you’ve got a flashlight. Someone who babysits AND has traps AND has Thrill of the Hunt is the absolute worst because they can get the farthest from the totems and be able to get back to protect them. 
---
Gen tapping is your friend at that point. Get them away from the totems and take them out. 
---
Nope
---
Still pretty freaking lame. A hook is a hook.
---
Completely agree
---
Can you still get vessels and escape with them without the red envelope offering?
---
I still have common auto haven offerings on Billy from beta
---
My huntress has some common maps offerings :/ it’s been a while 
---
I'm not finding any fun killers or survivors. It's all try hards and NOEDS and three ds in one game. I had a 2 man and I tried taking Jake to my ruin so they could get gens done faster and he ran off taking it all serious. Like there's two of you if Yandere Spirit wanted you dead you would've been by now.
---
Good players can just hit the great skill check. It's not that hard. 
---
In potato games it does suck though cause by the  time ruin is found there's still 5 gen and 2 are hooked.
---
11k extra is not that good tbh, you used to get 22500 each game during summer event, you're better of using an escape cake
---
NOED doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve done bad an entire game. Some killers run it without ever needing it. Also I feel like honestly it’s best used when facing a group of SWF because that’s where there’s the most altruism and it doesn’t matter how good a killer is a full squad of SWF is usually just annoying to deal with. Especially the toxic ones. I honestly don’t care if anyone uses either, they’re in the game to be used. And as much as people complain about cleansing totems I never have a difficult time finding dull totems and cleansing them. It really has little to no impact on gen progress. And if I’m playing killer and someone is running DS I’ll make sure I get it out of the way ASAP. 
---
I still have the common bloody party streamer in my Jake's bloodweb I refuse to level him up for that reason alone
---
It's not fun to play against, and ridiculously op. Are you seriously whining at the survivors because they didn't want to stay in a game that never had the potential to be fun in the first place?
---
I always hit my ds 😎
---
Event points don't count toward the trial limit, so that 32k can very quickly become 40k or more.
---
i swear if it doesn't do the image i quit
---
This ^
---
I voted no because I like to be as toxic as possible when I play survivor.
---
At least you couldn't buy those in the store afterwards :)
---
This isn't the first event
---
I’ve been running small game since the update just to get used to exactly where the new totems placements are, and honestly I find Ruin within one loop of the map. It’s also really good against trapper and hag since it alerts you to their traps. 
---
I get your pain though, pretty much every killer in rank 3-8 will have at least 2 or 3 of the crutch perks: ruin, noed, bbq, nurses, with ruin being the most popular in my experience. 
---
At least she has a challange now...? Cute!
---
Tryin to cash in on that wraith post I see.
---
I know, but the guy says he averaged 80k before the event.
---
EVERY. FRICKING. TIME. 
---
Where were they?
---
I just see a p3 Claudette
---
I think its worth mentioning that I was going to have one of the Nurses dragging Claudette over to help heal ;p
---
Stream name?
---
I love losing my points when your typical trash player DC's.... this game has gone to shit 
---
**Balance Changes**: 
---
* Adam Francis is now very tiny. He will no longer be able to vault windows, but can hide with greater ease. One hit from the Killer will instantly crush him.
---
**Cosmetic Changes**:
---
* Laurie Strode's character model has been replaced with Claudette Morel's character model until the new Laurie Strode model is finished.
---
Damn, I'm glad I at least got one costume before. If they want to make people actually focus on lamps they should make the red envelope appear as often as the blight canker petals did, I need to fill out a full lvl50 bloodweb just to get 1.
---
Psst. Break the totems.
---
He’s saying it’s his first event
---

BHVR and breaking everything on their grindy, nonrewarding events.
---

---
You forgot “using NOED”
---
:)
---
more like facecamping, proxy camping and getting mad at “looping survivors”.
---
Catch any fish with that bait?
---
ew wtf
---
My Ace used to have a map darkening offering before I ~~used the prestige glitch~~ prestiged him perfectly legitimately.
---
i mean. sure. but im talking about toxicity based on the individual being a girl.
---
“verify the integrity of the game cache”
---
yup, there are only hints
---
I think Billy's Mori is fine, because with a chainsaw that's pretty brutal. Wraiths, and Trappers are way to similar though, and boil down to smack the survivors back a couple of times. They don't have any character to it, unlike, say, the Hag. 
---
People comparing DS to NOED is just sad. You have to be good to get the best usage out of DS while you have to be bad to get good usage out of NOED. The two arent even really comparable.
---
Killers got the short end of the stick on the event, making usual killer players move to survivors to get coins 
---
;)
---
We're you downed on the hatch?
---
Altruistic SWF are the easiest games on earth. They never do any gens and just crouch behind a rock by the hook waiting for you to leave
---
Huntress has bigger dick energy than Freddy. 
---
I never realized how elongated the Wraith was till seeing this. 
---
Yeah I didnt get the lantern point for last 2 games on ps4. Restarting the game fixed it, give it a go. 
---
Thanks for the big tip, I will definitely use it.
---
No. I was downed far enough away that I couldn’t even hear the hatch. I just guessed a direction to crawl in and got lucky. He stood on top of me the entire way. 
---
Thx for the answers, I think I'm gonna buy her rn
---
Well... we had that for like... a year or so? On PC. It was pain. I still cri eviritim when I think about it. I guess we PC players feel ya. :P
---
Have fun waiting 20 minutes looking for the last survivor unless you run whispers.
---
*slaps purple windstorm*
---
This beauty can pull out so much map pressure!
---
&gt; Proxy camping
---
AKA knowing someone is positioned for a save and looking for them
---
yeah. i was in vc with this guy once along with two other people for like one hour. then he bought me some skins in League of Legends for around 25 USD in total. without telling me. next day he messaged me and asked me to move in with me and talked about how we'd handle rent and plane ticket etc. and he said that i basically owed him because he bought me skins i never asked for
---
i have no clue what guys expect tbh
---
Hell not even SWF, just cueing up for a solo is a grind a lot of the time
---
using perks.
---
Oh well if you are on the ground when you jump in the hatch the killer can't grab you
---
Solo queue survivors cant even work on generators, you want them to also break 5 totems?
---
u realize there's a difference between regular toxicity and sexism, right
---
Don't forget checking your gens
---
"gen camping" lol
---
I will say, I think lowly of people who run Dying Light tho
---
I once got hooked trying to save a team mate from a basement when I could just escape with the vessel.  It turned out Michael was insidious hiding in the basement waiting for anyone to save the hooked person.
---
In this case though, I'm glad I went for the save. I brought a key with the intention of using it for the hatch but I couldn't for the life of me figure out when the hatch will appear.  So I was shocked when it showed up in front of the hooked survivor.
---
The whole thing happened so fast after that I wondered how the other players felt, especially Michael's.  It was a rush for sure.
---
Nothing for the console killer frame rate issue? Nearly unplayable on Xbox especially with Billy
---
Thx for the answer, the legion got released pretty weak, and I think spirit is still better than him, so that may be true... I think I'm gonna buy her!
---
i expected better trolling from this subreddit
---
Pretty sure he can..... I’ll have to double check. He still could have picked me up at any time. 
---
Hitboxes may be static, but when an object is moving it does dumb shit to the hitbox, this is evident in EVERG GAME EVER. I'm literally 1 year away from a degree in computer networking, I don't need you to explain packet loss like I'm five.
---
Yeah, it was an interesting choice to not give them aura while they're breakable.
---
Yeah they can pick you up but if you jump in they can't grab you out unless you are healthy or injured
---
Not to mention, there are fewer offerings per bloodweb. I've only seen one per web, and I'm not making enough bloodpoints per game to clear a web.
---
T_T why change the progress "bug". It was actually good for the event.
---
I mean, you can leave if you’re not having fun. 
---
Honestly just rework DS so you have to do something to unlock it, similar to with Deliverance and you also wouldn't be able to "save" the DS, you'd have to use immediately or miss
---
Is the turtle perk empathy?
---
Wrong color bro
---
aka not knowing how to apply pressure other than hooking someone and letting all the generators get done while that one guy dies.
---
Killer perks basically fall into one of four categories: tracking perks to make it easier to find survivors, chase perks to make them go down faster, delay perks to draw out the game and buy the Killer time, and endgame perks for when the first three don't work.
---
Ruin is a strong example of a delaying perk. It does its job well, but it's not game-breaking - the survivors have clear, straightforward counter-play. 
---
So does almost every perk in the game, really. The only one that doesn't? Decisive Strike.
---
Okay. Just leave as soon as the exit gates are powered, don't bother with saving anyone. Or, better yet, cleanse any dull totems you come across. NOED is only deplorable on certain Killers, anyways. For Trapper it's just a perk that makes sense, given his playstyle. 
---
I'm sick and tired of hearing that NoeD is a reward for "playing badly the whole game". Games might reach the endgame because survivors are simply good at looping, or you are playing against immersed players, or they are in a SWF and manage to spread out the generators perfectly and there isn't a whole lot a killer can do about that. Sure they can keep up the pressure, but that's hardly "playing bad the whole game", one could have killed two survivors by the time the last generator pops; my point is that there are way better reasons for why NoeD is a compleatly unfun perk, like the fact that it's only telegraph is the killer moving SLIGHTLY faster, for being absoluetly unfun to be at the recieving end of or, my favourite one, it promotes a care-free playstyle in which you get to magically win because the survivors compleated their objective (same thing can be applied to DS or, god forbid people actually talk about how badly designed this perk is, Adrenaline)
---
I wish I was having killers like that. At rank 1 my killers are ruthless and it feels like they're trying harder than usual. I'm also on console though and most console players are potato
---
I got a BBQ Invitation for my bill yesterday lol
---
I mean they do have every right to. And especially if they sense SWF it's lame to leave but understandable.
---
Using NOED counts for its own slot.
---
The difference is you can combat this type of slugging situation and continue the game, the killer can do nothing to stop a disconnect. There is no mini-game or chase to stop you from disconnecting. You're taking a measure that brings things outside of the game to give your teammate an advantage. You're not using actual gameplay mechanics to combat the killer, you're using your connection to combat the killer. It's really not much different from a killer that disconnects if they don't get a hook before the first gen is complete, both are just cop outs of a difficult situation.
---
eat. the. mother. fucking. soup.
---
Except a good survivor isn't going to use DS because they won't let the killer down them.
---
Can't remove DS unless they have a new teachable ready to slap on Laurie so a moderate nerf to both instead?
---
Wouldn't mind if DS's non-obsession part was nerfed into something like 80/70/60% Wiggle bar to get a skill check for a 1.5 second stun
---
Fair enough they will be stronger with the communication advantage, but it is an online game and people will want to play together just to enjoy the game. I just get frustrated when we wait forever and then get mori'd instantly and have to wait 40 mins for another game, makes me not want to play anymore tbh 
---
Chat? No i avoid it,been insulted, threatened so Many Time There, i doubt people get banned over it.
---
That’s technically what decisive strike should be used for, to try and prevent a third hook. That’s how I try and use it, at least if I decide to run it, which is rare
---
I had a match the other day as jump scare Myers on Léry's, and the first person I found was my obsession. They dc with no progress on any gens activating dying light. Now I don't even think of running it.
---
That shit was at 200 until the final countdown when it spiked to 500.
---
I watch Gameplays of people playing as her, I just learned how to play legion so I think learning spirit won't be a bad experience! (No school girl fetish here lol)

I'm a fairly new player so I have no idea what the last Lunar event was like, but I did find it really odd when reading the pre-event summaries that it would all be implemented into the regular game mode. I guess that's easier than making a separate game mode when the event doesn't last all that long, but it's still an odd choice in my book.   
---
I've been seeing a lot of unfair play and unsportsmanship so far during this event, it's really been unfair on the survivor end but thanks to both parties, either a killer that hands around too much or a selfish teammate. I know this kind of thing has a tendency to happen with BP events etc but it's been a little more out of control this time. While I never expect killers to go easy on us survivors, it's nice some are going out of their way to counter all the current camping shenanigans going on. Hopefully people will still end up getting the cosmetics they were after, even if it's just the one. 
---
I don't get it. I think that this event is one of the most successful if not THE most successful event design-wise. Survivors can potentially carry more event points from the game than killer which gives survivors reason to play and not jump on the killer for quick event points farm like last event with nectar. On the other hand killer gets less event points BUT farms more bloodpoints than survivor, thus both sides have benefits and rewards and it helps the player distrubition between sides even. Gameplay-wise lamps are good destraction for a killer and gives him a reason to roam after he hooks a survivor thus lowering the chances of camping and for survivors it's a good distraction that slows the game and lowers the chance of genrush. At the same time lamps are not that big of a distraction to actually distract from the main goals of the game which is good for people who do not really care about them. And it is very good that you still able to progress with event even when completely ignoring the event mechanic. I think this event is amazing and very well thought out.
---
This was fixed :(
---
So in total? Like 100+100+100 etc?
---
This. NOED gives Survivors a choice - totem hunt to prevent the perk from going off at end game (but buying the Killer time), or rushing the objective (but risking being Exposed at endgame).
---
Decisive Strike offers no such choice. There isn't a gameplay option for the Killer to deal with it; they just have to get lucky or eat it and go chase some more.
---
yup really stupid in my opinion. all this will do is make ppl sandbag each other and I cannot honestly blame them. at least how it was before you had teamwork

Well, that doesn't deny the fact Bubba actually a LOT easier then billy. Plus 360 work only so often. You must be a potato(don't mean exactly you) to fall for this more then once or twice. I played both billy and bubba for a long time and in my opinion, bubba still very valuable at red ranks and still easier the billy. But, that's my impression, I do not force it upon anyone.

Why would his ping be 400 if he's using mcd wifi? Wifi makes it so your ping is bouncy, even 20-100 ping spiking back and forth is leagues worse than 300 stable ping.
---
Yeah, I’m in no way saying it’s impossible for survivors to get cosmetics. But it’s harder to get lamps. The last event sorta like this was fine. Halloween killers had hooks and survivor had vessels. And we couldn’t destroy them. But with this breaking system it’s almost impossible for them to get it.
---
&gt; when the gates are open.
---
NOED doesn't activate when the gates are open. It activates when the last gen is done. That's a massive difference.
---
&gt; Decisive Strike offers no such choice. There isn't a gameplay option for the Killer to deal with it; they just have to get lucky or eat it and go chase some more
---
Down the survivor by the hook, dribble them, leave them slugged. 
---
or just take the hit and catch them again like I do 95% of the time. 
---
Yes thats exactly what I said moron. Imagine remembering peoples usernames on reddit. This is the saltiest subreddit I’ve ever seen, people take this game so seriously and you can tell they arent very good at the game from their posts. How are you going to be that bad at a game you take so seriously?
---
Its not proxy camping if you see people running and hounding for the hook, thats just what everyone does against the moronic overly altruistic SWF. Proxy camping is when you literally dont leave the area of the hook and dont even patrol generators. They see auras off BBQ and see generators get popped and still run around the hook waiting for someone to try and save their teammate. 
---
Keep twisting my words though, seems like you’re one of the thousands of reddit killers who have this sad victim mentality and think everyones out to get them lmao.
---
You apply pressure where it's needed. If the other survivors are doing gens, you go there. If they're all hanging around the hook waiting to save, you apply pressure to their foreheads with your heavy implement of choice.
---
If you hang around the hook when the other survivors are pushing the objective, you're an idiot and deserve what you get. But if the whole team's hanging around and not pushing the objectives, it's not your job to reward bad gameplay by giving them free unhook points.

---
Were the skins he bought you cool at least?
---
Yeah, I agree that the destroying thing is really unfair, your points made me realise I didn't even know how half of it worked. It's been hard enough for some survivors to escape the games during this event as is, it's very grindy.

Thank you so much! Definitely will take those all in account and get to work on a good perk set :) 
---
Do you honestly believe people play this for any other reason besides bloodpoints? Bloodpoints is THE only reason to play. Without it you get no progression. Without progression you have no reason to play.
---
You didn't come with any other argument yourself so might as well just not join in on the conversation?

Comparing the original 3 Moris to Nurse's is seriously so jarring. It's like some finger painting versus Vincent van Gogh's ["Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roulin_Family) Yes Nurse's Mori's no Starry Night but compared to a 3 year old's finger painting something like that is awe-inspiring.

Thats the kind of motivation I needed

Well Lady Maria is basically Huntress so...
---
Sometimes I dodge. It doesn't matter what character/prestige/item you're using. I just like being an asshole. :)
---
I mean you can get used it it, doesn't mean we should not call out the fact that you can only go like less then 10 minutes before some form of a visual bug or gameplay bug shows up. It reflects badly on the game to have this clear and constant graphical issues show up, among actual bugs that negatively impact the game.
---
I suppose its also in part because they dont really run hotfixes as much, if some big but not game destroying bug shows up (Wraith Blood issue) you have to wait until the mid chapter balanced patch to fix it, therefore bugs are a constant and stay in the game far longer then most other games.
---
I think of this scene too much while playing 😂
---
lol, I dont know about you but I play to WIN not for fucking bloodpoints, u are just as dumb as a brick
---
Survivor. You get 20 tokens for completing all gens. You get another 25 for escaping with vessels. So you can get 45 per match.
---
Show me those cheeks 😉😉
---
Don't run object of obsession, sole survivor and desicive strike, that should lower the amount you are obsession considerably. Also what they're doing when they drop you is called "dribbling" or "juggling" so you don't use the D.S on them.
---
Damn, I was hoping not to have to spend any money... Thanks anyways
---
Ty
---
You play to win, well like I've said twice now. Maybe use the tips I mentioned to win. 
---
You must be pretty sensitive to disagreement huh?
---
Honestly when I first loaded the game and saw the art, I thought it was David. 
---
Tbh I don’t like this, it just gives more of a reason to play as a survivor than a killer, and the only thing killer truly benefits from this event is faster lobbies, and arguably easy lobbies because people will want to do is grind points, and it will just cause people to be super altruistic to allow the lantern holder to get out and sacrifice themselves, even if they’re going to be put in the dying state, and dead on hook for some points.
---
except people don't flair their shitposts so you still get memes on memeless mode
---
&gt;Dead hard is the worst exhaustion perk
---
Have you forgotten balanced landing exists?
---
I personally don’t care what people do or why they DC, but if the game starts and there are 3 or less survivors in the lobby, I’ll disconnect if I’m killer. I’d rather sit through another queue session rather than play a game where both sides don’t enjoy
---
Lol good one.
---
I'm sure they were livid.
---
you should bring your claudette to prestige 3 and wear those bloody clothes they literally make you invisible! for perks you should use dead hard and decisive strike and bond and always look for pallets, drop them and teabag the killer that’s a mindgame pro strat trust me 
---
HAH, I'm rank1, not that ranks matter since it's piss easy to get rank1 if you play enough and aren't utter garbage as I assume you are
---
I usually dribble the obsession to each hook if they don't struggle immediately on the first pickup. Many killers do. You can't really do anything to prevent it, but you can try "faking" Decisive Strike if you're the obsession and let the killer waste time dribbling you and filling your struggle meter. 
---
Just need a hooked survivor and you got it 
---
the ranking system is a joke
---
So the 15-20 games I was obsession without having unlocked was because I was using a perk I didn’t have unlocked?
---
So I can’t struggle unless I use DS?
---
Nope just bad rng 
---
I know I would be 
---
@ me next time hoe
---
I don't understand. You can struggle whenever you want, but sometimes when you're not using DS and you notice that you're the obsession, see if you can bait the killer to dribble you(wasting their time) by not struggling at first. 
---
I think my last 30 games 25-28 were NOED. Just random.
---
Its not registering any progress for me with coins. Do you know why? Ive played all day with 0 progress at all
---
Oof. 
---
I feel like every bonus bp offering is bullshit. 90% of the time you spend bp to lose bp like the offerings usually cost more than they earn
---
I just meant because the “A D wiggle” doesn’t show up when I run DS until I’ve used it. But I can still wiggle even when it’s giving me the skill check?
---
Those toes 😂. I love it
