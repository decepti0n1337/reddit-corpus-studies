They can escape through hatch if they have a reverse bear trap on but they can't escape through the exit gates
---
---
---
what changed?
---
Case and point, players like yourself really over estimate how many people peak at your perks. Hell, most killers assume they are versing an SWF when they are getting destroyed. The sheer amount of times I, and streamers I have watched, got accused of being in an SWF and the killer will swear up and down you're lying is insane lol.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyways, the proof is in the pudding. So let's see what the excuse will be when your NOED fails to activate and nobody falls for your blood warden still even after the patch to hide your perks.
---
I see a lot of people here complaining on how they are still learning and wanna know how they died but don’t wanna know wait the whole game.
---
Instead of waiting, why not use it as an opportunity to watch survivors who are better than you, and you can see how you can improve. Then, when the games over, you can see what perk was giving you trouble. It’s like learning 2 things at the same time.
---
Urban was literally in 2 weeks ago 
---
&gt;Not a lot of people use blood warden
---
That means some do.
---
&gt; Remember me is obvious if 
---
If.
---
&gt; Devour hope can be 
---
Sure, it can be.
---
&gt; Moris are blatantly obvious 
---
What isn't obvious is whether it's a yellow, green or red one.
---
Depends on how you want to survive and your style and focus when playing.
---
Self care
---
Also no fix for survivors teleporting through pallets, or the pallet hit box being approximately 2 kilometres bigger than the pallet itself
---
Sarcasm caught
---
&gt;had someone die first intentionally to let everyone know what perks where run by the killer
---
Either you'rre lying or there retarded. having one more player to do gens or get a save can make all the difference no one's going to intentionally kill themselfs to tell someone they have certain perks and then have to wait the whole game for there team to finish. Also how did you know he died just to look at the perks?
---
After the lighting changes entering that building on the Japanese map as Freddy pretty much turns your screen white. It's so bad that it's hard to even see scratch marks, and if you get surprised by this effect you're bound to get slightly blinded, like when seeing the sun after staying inside a dark room, since most of the map is nowhere near as bright even when playing Freddy.
---
I love how killer mains always talk shit. Funny though I am rank 1-3 survivor and killer and out equal time into both. Tell me again how my point is not valid? Why should a killer see survivor names and what they equip but survivors can’t see killers after they die?
---
Balance? Where is it. Before your salty trash killer main ass makes a moronic statement explain how I’m wrong?
---
If this is real im going to be very dissapointed
---
Everyone loads into the game at the same time. Good enough of a reason for me to keep it on my HDD.
---
That's like demanding instant downs/kills to be removed or locked "grayed" with a survivor offering 
---
Restoration: 0
---
Slow the game down
---
Happy cake day to us 
---
Anything that slows survivors down by definition will hurt them, but that's not a bad thing.
---
I never see anyone 99% the gate when I use blood warden. Although it is only rank 8, they probably only started playing yesterday or something. Blood warden is my favourite for when survivors tbag at the open gates, because it’s a free 4k 
---
Honestly there are so many more teachable now since the shrine released that it should have 8 perks per week instead of 4.
---
Entity showcases futility of struggle in simplified form.
---
Oddly specific.. We're onto you 
---
You exclusively play as killer. Just 5 days ago you made a post asking for help with a perk loadout and then go on to talk about useless perks used by pure jen jockeys. 
---
I play both sides. I have more than adequate knowledge of perks on both sides and what are used most commonly. You're not gonna sit here and talk shit about how you think I only play one side. I have well over 2k hours in this game playing both sides. There is no salt. The only salt is coming from you because you seem to be mad that there are people like me who will know your exact loadout in the middle of a chase and most of the time know 3 of your 4 perks before you've even been hit once. I know your mad because you get regularly curb stomped as a Freddy main. But it'll be ok. You will get a buff one day. Until then, everyone is gonna laugh at you. Enjoy dodging all the swf teams because you have some gross belief that swf is more powerful than the killer. Lulz.
---
i just want ruin D: 
---
Prove thyself  does not stack 
---
Solid survivor perks but most people got them already tbh
---
We did get something in return. Very Rare, Ultra Rare add-ons and ebony mori’s...
---
Outstanding job soldier. 
---
Literally me when I first played Laurie. Used d strike just to be downed instantly after. 
---
And DC's with both gone 2 mins into the game with a swf group running calm spirit
---
I have tried it on spirit with prayer beads. It is SO much better now. Its what it should have been before.
---
What's the point of killing the survivor if he runs you for 5 gens if you won't pip anyways. They will get more bloodpoints if they escape than you will if you kill them.
---
No. Ps4 shelter woods.

Just started playing. Ive finished Claudette, Meg, and am almost done with Laurie. This is perfect.
---
Self Care, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, [insert exhaustion perk here]
---
Probably both knowing DBD being honest
---
You know, its very RUDE to assume someones pregnant. Don't assume that!
---
? it doesn't ? r u sure
---
True, but basement builds are pretty bad and boring anyway so it doesn't change too much.
---
I'm extremely disappointed in this weeks shrine. Yes most of them are very strong perks, but all of them are on characters which we all have for free... not a single non-free character perk. disappointing.
---
Yo frcdstcr, I love your flair wish I could have lucky boi
---
welp, i guess that next week there will be bbq :(
---
Better than having to deal with it against every single killer
---
Nvm then
---
If they are tunneling wouldn’t you know it’s dying light? That’s the only reason to tunnel, or maybe you were the only person they saw when you got unhooked.
---
Also: Randomize cosmetics at the start of the game
---
so is the david
---
DAMN RIGHT
---
It's not it feels because the bar dosent change into yellow and if it's red it's a passive debuff when there's 3 or more people on a gen it's slower
---
Wouldn't BNP's result in almost instant gen regardless of perks and layout? Each is adding 15+5+5% in what...5 sec?
---
Wow holy shit this Shrine is bad. The only one that's even remotely worth getting is WGLF, but it's so easy to get anyways wasting shards on it would be stupid.
---
You should be leveling Nea anyways for her top tier perks and both the Killer perks are bad. Can we get a Shrine reroll please?
---
Welcome to Dead By Daylight, enjoy your stay. 
---
On a more serious note, it takes a shit ton longer to find games with killer than survivor. Someone disconnecting before the game starts is unfortunately common at the moment. Here is hoping for them dedicated servers we are promised this summer.
---
Not if survivors aren't being daft cunts.
---
That is just lag
---
Is it just me or are there alot more hooks with this update
---
Pretty sure that was me on the Xbox One. I am terrible as a killer. Hated myself right there more than you. Same gamertag as reddit name. 
---
Yup. Most of the time survivors are countering the aura reading anyways so if I actually see anyone with it then that’s just a bonus to my free bloodpoints.
---
Why is self care broken? :c

Looks hot

Yes, only one is active at any time.

Hmm... I'd love to see the Spirit in your style, since we're on a "killer vibe" of drawings. I can never figure out her hair to do a nice drawing. I bet it'd look amazing!
---
Not really toxic, just using an item.
---
Depends if youre solo or not. One of my good friends I will always go in deep for. No homo.
---
prove thyself got buffed, it now gives you additional bps. leader now effects everything but repairs. 
---
A person who I usually play against does this exact thing with pig. hooked everyone twice, chucked bear traps on them and let them wiggle. He runs Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt, Barbecue and distressing lol
---
Yeah and I agreed with the first part of what you said which is why I didn’t say anything about it and it is irrelevant to what I said. I was talking about your comment pertaining to “the nature of the game.” Did you even read what I wrote? 
---
hello fellow quentin main 
---
I disagree, it's easy to get pissed off at the tbagging flash lighting shit that's outplaying you, VERY EASY.
---
This post was made by camping Leatherface gang 
---
&gt;You exclusively play as killer.
---
Ok, thanks for reminding me, you complete and total stranger, that all of those hundreds of hours I've played survivor were just made up in my head. 
---
&gt;Just 5 days ago you made a post asking for help with a perk loadout and then go on to talk about useless perks used by pure gen jockeys in a "just in case scenario" because yeah sure, everyone slugs constantly. Hahaha get real kiddo.
---
You really have nothing else to combat me with, so you go into my post history to try to scrape up an argument there. If anyone's the kid, it's you. And for the record, I've gotten bored at constantly using the same build, and am in the process of whipping up new ones to keep me interested. Nobody said anything about killers "slugging constantly", but I do bring in perks for just-in-case scenarios. That was because I hate being slugged and being able to do nothing about it. It's not my problem that you're the kind of survivor who only brings perks that work for you every match. 
---
&gt;You're not gonna sit here and talk shit about how you think I only play one side.
---
I'm not the one shit-talking about how someone only plays one side. That's you, buddy. And I don't get "curb-stomped". For all your talk of there not being salt from your side, you sure do like to assume shit about how you think I play just because of my main and the fact that I have a different viewpoint than you, plus the salt-drenched phrases of "You will get a buff one day. Until then, everyone is gonna laugh at you." and "Lulz.". It makes you look like a fool, to be perfectly honest.
---
&gt;you have some gross belief that swf is more powerful than the killer.
---
If you honestly can't see how SWF is broken, then nobody in the world can help you.
---
Is killer playable on PS4 yet?
---
There is no "best" or "worst" perk build as perks are meant to cater to a given playstyle and accomidate for your weaknesses or help improve your strengths. There are perk tier lists though that rank perks based on their general effectiveness when compared to all other perks.
---
A general word of advice for Survivor is to take Self Care, an Exhaustion perk, a stealth perk, and a Wild Card perk based on your playstyle.
---
A general word of advice for Killer is to take BBQ &amp; Chili, Ruin, and either tracking perks or chasing perks.
---
Yeah that’s why I had it somewhat uppercase. It was sarcasm.

---
Has happened in two separate game basements so far. If I enter, I can't leave. It teleports me back inside. I also can't open chests or enter closets. The killer eventually came and hooked me.
---
Just click 'edit user flair' on the right side and type it in. :)
---
did they fix that with today's update? didn't get to check it myself yet
---
if you are trying to learn perks and why killers use perks, how to know what perks, etc. I cannot recommend highly enough the 'Shrine of Secrets' series by youtube HybridPanda. Each week he explains the four shrine perks, when and why they are used, and then does a survivor and killer game using the two perks for each. It's a great way to learn because A) interesting and B) not overwhelming.
---
Oh OK thanks! 
---
Killers like that are the worst.  I get that there are a bunch of annoying shitstain survivors but leave the well-behaved ones alone, asshole.  I just try to give them the benefit of the doubt, assume they're 12, and move along. 
---
I don't play Pig, what happened with Amanda's Letter?
---
...Leader never affected you...
---
It was literally a straight buff. There's no reason not to take it if you took it before. Now it's just better for healing or cleansing totems.
---
I'll take anything. This map is horse shit.
---
I already dc on every farm map because the corn legitimately hurts my eyes, this map is the same, but like a strobe effect. Go crosseyed every couple of second.
---
You're welcome.
---
My influence grows.
---
Dude... It doesn't, but you literally said that if you loose, that is always because of the blur. If you were meaning something different than sorry, not my intention to offend you
---
Guess I'll commit die
---
Is calm spirit bugged? When I run it I still get crows flying away when I get near them. I’m worried it’ll cost me if killer are running the newly buffed Spies from the Shadows. 
---
Lol
---
That can happen, too, but I try to remind myself that if you spend 4-5 gens on one guy, you gotta look at yourself as part of the problem happening.
---
I did it *brother*
---
Mostly a survivor here. This isn't a big deal and I play with my friend all of the time. She was a little bugged by it then got over it. It's an understandable change. 
---
Yessssssss. At midnight, we ride!
---
Strange. Probably a remnant of the Self Care change that didn't go through.
---
To Elm Street! 
---
I never said leader affected yourself, in fact I definitely said “if it’s still the same where it doesn’t affect yourself.” Idk I feel like most of the time if you’re near a survivor for a long duration, it’s on a generator. Otherwise it’s just to unhook and/or heal them and then you’re gone to another gen. This is just my opinion about the change though. 
---
It used to reveal Survivors auras within a 20 meter range when she was crouching but now it only reveals auras of Survivors within a 12 meter range. 
---
For perspective, that exactly what a very rare Wraith add-on does. Except The Pig also looses 3 RBT's and removes 2 Jigsaw Boxes.
---
🦀🦀 CLAUDETTE IS GONE 🦀🦀
---
Ever since legion came out and he moried me after farming for four gens I've been super farm spooked XD (Not saying anything about legion, that's just when it happened)
---
I dunno what happened in the last few updates, but corn now legit hurts my eyes. I feel like I'm going cross eyed just walking through it, never mind chasing someone.
---
And then the spirits map is the same, but a strobe effect.
---
Atleast detail what changed...
---
So you don't think survivor and killer objectives are in conflict of each other? I have no idea what you're trying to argue or what you having fun and talking to survivors after a match has anything to do with the type of killers who ragequit. 
---
I think they meant UP for unnerving presence.
---
Unless doc is a survivor now
---
I think it's just people trying out the new Prove Thyself.
---
I think adding voice comms to survivor would solve a lot of the game's problems, so much so I don't see why it hasn't been considered yet. Of course, there should be a way to mute individual players, and something something immersion, but at this point the game is so 'arcade-y' that immersion should the bottom priority when balancing the game. Here are some benefits:
---
1. There is no longer a disparity between solo and SWF teams, so it would be easier to balance the game around that.
---
2. If you have a new player on your team, say a free weekender, you can communicate and tell them what to do, making a match with a free weekender less miserable.
---
3. You can tell people to fuck off if they save you too close to the killer without borrowed time.
---
4. You can tell people to fuck off if they steal your rare item knocked by Franklin's.
---
5. You can tell people to fuck off if they get in your way during a chase.
---
6. You can tell people to fuck off if they bring the killer to you.
---
7. You can tell people to fuck off if they're crouching around the map all game and not doing gens.
---
8. You can talk to people, so the game isn't so fucking boring holding m1 for 80 seconds.
---
-
---
That's my list hope u like
---
I don't think it's an issue on the games side which is why there would be no fix for it. It's simply connections between all players. It should be smooth once dedicated severs come out.
---
Do you need to destroy every dull totem to prevent NOED? Or is it predetermined to be tied to a particular totem?
---
Correct.
---
The gen time for 2 workers was supposed to be 44 the whole time. 
---
Leader is really good now, vaults got buffed as well and lots of fixes.
---
Once you've been playing for quite some time against Hag you should be gunning for those traps, clearing them and trying to be chased. That leaves less time for Hag to set up her traps (almost same strategy with trapper just don't run into them). Only times to be careful and crouch is when you're unhooking survivors and doing totems.
---
THE JAKE TWIN DREAM
---
So, as a note: If you want developers to do something, you shouldn't drop the f-word twice in your request. Tends to not make people like you or think about your suggestion calmly.
---
Huntress Lullaby: Worse Ruin that needs stacks to do anything. On a cleanse-able Hex perk. Yikes.
---
Lightborn: just look up lol. Not worth a perk slot, flashlights are avoidable enough.
---
Urban Evasion: If you're sneaking around enough for this perk to be worth it, you're probably not very good in a chase. Does nothing once in said chase. Very meh.
---
WGLF: Does nothing except provide you bloodpoints. Good perk if you're a survivor main, but if you can play Killer... just play Killer if you want BP? Even without BBQ you'll get more bloodpoints more often than not.
---
Overall... Yikes. 2/10? WGLF is decent. Wouldn't buy anything else, and they're all free characters anyway. Skip this week unless you really don't care to level David.
---
I honestly wouldn't be able to play Leatherface above Rank 6 without Whispers for early game tracking. So, I don't know about that. It'd basically look glitched as they click in-and-out, like with lockers.
---
Yeah, it was poor wording. I didn't mean losing people in every chase, I meant that I would activate frenzy and could often immediately lose sight of the survivors that were a foot in front of my face because they stepped sideways and the blur was too intense to see anything but what's directly in front of me.
---
If they’re gonna make escaping harder for survivors they need to buff survivor bp. Killers can 0k and get more bp than the survs do. Right now the only way to get decent bp playing survivor is to be super altruistic or escape 
---
That hook was always talkin shit
---
Killer buff? How is this possible?
---
This will probably be implemented when dedicated servers launch in summer this year.
---
Open it on youtube and mute the real music! :p
---
Of course is should have been fixed but the devs do all they can already, they know about those issues and try to fix them.
---
Maybe running NOED and bbq at the same time isn’t that good of an idea. Either focus hard on the early game or the late game. So use NOED and something like blood warden together or just Ruin and then bbq or somethin
---
The sound is completely fucked for me. Something is wrong.
---
I can hear like 1/4 of the things killer is supposed to hear.
---
I love your style so much. 
---
Id rather eat a burrito in my pjs THAN go to the movie. Choice between the two. 
---
Id rather eat a burrito in my pjs, THEN go to the movie. Timeline of events.
---
It’s not. I’m simply saying that legion is not OP. 
---
Fairly new player - what was wrong with the sound originally?
---
Corn is OP, change my mind. 
---
If you're asking 'Meta' as in, the perks people use when they want to win, here you go:
---
SURVIVOR: Pick 1 exhaustion perk of your choice. Then self care. Fill the other two from this list: Leader, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Urban Evasion (maybe) Distortion, Prove Thyself (maybe), We'll Make It.
---
KILLER: BBQ&amp;Chili, always. Take at least one perk to slow gens, (Thanataphobia, Overcharge, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel) Take the best perk for your killer (Make your Choice on Nurse, Distressing on Doc), take one random perk to counter what you have trouble with personally or survivor's stuff. (If you see a lot of items, Franklin's Demise. If you get stunned a lot, Enduring) If you prefer to get more consistent pips instead of killing all survivors, NOED, Blood Warden, Rancor can guarantee you a kill, sometimes, to help rank up. 
---
In either case the meta items and offerings are just the best current thing you have that combos with your best perk. So if you have leader take your best toolbox or medkit. If you have urban evasion take a key. If you are doc take calm addons to increase radius with distressing.
---
Welcome to the META. You'll hate it here. See ya back in memebuild funtimes once you get annoyed :D
---
Psshhh good luck with discussions. Were all so biased having a civilised discussion works for about 5 minutes before people start hive minding shit. Im guilty of it too though so whatevs.
---
Low skill cap. Easy to use, no way to master. 
---
What? You know full well he didn’t go 50 meters away. It was a joke anyway.
---
 Btw, I am a nerd. I make over 100k a year being a nerd, how bout you? I bet you just got a raise on Jan 1st. 
---
Would proximity voice be cool? It'd be cool if the killer could hear you talking if he was in proximity too.
---
Obviously people are gonna cheat and use Discord anyways, but I wonder if offering an alternative in game could help at all.
---
Yeah I was loosing Legion killers sometimes like really suddenly, probably because of that
---
They fuck up the audio basically every other patch and make it way harder to hear footsteps and breathing 
---
Play survivor and don’t do gens, just make the killer chase you. Then watch what they do to deal with loops. 
---
The hatch isn't a privilege just a fair chance for the last survivor
---
I was playing her with no perks or add ons with her in red ranks when I first started to play her and I got easy 4ks. She really isn't that difficult except on inside maps
---
Honestly mate, Killer is something I struggled with too, I could loop Killers for ages but getting looped by survivors is something I struggled with massively, YouTube is your friend here, just search for DBD killer tips and watch as much as you need too. T-Walls, L-Walls and killer shack would be what is making it hard for you so do the research and you’ll be 4K’ing before you know it. Also if you have a friend who plays, get them to play kill your friends with you as killer, get them to bring in Self Care, Botany and a real good Medkit with add ons and get them to loop the shit out of you. Yo can do it for as long as you and your friend want. 
---
Hope that helps some my friend 
---
Should definitely only apply to people in SWF groups. Not sure how difficult that would be to implement, but as a solo survivor, I’m not going to wait around to figure out why exactly I died. 
---
Rupaul's Drag Race: All-Stars Seasons 4. 
---
i’m so sorry, everyone, i’m just trying to get their perks teachable :(
---
trash
---
I would have let you live, at least for a little bit
---
Thare*
---
**im crying on the inside** :c
---
If you have barely played survivor don't give survivor tips. Also 300 hours is basically the same as 20 hours. 
---
What more were you expecting to accomplish?
---
Downvoted because you enjoy legion, sorry not sorry
---
Yeah I just saw it in my recommended on play store and it was almost exactly like dbd but killer and survivors are way more OP with items (Survivors get guns to stun the killer with there are no pallets but instead the killer has to break a door down. The killer will catch up to you even when you get the speed boost that you get for hitting a survivor)
---
Is it Tier III? With I and II, you'll still set them off but with a much smaller range (I think)
---
Lmao this is gold 
---
Honestly not knowing it's hag and stepping into one of her traps gives me a heart attack
---
One of the best perks in the game
---
Sometimes the thirst for the kill overrides the perks lol
---
At least third seal is somewhat decent against solo survivors. Lullaby isn't good at all
---
iS tHiS To mEn?
---
man you really sound stupid in this Comment. I know how both sides work and sorry, but I cant dedicate that much time to a game. 300hours in half a year is all I can spare.
---
But if you are unable to cleanse totems, I might be able to teach you how to do it
---
O U T P L A Y E D
---
I picked it up and for some reason I lost the shards and didn't really get ruin. Only noticed when leveled up hag to level 35
---
Yep, you can get out of the post-hit stun much faster and get right back into the chase. At eight stacks, this is about the duration of the post-hit speed boost survivors get, so you see how much faster STBFL will make the killer go post-hit. 
---
And yeah, the idea is to ignore your obsession until the very end (you can obviously go after them before then, but you'll be giving up your stacks a lot and have to go through a yo-yo of getting stacks, giving them up, having to get them again, etc. etc.); this is also a good incentive to avoid DS users. In my opinion, it's best on m1 killers who do not have an insta-down ability but have a power that can affect the obsession while the killer ignores them, like Doctor and Freddy.
---
I literally only run whispers so I don't get immersed survivors crouching around wasting my time for 30 minutes, no
---
Killers get buffed pretty frequently directly and indirectly cause the game’s been survivor slanted for a bit. 
---
Those bottles don't do shit.
---
Sounds like bots. Used to be a huge problem on PC but they’ve pretty much eliminated it. Must not have on console.
---
Freddie is hilariously bad but if you have more fun playing him, go for it.
---
He doesn’t use Ruin on her. So thats first proof you don’t watch him. ;)
---
He uses sloppy, discordance, nurses and bbq and chilli. Plus he doesn’t use omegablink.
---
Also Senzuduck can tell you that there was at least 8 people sniping Tru3 and saying in the pregame lobby “he is perkless, rush the gens so he doesn’t get the challenge”. And guess what? He still got it. So if thats not a good player with nerves of steel and a good FairPlay then I don’t know what people you watch. :) 
---
Stop shitting on a person who did a very difficult challenge and deserves applause. Period. 
---
*laughs in distortion, the god of perk information*
---
I sometimes forget I have whispers but it’s great for whenever they’re being extra crafty!
---
I've always wondered if DbD could get away with a drag-queen killer.
---
There's a long history of transvestites in slasher films, so there's certainly a precedent. But you just know that people would simultaneously call BHVR both transphobic *and* SJWs.
---
Yes, because everyone who gets a new game and wants to try it out is going to spend hours upon hours watching videos before playing the game
---
I honestly love watching bootleg versions of games like DbD or overwatch, it's just funny to me how those devs will try to tweak it a little to make it seem different, but still fail
---
No he is not. He plays both equally for more than a year now. Stop that lie! Just because he has empathy for people who play killer doesnt make him a killer main. 
---
&gt;that gloating hook, probably
---
FTFY
---
Maybe win detectives hunch?
---
OhmWrecker, he doesn't play it every day like Monto and No0b3 but he has over 100 videos on dbd
---
Monto
---
I second this, Monto always goes over his builds and how they help. Great yourubwr 
---
Yeah sometimes it’s a race to see who can find it first, other times it’s a cautious crouching game. If you suspect they might have Whispers best to try and find it first as fast as you can!
---
Yes, definitely expect new players that see the game and want to try it out over a free weekend or on a friends account to spend hours watching videos before they even play the game
---
definitely does.  I pulled 2 alex's toolbox in one match.
---
I never called him a killer main. 
---
Lol I used to enjoy Ohm and loved his cringy humour but unfortunately I grew out of it 
---
Yep! Nothing like wasting everyone’s time!
---
Every single video for survivors and killers and he's not a toxic player. Not saying being toxic is bad but if you don't want toxic he's the guy. 
---
Rank 14. I'm kinda done now after 1 match.

Can't believe *the entity* let you have *two* posts on the front page
---
Nah, if they're actually playing the game they'll just 99% the gate and you'll keep getting deprived of a perk because blood warden is trash and needs an actual buff
---
but where is BBQ
---
How did you get diffrent images on ur perks?

This. The rare chance I actually shock a survivor before they vault, they just have to 360 and vault the window.
---
You basically just agreed with what the dude said while also trying to say he was wrong lol
---
Rank 11 here. Took me 8 minutes to find a lobby
---
It's really not. Less than 45% escape rate even with SWF "advantage"
---
Shame on the wraith for killing you, dude knows that was bs but I bet he was desperate for kills.
---
Mate you missed my point, he wants to not get hooked and the only way to do that is to not get chased in the first place. Unless the killer you're playing against is an idiot you're going down eventually. Also I never said anything about myself hiding or being bad at looping, so stop projecting
---
Fortnite is a phase, I believe Dead by Daylight will remain as a bit of a fan base since there are MANY streamers on it, however while fortnite has the same in common it is just a bland game composed of children fan girling over being like ninja. 
---
It's almost like you expect every new player to know all of the perks in the game and not need to learn anything 
---
The exhaustion addons were balanced pre exhaustion nerf. They should be changed/have their values reduced. 
---
No joke, this happened to one of the survivors I was playing against today. I let him go.
---
Legion is broken. Lol. Of course with Legion is easy. Pfff... 
---
Lets revert this bitch pack to patch 2.3. Its rewind time
---
Well technically every chase is impossible to win. It is just a matter of how much killer's time you can waste chasing you.
---
The videos that go up on his channel are also only the best or worst games he plays and he plays hundreds of matches a day so it doesn’t mean much.
---
Demi and puppers for enjoyment, Monto for builds and Noob3 for bit of both

Just hide in a locker for 4 seconds

it doesn't help that his lunge is a bit shallow

The point is to show it properly. BNP is boring this is supposed to showcase the new changes' effects on it.

Edited the files
---
What is teabagging?  I read alot of posts about people being angry that survivors do that but have no clue what it is. (Mind you I know what it is in real life...just not in this game.)  
---
It's literally like 30 seconds with 3 people and prove thyself, it's insane. I kind of feel like a nerf might happen because of the hype which will lead to a genrush meta.

He never claimed tru3 uses ruin on her.

Why does he deserve applause for playing a video game? He’s doing his job, no applause needed for that lmao.

Last comment from me: Cleanse the totems and if you cant, for whatever mysteries reason, than the Killer deserves his Noed proc
---
them blood points be hitting
---
I like the changes for Prove Thyself but i would like it even more if it awarded BP *Post Trial* because now it just maxes Objectives with 2 Gens if Cooped and you might lose your motive to repair gens early in game.
---
In red ranks I always get a game instantaneously as killer, however it takes me a long time to get a game as survivor.
---
Really cool, source?
---
Oh yes, definitely gonna think that people seeing other people fail and know not to do those things won't eventually get better. Plus, you know, people can actually do research outside of DBD and get better that way as well. Stop trying to hold peoples' hands.
---
The gays that play this game, me included, love meming it. It just so happens that drag race is perfect for the lolz
---
So what? Doesn’t invalidate the effort of Tru3 and Marth, both are amazing players. This is not about who is better. Its about Tru3 doing it in this post. 
---
2years ago it was not emblem system at the time. It was based off points. :)
---
Also Tru3 did this right after rank reset, from 10 to 1 where he was ranking up at the same time as all the high rank players.
---
Plus he did all killers until he was stuck at rank 2 then he used nurse for 5 pips to finish the challenge and on top of that getting sniped almost all games by people who knew what they were up against. 
---
So if that is not impressive I don’t know what else is :) give the man some credit for trying it and completing it!

You ever spectate a hatch standoff? It's terrible. Plus not everyone have hours to play games every day and may want to move on after they die.
---
There are only 5 totems per match, if every survivor would just do a totem when they see it, you would reduce the power and usage of NOED massively. 
---
Survivors don't see totems as an objective, all they see is generators. But if your OBJECTIVE is to escape, then surely a sub-objective is to make it as safe as possible for you to do so.
---
So do bloody totems!

God this! Hex Ruin is so worthless. I was so proud of myself when I bought it from the shrine. "I was going to be a real killer now!" They sure shown me.
---
That’s clearly a biological woman, do you not have eyes?

They said before this went out that it was experimental and wasn’t gonna. However the idea of healing yourself fast but others slowly was an idea they wanted to explore later on. 
---
Yeah because you so fucking toxic we just want to get rid of you
---
BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Whispers.

High momentum at the start if I get someone since they assume camp, and I can usually get two people. If not, things aren't so hot for me until a mistake from someone.

Sure bud. It is still their job at the end of the day. And the community feedback is their reward. Dont be obtuse and backwards. 
---
They enjoy the game but streaming is an added stress. Think before you talk. Any streamer would tell you that you are very backwards minded and lack empathy.
---
yeah but rip my survival daily
---
Omg you must be a genius at killer. Its easy to pip until you get to rank 3 at most. Please teach me sempai /s
---
Wait wasnt urban evasion just in there few weeks ago
---
See you in 2020 mate!
---
That sounds glorious! Congrats!
---
I am very confused.
---
Yes, I noticed DBD has a huge LGBT following unlike the other three games. I think that's pretty dope. My friend and I play it, but I hardly see them on there anymore. 
---
Looks fun
---
Yes 40% with 4 people. With 1 Person a gen takes 80 seconds. With 2 its 44 with 3 its 32 with 4 it's 28. You do the math
---
I had one game of people just constantly running across my runes where I had the pleasure of seeing a Dwight just give up after someone just zoomed by while he was trying to do a gen. He just followed me trying to get me to kill him but I made sure everyone died instead
---
Also, tip. Try to turn tighter. You turn way too wide.

Perfect explanation. Thank you.
---
Why are you so angry? 
---
Anyways, refer to my last reply and perhaps go and take something as it seems you haven’t taken your daily pills. 
---
Have a good one. 
---
I don't buy that. Goal of the game for survivors is to survive and escape, not be found and chased. Chasing serves only one purpose in regards to helping others to achieve the goal and its distracting. Distraction is never needed if generators are repaired in proper sequence (not leaving last 3 gens next to each other) and distraction is always ineffective if killer never commits to a chase because the main goal of the killer is not to chase but to prevent escape and eliminate survivors.
---
Being boosted means having for example , the skill of a rank 10 but being rank 1 by either having swf who are really good and pretty much carry the boosted survivor or having someone else play on their account and rank them up and give their acc back to the “boosted” player
---
What is your perk build? I used to keep being found first when I first started, but both Spine Chill and Urban Evasion (now in Shrine of Secrets!) helps a ton since you can crouch around and know when the killer is nearby.  
---
2. Turn 180 immediately and hit S. 
---
I think it’s different between console and pc
---
Just in time for freddy rework
---
End of january it stated that on their homepage
---
I saw this and when I started dbd it crashed. 
---
The Pig doesn't even get 16 meters, Amanda's letter only gives 12 meters and you would need to be crouched(moving at 92%) well before you get even close to that 12 meter range if you actually wanted to surprise someone.  T1 Myers still moves at 105%. 
---
If you Work with someone else in the gen it does it now. Not sure why though
---
We need some kind of archiving of post-match scoreboards or something. Stuff that we can look at days or weeks later if we want to.
---
What a baby...
---
Why are they leaving? That's ridiculous
---
Must be a text bug, I would assume nothing in game has changed
---
Don't take it to serious. I just like to edit and have a shitty experience with legion :)
---
White font with black outline or vice versa is perfect
---
They said they were working on it, they just changed it so leader wouldn't affect it with it's new buff.
---
And it's quite trashy to enter a comment section just to troll, but here you are
---
And I THINK, correct me if I'm wrong, that holding a flashlight on them for a bit will remove them.
---
Unpopular Opinion: Absolutely hated the darkness among us music.
---
..and to people who are still 'new-ish' learning the nuances of 12 different killers, 6 item types, 30+ perks per side with even more combined uses - while fleeing a killer trying not to be camped or tunneled.. those are all easily missable cues.
---
They openly revealed their lapses in observation, there's no need to be a 'verysmart' guy on this matter.
---
Btw the 40% will get off the 80/44/32/28 seconds. This will mean that a gen with 2 people and prove thyself are 39.4s etc.
---
Interesting experiment!
---
Why did you use an efficiency addon and not the two speed addons? Efficiency makes items lose less charges over time do it‘s basically just like a wire spool so you can repair more but not faster.
---
Also, did you don this test in the previous patch ad well? Because it should have been even faster then.
---
Because I love Legion, thats why
---
The only that changed with totems is they should no longer be within line of sight from survivor spawns. Some tech was added so they can further improve totems in the future, but that's it. 
---
I don’t think so,but it pisses of survivors,so unless you don’t care about hate mail,you shouldn’t do it
---
It's a new bug. 
---
If they try it over a free weekend, or on a friends account they wouldn't know what the info on the videos even was.  They removed them, they are gone.  I guarantee more people would bitch about them coming back than who is complaining now about them being gone.  I preferred to have them as a survivor main, but they are gone so I will grow to not inform my friends as I no longer can.
---
Damn that sucks but that 360 was clean as hell
---
ill be sure to check there first next time this is just the first time ive ever had it happen
---
For Survivor, definitely get both of them. They are both amazing perks. For killer, I would personally get neither but if I had to choose I would go with Huntress Lullaby, but even that isn’t very good
---
And to think I passed on Rancor and saved up shards...
---
You need an eye patch for that shit, so when you go outside you can flip the patch to the other eye and be able to see.
---
Cloudette will still find it.
---
r/2meirl4meirl
---
I had 60 FPS on cold wind as survivor and as killer on autohaven

Why would you instantly assume that from my comment? Also, Its not like legion can't be gen rushed.

Because in the op example the survivor was bmingevery pallet not just running for 5 gens.
---
Actually not half bad, all the perks are somewhat decent
---
This has to be on pc, if it was on console it would crash the entire systems.
---
I mean, this is a solid chunk of how I learned how to play: by watching others and seeing what works and, more importantly, what doesn't. I don't know why you're being downvoted for this
---
What’s OC?
---
Yes thank you! realize that, and do your job not to upvote others.
---
i wouldn’t consider that hacking. I only used it because I couldn’t afford all the dlcs I wanted to try, it’s not like I unlocked all the steam achievements or modified my blood points/save file.
---
tons of people did it, they just won’t admit it. 
---
Once I used a streamer. Loaded into the game, everything was great. Then the killer immediately DCed 
---
I can understand that.
---
Not really. But anyway, why do you feel that it is hard playing as killer on PS4?
---
It'd make sense to prevent the perks from showing to people who are playing with friends but keeping it visible to solo players. I don't know how possible that'd be to make as a system though.
---
I don't ever get past the loading screen.
---
Not toxic, just annoying.
---
So it’s not just me. Does it also feel like the sounds are coming from incorrect areas? Like if a survivor is to your right but you hear their cries from the left? Specifically if you’re wearing ear phones and such. 
---
You are a genius, take my up-votes. 
---
Wait, who's Dwigt?
---
*Here's what we think happened.
---
Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie, is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight, but then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace.*
---
*But that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one "Dwigt".*
---
With the Pig changes I encountered an annoying bug.  It made her crouch animation only play halfway, then instead of the camera being low to the ground I was just standing and moving around normally except less speed and no terror radius.  This happened after someone Disconnected mid pick up animation.  
---
Usually it's a facecamping Bubba that steals my companion items, but a 1v1,2v1,or even 3v1 will be the culprit.
---
F in the comments for the toolbox. 
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth. 
---
And also, they're downvoting me because for some reason, they just *have* to know what the killer's running, and can't be assed to wait until they can see before going on to the next match. If it inconveniences you that damn badly, just go on to the next game. 
---
We need more killers on PS4. SWF takes ages.
---
You can’t?
---
You are already gay. 
---
again full of Shit?
---
See, proximity chat sounds cool, but then I remember F13 and every game where you can chat with the other team in a competitive setting. The killer would be getting constantly insulted/racially slurred at, or they'd be getting earraped. Not saying everyone would do it, but it would happen enough that I would just turn it off if I was going to play killer.
---
It would be neat but there are a thousand other things more worthwhile that I would rather they focus on.
---
Well, sabotaging traps is a bit less useful, as they now respawn after some time.
---
Will that alert her though?
---
That’s not exactly what I consider farming. If you aren’t doing it all game it’s different. 
---
Indeed. I'm a survivor main through and through, but this game *absolutely* needed this change like... last year. It's not fair at all to the killer that their perks ~~are~~ were on full display as soon as the first person dies or, probably more commonly, disconnects. My question is, why *did* it take them so long to implement this?
---
Using certain perks was just pointless before the patch since they'd never activate because they were so easy to counter if you knew the killer had them.
---
Then that's on those survivors for being boring. Those players who are looking to learn could also, you know, actually do some research outside of the game. Look up the wiki, watch good players stream, etc. etc. This isn't as massive of a problem as people are making it out to be. 
---
Also, if merely not seeing the killer's build post-game until it's actually done is that much of a massive problem for new solo queue survivors, maybe they have bigger problems than just not knowing what the killer's running until the match is over.
---
Well atm they claim they don't track who's SWF or solo, so unless they're willing to put dev time into making a system to track that(honestly, it would really help the accuracy of their beloved stats) it's just not going to happen. Would be nice though.
---
I'm guessing overcharge
---
I get you man.  "Honestly, there's a damn wiki" is exactly how I start conversations with friends asking me for wisdom, and when I have to teach my parents anything because I'm humble af.
---
lol I love this
---
I made it to rank one only once, and since then my highest is rank was like 4. Once I get to about 8/9 as killer I try to rank up as survivor. Best I've done is 8 so still working in that. But I agree the try hard, purple flashlights. Insta heals... everyone has DS it's like fuck you all and I end up having to use noed and 2 add ons. Fun if R1 is you're goal but over all not as enjoyable when you come home after a long day and just want to gave fun.
---
Why not :(
---
Deffo damnnohtml on YouTube. His first of the daylight series is great and his chatter includes what he thinks the survivors are doing and should be doing. 
---
Yeah stealth... he literally sees your heart beating. 
---
Zet0r
---
No, not unless you're in the normal range of the trap.
---
This game needed this change from Day 1 of SWF being in existence. I don't know the reason why it took them so long (probably the same damn reason it takes them so damn long to do anything else, I guess), but I'm very glad it's here.
---
And always base off of T3 perks since you never go back to 1/2 unless you prestige, which you can do without even playing the character once.
---
You could exclusively play doctor and get P3 of every survivor you have and every other killer.
---
When is this patch dropping 
---
He’ll joke about being toxic when they, by pure chance, finish three gems within seconds of eachother. He’ll joke about it when he he does something weird that confuses the killer. But unless it’s one of his toxic videos he does his best to make the game fun for everyone
---
If I find the hatch and I wanna tea bag I usually do some running vaults/throw down a pallet so they come towards the hatch. Then they don’t have to sit around looking for me and I can jump out when they’re close enough to hear it. 
---
So all perks that come from baseline survivors and killers, and no DLC perks. Welp, guess I'm unlocking Feng Min for Lithe after all.
---
Can you actually see as spirit again? I tried playing her after the lighting changes and my gamma goes through the roof when I use her ability, it's like she goes into freddys dreamworld(in terms of visibility). I ran into so many walls :(
---
So then the  killer can tell how close they are to hidden survivors that are using proximity comms? Sounds like a bad idea.
---
This happend to me twice today

You’re thinking of EAC. Try to Validate your files
---
You're right, and i agree with you, im just a little worried such a change right now for legit new players like less than 3 hours of playing, will do more harm than good, ya knw? Not everyone is willing to research everything about a game in their first few playthroughs, not to mention dbd isnt a very popular genre of game. I completely understand the change, and agree with it but feel it shouldnt affect solo players or at the very least people with less than 3-5 hours of gameplay (i doubt any new player in solo is thinking "hey let me message this guy on why the killers perks are") so they can get their bearings, if anything make it a rank 18-15+  for solo players. Idk overall my point is i think the dev team can come up with a better solution, that solves the swf exploit but not deter new players from learning about the game. (None of us can really speak since we always had the ability from the beginning) 
---
LMAO oh my god I confused it with Leader. I'm leaving it up as a testament to my idiocy
---
I got urban evasion but not spine chill, however I do think I unlocked it!

Except Mike, it makes sense for him to stare them down

Thanks Bush, very cool

You are correct. But moreover, shining the flashlight anywhere near them will also reveal their auras to you. Handy!
---
While the Swivel Socket add-on was a good choice, should have used the Clean Rag for the other. Would have given another ~10% bonus per player. 
---
However, I don't blame you for the confusion. The Devs specifically called the gen speed changes "Efficiency" in the live stream when talking about the new bonuses/penalties. However in-game "Efficiency" is a different stat not related to progress speed. It's instead related to how many charges you actually burn on the item as you use it.
---
So all the Instructions are doing is making it so every second of using the toolbox is only using .8 seconds worth of charges. 
---
Yea have fun and slow the game down... just a little bit
---
Well, they don't see it anymore. :)

Or stealth, or map pressure. Kinda hard to apply pressure when they constantly know where you are and what you’re doing, so gens get done way faster then normal regardless of how good each individual survivor is at staying alive in a chase.
---
Swf isn’t unkillable or impossible but it’s more difficult to play against with no compensation for rising to the challenge. I get on to play a match every now and then in between class lectures or social outings and if I see a 3 or 4 man load in that looks pretty experienced or they have toolboxes, then yah imma likely dodge the lobby.

---
Right?
---
Situational bad perk turned in mildly decent tracking perk.
---
This could be a killer perk lol. The first survivor to run past the exit line gets teleported to the basement. New hex perk 
---
Myers' Gender: Stabby
---
why? they're already dead. just because they CAN tell you what they have doesnt mean they do. 
---
If you're referring to file size it's because the PC has optimized data storage, the consoles have to literally reinstall the game again to apply the update.
---
To save time. If the killer knew you had a chance to escape, they'd stay near the hook.

---
Because it's a waste of time. It used to not be this way, and killers would have to stare at a hooked survivor and the hooked survivor could either try to kobe or waste ~60 seconds hanging there because they're salty and want to get one last little spiteful act in. 
---
And before you bring up the fact that the killer could go off and break pallets/ kick gens and give  you a chance to escape, understand killers only do that now BECAUSE it was changed so that the last survivor doesn't get a chance for a miracle kobe. 
---
The entire point of it is to wrap up an already finished game and get everyone into the next one. 
---
Shhhhh you’re not suppose to kiss and tell
---
Ranking up in general, especially in the current state of the game isn't impressive.
---
You should reach a total of 9,110 at level 46.
---
I’m not sure why survivor queues take so long? What happened to all the killers?
---
When he’s playing survivor, I’ll give you that much. However when he plays killer it’s a different story, half the killer videos I’ve seen from him have him being blatantly toxic.

---
here's a little more thank you
---
A huge part of  the problem with the Hallowed Blight event is that the vials were initially capped per side, so in order to receive the full reward you HAD to play both killer and survivor.
---
Of course, Killer queues were having their normal shit fits at the time, so most people opted to go do their survivor vials first. Of course once those were filled it was like a tidal wave of people trying to play killer then because otherwise you're not earning progress toward the event. 
---
If it's anything like last time BHVR learned its lesson and you won't have killer/survivor specific gold coins.
---
Sure but 2000 or 2700 Shards are no less of a grind than BPs for 30 Levels.
---
I FUCKING NEW LULLABY WAS GOING TO BE THERE
---
They seriously do need to fix this though.  
---
Preferably... if they pick you up and drop you at all, the perk activates automatically, with the addition that the killer's anatomy cannot block you from movement during the stun. For instance, if the killer positions himself so your're stuck in an area/corner with no exit and drop you, it won't prevent you from escaping when the perk activates.  
---
There. Problem fixed.   
---
There's *always* a hook close enough so that dribbling always works.  
---
DS is not supposed to work in the killer's favor. Ever. Good lord, it's a *one time escape* if you can land the skill check. 
---
oh boy lots of farm this week, better not get hooked
---
It’s gotten to the point I don’t even read 90% of the memes because they are just shitty reposts and half of them really don’t even have anything to do with DBD. 
---
Ohh, yeah okay that makes sense. I failed to realize how petty people can be ☠️ thanks for the explaination! I guess I'll just try not to get hooked lololol
---
This is true 
---
from a killer main
---
We get it like two to three times every few months it seems
---
Uhhhh, that’s 3 survivor perks my dude
---
Ah that’s the killer kill killer update NICE SCORE
---
I’m having this issue on pc as well as when I’m trying to heal other people.

had a better gamig chair

Tfw you're the Huntress who can't hit that Dwight that's working on the generator off of your porch in Mother's dwelling map :/
---
How exactly is it not fair for solo survivors? The entire point of the change is to prevent survivors from knowing a killers loadout and abusing that knowledge mid-match. If you get sacrificed as a solo survivor that match is over , meaning what they're running doesn't even matter to you anymore. If for whatever reason you HAD to know you can still stay and check at the end.
---
Ideally it'll change with dedicated servers. Happy to tolerate it in solo queue for a year rather than keep the killer perk pool halved because anything that relies on surprise does nothing.

eh no, last update made that each survivor working together on the same gen get a debuff on generator speed
---
Ea, also curious about that. I’m also curious about how the new Prove thyself works. I thought it increases repair speed when you and others are repairing, but when I repair with others the progress bar turns red. Can anybody help us figure out what’s going on?

Well you know, some people are just fucking idiots.  Because I normally run way more toxic builds than that

And yet, here you are, 6 comments deep in a comment train from 6+ hours ago, looking for a comment you can cherry pick to ignore my point.
---
If it truly meant nothing to you, then you wouldn't have commented
---
Once you unlock BBQ for other killers there is no point in leatherface anymore, the chainsaw isn't unique and unless survivors are braindead takes both skill and luck to even hit remotely consistently.
---
The movement speed is good, but pretty much every other killer has something better.
---
Surveillance is amazing man. Especially on Billy or stealth killers.
---
No, you just earn them faster while in game. BBQ&amp;C specifies the bonus is added post-game because most of the other bp boosting perks don't work that way
---
Lol except I didn't camp. They were running around the hook leaving scratches like idiots.
---
No.  A good Bubba plays Billy instead.
---
That's dope as fuck. Also, you friends with Monto? 
---
Self Care has never really been worth it to upgrade. It just increases the healing item healing speed with each tier
---
Im p3 legion, I think ive had enough killer
---
I dont hold grudges or try to "strike back" for the sake of an arguement months ago. I admit im an asshole, but im proud of it. 
---
Today it’s been fine for me. Yesterday was awful and there was a ton of lag
---
A good bubba doesn’t need to play a killer that takes a relatively low amount of skill to play well.

I tagged him on my twitter post and we chatted a bit on there, he wanted to see it with BNPS

So when ever you get to a place other than a main building or killer shack, those other places that have walls, pallets and windows? They are T walls and L walls because if you look at them they are shaped like L and T, therefore L-walls and T-walls, it’s where you’ll do the majority of looping, almost every map has. 
---
They’ll be what you get messed up on most. You learn to master them as killer you’ll be doing good after that, it’ll even help you learn to mind game the killer when you’re playing as survivor because you’ll be thinking like a killer when getting chased as well. 
---
Yup!
---
Yes, it does. The Devs showed hitboxes off when they were explaining the Huntress hitbox change that was reverted a while back. Your hitbox doesn't change when you're working on a Generator or healing teammates, but it does for crouching. 
---
Some people are too worried about Prove Thyself when it's not very possible to do these types of things even in swf. Usually killers will come and chase all of you away. It's rare to have 3-4 together on a Gen. 
---
Neither do I but I just remember a few past instances. Good thing to be proud of, being self aware is a good thing I suppose lol
---
Play something challenging, like Nurse or Hag. Legion is too easy.
---
Honestly I seem to get so lucky with Haunted Grounds. 
---
It pops every match (about 10 so far) and on 8 of them it literally happened within seconds of my finding a survivor. 
---
The first few times I got so confused at why they dropped immediately lol.
---
I'm pretty low rank killer though (just started) so I imagine it becomes much rarer against high skill players. 
---
Who said it first? Me or him?
---
Killer: Toxic survivors
---
Also killer: Checks hook **IMMEDIATELY** after leaving for a moment
---
Hypocrites like you can go fuck themselves (also camping with NOED lol)
---
That cut off at the end slayed me
---
When I'm on the hook and someone is trying to rescue me, does starting the attempt escape animation tell them that its safe to rescue me, or not to come the killer is near?
---
right, like I said in the comment, its not a viable strat by any means, but we just wanted to experiment to see what was possible :)
---
Doesnt make sense. Never have had that happen
---
iunno man it got a lot more attention than I was expecting
---
Whispers is now useless. Nice.
---
I'm bisexual, my friend identifies as they/them but I'm unsure of their sexuality or whatever. 
---
So annoying! My girlfriend and I SWF and we have to reinvite after EVERY SINGLE MATCH. That means closing to the main menu, choosing SWF again, finding her on the Steam friend invite, waiting for the connection to go through, readying up, and then finally getting into a match lobby. WHY?!
---
Wrong.
---
It's the new matchmaking. It's grouping Survivors up before putting them in a lobby.
---
That was 100% not a buff. Making it so you heal people slower is a horrible idea. 
---
Lol I do the gen rap thing as well xD
---
Insidious does not affect the lullaby on Freddy (or Huntress)
---
Dude lick the spot under of my balls. They were running in circles around the hook trying to fuck with me. I mean an I supposed to just run across the map when I know where the survivors are? 
---
And you'd heal your allies slower. It'd be a terrible idea, it punishes everyone else on your team if you have it. 
---
It's not easy at all to hit Leatherfaces chainsaw, if the survivors are good they can 360 you or just go to a pallette or window

---
Woah! I’m early!
---
Makes sense, and that’s the way it should be. That would be insanely overpowered if it were the case. 
---
I definitely learned most of what I know about looping from watching DBD content creators and just trying to replicate what I’d seen them do during videos. It can be really hard at first to try them out during matches because it feels like you’ll just get caught, but there’s no real way to get better other than just going for it
---
this is my video and youre still trash &lt;3
---
I’m new here so I actually don’t know except a fanmade half nude Myers.
---
Salty even on reddit lmao, chill out kid. Just don't call others toxic if you're just as shitty
---
Speaking of Yamoaka's big house, I saw a little light underneath it. It was either a lantern or a toolbox, I'm not sure. I was playing Spirit and Phase Shifted towards the front door and saw it gleaming near the stairs, below the house.
---
I dont think the lullaby counts as a terror radius even though technically when youre awake it does. Interesting question.
---
Im salty but you just told me to fuck myself for playing completely fair? Haha oookay. Answer my question.
---
Yeah, I didn't mean it towards you, just some people who are begging for a nerf. And thank you for the interesting experiment 😁
---
No doubt. I always thought Chi Chi shoulda been top 3 over Naomi on season 8, but that’s just me. I can see her improvement quite a bit, especially compared to Chi Chi on AS3. 
---
No decent bubba will let themselves get 360’ed with the chainsaw out. 
---
Your message makes it relatively apparent that you do not have much experience with bubba. 
---
They were running around the hook and leaving scratches. I knew he was trying to lure me away. Is that not a strategic move?
---
Maybe it's the sound that's bugged with this update. That's not Freddy's fault. 
---
Not to mention Freddy has add-ons that can extend the range of his power almost to, or even surpass, the edge of his lullaby.
---
But was the -10% there pre patch? Just sounds like the perk really hasn’t added to gen efficiency. 
---
Is it? I’ve honestly tried to do this for months, and the wikis mobile layout is pretttty damn atrocious. it’s hard to even get through one page let alone navigate.
---
Regardless, it’s a separate point imo. The game shouldn’t have to direct you to an encyclopedia with bad ux for you to know what’s going on ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Leatherface has high movement speed, a 1 hit ko that can hit multiple survivors in tight quarters, and a fast way to deal with pallets. He is solid mid-tier when played correctly.
---
Haven't played and won't get to for a little while. How did they nerf it?
---
How will she now play the guitar without fingers?
---
Killer runs enduring as well
---
hey im not pregnant &gt;:c
---
Yeah honestly people are gonna try and use this as an argument saying “survivors can knock out gens in 13 seconds” all over the place. I won’t doubt it if I see a comment like that on one of tru3’s videos. Especially the gen rush videos he’s been putting out.
---
There were two survivors running around the hook and I wasn't gonna let him lure me away so the other guy could save him. Isn't that how the game is played? Was I supposed to just let him get the rescue?
---
sounds reasonable but I still don't understand what so bad about playing against Fred. it's like complaining the hatchet hit you when you didn't even hear the lullaby or Billy snipped you across the map. you do realise once you're in Dream it's only time Fred can actually take action? even if you fell asleep he still needs to come close to hit you. basically Wraith who needs just a bit to uncloak but can body block. I am really confused how can fish boi upset anyone.
---
At lower ranks as a new player you should probably just crouch around the map and wait until someone gets injured before you work on a gen because your teammates won’t do gens if you are being chased (yes I’m looking at you Dwight in the locker when killer is on other side of map) and are really not very useful of their time while you occupy the killer. Just wait until the killer is occupied by your teammates and gen rush so you pip and can increase in rank. ( I think it’s something like 2 full gens and 1 unhook is a guaranteed pip? Maybe 2 unhooks that’s just off the top of my head so could be wrong )
---
r/dbdgonewild you're welcome. 
---
All four survivors can only escape through the hatch if all of the generators all already done. Like they said, you have to have the number of survivors left + 1 generators done for the hatch to spawn.
---
Prior to his release, Freddy was probably the #1 most requested license killer for the game and BHVR did it's best to oblige. While BHVR wanted to get the license for the original version of the character, they were only allowed to use the *reboot* properties.
---
BHVR was so disappointed by this news that they refused to use the *actual* main character of the movie Nancy for the *slightly* more interesting Quentin. Nancy was their original choice, but since reboot Nancy is just a steaming pile of suck, they chose Quentin. They said as much during the Freddy release dev stream.
---
As for why they made Quentin look like a goblin instead of a human is anyone's guess, but l wouldn't be surprised if this disappointment was partially to blame
---
Oh season 8 was exhausting, watching my favourites (bar Bob) drop like flies before Derrick and Naomi (who was fine but won... 1 episode that everyone else bombed at?) 
---
I demand Acid Betty's neon fishmonster as the next DbD killer.
---
Look, I’m not trying to start a fight, just saying that I see it differently. It’s always nice to hear a different perspective, it might change your view. I’m legitimately curious about your opinion, and I’ll gladly check out any clips you suggest. 
---
Yeah, that’s when all 5 gens are powered. That’s the earliest it spawns if all 4 people are still alive. Like I said before more gens have to be powered than survivors are alive 
---
You sure are the king of comebacks  
---
You will never admit that you did something wrong, we both know that :)  
---
Alright, keep your secrets
---
It feels so terrible because it feels like dreaming should just be automatic given there's literally nothing to be done about it.
---
I just don't think a mechanic is particularly good when one side doesn't even have to try and the other side can't do anything. It almost feels like freddys only ability is a passive because there is no actual gameplay to using it.
---
Oh no, what have they don't? This is a killer main's nightmare.
---
I don't see two survivors on your recording therefor i don't care.
---
If you are going to make a statement, have at least some proof. The only proof this gives is that you're one of those "haha look at toxic survivors while i'm just as toxic" which i am sick of
---
I main the pig, spirit, hag. I just meant that i play killer so much that i p3'd the newest killer
---
Honestly, why don't you try enter a random discord/community/whatever and just ask to play kill your friends "because I need to train". Let me know how it goes
---
You had NOED. Go for someone who makes themselves the easy target. Dwight clearly hadn't been hooked yet and then you could have gone after the unhooked person if they had been unhooked. Seems like she was far too down on her meter anyway. So she would have died either way. (I'm not being a dick now. I'm just offering tips cause I'm a Spirit main.) Also if you wanna never have to use late game perks anymore. Use Monitor and Abuse/Distressing and Discordance
---
"That's what makes it tricky. If you add a minority Killer, people are going to ask why you're presenting them as psychotic murderers. If you add a minority Survivor, people are going to ask why you're subjecting them to an eternity of torture. There's no winning here."
---
I can't speak for this particular experience as I am not trans, but I am a minority. How do I put it? If handled poorly these things could have some pretty rough consequences. 
---
That being said, my sister was overjoyed with Claudette.((She looks like her. lol)) I don't think minorities would object to seeing killers and survivors that are minorities. I thought it was so cool when Joey was introduced as a skin and wanted to buy Legion. The Doctor's pretty bad ass too. I've enjoyed the way DBD handled diversity thus far. 
---
I may also note that DBD isn't exactly popular amongst leftist gamers. I'm probably out of the 2% that fucking play it and it's frustrating. So whatever's being done, I doubt anyone would even notice. The only thing they care about are Overwatch, Fallout: New Vegas, and Dark Souls.(I mean if there are any groups then please point then in my direction. lol)
---
"And on the opposite side of the coin... Well, when the Saw chapter was revealed, I remember a DbD streamer(Tyde?) putting out a long-winded video talking about how exasperated we was that they chose Amanda and Tapp as the killer and survivor, instead of the other Saw series characters which he insisted were clearly superior. And although he was smart enough not to say it(unlike his fans), there was the implication that BHVR only chose these characters because they were minorities. So there's always the annoying accusations they're trying to turn DbD into a Burger King Kids Club."
---
To be honest? I think that's the most likely response adding we'd be getting. I'm annoyed because Tapp was played by Danny Glover, a popular actor of the time and the most famous in the series and Amanda is the most interesting Jigsaw, the others bored me. 
---
"Honestly, I wish they'd just ignore the whole asinine affair, and give the openly gay character we've been waiting for.(King doesn't count, despite clearly being a power-bottom)"
---
I have always coded David as gay and maybe Nea as bi. But that would be pretty cool. I'd like that.
---
How was I arguing?
---
I'm so sorry for laughing at this. That has to suck.
---
found em on reddit, you can get customs for perks, items, addons, etc. 
---
#STOP RIGHT THERE CRMINAL SCUM
---
I don’t like lithe at all. You’ll find many instances where you never get to use it. Some maps don’t have many spots to use them. I’ve given it several chances. Not my thing. If I use an exhaustion perk it’s always sprint burst. It’s the only one I’ll be guaranteed to use no matter the map. 
---
Yes. It has always been there. The new patch simply updated the progress bar to show red whereas before it didn't.
---
You think I haven't? Lmao. It's why I suggested it. It goes great for me when I don't feel like playing for real. If youre bad at the game the survivors will abuse you. Take 2 pills of get good 3 times a day. 😁
---
Lol now you assume you know me. You haven't contributed anything to the discussion, and want to think you're actually making a point. Buh-bye
---
But for real, new Surveillance is really nice. 
---
Yes.
---
Then you are a bad Leatherface. You can make the same arguement about billy, yet he's considered top tier simply because he can run acrossed the map. Yet without ANY knowledge of survivors whereabouts, then his ability is null in that regard. You can apply your point to any killer but the fact remains, Leatherface can 1 hit people.
---
"Look, moron, my mother used to hang around on a fishing pole and she had things impaled on her that was smarter than your dumb ass."
---
Yeah, especially as you go up in rank and are facing groups that melt through gens in no time, taking a piece off the enemy board early can be vital.  Plus, even if you’re not intending to tunnel, sometimes it just works out that way.  When you’re nowhere near the hook when they got rescued, by the time you get back it’s obviously more likely that the first survivor you find will be the one moaning in pain.  
---
As a Quentin main, l think it's because our face scares people
---
That said, l waited a few days to see if votes would change and it seems like Nea surpassed Quentin by 3 votes
---
True.
---
The real toxicity is the fucking dumbasses who unhook right in front of a killer.
---
If you wanna bitch about tunneling, bitch at the dumbass on your team
---
Haha guilty until proven innocent huh?? I bet you're one of those salty survivors who cries in killers dms because they didn't give your salty ass an easy win. Also I can't use noed if those totems are cleansed. If I was really camping they should be had plenty of time.
---
Huntress be like: "You seein' this shit?"
---
[To that, l say...](https://reddit.app.link/5hayandGHT)
---
Kinda depends on the chase. If during the first chase 2 gens get done then 5 sec after a third then I know that this will probably be my only chance. If I hook I can slow the game a bit and put gen pressure on gens and pick three for a 3GS. 
---
Sweaty swf teams don't give me much choice in the matter. Ruin can help a bit but thats really dependant on the team I'm playing against. 
---
Explain?
---
Deflecting because you know you're wrong. I feel this conversation is over no?
---
Lol you didn't win shit just like you don't win your rounds as survivor! You couldn't even counter any point I made. Crybaby hahaha!
---
Yes correct. The exit wasnt closed. Those spikes always pop up from the killer's perspective when he gets near the exit because the killer cant leave.
---
I've encountered something similar. It said there was still someone on my team still alive (not hooked), but it said the hatch was available, so I found it and escaped through it. Endgame screen said teammate was still alive, but couldn't spectate or anything. 
---
Im getting surviors getting up after i down them. (Ps4) ive had so many games where ill get the last two due to exposed leaving one to crawl away while i hook the other only to see them get up and run to an exit or just run away and hide when the gens arent done. Few times ive looked at the perks in the end game and see nothing that says they can do this. Its really frustrating knowing im going to get a good BP haul only to have 1/4th of slip through my fingers.
---
BHVR won't do shit about toxic behavior. You can't beat em, so join em, be as toxic as you can be, fuck them all. I play Omegablink Nurse and I slug them all and wait for them to DC or bleed out. 
---
When I run out of addons, I play Toxic Leatherface or Hillbilly. I'll use Iron Grasp and Agitation, carry someone to the basement, then block the doorway into the basement until they die.
---
takes 5 years 😂
---
You could literally heal 25% faster than normal with SC. Yes it was a nerf to *healing* But it was not a nerf to self care. IF you don't like being wrong don't spout wrong information.
---
The song? Scooby-Doo theme it sounds like. 
---
Oink,oink meggie
---
Omg so toxic, not like he was t-bagging to get you off the hook so the other one could save
---
when more than one person is on a gen, there is a 10% debuff per person. What Prove Thyself does is tries to counteract that, but it's not an exact 1-1 percentage. Prove Thyself ALMOST counteracts it.
---
Well I’d argue there’s a couple killers that can handle those survivors nowadays but yeah, bubba can’t really do tons against people like the depip squad.
---
Honestly I’d argue huntress has just as or possibly stronger basement potential than bubba but he is still my child and I will nurture him forever.
---
Sure!
---
What I mean is at level 50, Bloodwebs start to get kind of expensive to go through. Depending on your luck and what nodes you prioritize, it can take 45-55k BP to finish a single web. Also, something to keep in mind is that BP caps at 1 million, so you have  to spend it before you reach that amount or it just gets wasted.
---
So to "prep" them, I'm basically going through the web as normal, until it's left in a state where my next node purchase ends the current web and creates a new one. And this is important for the next reason. I'm doing this because I'm currently hovering around 700k-900k BP since I'm currently not in a mood to push a new character to Prestige 3.
---
Events for this game, like the upcoming Lunar Event, typically utilize [special offerings](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Envelope) in order to participate. These offerings are guaranteed spawns on all new webs once the event actually starts. Typically you'll see 1 to 3 appear, but I've heard of more showing up. What's more, these special offerings typically are close to the center of the bloodweb making them super easy to buy. 
---
For level 1 characters this isn't an issue, you'll burn through the first 20 levels like nothing and see a ton of these things. But on maxed out characters, you'll be spending the entire cost of a bloodweb just to get 1-3 and probably not recoup the cost in bonus BP from the offerings.
---
**tl;dr** In anticipation of the Event since I'm close to the BP cap, I'm making it easier for my future self by giving an easy level-up on all my characters. Instead of spending 45k-55k BP to get them a level after the event starts, I only need to spend ~145,000 BP to get ALL 29 characters a single level. Which means I'll have access to a nice hoard of the new offering and can quickly get into binging on the event. By the time I run out of offerings I'll have enough BP to load up some more characters and start all over.
---
Shit, before I started queue I hadnt hit puberty. Now I'm a half-year away from a degree. 
---
SWF is a cancer that will prevent this game from ever being truly fun. It’s wjy lobbies are so long on PS4 - in addition to the shitty FPS, SWF is a scourge 
---
True. It’s a must to couple it with urban evasion. But like I said, every time I use lithe I can’t find an opportunity to use it when I need it. Windows too far away and pallets get broken immediately by the killer. 
---
Well I appreciate that. I’ve met others on here that take a simple disagreement as a war commencing. 
---
Isnt it common knowledge it spawns after two generators are done? This has literally been the way for forever
---
Nothing sucks more than games when you just know you're the only one to blame for not hooking a survivor. 
---
Yuck, don't appreciate me ;)
---
It’s worse. Framerate wasn’t great but it was passable before. Now it’s horrendous 
---
Bonus points if someone is on the hook and they're just standing in the gate doing nothing
---
But what if the devs wanted to release the actual thing?
---
For future reference, someone getting a hatch escape gives you plenty of BP actually. So there’s no need to slug really in those situations. You’re sure they’re not using unbreakable?
---
Yeaaah. I used to be a survivor only player and I hated tunneling, but then I started playing killer and I was like. 'Oh.'
---
I said the same and he called *me* an idiot lmao.
---
LMAO
---
What error message are you getting?
---
He's my best friend and we are joking lol
---
Half of the games in a nutshell. I've become kind of jaded to helping end round because I know people will just throw me to the dogs for helping them.
---
Its a legit strategy for killers that need easy downs/can't bring enough pressure otherwise.Play how you want the way you want but trying to make yourself seem like an apex predator for tunneling injured survivors is laughable at best.
---
Blood Warden, Hex: Devour Hope, any obsession perk that isn't Dying Light (since you can have the obsession figure that out mid-match), Spies from the Shadows (the new version), and Spirit Fury.
---
Yeah, it's totally just NOED that's affected. /s
---
It would be nice if the game could update without EAC shitting its pants acting like there has been modifications to the game files.
---
Yeah, EAC, it's called it's been fucking updated. I know you aren't use to it but I shouldn't have to verify the integrity literally every update.
---
Other than your ad hominem arguments I see nothing in your comments. I literally countered every single one of your pointless claims and you gave no valid argument.
---
&gt; And you'd heal your allies slower.
---
If you run self-care, odds are you're not going to be healing others very much anyway.
---
those shitposts have more content than this. these are forced to a point where they aren't even funny anymore
---
Lmao.
---
There is no improvement. In fact I swear bloodlust lag has returned worse than ever. Family residence is a loss once you go there, and something is up with the lunges too.
---
Happy cake dayy
---
I know I sure did. First few times having no idea how to escape a chase I just watched those who knew what they were doing. It was super helpful for getting the basics down.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but prove thy self does not currently work? I swear in the patch notes it said it didn’t work but was fixed internally
---
it's fun to dumpster on them and watch the vod though. epic salt
---
I bitch at both parties involved. Neither had to do it but both did.
---
I fucking hate the corn it never helps me as a survivor, and it only seems to hurt me when I'm a killer. I only hate the swamp more.
---
Lithe isn't proc'ing on vaults anymore either. Honestly, how do you fuck something up this badly. lol
---
PhiPhi plays too. Idk if she streams though.
---
Ur dum
---
Did a kill your friends lobby, the amount of cursing my friends were doing playing survivor, wooo
---
Hadn't thought of that, in my language the movie it ,is called the thing.
---
I basically made it so that my Laurie and Nea will always be lv 1 since l already have their perks from the shrine, so l only have a 1/8 chance of being totally screwed
---
Host connection failure I believe. 
---
Hmm, I might turn on auto click and use this to play random killer!
---
Until dawn with a wendigo and mike
---
It’s already been stated gold coins are involved in this lunar event also
---
No. It only spawns when the number of remaining gens is equal to the number of dead survivors. 
---
That is:
---
3 gens left and 3 survivors dead
---
2 gens left and 2 survivors dead 
---
1 gen left and 1 survivor dead
---
0 gens left and 0 survivors dead
---
this will never happen. no one would buy dlcs anymore 
---
I'm sorry, are you arguing? You used a question mark, which to you is arguing, bit we don't have to! I'm not mad at you :) I really don't understand what I did wrong, and since you won't help me to understand, which means you're just here to be mean to people.
---
Fuck off you virgin fortnite gamer 
---
urban is good for stealth, and youre right about WGLF. haven't run it in months, if i want bp then i'll play killer
---
Honestly it'll just take time. A big part of looping is knowing where to go, and gauging how many times you can run a loop before you need to throw the pallet or move on, etc. It also helps to learn the different types of structures and where pallets can spawn. I'd recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM) by OhTofu in which he explains the different type of structures and the efficient ways to run them.
---
Thanks!
---
Uhhh no 
---
Such a snowflake lol
---
Weak bait
---
oh yes indeed. let me appease you with that for now.&lt;3 
---
Also fix the clothes clipping issues on some people. I know if there's a lot of different outfit that down look so good, because the top is clipping into the bottom or the hair is flying everywhere when youre on a gen
---
WGLF is the only good perk here
---
Because the killer doesn’t give a fuck and just wants you to leave
---
Is Leader bugged? I was playing with a friend, I was running Prove Thyself and Leader. My friend said they never got any Leader buff
---
The shrine sometimes has 3 surv perks
---
Okay I Bit Harsh I'm Only 12 And Just Trying To Have Fun With It And Yeah I Know A Little Overpowering, So I'm Going To Try To Improve And Make A New Killer...But How Did You Feel About The Survivor?
---
Try getting a match on Haddonfield.
---
Oh, and for good measure make sure your headset isn't on too low. Might just miss it otherwise.
---
Seriously though, the starting music is a bit on the loud side. Don't damage your ears.
---
Ok
---
Well I alert them to where I am so it’s not like I just sit there waiting for them. 
---
The pants wouldn't connect to his torso properly, so like, there would be an awkward gap sometimes
---
omg Trixie being a new killer, The Doll! 
---
The current text for Self-care is bugged, but it still functions as normal. The efficiency bonus it gives is 10%/15%/20%, despite what it currently reads. 
---
And whats this means is that 1 second of  self-healing with a medkit will only drain .9/.85/.8 charges from the medkit. 
---
Are you sure? I’ve never seen this
---
 I like their sense of humor :)
---
TS just do gens. Camping killer won’t stop camping if you’ll come to save your teammate all the time.
---
I think 2.5 just fucked up the descriptions. It should be the other way around with 25/35/45% as it goes up in tier.
---
Ohh okay that makes a lot of sense. Thank you
---
Deflecting because you realized youre toxic and have no argument? Or is this not right because your previous logic was flawed?
---
Ah gotcha. Thank you
---
You think DbD players are too stupid to understand "allows you to self-heal without a medkit 1/2/3 times in a trial at half the usual speed?"
---
Omg i thought it was only me!! These wait times are ridiculous for survivors!!
---
Are you saying that I perceive only bad players so they should be buffed no matter the amount of good players? I don't remember calling for buffs I was just calling out the bs that survivors get without complaints.
---
F to you my good sir. 
---
Only when one survivor is left. 
---
Jeez don't be so angry. Maybe you just need to be in their shoes and feel the trauma that they have
---
Good bubbas push people into unsafe areas. There’s a lot more to bubba than you seem to think....
---
You hear that?
---
It's the sound of this post going over your head
---
The New Prove Thyself just makes it so the gen speed is the same as before the patch. They nerfed the speed of multiple people on 1 gen, each person that comes on it gives a 10% speed nerf. PT only negates that
---
Kind of, sort of off topic but earlier today (on PS4), I was downed by a pig and she put the trap on my head then hooked me. When I got unhooked, I guess the game didn’t register she put it on so I went about my business because it wasn’t beeping and the boxes weren’t lit up for me. I ended up being able to walk out the gate with it on, it was odd. 
---
Also when I walked up to the boxes (after eventually finding them), it gave me the text to mash R1 to start trying to get it off (which I didn’t do because the thing had been on my head for over two minutes at that point) so it was definitely on my head. Anyone else had this happen? 
---
I hope my shitty crop job made this pst even worse to look at.
---
It is but I find bubbas chainsaws to be more satisfying due to more skill being involved most of the time. 
---
I’m talking which I prefer and which I enjoy playing more. Skill was never mentioned by me as it would be foolish to suggest bubba is better than billy. 
---
nah if it gets a good spot and nobody spawn next to it,it pretty much can get you 3-4 hooks before a gen gets started

---
just a lil bit
---
It’s been like that on pc for a while
---
How would you go about pushing a survivor into an unsafe area? They see you, run to a pallette, and once you break it they run to the next loop. 
---
Still not the actual problem
---
Only when they have red ping
---
Yes. Only sacrifices count. Mories will not work. And yeah, it’s 25 of each. 
---
Again, no need for the name calling.
---
No, I can't predict the outcome of games. Which means for all I know the survivor will loose the killer and come rescue me if I keep struggling.
---
That's fine you can play whatever you want. Just trying to get my point across
---
Simply put it takes practice and map knowledge.
---
I'm having considerable frame drops on my 1060 i7 8750 combo.
---
Pre patch had no issues, now it's stuttering at times. 
---
Want me to dig up a list of every shrine ever in dbd to show how "common" it is? 
---
Woah fuck McCote hits the gym every day.
---
Well, he actually does need a nerf. 
---
Just checked the log. There's no decisive strike Nerf
---
They didn't. He's just saying that new players aren't able to hit the skill check
---
I still don't get how you stop the survivor to run to the next loop, that argument makes no sense 
---
Nah, that's just taunting. Teabagging is tied directly to the crouch motion.
---
I came here hoping to see this. I'm impressed that someone did it
---
I don't take noed, or care when they looks at my perks. This change is barely anything for me. But when 3 people act like you have blood warden while their friend is dead. Kind of a clear sign no? 
---
There's signs people know your perks earlier, like not opening the exit gate until the exact second their friend leaves the chase (which if they know that also means they are in a swf), or opening the exit gate but staying far far away from them so you won't see their aura before you activated blood warden even. this entire thing makes taking perks like blood warden much less fun and surprising, blood warden is supposed to be a surprise perk that gives you a large advantage later in the game by being unexpected. 
---
Let's say someone dies with 2 gens left, and only 2 totems have been cleared. By him dying he either just saved his team 45 seconds by saying there is no noed, or did just died normally. Personally I'd like it more if by someone dying the enemy team won't get an advantage.
---
He's bad because he has a lower skill cap....hmm. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Hillbilly has no surprise potential just because he can run fast. His terror radius is the same as LF. Your logic doesn't disable the fact that he can still 1 hit a survivor or all 4 for that matter. My point is that he isn't bad and certainly not as trash as the aptly named "The Nightmare" that everyone compares him to. 
---
This should have been in the game since day 1 lol
---
My bloody valentine killer
---
I mean you haven’t even given a case so ya know. 
---
High end bubba players are significantly better than killers like trapper and wraith. Potentially higher than doctor as well. 
---
Simply not the second worst killer.  
---
We still see a lot more billys and nurses at high ranks ( because many people consider them them best) so instead of nerfing those 2 i made this list to see what you could give the other killers
---
The other option would be to nerf nurse ( especially nurse but thats a rough one )
---
and billy
---
The killer variety at high ranks is kind of bad
---
Meanwhile, Prove Theyself and Leader are now busted OP.
---
Because nothing else you said is relevant, I've seen fucking Tydetyme 4k with Iron Freddy, doesn't mean he is good at the game. There is nothing particularly impressive in reaching R1, especially with the emblem system. 
---
Yes, getting sniped makes it harder, but that doesn't mean that it's still impressive, because you still shouldn't be depipping.
---
Just because it a strategy doesn’t mean they have to do it. 
---
I never said it was their job to let me have fun. 
---
Your making a number of assumptions here and that makes me think there’s no need for us to hold a conversation. 
---
I've had killers run into me and not notice in that swamp. I love the swamp maps on both sides of the fence because hilarity always ensues.
---
I would say Self-Care while other person works on a gen as getting the gen done ASAP is important. That said if you're not near a gen or the killer might come back normal healing is faster and might be better.
---
Huntress hits you with hatchets that can go through loops, Billy can surprise chainsaw, Wraith can get an early hit, pig can get an early hit and stop survivors from doing gens, trapper can trap loops, and so can hag. Clown cancles looping, spirt also cancles looping. Survivors are dumb if they save near leatherface and if they are caught togethee that can disperse and you might only catch one. He is as bad as they say and that's my position
---
Oh interesting
---
It's not 'you guys' mate. I play killer and survivor. And I think the point I made is that these killers I am referring to are not quitting because it's an SWF. I know it's not an SWF because I'm in the lobby, I'm playing solo, and I see everyone spawn in.  I also see when we all seem to spawn in together which I believe killers perceive as a sign of us being SWF when we are not.
---
Just because it's a strategy for survivors to do gens doesn't mean they have to do it right?
---
"Im not sure if it requires a downside". *Brings two instaheals, two purple flashlights, two purple tool boxes* -_-
---
Sorry for the insults. 
---
But I think we are misunderstanding each other. We are talking about different cases 
---
If you are not sure if the killer is chasing the guy, you have a very good point. You have no reason to die on the hook deliberately.
---
But if you know for sure that the killer is chasing the guy, you need to realize that the probability of the guy losing the killer and rescuing you is very minimal compared to him finding a trap door WHILE being chased. 
---
A good trapper will place traps where they are not expected, and any wraith can get an easy early hit and also block of pallettes and windows. Doctor shocks people and potentially makes them unable to throw down pallettes and vault, including the ability to stop them from healing or doing gens
---
Hello, I'm a rank 6-8 killer and I've been wondering how to counter this current meta of what a lot of people call "gen-rushing" Besides the obvious which is running hex ruin.  Also just what are some good strats for tracking survivors since I tend to struggle with that as well. Thank you for your time ☺
---
Exactly what I am saying.
---
Wdym I just did. I told you that it's easy to counter and how you can counter
---
I've been running Plunderers Instinct and Ace in the Hole, and it's been amazing. I've been getting purples and pinks all day, I've even gotten dull keys out of it
---
The conversation is definitely over; you're not contributing anything to it.
---
Omg I literally got this 4 days ago with 100+ hours on Huntress!! Where’s. My. PRIZE!?
---
Needs more jpeg!
---
A bunch of perks nobody uses? You won’t see them enough to care
---
It's still pretty bad. Unlimited time and range is nice and all but requires you to kick gens to activate it still and it's especially bad on Lery's ward. I kinda wish it worked more like the Wraiths add-on where you can see the intensity of gens progression. 
---
It was working, the bar simply wasn't red.
---
Yeah, its been over for almost 2 hours. Thanks for clarifying the legitimacy and validity of this post.
---
Those perks are pretty bad. 
---
Perk one only works twice in the entire match.
---
Perk two blatantly sucks. Trading a grab to damage a gen is one of the worst things ever.
---
Perk three actually seems pretty good.
---
I mean, an hour before you commented, OP received and acknowledged a real answer, so why did you even feel the need to spread your negativity.
---
REV UP THOSE FRYERS!
---
Make Your Choice - Eternal Damnation or One with the Entity!
---
That may be true, but we have seen enough 4 man claudettes with flashlights to know that it's more than likely a swf team even if it's not and as a mostly killer main that isn't fun. It's a headache. 
---
Most would rather leave, wait 4 seconds, and try again. Killers want to have fun, but toxic swf teams have made that so very difficult. 
---
Yeah ... russians are fucking idiots
---
Been out of the game for a while, liked it, but got tired of the toxicity. Tempted to play again, how is it these days? Should I still expect to be told that I was cheating and should kill myself if I do better than the killer as a survivor or vice versa?
---
Tell me about it. Seriously, I play killer plenty, all the way to red ranks, and I have never quit a lobby like these bunch of pussy, crybaby, 'poor me' killers.
---
This isn’t what this post is about
---
How i play every game vs how randoms i end up with play.
---
Aside from Gia Gunn, none of the people in that video are trans.
---
If they have Chinese or Cyrillic characters in their name, they’re almost 10000000% hacking or toxic. Applies to basically any game. 
---
Firstly, I wasn't talking about you, sorry if you interpreted it like that.
---
Secondly, he said he wanted to not DIE first second. Not that he didn't want to get hooked.
---
&gt; Just hiding is really easy and usually lets you not get hooked at all   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Unless the killer you're playing against is an idiot you're going down eventually. 
---
The first statement is simply untrue. Also, those two statements contradict each other, so which one is it? 
---
How many totems spawn each round? 4? 5?
---
Still very toxic. 
---
Don't just downvote it. Answer it.
---
If I get a 0k with nurse, is she bad? Tbh im getting tired lol.
---
There is no place that isn’t expected once you are in the upper ranks. Trappers main gist is pushing survivors towards dead zones that create with traps.
---
Any wraith with addons* wraith is quite addon dependant at high end gameplay. As are many killers but wraith especially follows this rule. 
---
Doctors I will admit, at the highest level of play can end chases very fast if they are amazing with their shocks.
---
You’re completely spackered
---
My point is that you can't correlate doing good with a killers ability with the killer being good
---
Too true, when there was the double bp me and 3 pf my friends took bloodyparty. We loaded into the game and killer instantly dc-d. I thought that he was deranking but the same thing happened next game and i didn’t have any bloodypartys left after this
---
Let's just say dbd is main exporter of salt in North America.
---
How are they impossible to win? 
---
Better than nothing I guess... But man, losing a chase against a P3 Claudette because scratch marks are broken is infuriating.... 
---
Already said I’m too lazy for a full explanation as it would take multiple paragraphs but go watch zubatlel play lestherface. Or ardetha, he excels as LF as wel.
---
Straight people aren’t allowed to play dead by daylight anymore. I SAID WHAT I SAID 
---
Dead hard works once in a match if u can play and  "pallet teleporting" isnt even a thing
---
This patch is a big filled mess
---
Every other killer has a better ability than leatherfaces end of story
---
ooo awesome new “medium” vault action! 
---
Umm ok I guess
---
Ye
---
Why weren’t you recovering...,
---
As a survivor main let me help you out
---
1. You should not run noed
---
2. No rancor or you no what not perks at all
---
3. While we at it no add on because they toxic 
---
4. Even though the survivors should have cleanses the hex totem you are toxic because you had the audacity to try to hook a survivor
---
But for real I'm glad u hooked that dwight they could have just left and I'm sure that dwight was ready to teabag you at the exit gate. 
---
Great argument kiddo. Your opinion trumps fact, I understand. 
---
But it kind of is? I had over 40 long range downs and the achievement didn't pop when I was playing today. Saw this post, mimicked where you were at since mine was still saying 100, got the achievement. I'm just trying to help anyone who has enough for this achievement, but didn't get it to pop after thus update.
---
lol new survivor from Lost 
---
happy cake day
---
Honestly survivors dont need more stealth nerfs right now. 
---
General reposti!
---
Well I guess I just got to get better at hitting those skill checks for ruin because I would rather not waste my time to look
---
I was to invested in what my friend was doing. I knew y’all would roast me about that. 
---
Oh wow thanks for the explanation! I suppose I’ll take it as a compliment that he thought I cheated all my achievements. 
---
If you got a few minutes and don't mind watching videos, look up ohTofu's video guides. Usylis (sp) and others also have good ones.
---
If you have Kate, equip Windows of Opportunity. It'll guide you towards pallets and prevent you from running into areas where the pallets have already been used.
---
Keep your camera on the killer as you lead them around the pallet. It's easier to do on PC because you can snap your camera around faster. Most of the mistakes come from taking your eyes off the killer, or losing sight of the killer.
---
Practice "Hugging" the loop as fast as you can. The tighter circle you can run the better.
---
As you get more experienced you'll get to know which loops are safe and which are not so safe. You'll also start learning specific killer's tricks. It's just practice and some take to it faster than others. 
---
I was reading this while waiting fro a match. When I loaded in I started doing this. Killer dodged the lobby
---
Wrong addons. Fastest is one brown and one yellow.
---
I think DC has to happen **during** the pick-up animation. At least, [that's how it happened for me] (https://youtu.be/euWyFuwUg40), dunno about you.
---
&lt;3 same. also you’re not alone and you matter real talk
---
Is it the same people?
---
I play killer and I don't quit any lobbies. Most games I do well or okay. This includes games against 4 Claudettes/Fengs, Flashlights, whatever, I do fine. 
---
I play every game. I don't see all these many many toxic SWF teams you say exist. Am I really just so good at playing killer I don't notice? I don't think so.
---
I do come across what I consider toxic players occasionally. I do get beat by what are probably well practiced SWF teams sometimes. I do just get beat by some good players on other occasions. Most games are fine win or lose.
---
I see you fellow Huntress ✊🏻
---
I call bullshit on this one, Ive had the hatch spawn at my feet after completing the second generator with four people left. I remember this because its literally the only game Ive brought a key so I just left because why not. I also walk past hatches all the time with four people left and not all the gens are done. There's no way this is really true, or there's a serious bug with hatch spawn on ps4
---
wow i reached the pinnacle of stupidity with one single comment gg ez 
---
Well i have seen hatchets hitting people after they have moved behind a wall so this doesnt make sense
---
This. Clean Rag and Socket Swivel. If I did the math correctly it would be around 12 seconds.
---
"BL makes me untouchable" - that Nea, probably
---
Yeah i know it won't, just wishful thinking. But you are supposed to buy the DLC's for the characters mostly not just for the perks. I mean Myers and Pig are solid.
---
Except for Leatherface. You buy the perk in that case. :P
---
None, unless they can guarantee cosmetics
---
OnO not this
---
Its a viable strat if you're bad a chasing.A survivor has advantages during a chase and loses them after pallets go and bloodlust kicks in.What killer are you using that you can only put pressure on injured survivors?
---
Since being on pc I've played big corn twice as nurse...I hate it. 
---
I like Bill cause he just doesn't seem to care
---
 Check the updated vid
---
Had this happen a few times. If you're standing where the hatch should spawn, it won't until you walk away. I saw it previously which caused my friend to not be able to escape while downed.

---
Worst feeling I ever had was 4 of the original bnp which just completed a gen
---
Oh yea, I wreck with Nurse. Once I get the ball rolling there’s almost nothing they can do to escape. It’s gotten to where survivors actually message me saying how good i am.  
---
Best add ons are anxious gasp and ataxic respiration (green) or dull bracelet and catatonic boys treasure (yellow). Anything more than 2 blinks just slows you down and reduces the window to blink precisely or attack. Anything that increases fatigue is just a bad idea in case you miss. If you know you can’t reach the survivor *don’t* swing even though you want to, as this reduces fatigue. Fatigue on the first blink is shorter than the second, so there is strategy to stopping after 1 blink as many survivors will turn around to evade the second blink, walking right into you. Learn to gauge distance, this is especially important between the short distances between walls, pallets, and obstacles that stand between you and survivors. Under shooting is better than overshooting your target and keeping the camera tilted upward helps prevent getting caught on objects until you get more used to it. Also when lunging after a blink get used to turning simultaneously to ensure you land the hit.

I’ve only been playing nurse since earlier month and this has helped me get plenty of 4ks. The perks i’m currently using are: bbq &amp; chili, ruin, nurse’s calling, and blood warden
---
You're really stupid. 
---
and myers also have a full stack of PWYF and unlimited EW3
---
As long as youre compitent its not that big of a deal, just read the room, as they say.
---
Just leave people to die unless you seem them trying to help you out earlier in the game. I've been fucked over so many times after helping people, but once in awhile you get those precious teammates who will stay to help even if there's NOED.

What?
---
I feel like you and others are completely missing the point of my post which is killers keep dodging lobbies that are not SWF (and even if some might be, a larger proportion of them are actually shit anyway based on my experience), and also the reason they are dodging the lobbies is not because it is SWF (which is obvious because we all spawn in at separate times/a player leaves and is replaced), but simply because they look like more experienced players (bloodied outfits) and/or all equip items (usually toolboxes). THIS is happening a lot and it IS NOT against SWFs.
---
Ok so lets look at this from a human behavior standpoint. Humans will almost always choose the more pleasurable or easier pathway. That's just how we are wired with some exceptions to this. 
---
This means that either you're right and toxic swf is rare which If that's the case then it wouldn't cause the collective player base to constantly leave lobbies. Meaning what you're complaining about doesn't exist and your post has no merit
---
Or
---
I'm right and the amount of toxic swf teams is not only large but an ever growing base. Some of whom were killers previously and want the same endorphin rush original suvivor mains get from teabagging at the exit gates because that rush stopped being supplied as a killer main in place of frustration.
---
I am right. I know it because this is what your complaining about and though I am new to this reddit page it seems to be what is most complained about. Killers DCing, lobby ditching, or very long wait times, but that is a result of the cause of asshole swf teams. The swf are the Pebble thrown into the pond and the killers leaving are the resulting waves. Or even Facecamping, tunneling, or basement camping. (Though IMHO, tunneling is a legitamte tactic but only under certain circumstances)
---
You are probably an exception to the rule
---
Does the perk "This is not Happening" affect DS success zone?
---
Not a prob. I run it a lot on Pig for some cheeky kills on people that have already spent the whole match trying not to let their party hat kill them but I'd never heard it called noed until I came on the dbd reddit.
---
Hard to say, could just be psychological but I feel the same way. Red arrow debuff all the time for me as well
---
true xd i bought myers because im a huge halloween fan
---
The entity snatched the wig
---
Now I want there to be an actual gloating hook that occasionally spawns.
---
Maybe there is a difference between platforms. I am on PS4 and I probably should have said this in my initial post. 
---
Can you clearly see you have an SWF in lobby on PC?
---
Edited, thanks for the work check
---
&gt;mid chase, injured survivor
---
&gt;two of my hexes are being cleansed and like 5 of my traps are triggered, notifications hurt

&gt;proceed to panic between my precious devour hope and chased surv
---
Do not put a capital letter on every word, it becomes really annoying to read. 
---
I hate to tell you this....... 
---
Nice name
---
I still dont understand? Expand upon whatever it is youre trying to suggest.
---
Same, put the controller on my lap and accidentally pressed one of the triggers with my leg right before the match started

I've been there myself.  Hang in there it gets better :)
---
Yes, this is my personal opinion as well.  Self-healing without perk/item assistance should be very slow (Like 60 seconds of time slow), to be more about being able to fix that last bit if you and your friend get split up before he can finish you off or your med kit just runs out.  I'd reduce the odds of skillchecks to zero as well for this type of selfcare (So that Freddy doesn't get even further shoved into the dumpster, and to make the heal speed consistent).
---
Silent Hill.
---
Killer: Pyramid Head
---
Survivor: Ideally James Sunderland, but they'd probably get the movie license, so Rose would be fine.
---
Why are survivors BP's per game so low :(
---
all of those would have been hits unreal lol
---
 Nope.
---
I've always found pig to be the easiest to face off against. I'd say the hardest is Freddy cause you can't see him till your dragged in, the only cue you have is the nursery rhyme when he's close. 
---
Sooo, the same speed as 2.4.0 without any perk.
---
Wait what
---
I’m confused....
---
Oof
---
why Isn’t it working? 
---
MY EYES!!
---
Idk..
---
on second though this may be a bad idea
---
bull shit 
---
Do you get more xp for letting the last person escape? I've seen the killer let the last person escape multiple times. One of the games the killer literally downed a person and put them down at the hatch.
---
this one of the bugs where you dont complain or something like that. You just laugh and enjoy it xd
---
oh then sorry, sucks D:
---
most of the time you can tell it's swf if their profiles are not private. plus as a red rank killer you mostly face same people quite often and like 30% of time I just know they're in team, not always on discord though. and I know some teams that frequently play together and know their synergy so I dodge, obviously. I also play with these people as survivor, so, you know... don't want to get left on a hook because I was playing dirty against them. 
---
It’s not my fault... you weren’t protecting it
---
Wait, the hatch only spawns when they all die? I could’ve sworn I’ve seen it spawn once 2 gens were done
---
I would encourage players to just sprint to a gen and do it, then look for a totem if needed.  The killer may find you but as you get better (and if other people rush to gens as well) typically you will get downed and they'll finish 2 gens in that time. At higher ranks ruin does make you flex but by doing so you should/ will get better at chases so others will do gens too. I say this because if everyone say looks for totems first, then when someone gets caught and no one is on a gen, that's time poorly used as survivors are the strongest at the beginning of the game.
---
Thanks! Great artwork! Nose blood looks strange though. o_O
---
what the hell. I couldn’t protect it because you kept on missing it
---
Survivors always have something to complain about when there is something that stops them from gen rushing. Same reason why alot of people hate legion i think. But in the end unnerving and distressing are one of the best perks of doctor cause it makes him stall the game longer and makes it easier to find people at the start.
---
bug or buff ?
---
literally ran the same huntress aroiund for all the gens in 3 separate games just for my teammates to leave me when she facecamps
---
lol i am getting poop medkits still
---
It’s not even enabled 1010028383.p
---
I'm glad you find respite here, I hope you find some loving non-toxic friends around here to talk to, That's the best medicine for your condition. The best of hopes for you, Kate.
---
(All Kates get free hatch escapes today.)
---
Curse you and your pallet vaulting! How shall I catch you now? I knew I should have stayed Nurse!
---
He is not dabbing he is running.
---
ok u two, can u stop now? 
---
it happens if u disconnect during the game aswell 
---
Thank you! My favorite anti-suicide thing is from the audiobook from World War Z, it's essentially a we're better off with you then without you as hard as that may be to believe sometimes! I'm sorry you're struggling right now. If you need to talk to someone professional the hotlines and chat rooms are free: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/
---
Always glad to have you!
---
hold on can we reset it?
---
It's Dbd. I'm sure it's a bug
---
[removed]
---
I've got Leatherface to level 50 and have just started playing Myers. Struggling without Ruin to slow the game down. 
---
this is good
---
Only the people inside my head
---
All I get for looping a killer for over 2 genis is a facecamp
---
I don't get why they'd remove it now. Figured they'd keep it until the event starts.
---
It *literally* tells you they have Unnerving Presence right next to your perks.
---
All skill checks have the same speed. The only time it's hard is if you haven't warmed up your skill checks or if it's a very early skill check.
---
I'd say next week, but no one knows for sure (outside of BHVR)
---
Actually it does seem to have gotten slightly better. I’m not getting as many times toxic messages as when I first started playing. 
---
I’m sorry your return was met with inane retardation though. 
---
Well if its not your first you know it's coming, you can see the unnerving icon in the bottom right corner.. 
---
Ah bugger now we have to try and figure out what perks they have without 1 person dieing.
---
How do u manage to beat her??? I find her annoying to face because she crouches everywhere and not only do you have to do 5 generators but when u get a trap around your head u also have to go to those machines to take it off and cant run because that increases the time for getting your head blown off
---
Hello, I just wanted to ask where you got this Icons? :) Download plzz?
---
The only "Adept &lt;survivor name&gt;" achievement I don't have. I just can't play with OoO, too curious.
---
Again, I play killer mate. And I play survivor. I know what it's like playing both. I don't lobby ditch as a killer, and I'm saying as a killer to other killers they shouldn't do either, specifically when it is NOT an SWF. But I think it's just as lame constantly ditching lobby's that actually are SWF whether you know for sure or not.
---
All these cry baby killers mains jumped on my post downvoting and furiously defending their right to ditch SWF lobbies-which was not what my post was about. It was about ditching NON-SWF lobbies. 
---
I feel that many are clearly not just trying to skip SWF and that is lame. I feel, from my experience as killer, that this toxic SWF topic is blown out of proportion and is being used to excuse the issue I raised. Certain Killers are just constantly looking for easy games with no items, no Claudettes, no signs of experience etc and quitting lobbies until they get it. This is happening a great deal on PS4. It is not good and should not be defended.
---
I agree for the most part. I’ve always found it weird that survivors bitch and moan about tunnelling when the killers job is to KILL. That being said I typically avoid it because it isn’t fun. If I can’t find the person who unhooked someone while I was nearby I’ll chase the injured person and it’s their fault for being seen, but I don’t choose the injured one over a healthy one unless they’ve been a dick all game. 
---
Wait, generator on the second floor? Does this mean that the new map will have two floors? Perhaps an old house or something. 
---
Pig is a mid-tier (higher mid-tier since she just got a buff)killer, but she takes a bit of time and practice to use efficiently. However, she's a really fun killer that squeaks when stunned and can t-bag survivors, just don't count on your traps to kill, use them to stall the game. 
---
Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Legion and Cannibal are the easiest to pick up, but they're also mid to low tier killers. Nurse (PC), Spirit and Hillbilly are the strongest killers in the game, but they have the highest skill caps and take a lot of practice to master.
---
So it all depends on your playstyle and who you want to invest time in, really. Hag, Huntress, and Shape are stronger killers that don't have such a high skill cap.
---
I wonder if there's an option to turn it off
---
It still wastes the Time of a Killer thats why the perk is so annoying. Love how some think it needs skill lul.
---
On PC top-tier Nurse is your worst nightmare.
---
If you wanna just win play nurse if you wanna win and have fun huntress and spirit are super fun Billy's also a good pick 
---
what’s cicada 3301?
---
p.00625513
---
What if RE2 has its own Moonrise event FUCK
---
It's equal to "Gen Rushing" because, obviously, you're gonna work on a Gen that already has progress instead of going for one that has none.
---
I get that it isn't fun to deal with but you're absolutely right that it's legit.
---
Finally a Killer buff!!
---
Why would anyone run to the exit? People are usually standing here and teabagging.
---
His name is McCote actually 
---
I don't get killers who dc after BPS. Its free bloodpoints lost...
---
Oof, not bad
---
oh shit.
---
This isn’t necessarily about my gameplay but rather the game itself on console. 
---
I have a keyboard and mouse hooked up to my ps4 and noticed when I hit the space bar while in dead by daylight the menus hud changes to how it would look if I were on pc, then quickly changes to how it would look on console.
---
 (Think of things like the ready up button, it usually has the triangle symbol then ready up but when I hit space on the keyboard the triangle symbol disappears like it would be on pc)
---
Has native k+m support for dbd been added to ps4? 
---
How does it work when the match starts with less than 4 people? The same way? 
---
It would be a good challenge of drinking game to keep pressing button to switch killers and go the killer it ends on
---
 
---
I'm on PC... is it just the Nurses ability to dash super far super quick 24-7?? Also how does her dash work I see some people do short dashes and others do long dashes how do you choose how far you dash too and where u dash to?
---
You can probably still submit a support ticket for this if you haven't tried yet. They've been pretty good to me about situations like this. Granted I always noticed right away so YMMV.
---
Or they could just continue to leave characters sexuality out of it because it has nothing to do with the game lol. 
---
You'll see this if you just loop the killer shack. It'll get way harder, yes, they wont be too hard.
---
Interesting but is going to be extremely rare.
---
why is this nsfw?
---
good drawing, can you draw others too
---
I'd like to see the huntress
---
Because. I. Check. Good thing I don't have to explain myself, but if I die I like to check before going to the next match. "You don't have to know" is an excuse for morons. So let's hide survivor loadouts as well, as killer you cant check anyway mid match, why see it afterwards amirite?
---
Talking to another Cote.
---
p.99372711
---
IMO it's not worth getting these perks since they're easily attainable on free characters. If you have a shitton of shards go for it but I'd personally save mine for perks from characters I don't own. WGLF is great if you don't wanna level David, but it's pretty worth doing so for WGLF and Dead Hard.
---
Oh shit it's the same as PC now.
---
But that face is ugly, and it would produce such a cute ONK
---
DBD is no way near as toxic as games like LoL dota 2 and csgo.
---
DBD is just like a toddler when compared to those 3
---
Next, increase the time for finishing the gen
---
If I kill everyone else and the last person was someone I saw rarely the whole game or was a good player, I'll let them go if they don't wiggle.
---
If they resist at all, I kill 'em.
---
Try to spread hits more often, rather than tunelling the same person and hooking him 3 times in a row to kill him
---
nice despite what the comments are saying about you camping 
---
Yep. This happened to me too. I definitely had space and cleared it and the sound effect happened but nope. I was back in the house again.
---
Thanks
---
I see you're a man of culture
---
*Holds hand out* you will walk into my chainsaw
---
Yes. On top of that, only one person needs prove thyself and it buffs everyone on the generator. (doesn't stack with multiple prove thyself though, same with leader now)
---
...AND it boosts your objective bloodpoints. Ran it last night and had max objective every single game and got about 50k each game. (Idk if it was solely because of prove thyself though)
---
So now the question is.. why WOULDN'T you use it? Incoming genrush meta. It's good with bond because you can choose which gen you should work on to speed time.
---
Be hard to balance killers. Michael Myers can't die to bullets, Amanda Young dies to one...
---
Thanks as well this would be my first offence so warning only or what?
---
My money's on the 30th.
---
I know, but that's not a good thing. Gens are ALREADY fast. They need to add more objectives honestly, maybe you could open doors and stuff I dunno dude but the current speed is getting out of hand.
---
Ruin is a MUST now but even with ruin I've been forcing through gens with prove thyself purposely not getting great skillchecks.
---
Well, I didn't knew that, but it was something to be expected =)
---
I've had 4-5 warnings but I don't message anymore unless I'm giving advice. 
---
It will be for either harassment or language depending on what you said to him
---
Nurse is the strongest because she can blink through walls/windows/pallets and can travel around the map pretty fast. Long blinks are good for closing distance, short blinks are good for juking survivors and landing hits. Her blink distance depends on how long she holds her power for. Knowing where to blink to takes two things, experience playing her and predicting survivor's movements. There's a lot of information that goes into Nurse, she has the highest skill cap of all killers. I'd suggest starting off with a different killer.
---
If you where swearing and he reports it, you could get a com ban for a few days. 
---
*RELATED HAG PSA*: don’t trap gens/totems more than once in a trial (to make them think you will *always trap gens*) it’s a waste of time and traps bs survivors who just crouch and do the gen under your nose.
---
For totems trap a loop nearby, also even tho it’s mostly well known now but only use one trap under hook, it’s pointless to use more.
---
Do you mean that toolboxes should open exit gates or that once upon a time they could open gates?
---
That's true, but just pointing out that it can actually go even faster than OP stated
---
Wait what ? Wait ? You can switch killers by hitting the triggers ? 
---
You mean feature.
---
Ok first off, hillbilly is braindead easy. Even his in game description says so. Secondly, huntress is on of the harder killers to master. Hag also
---
not pictured: me getting face-camped
---
the entity has given you the ability to fly
---
yes, legion is that bad
---
It didn’t need the bass boost to be funny
---
Well thats the sacrifice a game like thing has to have. You either limit the games feature to account for swf having an advantage over solos. Or dont have/remove swf so you can balance just for solo.
---
Makes me sad there are some killer powers and perks we'll never have because swf communication just makes them obsolete.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-wAuckEGQk
---
having edited it all together it was actually way less funny when the music wasn't there
---
same here. dafuq. i thought my sound setting was screwed up. checked everything and was confused, because everything was fine. dbd even was at lower volume than normal. 
---
Thank all you swf groups and toxic survivors the killers are leaving. 
---
OwO
---
Yesterday we had so many loading screen crashes. The most we ever had xD
---
This has literally nothing to do with the post at hand and you are also wrong in many ways.
---
This is creepy. They should leave it like that :D
---
I’m surprised to see the doctor isn’t mentioned in here. He is a pain in the ass to play against especially when he’s stacked with certain perks. Makes the game go on for so long. Was satisfying playing with him for the first time and 4k’ing. He just seems unstoppable with certain addon combos. 
---
The whole argument that ensued from this is so funny considering the guy posted this at some point: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9b5n4r/dont_you_even_think_about_it_devs/e51nxy3/
---
I guess a lot can change in a couple months!
---
Really, when I hear survivors do this, I go out of my way to go as far away from those notifications as possible. No need to be a bragging asshole just because you managed to do 2 gens.
---
This happened to me on haddonfield. The new vault momentum mechanic is bugged as fuck
---
maybe its a hint. next killer will be a screamer... hmm. scream killer confirmed? 
---
I think she did dc.  Had this happen in a match tonight when they dc’d because I grabbed them from a gen.  Showed them as alive even though I saw them disappear and the hatch still opened when only one real person was left.  
---
Worst part was it froze me in the grab animation until someone came along and flashlight blinded me.
---
Maybe a bug with the new update?
---
The game just wanted you to die. 
---
Im happy I haven’t ran into one of these yet. One of these days I’m not gonna know what hit me.
---
I hate playing against freddy... hes not good hes just annoying
---
So funny right xd I’ve never seen this meme before xd
---
It was part of the update ? 
---
It even happened before the last patch. I was the last alive since the before last was in his death on hook animation and I knew where the hatch was. I went there and waited for it to open. It didn't.
---
Also had it happen on the swamp, months ago. The hatch spawned on the bottom floor of that little house amd I knew that. But it took me waiting around it for a full minute before it actually opened despite everybody already being dead by the time I got there.
---
I mean, even if you can't all you need to do is grab Freddy while someone else is waking you up and then its a burn victim up against a couple of angry pallet loving idiots with firearms.
---
I had 2 people report me for “wallhacks” with Legion (that tracking ability that happens after you stab someone)
---
After trying to explain to them what the Legions power did (after they already reported me) one of them asked me “can you please just never play Legion again?”
---
I’ve been funneling points into Legion for a few days now. I love him.
---
This happened to me on ps4 about 4 times tonight it messes me up cause I think they are still alive then the hatch opens 😭
---
they escaped... and winning is fun.. right? right?!
---
Two gens.*
---
She Dc'd. There is currently a bug where it doesn't show the dc icon. It shows the healthy icon instead. I saw it in the patch notes yesterday
---
It happened half an hour ago. Indeed I did get stuck in the animation but the survivors told me they would see her on the HUD alive. Maybe she did DC actually but nobody knew. Dead by buglight
---
Was that the heavy ass main menu theme?  I agree
---
It doesn't stack.
---
Yeah, I know about the failing a skill check. I'm rank 14 at the moment, highest I've ever got is 10. I don't mean Freddy's the worst, I enjoy the Freddy games and I enjoy playing as Freddy, I just think he's the hardest to survive against because of his invisible thing 
---
thanks
---
How long would it take to get enough iridescent shards to unlock all the killers and survivors that can be bought with them?
---
Dude i'm having the same problem since the new patch and i'm currently redownloading the game to see if this will be fixed or no !
---
Agreed. I love playing against Myers, I'm extremely nervous all game, keeping an eye on every angle while doing gens and when I see him stalking in T1 I just nope the fuck out. It's everything I wanted from a "horror" game.
---
hah's in _latrice._
---
Just bought the game today and loving it. I still do not understand totems though? Any explanation? Also is there anyway to unlock new characters other than just buying them?
---
Hahah, that Freddy is so awful he's just tunneling the obsession...

---
I was 100% under the assumption that I still had a survivor running around somewhere that I couldnt find until the game just ended when the dwight died because it showed me a survivor who DC'd as alive...
---
&gt; but because drag queens will straight-up cut you at the drop of a wig.
---
that sounds like a killer concept. brb in three months.
---
I was confused there for a second.
---
If you read the patch notes, down at the bottom under "known issues" it states that sometimes surv that disconnected are still shown as alive.
---
They are aware of this issue and trying to fix it 
---
Hex: My Day has been Ruined
---
IMO keys just shouldent show up in chests, purple/red are actual BS, it’s like an ultra Kobe for the last 3 survivors, and no one likes to see a green key.
---
Keys should be web only and you have bring them in yourself
---
&gt; remeniss 
---
LOL
---
Primarily user it for totems and hatch. I also use the addon so other survivors can see it. 
---
Every pallet is safe on game and the devs made it a *minimum* of 14 can spawn, it’s survivor sided now unless your a hag/nurse/doc
---
Hey, you could've been my escapee!  I'm on ps4! XD 
---
My first time using Pig yesterday so wasn't sure what was going off.  I read on her thing after that the timer starts when a gen is powered, wonder if it's anything to do with that?  Does that mean the first gen? Or the first one after the trap is put on?  Can survivors escape when the timer isn't ticking?
---
Totems and hatch are the main reasons why I like using them. 
---
Trust me, in a few days on rank 13+ you’ll return to survivor.
---
You say that, but playing Legion 🤔. Myers is like a community favorite. 
---
Ahhh thanks! This helps out a ton :)
---
"You never saw it COMING!"
---
There are two people and three gens. Once one dies, you still need 2 more to complete. 1:1.
---
Ppl who dodge need to try getting good I personally like the challenge of a well coordinated group makes me get better at the game
---
Boi it’s a rainbow map. It literally lets you see ANYTHING.
---
Are you okay. 
---
4 generators were completed, and this survivor was the last one standing.  I was hovering by the hatch initially to try and get them when they went for the hatch, but then they took off to the far side of the map to try and complete a generator.  I was stuck in this limbo state where if I actively tried to find them, they’d get the hatch because I was too far away,  but no real way to locate them aside from whispers telling me generally where they were.
---
Definitely Nurse or Spirit in the right hands
---
Lmao hell no
---
did they show more than the snowy map? because if not: snow is white and scream killers mask is white!1
---
Survivors buy more cosmetics, they make the devs more money so they try to keep survivors happier 
---
Im rank one and theres a huge gap between players. There is the tunnel Legion which in my eyes is the easiest killer in the game. Then there is people that says they have to camp in order to win. Last but not least rareity of people leaving the hook so you can unhook 
---
Thanks I hate it
---
&gt; i'm currently redownloading the game to see if this will be fixed or no !
---
It obviously won't. Unfortunately you're gonna have to wait for the devs to patch it.
---
I don´t have a problem with queue time if I am playing alone. Have a game in like 20 sec. But yesterday it took 38 minutes for me and my friend to find a lobby, only to load in 3v1 game. 
---
People were saying to me maybe it will start this Thursday or next Tuesday.
---
Should have gotten the sliph scope first
---
Flying thunder lizard lmao

[Here's the image.](https://imgur.com/DR6UdUK.jpg) I found it on the Zedge app, which also has some DbD related ringtones, like a remix of bing bong and another with Billy's chainsaw.
---
Ffs urban evasion was on shrine like two weeks ago and now again, it’s so annoying 
---
Coming from you lmfao. You're an entitled killer main who has barely played survivor and probably uses noed yourself.
---
Totem spawns are getting more and more hidden, there's no totem count so you can't know if your teammates have done them too, if the killer downs someone, someone gets chased and someone goes for the save while you're doing fucking totems you are being a shit teammate and wasting time.
---
Last comment from me: go play survivor and stop acting like you know exactly what happens as a survivor. 
---
I don’t believe it’s really much better because I’ve looted quite a bit now and I pretty much have only gotten brown or yellow items or a green key. Idk about anyone else but to me looting a green key is like the game spitting in your face. I had way better luck before the update. That’s just been my experience so far though so who knows.
---
Thanks for making my point for me 
---
Great buffs? No. They made things that were useless not useless anymore by technically buffing them. But you make it seem like they took something that was good and made it better.
---
looping and t-bagging is not outplay, it's called being a toxic asswhole, hiding after vaulting and then slowly walk away in the opposite direction is outplay
---
I bet coming back to the hook counts as camping in your book aswell
---
Shape is cool, splinters are not
---
Why are you using hashtags on Reddit? 
---
*Readys leaterface and trapper builds*
---
Myers is great. ANY splinter is not.
---
Sorry don’t use reddit much :) 
---
How was the hatch trophy? For me it was a bitch and a half. Congratulations though! 
---
No, but what is annoying about him is if he wants you dead, he'll use his frenzy only on you, cheese the chase and down you real quick. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Hooked survivors will see me crouch up to the hook, yet always run after. 
---
Hard agree. I'm too bad at the game to casually enjoy a no-perks challenge (half joking, but I honestly don't see the appeal) and my only remaining splinters are Freddy so I definitely don't want to make it even harder on myself now that I own him.
---
What are we even supposed to do with them after we buy the matching killer? Let me trade them in at a highly discounted rate or at least delete them once we own the matching killer. I know it'll never happen but a guy can dream.
---
Interesting. I looked through your comments, and I agree with literally everything you've said about the game. Except this comment. This game is all about the chases to me; that's where the skill is derived from and that's where the fun comes from. Typically the people who want to stay hidden are the ones who are bad at chases and aren't team players. 
---
I bet you wrong
---
itt was a bug that made it so it looked like they were on my shoulder but just floated around
---
***R E V   U P   T H O S E   F R Y E R S***
---
Autoheal and automend give survival pts
---
i gotcha and ty i appreciate
---
Survival points are rewarded for snapping out of it, escaping bear traps, and self caring.
---
This is legit, the last swing of bubbas chainsaw is not a attack
---
I really wish they'd let you "refund" certain offerings that are no longer eligible like killer splinters or event stuff.  
---
Nurse is not levitating 0/10 just kidding great cosplay :)
---
Ah okay I'll leave this for others who want to find out. Thanks fellas
---
Its very difficult but healing yourself, freeing yourself from a hook, bear trap or reverse Bear trap and waking up or snapping out of it also give you points for this.
---
i like how you think you have the moral highground by calling him a kid, like that changes anything, only kids call other people kids when they dont get something their way
---
This is why I always dodge lobbies that have Russian players. They are some of the shittest people I know.
---
send this to the king
---
Can't wait to get home and use a Haddonfield offering to see what the fuss is about
---
He's ridiculously add on reliant and even with his best add ons he's only about myers or clown tier 
---
Whats up?
---
or you could.. read about the perks? watch some youtube vids too?
---
Cool Nurse and Bill.  
---
Billys a lot easier to play then huntress and hag 
---
Not sure how long but I think it's probably about 4 seconds. Whatever it is, it seems like and eternity and if he is coming out of stealth it may not stun him in time. You have to catch him coming up to you or off guard.
---
i mean, its your problem if you dont want to read shit about the game youre playing, dont blame us later if you didnt know something we did because we read about it lol
---
bill cosby
---
IMFUCJING SHAKING nd criynf hbHhfwhoscoadhohhi 
---
so use the wiki.. *drumroll* on your pc?
---
I'm confused. Where's the locker this Dwight should be in?
---
What did 2.5 change about Haddonfield? Are you referring to dealing with the mid vault+balance landing loop on houses?
---
SHUT UP U HAVE 300 HRS THATS NOTHING LOL
---
Had that happen to me too. What even triggers this?
---
No, we console players LIVE IN A LIE
---
Idk I found the meme once and decided to do that 
---
Use wake up or vigil, forgot which does which.
---
Understandable. Have a wonderful day.
---
Hag has a high knowledge cap.  Knowing your map layouts well and the psychology of survivors will make you seem fairly beast as her.  One of the few "mindfuck" killers. 
---
Never stop playing stop playing legion, no matter what those toxic survivors say, never give up. FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS MAN
---
Big problem is a gross overexageration. And they already stated it would be nice to let solos see what the killer has, but they don't have the means to do that in the current system.
---
Now I like my killers scary but I'll make this an exception because that's pretty cute. Great work.
---
&gt; That's what makes it tricky. If you add a minority Killer, people are going to ask why you're presenting them as psychotic murderers. If you add a minority Survivor, people are going to ask why you're subjecting them to an eternity of torture. There's no winning here.
---
The people who would say that are a pretty small minority. The issue with the "cross-dressing killer" archetype isn't that the killer is a minority, it's that it almost always carries the implication that their minority status is somehow linked to being a murderer.
---
What the duck?
---
I have see so many Hex killers I have to run Small Games. I feel really good when the killer is Trapper. 
---
i want this as a poster...
---
&gt;  I am bitching over a change nobody really asked for.
---
"I am bitching over a change SURVIVOR MAINS never asked for."
---
Oh that was 2.5? We all got earraped in Puppers stream. I thought it was a bug.
---
Right, thank you kind stranger!
---
Yes it was 2.5

---
The smart move is to try and grab a side of the generator that gives you a good vantage. Make sure you've got a chance to see her before she reaches you, and always be looking around. A bad pig will sometimes be crouching in full view. No heartbeat, but she's still there walking about in the open. Or taking a concealed route that gives you a little glimpse.
---
If he doesnt camp tunneling is a valif strategy. Except the survivor got fully healed and is pn second hook. Then it doesnt matter which you chase. But its completely normal to follow the injured , except with make your choice. :)  oh btw I'm a Survivor Main ^^
---
Because dedicated servers are not out yet. I really hope they fix that with dedicated servers.. currently this happens because with swf your host is given over to the killer, from who you lose connection after the match, thus dropping from swf.
---
Players hate them more than they are strong. They're new and flashy.
---
the game, nothing, with your argument with him? a lot
---
Blood warden is a joke anyway, you can easily play around it even if you don't know if the killer has it or not.
---
the game is not about cooperation tho, it was marketed as antisocial multiplayer game initially, but people demanded a way to play with friends, which later caused the problems with comms 
---
Someone unhooked him and then he somehow hooked himself again, but he didn't lose his health at all, so I had to leave.
---
Yeah I realized that earlier. Kind of weird though, since the percentages should cancel out exactly right? -10% for 2 survivors on 1 gen, +10% for 2 survivors on 1 gen with prove thyself. Not sure why I'm getting reduced speed based on those numbers?
---
Can't preach this enough 
---
Go away
---
The entire point of the change is to prevent SWF from telling each other about the killers perks. This isn’t the case for solo players so there is literally no point in us having to be punished for something that swf players do. I like seeing what builds killers have when I’m alone and it’s bullshit that I have to wait and see everyone die just to confirm that they had noed. 
---
You definitely should avoid the runners in SWF squads. I've chewed through a fair few SWF teams, and the guy that follows you around the map clicking his flashlight and sprinting away will always be a waste of time to chase. You have to target the gen jockeys, the guys who suck at running.
---
If all of them are incredible runners, then just tank through it and go to the next game.
---
Nananananananana LAG SWITCH
---
It's really difficult especially for killers not named Nurse Billy or Spirit. Even then Ruin is pretty crucial lol. I finally broke down and bought Hag a while back basically just for ruin, but she's actually really fun too so I feel pretty good about the purchase
---
Because survivors are already OP and if everyone brings a toolbox that's just toxic.
---
If you own the killer and use the splinter for them, you’ll load in with the perks you have on that killer. I did this a little while ago with Freddy since I wanted to get rid of a splinter I had for him on another killer; I know for a fact that his perks were active because I had Ruin. Means you can at least use up the splinters instead of them sitting around.
---
Discordance is so got damn good. I’m using that shit on most builds. 
---
The beauty of going against The Nurse... You either have a player like that or you have a player that can down both of you and string you up in seconds with a couple short blinks
---
From what I understand, doing the same gen together is now slower compared to before. So, no.
---
It has nothing to do with anything. Be gone ✌
---
There are two perks which use stacks. We're gonna live forever (survivor) and BBQ and Chili (killer). You get one stack for specific actions up to a maximum of four and for each stack you get bonus bloodpoints.
---
It doesn't change anything, as they nerfed the repair speed of multiple people on 1 gen. For every extra survivor working on a gen, it goes 10% slower than before the patch. The only thing PT does is negate that nerf.
---
I don't care, to be honest. People on this subreddit like to be immersed, so shitting on UE gets you downvotes despite it being a bad perk. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I double tap crouch trying to indicate that I want to heal you. Cause sometimes survivors just run for miles before stopping to let themselves heal and that's annoying when the killer wasn't anywhere near and in a chase.
---
compared to killer it's still horrible. I swear I consistently would get 50k BP a killer match even if I did shit and yet you don't have to sacrifice good perks for just more points since BBQ is a good perk and you don't risk having a bad game for points since in reality you usually can get more BP in a below average game then you do on a good game of survivor.
---
https://youtu.be/LJ5nV9aKthU
---
I got ruin a few weeks ago on the store but haven't managed to unlock it on Myers yet
---
Haha, no worries. I sincerely apologize but I'm still laughing at the mental image of you walking around and having nowhere near enough time to get the trap off, I'd think she was OP too.
---
Unfortunately she can still be quite annoying if she chooses to tunnel you and chase you off traps forever (while looking away to break chase and keep your timer going), but these are the same type of people who'd probably facecamp a hook anyway. She's one of the more manageable killers to deal with once you learn how to play against her.
---
cool cosplay
---
K, Mister 1k Hour Pro 😂
---
In the current season, that's true. There's been other trans contestants in other seasons (Peppermint, Sonique, Monica Beverly Hills, Carmen Carrera), and countless others that are genderfluid/non binary (including Valentina this season).
---
He was patrolling 1 meter around the hook. Gotta  protect the meat from flies.
---
I will say I've been running Plunder's Instinct since a few weeks back, it's honestly a bit of a yikes that this change happened. I feel I'd get more purple items then anything and even got a rainbow map one time in the few matches I've played since running Plunder's Instinct.
---
If this change stacks with Plunder's Instinct and I'm going to be getting purples even MORE often then I already did, I sort of expect to be getting a purple key once every few matches at most. I mean there's what, 5 purple items? Key, flashlight, medkit and 2 toolboxes. I already go most games getting at least 1 while most I feel I'd get 2. Assuming it's a 20% chance for any of the purple items when it's a purple item I'd assume it's a fairly decent chance at a usable key.
---
You could even meme it up and throw I think it's Ace In The Hole for chances of add-ons since you'll be getting a LOT of green items as well meaning a lot of broken keys, you might get lucky and make it usable.
---
The red one so terrify
---
XD perfect!
---
Do you mean AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
Edgy
---
Havent seen it on the last few ive checke and have been specifically looking for it and adrenalin. And dont you get more points from a perfect game. And even if you get more points from a hatch escape its still frustraiting doing so well to watch someone get up and leave.
---
I need more, these are amazing
---
Why does this have so many upvotes? The video was 1 minute long and they both seem to be low ranked
---
It’s ridiculous how easy it is to change on accident? Like you just barely have to touch the triggers for it to switch characters.. I like having something to switch quickly, but I would definitely agree that the buttons need to be switch to L1 and R1 or something
---
He’s trying to get you killed with that immediate save?
---
I was MORE discouraged by the fact I started the weekend before rank reset and got festooned with more experienced players and was unable to learn because games were so fucking fast when you have only one perk, than I ever was not seeing killers perks. Perks are all written to sound awesome when not all are. Atop this when I'm starting out I KNOW MY KNOWLEDGE HAS GAPS. I focus on learning basics rather than learning perks because I won't always have access to the perks.
---
Do it right after rank reset while you’re still at a lower rank than usual maybe?
---
Hes like yo come up here there's a hex totem up here
---
I've taken a break of 1,5 years too, and actually think it got better... by a bit. Some awful people are still in there, but it feels less. That's for rank 10-17 or so, heard it's worse higher up.
---
And it's still better than Twilight
---
You're daft if you think high ranked survival play actually works that way. You keep talking about how horrible this is and being negative Nancy, when it isn't the end of the world. Get over yourself.
---
It was supposed to be in the game but it wasn't. They even mentioned in the patch notes that now they added it in
---
But If u do it with bnp isn't every skill check a great skill check?
---
It's just a universal joke. New players usually have trouble hitting great skill checks, and decisive is only the great part of a skill check. 
---
How do you derank as killer?
---
And why is it almost 10 seconds 
---
Bnp =25% = 5seconds
---
*4 survivor =100%= 5 seconds 
---
Also kobes
---
*it's cool n all but it's not british enough till he calls someone wanker

any chance someone who knew you were having a bad time recommended this game to you?
---
if that's the case you may want to reconsider their intentions
---
Pretty much it is a worse leader, it makes nothing faster but gens, and gives more blood points. But it doesn’t show it being used
---
It was but it wasn't actually 10% at all times.
---
"Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate."
---
He seems to obliterate swf even without using his meta shit, they just have no idea what to do when they kind all stick together the whole match.
---
A couple of days ago I was doing this achiev and then when I downed the last survivor, all of them dc'd lel, I didnt get it :/
---
It’s a visual glitch with only one person. The speed bonus is still there!
---
nvm, i think its confirmed to be bugged and ill remove the post cuz if u do a gen in 2 it doesnt activate, but if the second survivor stands near u and doesnt do the gen, then it activates... makes no sense if its meant to be that way
---
Swf group: im gonna stop you right there.

They are running [Resilience](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Resilience), [Prove Thyself](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove_Thyself), [Spine Chill](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill) and [Stake Out](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Stake_Out)
---
Dude i create my memes on paint, don't even worry about photoshop
---
This man watched so much ochido his brain fucking melted 
---
For me they're always near each other, trying to gen rush and go for the flash light saves I'm guessing, so they end up getting nothing done since I keep hitting them with deep wounds. This is only at rank 10 though since I only just started playing again after a few months break.
---
1k aint that much either
---
I’m curious as to what perks you do use cause almost every perk has some form of counterplay and a good survivor would know how to work around most things. 
---
Also the perk is awesome for maintaining a 3 gen. 
---
All good m8 love you
---
Did they fixed random disconnects with "No connection error" ?
---
Sometimes I played 2,3 matches without error.
---
Other I got DC on the first match of the day.
---
The music is like 2 or 3 times louder when you load in for some unknown reason. Just about shat myself playing it last night haha
---
Leader only shows up as a buff if you perform an action that is affected by leader (healing, sabotaging, cleansing, etc.). Since the last patch it doesn’t increase generator repair sperd anymore so that‘s why it didn‘t show up.
---
It‘s a bit weird I agree because I‘d also like to know if someone runs leader without having to perform an action next to him.
---
We can play out a lot of different scenarios but in reality knowing perks won't change much. Let's say their friends do open the gates instead of 99 them when one of their friends is being chased. What does that change? If it's truly an swf then the group will usually open the gates and body block for their friend all the way out the gate. Wow, that changed a lot. Or you down their friend before they get there and hook him. Now blood warden is activated, but does it matter? No because theory friends are already surrounding the hook hidden waiting to unhook. One of them is bound to be slacking behind or will check exit gates unseen. Oh look blood warden, so let's wait it out.
---
Also I have cleared all five totems and the wraith surprisingly didn't have noed numerous times. Was it a waste of time? I don't think so. I play the game for blood points and I see totems mostly has money trees, getting rid of noed is just icing on the cake. Numerous SWFs have posted on here and steamers who SWF very obviously do not play to escape but to purely have fun. These alpha bravo SWF squads really are rare.
---
Again, proof is in the pudding though. I just think its funny how killer mains are celebrating this change like it has been holding them back from 4king every game. Its absolutely hilarious and quite sad at the same time. I can almost guarantee you won't see much change from this except an annoyance to solo players who simply want to know what perks and addons the killer was using before going to their next match. How did that Wraith always know where I was!? Oh he had all seeing add-on, instead you'll never know because I won't be wasting my time waiting for a match to end to find out.
---
“Lower yourself, Freddy, I cant reach the generator!”
---
Resilience gives that sweet buff to vaulting though... \*thinking emoji\*
---
That's really good to know! Kinda wish that was in the patch notes... 
---
True. They are really inconsistent sometimes which makes tracking way harder than it used to be, especially for spirits.
---
love it when i get DAs on my team 24/7 and then playing against ppl that treat it like a job
---
K K 
---
I understand where you’re coming from but I feel that it’s just the fact that nurse can completely nullify all pallets, walls and chases by teleporting and that’s the same with billy (minus the walls part) except he can go around the map and absolutely destroy people.
---
That’s just my opinion no hate man have your own opinion and own it :)
---
10 sec is the record
---
excellent picture thanks for making this subreddit better.
---
The fact that it happens multiple times means it’s a issue that needs to be seen by the devs. It may be a exaggeration or it could be you have a stick up you’re butt.
---
Is it still like this? I’ve been avoiding Freddy recently cause I was hoping they would have fixed this by now. 
---
I think adepts got fixed so now you get them if you escape via hatch too, if i remember correctly you only could get it if you escaped via the gate before
---
inb4 People telling you, everything under 2k hours is just the beginning.
---
I can see where your coming from.
---
You seem to be much more used to your Main Killers and seem to not really get a good feeling on playing Nure, Hillbilly and Huntress.
---
But those Killers have advantages over most other Killers, if  played ja someone who is used to them 
---
Well it’s Laurie’s map and she’s played by the scream queen so Old Lady Laurie and Old Man Myers cosmetics confirmed /s
---
Oh god she's listening to the hadonfield opener on airports oh god oh fuck
---
I guess it's not bad for 3 gen, I don't use that strat myself. Othet than that, Discordance isn't bad because people play around it, it's bad because good survivors work on gens solo because that's harder to contest. By the way have you tried the new Surveillance, does that work for 3 gen? 
---
I use bbq, ruin and everything else is kinda whatever, though brutal strength is nice too. On some killers I use sloppy, on some killers like clown I combine enduring and spirit fury.. to be honest there are not many killer perks that are good, except NOED but that one is just cheese.
---
A very long time that only a grinding madman would really want to deal with. 
---
I don’t see the issue with this, this sounds amazing. Can we make Myers breathing ear rape please 
---
I know that reddit is dumb in general but this is the worst thing ive seen in here in a while.
---
You really don't need NOED on spirit. You also didn't need to camp with noed. You could have just downed dwight when you saw him at the hook instead of instead of hard camping claudette when she only had afew seconds on the hook left.
---
It got much louder
---
Shitpost? 
---
For survivor I'd probably say decisive, self care, well make it, sprint burts/balanced landing
---
And killer  I'd say BBQ, whispers, enduring, spirit fury/nurses
---
Woah the wraith is amazing 
---
u/Freedy_Kringle im being bullie dplease
---
If an idiot survivor just unhooks someone right in front of the killer. Why should the guy who got unhooked be punished? But it also doesn't apply that much pressure. Say the survivor that gets unhooked has self-care. They will probably go heal in the corner of the map and won't do a gen. If they don't have self-care then they will probably have another survivor heal them. So that's two people not doing a gen, plus the person you are currently chasing. I'm not hating, just sharing how I usually see it as the killer.
---
43 ping to server is a bit high tbh but it's probably you're playing with survivors outside of your region
---
Doing gens, you?
---
god damnit i havent slept in 24 hrs and im laughed more than i should have. 
---
anyways, what was your loadout?
---
Obvi not cause it was one gen and we ran Myers for 10 minutes on 1 gen left
---
Yes but sacrificing them permanently takes them out of the equation 
---
So you propose that solo players are punished?
---
I would also like to add that Bill's perks have been "unlocked" for all other characters and can show up in the bloodweb at any time.
---
Oh fair enough, I kinda consider them the same thing so I could see how it’s taken either way.
---
You know im right :D
---
Where are you getting your data?
---
The 50% escape rate statistic I've seen referenced was for escape rate at rank 1 with SWF already factored into the data. That would imply a higher rate of escapes then solo queue.
---
SC is highly overrated, I’ve stopped running it
---
Very good
---
very logical response thats reasonable thank you very much
---
Just take a weekend and practice nurse. She really isn't that hard, takes some practice sure, but once you get the hang of her it's really easy to stomp with her. I mean she literally ignores the core defensive mechanics for survivors..
---
As for hillbilly... Just watch some stream in twitch like ZubatLEL for example. Learn curving around corners and you can chainsaw surv even in loops unlike leatherface who just gets reduced to a m1 killer if surv know what they're doing.. 
---
The ping changes every time I do the speed test, but is always in the 30-45 range, usually closer to 30
---
But yeah, it might be people from other regions, as I don't usually play at standard times (middle of the day rather than evening or night)
---
Bop
---
Can't deny feeling pretty slick afterwards, tho.
---
they insulted them
---
idk thats why I asked tbh
---
These drag race crossovers are giving me absolutely everything I needed and more 
---
Can't tell if this is bait or serious.
---
true
---
Well this kind of backs up why I think tier list are pretty much pointless and every person think different of each killer.  Just play the killers you enjoy and have fun with the game. 
---
Yo real talk that episode was messed up
---
Watch their ping in pre-game lobby. If it's red, game will probably be not very fun for both sides. If it's yellow, but numbers are all over the place (say, one second it's 105, next second it's 185), this survivor will almost always have teleport perk.
---
Also, lag switching is a such an easy accusation to throw, that some survivors will say that almost automatically. Any random lag - killer must be lag switching...
---
the vOiD
---
Thanks :)
---
I had just bought her with shards like 2 weeks before the lighting changes, and was super bummed because she became unplayable for me, glad to see it's better now :)
---
But I'm such a pro gamer I held down M1 and hit spacebar three times, see me teabag so hard I break my ctrl key.
---
Nerf legion btw
---
When going for the save, if I see another person around, I usually run in, set off all the traps and take her aggro so the savior and the saved can run off once he's unhooked.
---
The 'trans' prefix more often refers to transsexuals, but can also mean transvestites, and thus drag queens.

I just hope for not Legion.
---
Oh yeah true. I was also confused when a friend said he’s using Leader and I didn’t see it. I hope they change it back.
---
What did stick did you have up your ass today?
---
Footsteps and the rustling of Grass/Plants/Bushes are by far much louder than before.
---
I played Spirit for a while and was actually able to reliably track people based on Scratchmarks/Footstep noises
---
Piggy, the Spirit, and honestly I can never win against Freddy 
---
You’re welcome!
---
Especially the sound changes really hurt her because you weren’t able to hear footsteps but now it’s fixed! :)
---
420 upvotes, nice.
---
All 4 survivors escape? Survivors tell me to kill myself.
---
Gens done in 4 minutes so I camp one person? Survivors tell me to kill myself.
---
Get a 4k, regardless of what I do? Survivors tell me to kill myself.
---
I just minimize the chatbox permanently now. I've downloaded MLGA to see how many survivors stay in the game afterwards and guess how many are telling me to slit my wrists or hang myself.
---
yeah crouching never triggers her traps but it obviously makes it a lot harder to hide when she comes lol
---
His ultra rare add-on has the obsession start the match in the basement hooked
---
Yeah you could do that, or just take his shirt off
---
its not THAT bad
---
each patch I check into the game hoping the framerate will get better on ps4 because "OpTiMiZaTiOn PaSsEs" but i feel like it gets WORSE with each patch. I played one spirit game on coldwind farm last night and it might as well have been a power point presentation.
---
Wtf did I just read
---
r/wooosh
---
\&gt;350 hours
---
there's your answer
---
Just no
---
It's all telligible and the grammar is fine. Do you have an issue with the content?
---
43 isn't high by any standard. Thats about average speed to a optimal node around here, no one I can think of would pass that up.
---
Playing outside your region is anywhere from 170-300+
---
Yeah no shit. Thats why im asking the question you just replied to. My original understanding was that this was a pre match picture
---
is english your first language? no offense but that's kind of nonsense by itself.
---
Yes this is true but I would use bbq even if it only would give extra BP and wouldn't read auras. Ruin is better than discordance because even if survivors know to not waste time on finding the hex it still slows them down somewhat. I just don't like the fact that survivors have to misplay for discordance even to be good, but I can see it working for 3 gen strat you are right.
---
Does Gesturing still prevent AFK Crows? I read they patched that out
---
Gen times need to be made longer somehow. If the devs wanted games to be 10-15 minutes, they are nowhere near that long right now. My shortest game this week was about 3 minutes and 15 seconds.
---
Several other games have just been shy of 4 minutes. When you feel like you **have** to play nurse or billy, there's a problem with the game.
---
They said it’s the oldest one by a large margin, so it’s not similar to anyone. 
---
Hag was 15 when she was taken by the entity.
---
The devs meant timeline wise they would be the oldest. Afaik Huntress is the oldest and is from 1850
---
The perk literally makes it so you have the same repair speed as you had prior to this patch with a teammate.
---
The previous gen repair speed didn't need a nerf, there is no reason to nerf it now either. 
---
Like camping it comes down to context. Sometimes its necesarry sometimes your just being a dick
---
Not the oldest age wise but oldest timeline wise. As clarification, I believe the huntress is the oldest since she was WW1 era
---
wasnt that idea not even implemented in this patch? they only talked about it, didnt see it in the patch notes
---
[There's blood in the box!](https://youtu.be/fa7TcdabUiE?t=60)
---
He knows he can’t win. Why not help the survivors 
---
I hate not having UE against hag. It’s a drag having to crouch everywhere without it.
---
I've been solo queuing all morning so far an it takes me about 15 to 20 seconds to get into a lobby with 3 people waiting for the 4th. Sometimes we load in all at the same time and the lobby dodging noob assumes were swf. Either way ive had good luck so far.
---
So the Harry Warden leak was fake then? because he was an 80's killer not the early 1900's
---
I Do Not Like The Way You Type Every Word With A Capital Letter It Makes It Very Hard To Read
---
No it’s not. You don’t have to break every pallet you see dropped because not all loops with a pallet are safe. It’s often a waste of time to collect the tokens especially if you don’t plan on getting one slammed on your head
---
It's literally the same speed we've had prior to this patch. The previous gen repair speed didn't need a nerf, neither does this one.
---
survivor players are physically unable to leave their computer when playing against him, the pain they feel in game they feel irl
---
Better bandit you mean?
---
Nurse is like a different game so fair enough. She has the potential to be the best though eben if you syruggle with her
---
Billy i really dont get though, even if you just use his m1 and the chainsaw to travel hes better than most killers
---
Waaah I want to play 4 man SWF with toolboxes and hadnofun/coldwind offering, why do killers get to cherry pick lobbies instead of being fucking miserable.
---
No clue, honestly. On the stream they said they would be the oldest killer *by far* so they have to be significantly older than 1850.
---
Harry is probably fake unless the devs misinformed us 
---
It doesn't give it anymore, even tho it states it in the description.
---
Maybe just make Totems spawn in after 45 seconds or so, give killers at least a little bit of time with their Totem. I don't mind Ruin or whatever getting destroyed, I don't even mind shitty spawn points. i just mind  it when my Totem gets blown up  before I even have a chance to look around and get my bearings. 
---
Could have to do with the shift from English to French?
---
'H' is sometimes considered as a vowel grammatically in English, because it can be silent and thus puts the stress on the next letter. Ex. "What an honor."
---
In French I don't think 'h' is ever pronounced at the beginning of a word. So for an English speaker we see 'healing' and say 'healing'. For a French speaker they see 'healing' and say 'ealing'
---
Still an error, but there could be more to it than just a mistake.
---
I haven’t seen them in over a week and when I do they don’t come into play very often to care. 
---
Certainly not the case on PC. Open a survivors profile, they're almost always in a 3-4 man. It's pretty rare for me to find a single solo player in my lobby.
---
Spine chill got a change and I don’t know if it’s good or bad and I heard resilience got one 
---
She’s hard to play but definitely not impossible, I usually  play a match a night either her on ps4
---
You could take both if your want and get rid of sloppy butcher, sloppy is a more guarenteed version of slowing down the game, especially when its effect is doubled with coulrophobia 
---
As somebody who plays both survivor and killer equally, how is looping toxic? T-bagging I understand as it’s a bm but the killer is faster than the survivors and thus unless the survivor manages to drop a safe pallet or vault a safe window to break line of sight then they won’t get that opportunity to hide. Depending on your positioning when the chase begins this isn’t always possible. Would you prefer the survivors just let you hit them rather than attempt to loop you? Not to mention playing a P3 Claudette so you can just hug a wall and disappear doesn’t exactly take a tonne of skill either 
---
Telligible isn’t a word though. Intelligible means something that is able to be understood and comprehended; what you were using telligible for.
---
What is this a defense for? Survivor toxicity? Anyone who has played this game knows how making the game a 3v1 is advantageous for the killer, it’s just a scummy tactic when you reappear as Hag, or just chainsaw away and back to hooks, or sit afar with a hatchet/max blink charged etc...completely ignoring the generator pressure.
---
No such thing as tunneling. I don’t pull off a gen just cuz i made progress on it. I do my best to finish that objective as quickly as possible. Only reason ppl don’t like it is because the killers objective is you. If ppl want less tunneling/ camping then they shouldn’t ask for so many bbq nerfs. That was the perk that encouraged moving away from the hook. Now all you gotta do is jump in a locker and the killer has no idea if that means you are hiding or if you are close by for a save. That’s why we use headsets to relay info on where the killer is so we can make a save while he is busy elsewhere and if he doesn’t leave then we finish gens. 
---
My games in the past few days have been about 4 minutes on average. I check peoples profiles and every lobby is either a 4 man, or two duo queues. I very rarely get a solo survivor.
---
That would be true if the first syllable of the word starting with H was not stressed.  But in this case it is. An example of when it could be used before a H would be ‘an heirloom’ or ‘an hour’ 
---
I’ll admit after awhile of that I got angry enough to get ‘tunnel vision’. Even if I didn’t though they were five ranks above me and obviously A LOT more experienced (maybe from a higher rank before reset). Also, no matter what I did they knew where I was and did the generator far away. I suspect pallet thrower could have been following and telling my location. The whole time they never failed a skill check so I couldn’t get an idea of where they could be that way. Then the pallet thrower, at some point it didn’t matter if we were in a chase because pallets are going down no matter what. At that point I’m left with a game where I am so ridiculously outmatched there’s no way to win and someone following me just trying to make it miserable. 
---
Despite the ‘tunnel vision’ the runner was impossible to avoid. It was like he was trying to make it miserable, and at the end in chat it was obvious he got great enjoyment from the fact that he threw so many pallets. Even if SWF will never gets taken out of the game, why would I be matched with someone 5 ranks above me who probably had at least had 5x my hours in the game? 
---
Maybe but I personally found Billy piss easy to play when I first got the game probably because I had experience with stuff like his chainsaw in other games 
---
Lol if I was really camping then they should have had time to do the totems.
---
Wait, a fake Harry Warden leak?
---
Do you have a link OP?
---
I mean.. I agree with what you're going for but also, I think running into the same survivor later in the match isn't tunneling, it's that they got unlucky (or were consistently stupid, depending on circumstances.) Pretty sure most people agree on that.
---
I had a match yesterday, got unhooked by an injured person. Killer immediately returns to hook, ignores the other wounded person &amp; exclusively focuses on me -- I know this, because the wounded person was running behind me &amp; the killer made no effort to swing at them, only at me. We were both equally easy to down in that situation, but the killer only gave a shit about me. That's tunneling.
---
Depends on your definition of amazing play. If you think something like pallet looping on coldwind is skillful, then do you think legions moonwalking is also fun, engaging gameplay?
---
Lol nah I should have just stood in one place spinning in circles the whole match. That would have been much less toxic.
---
*Heavy breathing fades*
---
It's freaking true. I don't know how this shit always happens to me.
---
dang, anime censorship is getting insane 
---
Intelligible means clear &amp; coherent. Unintelligible means incapable of being understood.
---
I just find him hard because once you reach higher ranks you really need to know how much you can turn with all the add-on combos.
---
I stopped playing Billy and tried again recently, and I keep hitting walls because I mess up my turns.
---
I was talking ping to server not ping to player just to be clear
---
Wait a minute... OH NO! IT WAS A TRAP! THERE OCHIDO FANS! RUN MIKEY BEFORE THEY GRAB THERE FLASHLIGHTS!
---
Old brand new part: am I a joke to you? 
---
First of all, how can I change my playstyle to counter a doctor? I really struggle with him in every game and I always snap out of it if need be,but I don't know how to be better against his powers.
---
Secondly, is there a way I can communicate a Killer that one of my teammates is cheating? I had this guy with a speed hack (i noticed after a couple of mimutes because only his running was affected, at first his walk seemed glitched but I was not sure) and the killer eventually noticed and disconnected, but what should I do? Point him to where the cheater is? Bodyblocking the cheater so he can be downed ans removed from the game? What do you do if you find a cheater? 
---
Leader doesn't affect gens anymore
---
This game desperately needs the report function to work. Maybe then people might start treating each other like human beings. Maybe even throw in a commendation reward for being nice so people have incentive not to act like the scum of the Earth and have fun with one another.
---
Haha I seriously and starting to wonder what these survivors really think camping is. Like I can't check the hook at all?
---
True. I usually only use it when paired with Ruin because people usually only cleanse one or the other. If they get ruin, they won’t actively search for HL totem and it ends up biting them in the ass or they get HL totem and have to search even longer for Ruin. Having to search for both totems slows the game down even more
---
Call me what you like, but its happened. Also, how is it if the hatch will not spawn at 3 gens left until theres only one person a swf will let themselves die on the hook and the other person IMMEDIATELY goes through the hatch? Are you saying that theyre just super lucky and the hatch spawns at their feet? That has happened to me more times than I can count, its a really common SWF strategy.
---
How about when theres 3 gens left and I run over the hatch as killer, make a mental note of where it is, and then put that second to last person on the hook and beeline to that hatch? Not possible if it doesnt spawn at 3 until theres only one person left, but that happens at least once a gaming session. You saying im a good and can see the future? If so people escape way too often for my abilities.
---
No. The hatch spawns on the map in proportion to how many gens are required at the beginning of the match. 5 = 3, 4 = 2, 3 = 1, and 2 = 1. It won't open until theres only one person left,  but it's on the map.
---
My point is that working on the same gen together itself is already slowing the game down and is a misplay. It's much harder to apply pressure when survivors are split up and working on separate gens.
---
No one likes a grammar nazi, kid.
---
Not to mention that only works during a chase meaning he has to drop chase to start a new chase with who he has found letting the first person mend and heal. It can waste time but your not gonna get downs by using his locator skill other than as a basic update on who is nearby meaning proper stealth is a solid counter especially considering he has so little map pressure to begin with. People have decided that the chase is THE ONLY fun part for survivors so stealth isn't an real option for counterplay in their mind even if it's literally a valid counterplay option.
---
Definitely seems hard to balance for all ranks. I was trying to think of maybe a second objective for survivors to do besides gens maybe something after the gens are powered and you have to do something else to power the gates completely just to add a little more time but for now I guess it is what it is
---
Hatch will spawn after the first gen I'm pretty sure. If not well 3 minutes is still not that much.
---
Yeah. I know that feel. Especially with the new hex totems you can sometimes miss them
---
Hag is one of the killers you see the least anyway. That’s like wanting to run calm spirit just in case you verse a doctor
---
I love the toxicity that comes with red rank survivor groups. It feels even better when they die
---
It’s not meta nor needed. Plus you can just level up Nea, who is a free character if you really want it 
---
Either hag chases you (unlikely) or you get an unsafe hook. I can’t stand playing with players rank 20-12
---
but free, and it’s good as long as you don’t farm your teammates
---
I thought that too, but every time I've used a freddy one the survivors decide i should get a 3k/4k, but I'm not in red ranks or anything.
---
Huntress has always been free
---
i used ti miss them all the time till i gave up on the perk for awhile lol
---
very true, sadly. sometimes we have to be dicks to actually win or at least get 1 kill. cause when you play fair, you mostly lose unless survivors do extremely stupid mistakes
---
I like you. 
---
I always loathed the idea of incorporating phones into Ghostface as a killer. The bigger takeaway from Scream, imo, was the teamwork element of Billy &amp; Stu.
---
[Here's what I threw together a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/74ya06/being_a_fanboy_and_doing_the_brainstorm_a_killer/)
---
That was probably are 15th game where it was “ToXiC” killer after “tOxIx” killer. We both were very done at this point. I de ranked twice that day. 
---
The Pale Rose (swamp with the boat).
---
Spawn near the boat, crows fly away (Not because of me), and I hear a heartbeat. I hide. Heartbeat goes away. I go up the boat and find his hex. He DC'd immediately.
---
Yeah. I usually try to struggle out as much as possible, because as long as the tunneling killer keeps returning to the hook to be damn sure they get a 1k, maybe my teammates can have time to do a gen or something.
---
Yesterday, for example, in the worst tunneling I've had in a while, I got unhooked while the killer was visible to both me &amp; the injured unhooker. Killer focused exclusively on me, despite the wounded unhooker being right there with me. I started struggling on hook trying to buy them time to do more gens (since the only gen done was by me, before someone else popped Haunted Grounds &amp; resulted in my downing in the first place,) then spun my camera and realized.... one was crouched in a corner, one was searching a chest, and one was breaking a dull totem. I stopped struggling. Begun spectating. None of them touched a gen for the entirety of the match. Good job, team.
---
When I play killer, I also avoid tunneling. Since I don't camp - and always devote to a hook-and-book strategy - if someone tries to farm their teammate before I can literally turn around (so we're talking, oh, I don't know, 2 seconds?) then I'm going to focus the unhooker for being a crap teammate. If I accidentally down the unhooked instead, I will pick up/drop them until they can run again, because I'm not going to be that person. You can't reject being unhooked, so it's not your fault that your teammate is an ass.
---
What if they've done jack and shit the whole game?
---
Oh yeah, forgot about her
---
Wow... so many clutch moments, great compilation.  
---
Amazing pallet save against the Billy and an incredible hook save against the Camping Spirit.  
---
How the hell did Claudette escape through the exit with a fresh reverse bear trap placed upon her noggin'?
---
I was more concerned with if hitler made it out of the trial alive
---
Are you dumb? 
---
I had the same glitch happen to me! I’ll try to find the post that i made and link it, but this seems to be an issue kn the survivor’s side. 
---
Yeah the way he said was... interesting, but they do go by the same principles. (Only difference is tunneling can sometimes be detrimental but the payoff is pretty big and it makes late game really in the killers favor) They’re both unfun to play against but they are both just each side doing their job as efficiently as possible. Sometimes it’s better to  pressure someone else but often it’s realistically much more worth it to pull someone out of the match so you have less to deal with. Neither gen rushing nor tunneling is fun to play against, but I mean it works for sure.
---
Why do you think people disconnect if they suspect a pink mori?
---
Simple. Nobody wants to feel completely robbed of their game. You get three hooks to take you out, but if you introduce a douche bag play into the game, then you’re fucked, your game is over faster, and only because the killer feels like being a douche to you. 
---
Imagine if you will, a game where multiple survivors have the REALLY old version of Brand New Part. The one that immediately fixed a gen to 100%. Are you likely to stay in a match (or be happy with a game in general) if 10 seconds into the game, you hear multiple gens pop off? No. You’d think it was completely horse shit. Your chances of having any kind of win just decreased dramatically, and there’s nothing YOU can do about it. 
---
Same goes for tunneling. You decided to rob someone of their extra chances to survive the game. It’s one thing if you happen across and injured survivor you’d hooked a bit ago. It’s another to purposefully wait until they’re unhooked just to go after them again. You are robbing them if any chance of continuing the game, and that is completely toxic. 
---
She can still be bullied with urban evasion though. Lots of times you see her running to your gen and you just crawl around low cover and since she is short she cant find you. I don't play hag anymore because i would get bullied as soon as i hit rank 6-7.
---
If he didnt slow down so much when powering his chainsaw hed be pretty good
---
that's...a double negative
---
monkaS
---
So, ehm, I just got hit through a wall by a killer.
---
Lol still crying? Haha your the salty one it's just a damn game.
---
Well they just want to have fun, and getting 4 man SWF full of P3 Claudette’s with flashlights, instaheals and DS isn’t fun. I’ve left to make a new lobby countless times because I want to have fun with Freddy and not get absolutely waffle-stomped. 
---
Plays doc with huge terror radius. Becomes a sneak amanda or shape. 
---
I would rather have this fixed than the sloppy butcher, I lost so many good offerings due to this.
---
She might not have disconnected, even if the tally screen shows she got 0 points. If the killer's scoreboard loads before yours and she clicks to leave instantly then it will look like she's DC'd when she hadn't.
---
Source: My friend and I thought we made a killer DC at the end once, watched the killer's stream back and she just left the scoreboard early 
---
I FUCKING HATE LOWERCASE LETTERS, BUT I ALSO HATE THE FACT THAT THE HIT BOXES ARE STILL WONKY. IT'S BEEN LIKE 3 FUCKING YEARS. SORT YOUR SHIT OUT

Or a legion that ignores pallets
---
Damn, good to know.

No but it does affect his dream world terror radius so it isn’t that bad on him. Lose a guy in the chase, just stand still and see their aura no matter where they are. 
---
Then grow some fucking balls and don't chicken out of an argument, re-editing your comments
---
you're*
---
Also do you know how to say anything other than the word cry and salty cause it sounds like 12 y.o vocabulary to me
---
Gen rushing isnt a thing anymore. It comes from when brand new parts finished a gen in 5 seconds. So teams would do one gen normally then just finish the other 4 in 5 seconds so the game was over in less than like 1.5 mins.
---
That is not what happens now. It is just bad map pressure/putting too much focus on people who are wasting your time. Injure everyone and break off chase if you're not going to get them within a reasonable amount of time. I was a killer when brand new parts would kill games. That combined with insta blinds made it quite a challenge. Nowadays it is drastically easier than it was so it is annoying to see people cry gen rush when in reality they aren't putting pressure on the team/map.
---
Why is this downvoted? Whilst the end of your comment is a mess, top tier Nurses have incredible map pressure and do not need ruin whatsoever. 
---
wonder how broken nurse would be with m&amp;k on console. Even without the stigma that console players are bad trying to juke and loop with a controller is quite the disadvantage. What is the frame rate on consoles and can you look behind you as you run?
---
This is the chapter I never realized I wanted until now.
---
4 new survivors and Joey Fatone as the killer. Make it happen, BHVR!
---
20 while seconds. With tier 3 wake up, 17.3 seconds. 
---
Plenty of time for the killer to arrive, but they looooove camping that hook instead. 
---
Still too weak. Buff please
---
So he should be a killer with no chase potential? So basically not much changes then.
---
He will only hit many players with a saw when defending a hook or basement. His saw needs practicality outside of those situations, so without making him Billy 2, he needs a way to use it in a loop to secure a down.
---
Otherwise nothing significant changes at all.
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
hAhA, yOu MaDe A tYpO
---
Wow thanks a lot dude
---
Thank you for doing it yourself...LOL
---
Tunneling is very much a thing. You can argue it isn’t toxic and is a legit and fair strat but you can’t argue it doesn’t exist as it’s a fact that it does exist. 
---
Forgot to mention that I was in a chase the entire time. Sorry about that.
---
No, you kept ignoring the subject and taking on me so it's correct dumbass
---
OK, that's weird. 👀 
---
I don't fear him at all. It's actually the most boring gameplay I have ever encountered in DbD to date. I like the asthetics of them. Even though nurse is hard but I actually like playing against her. I just want them to make the gameplay more exciting against Legion. I just don't know what it will take.
---
Thx now I just need friends 
---
Double cosplay 
---
Rancor’s alright. It often feels like a meaner noed though lol
---
So it’s still in the game. Yikes. We should all report the bug on the forums. I’ll go make a post now and I’ll put the link here when I’m done. 
---
Location depending if you actually understand the locations and structure of the loop it can be. And you are still using a perk on the chance that you get a pallet slammed on you which most of the time you will see coming and be able to react. It’s a niche perk that is only relevant for half a second every once in a while. 
---
My caps lock button is broken
---
The question is can he actually stalk you from up there? 
---
You’re insane 
---
no repair speed bonus. correct
---
WHY REMOVE SLOPPY BUTCHER WRAITH BUG SMJ
---
It’s just a meme name folks gave it and nothing more. Hell some perks even encourage you to tunnel someone. We even have big icons around the name that says hey find and murder that guy
---
WHY DIDNT THEY BUFF LEGION IN THE PATCH LIKE THEY WERE MEANT TO DO
---
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
---
But the perk description still names reparing 
---
Lol no that's exactly what you did. You're clearly mad about all the chainsaws you've taken up the ass and need someone to take it out on. It just a game. There's really no need for all the petty insults. It does nothing
---
Then dc and save yourself and the killer some time 
---
Yeah-and the survivors would have to adapt, with the added knowledge that the killer has no perks anymore, and no offerings obv. Wouldn't be OP at all, IMO.
---
Oink!
---
Like I said, if that’s what you want to believe about it, I won’t try to change your mind. You and I have differing opinions and that’s okay. Take it easy. 
---
Oink!!!!!
---
Are you okay?
---
yeah iam a survivor and killer main and i still give you props
---
Add urban evasion to the top picture and you're right.
---
“That makes sense” I can tell that person is a Claudette 
---
GETTING STUCK ON TREES
---
He does about as any other base killer in the chase, and just a reminder, most of those average chase killers are barely mid tier with exception of their powers that help in the chase. 
---
So you give him the power to pressure a loop? Just like Billy can do with a saw fake. Pig can do with an ambush. Huntress can end loops in seconds, protect targets from a distance and guard hooks almost as well as LF.
---
LFs saw should allow for mindgame potential and a potential Insta down or a pallet drop, otherwise he is bound to the basement or will become a weak Billy with no discerning features. No tantrum, no cooldown on dropping saw faster hold speed and a longer base duration, all combined will give him the power to use a saw around a loop in hopes for a down or an easy pallet break. 
---
Now he has some chase potential and a strong defence around hooks/basement if he wants. He would be a complete opposite to Billy who is high mobility and single target, LF can provide strong lockdowns on zones where his prey hangs. 
---
Compared to anyone else currently, it wouldn't be OP at all.
---
Nurse exists. Billy is basically the standard for balanced killers. Huntress is a long range LF if you want a comparison. Hag would be similar but based around map pressure as well as chase and defence.
---
He would fit around B tier for the first time ever and would allow a LF to actively use the saw for loops as well as defence.
---
The chili addons are bugged and do literally nothing for him

You are the one to talk after telling me to "lick the spot under your balls". And yet again ad hominem btw
---
Tou need to stop.  Survivors and killers both need to learn how to gauge safe and unsafe pallets and if you're that tilted by looping, learn when to break the pallet and how to herd the survivor while doing so.
---
yeah but i dont like huntress so never put points in her to get it
---
It’s tally unplayable 
---
I’m accurate. I have actual numbers. What do you have besides snide remarks?
---
All I see are those succulent 4 stacks of WGLF
---
But not strong enough to instantly cheese any loop. If he uses it in front of a pallet, he breaks the pallet, if the survivor camps the long of the pallet, LF could use the pallet side to try and mindgame like Pigs dash but more lethal.
---
It wouldn't be Op at all, and like Pigs dash, would give a chance to dodge but only if a survivor is 100% on point with ping, tracking and movement.
---
Isn’t that what he’s saying though? Running into that survivor again and going after them is fine, but it’s the ones who linger near the hook waiting to pounce on the unhook who are the shit killers. I agree with this as well. I get a little confused though as to whether the latter is considered proxy camping or tunneling.
---
Nah, bloodhound isn’t necessary. Bamboozle isn’t either, believe it or not. Considering you’re already cutting off some spots with your bottles. I recommend whispers as your replacement for bloodhound, and NOED (I know, people hate the perk, but this is all purely for the most optimal setup using the perks you have) as a replacement for bamboozle. Whispers is very useful for early and late game, people underestimate it’s early game potential, where the game is most important. 
---
His tantrum is not supposed to be a good thing. It is a penalty for hitting an object. Not a reward because you couldn’t control your aim. It’s just a plus that you can hit people that are dumb enough to walk towards you.
---
You do realize Bill (yes, the same one from left4dead) is a survivor in dbd, right?
---
New feature?
---
I don't. I just let them chase me till I bleed out typically and kill myself on first hook. Don't be a sook.
---
Loops are strong against him because he has a very very strong defensive potential. Or did you forget that?
---
You cannot have it both ways. You don’t get to take out multiple people at once as well as yeet around the map with zero repercussion. All other killers have that. 
---
Not only are you embarrassing yourself with your hypocrisy but you're being an awfully pathetic human being so I will stop before you turn into more of a degenerate than you already are. 
---
Thank you for taking the time to "argue" with me
---
Ahh I see now
---
Lol your first comment was literally telling me to go fuck myself. In almost every comment you've called me stupid in some way. How many times have i thrown any personal insults towards you? Honestly if that doesn't scream salt I don't know what does. 
---
But he can already do this at certain pallets. And pigs dash isn’t an instadown, that’s the difference.
---
Yours doesn't, and that's lame.
---
I mean the survivor gets out of what's probably a game with a bad connection, so take that thought too.
---
THE HADDONFIELD HALLOWEEN MUSIC IS SO LOUD HOLY FUCK MY EARS AAAAAAA
---
Rank 10-6 is where you’ll find most of your enjoyment in matches. 
---
Couldn't pick a caption.
---
Alternative caption: _My thirsty ass when daddy Myers is stalking me._
---
Not sure about the frame rate, but i have a pspro and don’t notice many drops right after the game starts... yea you can look behind you pretty easily and 360 and such.
---
Anyone have the image without the caption? 
---
And would you by chance have any proof to back that up? Seeing as the vast majority of the player base agrees that tunneling exists I don’t think you can simply call it, “a meme name.” 
---
Can you please not edit your comment? The original one says "lick the spot under my balls" which clearly states frustration. Please add EDIT after an edit to clearly state what you said and not change the opinion of new people that join the conversation. Seems totally unfair to me.
---
Most trappers are very counterable, but one that can hide his traps well and predict your movements ahead of time can be a big pain in the ass.
---
Yeah i did so and I take responsibility, i am not a degenerate who edits his own comments. Good bye sir
---
Wait you are having a sensible conversation with differing opinions.....are you some sort of unicorn? I feel like this should be framed on my wall
---
He doesn’t have any counterplay in chases. 
---
Should be considered**
---
I also like you
---
So...You see a few players with some tool boxes you'll back out yeh? See some medkits? Could have instaheals on them? Just back out eh? See some bloody outfits? Fuck that? You're that guy?
---
Agreed 
---
I fixed it
---
Because your repair speed is slower, when you're not alone on a gen. Red indicates that.
---
But L4D is the originating game (and more of a widespread success too)
---
Except if they farm off hooks and are selfish then the killer can break them all.
---
"I play killer so much"  
---
"I dont own freddy"   
---
dont say you've had enough of killer when you haven't even tried them all smh
---
Hahaha embarrassed??? It's just a game! Well you sure did determine a lot about me based on a damn game.
---
If you both work on the same generator you both get a tiny debuff, faster than if a single person was working on it, but ultimately slower than if you were to each do your own gen. 
---
There is no way to play the game, but there is a moral way. If that was the only guy there and you clearly saw him run away plus the Claudette was at 1% health, why did you come back?
---
Besides that, if the was actually being save, what would you do? *FARM* her? Wait behind her to hit her? Is that fun? To spam space and then die for nothing?
---
Hag has strong loop potential, strong map pressure and strong defence. She is the 2/3 best killer in the game. 
---
Huntress can pressure loops and easily defend a player. 
---
Pig can pressure some loops and provide game stall with map pressure.
---
If you've ever played LF you'd know that he barely if ever downs many players at once unless locking down a zone. A smart survivor would just rush him or use Bt to trade a hook.
---
There are other killers in the game that do pressure, defence and chases as well as or better than him, some killers can do all 3 with ease, and others can do only 2.
---
LF can only defend. It's his only skill. His saw is useless outside dumb survivors farming hooks. Allowing him to end loops quicker with his power would make him more oppressive overall, allowing him to snowball quicker and gain pressure via hooks faster.
---
He has no map pressure, no chase potential. He needs a significant buff to his saw to do one of those things and map pressure won't happen without adjusting him to basically be Billy 2. A better saw in loops is what he needs and what he should get.
---
But why would it be slower when working on a gen with a teammate. Before the update it wasn't like that.
---
Maybe it stated somewhere in the update description and I didn't see it?
---
Lol there you go with the childish insults again. Did I strike a nerve there?
---
That’s not what he said. He said that it’s turning red when he IS working with someone else. It shouldn’t have that effect. 
---
This is the best thing to happen to survivors in a loooong time. This has already saved me from getting hit through a window a few times.
---
But he only gets many survivors down when deadzoning a hook or camping basement.
---
A lot of other killers can down many survivors at once, Huntress is an amazing camper because she can down with a small cooldown. Hag can trap escapes for easy quick hits. Billy's saw is a quick cooldown and highly mobile. Trapper can trap exits to force hits. Myers can end a team in 1 burst of EW3. 
---
A lot of killers can play defence. But the better killers can do more than one niches. If all killers are to be on a somewhat equal level, LF needs changes to make his kit more viable outside of a niche that may not even happen.
---
You have no skill potential with LF, he is a basic, brainless camping killer with minimal power use and needs a buff to said power to make him competitive with others in the roster.
---
If your advice to a weak and underpowered killer is to play a better killer, then the problem as said by yourself is with the weakness of the killer and not the player.
---
Period. 
---
I mean, I'd give you counterplay, but I'd much rather you be an easy target since you called me a cunt.
---
Nice try baby survivor. 
---
Lol i hope its not as bad as i think its going to be 
---
If I’m not mistaken, it is red because your solo effort has decreased by 10%. If you yourself where to be running prove thyself you would be getting white or yellow because your solo effort has increased. I think if he was running leadership, that would take you out of the red. I don’t know if that makes any sense, I’m still half asleep
---
I think D-Strike increasing the success rate of followup blinks and chainsaws by 50% is entirely fair, it should be written on the perk really.
---
Haddonfield is one of those maps that makes me instantly regret playing DBD the second I hear the Halloween theme as a Killer, but makes me think "I'm getting out alive" on survivors.
---
I said you were attempting to be a cunt. Perhaps you should actually read the comment, besides, you leaving this reply just makes my initial statement even more valid and you’ve continued to make your argument invalid. 
---
P.S. I’m a killer main lmao 
---
Hahaha keep going crybaby. So do you always BM killers for out playing you?
---
The bar in this game, for any action, turns red when YOU personally are operating below 100% efficiency. When you work on a gen with another person, YOU personally are working at 90% efficiency.
---
That would be HELLA FUN, Perhaps we will see this after we have dedicated servers.
---
Prove Thyself is not kinda busted though, it literally allows pre-patch gen repair speed with other people on the same gen. 
---
 Or gonna lie, im always running around because I just can’t stand walking because it’s so slow and I only crouching when I have to 
---
well adept only ask you to escape and i guess if you need the hatch you survive, not live [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XJ2-PBf2XU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XJ2-PBf2XU)
---
Lullaby wouldnt be enough useless if we didn't get a notification really right away that the killer for a running it
---
Was that changed, I thought it remained at the old 3/6/9?
---
Survivors: “killers have the advantages down the game leans in their favor” 
---
nah bro, we just strugglin along
---
Actually, you wrote it since we're going for technicalities. I can't read things that you say unless it's been transcribed.
---
I'm still not giving you counterplay because you're a baby survivor. 
---
Well leader no longer affects gens. But the math actually makes since now.
---
Leatherface is not fine. He is literally the second worst killer in the game, or even the worst killer in the game. His power is worthless and might be useful once every 10 games. He needs a buff or rework.
---
If you don't at some point prioritize weaker survivors you can have a good game where you get a lot of hooks and everyone still escapes because you didn't want to "tunnel." Someone has to be taken out eventually and it could very well seem "unfair"
---
“Sir, I get my rework this patch?”
---
“Sorry, Fred.”
---
“Oh.”
---
[sad Freddy slowly walks out of the office]
---
An unsafe loop is a down for anyone. A killer with a chase power can use the kit on many loops to try for a mindgame into a hit.  LF cannot do that.
---
Regardless of who has the best stall, LF has none. On top of that, his chase power is useless outside of loops that already result in downs anyways.
---
Meaning without making LF a highly mobile chainsaw killer like Billy with a single target instadown, and to keep the defensive taste that the killer has held through all his films, he must have a quicker and better saw as to enable his ability to defend quicker and turn a match in a faster fashion.
---
LF needs chainsaw chase buffs. A way to attack loops with a mindgame or a forced drop, otherwise he is doomed to be a basic M1 killer that can only use his power against large misplays by a player or when he camps/deadzones a region of the map.
---
New to the game, but what does SWF stand for?
---
What gay porno is this?
---
Ahh that makes since. I didn't account for the prove thyself bonus be applied after the debuff. Thanks.
---
claudette’s screams SENT ME OFF SKSKSKSKSKSKS
---
And don't forget ruin, btw flashlights are too weak
---
Rank reset tends to ruin lower ranks for a while, and unfortunately, deranking is popular with some of the more toxic parts of the community, so they can bully less experienced players.
---
As of now you’re the only one reaching at technicalities. 
---
You don’t have to, you’ve already made any points you actually try to make completely moot. 
---
Have a good day kiddo. 
---
gg ez 
---
This is just the same as killers lobby dodging I suppose, leaving when they see something they can’t/don’t want to handle. 
---
Woah slow down there. You're jumping from one end of the discussion to another. You still haven't answered something, and i will state it slowly so you can understand.
---
Why. Did. You. Edit. Your. Comment. 
---
Exactly the comment stating how i should "lick the spot under your balls"
---
*again with the "crybaby" stuff oh boi*
---
Also how did you get that idea in your second phrase? Please enlighten me, i am rather curious
---
That’s a weird change. 
---
Hey man I have had and know several people that have had these issues it is not easy talking about it and doesn't always feel like it does something the important thing is to keep going at it's something I deal with on and off and the best thing that I have found is a good support group. Hope this can continue to be a tool until that is no longer a problem for you and hopefully see you in the fog &lt;3
---
Lmao. I get it. You’re just bad at him. 
---
Can't relate, have all licenced DLC, never had to deal with splinters
---
Ah, forgot about leader being changed as well.
---
Hit or miss for legion beginners
---
I just died a little in side 
---
Rework &gt; Buff. 
---
He does not need it be downing multiple proper if he’s allows to corner and move faster. 
---
It's a new bug from the 1.5.0 it happens all the time for some players. It happened to me 10 of 15 matchs. 
---
This. If the killer's using Wifi, you're in for one hell of a ride.
---
Survive With Friends
---
Lol because every time I say something you start crying harder and it's funny. If you wanna stop taking chainsaws up the ass then get gud instead of attacking random people on reddit. 
---
well that is the correct way to play against a hag who is lacking in setups
---
Picture Kira as a Killer in this mode. His power with Killer Queen could be 
---
1 - Touch pallets, lockers and gens turning them into a bomb. Max 3 at a time and will explode on contact with a survivor causing damage to the survivor and any friend in the explosion radius.
---
2 - Sheer Heart Attack - Killer Queen spawns Sheer heart attack which will be automatically attracted to the generator which is generating the most hear (Progress + survivors on it). Won't follow survivors but will auto blow up at generators causing survivors to flee.
---
3 - Killer Queen Bites the Dust - When 4 generators are started Kira is backed into a corner - the 3rd bomb activates. Any remaining survivors automatically are affected by this bomb and will be downed automatically when next hit (Lasts 60s). 
---
Man I would love Yoshikage Kira and Killer Queen to be in this game.
---
I think I'm going to either use trapper to mark/trap the items or pig so they can't leave with the items. XD
---
Lightborn! Yes, now my custom Ironworks mask can actually function!
---
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCEEE
---
KIRAA QUEEN. DAISAN NO BAKUDAN. BITES ZA DUSTO.
---
Thank you!
---
Which is f'n dumb cause streamer counts for the killers too.
---
No and no. Just wanna spark some jolly ol’ unbiased debate. I’m a survivor main tho (ps4) if that helps answer your question lol 
---
https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/503/what-is-the-correct-way-to-pluralize-an-acronym
---
As much as I would actually love to play that it'd take too many major changes to be reasonably implemented in a short period of time.
---
You gotta make new maps (or at least add onto existing maps), cause just saying if(#killers=2), then(Mapsize\*2) would lead to a lot of useless empty space.
---
Probably gotta make some new structures for the new maps to keep things interesting.
---
Probably gotta increase the # of totems on a map to account for 2 killers worth of totem perks. You probably also need to implement this whole mode after they've adjusted totem placement.
---
Speaking of, do killer perks stack? Double ruin sounds like cancer. How do we adjust Thanataphobia to fit 8 people? Can one killer apply 8 total stacks, or does each killer need to hit 4 separate people? Do we have to specify which 4 people each killer has to hit or can it be a free for all?
---
Cool as this idea may be, you'd almost have to completely rebuild the game.
---
Lmao get gud and you won't have to deal with "hypocrites like me"
---
Then it's a translation error. It's everything besides generators now.
---
I only dc on legion if they try to moonwalk on me. Fuck that shit, 0 counterplay and no skill from either side. 
---
I've dodged twice. Once was this group with matching names, and another one was a match with 4 people with toolboxes, after I had just gotten out of a match where 4 people with toolboxes/matching school girl outfits/matching Prove Thyself Perks, finished two generators in the time that it took me to spawn &amp; walk to my second generator and I was like, I'm not going through that again today.
---
It's wasn't very noticeable anyway, it's the survivor version of fire up
---
I know what it was mate but a term is a term. People still call tunneling tunneling even though tunneling literally just means you made a bad save or the guy you saved it stupid and ran towards the killer. It is easier and sometimes it is a result of the killer failing to apply pressure but there’s only so much pressure each killer can apply effectively which is why you see a lot of nurses and Billy’s at rank one. I’ve been playing both sides since before the game came out on console so I very much understand what it used to be, but the reality is that gens still get done too fast if survivors play effectively and gen rushing is now just a term to describe that. 
---
Saying the BNP nerf got rid of gen rushing is like saying that the borrowed time buff in 2.4.0 got rid of tunneling. You can still focus gens or focus down one person but it’s now a bit harder, and it’s not fair for me to tell someone that tunneling doesn’t exist and they don’t know what real tunneling is because they didn’t play the game when borrowed time would deplete in a chase.
---
Happened earlier, I think it was a straight unplug too because instead of disconnecting, the game was frozen in place for everyone for a good 2 minutes.
---
I feel like someone is penetrating her ass. But I like it.
---
Michael's ability is called the Evil Within. Which has three tiers, which he levels ups by "stalking" survivors (looks at them with the knife down). When the ability is at level three he can down a survivor with a single hit. 
---
So what can happen is when one survivor could be new or they're just being a dick, is that Michael can farm his ability off of one person and just use his ability on another survivor.
---
it’s crazy how 0.1 of a second and a little new animation changes the game !
---
I never dodge Claudettes, I love Claudettes. They make really stupid choices because they think they're invisible.
---
Yeah I think that instead of nerfing Legion, just buff everyone else appropriately 4Head
---
The quality crossover content I live for! 
---
Depends on how good your teammates are. At low ranks, I would still run it. At high ranks, you can probably get away with not running it.
---
I agree with all of that. The only thing I find scummy and a sign of a bad killer is the proxy camp turned tunnel. In the first example, I’m more annoyed with myself. I know a lot of people do probably scream “tunnel!” for that when it’s totally not warranted.
---
Oh.
---
I have definitely been that survivor more than once then lmao
---
Oh yes repeating the same words over and over again. You must be an individual of high intellectual capability.
---
Again, "get gud" with what? You are leaving your phrases unfinished. If you can't even form a coherent sentence what is the point in arguing, why do you even try to embarass yourself more?
---
Do you comprehend what hypocrite means or are you saying it because i kept mentioning? There is no need for quotes there, you are a hypocrite and i see you find both the pleasure and time in relaying it to me
---
Toolbox + gate = open, yay or nay? 
---
If you're devolving to name calling in a balance discussion you have no place discussing balance.
---
They gave him a buff on this patch...his chainsaw is randomly silent now. 
---
Oof the pain. I probably will just farm around as killer. 
---
Wu - Exito openo faster
---
VIG - hey errybody look at mi im exhausted a little less
---
I can agree with you in some way, but I have payed for this game aswell and I sure want to enjoy it. When I get matched up against legion I don't enjoy the game even if I win or loose. Just 15 minutes down the drain, but ofc thats just my opinion. 
---
Localization error. The value probably did not change.
---
Probably 4.5k since its 13.5k for full set. 
---
They need to make it wear survivors dont spawn near totems, and totems are better hidden. Spawned next to ruin 3 times in a row lol
---
New Surveillance is great. Gotta keep your eyes peeled for the yellow, there's no audio cue for it, but as long as you're paying attention you'll catch it.
---
Hell, the new Spies is pretty sweet, too. The range is fantastic and the new notification bubble is actually useful.
---
Predator so that scratch marks are closer and not spread out
---
I still have people join separately and together with little correlation to swf or not so I’m not sure if the matchmaking is affecting queue times. If they shadow patch then I have no way of knowing so you could be right for all I know.
---
Feels bad
---
Remember when everyone cried that he was the most garbage killer they've ever released then figured out they can moonwalk and run Frank's mixtape and cold dirt every game and be a different kind of garbage.
---
I agree if I have a 4 man swf I’ll leave I’m not having 10 minutes of frustration. 
---
It looks kind of out of place. It doesn't add to the scary feel at all.
---
I don’t get hit when vaulting anymore 🙏🏼
---
Bill looks so depressed 
---
Tarnished version is 300 Auric Cells only, rest are 250 Auric Cells or 4,500 Iridescent Shards.
---
&gt; They can't stop the external communication...
---
They don't want to. They have said this in the past.
---
i might be wrong but i think it's RuPaul's drag race
---
That's what you see when there is an event with double/triple bloodpoints and you bring distressing, all survs and you bring party streamers, and y'all farm 
---
Can you imagine the potential for cosmetics? 
---
I’m all in on C-O-L-E V-O-N C-O-L-E
---
They changed it on the ptb but it didn't go into the live game
---
You here this every time a survivor is downed. Similar to the Halloween theme with Myers.
---
Survivors have to misplay for Ruin to be good. For good Survivors Ruin is a buff. With normal checks they may not be as focused, may hit more goods than greats. With Ruin in play good Survivors crank out the great checks like rabbits crank out babies, and the end result is faster gen progress.
---
lol imagine being in denial of being a fucking ching chong
---
I spawned next to a hex 3 times yesterday though 
---
I love the facecamp right after 
---
Just a simple 1 under it
---
Is there an unexpectedDragRace sub because we’re gonna need one with all these crossovers 
---
CLAUDETTE AND HER INVISIBLE FUCKING BODY AND HITBOX SMALLER THAN ONE OF THE FUCKING CROWS (THIS IS EVEN MORE ANNOYING AS HUNTRESS) I CAN SERIOUSLY NOT EVER FUCXKING HIT THEM AGGFHHHHHAHHH!
---
um
---
You are only spouting the same crap over and over like it somehow makes the argument different. Looping has to be strong against someone how can now down everything in his path. Period. Your other examples are laughable. 
---
Huntress? Who can’t dodge her axes these days. 
---
Hag? Ezpz flashlight and crouching. 
---
Trapper? Leave the loop while he sets up a trap to close you off. 
---
LF has a damn near guarantee to take anyone/everyone out if they’re dumb enough to get near him or in front of him. You cannot buff that kind of ability unless you nerd the ability in other places. Giving him any buff will have to remove his downing potential.
---
Also, I didn’t call you a name. I stated a fact. 
---
Killers shouldn’t be able to see survivor’s items to balance this out, nor should they be able to see if a survivor is prestiged or not. And this update totally fucked solo survivors because I am not waiting around NOT PLAYING THE GAME just to see what the killer killed me with. If they didn’t have the means to separate the update from affecting solo vs SWF they shouldn’t have released it yet. Period.
---
For the most part what you described is just camping except someone saved the guy so ofc he went down, the killer was camping him and wants him dead. The killer leaving and coming back is just the killer baiting or predicting a save and whether we like to hear it or not that’s more of an outplay than the killer being unfair.
---
In those situations where the killer is camping just do gens and force him away and then once he’s occupied or on the other side of the map then go for the save. There is always counterplay to what the killer is doing, you just have to know what you’re doing.
---
Oh fuck yes 
---
Luv her
---
Apparently it's a new bug where the dc symbol doesn't appear when a person dcs.
---
wait why is it tagged nsfw
---
Honestly I like playing high ranks, it's more of a challenge and if I'm just against new players I get bored
---
I have this ointment for this crazy rash I had down there once. It says for external use only so I don't know if it would work for you. I guess your anus is external. You gotta make sure you stay away from Leatherface boi though or it won't heal correctly....
---
RIP, devs need to reward the players who play there game alot. Doesnt need to be anything fancy, just needs to be something. Rank 1 has nothing, devotion has nothing, just give us something devs. I'm almost devotion 5, and past time I know of the devs doing something for the people who played, was legacy over 2 years ago &gt;_&lt;
---
I'm pretty sure that survivor perks that require you to be in the terror radius only apply if you are in Freddy's actual terror radius and not just the song radius.  You just won't actually be able to hear the normal terror radius when you're awake, but it's still there. Usually when playing against Freddy I will notice Stake Out progressing around the same time as I hear the lullaby, but I had a game against a Freddy using Red Paint Brush and I could very clearly hear the song without actually making any progress on Stake Out.  
---
Close to or within line of sight? Proximity was never mentioned, so if you're spawning within sight of a totem it sounds like the changes weren't fully implemented or still needs work.
---
Not like you're watching that show or anything..
---
Ok.... And?
---
r/wOoOsH
---
Yea I coulda worded that better to try and say what I think
---
True early game is definitely important you need to get that momentum going otherwise it’s hard to bring it back once gens are popping. I don’t mind noed and haven’t used it much but now that I’m getting lower in rank I see why it’s used a lot lol. I’ll try it out your suggestions and see how it goes
---
I had to do the same last night after receiving a hate message from some boy (or man, I don’t know.) Odd part about it is when he found out I was a girl, he apologized and started trying to have a conversation with me lol, then essentially asked me if I had a boyfriend. 🙄🙄🙄 Boy, no. 
---
Lmao. Killers will ALWAYS use NOED as a crutch perk regardless of the time it takes to open doors. If you suck at killing people before the gates open, that’s on you. Now you’re stuck “securing a kill” or whatever bs excuse killer mains like to say, instead of going to the doors to prevent them from opening. 
---
20 seconds to open a door, 17.3 if you take Wake Up, and you also have to make it out of the exit too, which isn’t as easy if you’ve taken a hit already and the killer is coming. The exits are fine, and Wake Up could use a small muff to make it more worth taking since you don’t even get a full 3 seconds off the escape. 
---
1. Nobody here cares.
---
2. Stop name shaming players. Doesn’t matter what they did.
---
I will respond a week later with the stupid meme. https://i.redd.it/d825ka4r25c21.jpg
---
No witch hunts, gotta block names bro
---
Interesting I had a similar solution not long ago, once they both enter this (hatch zone/space) a mini game or duel of fates as you said begins, while my solution would be a three button prompt with a 20 second timer, amd the prompts themselves? Rock, paper, scissors of course. The ultimate way to determine the true " *better player* "
---
I just made a spacebar macro for this. Seriously one of the annoying parts of DbD if you ask me xD
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.

In a game where the power role already struggles across multiple killers to feel like a power role, I don't think the hatch should just outright hand the advantage to the survivor. They fucked up, their team is dead, the situation should feel mostly hopeless (considering the setting of the game), not hopeful, but that's just me and I understand where you are coming from.
---
Mhm okay
---
It's so cute I love it
---
So everybody, just follow me because i need a little deep wound too see everyone that’s in my heartbeat ( this is the most cringeworthy thing I’ve typed)
---
I just meant that I pretty much always see a Meg or Nea or Claudette 
---
Don't let it rustle your jimmies, your opponent was just doing their objective efficiently. It's like rushing gens, only for killers. 
---
I like to run Sole Survivor just to watch killers juggle me to the hook with no decisive. 
---
You’re delusional, so are all of the people who downvote what I’ve said. Sad!
---
Not bad no, perhaps it is right. I'm just use to seeing a few paragraphs of anger for salt flairs. Personally I'm a fan of the *shit post* flair as it seems to fit and encompass most posts here lol
---
I was under the impression that if the hooked person is flailing that means don't come, killer is still around. Hmm.. 
---
People get offended over dumb shit, don’t worry about it
---
Not a troll, you’re just delusional. Sad!
---
I HATE GETTING HIT WHEN CLEARLY I SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN! ALSO TRYING LUNGING IF YOU ARENT.
---
LOL can you imagine. You've been fighting for your life for the last 10-20 minutes, all the chips are on the table, you walk up the hatch, the huntress drops her hatchet and her axe to the ground. Grubby hands outstretched, the stage is set. We ro sham bo for it!
---
Would you be okay with the killer knowing what perks you have before the match ended? If I knew you had dead hard before you got the chance to use it then you’re running a dead perk. If I know you have DS even though you aren’t the obsession I can juggle you once you hit 35 and make it to that basement hook that I wouldn’t have normally gotten to. If I know you have borrowed time then I’ll down you instead of the guy getting unhooked. I’d have an unfair advantage that eliminates some of your perks before you can use them and that’s exactly what showing the killers loadout does for the remaining survivors.
---
I hate getting out of low ranks after rank reset because my teammates usually decide to let me die on my first hook
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
---
I want a "sell back" system so bad. As someone who never uses maps or flashlights, and rarely uses keys, I'd like to be able to trade back the things I'm almost forced to buy that I'll never use. I'd gladly take a hit to bloodpoints too, say they trade in for 10% or something. But damn do I wanna not feel like my spent points are wasting away on stuff I'll never use.
---
Good to hear from you again! I still feel bad lol.

---
Welcome to the other side of civilization. 
---
i feel like that's still not completely balanced. All hooked survivors also start the game in hooked in struggle phase.
---
Oh my bad it's been a while since I've played the doctor.
---
I HATE IT TOO BUT IT IS A STRATEGY THAT USUALLY PAYS OFF!
---
That would be unrealistically OP
---
Okay, sorry I hurt your feelings on that one. Feel free to leave my post if you’re only gonna name call and not add to the convo. 
---
So do the stitches dissolve or will you need them removed?
---
Yeah that's way too true unfortunately 
---
Proxy camping and tunnelling usually go hand in hand, yep. Tunnelling implies tunnel vision, i.e. focusing on one survivor over anything else. You can’t easily tunnel someone without camping because if you’re not camping, you’ll be doing something else - meaning that you’re occupied and therefore can’t tunnel. This is why I say tunnellers have no map pressure, because they’re so scared their hooked guy will get away that the thought of checking gens or chasing someone else doesn’t occur to them. 
---
&gt; In those situations where the killer is camping just do gens and force him away and then once he’s occupied or on the other side of the map then go for the save. There is always counterplay to what the killer is doing, you just have to know what you’re doing.
---
This is just not true. What’s the counter play for the guy on the hook? Wait to be saved, or die - which doesn’t sound like any kind of counter play at all. And what if the killer doesn’t go to the other side of the map, which this kind of killer usually won’t? Let the guy die I guess and get the gens done, what a fun match for everyone. 
---
I mean, this sort of unfun game play is the reason the devs nerfed the old sabo. Having every single hook on the map permanently broken is frustrating because it removes power from the killer. And even then it had some counter play in the form of the basement, but it’s fucking annoying and unfun to have the other side basically remove your ability to get stuff done so the devs changed it. A killer tunnelling you to death is one of the least fun experiences in this game because there really isn’t much you can do about it unless the killer’s a dope. 
---
Firecrackers will instantly trigger the stun on him as well while he is cloaked.   He doesn't even have to be looking at it, just being in the general area while stealthed is a stun.
---
When the game is full of teabagging, flashlights, hitting on hooks, nodding, and spinning but the post game chat is just gg's. That's what cracks me up.
---
Gamers RISE UP
---
She was new to the nurse I'm hoping. I hope i didnt ruin the game for her is all
---
Yeah, the idea that all 4 survivors using their spare part to fix 1 gen is a bad strategy anyway. Not likely to happen often (if at all) in game. This is an experiment using extremes. 
---
My favorite build to run is Spirit with BBQ&amp;C, STBFL, PGTW, and a free perk space, which is usually Shadowborn, Overcharge, or Franklin's if needed. Addons are Bloody Hair Brooch (reduces phasing charge time) and either Yakuyoke Amulet (moderately enhanced most aspects of phasing) or Rusty Flute (reduces phasing cooldown).
---
The whole purpose of this build is to end chases as fast as possible by being able to almost immediately phase right after you get a first hit on a survivor. Once a survivor is hooked, I'm rewarded with the ability to regress a gen by 25% and I get to know where other survivors are. Rinse and repeat.
---
Balanced&gt;sprint burst you can’t change my mind. 
---
STUPID MOFO SAID 'EZIEST GAME OF MY LIFE' WHEN I WIPED THEM ALL OUT AS THE HAG. WHAAAT HOW DARE HE SAID THAT
---
Yeah, exactly -- I've accidentally run face-first into a scratched-mirror Myers while looking for a heal post-unhook, that was on me. I don't expect him to just ignore me in that situation. You found me again, fair &amp; square.
---
But a proxy camp turned tunnel is just a ResidentSleeper moment.
---
Lol no. Nothing you posted supports what you think it does. Just because they *try* and mitigate the advantage of using third-party voice programs doesn't mean that their game is balanced around it. 
---
Keep spouting nonsense till you get banned bro, i wanna see what more you can come up with
---
Well, new or not, need a lesson to not camp. They got out played on a cheap tactic and couldn't take it.
---
Except hag for some reason.
---
Why? Don't see a correlation here.
---
Survivors fall asleep irl too.
---
*Clever reply that’s witty yet relatable*
---
You got me there boss.
---
There are addons to counter it. Such as doctor exhaustion debuff, huntress addon debuff, clown exhaustion debuff etc
---
WAIT FOR KILLER TO GO AWAY THAN DO YOUR GEN 
---
Ro sham bo? Against the huntress? Thanks I'll hook myself then since I'm 100% positive I can't kick that high lol

Thanks for screwing your teammates
---
With any killer, camping like that is not going to make you a better killer. 
---
Unlikely. It's hard to do sales on in-game currencies. I've never heard of any game doing it. It screws up the profit margins too much.

Yeah, well, all the survivors except David maybe shouldn't have skipped leg day then...

---
Ah yeah, I had just checked the wiki for it and had missed that part.  It seemed like it had to not be that way though, since as you pointed out, 4 survivors with BNPs would complete a gen in 5 seconds and that's not what happened. Also it means Stake Out would be irrelevant(as you also pointed out.)
---
Who the hell runs any of those perks?
---
IT'S ABSURD HOW ADD-ON RELIANT DOC IS. THE RANGE OF HIS BASE SHOCK THERAPY IS ABYSMAL AND ESSENTIALLY USELESS. I DECIDED TO PLAY HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AWHILE WITHOUT A RANGE INCREASING ADD-ON AND I WAS GIVING THE SURVIVORS COLONOSCOPIES AND COULD STILL BARELY HIT THEM WITH SHOCK THERAPY. ADD-ONS SHOULD ALTER THE GAME PLAY OF THE ABILITY IN SOME FORM, NOT MAKE IT BASICALLY VIABLE

I know it seems weird for a guy to be messing with your ass but he's a doctor who probably sees  assholes all day. If anything he'd be impressed by the size of the gaping hole. 
---
But it's not in some cases. Like why does such a paltry move speed increase (no Ed) make such a huge difference? If you didn't know killers are faster than survivors base, you'd be confused.
---
The debuff has been there since the beginning of the game. They might have had some issues with the percentage, but it was always supposed to be -10% per extra survivor working on the gen. So 80 seconds to repair a gen by yourself, 44.44 seconds to repair it with someone else, 33.33 seconds with three people, and 28.57 seconds with four people. The current red bar is just a (welcome or not) visual indicator of that efficiency loss.

.....so you and *your* team can rush your opponent out of a match, but you take issue when your opponent rushes *you* out of a match. Do I have that right?
---
Ha, also forgot that roshambo originally meant rock, paper, scissors (or some variant) but my mind instantly went to South Parks version. But now I want a kenny outfit for a survivor, I mean it would fit the lore nicely. Ya know the whole getting killed time and time again.
---
ACTUALLY YES
---
If they do it continuously, that probably means they're getting camped. If they do it once or twice while they're quarter through their bar, I take it that no one is coming to save them. I do the same when everyone thinks someone else is coming for me. Some get the message and run towards me.
---
Yeah, you got a point there.
---
Had a hag last night that had ruin, devour hope, thrill of the hunt, and rancor. Fun times. I'm starting to play killer more and more and survivor less and less.
---
The result is faster gen progress only if survivors keep hitting greats after the Ruin has been cleansed, which is usually not the case, since we tend to revert back to our unfocused selves. If you hit a great with Ruin still up, you don't get the 5% bonus progression, it works the same as a good skillcheck without Ruin.
---
Your point makes sense when talking about Unnerving Presence when Ruin is not up, 'tho. The more frequent skillchecks usually mean more greats for good survivors.
---
After the patch, i definitely feel like theres been an increase in people keying the hatch.  Just me?  
---
To those who may point out  how it used to be worse back in the day: just because it used to be worse doesn’t mean it still isn’t bad. In fact, one could argue it’s actually worse now because there’s way more teachable perks than there used to be. 
---
Part of the Patch 2.5 Skirmishes
---
I agree totally. The more perks they add the more BPs I need to spend to get perks. There are also more map offerings as well
---
&gt; Not after the fact. They always planned to do SWF. As they have said.
---
You misinterpreted their comment completely.
---
&gt; Still very killer sided. Just look at the escape data they released. Less than 2 survivors escape on average. 
---
God, you guys will never let this go will you? It was such a fuck up by devs to put out such garbage data. They only showed how many survivors escaped at the end of the match. It was not controlled with variables as it should have been. Without including data on hook suicides and DCs, that data point you all breathlessly cite is worthless.
---
You can use graphics settings..
---
I agree

Yeah, thats what I meant with the ":)"

I HATE IT WHEN I PLAY HILLBILLY AND I TRY TO HIT A SURVIVOR AND THEN FOR SOME FUCKING REASON THE HIT DOESNT FUCKING REGISTER LIKE WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?
---
Exactly.
---
Frankly, if SWF players just admitted they have a big advantage and killers got literally anything for dealing with a balance breaking mode, I would shut up about it forever.
---
Because SWF is fun as hell, and it really is going to be impossible for them to not use comms to get an advantage, even if they don't intend to.
---
But no. They argue in bad faith and killers get squat 
---
I don't get it, did the hook not stop moving up and down or something?
---
Maybe some interesting add-ons like how myers has scratched mirror/tomb. It doesn't have to be OP, but something interesting. 
---
I have a theory that no matter what the devs do to reduce grind, people are going to keep complaining about it a few months later.
---
Getting 25K from one match used to require excellent gameplay, or great gameplay plus an offering. (By the way, party streamers and chili weren’t always offerings)
---
I like the following
---
Pig-Use video tape and shattered needles - STBFL -Rancor - Enduring/BBQ/Ruin
---
Billy- Use the green cooldown addon and the tuning guide - BBQ - Whispers - Enduring - Ruin
---
Trapper - Yellow bag and setting tools - BBQ - Enduring - Whispers - Iron Makden/Sloppy Butcher/Nurses
---
But we already know about the huge double standard that exists for killers. 
---
Pallet looping, gen rushing, flashlights, tbagging are all ok.
---
Tunneling is where the line is
---
You can’t wtf. Ohhhh it’s probably cuz they need to make money off of the license purchase

I’ve been playing for a long time, believe me I know. As that other guy said, it doesn’t matter how bad it used to be, that doesn’t change how bad it is now
---
Yup
---
&gt;which is usually not the case, since we tend to revert back to our unfocused selves.
---
Eh, guess you have a point, there.

MinD GaMeS
---
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME HITBOX ITS JUST EASIER TO HIDE AS HER.
---
is the line of sight part definitely in? I've still had ruin disappearing in the first 10 seconds of games at least in 2 out of 5 games i've played today.
---
Is it actually implemented? My understanding when they first talked about it is that the new algorithm was in the system but that totem spawns weren't going to be affected until later on
---
It’s not a bug, it’s how the intended it to be. They discussed it in the dev stream.
---
Other response cleared up my confusion and my answer is no since it's overall pointless, just use Remember Me, Resilience, or stand by someone with Leader. If you're looking for something to help escape faster, that's what keys are for.
---
Leader no longer works on gens
---
Since you pointed that out, I'm a survivor main as well, Rank 1. I play SWF from time to time. Teaming gens is not faster overall than working solo. On the contrary, you lose seconds because of the efficiency debuff when you work together. The more people in the gen, the more seconds you lose overall. You might finish that specific gen faster, but you make the match last longer, which is something that favors the killer. Optimal survivor play is everyone working on different gens from the beginning of the match and making it so the 3 remaining gens are not close together.
---
Lies
---
So people say.
---
a Killer camping?
---
oookay, sounds near pointless and outclassed by the superior keys.
---
Currently uploading a clip. Not lying.
---
CAN WE FIX SCRATCH MARKS IT IS AWFUL TRYING TO FOLLOW THEM
---
the bug is the progress bar being red if i'm not mistaken
---
No that is their intention, confirmed via dev stream.
---
That's cheese, not all of us cheese every game.
---
I don't but you're not going to stop me from saying no to this idea.
---
The speed at which they get killed is entirely dependant on the survivors just like using anything. If you use a hex against someone who lives to hunt hexes, that's on you. If I thicken the mist and the killer is wraith or the pig, that's on me, it's all chance.
---
My new BP farming survivor is WGLF, self heal, dead hard and prove thyself. Averages around 35-50K BP per game
---
Oh ok, mb :P
---
You didn't even have a good reason for saying no lmao you're just mad that the perk could actually have an effective lifespan. That's not a reason to say no. 
---
I think that's fair - if they absolutely don't want to deal with Ruin, they can go totem hunting, which delays their gen progress anyway. I think this would be a good QoL change, but wouldn't this make Ruin slightly OP?
---
&gt; Dawg I play survivor at rank 3 
---
Wow you must be amazing, you reached rank 3. Even so amazing that you haven't learned yet rank doesn't mean much in DBD and almost anyone who plays enough can get rank 1.
---
Well I have news for you, your aim is to do 5 gens, not one. How did you get to rank 3 and thought you just need to rush 1 gen and then you are golden?
---
My point is that in order to get 5 gens done, it's better when survivors are split up and rushing a single gen together is not ideal. "Multiple people on a single gen is faster than a single person on a gen hurr durr", how is that even a counter argument to what I just said?
---
&gt; run your own shit and shut up 
---
Same could be said for you, go do you and shut up? At least my post was constructive, yours is not.
---
&gt; you care way too much about what survivors are doing for a killer; so much so that you're trying so hard to convince someone else what their perk loadout should be 
---
Where did I tell him what his perk loadout should be? I don't care what perks killers run, I care what they think is a good perk and what is only good when survivors don't play optimally. If you can't see the difference then I don't know what to tell you. Also he asked me what perks I use you buffoon, that's the only reason I even mentioned my loadout.
---
Sometime at the end of January 
---
oh ok. i didn't watch dev stream
---
I mean, your first comment just sounds like you're being toxic without knowing the context (i.e. you are obviously friends with OP). But considering how you're acting, you're kinda just proving that you are actually toxic.
---
Maybe that comment should have been a private message
---
rush gens and/or die

Removed - Unrelated Content
---
If you do buy it, I wouldn't buy it for Legion, only if you want his perks and the survivor and his perks.
---
Ah.
---
It's almost kind of necessary at higher ranks because gens get smashed out so fast, but it also tends to get destroyed really quickly. But even then the game getting slowed down even a little bit does help.
---
I actually hate the perk. It's very anti-fun and is just a band-aid covering up mechanics/balance issues at this point. And it means the killer has to waste a perk slot that could be used for something more interesting and actually affects how you play.
---
Oh cool, that's actually pretty refreshing to not have gens be in the same 7 spots.
---
Grilled cheez is worth it
---
That build looks horrible
---
It's probably hard to do but I'd love a power struggle cinematic where you and the killer wrestle and either do skill checks with no chime or a/d mash to win the fight. I'd be super cool and dramatic and a way to mori without actually having it.
---
and/or dc
---
Okay, could you please say it again, then? I suppose it's possible I misread your comment or read over is, but all I see as an argument is:
---
&gt; That's a guaranteed 60 seconds of no gens, no chance at finding a hex
---
And I explained to you how that's completely false 
---
In what way? 
---
I wasn't here for it but according to the wiki, Howling Grounds 2018 started February 15th, which was one day before Chinese/Lunar New Year 2018. It ended on March 1st.
---
This LoS thing that’s being added is really good in my opinion. Hopefully they’ll make them better soon. 
---
I think whatever is that someone creates, if it's theirs it's theirs and nobody should take a claim for what someone else did.
---
Understandable you can add me on steam under the same name as this
---
It's always been more efficient to solo gens, it's just easier to tell now.
---
How do you increase the success rates of things that are entirely based on the skill of players
---
THIS GAME'S PROGRESSION SYSTEM IS SO FUCKING HORRIBLE AND SURVIVORS DON'T GET SHIT FOR BLOODPOINTS 
---
I'M WILLING TO BET A LOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD STAY IN GAMES IF THEY HAD MORE BLOODPOINTS TO LOSE EVEN IF THEY DID POORLY
---
...And this person is doing that with JoJo and Spongebob tho
---
It always has been faster to work on a gen solo. Yes, you’ll finish one gen faster with multiple people on it, but three players working on each their gen will get more gens done faster than three players working on the same gen for three gens.
---
Definitely agree 
---
So you get penalized for doing gens together now? Also happy cake day🎈

No, but now the more people working on 1 gen the less effective each person will be in repairing
---
ELI5: So if a gen takes 80 seconds to repair for one person, it should take 20 seconds for 4 people. Instead it takes like 30

Facts
---
I agree, somethings going on.  In sure it happens before bloodlust too... 
---
Good Survivors will hear your weapon sliding out and will start running wich means that pig grabs arent reliable
---
Now I think it can be useful on stealth killers like Wraith/Pig or map present killers like nurse/billy
---
For Billy/ Nurse i think discordance is the better option because 
---
1. you catch multiple survivors at one gen
---
2. you can get an early game proc and wont waste time looking for survivors
---
3. you dont have to go and kick all gens to get the information
---
In the end it really depends on your playstyle though and how you like to play but i think it replaces overcharge (at least against good survivors that can hit skillchecks)
---
Keep in mind rhat some gens are really safe ( mothers dwelling/... or waste time to get to ( hill generators with ramp at a bad side) so you shouldnt be waisting to much time there just because surveillance procs
---
Good
---
&gt; blinks
---
I won’t say that there’s fun to be had in doing it or being on the other end but the best you can do if the killer is camping the best you can do is to just rush gens and get out. If the killer is camping one guy then going for a save is just gonna waste your time and kill him faster, so if you can do gens outside of the area he’s patrolling then do those. 
---
I think the issue is that the two of us define tunneling as separate things. If the killer is proxy camping or camping and a save is made that allows the killer to go straight after the hooked guy then that’s just camping to me, and tunneling is more so when the killer is applying map pressure or could down someone else and still chooses to go after the injured person. 
---
When I play killer I will hook person #1 and go act on things in the nearby area (say 40-45 meters at max) such as breaking leftover pallets from the chase I just had, breaking gens, or checking for a survivor I may have recently seen in the area. This may take me 30 seconds give or take at which point if there’s nothing that requires my immediate attention I’ll go back to briefly check on the hooked survivor (may linger for a little bit if I have reason to believe someone is close by) and if no one’s there then I’ll leave to go check gens and find someone else.

Most of the time however, I leave for a few seconds and someone runs over for the save, meaning I come back right as the guy gets unhooked and he gets downed straightaway. There are a few factors that go into it but depending on how merciful I’m feeling, how the game’s going, is he death hook, etc. I may rehook him and then pursue the rescuer or leave him on the ground and chase the rescuer immediately. 
---
Tunneling can go hand in hand with camping, and if it is then as I’ve said it’s best to just crank gens while the killer sits there, bc if you go for a save you’re only helping the killer. Tunneling where the killer isn’t camping just means that a poor save was made or the unhooked survivor ran off and got spotted by the killer fairly quickly. Either way, how effective tunneling is is determined by the survivors, and while camping isn’t really fun tunneling is pretty much just the killer doing his job, you can’t always make a save right next to him and expect him to go for the more difficult target, or expect a killer to purposely ignore an injured survivor who runs into them after getting unhooked. 
---
For perspective, just as gen rushing is now more so the killer being bad at map pressure rather than survivors being unfair, tunneling is more so survivors making bad plays rather than the killer being unfair. I don’t expect anyone to stop doing gens when I’m getting looped or making poor plays on my end, and you won’t always run into killers that will let you make mistakes so you can have your fun, it just is what it is. 
---
Hope that helps even if it got a little... blunt at the end there.
---
Thanks for the clarification.  I was kinda confused reading some comments on the patch notes. 
---
that's not a bad totem spot, if someone doesn't spawn there
---
I tried LF through a splinter. He's so dull, that even BBQ doesn't seem worth. I think I'll pass for now
---
Legion is the most boring character to play and play against. Plus many people DC when they see legion to boycott his character.
---
The deep wound timer can be very BS if you "lose" a chase on purpose to make it tick down. Plus his power literally guarantees a hit with little to no skill, so there is almost no counterplaying. Honestly I just kind of hate his whole existence LMAO.
---
No, doing a gen with 2 people instead of 1 is still faster for that gen than having just 1 person on it.
---
What changed is that each extra person does not add 100 percent more efficiency. So to kind of illustrate how it is now:
---
1 person = 100 percent efficiency 
---
2 people = 190 percent 
---
and so on
---
In the past it was
---
2 people = 200 percent
---
The way it is now is how it was always supposed to be and the devs just finally fixed that bug
---
*but* it's generally better, and really always has been, to spread out and work on gens. Teaming up becomes the better plan later in the game
---
Yah, and that’s barely a second difference if even, so you’re still pretty solid with your build :)
---
I was thinking 'bout Myers. TY for the suggestion :)
---
Hey, thanks! And yeah, kinda. It's still done much faster, but you lose a little efficiency, it's something like 80 seconds to solo a gen, and like 44 if you double up.
---
I'm pretty sure it's been that way for a while, it just never showed that it's giving a small penalty before this patch.
---
What if the wraith has a carillon instead of the bell? Imagine uncloaking and the sound of the carillon starts playing right behind you. I never thought about wraith’s sound cosmetics but they would be really cool imo
---
Prior to release, they wanted to keep the game interesting for other players, so they did rush swf only a but after release, with not much of anything in mind. Fortunately they got enough people playing that they were able to realise the first dlcs (the nurse) for free.
---
Yeah I'm going to have to agree with this guy. I have never had a problem, so insulting devs that know a lot more about the complications of computer development than you do is a kinda an a-hole move. Trying troubleshooting techniques like completely reinstalling, or changing install drive or location.
---
I think Spirit's version of the cut looks cute normally, but I guess I would agree it probably takes away from her character's appeal and aesthetic. It probably doesn't help that her hair can barely keep it together.
---
I've been playing since around release and have never had an update break my game.
---
Nah, they should decrease the cost of bloodwebs or make more campaigns like half the price bloodweb instead of a 3 day long bloodhunt that can be countered with DCs and crashes
---
Are you agreeing or disagreeing, there is no failing blinks unless they add "blinkbot"
---
I wasn't saying it doesn't slow the game down. I was saying more people on one gen completes that gen faster than one person soloing it. you arent losing seconds on the gen, you're marginally slowing the game down. 1 person per gen repairs at 100% efficency (with no debuff) 2 people each work at 90% repair speed. but that's 2 people totaling 180% repair speed, which is faster than 1 person on a gen at 100%. and it increases from there. 3 people repair at 80% which totals 240% repair speed and 4 people @70% totaling 280%. Where it slows the game down is the more focus you have on one generator, the less generator coverage you have. And if you factor in buffs like tool boxes with BNP, in a (completely unrealistic) perfect game, a 4 man gen can be done in 10 seconds. Obvisouly that wouldn't happen, but the point still stands. Your personal repair speed goes down but everyone's individual repair speed per gen stacks. Besides, I was mostly going at that dude because he sounds like a know-it-all asshole.
---
yup but I think the program they used or maybe still use is Reshade, at least, i think that is the program.  Not sure if its green lighted by EAC though
---
This is a really cool idea! But I think this would still lead to complaints. People hate how his dream mechanic works. The fact that you have to wait to pull a survivor into dream state before you can even hit them will always make Freddy weak and/or annoying to play. The aura reading is also a questionable feature that gets complaints.
---
I love your username. Lana is queen. 
---
I can think of no better way to derank than going off to make grilled cheese.
---
But it’s worth it
---
I am a purple rank killer and I get messages about 50% of the games I play. Especially if I manage to kill any red rank players. They are so toxic and entitled. 
---
That's right. Don't claim shit you know is false. And if you still dumb emough to believe yo dumbass true, look at karmadecay.com. Dumbass. 
---
It subtracts the ability to project your imagination on the characters. If they assigned sexuality to all the characters there’d be no more gay David or any of the other memes. It’s just like overwatch adding a family to reapers backstory, it doesn’t add or subtract anything but the ability to think up your own backstory.

Nah, I'm cool getting less bloodpoints as a survivor.
---
Killers addons are always lost during matches (or they burn a ward for it). 
---
Survivors that escape keep their items/addons.  So there is always the potential.  I often have expensive maps or toolboxes stick around with me for 6+ maps.
---
Survivors can also generate new items and addons by looting chests.  If you make sure to always loot a chest before exiting you get an extra 3k bloodpoints worth of stuff at minimum.  Bring Ace in the Hole and it could be worth more then the killer gets for the whole match.
---
The killer HAS to stay for the entire match, while survivors that die/escape can immediately re-enter queue.  So you cant always compare their bp.
---
DC's do funky things to a killers bloodpoints too.
---
And lastly.. Killer is a lot more stressful then survivor.  I rarely do as much to deserve my bloodpoint gain as a survivor.
---
I would just do a flat 1000bp reduction to things in the blood web. 
---
Pc player for life, and i’ve not gotten salt at all, no matter what. I 4K most of my games as well (Tryhard Nurse and Billy) And nothing.
---
I just got the game a couple days ago and this was absolutely me the first time I faced Michael. I was sitting there thinking "this guy's an idiot" and I wasn't prepared for him getting that speed boost and an instadown
---
I started at 20 because i hadnt played in a long while and now i’m around green-purple. All through the ranks i’m getting nothing.
---
maybe move the aura reading until tier 2 
---
tier 1- no aura reading but still in dream world
---
tier 2- aura reading from certain distance
---
tier 3- exposed
---
these only apply to each individual survivor depending on how many times he/she has been pulled into a dream. like the movies sometimes they survive the dream but start to fear Freddy even more.
---
Id be ok if made it so you could get grab 2 perks on a web vs the 1 we have now.  So the web would start with 3 and the entity would claim one and leave the other 2 options for you.
---
You've made your point that the beginning of DbD's grind was truly worse than today's grind. Still doesn't change how bad today's grind is.
---
I was poking fun at people who are like "but you never see good survivors!" When someone brings up how powerful they can be.
---
I AM VERY GLAD YOU TOLD ME GETTING HIT WHILE THE KILLER IS FACING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION IS A NEW MECHANIC. I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME KIND OF WONKY HITBOX, BAD PING, OR SOMETHING.
---
Max is me AF.
---
Not the normal skill checks, no. Just BNP.
---
But wouldn’t it be better to use it on the person he’s stalking since he can only stalk a survivor for so long before they stop leveling up his Evil Within?
---
Personally, I've always said don't let totems spawn until they're in use. 
---
Like Ruin doesn't spawn until someone touches a generator. Huntress Lullaby doesn't spawn until someone's hooked (also don't think that survivors' should get a notification when it's active, given it should grow increasingly obvious that it exists.) Third Seal doesn't spawn until someone gets hit. Devour Hope doesn't spawn until someone is unhooked. The only ones that would spawn at the beginning of the match as hex totems would be thrill of the hunt and haunted grounds. 
---
If that seems to powerful, maybe a small noise notification if someone is within six meters of a totem that just activated? I don't know. The new hiding spots are definitely more helpful, but in time, people will memorize them as well, and it'll be the same problem. (But then, that's always somewhat been the risk-reward balance of hexes, so.)
---
Pure sexual energy
---
People play killer more because survivor point gen sucks -&gt; buff survivor point gen
---
Survivors are BP thirsty -&gt; because point gen sucks on survivor -&gt; buff survivor point gen
---
Both of those issues could be easily solved with a survivor point gen buff.
---
Have an upvote - I agree that UE is overrated. It has it uses sometimes when juking the killer. 
---
More often than not, I'm on the hook and there is a Claudette Urbanly Evading in the corner of the map looking for the hatch when everyone is still alive.
---
Just play killer, problem solved. You should be looking at guides and things about what perks to get anyways if youre actually into the game and if you dont care that much and only play a game here or there then perks dont matter to you anyways.
---
I actually really like this idea more than mine. Makes complete sense!
---
To rub salt in the wound even further, that Dwight didn't get the memo and is running leader, so Adam will cleanse it even faster
---
Or perhaps increase the max amount of bloodpoints in a game to something like 40000 while increasing BP gains just a little bit.
---
I dont see how this is an issue. If you really care about killers perks as a new player you can go to google and look it up.
---
Allow me to introduce you to my good friend Kindred. 
---
&gt;the 360% repair speed for 4 survivors on a gen,
---
The repair speed for 4 survivors on a gen without any perks is 280%, not 360%.
---
The penalty each survivor gets is `10% * number of other survivors on the gen`
---
So with four survivors on a generator *each* survivor gets a 30% penalty. Meaning they're each working at 70% efficiency for a total of 280%.
---
[Source](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators#Efficiency_Penalty)
---
Sick of seeing pointless posts on here.
---
This happened to me too!!!  
---
I was playing Legion in the swamp and found a Kate going into a chest!  I tried to grab her off the chest, but then we were both stuck for about 10 seconds.  Kate Disappeared in front of me, with the Icon saying that she is Injured and needs Mending.  But I killed the other 3 and that was the end of the game!
---
BBQ is not OP at all. Give me a break.
---
But the text of bnp says 15% + 5% for each skill check. Multiplied by 4 survivors is 100%
---
So why are there normal skill checks?
---
I feel like that would be a little bit difficult to keep track of, and I think becoming exposed after the third time being pulled in is a bit too strong. Not to mention the fact that this just encourages tunneling, which I think should be avoided.
---
You mentioned Myer's Evil Within meter and I think that you're on to something with that. Maybe every time you pull someone in, or have people in the dream world, it gives progress on a collective meter, and when it ranks up the dream world becomes harder to escape, making skill checks more rare, or requiring multiple failed skill checks in order to wake up. Maybe also increasing the duration of the wake up action from other players, and maybe even eventually disabling it. This would encourage pulling as many people into the dream world as possible, instead of just keeping a single person trapped. It would also increase his power as the game goes on, which goes along with the theme set by his perks.
---
Salty survivors screwing over their team mate by disconnecting?
---
~~Legion, I assume.~~
---
I just wish survival BP was easier to obtain to max out, otherwise bp gain for survivors is fine in my book.
---
Thank you.
---
So far I've only had good interactions with this community, and in the game itself.
---
Glad to be part of it.
---
What a shitty website to upload that on. Just why?
---
It's not even that loud. you must have your game and headsets set high asf.
---
I’m tired of spending 40% of the game holding down M1 just to get hit right after and have to do it again. I’d actually PREFER if mending had skillchecks so I’m not so god damn bored.
---
Last thing red rank survivors need is a reward, since they seem to be the most toxic bunch in the game - But that's just my salt. 
---
I wanna watch this episode of Jimmy Neutron again to see who these Jimmy's are.  From Left to Right, I can only Guess Cool Jimmy, Evil Jimmy, Pedo Jimmy, Emo Jimmy, Ace Jimmy, and 2nd Pedo Jimmy xD
---
I'm not arguing against a point buff, more that I would prefer it be a buff to the actual generation (like +10% BP for all survivor actions) and not a timed event which would encourage farming.
---
Farming discourages play for some = less BP = issue is patched up some but not fixed.
---
I'd like to play this game, I don't want to risk having ass games that end in 5 minutes where I spend most of it sensually dangling off a hook and praying I got my tetanus shot.
---
Legion is way more out of place. I'm not scared of some skinny albeit speedy teenagers when David can break their spine in half with a glance.
---
THATS RACIST
---
Since 2.0 nurse has evolved to not have legs. Only omega
---
Basically people has seen that with the right addons and/or the moonwalk thing is kinda broken. Also most of the people say that is impossible to lose him and if he want to down you chasing you for 5 minutes until you bleedout he can 
---
Dude has a well defined six pack! (please make him a bit chunkier and hairier, dude does nothing but drink and he has the thickest beard I have ever seen)
---
Not necessarily.
---
How are we salty? Would you rather us derank to green ranks and bully new killers? Red ranks are just the best players even if it's easy to get there. Or r u saying to be good u have to be toxic? 
---
&gt; but now's it's fast AF.
---
Its the same speed as the previous patch, gens are not being done faster than before, **its impossible**
---
Let me paste you the critical thing youre missing from this patch:
---
*Fixed an issue with generator repair efficiency for multiple Survivors working on the same generator. The efficiency debuff (-10%) should now be applied at the correct rate.*
---
Prove thyself removes the efficiency debuff, debuff that wasnt working in previous patches.
---
If you dont trust me, trust the devs (its already timestamped) -&gt; https://youtu.be/fv340yni8Xg?t=3646
---
Claudette's probably pretty good with kids, actually.
---
People exaggerate. A lot. Nobody ever gets toxicity “EVERY FUCKING GAME”
---
Everyone else just doesn’t post about it because it’s not that huge of an issue. (PC)
---
I PLAYED THIS GAME OVER THE FREE WEEKEND AND LOVED EVERY SECOND OF PLAYING SURVIVOR WITH MY FRIEND. WE BOUGHT THE GAME AND WE ONLY SURVIVE 10% OF GAMES NOW THAT WE'RE PLAYING AGAINST NON-FREE WEEKEND KILLERS. WHY AM I SO BAD AT THIS GAME
---
Myers is in my opinion, one of the best designed characters in the game. Really unique play style that encourages that "staring at you as you shower through the bathroom window" kind of play style. I think they did a really good job with him. He's also a really solid character in his own right without being broken.
---
So it kinda boils down to how they play and what they're running. 
---
xD
---
Weirdly enough my last couple games have been three females and Ace every time lol
---
Ace can get it, apparently. 
---
I mean, it is probably the best perk in the game, bar none. For killers, the only one that even approaches it is BBQ.
---
It is a bug. For me it happened with ruin.
---
also a good idea as well, tiers should definitely be involved in a Freddy rework.
---
never thought I'd see the day where there is someone nice playing this game
---
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT THE BUFF WOULD HAVE MADE FRANK'S MIXTAPE SUPER BROKEN AND THE BUFF WAS TOO MUCH OVERALL.
---
SO INSTEAD OF WORKING ON SOMETHING ELSE THEY JUST SCRAPPED IT ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE EFF LEGION, APPARENTLY.
---
If they didn't do it for Christmas and the holidays, I don't imagine so. Maybe Black Friday, but even then I doubt it. 
---
no
---
Debuff that wasnt working on previous patches, so basically survivors are running 1 less perk LUL
---
INSTANT NUT!
---
That's weird, I find green and purple more toxic. Most rank 1 games end with 5 GG and no flaming lol. At least every game I've played for the last 6 or 7 hours have. Sometimes the minority of a group get the most attention, so that must be what u r talking about. The loudest isnt always the majority or right. 
---
Dam that's filthy. I like playing legion and there's been a couple "how TF" moments but I didn't think much of it. That sucks that people would actually do that.
---
I mean seriously? Is it impossible to put a check for distance to nearest gen, or line of sight to nearest gen? Really been thinking about the idea of totems just staying unlit and I think it could be an awesome fix to this problem.
---
"Doesn't remove chance, it just guarantees"
---
That's not how chance works.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
I didnt say I didnt have any time, I said I have little free time to myself. Not everyone has this ton of time to wait for matches to end so you can see the load out you went up against. It's a legitimate complaint. Next time learn to read kid. ^^
---
True I would have to agree with that 
---
This is why I run Discordance on all my killers. 
---
&gt; WHY AM I SO BAD AT THIS GAME
---
BECAUSE IT HAS A PRETTY LARGE LEARNING CURVE. SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP YOU IS WATCHING YT VIDEOS ON HOW TO LOOP DIFFERENT STRUCTURES 
---
Pretty shure it worked to some extend. The main thing that came with this patch is just that the progress bar actually turns red
---
I thought the exit gate was locked when you had a trap on?
---
They didn't change repair speed. Now bar is red to indicate the debuff that was already there in previous patches.
---
Dwah ty :)
---
People don't need incentivizing. Survivors are finding lobbies much faster right now, the is a surplus of killers. 
---
I will concede the addons loss point though, maybe reduce the cost of them specifically? Have you got an add on for every cheesy opened in a match? 
---
Idk, survivors need a point gen buff either way.
---
people just need to get gud lmfao
---
RIP
---
same tbh
---
you’re very strong and we all love you, dont let toxicity of this community ever stop u from loving it. much luv
---
I know, he was my second pick! Plus, I really like Overcharge, so getting PGTW is a must. I will think about it more, TY!
---
Dont need to moonwalk, just look down, way easier and it breaks a game mechanic called chasing
---
Man I hope I get you guys for survivors, free blood points for me when you ragequit lol
---
decent idea :O
---
Yeah that's interesting. I'll be honest though, I hate playing against the doctor.
---
In Scream 2 the killer morphs his voice into other characters, maybe they could have some ability that makes survivors think he's someone else. 
---
The program most use is Nvidia Freestyle.
---
Streamers can also alter the stream colour for viewers using OBS filters but they will see it normally on their screen.
---
same, but during the time I played last year I couldn't find a game without it 
---
That's not a response but alrighty
---
Thought i opened a zombies post. 
---
Well the holiday doesn't start till February. It's definitely January 29th for a start date
---
I play on PS4 which might explain the difference in experience. The farthest I've gotten in rank is 3 as killer, and O-M-G it was a cess pool. 
---
I have all the killers.
---
I still get them.
---
hey this is inappropriate dabbing is naughty 😡
---
yeah, keep pretending it's a zero sum game, kid.
---
you just need to find your play style and if it fits for legion then you should definitely give him a go, or look for an offering to try him out and make your decision after
---
unluko then
---
A big issue is just how easy it is to wake up. I think it should only be done by teammates. Freddys whole deal is literally killing you in your sleep so I don’t think he should lose his effect just cuz you are on the hook. The dream world tracking is horrible design. Get rid of the dream world tracking and add in a hallucination thing. Make Freddy scary and make screaming his way of tracking. End game idk how to fix. Maybe hits by Freddy do not give that sprint burst or something could be tested. Just some suggestions I like along with your idea
---
I mean Colored Icons for Offerings maybe I wasn't very explicit in my post sorry.
---
I saved 700K and got my piggith go level 31 T_T
---
i'm sorry that you genuinely think this is a good idea.
---
may reddit have mercy on your soul.
---
Like I said In someone else's comment that's just filthy. Shame that it came to this. 
---
its to find out when you're already started match i know this 
---
that would be so funny lmfao
---
And toxic
---
not happened to me
---
riperoni
---
Unlikely since the devs value the BP economy so much for literally no reason.
---
It shows up before the match even starts. When you have the option to ready up their name will be there 
---
But at that point that gen would’ve finished already with 4 survivors... probably only cutting a couple of seconds :/
---
ok , do you know how to close this post now?
---
That's the only reason I want him. I saw many playstyles, most of them not even running Frank's Mixtape, that looked pretty fun. Tru3's build looked nice and Thanatophobia looked great on him
---
If survivors got as many as killer I don’t think people would play killer. I play killer if I’m solo and I play survivor when I’m playin with my friends currently and I think it works out. Yes I’m getting a quarter or half the points as I do with killer but I’m also doing half the work because my teammates are also doing some of it 
---
You're dismissing that it's annoying for solos to have to wait if they want to see the load out. Idk why you have to argue that fact. That's why you're being downvoted :^)  
---
I'm consistently rank 1 killer and survivors, the climbing ranks can be toxic, but once u r rank 1, no one cares about the rank any more. We r all there to play the game, not to prove anything and there is very little toxicity. U see a lot of insta heals and flashlights, but eventually u just look at walls when picking up and just hitting them again after insta heals. Rank really just shows how much u play

&gt; Survivors are finding lobbies much faster right now
---
This is patently untrue.
---
&gt; Idk, survivors need a point gen buff either way.
---
whatever, as long as it's still less than killer on average 
---
Yep
---
As a survivor main, I wouldn’t mind the killer forcing both items to drop upon being hit. 
---
Tbh, I don't really care what the devs intended. We have SWF, so what's it matter if they didn't want communication or they had planned communication? What matters is what's actually happening.
---
I just know the SWF isn't balanced in the slightest. Even if you're just chatting with one another, there will still inevitably be absentminded callouts of 'oh, i'm being chased' or 'oh, the hex is at the shack' which is more helpful than you think. 
---
I play both solo and SWF, and it's far, far easier when you're in a SWF group. I survive near every time when I play SWF, unlike when I play solo, and it's not like we're ultra coordinating or anything. We're just talking. Do I know how to fix the issue? No. Do I recognize that it can be an issue, especially when SWF groups *are* coordinating? Yes. 
---
Like, it's fine, people can enjoy SWF. I do, too. But how can you try and say that the game is balanced with SWF in mind? How can the devs release perks that are directly countered by SWF and try and claim it's balanced that way? It's not. I don't know how to fix it, but even I can admit it can be a problem. 
---
Wait, how? I have NEVER gotten these offerings. I also had all licenced killers from when I first bought the game
---
Na the music is fine I am talking about it being Super loud.. I cant hear the game sounds while getting chased at all.. They should just lower the sound
---
Lucky you.
---
When ever Hag glitches out for me I just get stuck in a tree and have to DC.
---
I just give him EW3 and DC before he can hit me.  EZ game.
---
It used to spawn there.
---
Just grind out points as a killer, BBQ + survivor pudding. Enjoy your 500,000+ bp for 2 hours of work
---
I FEEL YOU I JUST GOT BLOCKED FROM A WIN MYSELF CAUSE OF THAT. LAST GEN GOT DONE ON HADDONFIELD WHILE I WAS BEING CHASED BY THIS HUNTRESS. ONE WAS NEXT TO ME SO I COULDN'T GET THAT ONE. SO I RAN AROUND THE WHOLE MAP DODGING HATCHETS LOOPING PRETTY DECENTLY. SOMEHOW ALIVE I GET TO THE DOOR, THERE'S MY FRIEND, I MADE IT. BOOM! NOED! RIGHT INSIDE THE GATE. I FELT CHEATED. 
---
You are the one whos claiming there are more killers don't ever leave the hook than there are killers who do
---
 Which is an overexaggerated salty and stupid claim to make. So i'm just calling your bs out. No salt included.
---
But nice how you dodged my question, so I'll ask it again
---
At least 6/10 killers do not ever leave the hook?
---
We‘ll make it is a great perk thet literally halfs the time it takes to heal and a lot of survivors run it, same with BN and autodidact although autodidact is rng based.
---
i tried now it dont work on pc  in lobby probably only xbox/ps4
---
Yeah, get spirit. She has some decent perks and her power is very strong, even stronger than clown’s depending on add ons. If you have yakuyoke amulet and wakizashi people put her at Billy tier just because of how strong she is in a chase. A good headset is a must to be a good spirit, according to most spirit mains. 
---
The hag is a reason why I keep my urban as permanent perk.
---
I do this as well. At this point I've already lost and securing that one kill by face camping isn't going to change that. You looped me for ages. Good on you. Now get out of my house.
---
I believe the totem check that they discussed implementing(and did implement) was how survivors would be able to start with the totems directly in their line of sight, and the fix was to prevent that.  Maybe next they will try the generator proximity.
---
More like tonight's big winner, because DC=win
---
Yea but I tried removing them as well. It's just loud af
---
If someone can loop you for that long they outplayed you. What else are survivors supposed to do  in chases? Calm your babyrage and have some tea.
---
I would like the system to be redone from the ground up entirely.
---
It is unbelievably frustrating to not have the perks you want appear in your bloodwebs. Even moreso when the perks that never show up are the character's own perks.
---
Why am I not allowed to select a perk to appear or level up? How would that break anything?
---
Fuck if I know. All I do know is that I get them about every 10th blood web.
---
100% agreed. Sometimes you need to break the chase and go after someone  else.
---
Nah I cant even see whats in front of me without using shadowborn and lowest brightness. We just need this update
---
I'VE HAD 3 GAMES THAT WERE SO ALIKE. I WAS CHASED AROUND FOR THE WHOLE GAME, THEN I POWERED UP SOME GENS AND OPENED GATES. WENT TO SAVE OTHER SURVIVOR BECAUSE I WAS HEARTBROKEN BUT I ALWAYS GOT HIT BY NOED, THEN UP ON THE HOOK AND GET SACRIFICED. ALTRUISM KILLS AND I'M AN IDIOT.
---
THEN THE KILLER PROCEEDS TO SLASH ME LIKE FUCKING STOP YOU BITCH I'M ALREADY GETTING SACRIFICED. 
---
Can someon send me link to new Haddonfield intro? 
---
bye bye clear reagents on my survivors immediately.
---
Simply put, there is no counterplay to legion and he completely removes any skill from chases which is the majority of the reason most people play the game in the first place. 
---
Then you take the addons, Franks mixtape and cold dirt, and not only is the killer incredibly unfun but also very op.
---
Ruin, Huntess lullaby, BBQ &amp; Chili, and monitor and abuse.. Currently rank 8 killer. I play survivor mostly
---
Lol I tot only mine did that.
---
Frank's mixtape, stab wound studies, and moon walking are pretty much what makes them unfun to play against. 
---
If the legion is just chasing normally while using their frenzy attacks to lower your bar and down you they actually have counterplay 
---
I think the scariest thing here is the idea of walking barefoot across those filthy convention center floors.  Have you know fear?!
---
This hullabaloo over Prove Thyself is just overblown.  They have reduced the rate of two people working on gens from 1.95 to 1.9, so you're really not getting much of a boost (only about 10%).  The real change is going to be when the healing changes take effect.
---
And why does this post need to exist?
---
I said lowish, because the easiest thing to use his chainsaw for is quick map mobility, and that's not difficult at all
---
BTW I HATE LERY'S AS A KILLER BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CROWS EVERY STEP I TAKE, FUCKING CAW CAW CAW I CAN'T HEAR SHIT BECAUSE OF YOU. 
---
I might come more into play now since hook spawning has been changed quite a lot.
---
If they can just build a base server this will be better for us I guess..
---
Can someone specify what the two perks are?  I play killer but have no teachables.
---
Right behind the huntress right leg you can actually see her shoes. She took them off for the pictures. 
---
Oh shed how do you even play.
---
Also I dont think that would change the lag caused because of Servers of the game..
---
Wait until the next bloodweb.
---
Clown is underrated asf. Solid playstyle, not to mention pop goes the weasel and bamboozle being great perks. Get the big boi. 
---
I like to, but it never seems to help my matches. 
---
I also use the perk that breaks hooks when i get unhooked. 
---
&gt;Play video
---
&gt;Immediately hear ear-pain inducing yelling
---
&gt;Pause Video
---
&gt;Dislike
---
I can never get those 5 seconds back.
---
nah
---
I put hag at low because trapping totems and popular loops isn't a difficult thing to do, and most of the skill comes from knowing how and when to teleport.
---
Spirit, though, is a more difficult case. Since the haunting is easy to understand, but very difficult to master
---
Only survival Bp needs a rework maybe points for wiggle? 
---
gg baby killer lul 2 ez
---
Pretty cool cosplays. 
---
I'd love to see someone do the hillbilly
---
Only time sabotage came into play was with my SWF group. One on killer's shoulder, two taking hits, one with a purple toolbox and saboteur on the hook. It worked, but that's so situational that it certainly won't at any other point. 
---
deranking is always worth it
---
Looping is not toxic. It is in fact what survivors are supposed to do so they can occupy the killer's time while their team does generators.
---
Don't know what that other guy is talking about.
---
Because I wanted it to? Why does your comment need to exist?
---
It would be a zero sum game if this got implemented, thank you for seeing things my way.
---
You're right, survivors just don't get enough value out of sabo anymore. That said, I don't disagree with BHVR's decision to leave the mechanic in the state that it's in since it's such a difficult mechanic to balance. If the break time is too long then killers could find themselves with no way to hook the survivors that they do down, which isn't fun for them. If the break speed is too fast then sabo'ing hooks doesn't detract enough from doing generators and doesn't slow the game down enough for the killer.
---
It's just too fine a line for balancing, so if they leave the mechanic in an under-powered state, then at least there's another playstyle out there for survivors to have fun with that also isn't unfun for killers.
---
That said I'm seeing Jeff's Breakdown perk getting a decent amount of use, which makes me think that the mechanic might better be suited to cropping up in other future perks. 
---
Think something like "rescuing a survivor from a hook weakens it so that the next survivor put on that same hook can choose to when to break it and pull themselves down (basement hooks would be immune to the effect)". This could even help with some of the camping issues I here people complaining so much about if you force the killer to make a choice between repeatedly hooking survivors in his favorite corner and risking the escape, or to hedge against the perk and hook them in a less defensible spot.
---
I mean it is Dead by daylight. The game is all grind. The more you play the more you are gonna rank up.
---
Left is surveillance (pig perk) right is discordance (legion perk)
---
Hag’s power effectiveness doesn’t come from trapping totems and popular loops. It comes from knowing all the different ways you can position your traps in every loop, and know what to choose at the right time. Hag’s traps have lots of effects when triggered, and you need to learn how to use them at their max potential in each loop. I agree with spirit though 
---
&gt;jojo
---
&gt;obscure
---
Hmmmm
---
He's only counterplay is to stun him when he is in frenzy then beg for mercy.
---
“Haha how the fuck is dying even real lmao just run away what the fuck”
---
[I STILL HATE THAT WE CAN'T DENY UNHOOKS. IT WOULD SOLVE A LOT PROBLEMS AND MAKE THE GAME LESS FRUSTRATING](/intensifies)
---
That was my fiancé. He doesn't play as Claudette. I think he was Meg 
---
Lol I like this idea but this is not a harmless goofy game thus it will never happen 😂
---
I agree? It takes some skill and/or brains and/or luck to do well (pip) as killer at rank 1. As survivor, all it takes is the shred of luck required to not get tunneled and caught first/early. 
---
Oh yeah.! I have all killers purchased and leveled to at least to 40 for teachables. I’ve actually been playing him a TON and I find myself enjoying ruin, bbq, bloodhound and sloppy.. and i will usually only play him if i have a franklin’s mixtape. 
---
I can agree to that, of course it wont be every single game, but there were a few games i deliberately did something to see if it would trigger the salt (Once i straight up put 5 traps around the shack with the UR coil and fast setting with Trapper) and after that game i got 4 GG’s
---
Found the Brit 
---
or you could um run a map and small game and locate every totem, it's a chore but you get 600 points each dull you take out. 
---
While I defiantly don’t have the appropriate “fix” idea for the problem, I’d still like the feature to be played up more in the game. Because like I said, it feels like such a waste of a toolbox and time, and even worse if you’re only using the perk, to the point where it’s just unused. 
---
Interesting. Pc or console?
---
lmfao no it would not
---
good god
---
Would 1 person with leader slightly speed this up? Idk whats happening here really total conjecture 
---
DCing is an insta-loss.
---
Folk that consider it a kind of victory baffle me.
---
it's all a trap, remember me comes into play 
---
So your basically saying because I have 100 thousand karma I repost? And none of my posts that are currently up are reposts. Nice try. 
---
Holy fuck why did I never think of using that
---
Get Spirit with the new moe outfit. It's so worth it
---
No. imagine 4 survs throwing and you get a 20! second stun. survs are strong enough.
---
I’d be ok with it if a killers weapon did the same
---
Devs said it was not working -&gt; https://youtu.be/fv340yni8Xg?t=3646
---
This is the correct answer. Too many bitches whine about changes to the game- Legion is a worse version of Freddy. If you die to him, you deserve it.
---
I do realize that. I'm just stating that it's more of a Left 4 Dead cosplay. That's not a bad thing, and from the looks of it he did an incredible job.

Don't worry, it just not ready yet. (cries) :C

I’d just wish totems didn’t spawn right in the los of gens.

BNP does that 15% over a short time, not at once, which is why it took longer than 5 seconds

Hannibal Lecter and Clarice

When this happens too many times in row I put on Deliverance. I had 2 games in a row where no one came to save me till I was well into struggle it's like seriously killer ain't even camping me lol soooo, needless to say FU I'll save myself
---
you cant know if they are a facecamper
---
Nah survivors should get a gun to shoot the killer’s head and each survivor can have a max of 6 shots. If one of the shots of one survivor hits the head of the killer he fuckijg dies and survivors mori him until he dc’s
---
There are only 3 different sections for cosmetics, this is a highly un-needed amount of coding.
---
BBQ SUCKS at high rank tho lol 
---
Crank that Haddonfield theme up to 11, my dudes. That's my jam!
---
run both and you have ultimate map control. I got called a cheater once because of it lol.
---
Okay.
---
Eh, most of that stuff I don't care about. I'm more into stuff that matters.
---
But you should remove cloud saves from the Steam side...at least until Dark Souls 3 has it.
---
on this day a dark patch was made
---
Playing suboptimally doesn't mean they are garbage. I'm just saying that Discordance forces survivors to play like they are supposed to be playing anyway, a perk that can be countered by playing more optimally..
---
Honestly, I think double frenzy recovery addons is just as good or better than Frank’s Mixtape. If he catches you anywhere that isn’t extremely safe you can’t avoid getting downed and it’s MUCH faster than with Franks’s or the bloodtrail cheese. 
---
Yup. I think I have around 200 now across all the killers I play.
---
As a hell of a good Spirit I will never run out of M/D Rings now.
---
And now, even better, fucking sound is back.
---
Last night was fucking orgasmic and I can guarantee that the survivors did not have fun at all. lol

In addition to these changes; Freddy eats the Entity and now becomes the demon god of the fog.  Survivors can no longer run if they look upon the Nightmare, they just bend over and pull down their pants with anticipation. 
---
I KIND OF WISH I TRIED OUT THIS GAME DURING FREE WEEKEND, I SAW MY LITTLE BROTHER PLAYING IT THROUGH A STEAM NOTIFICATION AND BEGAN WATCHING MONTO VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS
---
I USUALLY HATE SCARY GAMES LIKE THIS BUT THIS SHIT LOOKS KIND OF DOPE YO, I WANNA SNEAK AROUND LIKE A LITTLE BITCH AS A SURVIVOR WITH NINJA PERKS AND THEN JUST RUN AROUND LIKE A DERP THROWING PEOPLE DOWN HATCHES AS KILLER
---
I think it would be wiser to take the opinion of someone with a few thousand hours instead of fucking 300 LMFAO
---
man i said if i know the killer and i would face him again in lobby i would just leave why u keep asking like u dont understand?
---
I did happen once when the glitch allows 2 killers in the same match. So, ppl are no wrong for having some hope...
---
And then someone comes to you, but you hit struggle phase a split second before they unhook you.
---
Is the pig a boy....? 
---
so true LMFAO!!! ROFL!!! *DAB* 
---
Please shut up, the adults are talking.
---
No need to feel sorry lol, just reminded me of it
---
preach
---
I like the idea, but photophobia should be a cool down perk, due to the fact that you could use this perk on someone like Legion and completely stop generator progress until 3 have died. Kinda unfair, but with a timer, like 40/60/80, it’d be more balanced. It shouldn’t be a hex, because then it’d just be the same ol thing where it gets taken out too fast
---
Not as the killer.

take a look hun. also that kitten pic you posted has a watermark. just saying
---
Maybe the back of thr offering is of another color?
---
I believe that is the offering used by the killer, as it is the last one but I'm not sure.
---
True, Legion could easily destroy people with this perk :b
---
wake up claudette, WAKE UP!!

Lmfao

I aporove this.

Do it then. I don't repost.

Well, I want to play a game, not to set my team up for a defeat because of achievement
---
I'm new here, what is the hope for a freddy rework like what do people want?
---
Outstanding move
---
Downing within two uses of Frenzy is going to be faster than downing in three uses of Frenzy, even with increased recovery.
---
I rather to have better totem spots.
---
Upcoming patch confirmed: 
---
Killers are no longer see survivor’s name, appearances, and holding items. For avoiding lobby dodge.

there were 2 other people in the match when they were leaving, so she couldn't get to the end screen THAT fast

Class Photo addon for those like me, who didn't know it from memory:

A large photograph taken at Badham Preschool showing the cheerful class of 94-95.
---
When a Survivors is pulled into the Dream Transition, all other Survivors' Auras are revealed to you for the duration of the Dream Transition.
---
Tremendously increases the Dream Transition. Time to fall asleep increased by 2 seconds.
---
They can't ever put anything in the game without breaking 5 other things smh
---
Oh I thought you were being sarcastic 😂 so I thought this was genuinely funny.
---
V BELIEVABLE /S
---
That 10 seconds is the best possible scenario for survivors. Yeah when it happens it sucks but that’s gonna be 1 out of every 50 of your games. 
---
if you think deleting your post gets you out of this you are mad delusional hun. click on that link again and you'll still see that bot outting your username for reposting. nice try sweet xx stay in school
---
And you can see what items a survivor has once you found them, your point? If killers can see our items we should be able to see their perks once we die. Also no one said anything about snitching killers’ perks. I’m talking about SOLO survivors. We got shafted for no reason.
---
As /u/angelbosom mentioned, bottles are really for zoning. Always think about herding the survivor with your bottles. Make them take the long way around something or punish for taking a shortcut while you are taking the most direct path. Also, bottles are good for pulling survivors out of hiding but it won't effect them if they're in a locker. 
---
Awesome story. But the guy said it is OP, not it was OP
---
The Alien actually looks humanoid enough that it has a chance of getting onto the game
---
The best part about it was it wasn’t asked for and they love us enough to put it in anyway
---
Jason is slasher daddy tho.
---
I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW SCRATCHMARKS BREAK SOMETIMES. 
---
LIKE SOMETIMES THEY WON'T APPEAR ON THE FLOOR, OR THEY'LL GO IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN THE SURVIVOR.
---
Nobody said the replacement items had to be ultra rare. For example, you could make it so that the replacement has random rarity, but can't be better than the original item. Then recycling would be a net "loss" on average.
---
I honestly like the hair. It looks like it was forcibly cut 
---
FUCK THE KILLER WHO FAILED TO GET ANY OF MY TEAM BECAUSE I TOOK A HIT FOR MY TEAMMATE AT THE END ALLOWING US BOTH TO ESCAPE THEN HE MESSAGED ME SAYING HE REPORTED ME FOR BODY BLOCKING! I DIDN’T BODY BLOCK, I PROTECTED MY TEAMMATE WHOM YOU WERE PUPPYGUARDING ON THE HOOK LIKE A LITTLE BITCH! GET GOOD SCRUB!
---
Uh no. Class photo is very powerful as is and I don’t think it needs to a part of his base power. I know he needs any sort of buff but we have his rework coming up soon. Besides, increasing dream transition time is not always good. I, like some Freddy players, don’t like longer transition times. Yes, the fact that you can reveal ALL survivors auras is very powerful, but I’m not a huge fan of it. 
---
What is the current consensus?  Do people believe he is OP or too weak or just plain not fun but neither?
---
I played as him and got completely wrecked and played against him and had no clue how to stop him so I'm probably not good enough to have an opinion about the matter. 
---
Awesome thank you guys for the replies! Also if any of you have it for ps4 id love to play with yall!
---
The fact that he downed Claudette instead of Pearl 😭
---
Damn it! I just p3'd her, but I love this cosmetic 😩
---
The thing is that the killer already has the advantage in finding the hatch. The only problem is that once the standoff starts the killer has no control when they should have some. 
---
Haha ya same here
---
When I warp with the Nurse it's super cool af but when she gets exhausted I am confused af because she looks down for so long :(
---
"If you're good you can't be counterplayed" isn't really an argument it's an assertion expressed as fact. For what it's worth. It for sure doesn't serve as much of an entryway to discussion, I can't blame him for being uninterested in continuing.
---
People say nurse has no counter play too, does that make it fact? Nope.
---
It does the 15% over the 5 seconds, though maybe it takes longer than 5 seconds after starting for both skill checks to be hit.
---
I never thought I needed a drag race/DBD crossover until now
---
People don't play Legion that way because it's not reliable in the slightest.
---
Hitting a survivor gives them enough of a speed boost to get to a pallet or window, since decent survivors will *always* be making a beeline for the nearest obstacle.
---
It can work, but as with many things in this game it only works if survivors fuck up.
---
Also, "power recovery" is the Ruler add ons (time to recharge). 
---
You're referring to "CD" (fatigue), or Cold Dirt. The Add ons have terrible names, but yeah.
---
The screams are what had me dying 😂😂😂😂
---
What? You aren't making any sense. You want to recycle a yellow item for a brown one? 
---
No only one is active at a time for the gen
---
Here I was thinking I’d go a whole day without seeing this damn post
---
They didnt take off their mask so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lol.
---
Right but it says 10% for each survivor, so does that apply to every survivor
---
the Dwight is not running? 
---
just kidding, its amazing :D (this nurse is scary O-o)
---
Im sure people are glad the Legion was buffed.
---
Bill is my favorite Dead by Daylight survivor.

---
&gt; Not sure if its green lighted by EAC though
---
It's whitelisted according to [their website.](https://www.easy.ac/en-us/support/robocraft/guides/whitelist/)
---
No
---
Yeah, Cold Dirt and Joey’s Mixtape say cooldown duration in their descriptions, but in actuality they make it so the recovery period between frenzy ending and being able to swing again much shorter. Hence, recovery, not regeneration of the power meter. They should prolly work on their tooltips. 
---
The survivors speed boost doesn’t matter, the first swing has little recovery animation, your frenzy is fully recharged, and you will catch back up to the survivor before the bar drains. 
---
I find the playstyle highly consistent, I’ve gotten a ton of 4Ks with it, mostly because it allows you to rapidly down people. 
---
https://youtu.be/Pf1qiyt4nO0
---
Here’s a link to Monto playing the build. He finds his first survivor at 2:46 if you wanna just skip to the gameplay. The first game is kind of a stomp. 
---
if that happened, I would probably die
---
Lmao I cant believe this! I’m living for these RPDR/DBD Crossovers ! 
---
THEY REPAIRED ALL 5 GENERATORS IN LIKE 3 MINS GOD DAMN I DIDN’T EVEN GET ANY HITS

sad to think we were LIVING while dwights were dying 💔

nah just gotta find a pallet near by. Gotta hope she finds you in a warehouse or shipping yard lol.

Freddy Rework offloaded to Identity V :P
---
(Next Hunter is a Dream Monster)
---
ugh, i know, it feels amazing. the momentum after the vault, the new animation. it’s like mwah, the spicy meatball of being a survivor now 
---
Claudette wasn't immersed enough.
---
How do I do it?
---
Tbh I read this in a caveman voice 
---
Please make it and get it to fuck from here, weirdest shit ever.
---
Yes it’s Tapp. No I don’t want to run DS. 
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
DS, urban evasion, self care and lithe.
---
I've seen it already.
---
It's pretty ok, but only works when survivors play poorly.
---
well if the survivor didn't know either then you were on an even playing field. both blind to the true situation. probably was a bug because y'know those do happen every now and then.
---
thats a good ideia, but if do not have pallets anymore?
---
Resilience, Urban, Detectives, We'll Make It
---
It was this generation's "excuse your mouth."
---
Exactly!
---
Or detective's hunch.
---
I highly disagree, I’ve beaten good players and SWF groups using it, played properly it has little counter-play, so the survivors ability is removed from the equation. Gets better late game too, when pallets are already used. 
---
Why do you need to exist?
---
I was genuinely debating between. 
---
1) git gud.jpeg
---
or 
---
2) then perish.gif
---
lol at that point you'll have to just juke her till the entity inevitably just decides to get ya first. (or the devs decide you need a nukin)
---
It should be blanket Myers and not Wraith !
---
Survivors need more points for not escaping, because rn killers can 0-1k and get just as many or more than survivors who escape 
---
it replaced the old medium vault. if you’re running at a window at a weird angle and can’t get the fast vault, it’ll do the new slow vault animation :)
---
Okay, that is not what i'm getting at. Either you can't read or you're blind. He said one could argue that the game is more grindy today than it was back then. I am saying how wrong he is.
---
What is your point? 
---
not denying that, sure, one could see it as "grindy"...I have never argued against that. It does not come close to the old dbd, however.
---
To piss off survivor mains.
---
( thanks ) Well , I was more trying to show the Jason we had in the movies , one of the most famous slashers , since Trapper always reminds us of him , I tried to make a link . I was not referring to the f13 game
---
U need to talk to him about how t o x i c he is LOL
---
I'm not trying to start something, but what way do you know to counter this?
---
Unless the Survivor is at a pallet or safe window there's no much they can do, and both of those have a 50/50 chance to be body-blockable after Legion hops over it. Besides, pallets get burned through really fast if you play like this (Brutal Strength and Spirit Fury are ungodly on this build) since they're basically the only way to avoid being insta-downed.
---
Thank !
---
Just make sure the hood isn’t pointed and you’re good lol

He's not the jerk saying gg ez. He's the one saying that it makes sense why the killer wasn't moving if he was making grilled cheese 
---
Killers *should* have the advantage in a hatch situation.
---
At that point, the survivor team has straight up lost. The hatch should exist to give the last guy a chance, but it's just that.
---
A chance.
---
This should be the worst case scenario from which a recovery is possible, but very difficult.
---
As things stand, the whole thing favors survivors heavily (especially if they're a SWF lobby).
---
No, considering you did what you were supposed to. If you had her trapped and went afk on the other hand, probably. I've had killers do it to me, and while I think it's a dick move it's not bannable. You're supposed to be killing us, everything is a dick move to us though..lol
---
So basically turn him into Billy lol.

---
I think a survivor always spawns in there but use for sure 
---
I have a hard time believing that, amd if so how difficult could it possibly be
---
It’s a well founded educated guess based off of a number off variables such as: 2.4.0 balance changes like the borrowed time buff and BBQ “nerfs”, the fact that killer is borderline unplayable on console because of the frame rate and screen lag, a lack of killers has happened before, survivor queue times are extremely long while killer queue times are extremely short, etc. 
---
It’s not that I’m saying there’s like 3 people playing killer and the game is dead, but because of the above reasons I personally can say pretty confidently that not enough people are playing killer to match the number of survivors playing the game.
---
[yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pqlG9rJq-Q)
---
Oh my mistake, thought he was calling the killer bad! Sorry mate
---
Alright there are several things wrong here.
---
1. His one shot down is very hard to hit, it slows him down so much, and gets countered by running around shit. He can't use it at loops at all.
---
2. He has good basement camping potential, but so does huntress, trapper, hag, and hillbilly. 
---
3.  Other killers can basement camp while also having powers that do other shit too.
---
4. I have 1000+ hours so I think I have a pretty good idea of which killers are good, and which are bad. 
---
Havent played since update. Now upon trying to load game it says EAC client cannot be instantiated or something along those lines. 
---
each category tier gives you one tic. so bronze is 1, silver is 2, gold is 3, and iridescent is 4. all categories in iridescent gives you 16 tics and 2 pips to your survivor rank. 3 silver and 1 gold gives you 9 tics and 1 pip. 2 silver and 2 bronze prevents you from losing a pip. (hence the black pip on the bar) Anything less than that and you lose a pip  
---
any combination of said category tiers work as well, you can not get any tiers in two categories and get an iridescent and a silver in the other two and not lose a pip
---
You are either a huge Drag Race fan, or very commited to your memes. Either way, I admire your conviction.
---
Holding the game hostage is preventing a player from completing the game in some way. If you downed her and hooked her thats not holding the game hostage. 
---
Be a good eu boy like all of us and wait till tommorow morning. Maybe usa karma Santa Will come with presents
---
Legion is fun to play as when he goes over pallets and he’s fast. however be prepared to get a lot of dcs and hate. discordance is a nice perk i think it’s pretty helpful when eliminating your greatest threat so yeah i’d buy for that. up to u man :)
---
Why not use flashlights and keys?
---
the hag is using her power, you can easily avoid the traps by crouching over them. 
---
They should add a skill check to hex totems (like overcharge) 
---
It's a common error after updates.
---
Go to your steam libary -&gt; right click on DbD -&gt; select properties -&gt; go to local files -&gt; verify integrity of game files.
---
This should fix it :)
---
Yea same
---
I know you've got a lot of answers already, but probably the biggest problem people have is that facing Legion isn't fun for a Survivor. 
---
They can't be looped in the traditional sense, they can ignore stealth if they play the way they were intended, there are a couple of ways to use their power that are basically exploits (Frank's Mixtape+Stab Wounds Study+Moonwalking+Bloodhound, Cold Dirt+Joey's Mixtape), and Deep Wounds makes it really hard to see for the Survivor.
---
Besides the exploits they are about as bad as people made them out to be, but few people enjoy facing them, due in no small part to issues with their design.
---
At a competitive level yes, (except nurse) but this game isn’t meant to played competitively.
---
maybe if it was something like if the survivor idle for too long or spend more than 20sec's in a locker they'll scream and gain madness the longer they're like that. I think that actually would be neat. and a good teachable for the doctor if he didn't already have 3
---
Fellow 14 yo players rise up!
---
Doing that as we speak! Thanks friend!
---
The other game I had I came to my Ruin and there were 3 Survivors at it.
---
I was Myers. :^)
---
Yea but some items I literally never use, like the shiny pin on huntress, I have like 30 of those
---
3 days late, but how are newer players at Rank 19 having Teachables like Ruin and BBQ already? Just lucky in the Shrine?
---
It's all good. We both enjoyed the reason behind the idle killer. It made my day 
---
But I don’t like breaking my ankles every time I jump off a balcony
---
Hag? Or do you mean. The Hex Babysitter? Or Madame Camper?
---
Seriously, it’s sooooo shitty to get hooked and have them place 3 freaking hexes down on you. While still maintaining a hex on every totem they have. She needs a smaller limit on her hexes. Bring it from 10 down to like... 6, and maybe up the burn time it takes to erase them with a flashlight to compensate. 
---
Techinically the guy on the right is a left 4 dead cosplayer 
---
Yes that last point is the majority vote. Trading a few offerings for one of higher rarity. I've seen a few people on this sub wanting to trade 2 or 3 brown offerings for a yellow. Higher rarity items in exchange for a lot of lower ones. 
---
From what I've been seeing yes but I'm glad I got a lot of responses and mild debates. It's good to talk about a problem people have even if it's people arguing if it's a problem in the first place.
---
I agree with this, I'd ditch all kinds of leatherface add ons just for some spark plugs
---
It’s her way of slowing down the game, it slows down hook saves, but like others have said just crouch over her traps. 
---
Well if you aren’t using the one shot addon then why exactly are they any different then killers that can’t one shot? Why do they get their NOED privileges revoked if they aren’t using one shots?
---
if the survivors had a way to find them beforehand that'd work. like if you could not see it's a hex totem until you started working on it
---
No it's not. it was merely a few seconds, if you wouldd do it for 10-20 minutes or even longer, yes. but a few seconds just to let them soak in that "You're fucked"moment, you'll be fine
---
WHY THE FUCK DO I LOSE MY OFFERING IF THE KILLER DC'S AFTER SEEING THEM? AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME PITY POINT IR SOMETHING FOR IT!
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't try to learn I'm just saying not everyone wants to spend the only time they have to game watching other people play after they've lost.
---
Common enough to be a common complaint. 
---
This is actually kind of adorable. Love it!
---
I'm glad you like it 
---
Um, sir, that's Claudette
---
In higher ranks you have to place them in the area you think the survivors will go and hope they do
---
If Legion is closing the distance with Frenzy before fatiguing and pursuing with M1, he's basically just a slower Wraith in terms of raw chase potential.
---
You beat him the same way you beat Wraith.
---
Stay out of open areas, always be going from one window/pallet to the next, and loop the living shit out of him.
---
THE INITIAL GRIND REQUIRED TO EVEN HAVE A SHRED OF FUN WITH PERKS IN THIS GAME IS FUCKING ABSURD! EVEN WITH WGLF TRYING TO REACH A POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET JUST 2 USEFUL PERKS ON ONE SURVIVOR FEELS DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR NEW PLAYERS, ESPECIALLY AT LOWER RANKS WHERE IF YOU GET HOOKED YOU EITHER GET HOOK CAMPED AND DIE IMMEDIATELY, OR YOUR TEAM PULLS YOU OFF INSTANTLY SO THAT THE KILLER CAN REHOOK YOU IMMEDIATELY. ON TOP OF THAT YOU CAN'T FARM POINTS AS KILLER EFFECTIVELY UNTIL YOU GET GOOD PERKS, WHICH ALSO TAKE AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF POINTS TO REACH WHEN YOU START FROM ABSOLUTE ZERO.
---
I did P3 Dwight then Kate. Personally.
---
well, if i were the killer, i would let you farm and escape after your team screwed you. i'm assuming thats not what happened though?
---
Both in some people's opinions.
---
It's possible to completely wreck Freddy's because they have no ability to deal with looping. If a Freddy sleeps someone and chases like a normal Killer he'll get totally crushed. That's before you factor in Adrenaline, which wakes you up, heals you, and gives you a speed boost.
---
Freddy can be strong if he can sleep multiple people and keep them asleep, because there's no way to hide and no way to do the objective. He basically puts the game into a standstill.
---
Neither of these are very fun for Killers and Survivors respectively, but the big issue is that the only separating those two outcomes are the RNG of skillchecks. It's not fun to lose due to no fault of your own. (Which is part of the reason Survivors hate Legion, and why Killers complain about Decisive Strike.)
---
look at the trapper’s little eyes! the cute sparkle of admiration ✨
---
I would main Tony Gunk, ace reporter x1000000
---
Nope!
---
Thank you
---
It was an idea, I occasionally play him but all his add-ons are very static/similar. When hag, shape, and nurse all have add-ons that fundamentally change how you play them
---
:D
---
That's good for you buddy, maybe do some gens next time. I just think new solo players might want to know exactly what perks someone has and not have to wait for the rest of the team to finish. Watching people crouch around for 20 minutes is annoying and boring. Watching people wait at the exit to BM is annoying. The hatch standoff was just the first thing that came to mind. "Take the time" is nice and all, but some people have jobs and lives outside of video games is all I'm saying. Personally, I can tell what perks are most of the time but my noob friends are always asking me wtf is going on when something is out of the ordinary. Reading through the wiki of every killer perk to discover what someone *might* have had isn't ideal.
---
I bought it the second I logged in the game and saw the news this morning. I love the look, and I forgot how much fun she is to play
---
I don't think Leatherface is bad, he's just not as good as the other killers. Except Freddy and base legion of course.
---
Definitely. As long as people can discuss and come to realizations, we're moving forward as a whole.
---
P3L50 JAKE FOR LIFE
---
This happened to me except I thought that they were already in the process of unhooking me so i didn't mash space and instantly died right in front of them. I was absolutely livid but deep down I know it's my own fault for forgetting about the terrible game mechanic that is the struggle phase in general.
---
**2 8 S T A B W O U N-** oh wait, wrong Killer
---
Ohh i read it wrong some how LOL. I thought you said that a few weeks after school girl Lunar Year Event would come out. My bad.
---
P3 David. Never played anyone else. Picked him in the beginning because of dead hard and now I can’t play anyone else :D
---
Im offended you think all LF mains camp smh
---
I don’t think they said this one fixed anything.  Basically they said this changed how hex placement can work and will let them put them in different places that wouldn’t previously have been possible, but that the actual design work of creating and implementing those new spawns has not happened yet.  It was just back end foundation laying for future hex changes.
---
Her way of slowing down the game? Oh I forgot that she was the only killer not able to run ruin or devour hope.. Oh wait...
---
so apparently
---
you can't escape through hatch
---
i***F EVERYONE ELSE DISCONNECTS***
---
the way that I see it is that Killers get more blood points for a match than Survivors, so with that they can use it to buy more stuff on the blood web. Survivors keep their items + items if they get out, but lose them when they die. So I think it's a bit fair. 
---
Woah there feller, that's too fast! the friend needs to live in Mexico.
---
I P3 Laurie first, mainly because I had just gotten a fat stack of bloodpoints from the corrupted save bug and she was just released on console. Then I P3 Ace, because I knew Laurie would never get cosmetics and, c'mon, who doesn't like that lovable bastard? Then Kate was released, got her to P3 and she's now my main. I just like her the best.
---
Nah dude I don't, I love LF players. What I can't stand is Hag mains trying to tell me it requires any sort of skill to play her!
---
TBH IM VERY ALTRUISTIC AND IF THE KILLER DOESN'T GET ME DEAD I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ALTRUISTIC UNTIL IT KILLS ME
---
ThEyRe NoT cArToOnS!!!1!1!!
---
You are correct apart from prove thyself. If you run it you'll only be getting the old repair speeds, so now repairing with it is worse than it used to be.
---
He's just standing there! Menacingly! 
---
I think he is saying the dc icon didn't appear in-game
---
"A killer hit me withing a minute in a game and hooked me. Nerf killers plz"
---
Good editing but doesn't make sense. Think these upvotes are just because of the drag queen stuff
---
I've noticed this happen in some of my games too, but I don't understand how or why some offerings get hidden. Someone plz help me be less nooby.
---
Tell ya what. When they stop putting 3 gens INSANELY close together, to the point that the killer can literally protect one area of the map until the last gen, and then gets everyone ezpz.... THEN I’ll start caring about totem placement. 
---
Until then, suck it up, buttercup. 
---
Instant nut is only if you have descended.  
---
Still though
---
Then you should know he’s not a bad killer, there are only bad players. Why is trapper so weak unless he brings good add-ons, why does spirit and wraith games depend on their addons.
---
Why is freddy....
---
Beg the devs all you want, leatherface won’t change
---
This ain't even a joke, but it's so much easier to predict where higher ranked players are going compared to where lower ranked players will. Lower ranked players don't have as much game knowledge so won't go to any structures that you would expect them to. So I'd say the opposite is true. Hag gets it's easy no matter the rank, higher ranks it's easy to predict where they'll go and lower ranks it's easier to get them to just run anywhere and set off traps as they go
---
I agree that this would be a cool substitute for the original bell.
---
Do you play on PS4? 
---
If so I'm sorry, I felt bad but it was right in front of me.
---
This is brilliant
---
Ahaha Definitely!
---
I like that idea. 
---
I’ve gotten more shitty messages than not, but in fairness I absolutely have received fun/easy-going messages as both survivor and killer from time to time.  On ps4 you get that “______ has added you to a group” notification first and I always dread the string of slurs or whatever that’ll follow, but sometimes it’s just someone sharing a cool moment or laughing about an weird occurrence.  I go out of my way to send messages like that as well, especially to killers, as it can be easy to get bogged down by toxic players and stop having fun.
---
Can’t you just look at someone’s friend list (if on steam at least) and see if they are friends with anyone else in the game?
---
:'( I have hope

IM FUCKING SEIZING SKAGAGZJAKSJHSS 
---
Maybe it could be an outfit available to use on multiple killers. I can definitely see the appeal for it on Myers, for sure. I definitely still think it would be awesome on the wraith, especially as an uncloaked reveal.
---
Ya I guess thats true
---
Survivor: Teabags\* Pallet Loops\* Flashlights\* 
---
Survivor: Gets Downed\* Misses DS\*
---
Survivor: Disconnects\* Complains about being tunnled and camped in the after game chat\*
---
Killer: k buddy
---
&gt;Been suggested a billion times and I still don't know why it isn't in the game.
---
Darn
---
I agree that currently sabotaging is not worth the effort.  
---
I think an interesting addition or replacement to the current sabotage system would be for survivors to take longer to be sacrificed on sabotaged hooks (or hooks that were previous sabotaged).  if done properly, sabotaging could be possible counterplay to face camping.
---
u/Eccon5 I think we beat him lol 
---
Myers outfit
---
In the way you described, no it's not. But as you felt guilty enough to come question here I get the sneaking suspicion that maybe just maybe that's not quite how it went down. If you just kept them trapped in the corner without downing for a prolonged period of time, it could be punishable. Although they (disappointingly) don't take action often against troll.
---
Body piece and default head/sword is the best combo IMO. 
---
I’m usually the lucky bastard that I’m mid swing tier 3 ends.
---
Maybe because you'd be able to level up a hell of a lot faster and probably get 1 mil blood points in an hour... 
---
I don’t think you can if their profile is private on steam. You’d have to look fast I imagine. Even then, once dedicated servers come in, they’ll probably start giving out flags or something if you continuously lobby dodge since they’ll be able to track it better. Or once they pair the two lobbies (because there will be a survivor lobby and a killer lobby that will come together), they may make it so you can’t back out. Which would be preferable because lobby dodging is for sissies. 
---
Can we also talk about the efficiency buff %? It says 45% there.
---
On my tier 2 SC t says 35% and my tier 3 popped up with 25%. Am I crazy or does tier 1 
---
sound a lot better than tier 3?
---
Wouldn't that make all common items free at P3?
---
Not complaining, I'd love that SO much.
---
Not everyone wants to run ruin ? Pig has traps, Freddy had sleep, Hag has traps. 
---
During
---
It happened to me today as well, I had 3 of them hooked and was wondering why the 4th wouldn't save so I started trying lockers. When they all died the game ended, the missing survivor still got 200 bp so wtf, wasn't a DC?
---
I swear the guy that makes Spirit’s cosmetics and design was a horny intern that eventually got a promotion in time for the chapter.
---
Finally, Adept Pig is possible.
---
I don't understand 
---
I never made the comparison until just now, actually... and now I feel like Trapper is just the seriously confused Jason trying to get home. 
---
Wait a second 
---
You mind telling me what surveillance does now? I looked it up but can’t find it 
---
Yeah, I think this is the main one, and some also argue Frank’s Mixtape makes them too strong (which I don’t really agree with; maybe just make it ultra-rare since plenty of killers have ultra-rare add-ones that make them insanely powerful).  It’s frustrating playing as Legion and having people dc or complain that you only won because they’re OP... when you weren’t moonwalking or running Frank’s.  Played how they were intended to be played (bounce between survivors, keeping them all on the mend, go for downs when opportunities present themselves), they aren’t overwhelmingly strong at all.
---
That’s an interesting idea, but not one I’m particularly fond of. Are you saying that it takes longer for them to die AFTER the hook regenerates? Or that the hook never falls at all?
---
Still, I just won’t waste a good toolbox on a sabotage that’ll more than likely never be useful, and I won’t waste time using the perk because of the same reason, PLUS I’ll have wasted twice as much time. 
---
I saw blanket sheet and got scared
---
I P3'd Claudette last week now im gonna work on Ace and Quentin. Call me weird but i like P3 Quentin outfit and i really want to get it.
---
Balanced is the only exhaustion perk that still has an active ability. This is why you run it with Dead Hard so you're never caught out along with throwing the killer off.
---
BUT THEY STILL DO IT IN RANK ONE.
---
Just let me buy bbq teachable with cash ffs. I dont have the time or energy to grind out painful leatherface levels. Such a weak concept.

---
Unless a killer facecamps and/or tunnels someone I will take the extra bit of time just to say gg, and most people really appreciate it.
---
Paid actor 
---
To anyone that complaining about how stressful when playing as killers in high rank, try playing survivor as “solo queue” in high rank as well and you can see the difference. 
---
With the killer’s good perks and add-on, you can barely escaped and get less bloodpoints due to lack of communication and how fast of each survivor getting downed and hooked.
---
I feel like solo queue players these days are ez targets for killers and they got nothing for those disadvantages. Because of SWF taking too much advantages. Just saying.
---
I know those feels. For a while I legit felt the same way. 
---
Billy as an astronaut.
---
Killers can carry you a goddamn country mile as is. Basement on this half of the map? Might as well take the time! Making sabotage impactful would shake things up. You might see more varied perks on both sides if it actually mattered.
---
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS INFINITE LOADING SCREEN GLITCH AND I'VE PLAYED ABOUT 40 HOURS THIS WEEK
---
Play like a bitch until someone else is found
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
I run Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Iron Will, and We'll Make it even prior to the patch.
---
We'll make it has saved the person I unhooked more times than I can count. It's like 5-8 seconds for a full heal while also persisting for 90 seconds meaning I can go heal someone else/slugged person.
---
Self Care can literally make a good game go bad. People get hit when they shouldn't meaning they go off and heal themselves when they could of done half a gen in the same amount of time. Just be sure you got a backup plan in case they roll up on you.
---
Because then you'd have nothing to do in the game.
---
This is a great idea.
---
Before I was Dwight Main. But when Kate came out, I fell in love with her character. I like the perks, her backstory and her Cosmetics ! She became my favourite Survivor, it'll be hard to top her :)
---
I used to run sabo all the time and was sad that it didn't affect emblems so I stopped. It was so fun though, especially when killers would waste their ivory mori on me out of rage and everyone else would escape.
---
I used sabo to get the new achievement but otherwise I don't bother much. When it's a daily it says the equivalent so I never fully take down a hook for it. It's the smarter way to play that ritual.
---
I would love to play with you!! My x box is z0mbieattack and I am a clodette main level 42 and also a hag main at level 2 because I recent brought the caharacter :3 I am rank 17 with 1 pip but its very hard to rank up :(
---
Ace Ven-sconti (Ace Ventura/Ace Visconti hybrid)
---
People fear that this would split the population so yeah. I guess rank doesn't mean anything since you don't get anything so it's not a big deal.
---
Hey look it's you in the comment section on the first post. Had a feeling I knew your name from somewhere. Also I haven't even posted 100 times on this account smh and you're welcome to post this on r/QuitYourBullshit but the way you worded it gave the impression you were threatening me. Now I am correct, that is a rule broken for you pal. 
---
Wow I thought this was gonna be an advice post but instead this amazing artwork was shown to me
---
oh thats hot
---
Thanks. 
---
Will add the dissenting opinion that Legion is both fun to play as and against.  I dig that you have to approach them differently than any other killer.  As long as you don’t moonwalk with them, no one is justified in throwing a tantrum because you’re using them.  
---
Also my main perk is clam spirit because it counter spies from shadow which is really overpowerful
---
No0b3 would love this
---
yes! spies from shadows is really powerful which is why i run it on all of my killers OwO
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmzRa-sXQs
---
Yeah, that's definitely true. I know I'd dip out of the ranked lobbies for good if a social playlist came out. Good point.

Bro she bought bread!
---
i wanna play! xbox is PrinceDeathXx and i play nea. im new to the game but really good I got to rank 10 in a week(!!!) i run bond bec i watched a tydetyme guide that said self care was terrible now XD and urban because its the most op perk i can think of tbh. also iron will and adrendaline 
---
Yes i got it in level 1 bloodweb on hag so I use it all the time but only tier 1 at the moment 0w0
---
They seem fun to play, that's why I'm surprised everybody says that they are dull. Moonwalking is toxic, yeah, but I'm not planning tk do it anyways.
---
Theres a better one that auto fills everything so you dont have to deal with the annoying wheel.

He was flexing cause he got rank 1 from camping LMFAO
---
If you could buy teachables for real money would that help?
---
Dee as the clown was a missed opportunity 
---
YES!!! XD i watched tyde time  also, he seems really good. i dont want to level claudette for self care because i think it is quiet bad after the nerfes to it. i wil definitely add you, i can not wait to play!!! :3 and oh my gosh!!! rank 10!! your so good!!
---
what I have in mind is either:
---
 breaking hooks gets taken out of the game and is replaced by hooks being "marked" in a way (known or unknown to killers), then only for the next survivor to be hooked on that hook, he/she takes longer to bleed out/be sacrificed.
---
OR
---
breaking hooks remains in the game, but once the hook regenerates, then the next (or maybe all) survivor to be hooked takes slightly longer to bleed out/be sacrificed.
---
Holy fuck what happened 
---
Every time I spawn in the killer comes directly to me, so it doesn’t matter how I play. 
---
I did exactly the same 
---
I still don't get the DCs from survivors. Like, he isn't that hard to deal with + if he is running Frank's, just kill yourself on hook and get some BPs.
---
And yeah, discordance is great.
---
I dare you to run a game on Freddy without ruin, or even pig, it's a fact. The abilities don't slow the game down as much as ruin. That wasn't even my point anyway. Why would traps slow the game down? I mean if camping it slowing the game down then yea sure I'll count it. But then you could just say any other killer who uses insidious and camps is "slowing the game" down too? 
---
It’s so much better now. I really love the idea of the perk so I’m glad it’s really good now. 
---
Fair enough, but consider this: remember me is for Freddy, a killer; T3 resilience only shaves off 2 seconds at the cost of a health state; and I feel like this is gonna be redundant, but unless you’re playing swf every trial, you don’t know what your teammates’ perks will be. 
---
Second redundant thing of all, the objective is to escape through the exit gates, hence repairing gens (toolboxeshelpescapefaster 🤧). Keys are objectively useless until the hatch spawns.
---
I’m just curious to know which other response cleared it up cuz like other than verb tense...nvm
---
They're not siblings. Halloween 2 is not canon
---
You fearless bastard. Take my upvote it's not much but it is something.

---
The irony of responding to my joke by calling out confirmation bias by utilizing your own confirmation bias ;)
---
No... That's not how any of this works sweety.
---
With all I have explained to how other killers are better than leatherface how can you say he isn't bad? 
---
What parameters make a killer good in your opinion? If leatherfaces power being useless in chase and useless for map pressure don't make him bad, what exactly is it about him that's good? His one hit does nothing besides fill the niche of him camping someone. Which is something other killers can do and still have useful powers. 
---
He needs a buff because his power is almost useless.
---
Lmao, being in hatch standoffs does not mean I didn't do gens. What a dumb assumption to make. I've been in several games where I was the only one doing gens. Cut the sarcasm.
---
Then those people can choose to wait, or go to the next game. If people are playing with others, they can just ask them.
---
And in no way is that a nerf to totems.
---
my main killer is the nightmare(level 8) (i really like him XD) 
---
my perk build is: spies from shadows (level 2), hex: no one escapes death(level 1) and fire up (level 2)
---
I play freddy at higher ranks and have fun with him. Guess what! I dont have ruin on him. Its possible.
---
Thank you sir. They hate me here. 
---
Yeah I’m gonna have to start using it, sounds like it’ll help out a lot 
---
Hello! It looks like you're asking if /r/deadbydaylight has a subreddit Discord.
---
There is no Discord server for /r/deadbydaylight, nor is the subreddit affliated with a Discord server. The invite link for the offical Dead by Daylight Discord can be found [HERE](discord.gg/deadbydaylight).
---
That would defeat the purpose of dull totems existing, which is to give an optional secondary objective that slows the game down. There'd be no reason to cleanse them with this nerf. 
---
Now pig is actually worth leveling up. Her only good perk was MYC but now she has 2. Hangman’s trick is really only good on trapper and full SWF Jakes with toolboxes. 
---
Ruin is likely best for preventing early gen rushes.  If anyone misses the great skill check, the 2 second hard lock before gen can start progressing again means it slows it significantly, and with 4 people on the gen, there is a decent chance one of them can't land ruin checks consistently.
---
This. Exactly this.
---
No, they’re just ridiculously ascended. They TOTALLY deduced that the shitpost flair was to hide the fact that this was his legitimate balance suggestion. 
---
Summer clothes/swimsuits for all the Survivors and Killers.
---
Or does it have to be a single person?
---
Legion as Ghostface or Pretty Lady Leatherface 
---
I p3 50 all perks on ace. And p3 david and laurie. And working on bill and claudette atm.
---
THAT MIND FUCK THO
---
No not directly of course.  Of course you'll have those few games where people wont run small game and it'll be great.  But in mid to high ranks everyone will have it/most people will have it.  As a result the destruction time of hex's will be about the same.  You are right, it's not guaranteed that the meta would be shifted because of that.  I just simply predict that it would because hex perks are some of the strongest perks you can put on in the entire game.
---
This is amazing
---
I don’t think it’s cause of weeabos. It’s more the fact playing as a man in dbd is actually worse than a woman. They are just bigger so easier to spot. The trade off of being quieter is almost useless. Woman also have better cosmetics with the exception of Kate being ungodly bright. 
---
I don’t think they’ll take hook breaking out of the game, especially since two survivor perks deal specifically with hooks, and break out is a fun perk. It’s like a nice FU to the killer when you get unhooked. 
---
Besides, I wouldn’t want them to remove hook breaking. It’s a nice mechanic to have as another means to save someone from getting hooked. It’s just the execution that’s the problem. I feel like they can lower the time it takes for hook breaking with the Sabo ability by now and see how it goes. The game has evolved since launch and there’s more perks and play styles than ever. 
---
Fucking androids
---
They hate me too but I'd rather be hated for saying how I feel than loved for saying what they want to hear. 
---
I'm on Google fiber 100mbs+/50mbs+, open nat, hardwired in.
---
Never ever ever get less than 130 ping.
---
Omg your so lucky to have fire up I might need to level nightmare for that perk and I really want no one escaped death even though its a bit underpowered because of hex though :(
---
Its the stab number 28 thats letal, until then you have a chance
---
Yikes. I don't love these new outfits. Though at least they probably don't have goddamn sleeves flapping around, looking like survivors in the corner of your eye.
---
Thank you. I’ve never before had a moment where I was like “oh yeah, let me just activate Bloodwarden quick and take care of this problem.”
---
I'm saying, either spend the time spectating or move on if it's that damn annoying to you. Any *good* player will already be able to tell what the killer's running, anyway. :)
---
Hidden killer offerings are when the killer uses a shroud of seperation (All survivors spread out at start), or any of their 3 moris.  Survivor hidden offerings are always shrouds of some sort, where it forces either 2 survivors spawn together, 4 survivors spawn together, or for a single survivor to spawn as far as possible from the killer, depending on the offering used.
---
Dwight in a tight pink thong being carried by David. 
---
Good job. I'll never understand why so many assholes refuse to just leave. It must be some kind of autism. 
---
I wouldn't mind that either.
---
Honestly, even just keeping it at 300 would be better than resetting it every time, otherwise it's yet another arbitrary system of ranking that serves literally no purpose.
---
Oh for sure. I used it with dead hard and had some times where I was hooked near an exit gate and deliveranced into a dead hard past the killer and got out. It’s fun but I only get to use it like 1/3 of games and if I use it before the gates are open I’m just gonna get tunneled which makes sense because I have the broken status. 
---
I get really tired of people who make you watch them leave. But sometimes I do it against face campers or tunnelers. 
---
's is never used for plurals unless you're talking about single letters (A's, B's, C's) and sometimes to avoid confusion with certain other very short acronyms or contractions.
---
It's ATMs, not ATM's. It's devs and not dev's. Dev is a contraction of developer.
---
Yeah, luckily you don't need to worry about that anymore
---
I was wondering the same thing. Extremely annoying for an already obnoxious killer. 
---
I HATE IT WHEN I JUST STAND THERE AS THE SPIRIT, PRETENDING TO PHASE, AND THE SURVIVOR KEEPS RUNNING IN A STRAIGHT LINE INSTEAD OF BACK TOWARDS ME! NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN! WHY CAN'T I MIND GAME!? 
---
Yeah the perk is so fun to use, but it rarely ever works. Kinda wish they’d buff it in some way. Idk how but just a small tweak 
---
Not to the point the survivor feels borderline helpless. That’s the entire point of hatch, to remove that feeling. 
---
Everything leading up to the standoff has the killer being the advantageous one. Once both players are at hatch or very close to it the survivor has basically won which I agree, is an issue.
---
I've never saw it posted but I agree 100%
---
Lol your defense mechanism is adorable, sweetheart we know how you really feel. 
---
The problem with the current shart system is: you get about the same shart/xp no matter what level you are, you only have to wait longer for your sharts and get more at once
---
Yeah idk how tho. A small thing I’d love is if when you’re the last survivor left and have deliverance active, the game would let you use it instead of just killing you instantly. Just another way to make that perk useless. 
---
Sabotage hooks to 99%. When killer comes with a survivor in hand finish the hook.
---
If you’re confused even by Jason’s standards, the you know you’re in a bad place.
---
Always hated that. Shouldn’t I get points for dodging LF’s saw? Hook escapes almost never happen any way so I have no clue why not every power has it’s own point system.
---
Start cleansing them totems and get gud bruh lol 
---
She MUST be trolling...
---
IM GETTING SO BORED OF BEING A SURVIVOR MAIN. I WANT TO SWITCH TO KILLER BUT I DONT WANT MY GOOD TIMES TO BE RUINED BY WHINEY SURVIVORS. 
---
They're not. They're either deranking on purpose, or took several months off from DBD. BBQ doesn't appear in the shrine, period, so there's no way they bought it off the shrine.
---
This is perfect
---
It sucks that I can’t use it when I’m last one left. I think instead of the Broken Status effect maybe like reduced repair and healing speed. I think that would balance it out a bit. Granted, they could just get off the hook then insta heals and sprint burst away, but I don’t think you’ll get that too often. 
---
That spot or the spot right above them. When you are about to drop in the hole there is a totem that spawns almost always.
---
Then you don't have to worry 
---
IMO wake up is only useful for when you’re being chased and don’t notice the gate locations, but then again when I’m being chased, the exit is where I’m running to anyways. At least to either pass the killer off to someone else (resetting bloodlust is a good strat okay I’m not a sandbagger....all the time lol) or stall for someone to open the door, but I digress. It’s an aura reading perk that mainly benefits the user with an extra 5% gate speed buff T3. Imagine using a toolbox. And running T3 bond, where you see what everybody’s doing the whole game. Btw loving the discourse. 
---
I hear that. I'm at level 89 Devotion 2 and I really starting to miss getting 100 every game.
---
I always have a fear that I'll release the struggle button to get ready to run/crouch (so they heal me), and they won't unhook me in time and I die. Hasn't happened to me yet, but I'm still paranoid.
---
I only played 2 matches with survivor today and in both matches i found a purple key but lost it cuz i suck dick
---
Michael Myers done fucked up DBD. 
---
Wow didn’t even notice that. That’s awesome lol
---
When he says BBQ is the rarest, he means it’s only been is the shrine of secrets once back in 2017. It is currently the most desirable killer perk because it gives you double your earnings plus it has an amazing in game ability, so it wouldn’t surprise me if BBQ is set to never show up in the shrine again, as it is a big reason people buy the leatherface DLC.
---
Why not? You get to test a DLC killer for free
---
Oh alright.
---
Was that very toxic though? I’ll hang out in the door sometimes to see if anyone needs help, didn’t seem all that bad to me. 
---
Regardless, absolutely hilarious lol 
---
Many people agree that survivors should get more BPs.
---
That's how the perk works
---
Maybe put you in the deep wound state and have you mangled? The Instaheal could still be problematic though. I don’t know. 
---
((Surveillance))
---
I've been running pharmacy instead, getting a full self care out of a med kit, enough to help healing others quickly, and it can carry over to the next match for 2 green med kits. That and insanely fast, silent chest searches make it really easy to just grab it whenever you see a chest.
---
Haunted Ground plus Deerstalker would be absolutely insane.
---
Maybe it’d be a new status effect that makes you unable to use items for a certain amount of time, like madness T3. Make it last ~60 seconds. 
---
I agree with everything you've said, Senor :)
---
what was the point of this 
---
I ALMOST GOT TO THE GATE WHILE SUDDENLY LAGGED, BUMPED INTO A WALL, GOT DOWNED, DIED.
---
ALSO, IN ANOTHER MATCH I'VE RISKED MY LIFE 2 TIMES TO SAVE SOMEONE AND ONCE TO KEEP KILLER BUSY FOR LIKE 6 MINUTES. AFTER THAT KILLER HOOKED ME AND OTHER SURVIORS HAVEN'T DONE SHIT, THEY JUST FIXED THE GEN ONCE HE HOOKED ME AND ESCAPED WITHOUT EVEN TRYING TO SAVE ME.
---
Normally I’d agree with you. But when I wait to see if they need help I don’t t-bag. And she was also dropping and fast vaulting pallets. She could have easily just snuck over there and when I went to check the door she opened, helped them and opened that door. 
---
New Ultra-Rare Add-On for Nurse
---
Misty Wheeze: With this add-on equipped the goddamn Nurse is totally invisible. Deal with it Meg.
---
It's all rng though, so it can really be hit or miss. I can usually power through it without much trouble as survivor.
---
Here is quicker version. Don't play legion. If you have to for daily put Frank's mixtape on and tunnel.
---
JUST IGNORE THEM SCRUBS, THEY OBVIOUSLY DONT UNDERSTAND THE ADD-ONS YOU ARE USING. ThEY ARE THE NOOBS!!!
---
&gt; "When I play killer, I also avoid tunneling. Since I don't camp - and always devote to a hook-and-book strategy - if someone tries to farm their teammate before I can literally turn around (so we're talking, oh, I don't know, 2 seconds?) then I'm going to focus the unhooker for being a crap teammate. If I accidentally down the unhooked instead, I will pick up/drop them until they can run again, because I'm not going to be that person. You can't reject being unhooked, so it's not your fault that your teammate is an ass."
---
Straight up this is how I play, I try and be a fair Killer, the amount of times I've seen someone get unhooked right in front of me actually disgusts me, so if it happens I'll do like you do and focus on the attacker until the unhooked survivor can at least get healed. 
---
Please do more of these!!!!!
---
I just wish they would make totems worth more or at least add a counter (being included with Small Game is a very obvious addition). As a solo player, it’s really just not worth the time cleansing them at all. Until something changes, I just run Hope to at least counter the speed boost.
---
I get the aspect of slowing the game down, but I don’t think enough of a reward (BP) or information is being given to survivors.
---
Give them a minute to recharge!
---
Still waiting on that day rework haHAA
---
Solo players can and do message each other , a mild discomfort for you sure but a sacrifice needed to be made for the games overall health. To be honest this new change is how it always should have been. If you cant wait the extra 3-5 minutes it takes a match to finish after your dead than the information you seek clearly  isn't that important to you.
---
Well but for those who bought him and still want to enjoy him in some way.
---
Preeeeeeetty much.  I've never seen that happen before, and she stayed invisible through downing, picking up, carrying, hooking, and blinking away.  She was visible again when next I saw her, so I have no idea what happened there.
---
You can play anything else, and spend the points on Leathery Boi. Still have to buy him, though.
---
What are we paying for? Certainly, not the servers cause it's P2P. 
---
The decency to even ask money for DLC. I'm baffled you guys are okay with it.
---
Hes incredibly annoying for survivors. Once hes onto you, youre gonna get stabbed no doubt that. And if hes tunneling you in a chase there is absolutely nothing you can do, youll get downed. Only nurse can do that, but she requires skill, and you can mind game her blinks. With speedy boi just press one button and survivor is doomed.
---
A person slugging and the killer is either nurse or legion?
---
Nioce
---
Pig is really fucking fun to play. MYC and Surveillance are really good, and MYC is really fun to use on killers like Freddy and hag. It’s great on hag because you hook, set your traps, then leave and once they get saved, you teleport back get your free MYC hit. It’s good on Freddy because naturally you don’t camp ever as Freddy so you hook, leave, then come back to get the guy who rescued. 
---
Surveillance is pretty much good in every killer, especially on stealth killers like Myers or Wraith because you kick the gen and lurk nearby and wait for them to touch it. It’s easily one of my fav Anti-Gen perks to use. 
---
I had a ruin totem spawn in the upper room with the long meat chute thing. I had never seen it spawn there before and apparently the survivors I was facing didn’t either because nobody cleansed it even though they ran past it like 10 times. 
---
Oh yea, it is all RNG, but for the specific purpose of blocking the first bit of time as a group trying to gen rush, ruin best handles it just because of the ruin "Not great" gen stall force.  It only takes one of the 2-4 not being able to get through them to shut it down.
---
He’s like Leatherface imo; buy him for Discordance and *move on.* But you do you my friend!
---
The killer is either camping or not camping, there is no need to have two different things. Flail them if the killer is camping, so if youre not flailing them, that means he isnt. You have to keep these things simple
---
I personally LOVE how spies creates several huge noise notifications when someone in my LOS sets off crows, meaning I can't see them or where they're going any more. Very useful!
---
I had a totally invisible huntress the other day, so you aren't alone.
---
To not show vegana and butt
---
Got one yesterday for a killer I owned, was told that if you have the DLC you won't get them but if you have just the killer you will. Makes no sense but that's how it apparently works.
---
Trapper is literally inspired because of Jason. They were gonna put Jason put couldn't because of the game
---
You honestly dont need to walk. Just sprint to gens, repair them, youll get it soon enough usually. And even if not, if youre good enough, youll have a long chase and youll have opportunities to refresh exhaustion(especially at vaults at the shack, jungle gym and sometimes t-walls)
---
BL is the worst exhaustion perk by far, imo
---
this game has its highs and lows, the lows make me wanna stop playing sometimes, but then i get that 1 match that makes me love it again, gotta embrace the bullshit sometimes
---
Good points.
---
Nea being recruited by Legion. Her weapon can be a spiked police baton.
---
Thanatophobia powerfull? sure...
---
If you use two exhaustion perks, youll just have one wasted one. BLs ability is useless, because all you have to do is not drop. The lithe, DH and SB use the exhaustion way better imo
---
ok
---
then dont jump off balconies, you wont have to if you route right
---
Ah, was scrolling for this. Thank you 
---
I think a lot of the satisfaction with breaking a hook is the laughing and nonsense over mic which is why mostly only SWF do it when theyre messing around. Theyd have to make it worthwhile and satisfactory to do it solo for more people to do it imo
---
No im talking about colored icons for offerings for example like this https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/879zzc/happy_clowns_colored_perks_saw/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
The sleep timer is so over hyped, it's not a big deal. They just need to make it so you can't interact during it.
---
Prove thyself likes this post. 
---
Idk I used ranchor on one guy, managed to surprise some at the exit with noed and cought the final one close to my totem
---
Nice
---
Well there are two sides of opinions at the moment...
---
One side thinks he is op and should be nerfed/reworked 
---
and the other is thinking that he is too weak or flawed in every way and should be reworked.
---
I'll take the middle ground and say that he is flawed but in a way that makes him strong when playing at a certain playstyle, a slightly unusual playstyle indeed.
---
Lmao
---
NO, CLAUDETTE. IT'S NOT FARMING IF YOU LITERALLY RUN INTO THE KILLER AFTER GETTING UNHOOKED. IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU DON'T HAVE EYES OR EARS AND DIDN'T NOTICE THE KILLER WHEREVER HE WAS AFTER YOU SPRINT BURSTED AWAY FROM THE HOOK.
---
It sucks to get tunneled, and it sucks to go against an entire team with DS. Its better to just accept that the game is unbalanced and do whatever benefits you the most instead of hoping that the opposing side agrees with your "honor code".
---
Stop, my penis can only get so erect 
---
He definitely will. I personally run M&amp;A, Thana, 3rd Seal, and BBQ normally. Your build here is more of a forever-injured build, but the basics remain the same. Legion is super fun, when actually played and you don't just moonwalk
---
What if devour hope tho
---
I don't agree that tunneling is inherently toxic.
---
God I hate SWF 
---
NANI?!
---
Deerstalker on Freddy?
---
MY ADVICE IS TO TRY AND KEEP TRACK OF WHERE THEY'RE HEADED BY CHECKING THE TOPS OF CORNSTALKS FOR MOVEMENT
---
Wow thats spooky. Freddy is a multi cultural killer
---
I mean, all killers still have a bit of humanity within them, and pulling out an actual suit of armor would also be a strange gimmick that ruins the set of killers we had so far.... And does an animated set of armor have a form of breathing? I think not.
---
YEAH THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO ME WITH THE NEW PATCH, TOO. GENERATORS GET DONE TOO QUICKLY.
---
Can’t say the guy doesn’t have range.
---
WHY IS IT THAT I CAN PRETTY MUCH DODGE EVERY KILLERS HIT EXCEPT THE GOD DAMN WRAITH'S? HIS SHIT ALWAYS HITS ME THROUGH PALLETS, WINDOWS, AND WHEN I'M PRACTICALLY FUCKING BEHIND HIM. LMAO.
---
This is extremely high quality
---
Yep your build would also work just as fine! 
---
As i said, without the rights perks, he is kinda useless but as soon you add those ability supporting perks, he is gonna get a pain.
---
WHY DO I GET LOADING CRASH EVERY OTHER GAME FFS I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME BARELY FOR 6 DAYS NOW AND IM SO SICK OF THE LOADING TO LOBBY/GAME CRASH AAAAAAAAAAA
---
r/prequelmemes
---
Thats why you should combine him with perks like nurse calling that helps you find those injured survivors
---
Rank reset only happens once every month on the 13th
---
Every time I throw this perk on, the killer seems to spawn so damn close to me. It sure feels like it.
---
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR ME TO GET PERKS SUCH AS NURSE'S CALLING AND ENDURING, IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER TO GET NURSE TO LEVEL 30. 
---
Iron grasp, agitation, enduring, ruin. Enduring just in case they break free when you down far from basement, you get them down again quickly. Ruin to buy you some time.
---
Maybe not a form of breathing but it would creak or create noise from the movement of armor metal clanking around and all
---
They fixed it remember
---
there are 16 bars underneath the category medals, each of those bars is a tic (thats what i call them). each tier of medal gives you 1 tic. So 1 iridescent medal=4 "bars" filled.  
---
Along the bar there are diamond shaped "pips". If you reach the black pip you don't gain or lose any survivor rank. If you reach the first white pip you gain 1 pip towards your survivor rank and if you reach the second white pip you'll get two pips toward your survivor rank. hopefully I explained it better that time
---
GOD I FUCKING HATE THE DOCTOR AS A SURVIVOR, AND THIS IS COMING FROM A DOCTOR MAIN.
---
OTHER THAN SPENDING 90% OF THE GAME IN A LOCKER HE WILL ALWAYS FUCKING FIND YOU.
---
I wasn't saying that information for new players. New players will still be trying to figure out how to drop pallets. That information was specifically intended for people trying to better understand perks and gain more in-depth knowledge.
---
...On a side note, kind of frustrating that my honest attempt at helping gets me Reddit hate.
---
Had a match today as the spirit where a 4 man SWF were a sabo squad and made me slug them
---
Still won though
---
Lol noed, baby killer

STFU noed crutch user
---
I THOUGHT THEY FIXED SOUNDS UNTIL IT GOT FUCKING HADDONFIELD LIKE 4 TIMES TODAY AND I DIED
---
The Doctor before he went insane
---
Whispers is Definitely still better. Surveillance is the better perk vs spies
---
I know, they didn’t do shit, those incompetent bastards
---
Honestly I think in the current state of the two perks whispers still provides a much more consistent use with no counterplay. However as the crow alerts max range is much larger and now at 100% I think spies provides a riskier but larger effect. 
---
Overall the balance between the two perks is near perfect now.
---
* Whispers for consistency
---
* Spies for more power
---
It feels like an actual choice between the two now. Not just defaulting to one automatically.
---
Omg please leave that guy alone I want to hug him
---
How are they repairing faster if they aren't getting buffed? I'm so confused, are we all getting the bonus?
---
The Black Knight from Monty Python or it's a no from me.
---
So shitty man, rip
---
people dont know what shitpost means clearly
---
Well the thing that makes people complain about noed is because "regardless of how it was done, it was done" doesnt mean it would have been done at all without NOED.

a facecamping killer?

I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE

Drift king tum tums BEWARE

I GOT STUCK IN THE BASEMENT AND HAD TO DC BECAUSE I JUST KEPT PORTING INTO THE BASEMENT WHENEVER I LEFT AND THE KILLER WAS AFK REEEEEEEEEEE

THIS BUG IS SO ANNOYING

Claudette Morel Mushroom. Her last name is a pun off of the fact that she’s a botanist, a model is a type of mushroom
---
Nobody does that 
---
I didn’t think people did this outside of dailies, but... I recently had a match where a crazed jake sabo’d hooks at least four times.   I immediately played as survivor and did the same thing, hilarious but creates some extremely salty killers. 
---
We really don't know, though.
---
It's going to be fine, especially because killer mains are going to find something else to bitch about since SWF can't see this info now.
---
I’ve been left on hook full duration with kindred before though, sometimes randoms are just douches.
