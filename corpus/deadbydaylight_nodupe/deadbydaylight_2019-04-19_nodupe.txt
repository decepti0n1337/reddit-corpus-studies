---
Maybe it works
---
Which would make it balanced, killer can slug until near bleedout, proc BW and everyone dies
---
He's speaking the language of the gods
---
OOOOOOO KILL EM !
---
The only ones they can efficiently listen to are the ones that also submit a ticket.
---
Pig is going to be an endgame menace and I‚Äôm all for it.
---
Both. The Entity is getting stronger (and probably killed Benedict) and the since the Entity loves a good Trial it would get bored at the Claudette holding the game hostage.
---
Care to explain why? I'm rather curious about this, I do believe this could show the Entity is growing ever stronger/tired of survivors japing killers
---
weeb.
---
Beat me to it, lmao I thought the same thing
---
Why? Obviously body blocking to stop the game indefinitely is bannable, but body blocking to wait out a timer is perfectly valid. In this case, body blocking someone so wraith can decloak and get a hit is bannable
---
Stock up on your keys girls.
---
True.
---
"Nerf"
---
So darken your prose, I'll strike a violent pose, they better leave you alone but not me.
---
Mermaid man dies in endgame
---
Why is pig scarier?
---
It's the Entity getting tired of the survivors' shenanigans. It doesn't want them to continue doing the shit they've been doing, like teabagging in the killer's face for 10+ minutes during the endgame.
---
Well we aren‚Äôt gonna get this lol. I expect the Collapse to use the same instruments and theme used in the dying and injured state. Maybe even the killer theme song in the menu. That guitar would be awesome for the whole impending doom thing.
---
So is this a permanent new feature? or just a temp fun new gamemode?
---
You know, I really like this. I play survivor mostly but play killer when load times are ridiculous (aka all the time lol). They thought outside the box here and I really think this solves a ton of issues. Just the other day I sacrificed three with one survivor still left and looked for them for 15 minutes. They didn‚Äôt do any gens. Finally downed them and they DC‚Äôed.
---
not true, the killer can still get them in those situations. You clearly just aren't good enough. Im sure faster vaulting has nothing to do with anything considering the killer can just loop around and get them.
---
The Bih guy is an idiot
---
Goddang the funniest memes ever are dbd memes üòÇ
---
And you're a racist
---
Man, this is impressive. Do we really need to do this shit? I'm here trying to have a discussion about a thing that annoys me every day, and I'm getting either a troll or a super salty killer who's assuming shit. I just want to play the game, and do so in a way that's fun for everyone. I don't play 4 man swf because it is op as all hell and not fun to play against, and it's not always feasible to run those perks. Dead hard is buggy as hell on console and us casual players haven't had time to unlock MOM yet. I can't exactly get randoms to bring borrowed time and even if they do it doesn't do much against a killer that doesn't give up. I don't really care about escaping, I just want to play a round where I actually get to play the game and don't get punished for not having the chance to gain emblem points. Let's not turn this into a "SURVIVORS ARE ALL TOXIC ASSHOLES WITH OVERPOWERED CRUTCH PERKS WHO GET ALL SALTY IF THEY LOSE" thread.
---
This actually sounds super killer sided and it hurts a little. Yes I‚Äôm glad they can put an end to the long games that don‚Äôt end because survivors don‚Äôt leave. But there are legitimate games where I need more than 3 minutes to figure things out without stalling. I don‚Äôt know how much it slows down the timer but endgame hooks sound like you might as well be dead. Pig sounds even stronger now because of traps and following people around so they can‚Äôt play any objective and will lose (situational of course).   
---
I feel like there should be more time on the clock depending on the length of the match. A shorter match would equal more than 3 minutes on the timer. And after a certain point only 3 minutes can be gained.   
---
Also Remember me, blood warden and NOED get hidden buffs. I‚Äôm glad killers are getting more and more power but this timer seems pretty bad
---
Ah but see here's the kicker.
---
He was born in 1972.
---
He's 47
---
Homophone, go back to Canada
---
I love this.
---
Should reduce some toxic behaviors.
---
So basically a discount Doc and a bunch of spelling errors?
---
I have this issue too, been searching for a fix do a while. No clue what causes it.
---
Then they die.
---
They really can‚Äôt do anything about dc when a lot of time the game it‚Äôs self disconnects you
---
There's always someone lying in wait in order to cry "toxic" now-a-day. Right up there with hate trains, review bombs, racists, sexists, etc...
---
At least people respect recruit mains.
---
I'd like to see Candyman, ghostface, or the creeper.
---
I dunno the survivors don't have to mend the entire game because of the terror radius.
---
I mean that sounds like shit :(
---
It's detective TrappGod from here on out
---
Ghostface and Sidney please
---
Dread it.
---
Buckle up for salty survivors bitching when the killer opens a gate and sits there waiting for them to try it. 
---
‚ÄúWahhh he‚Äôs supposed to put a blindfold on and stand in a corner on the opposite side of the map!! Not fair wahhhh!!‚Äù
---
Means they rather stare at someone on a hook then actually go put pressure on the map..
---
I'M STILL PRETTY NEW AND JUST PLAYED MY FIRST MATCHES ON 'THE GAME' AND SPIRIT'S MAP.  WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE MAPS?!  
---
I SPENT HALF THE MATCH LOST IN THE MEATPACKING PLANT AND HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO SEE ANYTHING AT YAMAOKA ESTATE?  ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M PLAYING A SHORTY LIKE LEGION
---
When you've been outplayed the whole game, the last thing you need is some cunty survivors staying in after opening the doors just so they can rub it in. Hardly a mild inconvenience, or "nothing to get annoyed over".
---
I think when I play survivor the gens run too slow sometimes when I'm the only one doing them.  When I'm a killer they pop way to fast even with ruin. I always get a easy hook at the start of matches. I can just search near ruin for 30 seconds at the start. It's a joke for slowing down progression because people will just memorize totem spawns. I really want a balanced perk that wont let gens pop like crazy but it wont also be too hard to pop them. Just actual balance. The lower tier killers have it worse with gen pressure they are hit or miss completely. With as fast as they go it encourages things like tunneling because you literally need to take someone out to help slow the game down some towards the middle or near the end of the match.
---
Technically holding the game hostage by blocking is bankable. If you got a pig trap ticking its no hostage. I figure it'd be the same way waiting for the entity to come. Hope they have something for this.
---
I do wish there was some form of consequence for the ones that DC. Just to thin their herd, I've had bad luck with em lately
---
Yeah, survivors have ONE good meta perk, which only activates after three basic attacks. Meanwhile, NOED‚Äôs been left untouched, BBQ‚Äôs been left untouched, and Ruin‚Äôs been left untouched.
---
Hopefully you got far enough in to use the key before it gets down to just you.
---
Uh face camp is dumb but if you leave the hook to go for a t bag viewing that's even dumber.
---
Pretty much. Either way I feel like this was a step or two in the wrong direction with Legion...
---
It's from The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. In that game Link has to bounce around through time to stop the moon from destroying everything in the span of three days. It came out near the time that Ocarina Of Time was released on the N64
---
Oooh &lt;3
---
Is the game and all updates fully installed? I can start the game but not go online when updates are at like 80% on xbox.
---
But you aren‚Äôt holding the game hostage. They made a bad choice. It‚Äôs only hostage when the game can‚Äôt end. Therefore, banning a killer for blocking me inside AFTER collapse would be bad.
---
I almost always get hit through pallets. I could throw one down and the tip of the killer‚Äôs weapon could graze my neck hairs and it would still register as a landed attack.
---
I save mine cus it's more likely to meet a farming killer during a 2x BP event so more chance of getting good use out of my BPS
---
After 45 minutes the killer finally gave up lmao
---
I think so, I bought some DLC after it downloaded before playing, but I'm pretty sure it's all downloaded.
---
Lol 3 minutes, and if there going for a save it's longer than that, looks like it slows down alot when someone is downed/hooked. The altruism will live, don't worry
---
If it starts after the final gen then both the timer being slowed and it being 3 minutes is fair imo, don't need to change everything else.
---
I feel like starting it at the final gen and also not slowing it down on hook might be a bit much especially for newer players.  Or alternatively it makes you think whether to save or GTFO yourself.  I think just one tweak is fine, and I think as it stands it's definitely on the right track
---
I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I find this concept to be interesting. But it definitely feels more killer-sided. Like I said, hopefully they address issues regarding killers holding games‚Äô hostage. Maybe after ten seconds of stillness, collision could be turned off for killers.
---
I can just imagine how annoying the "open 1 gate as survivor" ritual will be if the killer opens the gate instead, I already have to compete with 3 other survivors to get to a gate first, now I gotta worry about the killer getting there before me too?

Han Solo gets aids and dies
---
Nurse is definitely strong enough to play through it, if the killer is skilled, same as spirit, but I take issue with the fact that you'd need to be skilled with nurse for it to matter, whereas the survivor doesn't need to do anything to use their get out of jail free cards. It's very high reward for no skill whatsoever. And I think that survivors shouldn't be that strong on their own, their strength should come primarily from their ability to work as a team. So I'm not saying remove every good perk, I'm saying rework the ones that are basically "fuck you I'm definitely getting out" buttons that destroy almost every killer, sometimes regardless of their build.
---
It sounded to me like the terro4 thing was only during feral frenzy
---
Now we cant teabag at the exit gate
---
When did this change?
---
Dude I always look down my survivors throats when I'm opening the gates. Would be cool if there were guts or something in there.
---
I think he needs a bigger penalty for crashing his chainsaw like leatherface
---
Did think of something tho, if pig were to put a trap on a sluged survivor, and the rest of the survivors left to open the hatch, all pig would need to do is close the hatch, guaranteed kill ü§î
---
Situational but I wonder if Bhvr will change how traps work because of this... Hopefully not tho XD
---
What about with console controls? Also I like Pig and Freddy so who‚Äôs more like them?
---
After each hook, if u missed it first time
---
LOL the ultimate easter egg.
---
Fuck I‚Äôve never heard that before but that‚Äôs pretty accurate
---
I second this. Tru3 has a good spirit
---
I guess I haven‚Äôt seen enough ds after its rework
---
Sooo... I was really excited about this untill I watched the video like 20 times in a row to fully understand how this works... I appreciate that the devs are hearing the complaints about survivors and are taking some form of action. But this is literally pointless. 3 whole minutes? AFTER the gates are open?? In the course of 30 seconds to 1 minute all the survivors are gone when gates open like 90% of the time... I just dont understand why you wouldn't just put the whole match on a general time limit... and why "when the exit gates are opened" does this trigger? The gate is open.. you now have 3 entire minutes to walk 10 feet out of the gate.... I fail to see why you would even go to this amount of effort and publicity for something that will effect maybe 10% of 1 out of 4 survivors... and that's being generous. It's like the fact that most survivors are playing in 3 and 4 pack groups using outside comunication apps was completely over looked in this design... someone please explain to me how this effects anything at all accept that occasional absolute moron who has been hiding in a locker the whole game out of fear because it's there first or second game and they dont know what they are doing.. on a positive note something like this should be implemented and I'm glad the devs are at least in the ball park... There should be a reason to want to escape and survivors shouldn't be able to just gen rush 4 gens in 2 minutes at spawn... however something like this should trigger in a way that has actual meaning like say, when 4 gens are done, or when there are only 1 or 2 survivors left, or just simply after (X) amount of time has passed. This is like taking a kid to an ice cream shop and letting them have 1 sample of their 3rd favorite flavor and then taking them home. WHY EVEN BOTHER? Once again thank you devs for at least trying but this is a major missed opportunity. I truly hope that you see this and you make the changes necessary. This update will affect nothing at all.
---
Also an accurate representation of rank 20s vs anything
---
That game had my favorite zombies. And they were so loopable
---
Honestly he is a bit hot
---
I can't take Chucky seriously, to be honest. Just kick him like he's a red-haired soccer ball. Roll the laugh track and credits.
---
I mean, clearly you‚Äôve misunderstood a lot of the game but let‚Äôs continue with this. So a survivor going out of their way to get you killed- be it dropping pallets on you, leading the killer to you, doing things to notify the killer to your location, etc are all fine because it‚Äôs a free for all? If this is how you play DBD, I pity your teammates.
---
You wish there was a 3rd person
---
But the exit gates can only be powered when all generators are done, so what‚Äôs the point of blocking the generators when the exit gates open??
---
I am honestly not sure if you are trying to troll or if you have not played enough to know the relative speeds. Even with Bamboozle, a killer vault is only as fast as a medium vault. Going around adds extra distance that cancels the higher speed, even with Bloodlust 3. 
---
Infinite loops used to be everywhere. Now, thankfully, there are very few; but they still exist. There is no skill involved in it for a survivor and no mind games possible as killer.

I can't wait for people who don't read patch notes to find out the hard way what the timer and red glowing ground does.
---
Fuck that moon
---
Dead 'ard right past ggez
---
Games literally balanced around 2 people escaping as stated by the devs. Sincerely, shut the fuck up
---
Lol what add ons? Can you pm plz :(
---
Well at least claudette will survive if all goes to hell just find some tall grass and thanos can literally do nothing
---
If the hatch is open when there's more than one survivor to put a trap on, you have a problem.
---
I think of this killer more as a stealth killer. That's why the perks make it harder to track him down. My idea is that survivors do not know when he's using power, so you have to stay alert all the time. He could also be a little faster than most killers, to make it easier during a chase.
---
&gt;&gt;work out any bugs
---
You do know who we‚Äôre talking about right?
---
Rage quitting and being kicked out of the server. My sister and I always duo and she randomly gets kicked from the game for no reason. Same happens to me sometimes.
---
Freddy having to wait with his dick in his hand for 7 seconds after using his power isn't "hate", its fact.
---
Try that unhooking in your face shit in front of Leatherface and you'll catch an ass whooping toot sweet.
---
Oh boy I love shows about mentally Ill 
---
people
---
As i read it the old changes is it will show up when one survivor remains, and it can be closed once it opens. Other then that the hatch will act as it always has.

---
I hated that map but also choose it all the time. I must be a masochist.
---
And I'm gonna laugh when you mess up the timing and get sacrificed.
---
Not entirely. If it's a glitch its unintended. On the other hand this us the second person in a few days that I know of that's made this claim. I must investigate.
---
Oh yeah I'm sure you'll be pretty happy when as soon as the match starts the killer opens the exit gates when you burned a cake. Say goodbye to all those gen repair points.
---
My Kate bugged out so I can't even get botany... I just run bond personally since it saves time
---
Samara and Brenda Meeks
---
Yeah an Easter egg would be cool to see in there as well. Maybe this weekend...
---
Fuck yes.
---
You shut up scrub survivor poontang sniffer
---
yup. had a clown who earlier who very blatantly flipped the switch after I had looped him for 2 gens. wouldn't yah know it he camped too
---
No, it really doesn't i've seen players easily catch up to survivors and have tested it with people. Killer speed equals victory unless you play yourself.
---
No ‚Äúget gud‚Äù means get good enough at killer so you can win even without perks making the trophy easy.
---
I run into so many camping Huntresses and I just don't get why...
---
Yes ;) They cannot tell us that Dwight isn't inspired by Mathieu lol
---
Are you seriously calling out bullies on a video game with no voice chat? Lol. If anything, it will make you a better player
---
A payday killer would be neat. It may be a little odd but I mean this guys have killed a lot of people the entity wouldn't scoff at numbers like that. A payday survivor would be really nice and would fit fine.
---
so does this mean camping basement stairs is even more meta now
---
in the video "both the killer and the survirvor can open the exit gate", but i guess 5 gens should be done by then. But in the video also they talk about gens blocked by the entity in the endgame, which is useless information then?
---
Ok.. no one cares... you got your attention now leave
---
Haha this is true. Its hard as fuck catching some of these survivors out here. Im still new to this game, but Its amazing how many matches ALL 3 survivors come to the rescue at the same time. It literally ruins any chance I have at doing good as a killer when Im against these players.
---
No u
---
They're short wraith with an easier first hit and built in slowdown in exchange for no cloaking. That's not great but it doesn't sound too bad.
---
You can only open the gates when they are powered.
---
Lol is this dude 12? Someone needs to disable the ability for kids to make topics
---
He couldn't even reach a hook. Just flat out no. What're they going to do? Make a shorter hook just so he can put the survivors on it and he tell them to sit and stay still?
---
So basically restrict the character to their three perks and one general perk like borrowed time or whatever. It's not even a bad idea.
---
Yea I hardly ever hit a survivor with feral and leave to find another one
---
That seems so pointless tbh
---
What are the conditions for the entity blocking the gens? Does this only happen when they are powered?
---
Touch√©
---
Agreed, I had a game like this against the Plague and was the last survivor. The hatch spawned on top of a mound and the gates were right next to each other and in close proximity to the Plague giving her a clear view and control of both. I had to give up because there was no way for me to escape, it was nuts.
---
H-How would he hook people?
---
Someone needs to disable your Internet access
---
Honestly, this already happens and the killer can force the survivor to DC if they ever want to leave. At least this puts a timer on the survivors imprisonment
---
Endgame collapse buff.
---
Now it activates with 3 gens left
---
I was waiting for someone to make this meme
---
Ya let's give the killer more of an edge.
---
I want a entity hook mori now instead of a killers mori.
---
I would genuinely contribute advice here if you didnt just self proclaim that you‚Äôre a pro killer. The fucking cringe dude
---
If a survivor being able to tank one extra hit once in the match is enough to ruin your entire game, maybe that's on you.
---
Except this scenario is intentionally setup and will literally never trigger ever. Especially since for whatever reason when a survivor is injured or downed the "endgame phase" slows down, because that makes so much sense.
---
Rank 20 alert
---
Heh, yeah, if I run no mither every other killer is like him.
---
Bro that could be one of his powers lol, he breaks pallets and windows (with a cd or something)
---
It would be Cribs the Dbd Edition
---
The survivor can still open the gates now. The only reason hatch stands off existed is because it was the only chance the survivor had to make it out. Now the hatch is a joke
---
But then the killer just downs you right away and you go right back on. Plus salty people would probably not try to escape and just sit there making the killer wait and extra 2 minutes for the game to end lol.
---
You‚Äôre the only one being snappy, I just replied clarifying what I meant since it wasn‚Äôt clear enough in the post. I don‚Äôt know how you thought that was snappy
---
There was no reason for them to make the end-game begin after a gate is opened. It's so silly. The end game countdown should start a soon as the last gen is done. It seems they just want to give survivors every opportunity to escape.
---
Also Remember Me is getting reworked. Uh oh.
---
But the suspense, slowly opening the gate before hell.
---
Because hes old. Thats genuinely the real reason imo. He was here since the beginning. Everyone is used to the way he is to the point that any rework for him would just be down voted due to mass assimilation of the way hes been. Even then people will argue hes a worse nurse. Nurse needs to be more in line with other killers. I dont mind the blink but the fact she can traverse the map in literally seconds is annoying af. When i fight red rank nurses, its always a bad time
---
The problem with Freddy is that the only viable path for any kind of rework is basically turning him into the doctor. This isn't necessarily awful, as they've managed to make the Hillbilly and Cannibal very different from one another despite obvious similarities. The biggest hurdle for Freddy would be making him different enough from the Doctor to make him a viable alternative, as opposed to a reskin with more faffing about.
---
I guess we just have to wait and see! Im on the fence with this one tho because its adding a whole new mechanic and style to the game
---
Thats not how you came off my guy
---
Why is there random shiz being posted on this subreddit that isn't relevant to dbd
---
Spirit is the way to go. So much fun and the mind games are endless
---
Camping is one thing, facecamping another. I'm talking about the old, rightfully now-removed form of facecamping where the killer would physically block the unhooking prompt, rendering other survivors incapable of saving. This is still possible using the basement stair bodyblock now, and it doesn't just suck, it's a completely undesirable interaction from any reasonable perspective, because it completely denies gameplay.
---
The basement is a plenty dangerous place to save from without the killer being able to bodyblock the stairs. It still only has one entrance/exit, a long choke point, opening a plethora of possibilities to use the various killer abilities to make it significantly more favorable than standard hook save scenarios. If the killer is patrolling or let alone camping it, best case is you get a 1-for-1. Hell, with a slightly wider staircase, bodyblocking survivors for a while would actually be interactive: strafing left and right trying to outmove each other's collision.
---
I see no good reason to not reconsider the basement stairs, given that they enable killers to do some of the absolutely most oppressive things this game knows, in the form of facecamping and holding the game hostage, and now also to abuse the Collapse mechanic.
---
This is PERFECT
---
since about a patch or 2 ago I have seen a super increase of people not making it past the loading screen and A lot of survivors DCing at random. Like they go the exit gates open and were running around trying to help the other survivors and would just drop dead on the spot.
---
Im impressed you even know what disable means
---
I guess this means the Killer can open the exit gate at any point in the match, and this seems like it‚Äôs going to be really bad with the rank system, especially for survivor‚Äôs.
---
Hopefully this gets addressed or something, because not being able to touch generator‚Äôs and only having 2 exit gates to be able to get Lightbringer points, as well as only having 3 minutes to get boldness points between 4 survivor‚Äôs. 
---
And what‚Äôs the benefit in it for Killer‚Äôs if they open the exit gates very early? Would it mean less chance for chases and hooks, while having more pallets. Does it give them gold/iridescent in preventing generator‚Äôs from going being activated too fast?
---
It‚Äôll be very interesting to see.
---
Of course I do. I'm reminded every time I look at your mom
---
No but when you get trolled all game by a swf with a rank 2 and youre rank 15 the last you want is to show up at the exit to get mass tea bagged on top of it. Im not even kidding there was a game where they all tea bagged all game and i couldnt do shit and i thought NO i aint going to the exit to get tea bagged. They stayed in the game looking for me on the map for 35 minutes.
---
Haha that was more of a sarcastic joke. I wiuldn‚Äôt actually say that if I was pro. I do get lots of hits and hooks, but these rank 8s are hard as fuck to kill all 4. 
---
Honestly... i‚Äôd rather de-rank than face these try hards lol. Its no fun having to camp hooks and play nurse just to keep up with these dudes that have 1000+ hours....
---
Why are all patriots fans like this
---
Salty killer alert. Lose one to many loops there salty pants.
---
Well I‚Äôm not gonna apologize because you misunderstood my message ‚Äúmy guy‚Äù
---
Ask the Doctor. We also have a Nurse.
---
Is this not related?
---
I've been waiting on this meme to arrive since the post went up, thanks for not letting me down :)
---
Can the killer open the gate before the gens are all powered?
---
Stress maybe? Heart races while playing
---
Why are we assuming this makes the end game balanced? Can we wait till we play it first? Seems kinda premature to just call it fun and balanced.
---
Well it is an asymmetrical multiplayer game so.. yeah
---
It‚Äôs like you cleansed haunted grounds by that fuck up XD
---
Didnt ask you too. Nor is it my misunderstanding. You present a message. How its perceived is up to the perciever. As far as it stands to me, you come off very passive aggresive

RIP the Jake who got hit by it

Jason although it won‚Äôt likely ever happen
---
Sadly most killers arent balanced for rank 1 swfs. Only nitse hillbilly spirit and sometimes huntress have a chance. Personally i love looping a huntress. Even if shes a sniper. Her base speed is so slow and the fact she slows even more to wind it up is just funny. I just crouch when ever she finally chucks the dam thing and it hits the loop instead 99/100
---
This is too fucking good, sis.

I just want gatekeeper changed. It's sort of dumb the game can claim you weren't pressuring gens enough in a match where literally 70% of the round time was spent on the last gen.
---
I know I arguably wasn't pressuring them enough if they got popped quick, (As doc I try to let gens far away get done while prioritizing clusters of gens close together) but if they were stuck on the last gen for 20+ minutes in a 3-gen scenario, and they went from having 3 or 4 survivors to me sacrificing all of them or the last guy getting the hatch, how is that worthy of a silver or bronze emblem? 
---
I feel like the change punishes 3-genning too harshly. I don't think I'm entitled to an iridescent gatekeeper emblem automatically, but it's annoying for the game to declare I wasn't pressuring gens enough when the majority of the round was on the last 3 gens which I defended extremely vigorously.
---
No joke like a week ago I said Sony sucks for not adding in the feature to change your name. 5 hours later it drops. I swear to god I‚Äôm physic but I have no idea what I could do with this power.
---
Aren't all 'endgame' perks going to be looked at due to the collapse?
---
Do you people not realize how bad this update is going to be? Especially for killers? You can get all 5 gens in under 3 minutes!! You have to literally OPEN THE GATES to trigger this affect. And when you open the gates theres a giant bright HIGHLIGHT OF WHERE THE GATES ARE! WAKE UP KILLERS! This shit is stupid!
---
Myers, you let that mildly cute catfish keep their name!
---
I was being dead serious.
---
Can you fix Were Gonna Live Forever now that you made this change for killer?
---
Lol how cringey
---
Once EGC starts, Hook 1 person in basement, 1+ survivors go down for save.
---
All you need to do is stand at the top of the stairs and anyone down there is screwed. Before they can at least bumrush out and you probably won't get all, not to mention you still have to make an effort to somehow stop them.
---
With the EGC  you just trap them down there until the entity takes care of things.
---
Not as creepy as your mom
---
How would that be balanced? This situation would rarely occur because bloodwarden will usually activate at the beginning of the end game collapse and when a survivor is hooked, the timer drastically slows down
---
Possibly motion sickness. My ex had the same issue with some games
---
OMG lol I have a good idea to what to do with this sensitivity of yours lmao. Have a good day and happy easter
---
Or don't butcher this potential fun use of bloodwarden.
---
You have 3 minutes, now sing for your lives... and don't fuck it up.
---
Also 3 minutes is too long lol...
---
Survivor or Killer?
---
I like the changes both as survivor and killer. If you demolish a team you can close the hatch which rids of hatch stand offs and makes the game interesting to patrol two gates instead which increases fun and doesn't slog the game down to a crawl.
---
As a survivor it teaches you to not be so altrustic. Sometimes you just gotta accept that teammates will die. You pay the price by dying to the killer, losing time, or getting surprised by Blood Warden. Also if survivors or the killer open the gate, there's basically nothing stopping you from leaving besides yourself.
---
yeah the second the last gen is done it should clock on... 3 minutes is way too long.
---
Not sure about console controls, but I can say personally I like plague better, has some cool mechanics
---
You could also watch Monto on YouTube. His spoopy spirit videos are awesome.
---
That's why you look at the ping if the ping is not consistent as in it jumps from 100 to 300 and back and keeps having big jumps like that than the match is going to be a laggy .
---
I think there's a problem here in that there's a disconnect between killers and survivors.   
---
For every BBQ &amp; Chili, there's a Sprint Burst + Adrenaline + Decisive Strike. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Both sides deal with their own toxicity, especially early on when they're not experienced in dealing with aggressive survivors/strategic killers. And so they adopt solid builds and strategies so they don't have to deal with that ever again. Be it T-Bagging at Exit Gates, or facecamping on a hook. Regardless, someone's gonna lose in the equation. That's just how it is. 
---
I think the best thing to remember is that whoever you're going against has, and will have great games and terrible games. So whether or not they win is just a drop in the pond, I know you're dealing with some sweaty try-harding killer mains. But just remember that we're all in the same boat, dealing with the same crap, they'll win one day, and lose the next day. Sometimes, that really is how it do.
---
I mean I play pig like that anyway
---
All the fog whisperers are under NDA but they're all happy.. lol they're all exited cos it was something new, not something good. 3 fucking minutes? Way to long
---
I‚Äôd orefer something like Divine in that one John Waters movie. Buffalo Bill was a transphobic stereotype so transphobic that they had to add dialogue to the movie explaining that, unlike actual trans people, he is actually pathologically insane.
---
oh man, they buffed my beautiful pig. My endgame build will be even more terrifying than it is now.
---
The guy standing is Young Thug and the other is Lil Durk
---
lol
---
happy cake day :D
---
Left:
---
Feng: That killer... won't vault the window at all, huh...
---
\*Jason breaks through\*
---
Trapper: Soooo.... You can't just break the windows around here, so next time *vault it*.
---
Right: 
---
Feng: Earlier was surprising, but it must have been a bamboozle bug or something.
---
Trapper: You can't break the walls either! I'm the one who has to fix it, you know!
---
r/cursedimages
---
I suspect the killer opening the gates really early will be the equivalent to a concession. The survivors probably get a bucket load of emblem points for it happening.
---
Opening the gate later might be more a tactical choice for some killers, especially peppa pig.
---
I'm just pointing out that you appear to have a lack of knowledge about the two sides of this game. With the exception of the killer playing the Nurse, If you were to pair one of the top killer players with 4 of the top survivor players way more often than not at least 3 survivors will escape. And even if the killer manages to get a potato team and kill 3 people the 4th still gets a free hatch escape. So complaining that they are "Giving the killer and more of an edge" by removing the hatch standoff, which by the way they can still escape through hatch if they find it first, and adding a 3 minute timer to escape which slows down while survivors are slugged/hooked is just you whining. They reduced the chances for a survivor to get a free escape and that's about it. that 3 minute timer, which gets slowed down, is a huge amount of time and over all wont have much impact on the endgame.
---
I just hope its not MTV Ghostface.

---
Ohhh yeah.
---
it can't be right. the crows trigger is measured by areas you're in. Crows will be spawned if you stay in the same area without doing anything connected with bloodpoints gain. If you want to prevent crows you need to move around so the same area rule protects you, it's not enough to walk in circle in one place or spam emotes
---
I know that most of the games mark people as AFK as a simple action check, but here it is more complicated, you can get marked by crows when you are for example hatch camping for long enough
---
That‚Äôs super true, but I think it heavily promotes tension for both sides. A killer is striding around the map constantly hunting for the hatch, this will promote a survivor to make much haste as well. Going back to the roots of the game and promoting a much more horrific atmosphere.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
*screams in denizens and lava *
---
I played on both sides, and yeah, toxic assholes on both sides. I stopped playing killers because most survivors I've had to play are cunts about it.
---
After thinking about this, 98 percentage is too high and maybe T should be a ratio based off of healthy vs non instead of a flat percentage increase? What do you think.

---
So what now I HAVE to run bloodwarden on every killer or I will lose? This update is garbage... it's literally just a time limit on how long survivors can T bag at the exit gates. It becomes more clear every day that either the devs dont actually play this game or they all hard main survivor. I'm just waiting for the update that give all survivors a mini gun they can use to just murder the "killer"
---
Lul
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of the Endgame collapse thing. Is to avoid griefing assholes who just don‚Äôt fucking leave the match after opening the gates.
---
I‚Äôm hoping they have more of a violent interaction rather than tugging it down. Such as simply just smashing the lever or using their abilities to tug it offs
---
It's always been a killer sided subreddit but not by a huge margin. I myself am guilty of being Survivor biased as I played solely survivor and got to R1 before deciding to get into Killer, and even then I mostly played Killer for the bloodpoints. (Using R1 as a metric of time, not experience)
---
Lately I decided to level up Nurse and learn how to play her. I'm hoping this experience will give me a more rounded viewpoint of the game.
---
It is probably good for the game that it is killer sided because it helps maintain a good rising/falling tension for the game for the killer to get a big burst in pressure when the gates are open.
---
Currently the gates being open is so survivor sided I know many killers literally just afk. This makes it so there is room for the killer to make one big push to end the game because it becomes realistic for them to actually take a player out.
---
The system also is interesting because it internally balances for player count: a 4 man team might be able to just get everyone out anyway, while as survivors get whittled away it becomes more and more likely the killer nabs one on the way out, which is, again, good because it creates more tension, gives the endgame more of an 'arc,' and encourages survivors to be a little more selfish which was always an intentional design choice.
---
They basically blatantly ripped this off from Deathgarden, and Deathgarden's endgame is unironically probably the best part of it because instead of the end of the match being a boring obligation for all involved the fact that if you go down you *will* die but also everyone is slipping away from the killer player means the last few minutes are appropriately intense and a frenzy.
---
I feel like for this to work a lot need to be reworked. 
---
I like the idea but now things like NOED and blood warden will need to be reworked.
---
Also now the pig will be buffed too much. 
---
Open the gate, trap survivors, patrol jigsaw boxes until time runs out.
---
Internet and crashes as well as voluntary dcs, if you're playing like a dick. And once one person dcs other people are a lot more likely to DC, esp if you keep playing aggressively.
---
Surprising if you consider all the backlash for the legion changes.
---
Either or, i guess I would prefer killer
---
Duuuud*
---
Hey Everyone! So I'm a bit stupid and I have a couple of notes about this endgame collapse that I don't really understand so if anyone could explain it would be gladly appreciated :)  
---
Firstly, with regards to the hatch, I'm not really sure I understand the whole 'closing the hatch system' The way it works now is that, when (# of survivors remaining + 1) gens are completed than the hatch will spawn. However, the hatch doesn't actually OPEN until there is only one survivor remaining. The only way this process can be changed is with the use of a key to open a hatch that has already spawned even if there are still multiple survivors. So my question is, is this same system still in use with this new endgame feature? I got a bit confused by the video and couldn't tell if the hatch was opening at a different point in the game now or if follows the same procedure that I've laid out. The only difference in terms of hatch spawn and opening times is that now the hatch spawns and opens when there is only one survivor left, regardless of the number of generators completed. Am I correct that this is the only change?  
---
Secondly, with regards to the first point, if the killer closes the hatch on the last survivor is their only chance of escaping by opening the exit gates? I feel like this could cause an issue with gates that spawn relatively close to each other, but it may just be my misunderstanding of the new feature.  
---
And finally (sorry that is so long!), they mentioned in the video that once the endgame collapse is initiated, then the generators will be blocked off by the entity. Since this phase can only be initiated once the gates are powered and able to be opened (which means that all generators are completed) or the hatch is closed, does this actually serve any purpose? Why would the survivors want to interact with the generators if it was not necessary?  
---
Anyway, these are all my questions. I'm really sorry if I sound dumb haha.
---
As long as MoM is a constant run meta you'll see this. And for anyone bitching that Billy is "op", play him for a few hours and you'll quickly see how easy it is to juke a saw.
---
Your an Entity send! Thank you!
---
Would you mind translating the one from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/beio2g/jason_fails_to_see_the_intricacies_of_dbd_gameplay/) as well?
---
I think it going down in quarters for survivors would be good. That way if they decide to troll during the last 45 seconds, they might take a little too long to leave, and justice will be served.
---
Oh yeah!!
---
It's not that everyone loves Legion. Everyone asked for balance, not for them to be completely gutted. It's the same situation that happened with Freddy. Now everyone is gonna have to deal with what happens to him now.
---
Autodidact?
---
Doctor.  He's easy to pick up and play, is arguably viable at high ranks, earns bloodpoints like crazy, and will mine some serious salt. 
---
I've been a doctor main for almost 400 hours and I feel like he's underestimated. He also works well with a variety of builds, and it feels great how much pressure you can put on survivors by existing.
---
+1 for getting that right.  Too many people screw it up.  But not you.  Oh no, not you.
---
How the hell did she get on the roof?
---
No one would be getting any points at that rate lmaooooooo the killer would fuck themselves out of points and any addons too while I lose a 4K BP offerinf and escaping gives 5k ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î Who really lost here? Plus I can literally just go next game while the killer de-pips cause almost no hooks, no chases, no lightbringer and only three minutes to score hits for Malicious? 
---
But yes, that poor one escape cake, [damn](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bog_Laurel_Sachet) [I](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fresh_Bog_Laurel) [guess](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Bog_Laurel) [I‚Äôll](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Crispleaf_Amaranth_Sachet) [have](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fresh_Crispleaf_Amaranth) [to](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Crispleaf_Amaranth) [use](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Primrose_Blossom_Sachet) [one](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fresh_Primrose_Blossom)  [of](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Primrose_Blossom) [the](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sweet_William_Sachet) [other](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fresh_Sweet_William) [15](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Sweet_William) [bloodpoints](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sealed_Envelope) [offerings](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bound_Envelope) Or Just Bloody Party Streamers.

---
I think someone earlier made mention of them taking away the ability to grab someone from hatch, which sort of eliminates the stand off aspect if the survivor is able to creep up to the hatch and just run in. But honestly idk.
---
Oh, I already play doctor the most out of killers, I meant to say for the paid DLC characters
---
Let‚Äôs save up our bear traps! Time we make these games more interesting!

Can you fix the We're Gonna Live Forever perk for survivor not receiving tokens when you should have?
---
Oh shit sorry, didn't see the top text my bad
---
I think the only person who had a stroke here was OP
---
Oh, you‚Äôre bullying me instead of leaving the game?
---
‚ÄúNo no I‚Äôm fine just need to mix up some tonic‚Äù
---
I hadn‚Äôt read that. That would work for survivor but would effectively give free hatch if the survivor approaches uninjured, so killer wouldn‚Äôt have a chance. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what they do.
---
I mean winning isnt the hard part its the fact you have to two pip which is basically impossible without abnormal gameplay. you need 9 hooks (can only afford to let a survivor skip a hook 3 times), need to prevent gun rush without ruin, thanat, or any slowdown perks for at least 9 min for iridescent gatekeeper (can only lose 2 gens in this time and still get iridescent), can't insta down with chainsaw or mori cause you lose crucial chase points and survivor hit points (try getting iridescent chaser without them rushing you), oh yeah and if you win too hard and they get salty and dc thats a minimum one hook state loss and lots of chase points.
---
Billy‚Äôs that know how to flick will obliterate you. A good billy is the scariest thing in this game.
---
There's a big gay and drag following for this game. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
‚ÄúGet gud‚Äù
---
AFAIK licensed DLC (Leatherface, Myers, Freddy, etc.) characters can't be bought with shards, only by buying the DLC or with auric cells IIRC.
---
Are you on PS4? That might be why. IIRC I think either nurse or huntress was made a DLC killer but Doctor is free on PS4. On PC it's the other way around. I don't know, then. Personally I'd get BBQ on the shrine for your doctor with the shards. 
---
Anyways I'm not sure which other killer to get. I wouldn't recommend Legion due to the changes (Major nerfs) he's receiving. Maybe Hag if you don't have Hex: Ruin? I have Clown and I don't like him, maybe because I spent so many hours as doc I can't find survivors as well without the screaming and stalling doc gives me.
---
Hmmmmm‚Ä¶ This should help out a lot. Thank you.
---
Obvious lagswitch
---
&gt; it's literally just a time limit on how long survivors can T bag at the exit gates
---
Yeah...that's the point. It's to keep survivors from immersing for 10 minutes instead of leaving.
---
Fair point
---
I might have misunderstood but I‚Äôm pretty sure it said closing the hatch opens the gates
---
I didn‚Äôt even tbag or anything. He then called me a noob3 wanna be.
---
So is the perk left behind going to get a rework or is that garbage perk going to become even more useless after the end game patch?
---
then we have the other end of the spectrum where mrs p3 clicky clicky gets caught and dcs cause they lost chase and call you boosted
---
If they made more perks viable for both sides we would have more difference builds
---
k thnx
---
This is getting out of hand! Noe there are 2 of them!
---
not really. if they trigger the gates, all 4 are alive and they have been t-bagging and BMing whole game, you can be sure as shit that I'm not gonna go to the exit gate watch their show. 
---
Right now they will just stay FOREVER until I finally come to the gate to watch them gloat and force them to exit, after the patch if I know I already lost I can just go for a smoke, make a coffe, whatever, after 3 minutes they will either be dead (if they're really, really stupid) or they leave the game
---
its not going to change anything gameplay wise, maybe except that people will be more scared to save after gates open, but I am looking forward to not having games taken hostage.
---
I will be one of these killers that will open the gates for them just to make them leave and give me my bp if it means I dont have to look at toxic SWFs. Just make sure to afk in a corner facing the wall, so they can't farm chase points on you
---
What a total waste of recources. They could have solved the problem naturally by balancing the game and making survivors not OP. Instead they give the survivors a 2:59 time window to be toxic assholes as hard as they can and then escaping. This will only make it worse.
---
Combo with Wake Up for ultimate gate open zoom action
---
Ahh, I thought hatch spawn automatically blocked the remaining gens &amp; started the count down. Ok, I can work with that haha.
---
The only times I double pip are when I tunnel 2 people and get them out ASAP.
---
So hook someone, run away, come back and hit the person trying to unhook them. Now you have 2 people on a hook, or possibly an injured original hook. Just keep rehooking those first 2 people every time they get off.
---
Once you're down to 2 people hook them each once or twice if they're not going quickly, then slug a bitch and find his friend. Ez double pip. Break all pallets. Kick gens if you feel like it.
---
Doesn't look a whole lot like clocktown to be honest
---
Survivors tbagging at the gate? Time to find a cat to pet.
---
Maybe at higher ranks, but around low/mid-tier games you can double pip by camping because everybody and their momma wants to unhook a bitch in your face.
---
Tbh I haven't seen that film for ages but yeah now that I think about it, he does play on some pretty transphobic ideas
---
And brutal. It's one thing for the Entity to stab you multiple times, but that animation where the survivor is struggling and then a CRUNCH and the body just twists...yeesh. And then since you'd still be alive with a snapped spine so you can't fight back anymore, then the Entity finishes you off with a stab right in the brain.
---
No worries. I do think endgame collapse is the most important thing we could be talking about though. Any thoughts?
---
Yeah, I'd notice if only one loaded in though? Plus the gens were at 2. I think there's just been a lot of hostile killers on PS4 lately.
---
If I were him I would have let the survivor go after some chases and the like, but that's me.
---
Would Wake Up seem more viable now? I *Hope* so
---
Even if he is dead, he is still my main. I'd buy a plush like that.
---
I agree.
---
The only thing that should have changed was hatch.
---
Killer shouldn't be punished for closing it.
---
Its very biased against killers.
---
End game should be 2 min if anything. So survivor have the rush panic that killers always have to deal with.
---
They literally undid any improvement to the gane with the extra rules.
---
I thought about this, but more frail killers would look ridiculous doing that.  Imagine Freddy yanking on the steel plates to open the doors.  I dont think any single killer is strong enough to rip open those doors physically.
---
Did you try switching to the other side. Killer stresses me out so bad I get stomach aches too while survivor is usually super chill and fun. For the record i definitely thought it would be the opposite when i got this game.
---
people commenting on this saying "but x is true" is really funny to me like. buddy. this post? it's about you. you fools. this post is making fun of you and you come into my home and comment on my post with the things i say in my post? foolish. no one will believe you here in this realm, mortal. i am the queen of this specific post and thou shalt bow before me
---
That's literally all I've wanted to change from the hatch standoff! Whoever gets there first wins. Survivor can jump in with no grabs, and Killer can just close it. Standoff negated.
---
What would you do to fix it?
---
Fucking stupid
---
Did I do something wrong?
---
its a joke, and 9/10 games the killer is afk for me
---
This is nightmare fuel
---
The killer should be Trixie Mattel, and her mori would be the ability to curb stomp survivors
---
No your post just made no sense
---
Simply not reward them the sacrifice points to encourage the killer to also be as on edge as the survivors and work for it like the survivors have to.
---
Why on earth would it take you more than 3 minutes to leave through an open gate?
---
This looks incredible. I am extremely excited to check this out. 
---
No more boring hatch standoffs.
---
No more looking for a Blendette hiding when she's the last alive and only one gen was completed.
---
No more waiting for survivor(s) to leave after they already won, just to tbag at the exit.
---
Not really, on PS4 Ash is between Ace and Feng

I did that twice in a row, both times getting two kills after the gates were opened (people already escaped).
---
I just had a great game against a billy. Killed 1 and slugged two with 1 gen left. He‚Äôs comin to me, i pop the gen. Slug has adrenaline and picks up the other. He‚Äôs turned around doesn‚Äôt know what to chase. I open the door we all get out.
---
This is my stance pretty much to. I'll never single someone out just to tunnel them but If you enter my line of sight and I decide you're the easier prey I'm coming for you.
---
It's always fun to get those tunneling/camping accusations. No my friend, you healed right under the hook while your buddy ran off. Back on you go.
---
I always see Huntresses rocking the bear outfit
---
Trapper and Wraith definitely need new moris!
---
I never said it wouldn't..
---
I was just wondering how I could help my team as much as possible.
---
Never had a game where it took survivors 3 minutes to leave. Some may wait for me to try and drive them out at the other exit door, but some people do that to t-bag others do it to get a few last chase points and crap. Take awhile those last points and that's one less reason to hang around. Go get a drink. Walk around for 30 seconds. Get off your ass and use the restroom rather than the Gatorade bottle and by the time you come back the survivor will have gotten bored of waiting at the exit. In less than 3 minutes.
---
I wouldnt say give nothing because i have chased people for 4+ minutes being looped and 360ed. I was working hard to then it just be snatched away by the entity for nothing? I would say give like 25%of the normal bloodpoints of getting a sacrifice
---
Down someone, open gate, hook with bloodwarden active, ez clap
---
Just run support perks and be a gen jockey
---
The rest of the changes I'm on board with, but yeah, killers shouldn't be rewarded for not finding  survivors.
---
And no, I'm not a survivor main. I play both
---
Same a Legion plush would def be cool Legion has my fave look of the killers
---
It's not camping when the prey happily leaps into your mouth. That's just natural selection.
---
Definitely get the kitty mask and her samurai getup. As a personal aside, I never buy weapons even though it's the only part I see. It saves some shards/cells and it's not as distracting
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen it a lot.  Do you think it looks best? 
---
I just can‚Äôt decide lol, all of her auric cell outfits and even the cat are nice
---
soo.. do u like this ideas?
---
Lol
---
You're basically trading one "end-game" (Hatch standoff, which won't be a thing period if they really will remove the hatch-grab) for another. (Shut the hatch, which powers the gates up and allows the survivor to escape that way if the killer doesn't get him first)

I do see the hatch stand-off still being a thing but in a different manner. As Survivor, if I'm the last man standing I'll probably go to one of the gates and hide. Killer will go close the hatch, and once he does that I'll be right in front of the switch and can hopefully get it open and leave by the time the killer can reach it. (Might not work against doc as you can't open a gate in madness 3, and as Doc I often try to get everyone in 3 as often as possible)
---
As Killer, I'll likely wait at the hatch for the survivor to go near, and then shut it, hopefully being close enough to get him. 
---
So I think game-play wise the "hatch standoff" will still exist, in the form of a hypothetical does the killer close the hatch and power the gate the survivor is right next to, or does he go search for the gate (Killer's can't see gate auras until the doors are powered) and leave the hatch unguarded?
---
I still think it's an improvement though.
---
One other thing, the hatch now ALWAYS spawns for the last survivor. Normally (At least in a full 4 survivor team) 2 gens have to be completed. Now it'll always spawn even if no gens were done.
---
Exactly how I feel I was fine until they said the killer gets free bloodpoints for something they failed to do :/
---
Thank you, sorry for the confusion.
---
Ooo interesting.  Looks good together huh?
---
Someone tweeted a dev asking if Pig would get any changes and he replied yes, ‚Äúa logical one‚Äù. I‚Äôm not so sure that strategy will work.
---
The third guy had burned a white ward with an ultra rare add on but still lost it cause of Franklin‚Äôs Demise.
---
They are changing something with Pig though, not sure what but a dev tweeted it.
---
I'm talking about the add on's ability to break pallets by vaulting them, which will now have less utility since Legion has less reason to chase a wounded survivor while their power is active.
---
That doesn‚Äôt seem like a very good way to change someone‚Äôs mind
---
Rofl, that‚Äôs rough
---
They're just skilled players of course you're not gonna get much points if you've been beaten. A sacrifice is still a sacrifice and being rewarded for not doing it seems backwards.
---
Aw shit, here we go again
---
Not combined, but the kitty mask must never be passed up
---
Ah the classic "it's not overpowered you're just bad" retort. I don't have many issues with the perk myself, I mainly play survivor or myers. It's incredibly arrogant to act like one extra hit in this game doesn't matter, because it clearly does for players at all ranks, and it makes me think you don't actually have much experience as killer or survivor playing with the perk. Obviously it's more powerful in the end game, but if you have midgame MoM, it's still extra loops you can do, and there's nothing most of the killers can do about that. 
---
Are you really telling me that a survivor being pulled off a hook with adrenaline and MoM puts the killer in a fair situation? And, second question, you do understand that this is supposed to be an asymmetrical survival horror game, right? Follow up, why do you think it's justified that survivors should have two perks whose mere existence objectively make it harder for most killers in the game to be considered viable, considering the previous question?
---
I like to keep it simple with bloody axe and body, with the bigass hog mask from lunar event. Just gives off a vibe yknow
---
I agree. I think if bE did eventually add new game modes, it could encourage killer and survivors to bring different perks that are better for the gamemode. Until then it'd probably be better to encourage people on this sub to try interesting builds like monto does
---
Well it was more lore filling then anything the entity sees im trying hard and giving a good show so he helps me out but i only got 25 percent or whatever even 5 percent because he had to intervene and doesnt want the trial to drag on and get boring
---
Don't get me wrong he will be fine in the long run just less playable on the killer side which historically hasn't been a problem. I just hope there is a tradeoff where now Freddy gets some love and maybe legion will get some balance later on. I also kinda want to see trapper get the ability to carry two traps at a time without addons so I won't hold my breath.
---
Haha, sounds cool
---
Gangbang time
---
Well, we know how the devs adjusting the killers has gone in the past.
---
I play mostly as the pig so I hope they can find a good balance without her being too buffed or nerfed.
---
So wait, they don‚Äôt look good combined? 
---
Wear the kitty mask with her regular outfit? And the samurai gear with her bunny mask?
---
Bold of you to use that form of dude.
---
They must of destroyed all your totems, believe me this perk works, there‚Äôs a reason everyone hates it.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying too hard to look smart I was just seeing how mad people would get if I said that
---
dressing up like the opposite gender and acting like a clown is mental illness, there is nothing to add to that statement, denying what i just said is like supporting flat-earthers
---
Would spine chill increase it as well?
---
Explain how.
---
Well since shards can only get you original characters, pick up Spirit.
---
I hear Civ 5 is pretty good
---
This was my favorite out of all maps until buried came out.  It was massive!
---
I think it is a mix of both. Collapse is actually a very clever word for it because the realm the entity has created for the trial is literally collapsing and forcing the survivor into the next trial. It is said lore wise after all that the entity is all in the realm they are in, and when the trial collapses it returns to its primordial state devouring the survivors quickly and sending them back to the campfire.
---
Maybe subtract points? Nothing huge, but say 150 for the first, then 250 for second,  350 for third,  450 for fourth.
---
If you miss 1, then it's less because maps are big. But if you can find and kill 1 of a group, then that's on you.
---
Hopefully this‚Äôll get rid of hatch stand offs
---
Honestly considering its name left behind or something it could even be neat if the perk is more based around getting everyone out of the trial first through some sort of buff or perk, at the detriment that you as Bill or the perk user cant leave until some condition is met (a timer is completed, everyone escapes, or everyone dies). Maybe some form of Endurance or something, something that encourages bill to block and take hits for other survivors by being way harder to down himself, at the cost that he cant leave the trial.
---
Wow............. I hate this
---
But if the killer has bloodwarden, they can see it from anywhere.
---
Cool m8. No need to take it so hard, it‚Äôs a joke not a dick.
---
From the lore I read it seems more like the killers don't have a say in it and are forced there as much as the survivors so I'd expect it wouldn't reward failure since it feeds of the killers success.
---
I did this as trapper the other night and it felt so good. Hooked the last survivor right next to the hatch, placed a trap nearby, opened the closest locker, and found a hidden Claudette. Very satisfying!
---
Ok cool?
---
I mean im still gonna dodge a lobby with four bloody Claudettes each trained in gorrila tactics armes with state of the art flash lights
---
I suspect bad survivors will benefit from it more. Consider this: currently, if three survivors get killed without a single generator being fixed, the last one has almost no way out. And rightfully so; clearly they and their team were shot, and wasted opportunities to fix gens. But now, the hatch spawns anyway, so they either use it as a free no danger escape, or the killer closes it, powering the gates for them. The last survivor is thus rewarded for being crap while the killer was good.
---
I want a perk with that icon
---
It also needs to play the theme "Skin on your teeth" from Left 4 Dead when the perk activates.
---
Pig mains oinking in the fog over these changes
---
Survivor: I will either unendingly loop you, or will stun you long enough to just get another pallet 
---
Killer: guess I‚Äôll die
---
This adds a lot to the survivors incentive.
---
A lot of survivors get really upset when they get randoms that suck and don't do gens, everyone feels cheated.
---
Now even if the killer is doing really well the remaining survivor has a chance to escape which means there are more options for selfish playstyles.
---
Time for Spooky game
---
Yes
---
I like the bear head with glowing outfit and lunar event axe. Just my opinion though
---
I think you need to come back when you have a more intelligent conversation to make. 'm8'
---
Then wtf is your problem?
---
S√≠
---
Its almost like the way survivors are supposed to win is by doing 5 gens then going through the exits and the hatch is ment to be a last resort that now actually has fair counterplay for killer side.
---
I could ask you the same thing. Jeez.
---
So are characters who speak. No one gives a shit.
---
Why should a killer get punished for not finding a bloody Claudette crouched in the darkest pace known to man?
---
Insta? Holy shit. It took me 15m to find a lobby today. And the host dc'd because one survivor didn't press "ready"
---
As is your right!
---
I wish we could preview multiple different pieces together lol
---
That sounds cool though. You don‚Äôt happen to have a screenshot by chance do ya?
---
A speaking character isn't a plot hole..
---
Haha no I just thought it was funny. Wasn't trying to sound rude :)
---
All I can hear is "Fight me, big masked man! Please kill me!!"
---
Is now a good time to say I've never played a Persona game?
---
Why? I personally thought hatch standoff was rather stupid. (Although close hatch vs look for survivor might not be much better, it's still an improvement compared to "Whoever jumps/hits first, loses")
---
The timer thing I like. There's no reason for the survivors to hang around once gens are done. It's possible for a survivor to go hide and stealth around the killer until the killer gives up and DCs because the survivor is sneaking far away from the gates, always on the move so no crows, etc. and refuses to leave. 
---
If they don't open the gate, the killer can do it manually and start the countdown for them if all 4 are doing it.
---
Fix that shit
---
Huh i guess its been a while since i read the lore but i get where ur coming from n tbh i dont really care if we get bp or not because i no longer have worry about p3 claudettes hiding for 15 minutes and then deciding to get the hatch =] also ignore the douchebag who said "its a joke not dick" what a asshole
---
So what you're really saying is nerf wake up?
---
He look like a lil cookie. 
---
I like this.
---
All in favor of Hello Zepp during collapse
---
And why not? Struggle points?
---
You killed legion. Now entity kills you
---
My bad, thought this was a shitpost, not something anyone would be serious about lmao
---
LOL. "Hey, you're ignoring me!" Survivor falls in front of you in basement stairs to teabag, and you just bodyblock him until the timer runs out.
---
Time for the Iridescent/Ebony combo.
---
I was thinking it would be just that. Using a Key to open and escape through the hatch will potentially cause an Early EndGame for the rest of the Survivors if the Killer closes it.
---
According to something I saw, Herman carter is actually African American.
---
üò≠ rude
---
I don't know what you mean. Why would it matter from a survivor side how much "credit" the killer gets for the kill? If the killer managed to delay  the survivors long enough that they die to the entity this way then it is earned and if a survivor is playing poorly enough that they don't make it out that is on them and the killer should get full credit. Otherwise I could just hide behind a rock until I die then the killer gets screwed.
---
*Laughs in Carter's Spark with Iridescents*
---
restricting the perks is not the answer. maybe they could just make perks with better incentives. bbq is precious and considered a staple on many killers bc the auras plus its great for farming. if they made other perks like that you would see more variety, but thats just me throwing ideas around. 
---
but ruin and bbq both have counters atleast.
---
i am curious if your still seeing the same amount of ruin? ive been more often seeing corrupt intervention.
---
n i c e
---
Its from all the toxicity Building up in your system. Can i suggest some of my essential oils for a good cleanse.
---
I've found a few of them it's sneaky but not impossible. You can't be rewarded if you don't try that's ridiculous.
---
Honestly, get a good headset if you don‚Äôt have one already. You need the surround sound. Spirit requires you to pay attention. 
---
For advice; when I play v spirit I will run when you are phasing to get me and then walk back over my tracks. I purposely make my scratch marks misleading. 
---
Crank up the volume! Enjoy the sounds of the game and you will have a blast. One of the best killers in the game!
---
"i wanna get scmmed nd banned in 1 go, anyone can help?"
---
Sloppy Butcher is the perfect perk for Negan.
---
Makes the survivors bleed a lot and the perk has a "little pig, little pig" as the icon.
---
How would I go about sending one to you
---
Not sure how mank folks are aware but on ps4 you can hold ps button and it'll lock you into whatever you're doing (walking/running, doing gens/healing, crouching, etc.)
---
Ok bye then.
---
All right... Whats to stop killers waiting at the hatch for a survivor only to close it and get a near guarantee kill?
---
Not sure lol, maybe discord or uploaded to imgur or something XD
---
And they would get triggered by "FOOKIN DEAD HARD!"
---
I always use my body/axe and Hound mask... I also really like the glow-y outfit.
---
no worries I am just curious if there are legit accounts
---
not true
---
This isn't about staying to taunt I don't do that. Not everyone leaves their team to die so they're gonna be punished for being bad team members which contradicts the point of using perks for bonus points for going back for your team. And I've gone back and had people come back to take me off the hook while being camped and managed to have us all still escape..

Oh my gosh thank you! I had no idea it was like this.
---
Nurse: *wheezing laugh*
---
Not everyone doesn't get there in 3 minutes because they're breathing on the finish line some people go back and help their team and it's only fair a killer doesn't get points for something they didn't do just like survivors don't get points if they don't escape.
---
Anybody else think we're about to get a huge spike in usage of Bitter Murmur? Close the hatch so all gens are automatically popped and then get the survivor's aura.
---
Can't wait to see what interesting perk builds start getting used. Endgame could offer a lot more variety now.
---
Yea true. Hes kinda like tracer from overwatch. Which they never change even though they constantly buff and nerf everyone else
---
There's a difference between "changing the game" and "destroying something" though.
---
It's like if Krispy Kreme said they were going to try out a new batter formula, and then we all find out the batter is being replaced with feces.
---
Why not just ignore it? Its literally someone who means absolutely nothing to you why care what they have to say?
---
Yeah i see what you mean. The mod says we cant say anything about it until tomorrow.... Ugh
---
Fair enough though, thats fair.
---
for anyone who doesn't know Tofu, he's a streamer and Fog Whisperer for Dead By Daylight, who tends to play about 50/50 survivor/killer (or even 40/60, if i'm being honest) and likes to chat about his thoughts on game mechanics, perks, and proposed changes. i thought his insight to how the Legion rework could possibly work was interesting and, moreover, sounded like it might be both fun to play and fun to play against. what do y'all think?
---
This description is wrong. NOED now has the exposed effect on all three levels. I have no idea why it took your survivors two hits to down them unless they all had Mettle of Man.
---
A classic horror game consisting of the following,
---
10% bloody Claudette
---
42% bright colours
---
26% horror
---
82% Bugs
---
Survivors flashlight saving and blocking are just trying to survive and have as many of their teammates survive too. Not toxic. And killers can be toxic too. Both sides have little shitbags its not one side of the other.
---
It's called anxiety. While you're right, it still makes me nervous someone is going to say something, as opposed to getting a message straight away.
---
It's not exactly rational.
---
The exposed effect is now on all three tiers of NOED.
---
Im a god fearin non anime watchin man but I would watch the one in the middle front
---
Username checks out.
---
Good, screw survivors, they've had it too easy for too long.
---
Okay I don‚Äôt know anymore then. I‚Äôm so lost.
---
I don‚Äôt know anymore.
---
I think that they confirmed the hatch can be reopened with a key on the Endgame post
---
Actually, imagine if they could damage the door, or destroy it at a certain point.
---
"I'm stuck trapped in here with you, YOU'RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH ME."
---
Literally the top post wtf.
---
‚ÄúThis party‚Äôs over.‚Äù
---
Oh I agree with you fully.  When I play Survivor I don't die nearly as often as I feel I should be unless it's a Billy/Spirit/Good Nurse, so it'd be nice to die more often to another killer like the Pig.
---
Unfortunately though, I've read that they plan to change her, so she may end up not being a scary endgame killer anymore ;_;
---
killer bout to pop noed when they open the gates and down everyone and get the 4k

If you pay attention around the beginning the killer sees it too.
---
Its compensation for the fact the survivors have 3 minutes to get out and the killer can camp the exit  or end the match early by opening a gate and then fucking over survivors with perks for the end game. Maybe make them harder to see idk, it just seems like this is gonna make alot of people just run end game perks to fuck shit up more.
---
So Leatherface can facecamp better than freddy. Whoopee.
---
There are aspects of killer that are toxic.
---
[removed]
---
Looks good, might need to nerf fired up to ballance him out a bit
---
Pretty sure it's intentional. I don't think the devs would make it red by mistake , they are not colourblind.
---
Holy fucking shit.
---
We get it, you favor killers with updates, but do you have to hand everything to them?
---
Trapper: This is a generator. If it's being repaired you just need to damage it; \[since\] if you do, the repair progress will regress. Give it a try. 
---
\*Jason murders generator\*
---
Trapper: Alright, so.... I said, "you just need to damage it," right? Next time don't *destroy* it.
---
Right:
---
Wraith: A generator. You just have to kick it, like so.
---
\*Jason kicks over generator\*
---
Trapper: Why does this happen every single time?! Do you not know your own strength?!
---
Its because imagine this.
---
Theres this bird that wont shut up its tweeting loud early in the morning and shitting on the porch, everyone wants it gone, so someone steps up and grabs it and breaks its legs and wings then impales it on a fishing  hook and uses it for live bait.
---
Everyone hated the bird but watching that shit happen to it was too much and  too heavy.
---
Community wanted legion to not be so easily abused, so bhvr sank them to the bottom of the ocean lol.
---
- This only applies during a Feral Frenzy, the only condition change is that you can do it every frenzy without stabbing someone.
---
- Legion needs to wait for the power to fully recharge now, so it's considerably less flexible now.
---
- Legion is confirmed losing their wall-hack blood senses with the nerf.
---
Conclusion: This is a still a terrible add-on.
---
Call it whatever you want, but to me, being disrespectful with the sole purpose of making someone angry is toxic. You are toxic.
---
THE BEST PART IS WHEN EVERY ONE OF THESE DICKHEADS COMPLAINS ABOUT NOED, THEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR PERKS, AND JUST LIKE THE TIDES IT'S ALWAYS: DEAD HARD, METTLE, ADRENALINE, WGLF!
---
I recently had a guy tell me that: A nurse's calling, Ruin, and BBQ were all crutch perks and I need to lean how to actually play the game and stop relying on perks to do all the work for me. Use these messages as a sign that you are playing well, It means that you played well but the survivors don't want to admit that they were bested so they will try to blame it on something that was out of their control, such as bad teammates are a killer playing with a cheap playstyle.
---
But survivors leaving games actively ruins the game for the other players. Killers dodging lobbies just adds a few seconds to your wait.
---
Give each killer a climactic theme for collapse. I can imagine the tension of trying to escape a T3 Myers with the Halloween theme going, or a NOED Wraith with drums and chanting.
---
It would also serve a gameplay purpose, making it more difficult to hear the audio cues of an approaching killer.
---
FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOUR ADRENALINE, METTLE, DELIVERANCE, DEAD HARD
---
If it's really happening all the time then I'd suggest taking a couple perks to counter it. Urban/Self-care is great if you're trying to go unnoticed and aim for hatch. If you want to try to dive hook I'd say borrowed time and dead hard. Mettle of Man is not too bad for either build as well. If you're not really keen on building one way or another I'd just say rush gens, know what your perk/play style combo does well and work on looping. Like I said, it sucks but I don't think it's impossible to overcome because it's ultimately a suboptimal way to play.
---
BECAUSE FUCK BALANCING THE GAME PROPERLY, BUY THIS HAT!
---
I'm just trying to figure out if there could be any exploits or advantages a killer or survivor can do with it. One thing that comes to mind is body blocking the basement while the timer ticks down and guaranteeing 1 or 2 kills.
---
Had Bbq, I hooked a survivor and saw the person who was 1 hook off dying. Killed and hooked her, she messeged me how bad I am and how much of a tunneler I am even tho she was the only person BBQ revealed.
---
What does the glowing ground do?
---
Hope you don't mind if I reply here to clear up some misconceptions.
---
- This only applies during a Feral Frenzy, the condition changing is that you can do it every frenzy without stabbing someone.
---
- Legion needs to wait for the power to fully recharge now, so it's considerably less flexible and spammable now.
---
- Legion is confirmed losing their wall-hack blood senses with the nerf, so the tracking is gone.
---
Personal Conclusion: This is *still* a terrible add-on.
---
Yeah I don't think so.
---
yes u can, with a rework
---
Doubt
---
It's already a tired joke and its been like a day. We deserve more innovative memes
---
Maybe the game could force you to kobe, but only after the killer's TR is gone(just in case you have deliverance)
---
Lmao what? How on Earth does this collapse hurt the killer? Besides the hatch automatically spawning with 1 survivor left, literally everything else ONLY helps the killer.
---
Nah man. The only thing it changed is killers will have to get an early 3k if they want to guarentee the fourth.
---
The only thing that should have changed was hatch close. Plain and simple.
---
The timer puts pressure on survivors sure, however the exit gates rarely are near each other.
---
An experienced survivor now has more options to rush 2 gens, wait for end game, and easily escape. 
---
Perks Wake Up! and Adrenaline will make this even easier. 
---
Its going to be a nightmare for killers.
---
Luckier than most
---
If the survivor sees killer camping gen then just work gens or gates as always then if the killer comes over then run to the hatch and jump in because  you cant be hatch grabbed. If the killer closes hatch then open the gate.
---
The opponent, the other side, ect. Could of used any of them and u still get the point :/
---
Wait wait, is this for real? I am down with this.
---
Die. You don't always win.
---
It sucks, but there's no grounds for a refund. Just have to cut your losses. Also, why are you using 'completely serious' and 'this is kinda satirical' in the same post? It seems sort of contradictory.
---
a scumbag*
---
I don't know, would it take a lot of time and effort to put restrictions on the types of perks allowed in 3 perk slots? 
---
They sure spent a lot of time reworking the Legion just to have the player base screech in stunned horror.
---
I think it'd be worth a try in the ptb.
---
Nothing. But the survivor doesnt have to do that. They can just do gens
---
WELL GUYS IM GONNA JUMP OF THE CHAIR
---
*Hits lever*
---
**"Everybody out of the pool"**
---
LETS BE SALTY FUCKS TOGETHER
---
Think about this. Wait til you find survivor and slam that shit. Game over...
---
Same thing a killer can do when he spawns on a map with 2 back to back jungle gyms with 4 windows between them next to the killer shack. Jack shit.
---
There's literally no indiciation why a killer quit a lobby. One guy could have had shit ping and refused to leave (only time I reset a lobby). Or had to leave. Or wanted to play survivor....or literally any other reason.
---
How vain do you have to be to think they closed the lobby because of your pink hair lol
---
I'm still seeing lots of ruin. I am rank 8 survivor I think. It's pretty much 85% Bbq &amp; ruin, 14% one of the two, then 1% neither.
---
It won't work.
---
Unlocking, not opening. If the killer knows where the last survivor is, they're not getting a gate open. The hatch would be much easier to get, which is why hatch standoff were a thing.
---
Just messing around, really. I'm more-so serious about how scuffed Legion has gotten, and being sarcastic about getting a refund. A refund would be nice though for how roughly fucked Legion has gotten.
---
Lets be fair though: swf groups are gonna kill themselves because they want to save each other too much.
---
How can a killer be toxic explain
---
I agree and glad I'm not the only one who thinks this. The entity holds your hand and you're rewarded for it just runs me the wrong way, but we will have to wait and see.
---
Wait does his power not refresh after hitting a new survivor now?
---
It would take *some* effort for them to ruin it, so of course they won't.
---
That's what makes it funny
---
Essentially because a lot of people complained about their power, and BHVR couldn‚Äôt be bothered to come up with a rework that benefitted both survivors and legion players, so instead they‚Äôre just gonna take a crowbar to legion and call it a day
---
Wasn't there a video a while ago that showcased how fast a gen could be done at maximum. Purple toolboxes prove thyself, a leader injuered bonus plus spinechill. A gen can be done in 10 secs or less I think.
---
But why not try? If were still 3 up and theres 1 on the hook you should still try and help your teammate out.
---
**THE ENTITY DOES NOT APPROVE OF FAT SHAMERS**
---
This is how scary he actually feels like to play against right now.
---
Makes sense why everyone seemed to be super ready when I was switching around between killers and played a a game as billy.
---
The three minutes starts when the doors are opened, and moves 50% slower if anyone is slugged or hooked.
---
 Exit gates take 20 seconds, and Survivors now have a guaranteed chance, even two chances, even if the gens aren't done at all.
---
Killer doesn't have to find people trying to punish them after the exit gates open, or check every locker and run loops, just throw the door open.
---
 They can still camp and the survivor can do gens or rush it and die, or they can slam the hatch shut, leaving it about fifty/fifty if the last survivor gets out. If they find it.
---
If the killer takes pity on a solo remaining player, they can also just let them go immediately now.
---
I'm excited about this change, since it gives matches a guaranteed end point. It feels like a quality of life change.
---
If he dies...he dies
---
Finally, some good fucking use of this meme
---
Lol there's no reason to hate it unless you're that one kid that teabags the exit gates for 5 minutes.
---
Bill is on the other side hes a PC exclusive no?
---
Big difference from just leaving before a game starts as killer to leaving as a survivor mid game and screwing over everyone
---
Not fat shaming if she's not fat.
---
It was on the front page yesterday.
---
If you camp the new hatch the survivors will literally be able to do gens and force you to close the hatch, starting EGC or just do them and open the gates and leave since you wanna hatch camp.
---
Neato!

If you're on PS4 I wouldn't bother. Killers DC at start of match, match making is sloooowwww, team mates (so called team mates) work with the killer with no punishment. It's lived it's day for me at least. I finally deleted the game after months of pure boredom and frustration. It was quite cathartic.
---
Ive only ever done that if the gens get done in the first 2 minutes...
---
I'm a survivor main but I can help you out. Putting on ruin slows the game down and bbq can give you map control to let you know where the survivors are. if a survivor is running you around for a good amount of time, its best to leave them alone and go after someone else. I play killer here and there but I dont really do it to pip or to rank up, i just do it for the fun and BP.
---
Right!? It's just giving them full points for something they didn't do :l
---
I mean... ormond
---
Hahaha they should nerf claudettes darkness and make her like a more pale tone of black. Like one of those whiter shades of black. You guys know what I mean?
---
Well I read more about it and rewatched the video, and I think that it is better than a 30 min hatch standoff.
---
They need to look at the Dragula queens for next killer Vander von Odd would be great design.
---
Immersed?
---
Not all players have that sense of honor. Plus, there are situations where it's safer for you to cut your losses and just leave.
---
Yes dbd is a free for all. The objective for survivors is to SURVIVE. I am no more on your team than the killer is. Just because we have similar goals does not mean I have an obligation to you. If sandbagging helps me reach my objective of surviving then there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that
---
Methinks he meant what the animation of the killer trying to pull down the lever would look like, considering their size differences.
---
I have a friend named Helen who was closely associated with a mutual friend that ended up being a pedophiles so I'm laughing on the outside but on the inside I'm like "holy shit dude"
---
The hatch was definitely never fair because Killer had to wait there staring like a sweat lord to do a grab while the survivor could get hit twice and still jump during the killer cooldown, so I don‚Äôt know where that lie is coming from. 
---
Also this new EGC is really forcing overalruistic people to swallow that save and leave and stopping hatch camps on both ends. 
---
Hatch rn was never equal and you pretending to be upset about losing a 99% survivor sided standoff only shows you‚Äôre missing the whole point of the change.
---
LOGICAL lol. let's fuckin see what *this* means.
---
Billy is a top A tier killer, he is on par with Nurse for doing well in red ranks but of course Nurse is still the top dog and only "S tier".
---
In terms of generator progression you'll need some perks to slow them down but also the way you moniter your gens is very beneficial. Go into every match assuming at least 3 generators are going to get done an patrol a strong circle of gens near-ish to each other.
---
In chases, don't over commit to a single chase. If you get ran through 3 or more pallets an haven't managed a hit yet, it's best to break off an patrol your gens an try to catch someone slipping up. Besides that, if your patrolling gens an not sacrificing any one, they still can't escape until those gens get done, be patient an try not to stress out and get frustrated.
---
The more emotional you get the more likely you are to underperform to your capabilities.
---
He's not the best player, but check out some of TrueTalents killer videos, he's a constant red rank player an plays as non toxic as he can, and as light-hearted as he can be. His videos helped me a lot, maybe they'll help you too.
---
Those killers will also stop after they realize they won't benefit much from sacrificing 25% of their build to help with holding down the last living survivor.
---
Before, it was just a dumb gamble and waiting game for both sides. Hatch standoffs and crouching until them.
---
At least now a survivor can go 99% gens and getting points to pressure the killer into powering the doors, or leaving the hatch.
---
I think it's kinda bullshit that the killer can shut the hatch but whatever.
---
Stabs and sacrifices the survivor on the spot after the timer is finished.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to it. Means survivors will quit sitting at the gate ready to butt dance
---
That's a weird ass mechanic
---
Thanks I'll check out those videos
---
Thank you for actually saying what no one wants to say
---
why just jane and myers? *A L L  O F  T H E M**
---
Survivors may just have to recognize that an endgame basement save isn't worth the risk.
---
Well not all of us check this sub Reddit every single day
---
No one wants to say? I‚Äôll shout it from the roof tops!
---
DCing.
---
And if I heard correctly killers can also open up exit gates? It will definitely be interesting to say the least
---
It's so that there are no stupid ass stalemates that last 10 minutes.... I'm in favor of this
---
Can you spin with insidious, like look around
---
Only other power I could think of would be ability to run but then would basically be legion, cell phone was a huge part of the movies, hence why I think as a power could work.
---
This is what Bubba sees when he wears "Athleteface."
---
Looks cool, nice QOL change for killers, but doesnt really do anything for balance.
---
I can half agree on that. I've seen survivors working like seal team six. I can kind of see of where it would be op with basement nearby like some instances of Black swamp or Pre-school.
---
That'll take a lot of luck however.
---
More or less the more we talk about the more I see balance. It just sucks for everyone.
---
The last man however should practically always escape at this point.
---
Good lord.
---
Realistically, I don't think this is going to change that much outside of hatch standoffs. I think people are trying to judge it before we've even had a chance to experiment with it
---
But its 500 points! /s
---
Yeah but if what I'm hearing is correct it sounds like the killer can 3k, shut the hatch to trigger endgame, and then just camp the hatch bc the last Survivior now can't do anything. They can't do gens, so exit gates are out of the equation, and the only other escape would require the hatch.
---
Haha ive never seen a bloody claudette that dies.
---
The intention is the same, its pretty annoying to lose time because killers/survivors are just selective idiots.
---
I cant wait to see the entity do some fucking work for once
---
proves the meme
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a known exploit
---
I know my point is proving how end game basement saves are no longer going to be viable you will get yourself killed for being altruistic.
---
I don't hear it often enough in these collapse endgame discussions and that frustrates me lol
---
Agreed, I only like it if they all wait for me to use my power on them for points or daily, but its fairly obvious when a group stays to actually give you points if they let you down them each before going. Otherwise they don't even give me the hit most of time, they just want me to see them out.
---
sure but when its like 5 lobbies in a row 3 seconds after I join it kinda makes it obvious they are leaving cause my nea has pink hair and they are scared they are going to get looped for too long...
---
Are they unwilling to admit they‚Äôve lost survivors?
---
I think for the last man, the killer either has to:
---
1.Get them going for the hatch.
---
2. Close the hatch and get them going for the gates.
---
Oh I think we know what it means. Logical = nerf. 
---
What are your guesses everybody? Here's mine:
---
* The Timer of traps stops ticking once End Game Collapse is activated ~~making the Pig's power useless~~ to better improve the experience of ~~survivor~~ all players.
---
hatch should not spawn before there's only one survivor left. because then the survivor can camp the hatch while you're hooking the third and get a free escape. it should be both persons searching frantically for the hatch at the end of the game. as of now, we're still gonna have to slug 3rd person, even more than before because now the endgame is so scary people are DEFINITELY gonna go camp that hatch. and no hatch grabs? i get why they did that, but if they're keeping the closed hatch around that screws things up a bit. get rid of the closed hatch. only have it spawn on last survivor. give both sides a fair chance.
---
When I started making it, no one had made the joke visually.
---
When I finished, the same joke filled up three pages.
---
I couldn't just abandon it though, I love it too much.
---
\*scared oinks\*
---
Just run p3 claudette with a flashlight. Its either dodge, mori, or nurse.
---
You know your an entitled killer main when you say killers aren't toxic lmao both sides are as toxic as the other tbh
---
Coolest than yours
---
You can also do it with a chainsaw hit with hillbilly.
---
Had a survivor say they reported me for exploiting when I did that to them. Lmao.
---
Here let me try. 
---
Power: Voices of death. 
---
The Entity has blessed Scream with the ability to invade his victims minds and force them to listen to his thoughts. 
---
Scream may choose to curse a Survivior. The Survivior that is cursed will begin to Sporadically hear the Entity's whisper (except it'll be extremely loud) for a brief time period or until they take a hit from Scream. While they are cursed, they cannot hear the killers Terror Radius, footsteps and Survivior grunting are completely muffled, and the Survivior is infected with Aura blindness. The Survivior must perform a "meditation" action (similar to snap out of it) in order to remove the voices and Grant them a 30 second immunity to the voices from happening again. 
---
If a Survivior inflicted with the voices is struck by Scream, he gain 10% reduced attack cooldown and +5% move speed towards that Survivior. If the Survivior stuns Scream with a pallet, locker (via Head on), Decisive strike, or Flashlight, Scream will suffer a 15 second reduction in movement speed (down from 115% to 100%) . If Scream hooks a Survivior afflicted with voices of death, he can see the aura of the closest Survivior for 4 seconds.
---
How so?  I think it‚Äôs fair.
---
Idk most of the time if you've got the doors open you've likely done enough to safety pip or pip so why not do everything you can to get all the survivors out.  Especially if its like the only hook the killer got all game. Fuck that no kill for you.
---
Similar to the stand off at a hatch when a killer is standing there and your standing there waiting for one to make a move
---
Entitled to what lol? Killers have no teason to be toxic other that the fact that a team if surcucora made the fame unblanced anf so we have to camp someone in orset to get any kills
---
As a survivor main on Xbox and Killer main on PC.... i totally understand dude. It's rough. If I see teammates ready to teabag at the gate or the killer works with my teammates, I just leave to the gates when I can. As a killer, I just have to cool down and try so hard not to be a fucking asshole to them. I am considering to just block chat
---
And I‚Äôll bet nothing came of it too üòÇ
---
They always ecpect yout to let them unhook in front of them. Entitled lil survicor cunts.
---
My guess is that the collapse also slows while traps are ticking.
---
Nice flex
---
They're probably going to make the 3 minute timer slow when a survivor has the trap on.
---
Wait, I am kinda thick. How does this stop the hatch standoffs?
---
I'd have switched out Wraith for Trapper. Trapper is bigger.
---
Fix the game for colorblind people.
---
It basically means that the claudette was so "immersed" in stealth that she didn't really contribute to the over all goal of the survivors or the game at all. Basically both claudettes survived in my two situations because they stealthed around the map and waited for everyone to die off (or in situations where the game went well for survivors stealthed until all the gens were done).
---
I wasn't aware that losing a chase and getting hit (with Mettle of Man) was "completing an objective."
---
I feel like some people assume it's near impossible but with enough luck it's pretty easy and dangerous to pull off
---
We should be able to buy skins for it. I want my collapse to be the city carpet every child plays on as a kid. So I can run around driving my pretend car waiting for people to leave.
---
The spelling of this post is unintentionally the funniest thing I've seen in this entire subreddit.
---
Honestly, I'm all 3
---
Your best bet is to get eyes on the killer, find where he's patrolling because that's near the hatch, then start 99%-ing gens. Rush it if they leave far enough, or let them sweat it out and close it, then your odds are way improved.
---
If you die, you still made more points.
---
It's an interesting flavor. The game feels complete after hearing about this collapse.

When the killer shuts the hatch, the exit gates will automatically be powered, all the survivor has to do is try and open an exit gate.
---
I've never been banned so who knows. I even used the double blades as legion a few times this past week. I think it takes a lot to get banned.
---
Granted I've never went on a spree exploiting bugs really. I did stand on a few rocks on the small hills to teabag the killers though. Always hopped off after they kept failing to get to me lol. Sad that got patched.
---
5 he's left? There is no hatch. It only appear when 2 gens are done
---
I don't think it's going to change all that much for survivors. Three minutes (technically more if someone's down or hooked) is plenty of time to heal up, possibly get a few saves in, then give the killer the traditional butt dance at the gates before leaving. It seems more like a QoL change to remove hatch standoffs and to prevent people sneaking around the map with the sole purpose of wasting the killer's time. I highly doubt out-of-time kills will be anywhere near a common occurrence. 
---
Oh, and the ground looks cool.
---
It ain't easy....
---
... being cheesy........
---
Killer can only open gate once the gens are done. You can avoid getting crows by just simply walking around crouched.
---
Hatch was a battle of attrition. Whoever wanted it more got it.
---
Instead, they just gave it to killers. You're pretending this is fair and balanced because you primarily play killer, and want the games to be easier for yourself.
---
Nah that‚Äôs just The boss fighting Metallica
---
ü§îü§î
---
Oh good. Bc I was afraid my fellow killer mains finally got their wish of literally a free win
---
Should have been Lion.
---
So The Lich relies on survivors/zombies to down the others? Sounds like the Entity would be displeased.
---
So would you rather have to stand around having a hatch standoff for 20 mins when there‚Äôs one survivor left every game? That shits boring.
---
Nice idea but this has already been thought of a long time ago
---
The killer can grab them, though.
---
If they're off doing a generator, then the killer could down them.
---
&gt;In fact it's probably the most survivor sided aspect of the game.
---
Even if this were true, it's not saying much.
---
I am laughing, out loud, at midnight, in a public bus! This is funny BUTT I don't mind the idea
---
Yeah true, however, the end game collapse makes fighting the Pig as a killer, a living hell.
---
Bc the hatch isn't there for the killer to close. If you don't want a Survivior to take the hatch then kill them before they reach it. If they reach it and they want to do the standoff, then either do it or let them go and move on
---
Next mid chapter. They tweeted it.
---
One of the devs said it, but it wasn't in the video
---
update is removing that. Now shows up regardless
---
‚ÄúJUsT aNotHEr bUFf tO KiLLeR‚Äù
---
I know. This mechanic is gonna need some major changes or Pig is gonna need hella nerfed
---
Personally, I finally gave up using Self Care a few weeks ago like many did. With sloppy butcher, mangled add ons, legions with that deep wound mechanic and such on top of the self care nerfs a while back, it's mostly using a perk slot I could spend on other things and encourages more teamwork, using med packs and in general, getting more things done.
---
I'd say try out Adrenaline instead of that as once the final gen is done, it's an insta heal and a sprint burst. If you're down and on the ground, it gets you up, if you're on a hook then when you're unhooked, you get instantly healed and have the sprint burst.
---
I'm running Decisive Strike cause of all the tunnelling lately. Mettle of Man so I can take an extra hit and then I bounce between stuff for my 4th perk. I like Prove Thyself, Deliverance or Balanced Landing... which I absolutely love as a perk but it really just depends on what I'm feeling.
---
In general though, it might be worth playing without perks for a bit just to get used to learning chasing and loops without them. Perks are good but for the most part, they're best when they can compliment existing skills and play styles. The perks you have on aren't awful tbh, they can work well together. I'd just say Self Care isn't worth it unless you're also using Botany Knowledge.
---
Since there's too many killers to just counter one of them these days, I'd say a good approach to perk builds is going with a general theme. Think of your goal and play style you want to try and then from there, focus on that. General all purpose builds can be good too but think of a general play style for those as well.
---
The hitbox of his chainsaw used to be easy easier to juke. Put it back to the way it was and you've got a balanced Billy: plenty of map pressure and an instadown, but no aim assist on the chainsaw so the skill cap is higher.
---
Probably less than 80/19/1 but rounded it up. It doesn't show a decimal number.
---
Yeah survivors play survivor cause its easier. They like to have a team. They are literally weaker than you just based on the fact alone that they chose survivor. The little cunts will never be good at killing so I dunno whh they think they can talk trash or do anything toxic at all... its just silly.
---
It wasn't sudden, they've been working on this for about a year now. We tested hatch closing mechanics in one of the first PTBs, and after that they said they were gonna work on a rework to the entire end-game sequence.
---
Not deep fried enough
---
I really wanna see that
---
LOL I needed a laugh for the day. You'd have a better chance of winning the lottery than them getting this worked out correctly on ptb.
---
If they make remember me work with the collapse.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the mechanic isn‚Äôt all that bad, it seems balanced enough to me somewhat but I know certain killers will massively be more powerful due to it, depending on the circumstances.
---
Well, don't let something silly like wishful thinking get in the way of making yourself a victim.
---
Clown needs bootie shorts. All hail daddy clown. Take me to your sex dungeon.... mmm yes oh god daddy yes. Oh big boy how you know what I like
---
I‚Äôve had a toxic swf do that to me in the basement and at the end of the match one  said EZ. All they did was spam flashlights every 5 seconds and be little shits
---
Unless you're really after those Bloodpoints and are trying to farm them up as soon as possible, We're Gonna Live Forever isn't going to help with anything that involves actually playing the game though. I like to use it a bunch when I want fast points but otherwise, it's basically taking a perk away from yourself.
---
It's not well thought out. It's just an easy way to depip without getting banned for leaving. As killer don't bring anything, open the exit gates, go sit in a corner. Easy depip and no one gets anything. They just added a new way of griefing. Hell you can do that as wraith and the survivors will never find you.
---
It looks like Entity is empaling Claudette on its middle finger
---
How am I a victim here buddy. If anything I'm one of the bigger benefactors here considering I main killer (Spirit and Pig to be specific)
---
Watch the video holy hell
---
Neither does rounding in your mind, I guess.
---
Means that they didn‚Äôt camp the hook.
---
I honestly don't like it. I don't like how killers can now close the hatch. I don't like how Surviviors who try to be altruistic are now getting punished, and I don't like how killer mains seem to always get whatever they want yet when there's a legit concern Surviviors have, the dev team and killer mains are anywhere from dismissive to borderline combative about it.
---
It's 3 minutes to leave through an open gate, that's plenty of time. If someone's hooked then the speed halves, so you've still got tons of time to make saves.
---
Settle down bran, don't you have white walkers to worry about.
---
Cause they're Republicans lol
---
Why should the survivor be rewarded for bad play?
---
0 likes
---
Two, devour hope. Both of which are powerful perks, if left alone.
---
True, the entity still looking out for her though üò§üò§
---
Aah, I thought it was a new perk I missed. Thanks.
---
Literally same shit. Thicc is the same as overwight. Either way if your ass is that big... it means you don‚Äôt run and spend way tooo much time sitting on your ass.
---
No. No killer has to rely on M2. Just like any other, it's just an additional thing. Zombies would be good for limiting areas survivors can safely be in and allowing The Lich to sandwich survivors.
---
Bc killers are too, so why not make it extend both ways.
---
Saying that just makes you sound salty and vindictive.
---
Yup, got it on the nose.
---
No killer except for Freddy that is
---
No way does that justify 30 minutes. Besides, just miss a few skill checks, then sneak back to the hatch. Either LF went after you, or he's still on the hatch and you know he won't budge so you can just finish the gen.
---
You mean the blood pulses? That only works if he can find you in the first place. Add on the reduced movement speed in feral frenzy and there's plenty of chance to hide.
---
No problem, this game is complex, even more so if you're new(er) to the game/the community. I've been playing for a year and still ask what things are sometimes. :)
---
I do this when I run Spirit Fury. They're used to you respecting it so when you lunge through and that pallet explodes they get a good jump.
---
I respect your opinion on it, I don‚Äôt think I should say more given that it hasn‚Äôt been tested out yet, to see if it‚Äôs good or absolutely unfair to the T, but knowing BHVR‚Äôs track record, I‚Äôm having a fifty/fifty on it.
---
Or by controversial.
---
Survivors already are rewarded for bad play as well.
---
But what if all survivors become Zombies? Where‚Äôs the hook mechanics? How does the game end then?
---
Simple. Don't be near it.
---
Who is Susie?? Im soo confused
---
your tracking doesn't work on survivors inflicted with Deep Wounds already.
---
Hella good point. Make a new thread so there's a chance the devs see it.
---
Sure, I'm not saying people should still play a game if their house sets on fire. I meant it more as in game rules.
---
I'm not 50/50. I'll bet my left nut that changes will be made that shaft altruistic Surviviors even more. And when Surviviors call bullshit on it, the dev team and killer mains will be anywhere from dismissive to combative about it
---
Lmao. Im a killer main, but if someone is looping me, without teabagging, I don't consider it toxic. If they're too good and I can't get them, I'll just go for someone else. Leatherfaces are the worst so it's not surprising
---
Zombified = not a survivor. 4 survivors Zombified = no survivors = game over
---
Don't think you're understanding this situation. As soon as the survivor walks away from the Hatch, seeing as how they're in a stand off, LF can just dry hump him while revving his chainsaw and then down him. 
---
If circumstances were different (like a different killer) then sure. But there's not much to do here because once the survivor walks away, he's fucked. 
---
I'm not sure how you expect him to sneak off and do gens when LF is looking directly at him lol.
---
This is pretty much what I imagined when they announced collapse.
---
Then don't close the hatch? You can only close it when it's open anyway ie last survivor
---
3 is without doubt plenty of time.
---
Really bc last I checked a fucked up window vault gets you hooked. Meanwhile not stopping any gens from getting done can reward you with a free haste and insta down. Or if you don't run that bullshit perk, you can get a free haste if you aren't good enough with any killer to catch a Survivior within 15 seconds (bc for some reason all of us sans Nurse move faster than Surviviors but we all needed a buff anyways)
---
This will literally never happen. Like looking for a unicorn.
---
It's going to be glorious when it does.
---
But they aren‚Äôt sacrificed so no, not game over. Nice idea, bad execution.
---
Im very very excited about this!! Thanks DBD team for always adding exciting new content!
---
From my experience p3 claudettes are the most useless survivors of all. Urban evasive n around, hiding, nit doing gens, not saving anyone, waiting for people to die to get hatch. Id honestly tale 4 p3 claudettes 10 out of 10 times versus neon colored neas
---
Groovy
---
Honestly I believe so too, but I‚Äôm gonna see where it goes. I‚Äôm not as altruistic as a survivor, I‚Äôm more objective-based even though I have essentially an ‚Äòaltruistic/bold‚Äô build. I‚Äôm more or less just...‚Äômeh‚Äô with the collapse.
---
A leigon member
---
I can imagine using territorial imperative (Huntress perk where you see Survivor auras in basement) and basement hooking someone, move away so you can get the aura, and once they go for the save rush in and block both survivors in until the timer expires.
---
While I like the Collapse (from what I've seen so far), this play is a little alarming. I'm fine with bodyblocking for hits, I'm fine with bodyblocking to wait out Borrowed Time, but bodyblocking to wait out the end game timer seems bullshit. I wonder if the devs took that into consideration.
---
If they were just tossing the Legion update out there live, I might agree with you, but they have plenty of testing and time before they finalize the nerf. I'd be more than happy to wager that the Legion rework will change from what's listed in the forum after the PTB.
---
I'm purely objectives when I play Survivior. Altruism is a major afterthought for me bc I'm not in the business of revealing my location to the killer. But this collapse is way too 1 sided for the killer rn. Things are already getting super fucking one sided now that Decisive was gutted and unfortunately I have a bad feeling adrenaline is gonna follow.
---
what the shit
---
Not really. A survivor that makes it to the hatch can't be pulled out now. If the survivor reaches it, they're escaping.
---
Had a game exactly like this I was Myers and I got so close to her I was practically glitching into her and when she turned around she flipped shit and tried to stun me point blank with a flashlight. When that didn't work she DC'ed.
---
God I love rank reset sometimes.
---
 Noed is a crutch perk, but survivors have plenty of those. Bloodlust is necessary because of window loops and such and can easily be countered by going to a safe pallet.
---
At this point, we just have to see where it goes honestly.
---
Damn right. I‚Äôm just glad end game collapse will cute back on the butt dancing  on the exit gate
---
The phone or the power that could be used with the phone?
---
Nope no deliverance. Just used all my luck offerings since I'm going to prestige soon
---
Will something like this happen? Sure. Is it going to happen often? No it really won't.
---
So is the killer manages to body block a survivor in a corner or at the basement stairs during endgame collapse, there's nothing they can do but die?
---
This. The basement is meant to be dangerous. You can also use this tactic to wait out BT, DS, RBT, etc. The same concept applies.
---
That's a lit totem from the start.
---
MOTHERFU-
---
I can hit skill checks even with a cold can of Dr. Pepper in my hand.
---
Or you‚Äôre just bad lol. These days unless you‚Äôre against a 4 man swf you‚Äôll have a relatively easy time.
---
I will say, I have been tempted in a game with a toxic killer to just waste time going locker to locker and hiding forever but then I think as funny as that would be, it's just not worth the effort.
---
I like it, only thing I would change is the invading minds with some sort of phone mechanic.
---
this is legit? please say it is!
---
That's some good dogelore
---
Why the killer needs a switch to force survivors out or they die.  
---
  
---
Have the killer have to stay in the basement holding spacebar and not moving for it to work.
---
Adrenaline and mettle of man
---
Haha not at all. I'm saying try playing against a good killer that actually is toxic playing things like 5 blink nurse legion insidious leather face camping  and you'd see what I mean sorry I hurt you're ego you must be the best killer ever
---
How about a scythe for the weapon? it'll have a longer reach, but he'll have a shorter lunge. Also is it the Nevermore reaper skin?
---
Um, Mettle of Man, Decisive was never deleted, Adrenaline, Exhaustion perks, Self Care, and a couple of others.
---
If not stopping any generators from being done is horrible killer play, then getting hit in general in terrible Survivor play.
---
Yes, people have already thought of this - and Dave Richards has already addressed it on Twitter. A bit vague, but he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll also need to fix that‚Äù so I assume they‚Äôll be taking a look at things..
---
yeah. Although it always has a chest...
---
Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion come to mind right off the bat, but I'm new to the game, so maybe those aren't crutches and I'm wrong?
---
Of course, you would be causing havoc and trying to down more as they're searching for the hatch, so that you can hopefully trap at least one more and let it snowball from there. And yeah, that's generally how solo queues work, I watch Survivors do that shit all the time. Idk, I feel like u/bogsworththe3rd had a pretty good idea with using the Pig for that, maybe even if you could get two RBTs on and THEN start the endgame, especially with addons like Tampered Timer to force them to work faster, Crate of Gears to delay their efforts at freeing themselves, and Ruleset No. 2 so until they activate they won't see Jigsaw Box auras, which should honestly be implemented into the power itself imo.
---
I guess it is crazy then cause I was freaking out when it was happening. But after awhile I assumed it was easier than i thought previously. But wow maybe my game literally just had a luck streak
---
She has some real big dick energy, the 360 hit really sells it
---
Inevitably you still get that one Claudette who crouches towards the hook and hides nearby for a full minute to wait for an opening
---
A dev acknowledged this on his twitter when asked and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll need to fix that‚Äù. It should not happen so hopefully they figure something out. You wouldn‚Äôt even be able to rescue anyone without the killer being able to just come back and block the stairs to kill both. It would definitely be stupid.
---
the less you take the game seriously the more you'll enjoy it.
---
i thought this was an avengers tie in
---
surprisingly no, i think that was probably the guy who killed himself.
---
IDK why y'all are being so negative? To me, 'logical' means that at the end game, the RBT timer would mirror the end game collapse timer.
---
Bonesaw is readyyyy
---
Toxic
---
What i would do for your luck...
---
Insidious is a dumb but fun perk
---
So nothing changed hatch wise.
---
Cool.

After you kill someone and this pops, and you just laugh and grin wickedly. "Let the evil flow, my child!"
---
Wait we have to go through endgame? I thought we could leave?
---
is this a game mode or is this actually going into the normal game?
---
Both
---
It's disrespect.
---
He wants you to rescue your little homie.
---
Disappointed but not surprised 
---
I never even touched that perk (tbh I don‚Äôt personally own a game but w/e)
---
Behaviour said rework on legion, and neutered him to the ground. "Logical change" seems scarier that "rework" imo.
---
One dc does but I believe it has to be the third hook
---
What was that other perk that was basically the reverse of spine chill where it activated when you looked at the killer
---
WHAT DO YOU RUN? SHE'S MY MAIN AND I GET A 4K A DECENT AMOUNT OF THE TIME.
---
Oh I can see that people would exploit that then :/ Why don't they make it so certain perks for certain killers unusable in cases like this?
---
It has nothing to do with backstory. Huntress can afflict damage from long distances, clown cannot. He rightly should have a faster base movement speed.
---
Unfortunately, "drag queens" in horror cinema are usually just "crazy dudes in dresses". Them being transvestites is just an extra detail tacked on to add shock value. SotL did it better, but Bill still wasn't a bona-fide Drag Queen.
---
Can anyone name any "good", campy horror/slasher/queersploitation flicks with drag queens? Now I feel the need to do some research.
---
&gt;Origins being good
---
Because nobody remembers the FUCKING MUD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
A logical one but probably a crippling one in terms of meta knowing them. A bit scared but who knows they might nerf her correctly.
---
That's a cute outfit. Did the Entity give it to you?
---
[menacing]
---
That sucks and me neither he just seemed like an average killer to be chased by but I don't think I've played against one using exploits yet luckily.
---
[The very Dev linked to in the Stickied thread](https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118910098267672576)
---
Nah, I was assuming they wouldn't connect the timer and the ground that is slowly getting angry. Something like:
---
Hmm a timer? That's weird, I wonder what it does. Oh cool the ground is turning red, I wonder what that means.
---
I used to do it once to stop the screaming but now I don‚Äôt since I agree it‚Äôs a little toxic.
---
I hope it makes scratch marks harder to see
---
Nice! Could you also balance the various survivors to get winded appropriately and chainsaws to mori automatically. &lt;3
---
My survival rate is going to drop So so much now, it was already 34% escapes and a 66% death rate
---
On ps4 in red ranks I see the same people ALOT. 
---
If I play fair and still get bm'd I just write the name down.. next time I see you it won't be pleasant. 
---
I keep a few Frank's mixtapes , prayer beads etc for those toxic survivors.
---
Damn Scarlet must‚Äôve been running hope AND adrenaline
---
But I even admitted if I was wrong, I apologize. So tell me, what gives you the idea to continue to berate me?
---
Don't worry about it bud.
---
How long is tge timer? I actually like thus change: less hatch standoff.
---
More totems to cleanse to disable noed
---
I consider myself a generous killer and let a survivor or two escape sometimes when I stomp a game, but then you get the occasional toxic SWFs who wanna ruin the experience and talk shit end game. Like, how do you expect me to ignore you unhooking your friend the second I turn my back?
---
They only take like 6 seconds though, if everyone did them as soon as they saw one they‚Äôd last like half a minute.
---
You didn't. You just edited that post and added the 'I apologize'
---
Yeah I totally agree with the way the devs got rid of the hatch standoff. If the killer is on the path to getting a 4k (only 2 people left and still 3 gens left.) There is so much boring time that goes into slugging someone and searching the map for the other survivor which can take a while and then when someone dies you have to play this super long game of killer searching for the survivor and survivor not being able to find the hatch or killer camping the hatch. 4k should not be denied because of free hatch escape, which still can happen is the survivor finds it first. plus for all we know keys are going to be able to open the hatch back up. 
---
The killer still has to kill 3 people in order for this "impossible to win" scenario can happen. And it should be a near impossible to win  situation, its 1 survivor vs 1 killer.
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised noed is isn‚Äôt getting changed at all
---
14 seconds
---
I must have mistaken myself back when I wrote this. I intend to use Iri Button as a permanent tracing beacon. Just tap the power, get an area, go there. No tracking perks needed. Actually that is fucking op tbh cause If you never DW someone you can effectively have global pinpoint echolocation.
---
DS was the equalizer to NOED. At least MoM was added i guess
---
Still not that bad tbh, I play survivor more than killer and it has never been a problem for me.
---
You having fun shouldn‚Äôt be making someone else mad, that‚Äôs called being a douche
---
Also an accurate representation when Michael hits tier 3
---
I‚Äôm not going to continue this back and forth. Thank you for your time and I wish you well.
---
Premonition
---
Also the pig is gonna be strong now! Reverse bear traps :p
---
There's a difference between leaving over pitiful reasons and leaving because of RL stuff coming up that conflicts.
---
i always smack Laurie once cause i hate how she screams after getting hooked
---
Can you close it with them on top of it, like say instead of jumping you choose to tbag the killer. Can the killer take advantage and close it while you are doing that on top of it or is it blocked.
---
Tapp is about to tapp dat ass
---
I read it on the forums a while ago, it was some dev. Cant find it
---
It's a meme perk for Bubba as a basement camper. Works well in very specific cases.
---
That's a pretty accurate description. There's no practicality to it whatsoever but the meme potential is unmatched.
---
The killer probably doesn't see the glowing ground.
---
Well..not immediately, but you'd definitely die
---
Lol now the killer had the option to decide which way to go. Close the hatch and go towards the exit gates immediately? Or keep it open and it's the same as now, with still the option to close the hatch. So I don't see how it's bad when it's literally in the killer hands. I'm a killer main for what it's worth. This update helps the killer, whether that up to your expectations? I mean clearly not, idk. But to agree with the original comment that this update is going to be so bad especially for the killer is literally false. Like, it's not even an opinion.
---
I think he would considering the timer but it also night be harder to see the vision stain the killer has unless you directly look at him
---
If I see a full P3 squadette with flashlights and toolboxes you best believe I want no part of that.
---
I prefer it how it is right now as much as I like the entity kill animation. The hatch stand off isn't a big deal for me I just think it's stupid that killers stand directly on top of the hatch when they could give space to lure them then grab them and survivors completely ignore the fact they could still fix gens if they see a killer camping on it.
---
Why did they change it to 4% lmfao 5% is still very unlikely
---
Wait so Dwight and Jake were the first two official survivors that are still in play now? Cool!
---
Lmao it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre salty. I played against a Legion yesterday and destroyed his Devour Hope while leading him on a chase around pretty much the whole map but once he downed me he just camped on me and continuously hit me until I died, completely ignoring the fact that he was being gen rushed.
---
A subscribers Discord channel.
---
Because they want to, Malice.
---
It really depends on how and how hard I got hit. I've seen some hits that would decapitate a real person. Not to mention if they got hit hard enough, and at the right angle, to go through bone - straight into the heart or lungs. And William of the Hills running with a fully revved chainsaw might just land that shot.
---
I know right they'll blame everything and everyone else but never themself for their own wrong doing.
---
r/waterniggas
---
oh  my god id cringe lol
---
Keep totems the same. Make it so killer can't see scratch marks.
---
Id prefer they tie NOEDs effects to remaining dull totems when gates are powered. 
---
Each totem= a stack of exposed.
---
Dude, letting it get to you like this is what those toxic survivors want. It‚Äôs not worth it. At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a video game. Yes it gets annoying but it‚Äôs not worth using negative energy on.
---
Then SWFs could take advantage and run near hooked survivor to get chased so (if full heath) they can stall killer while s friend cleansed noed
---
Other than that it seems like a sorta good idea
---
Its about balance not lore. Lore should never effect game balance
---
Only if they say "JUICY" on the back.
---
you running 4 mans? Might be someone working with him. I had a player running bond paired up with a billy who would just find other survivors, tell his friend through comms, then wait for him to come hook. Then the dude just unhooks right in front of the billy and waits for him to down the guy and rehook, lather rinse repeat.
---
I just want to get to a rank where my teammates know what to do and the killers are good enough that they don't ALL camp. I'm fine with 1/3, that's what I expect from an online game (especially on console) but when it's every game you just don't want to play
---
Yes. Should a survivor reach the hatch, they're going to escape.
---
Probably will be but hackers just make new accounts. Not much you can do just move onto next game
---
Wait times are horrible on PS4 and dodges are like 70% of my searches.
---
Got it. While I've never personally dealt with that, I can see why this is a good change. I find the idea of the killer opening the exit gate hilarious though.
---
This is very well written! I love the descriptions and the way you explained how some of the features of the game worked in ways that felt natural, like the 'Odd feelings' that seemed like something you'd get from Premonition/Spine Chill, and the Terror Radius. Idk if you plan on making another part to this, but I'm definitely interested to see how this would continue and how Dwight would handle the situations.
---
You can just play in a 4 man for it or is that impossible?
---
DC's like this always leave me confused, I mean you played like shit and then died why DC?
---
I get if im being a prick in game but here I dont get it
---
The same reason survivors will T bag or click their flashlight
---
I've only played 6 games they were all leatherface
---
we're running 4 mans yes
---
Its pretty easy to mess up the axis controls. Just go into settings and reverse the x &amp; y axis
---
True. He was a serial killer who wore human skin and women's clothes
---
Oh BO2 fucking memories mannnn thank u so much!!!!!!
---
I mapped spacebar to mouse button. Now I can do gens while drinking.
---
Lower ranks its doable because ur teamates usually suck, same strat as before I used to do (its always been hard ti pip at low ranks)
---
1. Do 2 gens if you can after this forget gens unless nothing else to do you'll have gold 
---
2. Save after this point, if killer is camping still go for it if you can, always run borrowed at this rank, only way to get safe unhooks most times
---
3. Improve at running the killer and play pretty safe with pallets, you need a long chase, to get more points
---
Do this and you normally should at least safety and usually pip, expect to die on first hook/be facecamped its alriight.
---
Press the Touch Pad on your dualshock. That switches it. You must have accidentally pressed it (happens to me all the time)
---
Endgame is 100% killer sided and hatch spawning was only ever a problem if no gens has been completed, with 4 gens left it was at least somewhat possible (I don't like the hatch spawning at 5 or 4 gens left but I'm also not quite sure that's what's gonna happen)
---
I did not expect that to be a real sub, the internet never/always disappoints.
---
Yeah, it's pretty much what I've been doing now. I pip one game, get found first or instadowned the next and depip, then I pip, then I depip.
---
You don't have to use both, but using both makes it twice as bad.
---
You can already do that whike a survivor is on basement hook. No difference they can die
---
It literally changes like nothing about hatch standoffs except maybe making them more killer sided because killer can still afk on top of hatch until all of the remaining gens are done then close it when the exit gates are powered, literally extending games by maybe even ten minutes
---
For the killers that want to torture survivors
---
I play while drunk. Can confirm this.
---
I feel attackes
---
Well that makes me feel better about the hatch close mechanic.  Thanks for sharing guy.
---
Oh, guess I‚Äôm not the only my one who thinks that would be a cool idea
---
I don't get it. You have a killer that is on the weaker side of being balanced, you give her a small buff, she now is slightly better, you take it away 2min later and she is not as good anymore.
---
Well, he has to deliver those pizzas, you're doing a public's service sir üòä
---
I always feel guilty hooking a Dwight. Ya gotta do what ya gotta do though. I‚Äôll let them escape if they‚Äôre last ones though because I can‚Äôt help my love for my Dwighty boy.
---
why britain's finest?
---
this really happens? i mean i'll dodge if there's a toxic piece of cunt survivor i know through many previous matches or someone from my steam friend list if i don't feel like goofing a bit or maybe if it's a full swf and i ABSOLUTELY don't feel like it but cause it's just cosmetic? ew
---
^^^THIS. If it's Deliverance, then lol I'll put you back on the hook. But a genuine 4%? As long as you didn't just do it in my face, I'll give that the mad respect it deserves.
---
i dont agree with that. seeing a 4man claudette squad with flashlights is a game i just dont want to play. they pick that to make the killers life miserable. i really have better things to do than getting bullied by some neckbeards on the internet.
---
I was planning to, I just wanted to see reception to it mainly to see if it was worth the time
---
They are much better than before. At least now they don't have fixed spawn areas, before they only spawned on certain zones of each map, making totem searching very easy.
---
I was going to say wrong sub, but all you do is upload the same videos to random subs, even if its not relevant.
---
What the fuck?
---
You need 9 hooks for a particular iridescent so if someone dcs at the start you have to hook every survivor 3 times or best you can do is gold. Also you lose potential chase points which is extremely hard to get iridescent in
---
I might be wrong, I'm probably not but there's still a chance but, it looks like you were camping the hook and instead of being camped he would have rather been onto another match with a killer that wasn't garbage.
---
Most times I dont even care of a gen skill check pops or not, once i reach for the glass its just luck of the draw.
---
It isn't RNG, each RBT has a different key for each. If you get the RBT a second time, the box where you took off the first one definitely won't take away the second, so you only have 3 boxes to search.
---
Killer is largely reactive. If the Survivor you are chasing makes no mistakes, that single chase could easily last 90 seconds or more.
---
No shit, that's why I said essentially.
---
Essentially- used to emphasize the basic, fundamental, or intrinsic nature of a person, thing, or situation.
---
The fundamentals that I'm emphasizing on are that you have add on equiped, make stabs, permanently increase mend time.
---
The other information is unnecessary in this regard as it's a "ban worthy, abusable bug" he doesn't need every detail to get the jist.
---
Wait, what change?
---
If I bring party streamers as killer, I hook everyone twice and let them escape unless they're assholes.
---
If there's a sole Kate in the game, I kill all the other survivors if possible.
---
i'd buy a more sexual mori animation for literally all people who play Trapper
---
I ONLY BOUGHT HER RECENTLY SO I HAD NO REAL PERKS OR ADD-ONS TO SPEAK OF, NOW THAT I GOT SOME REASONABLE SETUP IT IS FAR BETTER
---
It says it in the video, gates are powered and hatch never comes back...
---
Turn off messages from none friends
---
Someone has already pointed that out good sir
---
It's red too?
---
Damn.
---
Seeing an Omega blink Mori nurse or Legion player isn't a game I wanna play either
---
pretty cool, love to see a part 2
---
Clearly the hooks are coated in gealing medicine by the entity. If you lay on the ground you'll bleed out, but if you get hooked you'll be fine. The entity wants to chew on your soul, not let you die on the floor.
---
Pretty much
---
Big difference is that killers see what they will go up against while survivors only find out during trial.
---
no, Meg and Claud just swapped skin colors, pretty sure their names and perks were the same.
---
Hehe, I changed my skill check key to a macro on my mouse, so I can do skill checks one handed.
---
I wonder that too tbh
---
The survivors who do it the most in my experience are people who try to flashlight save and pallet stun but fail every time or try to get you to chase them at in infinite 
---
Like sis you didnt do anything you just got ignored lmao
---
Change to the hatch is perfect. Takes 20 seconds to open an exit gate. Hide near the gate, wait for the killer to check it, then open it and get out. Pretty simple escape strategy.
---
The only time I favor a Survivor is if they are clearly new and their team sandbagged them a little. Other than that, no preference to any Survivor as a Killer, all must be sacrificed.
---
As Survivor, if the Killer happens to be a Nurse, I always make it a point to check if they are a baby Nurse or not. If they aren't and can actually play Nurse, I play normally. If they are a baby Nurse, I make it a point to try to help and teach them play her as a Nurse main. It might come off as toxic since I usually point and tbag them, but it's only to get their attention so they chase me and I can help them learn.
---
Why would you not want to play that? Those games are so fucking free wtf
---
Yeah definitely would recommend it for any skill check actions lol but it's great if ya just need to crouch in a corner to get a drink or what have ya
---
im going to get downvoted for this but I hate when killer doesn't ready up instantly. if he's not ready by 30 secs left, i leave. If they need prep time, they should do it before they make a lobby. 
---
When Im killer, I always stay ready but if a survivor isn't ready, I just keep my lobby.
---
From personal experience they want you to struggle.
---
Either you are the last person and they want to let you go to farm or let you find the hatch, or they just enjoy you struggeling while hooking you.
---
They should've changed most of the end game perks 1st before implementing the end game collapse imo. I mean it'll be on PTB, so in a couple of months after it goes live there has to be broken build or some other stuff that needs changes before it's exploitable.
---
Unless bhvr is actually experimenting live and searches the assholes who exploits the endgame features, either way this is going to be interesting, cause it's 100% a man of their own once end game has reached 2min 30seconds(end game only lasts 3mins) either escape or risking your self and die with others, cause survivors will be making toughest decision.
---
Here's me getting 30-odd downvotes for saying exactly this, lol.
---
I think when they close the hatch it powers up the exit gates but also starts the timer. Hopefully it helps end hatch stand offs.
---
Usually I don't let people survive the rounds, mostly because I've dealt with plenty of T-Bagging and whatnot, but if I see anyone sandbag anyone else, I'll tunnel them to a hook no matter what. If someone DCs after the match has started I'll let them go, if there are two or less survivors I'll let them out. And if I'm feeling generous and they don't wiggle off of my shoulder I might drop them by the hatch. If I bring streamers I'll start a farm for them to spread some joy.
---
I tend to hang around hooks for a little bit, I'll usually walk away and come back, instead of outright facecamping. Though if I've noticed that they're aggressive and continuously dive the hooks, I'll probably stick around a lot more, especially if they've attempted to bodyblock or if I see any of them nearby.
---
People with legacy cosmetics have to often hide it in the lobbies. They appear as default Megs till everyone readys up/6 seconds on the timer, and then switch to it.
---
If they don't do it, they often get dodged. It's really silly that they need to do it.
---
I used to be pretty friendly with giving the hatch in situations like this. But sometimes I really do think the best thing is just to end the match so we can all move on.
---
Unfortunately, we've been scammed (again).
---
Don't worry, I have all the cosmetics for them too.
---
We're all sinking together like the end of Titanic. 
---
I'll play the violins.
---
Ikr I'll take 4 flashlights over anything, they'll be running around me for the most of the game trying to get a save.
---
*happy pig noises*
---
Call me toxic but I am SO going to try this at some point, assuming the survivors are stupid enough to go in at that point
---
OH MAN I never thought of that until now. Pig is gonna be help a fun in endgame
---
FIX YOUR SERVERS HOLY SHIT
---
Oh, I see the problem-
---
You bought a game made by Behaviour. 
---
The fix is to never do that again, LMAO
---
I take a sip of my coffee even on a generator.
---
No but in all seriousness, I have no idea what could be causing this but it seems to be localized to your game, everyone crashes but consistently as survivor seems like a corrupt install
---
Plays 20 matches without incident, then gets a rude message on the 21st match: Fucking DBD playerbase is so toxic.
---
Save this as collateral. Wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it
---
They‚Äôre probably a 12 year old making a threat that they have no intention of carrying out lmao
---
Sorry you're bad at the game and camp the hook, especially that early in the game. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Very thorough write up of a character no one has played.
---
Honestly I wouldn't even feel bad being ignored on the hook if they actually did gens, but 9 times out of 10 they're doing everything but saving me or doing gens, it's super annoying.
---
Not much. I expected to be jumped when on the last gen, she finally arrives but I refuse to run, pop gen for the gate, run as she misses and then she dc'd.
---
I went from weariness, to pride, to relief and then disappointment in 20 seconds.
---
Move skill check to mouse btn 4 and you can do gens and take a sip of beverage all day
---
I'd absolutely love to see Jason in this game even though I know it'll never happen.
---
I would report this to behaviour with a full screenshot
---
yeah this happens to me so often. survivors make mistakes and blame me for tunneling. sometimes i dont have the time to leave the hooked survivor when a guy unhooks him and instantly hides. well... sry for the just unhooked survivor, but i have only two options. follow scratch marks to find a survivor or .... ignore scratch marks and randomly search for who knows what, which obviously isnt a real option.
---
or sometimes a survivor that had already been hooked randomly walks into me, while i wasn't even searching anyone. that happens a lot after rank reset and sry, but again, randomly letting someone escape just isn't an option.
---
There's no way this guy is telling the truth. He's just being a salty scrote.

Thank you!  The trapper weapon and Pizza What logo are the other changes, for anyone who didn't spot them.
---
Take resilience as well, and be injured. No mither?!?! Gotta plan for the late game.
---
A disguise ability would never work well as long as Survive with friends exists. 
---
The idea has been around for years now and the reason for it being garbage won't ever change.
---
I really wanna see all the survivors get killed by the ground spider at the same time
---
The main change is it now forces the survivors to act at endgame rather than the killer. Before time was always on the survivors side in chases, the longer the better. 
---
Particularly on structures like the harvester, shack etc a survivor could waste a shit load of time at endgame, now they have to leave that structure if they want to live.
---
It will also end standoffs for the most part. It also shakes up games where you have killed 3
---
Other than that not much will change, 3 minutes is still a long time, survivors usually will have saved everyone or died in that timeframe anyway
---
Yeah mismatches are common. Unfortunately you will need to deal with the skill gap by doing what you can to fill it as quick as possible.
---
I have two pieces of advice.
---
1. Play both killer and survivor. Killer cause this will obviously increase your killer skills directly. Survivor cause it will teach you survivor tactics and abilities. Use that knowledge to predict survivors play.
---
2. Don‚Äôt kill survivors for a while. Might sound stupid and if you are desperate to kill you can skip this advice cause practice will make prefect anyways. I however increase my killer skills tremendously by not killing.
---
During the lunar event in which killers and survivors competed for coins to unlock cosmetics, I had got all the coins needed. I then decided to stop killing survivors so they could get the coins too. I did not want to stop playing though so I would not tell them what I was doing. I would hunt them down and hook them all twice and on the third time I‚Äôd merely carry them to the hook and drop them in front of it. I still get to play and try get there coins. 
---
This did two things for me. It let my play without any feelings of salty toxicity. If the survivors escaped before I got all of them ‚Äúhooked‚Äù three times it was all good cause I wasn‚Äôt going to kill them anyways. If survivors sent my toxic messages all the better cause they became funny when I had been letting them win anyways. Now that I‚Äôm killing again my lack of salty toxicity has carried over. Playing nice changed my outlook on the game and I no longer have any ill will regardless of what happens in the match. I think helping survivors out kind of develops a fondness for them in a killers heart. They come to feel like your children and even if you have a match in which you get stomped and even if they try to rub it in you end up feeling an odd sense of pride, ‚ÄúGood job kids :)‚Äù If the opposite happens and you kill a survivor who then sends you hate mail, you feel like you want to comfort them, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry sport you‚Äôll get em next time ;)‚Äù Point being it helps you not get frustrated while you up your skills.
---
The second thing not killing did for me was it forced me to play with all four survivors in the match the entire time. No making things easier by removing a pair of little gen-repairing hands. It‚Äôs harder but it teaches you how to juggle chasing survivors and disrupting repair attempts. Basically it‚Äôs like killer boot camp you learn faster by going through tougher games but that‚Äôs ok cause of the first point. 
---
TL;DR
---
1. Play survivor too
---
2. Don‚Äôt kill survivors, instead attempt to hook them all twice and for the third hook just drop them at its base.
---
Hope my tips help :)

I will always say Feng and Spirit should've been in the same DLC
---
I always try and hit the space bar with my phone, works surprisingly often
---
People are overthinking the end game collapse. This is nothing but a way to prevent survivors from holding the game hostage or from sitting at the exit gates, waiting for the killer to push them out. 
---
Sure for SWF groups it will be exciting to play against the clock to make sure that two or more survivors escape but in solo queue, it won't change anything. 
---
I myself play nothing but solo and what I see are survivors sitting at the exit gates or near it with **zero** intention to go back into the trial to help, while the killer is chasing the poor soul who was found before or after the 5th gen was completed. Even if the killer doesn't camp and start moving far enough for a safe unhook, they still won't leave the premises of the exit gates. Not to mention when NOED happens, they just leave and let you die even if you are on first hook, which should be more than enough time to look for the lit totem. 
---
The end game collapse will reward on altruism. Everything you described will rely on survivors not dipping out as soon as they can.
---
People have been talking about tbagging survivors all day ....

I made a video with some more oblivious survivor/killer or close call gameplay moments if someone is interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UChazY15tA
---
Most maps the spawns of the doors are easy to patrol and watch both of them.  If you catch that survivor before he can finish it which should be stupid easy you're now in an easy 4k death chase.  You obviously want it to be all killer sided but objectively there isn't much balance in this for the other side.
---
Lol. Many many people play both. Dont put yourself on a pedestal. As some one who plays both. Killer is easier.
---
10/10 so relatable
---
I think just adding the "missed hits While berzerked will end the effect" wouldve been enough.
---
Noice
---
just reading through the changes i'd say i'm excited too. endgame was so frustrating. survivors not leaving or when the last survivor was greedy and kept searching for the hatch... or fucking hatch stand-offs. usually i dont try to kill the last survivor when he's full health and just let him escape. its feels super bad though. good that this will be gone soon.
---
the one thing that might stay frustrating are those super stealthy survivors that try to find the hatch, because they have no chance finishing the gens. had a few games where the survivor never sprinted for multiple minutes. when i close the hatch.. what then? there wont be the endgame collapse thing, right? this can lead to another snorefest...
---
there's a risk to the changes though. bhvr keep changing the game a lot. this could make veterans leave the game, when the game becomes too different from what we liked playing and the only thing left of dbd will be the name...
---
The Deep Wound changes is also a massive buff to borrowed time. With something like Dr. Worldwide or on The Game you basically will never have survivors go down from not mending.
---
Generally speaking this is a shitty thing to do and a poor decision.  That being said there are certain teamates you need to die on their first hook.  For example pallet wasters and farmers.  If I catch you camping pallets to immediately toss them and watch you burn through 4 pallets in 30 seconds I will make sure you die on first hook.  If I catch you yolo farming myself or teamates off hooks in front of the killer I will make sure you die on first hook.  Some people are liabilities not teamates.
---
In that chest is your hopes of escaping Myers alive.

" [In order to lose Stillness Crows, a Survivor needs to start interacting with something in the area or leave it and move on to another area of the Map.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Crows)  "
---
What bothers me is ppl are not even giving it a chance instead they are just crying about it
---
I love when people do the stupid flashlight thing that Kate did there lol
---
That sounds so much better, I hated being the Killer and finding the hatch and just being like "ok I roam and try to find them before they get this or I camp and I lose the trade regardless."
---
The people I was going against I thought was either just really bad, having a bad day or really tired. Turned out, they were rank 18, 19 and 20 so I'm just like oh they're brand new and either using 1 perk or none.
---
The best part was, she didn't even run. I never even used my stalk with her. All I did was stand behind her and once she attempted to blind me I hit her once and she instantly DC'ed. I just wanted her to run.  üòÇ

Standoff is a bad mechanic that shouldnt exist.

---
I mean it's pretty situational, unless you've downed someone close to a gate you won't be able to get to it and back to the survivor in time. They'll get picked up by their teammates in the meantime.
---
And even if you want to hook them for bloodwarden, it'll only make it harder for the hooked guy to live. Bloodwarden won't do much if it starts at the start of the endgame. It's only 1 minute and if the survivors aren't at the gate then it's just pointless.
---
Mending for 20 minutes so you can finish your meal.
---
It won't happen that often, opening the gate is mostly just to force the survivors to get out. If the killer still wants to try and kill you, you won't see them trying to open it.
---
No, bloodwarden being useful with these changes will still be pretty rare. It's nowhere near being a must-run meta perk. Relax.
---
Imagine not taking 5s to check the top or sticked thread and create a useless thread instead.
---
Apparently no one understands humor.
---
Pts
---
A survivor just literally rage quit because I just stay put and didn't go to the exit gate to watch him butt dancing. He could have just escaped, but no. He just waited for minutes. I know he was butt dancing coz I took a peek from behind the wall. I'm glad they're gonna implement this collapse end game. But honestly, 3 minutes is still generous. They should make it shorter, and pause when a survivor is downed, hooked or injured.
---
At least when it happened to Freddy, we had only the character to lose. I feel bad for anyone who invested real money into the Legion. BHVR needs to stop pulling this shit. Selling characters just to then change their core mechanics walks the very thin line of false advertising.
---
I had this bug one time yesterday. I Just wanted to read lore and then i saw Sidney Prescott. There will be Dwight Fairwield, so i clicked on right arrow but there was only Dwight lore. When i back to Jane lore there was just normal Dwight title.
---
I second this. Changed the action bind from Space to one of the side mouse buttons, and I can't stress enough how good it feels to be able to drink/eat AND hit skillchecks atthe same time. I'm also pretty sure it helped me hit great skillchecks more often.
---
Yeah I think that's a possibility.  I'm hoping that it wont be an epidemic but at the very least the timer means it will only last so long.
---
Why does it say "once end-game phase is activated all generators will be blocked by the entity"? How can you activate the end-game phase without completing the generators?
---
But bro, the killer is supposed to be op bro, what are you a trash survivor main? Typical fucking survivor bro the killer is meant to kill you, you're probably a fucking MegHead  /s
---
Yeah sure and now he will probably be the least played Killer. So you could say that surv mains were the only one who won on the nerf.
---
If you find the hatch first you still get a free escape for doing little to no work to deserve the escape. Door spawns are RNG except on the game.
---
You try to make me depip from my spot at rank 1?
---
Basement Bubba would like to know your location
---
Why ??? Im a killer main and this doesnt feel like a nerf to me at all. Saying that ¬´¬†survivor mains¬†won¬†¬ª on that is not only dumb, but it shows me how you look at the community as a whole and at the devs decision making. Yes they make mistakes, but who doesnt ? The new Legion isn‚Äôt even on the PTB yet
---
U right
---
"survivors are extremely overpowered compared to killers though" 
---
Are you still stuck in 2016/2017? Survivors are not overpowered they are at their lowest point right now and the only reason I can see for them being overpowered is swf, which people need to realise that not every single game they play is a swf. If anything solo survivors makes the killer more "ocerpowered"
---
I understand this new feature but to me its bullshit... When I play solo survivors, Ive played a lot of game in which I actually NEED time to perform action, like saving a team mate from a camper, healing a slug... You ve to play stealthy and wait for an opportunity to do a safe save.
---
It just gonna force EGOIST behaviour, cause you wont even take the time to save a mate, cleanse a Noed, or whatever, you just gonna open the gate and leave. When I play surv I love the idea of challenge and being altruistic so everyone not get killed... But this ... 
---
This is lazyness. Lazyiness because that's not a solution to anything. Lazyness cause instead of going to an in-depth balancing and gameplay changing, BHVR is just patching here and there depending on the mistakes they did on the previous one. Lazyness cause they don't even try to think about a solution by themselves, but just take what the community says.
---
The ones that talk are not necessarly the ones that are right. Bhvr, take your responsabilities and give a directon to your game.
---
If killers are crying having survivors staying at the gates is just the reflect of having a bad killer game.  Deal with it. You actually have to get gud in this game. Not conforting bad skill with a lazy solution.
---
I sometimes do it to hide more from killer in places like these tires that are C shaped and there is a totem in there. Sure it makes noise bit it seems like everyone is deaf
---
Ima be honest. The Basement should be blocked of as soon the endgame starts so this doesn't happen at all.
---
Are there not... survivor mains?
---
Don't you know BBQ IS OP JUST LIKE BLOODWARDEN AND WHISPERS /s
---
My only problem with this is that the last survivor won't stand a chance. Other three survivors die, leaving the last survivor having to finish the last three generators (last survivor did two while the others survivors were getting hooked).  The hatch has always been my last option when getting put with an incompetent team. And now that the killer can close the hatch, I'm left with a 1v1 match with three generators under a time limit (like if that's possible).
---
Just makes me not want to play survivor anymore.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. Unfortunately patch 2.6.0 ruined the Adept Killers. Instead of just a 4k, you have to 4k and get a Merciless, which can be nearly impossible depending on your rank and Killer.
---
I'm really hoping it will cause some clutch last minute saves but I'll have to see what the perks look like after they tweak them. It's  likely endgame survivor perks will be more meta.
---
The thing that bothers me the most is the fact the hatch will always when there‚Äôs one survivor left. If I kill 3 people with 5 gens left still, they will get rewarded with the opportunity to escape through the hatch? That‚Äôs just wrong in my opinion. 
---
Also as survivor if I happen to face a pig with noed and blood warden, basically I‚Äôm fucked and will not be enjoyable at all
---
Not my fault the video shows him patrolling the hook in the beginning and then face camping at the end. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know. Pigs will fly before they get shit working correctly but a bitch can hope.
---
Legion looks like terrorists from terrorhunt
---
Actually, it did. It bought this for me on our ten-year anniversary. Not only is it my lover, it's also my best friend and my soulmate. I'm not ashamed of who i love, nor should i be. For someone with strange abilities due to, i assume, accidental exposure to radioactive cabinet blood, you're not very tolerant of those different to you. You're on the wrong side of history Dwight.
---
There is, but survivor mains dont ¬´¬†win¬†¬ª an argument. Someone that exclusively play survivor doesnt see the game as a whole and cannot judge the balance of the game
---
This is actually a bug in the game. They can't leave. If they drop off the map past the campfire it puts them back in the playfield. However, they still can't leave or interact with any objects in the playfield even if they drop off the map. I'm not sure how the end game collapse will fix this issue if it only applies to the playfield.
---
If you ask the community, the Legion Haters United Club‚Ñ¢ would be like ‚Äúidk just delete him op killer‚Äù
---
That's another very good question. Lol
---
The RNG ain't exciting.
---
It feels dumb when you're held in place for 25 seconds and it feels like you got cheated when they escape on the first try.
---
12 seconds is the same time it takes to wiggle off the killers shoulder, which is more than reasonable imo.
---
Also, Trapper's always been strong among new players. His issue is that he's garbage against players who know what they're doing.
---
Hey it‚Äôs gonna be summer soon, how about instead of that we start recommending the bikini cosmetics for all female survivors instead :^) also speedo David and Dwight would be pretty funny to see.
---
Just get up. Get some food. Watch TV. wait until he dcs. Do random stuff as long as you can. Hold the game hostage back
---
Can you do some gold/ silver ones? those looks really really amazing
---
It still will tho, but this time all the power is with the killer.
---
that's the main reason I don't get how people are triggered by t-bagging after the survivor dropped a pallet. they don't gain any distance on you, why do you complain.
---
I'm thinking of the combo noed + blood Warden. You down √† Survivor,  then proceed to open one door, collapse starts, you hook the Survivor, blood Warden procs, survivors are now doomed
---
Interestingly, he was interacting with everything he could, including totems, windows, chests, pallets, that were leftover. As well as starting the whole exit gate BM by standing in front, i chase him, he runs in and out of the map, then goes behind me to bait me into a chase again. The guy knew he was toying with me from the beginning by baiting me for his teams safety (who he wasnt teamed with).
---
what is the reason that makes you want a trapper buff? O.o
---
Not if the survivor finds it first or mindgames the killer by standing at the gate as far from the hatchet as possible to open it, or bait the killer Into leaving the hatchet to check the gate.
---
Seems better tbh.

Have a read on why your contribution gets upvoted, while ours didn't. [Your post fits right into the low-effort karma farm this sub has turned into.](http://brentwrites.com/quality-content-clickbait/) Don't be surprised that these stereotypes exist when you're such a prime example.
---
I guess it depends how much a survivor cares about getting extra bloodpoints on a case by case basis. Perhaps that will help provide incentive but it's hard to say.
---
shld put another level where doing gens while taking a sip and still hitting the skillcheck in a panic
---
Same here, found a way to not lose: wank before you play.
---
I think you're full of shit and want broken exploits to remain in the game. How often is this ever the case with borrowed time using the mend timer bar? None. He's also receiving a speed buff so you don't have to rely on or use his power much in a chase. He's a regular 115% m1 killer now with a dash attack that applies deep wounds and can still negate loops. Sorry you feel the need for cheap ass cheesing of exploits with broken as fuck add ons and frenzy stab spam because you can't hit someone in the first swing in order to down people.
---
Im setting up to play Drunk by Daylight with my fiancee (tested it the other day, got decently buzzed, adjusted the rules list accordingly) but Im almost always playing high. I think my personal favorite moment went a little bit like
---
"Damn my breathing is so loud, I thought Michael was supposed to be sneaky."
---
...
---
"wait...I'm playing surviv--OH SHIT."
---
Funnily enough i did that, he finally gave in and i was ready to leave it for 15 hours. There went his 4 hours of memeing and bming. I tried send him a request during the whole debacle but got nothing just to chat. If what the first guy comment said was true about this being a bug, then I would‚Äôve dc‚Äôd after chatting to him.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
You're kind of new to the game. And it's not your fault nor survivor side, it's just the marchmaking and the people that are taking advantage of it.
---
Try Whisper, it's one of the best perk in the game ;)
---
But we're talking about legion here, all I see is the removal of the moonwalking and the frenzy spamming strats and a buff to his movement speed.
---
You need to consult a therapist as to why you're aroused by a video game
---
Because he's pretty shit.
---
Retrieving his traps eats up so much time that the game is half over by the time you get to start playing it.
---
Her face looks like a pumpkin at Halloween, I like it.
---
In the old days, when they didn‚Äôt get an icon on their hud ‚Äúshudders‚Äù
---
And then don‚Äôt heal and get downed again
---
Yeah I told my mate to do gens but LF wouldn‚Äôt let him leave the hatch. The reason he waited so long is that LF facecamped me and my other two teammates ignored my flailing arms and unhooked me right in front of him. Don‚Äôt think my mate wanted to reward that out of principle.
---
It‚Äôs not the last survivors fault if his team is potato.
---
On the asylum map, it literally spawns in the middle of a field with no cover at all.
---
It's like lag-switching on yourself
---
&gt; This is actually a bug in the game. They can't leave.
---
Not true. You can walk past the exit gates and it will end the match as it normally would.
---
I always save reverse-beartraps for end-game.. Let's see how hard is gonna hit me
---
You think deliverance could be the new meta? I feel like I can't count on randoms every match to unhook me. I'll just do it myself.
---
That wasn't a facecamp as much as it was a "did you just see what I just seen?" Moment. You can tell because he looks at the dead guy, then the hooked guy, then back at the dead guy and so forth. The video ends there so we don't know if he stayed there in front of the hooked survivor, but i doubt it
---
Its dirty playstile
---
Hate the game not the player. Seemed that if he "camped" here then it was a good move.
---
I talk more rubbish than usual when playing drunk. Also become more altruistic haha I think being drunk makes me play slightly better.
---
Video proof  :)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_N0CfSjI3g&amp;t=242s
---
It would affect many other perks.
---
Finally survivors don‚Äôt just get a cop out victory using the hatch, now if survivors win they‚Äôve earned it
---
not always. like i've already said, I watched a friend walk out 2 exits 5 times and it wouldn't let her escape. she tried the hatch and there was no prompt and it wouldn't let her do it. I spectated the whole thing. she couldn't do a single thing except try what we told her to try or let the killer kill her.
---
What a wanker. Good thing my watermark is on it!
---
&gt; The only time I'm nice to one particular survivor is if they try to befriend me first.
---
This is why I said that confronting a killer at the beginning usually buys me a ticket out. Reasons behind this could vary: confusion, being friendly, respect for not being afraid, etc.
---
I ain't listening to that
---
&gt;not always. like i've already said, I watched a friend walk out 2 exits 5 times and it wouldn't let her escape. she tried the hatch and there was no prompt and it wouldn't let her do it. I spectated the whole thing. she couldn't do a single thing except try what we told her to try or let the killer kill her.
---
This is a rare event, then. Every time I witnessed someone going out of bounds like this or had it happen to me, people wouldn't leave even though they could just walk past the exit gates (towards the inside of the map).
---
He‚Äôs not just a normal man though ? He‚Äôs a supernaturally enhanced killer, who‚Äôs able to traverse realms at will with his caravan.
---
This happens to me on xbox sometimes idk why
---
If survivors are smart they open the other exit gate ..  always always open both exit gates u dont know when killers are running it
---
I would mind game the killer.. start on one gate to make them think I'm there and hopefully get to the other gate with some time to open it
---
Shhhhhh survivors are underpowered.
---
Exactly, most of the time I didn't even try to look for the last survivor, I hate running around the map repeatedly for 10 minutes, I always thought the endgame was so bad. Same, bud, I can't even believe people were doing hatch-standoffs for 20-30 minutes, how stubborn can a person be? I always take the loss when both of us reach the hatch at the same time, always, not worth my time. 
---
This is the issue I also had over the years since 2016, this kind of effort to change gameplay was missing for so long in DBD, I can see when people will say that this kind of change has a huge impact on gameplay because they're absolutely right, it does. Since release DBDs gameplay always felt sort of unfinished, you know? This is why I'm happy to see some good and dynamic changes like this.
---
I personally want him to be a stealth killer, Almost no terror radius and high jumpscare potential so I would pick Shapeshift into survivors.
---
What do you all think?
---
I thought it was 50% per box you search, where the last one is 100% guaranteed to take the trap off.
---
My first match I was basically camping this dude and I hit him thinking I guess I'll run his hp down. I got bored and heard the save notification and thought it was some real bullshit. I got him on that hook why didnt he die?
---
You were obviously too dangerous to be left alive!
---
Pathetic
---
I hate rank reset. Use Ruin, get a 4k with 4-5 gens left. Don't use Ruin, tbag gallore.
---
I've made it from rank 5 to 2 before with Freddy and no Ruin, but now I can't even play rank 13-17 without feeling like I need to run it on every killer or else I get dabbed on.
---
what about when you queue for 20 minutes and get dodged, then queue for another 20 and get dodged. suddenly it's been over an hour and you still haven't played
---
Usually cause I'm tired of hook trading when there is 5 gens left and everyone is injured lol.
---
Survivor mains don't realize killers aren't obligated to leave the hooked guy when see/hear your dumbass nearby during the hook. This guy is running Bbq and chili so he probably saw that troll coming that way for the save and got between em
---
It does
---
I mean if a survivor goes down to save a hooked basement survivor
---
Freddy end game master? More like nightmare.
---
But the game is being rebalanced around that timer being a threat or playing a big role. The devs even said so when it came to end game perks like Blood Warden never mind Hope, NOED, Remember Me, or any of the other perks for both Killer and Survivor. All of them are getting rebalanced for the new End Game.
---
Even the games mechanics are being reworked thanks to that timer. Hatch spawning/opening, Killers interacting with hatcth/gates, and the timer itself is effected by wounded/downed/hooked Survivors.
---
The game is getting rebalanced around the new End Game. But the End Game isn't going to do much of anything really. Yes, having a way to stop squatters is nice but that 3 minute timer doesn't change why people did that. It is still perfectly safe to do so as once the gates are open there isn't much a Killer can do to stop someone running out.
---
This just limits the BM to 3 minutes. Better than nothing but it does nothing to prevent a Killer from becoming powerless once gates open.
---
because the survivors don't look like babies and some killer mains are too pussy to actually want a challenge
---
"few seconds" haha ok buddy. I've queued for over an hour before because of dodging.
---
survivors would dodge in lobby if they could see the killer. so maybe they should let survivors see the killer too? or just don't let the killer see the survivors. have some shadowy figures appear and just show their name and ping.
---
Yeah, no one reads the whole thing though lol
---
NOED and BW are both likely to be changed due to this
---
Trapper is my favorite killer and I think he should start with 2 or maybe 3 traps by default and it would be good. Then make the bags let him carry 4,5 and 6 traps respectively.
---
Also let him re-set traps without picking them up. I don't think he is weak right now tbh and these would be some cool QoL changes.
---
I remember one game as clown, I accepted defeat, waited in the basement for them to leave, watched TV, for 10 minutes, they still hadn‚Äôt left........end game can‚Äôt come fast enough.
---
because they dodge the second you change back to your nice cosmetics. as stupid as it sounds, it's just a reality we've all accepted lmao.
---
me and my friends kept getting dodged when he had nice cosmetics, so we changed all our survivors to default cosmetics and suddenly no dodging for the rest or the night.
---
He has 6 traps to work with on live.
---
These changes wouldn't change that.
---
It just does away with gathering your traps, letting you start with all of them like Hag.
---
ikr. i dodge p3 survs as survivor lmfao they're all urban evaders that don't do anything.
---
they used to be god tier loopers but now claudette mains have just become immersed survivors that don't know how to loop. killers still don't seem to have realised that
---
the game has only just begun, i still kill you,*clap clap* zero bloodpoints lost
---
Why would close gates be bad? The killer can't guard them both either way.
---
I can hit great skill checks without looking, just not very often
---
Just bind it to a mouse button and drink with your left hand.
---
No it isn't. You're comparing leaving in the lobby, which does nothing other than make the survivors wait longer for another match, to a survivor leaving in a live game, which will ruin an entire match for the 3 remaining survivors and the killer. It will also make the survivors add ons and offerings go to waste
---
10/10 pallet use
---
The weird thing about this for me, a killer rage quitting is almost always 100% funny,  but  survivors leaving can be so sad
---
I get this ALOT I hope BHVR can fix this with the servers coming in Summer. I hope
---
For trapper let him have a ultra rare add on that sets all traps on the map automatically and resets used traps without going to them.
---
When will it be out ?
---
What was that pallet drop haha
---
That addon already exists.
---
It was like 1 am I was tired and wanted to get the game over with üòÇ
---
When it opens due to being one survivor left.
---
You these is how rank 10s play
---
They talked about that saying in the Summer to expect that so we still have about a month or two.
---
When is that ?
---
It sounds like a lot at first but there's a lot of luck to consider. Like you could be on the other side of the map when the killer kicks endgame in, plus there's the more confusing maps like The Game and stuff where finding the exit can be an issue, and all that would eat up time. For open maps like the fields and stuff though, yeah, I might agree with you.
---
Cool concept but it just wouldn't work imo. Stealth killer however would be great. I love Scream so I hope ghostface arrives at some point. For me he should be really quick (like in the films) but it would take more hits to down a survivor (simply because of how ineffective ghostface is in the filmsüòÇ). Also Sidney as a Survivor would be great.
---
Then you just leave before the killer hooks the slug because its blatant hes running BW
---
Imagine being the exact person u/kingoftown was talking about. With absolutely zero self-awareness as well. Truly amazing.
---
You report them for holding you hostage also avoiding basement works too.
---
I feel like legions original intent was to be the backstabber
---
The timer pretty much comes to a dead stop when someone is hooked or downed, also the killer has to actually find the hatch if he doesn‚Äôt he has to patrol doors,
---
April 23rd
---
Amazingly fun game, reminds me of spies vs mercs back in the day, but the community is awful, give bad players overpowered characters to play as, and they get cocky thinking they are good.
---
His internet probably went, there's no reason to disconnect there.
---
How the hell do people do this?
---
It's not really on me to work a solution...
---
Could make the close hatch animation really slow. So that it's in the killers interest to close it soon as they can or risk the survivor jumping through or gives them enough time to escape and hide.
---
Yeah but I won‚Äôt have to wait 10 minutes for people to leave,
---
3 minutes minimum after opening gates is a long damn time. Thats more than a full hook transition. When hooked it goes even slower
---
Well dead Rabbit is a great add on so I'd happily take this
---
Then the killer wouldnt close if he knows that there is a survivor around and it goes Into square one again.
---
There was a claudette who ran in a straight line from me and I was Trapper and when they're friends started tea bagging she started doing it too.
---
Please yes!
---
Lol, I'm in the same boat as you. Kill count Is a nice quick way to learn about horror movies

---
They were bad before, the only situations in which they were good was when they either moonwalked or tunneled with frank's mixtape.
---
They removed those things and yes, perhaps the Legion will be even more trash now, but atleast he will no longer be frustrating trash.
---
But who knows, maybe they will actually be better, since we DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ANY OF THE STAT CHANGES, we only know that they decreased his frenzy speed, etc, but we don't know by how much. They also increased the duration, and we don't know how long it'll last, maybe it'll last for a whole minute or more, who knows.
---
I mean thats ur fault no offence. Just hit them out
---
Holy shit what is that
---
if it is billy and it is pretty much a straight shot you are fucked also nurse
---
Everyone knows the totem spots by now, the only survivors who won't sniff out your ruin in less than a minute are survivors you don't need ruin to beat. What's kinda sad is that 1. Killers are so desperate for slowdown that spending an entire perk slot on the first minute of the game is good and 2. Ruin is the only viable hex because it's the only one that does something before it gets broken.
---
I just want Trapper to start with his traps, like all 5 of them without the use of a bag, collecting them take up so much time, sometimes there‚Äôll be one so far away I don‚Äôt even bother collecting it.
---
Wouldn't be broken at all with the last four.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed. Borrowed time got buffed a lot because of legion
---
You must be a survivor main, almost all of these are already addons.
---
survivor can jump through while being closed.
---
Like I said I went for lunch, came back and they still hadn‚Äôt left.
---
Dunno, the only guess I could go with is the certification process to push a patch through on Xbox and PS.
---
Different strokes for different folks. He initiated the chase right next to the hook when he had already been on the hook for at least 15 seconds which means he was camping before the video started. By the time that chase was over with the dude was already almost into his second phase.
---
I don't play that way and that's a pretty weak excuse to camp someone on their very first hook in the very beginning of the match. No one knows he had BBQ and you get more points for walking away from the hook and  putting pressure on gens. They act like they'll never catch them again or something. I don't play that way. Put pressure on gens, don't camp the hook like a huge noob. "oh no someone might get a save while I camp. I better press my face against them until they're on second phase and then post it on reddit." ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I think that sounds very possible but maybe too circumstantial for it to matter greatly, the same way that you can potentially get a 4-man Mori with Rancor and DS.
---
\[T]/
---
It's going to be kind of funny how many killers think they can just close the hatch and leave, only for the key to get 2+ people out then.
---
sometimes it works that way. if the game bugs out like that when you get pulled off of something you can never leave the match unless you die.
---
Plays killer
---
Plays with a fun build rather than a super sweaty one
---
4 man swf
---
Gets destroyed and BMed
---
Plays survivor
---
Killer has iridescent add ons and an ebony mori
---
1 survivor dcs
---
4k with 5 gens still up
---
Same
---
So you don't know about frank's mixtape. Good for you.
---
YOU DO REALIZE THAT IS THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THIS THREAD, CORRECT? @
---
Look at the floor, there's red everywhere. 
---
Since scratchmarks are also red, you won't be able to see them.
---
Yeah, all maps from Clown DLC till now feel bad to play on, its not really balance or anything but they just feel uninspired. Maps like haddonfield really got me excited, but this is really bad rn
---
Oh I'm sorry. I was just waiting for your joke to be funny. ;)
---
Jesus. How about an add-on that uninstalls the survivors game while we're at it.
---
Yeah kinda sucks that new maps only come out when new killers come out and we just get a map variation.
---
Oh, so they haven‚Äôt actually been removed, they‚Äôll still appear on walls and stuff.
---
Appear on walls hahahaaha...
---
Have you played Killer since Chapter 11 went live?
---
I hope you let her live after that.
---
Must me platform specific, they still appear on walls for me at least.
---
at least Mount Ormond Resort is still cool
---
Have a source for where standing still for 3 minutes is bannable? Last I checked only holding the game hostage is. 3 minutes isn't a hostage situation.
---
Get a therapy if playing a game and being bad at it causes you this much rage.
---
If they are 3rd party you can't buy them with shards as far as I know. I'm not certain about leatherface but I know Mike, Laurie, Freddy, quinten and ash can't be bought with shards.
---
So instead of a rework or an additional gimmik to make the killer viable, you say that both sides are happy they made the killer bottom tier... Not really.. and there were no shortage of survivors whining about the ds "fix".
---
Every character costs 9000IS, except the licensed ones. They don't get sales
---
It takes more skill to 4k as the worst killer in the game than it does to 4k as the best killer in the game. Prove me wrong.
---
I 4k a strong 99% of my games when I play Nurse, so does she take skill?
---
Okay, would you tell me why, i as an killer would close the hatch unless i know somehow that youre far away.
---
And the totem you find as survivor is a ToTH boosted Haunted Hround and you know The Spirit is just waiting to get those cheeks.
---
Nah keep it the same, love doing a basement Bubba build every now and again.
---
You can actually see in the short video the timer becomes grey and almost completely stops moving. Hopefully it doubles the amount of time.
---
Apparently alot of people love doing it too lol
---
If you don't close it I'll just run and jump through and it'll take you too long to close it.
---
More than doubling his sleep time is what I consider dumpstering him.
---
Would the hillbilly mains be cool with chainsaw taking twice the time to charge? How about Huntress taking twice as long to wind-up? Nurse only blinks half the distance?
---
If you jump through it and i dont close it then i would just grab you while you jump.
---
I swear even when I run devour hope without ruin the survivors always find it before I get 3 stacks.
---
Lmao I got so many messages getting called noob because I hooked every one in the map and I replied to the guy you where the one who hid in the corner for 8 minutes
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being sarcastic
---
Trapper should spawn with traps and carry as many as he wants
---
Leatherface shouldnt be slowed so dramatically when powering the chainsaw
---
Pig and Myers are fine
---
I'd remove that mechanism myself. It's just not needed.
---
Mettle of Man is cancer and should be reworked just like noed
---
You can watch funGoose on twitch, he is killer main with I believe 7k hours in dbd. And spirit his one of the best killers.
---
I see your point, but at the same time, it's their job. We shouldn't harass them, but we *did* pay for this game.
---
I smoke every time I play. It don't have a negative or positive impact.
---
Doesnt that make the hatchet standoff go Into survivors favor?
---
So you're telling me that the hatch SPAWNS, not opens, when there's 1 surv left? So it spawns open? What about keys then?
---
YES AND IT MAKES ME RAGE THAT HE COMPLAINS ABOUT IT
---
THAT'S PART OF THE PURPOSE
---
She will be a pillow soon enough I'm sure lol
---
Your writeup is solid and you make a lot of good points. I guess my point was that BHVR did not intend to make killers any stronger or weaker when gates are powered/opened. If you think that (after the perks are rebalanced) the killer will still feel just as powerless, I'm inclined to agree with you there. I think the devs still intend for the killer to lose their feeling of power when all gennys are done... And you're probably right to not be thrilled about it, if what you wanted was a buff to killer at endgame.
---
And they always have an anime profile pic,and they think Doctor is OP along with Freddy.
---
If stacks can be gathered faster and legions power ends on a miss this will be great when done right.
---
Well, if the end game timer is active an the killer has em in the basement, maybe you should just cut your losses an leave em behind.
---
I know that's not popular but this is literally part of why they did this, to pressure survivors into being worried and leaving instead of feeling invincible an don't whatever they want.
---
I'm pretty sure in the teaser trailer it says something about leaving your unlucky teammates behind when you have to get out 
---
Maybe this is what they want? We'll have to wait an see happens
---
Still their fault for not leaving tbh
---
Maybe gain a stack per frenzy smack and per Hook?
---
They do, but fairly rarely.
---
Its literally the best way to do something while having a cheeky sip of tea.
---
This is so me
---
You can cgange your privacy settings
---
You teabagging survivors only have yourselves to blame for this.
---
Using your nose to do shit is one of the most fun things to do
---
What if somebody blocks 2 or 3 people in early game? Would this be considered holding the game hostage? There only hope is to DC literally.
---
Why? The killer should be closing it as soon as he finds it and the survivor should go through as soon as killer starts closing it otherwise hell be locked out next to the killer.
---
It incentivises both survivor and killer to interact with the hatch asap.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping.
---
Yeah, 3 minutes is a shit ton of time to get out. And even if someone is hooked (something that forces survivors to stick around) the timer slows down. The concept is super cool, but I'm not really seeing it as anything other than a way to prevent matches from being held hostage. I do like the hatch changes, though.
---
Lol k will do! Thought everyone got the memo?
---
When killer closes hatch, doors are available to be opened
---
Having "integrity" isn't a requirement.  Adhering to the rules of the trial IS.  Personally, I don't understand why people bring "skill" into the argument anyway.  If I get a 4K by doing my thing and win, I don't say I'm an awesomely skilled killer, I just achieved my objective for the trial.  How I do so doesn't matter as long as I play by the rules of the game.  If a survivor feelings are hurt by my tactics, then the onus is on the survivor to get better at hiding and achieving their objectives.  Every single time I have been downed as a survivor is because I screwed up the chase.  I made a mistake and paid for it.  I refuse to be manipulated into playing with arbitrary rules of "honor" when there is no point in doing so, and you get disrespected by survivors when you do.
---
Sorry I don't wanna face a p3 squadette while I'm doing a daily
---
Join the official Dead by Daylight Discord and look for players there
---
The bloodweb will refresh each time you complete one, it won't just stay on the one you have currently. You'll just stay at Level 50 repeatedly getting new bloodwebs with random items until you click the icon in the middle to prestige.
---
Hope that helps!
---
You mean if the survivor finds it within the 3 seconds it'd take to close the hatch? I mean, killer already moves faster, he just has to get there a couple of seconds before.
---
Or you could just buff wake up.
---
Because in its current state leader is outperforming it when it comes to its job
---
Thanks for making my point valid, I'm a killer main.
---
&gt;So im little bit new to dead by daylight and wanted to know something. If you get to level 50 on a character and dont prestige it, do you continue to get items from the bloodweb if u complete it once or does it stop? Is there any other point in prestiging a character other than just to get new teachable perks and cosmics
---
You don't get "new teachable perks" after prestiging. The 3 perks you unlock at level 40, are the only ones. 
---
The bloodwebs are infinite, it doesn't stop at 50 because you need to get all the other perks available in the game and also items + add-ons or offerings. Once you've acquired every perk, you will just get offerings, items and add-ons in your webs. 
---
The reason for prestiging is just the feeling of accomplishment, bloody clothes and slightly better bloodwebs at P3 with additional 9% rarity for every item.
---
So come on little Claudette, looking hungry for some tbags. Here, let me serve endgame collapse 
---
END. GAME COLLAPSE
---
Look at P3 Claudette, she just went and lost the whole match
---
Yo she just got donuted
---
Once you reach level 50, the bloodweb will now refresh every time you complete it. So yes, you can keep earning items for your character. In the middle will be the option to prestige which can be done at any time, but it will cost you all your current perks, items, and add ons on that character.
---
Personally, I prestige my characters to get the new personalisations, but apparently prestiging gives you a higher chance to get higher rarity things in the bloodweb. However, this has been proven false, or at least close to false as the rarity goes up the tiniest bit, so basically unchanged, and I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve gotten a character up to level 50 on a prestige 1 bloodweb, and I still have a bunch of tier 1 versions of perks rather than the tier 3s that I want. In short, prestiging is done to give the character personalisations and ‚Äúincrease the chance‚Äù of higher rarity things appearing, but given that one doesn‚Äôt even happen, it‚Äôs just for the new cosmetics.
---
Basically, prestiging is up to you. I prestige after I‚Äôve gotten maxed out on bloodpoints and I have used as many items as I can on said character so I don‚Äôt waste them, but a lot of people don‚Äôt bother prestiging. It‚Äôs totally up to you though.
---
Every legion I've faced has either moonwalked from the getgo, making them immensely unfun, or they turn to moonwalking and camping when two gens pop before downing anyone. You're basically forced to run close to them in hopes of entering their peripherals and thus keep the chase going, which is just increasing the risk of getting downed dramatically. While they completely gutted legion, at least they will now be forced to play the intended way
---
Honestly Hag looks better than whatever the fuck that is on the right.
---
Entity is gross confirmed.
---
They're adding a feature where any game that's not a 4v1 instantly boots everybody back to the loadout screen with offerings and items kept
---
I've had survivors that DC once they got found.Yes.
---
If there‚Äôs one survivor left then I always consider giving them hatch, UNLESS it‚Äôs a Claudette
---
Actually Yea
---
I agree that I think he's weak and totally stupid fucking mend is dumb as rocks since it barely even gets used with their tunnel playstyle
---
But hey at least 115% will be nice, I don't mind some of the other m1 killers, I play a lot of doc / pig / wraith
---
But why were you recording?
---
The entity goes so deep! omg
---
Go follow https://twitter.com/Labell_xx for your health.
---
The reason it was changed, was because he would 'confirm' a hit(The chainsaw stops entirely on its own), but not get the kill. There has been considerably fewer of them, but I've still encountered one every now and then, and it feels like complete BS. On the other hand, I've also had hits that should NEVER have connected(The survivor wasn't even in my line of sight), and I've quite literally been hit THROUGH obstacles because the chainsaw prioritises survivors. 
---
If they had fixed the ghost hit for his chainsaw properly, there'd be no need to add extra range. It's a bandaid fix that broke more than it really fixed, and some chainsaw hits are as dubious as huntress hatchets
---
We rented this game. They can take it away from us for basically any reason. They wouldn‚Äôt but we still shouldn‚Äôt lose our shit the *moment* something drops.
---
Ooh i see. I was confused because i knew the ps4 had a recording feature
---
If you see that,and by chance you can play nurse to an extent that you can land hits,just switch to it and fucking rip them to shreds,that's what I do most of the time.
---
Damn. 2 dcs with Freddy? Well done
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH "TOO POOR"?
---
using M4 for skill checks and M2 for struggle to have one hand free
---
Tbh love the art but how does her mask do that?
---
REPORT THEM AFTER THE MATCH. IT'S DEFINETLY A GAME VIOLATION.
---
Yea I don't think people realize how nice it will be to force open the gates when Generators are done, minimize your game, use bathroom, get snacks, come back in 3-5 minutes to a score screen with ignored survivor comments. 
---
To delay the game now, they'd have to actively avoid doing generators. If they can eternally loop the killer there w/o pallets, that's just the killer's problem at that point.
---
The Endgame Collapse had to start somewhere!
---
Alright cool I'm not at home at the moment I'll be on later though you can add me on psn my username is the same thing as my reddit name .
---
Sick, I‚Äôm out too so I‚Äôll add you whenever I‚Äôm home
---
r/waterniggas stand up
---
This is infinity war
---
They could also join the DBD community on PS4.
---
Damn, beat me too it
---
Look at Claudette they just Dc‚Äôed first down
---
What's your deal? This post made me laugh. Nothing wrong with that..
---
I don't know how I feel about this... Even though you made a lot of accurate observations, we can't really complain. Rewind back a few chapters and we have:
---
* CHAPTER 6 - A Nightmare On Elm Street‚Ñ¢ (Freddy): They added Springwood, Badham Preschool. 
---
Completely new design sharing just two buildings with Haddonfield and Shack. 
---
* CHAPTER 7 - The SAW‚Ñ¢ Chapter (Pig): They added Gideon Meat Plant, The Game. 
---
Once again, completely new map and this one doesn't even share any structures with other maps besides basement.
---
* CHAPTER 8 - Curtain Call (Clown): They added Crotus Prenn Asylum, Father Campbell's Chapel. 
---
Here is where the "laziness" strikes for the first time since Leatherface but the main building and the wagon area are really well done. 
---
* CHAPTER 9 - Shattered Bloodline (Spirit): They added Yamaoka Estate, Family Residence. 
---
Nowadays, after a few patches, it lost a little of its greatness but at first look (back in PTB), it was a breathtaking map with its beauty and originality. Is it a good map gameplay wise? Not quite but, that doesn't remove the fact that devs worked hard on this map and delivered a really well design. 
---
* CHAPTER 10 - Darkness Among Us: They added Ormond, Mount Ormond Resort.
---
Just like Yamaoka, another completely brand new map sharing just shack and added new loops to the game that are now present in Mother's Dwelling and Purgation Temple. It is way better than Yamaoka gameplay wise, the only problem from what I can tell are seeing auras but this can be easily fixed. Overall, I am satisfied with this map. 
---
* CHAPTER 11 - Demise Of The Faithful: They added Red Forest, The Temple of Purgation.
---
We are back at the so called lazy work again, after they delivered **two** completely brand new maps. Am I happy with the way this map looks? Just like Clown's, not really. I always expect a completely brand new map but at the same time, I understand that it won't always be possible. As long as it doesn't become a trend to release reworked maps **every** DLC, I won't mind it here and there.
---
This update is gonna kill the whole fecking game...
---
I just rebound it to right click. Kind of surprised that it isn't more common.
---
There isnt much reason to not leave right now. rank is pointless, most long term players have the perks they want and they just want to have fun. Tons of stuff in game is just unfun to go against. Certain maps or killers or playstyles right now are particularly annoying
---
I agree the people just disconnecting because they got downed quickly or because they lost 3 gens or ruin immediately are annoying though
---
Licenses can‚Äôt be bought with Shards for legal reasons. Licenses include Quentin, Ash, Laurie, Tapp, Leatherface, Myers, Freddy, and Amanda/Pig.
---
That kind of activity, as well as handing over points, usually occurs within the 3 minute window anyway. You can start a stopwatch on your phone/2nd screen to confirm (note that we don't know the delay time that happens with hooks yet).
---
Since when had the entity been a girl?
---
I'll have to respectfully disagree. If you're not next to a vault or a pallet when he finds you, and he knows how to facesaw, you won't be standing in the next five seconds.
---
It happens more on open maps, e.g. coldwind, but can still readily happen on lery's.
---
Maybe dont play omegablink nurse with ruin, cant say im surprised
---
Honestly this is the exact process fbky thought
---
-hook guy
---
-kick gen that‚Äôs about 10m away
---
-turn around to leave
---
-see scratch marks
---
-circle around hook till I catch up to guy
---
-video starts
---
I even hailed ass across the map after the clip ended. At no point was I planning on camping. I was at that hook for only as long as that guy wanted to loop me there. Which wasn‚Äôt very long...
---
Beautiful! Enjoy!
---
I as a killer usually dont mind cool outfits. I do get a little worried when I see full bloody in all 4 of the survivors, but I still play. Unless they bring a flashlight. Then I get annoyed 'cause I have to ruin their game with a mori :s .
---
I don't know why they bothered creating the animation for the Entity kill Survivors, no-one is EVER going to see it in an actual match...
---
Please, DO NOT show the progress bar of the end game collapse. It will give us more immersion this way imo, and survivors won't wait the last second to escape the exit gates because they won't know how much time is left.
---
Well yeah i know but theres still somethings they can do to make him better like making it so survivors can't resume mending like snap out of it
---
Was this made by the same guy who drew the one were he destroyed a gen? It would make sense as a little precursor to this.
---
People not loading in is another thing entirely
---
I think it's less about actually killing the survivors more about not having a game drag out for a long ass time when it should have ended minutes ago
---
Why would you hit them? Just wait for them to unlock it and grab.
---
https://i.imgur.com/0lwr9bP.png
---
I feel like bhvr does everything in their power to prolong the games. You get punished for 4king too quickly by not getting sacrifice pips and now there is gonna be no point in killing quickly cause the last survivor is gonna get the hatch regardless.
---
After the update the best way to 4k is probably gonna be stand on hatch and wait for the survivor to come, close it and kill them. If the survivor doesnt come to the hatch you stand on it untill they pop a gen. Then you close it and run to the gen and look for them. I feel like people are gonna start abusing the new hatch mechanic to get their well deserved 4k
---
Elaborate?
---
Your playing beyond broken nurse, I can‚Äôt blame them.
---
Don't worry, she'll kill all of you before NOED activates.
---
Thank you, it doesn‚Äôt explain that in the video.
---
True. I'm just wondering if people think we will see keys being used moreoften and less than as a meme item. It seems more useful now that killers can close the hatch.
---
Theoretically, this could be done with 5 generators up with 3 survivors in the basement, and one unsuspecting survivor could run around and do all 5 gennys and open up the gates, dooming the 3 survivors.
---
Honestly if I was BHVR I'd just widen the stairs, or somehow turn NoClip on killers when they're in basement.
---
god you're unbearable
---
I cant remember but does closing the hatch start the 3 minute timer? I thought i saw opening a gate only does? If this is the case then this would just be a hatch standoff like it is now
---
I mean Franklin‚Äôs Demise is great when 2+ of the little shits bring tools..
---
Both of the other responses here are trash. It's not your fault your competition were pussies.
---
With all due respect you sound like a whiney bitch, you will dc if a nurse has ANY add-ons? Are you kidding me? You just listed a lot of reasons to DC and people like you are one of the main problems this game is facing. You don't get your way so you ruin it for everyone else trying to play? The killer is meant to be the killer for a reason, they shouldn't have to tone down what they use or who they play as because people like you don't like it.
---
+1 the giant bar at the top ruins the experience.
---
why would you do that to yourself
---
I used to but it takes too long. If I really like the killer/survivor and the p3 looks cool ill get it
---
STttttttttttttoooop, stttttttttttttttoooooop with the survivor nerf suggestions just stop.
---
 why would you do that to yourself
---
I like how everyone is commenting on the pallet drop, like come on guys... of course he is going to waste pallets he is using urban evasion :)
---
Oh yes, I remember the days when you could take a tight turn around one of the L or T walls to dodge the chainsaw. Now the chainsaw looks like it hits you right through it.
---
Agreed
---
Turn gay
---
I love you for this post.
---
In my opinion if a bug happens to someone that can cause them to hold game hostsge, the player that the bug happened to should dc. This is assuming killer‚Äôs internet isn‚Äôt shit causing survivors to get stuck in places
---
 omegablink nurse with ruin Nurse complaining, what the fuuck
---
I have skill check button changed to M3 just to have a free hand while healing/doing gens.
---
2:30 is already long enough and in a lot of cases :30 is long enough since some of the time most people get their trap off on the first box they go to anyways. Survivors shouldn't see trap boxes before the timer is active. I'm not sure if you've ever seen the movies but the entire point of jigsaw traps is for people to make choices under duress. Not casually heal and walk around without a care in the world until their team finishes a gen which by then 2 or 3 boxes have been gone through. That's why the only thing traps are good for is delaying the game against solo queue survivors.
---
Wait what, who?
---
Players like me dont care about rating. We just want to scare survivors.
---
No not really same as killers have no real reason to thicken it
---
Nah man it's definetly not his perks and addons fault that everyone was dc'ing. I mean yeah, the build he's using is very strong but just deal with it and play the damn match, even when you know you probably lose it.
---
I actually through of a perk that fits this killer concept a couple weeks ago.
---
The Entitys blessing
---
Your devotion to the Entitys ways have not been in vain, the Entity has blessed you with enhanced abilitys.
---
Tier 1/2/3 : Your aura readings are enhanced by 8/8/8 meters and survivors aura readings are weakened by 2/4/8.
---
The survivors  would be able to know of the debuff with an icon similar to dying light or thanatophobia.
---
That's literally what she does without endgame. It changes nothing.
---
People stopped playing because nothing actually changed for years.
---
Remember Me is more useful IMO
---
Say you 3 hook the obsession for max stacks. 1 gen left and you got 3 kills. You close the hatch and start the Collapse. The Survivor needs to open the Exit Gate still and now :46 of that 3:00 is spent on a door
---
"balanced landing"  
---
Did you manage to like land on the roof or anything?
---
The hatch will spawn as usual but will not be open (except if you're the last survivor). So you can still complete all the gens, look for the hatch and open it with a key
---
I‚Äôve seen killers thicken it plenty of times to hide their totems in the hope nobody is running Small Game
---
I have them all and I'm still getting them. Just bone splinters but it's annoying.
---
3 minutes is still kinda enough to take RBT off + they will search for it injured which prolongs the timer. If there's less than a minute left probably pretty much a death sentence tho
---
Agreed, it's a perk that can stay how it is for the memes.
---
You're right on the first bit, but the Killer closing the hatch auto-powers the Exit Gates and triggers Endgame, so I don't think it'd stop.
---
I'm still coolest than their tho
---
Oh that is so cool. I didn't quite get that from the video. I assumed that once the hatch was closed, the generators would get unblocked and the match would go on as usual.
---
The timer from Borrowed Time will not go down in the Killer's terror radius, regardless if you are chased or not.
---
lmao its the clausette mains
---
If I play while drinking I am way more altruistic
---
Ikr. F13 basically already has it for ages
---
Ohhhh, thanks!
---
People who camp pallets piss me off ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Great. Now I REALLY want this in the game.
---
The funny thing is that it leads to depip which means rank 15 gonna suffer
---
I was only camping because I thought she trapped both doors
---
No I landed and died immediately
---
Awwh, that's a bummer.
---
I‚Äôm just waiting to level up some other characters
---
*neither* of those are crutches. Crutch perks are perks that reward a player for bad gameplay. Urban Evasion promotes a certain playstyle, as does Sprint burst, and neither of them reward bad gameplay. 
---
Old decisive strike was an example of a crutch perk. Mettle of Man is a crutch perk. NOED, unrelenting, Enduring, etc. All of these are crutch perks bc they only trigger when you do something bad and they function to help pad your mistake so you don't suffer for it
---
I wanna say they aren't their own realms to reduce Realm Offerings. Probably the same reason they removed the common and uncommon Realm Offerings
---
The issue is a lot of players are not going to "deal with it" or they deal with it by just leaving. Omegablink nurse is dumb af.
---
I was spooked I had a sip of my drink and panicked
---
I just wish scratchmarks and sounds actually functioned in the temple proper.
---
Did she dc?
---
Oh okay thanks!
---
It would be cool if they added the mines as part of the MacMillan Estate realm. It was a big part of their business, after all.
---
Booty shorts for huntress when
---
Also something about nurse players and just either playing like gods or being complete potatoes you just feel like you're bullying
---
I am not trying to be rude but..why does it matter? They left and you won. You brought the add-ons to win and that is what happened. Also, there is a penalty for disconnecting. Pretty sure you lose pips.   
---
I think what you mean is that you want a larger penalty than what is currently enforced and I don't see what that could be, day-long ban? Loss of actual bloodpoints?
---
And when the legion came out it made BT not count down while in a chase.
---
That should be interesting to see if true. 
---
I mean why are people going to play something they have practically 0 chance at winning? I would be wasting my time so that the killer can assert their dominance over me and their ego stays intact in a video game that I paid for just to have fun.
---
Yeah, I think it was supposed to be the other way around
---
Considering that it's more of a benefit than a punishment i could argue that killers and survivors could be punished much more effectively
---
Makes sense
---
Would do this too but I have a flashlight macro on mouse 3 and struggle/wiggle macros on mouse 4 and 5.
---
Killer can literally go anywhere, way easier to search and can also find the survivor too. Killer will easily win more often.
---
You're just moaning for the sake of it now.
---
Thank you for providing the facts against this ridiculous OP. 
---
Not to mention that within the context of the game, mismatched locations make perfect sense. The Entity recreates locales using the memories of the killers and survivors however it doesn't understand the true nature of our world so it makes errors.
---
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN AWHILE AND ALSO WAS NEVER REALLY GOOD AS A SURVIVOR MAIN. HOVERED AROUND THE LEVEL 12 MARK. NOW LEVEL 15 AND PLAYING WITH NEW PEOPLE TO THE GAME WHICH IS GREAT WELCOME. WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF IS CLEARLY EVERY GAME IS A DERANKED KILLER MAIN WHO HAS TOP PERKS TOP LOADOUTS AND JUST SHITS ON ALL MY TEAM MATES WHO HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT BBQ AND CHILLI OR NURSES CALLING OR THANT OR ANY OTHER KILLER PERKS AND THEN IM SOLO WITH 4 GENS AND DE PIPPING CAUSE KILLER GOT BORED WITH HIGH LEVEL SURVIVORS. PLAY AT YOUR LEVEL OR DONT PLAY AT ALL
---
The Devs have said the players in game are not teammates or friends, they are just 4 people who are in the trial together trying to escape. They wouldn't sacrifice themselves for the others. That's why there's no in game communication.
---
As for the sacrifice counting as the kill, if it didn't then you have scenarios where there's a couple survivors left. The killer is hunting them and guarding the gates well, so they just hide for the 3 minutes so the killer doesn't get the sacrifice since they feel they cannot escape.
---
Lmfao. That hook timer's a whole 15 seconds in, that's waaay too late to be eyeballing scratch marks!
---
smh survivor mains.
---
That would imply the Killer hooked someone. Meaning the survivor decided to take a risk and go back for their teammate. If they can‚Äôt get out in the remaining time, that means that risk failed and they made a mistake. Also implied, the Killer managed to stall you out while the timer ran down. The Killer took advantage of the survivor‚Äôs mistake: he earned those points. 
---
The rules are very clearly defined. You have three minutes to leave once an exit door is opened. The timer stopped while a survivor is incapacitated, granting even more time. That‚Äôs a very generous time limit to just cross a line. There are very few contexts in which the Killer was not responsible for your failure to cross that line.
---
Goodness survivor, you huge
---
I gotta agree with you OP, it‚Äôs annoying that survivors do this and it‚Äôs not your fault. I‚Äôve stayed in a game for about 5 extra minutes just because I didn‚Äôt want to give into their toxic behavior.
---
Frenzy is literally their main move, remove that and Legion becomes a joke
---
Increasing stair width would be the best solution
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
I get it, but the community wants more variations of the same maps (I love red forest and it sucked never getting to play on it unless you have an offering because there was only one variation) but when a new killer comes out and the devs give us a different variation of an existing realm, then people complain about that too. I feel like the community and the game can't win, whatever they do is wrong. IMO i wish they'd just get rid of some of the autohaven/coldwind/macmillan maps. so theres like 2 maybe 3 variations.
---
I've always felt like there should be two entrances to the basement. 
---
One being the normal steps like in the Hut ect.. and another being a secret entrance like a long tunnel the Survivors can unlock n open. You could even make the tunnel spooky with hooks.
---
That would remove the ability to block the stairs anymore and add a little something extra.
---
I hate when killers use the excuse of "We are killers, we are supposed to kill you". We are survivors, we are supposed to survive. Allow me to make a list of why this post is fucking dumb
---
1. You are complaining that the survivors are doing there objectives, thats like survivors complaining about a killer using there ability 
---
2.If you get body blocked then most of the time its you're own fault. there are so many hooks now survivors almost never wiggle out without the killer being dumb
---
3. Im not for tbagging at gate (Unless the killer was a real dick head) But Im not on reddit complaining about Killers head banging or Hitting me on hook am i?
---
4. Fuck anyone who is toxic in after game chat for no reason.
---
5. Killers are the best they have ever been. You get destroyed by SWF bc most good survivors understand that the game is fucking horrible playing without a 3 or 4 man Q.
---
To finish up. Yes i understand the game is annoying, There are mechanics that make you want to pull you're hair out. Perhaps you should go play some Civ 5 :)
---
Currently you don't lose pips for d/cing. If you dc, you will get the pips back the next time you start the game, or the next match you complete.
---
It sucks when that happens, but it sucks even more when your whole team ditches you and forces you to face that alone
---
So that you can be bodyblocked.
---
the basement duhh
---
Looks like the only thing that actually matters is the fact that the killer can now close the hatch.
---
Not to be overly negative here but this changes nothing unless the survivors are trying to teabag at the gates for longer then 3 minutes.
---
Wraiths. Such assholes blocking the windows and pallets.
---
Being ruinless isn't the problem.
---
The pip-system being god awful is. 
---
There is no objective reasoning for it to be a double-pip, it should instead just be from a 4k. Survivors can depip and get their adept (iirc it was possible to escape from a gate and depip these days?)   
---
so yeah adepts are dumb af now.
---
I got the coolest team yesterday, the killer had noed and put me in the basement, they got me and one of them went down because of it. She got hooked next to an exit gate and I got her and 3 of us got out. Some players are nice and will help others no matter the circumstances.
---
Yah somewhere else in the thread I mentioned what I did, I had kicked a gen and ran around chasing his scratch marks before finally coming across him. I didn‚Äôt start the clip until right when I heard him.
---
Tunneling is a tactic, and everytime i see it brought up that its unfair or unfun I die a little more inside, SOMETIMES its the best thing to do, obviously chasing the same dude all game while gens are going down isn't that time. Ignoring a survivor just because you don't want to be a tunneller is stupid- sometimes you need to force a kill or a struggle to get pressure on the map.
---
Nobody
---
But that didn't happen. His base dream transition time has always been seven seconds. What are you referring to?
---
Why waste a perk slot over flashlights? Flashlights suck shit. Toolboxes, instaheals, and keys are the good items.
---
Yeah and if the killer can keep you more than 3 minutes in the trial after the gates are opened he should be rewarded. If he doesn't get his points we're gonna see whole lotta p3 claudettes crouching around the map once the endgame starts.
---
But... if it opens the gates... then all you have to as a survivor is hide around an exit gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch and you can run out, no? 99% of the time he won't be there in time to catch you.
---
We will never have a killer that disguises himself as a survivor as it would be impossible to balance against SWF. It will never happen and we just have to swallow that and move on.
---
Being a nea main, I'd gas all the nea's. We have killed enough killers and they deserve a chance.
---
I‚Äôm so sick of the negativity and toxicity on this sub, finally something good.
---
Nea
---
"Cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you, you fucking f**got?"
---
say what you will about raimi but you gotta admit it was ballsy to put this in a PG-13 movie on top of ending the film with a tirade about 9/11 being a jewish conspiracy. it's crazy what he could get away with back then
---
I played killer once and a Nea farmed a survivor the second I hooked him. I felt bad for the guy so what I did was tunnel the Nea to death. It wasn‚Äôt hard to kill her since the others farmed her after she did. I was going to let the first guy escape but they had only gotten 4 gens and no one was doing them so I killed everyone.
---
I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art! Thank you!
---
It's true, you still have the problem with toolboxes. If you have extra mouse buttons you could use those, but I find myself repairing without a toolbox 9 times out of 10.
---
I personally dont see anything wrong with people dc'ing out of a match. DBD is supposed to be a fun experience for everyone,killer and survivor alike. If youre not having fun then I don't really have a problem with you dc'ing,even if were both survivors.
---
It is after all a game my friends,games are supposed to be enjoyable,dont take them too seriously!
---
i used ruin for the first time yesterday, they literally found the totem right at the start
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going by the person who was playing the game and recorded the video says.‚Äù FTFY
---
in every 5 matches, I see this kind of stuff happen.  i only do this when i face a legion who  .. abuse the time mech
---
I generally don't ditch... but if there's a squadette I might decide that I'd rather get a drink and screw around on my phone a bit
---
Good stuff!
---
Nice art style as well
---
He t-bagged then proceeded to be the worst survivor in history.
---
Thanks my friend!
---
I'd take 4 flashlights in a lobby any day. Favorite items to see coming in.  
---
1) means the SWF are going to be hella altruistic
---
2) I main hag. They ALWAYS come back for the flashlight when you franks it out of their dirty hands. Trap that thing and get an easy kill.
---
Wraith can make plays to block windows and the like while cloaked, also allows misplay punishes if you run into a dead end or the like or loop a pallet wrong.
---
I get so excited Everytime I see another one of your DBD comics! Definitely one of the best parts of this Sub :)
---
No problem, please make more üôÇ
---
They should change legions name to BatGang
---
If that happens a lot they could just make Endgame Timer freeze while in Basement.
---
Anybody who tries to be cheeky with pallets against a Huntress deserves whatever they get anyway. Any kind of animation lock against a competent Huntress is a free hatchet.
---
I thicken when I play hag also. Shes short and hard to see and plus hides her trap markings.
---
Body blocking to secure kills isn‚Äôt bannable, holding the game hostage is.
---
Doesn't help that you had 4 completely useless perks
---
But the slightly lessening the mist is a pointless offering.. nobody actually uses that.
---
The game is already struggling and needs something BIG to help it.
---
This is just a fancy timer.
---
Here's what it fixes:
---
- Hatch standoffs*
---
- Survivors refusing to leave
---
Here's what it doesn't fix:
---
- Suiciding-on-hook to give someone the hatch.
---
- Keys
---
- Survivors t-bagging at the exit
---
- *Hatch standoffs. They just turn into door standoffs now.
---
- Doors being way too easy to open.
---
- Slugging to deny the hatch
---
- Survivors camping the hatch and refusing to save you.
---
Here's what it makes worse:
---
- Getting 3 kills before 2 gens are fixed (very difficult) is no longer rewarded.
---
- Tracking at endgame (red stuff all over the ground)
---
- People abandonning you on the hook at endgame
---
- Pig
---
- All endgame perks/builds
---
I definitely agree that the temple of purgation map is way out of place in the red forest realm.
---
You‚Äôre gonna get the killers attention the whole time you‚Äôre on a hook.
---
Your red stain will still be visible tho
---
Which is what type of build? 
---
Bbq, nurses, ruin? And ?
---
Im pretty sure this is the new wraith endgame.
---
Knock someone down.
---
Open the gates.
---
Hook them in the basement.
---
Wait for 1-3 survivors to enter basement. 
---
Block stairs up for 3 minutes.
---
Nope,in my opinion nothing will ever completely stop dc'ers.
---
I fail to see how this is a buff unless killers would moonwalk to exploit the borrowed time, much like the legion moonwalking technique. Am I missing something?
---
You‚Äôre right however I want killers to know that they are as childish as thoses survivors DCing in game.
---
Not OP, and usually I don‚Äôt care if people dc, but I‚Äôve been trying to get quite a few adept achievements and every time I am winning a game and getting close to the double pip someone dcs and effectively makes it impossible for me to double pip.
---
I had it happen probably 5+ times last night alone.
---
I don‚Äôt super care about the achievements, but if I did I would have ended up rage quitting pretty early into my session.
---
Never hex perks, tyvm =P
---
Surveillance, Stridor, Mon. &amp; Ab., and either Nurses Calling or BBQ.
---
Swing perk depends if I want points and fun or if I'm working through something ;)
---
End game perks are getting looked at but i dont think they are changing all of them. RM is more Endgame but Pre-Collapse based perk. End Game Freddy with No-Ed and Remember Me would rely on winning before The Collapse timer starts
---
‚Äúcompetent huntress‚Äù
---
*M1‚Äôs twice in one clip*
---
Haha...ya...competent.
---
Side note, is that my girl valentina?
---
I wasn't talking about the clip. I was speaking generally.
---
It‚Äôs bannable to hold the game hostage, but when there‚Äôs a timer it‚Äôs securing a kill more than waiting 40 minutes for them to DC. Something akin to facecamping but not quite
---
Then spirit pulls you off cause you aren't focused xD
---
I was using paint lol
---
Doesn't matter, it'll be ignored.
---
Using A to drop a pallet eh? Interesting...
---
I played with a friend yesterday that kept just getting booted from the game. We'd load in and insta dc, hes like oh killer dc'd I'm like nope you did. Hed get so mad. Or hed be in the game for a couple of minutes then bam he get booted from the game. This happen every match we tried to play together. It was bad. He got frustrated and turned his ps4 off lol.  
---
IF YOU HEAR THE DC NOISE THAT MEANS THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE. IF YOU DONT HEAR A NOISE AND THEY DISAPPEAR DC, THAT MEANS THE GAME KICKED THEM. DBD IS BROKEN
---
All killers come in two‚Äôs in term of power similarities.
---
‚Ä¢Hillbilly and Leatherface both have chainsaws.
---
‚Ä¢Hag and Nurse are both teleporting killers.
---
‚Ä¢Freddy and Wraith are both invisible killers (to an extent).
---
‚Ä¢Trapper and Pig both have traps.
---
‚Ä¢Spirit and Legion both have speed boosts at limited tracking capabilities (Spirit doesn‚Äôt see the person or blood, Legion doesn‚Äôt see scratches or blood).
---
‚Ä¢Clown and Huntress are both ranged killers.
---
‚Ä¢Doctor and Myers both have 3 tiers of their power, Doctor affecting survivors and Myers being self inflicted.
---
‚Ä¢The plague is tall.
---
I'm on ps4 ! I play majority of swf! My gamertag is the same as my reddit.
---
That‚Äôs all it‚Äôs meant for really, stop stop hatch camping and to stop survivors holding the game hostage.
---
"stop adding new content and fix balance and bugs!!!!"
---
bhvr: okay \*reuses assets for a map to save time and to work on other stuff\*
---
"wtf? bhvr is so goddamn lazy, like holy shit"
---
"Oh no, the killer is using a powerful combo, time to DC!"
---
I almost agree, but the thing is, the game has already started when survivors do it.
---
I prefer if neither dodge
---
To make it less confusing for noobies I suppose, ‚Äúoh all the gems are blocked, maybe I have to escape now‚Äù
---
Telling people how to live is mental illness, my guy. Get a life.
---
You do know they can tell if you manually DC or if there is an error that caused the disconnection.
---
So that's where they implement it....... Moron
---
You do not know how hyped I‚Äôd be if the giant spider demon I worship is also a girl.
---
~~This is a joke, maybe~~
---
Nobody said anything about warranting anything. You sound salty and vindictive.
---
No :(
---
They did in fact moonwalk (and still do) to make the BT bar go down. (At least at high ranks where they're familiar with the BT mechanics)
---
Or they just break chase for a while so you're forced to mend.
---
Can't.... leave.... must... *teabags at gate til entity kills them*
---
Liscensed killers go on sale from time to time. If you want to wait it out. Usually around holidays. I bought leatherface, pig and Micheal during the Halloween sale. Paid $13 for them all.
---
[deleted]
---
Because some killers on this subreddit admitted that wearing flashy clothes means "im not scared of you, chase me, im toxic" if you dont believe me i can dm you the link. 
---
Add to that killers who dodge legacy/prestige, killers who dodge claudettes wearing dark clothes, killers who dodge claudettes because "But dbd subreddit told me that all claudettes are toxic üò£" just read this comment section lol.
---
 Trust me, theres a shit ton of killers who will dodge you because they don't like what you're wearing.
---
They can't tell shit because people connect to each other and not any servers. They literally know nothing. 
---
Moron.
---
23rd of april
---
Just gonna leave this here:
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ ok know it all. They have even said they can see and tell if you manually disconnect. So until I see otherwise.....
---
Plus it was a suggestion dum dum.  Fo troll somewhere else
---
I think of it like how good Wraiths bodyblock to get a hit on survivors in corners when they don‚Äôt see you. I agree that making them wait a minute or two is being a dick but if there‚Äôs a cocky flashlight squad that won‚Äôt let me get a hook then yes I‚Äôm watching at least two of you die here
---
I'm not playing in low ranks though, but like rank 18 (due to not playing much, but my best was maybe 11, so...) - it's very doubtful that a P3 squad is properly matched at that level (the "even worse" instant readying just indicating SWF if all else wasn't enough). I don't *always* dodge prestige people (and do play survivor more than killer), but they are more likely to be out of league or toxic and at that moment, it was like... fuck this shit.
---
It's not a phase, Pablo!
---
This right here.
---
&gt;Wuba luba dub dub!
---
-Legion advocate
---
You deadass sound like youre whining. You got beat fair and square in this situation. If a killer is that much better then you, then they earned the 4k
---
Ah ok, that makes sense, thanks for letting me know
---
I wish people weren‚Äôt such cuntnuggets bc then all of ya‚Äôll change your privacy settings :( Then I can‚Äôt msg any of the survivors in my lobby to tell them they can farm- and they end up wasting offerings :(((
---
You said yourself that you cant save everyone.  Im saying fuck that why not try? If the killer didnt catch and hook them 3 times then they dont deserve the kill. So you should go back and try and get your teammate out.
---
Or if you have to scratch that itch
---
Yesterday a killer was chasing a survivor, but the survivor kept managing to avoid any hits, meanwhile me and the other 2 survivors are all on individual gens, we complete them all within 5 seconds of each other, and the killer DCs lol. 
---
I guess it was a gen rush, but it was clearly unintentional. Sorry Bubba
---
Why? I haven't read his lore.
---
Awwww
---
What exactly is the benefit of getting so many minus points that you're definitely unable to get a pip? Are you drunk?
---
How will you punish killer more if they camp? Without introducing voodoo magic gameplay bullshit like you can't hit someone anymore for a few seconds after so and so much camping? Sometimes you have to defend your hook, sometimes it's even smart to not go away and sometimes you want to go away but right at the second you see someone 10 foot besides him already waiting so that you have to come back (which makes it looks like camping then). There simply is no way to punish or restrict that gameplay wise without ruining something. It just has too many factors and what they did was giving you a shit ton of minus points to the emblem if you do, which is the right way and the only way without hurting the gameplay.
---
I mori‚Äôd all 4 survivors for the first time as Spirit yesterday, felt a m a z i n g
---
Didn‚Äôt even get one hate message üòä
---
That‚Äôs dumb
---
This is why I don't like seing a claudette in my lobby. They usually have mettle of man, taking the obsession and I won't see them all game while I have remember me. This has happened way too often. Their whole team is on deathhook and I haven't even seen them
---
I especially like the first two perks, where the second discourages camping and the first would have an interesting interaction with rancor, would definitely run the two together they synergise in every way possible
---
The power I think is overpowered, just a better version of the Doctor‚Äôs power. Not beingg able to use objects during a chase for ten seconds, as a base power, is a little too much. Don‚Äôt know how to keep to a similar sort of power without making it overpowered or too similar to Herman‚Äôs power
---
Seriously though love the perks
---
I only play killer for dailies so I‚Äôm not very good. And on top of not being very good, I go out of my way to not camp or tunnel and I never intend to to kill anyone (although I do go hard on tea baggers). That said, I had six dc‚Äôs last night while I was trying to get my trapper daily- all four the first game and two the second. *sigh* Me and the two remaining Megs had a fun farmy time at the end though.
---
Im not on board with the out of league bs. Embrace a challange, you either win or you LEARN. At least thats my mindset, and got me pretty better in a fairly short amount of time. With that being said, ofc i dodge lobbies sometimes, just never based on any of those reasons
---
BW only kicks in once a door is opened.
---
What's this? Sorry I don't play killer much at all
---
Do you even need self care to heal yourself from it any more?
---
Then people shouldn't be whining when they sometimes fail and die when doing that.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs you, sometimes it aintü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why couldn't it have been a Claudette :(
---
This post and the comments are all gold, best thing I‚Äôve seen all day üòÇ
---
I do not share this sentiment at all, at least not for the Temple. The Temple has entirely new assets including an entirely new major structure with a lot of places to evade the Killer that aren't just brain-dead loops.
---
If you want a proper example of honestly lazy map design look at Father Cambel's Chapel, which only has the church and the carnival that you never go to. 85% of the time the map just feels like a smaller Crotus Pen.
---
And for 600 points lol
---
Apparently people from here don t know what a Omega Blink Nurse is. A Omega Blink Nurse is when you using the double add-ons which increases her blink range moderately and considerably ( Catatonic Boy s Treasure and Ataxic Respiration ). He used in that match Fragile Wheeze and Ataxic Respiration, so he practically used 3 blinks + range. But that is not Omega Blink, Omega Blink is again when you use her best range add-ons.
---
THE FUCKING PLAYSTATION SERVERS ARE DOWN AGAIN
---
Additionally, survivors can basically hide inside the terror radius no problem. Mending made a decent amount of noise, but you had to mend if you didn't want to go down. Now you can just stop mending if the killer comes closer so you don't make a lot of extra noise
---
El autismo award goes to...
---
Thanks for your feedback!
---
I was aware that this power or Revenge may be considered too powerful. Do you have an idea about how to balance it? I wouldn't mind drastically reduce this 10 seconds duration though, maybe exclude pallets/windows (or both of them)?
---
Holy shit pig is going to be powerful after endgame update
---
Ohh yea! that was also a buff it got.
---
NEVER MIND I JUST GOT IN
---
That there is a lot of dead rabbits.
---
I just wait at the gates if I have a teammate alive, it's better to waste time
---
She should she the boxes and have rule set no2 in her kit. It is far from OP and would make her traps less of a joke.
---
2.5min is already more than enough, make rule set no2. part of her kit and keep the time the same.
---
RM is getting reworked? I haven't heard anything about that.
---
Demon Knight, a classic.
---
He‚Äôs a pretty easy killer. You have to be careful how you use him. The counter to him is things he can smack on to. He‚Äôs balanced in the fact he had an instant down and can hit multiple people. With practice, he‚Äôs a decent killer. 
---
See you in the fog!
---
If killers have to double pip then so should survs.
---
Lol all free escape perks too.
---
I see Pig I give upvote.
---
I don‚Äôt feel like care about him at all.
---
I was also thinking of this
---
-happy oinks-
---
I mean yea, but its actually so fucking rare to see anything like that. and i mean, who actually plays freddy and takes the game seriously
---
He has an instadown but it gives him nothing to make him origional from hillbilly. The fact he can hit multiple people is negligable, it only comes into play in the basement and even then he needs to be playing very close attention.
---
Do people really see survivors tea bagging at the gate as a problem the game needs to fix? It‚Äôs juvenile but it really isn‚Äôt a gameplay problem.
---
Twice.
---
why do the perks matter
---
;)
---
I mean, he's no more innocent than a lot of the survivors, but he's just a chill dude who likes metal, art, and beer.
---
Damn, this is real and QUALITY memeage.
---
Of course it is, although I'm still going to get down voted for stating the obvious
---
W i c k e d 
---
I didn't get all of them myself, but I DID get a DC and a one-hook sacrifice, then the last person went through the hatch as I was grabbing more hatchets from a nearby locker, and Whispers never even went off ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø What can you do am I right
---
As she should be
---
I just bought the dlc last week :(
---
Let's stop for a moment and consider how absurd it is that Legion's power was to apply a buff to survivors. One that was always designed for survivors to apply to each other for assistance.
---
I've been calling the Entity "Spider Mom" for a long time now. Reason being is because I've always saw spider legs, and spider=black widow=female to me. And NOW people are suddenly like, SPOODER MUM! 
---
I was on that train long ago. D=
---
See, the first bit I‚Äôm fine with. The second bit, I can‚Äôt entirely agree with. If I didn‚Äôt check to see if someone was near by with a flashlight, or I didn‚Äôt pick someone up against a wall, I blame myself for letting someone flashlight save.
---
Then again I‚Äôm one of the survivors that enjoys being chased not because I want to be toxic, but because against certain players it can be really fun. I find more fun in playing the game than standing still doing nothing. Body blocking basement stairs, IMO, isn‚Äôt much better than camping.
---
Context: I've never touched the nurse before, as i couldn't understand those blinks.
---
Since there was a rank reset i picked her up again and started to train, after loosing a few more ranks i think i'm getting the hang of it.
---
I think those 4 claudettes tried to be toxic with their flashlight clicking but i cannot say for sure, i had a blast though.
---
I'm sorry, but that's not a legitimate reason to DC. Killers are allowed to try just as hard as survivors when playing this game.
---
If you're the Pig I could see this being a smart play.
---
In the case of the Huntress, well... Let's just say, I'm no mechanic.
---
suspicious
---
It works based on the newest release is last on the unowned list, and your most recently bought is last on the owned list. If this person bought Jane most recently and never bought someone before then, then this would be potentially real.
---
Plays survivor. Gets face camped. Gets saved. Gets tunneld. Gets face camped. Plays killer. Gets pallet looped. Gets flashlight. Gets gen rush.
---
HMMM
---
Yeah but like i said i try not to be toxic just give my team time to do gens or maybe get the chase off of another survivor
---
 I hope they all report you for holding game hostage
---
I think Leatherboy us a little bit underrated. When I play Leatherface I usually get a 4K without too much effort  I mean, he is not too strong but definitely not as weak as people say it is. Survivors at the end game chat keep saying "Oh you're shit, how could I lose to a Leatherboy" and the salt is satisfying.
---
Reminding it's my opinion, folks. No need for h8.
---
Has there been a straight drag queen on the show??
---
SO MUCH ANIME
---
Only thing I don‚Äôt like about Revenge is the quicker sacrifice time would make face camping a much more efficient tactic which isn‚Äôt nice for anyone. Any endgame perks pique my interest I would be lying if I said it doesn‚Äôt look cool
---
Considering that bamboozle blocks windows already with some foreplanning, and Doctor‚Äôs ability already stop pallet vaults, maybe the idea of the power could be revamped somehow but still keep the flavour of what you‚Äôre going for. No idea how though. Again, good job!
---
3 things buddy:
---
1) It isn't holding hostage
---
2) You need to calm down
---
3) It was a joke
---
Did you really think you were gonna get a ton of people voting seconds after you posted this? It's been up for one minute and you said we were too late lmao
---
I love Whispers, but yeah it seems like it doesn‚Äôt always work? I‚Äôm also still trying to figure out if it counts when I hear it near a hooked survivor, or if that means someone else is nearby
---
No one even knows the add-on changes yet
---
Yeah but t-bagging is just toxic, the flashlight thing doesn‚Äôt matter and can actually work because the killer just wants you to stop
---
Killers are op
---
Also they probably aren't im also testing
---
DCing is evidently a major issue when the majority of the comments here are arguing an exception can be made due to your Nurse build... the only 'real' counterargument made is that Killers are dodging in the lobby when they see certain survivors/items, but I'd take that a hundred times over than my game being ruined over some player who doesn't feel like playing against a non M1-Killer.
---
Remember Me and Left Behind are the only ones the Devs said are getting "reworked". Expect nothing, hope for the best when it comes to that reworked word.
---
Lol sure kid.
---
And it is an opinion.
---
If you think this actually this is actually a buff for killers. Then you clearly don't have any foresight. Your not going to convince me of anything.
---
Your tone and diction give off the vibe you ain't a killer. And please dont respond. I dont care about you or your bad opinion.
---
Fuck off ive got other shit to do then trying to get survivors to quit bitching for once
---
Nah, that's dumb. The killer already has an advantage in finding the hatch, being faster and not having to worry about hiding. A survivor could outplay the killer all game and then get screwed by RNG. They just need to fix the gate spawns.
---
I missed mine and it didn't disable it.
---
I love the salt. It's a quarter of the reason I play killer.
---
So far it seems like 56% of the community is not so bad, the other 44% seems to be in a haste.
---
Wait for the adapt you only have to sacrafice all 4 ! or mori them :/
---
I haven't watched them all so idk but I vaguely remmeber someone saying that they werent all gay
---
iTS jusT A pRAnk brO
---
Change the ‚Äúyou‚Äù to ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù and I agree with you. 
---
It‚Äôs either a campy killer or survivor being chased unhooking you.
---
I have no idea, she has 3 things that are "broken" about her and they nerf her.
---
Also those 3 things are:
---
1) No Rule Set No2. in her base kit
---
2) Some really shit addons
---
3) No permenant(if this is how you spell it) OINKING
---
I still have a lot of questions
---
I just wish they did a map that had actual hills and slopes. Not just flat ground with one or two mounds of land.
---
I think with the timer it's not against the rules anymore. Scummy, but not bannable. Body blocking is not an offence (as the developers have stated multiple times), it's taking the game hostage which is against the rules. With a timer until death that doesn't apply anymore because the game is proceeding toward an end and not stuck indefinitely until someone dcs as it is with current corner/basement body blocking.
---
Foggys (Fog Whispers) already told me that this issue gets worked on and will end completely with the server implementation.
---
So Legion got built-in Whispers? Nice.
---
Thanks! My point of Revenge is to apply constant pressure on Survivors to rescue their teammates, slowing down their objectives. I swear I didn't consider it'd improve camping. But my main question is: isn't the End-game Collapse time reduction too powerful, even though it comes under very strict circumstances?
---
About the power: I've been thinking what about if it didn't affect vaults and pallets at all, but generators, chests etc. and for longer time. It'd be better for the game since it wouldn't cut chase time in half and make him objective-focused instead; my another question is if this rework had to be implemented, should it block Totems also?
---
That's great but I'm not gonna wait months for it to be fixed. I'll just play a different game as MCote suggested!
---
If they close the hatch the gates get powered.
---
See, this is your problem, if you would just loop for a full 5 gens you would live, nothing the killer does here is unfair, it all comes down to you.
---
For those who need to hear it: I am joking.
---
Just know if ur on ps4 we waited 15 mins for that game
---
I only have 1 question...
---
Why?
---
99% exit gates :/
---
lmao it‚Äôs always me fym
---
Has there even been a leak yet? This is going to shit, people! We need this!
---
The old borrowed time timer would go down even if you're in a chase +you needed self care to not go down.
---
The new borrowed time (deep wound) can be healed without self care (mend) and the timer does not go down in a chase. You could avoid this by moonwalking but with the upcoming patch you can't do that since if you are in the killers terror radius, the timer pauses.
---
Big thonk
---
Ghostface is a Myers lite slasher. Preying, stalking, being obsessed with killing one particular person, seemingly appearing out of and disappearing into nowhere. Finding out who the killer is is a plot point in the movies, but Ghostface itself does not really work toward creating this sense of being suspicious of everyone, so I don't think it would be essential for the killer (and not feasible anyway, given Survive With Friends).
---
A phone ability could be worthwhile. Every survivor gets a phone and Ghostface can issue calls, alerting them to all survivor positions within a certain range via an audio-visual cue. These calls can only be made in a "stalking" stance, similar to Pig's ambush stance, which would see their terror radius be reduced to 0, and put them in a low-profile, crouched position, moving at a slower speed. In the stalking stance, Ghostface is able to see locker auras, enter lockers, and then teleport to any locker on the map from there (looking at a particular locker would highlight it in white, like Phantasm traps). This ability would be on a cooldown, maybe 1 minute. Ghostface can either exit the locker slowly, staying in stalking stance, or quickly, immediately transitioning into the regular stance. In regular stance, Ghostface is a normal 4.4m/s 24m terror radius killer, but for a certain time after transitioning into regular stance, they would move at 5m/s, with their lunge range increased according to this movement speed. The duration of this post-transition speed boost should scale to how long they've been in the stalking stance for, prior to transitioning, maybe in a 1:2 ratio (every 1 second spent in stalking stance translates into 2 seconds of post-transition speed boost). Bloodlust does not stack with this speed. Ghostface can transition stances at any time, and their terror radius disappears/reappears immediately upon transitioning. Transitioning stances resets the post-transition speed boost timer. Stunning Ghostface with a pallet ends the speed boost. Add-ons could do stuff like reduce the cooldown on locker teleports, increase the calling range, decrease the time it takes to transition stances, grant a temporary extra speed boost when quickly exiting lockers, there could be an Iridescent add-on that makes survivors that get phoned suffer from the Exposed status effect for some time, and so on. Ghostface would definitely have an Obsession perk, which should make it so being close to the Obsession comes at a detriment to other survivors. Maybe the auras of both the Obsession and any other survivors within an 8m radius proximity to them get revealed to you, but only if there are any other survivors within that proximity of the Obsession. Whenever and for as long the perk is active (another survivor is within 8m of the Obsession), the killer would also get a Fire Up-like action speed buff of 30%. I've wanted an Obsession perk that lets you somewhat-reliably locate the Obsession for a while now. Sidney would obviously also have an Obsession perk, and specifically one that enables you to end your chases with the killer (and could preferably not be abused to merely prolong them). Maybe something like if you've been in a chase for 30 seconds without getting hit, you stop leaving scratchmarks, are immune to all aura-reading abilities of the killer, and can see the killer's aura, for the next 30 seconds.
---
These are some on-the-fly ideas I've just developed while typing, so it's not a fully worked-out concept by any stretch. Sounds like it could be fun yet viable enough anyway, to me. The killer has tracking, map mobility and chase strength, can use the ability both to try and get more surprise-like attacks or increase their chances to be successful in a standard chase scenario (even transitioning stances mid-chase either to charge up the movement speed boost or to try and trick the survivor with the disappearing terror radius, as well as potentially using the locker teleport to cut them off or close distances).
---
why did they have to needed legion
---
I know I was making fun of myself haha
---
Being on a hook slows down those 3 min by ... alot. 
---
If everyone plays normally, there will be barely any changes. It‚Äôs for those toxic ones that hide near the hatch at the end of the game untill everyone leaves or tbag at the exit gate.
---
That suggestion is over a year old ! XD ... it became invalid ! Play for fun, not for frust ! Thats all, have a good one in the fog !
---
And at that point we‚Äôll make it is no longer active
---
He's easier to play than billy though. All you have to do is get in lunge range and then rev your chainsaw. The speed boost from the chainsaw sprint makes up for the slowdown during reving, and then some.
---
With billy you'll at least have to juggle the rev bar until it's a good point to release it, and even then if you move your mouse just a tiny bit you'll flick away.
---
I hope not, whatever Pig needs, it's definitely not nerfs
---
So, the buff is that the killers can no longer cheat the system? That's not a buff imo, that's fixing an exploit. To each their own, though.
---
Ye - that second part I knew :D
---
Eh, makes us feel better. In a game where literally someone has the power to hook you and eventually kill you, you would think teabagging the air wouldnt be as frowned upon as it is. I mean, there's not many ways to express the happiness we get from escaping. Plus mocking is fun in any game
---
Wish you could remap on console. The layout is frustrating, especially the spin to wiggle free. Good way to mess up your joystick.
---
With billy due to there being no slow you can fake the chainsaw to scare the surv from dropping. Leatherface cant do that.
---
Why did you come to this subreddit to state that the game is aids and expect us to help you
---
No, the buff is there wasn't a "cheat" to begin with. The timer would go down no matter what, and you needed self care to survive but you no longer do.
---
Like you said though, to each their own.
---
I do agree that Huntress is quite thicc and fit (lowkey has the best killer body in game)
---
But she‚Äôs a better killer than the Clown, she can injure survivors from afar, can counter most loops, and can end chases pretty fast. Giving her 115% speed would make her too powerful.

---
Hallo what about "They are biased towards Suvivors" Do you not  get? Pleasing 4 crybabys is better than pleasing 1 killer !
---
You can get all general perks and neas perks. You cant get the other survivors perks unless you get them to level 40.
---
I wouldnt prestige its not worth it honestly,  if you are going to id save bloodpoints first
---
They're both scum.  The survivor for selling you out to the killer and cooping with him and the killer for having zero integrity by working with the survivor to use the info provided to kill you.  Any self respecting killer would have ignored the locker and killed the troll.  Hope you reported them both for survivor killer coop.
---
&gt; The Killer does not see the Deep Wound timer progress‚Äìonly the Deep Wound bar to know that Deep Wound has been applied. 
---
Not really.
---
Haha yeah I believe you, it‚Äôs intention was to get those survivors off the damn gens and help teammates (Hopefully no bum rushing hooks though) 
---
Perhaps if the increase only triggered when a certain distance from the hook, like Make Your Choice and Devour Hope? That would actively encourage going out to patrol gens and apply further pressure still
---
This is just begging for karma in disguise -.-
---
That‚Äôs a lot of what if‚Äôs
---
Yeah but that change happened months ago when legion was released. this post is saying that the newest legion changes buffed borrowed time, when the only thing that really changed is that the moonwalk exploit will no longer work.
---
Would prefer it if they changed the sacrifice animation to the entity ripping the survivor off the hook and pulling them underground
---
I agree with you entirely, just saying I‚Äôm likely going to enjoy being spiteful against people who genuinely deserve to be sacrificed. I do hope the devs do something to prevent this sort of thing though it feels cheap
---
I would say it is harder to 4k as legion, but legion automatically wins every chase that they are in assuming the Killer is not a potato. The fact that his power takes no skill and guarantees that you will win the chase is just stupid. Nurse definitely takes skill, though she is overpowered.
---
Im not I specifically said you've most likely black pipped or pipped if the doors are open so why not try.  Escaping likely wont be a double pip so you get the same outcome by trying to save them and if you succeed the killer doesnt get an undeserved kill. Likewise when I play killer I want them to try because sometimes you get them to fuck up and end up with a 3k
---
Disingenuous as fuck to compare an in game DC to a lobby dodge.
---
you only get the "pulsing" tracking after you hit one person though. Unless they are changing the way it works, it still won't really help. Unless they are increasing the Frenzy duration to be like 3x longer, having knowledge that there are survivors on the other side of the map won't really help too much either.
---
If you're referring to the change they're saying will happen to the button, I'm sure they are talking about breaking pallets while vaulting, previously you had to hit someone in frenzy before you can vault break a pallet, now you can just activate frenzy and immediately break the pallet instead.
---
Legion's tracking actually seems like it will be overall awful, you can't see blood or scratches in frenzy and only see people you haven't hit yet as well, nor can you down people in frenzy or harm them more than the initial hit, at best frenzy will just allow you to just get to the next survivor after only injuring the previous ones and then regularly chase them to try and down them.
---
The crashes are annoying, and it's obviously something they are having trouble fixing (maybe dedicated servers will help), but there's no excuse for lack of punishment for rage quitting. Anyone who rage quits should not be able to earn blood points in their next game.
---
flashlight/clicking =/= toxicity in my opinion. 
---
unless paired with t-bagging and spam fast vaulting across the map. 
---
idk i think these guys just wanted to have fun and play a game y‚Äôknow.
---
Sounds great! I'll apply a condition to be at least 24 metres away to get the faster Entity progression on Survivors. Haha, let's create an anti-camp loadout!
---
Sitting at the top of the basement stairs and forcing survivors to die to the new mechanic or DC is, IMO, holding the game hostage. I understand there is a timer now, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay with the devs.
---
Which is specifically why I said I would like clarification. I would like to see a dev comment and say ‚ÄúYes/No, this is/is not a bannable offense.‚Äù If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just scummy. If it is, you bet I‚Äôm reporting the killers that do it. With the new timer mechanic, it can potentially change the way that ‚Äútaking the game hostage‚Äù is defined.
---
GG
---
Is there a reason he did this? Because if you weren‚Äôt doing anything except for hiding the entire game then it is justified.
---
I would play so much more if lobbies we're actually like this for me
---
Nice try, the trapper would guess what TRAP one of both and go to the other to camp, also the hag, next time use hillbilly :D , but nice try get my upvote!
---
Nowhere in this post does he specify that he is talking about the new changes. But if he is then yeah they just fixed an exploit.
---
"HUMANS... You're not worth the flesh you're printed on..."
---
Except the killer can no longer see the deep wound timer, so no.
---
Chapter 12 - the big LEEK
---
Killer is a large vegetal. 
---
Survivor is a chicken tender.
---
I downloaded it and my PC exploded. I am posting this from my microwave.
---
Holy shit a mansion map would be amazing. Something like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lucius/images/f/f7/Dante_Manor_ground_level.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121026174316) would be so fun.
---
Shhhhh, let me get that karma.
---
But he's saying that the killer will try to wait him out, jus like in a hatch standoff
---
I saw someone else saying wider basement steps - I‚Äôm all for it, personally,  but idk how much of a pain it would be for the devs to redo all the maps to allow for that.
---
I also don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre allowed to edit licensed DLC maps for that :| If they‚Äôre not, then we probably won‚Äôt get that change.
---
If they made it "survivors can escape with traps on" that just kills the Pig off almost as hard as they just killed Legion which I would HATE as a Pig player.
---
My hope is that they mean it'll be "traps become active when only 1 survivor remains."
---
Scare the crap out of them when they assume you‚Äôre just another camping Wraith/Bubba/insert stereotype here, but then it dawns on them that you get so much power from keeping away from your hooks and doing other objective. Forget even going near hooks xD 
---
Would be great on killers such as Wraith or Spirit too, who lack map pressure
---
I MOST CERTAINLY DID!
---
*¬°Ol√©!*
---
Make you wanna bridge a gap for sure
---
I hope you are right. If they toutch my OinkGoddess I will be sad.
---
What is the issue with Hillbilly?
---
Yeah if they‚Äôre removing the survivors‚Äô ability to hold the game hostage it‚Äôs logical to stop killers from doing so too. The basement is supposed to be the most dangerous part of the map but the BS some people can do with bodyblocking...
---
Bevahoir dosnt care , they ban you anyways, instead of disabling anything or release fixed fleshed out stuff.
---
omega blink nurse :/ cant blame them
---
Few and far between for me. Most of the time it's other survivors calling me a bitch for not taking a chance to save them when the killer is camping lol
---
the point of emblems and pip is to win without relying on easy "strat" like that.
---
This comment is so out of touch and overplayed. Multiple different teams focus on building the maps and tiles for new chapters than the ones focusing on mechanics, bugs, and balancing.
---
You admitting it even, wow  low life pathetic creature -.-,
---
I hope my dbd buddy watches Rick and morty haha I gotta show it to him
---
Don‚Äôt know why Rule Set No2 isn‚Äôt passive, it removes a lot of the Pig‚Äôs early game surprise, that Wraith gets
---
which sucks I personally don't think it's fair that the killer can very easily guarantee a kill for themselves now even countering literally any survivor perks they have; Mettle, DS, Borrowed, Dead Hard, We'll make it, Deliverance, insta heals, etc. no matter what you have all the killer has to do is body block for &lt; 3 minutes and not even make an effort to redown you guys and just let you die. Also giving them probably full sacrifice points which I also think isn't fair, since even lorewise the killer isn't exactly doing their job to kill the survivor themselves(basically equivalent to bleeding out) and the entity has to do the job for them.
---
I was clearly joking. Why else would I respond like that?
---
Accurate.
---
Was expecting to see a comment flame war when I saw the title. Was certainly not disappointed
---
I literally have just been doing gens and healing people, never hid the whole game until then because he body blocked me.
---
Could be left behind buff? Maybe
---
Well I had a teammate who literally was hiding all game in lockers (I saw how she was exiting one locker and then entering another with no sign of killer around her) and said "ez escape" after I called her BS so... :D
---
Lmao killers are just being torn apart by this game
---
They should make it back to being it‚Äôs WIP form.  It would work like so.
---
Last Standing
---
For every Survivor in the trial that has been killed, gain an x repair speed bonus.
---
I play solo almost all the time, and I think you are looking at it wrong, playing with friends is better as you can communicate with the people you are playing with, if there was game chat I don‚Äôt think that it would be too bad
---
well its good against every killer spine chill is basically the best killer detection perk counters every killer except tier one michael.
---
That's fair enough mate, I 100% get you, I'm just of the opinion that with the current rules it's not against them because the game doesn't force one side to end with a DC. Guess we'll have to see
---
I think it wouldn't be that big a problem if the maps weren't unbalanced as hell. The spirit's map itself is HELL for killers because of how much shrub there is to hide in.
---
Conversely, the game is hell for survivors because there is nothing to hide in.
---
If the maps were actually balanced, saving time on them by reusing assets would be fine
---
XBox has a similar issue, my son got DC'ed multiple times when we played a few nights ago.
---
I'd argue likewise Killers are not entitled to a kill. One survivor should not be at the complete mercy at the Killer if their team was not interested or was not supporting them.
---
If you want to make Solo Queue for Survivors impossible and unfun, then don't be surprised when the amount of coordinated SWFs increases.
---
yeah i have had that its funny when idiots complain about the saw
---
I seriously don't understand why people play this game if they're going to pussy out every time something inconveniences them. I get that people change want to have fun, but you can't control the variables in a competitive multiplayer game. It comes with the territory. Either play the game or play something else.
---
Thank you!
---
I would like the other way around. I am really worried about that lava effect. 
---
More on screen effects equal less FPS, specially if you are using a low-end rig and your hardware is already at max performance to deliver 60fps or even lower than that. 
---
When they added Clown and messed with DBD fog's to create Clown's power, DBD took a significant hit in performance. Even powerful high end rigs took a hit and people who used to play on ultra, had to lower their quality in some maps. 
---
Not to mention consoles...
---
Then he‚Äôs a meanie
---
I feel like that would defeat the entire purpose of the timer.
---
Or maybe people are reading it and downvoting you anyway because it‚Äôs a dumb click-bait post.
---
I could be completely wrong here but I have found that rotating the joysticks at a constant medium pace progresses the wiggle free bar at the same pace as cranking it like its a Mario Party mini game. Either way, you are right about it not being good for your sticks. Hopefully this saves a little more stick life for you.
---
For real though I am so stoked that Ash is in this game, what an absolute hoot! I love it :)
---
As far as I know, no. But you can look up Monto on youtube, as he does a lot of different perk/addon builds that can help show off some synergy between them.
---
But, No Mither/Self Care/Solidarity/Mettle of Man is a pretty solid one.
---
I read this as if Yoda said it.
---
I wonder if it also affects PC players then. Good to know it's not PS4 only at least !
---
I mean initially sure, but this is my favorite perk more and more lately. As long as it isn't scratched mirror Myers.
---
Prayer Beads Bracelet Spirit can suck my fat nut with spine chill though
---
Rule Set No.2 wouldn't change that lol, all it does is stop the auras appearing when you have an inactive trap on. People can still see the physical boxes
---
Evil Within 1, the trump card to every other trump card.
---
What did they change about her?
---
Wasnt omegablink tho...
---
You can remap (on Xbox at least) Just go to the controls in the options.
---
I love doing this!
---
Can't you practice that anyway?
---
I like all the Red Forest maps
---
Don‚Äôt think you understood my comment. Early game, when they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre Pig, you have a better time downing the first survivor. By seeing the boxes automatically any surprise is gone and they know to keep looking behind them
---
Hooked and downed Survivors both set off Whispers, yes. Which is why I'm glad I now have BBQ on Huntress lol; helps me figure out if there's anyone close by. And Whispers has never caused me any issues, so I don't know? I literally only saw them once the entire game and I lost them in a chase bc their scratch marks cut off in the middle of an open clearing maybe 10m from the corner I literally just rounded. And every time I went back to a gen I knew was being worked on there were never any scratch marks and Whispers was off. I feel like they probably had Spine Chill, Premonition, etc. to leave fast enough, but Distortion doesn't affect Whispers bc it doesn't reveal Auras so idk what happened.
---
I did not know that, thanks.
---
I don't know if that wouldn't be a bit too hard for "camping", but the game definitely needs something like this for lobby leaving or quitting. That would be perfect for it.
---
But you can't see the auras without a trap on anyway. I'm struggling to see how rule set no.2 being passive would change anything without traps on.
---
Ah, I see.
---
As far as I know Technician works, dunno tho because I don't ever run it.
---
Also head on has a pretty wonky "hitbox", you have to quick vault out of the locker when the killer is near it, and then it will hit no matter what. Meaning that the killer has to be infront of the locker to activate the perk, but it doesn't matter where they are after you quick vault out of the locker.
---
I think you're right, still doesn't stop me from going ham on my poor joystick though.
---
&gt; I always get nervous about going into the basement 
---
THIS is exactly why I think the game got the basement done good, there‚Äôs a genuine risk to unhooking even if the killer isn‚Äôt camping. High chance of running into him
---
And yes I‚Äôll be looking forward to seeing the changes implemented, this is the first time in too long I‚Äôve been somewhat hyped about a game update

People 99% doors to counter bloodwarden as it stands, if you have someone already downed and you open a door you can catch one or two survivors before they get out in some situations
---
Just had a trapper match and killed everyone. But I think the last person died in first hook. Brutal killer. No achievement.
---
And then he closes it, F
---
As a Claudette Main, I would honestly DC against myself.  People with your mentality are the same people who got Freddy and Legion nerfed because ‚Äúmummy he hurt my feewings‚Äù
---
Grow up, don‚Äôt disconnect because someone spent time on getting add ons to win.
---
To be fair, I find the Chapel map the laziest. The Temple of Purgation map has a lot of original assets. If it hadn't been set in the Red Forest, there'd been very little to complain about.
---
Ill only dodge you if 1 of yall got bad ping otherwise I gotchu fam.
---
He's pretty easy because his power is basically non-existent. He has 0 way to pressure any one else, 0 room for mindgames, 0 room to do anything if he isn't directly behind the survivor, even then if they are near something, odds are you are going to bump and put into a super long tantrum.
---
Leatherface's chainsaw is so clunky and hard to hit it might as well be useless, you can probably hit it 2~3 times in a game if you're lucky. Dare I even say he's worse than Freddy. 
---
Atleast Freddy has a chance to get a first hit off and then chase someone injured. He can also tag other survivors mid-chase allowing him to pressure them and slow their generator speed. Leatherface would have to entirely break chase, for a chance at doing something.
---
Leatherface has: 0 Map Pressure, 0 Mindgame potential, 0 First hit potential. But he has an insta-down so... automatic good killer?
---
TL;DR Leatherface is really bad because his power does diddly squat 99% of the time.
---
Haha! I cringe when my teammates crank it so hard, it sounds like they're trying to cram their controller through their headset.
---
Your comment is what I'd call pure degeneracy.
---
How does you being an asshole have anything to do with legion or Freddy? I'm assuming that was the point of your post, to show everyone you're asshole who doesn't know how to have a conversation.
---
Am I the only one who finds it hilarious when someone DC's when I'm killer? Free bloodpoints for me, and I either did a good enough job to the point that they rage quit, or they just outright didnt feel like being harassed by my killer. I think k that means I'm good at my job?
---
PC, bug. Stuck at rank no matter what I do even if I pip or depip it always resets to the same rank
---
For real easy 50% of my survivor games teammates leave for no reason or get salty and leave after 1 hook, there should be a 15 minute ban for leaving like rainbow six and overwatch.... At least a depip
---
It'd be still nice to see more than one character on any side (for example 2 killers) in a DLC!
---
hillbilly is so good you cant really blame em
---
Is that by intentional or just a symptom?
---
Not false fam, check out gameplay of people against pig. The white auras come up when a trap is placed on your noggin
---
Biggest issue is that he is more annoying to fight than any other licensed killer. It doesn't help he is exceptionally similar to Billy and can easily down two players with minimum effort which leads to the meme of him just facecamping all game. 
---
Any killer can get a 4K, it's just easier for some. LF does not get it easy unless people physically run at you stupidly. I've taken to just doing gens over unhooks against him because most will NEVER pressure gens with meat on the hook.
---
&gt;just start pressuring off of it if they get greedy.
---
I have gotten so many 4K's cause of survivor's greed, you would think they would leave the totems alone, but nope they go full sunken cost fallacy for totems rather than do gens lol.
---
I have 5k hours in the game.  I can‚Äôt play it anymore xD.  1.5 hours in the past two weeks.  
---
It was great while it lasted, but the spark is gone.
---
Click M1
---
[Sure thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE3ELI7cbWQ)
---
I can see it on the P3 clown. Scariest killer in the game. Legacy nurse is a close second.
---
How is it a challenge for Survivors to skip over every last skillcheck required to insta heal...?  Or to use Metal of Man, a perk that literally requires you suck at life to activate and got hit 3 times.  Or perks like Sprint Burst.  You press shift and pretty much end the chase.  Spent a lot of time getting those perks, right?  This Nurse did, too.
---
wait they DID change trapper achievement to merciless too? lol then its even worse than i thought. good thing i got THAT when you only had to unlock all 3 teachables
---
Oh God shut up you're not helping yourself
---
God tier post
---
Thank you xD
---
Dont play PC but cant it also mean a hacker?
---
Thank you sir.
---
I would agree with this, but as a killer main you eventually figure out what kind of players aren't worth going up against. I do my best to not dodge or anything, but I have a few exceptions, the main one being, as others have already said, 4xP3 Claudette with flashlights (because lets be honest most of us killers are still having PTSD from the old survivor meta of "be as cancerous as possible") or if at the last second people change into something else, often meaning they have something to hide in the first place. Not even SWF are worth dodging anymore
---
Well, Russian 'Entity' is female too. Entity Waifu confirmed
---
If it doesn't bother you, why leave after 5k? I think I had only 50h.
---
Bit of both. The only intention was realism I assume, but it just works in most cases to punish survivors hiding in corners against someone with a chainsaw, and a good Wraith can make window block plays. Though, for collapses and reverse bear trap timer, it really should be reviewed.
---
Isn't Mount Ormond a non-Red Forest one?
---
I understand that, we've all been there. But all it really does is annoy the killer and then they play even more toxic in the next game to feel better. That's why I'm glad it's gonna be over, he'll have just closed the hatch and your friend would've tried to get a door open.
---
my personal favorite add ons for myers are the add ons that increase how long tier 3 lasts and i love to throw an ivory mori and dyling light on my myers for a slugging build along with deer stalker
---
Once got 3 and the only non DC was a David running No Mither.  Let him repair gens and escape.
---
I think they all did? Had a brutal killer at the end and no achievement. No idea why I didn‚Äôt get this one sooner.
---
 worst fake leak I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Yeah agreed. It's a pain but from his side I think it was just out of principle lmao
---
The nerf needs to be done to hookcamping. Just subtract from the killers move and attack speed based on their proximity to the hook, this can be something the entity does to encourage the killer to go kill more.
---
the easy way to counter it is just get head phones so you can hear his breathing. and complete gens in open areas where you can see him easier
---
I‚Äôve played since Beta.  Not happy with where the game has gone.  Balance decisions plus a Lack of content (I don‚Äôt consider new killers or Survivors new content)
---
At the end of the day, it‚Äôs base mechanics have always been the same.
---
M1 simulator as Survivor.  Killers chasing, hooking and repeat.
---
It helped change my life, I moved to Europe because of DBD‚Äôs Help.  But all great things come to an end.
---
Lol he does. He can‚Äôt steer his chainsaw very well and turns into an M1 Killer at loops. He‚Äôs probably one of the most balanced Killers in the game.
---
Okay this comment is epic
---
Looping toxic. You should stand still and let me kill you
---
I have never had this happen on both my Xbox One S and X. I've played hours on a couple of my friends Xbox Ones and also never had this issue. Played plenty of Wraiths, Billy's and Spirits and they only disconnect when they're getting destroyed.
---
Seriously I fucking hate the rate people DC. I play survivor a lot with a buddy and we get screwed when 2 people DC or just die on hook like a bitch. I try to make it my purpose that when people DC in my game anyone who sticks around will at least get a chance to leave. (After proper farming) killers do the same for me and I don't want this game community to die
---
Fake
---
while i agree flashlights are toxic as hell, maybe they just learned to use them? or you were so good it made them look like bby survs
---
The interpretation of the ruling will probably go back to BHVR, if blocking people in basement until collapse becomes readily abused.
---
greatest thing i have seen all day
---
You can‚Äôt get grabbed jumping into the hatch anymore man.
---
You don't seem to know what Omega blink is, do you?
---
Well, if it happens before the collapse I would consider it holding game hostage but if it happens during the collapse I don't see any problem
---
If they are actively wasting good pallets it aint tunneling its just good business
---
gives you a reason to. without it you'll stop if you end up missing a few times, or if you end up blowing it up. with Ruin you kinda have no choice but to try, unless you want to waste everyone's time by looking for the hex
---
I really like this concept! I can imagine this being a chapter. With either Chris,Jill,or Leon as a survivor and the map at the Arklay Mountains or Racoon City
---
False. Hillbilly requires a decent amount of muscle memory and mechanical prowess to play. He's still susceptible to Pallets and his chainsaw is powerful but an absolute bitch to control. Good luck playing him on maps that have a lot of chokepoints--He'll be smacking into walls more than he'll be hitting you.
---
Don‚Äôt worry at least you‚Äôll get BBQ
---
Don't forget how indoor maps treat him.
---
*Taught 
---
Fair point though, especially with survivors. Even with the same perks the killers have different playstyles thoigh.
---
Give this guy a gold for his jokes LOL
---
There's a game in this bug!
---
This shirt explains why we need Jason in DBD
---
Pirouette, and S L I C E
---
True but new end game collapse might spice things up, they definitely need a few new game modes...
---
The devs should be balancing based on statistics and metrics with feedback in mind. It seems like they only balance when killer mains cry.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I wasn‚Äôt even looking for his hex, I was going for a save but I saw someone already there so I turned and there it was tucked into a corner.
---
I just got called toxic in a game for taking a hit for an injured teammate at exit gate, I'm beginning to wonder where toxic begins and ends tbh
---
The one on top is pretty much a hidden immunity idol
---
Would be an awesome licensed chapter! It'd open up some place for new Survivor perks as well
---
I may start playing Feng again after seeing those new cosmetics
---
Yeah but the game's in a delicate state of balance. If they mix it up as much as you want it to be they would probably fuck up what they've got going on here. At 5k hours you've just played all you can play. It's hard to blame the game for that. Anything would be old after that insane amount of time.
---
I hear ya, friend ;) Happy gaming, wherever you may be! I myself have been sucked into the black hole that is Apex Legends lately haha!
---
This is dope tho I feel Hanzo could potentially kill Sally and Herman
---
More like "oh no the killer is ignoring every chase mechanic the game can offer and should have never been a thing in the first place and is using strong add ons time to DC". Here fixed it for you.
---
Imagine trying to sneak as Pig and you just turn around to someone as Ash just staring deep into your soul. *We are the sinners, and he is the redeemer.*
---
It's ite, ultimately we all want the same thing anyway, rule no.2 being bloody passive
---
mouse4 skill check master race
---
Yeah from the last patches only Clown and Plague can be said that it was lazy work, and OP's talking like it's a trend when it's not.
---
Ha! That survivor was such a little bitch. This comes from a survivor main
---
How do you even have those things? I play both killer and survivor and have never seen any of those bugs.
---
I've recently posted about this issue as well, except I've been playing as survivor and on ps4. It was never a problem for me before, but today I've been kicked out of 3 matches out of 6. It was at the start of the game too.
---
I wonder if it's a console only issue ?
---
Non- toxic solo-queue survivors.  "Oh great, now I'm screwed over even more by the game."
---
Visual bug
---
You right, actually i curious if its bait or not, to post nurse and crying about dc's, its trolling, or op is really dumb fuck monkaHmm
---
What do you mean ? Nobody since Spirit didn't get a important buff. And that was some time ago.
---
Hey that's my favourite Ancestor line :D
---
shit sorry man.
---
I‚Äôm a P3 doctor with 1000+ hours and I‚Äôve been playing since Freddy update. I didn‚Äôt know this. Thank you.
---
As a survivor main, I'm excited for Endgame Collapse.
---
It doesn't change much at all except get rid of some toxicity and it's a solution to hatch standoffs. I also agree that the killer should be able to close hatch. It always feels so cheesy whenever I get hatch after only 2 gens are done. Plus this game needs some more challenge for survivors and surviving should be a rare occurance.

Chapter 12 - Entity Takes Manhattan
---
Nurse is a part of the game but so is dcing ;). Nurse can 4k naked.
---
Not the place to report it, and also naming and shaming, which isn't allowed
---
Lmao
---
Bring in Franklins Demise and an Eboni Mori.
---
Same here I have even more hours put I haven‚Äôt played in months
---
So they are giving killers a flashy way of quitting without losing blood points. That's cool.
---
My 5 year old sister started a game on my uncles ps4 one weekend bbq and handed me the control halfway through so i slaughtered the Survivors because Rank 20
---
I completely forgot about hate mail until that day.
---
What about when I join a game and I literally can't see anything because the textures are blindingly bright so I can only see my HUD, or when my skill checks don't appear on screen, or when the game is teleporting me across the map because of lag? I have to play it out?
---
I agree with what you are saying for a game like R6 where it almost always works and the bugs aren't game breaking, but roughly 1/3 of my games of dead by have some issue with them and I don't want to waste time, it already takes 30 mins to find a match so I'd rather find a working one
---
Developers said that they want to make a "logical" change for Pig when End Game Collapse will be added. So they might nerf Piggy because of this End Game Collapse. If they nerf Pig, I will be very upset.
---
Just make the stairs wider. Such an easy fix.
---
Isn‚Äôt this basically a survivor nerf? Killer will still camp a hooked survivor at the end and now survivors have a limit of 3 minutes to save them. Killer will still camp and it makes them camp even harder now.
---
Ruin, nurses calling, make your choice, sloppy butcher, discordance/surveillance, brutal strength, enduring, monitor and Abuse, spirit fury. 
---
Those are probably the more meta perks. I'm probably missing some.
---
Yes, this game is balanced for whiney killers.
---
i didnt want to sleep tonight
---
What it has to do with it as is the fact that I have no faith in BVHR to do what they're saying they're planning on doing until this game is almost 10 years old. 
---
They released Freddy, people bitched, and they dumpstered him. 3 years later and we're getting "Well, we're working on him, so.... maybe this year?" 
---
Now they've done the same with Legion. Of course, between Freddy's release and POSSIBLE REWORK this year, 2 years and several paid DLCs have passed, so am I to assume they aren't going to just do the same with Legion? I mean they already got everyone's money, AGAIN, so why would they prioritize actually fixing the killer when they can release another 3 DLCs people will pay for and let Legion remain the new joke of the community.
---
nea has a perk "appease the entity" where if ahe sandbags people in earlier gamrs she can just exit next game. /s
---
prob a bug, never saw this.
---
Might be worthless to you maybe but Bubba is god and if you don‚Äôt buy the chapter then it is you that is worthless
---
That would be so cool, but the lore says the trapper collapsed the mines. I doubt the entity would create a realm that looks like it undid a killer's act of brutality. That being said, I would love to have an undergoround map
---
Sprint away, then self heal not letting me heal them :/
---
*clap clap*
---
hex review
---
Thats really clever
---
bro if you keep posting stuff like this your gona run out of karma
---
The only time I dodge lobbies is when multiple survivors have red ping. They will glitch around the map, knowing their connection is ass and accuse you of lag switching at the end.
---
wish they did like rainbow and give them ban them for a certain time
---
I don't agree with your analogy but I understand what you are getting at so I'll play ball.
---
If the survivor is horrible that's not going to change the outcome, but for people that are good and use them, then I would pose the same question. Knowing your skill level is that high and using perks and add-ons that all but guarantee a win isn't even a challenge. 
---
That being said though, unless you play in an SWF you don't know the skill level of your teammates so you may bring in perks you need in order to cover your weaknesses as well as the teams weaknesses. If you are usually found first and tunnelled why wouldn't someone bring in Mettle of Man and an instaheal?  I don't run those but being on runs of being found first in a match multiple matches I've thought about it.
---
Also is Sprint burst still a thing? With the whole exhaustion fix I didn't realize it was that big of a hassle for a killer as long as they kept line of sight. I don't use it but I watch killers play against it very well in the few cases I see it ran.
---
f that gu

and then Adrenaline Procs
---
*BUT SO DOES NOED AND BITTER MURMUR*
---
Its a fairly standard Nurse, or even a killer build. I don't even see an issue tbh. When did they DC though? Probably some chickened out when they saw the Black Ward tbh and thinking you made some 5-blink madness.
---
if someone is looping the killer the whole game, or worse the killer has no ruin and the game is going to quick, I will get caught on purpose, and force hooks to happen. Its sad, but I do what I need to do to pip
---

---
If you're on PC you can open Task Manager to see if Dead by Daylight is 'Not Responding'. If it you're the problem and you should just close it.
---
If you're console it's anyone's guess.
---
No one man should have all that power
---
As a R6S player myself i agree with that
---
From a perspective of a toxic survivor, killers must disappear from the map after hooking or they are camping.
---
I don't recall adept achievements being unable to push through if someone DC's though.
---
"your art style isn't sexy" fuck you mean it's not sexy, it's hot af
---
I like playing killer. If someone leaves, I either feel like my Hag is good or people don't feel like playing against it. I'll stroke my ego all I want if people are going to tell me I'm bad for playing a character I enjoy. Considering it seems like a lot of people say Hag isnt great, it's funny to me when people DC against me. Maybe something is going on behind the scenes of the survivors and that's why the DC happens, but I had a whole part of four disconnect once I got two of them down as Hag. I just don't see it as toxicity unless I get some sort of feedback.
---
Well i don‚Äôt think it would be very hard to tell whether or not someone clicked the disconnect button
---
r/4panelcringe
---
I've always wanted to make a build for that perk, i really hope it's fun.
---
We couldn't heal and neither gate would let us leave.  We had to die to end the match.
---
Yeah, the community is in a bit of a sorry state right now. Hopefully, as some Fog Whisperers have supposedly hinted at (would love a source on that, u/SlumberBalu), DC'ing will be "fixed" when the dedicated server update is released.
---
well on its own its garbage but i think the only time its worth using is for an antiheal build or a slugging build because in that case its good but it doesnt really matter much cuz its garbage for gens better for anithealing cuz espescially with the nerf to heal speed its really good
---
Dafuq? Billy is useless if you can‚Äôt chainsaw properly and even then survivors can easily fake a hit and you miss. Also, windows. Nuff said.
---
I do see your point, but it changes the dynamic of the key. I am not saying it is a dramatic change, but it is there.
---
So it's only when the game doesn't respond? I guess I've never been it then. Lol
---
Also good practice for some of the harder skillchecks like madness or overcharge.
---
you might as well just do gens thats the only way to counter it
---
claudettes: I think what you ment to say was disconnect
---
jk awesome tutorial man this is probably gonna some newer players!
---
Neither are good really. STBFL doesn‚Äôt effect her blink hits which is 99% of your hits. Play with your food doesn‚Äôt really matter as you don‚Äôt care about her walk speed since you use blink for everything.
---
This is not true, I saw two people freeing themselves on the same box several times.
---
I'm saying I leave bugged matches when some of these make the game unplayable, it takes 30 mins to find a match so I want to play one that works.
---
Technician is broken just because it is a useless perk
---
The numbers aren‚Äôt high enough to consider running
---
true. just got confused that then gen-block appears like a dangerous threat in the video. oh well we'll see how it turns out.
---
is it already known when the update comes out?
---
Ryu ga waaaaaaaaaaah *hanzo screams and fires dragons into the sky* 
---
Though nurse really is just a slower tracer.
---
Are you telling me she finally has a chance of being a good killer under very specific conditions and now they want to give her the legion treatment?
---
It wasn't a forsure thing but eh
---
I said I was new (less than 24 hours in the game) and I always found those perks kind of annoying to deal with, sorry for being a fucking idiot as usual though
---
why i love billy boi
---
Glad to hear you‚Äôre having a good time üòÉ I‚Äôve been playing for almost 3 years now, at 1400 hours and still having fun with the game
---
And what will you do if they never look for it?
---
my response was explaining why it was easy to determine whether people were dodging our cosmetics??? did you not read my comment at all and just go straight in for the shade?
---
Friends, when I solo I bring small game and cleans all totems I come across for Noed counter and free points. If I go swf make sure someone has it. I have not seen a Noed work in weeks. I don't understand survivor mindsets. How many second chance perks do you need? I learned this lesson so quick. Cleansing totems takes seconds. Hearing any excuses why you can't defy reason.  Yes sometimes you will deal with Noed. RNG but the odds are so low if you deal with totems. Are you all solo players? If a swf can't counter Noed then that's sad. Sorry I don't buy the excuses.
---
true. gg ez
---
It's been a long time
---
well i think he is better because now he ACTUALLY takes more skill to play
---
I was thinking of a build for new legion being Thanatophobia, Sloppy butcher, and Ruin. Last perk probably BBQ for the points. And maybe blade add-ons to slow them even more.
---
Well - what's the problem? I dc' when I dont feel like playing against this xy guy. I can lobby dodge, If I dont feel like playing against 2+ toolboxes. Wheres the difference? Ah right, You can't see the Killer, the Killer can see you, and you dont know what Addon's he's gonna play, while he see's your Items. So yes, you can def. compare a Lobby dodge to a DC. Just cause it's ingame, for survs - which is impossible to dodge the lobby with the knowledge the killer is gonna be a lot of "aids" / except MLGA Highping / Blocked alert.
---
I‚Äôm glad you liked my art style!
---
Me to Claudettes: Oh yes ma'am, my apologies.
---
Thanks! I know most of the survivors (and killers) on the sub know this, but I figured it would help newer players. There are more killer guides (I made a couple but I know there are much better ones out there), and the survivors guides are more general, which is good. But I usually don't see guides on how to handle certain killers, so I made one.
---
Nice
---
Yes, the hatchet just ran a mile
---
Meg popping a fat dab then yeeting the fuck outta there.
---
Not an issue üòä
---
I'm a killer main too and I find your point to be completely invalid, and I've been playing just as long as you have. If not longer. Also, spell check your comment before you try to call other people stupid for disagreeing with you.
---
 Anyways. All games should end. The current "end game" point of the trial is hot garbage. DBD needed a hard end to matches and it has nothing to do with skill. Now the game will end once the conclusion is already foregone (gens done with no sacrifices or you're the last survivor standing) instead of it going on for however long the survivors wish to dance around in the exit gates. Either deal with that or don't, I for one welcome it. Escapes should be frantic, not a leisurely stroll through a god damn park.
---
You might be the lamest living human.
---
You have to double pip. The new pip system makes it very difficult if you don‚Äôt get the maximum number of hooks.
---
Knock Out and Franklin‚Äôs Demise are hella good perks, tho.
---
I know, it's been so long since it was teased that I completely forgot it existed until you brought it up. But we're never gonna get bunny Feng PepeHands
---
I freaked out when I got the Adept Spirit trophy while at Rank 1 before reset.
---
I'd get Ash instead of Jane.
---
He is better looking, has a puppet hand skin and his perks are better.
---
Both turn me on...  what‚Äôs your point?
---
Jane is part of the pack though, 6.50 for the killer and her. Just wondered if i should get the plague for 4 or both for 6.50
---
I love "Bone Mask." This meme has some love put into it.
---
Well I usually would agree but there is one logical flaw in the statement I answered to.
---
&gt;This would be insanely good for freddy for example
---
&gt; if you have someone already downed
---
Maybe you can see the flaw. /s
---
Yeah that's stupid, if you have two people hooked in basement then obviously you're going to defend that spot especially in the endgame if gates are powered
---
Its my favorite killer. Just get everybody in the basement and have fun :)
---
Less BP.
---
Doink
---
Your tone and diction give off the vibe that you're saltier than the entire survivor player base combined. Anything that makes the little fuckers leave is welcome. The whole point of the end game collapse is to literally end the game.
---
no i think they should buff other killers to bump each of them up in terms of killing potencial
---
Playing 3-blink Ruin Demise Legacy Nurse might not be so conducive to having your average survivor want to play the round. A sincere tip.
---
(Though of course I know that disconnects/suicides happen plenty outside of Nurse/Legion matches, as well.)
---
When a survivor is tired of hearing "git gud"
---
Usually a good indicator is the logo not going through the animations - just being still.
---
I give it a count to five to knock it off now before I close my client, since I‚Äôve actually had it fix itself since they fixed some instances of the infinite loading screen, but sometimes it‚Äôs actually frozen.
---
No the difference is one leads to the slight nuisance of everyone having to search another game, while the other actively ruins the game for 3 other survivors (and to a degree also the killers), thats why, you tool.
---
Look at little Goblin Jr. Gonna cry?
---
Definitely Spirit. Unlike Plague, you don't need inexperienced survivors to use your power. 
---
If people don't cleanse against Plague, she is a regular M1 killer.
---
...ok. Regardless, I don't see why YouTubers make big dramatic exits and remove their content. There are a lot of great memes on this subreddit, and there are other memes on YouTube.
---
He could just be cool about it and leave his content up instead of deleting his channel or he could do what he's doing (apparently) and deleting his channel.
---
Maybe a little harsh, but true.
---
Link to the video?
---
Love these! Your art is always incredible :)
---
Especially the ability to turn anti-aliasing off. I can't play on anything other than low just because of how blurry it gets at high graphic settings.
---
yeah leatherface definently needs a buff and some of his add ons are completely pointless
---
&gt;Jane is part of the pack though, 6.50 for the killer and her. Just wondered if i should get the plague for 4 or both for 6.50
---
Getting the DLC from store is always a better option. It comes with both characters, one or two exclusive cosmetic (that usually aren't that different tbh) and on PC, it allows family share, which is neat.
---
Thank you :)
---
As survivor main (solo) it pisses me off to no end and I report every one of them that is obvious. (DCs when downed, picked up, etc). It's so frustrating. It's even worse when a SWF team DCs all at once because one gets downed.
---
Also they reward point in the survival category.
---
The Legion situational is questionable, perhaps the Legion may appear useful in the PTB. He might be low mid-tier but at least having 115% movement speed with the ability to injure a survivor for free could provide the potential for anti-healing builds. Slapping on Sloppy will do a great deal of time wasting now that Legion could be a formidable killer.
---
Feral Frenzy Benefiting from exposed perks would be Op. The ability to vault pallets &amp; windows would make insta-downs too strong for Legion. 
---
The whole basis for Legions power is to keep everyone injured &amp; waste their time. Having everyone injured will really slow down the game as survivors will have serious pressure to heal against him. Combine with perks like sloppy then you have a very powerful anti-heal killer. That seems to be the way forward with the new legion in my mind.
---
If your asking for advice with the current Legion, the best build for Legion in my opinion is;
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse - Having a 16m terror radius allows you to catch survivors off guard &amp; potentially down them before they can reach a pallet
---
Ruin - Slow movement speed combined with poor chasing potential means he needs all the time he can get
---
Discordance or Whispers - Finding survivors at the beginning of the match is really good for Legion as he needs all the pressure he can get. Discordance probably works best for Legion but since most decent players will expect it with Legion then they might spread out their gen work meaning whispers would be more useful.
---
BBQ - Allows you to find survivors &amp; increases your bp gainage. Considering how Legion earns alot of bp from frenzy it really helps you get new add-ons for him.
---
Add-ons;
---
- Personally I like to use a speed add-on with a duration add-on. Allows you to cover more ground &amp; use the power more effectively. 
---
- Combining cool-down add-ons is really powerful for Legion as it allows him to end Frenzy right behind survivors &amp; down them fast.
---
- Best add-on is Franks mixtape but most people will DC if you use that add-on because its brokenly OP
---
- Would not use the Blade add-ons with Legion. They are glitched &amp; could potentially get you banned if you use them. I dont know if its glitched if you use them individually but I would stay away from them regardless.
---
- Recovery add-ons are alright. Good if you are using Frenzy to down survivors but usually I like to hit as many as possible then fatigue right behind or infront of a survivor to try &amp; catch up for an easy hit.
---
Discordance is a great perk for all levels of play. It's easily one of the best tracking perks in the game with whispers overtaking it in practicallity. 
---
Discordance allows you to kick start a match by finding a group of players &amp; provides you with useful information on the general progression of gens. 
---
Discordance is definitely the best gen monitoring perk available. The best tracking perk though in my opinion is whispers as its more practical in that it can be used for more scenarios but does not provide as much information.
---
Where i can get this?
---
I‚Äôd have probably just been like 
---
‚ÄúScrew this, I‚Äôm not giving this guy a 3K.‚Äù 
---
Then left
---
I‚Äôm not putting my survival at risk for someone who can‚Äôt even be bothered to crawl away from the killer, especially not with NOED active
---
Dont let this post distract you from the lack of finger-guns.
---
Cool i'll pick up the whole thing then. Thank you :D
---
The game is supposed to be a every man for himself. You help each other ultimately so that it becomes easier for you to escape and for points. If rescuing is worth risking to lose the 5000 from survival then do it, otherwise dont. VS noed you just insta escape if you can generally unless the totem gets broken by somebody on the way.
---
Don¬¥t throw a Hatch, just M1...
---
Yeah rank reset is a game killer for me. Was a constant Rank 1 player, always had good times playing. Don't have time to play as much now so been stuck around Rank 8 or lower each rank reset and the people are just dumb as fuck lol.
---
KILL THEM ALL
---
Haha well done! Shit got real right after that missed skill check lol
---
understandable, have a nice day.
---
Why? Pallets are the only defense
---
We‚Äôll make it buff idea: the people you save off the hook have their entire screen taken up by the icon to force them to heal
---
For the memes, ye
---
Have you tried forcing anti-aliasing off for DbD in your graphic card's control panel? Not saying this works, just curious.
---
Does the little report by the name actually DO anything? I always report them if they D/C in one of my matches.
---
Spirit is generally considered to be a better killer because her power has both a high skill ceiling but is very good as it forces survivors to guess where you are during your phase meaning you can very easily mind-game survivors &amp; get a hit on them. 
---
The spirit's power also allows her to bypass loops via mind-games or cover large distances quickly.
---
The plague is great for forcing survivors to make a choice between always being injured or healing themselves but granting you a ranged attack. The plague can punish survivors that become broken really well &amp; with the range attack can stop survivors from saving each other or end chases very quickly. 
---
The issue with the plague is that unlike the spirit, she lacks mind-game potential &amp; suffers drastically from being looped. 
---
Vomiting on a survivor takes time to perform &amp; can be wasted if you are being looped around a tall obstacle. The plague is one of the weakest killers in the game to being pallet looped as her vomit doesn't help against it &amp; she loses her ranged attack if she gets pallet stunned meaning being looped is very dangerous while in corrupt form. 
---
Additionally, If survivors do not cleanse, they can loop the plague like any normal killer &amp; use perks like dead hard to avoid attacks. A good survivor can still occupy a plagues time with loop &amp; force the plague to chase them like any normal M1 killer. At the end game, survivors can cleanse to instantly heal &amp; force the plague to have to travel far from the exit gates to gain access to corrupt or continue defending the gates as a standard M1 killer.
---
Overall spirit is undoubtedly the better killer. She has a higher skill ceiling in the plague but has much more killing potential &amp; can very easily 4k in a match if used properly.
---
Don't you two *ever* tire of failing in your mission?
---
Small game main ;o
---
Dying light is really bad unless you run  mori which I don't like to do
---
I felt so much stress in that video
---
A survivor who doesn't understand how to play the game thinks he's OP.
---
Can the killer  open the gate at any time?
---
Why would the killer want to open the exit gates?
---
If the hatch is closed by the killer is it permanent?
---
/ can i use a key to open the hatch after the killer closed it?
---
Can killers abuse blood warden now?
---
Its not even the red ranks and you're using nurse with 3 blinks +Ruin and wonder why people DC?
---
Pc disconnections Survivor gameplay is normal but I‚Äôm getting discs and freezes when I play killer just like in the post plague update. Shame, I thought they were fixed this when the pip update happens.
---
well theres 7 counters to bbq and chili hiding behind generators giong the opposite way after seeing someone getting hooked at long range running distortion (which in my opinion is a pretty garbage perk most of the time.) theres also 2 counters to ruin either looking for the totem or learning to hit great skillchecks
---
They're going to change the reverse bear traps for the new endgame.  Though we have no idea what they are doing with them yet.
---
Nah we got 3 min to teabag that‚Äôs enough time
---
Id rather not play against omega nurse/billy either
---
It's not adapt, it's adept. Jesus Christmas how does everyone make this mistake.
---
Do yourself a favor and just facecamp if you suck so much you feel you need to mercilessly tunnel unhooked survivors.
---
Don't go into the basement in the end game? Accept that the killer holds an extremely strong position and play it safe and leave.
---
Or accept the risk and try to save but realize, being stuck in the basement with the collapse happening is a possibility.
---
As it's already been stated many, many times that blocking the stairs to wait out BT is not abuse, the same logic applies here. You are doing with a tactical goal in mind, not to force a DC.
---
And I don't see how survivors blocking with multiple people is not only ok, but also not "scummy" but then if I see a survivor put themselves into a corner and I block with Plague to get a free vile purge into broken status, how is that "scummy"? They have control of their character, they took a risky position and got punished for it. 
---
Survivors need to weigh the risk of their actions, not everyone lives every game and you can escape with 3 by letting 1 die versus everyone trying to save that last guy and all of you get snowballed and killed.
---
Yeah I've noticed Technician doesn't actually reduce the repair noises. Honestly though it needs a complete rework.
---
So we have infinites again? Great
---
Amanda is disappointed in your weak trap skills.  Try again, but better.  Make it impossible to win.
---
F
---
Ik, and during the whole game she was throwing towards her left that's why I went right. But ig I got outplayed lmao
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug/Exploit: In Game
---
Description of Bug/Exploit: When playing as the Pig, if someone disconnects as you pick them up or are already carrying them, you go into this hybrid crouch/standing state.  If you crouch after that, you automatically stand up, move more slowly, and ambush more slowly.  So far the only fix seems to be to down another survivor and hook them.
---
Both thoses killers and survivors are selective cowards
---
That's why I wear the camo pants. That way they can only see my muscles running straight at them. It's not uncommon for them to start working on a gen and trying to escape.
---
Oh trust me, I almost pissed myself when I kissed my health skill check
---
Just for clarification, the UI mod did not add this into the files. This was inside the game files before I installed the UI mod. You can check yourself on PC. It‚Äôs in perks.
---
gg ez baby killer
---
True, I probably shouldn't of said balance and bugs, may bad, but still theirs nothing wrong with reusing assets to save time on other things, especially when maps are pretty much free
---
NO AMANDA, I will improve! PLS give me another chance.
---
No Mither players expect to die is why we don't DC as much
---
True, to a degree.  Those games have a competitive aspect to them.  How good can you get running around a pallet?  
---
I will say playing Huntress last year was pretty fun for me.  I probably put 300-400 hours into her.  That felt like it took a lot more skill than anything else in DBD. 
---
If you enjoy the game, enjoy it.  I was heavily addicted to it for a long time.  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad game, I just have no interest to play anymore.
---
It‚Äôs not fun, and I play games to have fun.
---
[Unused Perks
---
](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks#Unused_Perks)
---
Better save than sorry, but i will look and ask if i can find the clip or if anybody can point me towards it again. Sorry for the delay !
---
This is why I both hate and love we'll make it. A lot of juicy points from an 8 second heal but often  you literally have to chase the survivor to heal them wasting a lot of time.
---
In this case, all four of them left the match, none of them wanted to play against this nurse. So yeah you can compare it to lobby dodging.
---
that just made me smile. and then cry cause smiling makes my migraine worse. but thank you anyway, i was drowning in self-pity here.
---
tbf prayer beads spirit is maximum no counterplay
---
So what the hell are gens, and why you wanna fix them? (Ew)
---
Ahh thanks
---
After that many hours I'd have fatigue too. I have similar feelings for Battlefield 4 as you do for DBD. 
---
HAPPY KILLING!
---
You don't have to have a 4k anymore. Just double pip. I got the pigs with a 3k and the last person escaped by the hatch. However it used to be you could get the trophy from just getting a 4k but sadly not anymore.
---
Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/pAQNzKU
---
shit you're lucky you get at least one person to join. i'm at rank 20 and cannot get one survivor but i get a survivor lobby in literally 3 seconds.
---
Agreed!! I want to see more of your stuff! r/DBDGoneGay
---
well its an option
---
Yeah, 3vs see super bad right now, and the midmatch dcs seem to be at an all time high vs everything.  Wraith gets a stealth hit, DC, get downed first, DC, miss 3 hatchets, DC, ruin blows in 30s, DC.  Shit is out of hand.  Can't wait for the kick back to lobby when someone dcs.  Game will probably drop to #7, 621,784 on twitch because all streamers will just be going back and forth to lobbies, as will the rest of us. 
---
Also looking forward to folks burning shrouds of separation just for giggles.
---
I suppose "Artefact Hunter" was the early rendition of the perk "Plunders Instinct". Similar to the perk "Last Stand" was the early development of "Left Behind"
---
No worries. If you do find it, feel free to DM it to me.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to loop them not wait until the killer is about to hit you, the goal in a chase is not to lose the killer, but to waste as much time as possible for your team to do gens.
---
And anybody who downvoted me doesn‚Äôt know shit
---
When the endgame update for Pig winds up being that endgame collapse just never activates if you're playing Pig... 
---
:p
---
Leather face got nothing! We could have had shack and the main house from the first Texas chainsaw massacre
---
outplayed. lmao jk that's a new one though, in all my 600 hours of dbd Ive never seen that one.
---
Is English your first language? Lmao
---
Both are good, Spirit is generally better because of her mindgaming and mobility. Plague has a lot of game control, a powerful ranged ability and can essentially instadown so long as you‚Äôre decent with the vile purge.
---
YES SIR !
---
Theoretically, if all but one survivor is dead, then killer closes hatch, then they could open gate even though no gens were completed.  Pretty edge case though.
---
But how will this affect dull and skeleton keys? Will you still be able to use them even after the killer has closed the hatch? Cause if not keys are just completely useless since the hatch doesn't spawn until there is only 1 survivor left
---
Guessing they will have to remove the achivement for all 4 survivors escaping through the hatch
---
I didn't downvote but it depends on the killer if you can pallet camp because it all depends on their skill and if you can stun them and start a loop with it
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
I dc prayer beads every time
---
reopening the hatch after it's been closed.
---
Pig and trapper basically.  Realistically, not really any good reason to.  Same with the shroud that starts everyone together.
---
Gen rushers should die
---
They really did screw over leatherface smh
---
But then a toxic nea with a flashlight apears and blinds you
---
Ugh. I had a daily to complete like three sacrifices as Myers. It took forever, because of people DCing. I had one game where I downed everyone, and before I could put them on the hook, they all DC'd. All four of them. It does seem worse now than it did before.
---
Join the killer main battalion
---
And im allowed to choose what kind of killer i want to play against... Fair gor everyone.
---
BBQ, enduring,spirit fury, and so on.. ruin is optional but if you can put enough pressure with a billy or nurse then you don't need
---
You can still get a hatch victory if you just his the whole time though so....
---
I chase whoever gives me the least trouble. Someone who just came off the hook running straight into me, who is also pallet happy, is not only the least trouble, they're actively fucking their whole team.
---
Good survivors make tunneling suboptimal, bad survivors just feed and then bitch on reddit.
---
Rare unless you bring plunderer's.  Seems like that has a 80% chance to drop a key these days
---
As opposed to mecilessly tunnelling hooked survivors?
---
As someone who plays basically only Overwatch and DBD this was awesome. :3
---
No unfortunately
---
There‚Äôs thinking involved, survivors literally hold M1 unless they‚Äôre in a chase.
---
No pallet camping is ALWAYS wrong. You shouldn't stand still next to a pallet waiting for the killer. You should be half way the loop so you can start looping the killer. I hate it when people camp near pallets because it makes the game run out of pallets 3 times faster. This is how people lose games.
---
YEET
---
I remember one time my connection was so spicy the game placed me in the exit gate area and I ended up just walking out lmao
---
I‚Äôve seen it once or twice before when someone would get stuck behind there, but waking back in usually corrected it. This time we couldn‚Äôt fix it no matter what. :(
---
Yep
---
 Ay ye makes sense. Cause Rank does matter in DbD right? Because you get rewards for being R1 ? Or R10 ? Nice passive agression here. Maybe cut that a bit (?) - It's legit my opinion what the difference is. If that's not your opinion, lay it out - but don't pretend you're actually smth. Yikes. If I do not have fun playing the game, I will dc. It's not like the "3" other survs, will die because of that. + Idk if the bug is still in the game, but 3 man lobbys 90% were already fun enough, would you accuse those people who dc than too, that they are ruining the fun of ther 2 other peoples? Everyone plays the game like they want to play the game. If I dont like that, I'll dc. Simple. xD
---
Fuck off.... yall killers get matches handed to you anymore with the perk buffs, If you cant 3k to 4k then you need more practice. 
---
EVERYONE AND THERE MOM CAN AGREE THE NURSE NEEDS A NERF...
---
Went after a Claudette after she got an unhook and as soon as I hit her once she went and hid behind a wall and DC before I could hit her again. Immediately got a message saying I was camping trash killer. She wasn‚Äôt even the one on the hook and was never on the hook as the game just started
---
Thank you! Who‚Äôs your favorite Overwatch character?
---
Dcing will be fixed when servers come out in the summer, they can‚Äôt punish it right now due to infinite loading screen and other connection problems. Stop bitching we know dcs suck.
---
Lmaoooo. She was the first survivor I came across and DCd before anything was even done. It‚Äôs hilariously sad
---
Killers will be able to open exit gates.
---
let me check
---
What do you mean no unfortunately, like we cant get a penalty update?
---
Ok, I will try!!
---
Why would you complain about going against one of the most balanced killers in the game?
---
Nah killers can dodge every lobby if they dont like what the survivor has in their hand or if they come in and look like swf.. but survivors have to take qhT they get?
---
It‚Äôs my understanding that they become repaired once the hatch is shut.
---
To be fair, most people circle jerk opinions their fed without being good enough to understand them. Leather face is good UNTIL youre a good survivor. Then hes bad. I loop LF all day. Hes not scary, hes not viable later, and if you do pick him, you‚Äôre gimping yourself
---
I love games like that lol. And yes I know what u mean by the NoED/ruin part. Only time I use them is with a killer that has no decent perks or a killer I haven't got leveled up yet.
---
Either that or bloodpoints/pip penality tbh.
---
More wanting variety rather than a bitch post on Billy mains.
---
Dude I wish I could say there is a penalty but Yknow, endgame collapse will come and fix the game not penalizing all the lag switchers and people who rage quit
---
I‚Äôm not opposed to it. 
---
Pig with noed would be incredibly annoying if her traps did the same thing. Hope they don‚Äôt nerf her too bad though. Maybe they‚Äôll buff another part of her kit.
---
The last one is me :( lol
---
You too my guy glad I couldn‚Äôt make you understand the value of our lord and savior Bubba
---
He looks angry as fuq. And i mean i would be also if i had a spear for a hand.
---
Its the sad truth. Like maybe even a hag with mint rag and make your choice is infinitely more appropriate than pig having it
---
The problem is the head and body are separate cosmetics so they need to make the hair not look weird with the hood added with the body. They did it with Plague however, where her body has a wrap over her head so they should be able to figure it out.
---
feeling exactly like that, when my totem is gone in less than 2 minutes, when the game starts...
---
sometimes playing survivor running through the whole map and the totem explodes when there's only 1 gen left. yikes
---
Surviving is a rare occurrence for some.....
---
The hatch does spawn in normal conditions. Ie 1 survivor dead, 3 alive, hatch spawns when 4 gens are done. It's just if there's one survivor left, it will ALWAYS spawn, no matter the gen completion. That means, for the time being, you can still use skeleton key/dull keys.
---
And yes, I'm pretty sure you can still get the achievement because I see no reason why the hatch would not spawn if all gens are done and all survivors are alive.
---
3 blink alone would make me stop queuing.
---
Franklins is a meme. Most Toolboxes go after the first gen. Thats not why franklins is good. Its good against alexs toolbox, insta heals, and intsa blind torches. Even then its not worth a slot unless its a swf and you see them all with flash lights
---
Sorry, I meant open. It should spawn open when there's one survivor left no matter what the gens are.
---
Personally, I love a lot of the characters. Game play wise I'd probably say Ana, Zen or [D.va](https://D.va). Lore wise I'd probably say Ana, Reaper, or Sombra. My goal is to do a [D.va](https://D.va) Cosplay someday or a young Ana cosplay. I just have so much love for that game! 
---
How about you?!
---
not sure how to do that but I'll look into it
---
It's just the [Endgame reveal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGzYaiiMlY)
---
It is not my first language lol and still i Don t see answers to my questions?
---
On console, I've remapped skill checks to square. Dunno about the wiggle though.
---
Most of the daddy Myers memes come from guys actually who are straightn‚Äôt
---
yeah,...its not like the survivors cant do gens if I find the hatch....oh wait...
---
The hitbox for the chainsaw is broken he will chainsaws you even if there is an angle between you and the chainsaw or even if you already vault the windows.
---
I hope so.
---
You are implicitly though. Getting tunneled is a good stradegy for the killer. In fact most of the time a killer tunnels you, its because youre he weakest link and go down easy. I say this as a survivor main. Its up to youre team to stop the tunnel. This means unhooking at good times, or body blocking and switching aggro. Theres lots of ways to do it. So to say you‚Äôre getting tunneled is to say that 1) youre not good enough at wasting the killers time, and 2) that you cant rely on the randies on youre team to help you thus you need a swf. Theres my train of logic from your whining. Reality is most killers dont tunnel or camp because it loses games. If you were on the hook and he is close enough to come back and chase you again then you dint know how to hide, and also he wasnt checking gens. So also he will lose the game. This vould keep going but ive said enough
---
Within a week of getting this game for free on PSPlus last year, I shut off friend requests, messages, and groups.  
---
Didn't matter if I played killer or survivor, played well or poorly, some teenager had something salty to say to me.
---
Almost every game I play as survivor the killer is hillbilly
---
The only reason I even check this sub anymore is for great memes like this.
---
Ah yeah, I got hooked next to a gate and when I was unhooked I catapulted me over the gate but I was able to escape. This was within the first few months of the game though
---
Hitboxes in this game are broken in general. Maybe you should start a campaign to fix the hitboxes so billy‚Äôs chainsaw doesn‚Äôt piledrive you through a window and so the game is better in general.
---
I've seen high level DBDers do this and I've personally adopted it into my play style. It's honestly helped me more than it's fucked me. I hate when the Claudette runs off to a spot all the way across the map for me to heal them. Just let me give you butt rubs and we can both be gone.
---
For real.  This game discourages anyone being decent at killer.
---
The better you play the more they DC.
---
It's hard to continue playing.
---
It is creating a shitty environment, the only killers sticking around are ones that cant play as well and they will want to leave too.
---
Too close to Tinkerer and not great enough.
---
IDK. Gotta say, at first I couldn't wrap my head around this update. Tyde Time pointed out that this is not a game changer, just a way to end the game quicker - which, honestly, is all I need sometimes.
---
I mean fuck nurse. I dont dc against her very often but i understand why people will. Also instead of analyzing why masses of people dc how bout you analyze what makes them dc against certain killers. How certain killers shoudnt be obnoxious as they are. I see nothing wrong with dcing. If a killer is running a slug build and were all on the ground, im out. Why should i sit there for like 5 minutes doing literally nothing while i watch a huntress bait my team. Im moving to the next game
---
It works, but it's still clunky. 
---
If you bind **Pick Up Interactions** to Square/X, that means you're using your thumb for gens and healing.
---
If you bind **Actions** to Square/X, that means you're vaulting and dropping pallets with your thumb.
---
IMO that's not really ideal for me since I want to be able to use my camera at all times without learning claw.
---
Behavior should just split the actions into individual parts and let us bind each one.
---
For example, I would bind Healing to Left Dpad, Pick Up Items would be Triangle/Y. And if you have anything else you want separated, put it to Square/X or the remaining Dpad slot.
---
A stationary action like healing/mending mapped to your left thumb allows you to hit skill checks and use your camera freely.
---
/u/peanits /u/not_queen_bhvr
---
I cannot say you're wrong
---
This is really helpful, thank you so much!
---
How much time are you wasting waiting for another lobby, exactly? 5 seconds? How is that choice comparable to a survivor waiting for the game loading in, and leaving because a killer is using add-ons above common tier? Not only are you sabotaging your team, which let's be honest, you don't care about, but you're also ruining the game for the killer. 
---
You're impacting the game in a negative way for 4 other players and wasting time because you feel entitled playing a game your way.
---
Alright, thank you
---
I love Soldier: 76, Brigitte, and Reaper. I usually play them. I also really like Tracer but her play style is too difficult. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting so nervous when I must play Tracer in [Storm Rising] and [Uprising]üòÖ I should practice her more.
---
üò™
---
Alsp spirit fury is a scummy perk to use for noobs to get free hits, don't care how many killermains wanna pretend it isn't.
---
Both are great. Spirit high tier but I love Plague‚Äôs ability.
---
This. If there's Ruin, I'll sometimes go straight to where the killer came from and it's almost always there. I find this to be especially true with Spirits and Huntresses.
---
4 matches in a row yesterday.  Had 3 or 4 DC as soon as I hit them the first time every time.
---
Phone mechanic sounds epic, or maybe instead of a phone have his power enhanced by the entity so that he can talk in your mind
---
I MEAN I AIN‚ÄôT GOT MONEY TO SPARE BUYING THE GAME
---
But you can't see their timer go down anymore
---
Yeah, both seem pretty good so I had a hard time choosing. Thank you for the reply
---
You just dont know what youre talking about is all.
---
You got worked by a billy we get it but...
---
\-there is a penalty when you bump into something
---
&amp;
---
\-there is a rest period when you stop chainsaw even if you dont hit something its like 1.5 secs.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, you can do what us killers had to do, and learn to play around the nonsense. I'm not going to be the one to tell you to just "git gud" because there will be plenty of people along the way who will do that for me. What I CAN say is that the nurse certainly isn't infallible. There are plenty of ways to get around her, just like every other killer in the game. You aren't meant to survive every game, just like killers aren't supposed to 4k every game
---
Same here. I only have 2 left.
---
No problem, personally, I like playing the Plague a bit more because of her versatility but go for Spirit if you wanna get 4ks
---
Ah Ok, that makes sense, thanks!
---
&gt;Killers will be able to open exit gates.
---
Why would you do that as a killer? 
---
If a killer opens an exit game for me, I would just sit near it waiting for him to leave or I would go open the other one myself.
---
DCing is so shitty. I look at it like this.
---
 If you DC because you don't like the map, that's not a good enough reason. If you DC cause your teammate died, that's not a good reason. If you DC because you don't like the killer, that's not a good reason. If you DC cause you raged about a hit connecting when you think it didn't, that's not a good reason.
---
HOWEVER. If you're being held hostage, DC. If you just faced the same exact camping hillbilly 5 games straight, DC. If the other survivors survival is dependant on you DCing for say hatch, sure I guess.

I tried to get back into playing killer after a few months gone. And I thought "Let's get some of the new killer trophies since I've been gone" lol nope. I tried playing as Legion and Plague and just constant DCs, followed by harassing PSN messages sometimes, followed by me wasting blood point offerings and add-ons, and then I try to play survivor and guess what the survivors are still Disconnecting leaving me and my friend to play alone or down a guy more often than should ever happen.
---
Seriously.....they know their audience, I‚Äôve ordered 13.
---
See not all claudettes are evil.
---
i don‚Äôt think there should be a BP penalty, BP are already scarce enough as it is. but it would be cool to see the entity displeased that the killer can‚Äôt finish the job by their own hand and sacrificing them too
---
Knowing BHVR, they probably didn‚Äôt think of that.
---
Survivor mains crying that they wouldn't be able to be toxic.
---
PS4 struggles to run this game strangely.
---
Die.
---
I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud
---
1) Invalid, ok to each his own opinion
---
2) English is not my native language so thanks for being nazi about that instead of focusing on an idea
---
3) Tell me where I did call someone "stupid", I'm just asking for ability to think instead the usual answers there's on this sub " lolol you fuc***g survivor main you trash". Yes, I'm the on getting offended right there, but I guess you don't care. At least we got a mutual agreement on this.
---
4) I agree with you and I think you did misunderstand my point about all this. I said this new Collapse thing is just a shortcut to please some people crying instead of developping a' in depth solution. The concept is really cool, I like it, but in its actual state, its badly designed (who said legion ?). 
---
You re ok with the fact to leave someone one the hook because there's a timer ? Even if the duration is increased, it just encourage selfishness. This is disgusting in my opinion.
---
I agree slugging is annoying, but I'd argue those are few and far between playing survivor throughout the ranks. Yet, despite how annoying those games are, I don't DC. Some killers are obnoxious, but that's why survivors are compensated with just as obnoxious perks. I mean, they legit just nerfed DS and implemented MoM behind a paywall. MoM isn't broken like DS, but it's definitely close to how obnoxious the latter was.
---
You shouldn't be DCing at all unless it's over a technical reason. Like, if I'm playing League of Legends I'm not going to leave the game because of a hard lane. That would be dumb. I can bitch about how obnoxious the game is, or certain champions, but I'm not going to leave because it's making me upset. 
---
You only DC because you know it's okay to do and there are no repercussions for doing so infrequently, or at least enough to avoid getting banned. And that's the problem with this community right now.
---
You morons really think anything that's not hillbilly spirit or nurse is underpowered right?
---
beautiful
---
If the killers can open the exit gates to concede the match at any time during the game, then I won't be dodging toxic SWF teams anymore... I'll just play wraith/freddy, open the gate at the start of the game, and block the basement stairs until they all leave. They don't want me to have fun? They don't get to have any either.
---
my PS4 only struggles at the opening screen, i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs just because the frame rate is uncapped on the opening screen. if your PS4 is struggling when playing the game then maybe it‚Äôs worth removing the back and giving it a clean
---
Rank 15s tbagging and flashlight spamming after every pallet vs when you throw a hatchet at them when they go to blind you
---
I KNOW I USED TO BE RANK 2 BUT MY BOYFRIEND CAN NEVER CLIMB PAST RANK 12 SO IM TRYING TO ONLY PLAY WITH HIM TO HELP HIM CLIMB UP A LIL BE BETTER.
---
MoM is obviously pay2win and nyone who doesn't see it can suck my dick.
---
FAIR ENOUGH THAT MAKES SENSE! HOPE YOU GET THERE SOON!
---
man im gonna get downvoted af but im just gonna say it. as killer makes to you absolutely 0 difference if they DC, i dont really see the need to post it here. with that being said, some people play the game just to have fun, and there's absolutely nothing fun about being matched against this imo. i wouldnt DC, but i can't really say i don't understand the reason behind the DC's. some killers want to win so much that they wont care if anyone else is actually enjoying their game (which is totally fine, but so is their decision to not want any part of it). Gamebreaking killer, OP build, straight up not fun. just my 2 cents anyways
---
I don't know the exact reason but, DBD's opening screen runs hotter than the actual game. 
---
As you can see here: [Image](https://i.imgur.com/kxAODay.jpg). I know the screenshots are from 2.1 but it hasn't changed since then.
---
The same happens during the offering screen, before a match starts.
---
Stfu.
---
This is why whispers is good. I can check my totem without even being near it. Just gotta make it seem like it's part of my patrol.
---
I've reached rank 1 as killer a long time ago, but I still suck at survivor and I've been trying to do exactly what you described. Be more aggro, try to waste the killer's time, go more for saves instead of waiting for the rank 19 Claudette that runs into a corner to loop the killer while I hold M1
---
But thanks for downvoting when someone gives an honest advice.
---
inb4: reeee devs better do stupid customization than fix actual problems
---
i mean it's great and all but what about the fact that Trapper's and Wraith's mori animations are boring and basically the same thing?? i think that's something to address above everything else
---
(this is a joke)
---
As a killer main, it never ceases to make me laugh after rank reset when survivors start throwing pallets down and butt dancing, because I know a minute from now they're gonna run out and gonna be fucked
---
That's something you're going to have to come to terms with. Like, do you seriously think it would be fair to allow survivors to pick which killer they face against?
---
&gt;my PS4 only struggles at the opening screen, i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs just because the frame rate is uncapped on the opening screen though. if your PS4 is struggling when playing the game then maybe it‚Äôs worth removing the back and giving it a clean
---
That screen is "bugged". Even if you cap your frames at 60, it will continue to ovearheat.
---
OP: Deranking is fine tho.
---
tfw u shitreply a shitreply but it gets downvoted so your shitreply will inevitably get hidden as well
---
i just try to get past the screen as quickly as possible because my console takes off
---
Analyzed it: they're trash players.
---
Lmao what? I never understood what the fuck y‚Äôall on about gen rushing. I never get mad when people ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù
---
They‚Äôre just doing what they‚Äôre supposed to but go off I guess
---
Hey mate this is a ban-able offence. I think you‚Äôre coming with us.
---
Whenever the killer closes the hatch, after the collapse comes into the game all generators get blocked off but whenever the killer closes the hatch the gates are powered, survivors will still have to open the gates but they will be on like all generators have been completed thus giving the survivor a chance to get out but not as easy an escape as the hatch
---
Just add a mori shop like everyone has suggested, easy money BHVR why are you not getting in on this /s
---
&gt;i just try to get past the screen as quickly as possible because my console takes off
---
I cap my frames at 20 while sitting in the menus and try to go past it ASAP as well.
---
Does this go for hook saves as well?
---
Yeah, I can already hear the killer mains complaining about insane lobby times as many of the survivor mains are going to quit playing the game because of this, and then wonder why.
---
My first time playing Trapper was on Haddonfield and I thought he was extremely powerful. Oh boy, that was short lived.
---
The problem is i like standardized games. The ranking system is inherently stupid in the first place. For example: if i get hooked 3 times then a lot has happened by then and i probably pipped anyways. If the killer brought a pink mori, i only get 1 hook and regardless of my skill my game is ending 33% or more for no reason of my own. The killer isnow directly involved in me deranking without any of my skill involved. This isnt league. Its a vary wobbly imbalanced game with a shit ranking system that punishes you for winning to fast on either side. The fact that when up against a baby killer without ruin that i have to force chases and hooks to ensure i pip is fucking stupid. No survivors items and add ons are no where near killers.  Like seriously i wont exaggerate with what i say next. 90% i DC if its 1 shot clown, 1 shot huntress, a slug build, or prayer bead spirit. Those shouldnt even exist period. Why should i sit in a game that only exists 1/30 games. Im not gonna improve, im not gonna pip, im not gonna have fun. Im going to the next game
---
&gt;Sorry if you're having "Glitched or Crashes" but it shouldn't be occurring enough for your to have a abnormally high DC amount.
---
It's actually been *ridiculous* how many games I spawn into where it's a 3 man game because someone got stuck loading. And if it's not that then someone *else* dc's instantly, or I get the stupid wiggle bug, or for some reason the TR is omega loud for some reason to the point where it hurts my ears.
---
I tried for an hour straight yesterday trying to just get a normal ass fucking game and it just never happened. A lot of these are people just being salty and dc'ing but I dc so often because it's a 3 man game or some other dumb shit. They need to fix the god damn game before they start trying to punish people for dc'ing. If they don't I'll just afk under a hook.
---
I mean, it is better then when your teammates leave you on the hook for too long and you die because they were too busy to get you off when you were the only one on Gens.
---
If u find out why let me know cuz I also dont understand the beef with gen rushing.  It's like saying I hate when the killer kills me when they first see me
---
Type of Bug: Visual?
---
Description of Bug: When working on anything that produces a skill check the audio cue will occur that a skill check is coming however the image of the skill check will not appear on the screen, this almost guarantees a failed skill check every single time (unless you luckily guess.) I have no idea how to reproduce these bug

We 100% never saw this posted before.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Actually tho
---
Freedy
---
Like I was playing killer a shit ton today and I got ‚Äúgen rushed‚Äù but that was because I wasn‚Äôt keeping an eye on the generators.  So that‚Äôs my fault. Don‚Äôt know how you can get mad at them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
By that logic going to any hook means you accept the possibility of getting killed, or to push it to a more extreme point, joining a lobby as survivor.
---
I would rather get people out of the game and die myself than leave a team mate on the hook and leave. But as I stated in an above post, I find playing actually fun, and I don‚Äôt find standing still in a spot fun. I‚Äôd also rather my team actually try to altruistic versus Urban Immersioning in a corner and helping no one.
---
However standing in a spot and refusing to let someone leave, even if there is a timer, IMO is a mechanic abuse and shouldn‚Äôt be okay. Maybe you should try seeing it from a solo queue survivor‚Äôs viewpoint, or survivor in general. It prevents one (or numerous) people from playing.
---
I‚Äôll just laugh and block on MLGA until dedicated servers come (assuming they‚Äôre coming and BHVR doesn‚Äôt screw is) so I don‚Äôt have my time wasted. Plus I can just see this being a new depip method killers will use to just annoy survs.
---
sounds about right
---
Contrary to what the report system says, the devs has stated that you shouldn't report DCs because they already have a system checking for that and reporting just gives them redundant information. Therefore they waste more time instead of looking at other reports
---
Well, I don‚Äôt spend too much time on the subreddit if I‚Äôm honest, I just wanted to contribute something every now and then. Sorry if an apparently repetitive screenshot offended you.
---
Both are good, that's why it's kinda hard to choose. I like both of their abilities and they both seems like fun killers to play as
---
It doesn't matter what killer you play. I've gotten 4 dcs with my Freddy this patch.
---
Probably the greatest dbd meme I've ever seen.
---
Dont ever remember them saying that. Also didnt get mentioned recently so we should be good.
---
I can tell. Also I don't have to respond to your stupid, poorly written questions.
---
I think you didn't undersatnd what I said. I know he have a penalty but it is nothing when you compare it with leatherface if you bumped an object. For stopping the chainsaw he only stops for maybe a second but the nurse after her blinks she get a penalty for 2 sec also at this time she isn't able to see clearly. Hillbilly hasn't any of these.
---
niiiiice, that's a amazing feeling
---
Nice work right there bud , loved it :D
---
I love getting out-in-the-open hexes when I play TOTH Spirit
---
Or you know, someone is clearly using speed hacks/says something incredibly racist or sexist.
---
Me me big boy
---
He is so pure
---
Possible editing error? Maybe they included footage of a bug during testing accidentally.
---
uff imagine needing  3 blink and ruin on her when you have legacy.. wtf dude
---
i love when that happens especially when your in tier 3 as michael or any of the two chainsaw killers
---
Two left to go to make P3 killers?
---
i think it increases the sickness gain from interacting with infected objects(ie gens or pallets with puke on them)
---
They ready did, they got matched against a nurse.
---
It'd be a nerf because the fabric wouldn't mask the clapping of their cheeks anymore
---
Well if you don‚Äôt camp, then it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
I would assume it‚Äôs this. I doubt you‚Äôd actually be able to walk up to a gate with 5 gens left as a killer and trigger endgame lol
---
reporting for duty o7
---
(Though i gotta admit, wraith is my fave)
---
well i think they buff other killers because i feel like pretty much every killer should be on the same tier except hillbilly huntress and nurse because i just feel like it would be to hard to balance every killer to be the same in terms of killing potencial
---
This is too fucking real.
---
Yeah I've noticed this too.
---
Also re: head on, it's hard to say because whether or not you hit the killer heavily depends on latency. I have used it and hit killers that are like behind my locker, other times I'll jump out (normally) and like brush against the killer.
---
Dwight would never.
---
(Also delete this shit)
---
didn't you post it already?
---
LOL my two favorite things (DBD and Rick). 
---
"Welcome to the club, pal."
---
You ended your comment with "I'll laugh and block on MLGA" and downvoted. /shrug
---
Sounds like you weren't interested in discussion either. 
---
I see plenty of things from survivor's standpoints, I don't run NOED, I don't camp without seeing someone nearby, I don't tunnel, I don't play BBQ Nurse or Billy, etc. I've lost track of the number of rules I follow to make survivors happy. I also added an edit that did state it would be a problem if killers blocked the stairs pre-timer starting and you ignored that.
---
So don't lay this at my feet, you just basically went full survivor "I deserve to rescue people" and won't take any disagreement on that. Perhaps you should try to see it from a killer facing 4 man squadette PoV...
---
The point of the endgame collapse is to stop survs from holding the game hostage, punishing the killer is not anywhere on their radar.
---
Onk
---
Powered, not opened. The killer‚Äôs just gonna close the hatch and patrol exit gates and it‚Äôll be an automatic gg from there the vast majority of the time.
---
I think how it should work is if someone dcs 2 or 3 times within a 24 hour period then they receive a soft ban. Meaning they get put in a pool of players who also have the soft ban and can only play with each other for a set amount of time. The more soft band you accumulate the longer you have to stay in the soft van pool. So for first offence you stay for a day, second 3 days, third a week, and finally a month for every future soft ban you acquire. If someone dcs once there shouldn‚Äôt be a punishment cause sometimes legitimate things cause you to disconnect.
---
Unless it spawns where I know survivors spawn in, I just start patrolling gens.
---
Just get over it and quit crying. It's not like NOEDS gonna be any more powerful with the end game update. Just open the gate and fuck off. You act like three minutes along with slowed timer when people go down and hooked will cause issues. The devs made it fun for both sides with this because it prevents hatch standoffs and games lasting for fucking ever. Seriously grow up and just respect a decision the devs made to make it fun and more intense for both sides.
---
Just wanted to get my Freddy daily done. Waited 30 minutes to get a group that had two DC right on the first hook. One DC right as I downed them the first time and didn‚Äôt even get to pick them up to hook them and the last jumped out the hatch. 
---
At least I got the daily but damn that was a shit show match.
---
Ouch at that self deprecation at the end :( i know you probably don't believe that 100% , but to hopefully alleviate any traces of it i'll say your artstyle is really gorgeous, it really attracts a person's attention and is very pleasing to look at.
---
I'm not sure why, but it's the same story for rank 15
---
I love running devour hope on trapper with a bloody coil so even if they set off the trap I place in front of it they risk me coming to down them üòÇ
---
If you stopped playing then go away.
---
Entity: \*restores the MacMillan mines\*

Evan: Am I a joke to you?
---
It's funny that survivors who threaten to quit the game are conveniently the same survivors who would not be missed by anybody.
---
Thank you so much, my friend!
---
Thanx 4 this uwu
---
Its the opposite for me :(
---
Really? All the killers I‚Äôve played with lately seem to be trying to kill everyone as quickly as possible and get it over with. It really makes the game not fun sometimes
---
It doesnt matter what killer or what perks,  this happens 4 out of 5 games for me.
---
u're playing nurse, so don't act like a lil bitch...
---
Has something happened? It never used to be quite as bad as it is now. I mean, people are dcing because they get hit, not even downed. Or they get puked on (not even broken) and then dc.
---
Is there some kind of event or knowledge that is making them dc?
---
Survivors dcing really ruins the game for everyone as we all still have to play it when they leave. Killers leaving is a problem too but at the very least, everyone can immediately move on to the next game.
---
I find I do worse in SWF unless it‚Äôs a certain friend. Most of my friends are lower rank and I feel the need to save them or take more risks than if I play on my own. On my own, I usually weigh risks better or trust other team mates to help and I win a lot more often.
---
seems like u're an unskilled killer main, if u have to play nurse. lul
---
Not all of us though üòâüíÉ
---
[https://youtu.be/3XVqeE8m\_JU](https://youtu.be/3XVqeE8m_JU)
---
man, I just finished.
---
!PERSONAL OPINION INCOMING!  
---
Honestly, i just consider NOED to be a statement of a killers skill.
---
Most players i see during games are:
---
1. Noob killers that can't do anything early - mid game so they need to run NOED to get a kill (60-75%)
---
2. Toxic rank 1's that don't know what fun means.
---
But yeah, it IS kinda annoying to have to run around the map searching for the hex totem. MAYBE the devs could let you see it if you were within a certain distance from it, but nerfing it would cause a ton of toxic waste in the forums.
---

---
I‚Äôm going to amuse you with one more reply, simply because I never anywhere implied I deserved to rescue people, or have people rescue me. I also play killers, have been a red rank surv and killer for numerous months, and as much as killers complain about 4man Squadettes, I personally have never seen one. I‚Äôve seen *tons* of 4 man SWF flashlights, all with BT, Adren, DS (pre-nerf), but let‚Äôs apply some logic from earlier. You see that in your lobby, kill the lobby. Don‚Äôt let the lobby go into a game.
---
But yes, I chose to downvote because while you chose to say you could see it if they killer forced survs to start end game to leave and had been blocking for a while, you still chose to say that blocking during end game isn‚Äôt toxic or bullshit or whatever you want to call it. I also disagreed with most of the points you made, because the vast majority of it comes off with the undertone of ‚ÄúSurvivor OP, please nerf.‚Äù
---
And as an aside, if survivors taking hits to try to let someone wiggle is that much of a pain for you, Iron Grasp + Mad Grit. I‚Äôve never seen a problem with survs taking hits -leaves numerous people in the injured state, applies pressure to more survs, gives everyone a few extra BPs. But I‚Äôve also never seen a problem with flashlights. Doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt run across killers that face camped because I flashlight saved someone and said that flashlights are ‚Äúan abused, bullshit mechanic and should be removed from the game,‚Äù and I‚Äôve had killers rant about ‚ÄúSWF OP‚Äù when really it was a bunch of rando survs that were all on the same wave length that game.
---
Ultimately, it‚Äôs the concept of being able to play the game is my primary concern with end game and the basement.  I shouldn‚Äôt be stuck basically AFKing for somewhere within a 3 minute timer because a killer is upset/grouchy/‚Äúplaying strategically‚Äù/scummy/whathaveyou. That is ultimately where the problem lies. It‚Äôs more of a game design that can be abused by players that I have a problem with versus the overall concept itself.
---
Yea that's so good. Hatch trade was so unfun as a killer

I see your point. I'm mid rank killer myself and I dont use NOED. For me it i get a shit game it's a shit game I shrug it off and move onto the next and try and perfect my mistakes. Was it my build? Was it how I played? Etc. It just pisses me off with how much the devs try and do to appease people and you still get asswipes like above that do nothing but hold disrespect for them.
---
Doesn‚Äôt this kind of encourage you to kill your teammates
---
Send in a ticket to ban this guy. Mods are gonna remove this for Witch-Hunting.
---
Glad to hear other people are experiencing this issue. It happened 3 games in a row today, I eventually stopped playing because I was sick of wasting my offerings and losing rank. It's strange because it's happening a lot more all of the sudden.
---
We already have to deal with all the ragequitters, we don't need to have people getting DC'ed against their will as well. Hopefully they're gonna fix that soon, because the game is gonna be unplayable otherwise.
---
I won a match last night where only 1 other survivor got out. This other guy was like gg ez to the killer and accused them of tunneling I was like ??? Dude I‚Äôm the only one who didn‚Äôt get hooked, you died. How is that ez.

Indeed, even if I didn't care if they got it, some survivors would take 5+ minutes to find it while I was basically afk waiting for it to end...lol.

This is some fucking good shit OP!
---
So you want to wait way longer in lobbies? Game would be dead if all dc ppl got banned at once. Almost every match has at least 1 dc, think about what you wish for...
---
If people loop between jungle gyms and pallets they can either lose the killer or waste enough time to make it bad for him. Sometimes even taking a hit is a good idea, to get that extra distance and run away to an even farther set of pallets. Sure sometimes the map isn‚Äôt on your side when it comes to placement, but most of the time if you‚Äôre being chased first you create the advantage for your team.
---
I swear I can only hit great skill checks every time when there is ruin, when there isn‚Äôt I just fuck up skill checks when i even try to go for a great one
---
survivors are able to see the timer...
---
it was honestly a mistake tying BT and Legion's power to the same mechanic. should have just left BT alone how it was
---
From what I interpreted in the video at least one generator has to be powered. 
---
Opening it yourself can force immersed survivors who are hiding and not doing gents to scurry out of hiding or early trigger your own NOED/Blood Warden. 
---
You can use a key if the killer closes it but it can only be reopened with a key after that. 
---
Blood Warden was stated to be getting an overview and possible rework, so we can‚Äôt for sure say it will or won‚Äôt be powerful.
---
Why this isn‚Äôt an official game mode I don‚Äôt know, coop killers anymore like be amazing, vs 6-8 survivors.
---
I do not think it will cause more as long as the killer is not allowed to open the gates until the last gen is done. if he could do it at the start of the match that would be pretty stupid lol
---
Well I'm still struggling using A and D, so I don't know what you're talking about
---
Ricky Gervais killer/Karl Pilkington survivor chapter when?
---
Ok and hillbilly's chainsaw can go unlimited until you stop it and leather face goes back and fourth until he stops they're two different killers. Stop crying about 1 particular character and get good.
---
This sub has really stripped that word of all meaning
---
Along similar lines I‚Äôve been getting disconnected from games. From my perspective it looks like the killer rage quit. But I doubt it‚Äôs every time because the match was going in their favor.  It never happened until the Legion update
---
INCONSIVABLE!!
---
how can billy guard an open exit gate
---
You can't make exceptions. Unless there's a technical reason behind it, you shouldn't be DCing over gameplay you disagree with; you're just reinforcing the problem.
---
The whole thing seems very killer sided on an already very killer sided game. I'm sure there will be more dcs at the start but we should keep an open mind until we try it.
---
I made this right after seeing this exact same post with Mass Effect's Legion!
---
This is from Fire Emblem, and he's a precious brute
---
(allses of us)
---
theres a lot of killers who need an extra buff because none of the other killers are really a threat against good survivors except at least the top 5
---
Charge time of a chainsaw is 2.5 seconds with no addons. Apparently Bubba's chainsaw is a 2.1 second charge time.
---
(Getting this info from the wiki btw)
---
Time to break a pallet is around 2.6 seconds without perks.
---
( [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/703zzc/fyi\_the\_new\_time\_to\_break\_pallets\_with\_brutal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/703zzc/fyi_the_new_time_to_break_pallets_with_brutal/) )
---
As well you can charge your chainsaw while you move towards a pallet and while your movement speed does decrease its usually a bit faster. Also you are much harder to blind when breaking pallets with the chainsaws as you can look up in the air and have a very quick animation of breaking the pallet.
---
Chainsawing is a better method to breaking pallets even without addons. Equipping brutal strength on either of these killers is a little counterproductive as such. 
---
You can also try and mindgame a survivor by pretending to break a pallet with the saw then using it to try and down them instead. So by only chainsawing pallets you can create an expected outcome that you can subvert at a later point.
---
You underestimate the power of sandbagging
---
The hatch doesn't appear until a certain number of gens are done.  It's always +1 gens compared to how many survivors are alive.  If 2 survivors are alive,  3 gens have to be completed in order for the hatch to appear.  1 survivor alive needs 2 gens completed and so on.
---
It's an exploit. It's bannable
---
"what's this asshole want from me?"
---
*BOOM*

"Oh.."

"im the greatest survivor ever, look how long im looping the killer" - survivor after throwing down the 20th pallet in a single chase
---
Obviously. Lol
---
Yeah i'm pretty mutch like you mate. I'm a rank \~10 killer AND surv and i just find NOED **HELLA** annoying bcz when i play surv it's usually survive with friends.... and i'm not that mutch of a monster to just leave my friends behind. so i just refuse to use NOED, and just try to get better at the game instead lmao
---
no because we havent even tried the changes yet so your meme is wrong.
---
There needs to be a harsher punishment system... unfortunately, I don't think this will happen until rank has some tangible meaning attached to it to further deter survivors from DCing at their convenience.
---
I usually give nice treatment to people who didn't really have a good time but I also have some biases
---
It's spreading to PC. We better get the bug spray or it'll spread to switch!
---
Was the pig playing on Haddonfield &amp; had kind of retro editing to it? If so then that was a Generator Jake video &amp; I do not believe anyone has reposted his videos on youtube yet.
---
You can still go retrieve the trap if you want to.
---
Now, if you *don't* want to waste 40 seconds going to the opposite side of the map to retrieve a bear trap, you can just keep playing normally.
---
But how big is the pillow?
---
your ping might suck
---
I see you too continue to reddit while having a migraine. Not gonna lie, I have put on sunglasses so I could keep looking at my computer screen without hurting my eyes. Usually I find caffeine helps as well. My go-to is Excedrin.

96 bottles of legiontears on the wall, 96 bottles of legiontears. Take one down, pass it around, 95 bottles of legiontears on the wall.
---
Punishing won't help.  Instead just add rewards for staying the entire game.  Extra bloodpoints or extra shards or something.
---
The thing is though I've actually gotten No Mither and MoM to work as long as I bring in DS.
---
Yes! That's it and dang itttt :( thanks though. Guess I'll suffer haha
---
Entity is a spider. I would stay away from bug spray or we may have more glitches released in retaliation
---
Kitty skin is the best imo
---
I've been addicted to this game since it was free in PS+ There's just nothing else like it
---
Yes. Check Dave Richard's twitter. He mentioned a rework for all end game perks.
---
What would be nurse and doctors ults?
---
I dont want to tell artists they shouldn't draw something but does the world REALLY need nsfw dbd art?
---
You can tell by what they said there gonna do to him in the upcoming ptb that it‚Äôs not good, but it is just a meme
---
I know Survivor Mains are going to object  entirely, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm playing Spirit right now and chanced a game with 2 Toolboxes. By the time I even hit the first person, 2 Gens were already done.  
---
I feel like whenever I play Killer I‚Äôm basically always either doing End-Game Builds or the 3-Gen Strat, because it feels like the only viable way to win anymore. Unless you‚Äôre playing someone with good Map pressure, have fun chasing one person while three Gens pop.
---
Hell, add in trapper and hag too since they can make it next to impossible to open the door without giving away you‚Äôre there
---
it's all i can - dark theme Reddit, absolute minimum phone screen brightness with reading mode, tears and trying to not think of pain by replying, arguing and shittalking. 
---
caffeine doesn't help with hormonal migraines, only vascular :c the one i have right now is hormonal, unfortunately, no pill or method helps, will have to endure till periods over.
---
I'm really surprised they don't have a trapper body pillow. 
---
Or more importantly a Clown body pillow.
---
yes and sides of houses with tall grass
---
I imagine it says Oink. Correct me if I'm wrong
---
i got heavily spanked about a week ago.  i was still in the process of coming back to the game and on top of that using plague.  so i'm rusty i know i'm not going to do well.
---
well my 2nd game of the night i ran into a swf that i didnt even see.  generators popped one after another and i didnt see or hit a single person.  they al bounced.  sent me a msg after.  I fully expected shit talk.  nah the dude just said hey sorry we had to do that to you we got some achievement i dont remember the name of.  
---
i wasnt even mad about that loss cause i couldnt do anything.  but it was still nice to see a positive message.
---
(gulies theme starts playing) and then the killer gets his face slammed by a pallet
---
I mean... it is
---
Just like it was in cod back in the day 
---
It works more often than not
---
I tested it myself yesterday with a meme leatherface build... you‚Äôd be shocked how many kills and points I got from just staring at them in a corner.  I didn‚Äôt pip much, but I did get some bp and many kills (usually 3k with last person getting hatch)
---
the oldest trick in the book

OHMYGOSH THAT GAVE ME THE OOKIE SPOOKS
---
You cannot deny he's gotta be beefy as hell tho. He just casually picks up anyone with one hand and tosses them to the side like they weigh nothing
---
You're so mad responding to a post a wrote 23+ hours ago that wasn't even addressed to you lol.
---
You just want someone to argue with . 
---
I'm brain-dead but you can't structure a simple sentence.

Dwight Romero:

Thought of that after posting, but maybe less is more.  Thanks.
---
oh wow. i'll try that, thank you.
---
damn, never even thought about it, i'm dumb.

and i hope you don't live in a part of the world where one day it's -10 C in the morning and next day +8 C D:

A lot of the issues people have with camping is not that it works, it's that it isn't fun for anyone involved. Imagine a horror movie where the villain just stays in one spot instead of chasing the characters around. Not really a thriller if you ask me :/

Hey [B]eter

servs u right... plays broken killer, cries on reddit, why games aren't fun and survivors dc...

TOXIC :)

I would cut a whole in the back of it, I could spoon it and fork it at the same time.

Oh that! No, struggling is still Space and skillchecks/items (instaheal, etc.) are Mouse 3.

S-A-M-E
---
Vommy mommy
---
As of the next update, yes. Check out the End Game Collapse post at the top of the sub.
---
Well that doesn‚Äôt include all grabs. There are 2 animations. Key opening and jumping.
---
shaming others on this subreddit isn't allowed, you're shaming the people who dc btw.
---
**Hard Bail -** sounds interesting and really useful for new players, but In my opinion, it should affect only the perk holder
---
**Low Profile -** It'd be very good if it didn't leave any notification that you got off the hook and the Killer had to look at the tab for that information
---
**Bounce Back -** Sounds like a *very* strong version of Solidarity and the effect could apply at and spend 3 tokens, since gaining tokens is already easier thanks to increased speed of picking Survivors up from the dying state
---
Good job with the concept, and one more question: how have you made the graphics?
---
I‚Äôve seen this once as killer but eventually it let me leave after another 3-5 minutes of sitting alone in the map.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think of this!!! Omg I‚Äôm so happy I want the pig to be good so bad
---
blood warden tier 4
---
although it just gives you the opportunity to save your shards
---
It's not that bad here. I used to live up in Canada, but my family moved down to North Carolina when I was a kid. Good luck, feel better soon!
---
Thank you, my friend. What kind of nsfw stuff do you like? Shirtless Myers?
---
Not all. There are 2 grabs. Jumping in AND opening the hatch are 2 different animations.
---
Still 11/10 meme
---
Daddy David is gonna see unthinkable things...
---
I only tunnel because it makes survivors piss and moan, and there's literally nothing they can do about it. So keep on being uos t over it. Kthx
---
I've never made a claim that it doesn't.
---
Don‚Äôt hit them. Wait till they open it and grab them during the ‚Äúopen‚Äù animation.
---
thank you&lt;3
---
It's ok entity I just wanna watch David wiggle too.
---
oh fuck I just realized body blocking is fucking BEAST in end game now
---
*disconnects*
---
Yeah. The video is already a little bit old so back then i didnt know how to get the original video on my phone. So i just recorded it with it
---
Some areas are only accessible through windows, if the trapper traps said windows, the survivors can't access that window without stepping in a trap. The trap can't be disarmed if it's on the other side of the window.
---
‚ÄúBecause fuck your bbq stack pussy!‚Äù -Toxic survivor
---
Uwee hee hee!
---
New endgame collapse looks to be working. Free kills, for all. üòÇ
---
I'll try to elaborate on the other comments a bit. The grass goes all the way up the sides of the houses. Hiding a trap there makes it very difficult to see, and the survivor will have to crouch walk all the way up if they take that path. This can cut off huge sections of the map during a chase.  
---
This map also has few pallets, but to make up for it there are strong loops. There are very long fences that can be looped for a long time before exiting to a safe pallet. If you trap these loops it forces them off it onto weaker ones, and/or makes them drop a very strong pallet early. This gets rid of the survivors strongest advantage on Haddonfield. Even if they notice the trap, there isn't an option to go around it, so they will have to take a hit and try to run the other direction.
---
I think you've all focused too much on the realm-sharing aspect of this post, I wanted to highlight the fact that the Plague had been shafted, more than Leatherface and Clown. But that was only the latter half of the argument, the former half being that since the game has come out, no killer has added more than one map variety to the game. 
---
&gt; Then they started adding killers, and with each killer came a new realm. Problem was, nearly every new realm only came with one variety, meaning that you are very unlikely to play on them during any given play session. The original three had fifteen potential maps for you to play in. And how many were added in dlc? 12. 
---
For the record, 55% of the maps in the game are from the original 3 realms.
---
Part of the intention of this post being that we're basically stuck with the first 15 maps and seldom ever see any of the other realms. This isn't helped by the fact that certain maps are god-like for some killers, (The Doctor on the Game) and others are practically unusable for other killers. (The Hillbilly on L√©ry's) whereas the first 15 maps are generally pretty balanced for all killers, even now. 
---
Realm-sharing was more or less a footnote for Leatherface and Clown. And with Plague's simply being a step too far in terms of visual clash. The other part of the argument was the fact that, again, Realms are hardly being used and experimented with, and are instead just being added with a single, solitary map variety.
---
Let's break this down for clarity:
---
**MacMillan Estate:**
---
Coal Tower, Groaning Storehouse, Ironworks of Misery, Shelter Woods, Suffocation Pit.
---
**Autohaven Wreckers:**
---
Azarov's Resting Place, Blood Lodge, Gas Heaven, Wretched Shop, Wrecker's Yard.
---
**Coldwind Farm:**
---
Fractured Cowshed, Rotten Fields, Torment Creak, Rancid Abattoir, The Thomson House.
---
These were the original 15, and anyone who's played this game knows that these maps are very unique, even though they all share realms with each other, and provide good, general-focused gameplay to Dead By Daylight.
---
Now let's get to the addons that came afterward:  
---
**Chapter I: The Last Breath:**  
---
Added the realm *Crotus Prenn Asylum* with one variety: The Disturbed Ward.
---
**Chapter II: HALLOWEEN**¬Æ**:**
---
Added the realm *Haddonfield* with one variety: Lampkin Lane.
---
**Chapter III: Of Flesh and Mud:**
---
Added the realm *Backwater Swamp* with one variety: The Pale Rose.
---
**Chapter IV: Spark of Madness**
---
Added the realm *L√©ry's Memorial Institute* with one variety: Treatment Theatre.
---
**Chapter V: A Lullaby For The Dark**
---
Added the realm *The Red Forest* with one variety: Mother's Dwelling.
---
**PARAGRAPH II: LEATHERFACE**
---
Added one variety to *The Backwater Swamp:* Grim Pantry.
---
**Chapter VI: A Nightmare on Elm Street**
---
Added the realm *Springwood* with one variety: Badham Preschool.
---
**Chapter VII: SAW**‚Ñ¢
---
Added the realm *Gideon Meat Plant* with one variety: The Game.
---
**Chapter VIII: Curtain Call**
---
Added one variety to *Crotus Prenn Asylum*: Father Campbell's Chapel.
---
**Chapter IX: Shatter Bloodline**
---
Added the realm *Yamoaka Family Estate* with one variety: Family Residence.
---
**Chapter X: Darkness Among Us**
---
Added the realm *Ormond* with one variety: Mount Ormond Resort.
---
**Chapter XI: Demise of the Faithful**
---
Added one variety to *The Red Forest:* Temple of Purgation.
---
Are you noticing a pattern? Not a single killer has contributed more than one map to the game, with some realms barely holding two maps, thanks only to additions that were patched in with new chapters. I was hoping that this would be part of the discussion but it seems I've focused too much on the realm-sharing aspect of this argument.
---
except dodging lobbies dont ruin games for anyone else sooo no
---
Oh idk how I feel about this. Kind of cool but Idk
---
*braces for downvotes* Ormond and temple are my favorite maps aestheticially.
---
I agree as far as swf but not solo. Solo survivors don't stand a chance at the moment which is pushing people to look for swf teams. You can see people asking about it in forums and various discord servers
---
Playing spirit with one hit by the time 2 gens were done? You are a baby spirit. Just run Ruin, Haunted, Barbecue, Sloppy. You‚Äôll quit playing the game once you learn the build because its a 4k no matter what build. Never lost with it.
---
I suppose its the minor impact of having different survivors that have tactical advantages &amp; disadvantages.
---
For killers, Claudette is the bane of their existence as its really hard to see her due to her physical appearance not contrasting well with many of the environments of dbd. P3 Claudettes are basically invisible in maps like the Swamp.
---
I won't settle for anything above 100 ping. Hit boxes are already bad as they are
---
you should have made the claudogs face with brown skin
---
At the end of the video he gets into a game and all the survivors DC after seeing the triple blink. I think that's what he is referring too.
---
The people who bitch about "gen rushing" are the same trash tier boosted loser that also bitch about "tunneling", they're all the same, and they all get what they deserve.
---
So remove SWF. Seems easiest, it would get rid of a lot of toxic players
---
Which are only reserved for maximum SWF flashlight face burners.
---
Where is Shirtless Myers?
---
Not to mention the killer imbalance of maps like L√©ry's and Haddonfield. If we had more varieties on realms like that, we could see different designs that would give us enjoyable varieties of these admittedly unique settings.
---
also they did the same old basic bitch map design of "alright lets put in a central safe structure in the middle of the map"
---
Everyone in the comments say " ITS YOUR BUILD THATS MAKING THEM QUIT REEEEEEE" (its a joke pls no downvote), but ironically,  nurse is usually an easy clap for me, mainly because I play unpredictable with weird perks(insert not like other girls meme), any slow killers are an easy clap tbh, so Im not saying its fully just toxic people, but stop blaming the build so much
---
Lmao right. I had a good totem spot once and some people cant handle ruin so it was a blood bath. The entity must have been extra giving that day
---
ah shit really? my bad, it always worked for me so I didn't expect it to be otherwise.
---
Well it is really annoying to play against the same killer for hundred times because he can easily get 4k.
---
But it's only one picture
---
Is this real cause shit I am interested
---
3 blink nurse broken? Behaviour should make a mode for people like you where its only 4 survivors and no killer, they just finish gens activate gate and escape.
---
People do anyway, both killers and survivors. People rarely make sense
---
I disagree with your disagreement lol
---
As a solo myself, I notice a nice rate of winning (not easily, but very winnable) against most all killers
---
Win some, lose some.  It‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be (not sure what rank you are, but high levels, it‚Äôs been my experience) 
---
Swf on the other hand, we usually escape much more often than die. 
---
I just think people want easier time as survivor, but should it really be? (Based on the concert of the game and all, we should survive a brutal killer)
---
I'll need something more creative than "a person running" for my perk icons as I'm doing a Killer concept whose perks have nothing towards running. If you didn't mind giving me further information with the graphics side of it (because I suck at it), I'd be grateful. In-depth things I want to know: how hard and time-taking is it to make a completely unique perk icon (where you can't find a base for it in the internet)? And how I get this "teachable perk" window? Thanks in advance for your help!
---
The same happened to me! But on PC. Heartbeat sound would start up randomly and VERY loud music would play but I wouldn‚Äôt hear the killer when they were right next to me. No perks of that kind either. Ive heard of similar bugs so I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt happen again.
---
Hahahahahaha i am mad ok you made me laugh ty for that, i just Like to argue with braindead people, because whatever they say makes me laugh, because you are braindead and you try to talk, its funny watching you try talking. Anyway still no answer to my questions, like i said your brain is dead.
---
He said ‚ÄúIght bro,ima bout to head out‚Äù
---
Just skip the first panel
---
It is real shit- straight from the official account for DBD
---
Open exit gate only otherwise you're trash for doing it.
---
I'll bet this is the first thing to be out of stock on this new store.
---
Perhaps something to make it easier to navigate, as if you're the last one around when the killer finds you, and extra health state probably won't help, especially if you were already full.
---
If you are the last person remaining in the trial, you will leave no scratch marks. Then all the blood-point stuff is the same.
---
how is it worthless it entirely counters half his power lol
---
UwU twanks fow di compwiment
---
There's really no point to going to your totem at the start anyway. If someone's already on your totem, chances are the whole team knows about it by this point with how common SWF is. Once they're aware of the totem, it's pretty much a lost cause to protect.
---
He looks like he has webbed fingers.
---
Fookin' A
---
love the title lmao
---
shhhh, dont burst their bubble
---
Whenever the End Game Collapse starts, the rest of the generators are blocked. Basically:
---
* Survivors power five generators: End Game starts, generators get blocked off.
---
* Killer closes hatch: Gates are powered, End Game starts, generators are blocked off.
---
Fuck you Danny
---
That used to be me. Now I make sure I get ample looping time per pallet.
---
I have 4000 escapes
---
Franklin's demise is a great perk.
---
No
---
Let‚Äôs say for example:
---
Swf 4/3-man 
---
They constantly hook rush together soon as you hook someone and walk about 2 feet
---
Are you telling me to just run across the map and ignore it?
---
Also, like I said before, most survivors are the real trash, because camping works more often then not 
---
I‚Äôve never understood when someone loses to someone else and the winner is considered ‚Äútrash‚Äù or bad lol. Unfun? yes, bad? No
---
you can blame DS 2.0 for that (mettle of man)
---
Unless you're playing Nurse, Spirit or Billy the game is much harder for killer.
---
That‚Äôs the one.....
---
Not arguing that lol
---
It worked very well in that game. And people would be reckless trying to get revenge, so they would die 10 times before maybe getting that one kill lol
---
wait im confused how exactly does that addon work now
---
It's a shame isn't it. How dare the Pig have a method of applying pressure during the end game only available to her. Can't have that can't we?  Nope. A hatch, two damn exit doors, and 3-6 minutes to escape is too much.. gotta nerf the Pig to be on the safe side of ensuring as many escapes as possible.
---
Except they can only do that if they can predict you properly. No matter how many blinks they have, a shitty Nurse can and will be outplayed by any survivor that's smarter than a brick
---
"Just testing btw" fuck off.
---
Rank?
---
Butt rubs!
---
Okay that example is so pants shittingly poor play on the survivors I suppose that would be an example of survivor-caused camping if they are literally swarming the hook like cockroaches the moment the animation finishes.  Short of those examples though camping is for unskilled trash that has ran out of ideas.
---
You're bad because literally a rank 20 in their first game ever is capable of camping a survivor to death on hook 1.  It is completely devoid of skill and that kill you "earned" is more or less a participation trophy.  And yes it makes you quite bad if that's how you have to approach the game to get a kill.
---
Yea on m1 killers you are at a decent disadvantage against competent survivors without ruin. Gotta play really efficient otherwise to do well
---
That lipsync is now one of the greats for me, it was so fucking even!
---
Lol ok
---
How can you quote something that I didn‚Äôt say?
---
What I said was ‚Äú I tested it‚Äù
---
And as a matter of FACT, I did...
---
I had 2 survivor puddings on leatherdaddy and decided to meme it up with insidious and a basement build
---
It worked extremely well, it was almost sad.
---
He guys you know that one killer who is kind of weak and who has a power that doesn't stress survivors at all?
---
YEs, why you ask?
---
Wanna nerf her?
---
HELL YES!
---
\-Sad Oinking-
---
Anyone who says this I know are either new or bad.
---
You never ever want two survivors caught in the same area. That's immediate game over if the killer takes advantage of it, because they can defend them both at the same time. The guy on the ground had to crawl away in that circumstance, force the killer to create an opening for one of them. Most likely though, he just sat there and got mad at the killer for not picking him up or pointlessly roaming like he's *supposed to*.
---
He's a survivor main who feels he and his friends are all entitled to escape and the killer should have zero way to guarantee their goal.
---
Same niggr
---
Of course not all grabs, but according this tweet from the Creative Director it seems like any hatch interaction besides closing it is gone. Otherwise we'd be right back at square one with hatch standoffs when a key is in play. 
---
https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118910098267672576?s=09
---
Killers dodging lobbies doesn't make you lose offerings, items and rank.
---
Easy as that.
---
I‚Äôve actually really started to like him now that I have decent perks for him. Just have to be very selective about when you use his power.
---
Entity blessed him
---
I think I know simple yet effective power, allow him to enter lockers, when hes inside a locker, he has the ability to teleport to any other locker on the map, and exit that locker
---
Ya I had a game with some friends recently against a wraith, everything is fine, one gen done for two hooks so its looking good. Three of us disconnect instantly leaving one friend behind. Wtf? Why does this happen, also have plenty of games where someone just randomly dc‚Äôs for no reason
---
I cant make exceptions? says the fuck who bro
---
"I don't consider new content to be new content."
---
Okay.
---
Game needs more mechanics like this
---
The only killers that are OP are the top 3 for solo queues, the rest can easily be looped by a good player, and until they address SWF, if they nerf top tier killers, they're just going to make survivor queues worse.
---
do you see his eyes?
---
I don t said that his add-ons weren t good. I think 3 blink + range might be better even than 2 blinks with maximum range, but a lot of people say that good Nurses don t need more than 2 blinks, so Omega Blink is her most powerful combo. The idea is, people throught that he used the add-ons for Omega Blink Nurse, but that s not true, Omega Blink isn t when you use 3+ blinks, is when you use maximum range.
---
&gt; Bruh if you can't find a bleeding survivor that is in your terror radius, moaning and bleeding all over the floor, I think that's on you.
---
Distressing and Iron Will are both perks...
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with this buff, but it is DEFINITELY a buff and not just a way to get rid of moonwalking.
---
as a survivor main who has never even played killer, I am very excited about this new add on. This makes the game so much better.
---
Slap on a NOED and drink anytime someone DCs
---
If it's a nurse like the one above I'll just die on hook and move on.
---
Nurse is busted OP- it's a waste of survivor time to try to play most of the time. It's also not fun for survivors most of the time.
---
All the gens need to be powered. For whatever reason, they foolishly put something in the video that was only done for testing (collapse starting with 4 gens/4 survivors). This was said by a dev
---
Finally I can sleep with my Daddy David everynight
---
But you‚Äôre still ignoring the fact that it works...
---
You can emotionally state your opinion on how you hate camping all day long. But it works more often then not. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure where this conversation is going exactly? I keep stating this point, and everyone ignores it to say how campers are bad and whatever... 
---
I‚Äôm just stating the truth here
---
-camping is a strategy (unfun and shitty or not)
---
-it does work more than it should (so not exactly bad)
---
-survivors on average are more shit at the game considering how well it does actually work most of the time 
---
-skill level doesn‚Äôt equal good or bad strategies... so not sure why bring that up lol, it‚Äôs a game, not the Olympics 
---
Keep in mind, I play survivor more than I do killer...  in fact, I swf a lot. I‚Äôm just telling you my experiences.   
---
Also, people are starting to come at me for being a camper...  no, I played 2 games yesterday as leatherface with a meme basement build lol, I‚Äôve never camped like that before (other than my first few games ever as killer years ago) because I personally, don‚Äôt find it as fun, UNLESS people are over altruistic, then I will pretend to leave and immediately come back to smash that ass
---
Rad
---
I refuse to DC I will stare my killer down on the hook like the little bitch I am lol
---
Pretty big buff for killers
---
I approve of this idea.
---
I imagine there's going to be some kind of adjustment, yeah. Honestly I love Pig but she needs a mild rework, so if what they do to accommodate endgame collapse gets me something to make her more viable before the endgame I'll still be thrilled. 
---
Being able to close the hatch though, now that alone is going to make endgame more fun with her traps.
---
You can do that yourself in the options menu
---
thats what enduring is for
---
What's sad is that you justify camping by pretending you are doing "research' again fuck off.
---
It even happens with the non-licensed killers. Monitor and Abuse is terrible for most docs, and might only be worse for like two other killers.
---
thats smart, but risky, because it relies on prediction
---
no beard no buy
---
I mean we're about to get the entity just ending people itself, if a survivor is going to break "its" rules and attempt an early escape why wouldnt they just die on the spot if out of bounds?
---
Everyone here wants myres but sadly they probably can‚Äôt get the rights to sell body pillows of a fictional serial killer. So let‚Äôs hope meg or Kate will be the next.
---
"memes" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Doesn't this contradict Rule#88876240984388323328, Subsection 17, Paragraph 8 starting on line 69?
---
Whats this format called? i cant find it anywhere.
---
Had to do a double take at the title of this post
---
Yes. I can't stand the thought of wasting bloodpoints on a 50+ web knowing that someday I'll have to prestige if I want the cosmetics.
---
Even on killers that I don't use the bloody cosmetics for, I need to know that I have them.
---
My usual tactic is save 90k bloodpoints (I don't save to 1 mill because I don't want to waste any due to the cap.), prep my rituals, then rush the killer's web to 50 when they come out, only caring about perks and never addons. Then I save up again before prestiging them. If I'm really impatient and they don't have BBQ, then I might prestige them early. After p3 i focus on getting the items and perks I need, then I don't stop leveling them until they have BBQ3, which takes a long time sometimes. (I already had almost all perks on myers before finding bbq for him.)
---
Honestly, I wish I never started doing this, I don't think the cosmetics and slightly improved bloodwebs are worth the time it's taken, I shoulda just left everyone p0 and gotten all perks. But I already have everyone P3, and I'm not gonna stop doing it with new killers.
---
For survivor though, I'm just getting all perks on p0 david, then leveling everyone else to 40. Maybe one day I'll full prestige Adam and switch to him, then start on all the rest, but that's not coming until all my killers have every perk, and probably still not after that.
---
I will still never understand why some Survivors just dip as soon as the lobby fills up.
---
I know right? To be honest I think these changes will be good. It's kind of like huntress how if they can catch you in the right spot it could be a near insta-down. I don't think legion will be top tier but I don't believe they will be as bad as current Freddy.
---
no it isnt lol
---
Stop!
---
Ban Hammer time!
---
You forget about the **"Alpha One Teabag Protocol Exception"**, listed clearly in between rules #849782394792837423 and #849782394792837424 that resolves this exact discrepancy. Smh keep talking stupid and I might suspect you of being a killer main
---
Slow release toxin
---
I feel like there needs to be a DC symbol on that pic
---
But... I never justified camping lol
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre so emotional about the game, must suck to be so angry all the time? Keep trying, I will keep trying myself to explain this better for you
---
what I‚Äôm saying:
---
-The original post was about camping not being a strategy, when in FACT, it is a strategy (which I‚Äôve stated many times, isn‚Äôt fun and may be considered shitty) 
---
-I‚Äôm only stating experience (from 2 games as leatherface and most of the time, me playing survivor) 
---
- camping works more often than not, not saying that‚Äôs good and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad. Just saying what it is
---
-camping isn‚Äôt a bad strategy, for the simple fact it works against many teams and survivors... (once again though, not saying it‚Äôs fun or it‚Äôs a good thing)
---
Now this is some quality legal jiu jitsu
---
Congratulations, you're still alive, most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not anymore.
---
Should have been my title
---
Killer main? Me? Never...hahahaha....OINK
---
Good suggestion. I mean the perk is meant to tell you when a totem is being touched. If my brain gave me the notification to pee that was the same notification to know when my phone was ringing i would be pretty annoyed
---
Stopped playing a year ago, but still accidentally cosplaying as Legion to this day.

---
You either play on console or not playing against any actually good nurses. Though to be fair, there aren't that many good nurses; the problem is often that even if you can juke a nurse, your team just get instadowned and then good luck repairing on your own.

I like the idea of toying with ‚ÄúDarkness Among Us‚Äù and how Frank brought out the darkness within his friends. Great work!

No beard=No buy

REPORT THAT SOM' BITCH
---
Its random it shows up just like regular perks
---
it should also show you the aura of the hatch as it appears
---
I see you are also a man of culture and got clown P3. Salutations friend.
---
Oh fr, thanks
---
this \^
---
And another question, is NOED a random perk?
---
Ah I see, yeah that makes sense then
---
Myers next or we riot.
---
Survivors: ‚Äúlmao killers are so toxic‚Äù
---
Also survivors : *reports killers for using addons they don‚Äôt like*
---
Let‚Äôs just jump into it

no, you cannot.
---
It was said on Twitter yesterday by the Creative Director:
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1118909005643112448
---
What did the killer say after?
---
Doctor is D-tier at best. On par with legion. He needs buffs in several areas.
---
Baby killer or not, if you don't run ruin and you're  not playing a killer with large map pressure it's incredibly easy for 2 gens to pop by the time you down them, between how survivors have learned to keep tight loops, the number of safe loops on just about any given map and just how easy it is to spot gens to hop on to, it makes for a very hard time keeping gens up and you can forget about your gatekeeper emblem if you don't have ruin.
---
Give it time...
---
Nothing, Claudette chewed her out for not DC‚Äôing. I tried to say it‚Äôs not fair to be mad at her but she left shortly after.
---
Yes, it does not need to be unlocked
---
&gt; runs 3 blinks, ruin, and myc
---
&gt; has the guts to complain about survivors leaving their lobby
---
For real. Seems like it happens every third game, as soon as it's downed, and it'd be the easiest thing to find and punish.
---
[Original shirtless myers image source](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9myjk6/shirtless_myers/)
---
It's not add-ons that he doesn't like, these add-ons used together cause an exploit that make mend times reach upwards of 5 minutes.
---
How are you the first one to do this? lmao props to you
---
Yeah she's one of the few killers I have P3 with all perks on. Contrary to mainstream belief you can actually do very well on her, but you have to really know what you're doing. One would do quite a bit better on other killers with the same time investment.
---
Don't use noed.
---
Not in-game music
---
I once used insidious as leatherface, I can tell you I get why people do it, its really exciting sitting there waiting to surprise the fuck outta someone, you feel like you're doing something forbidden and taboo, idk, it feels different than normal gameplay. doing it over and over again probably would get boring fast though.
---
LEAVE MY BOY ALONE
---
Why the downvotes? They speak the truth
---
The bar is prolly so survivors know when they should just get out so they don‚Äôt die when going to unhook a player
---
I remember seeing 72hrs doing this, I wonder if that bug is back?
---
Good way to put it lol
---
It's a bit silly that WGLF actually does nothing other than giving bloodpoints.
---
dbd isnt a team game its a battle royale, he wanted hatch smh
---
Those add-ons are bugged genius
---
I got flamed hard last night for using my insta down hatchet.  Jokes on me though because I was saving them up and only wanted to use 1, I used 6 before I realized it just automatically replaces them when they disappear, :(
---
Spirit is op once you learn her. If you aren‚Äôt doing well with her you‚Äôre not playing her right.
---
Ill take your whole stock
---
Boo fucking hoo
---
Well I think you should keep doing that! (Only if you want to though) you‚Äôre pretty good at it.
---
Hey, that was literally me, I remember your name lmao.
---
I thought it was Legion's Never Sleep Pills lmao
---
Yeah, something should really be done about totems. Like make them at least not glow. Killers need a buff.
---
Why
---
Colorblind mode please.
---
Maybe ? My name on steam is not the same name I have on Reddit
---
I really want to try this
---
You actually died? That's weird. I figured the game treated all falls the same, since why wouldn't it? Why would they account for falling from such a height?
---
It sucks but this game is worth the wait haha
---
It really is
---
If only...
---
Oh maybe not then lol, but last night I went against someone named star lord.  Maybe you're one of the people that roasted me after the game haha :)
---
I think we all know what we need...Daddy Myers pillow!
---
Their teammates are trying to have fun too, and when you bitch out of a match like a little entitled baby, it makes it harder for everyone to have fun.
---
Ah, so everyone knows they can disconnect with absolutely no worry. They probably shouldn't have announced that, lol.
---
Use NOED. Never take advice from a survivor. Loll they think they can tell you how to play.
---
No, you can't make 'exceptions'. DCing is neither strategic, nor an intended mechanic of the game. You're not better than anyone else; you don't get to insert your 'preferences' in a game when they weren't asked for in the first place. 
---
Like, there have been hundreds of comments and posts about the problem of DCing in this subreddit, and you're offended that your 'exceptions' aren't being tolerated.
---
Get a grip, get a life, and get over it. Don't be an ass, and play the game with some sportsmanship.
---
Not mori, but sacrificing all 4 Survivors using only character's unique Perks would be totally fair for Killers
---
BATTLESES! MORE BATTLESES!
---
offended? sure. Strangers dont offend me. You say i cant make exceptions, yet I do. Weird, its like I can.  Get a life? Is that still a thing to say these days? cute.
---
NOED ought to scale to the number of remaining totems on the map. Maybe then the killer gets as many insta-down hits on players as there are totems remaining on the map to a maximum of 6 insta downs (starting with a base of 1 instadown if all 5 totems are up).
---
That way there‚Äôs a good incentive to cleanse, but not a severe punishment for getting all but one cleansed. IDGAF when people just say ‚Äújust cleanse totems‚Äù re: NOED. Cleansing all 5 is hard. It‚Äôs only practical to cleanse all 5 in a SWF squad who can communicate how many they‚Äôve cleansed.
---
If you're gonna tell me face Camping with a leather face Is fair I don't know what too say about the killer main side of this community anymore people who don't play both sides enough have the most stupid opinions
---
I have survivors message me saying sorry for the placement
---
I have no intel on the context of this picture, all i can see is that EVERYONE Dc'd so im not sure what do you mean. But by no means i meant to argue pro-disconnecting.
---
She has the natural advantage in chases though. Even on an even playing field, mindgame wise, you should be winning. Her speed in phase is so fast and you are invisible. If you struggle with her turn your volume up since tracking in phase is pretty easy with headphones. After first hit since they most likely don‚Äôt have iron will you get a very easy hit.

---
Nah i don t desperately want to argue, i have better things to do, when i have time i reply. When you finish school, you will hopefully learn what better things to do means (if you ever finish school)
---
It would be great if killers were allowed to play full matches using strong addons and builds, I have no idea why that's so controversial ITT.
---
Dude, read the ‚Äúbasement‚Äù part, I‚Äôm talking about people who sit in the basement all game, even if it means the gates are powered without seeing anyone. And don‚Äôt even try to bring mains into this, I play survivor more than killer, I can at least appreciate the meme.
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt read the patch notes and I didn‚Äôt know bringing double mend was an exploit, I was just trying to use all my good add ons before the patch and I really hope i dint get banned.
---
Alas, this entire game is predictions aha
---
Because if they play well then they‚Äôre actually good, if they play like a fucking moron it‚Äôs because they think they‚Äôre gods, and if you downed them it was some horseshit in your/the game‚Äôs part, not theirs, it‚Äôs impossible for them to make a mistake
---
Holy shit the hypocrisy. Dying on the hook and DCing leads to the same effect. The rest of your team now has a harder game. If you're going to go around arguing with people, then be consistent. What a joke xD
---
How does this shit even get upvoted, this dumb false equivalency between leaving a match in progress and leaving a lobby? 
---
AMA request: Some one who upvoted that post
---
I use we‚Äôre gonna live forever with we‚Äôll make it on my David. Tons of points. I think it‚Äôs very useful for swf

He might look taller in his character portrait but you don't need to height shame him.

Not to sound like a jerk or anything but I sincerely doubt dedicated servers are going to curb quitter mentality.

I have social anxiety and it never really makes me nervous so to speak but it sure makes me excited to see what they‚Äôre gonna say whether it‚Äôs a good excited or a bad excited.

Nurse requires the most skill to play, are you stupid?

You DC because you're an entitled little baby.

---
You know DCing is frowned upon, and yet you continue to do so at the expense of others.
---
You've proven my point, and that's all I wanted. Thank you.
---
Killers do though. If I loop a killer too long or they get a 0k and it went badly they will DC too
---
[It's on the wiki.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki)
---
Whoah it‚Äôs not that serious bro
---
I love imagining crossovers, like which killer would be deadliest versus the OW team, or which Warframe would wreak the most havoc on the Tf2 team.
---
Oh thanks
---
Wat
---
I've always thought that after the gates are powered the survivors should have some kind of duration.  It's not just because of infinite teabagging at the exit gates.  It's not just because of people who then go hide in corners just to run up the mater timer.  It's not just because of boring hatch standoffs.
---
But it's *mostly* because of those reasons and this is amazing.
---
Mark mate you need to calm down lol
---
Playing any other Killer on Haddonfield: "Ohhh... shit."
---
Playing Trapper on Haddonfield: *Cracks knuckles* "Alright. Who's first?"
---
I throw a gg and leave.
---
Expense of others? I DC when the game is just a complete shit hole. Games already fucked. There was no expense
---
What are you worried about you have no mither haha
---
Haddonfield so far feels like it's very survivor biased, but I thought the same about The Game before I learned how to play it as killer.
---
Are you suggesting Haddonfield favors the killer, or just that it's heavily biased towards one side?
---
Killers don't DC from loopers at the same rate, lol and you know that. Yeah there's always going to be ragequitters on both sides, but killers are straight up not leaving matches when "they're not having fun" at the same rates survivors are doing right now.
---
Learn to play without noed. Use a build that has room for a swing perk on a killer you enjoy. Break out NOED as an occasional fun game. That way you've cultivated good habits and reflexes... and now have the edge NOED gives ya
---
:D
---
I almost feel guilty for dowloading it for free on ps4. When I'll have a decent pc, I'll purchase it for sure.
---
Don't act stupid if you're not stupid, do you need the consequences of disconnecting from a match in-progress and leaving a lobby before it stops explained to you, or are you just acting dense to argue a point?
---
I'm literally just asking you to play the game with some decency. If you have the patience of an adolescent, then move on. 
---
The rest of us don't want to tolerate your bullshit behavior.
---
Update: Just lost an ebony Mori because my game froze on loading the game
---
You don't get in trouble if you body block the basement as the pig when the basement people have traps on. Dunno why this would be different.

---
Lol twatwaffle what a descriptor
---
They don't...noone's called them that...
---
I had to edit because of you üòÇ
---
You need to be the last guy and injured in the same time. Too situational for my liking.
---
From my personal experience, when I do a "GG ez" "GG ez bby killer" or "ez killer tutorial" as Survivor, it's out of tradition and never an insult. I'll do it on 4k's just to show a fun spiriteven tho I was probably just massacred. The people who do it seriously are probably just kids and unfortunately you'll never know the difference. So take it with a grain of salt. I prefer the tough skin over "being offended". Brush it off and on to the next one.  Happy Killing!
---
Well Nea's are usually colorful and in nature colorful can be a warning that you are poisonous, but not necessarily true. Survivors are the same way. Their color is a warning for predators to back off.
---
this is a good call
---
I had to take my opportunity! Haha
---
How many likes does that tweet have? :/
---
Damn you guys upvote the dumbest shit
---
The devs need to higher you
---
Don't see why it would.
---
Getting out within 3 minutes of the exit being opened is really, really easy.
---
Not every "GG EZ" is disrespectful. Most people I know or play with do it to get a reaction or to have fun. Never malicious.
---
Za Bullshito
---
That would just open the hatch immediately.
---
Scratched mirror Myers with insidious and tinkerer... ew, why?
---
Make it so if you disconnect while dying or hooked you lose your item.
---
Bam, DC's over.
---
most skill lol... ignoring pretty much everything in this game needs skill, next thing u gonna tell me, legion needs skill? xD
---
Yes Eirri drew this one as well, it's the first she drew with Jason.

Do a quick spin and see if it's coming from your totem lol don't make the game TOOO easy

Tbh, I LIKE it when they add maps to existing realms.

It makes each realm feel a bit more fleshed out and stops offering bloat/bloodweb bloat.

What‚Äôs different?
---
Holy shit the salt ITT is hilarious
---
You need to create a build around it. The only killerI run itseriously on is Freddy, but my whole tactic with Freddy is to make them heal for as long as possible in the dream; Thanatophobia is just icing for that.
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
You were a piston?
---
It means nothing, but I do also play at red ranks as survivor. Haven't gotten there with the new pipping system yet, but I'm at purples already.
---
Playing killer makes you a better survivor. Playing survivor makes you a better killer.
---
Stealth is still the right way to counter the nurse. Urban evasion is a hell of a perk.
---
I think you‚Äôre just trying to make us jealous by your sheer collection over here... it‚Äôs working...
---
Survivor is really rough at rank reset. I used to be rank 1 but didn't play survivor much lately. Rank 14 now. It's hard to pip when teammates drop like flies and leave you on the hook until second state
---
I like the no scratch marks idea. Also, what about the auras of the hatch and exit gates being revealed to you once you are within a 8m radius of them?
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
I think it all depends on the map layout.
---
If you have trouble with ham-man just think of slam jam. Winston exists to just be a thorn in their sides, just gotta juke a bunch with him. I usually feed my ass out as Winston but I cussing love him.
---
It appeals to players both ironically and literally, some players will buy it as a gag gift for their SWF buddy, and some will actually be sleeping with and/or rubbing their genitals on it. It's brilliant.
---
omg im GAY thats so cool and UNIQUE me im kinda QUIRKY doe.
---
Yeah totally buying this for my mate!
---
Specific conditions being it reaches end game and you have traps isn't exactly that uncommon for pig...
---
The only case it won't happen is if you waste all your traps right away or kill everyone before end game
---
Highly doubt that. You wouldn't get a vac ban for something like that.
---
Why play on ps4. The games better on pc.
---
I cant afford a pc my dude
---
Headphones are useful for hearing survivors walking through grass or breathing.
---
We need this now.

---
Side note: You can join the Discord if you have more suggestions. ;D
---
Because sometimes bugs like that aren‚Äôt in the players hands and it would suck to be instantly killed for something they didn‚Äôt mean to do rather than get sent back into the map. Also it messes with their team too if they are already a man down.

This is even more true now that you can hit the same Survivor in Feral Frenzy and not damage their Mend timer.
---
I'm calling it now, there will be meme Legions who just repeatedly and constantly smack the same Survivor with Feral Frenzy.
---
...I like Legion due to Suzie.
---
Disgusting 3 blink nurse. I don't blame those that DC, honestly.
---
If it‚Äôs the last person alive, and they don‚Äôt struggle, I usually drop them at he hatch, if not enough gens are done and they don‚Äôt struggle, I drop me near the gens and let them go

Great! Thanks a lot !

Monster Shrine?

That's how I feel about Doctor. I love inflicting madness onto survivors, but when I am up against him I just can't handle madness skillchecks most of the time.

[Nooooo‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/iN7_O-2Kixw)
---
I mean if traps start when endgame starts she'll be good
---
The reason I say billy is the scariest killer is because it‚Äôs the best killer while still adhering to the rules of the game. A good nurse straight up feels unfair to fight, same with spirit (to a lesser extent) 
---
But a good billy? This bitch is being fair and taking the loops (the only survivor defence mechanism rn besides being efficient on gens) and will STILL crush you. Same with huntress (but to a lesser extent as well)
---
I have way more fun when fighting a god billy or huntress then a god nurse, I feel like I‚Äôm actually being outplayed with legit counterplay against them instead of nurse wallhacking. The chainsaw is hard to dodge on a god billy but that just comes down to spinning/being super unpredictable (hard also cause auto aim sometimes) 
---
TLDR; I respect god Billy‚Äôs. If I ever played killer at a high rank (I don‚Äôt cause I find killer super unfun to play) I would main billy
---
Wow... how immature.
---
I got 20
---
I follow them for about 5 seconds, and if it doesn't look like they are at least trying to get in a corner to hide then I give up.
---
what if u were chasing him, and that was his best chance cus his friend had low life?? i think theres more context to this. survivors are losing this
---
Me after 8 nurse games, but no one will listen to me cause ‚Äúnurse takes days, no, YEARS to master!!!!‚Äù
---
But as I've said, it's not going to do much unless you down the survivor right next to the gate switch. If you have to walk a long way to it, the survivors will just pick up the downed guy.
---
So it's not really much of a meaningful buff.
---
Don't even need to open that, just do a quick alt tab and if it doesn't come back them its you.
---
I‚Äôd be so upset because I just dumped so many bloodpoints into getting her P3
---
LOL Spirit gets cucked by maps, LOL. Her only really bad map is Haddonfield, period. Others maps can be tricky as well like Disturbed Ward ( the main building is tricky, survivors can juke you there, but a good Spirit can deal with it ), Grim Pantry ( I don't like the main building ) or Ironworks of Misery if they have Balance Landing ( but Spirit still have more chances there than 115 speed killers ). The Game and Badham Preschool also have safe pallets around basement, which bothers me, but once you get rid of them, you have 2 small maps which can be easily controlled with phasing ( even better than with Billy's chainsaw ). She doesn't need green or purple add-ons if you are good enough with her, she can do fine with just 2 yellow add-ons ( charge time + speed ). Also, I take add-onless Spirit over add-onless Freddy, Trapper, Cannibal, Clown, Doctor, Legion, Wraith, Plague, Pig, Shape, Hag and Huntress. And I would take add-onless Spirit over add-onless Billy in maps like Lery's or The Game.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work against t1 Myers.
---
I bet they‚Äôll still start but the endgame timer will either pause or slow down
---
Well...
---
Devout: Always be hooking. Let people get saved as often as possible for additional hook scores and make sure to hook everyone at least once. Get nine hooks for the Iridescent. 
---
Gatekeeper: If you stumble on a generator with any progress on it, kick it before even initiating chase. You need to keep their progress down and keep generators continually regressing for as long as possible. No matter what keep Survivors off of generators as much as possible by scattering them if they're in a group or using perks to monitor and slow generator progress. 
---
Malicious: This one can be a bit finicky but basically you're best off dishing out as much pain as possible and *keeping* them injured. Not to mention, make damn sure you keep them from repairing the last generator because Adrenaline by itself can drop this Emblem by a full tier. 
---
Chaser: This one is the most difficult by a significant margin. An Iridescent requires no less than 28 successful hits and you lose points for lost chases or proximity to hooks. This Emblem is particularly difficult for Killers like Trapper, Hillbilly, Leatherface, and Myers, who often do not hit survivors twice in order to end chases as quickly as possible.
---
Hahaha I drowned a Dwight and put an RBT on his head for tbagging me behind a window. He went to juke me and I caught him around the corner. I loled when he DCd.
---
Y my pp hard?

i saw that üòî

Don't de-rank. Seriously. Wait for rank Reset.

You should check the stickied post about endgame collapse.

The highest quantity of green add-ons are Rusted Jaws. I have so few Bags because I almost never don't go into a game without them, given how absurdly useful it is to be able to carry and set an extra trap or two.

Monstrous shrine sucks unless you build around it or you play as leatherface
---
It's not hard to get 4 stacks of bbq if you're camping and the equally noobish survivors are trading places before they get to second phase instead of doing gens.
---
Goddamn, I like your message.
---
That was my friend. Then we gave me trash talk for going down within 30 seconds cause there were no more pallets. The parts that sucks was that he didn't understand what he did lol
---
Waste it before Endgame. It's really annoying and strong otherwise
---
Your the type of person I‚Äôm talking about.
---
unless you're playing a killer who has an insta down, yea
---
Technically if they escape you get to see their aura but one way or another if you don't have an instadown you have to hit them.
---
That's my friend. Then he gives me trash talk when I go down within 30 seconds. The worst part is he doesn't even understand what he did lol
---
The community? Hell no.
---
I suicide when I see a nurse as well, no offense but its not fun at all playing against a nurse or a legion so I just let them kill me
---
Take all three invisible killers
---
Freddy - shit unless you use good perks and addons
---
Wraith - shit if anybody uses sprint burst or flashlight
---
Spirit - well, spirits ability sure is something
---
Point is every invisible killer is not very good
---
Billy is good because he has extremely good map control and mobility, but other than that he is kind of terrible, that‚Äôs why if billy is on hospital he‚Äôs kinda fucked
---
I guess it was more of a meme-y "lol terror radius wut" build. Sounds pretty lulzy. May have to try that one day.
---
Anything that does double damage (e.g. chainsaw, causing the Exposed effect) will skip their MoM proc since it takes them from Healthy to Dying. MoM only activates when going from Injured to Dying.
---
Other than that, yes, go fuck yourself.
---
That‚Äôs the joke.
---
A camping build with Insidious is fine. Kind of a gimmicky little build that can be fun sometimes. I get that. I meant more of the camping when you get mad at someone for out-playing you or just sitting there as a regular Killer. After a certain point Survivors are smart enough to just gen rush and leave you with your 1k. 
---
Like I said though, I know some people find it fun. I just personally can't understand it.
---
Happened to me once.
---
It was haunted grounds.
---
2 of my teammate were downed within the first minute.
---
He DCs, you didn't won the chase
---
My theory, granted I haven't played in a fair bit, is that people just aren't happy about the game's balance but don't think for whatever reason the devs would or should change it. So instead they insist others play by their idea of a better game.
---
I know for me as a killer I don't blame the survivors for gen rushing, I just wish there was more I could do about it or that it was a bit slower. But it's not the survivors fault I'm new and bad.
---
Thanos should snap the toxic players away the game would be better off that way.
---
Nah m8, meme bad would be third seal

*Platform:* PC
---
*Type of Bug:* Ingame
---
*Description:* Since The Plague update I've had absolutely colossal issues sticking through an entire match as a survivor. I just keep getting randomly disconnected about 3-4 minutes into a game. I don't have the same problems if I'm killer, presumably because I'm hosting the game, and I almost never get survivors lag out or disconnect in my killer games.
---
*Reproduction rate:* At peak game traffic times (evenings and weekends) then I'll disconnect between 90-100% of games in the first 3-4 minutes. Outside of peak times I may only disconnect 30-50% of the time.
---
*Steps to reproduce:* Absolutely no idea what's causing it, but pre-The Plague update then I had no such trouble whatsoever and I've been playing the game on and off since release, so I'm kinda assuming it's something in that update.
---
This is a work I did around August/September of the last year, I somehow totally forgot to share it back then. Nonetheless i hope you like it! // ‚ÄúHe loved the fog. The muted screams. The silence, that heavy silence after. And eventually the fog cleared itself leaving no trace and no whisper. ‚Äú, is the twitter description so I thought I‚Äôd add it here as well
---
I feel like this with hag.  Especially with the mud traps
---
Surveillance.
---
100%
---
You're kinda talking past the other guy. You keep stating that it's a participation trophy for getting a kill on the first hook because you facecamped. What the other guy is explaining is that because survivors are too cocky/farm happy/whatever, it's not just one kill.
---
You can hook somebody and stand in front of them and get at least 2 free hits from survivors who think they can just walk up and unhook because killers "aren't allowed" to camp. In some games, you can get 2-3 downs all at that first hook.
---
You say it's pants shittingly poor play on the survivors (which it is) but it happens *so much* that it's worth losing some hunting BP because of how many other categories get free points because survivors do that shit all the time.
---
Because people like you think camping isn't allowed or isn't a real thing or whatever they try to pretend it isn't happening and end up encouraging the behavior because *it bloody works.*
---
Or survivors that work right through your Ruin and simply don't give a fuck
---
Do you need to talk?
---
Good post, but the title is so shit and low-effort that I have to give this a downvote.
---
Still a legacy nurse player with ruin and franklins? Just admit you want to ruin their game lol. Great and accurate video, though.
---
Springwood used to have the single best totem spawn in the game (although technically it was bugged and you physically couldn't access the totem in the right spot of the preschool basement)
---
Did this with rancor insidious and noed and stood at exit gate the whole game I got a couple double kills but 90% of the time I got my rancor mori. People could leave out other gate but they kept. Getting greedy lmao
---
Only need 14 points to rank up in yellow, 15 in green/purple, 16 in red.
---
I think that's 14 points? I don't think thats a double pip at higher rank
---
i thought doctor was already able to see the illusions of himself he makes?
---
Because a skilled 2-blink Nurse is just SO easy to bully
---
/s (obviously)
---
I usually like NOED ironically because it makes him that much more terrifying.
---
Discordance, but the proc isn so annoying!
---
Nope I actually encourage gen rushing against the camping babykiller as the only reliable means to counter and punish that trash play.  Only rank 20 babies and filth go into games with the intent to camp.   Have some God damn self respect man.
---
He's rented Michael's house from him and does weekly basement bashes.
---
That happened prior to the pip changes. It's been that way since they disabled losing pip at Ranks 20-15. There isn't a huge, constant stream of new players coming in, so it takes ages to find suitably-ranked survivors for killers who are still Rank 15 or below. It's something I predicted before they implemented that change, and I can't believe that they still haven't addressed it. Maybe they think it's better that way?
---
I know, rank reset pushed way away from my usual rank so im trying to get back into the game.
---
Damn, that sounds rough. If only this game had windows. Then perhaps a survivor could... oh, I don't know, vault to get some distance? Since Spirit still follows the rules of physics and all.
---
Fookin legion
---
I didn‚Äôt realize an opinion on the Internet could offend some of you so badly.  Enjoy your game?  Why do you care what I think?
---
It's literally just a lever. NTM they've seen survivors do it thousands of times.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that perk existed
---
Oh ok that makes more sense lol
---
I‚Äôm convinced the people who run ‚Äúwe‚Äôll make it‚Äù are  a myth people with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna live forever‚Äù made up so I stay by the hook and get hooked again so they can farm me some more
---
r/comedycemetery
---
I main Spirit, this just gives me new opportunities to scare the shit out of the ones that think they‚Äôre clever
