Ace mains rise up
---
---
---
Wow I never knew they recycled the walk animations for all the killers.
---

---
No wonder Legion and the Wraith move so familiarly
---
Also, you're team. If the team fails, the team fails. That's how it works.
---
Notice how there are 4 freaking gens left. This guy's first kill only came because the first person let themselves die rather than let someone else go down trying to save.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This guy wasted a survivor's BPS, and he did get and undeserved 4k and very few bloodpoints to show for it. In the post game chat he just went on about how "he doesn't care about bloodpoints" because he just wanted to ruin people's day.
---
He also went on to say reports are ignored, but false reports result in a ban, which only goes to show logic doesn't work on some minds.
---
This shit needs to go. It's not "fun", it just ruins the game for four people. It's not in the spirit of the game whatsoever. It's a troll. It needs to be reportable, and they need to take action on it. BPS can't counter this, NOTHING counters this, survivors can't be rescued at long as he stays there, and that's fucking stupid.
---
Freddy is currnelty  getting a rework cause hes so bad. and i dont mean like legion, a new power and everything
---
It's like we gotta run wake up to have an advantage. They should've kept the doors 15 seconds and the timer 2 mins..
---
God your an insufferable cunt.
---
As with any tricky lunge it's way easier with T3 Myers (because its length is extended by 25%) but it's possible with other killers. Wraith can also launch himself across and pull this trick off with a full speed Windstorm Lunge. It takes finesse and practice but a Survivor doesn't have to be there. 
---
That's actually how you used to do it back when Coldwind was even more bullshit (about 2 years ago now) and Survivors could pretty much just sit up there. It gives them one hell of a jolt when a killer can pull this off.
---
Alright dude take your own damn advice shop complaing also.
---
Oh jeez, haven’t even used legion yet last time i picked up the game before last week was september 2018 so i haven’t used a few new killers
---
(Kazoo sounds)
---
The way she was shaking “no” had me dying. I do that (survivor main) and never thought about how that would look to the killer.
---
I am okay with this Ghostface being for the new scream season or something else, and then later on having a cosmetic to make it OG Scream. I don't understand people getting so bent out of shape about it.
---
Lether jacket outfit will be used a lot.
---
No complaints. &lt;3
---
Or spirit with beeds
---
No biggie, just wanted to let ya know friendo
---
I'm personally just happy we have Ghostface in the game at all
---
Legion got a rework cause he was fundmentally bad and op at the same time though i dont think so. 
---
Plague is kinda just forgotten about. 
---
Ghostface looks fun though ofc hes not out.
---
ye, and even than. The survivors have no reason to stay in the game for 2 whole minutes
---
I think it's just neat
---
Not my preferred musical choice but I always love seeing people take the time to mAke some content for this community
---
The purpose of showing the red devil mask was to show that the cosmetic was a Fun World variation of their original GhostFace mask. Overall lending itself to the probability that Dead by Daylight’s license is with Fun World and not the owners of the film rights.
---
It hardly matters at that point, the amount of work you'd have to put in to make that magic happen is just like... oof. It's a worthy payoff, the style is worth it.
---
I'm really surprised at this point we don't have additional emotes in the store
---
My guy.
---
Solo survivors aren't a team though, there's no in game communication options, and usually, survivors are super dumb.
---
For example, survivors opening gates when there's someone hooked. I could be, and I have, be tbagging, shaking my head, flashing them in the face to stop but they're pretty mindless.
---
How would you fix this?
---
You guys would redeem yourself a decent bit if you'd actually bring back The Teacher. This game could use a bit more corporal punishment in most matches.
---
Yup I cant count how many times I've wasted good addons and offerings.
---
Isn't the whole point of being a survivor to rely on eachother to survive? I know there is toxic teammates out there and I don't have an answer for that. You survivors mains that aren't toxic just need to work together better. Equip at least one perk that will help the other three in some way. I run kindred at the very least so whether I'm solo or it's a small swf they at least have some help from me if I get hooked.
---
Do you seriously have no shame in your body. You literally just copied his video and re-uploaded.
---
Ye
---
nurse. too slow and hard to use and boring power
---
Eh, if you’re the last survivor you’re fucked anyways unless you find the hatch first.
---
only thing I'm sad about is it sucks they could only get the mask and not the full costume.
---
Or do a gen
---
Tbh the devs have been consistently putting out things to make survivors act like less of a team. Might as well give us the option to trip, hit and kill each other next.
---
With the possibility of getting one hit? If you wanna throw then sure
---
I did play against a plague earlier on and it just seemed a useless killer but i guess it all depends on who is controlling the killer to use them to full potential. Im excited to try out spirit to!
---
They increased door time? You know the numbers off hand friend?
---
bond is much funner to find teammates to heal u instead of healing urself. self heal is more stategic but bond gives it a social element
---
Why look just hop on a gen and do the damn thing. I dont look for people.
---
I use bond and prove thyself. I also use small game for totem hunting. Spine chill for evasion.
---
Give survivors communication options between each other, because now, randoms just don't cooperate
---
I honestly didn't know this character was used for anything but hentai
---
The new pig buff looks amazing
---
Medical Horrors?
---
I think the franchise had some decent elements [namely the inspiration of John Kramer's philosophy with age old philosophies], but a lot of it was hidden under the gore porn and the plot was needlessly convoluted. Not to mention that a lot of things straight up didn't make any logical sense. Law enforcement was easily the most unrealistically portrayed. Or even how Jigsaw's no kill policy was constantly undermined passed the first film. There are just so many problems with the series and many of the fixes resulted in more problems.
---
Erm. 25 sec I think. Should be in the notes. I heard them mention it in the stream.
---
Also for the record I am aware of mistakes I made. I shouldn’t have hesitated to run back as much, and I used my Dead Hard a moment too soon. Also for the record, it was clear by this point that the Killer had BBQ. (She did too) And the only reason why the other survivors even died was because that was how she was finding them at all. I was the only one hiding my aura when survivors were hooked and as a result wasn’t found until the end.
---
I'd settle for Bikini top/Daisy Dukes Kate.
---
Tell someone who gives a fuck... I got yall all upset.. I'm laughing yall crying.
---
Leatherface 100% there’s a reason why almost every leatherface camps/tunnels. It’s a little more understandable for Freddy’s to do it since end game is dog shit for him.
---
As all games should be
---
Please put this man in more movies.
---
As a killer main I've always wanted some proximity chat so I'm down for that change lol
---
New DS is stronger than old DS but more fair. Developers really balled out with that one I’ll admit
---
Solo or not you are a team. You are one group against an individual and you all have the same goal, powers the gens and escape. How you go about that, be it positive or not is entirely based on the team and team composition.
---
I just hope they can find something in their life that makes them happy, or escape whatever abuse they take so they don't have to lash out at others.
---
Or barring that maybe they can just transfer their will to hurt others into a profession more suited to them, like becoming an actual sadist or a boxer.
---
YOU CAN IF THERE D E A D 
---
JUST PACK DAT EASY-O-MORI-O AND DUMPSTER THAT GOBLIN AFTER HIS FIRST HOOK
---
See your one of those who cant do anything without being healed. I dont like those on my team.
---
He does a lot of voicing for Shaggy in modern scooby doo incarnations.
---
So then friend, why do you do such a thing? What motivates you to ruin others gameplay experience?
---
It is a common steam issue, I have had it happen to me before and if you google "steam update take forever" you get plenty of hits.
---
It could also be your hard drive / ssd that is acting up. If your disk is close to full, the system might have to shovel a lot of smaller files around to accomodate for the update process and thus taking longer than normal.
---
The timing was perfect, it was a complete "come here bitch" moment.
---
Okay well it’s not down to you to decide who’s on your team. I like being healed so I don’t instantly die and screw the team over. I’ll use self care so I can be healedquicker saving everyone time and allowing us to get a better chance at winning. I don’t like people who throw on my team
---
Aimbot claims incoming
---
ANYONE ELSE RANDOMLY LOSING PIPS? I HAD 3 PIPS TOWARD MY NEXT LEVEL WHEN I LOGGED OUT NOW I HAVE ZERO.
---
youre a fuckin legend
---
Ok I don't get why this post has so many dislikes. The nurse is balanced. She is the most powerful killer period, somebody has to be in the position of S tier. There's a reason why She the only viable killer at the highest ranks (not including billy but let's face it Nurse &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Billy). Survivors complain but there has to be some killer that players can use at the high ranks and not get their assholes completely destroyed by a bunch of butt dancers.
---
Graphics are so much better
---
This wont be a skin unless they give him a propeller hat or oven mitts or something else.
---
Since for whatever reason they have to make every Billy skin a joke.
---
Hurrrrr here's another one about him being a hillbilly! Hyuk hyuk! Give him beer cans! Give him a raccoon hat!
---
Other killers get badass skins that actually differ thematically. Hillbilly just gets garbage. Even his hallowed blight outfit is the worst of the lot. My son said "That man is made of cheese. And he has nacho cheese coming out of him."
---
I wept for Billy that night.
---
/u/SpitsOutCereal
---
This might be bannable watch out
---
Suuure you haven’t. It’s okay, most survivors don’t expect to be given the hatch anyway. Being able to close it has just allowed killers to reach their final form of assholes. Not really any different than hooking someone right next to the hatch.
---
Really just gonna copy his video? Sad
---
It does suck, but they did word it as "**Inactive** RBTs won't activate when a survivor exits through a gate," which makes me think active traps will still kill at the gate.
---
It's not much, and I do think the changes were way too hard on Pig, but it could be worse.
---
There was a dbd addon/ program that the devs actually supported and added a lot of their stuff they already had in such as ping indicators and such though when they added an avoid player feature they lot the devs respect and now it is bannable to use it due to that. So I'm guessing we won't have this any time soon.

If you don't say anything pre-game nobody has any idea of knowing if you're running a loot build
---
My friend runs it, at red ranks everyone has noed so it’s hit or miss tbh. Always depends on your philosophy when it comes to totem hunting as well.
---
It’s survivor mentality dude. Nothing they do is toxic, and projecting your objective is against the rules. I feel for you man.
---
Macros are only bannable if people report them. I dont see how this gives anyone else a competitive edge in the game. Most of the macros that people talk about that ARE bannable are flashlight macros that lag the killer's game out
---
I’m not trying to argue. 🙂
---
A Freddy did this to me and I was so confused. Guess tractors suck now.
---
Hex: No One Escapes Judgement
---
"Gen-rushing," "doing the objective," it doesn't matter how you see it, its GEN-ocide and it needs to be punished. When a Generator that a survivor was working on is completed that survivor earns a Token. 
---
1 Token: Get a notification when that survivor gets on a Generator.
---
2 Tokens: While going towards the Generator the survivor is on, have a 5% Haste Status Effect.
---
3 Tokens: Apply the Deep Wounds Status Effect and reveal their Aura.
---
"How the hell did you get here- what...Seriously? We decided on our perks over SIX MONTHS AGO! And the best you could come up with is a bootleg Hex: Devour Hope? It doesn't even have a cool acronym! NOEJ? [Was pronoucing it 'no - E - j' and not 'no - edge' thought I think they would've hated it anyway because the joke was that its so bad that it provides no-edge]" - Some member of the Legion
---
I don't disagree actually. I think it's fine for some perks to not be powerful. However, they should all serve a purpose. Right now, Left Behind isn't really usable. It doesn't need to be strong by any means, it just needs to work often enough that it is worthwhile to bring in every now and then. 
---
I think a lot of players would also agree that it's fine not to always be altruistic either. Different people play differently. I usually play to save the other person myself, but sometimes I know saving is going to result in both killed (camping killers typically) so having a perk that would help me get an escape in those rough situations would be nice, imo. I'd also argue it doesn't incentivize anymore that running a map tracking black locks does. 
---
To be clear I'm not saying my suggestion is the only way for it to be handled, it just needs to be reworked so it actually will be used sometimes. Like I said, I think your suggestion would work perfectly fine. Provide some worthwhile bonus to help the last survivor that can actually be used on a semi regular basis.
---
You forgot to mention legion
---
The only way I get get a framerate above 2 was to not use anything other than the most basic skins. Anything with moving bits or glowy bits made it impossible to swing at somebody without losing them.
---
If only the Pig didn't suck at Stealth.
---
true
---
Want all 🤘😭😜
---
We wouldn't need IP holders' approval of our lewd desires if the game had basic mod support and you could just get shirtless Myers for free right now.
---
Those songs used to play on the main menu after the release of their respective killers up till the next chapter came out. Now they added them to play when you select them on the main menu
---
It pebble
---
It's fine if you're new or don't know the spawn points yet, but once you've played enough you start to "know" where they spawn and don't need Small Game anymore.
---
prayer beads = DC
---
So u want some generic clothes?
---
Best thing I saw all day!
---
Did you have distressing? It's hard to max deviousness as The Pig.
---
exactly, i’m playing killer rn at rank 5 and everyone runs small game. doesn’t make sense to me why people need it at this point.
---
I could have sworn that video games are for entertainment. You complain about about us using everything we use because killers are fucking op. And also you probably use all this toxic shit to get to rank 1. Try earning something the fair way. I got to rank 6 on both survivor and killer without camping, tunneling, pink add on’s or moris (those last two once or twice), nurse, legion, or infinites. So stop acting like it’s necessary for your lazy ass to win you have to stoop to such a shallow level.
---
Want to know what's more satisfying.
---
&gt;End game, killer camping to secure kill

Bonus points if they have d strike as well and take a hit for you to both escape as you run to the exit.

Clown doesn’t have his own map either but got damn it we need one.

why?

https://youtu.be/Ermq43thCfg Monto here tries to do it at 11:40. He only does the first part, but OP shows the second part. Takes a little practice.
---
Yamoka Estate And Ormond would like to have a word.
---
If you love to hunt totems, absolutely. I run a Tapp Totem-Hunting build with Detective's Hunch and Small Game and my team hasn't fallen to NOED since. Ruin is gone within minutes as well. Hex perks hardly stand a chance.
---
One of the best ones youve made yet zombie boi.
---
I honestly prefer Detective’s Hunch because it reveals auras of everything else like chests and stuff and I’m usually the one who goes for Ruin when I play (I play solo)
---
Dwight's just a little cutie patootie

Has he done "is this loss" yet?

100% this. i'm shocked that people make little to no effort in the pre-game chat to come up with any sort of strategy.
---
Pigtress
---
Amen
---
Omg this happened to me when I first got the game and I thought they were hacking. I legit didn’t play killer for like a month after that happened.
---
Dude you're fucking garbage if you DC to Freddy,but not Nurse. Not that you should even DC in the first place.
---
75% one is only really good when combined with the yellow that turns the shock into a beam.
---
What a loser.
---
WAZUUUUUP *intensifies*

i didn't know that, i only play a game or two per day, so im not very savvy on patch notes.
---
seems like that removes the penalty for disconnecting. but i get why they did it.
---
Maybe just make the exit an elevator
---
Thing is, using contractions isn't the proper way to say stuff. Contractions are technically English "slang"

Dribbling was an exploit though...an exploit literally means an unintended mechanic or flaw in a game haha. Dribbling wasn't intended by the devs, but was allowed because it was the only counterplay available to the badly designed DS at the time haha.
---
You can enjoy whatever you want lol But you said DS is now stronger than old DS when it really isn't.
---
What a forehead
---
Yes, sniper doctor can be fun with a totem build.
---
Aside from whatever the situation of this match was, **YES** I would love to get my offerings back from skeleton matches.
---
We have been asking for this for years. Their reply in a past dev stream was it’s too much work. Bums!!
---
I've gotten accused of tunneling after chasing the rescuer and downing them with a chainsaw hit, being body blocked by the person who just got rescued, and then dropping rescuer and putting the original back on the hook.
---
It's retardation and its finest.
---
Ok dude
---
WHOOHOOOO
---
Did she have to shake her head though?
---
didnt realize how bad i wanted another Lery's map. It's gonna happen some day.
---
a japanese cemetery map with the same levels as swamp would be cool, too.
---
You can exchange them in the same game you know
---
yeah, i can see how it’s better
---
Considering that his lines released at a really low volume, the patch probably turned them down even more lol
---
Spawned in, actually.
---
Legion to Claudettes hiding in corners
---
*ahem*
---
Get fucked
---
that’s why the correction wasn’t needed
---
Trapping a survivor at endgame has always been nearly certain death. I don’t see that changing. And it’s not about saving traps. The Pig was always better off trying to win early and snowballing. However, if she fell behind and couldn’t use all her traps before the generators were all completed she could still use them to prevent them from escaping. She’s lost that now and she’s received nothing to make up for it. It’s just egregious considering she was a mediocre Killer before the nerf. She’s probably one of the worst Killers in the game now. 😞
---
I mean "argue" as in "debate" a point, not as in an actual rowdy argument :)
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Infectious Fright, Devour Hope and TotH is what I’m running atm.
---
The best thing about Spirit is her power is all skill and mind games not enhanced by perks, which allows you to be flexible. My current build just tries to cause mayhem once you hit 3 stacks of Devour Hope
---
She did.
---
One chainsaw to zoom and one to YEET like a hatchet.

"Eeeeyyyyyy guys I am BACK with a NEW the video showing the new LEAKED DLC killer for DBD - GHOSTFACE, before we get into the animations and new MORI LEAKED ANIMATION let me talk about unrelated related garbage for 11 mins first"
---
Exactly.
---
Shit, this could get taken down? 😬
---
You're wrong.  Use self care if you prefer it but bond is easily a completely valid replacement to self care.  Ever since the Sloppy Butcher and healing speed update a while ago Self Care simply wastes so much time.  Many of us would prefer to find our heals from others on top of all the other incredibly useful information that Bond provides.

I LIVE ON THE EAST COASTGENERALLY PLAY AROUND 10-12 AT NIGHT AND MY QUEUE TIMES ARE ONLY ABOUT 1-3 MINUTES. BUT I'M RANK 17 RIGHT NOW SO I GUESS THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF FELLOW NOOBS FOR ME TO QUEUE WITH. IT'S DISCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT QUEUE TIMES WILL GET WORSE THE BETTER I GET AT THE GAME BUT NOT SURPRISING.
---
I feel bad, because as a killer main I never experience this, since I don't play against other killers of course.  Wish you better luck in the future!
---
Meanwhile I pop bloody streamers during DoubleBP event, play one of my stronger Killers (Trapper) and as I was rank 20 after being gone for so long just.. did everything but murder the other team, except for hooking them a third time. They were all confused as I could have clearly won (Specially all the slugging I was doing), "Its double BP, I wanted you guys to have a little fun too!"
---
Check rules 3 and 8. I took the time to blur names and they still got rid of my delicious salt.
---
He must of shat his pants when he realized what just happened.
---
Awesome explanation. Wouldn't be surprised if most of this is accurate!

Omgggg it reminds me of that one scene in Teen Wolf where Kira stabs her sword into the ground to summon a dead girl, that's awesome
---
I wouldn't argue one bit with this.
---
Bill doesnt exist on console. It can never be even. Rip.

They also have a Brandon James mask from the MTV series but judging by the different logo, I would bet it's under a different license. https://i.imgur.com/UmsYseZ.jpg

That was mean. No bulli. :(
---
And you spend so much time bitching about the 1 in 100 troll games that you believe everyone in this game is out to troll everyone else.
---
You pretty much exemplify the "entitled player" template who thinks that everyone else should cater to them by defending drastic solutions to something that's not even a problem. You keep inventing these imaginary boogeymen to make yourself feel better about why you lost and you want more and more ways to ensure that won't happen in the future.
---
so yes, she's still just deadly at endgame, especially if you trap people with 1 gen left. Only difference is you can't put the trap on last second. Which also doesn't matter as the EGC will basically be the same effect.
---
Throw in perks like Remember Me and Blood Warden and you have a strong end game presence still. I'm already going up against or seeing annoying ways killers are stalling out the end game themselves to force survivors to die by it.
---
not really, you just need to look around as well its pretty simple.
---
The Clown's Santa outfit would fit so well.
---
YOU'LL GET THERE, IT'S JUST A LOT OF GAME KNOW-HOW AND STRATEGY. WELCOME TO THE (TOXIC AF) FOG!
---
That Ultimatum perk... Messing with a survivor's permenant movement speed is iffy. If they get to the 115% boost, some killers literally cannot catch up to them. Imagine all four survivors running it and they all get to that point.
---
Cosmetics definitely give them a more steady revenue stream than DLC does. It's nice that they put so much effort in to the DLC considering that cosmetics might make them just as much money.
---
Next update: Trapper and Hag no longer trap in front of exit gate. - Killer main cries.
---
LoL. Followed this whole thread because, I dunno, I like self abuse. Thanks for the laugh at the end.
---
Is this a joke or are you legit reinstalling for Spirit after like a year?
---
It's a cool thing to use.
---
Convinced me to buy Leatherface.
---
Can't look through walls though.  Premonition helps a lot, even though I don't use it. By the time you see the killer without it, they're in the same room .
---
Bruh at least credit the dude who found this and link his video.
---
Pretty sure it was to avoid the decisive strike, not to "toy with the survivor" mate.
---
BING BONG BOI WRAITHY WHEN CLOAKED ESPECIALLY BLENDS IN!
---
Ok. I actually just noticed after I posted it that the rework was fan made.
---
I'm not upset, this shit is pure entertainment for me silly.. dont get it twisted. Reddit is full of triggered survivor and killer mains.. I just play on it.
---
Yeah, just go to the library and re-download it.
---
I was kinda hoping that final stab would be to the head.
---
Ultimatum giving the final survivor movement speed equal to most killers' seems pretty OP. Some killers would literally not be able to catch up with them. Plus, due to the power, survivors would be greatly encouraged to get their allies killed (or at the very least, a lot less inclined to be altruistic).

---
Also we probably would've gotten the survivor in the leak not just Ghostface.
---
I figured there was no way theyd get them to a hook in time and she planned on throwing them out
---
Can you imagine if you were downstars and it's a T2 Myers upstairs. He hops down to you. So you go from T2 Myers with reasonable terror radius and lunge to T2 Myers with T1-status terror radius with longer lunge.
---
I'd be down for it.
---
&gt; Detective’s Hunch because it reveals auras
---
of course, it relies on completing generators
---
Oh yeah, forgot that change. I don't use D-Strike.
---
Ultimatum only affects the walking speed. Running speed remains untouched.
---
They need to bring in Richthofen's stiff gold rod as an item
---
I love that!
---
How would you use it then?
---
I hate those offerings I have so many freddy ones. I cant play him without addons.. hes add on dependent lmao
---
i HARDLY do killer and dont own this fucker, but i will main him and only him if this ever happens.
---
Gotta be a healthy mixture of both. Then everybody has fun
---
These outfits already exist in the SAW movies but I'd be down for a new SAW movie

What is this cursed image?!
---
I was just about to post about this, i randomly stopped getting objective points

Typical POS toxic killer main
---
It doesn't matter if you can't see through walls, you just need to be in a place where you can most likely see the killer coming towards you, you'll be fine that way.

So that they have nothing but silence while they reflect upon their actions.

Definitely the bloody mask, also I love the metallic mask too
---
[removed]
---
I want that high ghostface mask with the tongue sticking out. WAZZZZAAAAA
---
You are correct... so I went back and watched the video again... and again I laughed. Thank you :)
---
Ughhh dude... I always try to save someone. It feels so good rescuing and we both getting out!!
---
That was awesome
---
You can't trust randoms man. Ever
---
When is hatch supposed to spawn with more than one person left now? I had 2 survivors left and they had one gen done and they escaped through hatch.
---
No, thnak yuu
---
Im glad they kept the phone even if the character design is changed
---
But it does count.
---
That is true, but it does exist. Its two to two.
---
No worries, we all forget about changes now and again. Lol. I never forget about the change since I hate old ds with a passion.
---
Watching it again is hilarious. But it wasn’t so much when it happened ;_;
---
Then he could hide and go to one of the gates.
---
Me too! I've died to let others escape. Plus, this was before endgame collapse, so there's no excuse to not get me &lt;\3
---
You're welcome!
---
I mean, it's not really? Her entire character is setting up rigged situations where you can't survive and basically thinking that "there's no hope saving anyone so let's kill them all."
---
Placing an already active RBT on your face while you're on an already ticking secondary timer that will also kill you (EGC) is totally something she'd do.
---
the freddy dance at the end killed me lol
---
Aww they’re adorable, nice work!
---
I know &lt;\3 that's why I only play with my friend haha at least I can count on her
---
they have been a thing for a long time
---
they are just there to let you try a killer without having to buy that killer 
---
once you get the killer they stop showing up for that particular killer
---
One second I frozen in place.
---
Another I was transported back to where the killer was.
---
I'm not the only one this happened to as I could see others got Rubber-banded badly. Meg and Ash DC'd immediately and I couldn't blame them.
---
Luckily the killer, which was Legion, was nice so that's an upside, I guess.
---
I merely want there to be balance, and for those who previously disregarded the Killers' pleas to be able to concede to understand what it was like. If this doesn't apply to you, then it doesn't apply to you.
---
But there are those who it does apply to, and I hope they feel what Killers felt.
---
Are you talking about the lunge over the gap? Any killer can do it (save t1 Myers) when lunging, you can also skip over the hole in the hallway in the badham school with it too!
---
That's debatable, it depends entirely on the numbers. If he can "mark" targets fast enough, and skip a chase with a surprise instadown hit, he may achieve hooks overall faster than average since you have to move a little slower on approach (which can be buffed with add-ons) but don't have to worry about long chases.
---
This is also his BASE power; the right detection/stealth perks are going to make a significant difference in his performance.
---
He's still incomplete and won't release for another couple of months, so it's way too early to judge his ability.
---

---
Technically not broken because it has easy counter play but it’s sounds stupid and fun for a swf.
---
Dunno how you do that, I usually can't see farther than 2 rooms on Lery's and 1 room in The Game
---
Don't 👀 mind 👀 me 👀 i'm 👀 just 👀 peeping 👀
---
You'd think the people who were out of the loop would be pissed to learn they're only getting a killer for chapter 12.
---
Before the patch they'd still kill you if you ran out the gates with one on your head, regardless of when it was put on.
---
Now, once the gates are powered, any Traps you still have are wasted.

My favorite moment tonight was running a Pig around, getting downed by NoED as 2 remaining teammates open the gate.  One cleanses NoED, then they both immediately leave while I'm on the hook...

I found an edit of what his face SHOULD look like from a post a few months ago:  [https://www.google.com/search?q=quentin+smith+goblin&amp;rlz=1C1GCEU\_enUS821US821&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWkcXmoo3iAhUkhuAKHRiGB8gQ\_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1218&amp;bih=650#imgrc=UrLS2F6aNhTp5M:](https://www.google.com/search?q=quentin+smith+goblin&amp;rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS821US821&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWkcXmoo3iAhUkhuAKHRiGB8gQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1218&amp;bih=650#imgrc=UrLS2F6aNhTp5M:)
---
Yes. He was being toxic when he should have just jumped in. IMHO, she should have slugged him.
---
Mannnnn lol it was a video awhile back, but it was up here and it literally just showed the trapper swinging and walking across just like that.
---
New timer in the update looks awful, dont even want to try it, it just looks bad..
---
I don't think you know what redundant means.
---
[Psh, I'm playing as this absolute unit](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yc2k9pm3UeM/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
Imagine being so mad about winning. Good job isn't that why you brought those offerings and add-ons?
---
i fucking love that.
---
No.
---
Nooo I'm so sorry that's so awful :( I like Dead by Daylight a lot but man some teammates are insufferable
---
I knew about the badham school hole but I thought that was because you kind of rode the edge. This just looks like he straight up jumps over.
---
Ooo a double cake day
---
Ohhh well I love it!
---
It does count. They can never be even.
---
In that case might as well just replace "*Freddy"* with the actual one from the 80s instead of whatever that is that we have rn. If they did they could do so many different outfits but especially Super Freddy.  
---
We NEED and DESERVE Super Freddy.
---
They always sucked. For killer. With this the tables turn.
---
I knew about the badham school hole, but I thought it was because you skirted the edge? This looks like a straight up jump.
---
It saves a lot of time hunting for totems. Even if you do know common totem spawns, it's a lot more efficient to have a 12m radius around you identifying which of the common spawn locations did actually have a totem spawn in, and do so without having to adjust your pathing too much.
---
Given the popularity of Ruin and NOED, and the problems many random players have with these perks, I would say Small Game is a sensible-enough choice, at least in solo/duo-queues.
---
Your whole team is dying on the other side of the map, and what are you doing?
---
Going down a slide... *sigh*
---
it most likely is not Ghostface from the movies.
---
Nope, everything seems pretty balanced to be honest. If this were a thing, I would hope that hunk would be the survivor. And hopefully give us both a Resident Evil 2 Original and Remake outfit With p3 blood for both outfits. I’d literally make him my main, especially with perks like those....
---
Imagine spending so much time trying to annoy people online. What a sad, lonely life you must live. I do hope you learn to become a better person.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Try a new build? with or without shadowborn or monitor?
---
I like to imagine ghostface had to convince the entity to give him a phone like "but what if they bring purple flashlights and i dont have a phone to call for help?"
---
Ill consider guilding this, i am however very broke, like broker than i have ever been.
---
just imagine gold for now and ill bbl maybe.
---
what do you mean? the mask looks just like the one from the movies, and the killer name is “the ghost”.
---
Have not, I didn't really think that was too great of a format, honestly.

Maybe in the not-so-distant future?

---
You see, the problem is that you're watching it as a serious (horror) movie when in reality you should be watching anything past the first as a soap opera-style comedy involving the wacky antics of Kramer and friends and their convoluted timelines.
---
You've never seen a splinter before?
---
Should be that the generator progression done whilst the perk is active also counts towards half of the exit gate opening amount - so you can work on gens to give yourself a better chance at opening either one of your other exits when/if the hatch is closed
---
Odd. It doesn't look like a camp.
---
No, im not. I do prefer. yes im low rank enough to have my opinion matter.  Sloppy is meta but is not better than ruin/bbq/enduring/spirit fury. Most games its a 32 second heal not 38\~. Bond does not provide that much information. Specifically if you're in a swf, then it almost provides nothing. Best case you know where the killer is based on the guy being chased. The information of knowing where your team is doesnt effect anything. On the hook? go save them. Short of that, get your ass on a gen and get out. You know what wastes time? someone staying wounded and going down in 5 seconds to a killer. 
---
I dont mindlessly advocate healing up at all times, but there ARE times to do it. One guy healing another is 16 seconds from each guy. 32 seconds of total time. then if you get on a gen together thats 45\~. Thats 45 seconds plus 16, which is 61 seconds. Someone doing a gen for 32 seconds while you self care first then help them leaves 48 seconds of gen time left. divided by 1.8 is about 27 seconds. 32 seconds plus 27 seconds is 59. Almost the exact same in both scenarios. I bring this up to first disprove that self care wastes time, cuz it fucking doesnt. Secondly ill address the merit of your argument, that is theyre similar times, then why bring the perk at all. Run bond and find a guy right? what if no one is within 32 meters? you gonna search for them now? you gonna waste more time. I mean honestly at this point someone could right a dissertation about why you should or shouldnt run self care and both sides would have a point, but whats really been bugging me on this teen angst filled forum is how many people CALL people out for using it like its the end of days. Or that it means your white ranks or something. Im a red rank player, and i have had SC in my build for years. It is a fantastic perk, especially when you cant always rely on a team. 
---
If im hurt and theres good loops near a gen, i wont bother healing. If im on a gen in the middle of nowhere, i will self care. Its not about always healing. its about having the option too. Never being able to make a save? never chasing the killer for a while? making loud wounded noises and getting caught? i play both sides and ill tell you i lost count of the times someone will opt out of not healing and just doing gens then getting caught, going down in a few seconds, getting bbqed, then showing the rest of his team, all while thinking hes being cheeky and making plays by not healing. Good for you, convince people in your ignorance and lack of math that self care is bad. But dont come in the topic and say "you're wrong". Like get the fuck outta here
---
Man getting stabbed always looks so painful, cant imagine that feeling when the knife is jabbed in the side there.
---
Yeah the jump over the hole happens sometimes. The hit happenes because the hit box was still their its why you can hit people slow vaulting.
---
the licenses are different. the company FunWorld owns the license to the Ghostface mask. remember - Ghostface's entire costume is meant to be things anyone can buy in a store. the mask is from an actual store in real life which is owned by FunWorld. but Scream is owned by a different company. it looks like BHVR only got the license for the mask
---
Somebody called me a noob for using Spine Chill yesterday. Guess which one of us survived ;)
---
Pretty sure the Legion was attempting to wait out the Decisive Strike.
---
not useful, pointless.
---
Putting on a trap that will kill you in 2:30 minutes while a timer that is 2:00 minutes is already going to kill you is redundant. Keep in mind I'm referring to how her traps worked pre-patch in this context.
---
Not as lore accurate, ghostface just stabs away.
---
Them not having the license is conjecture at this point.
---
My question is this; we're getting a full chapter within the next 5 or so weeks. We aren't getting Ghostface for at least 2 more weeks, without a doubt.
---
Why would they bring out two paragraphs between chapters? Surely it'd be better to save paragraphs for mid chapter content draughts.
---
They've only finished one Ghostface perk. Not everything in the DLC was in the leak, clearly.
---
Could we please just fucking delete legion permanently from the game now? I just hate them so much and it's a stupid concept. Legion is to Ghostface what the Trapper would be to Jason and Hillbilly was to Cannibal, I.E you know they just added those because they couldn't get the movie killers when the game started. I wouldn't even mind if Ghostface could run but the mending thing needs to go.
---
Yeah, the progress bar that pops up when you start working on the box. It'll go down farther when you miss a skillcheck
---
\*The hitbox god feels favourable today
---
looks like something out of a rob zombie film
---
And Trapper feels like a discount Jason.
---
Except that indoor maps are the worst maps in the game.
---
Damn ok thanks oof that sucks...it should make the timer go down &gt;.&lt; they hardly ever miss em anyway
---
No it would be a challenge, "Loss" is an ironic meme, the act of doing it is the meme not the meme itself so.  
---
Oh wait i remember someone did do it though using the Doctors map.
---
Billy is at an appropriate power level.
---
He can still get shit on by coordinated players, but that's more to do with gens going by too fast than Billy being weak.
---
Bro you're wrong in the sense that you declared a blanket statement stating Self Care over Bond 100% of the time.  That is patently false and ignorant.  If you prefer self care awesome but many of us don't anymore.  It ain't that good and for solo queue players like myself Bond is very very useful for finding faster heals than your self care while knowing about close chases, multi survivor gen opportunities etc...you were the one telling everyone we were wrong I simply said you were wrong in your blanket statement.
---
That is actually an amazingly silly-ass thought that I would have never considered even being a thing.
---
But now I gotta try this lol
---
Aw you don't gotta do that! D: But thank you!
---
I saw the devkit animation and I never realized that the survivor would be face down-i thought it would be like the legion
---
As it should be. In a 4v1 game the 4 should HAVE to work together in order to win. Its not fair to the 1 if 1/4 of their opponents can entirely counter them, hell I’d even say 2/4 shouldn’t be able to counter the 1. The game is teamwork vs power and DbD players really don’t see that. That’s why killers complain about comms and survivors complain about not being able to escape with bad teammates.
---
this reminds me of that 1 community gif where Glover comes in the room all happy with pizza and sees everyone panicking and there's a fire.
---
"When I finish the first generator and see how the rest of my team is doing."
---
Oh yeah I know, I usually power through a gen before looking for ruin just in case someone else is looking too.
---
He probably didnt realize he couldnt be grabbed
---
For 1 I'll let it go. For 2 screwups on a gen I stop working on it and then point them to go into the corner of shame. At 3 I just leave them to do the gen on their own.
---
I would hate this change. All they need to do is reduce the timer and not let people tell where i am via grass. Im thats too much just reduce the timer.
---
fucking anal bead spirit does me in everytime.
---
The best type of Tbag.
---
Because it'd just be a waste of time. If it were possible to self unhook as the last survivor, the killer would camp the hook. In turn, the survivor could wait out the hook timer to troll the killer.
---
Maybe because they needed more time for a new chapter?
---
I mean are we even sure? We found everything about ghostface, His perk, add ons, cosmetics but nothing on a survivor not even in the files. Bhvr also said ash was a chapter I'm pretty sure and he wasn't do Bhvr is inconsistent with wording also.
---
I partially agree but they need to do something about him being terrible at the endgame.
---
Imagine this though. Mettle of Man, Decisive Strike and Unfettered. That is 3 second chances right there. It would drive a killer insane.
---
That's mean i love it.
---
Might have to find more friends. Hell i'll play with you if you're on the PS4
---
I mean every killer is bad at the end game besides billy and nurse.
---
Well it doesn’t make me feel any better. I know the hitboxes work weird with windows and I’m used to that by now but that hole thing triggered me to my core. But it is what it is.
---
Just add red twine :)
---
Not to be rude, but did you even read what I said? Ghostface will have to come with three perks. Only one has been found. Evidently, we haven't found everything about Ghostface.
---
It would still be very, very useful at that stage.
---
The point of the trap at that point wouldn't be to kill you. Whether or not the timer on the trap is going is irrelevant here.
---
The point of the trap here is that *they can't leave*.
---
Even if she was left unchanged, and her endgame traps became kinda broken, people would almost never die directly to her endgame traps. They would die to the Collapse because the traps stopped them from leaving.
---
This sub is so toxic.  It was a joke, denoted by the super obvious winky face.
---
Pig was nerfed. The definition of a nerf is to weaken, which is what happened to pig. I’m not arguing on whether or not she needed it, but people need to admit to it being a NERF.
---
Well I mean Freddy is literally useless at the endgame.
---
Oh well, nothing you can really do about it though.
---
Sadly I'm on PC but I totally would have played with you :)
---
It works against the killer sometimes as well.
---
That makes no sense. The new chapter is gonna be coming at the same time, regardless of whether or not there'll be another paragraph before it.
---
Not really if i put everyone asleep at end game its jualst takes forever to open the door and put that with remember me and i usually will have a slug snag him hook'em we got blood warden
---
I just stock up on green medkits from Pharmacy and use Botany Knowledge. 2 quick heals and a couple of skill check misses incase of Freddy.
---
Ah well, there's plenty of people who will be more then willing to help
---
that is from the 2003 movie, Leatherface in game is the 1974 OG Leatherface but I agree the chili boi needs his own map and cosmetics
---
I mean it would even it back out for killers and survivors.
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light.
---
Well there was absolutely nothing he could do 
---
It was either jump in and get stabbed 
---
Or have the hatch closed
---
Well I kinda figured you were saying the leak didn't show everything so we could have a survivor. Kind of didn't about the other things. But yeah I get your point just still seems we aren't getting one. I think they just don't have all his perks coded and that's why they weren't there so technically it did show everything that we could see.
---
I do a lot of streaming, dont need viruses ;) I'll look into it though thanks.
---
You do got a point, but the problem MoM is the fact sometimes you can’t use the perk. Don’t get me wrong, it’s useful against all killers with M1 swing. But Billies, LF, Huntress and legion and probably more? Can either one shot down, reduce your health state by one without a normal attack (Feral Frenzy, Hatcher and chainsaw. Or one shot t3 attack from Myers giving you one point for MoM. Decisive Strike became a anti tunnel perk, its suppose to be a 2nd chance since the killer is tunneling you. Or trying to get you killed out of the game first. Counter to that is just to not tunnel that person or use enduring? And as with Unfettered honestly Idk. Since we can’t see it in play tbh.
---
Not that it matters, but contractions are counted as proper English, so aren't counted as slang
---
Hahabahahab. Im dead.
---
No, not once, but i did buy all the dlc so maybe thats why i've never seen them
---
np its in the firefox store
---
Damn he got you OP. Better uninstall.
---
That happened today to me too, I hope they put in the boot to the face perk this sub put up
---
I dunno man, I doubt they'd have everything absolutely ready with 5 weeks to spare. We'll end up seeing, but I really, really doubt it's a paragraph.
---
Ah well, if it is, guess we get Ghostface early.
---
ok fair enough
---
Playa: Your homies always got you. Upon being hooked, if the killer is 1m or closer to you for 110 seconds, the Crips come and shoot the killer dead.
---
*"Hell yeah you undead fucker." - Bling Bling Jackson*
---
AYAYAYAYAYAY
---
What if they release 2 pargraphs to make up for no chapter?
---
Nice
---
Bring a key
---
Haha I like it
---
Yeah I hope I'm wrong honestly just alot of evidence points towards it only being ghostface
---
nah I don't think I changed anything except the level of my nurse's calling
---
The only toxic person I saw there was you talking to your friends...
---
Absolutely no chance. The fanbase would riot. Besides, they've already made their bed by stating they're bringing a new chapter every 3 months.
---
Ok am I blind? Can't find him
---
How can you use a phone in the realms what is he gonna message the other killers or something?
---
Not the most toxic. As the last survivor, I had a nurse with enduring keep picking me up and dropping me to let me get off, then quick Blink and hit me back down. Lasted 5 or 6 minutes.
---
I don't really know anything about Ghostface, so what's with the selfie thing for the mori? Is the killer supposed to be a teen or something?
---
So what you're saying is Scary movie ghost face has a chance. Well shit time to go broke
---
You seem to get upset easily. You made the situation appear worse for yourself than it actually is.
---
Saw 2 and 3 were good. The rest after were shit
---
Best thing for doctor would be the impossible skill checks build. If you run that with The Game and terror radius add-ons then the doctor is a nightmare to play against.
---
Rarely does a person being hooked gets out or if they do then someone else is dying. If the killer has STBFL then there's no way everyone is getting out. I'd rather keep my 312 medkit from Pharmacy then save a random I have no coordination or attachment to.
---
When you realize killer has prayer beads
---
WAH
---
Me: WAHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Do screams knock survivors from doing totems? Because holy shit I would love to do that.
---
Ash voice lines are annoying, it’s basically like npc talking smth in gta San Andreas, nonsense and random
---
I mean, I WAS standing still. He could've just knocked me down and waited.
---
And he didn't have to "Fuck me" either
---
Im pretty sure enduring doesnt work when you wiggle free.
---
Unfettered was built in mind to be the sole counter for Memento Mori, while also preventing you from taking a hook if no Mori was present.
---
???
---
It's not a glitch.
---
reminds me of the thing
---
I'm not gonna say i'm sure, but it could work that way
---
Considering that it's Ghostface, it's a possibility that there could be several skins for them with different characters, a la Legion.
---
Although, they might keep that as Legion's gimmick and make only one Ghostface.
---
As a developer that's had coworkers push code to wrong branches, seen dev ops guys *repeatedly* screw up deployments, I can totally buy that these were accidents. We're a huge enterprise SaaS company, too . It's surprisingly easy to have happen, even twice in a row, if you don't have the appropriate controls in place.
---
That was dirty
---
It still Triggers a trap and lets you Teleport to it, which it was NOT doing.
---
Maybe read the post before trying to diss me for no reason?
---
The bigger the radius the better. You spark also can cancel out flashlights and vaulting. Its nice to get a hit in or cancel a vault. You pretty much slow the game down people will just hide in lockers to avoid screamming and giving you location away. Thats why i personally run iron maidden because people freak out and cant avoid me wirhout a punishment. The doctor is the most annoying killer to play against hands down even when people were saying no its legion i was like nah man give me legion over doc any day. But just maintain a large radius and cjeck lockers. I would recomend Unnerving, ruin, distressing and  iron maidden.
---
I’m not an idiot. Read the post again maybe?
---
Sounds like some serious potential for jumpscaring people.
---
There are all sorts of audio glitches. It’ll prob be broken more next patch. :) 
---
Hooking a survivor: get a hook sound after the animation is complete. 
---
Survivor gets off the hook: the hook still has the slimy entity sounds. (This one is seriously distracting and sucks)
---
It used to at least. Not sure now. That was when decisive was lessened with it.
---
What's it's purpose tho
---
I really wouldn't mind a sawyer family house from Texas Chainsaw, have the main house and downstairs filled with meat hooks and all kinds of bodies all over the place, and a field/ forest outside
---
Survivor
---
* Take hits
---
* Don't teabag
---
* Don't dc
---
* Don't farm
---
* If i fuck up then i take the attention of the killer.
---
* Never leave a hooked survivor behind even if noed is active.
---
Killer
---
* Let survivors who were farmed flee and attack the unhooker.
---
* Let people escape if 2 or more people dc/don't connect.
---
Both
---
* No toxicity, only positivity.
---
*Return the slaaaab*
---
There is acuallty plenty of evdience they didnt get the full liseance. Why do you think Ghostface doesnt have his cloak and there are a lot of tweets with Fun world only. 
---
As for two, maybe it is. 
---
What we saw as horribly unfinished anyway./
---
Killers can’t attack in the elevator, so the killer and survivor just sit there waiting for the next floor to resume the chase
---
It would've just taken longer downing you. If you don't want this happening then get some good teammates, bring a key, or just don't play.
---
Havent played dbd since the spirit update can someone explain why the floor looks like lava?
---
Yeah I noticed the entity sounds when I passed by hooks, was kinda creeping me out tbh haha
---
Right in front of them, just the top of his head.
---
It's entirely probable, The Devs confirmed in a lore-stream the killers do hang out in their home realm between trials and catch glimpses of eachother when they are traveling through the fog.
---
They arn't allowed to come into contact with eachother since most of them are mindless killing machines and since the killers *can* die it would be a pain to have them ripping eachother apart constantly, but there is a period where they are left to their own devices.
---
Nice booty jiggle
---
I didn't diss you or downvoted anything you posted lol.
---
It bothers me mostly because it’s harder to hear other things. It’s loud enough to mute rustling grass.
---
I've played with a couple people who would run around and mark all of the generators and then drop it for someone else so they can do them. Aside from that I guess you can use them to find totems, but honestly they're really only good for getting some free points for marking hooks.
---
I bet he reported you for hacking. Lol. I’m loving videos like this.
---
that's actually pretty sick
---
Power: Crow's Wrath. The killer summons a murder of crows. If you hit a survivor with your power, crows swarm them, pecking away at them. It slows them down by 3%, and forces them to scream every few seconds until they shrug them off, which takes 5 seconds. (all these times and percentages vary with add ons)
---
Perks:
---
Murderous Glee: Their suffering delights you. Every time you hook a survivor, gain a token, up to 3.
---
Every time you hit a survivor with a token, you lose one token, and the survivors repair, cleansing, and door opening speeds is reduced by 5/10/15%. The survivors speed returns to normal after 60/80/100 seconds.
---
Darkness Falls: Everytime a generater is completed, each survivor suffers from Blindess for 30/40/50 seconds.
---
False Hope: When all gens are powered, for 60 seconds, all survivors move 2/3/4% slower
---
I dont think it would be. Just copy paste the outfit and throw some blood on them.
---
All the files needed already exist
---
IF YOURE THE LAST ONE LEFT AND STILL HAVE TO OPEN A GATE, HOW DOES IT MATTER IF IT ONE SHOTS YOU OR NOT, THEYRE NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE TO OPEN THE GATE
---
I HATE WHEN THE SURVIVORS ALL BRING BLOODPOINT OFFERINGS AND THAT ONE TOXIC BILLY BITCH BRINGS A MORI WITH RUIN AND TUNNELS YOUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
No this is supposed to be now. I’ve experienced it a few times. Game is just ass lmao
---
Just reminds me of the Death Knight Animation from Lineage. Lol
---
I think this is great, but maybe make chest o laughs more likely to proc? Then again, i ain't exactly got the best judgement (LIKE THE DEVS)
---
Well it would be alright if I got the add-ons + my green mori (I used specifically to get footage) back and if I wouldn't have depiped because of it
---
I've been waiting for this.
---
just made a [pst about that they better fix it soon lol
---
I fear no man but that, that thing it scares me.
---
Still plays the same for the most part.
---
virtually any build is viable on him
---
though i find the basic m1 killer build with enduring and spirit fury pointless and hard when you can arguably play against pallets
---
a good starter build would be ruin/overcharge/distressing/unnerving 
---
once you get the hang of him you can do more creative builds like my personal favorite of ruin/haunted/bbq/perk of choice with calm addons and maybe an electrode
---

Okay: may i ask if any of you know either the sArAcAsM font or saracasm in it's entirety?
---
Yea sure. Let's go with that.
---
All of you lack culture, Bikini Leatherface is where it's at!
---
Jeff is a simple man
---
Doesn't that make her more terrifying? You hear that noise thinking "Oh shit, the killer's a Canadian goose" but then you see Spirit come around the corner and go into a panic thinking "Where the hell is the Canadian goose at?" so the rest of the game you're darting your eyes from one side to another watching out for the hidden second killer in the lobby knowing that the moment you stop looking for it, it'll get you.
---
All I care about is Robert Englund Freddy );
---
Is this new?
---
I was playing on Ormond yesterday and the Quentin I was doing a gen with probably thought I was insane, I kept walking near a hook nearby because it sounded kinda like the fire sound totems make.
---
There was also one for Dwight, Feng, Huntress, Wraith, and another Tapp along with the other 2 pig cosmetics
---
Why would you people downvote a thank you! You Monsters!
---
The power sucks. 15's? Then you also have to wait 45's? Not worth it.
---
It would be really cool if there was a phone mechanic in the game that would call survivors to revel their location. They would have to shut off off to prevent the killer from hearing them
---
Is this it?
---
If you believe that you don't play nurse. Prediction is what makes you a good nurse, blinking to where the survivors will be. 
---
Being able to blink to where a survivor is now is how you get doubled back on and run around like an idiot for 5 gens.
---
Damn, you'll be done just shortly after my internet explorer has loaded the frontpage!
---
Nope
---
It's entirely possible that the sweatiness could stay the same or even get worse but at least we won't get nearly as many DC's and there will actually be reason to get to high ranks.
---
The bottom two are immensely more doable than the top two as they wouldn't require licensing. Just saying.
---
&gt; I try so hard.
---
And got so far, but in the end.....
---
It doesn't even matter.
---
which is what they didn't want. Combined with the hatch closing this becomes a no win scenario for anyone with a trap on their head. Them dying to the trap wasn't going to be the issue, them being stuck in the EGC with literally no way out was the issue, unless they got extremely lucky and got the trap off on the first or second box and were near a door and didn't have the killer nearby they would be doomed.
---
In the scenario that's no more, the equivalent now is you down the survivor during end game and just hook them, there's a lot less of a chance someone is going for the save due to the strict timer, and if they do the EGC is actually short enough to where you can still easily stall long enough to get them killed if they are careless enough without having to hook them. People are upset because now the kill isn't 110% guaranteed with the trap instead of basically 90% guaranteed.
---
An abandoned mall is my dream map to be honest
---
Thank you so much, omg. I was high key hoping that someone would start singing this, hahah.
---
Hmm, how about effects lasting 20 seconds and only having a 30 second downtime?
---
My bad. I didn't mean to post the link to my post in r/LeaksbyDaylight   
---
Instead, have the link to the [Imgur album.](https://imgur.com/a/kE4x06X)
---
I'm partial to buttdance nowadays anyway
---
Do you have a screenshot of them?
---
Do you happen to have screenshots of those?
---
Context?
---
More terrifying? I say nay. More like traumatizing
---
Not from a Trapper...
---
Not too long ago, the guy who owns the rights to Condemned: Criminal Origins was looking to do more with it and the mall level in that was sick

I really enjoy the game a lot, it's just the people that are toxic and you're right if there's a killer on the map its camping.
---
I meant that it would explain the teabag, in the moment.
---
The selfie is fantastic, worth playing the killer for that alone.
---
He had some more and the prestige, ill post when I get home :)
---
LEGION IS STILL FUCKING CANCER. THEY'RE STILL MENDING/SELF CARING SIMULATOR ONLY NOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SELF CARE.
---
DOESN'T HELP THAT PEOPLE DON'T HEAL AGAINST LEGION BECAUSE "THEY CAN'T HIT ME NORMALLY THEY'RE 110% MS 4HEAD." ALSO HELPS THAT PEOPLE DON'T RUN BORROWED TIME EVER AND STILL GO FOR FACE UNHOOKS, AND THEN WONDER WHY THEIR TEAMMATES DC.
---
Yeah I've gotten accused of hook camping because a survivor looped me right next to the hook rather than running away to give the teammates a chance to save the survivor. Its dumb. Just give a gg and queue up again.
---
The only thing I think holding Jason back is yea his own game. I think Ghostface proves that similarity to another character doesn't mean that character cant be in the game.
---
True, true.
---
.
---
But still, no bulli. :(
---
Is this real? I havent been on dbd or r/deadbydaylight in forever and i see alot of comments talking about the phone and shit (please go easy on my, im oblivious to anything going on wii dbd)
---
I was rushing when making this one, ill post a better, up close later
---
Hey Mikey and Amanda, thanx for teaching me the ropes,
---
Love Ghostface
---
Death is not an escape because everybody just uses the exit gates when it's a Freddy, right?
---
Looks awesome though, what program did you use?
---
Amazing.
---
It's almost like Legion is based on Ghostface.
---
Why is wraiths face looking like a vagina
---
Also theres an arrow next to the endgame chat. If you click it you cant see chat anymore. Good of you dont want to risk seeing toxicity. If youre on console theres a way to turn the chat off there too, though i dont know the specifics.

thank you kind redditor
---
Legion players deserve tbags
---
It's like a bunch of branches sticking out of his face
---
Should’ve been “If you are the last survivor, you open the exit gates 5% faster for each gen remaining.” This way it works as a niche wake up alternative, as it gives 10% if all gens are done and 35% if none are.
---
Lmao get outside chief
---
That's dumb, it's their fault, and it's what I try and do.
---
Did people find a new way to get killer powers on different killers? I remember giving Myers a chainsaw in SWF it was funny af.
---
I'm on PC thanks for the tip!
---
Still looks like a vagina which kinda makes me wanna buy it just because of that

---
Yes, but being able to close hatch removes the previous no-win situation where you need to find the survivor before they get too close to the hatch. 
---
Closing it now powers gates, yes, but there's one survivor that has two minutes to open a gate that takes 30 seconds, and if they get spotted they're dead. It's a lot more killer favored now, which is fair IMO.
---
In stark contrast, after I absolutely slaughter a group of survivors I’ll look through this in hopes that one of them makes a post about it 
---
But I’ll stay away from here after a bad game
---
It makes me estatic to see how creative these are getting, but thank god people got to it before I did, considering all the big leaks started a day ago, I didn't think it was likely all this content would still be hidden. Praise neon Joey. I've been dying for him to have an alt forever.
---
Didnt watch the show but it's based off the show version
---
A dude on top of another dude? That’s pretty gay if you think about it
---
/s
---
Agreed, the game is much better of everyone plays nice, but toxicity getting answered with toxicity is common and understandable.
---
On release (at least when it hits the PTB) I'd be curious to see how Object of Obsession interacts with his ability.
---
Didn't fix the 2.6 DC issue so it's still unplayable as killer :(
---
I like him
---
If the lag is constantly there the whole match it's terrible internet. If they hit you from across the map and only happens when they losing it's lag switching. Hackings well just obvious if they're faster then normal.
---
The last stab and twist made me cringe in pain, looks cool though.
---
Sloppy, bbq, ruin, nurses. Replace sloppy and nurse with spirit fury and enduring if you want.
---
Oink
---
I fucking love it. I’m hella fucking hyped for this. Definitely gonna be my new main when they come out.
---
Lag and terrible internet is just kinda random unfortunate glitches, choppy movements, or getting hit weirdly. Lag switching is a DISTINCT spike in lag EVERY time when the killer is in a chase or about to get a hit. If it's lag switching, you will KNOW it's lag switching. It's very obvious.
---
Legion was always low tier, but considering I can play him for an evening, with roughly the same effectiveness as before, and not get messages telling me I should kill myself? 
---
Well, I’d say he’s better than before
---
If I can’t make it to a locker in time when the killer has BBQ I always teabag with good intentions
---
I hope you get permabanned.
---
Until you find out the chili is made of humans
---
It really does feel like that when the ground starts shaking and all!
---
Unlike a lot of others he didn’t have a flipping motion on the survivor
---
oh I love silent hill 3
---
&gt;what builds do you use/see having viability on him (no more bloodhound I'm assuming, stuff like that)
---
I've been using Discordance (or Ruin), Monitor &amp; Abuse, A Nurse's Calling, and BBQ &amp; Chili. 
---
&gt;do I still go around trying to tag as many survivors during killer instinct then go after the last one, like he was desgined? Or is there a better way? Basically how do I want to play him over the course of the match.
---
That's still the general idea. Feral Frenzy &gt; hit survivor(s) &gt; get close again using Feral Frenzy's increased movement speed &gt; cancel Feral Frenzy (don't hit them twice) &gt; M1. 
---
&gt;and which add ons to stock up on/go after in the bloodweb? From what I can tell, fatigue reduction add ons seem like the best add ons by a mile. But again, maybe I'm wrong. 
---
Cooldown add-ons seem to be the best.
---
Can yall stop posting this video every day?
---
What the hell have they done to Dwight

Still wholesome. Bubba just wants to feed his ma and paw like a good son.

Tapp skin holy shit

Ugh...there goes my wallet.

Hey, Legion, I know ya ripped off my design but for fucks sake I am NOT interested in joining your pansy ass edge cult. KTHXBAITTYLNOT
---
Love, Ghostface
---
No. Deliverance's 100% chance is static.
---
Why can't a "horror" game add gore
---
Really thought he'd have lines in game too. Like a "Ah shit" when a generator blows or a "you're alright kid!" when he's healing something.
---
I really like Micheal
---
Each skill check is replaced with a tetris minigame

Careful, dont want to make her OP.

Haha, I can see that! Have you ever found a post? :)
---
Why did you start doing these?
---
Can you link that? I would love to read it as they sounds cool af
---
Moris deserve privacy, too
---
Very curious, thanks for the info!
---
This comment scares me
---
What's the counterplay?
---
His name from the series is ghostface, his I game name is the ghost, and he was best known from the movie scream, but I’m pretty sure this version is from the show
---
Started with a reformat of the Drake meme using Ace with fingerguns
---
People liked it, so I did a "Day 2" and just sort of kept going from there. I hoped it would give myself good exposure for when I get into animating.
---
"Surviors t-bag so lets be toxic back :)" I dont condone either one. Can we just play the game and be nice?  I have never t-bagged a killer unless they face camped and we still escaped but ive had killers do similar things to me and it doesnt feel good when you weren't even hoping for hatch once you've been caught. Like can I move on to my next game please? thanks
---
Console players could never!
---
*cries in ps4*
---
What's the counterplay? A survivor could easily get 3 tokens and be unkillable.
---
Legion Sans just wants survivors to DC so they can't complete a genocide run, so he's actually a hero
---
Thank you!
---
Unfortunately no, one day though...
---
Those are on purpose tbh.  You don't fuck up this much otherwise.
---
Which makes sense, as it makes us build our own hype and they have to do basically dick.
---
I have to admit, you lost me there.
---
Shits you right. That's why he spazes out when he doesn't hit anything with his chainsaw, he just wants to make damn ass chili.
---
So, my email is longer than the box allows (only gets to .c instead of .com) I think increasing the length allowed would be a good idea. Overall, for someone lacking in web design, the site looks well made.
---
I FUCKING GET HOOKED FIRST EVERY FUCKING GAME DAMNIT
---
EGC IN GENERAL, WHILE AN AMAZING CONCEPT AT FIRST, KIND OF SUCKS IN PRACTICE. 
---
KILLER SLAMS HATCH ON LONE REMAINING SURVIVOR AND PATROLS TWO UNOPENED EXITS. THERE'S NO WAY FOR SURVIVOR TO ESCAPE. I HAD THIS SHIT ON THE GAME EARLIER AND THEY JUST RAN BACK AND FORTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE CAMPING THE EXITS.
---
AND THEN THE GUY WHO JUST STRAIGHT UP WOULDN'T DOWN THE SURV AND BODYBLOCKED THE SWITCHES UNTIL TIME RAN OUT.
---
EGC IS AN OPEN INVITATION FOR KILLERS TO BE MASSIVE DICKS. WHICH I GUESS MUST BE PAYBACK FOR SURVIVORS TBAGGING FOREVER. STILL SUCKS.
---
Apparently stab wounds hurt far longer than bullets because the knife isn't as hot, so when a bullet pierces through you it "Cleans up" a bit of the wound going through, but a stab?  That shit hurts forever, not only because it is messy trajectory coming in and out, but also because it is a raw wound.
---
And in other fun, pain facts:  If you get a glass shard in you, don't remove it yourself as there is a very high chance that when you remove it you will do so sloppily \[Pain, etc\] and that could prick another part of your body you need.  If something hurt going in it'll hurt coming out, too, but that "Out" could kill you.
---
Hes supposed to be some who sky dives but I don't know what they did with his hair
---
Didnt they say chapter? Therefore it has to be more than just the mask rights
---
Not the biggest fan of multiple floors, but still willing to see how it would work out.
---
YOU GUYS, I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, PLAYING AT HIGH RANKS SUCKS. I'M SO TIRED OF THE SAME BULLSHIT NURSES/BILLYS WITH THE SAME PERKS AND LEGIONS JUST BEING SHITHEADS.
---
IT'S NOT EVEN FUN. I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE DERANK. WITH NO INCENTIVE TO BE HIGH RANK IT'S JUST TORTURE FACING THE SAME DUMB BULLSHIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
---
Not a fan of the huge ass glasses but I’m happy he’s got a cop outfit now.
---
I honestly don't, because it's about 50/50 of seeing "ggs", "ggwp", "Had fun", "Glhf in future games", and "&lt;3", and I live to see this community do it.
---
Definitely not lag switching from what I see started having a little jitter at the start and seemed like he was lagging also usually lag switching only messes with the survivor while killer acts completely fine. So yeah pretty sure he just has bad connection
---
Well I hope it pays off! The templates are wonderful!
---
How about NO. 
---
No gate regression. Good lord that’s a horrible idea. That only punished BOTH teammates.
---
Yee
---
10,000 IQ
---
Yeah I didn't want to assume the worst as he turned out to be kind. 
---
Also the problem persisted from start to finish so I figured it must be overall lag problem than switching on his end.
---
“It’s not gay unless the balls touch.”
---
—Leatherface
---
He was never good tier, he was just annoying to play against while beeing weak in the same time.
---
He is in a good spot right now I would say, with his power you get pretty much free hits and after that you can chse them down with your 115% movementspeed just like any other M1 killer. That alone makes him better than other M1 killers like Wraith, Freddy or Trapper.
---
Also you can get much easier mutliple hits within 1 frenzy now, which slows down the game a lot, the survivors have to mend and might want to heal.
---
The only thing I would like to be changes is the vaulting speed, its way too slow now.
---
He probably has some games or social media to use while in the loading screen.
---
It really isnt
---
To me it's the opposite. :(
---
Looks so blurry in PC
---
If the rank is unimportant to you, then don't be sweaty, take your derank/depip, an enjoy more chill lobbies.
---
You wasted a whole 45 seconds staring at him
---
That’s the problem we did but 2 of our teammates got hit at the same time
---
&gt;You pretty much exemplify the "entitled player" template who thinks that everyone else should cater to them by defending drastic solutions to something that's not even a problem.
---
It is a hitbox change so that way that shit doesn't happen, but because you can't hold someone down because they may or may not be in BT is somehow "Drastic?"
---
I don't think you understand how minor of a change this is.  We are talking about a slight increase in width so you can not be stuck while a killer decides who to slug.  Basement is already strong and you are acting like Chicken fucking Little.
---
Also
---
&gt;I kind of held back at first, tried to just have a reasonable disagreement but like a lot of survivor mains, you have a derangement over things like this, like it's some kind of genuinely widespread issue and you come out swinging with the crappy insults because you have no ground to stand on.
---
You didn't do that, and that is self evident in what you wrote.  You are trying to defend something that is toxic because Basement should be strong, *even though* Basement is still just as strong as it was before.
---
that'd be fun honestly
---
It’s bizarre that it’s “show” Ghostface, but they’re using the mask from the movies
---
It's that auto aim hitbox bs.
---
Okay, believe what you want bud
---
Yeah, there is no cellular signal I think. The Entity will need to buy some cell towers and provide LTE at least, if not 5G.
---
Itd be so amusing to have a limited time event mode with the entity grip slipping and 2 killers cross paths fighting each other and the survivors. Not that it'd be well balanced at alllll but it'd be sweet chaos to be a survivor trying to stay alive and seeing killers duking it out. 
---
Like the shape picking up legion and stabbing the shit out of them. Or wraith uncloaking behind the plague right as she's about to puke on someone. Or pig jumping on someone stuck in a trappers bear trap.
---
You like head cheese?
---
Wait, if Dwight is dead, then he must have broken one of the rules, and we know he doesn’t drink and he doesn’t do drugs, meaning he must have gotten laid!
---
IT’S ALL PART IF A VERY SIMPLE FORMULA, PEOPLE!
---
Plus billy is based off of leatherface
---
I wonder if he also has a phone charger ?
---
Claudette, Meg, Feng, and Kate get those, why not Quentin?
---
Yes
---
Yeah lag switching is way more abrupt and sketchy so yeah dude just had bad internet
---
K
---
Yo i do this everytime I get lampkin as Trapper lmfao.
---
Glad to see others do it too, sometimes you just gotta have fun
---
removed for not having anything to do with dead by daylight
---
.....
---
Can we fookin stop with the "He's very similar" shite?
---
We had Hillbilly, then we got Leatherface.
---
We had Legion, now we're getting Ghostface.
---
We have Clown, and I'd bet my left testicle that we're gonna get Pennywise by years end.
---
Jason could very easily be done if the Devs wanted, I'm sure they've got 20 ideas floating around and are just waiting for the go ahead on figuring out which one would work.
---
End game collapse garbage patch. Survivors get the gate open and can escape? LOL TOO BAD YOU LOSE AND THE KILLER GETS SACRIFICE POINTS.. Playing survivor after this patch couldn't feel more punishing.
---
It's definitely not based on the show. The show is completely different and the killer in the show doesn't resemble the one in the movies at all.
---
u/zombiehuggerr
---
When Jason comes to the game, you know what to do.
---
You both were probably really *tired* after that.
---
NO JOKE I LITERALLY JUST ESCAPED FROM A TOXIC AF HUNTRESS WHO PRETENDED TO FARM WITH ME AS LAST SURVIVOR THEN SLAMMED HATCH ON ME AND TRIED TO KILL ME, DEAD HARDED A SWING AND ESCAPED THEN I RAN TO ONE DOOR AND FAST VAULTED A BUNCH AND GOT OUT THROUGH THE OTHER DOOR. 
---
EGC STILL SUCKS THOUGH NOT A FAN RIGHT NOW. MAKES THE “END GAME” RIDICULOUSLY KILLER SIDED, GG HAG JUST TRAPS BOTH DOORS, HUNTRESS STANDS IN BETWEEN. PLS CHANGE SOMETHING DEVS.
---
You won't get banned for using something that just presses a button repeatedly for you. Unless if it is exploiting something, which in this case it is not.
---
The common add-ons for the map are worse
---
&gt;tired
---
Dad? Is that you?
---
It's been confirmed that it's Killer Only this time around.
---
Well, the Fog Whisperer could be lying to cover BHVR, but that seems less likely.
---
I don't think you understand that this is a survivor problem, not a perk problem
---
NOED is not overpowered because survivors never want to cleanse totems, that's a problem with the survivors being underpowered. Everyone has the ability to destroy totems and nobody does it because they're so focused on gens
---
Same :(
---
Don't forget it is an acronym to "Most Effective Tactics Avaliable"
---
that is literally what it means. EGC makes traps redundant because it fulfills the role of killing you outright if you don't escape, faster than a trap even, the only difference is you aren't held back and forced to die like it would've been with the trap. I'm not taking a grammar lesson from some random person on Reddit who can't grasp definitions himself. Good day.
---
Since they’re using a phone, I’m imagining the killer and survivor will be based off Scream 4? I was hoping for young Neve Campbell and Billy or Stu to be the killer :(
---
THEN LEARN TO PLAY AGAINST HIM AND STOP YOUR BITCHING
---
STUPID MOTHERFUCKING DIPSHIT TEAMMATES GOD FUCKING DAMN I LOOP THE KILLER FOR 6 AND A HALF MINUTES AROUND THE ENTIRE MAP AND YOU POP ONE RUINLESS GEN JUST AS I GO DOWN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU EVEN DOING SHIT I'M FUCKING RUNNING AROUND TAKING THIS DUMB MOTHERFUCKER ON A SIGHTSEEING TOUR AND YOU'RE JUST CROUCHING IN A CORNER SNIFFING THE FUCKING WALL OR SOMETHING JESUS CHRIST AND THEN I GET HOOKED AND YOU LITERALLY LET ME GO FROM MY FIRST HOOK TO BEING SACRIFICED BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO SCARED TO GET ME AND THEN HAVE THE AUDACITY TO DC AS SOON AS YOU GET DOWNED THE FIRST TIME WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE FUCKING TUTORIAL OR BETTER YET GO PLAY NINTENDOGS INSTEAD YOU COMPLETE AND TOTAL BRAINLETS
---
The original picture makes me think of some kind of dark comedy where Adam is the main character and the Clown is a some crazy demon that just follows him around for some reason. I think it would be kinda funny.
---
So i've never seen scream, I only know about him from scary movie, but uh what's with the phone? Is this the legit mori?

---
There's sounds labeled as both Stlth_KLR_Activate, which would be for the killer as you describe, and Stlth_SVR_Activate, which could only be a sound cue for the survivors to hear.
---
Feng mins outfit and huntress's is a copp
---
Its a mix. Has the original mask and has the new ones clothes
---
3 YEARS OF PAYBACK. SUCK IT, JABRONI
---
I would love there to be a 1v1v4 gamemode where 2 killers compete to see how many survivors they can sacrifice while the survivors (with 3 spawns each) try to escape using the generators.
---
I'd be fine with letting saves go through in mid of the animation as long as killers get a buff to compensate, or other nerf to survivors.
---
A 1998 flip phone with pull out antenna is modern?
---
I played against Trapper who found the hatch first. I jumped in while he was setting up traps. I guess he missed the memo.

Better yet: I'm hatch standoffs you play imessage beer pong with the survivor
---
Huntress be looking like a cross between Punk Rock/Mid sacrifice cult leader
---
Just noticed the "SVR" means survivor
---
MAKING PLAYERS HATE YOUR GAME IS THE BEST WAY TO RETAIN YOUR PLAYER BASE
---
I had something similar happen. I was a survivor trying to get another survivor to leave with me after the killer closed the hatch, but I had to bail at the last stage. I spectated him just in time to see the Entity mori him on the hatch
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my god the people bitching about a character that isn't finished is really getting on my nerves
---
We are Getting the Ghostface Killer, licenced by the owner of the iconic look
---
Its been confirmed by a fog whisperer who went to bevhr HQ it's going to be a standalone killer DLC
---
unless they can get the licence from the SCREAM owners for the survivor side

Dude you talk like a fucking asshole regardless of what this dude did. Such attitude

Why do I read this like some posh British kid?

Glad I'm not the only one. Burst out laughing while the family was asleep.

LOL.   
---
Look at this person trying to take a high ground when they have no clue what the fuck redundant means. 
---
Redundancies are built into systems all the fucking time. From gaming to engineering. It stops stuff from failing (engineering/coding) or gives players variety (gaming).  The Traps would not force the player to die in the EGC.  Players could still have hatch escaped or if they got lucky, got the trap off at literally the first jigsaw box (which does happen).  Or you know, find the hatch and escape through it still. She was a piss tier killer before the EGC and with this change remains a piss tier killer after. Removing the active bear traps at the endgame was removing one of her **selling points that** **BHVR ADVERTISED HER ABOUT.** And still advertise about on a few of the DLC store pages. 
---
Saying the The traps were redundant means half the perks in the game that provide the same function shouldn't exist since they cover the same function and thus are redundant.
---
If there's gonna be a Survivior it's likely gonna be Sydney Prescott. Honest to God I was surprised we didn't get Sally for The Leatherface DLC
---
Yes. The very first scene in the first movie has Ghostface using a cellphone to taunt a girl.
---
"It sounded better in my head" Trapper
---
Here’s a link to where the 80% thing is clarified: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjzbi5/data_sheets_community_requests/emf6bzr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Oh yeah. I guess that was sort of the premise of the entire film series wasn’t it.
---
Well exhaustion perks take 40/50/60 seconds to cooldown and that's if you don't sprint. So yea, the team must've been just letting him stare at them for an entire exhaustion perk cooldown duration. So like everyone else said, bad team. Better luck running spine chill next time.
---
NO THANKS
---
Get out of here with your puns
---
Neither Sally, nor Sydney, died in the films though, and the Entity has a thing for taking in survivors from the brink of death
---
Honestly I would be all in favor of turning base gen time up somewhere from 90 to 100, removing the totem, part of ruin and making it a normal perk that says 
---
Increase generator charges by 10/20/30 and possibly add for each sacrificed survivor, decrease generator charges by 2/4/5 that way gens remain long to finish without being impossible.
---
At ruin 3 it would take 2 minutes or more to do a single gen which I'm okay with.  
---
My problem with ruin is it punishes  players for bad teammates. If someone decides to look for ruin instead of doing gens, it could cost them the entire game.
---
Not only that, but I play on a large television which has a delay. If I really want to try hard, I can hit most great skill checks, but not everyone can.
---
Laurie?
---
Agreed. I use to use feral frenzy to keep up with survivors using sprint burst, lithe or balanced landing and swipe once I'm close to them and hit them. Now these needs are making the game more for the survivors and not fun for a killer.
---
That's not really true. Her standing animation gets a bit more fucked up when she's phasing. That's why the passive phasing add-ons are a thing.
---
Used to be Pig until this update. Now it's Spirit.
---
It was one of the episodes from the Training Camp arc. Can't remember which one.
---
Step 4: Profit
---
I'm just asking sheesh
---
Legend has it they are still doing it to this day
---
It would probably bring out more toxic shit talk than it would "funny moments.". Getting looped is annoying enough without the idea of someone vocally taunting you the entire time.  Or a killer that can shit talk while they're face camping or tunneling.  
---
Half the reason I enjoy the game is because I don't have to listen to anyone while I'm playing it.
---
That selfie reminds me of Cassie Cage.
---
Adrenaline, Iron Will, Balanced Landing/Dead Hard and Bond/Spine Chill. Sometimes I change something else for spine chill.
---
Didn't know that about the stat recording. But if that were to hold true, then wouldnt the survivial rating of rank 1 be 100%. If failure to survive always results in a depip and the record is taken after the match resolve, then by that logic, all rank 1 survivors will have survived their last match. This would mean it would be impossible for the stat to go below 100% because if someone in rank 1 was to die, then your ranking would drop to rank 2. And this would be the same across all platforms because, at rank 1, you don't hold any earned pips at that rank. (Unless the devs have changed that?)
---
Try watching the movies instead of clips, might be better “educational” material.
---
Lot of killers just not kill us and would knock us on the ground making survivors wait for the damn end game to finish wasting time. Or killers closing the hatch then taking us to it to drop us on it and starts just spamming hit instead of just hooking and getting it over with
---
Precisely, so since it doesn't matter, don't let something with no meaning cause you disdain.
---
I.E. his high rank matches are sweaty an he doesn't like it, since rank has no meaning, take your losses an get better quality matches an enjoy the game again.
---
So this is DVD related, but mine wasn't. Gotcha
---
Phones were a huge part of the character. Dk about selfies though.
---
I ALREADY COMMENTED IN HERE BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THING, I THINK THE PLAGUE IS FUCKING DUMB AND NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED.
---
Do you always run those perks or were you trying for Adept Quentin?
---
I like the perks. The power is a neat idea, but I think you can do better with some more interesting buffs that aren't the standard statuses. You could move those status into add-ons.
---
Hit the T-spin or say goodbye to your gen progress
---
True but I believe everyone wants Great Knife Pyramid Head if he actually were to be released. That's his trademark look. Still, either way, if he made it into DBD and if any of the silent hill survivors made it in along with him, woo, it's definitely gonna cause a commotion.
---
The previous Solo DLCs were considered a CHAPTER 
---
Ash
---
LeatherFace
---
Yes also Ash was also called a Chapter
---
Yeah.... that’s...., that’s the weird outlier, so I guess it’s not off the table..?
---
Woah. Tapp’s skin on the left was a huge boner.
---
Thi
---
Now that's comedy
---
The opposite of a toxic lets go
---
Did Quentin die in NOES?
---
He called me a fool? Lmfao
---
Same its annoying
---
Like the Adam cosmetics
---
Is the middle-top one a legion?
---
Good
---
I thought I was missing something really obvious
---
Or maybe I was baked even though I should technically be working?
---
^Idontreallygethighatworkifyoureseeingthisboss
---
Anyone else get that awful audio glitch with the Doctor where the killer theme is sometimes replaced with one sound channel that's way louder than normal, and sometimes the chase theme cuts in and out like someone keeps hitting pause and play?  It's so loud it scares the crap out of me when the killer is the Doctor.
---
I need to be working too.
---
Oof.
---
It’s probably not based on any movie. The biggest speculation right now is that they only got the license for the mask and not the movie and that it will be a Ghostface with a brand new original identity and backstory. It’s looking more and more likely that there will be no survivor too.
---
I would love my wifey Jill though
---
Yeah actual lagging is more random teleports you throughout the game while lag switching is where  right when you are gonna go through a window or pallet the game freezes all together and they hit or down you and hacking is when they are moving noticeably faster
---
^shirtlessleatherface
---
F U C K  A R O U N D F I N D O U T
---
Watch the films! Especially the first one, it's masterful.
---
By the time you cleanse every totem on the map, the killer has already hooked around 2 people depending on the map. not worth it.
---
Wait, is this real? Please be real, lmao
---
This is most definitely the situation. The Jeff was running up to the hatch when the nurse showed up, it’s not as if he was already on the hatch taunting. There’s no reason to believe that he was being toxic rather than just a bit clueless
---
Ah yes , I see now. Thank you!
---
Gotta have a higher chance of spawning as killer with blindness status effec5
---
I'm sure Hag would be thrilled
---
Doctor has been my go-to lately also.  Hitting someone with a shock therapy to watch them stand at a pallet or window waiting to be hit is pretty nice.  Plus he's just generally obnoxious.
---
Back in my day we didn’t have any phones! Be grateful for what you have!
---
Looks like Huntress.
---
Ash was called a chapter
---
How did you make this so fast
---
Ya but ppl are going off on what the devs said. The devs said chapter for ash so them saying chapter for ghost really means nothing
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
at least not stupid
---
Ok, how about:
---
1:80
---
2:60
---
3:40
---
2:25
---
i have no problems with gen aura?
---
I dislike the idea
---
I main both killer and survivor, I'm a much better killer and most games usually come down to hatch, I'm not sweaty or anything, I can just mindgame and predict survivors based on what they're doing super well.
---
Upping the gen times would make Ruin a bit OP, and if they got rid of it, they'd have to make another perk for Hag, also the factor of getting rid of a perk kinda sucking, as perks are kind of limited.
---
Your suggestion is close to giving a killer a free perk, up the gen times? Just play a killer that can apply good pressure, Hillbilly is he best example I can think of for that, and if you think that's "sweaty", so what? What can we do about it? Maybe play Hillbully until you learn to apply better map pressure and switch over to a less "sweaty" killer.
---
Overall, I dislike the idea, looking through the comments I'm not alone...
---
They should have just made it so if the entity kills the survivor it counts the same as a bleed out honestly. Then killers would not just sit and wait for it to run out
---
Huntress
---
I'm unsure what you mean sorry.
---
They don’t have the rights to the movie, just the mask. The Ghostface mask and the Ghostface character from the SCREAM franchise are two different copyrights held by 2 different companies.
---
They basically made their own killer that’s a rip off of the killer(s) from the movies and put the mask on him to avoid copyright legal bs while also technically having a Ghostface killer in the game. That’s why his costume isn’t the same as it is in the movie. So we won’t be getting anything movie related. No level or characters from the movie. Would have been cool to get voice clips from him too since the voice that asks “What’s your favorite scary movie” is almost as iconic as the outfit. Oh well
---
lol The cop one is gonna be a fan favorite
---
Reading this ruined my life (my imagination is to blame), while also educating me. The bullet/stab points make sense.
---
I never said I didn't find them laughable, hence why I said in an earlier comment that they were guilty pleasures.
---
&gt; Gen times with 2 players on one need an increased time, only slightly though, as it stands it 80 secs solo, and then a MASSIVE drop to 40 seconds with only 2 
---
There is already s debuff when more than one survivor is working on a genarator.
---
Each survivor fixes 10% less for each extra survivor on a generator.
---
That means:
---
1 Surv =  1 x 100% = 100% Speed = 80 secs
---
2 Surv =  2 x 90% = 180% Speed = 44,4 secs
---
3 Surv = 3 x 80% = 240% Speed = 33,3 secs
---
4 Surv = 4 x 70% = 280% Speed = 28,6 secs
---
Even then, there's nothing you can do. Survivors are op plain and simple. Rank 1 killer and survivor
---
yeah, i literally said it?
---
Why wouldn’t you just leave?
---
No, I do it anyway though.
---
Thanks for posting!
---
Yeah the stance is probably a giveaway
---
The devs said that original Freddy wasn’t even an option and that they want new Freddy to be THE Freddy now
---
I have been thinking about something like this for ages
---
It's about time Feng got some more cosmetics.
---
hoooooooly shit finally a huntress mask to compete with the hound.
---
Yeah, they could revert the pick up speed to make it faster and add the animation stuns to balance it out. It’s just really stupid the way it is currently where you slam a pallet on the killer’s head as he picks someone up and just gets pushed away to no effect.
---
Shit your pants terrifying I like it
---
I always do a slow tbag to the killer as a way of saying thanks-for-the-farm or thanks-for-not-murdering-me-horribly. I make sure to nod in slow and exaggerated motion so the killer knows I'm not trying to be toxic.
---
Then you got paired up with an absolute tool of a killer who's only goal was to ruin someone's day. Take solace in the fact that this killer is probably a poor loser and will be enraged over the fact that they got one killer and ultimately achieved nothing.
---
Look who’s shittin in the tall grass

---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
I'm just imagining how an immersed p3 claudette would react when facing ghostface with the mask from a scary movie.
---
No one has any clue. We werent supposed to get that leak yet.
---
Where do you get the models to make these with?
---
You can communicate with the emotes. Use bond or empathy to see where people are. Get people to follow you. Take the killer away from a weak survivor if you notice someone can’t loop. Work on spread out gens so the last 3 are not right next to each other. Take a killer away from a hooked survivor. These are how you work as a team member without comms. Use your head to anticipate the killer and other survivor’s next moves. 
---
I don’t play SFW but I can understand how to play as a team and make smart decisions. Survivor is about keeping the killer busy while others work on objectives. You get downed, then you switch. If there is no one else to unhook you or distract, you go down for good. That is just the way the game is. 
---
Anyway, that is off topic. The EGC is not about letting a survivor get out or giving a killer free kills. It is about ending a game so it can’t be kept hostage indefinitely and ending the hatch standoffs. There are new options now for both sides to end the game. As survivor, you can end a game without any gens getting done and without DCing now, but that doesn’t mean you survive the match. As a killer, you can end a game with survivors who loop too good and won’t leave but it doesn’t mean you get a kill. You get to keep the points you earned in the match, unlike when you DC.
---
Neither, it's of the ziplock variety.
---
I spent $2 on this joke to make the outfit on the left please laugh
---
The community’s toxicity has been a problem for a long time. Just play how you want to play and screw what the other team (survivor or killer) thinks. If you try to have fun, while letting other people have fun too, you’re golden.
---
*Laughs in Serial killer*
---
YMCA!!
---
legion
---
Being entitled and toxic is at all time. Even if something is op that's because it's a rare item. Perks have its counterplay. The only think to truly gripe about is playstyles. Killer mains bitch about survivors and perks survivor mains bitch about killers. At the end of the day we are all just people playing a game.
---
This is my opinion that i am willing to share with you.
---
He is **D tier** IF you don't have **iridescent button**.   
---
But if you do, he is most likely A+ tier.
---
  
---
Why?   
---
Because right now, people who knows that he got nerfed, just waits until Legion vault so they can vault back into the pallet or window until his frenzy timer runs out / Legion stops it.   
---
Meaning: **You can't down them at all**, so if you don't have that add-on, you HAVE to destroy that pallet, else you will **never** catch him. (Of course there are mindgames that you can do, but why with Legion if you can do it with for example trapper or even nurse)  
---
**That being said, when people say stuff like: Just end your Frenzy and block the pallet if you don't have that add-on.**  
---
Then again, if people are just smart, they just loop around again until they're at the pallet, meaning, you can't hit them because of the long fatigue duration.  
---
This nerf is like nurse can't attack after a blink and has to wait until the fatigue timer is gone.   
---
**Conclusion**: His power doesn't help you with loops. (Like i said, except if you have iridescent button) then he is like the nurse but slightly worse.  
---
DISCLAIMER: Dont get me wrong tho, The Legion power is still good for **slowing the game down**.  
---
They **have** to mend AND heal after. Because he is scary now with his high movementspeed.  
---
PS: I like the character design and his playstyle, i am still playing him after the nerfs / buffs.   
---
tl;dr: He is just harder to play and you can loop him like every other killer.
---
Pretty sure that's how it went down, Freddy was about to kill him but they got nabbed befkre he could...
---
I get all of my models from the Workshop and I use Source Filmmaker for all of the actual photo. 
---
I use a mixture of models from Mark2580, Cozychicken, and omgwtfbbq
---
I also use GIMP 2.0 when editing the picture for meme purposes
---
Nice! That brown jacket outfit for tapp is what swat commander riggs wears in Saw 4.
---
I think this is a reference to ghostfaces assassin robe. This jester was in assassin creed 2s multiplayer. Which was super fun btw.
---
Spring trap from fnaf as a killer
---
Amazing
---
Fffffffuck yes, that pink dress for MinMin is everything I've ever needed in my life! And dat Huntress tho, mmmmm, spicy~
---
Dwight got drunk and banged his boss.
---
This Huntress should sing death metal.
---
Yessss the full detective fit
---
Dwight got drunk and banged the entity 😳
---
In my opinion, no. Trapper’s feels super quick and Leatherface feels super long for instance.
---
I’m not saying he’s op. I’m saying that he’s annoying to up against
---
The end is priceless!
---
And currently on Netflix.
---
Its actually baphomet and not a heart emoji
---
You never know when you'll need to be dressed up as a camouflaged vagina.
---
Its definetly baphomet
---
I hate this so much i want my groovy boy back
---
Reminds me of Monto’s Spirit video where he just yanks people off gens. One of my favorites.
---
Gotta love when people try to pass off their opinions as facts.
---
What movie is the with cholo Meyers?
---
I can only hope you're right, because if you are then this killer is going to be an insane amount of fun for both sides.
---
This is legit. All of the Ghostface leaks are.
---
I play both sides. Gen can pop super fast with a good team. I said this elsewhere the other day about ruin. Survivors just adapt to ignore it and either tap the gens or get greats over and over so at the start of the match the initial gen will still pop and then they worry about cleansing and honestly a few good players can still play the match with ruin never getting cleansed with only a small delay. I've done it a few times and I have had it happen a few times. Idk what a good balance would be other than speed boosting killers if they aren't in a chase.

GEN GRABS ARE OVERRATED. IF YOU WANT THEM, PRAYER BEADS ARE YOUR ONLY OPTION. MDR IS AMAZING WITH IT AND YAKUYOKE AMULET IS GOOD UTILITY WITH IT. 
---
MY RECOMMENDATION: USE OTHER ADD ONS. MOVEMENT SPEED IS GOOD, ACTIVATION SPEED IS GREAT, AND RECHARGE IS AN OPTION. REAPPEARANCE SPEED AND TIME ARE FINE FOR THE DAILIES IN MY EXPERIENCE BUT I DONT LIKE THEM. 
---
MAKE HER OTHER COMBOS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER, USE BEADS FOR GRABS AS A TREAT, AND GO NUTS. HER PHASING IS REALLY LOUD, SO YOURE NOT GETTING GRABS UNLESS THE SURVIVORS ARE POTATOES.
---
Good stuff! But you probably need to redo his knife all of clown's weapons are pocket knifes and it just seems weird for him to twirl a big butcher knife like that. Maybe something with a organic handle? Meat mass or something like that.
---
They are not the same length. Some are shorter some are longer
---
If survivors are OP how comes that the escape rate is below 50% on all ranks?
---
People are going to say we already have a clown. I'm going to tell them go ask bubba and Billy how that went. We need pennywise
---
See the problem with this arguement is that its consequence lead to stagnation. Nothing will ever change with the game unless the community shows that it is open to the idea and is will to handle few design missteps. 
---
You may not like the idea proposed but you can at least admit that this is a problem that one can not simply "get good" at to resolve or learn to "mindgame" better. 
---
The reason I proposed increasing the gens progression times was to allow killer to have at least some fair chance to earn points towars their Gatekeeper emblem and change the way the game is played such that we don't have such a large shift in gameplay style when Ruin is used. 
---
If we incease the gen progression time nominally and remove ruin ( and just give Hag a new perk) then that would optimise the gameplay so that killers will have more of a chance to pressure gens (no matter what killer is being used) and survivors wouldnt need to have to worry about their teammates going on a potential fruitless scavenger hunt for a lit totem that they might never find.
---
Dwight got drunk and gave the entity head.
---
Yes, and the killer records his murders via cellphone video.
---
DBD twitter called Ash a chapter
---
If you play on ps4 and we’re playing like 30 minutes ago I was playing billy and using this strategy on cold wind it’s impossible to counter
---
Oof
---
No, Quentin's lore states that Freddy came for him again and he was so angry about what Freddy had done to him/Nancy/their friends, that he summoned the Entity on accident
---
The new one has more of a poncho cloak.
---
Hell with the introduction of ghost face after legion who is obviously inspired by ghost face it makes it even more likely that we may see pennywise the dancing clown someday
---
**WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE**
---
You do realize noed is the biggest crutch perk for killers only the bad ones use it because it gives you stuff you did not earn.
---
0/10 no WAZZZAAAAPP
---
Jesus you are crouch walking faster what addons do you have on
---
Eh, not really. Saw 2 is where everything went downhill in my opinion.
---
Amanda turning out to be a helper was an okay twist [even if I don't like her character at all after that], but everything else was kinda stupid:
---
* Law enforcement who knows Jigsaw makes traps just enters in through the front single file. What...?
---
* That one chick who stuck both her hands in the glass box for the syringe.
---
* The fact that no one tailed Eric when he abducted Kramer.
---
* The fact his son never made any noise inside of the safe.
---
* The fact that Kramer counted on Eric losing his temper before the video ended and they realized it wasn't a live feed makes it seem like Jigsaw knew what would happen despite how many variables were at play and therefore there was no real chance of winning his game anyway, undermining the first movie with how at least Dr. Lawrence managed to make it out alive.
---
* No one else in the trap really had any purpose or meaning besides Amanda and the detective's kid. In the first film, there was distinct reason and purpose for Dr. Lawrence, Adam and Zepp all being part of Jigsaw's game. They each had very significant roles.
---
* They undermine the first movie by having Eric escape the chain by breaking his own foot, and he doesn't even escape, so it was pretty pointless.
---
* How did Kramer even find Jeff?
---
* What if Jeff didn't wake up early enough to save any of the people from the traps, especially the girl who was freezing to death?
---
* Why didn't Jeff warn the guy he saved from the Pig guts about the shotgun he was trying to get a key from? Seems mighty dumb.
---
* Amanda just throwing the key into the tub instead of putting it around Adam's neck solves the problem of Jigsaw not giving Adam a fair chance in the first movie, but then it raises the issue that if she had done that, then the first movie wouldn't have made any sense because no matter how obtuse a person can be, it is really hard to not notice a key around your neck.
---
* Jigsaw already knew he was going to get killed and just turned into a massive troll.
---
It seemed like every movie from Saw 3 onward was trying too hard to explain things that didn't need to be explained and have tie-ins to the previous films.
---
he follows you around saying return the slab, or suffer my curse
---
There's an efficiency drop off not a debuff.
---
That's just, like, your opinion man.
---
It should at least be played during the end of the charge. It's not an ambush if she gives fair warning before lol
---
Also let yourself get pallet stunned. Can’t miss out on that cute oink squeal
---
You're like a doggo barking
---
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT HOSTAGE TAKING IF THE KILLER IS TRYING TO COMPLETE THEIR OBJECTIVE (KILLING SURVIVORS): IF THE ENDGAME COLLAPSE TIMER IS TICKING THEN THE SURVIVOR WILL DIE, IF THE SURVIVOR IS SLUGGED, THEY WILL BLEED OUT AND DIE.  
---
BHVR HAS SPECIFICALLY COMMENTED ON THIS WITH REGARDS TO DOCTOR &amp; 3-GEN AND ALSO SLUGGING AS A COUNTER TO HOOK-SABOTAGING, THEY DON'T CONSIDER ANYTHING "ON A TIMER" THAT WILL RESULT IN THE SURVIVOR DYING AND GETTING TO LEAVE THE MATCH THROUGH IN-GAME MECHANICS TO BE HOSTAGE-TAKING.  
---
HOSTAGE-TAKING IS LIKE WHEN THE LAST SURVIVOR IS SITTING HEALING IN THE GATE AREA INSTEAD OF LEAVING - THEY ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE THEIR OBJECTIVE (ESCAPE) AND HAVE NO TRIAL-RELATED REASON (OTHER SURVIVORS HOOKED) TO STAY BEHIND.

~~Rip stealth category for survivors 2018~~
---
Yes, it is. Just like it’s your ~opinion~ that all the movies are bad. Opinions and facts are two different things, girl.
---
“I thought they would just walk away from the explosions like cool dudes”
---
What cosmetics?
---
I would 100% had enough of DbD that day lol
---
I know it's surprising haha, waiting for my bloodweb to bless me with the perks I want and I'm switching some of them out is all. Got adept a while ago!
---
is that a flashlight in your pants or are you just happy to see me?
---
maybe they just lowered the audio of his talking some more so now you need super hearing to barely hear ᵍʳᵒᵒᵛʸ
---
Nah solo survivor is still op as long as no one on the team are potatoes or dc. There are too many counters for killers and their builds.
---
Its a glitch happened to another dude playing against the nurse
---
I honestly hate that auto aim is a thing in this game. It's screwed me over so many times as a killer it's not even funny.
---
I like to play killer too and I'll admit the last person having a free get away was sometimes annoying too. I never hatch camped because I hate being in those standoffs. I guess the tables are a bit reversed now. I just wish they had at least left pig alone because she was a killer I liked to play and way less used than Hillbilly.
---
"To the rescue" no thanks who ever is evil is probly still less then you, nicely done though
---
Why not try to learn from Tru3 exactly? Him and Monto are who I learned from and I do alright
---
Lmao, k
---
Exactly once. Everything went back to normal as soon as I was pulled off the hook.
---
Yeah I loved the pig, still do
---
Have it so if one of the killers kills 4 or more survivors first that killer gets to Mori the other killer or they both lose if the survivors just escape
---
You have to win a Tetris 99 to get off the hook
---
A console dude disliked your comment lol. I'll like it to balance it out as a follow PC dude.
---
They won’t tell you. They just keep sending links that don’t work instead of simply typing what’s in it. Probably found the picture on google.
---
ya it is a cool glitch lol
---
And most of them likely to die first or DC from being toxic and stupid. Just sayin..
---
No worries, I chuckled!
---
I only heard of Sara, not Saracasm. What a weird name.
---
With a side of survivor pudding
---
Well i suppose they have to pay the rights to do so imagine paying to bring clothes wich are not iconic or anything just generic stuff
---
Besides, survivors are ment to work together even if that means sacrificing themselves to get others out aka: sitting on ahook while others do gens
---
That timing tho
---
I dislike the idea, I find putting pressure on gens as killer to be easy, no matter what killer I am, because I learned how to, I played and played, practiced and practiced, and of course I have my bad games and my bad streaks of games, but ultimately it depends on two things, you, and your opponent, and with the horrible ranking system, it's hard to find people who are of equal skill to eachother
---
And while I hate saying it, the only solution to this problem is "Gitting Good" because map pressure is a hard thing to learn, but will improve your killer game a lot, learning to cut chases to run and go get a gen, even if it risks finding a barely completed gen, because Idk where exactly you fail to succeed in this, that is a common mistake that even I do, putting your current chase way above generators in importance. It's hard to do because you can just down the survivor but then the gen gets done and it applies stress, but that's what playing killer is, dealing with that stress, same with survivor, and people who think one side needs a nerf just haven't learned to deal with that stress.
---
This isn't me saying I'm a god at Dead By Daylight, I'm probably at 500-600 hours total in the game and started when The Clown came out, but I've been active in the community and believe I know what people see and what the flaw of that is. If you believe applying pressure is too hard, then start playing killer more and learning, watch videos or something. Because Dead by Daylight isn't easy to learn, not at all, I'm still at a basic level despite having played so many hours. Maybe slightly above average, but still, it takes a lot of learning and adapting, because here are no games like it. It's the most balanced but in order to do that it had to make the skill cap really high, making people all over the place with how good they are, which has lead to bad ranking systems, which ultimately puts me, someone who can run a killer around for 2-4 gens in a game with people who last 2 seconds in a chase, or puts me with people who sit on a gen and let you pull them off while you're killer. So, while it sounds mean, I mean it in the offensive way I can, the only way to get past your problem is to "Git Gud," and if you dislike that, Dead By Daylight just isn't a game for you. Plain and simple.
---
This would be lore accurate, Amanda doesn’t give a fuck about the rules. She’ll resort to using hatchets in the lockers to get the job done.
---
Pennywise may be a clown, but that is in a chosen form only.
---
Lore wise Pennywise is a manifestation of an Evil Entity used to frighten it's targets. The Entity that is known as Pennywise is like a lesser/equal form of the Entity that controls the DbD realm.
---
I'd be interested in how they would explain 2 lesser "deity's" working in tandem together like that except one has domain over the other. I may be thinking into this too much but I hate it when Lore doesn't make sense.
---
So cute lmao
---
Their ping probably
---
If only you didn't choke at the end
---
New Nightmare Freddy pls
---
I play hag on ps4  pretty much daily with a troll Franklin's build and you would be shocked how many 4ks I've gotten from people dying for that purple flashlight they found.
---
Undercover cop and patrol police outfit for Tapp? Nice.
---
Lmao
---
What did they change about DS?
---
It is super easy to forget, especially if you don't spectate a lot!
---
I'm also a killer main, so I dont get the option often! But lately I've been leveling my P3 David King so I have somebody if my mates want to squad up, I gotta pay more attention lol
---
You're still in the medium vault animation on their end.  And their end is the only one that matters now.  You should probably not play in a lobby with a ping higher than like 60 tbh.  I personally don't.
---
It's probably an original ghostface character, since the identity of ghostface has been taken up by copycat after copycat, it'd make sense lorewise and would make licensing easier. Could also be a character from the books, since the guy who they got the mask rights from is the guy who wrote the books.
---
Yeah I'm really hoping they add more blood to it.
---
It's almost as though he'll take..... *skill*.  
---
**gasp**
---
I'll try to record one next time, this one was great, all four stayed to get endgamed
---
Please tell me you run the REAL David King - shirtless. All Davids with shirts are just Jakes 😜.
---
I think there will be.  The Devil costume I stated has the basic, costume robes but with some red splashed on.  It's similar, but different and that's kinda nice.
---
Also I don't know why but the show is apparently easier to license than the movies if this is true.  No idea why but maybe it's the raw amount of actors which is why both Freddy and Quentin were from the new Nightmare.
---
Truth.
---
Penny-wise is lame
---
I like how it looks but the mask could use some blood
---
Holy crap I didn't realize that...
---
It's super real. Dev build accidentaly got released so now we have access to ghostface's model, power descriptions, and animations, plus some other things.
---
Sounds like fun :)
---
Thats awesome
---
Yeah, I saw the NecroCraft video now. This looked like an sfm fanmade so I wasnt quite sure. Thanks though
---
The spotting detection is likely worded poorly - i would bet it determines the range at which survivors must be in of you to drain your stuff.
---
Lmao nahh I don't pay money for skins, an I spent my Bloodshard life savings on my Susie skin.
---
But I do acknowledge the Shirtless King is a fair and just ruler
---
I may have interpreted the movie wrong but dosent penny wise feed of peoples fear similar to the entity so they could potentially have sort of mutual agreement sort of like a I’ll scratch your back and you scratch mine or in this case you bring me survivors and I’ll make them terrified.
---
It‘s usually the licensed that are more subtle
---
4 DCs  ≠  a win
---
Well yeah true :)
---
Gross
---
I can't fault you for not spending real money on them. Your acknowledgement is noted.
---
that poor killer
---
well the company that owns saw also owns Halloween 1, so we can only hope
---
I don't remember the last time watching a Nurse clip made me smile, take my upvote good sir or madam.
---
LOLLLL wtf
---
I read about it on the fandom that in the physical realm his true form is a pregnant female spider and it is most likely a she. Its actual true form hasn't been seen because it exists in another realm all that anyone has seen of it is a hairy orange light or something. It's really complex lore and I'm not sure 8 have a firm grasp on it because the page said it has no true form then they say it's the giant spider.
---
WHY. DOES. EVERY. KILLER. PROXY. CAMP. ON. CONSOLE? ITS GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT I PHYSICALLY NEED BORROWED TIME SO I CANT TRY NEW BUILDS! IF I DONT GO FOR SAVES NO ONE ELSE WILL. I HAD A GAME RECENTLY WHERE I WAS IN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP AND I SAW NO ONE W BOND BUT NO ONE WENT FOR THE SAVE WHILE THE KILLER WAS CHASING ME. IM RANK 5.
---
Cursed
---
It's the outfit for the detective in Saw 4, aka the guy who goes through doors too much.
---
The window blocking bug isn't fixed. Had a match as killer where an ace was able to jump the window unlimited times. It was in the farm level. Specifically those big machines that you can climb on top.
---
Needs like a 3 or 4 fingers of blood slapped across the mask. Lol
---
Oh he definitely banged his boss
---
They didn't say they won't, just that they can't.
---
I'm 100% sure if it was updated and a massive amount of people suddenly got banned they would offer recourse. I've been banned before and the BHVR support was incredibly helpful with it.
---
i hope she gets a cosmetic that makes her bark instead, that would be cool
---
Dwight just got cassie caged
---
Yeah I think we read the same thing, I think it's the form in our "physical world" it that of an endless crawling furry spider thing made of orange like, but no one can look at it directly without going nuts. Whilst it's real true form is in a nother realm no one will ever see.
---
So...yeah I cam back with more questions then answers lolz
---
Rank 1 Survival rate is 80%.
---
Okay but replace the hatch with uh.. you know what nevermind
---
r/DBDgonewild got me covered in that front
---
IVE HAD TOO MANY 4KS RUINED BY THAT STUPID PILE OF GARBAGE IF I SEE IT IT GETS SLAMMED SHUT
---
Demise of the Faithful chapter cosmetics.
---
Reminds me of Caviera
---
"Where's the rest of you?" "Spill it."
---
Extra sad because Babylonian skins woulda been amazing.
---
I would like a full on carnival or amusement park for The Clown.
---
No one can look into the deadlights realm at it's true form without going insane. But yeah. He sounds immensely powerful. Lore wise I dont see how the entity would take it without a power struggle. If they really wanted to stay true to the lore they could give us pennywise events where it takes over the realm momentarily. That would be pretty cool.
---
Thats fun son
---
There's the door...
---
Wait is this real
---
I think with dedicated servers it's not gonna be the thing, has something to do with that
---
I'm not.
---
I'm happy the hatch now has counterplay, and most of these changes are fair game.
---
I used to use bright outfits for an incentive to really hide.  I'm not blending in, I'm actually hiding from the killer!  It didn't work most of the time though...
---
If you're going to vocalize how you play, I'll vocalize my opinion, idgit.
---
&gt;The Devs confirmed in a lore-stream the killers do hang out in their home realm between trials 
---
Must be when the servers go down.
---
Oh wait, too soon.
---
Promise you it wasn’t. I’ll give you a little bit of context. What happened was the killer had downed me in the gates, so he picked me up, carried me away from the gates, and tried to drop me so he could see the new animation. The thing is that he dropped me after my wiggle was over 70%, so I got up on my feet. Logically, I ran to the exit gates, and began to teabag in them. Because there is no visual or audio queue (say 10 seconds before the end) I literally forgot all about it, and was killed as the killer was running back towards me after the stun.
---
We Halloween fans have had to put up with a lot.
---
That "movie" crossed so, so many lines.
---
It is an abomination which is best being completely forgotten.
---
But she has to kill a survivor first.
---
Claudette and Nea at the gen. Killer approaches. Nea has a tear in her eye.
---
Claudette:"what is wrong Nea"
---
Nea:"I am sorry, little one"
---
Breakdown can be clutch depending on what's happening. "Killer is FAR away, I can heal!" 
---
Or, what's personally happened to me.
---
"THANKS FOR SAVING ME FRIEND!" 
---
*I exit the gate, he goes down right before it. Breakdown took out the nearest hook, friend wiggles and escapes*
---
yeah because everyone has his own playstyle, Perks really rarely matter. 
---
Addons are the things that are necessary on some killers
---
It shouldn't be played at all. It would be a great jumpscare if you just suddenly heard her running and breathing.
---
Really? Huh. Interesting
---
Wasn‘t this a bug like a year ago, too?
---
I´d try Insidious/Iron Grasp/Agitation/whatever you want ;)
---
Honestly i would swap M&amp;A out for something else like Ruin or overcharge.
---
The devil has a poncho like robe. Mtv scream has a poncho type robe. You can be the mtv scream with a ghostface mask. I'm really fine with different robes though.
---
Ehhh. Maybe a little bit.
---
Go somewhere else.
---
Very true, I actually just played a match as killer and couldnt make out a survivor urban evading near a hook through grass because all I could hear was the entity slurping in my ear
---
Hail Satan!
---
Yeah true. As long as there was some sort of audio, I'd be cool with it. I wish it was more surprising but also not surprising enough to be broken
---
Every time I read a “Killer Ethics” post I always think about the old school Fedora Guy meme.  “Hope you all had a pleasant game M’Survivors.”
---
Actually, he was in a locker that got dropped off of a plane
---
Wrong license though. They only got the remake one
---
Now that I the real question.
---
That's Zubat next target m8, after that Jesus and then Yaweh.
---
^^Ez ^^Clap
---
I heard about it being a reboot. Everyone says they heard rumours on the mask changing but I cant find that info or rumour anywhere. It's been delayed but from what I read is was because mtv has a bunch of new people running it who aren't producing those kinds of shows. They also said it may be because they are in talks with streaming platforms to release after it airs.
---
For sure. I run spine chill tier 3 so there are no surprises on me. No wraith bing bongs or piggie tiger attacks. No peeping myers either. The warning alert sound needs to go.
---
I prefer PWYF, but both are great
---
Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a wild and crazy movie.
---
Which ones aren’t mindless killing machines
---
Maybe he was just saving it to post later
---
The entity's realmed is a mirrored version of our own, and it's based off what the entity understands about our world. So cell phones would be functional since we would expect them to be, there doesn't need to be logic.
---
Oh alright, well thanks a lot for the info, I appreciate it.
---
So it seems i would have to pretty much level up all the survivors to get certain perks I want. Or as someone said i could just buy them.
---
And for the killer, it's basically play them all and see which one suits me the most.
---
That seems pretty exciting honestly, so i can't wait to see which one I really actually like playing. 
---
Thanks again guys
---
Last time I played I was against rank 1 2 and 4 people when i was 17...
---
Please BHVR, don’t butcher this guy before launch, he sounds amazing
---
We'll still fight for Bunny Min but this outfit is amazing.
---
How did the 17 even get matched with me so the 2s could just loop my boosted ass tho.
---
XD
---
Shadowborn.
---
Makes you feel like a race car.
---
MoM can be used more than once. It should be limited to one time.
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
We all need it, BHVR please implement it so we can finally rest our souls
---
he takes a fucking selfie with the corpse.what a mad lad
---
Not too much to ask for is it.
---
man and I thought rainbow six siege had terrible matchmaking take a good look at this game 😂
---
From today on that arguement is no longer valid lol
---
Dark Sense.Knowing where the killer is super useful
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
How aren't they psychos? Or what makes clown and Michael more psycho?
---
I never see people use dark sense quite good
---
Leatherface is probably one of the worst killers in the game. He can camp well thats it.
---
Oh! Thank you for reporting that. I will increase the max length, yes. As it is a quick fix expect that in about two hours (so I can arrive my work place).
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
I will surely try Ruin whenever i get the opportunity but, M&amp;A seems to do the same job as Insidious yet better if i am patrolling hooked survivors and generators.
---
Didn’t know weather to upvote or downvote :(
---
For your last point, they also called Ash vs Evil Dead a *CHAPTER* on their Twitter account
---
this Trapper is my friggin hero
---
&gt;MoM can be used more than once.
---
No it can't. Not by the same survivor anyway.
---
yeah it's bullshit I'm playing against rank 6 killers and I'm rank 12 like alright I don't feel like getting absolutely shit on every time
---
Look he is just creepy alright
---
It should’ve been a full chapter with Sally Hardesty and the Sawyer House. Such wasted potential, I’m 99.999% sure we won’t see either and that disappoints me as a TC1 fan.
---
&gt;it could be purchased with shards.
---
Doubt
---
I always liked the idea of Ghostface as a killer and I too was thinking about the lockers as his specialty. 
---
I even came up with an idea like: 
---
When Ghostface enters a locker all the survivors get an accoustic signal (kinda like the wraith when using his bell.. maybe some kind of a squeaky sound like that of an old wooden door or smth idk)
---
This way survivors know when to be careful near a locker. 
---
When inside one of them his perspective changes to third person (kinda like the survivors when they're inside a locker) so he can observe the outside. On top of that the Killer can see the aura of anyone who's hiding in another locker. 
---
When leaving the locker he immediately rushes out and is much faster for a few seconds (quite like the pig when charging at someone) but w/o any notification this time, so that the survivors won't know if he's still inside of one until they see him or hear him enter another locker (or hear his reappeared heartbeat).
---
That being said - red dots and heartbeat are gone while inside a locker, of course.
---
And of course - if a survivors tries to hide inside the same locker Ghostface is hiding in, he grabs the survivor.
---
Can you jump in while it's being closed?
---
We tried that with f i n g e r g u n s, and look how far we got with that
---
So I have any dates on when this will be?
---
Considering the amount of time they took to touch DS, I suggest becoming a survivor main or playing nothing but Nurse, Billy and Huntress.
---
MoM is here to stay and is broken AF.
---
Personally I have a love for plunderers instinct and sometimes pair that with ace in the hole for some godly items from chests
---
You have a stats page to back that?
---
True other than a slight correction, players complain, not killers, and not survivors, players complain because players regardless of role find imbalances and exploits/etc  
---
But yes from where this game came from it is very balanced, in the sense that no "must do" changes NEED to happen like the ez blind, vacuums, etc. We're in this period now where the finer balances need to be targeted. Remember when the ability to unhook from the sides of the hook got introduced? those little pockets where the QOL stuff is fixed.  
---
Also about the SWF arguement, yeah i agree with the collective community that killers competing with SWF should be awarded an incremental boost to scores, its that simple.
---
This is fantastic! I would kill to play as this guy and hear his voice in game--and the mechanics are defs interesting, too.
---
I customise dolls and figures on a regular so this was pretty easy
---
Imagine if it could and there was a 4 instaheals SWF that builds around having one guy chased the whole match. I'd love (and hate) to see that.
---
That's disgusting.
---
Oh man, guess i'll soon be a Feng main
---
Enter a locker and exit out of a different one.
---
i want his eyes red af
---
lets upvote this to everyone.this guys realy fucking deserves the karma
---
That would be hilarious
---
I don't really care about Bunny Feng.
---
Just and themed Feng skin will do at that point, so hurray.
---
Welcome to DBD, you'll get used to it
---
I am guessing it reduces the max with how poorly they normally word add-ons. Aka instead of requiring being within 46 meters you gotta be within 32 and looking at him to reduce it etc.
---
Wrong home
---
My and my phobia of insects are uninstalling now thanks tho
---
Wait... You can get more BP with maps?
---
Hag traps make me almost shit my pants and spent the rest of the match crouching, I guess I'll just have to stop playing the game
---
You gotta love it.
---
The others are just stomping on it I think. The hag slaps it
---
I had just watched a beginners guide and they said the same thing, so I'll keep that in mind 😊
---
One of my favourite competition traps by far. Though my actual favourite is Pound of Flesh, because Simone like sees Eddie take one little piece and goes "WELL DIDN'T NEED THIS ARM!" and destroys him XD
---
He spends a lot of time being slow and charging his power for survivors to be marked. Can he stalk several survivors at once?
---
My God, just look at those knees!
---
Well it cant be as toxic as Friday the 13th is currently.
---
But eh, oh well, it'll be new to me so I wont be able to tell lol
---
The Mori animation where she yells at a dead body is so corny. It looks like a little baby throwing a tantrum
---
I mean it was what, atleast 4 floors including the 2 basement levels, i.e., furnace + the tunnel levels?
---
I hate his outfit tho
---
Might not always be the case, but in my experience that's been why
---
I HAD A MORI DAILY AND THE SURVIVOR DISCONNECTED JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO MORI THEM SO I DIDN'T GET MY DAILY THAT GAME
---
Just make some sort of stealth mechanic. Not every character has to bring a new power to the table!
---
How did they BM?
---
Thank you
---
The patch notes implied that was only in the end game/when the killer opens the gate. Is that not the case?
---
Wraith looks like something out of Dark Souls 3.... but then again, when doesnt he?
---
You should probably know what you are even talking about before you post.
---
I am actually sad that these got leaked, why are they getting leaked so much? I would be happy if I got to buy the skin right now say instead of September
---
myers isn't a psychopath. he's depicted as pure, unadulterated evil.
---
But besides crouching (now already on 1 and another soon to be released) theres not much besides maybe the ability to turn off your terror radius for a short time, but I can't see that going over well.
---
There's tons of good ideas for new killers, but the problem is they have to be unique yet also favorable to how the game is played. The devs are just people too, so unless we can get a good discussion going here with many others an brainstorm at least 1 viable idea I can't assume they will either. 
---
Alas, the issue with all regular Joe shmoe killers :/
---
Hes still a psychopath.
---
Well  alot of false reporting happens when you play killer just so you know
---
Survivors are already fucked with a barely filled 5th page
---
The reason I say this is his best build is because everything you just mention doesn't work against good Survivors. You said you're at Rank 10 right now, which is good but once you start getting to the higher ranks the play style you're wanting falls out incredibly fast. Survivors willn't go for hook rescues nearly as much as they'll prioritize gens over saving. They'll be better at looping and willn't hop off gens the second they hear your heartbeat. Whispers is a wonderful perk don't get me wrong, if Killers had 5 perk slots it would definitely go into that slot on all my Killers, the issue is it just can't fit into a typical M1 killer build ever since Spirit Fury got added.
---
Why is Spirit Fury so good you ask, well it isn't unless you pair it with Enduring, then it becomes insane. Imagine you're chasing a Survivor, in a loop and you just BARELY miss your swing, you're right behind them and swing, but they drop the pallet and are running away unhurt. Now imagine that scenario with Spirit Fury + Enduring. You miss the swing, pallet is dropped on your head but who cares? You're stunned for half a second, the pallet is gone, and you're right back on their ass. That's not even mentioning Spirit Fury double hits. Imagine that same scenario but you actually hit the Survivor and they still drop the pallet. Now you've injured them, are srunned for half a second, the pallet is gone, and you're right back on their ass and can swing again faster than if you just did your weapon wipe animation.
---
The combo is DIRTY.
---
Even if it still did the time it takes for feral frenzy to recharge is way too long for it to be viable. I'd like it if devs revisit legion and rework his power to be able to down though ballanced and fun. A highly agile killer that takes multiple hits to down is a good idea at its core however its a case of makeing it work.
---
Yeah... (I’m half asleep so sorry if this is inaccurate) basically the Deep wound bar wont go down with any consecutive hits and you will no longer be able to see the bar going down. Feral Frenzy is basically a free hit followed by a stun.
---
I dunno what is more "cringy", my use of "white knight" or your attempt at a sick comeback?
---
Moniter and Abuse, most people run it on the slower killers because it gives them a couple extra secs to get closer but I run that on most of my regular killers. Plus the slight Fov clarity helps my color blind ass see
---
I run a full blue Nea, and 90% of the time hiding is futile, unless I get Macmillan Estate. That blue hued atmosphere gives me so much joy.
---
imagine being able to save the selfie as a screenshot of the game as if it were an actual pic taken by the phone
---
I fucking screamed after getting yanked off by a pig for the first time
---
Yea the devs said the current peer to peer grouping hosted by the killer makes it impossible to stay in a group after a game. With dedicated servers they should be able to add a party that stays together.
---
Reminds me of 2016.
---
He has a generator power adaptor, so when the survivors escape he plugs it into one of the gens.
---
Canonically if a player lets the survivors escape, it's because ghostface's phone is flat and it needs power before he can go on killing again
---
I've also noticed lately in my few survivor matches, on Xbox, I'm always starting with at least  someone else an can see the rest in the distance.
---
Had the streamer battlemick tunnel me because of ds, like what? Threw the whole game to get me.
---
Pig needs atleast the same survior speed when crouched which is 100%
---
Type this without the full stops and put what you want to hide between the exclamation marks: 
---
&gt;.!!.&lt;
---
I was last survivor and killer caught me and dribbled me during the entire EGC. He dropped me for a bit and I found the hatch crawling but it was closed. Hey, real fuckin fun devs. Really fuckin fun
---
That’s the beauty of opinion, because I honestly think Myers has the worst p3 in the game. 
---
It looks like someone with syphillis busted on his face.
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
The first thing I thought was "Oh, it's the shopping mall from SH3". The nurse was a good idea!
---
Might as well just make DC an official gameplay mechanic seeing as the devs don't want to do anything about it
---
should learn to run with ur camera facing the killer at all times
---
&gt; !thank you! &lt;
---
Uhhh probably not considering almost no one plays him lmao
---
How in the fuck did you think that was legion
---
I definitely won’t be considering I haven’t bought either character and probably never will.
---
While cool, that'd be a downside to playing him.
---
Male survivors already have a harder time playing stealthily as it is.
---
Because these devs are against quality of life features.
---
I wish we'd get more 100% indoor maps in general, but all of these are great ideas.  A graveyard would be wonderfully atmospheric, a wonderfully traditional horror trope of a map.  I'm in love with the Léry's morgue map idea, that'd be ridiculously creepy.
---
When the entity hates you more then the killer hates you x'D
---
Tested, you get cutoff.
---
Uh no bloody mask?
---
Quentin who?
---
I cant check it right now, but it was a white dress, with messy hair
---
The ability got leaked and it doesn't have anything to do with phones. It's like Pig and Myers combined. He can crouch and peek around corners to stalk an individual survivor and once he's done it enough that survivor get's the exposed effect.
---
The one on the left is more likely to have long games, because I will refuse to kill her last teammate until she's removed.
---
Easy solution, no weapons allowed in the elevator, we first fight at dawn
---
If you can hide with all that fashion, you deserve to wear said fashion.
---
According to the notes, it's to allow the connection to stablize before showing the ping, so an overly high ping is not displayed prematurely.
---
Ah yes because the later movies in the original series were so much better.
---
It’s been 84 years
---
It gives the ping a couple of seconds to stabalize. I have joined many lobbies where the ping said 300 but quickly jumped down to less than 100. I guess they are hoping that less people will dodge lobbies instantly :D
---
Min is a ballerina!!!!!! Both of my mains are getting pretty skins omg happy oink
---
It's pretty easy to spot DS users nowadays. When you unhook someone and they decide to instantly try to get all the aggro, then you know for a fact that they have DS. Either that or they are stupid.
---
Ninja Claudette on the left is the fucking move dude. Get some funny moments from that shit. Just crouch and no one will see you
---
I recommend you to save your shards up to 9k in order to use them to buy the Hag, so you can get her three perks (even tho ruin is the only good one for LF):
---
-Ruin is mandatory If you dont want to get genrushed.
---
-Third Seal can bem used for some slug builds, but its her worse perk (imo).
---
-Devour hope is extremely fun when you get the stacks without the totem getting destroyed.
---
Leatherface was my main killer when I started playing, but nowadays I barely touch him. It sure is fun sometimes, but he's considered a weak killer due to his low map pressure, making Billy a way better option If you want these instadowns (getting used to HB is kinda hard tho)
---
After getting the Hag, I would recommend the Spirit. She is Very fun to play and have great perks as well. You can DM me if you have any questions or If you just wanna talk :)
---
Is this from a hat in time? It looks like one of the villains.
---
I do play nurse. Once you know your range you don't fall for the mindgame anymore. 
---
You blink to the location at which they broke the line of sight, if they tried to juke you then you hit them, if they didn't then you use your 2nd blink to adjust.
---
&gt;every other killer can have minimal success with just W + M1, a nurse that can't blink and predict is on a lower tier than Freddy.
---
That's a complete non-argument, yeah if you don't use the killer's power then you will do better with a killer that moves faster than the one that doesn't. This doesn't add anything to the argument about skill ceiling.
---
Lmao a dwight - GhostFace before taking selfie with a Nokia 3000
---
Look you and I both want meg to strip but the devs said no, we just have to live with that
---
What happened to Dwight, I want it!
---
Our time will come...until then..that Ballerina skin will do.
---
&gt; gates are powered 
---
Small detail but one gate needs to be open, powering the gate isn't enough.
---
You're juggling before they are no longer in dying state.
---
That's what I've said.
---
If you are playing against good survivors that know how to loop, Billy's power level drops down, he's great at stomping common soloQ survivors that will let him chainsaw them.
---
Against good survivors he drops down, and Spirit, Huntress and Hag go over him, since they can play around loops much better than he can.
---
MoM isnt that bad. Under the right circumstances it can really delay the killers time. Let's say that they get hit and run out of a exit gate that's bad. If they use the MoM boost to a strong pallet and they loop you it's bad for time. What I usually see though is mom giving someone a speed boost away that makes them last for a extra 10-15 seconds. If someone is running a insta heal to use MoM on you that kind of feels like a abusive mechanic but whatever. My real point is if the killer is pretty good and isnt in trouble for pressure MoM doesnt really matter. I dont run it either unless I use another slot for self are or i have a health kit with me. Other wise it's you waiting for a team mate to help you which is a 50/50 on solo que.  It doesnt really need a huge nerf if they wanted to nerf it. Maybe make insta heals not count towards the heal required to activate it. Make it to where if you are near the exit gate it doesmt give you a speed boost.
---
What about the plague? She did what she sincerely thought was the best for her people. She didn't kill anyone, the illness did!
---
Me
---
I always felt like a bitch when Caveira did that to me betraying my team like that 💔
---
waaah the killer KILLED me
---
I bet a lot of stupid common shit amazes you.
---
Probably not, but we'll have to see how long it takes for a survivor to be marked, may not be too long.
---
His face looks like a mummy! Awesome artwork!
---
It's a really frustrating and annoying 'feature' due to the frequency you have to leave high MS lobbies.  
---
I constantly have to leave 5+ lobbies (sometimes 8-10) to find one with a decent ping...and by decent I mean less than 200 because
---
my standards have dropped so low.  
---
So each lobby just had its time doubled because I'm sitting there waiting to find out my MS.
---
It's increased my time to find a game exponentially for this once in a blue moon situation where the initial ping plummets after a few seconds.
---
Nice save!
---
Very possible, but I didn't want to assume misprints.
---
DS felt way worse than MoM.
---
Feng be like "fuck this dress"
---
How do you know that?
---
Sure they were effectively trying to play around it, but where did they indicate that that was their intention?
---
SAME SHIT. YESTERDAY I HAD 2 NURSE GAMES AND ALL THE REST WERE FUCKING HILLBILLIES. RUIN, BBQ, YOU NAME THE REST. BEFORE THAT R10'S WERE THE GOOD RANKS TO ACTUALLY PLAY, BUT NOW THAT NOBODY REACHES R1, WE'RE ALL FUCKED.
---
give hackjob to Terror Doctor instead of Overcharge and literally you can just permanently go fuck yourself.
---
Some people definitely don't read patch notes at all. Had a game last night where a Pig put a RBT on my head after the gens were powered and was very confused as to why my head didn't explode when I hauled ass out the exit gate.
---
That's honestly why I feel so hyped / intimidated by him.... he takes the scary factor of michael and brings a new level, and the mask in game peaking behind a tree is gonna make me jump
---
Now this is a shitpost in every sense of the word.
---
Daniel Rigg is the guy you're thinking of. Lived from saw 2 to saw 4 iirc.
---
Simon Tatham's puzzles (https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) or Minesweeper
---
If you want to kill everyone then do it before 2 gens are done EZ. If you can't do that then you should let someone have hatch...yeah I'm done here. Bye
---
Make Your Choice, it discourages tunneling and gives the killer a good advantage, but I rarely see it used. There's also Surveillance, very good for insistent survivors.
---
Having a bit of trouble understanding this comment. If you could explain to me what "skill" you mean. Cause last time I checked walking away from a noise que and hiding behind a wall or rock  doesn't require any skill at all.
---
Since clown update I think, cuz first thing I did with clown was find all the fun places you could throw bottles through.
---
I either take a break, listen to some music or play another game for a little while
---
This is legendary👌👌
---
Thank you! It's actually based of the look of the antagonist from the 1990 horror film "Maniac Cop 2"
---
Just imagine her squeaking while throwing the hatchets.
---
That does sound relaxing, I'd probably do the same if it weren't allergy season...
---
Clutch boy
---
Scream 4? He still had his robe.
---
Yeah to me like 4 times
---
Why can't we get both? Though now I realized we also need bikini Clown
---
Buff the wraith
---
BuFf the pig
---
I think the bloody overalls and mask are a bit eh, but the Prestige Kitchen Knife is fucking awesome looking, I prestiged my Myers just to have it.
---
Shirtless All Male Survivors
---
I mean, yeah, it's actually easy enough. Only reason you should have anyone alive after 2 gens is if you're playing for chases and there's at least 1 or 2 survivors who know how to use the map. Or you got unlucky and found that good survivor first on a strong tile.
---
Otherwise I say that unironically. The game is incredibly easy nowadays.
---
it fucks altruism and chase points for other survivors because they literally don’t move, and it completely fucks the 1 person who gets facecamped. It’s the same toxic gameplay that tbagging is but it actually has a payoff for the killer since they garentees at least 1 sacrifice and scores of others. The point of the game is to have fun by outmatching your opponent through skill or creativity but I don’t think this type of gameplay really expresses those two facets very effectively. Genuinely curious to hear the argument for this sort of interaction tho
---
Good way for me to uninstall.
---
&gt; I hesitate to say, mostly because the killer community will flip their shit as usual and go "nO! yUo juSS wOnNA neRFF k1llarz! Git guD n00b!"
---
Is the rest of the post as dumb as this? Someone bite the bullet.
---
I also had a Kate who ran around the hatch and stood there confused when the killer closed it last night. We were against a doctor so she couldn't even try to open the gate.
---
I was kinda hoping phones would play a part in his power. Like all the survivors start the trial with a phone in their pocket or something and every now and then he can call them and their phone would buzz and set off an audio notification. Similar to doctors power.
---
When you settle for less you come out a loser.
---
Pig was the last stealth killer? All the prayer beads spirits I play against seem to have missed the memo
---
That was more or less the point I was making. I know when the first movie came out I certainly didn’t have a cell phone. No one in my family did.
---
Finally, the Huntress is turning into a daemon of Chaos.
---
Oh yeah, I got what you meant. Simple mistake
---
Tapp. It’ll be a saw cosmetic line 😍
---
Love it lol
---
Oh my god tapp is getting skins too &lt;3
---
I certainly learned my lesson though.
---
I think if you camp (stay in a proximity of 16 meters of the hook without survivors being there as well) you lose points in the chaser emblem.
---
The movie is a disgusting, over-indulgent exploration of Rob Zombie's grindhouse style, which barely feels like a Halloween movie.
---
Michael is too brutal.
---
The gore is distasteful.
---
Laurie is intolerable.
---
Michael speaks, and says... "die!"
---
Loomis is an insult to the memory of Donald Pleasance.
---
IT NEVER EVEN USES THE HALLOWEEN theme!
---
And I say all of this as someone who, for some years, considered Rob Zombie's Halloween to be better than the original.
---
Would love to see these in movement. Feng, Tapp and Huntress are looking amazing, but Wraith seems interesting too!
---
That mask was awesome until it became disconnected and the blood would leak out onto you
---
I agree, bhvr really stepping up there game :)
---
I didn’t camp.
---
Ah gotcha I saw some thing saying the new survivor is brooke maddox
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERY DAMN KILLER ON XBOX RUN NOED, RUIN AND JUST CAMP RVERYTIME THEY FIND SOMEONE! WE GET IT YOU HAVE A LITTLE DICK AND ARE TRASH TIER AND LACK CONFIDENCE BUT DONT RUIN THE GAME FOR OTHERS BECAUSE YOU SUCK ASS. THANKS
---
Yea, because killers don’t have to deal with survivor bs either ? Go away survivor main.
---
Erm, not as toxic as this shit
---
oh Boy you'll love playing against the houdini build then xD
---
That’s the survivors fault, not the killers.
---
This is the 174838383832120866 post about matchmaking, can everyone stop posting about this already
---
Well so much for peeking through the holes now....
---
I DC because the loading screen doesn't change or progress, that's about it
---
I actually find killer really relaxing and can normally listed to music or a podcast whilst playing them but I would recommend a warm cup of tea and some nice music and/or a break for a week or so
---
Insta heal, MOM, sabo squads, 4 tool box gen rush, 4 man swf, 
---
Both sides have to teal with bs sadly.
---
Getting Kf2 vibes from that pic. Would love such a map tho
---
What is the reference?
---
Just says wazzuuuuuuuuu to the phone
---
Removed - Shaming other players + Oversaturated Content
---
And for how long the marked debuff lasts.
---
Well yeah, I’m terms of difficulty, survivor is easy mode killer is hard/impossible mode.
---
I honestly play killer to calm down. I get stress from playing survivor.
---
YouTube normies 😏
---
No I completely agree. I had to stop playing.  I hate when people evade ro say bullshit like "killers have it bad too!" Make your own fucking post about it then. Because posts like yours arent saying killers dont have a hard time too, they're saying the survivor games being experienced are frustrating and you want to vent. At least, that's how I look at it.
---
Well hook auras in particular are very difficult to make out on Ormond.
---
Why, its still a good perk, just because it doesn't give you extra hits mid-chase doesn't make it bad.
---
Yeah I've used it about 30-40 times since it's release and it doesn't really feel that op? Normally when I get hit with MoM it's when im doing sth really risky and that if I didn't have MoM I wouldn't do (like going for an extra save end game or running to a further pallet instead). My killer games it's been a minor inconvenience but other than that I don't feel like I've ever felt like I lost a game because of it like some other killer perks that I know of...
---
I said it before and I will say it again. It should have been the doctor from saw 1. Especially with the perk tenacity. How could they NOT pick him as a survivor, it still pisses me off.
---
Now that's the perfect offering for doctor and legion mains.
---
Calm spirit! :)
---
There is no justice in the world
---
I love his P3, but oh man, this looks hot af. Tapp is one of my mains &lt;3
---
Feng didn't get a skin since they introduced the store I think so I am desperate.
---
Holy shit, good catch
---
bamd
---
Never
---
Tab isn't doing anything. Not sure what's going on.
---
Big oof xD
---
Play With Your Food stacks are too difficult to gain and too easy to lose for it actually to be useful in my experience. The only killer who can even kind of make use of it is the Wraith, but even then there are so many better perks you can get.
---
TL;DR
---
I'm sorry, but I think patrolling the door is allowed
---
How immersed players, that's more accurate
---
&gt; there is 100% no reason for cutting remember mes max time in half 
---
The reason is that it would be impossible for a survivor to ever open a gate once the killer closes the hatch. 
---
A simple solution would have been to keep the perk as it is and make it deactivate once the endgame collapse is triggered.
---
But were is bunny feng
---
sounds like conspiracy but yeah. from very reliable sweet perk it turned into situational crap where only dumbasses can't figure out how to act to escape. and even on Fred it's not as good as it used to be. :c i really loved the perk, never used it much but it's a really sweet lil perk to help you out sometimes especially if you do dailies on killers you're not good with. 
---
and to perks, i'd go further. not just perks but also meta killers like Billy and Nurse are being shoved into high rank plays cause others don't have enough mobility to control Endgame.
---
I'm sure it said it in the description when they brought out recent cosmetics for them both
---
I switch constantly, it's too hard for me to pick a 'favorite' killer. One I hold close to heart is Billy, because I started with him. But lately I have been playing Huntress and Nurse and sometimes Clown
---
The killer opening the gate is for EGC to start. Its basically a concede button. So if its endgame, the killer can only open a gate if one isnt already open, because the collapse would have started. This is why the can only open one, if one isnt open at all. Killers can also close hatch, which starts EGC, therefore the killer doesn't need to open the gate, and cant.
---
Try lowering your mouse sensitivity
---
As long as it stays.
---
I think its a kind of daredevil parachuter outfit for him as The glasses, The blownback hair and possibly The parachute would suggest this
---
They should make them activate in end game and it slows down the collapse timer.
---
Huntress is me when someone takes the last slice of pizza
---
Well tbh I think if the killer finds the hatch before you just having a second shot at survival with the gates being powered is enough.
---
The idea of the perk deactivating during endgame collapse while retaining its previous stats seems like a great way to balance it.
---
That's not true. What the killer sees isn't the same as what the survivor sees. Her idle animations are the same whether she's phasing or not, and you don't see her arm thingy.
---
The passive phasing is to do with when she goes invisible at random whilst running around, making it happen more often or for longer periods. It lets her mindgame loops easier than other killers since if she randomly phases when changing direction, there's no way for the survivor to know that.
---
To be fair, who of us these days actually used or phone for calls? Hopefully he has some games downloaded that key him play offline
---
Maybe instead of kicking a gen, he plugs his phone in to charge it up a little
---
Unrelated but damn, you played that long wall jungle gym really well. Great job!
---
I gotta say, I find it really strange that they nerfed the weakest and least used end game perk and yet buffed NOED. I guess they figured that a killer with Remember Me closing the hatch would really screw the survivor’s chances, but do enough people even run it for it to be an issue?
---
You mean the Gold and Silk Collection? Because yes, we did
---
Probably to hide his impressive package.
---
I’m really looking forward to the beginning of the match confusion on who the killer is, and then you just barely see the tip of that white mask peeking around the corner
---
I haven't played much survivor, but unless your on Xbox I assume everyone is trying to derank so they can get easier survivors while they adjust to the new update.
---
The EGC is alot for some people, it'll get better, just keep playing.
---
There have been others, such as bubba's masks or David's other cosmetic.
---
I did this to someone last night as the doctor but I didn’t let them leave.
---
I nurse main on controller on pc does that count?
---
People like to say its vastly superior on m&amp;k 
---
But it's really not a big difference.
---
Yeah, happened to me too with the Pig: [https://streamable.com/42htp](https://streamable.com/42htp)
---
In my experience blendettes are more prone to dc if you find them crouching against a corner and down them with a chainsaw.
---
n i c e
---
Norma.
---
Some of you may die! But that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
---
Oh my god the Feng is great and YMCA Tapp is pretty fun also
---
Yeah, Tru3 is pretty scary
---
Huntress, I need that.
---
Nightmares fuel
---
They feed on your desperation by providing garbage instead of quality.
---
Flair checks out, I approve.
---
Still very much sounds like you have a stuck key.  Are you having issues is any other windows besides full screen games?
---
Best looking one
---
It's fixed itself :) Dont know what happened.
---
Comments covered it already, also mikeys Tier III lunge is as big as Trappers dick.
---
I thought Tru3 is a very good player before but now that I got better at the game and played against both Tru3 and high hours tournament killers, you can't compare them at all. Tru3 is an  slighty above average killer that literally does on simple mindgames and basic cutoffs and an average survivor. He also complains a lot and his chat considers everything that survivors do as toxic, which can give yoi a very wrong perspective on the game.
---
You lost the first time your team got wiped out before completing the gens.
---
You lost the second time by losing the hatch race.
---
You lost the third time to exit gate RNG.
---
How many fucking 2nd chances do you expect?
---
What is Wraith's costume?
---
I’ve heard it was because they licensed the characters from the saw video games, this why the pig is the killer (although the pig wasn’t Amanda in those games, she was in them) and Tapp, being the protagonist, is the survivor.
---
Survivor only players are so fuuucking whiney. Most have no idea how much thought has to go in to being killer against survivors who aren't even that great let alone actually being good, one good survivor can fuck all of your momentum over. Because they can't play killer (or to afraid too) 
---
This is the fairest it's been for the end game.
---
I'd say it's luck
---
Really bad luck
---
running to a save spot to stand still for 40 seconds to go back to get instadowned by a chainsaw anyway is a bad habit
---
Survivors just standing at the hatch when they can easily escape is also obnoxious.
---
mmmm those boots are badass
---
Its like a mother pinching her child by the ear.
---
Dick long, scarf long
---
So strange, you can see another shirt under the one she’s wearing. They combined her outfit when she wore when she had the RBT on her in Saw 1 with the outfit she wore in Saw 3. Not to say I don’t like it but it’s a very interesting choice.
---
I played 10 games as New Legion yesterday, and got 2-3 DCs in 8 games and all 4 DCs in 2.
---
That's so weird i feel survivor is miles better on mouse and keyboard and killer doesnt make a big difference lol.
---
Hawoink
---
L O N G scarf
---
god that sounds awful. Yeah I just play solo, no swf stuff here. But I get grouped up with people that are swfs
---
Or the Legion was making a smart play by trying to wait out the DS time?
---
How much old is susie?
---
Preferences I guess :) I like survivor movement control to be on a gamepad stick
---
I switch to Omegablink Nurse for an hour.
---
Thats kind of the point. Lmao.
---
You lost the hatch standoff.
---
And he's running a perk to capitalize on it. God forbid the perk be good in the situation where you're supposed to pretty much lose.
---
Extra bonus points if killer dc's and gets mad in post game chat
---
Huntress is wearig an aries skull tho, but close enough
---
New dlc reveals Nea is really Susie without the mask. Or that she’s been recruited into The Legion. And the reveal video is much like the original with David and Frank, except this time it’s your scenario and ends with of the “4” handing her a knife and a mask. Dlc name “Betrayal” or some else cliche. Pffft.
---
It’s all down to the person. Killers do the same in some cases, less cases of course but there are people who expect survivors to adhere to their rules too.
---
What's wrong with that? It just adds extra flavor.
---
Most Op outfit after p3 imo
---
Almost none of the blendettes are good, worthless trash players who drop every pallet without even looping.
---
once again, that's just ping
---

This is so confusing to me because I was playing against a billy yesterday as my first match with the new update. I knew where hatch was and I was making my way to save the only other person in the match cause I wasn't gonna be an asshole and would just message her where it was if I died. Once I'm almost there she intentionally kills herself, great thanks a lot. I run back to where the hatch is only to see billy vaulting the window right next to it. I run onto the hatch but somehow he pushes me off of it????? and shakes his head at me and then hits me and I go through. What?????? I don't understand what the logic was there? The prompt should've went off right? I was thinking that maybe because I was there at the hatch the prompt wouldn't come up but after seeing two of these videos where the survivor is right on the hatch and it gets closed I have no clue what happened
---
I am just wondering who the hell Ghostface is sending that to, does he regularly text with the legion or something?
---
damn, you should've pebbled the killer
---
The fact that this was on The Game map, with the suspense, made it feel like I was watching a Saw film.
---
The smell of sweet karma and justice, embrace it
---
Wouldn't that be more aware of surroundings than healing? Because in that case why heal at all? Just use No Mither all the time?
---
Make some memes using Mina and post them to r/animemes, that should help it grow.
---
Spine Chill
---
Definitely i will be doing that, my games really need that boost in length.
---
I am sure that other killers such as Nurse, Huntress and Billy (I use him heaps too!) are stronger but, i am a huge fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. So LF has a spot on my heart with his "special" grunts and everything haha!
---
I still haven't reached an amazing rank nor anything but it feels as if LF was a bit underrated though.. Even if his Chainsaw isn't the best in the game, survivors need to respect it or be severely punished and it also has that extra boost in utility to break pallets (slightly) faster or trick people into thinking you will respect pallets.
---
What other perks are useful in a killer like him? The build i am using feels as if covered most of his weaknesses. (Finding them quickly with Whispers, getting into closer range with M&amp;A to apply extra pressure and bait them, enduring to mitigate his looping weakness and bbq+chilli because having extra BP and intel is an amaziiiiiiingggg~)
---
We can chat whenever you want. :)
---
Someone knows what's up
---
**a real 1**
---
Can someone make it readable?
---
Yes Insidious looks fun and useful in paper but not so good for my playstyle at all. 
---
M&amp;A seems to do the trick for patrolling hooks with additional utility. :)
---
*Laughs in Grape Juice Momo*
---
Let the long grind begin, have fun!
---
It’s a close contender with Legion for me
---
Now we’d just have to add Hag’s traps and perhaps the Plague to get the ultimate fortress. Survivors will try for years to send in strike teams, but the chest will not fall into their hands 
---
We can call the mode ‘Bubba’s Wet Dream’
---
just the site of that tile would make me say not today
---
you'll be playing with a full team. there's a high chance that one of your teammates is " new ".
---
True
---
They could only afford the license or his voice for a month /s
---
No it’s Dad not ‘you’
---
I like it a lot.
---
Scream 4? The whole vlogging the kills theme, they had cellphones in that movie.... maybe they’re just taking bits from the franchise as a whole?
---
I see. Thanks for the input.
---
Hopefully i can climb the ranks a bit more before having to get those perks. But once i get the shards i'll get them for sure. :)
---
MY COMPUTER CRASHED WHILE DOWNLOADING THE PATCH, I GOT A DISK READ ERROR, I HAD A PANIC ATTACK, I MANAGED TO FIX IT, AND NOW I'M AFRAID TO TRY TO FINISH THE UPDATE, SO I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME AT ALL :(
---
Fucking internet explorer cunt
---
A good build for Cannibal is BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. Also, you can use Bamboozle instead of BBQ if you don't have problems tracking. So you should get Hag, Spirit and Clown for their perks.
---
If it's a really rough match...Go outside for a smoke. 
---
Most of the time I'll move to next game with instasaw Billy or scratched mirror Myers and my stress fades away.

How??
---
also the only killer with a good reason to sacrifice survivors.  she thinks the entity will cure her.
---
No, Leatherface and Ash lol
---
Pretty much gg against a swf team. I try to play both in rotation but more recently have played killer more than survivor, and by far the best thing to do for yourself when playing a killer match is to give up on chases not going well. If you don't and you aren't the best at chasing them down, you run the risk of gen rushing and game over asap. It's not even a bad thing to do, if anything it allows you to reassess gens and go from there. 
---
"Every good killer knows when to give up on a chase"
---
If we keep silent about the issue nothing will be done about it
---
It’s probably due to them being SWF in my experience, a varied teams screws with the matchmaking
---
Often though it’s just video game matchmaking bring video game matchmaking
---
Yeah, Scream and Scream 4 are on Netflix, and also the TV show which I think this DLC is related to
---
I’m actually almost convinced it won’t be a Scream DLC at all, but just a killer with that particular mask. It’s entirely possible that they one got the rights for the mask and not the killer most notable for wearing it. But I just like to be different. Prove me wrong Behaviour. Give us Sydney Prescott.
---
Or lets you use somewhat engame build faster with eg blood warden as survs can 99% gate and still go to the other one
---
I’m rank 1 survivor and nurse and I can tell ye it’s not as easy as that
---
Amanda is NOT a normal human being.  In Saw her psychotic ways led to her sabotaging various traps to make them unwinnable.  John was a good guy, delusional, yes, but Amanda was a murderer.
---
Having the gates powered isn’t usually *that* big of an advantage for a lone survivor in my experience, especially since they’re now on a timer so they have to commit to opening one. There’s no time for stealth and no hatch so if you find them at/near a gate they’re dead. 
---
The biggest problem with it imo is that it gives the strongest killers yet another advantage over the weakest - a killer like Nurse will get the survivor at the gates 99 times out of 100, whereas someone like Freddy is more at the mercy of where the gates spawn. 
---
And considering the high mobility, high tier killers typically won’t be the ones running Remember Me because they don’t need it, it seems even more silly that they chose to nerf that perk specifically.

I think I listed too many
---
I agree, accept if it's the macro spamming flashlight clicky. That shit hurts my ears on a headset and will just make me DC to avoid dealing with it. Otherwise, BM and waste all the time you want - I appreciate having easier chases.
---
Killers finally getting their turn at end game BM you survivors should be happy you had 3 years of fucking around for infinite amounts of time at the end of the games taking the piss.
---
Don't complain less than 48 hours after the killers get a much needed end game mechanic! 
---
2 mins on the ground is far better than being forced to leave the game as killer because you are tired of being fucked with!
---
Also survivors can now escape through hatch even if they haven't done 2 gens. They would have been dead eventually anyway in the previous patch due to no possible escape path, so they got a bit of a buff there
---
yeah I seriously love that one

This skin would be so dope!! Spoopy as fuck too

I find it amusing that these inbred mongrels beg for my attention by spam vaulting or flashlight clicking, but then get pissed off when I give them ALL my attention by watching them die on the hook.
---
Sends mixed messages really. I mean, you wanted my attention, and I gave it to you, whats your problem?
---

Pigtress:
---
gee whiz thanks mr. rank 10 this 30th percentile thread is a big help
---
I’d love to see scream so 🤞🏼
---
I also haven’t played the game in a while so we’ll see if that changes.
---
I mean, it is not really the point of the perk. The perk never did anything in a 1 v 1 hatch situation. The devs wanted the 1 v 1 be exciting for both sides once the hatch is closed and a perk that completely negates the chance of escaping would negate that goal.
---
That said, I think they should have kept it as it was and just deactivated it once the endgame is triggered.
---
there are times when you don't really need to be on full health yet people still refuse to do something because they are injured
---
for example: Surv 1 is on the hook (1st stage), Surv 2 is being chased, Surv 3 is dead, Surv 4 is FUCKING HEALING THEMSELF INSTEAD OF SAVING SURV 1 BEFORE 2ND STAGE
---
Same reason skeleton keys are a thing. Free wins/kills are stupid but there’s plenty of other blatantly overpowered things because ultra-rare items need to feel powerful (Huntress one shot, BNP, etc)
---
A chain is as strong as it’s strongest chain. The elevator idea just wouldn’t work. Otherwise everything else is great and easy to make on the devs part. We already have a bunch of car models from Autohaven, Haddonfield, and Springfield
---
Or just read the frickin description of the game.
---
Left behind is still the worst perk in the game thoug. It is literally useless considering you can't do generators anymore anyways once the hatch is closed.
---
It is only "ok" if you are the last guy and one generator is semi close of being done.
---
You could say it's the GOAT Huntress skin...
---
I should go.

Facts
---
I play both Killer and survivor. Tbh the only time flashlight clicking and tbagging gets on my nerves is when they do it at the exit gate when I'm using a killer  I'm not good at or don't use often like Nurse, Legion and Hag (I can't use them worth crap)
---
As a survivor the only time I t-bag or flashlight click is if ik my friend is being tunneled for whatever reason and I don't want her to get mad and d/c or rage quit for the day so I try to be annoying asf by stunning them, body blocking, tbagging, flashlight clicking, blinding, etc. And it's not that I'm trying to be toxic but that's the only friend I play with on a regular basis and I don't want her to quit just cause a bad killer can't play normally and wants an easy kill
---
I want this so I can yell “STOP RESISTING!” whenever I play.
---
Reminds me of the Banjo-Kazooie NPC sounds for dialogue.

---
no problem, man. It's not really supposed to "help" with anything though, its "salt/rant"
---
Well that’s weird, before I ever got a splinter for pig I bought pig ages ago and one showed up in my bloodweb like a few days ago
---
Thats a scam and you know it.
---
This video gives me PTSD (I don't DC but I get looped hard sometimes and have to break chase and just let them do gen or w/e)
---
I’ve played 6 games tonight. 4 of them have ended half way through the game with the killer dc’ing leaving us with no points, and we lose our items and offerings. Gives the match cancelled message then dc from host. 
---
I’m about to rage quit for the night. What a waste.
---
I don’t think it’s intentional dc’ing.
---
Isn't the post-match walking animation the same as normal in-match walking animation though?
---
With end game you have more options to survive as before. Actually, hatch spawning every time there is only one survivor alive, even if the survivors didn't do a single gen is a huge buff to survivors.
---
But anyways,  I don't get why most survivors in this reddit feel entitled to get hatch every game they are the last survivor. You got a lot of 2nd chances to escape and the hatch is still there. Now you gotta choose between looking for the hatch or camp an exit gate. Since they reduced opening time you should be easy able to open the gate if he hatch isn't directly in front of it.
---
FEEEEENG
---
I'M SHAKING
---
That's straight up bullshit that if the 4 people dc at the very start the killer get's de-pipped. 
---
It should be default a safety if this happens.
---
T-bagging
---
The blood on her chest coming from her neck really shows the attention to detail in how she died in Saw 3.
---
It’s technically true, though the “electrocution” is a very, very mild electrical current that doesn’t do any damage.  It does stimulate the nerve endings in the tooth, though, and hurts like hell.  
---
First hand experience, it’s a really intense jolt.  Has only happened to me with fillings though; never had braces.
---
its like the captain of a college wrestling team vs the emo girl who sits under the bleachers during high school gym class
---
GOOD, FUCK LEGIONS WHO JUST FOLLOW YOU SWINGING COS THEY KNOW THEYLL HIT YOU EVENTUALLY.
---
Good on you for not just telling your friend to DC. Using in-game tactics to combat in-game issues is part of the solution. The other part is getting the devs to punish DC.
---
Just watch you're careful doing this against Billy. If I detect SWF I might act like I'm tunneling to bait bodyblocking for an easy BBQ stack
---
If you are smart, you don't play legion xD
---
that is sick hands down not even a nurse could top that range
---
It is the point lmao. It affects the gate timer doesn't it? Then that's the point??????? Ecks dee.
---
Do you mean MLGA?
---
I’m not that evil
---
Hit the grapes man
---
I still fail to see how this would be fun for the four survivors going against two killers lol.
---
But we love you because you walk right past us! I love being able to do gens and blend in with the tree right next to it.
---
Yep, I knew it was a take on MAGA. Just forgot it's name haha, cheers for that
---
AN INCREASED COOLDOWN ON SWINGS WOULD HAVE SOLVED THIS AND NOT COMPLETELY SHAFTED OVER CONSOLE PLAYERS
---
yea but don't forget what game this is. Number one most toxic community I've ever seen, and thats saying a LOT
---
I believe they use multiple homes in the movie. This comes up in google search though.
---
I mean if I can get gens done and not get found once I think that's pretty skillful but keep r/gatekeeping clothes in a video game.

Dark demonic Huntress I love it.

Leatherface has no realm sadly.

That slut deserves to be face camped tbh.

I always thought Lisa was very young for some reason, probably around 14.
---
Lol yea I had to do it yesterday against a Freddy. He had Dying light and the red add on that started obsession in dream state (she was obsession). He hooked her and planned on camping so I unhooked her with BT. He put us both back to sleep and tunneled her, she wanted to quit cause we were 3 gens in and she didn't have a chance to do anything but loop him so I was like "Don't quit I'll try to get him off you". Took me a while since he kept ignoring me but after insta healing her, stunning him twice, body blocking a pallet so he couldn't break it after she stunned him, took a hit for her, FINALLY he chased me but went right back after her once I looped him around a t-wall. The Adam was just crouching around the map. He found her since she couldn't get out of dream state and she died on hook (Nea d/ced at the 2nd gen btw). I finished a gen and the Adam finally started one. We tried to do it together and Freddy found us at 95%. Lol he protected the heck outta it but we finally got it only to get NoED active. Adam went down as I opened the door. I was gonna save him but Freddy was camping so he killed himself on hook. 
---
Anyway lol srry for the long comment but I was just giving a quick story. But yeah ik what u mean. Some killers are tricky like that. But then again around Billy and Bubba I try to keep some distance and don't really body block them. And if I do it's only for a very brief moment that way I don't get chainsawed
---
Well, it depends on which film she's from. 
---
IIRC, in Scream 2 she's in college and in Scream 3 she'd graduated from college.
---
Ace's cheata shirt is surprisingly good for hiding

If I remember right, she was 16 was when she died and came back in her current mud-zombie form.
---
GIVE ME THE OPTION TO D-STRIKE  A TEAMMATE AND I AM FINE!
---
Indeed, obvious for everyone except the ones managing the emblem/rank system.
---
Learn the hitboxes, specifically what stuff you can throw over or in between. The hitboxes in this game are horrendous and both work to Huntress’s advantage and disadvantage. If you are unsure what I am talking about, try throwing a hatch in between a tree and watch your hatchet get blocked by air. That’s what you need to figure out
---
Damn! Sounds like a really scary and nasty build to be chased by, i guess that at higher ranks something like that isn't overkill by any means.
---
What i was wondering though, running whispers and m&amp;a as i am doing. Doesn't mitigate a bit not running such an antiloop build? With the lower terror aura it is easier to catch people further away from loops. (Though games seem to last too little without running ruin in such a low mobility killer imho)
---
I mean this shouldnt happen any more, you dont lose pips for leaving. There is no reason for everyone to just leave at the start
---
Yep survivors also depip when a killer d/cs right at the start.  
---
Needs fixing like...yesterday.
---
This lol. It's hilarious reading posts like OPs now that the shoe is on the other foot.
---
If you hang up on me again I’ll get my mallet!
---
Unless you're running charge time addons, don't start revving your chainsaw until you're RIGHT behind the survivor. If you're too far away, they can just keep running and outrun the chainsaw.
---
Know when to use the chainsaw and when to just swing instead. If you try to use the chainsaw while you're near a window or a pallet, it's very unlikely that you will successfully pull it off without some impressive mindgames.
---
You’re not supposed to get out every game lol stop being so whiny
---
It’s still not great as half of the killers. Definite improvement but let’s not celebrate until it’s completely fixed.
---
A clever troll would then use this change you face camp you straight to Rank 1 so you get nothing but Nurses and Billys.
---
Ah okies. :)
---
It's really awesome considering the DBD lore too, that she ended up in the fog after she died
---
You husband now!
---
I find it funny most of the time, its usually a bad survivor doing it. T bagging before wasting shack pallet
---
Insta heal is beaten by insta down perks and add ons
---
MOM doesn't work for half the killers with second weapons, and if used before last gen pretty much worthless if u can't loop or get away.
---
Sabo squads is VERY RARE so idk why this is here.
---
4 tool box gen rush is not as often as u think compared NoED and Ruin combo. And can be combatted by thanataphobia, ruin, unnerving, franklins and that doctor perk (can't remember name)
---
And SWF isn't always bad let's be real, half the time they can just be idiots trying to waste ur time but end up dying very quickly. 
---
As for the NoED and Ruin ordeal, yes u can do all totems. But if u solo queue chances are they aren't gonna be done cause most players try to power through ruin and u end up being the only one looking unless someone else so happened to stumble upon one. So if u don't get them all or u get ruin and ignore the rest chances are NoED is gonna trigger. These perks along with BBQ are the most used perks killers use and I see where this guy is coming from. Ik both sides have bs they go through but TBH I'd rather go against survivors doing the things u listed once every 10 or so games rather than go against killers using the 4 same meta perks and half of them camping/tunneling ever game or so.
---
It seems very difficult to implement. Thematically, pallets between cars doesn't make sense. If it is like a parking garage attached to some kind of factory I could sorta understand, but I feel the factory would need to be the majority of the map. As for the Elevator, I see a number of potential problems with implementing that, just by the nature of the physics engine of the game, but It wouldn't be impossible. With no foliage, hiding can be kinda tricky... and either way it may just be waaay too open to be a fair map. A slow killer wouldn't stand much of a chance, as survivors could easily find each other and gen rush, and fast killers could easily find and down survivors who would have few hiding spots.
---
perks are up to you. Spirit fury-enduring is always viable. Really you have to be a mind game champion with him because he gets looped pretty bad. Learn the timing of your chainsaw. Most of the time you shouldn't use it unless they're in a deadzone or you're right up their booty. Just remember he doesn't have the same map pressure as billy so you have to have a good early game and end the chases in the early game quickly
---
I like the mask way more than the default one, it actually looks like the ones from the movies
---
love this. 
---
I just want more licensed killers to pull more people into the game.
---
sharp hand joe or fedora man 4 today? 😳
---
Isn’t that a visual bug? Whenever i’ve had a killer DC early on it shows a de-pip but once I leave the match and go back to the menu my rank and pips are the same.
---
&gt; home realm
---
Well shit where does Bubba stay at then?
---
I mean in that situation your team hasnt powered the gens and you havnt found hatch first. It should mean your pretty much dead, you lost.
---
I had to fall
---
What buff?
---
&gt; she is mid tier or lower high tier at max if played at full potential.
---
She's literally the second best if played at full potential, a 80% hatchet accuracy Huntress can end a chase almost as fast as Nurse 
---
&gt;She has not alot map pressure
---
Which is what this whole discussion is about, map pressure isn't much, especially when determining the best/worst killers, Chase Times&gt;Map Pressure 
---
&gt; super map dependant,
---
I guess you can make a case for Lery's and the Game, but otherwise she's good on every map, if you count that as map dependent, Billy is bad on those same maps, so that means he's trash right?
---
&gt;gets looped super easy.
---
Not if you hit your hatchets. This is also the reason that Billy is worse than the Huntress, a good huntress can shorten chases to 10s even in a loop, while even the best Billy in the world is just an M1 killer vs a decent looper. 
---
&gt;Nurse and Billy are S-Tier then *gigantic gap* and THEN the killers with map pressure come like Spirit etc first anyway.
---
Billy is behind Huntress because his chase times are garbage vs a somewhat decent survivor. In a decent lobby, nobody is going to get caught out in the open, everybody will be in a loop where backsaws are basically impossible. His saving grace is how he can make up for that time by whipping himself across the map. 
---
Huntress is similar to Nurse where a good Huntress is terrifying to go against, and a bad one is a cake walk. The Nurse and Huntress are the best because A. They're skill dependent and B
---
 Nobody else can reduce chase times like they can.
---
If you need to stalk for 20s, GF is not very good, but if you only need to stalk for 5s, he's going to be just under Spirit, and that has nothing to do with map pressure, but simply chase times.
---
Hey thank you ! Only reason I’m playing him honestly is for the faces and I love his bloody skin so trying to prestige him . I prefer billy all the way .
---
You lost dude, some bad rng aside you lost and lost bad. You arent entitled to win
---
I’m sure Billy would be willing to share Coldwind.
---
Stages take a minute each. Healing takes 30 seconds, usually. The way of thought could be: Survivor 1 is being chased, 2 is on first stage hook, 3 is dead or saced, 4 could be doing a gen because that is the objective. Almost 2 gens can be done while someone is on the hook.
---
Did you miss the part about the exit gates sometimes being too close together?
---
That's an issue that kind of creates a problem with the mechanic of an endgame. IF the gates were at complete opposite ends of the field then each of us has a 50/50 shot at that point.  
---
I mean, if survivors hit all the gens but a couple that are close together that's bad planning on their part. 
---
But the gate placement is set by the game.
---
This creates a no-win situation for the remaining survivor. You're on a timer and the killer is always able to be within easy striking distance of either gate. At that point they can chase you and simply run down the clock. 
---
This is also only compounded by the the toxic shitbags who use the mechanic to waste your time or gloat.
---
Either hook me or kill me.  You've won. Try and be less of a shitty person.
---
Spies from the shadows, prebuff.  
---
It has the exact same effect for an observant killer. Now you can get alerts of people trying to evade you, and see which direction people are splitting off to with no wasted time or effort, and you don't even have to pay much attention now. Previously, the audio cue was more than enough for me
---
It wasnt a great perk to begin with I dunno why they didnt just have it be disabled if the endgame collapse has begun. This would stop it being annoying in a 1v1 after hatch close
---
Thank you ! Do you have to kill people 25 times to get the faces ? Wish there was a counter that shows how many you killed and is it by mori only ?
---
Isn't that the point of breaking a pallet...? It gives you a chance to escape
---
I hope ghostface has a power utilizing the phone, maybe calling a random player and making them the obsession when looking at them, instead of just stalking.
---
Ooo thanks for that
---

I stopped using ruin on everyone but hag, myers and trapper. Other killers dont benefit from it, Good survivors dont care about ruin and you wont need ruin against bad survivors
---
Why is that guy bad?
---
Pretty much dokkaebi from r6
---
It's real
---
It's a pretty good perk. It helps in finding ruin and taking out noed so yeah, running it is a good idea. I will say though that running it with swf is better than running it solo
---
DON'T FORGET THE PART IN THE ENDGAME CHAT WHERE THIS SURVIVOR WILL BLAME YOU FOR BEING USELESS AND THE KILLER FOR CAMPING!
---
The one thing LF has over Hillbilly is that his chainsaw is way better in tight maps like Lery's and The Game. Basically in any map where Hillbilly can't cross-map sprint, Leatherface is the better option imo.
---
Feng Min Players👉🏻🚪
---
If you mean for longer-range hatchets:
---
Learn to lead your target when using uncharged shots. And the drop hatchets have at charged and uncharged levels. 
---
If the Survivors shows themselves to be good at moving side-to-side, only use fully charged hatchets.
---
Challenge yourself by having matches where you only try to down Survivors with Hatchets.
---
Practice makes perfect.

No dude you weren't there feng fast vaults into the house then I hear freddy I get into a locker the feng sees me get in hes putting feng asleep mean while feng is pointing at my locker to sell me out...  like why??  So when feng was on a hook I stand and point... seems fair..

THIS GAME DRIVES ME UP THE WALL
---
If the time to open a gate was even shorter it would be inbalanced as well. What would be the point of closing hatch? It would be a 100% escqpe every game. You're not entitled to leave after that many chances then
---
r/whatthefuckstockphotos
---
once you find a match, DC, do that for a while until you get to green ranks
---
Freddy is probably the worst killer in the game. Legion and leatherface are pretty terrible too
---
As a survivor, only with a key.
---
when the killer is busy chasing someone and you are the only one who could save someone you SHOULD go there and save their ass before they reach the next hook stage if that's possible

---
Nah, you can stay.
---
The perks seem cool, but the character himself is kinds weak... and there is just so little control here, as the killer you want to remove uncertainties, not encourage them.  
---
ANd what would he look like? Like you have a concept here which is neat but would it just be a guy? You know what I mean?
---
So you’re screwed otherwise?
---
You either get really patient or become toxic. That’s the final form of people in this game.

Don’t get tilted over dumb stuff, best advice I can give you.

Right now, endgame is kind of new for a lot of players, and they want to see this badass Entity's Mori (which let's be honest is way cooler than all killer's Mori...). It should probably be less frequent in a few weeks.
---
But I think Devs should give the last survivor a "Give up" button when downed by the killer in order to trigger the Entity's Endgame "Mori" and avoid this behavior.
---
We need more RvB memes
---
Disconnects? In my lobby?
---
It’s more likely than you think
---
You get the can a lot, the tributary and whale cum tyoontay
---
Tryhard for wanting to play stealthy? What?
---
Hehe looks like the foot is on the other foot that is now in my trap. Yes. - the trapper.
---
Your build is great tbh, I don't think you can make it much better than that. You just need Ruin to slow the game down and maybe a Spirit Fury to help you on chases, since Bubba os basically a M1 killer. Its a great combo with enduring.
---
You have to open one of the two gates. If they are far apart enough and the killer has little mobility then you can probably get out. If the gates are close together then GG. 
---
It’s fair in my eyes and grants killers a better chance of a 4K than before. Now if the killer finds the hatch first, you’re much more likely to die. If you find it first, you’re out. No more standoffs.
---
With the last 3 killers we received having 3rd person mori's, I'd feel it be nice to have this one be in 1st person
---
nurse need a rework/nerf asap. so unbalanced/unfair, also super unfun to go against. My suggestion is remove the lounge attack completely at very least (kinda like tier 1 myers), 3 blinks max. even then she still kinda broken.  
---
i would love to understand the logic behind creating structures and tiles to have players learn how to play around them and right after release a killer that completely ignores the fundamentals of chasing in the game.  the killer that need a rework the most and for the longest time, only reason they dont do it is because from what i can tell only PC red ranks complain (as they suffer the most from broken Nurse) not like legion where everyone complained across all ranks and platforms.
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
Would it be too crazy dropping bbq as suggested above? LF doesn't benefit THAT much as high mobility killers from it.
---
Don't worry, we have your back!
---
Well that was sick AF
---
"The TV's leaking"
---
You can if you want to but I personally can't resist the bloodpoints bonus. It's too much for me to throw away
---
Why do killers get so butthurt about 'teabagging'? Its pathetic...
---
Me putting iron will on my camo jacket black jeans Feng Min vs Blue hair Pink Skirt and Ballerina Dress Min next month
---
I'm bad at the game, because tbagging,"emote", and flashlight clicking is shit stupid people do, and stupidity triggers me. But I'll take you're advice, can't wait to stay between rank 8-11.
---
(Context, Trapper/Pig Main 1200+ hours, avg rank 1-2)
---
I don't main Survivor or killer so I can't get bored. Because when I do I just switch to the other game mode
---
The word autistic was unnecessary
---
I have now
---
Because they have knifes lmao
---
Unfortunately i made these angles, but im sure theyll be similiar if not better.
---
I honestly wish we could have a maskless pig. I know, it wouldn’t be good for the game, but it’d be pretty cool
---
She’s taking tips from Noob Saibot in MK11 :D
---
Nice these look really good.
---
Open in another tab
---
Do not open tab, wait for tab name till it charges
---
Look at preview title
---

Probably will blow over once people see the death animation in game
---
That is some next level player name censoring, haha. Nice job!
---
UwU
---
Is there an old man Myers skin?
---
ahahha i love this, the trying to start some drama bit ffs
---
Who says you should? Look at it from this point of view. The goal is to escape. Doing gens aids in that goal.
---
See when a killer complains about gen rushing survivor mains usually say 'doing the objective'. My point is doing gens is the game.
---
Thx :)
---
Some people do. They usually do gens and hook rescue responsibly. Need more Tapp mains in this world.
---
Nono, we wan't to punish people who DC not reward them.
---
"felt cute. Might hook a Meg later. IDK."
---
Oh yeah, those delicious bloodpoints!
---
But i think i can do the sacrifice.
---
What you think about M&amp;A/Whispers/Enduring/Ruin?
---
M&amp;A + Whispers is super strong combined together imho.
---
You can sneak up on them and jumpscare them with the saw further away from pallets and gain the much needed map control.
---
I know that i NEED Ruin, working against the clock sucks when time is so limited.
---
Enduring rocks, making people think you are afraid of pallets and then completely disrespect them out of nowhere has gotten me so many kills. I can only imagine combining it with Spirit Fury but Ruin is a priority anyways.
---
Honestly I lowkey think Wraith should be the fastest killer, just based on his concept. But idk if asking for a slight speed buff is too much, cause then bloodlust wraith would be broken.
---
everyone talking about Feng, Huntress and Officer Tapp but are we all gonna ignore the fact Detective Tapp has a fucking boner?
---
Time to get the Mori with Frank's mixtape and cold dirt
---
It’s all good dude
---
I don't think the devs of this game are that bad, they are really passionate about it. And i think they care alot for the comunity. But making decisions is not that siple, they probably have to do meetings and alot of people need to agree on making changes. Thats why they get the comunity feedback alot. If you are disliking the game you shouldn't throw shit at it, you should or give feedback on the official DBD forums, or stop playing the game. You don't need to be a douche about all the problems the game have right now.
---
Lightborn, that outta teach them pallet blinders a lesson.
---
D'aww poor baby Dwight
---
The only licensed dlc that wasn’t leaked was Leatherface
---
He was trying to avoid making his text big, since having a # at the start of a comment removes the hashtag and makes the text bigger.  
---
   
---
#Like this.
---
Lol not really what I had in mind, but alright! 
---
But! He still gets wallhacks in his base kit, then.
---
He is really gonna shock the competition
---
I by no means am criticising all killers or survivors. I posted this clip because I have had this a lot over the past few times. It just annoyed me was all. I stuffed the loop up at least twice and killer couldn't get a hit so he dc's. Killers aren't going to get better at the game by dc'ing because they lost a chase. This killer had plenty of time to either get a hit or give up and move on. 
---
Survivors dc'ing to get the hatch is annoying but not much we can do. Devs need to revamp the penalty for repeated dc's within a period of time (surely they can track manual dc's from automatic crashes).
---
Hopefully Dedicated servers addresses this issue, unfortunately with me being in the Australian region, I can see dc's still being a thing due to no Oceania server and most likely worse connection.
---
PS- Not having ago at you. I'm just voicing my opinion
---
I mean the only part of GF they own/have the license for is his mask
---
I second this.
---
Very good build. Whispers is a great perk and synergies really well with m&amp;a because it makes bubbas terror radius 24 while whispers is 32 meters, telling you that a survivor is close while the survivor not knowing that you are. Ruin is pretty much mandatory and enduring is really good for disrespecting pallets and eating ds. Combining it with spirit fury makes it even more deadly but you don't really have to, enduring is great by itself
---
Do we know if the entity speaks to the killers in a way other than through violence (such as with Bubba)?
---
ghostface is from the late 90's, which is why his phone is a flip-phone
---
It's happened more than once this week with the gates and it's not been that often I've been playing that got to that particular point. This suggests it may happen more frequently than one might assume. (and I seem to remember somebody else talking about it.)
---
The GG EZB ABY got me hard
---
I can't wait for all the "ARREST ME DADDY" memes in the future
---
Immortal David
---
Leatherface shares the swamp with Hag. Grim Pantry is his map.
---
Its not them punishing you for being good, its that people dc after r5 cuz everyone is sweaty af there
---
So if both a survivor and killer are standing on hatch waiting for it to open and spamming m1/space bar respectively, who wins? Is it just a matter of who clicks the fastest? Or maybe the killer's prompt to close it is available slightly before the survivor's? Idk
---
Let's welcome the teammate of the year! You can't escape on your own. You are killing your teammate so you can get one more gen done, while saving them would double your team's repair speed
---
Hey, that's pretty good!
---
Me: *owns fully black suit for Adam*
---
Also Me: MATH SWEATER MATH SWEATER MATH SWEATER MATH SWEATER MATH SWEATER!!!!!!!!
---
You remember all those jerk survivors you had as teammates who would just tea bag forever at the exit gates, well hate to say it but their sins are our punishment. Killers enjoy your revenge. I accept my punishment that the toxic mains have brought on me.
---
Why not?
---
I believe that the clown should be as it is in the movies. The clown could be used as common fear amongst all survivors but focusing on individual fears grant abilities
---
Where is your source?
---
To defend the killer, long walls can be really frustrating if you really need pressure and the survivor is good.
---
To bash the killer. LoL he could have easily gotten multiple hits and the absolute brainlet even tried to mindgame a longwall pallet.
---
Can doc just go back to being the DC king
---
Hey chameleon
---
Good point. The fact is that both sides are wrong and it's obligatory to have a penalty for DCs
---
I'm going to have to agree, Mikey it was a good run and I'm sure I'll stop by time to time
---
I show leg. Get you in mood.
---
in what software is possible this?
---
Silly Dwight! Of course trapper got cakes
---
I don't know, you may be right, the teabagging wasn't necessary even if it was BM from the killer
---
The truth in this thread is being downvoted. Yet more proof that most players in this sub are Urban players who can't deal with getting chased
---
With the new update it seems like they got rid of moonwalking on consoles tho
---
ez baby killer
---
IF YOURE GOING TO GIVE ME NONSTOP KILLER DAILIES, MAKE IT SO I DONT, AT RANK 20, HAVE TO WAIT 15, TO 30 MINUTES FOR A KILLER GAME.
---
They did this was a clip the day before end game collapse update
---
Is it just me or does the blood on his clothing somewhat blend in with the color of his outfit? It still looks pretty good though, especially the mask.
---
I love stalking a Claudette like that as they crouch in place thinking I can't see them.
---
She gonna impale herself on dwight next?
---
Watch out, we got a badass over here
---
*bing bongs sadly*
---
I only play killer but when I hook someone and nobody tries to save them while I'm chasing someone else, I just sit and feel bad for the poor guy who got left by his "friends"
---
The first time I died on first hook with 3 teammates still alive but just potatoes was honestly shocking and utterly horrifying for me.
---
&gt;The Claudette on the left is much more likely to be licking walls all game and ~~going down~~ *disconnecting* in 5 seconds after being found.
---
Moonwalking on consoles is gone now??
---
Oh alright
---
unlucky.
---
U can only do it like a pc player does it looking behind then
---
Honestly I'd actually really like a new SAW map. Obviously I'd rather have something like the Party House from the first Scream, but anything new works for me. Completely okay with this idea
---
No Anime here
---
I'll laugh if you give me an extra $1. 
---
$3 to make someone laugh, you're getting off easy here.
---
You didn’t have to type that.
---
I feel like Jeff and Tapp would hold their own as well. Definitely Tapp. Jeff might just be a sensitive artist that happens to be surprisingly big. Tapp is trained, and has dealt with crazies before. He decks Susie and puts her in a lock. No sweat. Even with the entity enhancing strength. It's still small girl vs. grown man. Entity can't make you heavier when you're 105lbs. and getting tossed around like a ragdoll.
---
Iveonly unpacked ghostface and pig ..ilposthem first.. then ill do the rest in weekend
---
You gave me my new favorite sub. Thank you!!
---
Ya, for the first half of the game the goal downing the survivor is rarely an option due to how many pallets and windows there are, best he could have hoped for was an early drop.
---
Thank you so much!
---
So them standing on the hatch has the exact same effect as them closing it. That's the point, it's just BM to drag it out.
---
Looks amazing! So freaking cute!
---
You can play stealthy just fine without going out of your way to make a “stealthy” outfit. So yes, tryhard.
---
Oh ok lol.
---
Definitely, they might release a knockoff party house from scream just to keep it as close as possible but honestly, if I want to be in a licensed map, I want it identical as possible, just give me another saw map if they're gonna do that :P
---
Ruin appeared quite a few times and I think it was last seen a month ago. Although it'll probably appear very soon I really suggest you get the hag because she is an amazing killer and aside from ruin she has devour hope, which is one of the most fun perks to run, and I definitely recommend that you try it. Sadly it's a hex perk so most of the time it won't survive but if it does, oh boy is it a great time. Good luck in your games!
---
I love that it's a flip-phone.
---
I think will like your work regardless because of how many great things you've done for this sub
---
Uh-huh, just like that first kill in the Scream 2...
---
Are there anymore , specifically Kate ones? Hahaha

---
So fcking True
---
I'm using blender
---
Yewh, hard to say it it was BM or not. But you can see that the timer for DS is almost over... So... She was slugged a while already so i assumed the killer is waiting as long as possible to.pick her up. If the timer would just've started its whatever
---
Okay, I think thats it, thanks!
---
 *shrug* I just go with what the devs have said about killers/survivors.
---
ah all is clear now compensation doesn't apply to games design
---
She needs some lotion on her skin, it’s so dry looking
---
with something else?
---
It's completely up to you tbh, If you think you don't need the info and the Bloodpoints BBQ provides, do whatever you want. You must adept your build to your playstyle, even tho "patrolling survivors you'll be hooking" will make you lose some points for hook proximity and the survivors will be salty as hell in the chat
---
God I wish that were me
---
I got messaged for using omega blink and getting a 2k with the last two ok death hook.
---
So David was just camping the hatch then.
---
They are working on it and said once dedicated  servers are implemented they will have a penalty
---
Yeah, I run looter builds because it’s fun. I keep getting fucking rainbow maps
---
Poor Dwight
---
The Huntress, same(ish) as Bubba, but it's just her and them mentality of a child, so she doesn't know what she's doing is wrong ,plus she save the girls
---
We got ash as well
---
One solution. Play nurse.
---
i have all those software XD, but its so difficult for me, i know about umodel, but... 3ds and blender its hard ^^
---
Question: In this case, would Ruin still be totem-based?
---
If you want it to retain its clear white look, then don't use the prestige version.
---
I expected rage.  Got a damned pun.  Take your upvote and shove it up your nose.  Hard.
---
I don't see any problem. This is the price of getting 5 gens done against leatherface which doesn't give up chases. You get caught - you die, while others escape if they're smart enough not to die trying to rescue you. 
---
It's all fair
---
Yes, its to delay the survivors at the start of the game, you could even have it that ruin breaks after your first hook
---
Well we were talking about not needing to always be healed and you turned it into "you should do gens and let others die" and now you're telling me that I assume too much?
---
you man really are something else. 
---
(I'm a killer main too btw)
---
For self care, no, you should have to use a perk slot for it.
---
For ruin, they need to balance the game properly so that its not needed on basic M1 killers and then nerf it.
---
Lave you seen legion? He looks like he crawled through someones asshole and came out of their mouth.
---
if I do get banned can I get unbanned by game support or something
---
So I was playing Bubba, just trying to do a ritual on him since I don’t play him a lot and I encounter this one toxic meg who’s a big fan of teabagging. Having finished my rituals and not really caring about my rank, decided to simply reward his toxicity and facecamp him. He got real salty after and messaged me, which I thought was kinda funny due to his profile
---
People who used to play Legion by tunneling and spamming frenzy aren’t going to have a good time, but I really enjoy the new Legion. You can still tag as many people as possible with frenzy, focus on one, and with a fuck your pallets build and 115% movement speed chases don’t last very long unless the survivor is a god. 
---
My one complaint is the complete drainage of power on a missed attack, which feels like serious overkill on top of the fatigue. If I miss an attack at 40% of my power left, I wish it would just stay at 40% and refill from there like it does if you manually cancel frenzy. I hope BHVR adjusts that because the fatigue time already lasts several seconds and then you have to wait for your entire power bar to refill. It’s completely unnecessary for a 100% non-lethal power IMO.
---
Oops my bad and how is that sweaty? Do you even know what that means? An example of sweaty would be me running bnp with white ward and every crutch perk possible. It literally takes 5 seconds to put on an outfit and no amount of skill or effort.  Don’t even see what’s wrong with playing stealthy as long as you’re not screwing over your teammates.
---
“It takes less effort and map awareness.” Got it. Thanks. It’s a good perk for people who are figuring out the game still, I never said otherwise.
---
I'd say they are fun to play still)
---
Also, next killer is most likely licensed so you won't be able to get him with shards. So, I suggest getting Legion:)
---
Since when was this a rule? Pretty sure you mean glasses. Hit as many brace-face's as you like, it's not as if their teeth can get any wonkier.
---
This, Imo the best prestiges are Legion, Spirit, Billy, ad freddy. Especially freddys prestige glove.
---
Huntress is overrated, btw 😂.
---
visions of ghostface creeping up on some survivors repairing generators just to plug in his phone
---
This is good!
---
Herobrine -&gt; Ghostface
---
Change my mind.
---
Odd, I usually stay up to date pretty well on developer communication, and I still missed this.
---
I'm kinda glad to see those numbers though, because I get this accusation so much. I don't think Killer Mains understand that Altruism is a thing in this game, or that it's possible to get more than one survivor in their game who understands counterplay to their killer power. 
---
Hell, yesterday I was in a Clown game, and in the post game chat I [grilled one of the other survivors on my team](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bm9odr/create_a_shove_mechanic_for_exit_gate_latches/) for trying to get me killed, and even though only two people survived, the Clown still said "cute little swf" and went on saying we sucked and DC'd immediately after. 
---
TL;DR it's nice to see BHVR telling Killers "no, you're just bad"
---
Okay okay fine, let me rephrase that more politely.
---
It's nice that they shined some light on why SWF shouldn't be removed from the game, since it isn't as oppressive as Killer mains are claiming it is.
---
I thought of this again while watching evil dead.    Could have used the lisence for "the evil" when they picked up bruce campbell.
---
lmfao, gotta respect the commitment
---
YOU HUSBAND NOW
---
oh mi owa mori shinderu
---
If you enjoy playing other M1 killers, you’ll enjoy playing Legion since that’s essentially what he is now. I like him even after all of the nerfs, you can still tag all of the survivors with frenzy and finish chasing one at 115% movement speed. He’s definitely weaker than a lot of other killers but I still think he’s a lot of fun.
---
Wow I never knew I needed this until now.
---
No fuckin way....  NO FUCKING WAY. I JUST CAME WITHIN 3.67 SECONDS
---
That's why Enduring is meta.  Eat a few pallets, break chase when you create a dead zone and chase the little shits to it.  Bonus points if you hook them in the middle of it, too.
---
The reason I think why michael and now ghostface are the best scares is because it doesn't alert you with a loud noise, you just look around and suddenly notice him staring at you, and you can only wonder how long he has been sitting there watching you without you knowing. Shit like that puts my hairs on end. That and nothing scarier than turning a corner and running right into no terror radius myers on game or lerys.
---
It's beautiful.
---
I think your on to something 🤔
---
This is terrible play on killers part, but after making such a huge blunder and letting the chase go for so long there's no problem with securing the only sacrifice he's going to see. There's nothing wrong with face camping in this situation, the real problem is that he put himself in a situation where face camping is his best option. They need to learn how to play killer correctly.
---
Awesome sauce
---
He got the 4k because they did exactly that
---
you'll need 6 totems then
---
It's been that way for some time now, so even before the mid-Chapter patch. Hope this gets fixed soon.
---
So like, Pig awhile crouched, wraith while invisible and Ghost in his Shourd
---
not the best idea in this scenario
---
As a Killer main I grant you the T-Pass
---
i dont understand what you are saying happened....billy tried to close it and failed and you got through or you got cut off by bily while trying to jump in?
---
Sorry man, I think you're just gonna have to eat it
---
Really? I haven’t noticed this.
---
No cause Feng Min players are weebs and should all be exterminated
---
Yeah he is a victim in the first one that's why he could be a survivor, duh. I don't care if they discard later movies for him to be playable.
---
i am a survivor main and i am so sick of survivors thinking if they are last one alive that they are are entitled to the hatch....when i play killer and there are 2 people left i always make sure both are down before i hook one of them because the point of the game as killer is to kill everyone so i do my damndest to do so but then one will dc while i go hunting to other sometimes and tell me afterwards that if i had played right and killed one and let other find hatch that people wouldn't dc...and i'm like play right??? i kill you survive! lol like i said i am survivor main and only play killer very little but even as survivor i know im not entitled to get hatch and i know that i can't win every single match...soooo many survivors dc everytime they are going to lose...its pathetic
---
I was honestly waiting for billy to come flying in and smacking into you all.
---
Just seems like a mix of Legion and Spirit
---
Big rang
---
an afk Player? cool
---
Is this leaked too? Or how do we know?
---
survivors tbagging and pointing  after stunning you or blinding you is obnoxious so when they get got i understand why the killer nods his head. I am survivor main so if i am running a killer for a few minutes and giving him/her a hard time and then they finally get me then i fully expect them to nod and probably camp me because they realize how big of a threat i am in wasting their time and the nodding is them saying yea you might be good but i still got ya!
---
Definitely sucks it happened but you shouldn't be too surprised. In the rare chance I loop the killer for 3+ gens I fully expect to be face camped the remaining time.
---
Your team is dumb for attempting a save on a face camping Bubba when they could run.
---
Sorry I prefer Joey’s cosmetic you broke boyes
---
Ameerrricaaa
---
*PICK UP THE PHONE!*
---
Simple Solution: Closing the Hatch does not start the Collapse and, instead, will power the gates and spawn a skeleton key in a random chest in the map. Now the Killer has to find the survivor ASAP in order to make sure they don't leave through a gate or open the Hatch again.
---
someones mad their unfair killer was made fair
---
Lol even Laurie gave Michael a run for his money in the first movie constantly attacking him. I think most survivors could either just about handle or destroy the legion outside the idea that the entity is toying with the killers and survivors minds and bodies
---
Might be a bug
---
Even non physics stuff glitches the fuck out and shows exactly where you are, so id love to see how awful some high end physics would play out
---
he be like "IT SMELL LIKE BITCH IN HERE"
---
the p3 mask reminds me of the halloween ghostface masks that there is a plastic casing over the mask where there is a pump with a tube and when you squeeze the pump it makes blood drip under the plastic where it looks like blood is running down the mask face :)
---
If you mori someone it should take a screenshot from the first person camera and let you save it to computer
---
**SPIDER...GOD!**
---
Claudette.exe not working. Please immurse in tall grass to reboot.
---
i think its a visual bug, i've noticed this during and outside endgame for me the exhaustion meter stays with a sliver left to finish, or it just stays on screen for a bit.
---
ittle go away eventually when the perk highlights again, just remember to walk \^\_\^
---
Dwight is about the only one who’d be scared of them haha
---
Well if you make a really good case you can get away with it. I did it with Soul Calibur 6 and told them that it is basically Soul Calibur II and asked for a refund on Steam Wallet so I could purchase another game.
---
“It is absolutely sweaty that you’re trying to squeeze and vantage out of every little thing”- Hyperbole, what every little thing are you talking about? We were only talking about the outfit and stealth. And do you really think behavior/devs didn’t know what they were doing when they gave Claudette those type of outfits? Gee, you’d think if it was an unintended issue that several years later the devs would have done something to fix  the problem... unless it was intentional.                       Lastly, it’s not sweaty. Unless this outfit had some really ridiculous requirements to get and or severely impacted the survivors gameplay then I could see your point. But it doesn’t and so there’s nothing wrong with using them either. Your only arguments seem to be a bad definition of sweaty and misuse of the word tryhard.
---
No it was definitely legit. There’s even a been a leaked mori for him, and the devs themselves confirmed it.
---
NO BECAUSE THEYRE SUPPOSED TO KILL ME AND IM NOT A LITTLE BITCH WHEN I LOSE! GET THE FUCK OVER IT
---
Thanks mate
---
How were they unfair?
---
Nice chest hair.
---
Nice trail.
---
I'd buy.
---
Dude this mori is amazing...
---
Ghostface is most definitely my new main when he releases in the Summer...
---
I can see the awnsere in 2min so I will awnser your question then.
---
YOU SOUND LIKE MY 8 YEAR OLD NEPHEW WHO ALWAYS CALLS PEOPLE HACKERS ON FORTNITE BECAUSE THEYRE BETTER THAN HIM AND HE JUST FUCKING SUCKS AT PLAYING BUT WONT ADMIT IT
---
As a pig main I love this! Also she didn’t get nerfed so idk why people are acting like she bad now
---
The price?  
---
Are you actually insane?
---
1. Survivors are SUPPOSED to complete gens. So stop acting as though they somehow had this coming.
---
2. There are SUPPOSED to be windows of opportunity where survivors can rescue others, even in the wake of a camper, but the Devs somehow forgot to put a cooldown on the charge for chainsaws with an instant-down power. They didn't think people would ACTUALLY play like this since even IF the Killer gets 4 K, he's lost a ton of points by camping, not kicking gens, not getting multiple downs/hooks (more than 4 when the max hooks you can do is 12), not getting hits on other survivors, not winning more chases, etc.

3. There's no "price" involved. It's simply a punishment for playing well at the game, which is fucking stupid. LF got outplayed for 5 gens and his ego can't stand it. No killer should have such a strong camping ability that guarantees a kill. ll killers powers are supposed to have counter play. Period. (That's why Legion was changed)
---
You've got a very fucked up idea of what "fair" is.
---
Wait, killers can’t grab you jumping into hatch anymore?
---
This is why I hate the ranking system, you kept him busy the entire game, basically the MVP, your team won because of you, but you’ll get nothing and barely safety pip.

Deliverance was a must bring perk for me for quite a while because of teammates like this...

---
Yes Officer, it’s this post right here.
---
hopefully they do, but as we all know, the 3 teachables of a character usually don't mesh well most of the time into good synergy.
---
I wouldn't mind if all his perks messed with TR, having a killer and builds made entirely out of jumpscares would be amazing.
---
This... makes sense. Although aside from physical sports (in which you would be smart to wear a mouth guard regardless of braces), you kind of want to do as much damage as possible... no?
---
XD I love how he responds to it
---
I see a spicy cosplay in my future.
---
yea if you use MoM correctly with BT it plays just like Old Borrowed Time where both Rescuer and Rescued Survivors are protected :)
---
Wait is this actually real?
---
I was expecting a shitpost, not a repost
---
Did you even read his point mate? The killer is supposed to have the advantage after killing three guys and findingvthe hatch first. What did you do right in the game that entitles you to having the advantage here? I'm pretty sure it's more than the killer did, right.
---
Oh no you lost a game to shitty rng. Do you know how often you win by RNG and don't appreciate it? But lose once and immediately go cry on reddit
---
We thought that would mean her hatch animation was different too, but unfortunately she just stomps on it too
---
*spits* EAT ME *DCs*
---
Now I want a murderous infant for a killer. As well as naughty bear
---
That’s a fair point, but I think I still prefer the bloodied hood instead of mask. But that’s all subjective and preference and can see why you’d want that.
---
You make mines look like shit lol. Good work :)
---
Nah ruin is fine as is. If you can hit skill great skill checks you don't even have to find the totem. It's only to slow down gens and when i play as survivor i always kill totems just in case the killer has no escapes death anyway.
---
That wraith looks like he got taken straight from Darkwood
---
On my first game as Hag I got to play coldwind. Therefore I never play Hag anymore
---
So far there is no report of someone getting banned for it, so extremely low. However it is one of the few things that the EAC can actually detect, due to the files that would need to be modified. So you are pretty safe, just letting you know the chance is there
---
So is teabagging :D and speak for yourself, I don’t do it at all unless the killer is being toxic. Just shows me you’re probably the same type of survivor this dude is.
---
Did you draw this or is it from a comic?
---
When the dev build was accidentally released, people could use console commands to give killers other weapons
---
I hate how that's a thing like let me catch a person I deserve this win
---
Well if you let the killer close it while you are above it ,you kinda deserve to be sacrificed.
---
After playing with him, I’d put him bottom mid tier. This is my personal opinion. I think he’s really fun to play and the 115% makes him catch survivors a lot easier. That being said, he doesn’t have any snowball potential. 
---
His power just doesn’t feel all that strong. I mean you hit a survivor twice with frenzy and they are completely across a map which can fuck a lot of shit up if you are trying to play tactically. I find it most effective to hit them with frenzy and try to cut them off then pursue chase with a normal attack. Then again I’m not a legion main, so I still haven’t quite figured him out.
---
its a flowy outfit not a gut fam
---
Then they should’ve just patched the bugs and hey getting people who are closer to death is smart and that’s facts
---
Since Jake’s a survivalist, he could arguably fashion a crude improvised weapon to defend himself against some 18yo freshman lol
---
I guess it could be referring to the terror radius removal but we’ll see I guess
---
You do realize, that facecamping is toxic. Now keep up with me here I’m gonna give you a little lesson. If you respond to toxicity with more toxicity, what do you solve? Either way, you were getting outplayed, what right do you have to take the easy way out? Cause he was beating you? What logic is that?
---
You mean for his brothers and grandpa
---
everything but JoJo's was a mistake #ExterminateWeebs
---
When you try to cover up your boner
---
no, it won't, start penalizing players for dcing and they will just start making alts, at this point with the stupid ass pip system, most people don't care about rank anymore
---
Please no more bamboo or dark places for claudes to breed at
---
We’re just speaking of general off-limits things, if we wanted to do the most damage none of this would matter. (Also yes it is smart to wear a mouth guard but they’re extremely uncomfortable and hard to wear when wrestling and they slightly restrict your breathing and I’ve in my experience have never seen any tooth related injuries)
---
omg that was funny
---
Okay I looked at the awnsers and following the norm of 2017-2018 I would have scored between a 9.1 abd 9.7.
---
🤣🤣 times like these are the only times I wish there was proximity based comms. That killer would have died laughing if he knew you had did that
---
Needs more blood on his mask methinks.
---
Might be the only killer I p3
---
I've been outclassed plenty of times, it happens to the best of us. You have to choose your battles tho. If it is clear this person has a build made entirely for the chase, ignore them, move on to their teammates who have gen based builds anyway. You have to play smart, not harder
---
That's a nice Dick right there

This clip is from a recent stream come check it out we'll chat relax trough me a nice follow and just have a good time
---
Yea this is what I’ve been seeing lately. If the survivor isn’t a potato, this is pretty accurate to what happens.
---
At the end of the day they are called "Survivors". Part of the game is making sure you don't die, and with a lot of people being petty and toxic like this bubba here, you need to know how to not get yourself face camped
---
i am usually the runner for my team and that usually ends in my death but that is the point. you keep killer busy as long as possible while teams gets gens done and gates opened....but the big downside is the better runner you are the more likely you are to be face camped and i always tell my team if i am being face camped and saving me is going to lead to you getting hooked then just go....that is my job as runner....sorry but i actually enjoy getting face camped by a killer after running them for a long time because that means i really really got under their skin and that is satisfying and fun....your team made the mistake of trying to think they were as good as you are at the game....not your fault not leatherfaces...you gave your team every chance to win ..so if they ended up dying to then they shoulda took the chance you gave them.
---
I'll try to be nice about this.
---
Many of you don't consider that on 2 platforms, the Nurse is complete garbage. Many of you hold up pitchforks and torches begging for nerfs when you don't consider the Console Nurse players that have to endure so much bullshit just to make it to high ranks.
---
This isn't even a debate.
---
I made a promise to my self never get map things but now after getting 5 Matches if corn after corn with Claudes it's time to farm the puzzle piece
---
the pig, dah. She just puts the beartraps on their heads instead
---
Like I said, I was doing a ritual on a killer that I didn’t play often. So I didn’t much care if I lost, only that I completed the ritual. I didn’t facecamp because he was outplaying me (which he wasn’t), I did it because tesbagging just about every chance he could. That makes him (and anybody else who does anything similar) a loser in my book, one who I’m completely fine with facecamping. 
---
As to “WhAt Do YoU sOlVe,” who the fuck cares? If you tell me you’ve never been toxic back to another toxic survivor, then I just straight up don’t believe you.
---
It might just as easily be said that just because you got three survivors doesn't automatically mean you get the fourth.
---
That's a sense of entitlement.
---
this should be a thing
---
Quickly, eat the GettyImages watermark for survival!
---
And killers are supposed to kill, so what's wrong with a killer who actually kills, even though he risks to lose other.
---
If you think that you must always have a chance then something is wrong with you.
---
I can't speak for others but for me my the prestige cosmetics should be very clearly prestiged. All of my prestige 3 killers are some of the video game achievement I'm most proud of. i really like the look of the killers when they're drenched in blood, and its hard for me to use cosmetics, even ones I bought, over the prestige ones.
---
I maybe be interpreting it wrong but it sounds like the terror radius is turned off until ghostface is spotted by the survivor, so maybe that notification sound plays when the survivor notices and the terror radius is turned back on?
---
As the leader of the Pig's I consider this a personal attack or something(you see what I did there?) I here by declaire you downvoted until your post contains more Pig friendly content.
---
Aye red vs blue I love That show (as I’ve said like 30 times on this subreddit)
---
You forget me, using the grim matsuri outfit on Nea so my bubblegum pink hair pokes out wherever I try to hide
---
It looks fucking great!
---
How old are you ?
---
Idk why you are being downvoted you are technically right. Either way most killers want to the entity kill animation, but survivors are getting salty over this for no reason thou...
---
can you speak english? i think your intelligence is showing
---
you did good you looped him for 5 gens! but in the end he did catch you and he killed you...you did your job he did his....there is not rules about camping the devs call it strategy. if you don't wanna be face camped then don't be the team "runner". It may be shitty that you didn't get to gloat even more by escaping but you did a great job and your team could have got away if they hadn't been so dumb and if you hadn't been so worried about winning that you asked them to come save you, probably in party chat or whatever, if it were me when i am the "runner" if i end up getting caught i tell my team to go because as a "runner" this is sometimes the way the match ends....yea he has an ego problem but apparently you do as well because you are acting like just cuz you did a good  job keeping him busy and looping him that you deserved to escape...that my friend is ego, just saying. Pot calling kettle black and the like.
---
BBQ AND RUIN USUALLY BECAUSE IM A WHORE, SPIRIT FURY AND ENDURING ARE GOOD BUT I ALSO LIKE NURSES, STBFL, SLOPPY, AND IF IM FEELING SPICY RANCOR
---
I had one of those
---
They should see about getting the scream queens killers, season one and two are two different killers, but could be just cosmetic.
---
nah moonwalk isnt toxic. Teabag is toxic, moon walk is stylin.
---
"I'm sorry David, **what** exactly were you going to do again?"
---
That outfit looks absolutely amazing with 4K stuff! Wonder if he’s harder too see in that one or when prestiged
---
Use the perk if you need it as a reminder not to 3 gen yourself dude. Meanwhile I’m going to have a 4th perk that will help me and my team survive, because I already know how to avoid 3-genning. Just because you can’t grasp map awareness doesn’t mean everyone is like that.
---
Yeah that’s what I was hoping for, although not so much a noise notification but more like he’d hear it vibrate loudly and could then zero-in on survivor’s locations. Would make for a lot of fun if the game were more stealth-focused.
---
I assumed this was going a different direction. Perhaps you were looking for a tasty snack...Leatherface...
---
I'm honestly just gonna play him purely to scare people.  
---
Don't care if I win or lose - just gonna creep around.
---
Oooo that’s pretty cool too, yay 👍
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE BEFORE IT SPREADS
---
omg its suu ccuuuuute
---
That would be awesome if each me he mori'd somebody that picture was sent to the other survivors
---
What were you playing against?
---
My idea was that he doesnt make sounds when moving or performing actions as the Terror Radius removeol was mentioned serperply.
---
Why does the pig look better with hatchets than the huntress herself?
---
Not if you aren't using ruin. If you have no ruin, you basically need noed if you aren't good at patrolling gens and keeping them unfinished
---
Nani
---
Imagine needing instasaw to play Billy. :/
---
Was the camera part of the mori or was that you?
---
You need to be higher up.
---
Well you don't really gain anything from high ranks either other than longer queue times and sweatier players. Penalize DCing and you'll just get first hook suicides
---
I showed you my totem answer me
---
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE BUT OKAY I GUESS “I FOUND THE KILLER MAIN” :V [KIDDING BTW]
---
i think the odds double when you’re running BT or We’ll Make It
---
It promised the spirit revenge on her father, so maybe it like mind talks to them?
---
He shouldn't have chased for so long but at the end he probably knew that fifth generator was about to pop and he couldn't stop it.
---
This seems more of an issue with loops and pallets being too long and forgiving (especially since the survivor got the "escape" score when the killer clearly knew where they were and could see them, resetting bloodlust) on certain maps, particularly since there were probably still around 20\~ pallets.
---
Of course he's going to rev his chainsaw to discourage saves.
---
This should be a thing
---
yea, there is no point in penalizing dc in a ban sense maybe take away blood points or increase the number of blood points a killer gets per dc
---
What's wrong with that? SC2 was the best one in the franchise
---
Nah I didn’t mean to say the moonwalking was toxic, but the flickering on the flashlight was toxic
---
Wait so if the winning side wants the advantage it's entitled and BS, but if the losing side wants the advantage its all good? And you call the killer in that scenario entitled.
---
Holy shit you are dense. Also you haven't answered my question yet. What did you do in that game that entitles you to having the advantage here over the killrr who killed three people AND found the hatch first?
---
so nothing happend, thanks for wasting my time
---
&gt; you need to know how to not get yourself face camped
---
Care to elaborate how a survivor can control whether or not they're getting facecamped?
---
or they tunnel you because they know you're the only one on your team who is capable of doing shit
---
"And killers are supposed to kill"
---
Wrong. The entity kills, unless you have a Mori. The killer's job is to chase, injure, obtain, and sacrifice as many as possible.
---
"If you think that you must always have a chance then something is wrong with you."
---
If you think standing stock still and holding M2 down should guarantee a sacrifice, then there's something wrong with you. If you think that killer powers shouldn't have counter play, there is definitely something wrong with you.
---
That would never work as there r people that don't care for getting trophies n has nothing to do with skill at all trophies don't make u a good or bad player
---
Legion is very fun to play. An m1 killer who can get the first hit for free and apply a bit of a pressure all around. I think with a build specifically made to destroy pallets legion could be very powerful in the right hands, id buy but I'm biased.
---
Also ghost face is licensed so most likely won't be bought with shards
---
Lol I don't tunnel as Clown and almost always get at least 3K in higher ranks. How is he bad, if he literally got anti-looping power?
---
Wierd i only see a tumor
---
Yess  respect 🐷
---
I could be wrong but I think OP was solo. From the sound of some of their comments, they did not want their teammates to save them, but they tried anyway.   
---
If they were a SWF, then they've got shitty friends to try and come get them when its all but impossible to save.
---
I agree with just about everything else though. If you run a killer for 5 gens, you risk getting face camped. I see it more as a compliment than anything. It's like admitting defeat, but just taking your enemy down with you.
---
Just make sure to put on a dab of Anti-Camp (tm) brand skin cream.
---
I HONESTLY DON’T KNOW!!!
---
You Like LEG?
---
Noice!!! Indeed
---
😂
---
You like?
---
Yea I should’ve killed myself on the hook, I just didn’t want to depip after all of that
---
Make sure you are recording and save it. When the match ends (whatever happens to make it end) open a ticket reporting them. You will get a rely asking for the video and then you can send it.
---
Well I mean it got a short trailer and there was a set for more than 2 characters like how they did for the spirit one so it was right of me to assume
---
"You have no right to remain silent"
---
Perfection
---
It have been only 20 minutes of him blocking me I’m too stubborn to leave lol
---
IKR! :) i am quite pleased if i earn a hard face camp after running killer for multiple gens like that :) i wasn't sure about the swf thing i was just guessing i could totally be wrong bout that.
---
Ricardo Milos David when
---
Out of 10? If so then damn you're a really good student, congrats!
---
Why do you keep assuming that I use the perk? It's not because I am defending it that I use it, you just keep making it personal. Also, it's not because you don't get 3 genned that you couldn't have done better.
---
I really hate arguing with people like you who always makes it personal and twists the other person's words.
---
I'll stop right here and won't continue interacting with you, but word of advice: try to just present counter arguments, don't just assume how a person acts just because they're defending something. I'd much rather have a civil argument with someone that just gives solid counterarguments than with someone who pretty much says I'm a bad player and twists my words.
---
im fairly certain he was just being chill, cuz of the dc
---
still not that bad
---
And nothing happened out of you commenting that, thanks for wasting my time and spoiling my day :)
---
right lmao
---
because this game is garbage.
---
I prefer playing new Legion over old Legion. It's honestly much more fun IMO. Old Legion was just way too easy to play, and now with this change they've added some level of skill to it, and I personally like that.  
---
Everyone has a different opinion, but I've never had more fun playing as Legion as I am having after the change. I'd pick them up.
---
What the fuck is the T word
---
I dont mean it in the dickish way of "just don't get caught". I mean it as, practice losing the killer, not just having him chase you forever. A shit killer who thinks you wasted their time is gonna be an ass hole if he thinks you are giving him a reason to be.
---
They DID shorten opening time by 5s, or did that get reverted before live?
---
Huh? What rank are you man?
---
nobody likes immersed survivors that just afk whilst they wait for the killer to go away. if nobody gets chased, nobody has enough time to get gens. boring
---
how dare you call nyan nyan cosplay an egirl &gt;:(
---
so cute.. i think you used moonrise head texture.. there probably is a seperate set for this outfit.. eitherways she is cute in this one
---
you should be used to getting facecamped by leatherface by now
---
They tried making the doors quicker, it was really unbalanced.
---
I'd support the doors only appearing for the Killer when initially active, like the do for Survivors.
---
Might be a balance thing. Mask needs to be easy to spot so survivors can know they are being stalked. Then again we have p3 claud so who knows.
---
not get yourself facecamped? literally any killer can choose to facecamp regardless of reason. and you can't always guarantee you will not get caught, even if you're the best survivor in the world. the killer is supposed to be stronger than the survivor so obviously they'll get you eventually.
---
No, I was spectating. He and I both knew where the hatch was and I wanted to see if he would be able to get out...
---
DC = Pussy
---
I 100% agree on that aspect. Killers gonna do what a killers gonna do to get at least one kill yknow? I was more commenting on the “you told your friends to save you comment.” Since I’m not sure that’s exactly what happened. But hey, at least we can agree on the main point lol :D
---
ok I might do it
---
Constellations was a great album tho
---
doesn't the killer wait until you're by the hatch though? or do they just eventually give up and close the hatch?
---
are you aware that you can be banned for still playing on dev build
---
The most underrated fix they’ve done is the CWF see through walls. Definitely one of the best fixes.
---
I was spectating at the very end, and spectating for some reason only shows living survivors. I think the killer took pity but that didn't work great
---
Don’t forget the Tapp cosmetic!!
---
there's nothing wrong with using add-ons. sometimes they are fun, sometimes you wanna be toxic. that doesn't mean the individual using the add-ons aren't skilled.
---
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks...
---
This is so sad honestly, we have to play worse just to have a chance.. Instead of a videogame being skill-based..
---
Let the man run what he wants to run damn
---
&gt; The killer's job is to chase, injure, obtain, and sacrifice as many as possible.
---
aka killing survivors, welcome to dbd
---
NO!
---
...I wasn't allowed my toy knife anyway
---
I want to see your sleeve
---
These photos make it look bad, the bloody mask is actually really nice
---
IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LAST SURVIVOR TO ESCAPE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR TEAMMATES ARE SITTING THERE FARMING EACH OTHER AND THEN THE KILLER FINDS THE HATCH BEFORE YOU AND THE 2 EXIT GATES ARE LITERALLY 2 MM AWAY FROM THE OTHER
---
Well I think the obvious answer is to make rank the biggest factor in matchmaking. At least that's how it works in almost every other game
---
Play more killer.
---
When I'm feeling bad in any way, I play killer. Whether it's stress or anger, I play killer. If I have a bad match as killer, I'll still play killer (if I'm gonna continue playing dbd anyway), might use better addons next match or play the killer I prefer to play though.
---
no
---
Look back at my mistakes think of how I could have fixed them and move on to the next round usually
---
this was pretty fucking obvious to everyone but kudos to you for writing all of this down
---
lol i am anti 4 man teams all on coms i play with other person and i am usually the runner and if i run a killer for 5 gens then yea my ass is getting face camped. They ran LF for 5 gens, they are a really good survivor but unfortunately when you do this it usually ends in a face camp, would you rather the killer just go sit in a corner and not get any kills? lol they fucked up by chasing only 1 person so they make sure they get the 1 kill...just like as a survivor we do everything we can to make sure we get out at the end of the match. and yes sadly the better you are at the game the more hate you get (on either side) i have seen killers play a fair fucking game get a 4k then get called sweaty or called a camper whatever excuse the salty swf team can throw at them just because they didn't get to win that particular match. the fact that she got face camped should be a victory in itself, she is sooooo good at running the killer that she got under his skin so much that he gave no shits about the other 3 survivors, she coulda been the hero of that round but instead she posts a salty message and just looks like a whine bag.....the OP is really good a looping i am impressed but i do not agree that in this instance her getting face camped is taking the fun out of the game, most people would laugh their ass off at the salty killer in this situation and not get pissed just cuz they dont get to escape 1 measely match. I am not arguing with a child so don't expect any more replies from your messages being thrown down at me as you stand on yous soap box behind your pulpit that you have placed at the top of your pedestal!
---
Is franks anyhow good now?
---
She’s still really good even without traps change my mind (maybe not, but she definitely didn’t get nerfed with the whole endgame thing)
---
That would mean things are actually working somewhat properly in game.  Rank 15 is supposed to still be fairly potato, and not stuffed full of ex special forces members kicking in the teeth of dudes who just got the game a week ago.
---
Down voted twice wow. When this game came out that was the only way to kinda check your ping. (By typing 123,123) so the ping indicator doesn't show up for 5 seconds...you people will complain about any and everything about this game. It's come a very long way since 2016 and the game is by no means perfect. How about you make your own fucking game or go play another one. Have a fucking great day! :)

Its 2 minutes as opposed to a literal 5 to 10 minutes. It's not even mildly the same thing. Survivors who went immersed to find the hatch or to just bm would do so for however long they wanted, literally holding the game hostage.
---
The EGC is on a short timer. There is no hostage situation. There cant be. There is a fixed ending time. Noone is forcing you to stay in the game or give up and DC.
---
Completely incomparable

" Wrong. The entity kills, unless you have a Mori. The killer's job is to chase, injure, obtain, and sacrifice as many as possible. " You're hilarious. Finding fault in wording is the only thing left for you, since you know I'm right.
---
"If you think standing stock still and holding M2 down should guarantee a sacrifice, then there's something wrong with you. If you think that killer powers shouldn't have counter play, there is definitely something wrong with you." There is: escape and leave facecamped survivor behind, which punishes killer with losing other victims and getting less bp, not to mention higher chance of losing rank.
---
And just to clear things up. It's been confirmed by devs that 2 survivors dead and 2 escaped is their vision of balance and they said multiple times that survivors aren't supposed to escape without such losses.
---
Yea the nerf could've been a lot worse, the traps are mainly to slow the game down more than actually to kill :D
---
Like I'd be happy if they'd spawn across the map from each other.  Then it gives you some te to find and open it.
---
Which one are you planning on getting? I prefer the pink one that shows some skin.

👍👍👍
---
Plus by the time you reach the end game you should already have at least 2 kills

I mean most good killers can spot it anyway. They’ve played against ninja Claudette’s enough to know about our fuck shit.

I would recommend practicing with his chainsaw in tight corridors and cluttered areas. I can’t count how many times survivors run to trees and los breakers just for me to chainsaw dance the whole way behind them. He can have some questionable collision with objects at times. A Bubba that can chainsaw chase survivors through loops is terrifying.

What about it makes it feel horrible? The collapse makes it so that you have to get out and not stick around. The new hatch mechanic prevents standoffs and makes it so that the whole thing isn't survivor-favored.
---
Well this made me chuckle. Hope I encounter more killers like you lol
---
In b4 "dah killyr ist toxxxix bcuz tbg'
---
Don't knock it till you try it. Usually it only starts when a gate is open, so all it does is prevent you from sticking around and instead get out while you can.
---
I'm not talking about standing at exit gates. I said clearly that I was talking about survivors who get immersed in the map and go either looking for the hatch or just fuck off into nowhere. I've seen it both as killer and as survivor or spectator as survivor. Some people used to literally just run around and fuck around in the map, take the time to go find chests, to fast vault random windows then fuck off into stealth mode.
---
When the exit gates are open there is nothing else for survivors to go towards, making it extremely hard for killers to find the survivors because they could literally be anywhere. There is no objective left, they can just hang out at any spot and wait to waste your time.
---
At times I began to think their goal was just to make me/the killer DC, to make them forfeit their points or something. I have no idea why people did it. But now they cant. Point being these are not the same thing. A literal timer versus endless time where people could just wander the map and wait for you to quit are just not the same.
---
Id love to see it
---
Damn, forgot to mention. Will be getting his skin aswell.
---
Yes, should be live.
---
Do you have more gameplay? Where can we watch it?
---
Both and I will switch it up everygame. But definitly both.

* Hag

* Spirit

* Freddy
---
The way you drew that mask... Legion needs a classic troll face mask
---
He made the mistake of chasing you for 4 gens. He has to live with that choice, and I agree it is scummy af and I can't stress that enough...he's stupid for continuing to chase you at very strong and safe loops.  .....
---
But, with 1 gen left,  did you expect him not to do this? What other legit choice does he have? He has already depipped, might as well take someone with him...what incentive does he actually have to leave the hook? And points is bot  a reasonable answer ... 1 more chase and hook max is all he had time for...which isn't that many points.
---
You can do it while cloaked?  Just imagine closing it as a Surivor is running to it and them thinking "What just happened?".
---
Jason confirmed for Dead by Daylight 2
---
How and who got play time cuz I need to watch that match
---
"Finding fault in wording is the only thing left for you"
---
Really? I guess that's why I completely neglected to add further commentary. OH WAIT! No, I didn't forget. I did add other commentary. Sorry, but your "I'm an instant winner" statement is complete bullshit :)
---
"escape and leave facecamped survivor behind"
---
Another person who doesn't understand that ALTRUISM is part of the game. You are SUPPOSED to make attempts to save other survivors, and there are SUPPOSED to be windows of opportunity for that save. 
---
"which punishes killer with losing other victims and getting less bp"
---
Let me quote my last face camper for you. "I don't care about BP and rank, I just want to ruin people's day". 
---
"2 survivors dead and 2 escaped is their vision of balance"
---
You don't... actually believe that this means ALL games should end with exactly 2 escapes and 2 sacrifices, do you? There's this thing called "averages". Look it up. This also in no way contradicts that fact that facecamping this hard with LF needs a window of opportunity for other survivors for rescue. What if two people are already dead and he's facecamping the 3rd person? By your whole "2 escapes and 2 survive" bullshit, that means the last survivor should be able to pluck the camped survivor right off the hook and walk out.
---
Hmmm. Bug I guess then.
---
I

---
THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Piggy is jealous
---
ty!
---
Oink! UwU!
---
i havent been playing too long but im finally seeing how exciting a new killer can be
---
i didnt feel like this for legion or plague
---
Her change is so non-affecting that it's baffling why people would consider it a nerf. Your last trap should always be on a survivor before the last gen is completed.
---
The only nerf she got was the end-game Blood Warden / Remember Me build not being viable anymore.
---
I'd like to see those if you know where they are, haven't seen em yet.
---
still no bunny feng

Yeah no. I have the plat, I don't want queue times to be longer than they already are

Ghostface player here! Here is my POV, if anyone's curious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9K3V1nBF-I&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I vote for Placebo or Paltrowed
---
What makes you think I’m complaining about the facecamp? No I am complaining about the fact that I get punished for his mistakes and his tunneling.
---
Must be you
---
One of my favorite Halloween costumes was that scream mask that you could pump blood around.
---
 This face, causes me to be upset about the blood not being there
---
OMG! Thank you.
---
tysm for testing him with me, much love &lt;3
---
ok, someone explain to me how the hell that instadown worked?
---
Still depiped
---
What I’ve always done and still doing is put first trap on first person u down and save rest for when they have 2 gens left, maybe 3 if they’re bad. And by the end game you should already have 2 kills so u can just tunnel the one that’s not doing the last gens
---
The guy had two options when he gets his first hook with all gens done.
---
1; Check the gates, which basically means give up on getting any kills, because survivors love to try to unhook in situations like this and letting you get unhooked is just kissing his highest potential kill goodbye.
---
2; Camp to some degree because you know the survivors are going to come and you want a single kill.
---
You're angry for getting punished for playing well, but you're getting mad at a killer for deciding to actually play well at the end here in response. You're saying this end result isn't fun for you, but imagine how salty that killer would feel just letting you get ez unhooked and escape. You're basically saying "don't facecamp its not fun for me", but neither is getting looped for 5 gens and not getting a kill. You're obviously a better player too, but are bad killers just supposed to roll over for good survivors and not get them back in these situations? "Wow you are really good at looping, have a free escape." Is that what you want and expect him to say? Because thats what not camping here would very likely result in.
---
Ghost face looks amazing. Can’t wait for this DLC to drop
---
They insist they’re all above 21 to make sure they’re not minors anywhere lol
---
Randy Meeks admitted to banging one of his coworkers in the 3rd movie in a recording.

Someone that most likely doesn't mean to kill someone else is most likely to lose a fight against someone that is going all in to murder you no matter if they're small or huge
---
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY A PROPER FUCKING LEGION! I LOVE THE CHARACTER DESIGN SO MUCH AND IT PISSES ME RIGHT THE FUCK OFF THAT I'M JUST A GARBAGE PLAYER. I ENJOY THE STYLE BUT I CAN'T GET THE HANG OF IT AND NOBODY GIVES A SHIT ENOUGH TO DIRECT ME THE RIGHT WAY!
---
Me: “BRIGHT PINK GLITTER? YES I WILL BUY THIS”
---
Killer: “Why is there a disco ball on the other side of the map?”
---
im aware, i was just being facetious by using an escape character so it doesnt parse the pound sign
---
I am just done with this game as well
---
Sounds kinda like Nurse
---
It sucks? Not much more to say about it.
---
Then again, the ranking system and pips largely dont matter.
---
Anywho, sucks to have happen to you, but own the fact that you took that bubba on a wild ride. 
---
Again, shame your friends gave him a 4k
---
Are you alright? You have no common sense, you’re acting as if the killer was FORCED to chase just me for 5 gens.
---
#newOTP
---
The morier becomes the mori'd.
---
Not gonna continue arguing with a guy who puts words into my mouth before I even have the chance to respond, but if you do that shit IRL i wish the people in your life good luck putting up with it.
---
Eat a preemptive bag of dicks I guess. Enjoy being salty
---
That's like saying you can't get banned for lagswitching because the program only interacts with your internet connection not with the game.
---
I got about 3,000 and considering how much time was spent crouched down avoiding his sight then there's the fact I got 3 reds and 1 gold at the game so say what you like but it seems to me like there's some more salt to this than I first thought
---
When I first got the game, summer of 2018 when it went free on PlayStation,  I played Freddy since I was a fan boy and got him to like rank 5 when I realized he was fucking ass 😂. I’m also a saw fan boy and I loved the stealth h mechanic so I picked her up and mained since
---
Well, at least Nurse and Wraith are together, XD.
---
Why does her nose look completely different on the right
---
He'd still be loopable, and you'd see him coming as well.
---
Meg was so not 21 in her final year of high school 😭 someone stop the devs
---

---
Some other Killers also seem to have more thought process than just "KILL. KILL. KILL."
---
I thought Meg was in college already
---
I hated the Ghostface announcement. I now hate it alot less.
---
It's actually *worse* than taking aggro, since someone might end up *dying* before you're hooked once, leading to a 3-man game much sooner than would happen otherwise.
---
Well whispers is literally the killer hearing the whispers of the entity so does that count?
---
Give me Silent Hill Shattered Memories vibes. I like!
---
It’s like Billy and Nurse had a baby
---
Fuck. Well looks like I main Danny Phantom now.
---
Love feng but this ain't worth $10. 
---
I'll still buy it but damn.
---
I get camping the only hook when the gates are open, but keeping the chainsaw revved in the face is what makes it real shitty. There's a way to camp your only hook with a gate open without being an asshole.
---
I like to think he actually sends his mori selfies to other Survivors to taunt them in a "You're next" way.
---
First hook suicides are better then dc, you at least get points/bbq stack from hooking that person.
---
Thanks for saying!
---
He's fun. I hooked all 4 survivors once then the rest of the time I just down them, stab them, etc then I let them go. 
---
Still ended up with the highest score despite no kill (26k). Prob could got more of I have  Chilli.
---
Typically I just trap everyone until I have one trap left (no trapping more than 2 survivors though), and save that for the last gen or 2. At red ranks I would rather slow the game down as much as possible since saving them could possibly get you in a situation where you don't have time to use all of your traps at the end.
---
"You are SUPPOSED to make attempts to save other survivors, and there are SUPPOSED to be windows of opportunity for that save." - and killers are supposed to prevent survivors from doing this. And by the way, there are more than 7 windows of opportunity for survivors to save their teammates (adrenaline, borrowed time, mettle of man, sabotage, bodyblocking, flashlight saves, pallet saves) I think that is already more than enough to save caught survivor from being killed and even facecamped. And I'm not even talking about time it takes to catch an experienced survivor (3 times btw) only to make 1 kill.
---
"which punishes killer with losing other victims and getting less bp" Let me quote my last face camper for you. "I don't care about BP and rank, I just want to ruin people's day". When it became personal? If you think that calling me a person who enjoys ruining other people's game experience then it just proves I'm right and you have nothing more left to say. No arguments, only speculation and empty statements.
---
"You don't... actually believe that this means ALL games should end with exactly 2 escapes and 2 sacrifices, do you? There's this thing called "averages". Look it up. This also in no way contradicts that fact that facecamping this hard with LF needs a window of opportunity for other survivors for rescue. What if two people are already dead and he's facecamping the 3rd person? By your whole "2 escapes and 2 survive" bullshit, that means the last survivor should be able to pluck the camped survivor right off the hook and walk out." I already explained it. There are tons of possible windows of opportunity to rescue him so this hardcamping doesn't matter much. If survivors don't run such perks or don't want to save their teammate when it was possible it is not killer's fault.
---
So it seems like the power goes down faster when somebody is looking at him? Is that correct?
---
Low key have been thinking about getting Freddy but everyone said he's bad and I don't wanna waste shards/cells rip
---
So. when you sneak up to a survivor does it go: "HSSSSsssss" cause that would f me up.
---
Well I mean if Pig and Myers gave us any indication with Ghostface, it gets lonely in the Fog.
---
Good. They saved the idiotic gameplay for idiots and put it right on the perk that deserves it
---
1.)Camping isn’t playing good. 2.) why are you trying to defend this killers actions. He literally played shitty this entire game and he should learn from this that you shouldn’t chase a survivor for that long. OP has every right to be angry. Do you know how infuriating it is to loop a killer around the whole game only to lose because he’s salty he sucks
---
Attach it to devotion level instead.

---
Here you go
---
Cant watch :(
---
I've had survivors DC so the hatch opens immediately and their buddy gets out. It's frustrating and makes me want to slug the last two survivors since trying to be fair and hooking one doesn't work.
---
Well if you're a rank 5 survivor and a rank 20 killer of course it's gonna be easy
---
Wait, is he out?!
---
Ngm i watched your youtube vid. His red stain stays while crouched? How is he supposed to stealth?
---
Pinhead maybe? Some of those sounds sounded like Hellraiser music.
---
At Least it’s not 4 p3 Claud’s with flashlights.
---
No, he is not
---
Tase the rainbow...
---
If only this outfit with a regular mask and no red mark could have been the stock one, would have looked way better.
---
holy shit, why are those numbers so awful. I understand the exposed status since it's one person at a time but wow.
---
Hide behind unfinished gens. Hide in lockers. Change direction
---
I mean, there are perks that trumps the aura reading part of BBQ, as well as lockers.
---
He takes a selfie with his mori victim. I'm not sure how I feel about this.
---
His power allows him to delete his terror radius for a bit
---
Just had literally this game happen to me
---
only 5 seconds? what? why?
---
Its clearly not finished. They use Myers Stalking sound, his icon, and they have plagues timer for the Exposed timer as well. 
---
So they praobly arent in cause it isnt done yet.
---
I imagine it’s not finished yet so there’s probably lots of his power he’s missing
---
I’ll bet that the RS won’t be there in crouch in the release build.
---
They need to get rid of auto aim.. it's really annoying at times.
---
Not for me, not anymore. I'm so tired of the devs shafting poor Fredward.  D A R N
---
I don’t see this as toxic, I see this as a bad killer. He’s not gonna get anything point or pip-wise for this game. His shit score will reflect his bad play. I do wish you would get awarded though. Survivors should earn points for gen completion if they’re in a chase when it pops.
---
Typically changing direction could work well but there are a lot of Freddy’s running it so I can never see where they’re coming from
---
What perks?
---
Which is why a nurse has the ability to go through walls
---
It is crutch perk and Carries a lot killers to victory. But distortion works and getting into lockers before they hook the person...
---
Hes not finished its imporant to note. His anmations look really wonky, his sounds seem unfished, and he doesnt have his own icons. 
---
So those numbers are praobly not finished.
---
That was my first thought upon seeing this
---
we have a new hypothesis
---
*hes not a stealth killer*
---
your meant to use his stalk mid chase to set up instadown
---
then use his GF at some point to remove stain/tr to mindfuck the survivor at the loop (with crotch to be used to stop small loops/T wall windows fucking you) and get a hit in 15 seconds
---
it makes the stats make sense (Even if still too low) and the notifications make perfect sense if they are meant to be used in chase
---
i run wake up in my build for this reason. Its a shame they went with a simple hatch closing mechanic and survivors just running out instead of changing how end game works
---
Its defetinly legit.
---
Surprising how suspension of disbelieve gets harder when you get antsy teenagers involved.
---
I agree with that I hate having to leave then search for another game
---
The hiding behind a gen only works on certain angles.. and it's hard as hell to determine what 40 meters is.
---
Nea and Feng mains be like (Neon pink and blue cosmetic noises)
---
How did you do this?
---
Most killers' first instinct when hatch is available for last survivor after end game was introduced is to rush to find the hatch and close it. So the best action to take as survivor if you haven't already found the hatch, is hide yourself very well near an exit gate and play the waiting game. Killer has to make the call, assume that you're going straight for gates and go search for you near gates with risk of you escaping through hatch, or hastily deny you hatch by finding and closing it, then it comes down to 50/50 if killer can guess right which gate you're hiding at.
---
32, 115
---
Duh. Cheetas have that pattern to camoflague themselves while hunting!
---
The lawsuit was done and over with though... no?
---
Virgin Tryhard V.S. Chad Fashionista
---
Yeah but you can't get rid of that red mark, your solution would still be preferable to the the stock outfit though.
---
thanks! Glad to know he isn't a slow poke.
---
As a Freddy main I'm loving the new update. With max remember me and survivors in the dream state it takes almost the entire endgame for them to just open a gate. I was always a Remember Me/NOED/Blood Warden guy so the late-game was where I did most of my work, this just makes the work so much quicker.
---
Nah, but it's fun. And im just feeling it.
---
Mhm
---
You don't see yourself 99% of the time yet you probably care how you look.
---
Same reason here.
---
Finally I dont have to hear anymore killermains cry about tbagging from survivors...
---
Kinda glad tbh, I found it annoying and lore breaking. No hate to anyone that liked it tho.
---
The obsession changes when they use decisive strike
---
because.
---
d a r n
---
🤣
---
Legion is better now than he was before.
---
I'm a Spirit/Pig main but gave up on Pig for the most part at red ranks.
---
the only way to change obsession is by getting DSed
---
That's his prestige weapon.
---
she's just shy
---
Long man
---
They look great! Especially the last close-up frame.
---
I think the best possible move a killer can make in the hatch situation is wait at hatch without closing it, force survivor to do gens and trigger end game on him/herself, close hatch and go check gates. This will allow the killer more time to get to exit gates because survivor would still be at the last finished gen when end game begins.
---
Bro don’t you have exams
---
do you know what the commands are? Like what ones work? Where do i find them?
---
Yeah I fucking am deadass serious this buff was a mistake and increasing mending times was a strat and a really fucking good one
---
Clearly not
---
Oh didint even notice before he was on hook lol.
---
Well cant change title but it should be titled this then:  
---
"Why the F does a new survivor not automaticly get assigned as the new obsession when the first one DC's"
---
THEY LOSE ALL THEIR POWER WHEN IN FRENZY AND 50% WHEN NOT IN FRENZY
---
Fun fact, this is exactly WHY I like the design :P
---
\*Teleports behind you
---
OMG SHE'S SO CUTE. But still want bunny feng.
---
This is actually funny
---
Tbag strength 
---
Ghost &gt; Survivor &gt; Amanda
---
You..do realize that the host of the match has a huge effect on how the game preforms, right? The lag isn't consistent enough for it to be me, especially since every other online game and function works pretty much flawlessly.
---
Many killers just run BBQ for the double BP, but yes, the effect is quite good. Lockers are one option, or getting just within its radius (32m I believe)
---
It looks like l4d2 vs mode from what I've seen
---
When a survivor gets down instantly run towards them.  Chances are you’ll miss getting BBQd and have a better chance to get the save, if you’re on a gen hop in a locker.
---
Plays like a scared claudette. And whoever doing the gens sucks at skill checks lmaoo
---
Am I the only one who thinks legion was never supposed to be a ghostface rip off? I mean they’re both teenagers and both have knives but their themes are different and their backstories are different.
---
Link's ded, Dave!
---
I never do my first try. Usually after 5-7 tries I finally escape lol. The RNG is so stupid.
---
Oh my god that face peeking around a corner is hilarious
---
Part of me hopes the survivor side for that mori has it going to the cell phones camera for the end then just screams face while he texts and then the end screen.
---
Learn how to communictae on hook.
---
Or run kindred.
---
Do you know... the Myers man?
---
Holy shit.
---
he looks so handsome.
---
Increased mending time with double blades was an exploit, a bannable one at that :) Personally, i think Legion needs a complete overhaul on how their power works.
---
dude should be about to punch killers
---
drew it myself, took about 4-5 hours
---
Peak around corners and crouch to stalk survivors and give the stalked individual “Exposed”
---
I WANT THE ABILITY TO STAY IN A LOBBY WITH A SWF TEAM AFTER EVERY GAME INSTEAD OF HAVING TO REINVITE! LIKE IS IT REALLY THAT HARD
---
So he has infinite amount of stalking compared to Myer's interesting.
---
True true
---
Nurse and Wraith are the first that come to mind.
---
Mathieu is a very handsome man.
---
Your internet is shite pal
---
meanwhile, we're now dealing with Mettle of Man, combined with Dead Hard and Adrenaline. but I've been working on it, and I think I've found the only viable counterplay to it: tunneling. survivors will not like it when more start realizing this, methinks.
---
\#Relatable
---
\*sighs\*  
---
Another complete dolt.   
---
You DO know that there's no universal communication on hook that everyone understands, right? Sure, there's a general consensus to signal a camper, that has ZERO guarantee your team will follow it, and you can't give ANY signaling when you're in the struggle phase.   
---
As for Kindred, it doesn't magically create a window of opportunity for a save. The camping LF *will* get his sacrifice no matter what, and it's fucking ridiculous.
---
No issue on my end, was at killer shack near exit gate, once killer found me I sprint burst my way out. Works as per normal, maybe bugged.
---
It's very nice
---
Well,
---
Victor Miller won the court case. BUT, Sean Cunningham filed an appeal to the court's decision, meaning it's going to take even longer for an official decision. It will take years for things to get settled.
---
Don't taze me, bro !
---
To be fair that clown looks like he is camping during the Endgame Collapse, which means the game is over and he is securing a kill. 
---
You can't get mad at that lol. What else is he supposed to do?
---
No u
---
Always the clauds oof
---
thanks :)
---
I tried to Killa Claudette because I didn't like her outfit, lol.  Even brought a mori
---
You’re joking right? 😂 he’s not able to keep as much pressure now, you must be playing lower ranks
---
I'm not as mad at that one. Just sucks it happened twice in a row. I feel like I always get camped. No matter how far the round is.
---
Terror radius is just the minecraft gameplay music but it gets louder and more distorted the closer you get
---
I fear pushing people to do totems by adding a counter is going to kill devour hope
---
What would you suggest he does instead? Breaks chase so that he can get looped by the next guy, when he already has the single injured survivor in his sights? Is that actually what you want to argue?
---
1 and 2, sure that might be asking a lot of randoms. 3 was the least they could have done considering your efforts, imo.
---
This actually makes sense.
---
I immediately think of Left 4 Dead 2 looking at this.
---
I just had a random Ace grab me off the hook in front of the killer with no borrow time.....but that's not what pissed me off.  After the unhook I get downed. He could had taken a hit for me but instead decides to teabag the killer in front of me when the killer is picking me up HOLDING A GOD DAMN FLASHLIGHT.  I'm not asking for top tier plays but at least attempt to be helpful.  Sorry, I had to rant.
---
I wouldn’t. Because now I can imagine it’s Shawnee Smith under there
---
I miss him, he’s never on stream anymore.
---
I’ll say it from my survivor-flaired account then. 
---
Then don’t. Simple.
---
Now survivor mains have a go-to killer.
---
Play killer then ? Show people how your meant to play killer !
---
i mean if 3/4 of the team dies its pretty deserved he getsthe last kill, specially trapper
---
They wont change the face to much, and since thats from Scary Movie, they would probably have to get rights for it, also stop reporting days old memes that are not funny
---
Didn't know Junko Enoshima was the Entity /s
---
I can't remember when it was added but that quote wasn't always there. Has been for a while at this point though. Some other Perks had flavour text added to them but I don't remember all of them but I believe Hope was one of them.
---
It's 832 mb for me lol on pc
---
I like how Ghostface wipes off his knife. Very accurate to the movie! I can’t wait to play him. Gonna be a main the minute he comes out.
---
I won’t even argue, with time you’ll stop using NOED and get better.
---
The chances of us getting a paragraph are slim. We're getting a chapter in around 5 weeks, and Ghostface will likely take another two to finalise, at least.
---
Also, why would they bring out two paragraphs between chapters? Surely it'd be wiser to save a Ghostface paragraph for the mid-chapter content draught.
---
Would you rather it have a Nokia?
---
Can't really say that I do. I don't go and buy expensive clothing for myself. Just plain jeans and t-shirt for me. Pretty standard just like the default monster skins.
---
Ouch
---
Ghostface isn't iconic enough to be a DbD killer...But then by that calculus neither was Amanda, I guess. Obvious picks are obvious. I'm sure Crowley from Hatchet is coming up soon. lmao

Hey man, slivers can really fuck you up
---
insert mandatory wazzap
---
&gt; ,plus she save the girls
---
Saves them only for them to starve and die in her cottage instead.
---
Rank 2. I definitely think he's better now.
---
Thanks for posting this, looks exciting. Also, goatmom is best wife.
---
The devs confirmed in a comment on Paulie Esther’s video months back that they originally wanted to get Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg’s character) but for whatever reason it didn’t work out.
---
I run We'll Make It most of the time so I usually like to heal right after unhook.  The time it takes to run to a hiding place I could had already heal you.  Of course only do this if the killer is far or busy.
---
there are a bunch of ways to counter it
---
1) go into a locker
---
2) get within proximity of the killer
---
3) run in one direction for the duration of the effect, then turn around and run in the other one so he/she thinks you'll still be going one way
---
He didn’t want you to disarm his trap so he sent his spirit to stomp on your hand lol. Jk jk xD I would have probably crapped myself tbh.
---
his sounds dont sound like the leaked sounds from last week though...makes me wonder if the pinhead predictions might be correct as well as far as the leaked sounds belonging to another killer to come out later after ghost face perhaps?
---
Damn OP just got rekt
---
This was play as killer.
---
And several perks. And faking a direction. And being good at chases so you don’t care about being seen
---
Honestly the main reason BBQ is so popular is that it heavily reduces the bloodpoint grind for killers, like having bloodhunt but constantly
---
Rank 1. He’s definitely weaker
---
The auric one is wooden omegalul
---
You just had to go and mention him :|
---
IN CASE YOU DIDN’T KNOW YOU GET GEN RUSHED DURING THE WHOLE CHASE FIGHTING THE CRUTHC CANCER. BY THE TIME YOU HOOKSOMEONE THERE WILL PROBABLY BE 2 GENS LEFT. THEN THE BORROWED TIME COMES AND THEN ADRENALINE.
---
I'm the asshole altruistic survivor who has to save his fellow survivors instead of being selfish and escaping? 
---
The scenario that continues to happen is gens are completed, another survivor gets or is hooked, while they are hooked I go for the gate, killer comes to the gate, I run for the unhook, we both go to a gate, killer comes to the gate, queue circus music as we both battle to open one of the gates as the killer closes the hatch 100% of the time, one of us goes down anyway, the other gets killed by the entity as they are opening the gate.
---
Punished for trying to leave no man behind.
---
Thanks found a alternate fix before this, since charportraits can't be deleted I moved the dbd folder somewhere else and renamed it so it had to make a completely new folder thank you for the response though
---
Ptb?
---
Ghostface not iconic? dude...
---
My girl is watching me that time, tbh I will scream if shes not around LMFAO
---
Noed into ghostface tbag is my favorite.
---
OP, it only applies when you are in an injured state. If you are full hp, you will go down as it skips the injuried state
---
I can’t even fathom being so bad at a video game
---
I don’t know I might be wrong but the fact that a map or survivor hasn’t been found is making me have doubts
---
Because they want to ruin the game play for everyone else..
---
It would’ve cost you exactly 0 bloodpoints to not say that yet you did
---
*and I’m glad you did*
---
Tunneling usually happens when they camp tho right?
---
Power: When hooking a survivor present them with a contract. If the contract is not fufilled then they advanced an extra stage on hook next time then are hooked. 
---
Perk 1: Can not be stunned when blue. Lose blue when you get stunned. Return Blue on survivor kill
---
Perk 2: entering the area of a hex toten traps you inside the area for a while.
---
Perk 3:If hooked twice your soul is flayed, preventing you from doing coop actions for a while
---
Honestly, my issue is that people are acting like theory is fact in the subreddit right now. I know you aren't, but the amount of people who act like we're definitely getting a full chapter and the people who act like we definitely aren't need to chill.
---
I’ve deadass messages kids and asked them why they camp and they respond saying things like this. “To make survivors mad and rage message me” like dude how sad of a life do u live lmfao
---
The mask prestige is that, doesn't have enough blood IMO
---
Nokia is OP, so no.
---
Is it just me or does Myers look a bit like Hank Hill?
---
I don’t camp. And if I’m checking mearby generators and someone gets the rescue I come back to the hook. If I see only the injured just unhooked survivor, and the unhooker doesn’t have borrowed time or doesn’t take a hit, why shouldn’t I go after the unhooked guy again? If you don’t want me to “tunnel” as you call it then body block your teammates. If you unhook and go away don’t cry:)
---
Because gens dont give you shit for points..  you gotta open an exit door or do hex totems to gain a bunch of points.
---
Tapp is the most iconic Saw survivor. He wasn't given up in that first movie.
---
that would be funny, for the past few months i have become a survivor main but this might get me back into killing for a while..seems like he could be a lot of fun :) for instance survivors are in the gate waiting to taunt and instead of the doing the killer tapping to the side and back you could just turn on GF no TR power and peak around the corner :) lots of Meme potential for sure :)
---
I already noticed that the "Repairs" score (1250 points / full gen) don't count / appear. That's probably why.

Now I see how blind and stupid this community can be.
---
Goddamnit Bobby get in here and hold your little brother
---
That depends on the literal killer and the person playing killer. 
---
Some people camp in order to pick off overly altruistic survivors.
---
It’s been live for a few weeks as far as I know lol
---
Make a reverse meme with Endgame stuff signifying you have worked out how to play them when you do uwu
---
Another mouth breather &lt;3
---
Clever girl!

I guess you can stab someone with a pencil if you put enough strength into it, haha.
---
Hellooooooo, Sydney......
---
I think its just horribly unfinsihed in this gameplay
---
Cool - no bunny feng that everyone wants.  $12 outfits. too much - no thanks.
---
Ghost Stealth turns off the Stain and Terror Radius.
---
It's just what you do when you're incapable of getting kills any other way.
---
they'll justify it with 'uhh well achkkktually it's the killers job soooo'  
---
yet are the first to complain when they go vs a SWF team.
---
The hatch wouldn’t be open if more than 1 survivor is alive.
---
It's not about being bad or good, it's about pissing people off, it's literally the only reason they do it.
---
Am a survivor main, but from my experience, the killers I usually see camp aren’t the greatest at the game, so I would imagine that has something to do with it
---
they might tunnel because you literally ran into them or the unhooked got the F out instead of taking the aggro
---
A full gen with no skill checks gives you around 1200K BP. I should have got at least 4K BP.
---
Myers has minimal amount of blood on his mask too.
---
I think it's a balance thing, they are both stealthy killers that need to stalk you for a bit without letting you know they are there, the bright af mask is supposed to reward the survivors that are paying attention to their surroundings.
---
Great meme, I approve
---
What's his power?
---
Close windows and loops with dirt blocks?
---
Fair enough, I haven't been able to test using the two together so I just assumed MoM would activate because you're technically in the Injured state.
---
The order of events shalt be rearranged!
---
Is it a crutch perk? Hell yes, but not for aura reading. I’d love to replace BBQ if it wasn’t for the endless BP grind.
---
He made one step. it'd be still in range even with 0 latency
---
Is this confirmed even on low or is it still the ultra settings thing?
---
I M A G I N E thinking you’re special for being the six thousandth negative Nancy that thinks the cosmetic team has anything to do with bug fixes and matchmaking and going to make yourself a special little entitled video about it. You know they need to make money to stay alive and pay people to do the stuff you want them to right???? The team is the most communicative team of a game I’ve played- that is trying its hardest all the damn time to give everyone a slice of what they want. I was so proud when they became independent, but I still know they don’t have the resources to just find and fix everything or adjust everything in a snap of the fingers. That’s why we make CONSTRUCTIVE and RESPECTFUL posts about our grievances. Do yourself a favor and ditch the “main” mentality. I get it, somebody who plays more of the side that you don’t said something you didn’t like. It still drives down the community, as if we need more ‘communities’ like the Blizzard forums.
---
lmao
---
For playing the game as a killer and get matchmaked with 3 survivors and 2 Killers ? Lmao dude
---
It has, but not mutch.
---
I want the Mori to be apart of the base kit, changes Obsession randomly and it's just you're next.
---
"None of which will work for camping leatherface. Even MoM only works for a second, wheres his chainsaw lasts for a few seconds and will still down the rescuer if he's in the vicinity. Good try though." It's funny how do you ignore flashlight saves, borrowed time, insta heals and other second chances which can counter lf facecamp.
---
"Lmao. That's a "just because" fallacy right there, declaring yourself winner because you feel like it. The point I made was that most people who pull this kind of shit don't care about BP or Rank, and are just vindictive shit. It's not my fault that went over your head." "I don't care about BP or rank, I just want to ruin others day" 
---
 
---
"Not very well, you didn't. Please do us a favor, record yourself using one of those abilities to outplay a face camping LF and post it here. We'll wait. Oh wait, that's right, you don't play for the rescue, because you said earlier that the remaining survivors should just leave the last person to die, something you'd only say if you knew there was no counter-play to this."
---
https://youtu.be/tkl_0_zIUXc not a fan of ochido but it's a nice example.
---
 https://youtu.be/JPrjEBVe-Vk another one
---
https://youtu.be/ulD8DgueRB8 and another one.
---
Nothing more to say here. I think that it's obvious it is possible to rescue from camping LF if you use  brain a bit.
---
Same
---
I'd say that in this case, the survivors were rewarding the killer for bad play by allowing him a 4k. It's up to the other team to punish the former for mistakes in this game. All around dumb decisions by amlost everyone in that game.
---
Who would be Bobby? Maybe legion?
---
Really good!, how do you manage it to do prestige 3 in game?
---
I think I see a little bit near his left eye. He needs a lot more though this wont do as is. I'm betting its subject to change.
---
If this is true I hate it. Hiding the red stain is what made good killers different from the bad ones. This just removes any counterplay from the survivors.
---
I sadly had to use a method I really didn't want to, but it worked out and I was able to speed through the grind of the bloodwebs and have infinite points. ~~
---
You are the scum that makes this community seen as a bad and toxic one. Please uninstall the game and go to another community.

This pack contains every perk, item, add-on, action, offering, killer power and status effect in the game in gold, rather than the default white. These perks DO NOT contain backgrounds, it is completely up to you how you want to use them.

Ah, but what was Laurie? A 17-18 year old high schooler.
---
Give Susie another year or two and she'll become unstoppable.

Well Legion sorta got nerfed pretty hard recently. Basically The Legions power is a free hit but you have to make sure that you land it because if you miss you get stunned and lose your power. The Deep Wound mechanic they had is kinda sucky now so truly Stabbing the same survivor multiple times won’t make it go down at all and they will only go down if they choose not to mend. You’re best bet is to chain hit as many survivors as you can without missing and then running up close to one survivor and wait out the rest of your power or cancel it close to them so you can finish the chase and hit them with a basic attack. There are some Add-ons that make it so your stun is reduced so that will most likely be your best Add-ons. I don’t consider them to suck but the power is a bit underwhelming you just need to master them. Fuck Pallets and windows :D

When I get Ghostface the first thing I'll dois having a tea bag party with survivors

That is the part that sucks ass! Where you solo survivor or swf?

Yes, but my point is that every time I de-pip I get more games like the one above, which usually ends in another de-pip because my teammates are useless.

Scream was the highest grossing slasher film ever up until Halloween (2018) beat it. To say he isn't iconic enough is crazy.
---
What makes me so happy about this is that it seems to be almost completely separate from Myers and pig (unlike billy and cannibal) He looks kinda low tier but at the same time he seems to play extremely fun
---
Yes! Now I can mindgame even better!
---
No problem, I hope you enjoy them. Thanks for waiting so long :)
---
I think it's more that he couldn't be mithered with it all anyway, know what I mean?
---
I wouldnt say no
---
Don't worry, I'm just nitpicking as always x3
---
sorry I don't, but it's not possible anymore. I believe it was only possible on the dev build that was accidentally pushed out for a short time when ghost face was leaked.
---
Norman Bates as a killer would be amazing been hoping we would get him someday/
---
You can actually see David's arm through the bed of the truck as the billy turns around. Little easter egg from the video no one else commented on yet.

This is so cute

Teens are the basis of almost every slasher movie
---
Oh god oh fuck [YOU BETTER STOP](https://youtu.be/Wp0WDmGMlvA)
---
Everyone needs to stop DC'ing but...what the hell was that guy doing? Sure, jungle gyms can be tough but either force the play or abandon the chase what the hell was that?
---
Yeah I don't think nothing will happen though
---
Honest question why is he blue
---
That's crazy how wearing certain outfits will have an effect on other players.
---
For me, I guess I'll wear what looks good and also try my best at escaping with the rest of the team
---
it changes depending on distance, if youre near someone they can madness faster than if theyre on the edge of your TR
---
I'm so glad someone finally said something! I've seen countless videos showing the last survivor attempting to escape when they have almost no chance. After the hatch is closed the killer just stands between both doors and guards them while the timer ticks down. I dont get it. Am I missing something? Because it seems like there isnt much of an endgame plan for escaping if you're the last survivor. You might as well give up. 
---
It just seems like a huge advantage for the killer. Unless I'm missing some kind of survivor strategy here.
---
Bro if u don’t know when to break a chase and when to continue a chase then you need to really get better as a killer. Also facecamping in this situation is a shitty thing to do no matter what the situation, however if he proxy camped n began to play around that letting the hooked survivor be sort center point then he may have got a pass. This killer was ass and no matter what you say you can’t change my mind on how he played being good or justifiable.
---
I LOVE IT
---
LOL what is this?!
---
Roflmao. Ty.
---
They desperately need to remove his terror radius while crouching. A stealth killer that tells you when he's nearby is horrible.
---
She wasnt hit at all tbh. Saving traps for endgame isn't viable anymore but that was just a cheesy playstyle anyways.
---
He's just Northern. All bluster, nothing to be afraid of.
---
What teacher?
---
I don't think that's a thing.
---
Dude remember those bleeding Scream masks?
---
Well, I can't speak for early game camping, but tunneling sometimes happens to deprive Survivors of their Emblems, at least when it comes to off hook tunneling. Because if you get hit within 10 seconds of being unhooked the person who unhooked you loses a huge amount of their benevolence Emblem. 
---
There's one other reason--like it or not, there's some tactical soundness to removing a Survivor from the game as soon as possible. When a Survivor is Sacrificed very early on, that reduces Survivors' manpower and allows the Killer easier prioritization, pressure, and buys a serious amount of time. The game is already slowed by 25% if a Survivor is done for as quickly as possible. I can spread damage and pressure more effectively on 3 Survivors than 4, if you catch my drift. So focus the weak link early on and get them down.
---
You're fine, I like to be corrected if I'm wrong and being corrected calmly and clearly like that is way better than someone saying, "wrong lol ur the dum"
---
As for getting DS'ed after she *finally* gets him down, it sounds about right. XD
---
Ghostface has a cosmetic that turns his entire mask red so I don't think this is the answer
---
Just bought the game today??
---
Oh. Oh deary. You are in for one hell of a ride.
---
Open-Handed and Spine Chill
---
Don't worry.
---
You'll get sick of it in less than a week.
---
She’s an endgame killer, much like Freddy. Her bear traps were most effective if used in the endgame to stop people from leaving. I don’t agree with it in the slightest, she’s the most average killer next to the trapper. Then again, Behavior seems to be nerfing the shitty killers anyways, don’t see why people are surprised.
---
Solo
---
Can anyone tell me why Meyers looks like Hank Hill? Damnit bobby.
---
Peanits corrected the stat to 43%, because it wasn't counting any Rank 1 survivors who depipped (Like by dying) during the game. The survival rate was 43% on PC for Rank 1 in the first week of April
---
Holy shit that looks cool
---
Fuck off it’s all about shirtless Myers
---
I would’ve assumed you could hit survivors multiple times or when you attack normally you don’t lose your feral frenzy
---
looks fake to me.
---
Object of Obsession
---
I assume the crouch is a toggle with ctrl, just like Survivor.
---
Why Open Handed?
---
I dont think spine chill is a bad perk but I just dont get used to it
---
Aye, first hit, then bt hit, 3rd hit to down him into DS, Adrenaline to full hp, hit, hit into borrowed time, hit into syringe tech to full hp.
---
F u n t i m e s
---
Find a survivor. Activate power, hit them. Look around for the killer instinct notifications, chase each survivor, hit and repeat for all four. If you're lucky to catch someone in a locker  with your power active (legions power shows locker hiders) you won't suffer the stun. With everyone in mend state, they're not fixing gens. After you hit your final survivor, just take your 4 second stun and chase them down like normal. Even if they escape they STILL have to mend and will cry during, making it easier to find them. You have 10 seconds of power to make the hit happen, so don't panic and wait for 360 survivors to stop spinning so you miss less. The point is to make sure the survivors are mending/healing and not doing gens as much as possible while you're chasing a target.
---
distraction or head on
---
"greater/better than"
---
Hit, then BT hit, then downing them into DS, then adrenaline to full hp, hit, hit into Mettle of men, hit into syringe tech.

Why the fuck are you acting so surprised that taunting someone gets you facecamped?

Holy crap someone actually made a survivor’s rulebook for killers
---
A few people have told me lightweight is shit, but I never run Dwight without it. I don't know if everyone thinks it's shit though

---
"Officer Holt was one of the good guys..."
---
Should add it is impolite to hit and/or hook a survivor. Stand in the corner so they don't have to worry.
---
My profile is now private. I bought the game in January of this year. There are some shitheads in this community
---
I see corn stalks in my nightmares.
---
Yeah, that does suck. I had a match recently against a nurse with Insidious,  bloodwarden, NOED and tinkerer. She had stacked range add-ons. 3 solo survivors and myself get to egc. She opens a gate, insidious camps it, I get hooked by the gate and the 3 other solid survivors preceded to get downed and hooked 1 by 1 trying to save me. It was extremely frustrating after I won 3 chases against her, I get 1 hooked and the 3 others sacrificed cause of toxic perks.

---
I just got my first head on save yesterday and it was right in front of a open exit gate 😂
---
god I love this
---
I think the knowledge perks such as Alert are nutty. Always knowing where the killer is allows you to push hard at gens and get safe rescues. I don’t use em often as I enjoy looping the killer; but they are so consistently good!
---
Did you read the first paragraph of my post.........?
---
Just because it's 'only 2 minutes' doesn't make it any less lame to PURPOSELY make someone sit there unable to do anything.
---
You're using a logic fallacy that because it's not AS bad as what Survivors did prior, it therefore isn't an issue. That is ignorant thinking.
---
It's also super hypocritical to complain about not wanting to go to gate and hit survivors out and endure 5 seconds of tbags because you don't want the tbags and then sit for 2 min forcing a survivor to watch you nod your head at them.
---
well... jason is known for his mother to, I would say that whenever jason is the killer, fragments of the mother's tomb will appear randomly on the map, if the survivor is near them, jason will be able to see them for a few seconds and allow him to easily spot survivors, it is true that this ability is near useless on chases, but gives him tons of map control if the fragments lands on the proper places  
---
Silly concept but hey is as much as I can think of jason, I still want to see Chucky in this game
---
There's so much passion and enthusiasm coming from players enjoying the game that negativity doesn't stand a chance!
---
Slugging isn't very effective against immersed survivors, they can usually hide long enough for slugs to recover to 95%. Still effective, but entirely situational.
---
I'm not gonna lie lol him peeking around corners freaks me out
---
Oh boy I'm already quaking with anticipation!
---
Honestly the Leatherface made some seriously stupid mistakes, like ever being around Wretched Shop, and not going to pressure other Survivors.  He lost the game to that chase, but he knew that Bubba's Chainsaw is absolute at securing the kill.
---
All in all, I don't blame the guy.  It sucks to get camped, but honestly after that I'd just be happy if everybody else got out, and if anyone else went down that's on them for disrespecting Bubba when he's in his element.
---
Many people say so 
---
But I'm not sure about it 
---
I think it's very situational
---
I don't think it will. Most are trolling, not just looking for an animation.
---
Shame, you would've seen how much fun it is :)
---
I tried to get my girlfriend into the game and her first killer match, at rank 20, with no perks was against 2 koreans one of which had 2000+ hours the other had 1400.  
---
Then after the match they spammed   
---
ez ez ez ez ez ez ez ez   
---
She instantly tapped out and didn't want to play again. Luckily I could still get the refund!
---
This needs to be like an April Fool's joke. Take Myers abilities and give them to Herobrine. Same abilities and all, just a character added once per year. And his music is replaced with the Minecraft music.
---
Imma gonna have to disagree with you here

I think the pillow has been around for about 3 weeks?
---
I really like Lightweight.
---
Bill would kick their ass for sure. The dude served in Vietnam and fought off hordes of zombies.
---
Have it like the comics one or the Mortal Kombat version where its a lot more humanoid as the head and tail are a lot shorter then the film versions.
---
So how do you go about doing these? As in, how does the model get transformed from the potato graphics in dbd to the crispness here?
---
I think that's probably a part of her now which is so fucking cool
---
&gt; Why the name calling
---
Pot calling the kettle black.
---
Don’t listen to anyone who complains about camping when you know you weren’t. There’s no reason to alter your play there unless you want to be a “nice killer”. Even then you were trying to be one and got called a camper. Who cares. Ignore him and keeping doing you. Play the game how you want brother
---
There is no question here...
---
I don’t think the Entity can bring in a killer more powerful than itself. It has to be able to control the killers
---
Yep, I had to make my steam profile private too. People would just leave shitty comments.
---
Does the lawsuit need to be resolved for Jason to come to Dead by Daylight? Or is the lawsuit over who owns the IP of Jason?
---
Head on apply directly to the forehead!
---
Beat me to it.
---
It’s very regular. My steam &amp; ps4 profiles are private because of this kind of thing.
---
Felt the question was obvious if what I was describing was camping or not...
---
Go go Power Ranger
---
There's no reason to create a larger divide between players with comments like this.
---
A while back I saw an interesting take on the Predator. Have someone who is obsessed with the Predator and possessed by the Entity make a costume like his and use it whilst killing.
---
Just disable the chat. For some reason at the lower ranks people are just super toxic.
---
WHEN YOU REGRET NOT GOING EASIER ON THE SURVIVORS BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU DIDN'T PIP UP, THAT MEANS THE RANKING SYSTEM IS FUCKING GARBAGE.
---
FUCK, YOU CAN'T JUST END CHASES QUICKLY, BECAUSE THEN YOU GET PUNISHED.
---
The survivors? As like threats? “You’re next” type of deals
---
Mind sharing at r/PerkByDaylight ?
---
oh really, cant believe the sub didnt go crazy over that
---
i was going to say smth about that pointless second blink and the whiff but suddenly, console
---
4 gens up, in the middle of the map hiding. Worthless...
---
You broke one of their made up rules and hurt their precious feelings. Pay them no mind.
---
Thanks, I try to be a chill killer and only go after someone I've already hooked if they literally run right into me.
---
I’ve had similar experiences with trying to introduce new players to the game. Now I just play alone.
---
"If you dont wanna get camped just lose the killer". Gee thanks that really stopped him from following my scratch marks and face camping.
---
It's a good stealth perk. I would run it on my blue haired Nea, and killers still couldn't find me.
---
Thanks, I'm just cautious about being a dick killer, lol.
---
Yeah, having the issue right now..and a few of my friends also
---
Yikes 😂 I was being chased, wasn’t sure where he was
---
That’s not bunny feng
---
I feel like the Endgame Collapse sort of forces killers to slug now, since even if zero generators have even been touched the last survivor can still hop down the hatch for free.  This leads to more selfish and immersed survivors, which necessitates more slugging if the killer wants to secure a 4k unless they want to bet the round on a coin toss.
---
I'm liking the subtleness of blood on his mask but yeah you can barely tell the difference between non-P3 and P3. Needs a tiny bit more.
---
Both also share the concept of actually being multiple people instead of just one person doing all the killing.
---
I was expecting him to run back, being on console had nothing to do with it.
---
you're very triggered because i told you immersed is a bad playstyle. stay angry mate I'm still right
---
Ah yes, looping the killer, the perfect crime.
---
I thought he was just naming the selfie and saving it on his phone
---
^^^^
---
It's just you.
---
Map RNG is just total garbage. Some maps will be loaded with hooks, pallets, windows, or jungle gyms, others seem to have forgotten to spawn in entirely.
---
You're very likely to be screwed by map RNG in some way more than anything else.
---
Just make gens take longer, like 5-10 seconds.  Then killers would have more time to dick around and don’t need to be anal.
---
Well, survivors will complain every game they lose, same with killers, just ignore them.
---
I’m pretty sure that the terror radius and stain are hidden in stealth unless a survivor sees you, then they come back, or the power could be unfinished
---
I find Devour Hope can be like this too. Once I have 3 tokens, it's usually too late for at least some of the survivors.
---
So regarding pigs terror radius, I just double checked and it takes around 4 seconds for it to completely disappear and 4 seconds to fully reappear when uncrouching. So yeah, if it's coming back instantly its probably a bug.
---
As for yoinking people off gens as pig, dont expect to get alot of yoinks in a game. Survivors have a very wide cone of view that can give them 360 degrees of view and unlike prayer beads spirit, survivors can still see you while your crouched. Your better off just using your ambush in most situations cause assuming survivors are paying attention, they'll often see you before you get the chance. But if you really want to yoink people best tips I can give you are:
---
• start crouching early when going to a gen. If survivors hear your TR they'll most likely be on guard especially if they know its the pig. 
---
• try to keep a wall between you and the gen. This will prevent survivors from seeing you until your right on top of them. Start uncrouching as your rounding the corner. 
---
• not all gens are good for yoinking. As mentioned before, survivors can still see you, so a gen in the middle of nowhere that dosen't provide any cover will not be the best for you.
---
Google dead by daylight template and the first picture can help you
---
What? how did you come to the conclusion he was saying Ghostface isn't in the game?
---
boil over
---
**Leaked 1.8.0 patch notes**
---
- Legion can no longer m1 while in Feral Frenzy
---
- The Pig can no longer kill survivors with RBTs, just a light tickle as to not make them uncomfortable. 
---
- The Spirit can now see survivors and their scratch marks while Yamaoka's Haunting is active. 
---
- The Pig can also no longer dash while crouched. No one used this anyways, right guys? 
---
- Our data suggests that The Nurse was under-performing, so she no longer has cooldown in between blinks, and her lunge range in increased. 
---
- Removed Herobrine
---
oh nvm, Meg player = autism
---
Reinstall your operating system
---
Worse, Spiders.
---
Even though the nerfs break my heart, I would not be opposed to this. Just keep the *oink*
---
Amanda isn't the only Killer who possesses the t-bag gift now! 
---
PS: I wonder who'll be Ghostface... will it be Billy or Stu?
---
Not sure if that's how it works, I think activating his ability removes terror radius and red stain. If you notice his ability is on a timer, stalking a survivor for a certain duration will expose them. From what I've gathered it seems you're supposed to wait until your meter is full -&gt; try and sneak up and stalk someone without being seen -&gt; stalk them until exposed (doesn't take long from watching the video, around 2s it seems) -&gt; then chase. The balance here is that he has terror radius and red stain while his ability is on cool down, should be fine if the numbers are done well; how long until a survivor is exposed, how long until the meter is full, how long does the power last once activated. Should be interesting.
---
Wait they even smile? Holy fuck
---
Thanks fam really helps
---
Shit! I meant the cunt survivor who thought he could do hatch stand offs, internet explorer is slow thats why i called him that now i have -2 downvotes :(
---
It would have cost you exactly 0 dollars to not say that.
---
I have 1600 hours of playing both killer and survivor and in that time I've never facecamped or used decisive, excluding when I didn't use it properly while going for the achievement
---
it can be good on some maps and has saved me many times, its not useful all the time but when it works its great
---
It looks asian
---
BHVR after Ash leak: no more leaks (ง'̀-'́)ง

*a few weeks later*

---
I knew this would happen. It was just a matter of time.
---
Same here, I hope it'll get fixed.
---
Proof that there are killer mains who refuse to play unless they have some OP advantage. He instant DC'd because the Springwood offering won and we weren't sent to Lery's. 
---
I don't have a problem with Mirror Myers truly since it comes with some terrific jump-scares, but if you will ONLY play on THAT map and nowhere else, you're just a baby.
---
That boy ain't right.
---
Only thing I care about is don't be a dick and immediately rush back to the hook to tunnel the unhooked person.
---
Like I don't even care if you facecamp me at least I have the decision to suicide or stay to keep you entertained.
---
I just DC against pig's instantly since 90% of them just tunnel the cage until death. Rather face insidious tum tum.
---
Here’s to hoping we get someone 🤷‍♂️
---
If you play killer, expect this to happen at least twice a day. That's the Dbd experience :D
---
Holy fuck I jumped 2 feet high
---
i always dc on springwood, fuck that map
---

---
Friendly reminder: You can turn comments off for non-friends on Steam, instead of making your profile private.
---
You can use that, or not, it's your profile...
---
Oh moris are absolutely stronger than keys, I just grouped them up under ‘things that probably shouldn’t be thing’
---
Good points though, I’ve had only one key escape . Being moried on the other hand..
---
Springwood is actually one of the better maps for Jumpscare Myers too.
---
Thanks for the reply, at least it’s not just me, I’ve gone to a different game now.
---
I’m willing to play on it. It’s Haddonfield that I always nope the fuck out of.
---
Just checked out the profile, duly noted lol.
---
Also the killer doesn't get stunned when MoM is set off. It's barely a problem really.
---
The joke is that you can't stalk through corn for some reason. I think if you can't stalk you shouldn't be able to be flashlight blinded.
---
I didn't used to like it, but it has grown on me a bit.
---
absolute LEGEND buggy master best survivor I’ve ever played with 100% should be rank 1
---
A real tunneling wraith wouldn't even allow BT. Always run soot and decloak as they unhook, there won't be BT.
---
Using save the best for last is also a counter to mettle of man.
---
OP is obviously an entitled killer main who thinks that the game should be balanced around killers.
---
I'm on console too.
---
On which console do u play?
---
Did you also test the grunts/stun sounds of the killer?
---
Bet the art teacher needed clarification 😂
---
The entity is VERY displeased
---
Genrushing doesn't exist, and yes, Looping IS stupid
---
Yeah. I can imagine it worked pretty well on lerys
---
that's how the mask is shaped in game..?
---
I see you.
---
SERIOUS
---
Well on PS4 at least, most survivprs are stupid as hell.
---
Unless i'm killer. Then, they all may as well be Navy SEALS
---
Yes because I know people will say “git good”
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lightburn](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lightburn)  :D
---
Yes. YES.
---
If you mean the selfie its part of the mori, but the camera angles are my own
---
Or just because the killer saw you move. Keep the 3 crow halo or die
---
Nah
---
Pure Smugface
---
Killers Using Moris Tier List, lol what a niche video.
---
Yeah his vaulting speed is so slugginsh, the look of the animation reminds me of the selfcare bug from a while ago.
---
I feel like that + a 3 second stun + not requiring the full power charge (so that you can use it in a quick burst to gain distance/vault a good window) would make him much better.
---
&gt;Not being instantly negative about a genuine harmless question is always a good idea...
---
I am teaching you how to be a smarter person in the future and avoid useless questions like this, how is that negative?
---
A big chunk of players cant handle losing, this will happen almost every time you play
---
Already have :)
---
thanks, i already made it clear in comments that i am not that source, so thanks for supplying the sources :) this is something i found on twitter and wanted to share with others it was funny imo.
---
Excuse me for stupid question, but how is it possible to play as him? Did you modify some game files or what?
---
This has been asked since the games launch.
---
Apparently it's a tech limitation and it wont happen.
---
and killers can't pip if at least one survivor DCs
---
Why are people talking about disabling chat and turning off steam comments? Haven't you seen OP's screenshot?
---
For god knows what reason, he accepted a random friend invite on steam after a DBD match. This is steam chat.
---
It's an obsession perk, dipshit. Another survivor main who never plays killer and doesn't know wtf he's talking about.
---
Toxic and bad killer tbh. A good killer would've broken the chase off if he felt he wasn't going to catch you. Get some map pressure in and maybe smack some other people. I definitely fall prey to chasing the same person and wasting time...but I don't face camp them if I do manage to grab them a comfy seat on the hook.
---
Stack it up on other survivors and use your stacks when you find your obsession, it’s called general common sense 
---
Dipshit ;)
---
So that I play on ps4 and hatchets work for mettle of man. I get my stacks for mettle of man with hatchets.. so maybe you should test it out. But I just played a match last night and it activated from hatchets hitting me...
---
You're right, sorry about that. I was wanting to make it obvious for any newcomers to custom perks. Thanks for the feedback. :)
---
You forgot to mention the End Game Collapse, Decisive Strike change, BBQ in the Shrine, and Dedicated Servers coming soon! This is definitely DBD's year.
---
Not a good enough player to rock LOOK-THE-FUCK-AT-ME skins.
---
I thought they did to but under the store it’s not actually labeled as a chapter
---
Crouch is like with the Pig - by default it's "Ctrl"
---
Leaning - you get an arrow pointing you the direction which you will be peeking in and you press a button and GF peeks out.
---
Right and they are making so nurse blink hits count also.. sooo??
---
and killer can't pip if at least one of the survivors disconnect, even if he kills everyone else
---
We're gonna live forever.
---
I mean gotta have money to come out with new stuff! Do you not enjoy new dlcs? Them fixing things? It all cost money
---
The power was recharging even when he wasn't stalking, might just be a static cooldown like Frenzy.
---
Stalking in his sneaky power does build up the exposed status, yeah.
---
Sorry for asking, but how did they get access to the Dev build? It seems like we just keep finding new stuff every hour and i'm outta the loop
---
Jason Voorhees as a character is up in the air in terms of who owns it. The idea is that Victor Miller wrote the script for the original Friday movie in 1980, but was paid a flat rate. Sean, the director, took reigns of the franchise and took it with him for a long time. Victor Miller wants to claim additional money for writing the script. The court sided with Miller, but Cunningham filed an appeal. 
---
It's A LOT more complicated than that though. The actor who played Shelly in Friday Part 3, Larry Zerner, is a copyright lawyer and is a close follower of the case. He knows the most about what's happening.
---
The developer build was leaked. That's where all the leaks originate from.
---
You're the one getting downvoted mate. People are siding with me, I don't play immersed, I play efficiently and sometimes the smart play is to not run out in front of the killer and get his attention if you can finish a gen. The fact that you even use the word triggered unironically is pretty telling that you spend too much time arguing online. Also people can play the game however they want, it's a video game after all, take it a little less seriously please and lighten up.
---
thats not how killer dc's work so
---
Didnt think of that, thanks.
---
I have noticed that when I play the doctor usually everyone gets 20k+ BPs (even if no one survives).
---
It is alright, it is hard to get these things across on the internet since we can't hear each other's voice and tone.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info
---
And propane accessories
---
Usually yeah
---
you sound like you watch rick and morty
---
MoM doesnt eat STBFL stacks. So after hit 1 you have 6 stacks and u hit em again itll still be 6 stacks and 30% cooldown reduction
---
I had a stroke reading that
---
Literally a wooden ruler
---
where was this leaked!?!!?
---
MoM against a good Nurse buys you 5 more seconds, old DS didn't stop her, neither will MoM.
---
MoM works only against M1 hits. DS worked against everybody though.
---
Im in love. Any chance of a back, close up or detail shot? Wanna see his full outfit details
---
&gt;while he's not in a chase.
---
*Flashbacks of looking at the floor to drop chase as Legion*
---
Was a little aggressive with that comment... My point is slugging to prevent the Hatch is a shitty, unfair tactic that praise GOD shouldn't be happining anymore
---
Thanks for this!
---
I know.. f a good nurse we all dying lol.
---
“But what if some of the gens are out in the open where survivors can SEE MEEEEE!”
---
Yeah he wasted it for sure.
---
The lawsuit needs to be resolved with doing anything with the Friday the 13th license that would involve altering the canon in any way shape or form. Victor Miller wrote the script for the original film, and the idea is that he would own the character of Jason Voorhees, Pamela Voorhees, and story elements from the first movie, presumably. It's hard to describe the situation, very complicated.   
---
But the long and the short of it is that is why content for the game stopped, no movies can be produced, and no comics or novels can be produced at this time. However, merchandise that doesn't alter the canon, like action figures, don't fall under these parameters, so they can still be produced.
---
He has the same voice as Legion. Hope it’s just a placeholder and they aren’t going to be that lazy with it.
---
I'll remind you that huntress has only one model for her hatchets and it fucking sucks when you have a yellow corrupted big axe and basic hatchets to go with it
---
corn blindness is a real thing
---
why does ghostface have a stain while sneaking in the first place?
---
Yeah, stop chasing the guy with MoM, find someone else, hit them 8 times, then come back, waste half your stacks, oh wait, they had MoM too, holy dogshit are you potato. I hear Rank 18 is hard these days.
---
This is false.
---
Idk I might've gotten cut off because once I ran onto the hatch I was spamming the button and all of a sudden I was moved off the hatch as he walked on top of it like to block me from going on it. I thought for sure he was gonna close it but he started looking at the hatch and moving around as I was still trying to get on so I could escape and then he shook his head at me and hit me and I was able to go through him and escape through hatch. If it's still confusing it's probably because the situation was just as confusing to me cause idk what happened
---
Perhaps the experience of the player in basement is ruined and this should not be allowed??????
---
Thank you ☺️
---
He's unfinished, chill.
---
Ways to counter Freddy;
---
1- When you hear his lullaby, make sure you have a nearby pallet or window you can vault to escape him for when he places you to sleep. You have 7 seconds at base &amp; 4 seconds at lowest to escape him before you enter the dream world. 
---
2 - Count the time it takes you to enter the dream world. This is vital for determining what kind of Freddy you are against. If he is aggressive in that he chases you during the dream phase then its likely that he has block add-ons so expect a 4-second timer at worse. Use spine chill to see if he is going after you when you hear the lullaby. Use this to reach a loop or be near the loop to prepare for Freddy. 
---
3 - While in the dream world, the best thing to do is to try your hardest to break out as fast as possible. The best way is if you are injured and have self-care. Self-care has an amazing base skill check chance so you will usually break out really fast. Getting on a gen and failing a skill check is always a good way. 
---
Most Freddy players will take time to travel to the gen or will ignore the explosion if he is already chasing another survivor. You could choose to run from the gen to go to another. By the time Freddy will arrive he will waste a lot of time chasing after you. 
---
Never stay around someone if they woke you from the dream world. If Freddy spots this it's very likely he will go to the last known location so make sure to run as far as possible. 
---
4 - If being chased by Freddy be aware he is a normal M1 killer so susceptible to being looped. Try to loop him as long as possible as distracting him is the easiest way to win the game. If all your team is working on gens &amp; you distract him long enough then the chances of you being saved in end-game is really high. 
---
5 - Adrenaline &amp; borrowed time is amazing against Freddy. Adrenaline forces Freddy to lose a ton of momentum at the end game &amp; will usually cause him to lose if more than 2 survivors are alive.
---
6 - Never use stealth with Freddy while in dream world. He can easily just walk back a few meters &amp; find you through aura reading. I would recommend the same while outside of the dream world as you cannot see him.
---
Wait what? Unfair? 'splain
---
Thanks!!!
---
Nice...
---
Well, I’m gonna p3
---
That's why, it's insanely survivor sided.
---
It's Cassie's MKX fatality

"Smartasses get killed, we always see to that" from discordance. I don't know why I like that so much
---
I've always thought of Legion as Fuck Face.
---
Meanwhile, I am the complete opposite.
---
I hate waiting until the very last moment before the actual release for us to start seeing TEASERS about the upcoming character. Then, the week after, we get a PTB and everything is revealed. BHVR sucks at advertising their shit. 
---
With the leak, I am now hyped a whole month earlier for the killer because Myers was the only one left in DBD that still gave me jump scares. 
---
We still haven't seen the other two perks, the upcoming map and that "charm" thingy, you still can be surprised by that.
---
Not the ace please not the ace
---
^^^Doing ^^^gens, ^^^you?
---
I only say that because it still looks more efficient to use myers (it looks like the exposed is earned easier with a very low timer but its too hard to tell right now) but efficiency =/= fun. Ive been saving shards for something just like this
---
In terms of lockers, while Freddy doesn't see your aura once you're inside them, if you're outside of his terror radius (I want monitor and abuse but my Freddy's been at level 50 for days and the bloodweb refuses to give it to me) he can see your Aura entering the locker. He'll run over and open it. 
---
For the "Stick to the gen" thing fuck that. While you CAN pop the gen (which sucks for me) or get a skillcheck, I can sleep you right again, and if neither of those happen I can sometimes get a gen grab off of you. With pill bottle you can't see Freddy during the transition so don't always think if you don't see him he must not be waiting right behind you for a gen-pull.
---
may wanna repost it just saying
---
Yeah I have an issue with people that think Aliens are too far fetched for this Universe. A Universe in which a god like Entity transports unwilling contestants to an arena where they have to survive a possessed killer with a multitude of abilities including projectile vomiting and teleportation. Also forgot to mention when you die you are dragged into the sky by a black claw hand. But yeah, keep telling me how unrealistic Aliens are lmao.
---
So this is inaccurate... he may have been looking for you but he was not chasing you, you are in a chase when the killer music is going off. You were on those stairs for 20s uninterrupted. That's 25% of a generator you could have done until he showed up and scared the shit out of you.  
---
You are not worthless though, I'll say that.
---
Yes, there was some addons that would help with that
---
you should get twice if not more of the amount from chases/boldness/escaping
---
id say he is complete garbage and zero fun to play now, ive played with them since their release and just no
---
c:
---
Keep the memes coming my dude
---
Must have been a bug or a glitch.
---
Sucks.
---
the devs fought hard to get publishing rights back. I highly doubt they will go back in to another publisher
---
Most cases people don't expect certain addons. Addons change the playstyle in many ways.
---
Regarding the gen skillchecks, it's not guaranteed, but it "might" happen.
---
This has happened before, recently too. I strongly doubt this was an accident. That being said, don't let me piss on your parade, I'm happy you're excited.
---
[lol reminds me of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bm9bio/how_survivors_feel_when_they_get_to_use_the_new/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
Except Rocket League is a huge success with more and more e-sport orgs joining the game (even huge brands that weren't big in e-sport such as PSG and Barcelona football teams). 
---
I don't see why Epic would want to have anything to deal with a declining game such as DBD that doesn't have anything positive to offer at the moment.
---
I hope we are allowed custom perk icons in the workshop one day.
---
I know, i just mean in a hypothetical scenario where they both knew the mechanics, and were just spamming their buttons
---
it won't fill up the meter, but it will work when mettle of man is already activated
---
They sad it could not be done
---
I'm sure they signed a binding contract before the devs even began building the assets.
---
I’m okay with that
---
So your stat is incorrect. The actual stat is 43% survival rate. Someone else linked the corrected posted in this thread. This means the killer has a greater than 50% sacrifice rate across rank 1 games which is probably about right. Rank 1 games are supposed to be the best players on both sides and a close to 50% survival is about right imo. Also at these ranks, people ignore the totem unless they stumble across it, and that's how you should counter ruin anyway.  
---
Ruin doesn't really need to be changed, and the time on gens is probably fine. Totem placement, however, could use more rework. But what needs to change is additional objectives. Add more things that survivors need to do instead of just gens. Or maybe alternate ways to finish the game. In the end, both sides are just simply doing their job. As a survivor, your job is to do generators, open the gates and get out. As a killer, your job is to stop them. Adding other things to do will help, but holding M1 for 2-3 minutes "just because you think the game is too fast" is dumb. Nobody wants to be forced to do that. That is super dull and boring. The last thing this game needs is a way to cause every game to last 30 minutes. There's a reason why the cap for points if a survivor dies is at 9 minutes.
---
Removing a really strong perk that was behind a paywall would fuck up their money gain so they had to do a new one.
---
Dont take offense. I just think its funny.
---
nope his prestige weapon is the google fold
---
... you’re letting ONE (1) player represent the rest of us?? Sorry, I didn’t know we were responsible for that troll-players actions and behavior.
---
Dwight wasn't even exposed? That was just a double hit..
---
If it does happen, I can simply sleep you again. It DOES reset the 7 seconds and allow you to progress the generator but it just seems pointless as there's pretty much no "Cooldown" on sleeping people. The only time "Committing" to an action seems like a good option is if it's a hex totem or the gen is almost done.
---
But teabagging at the end and rubbing your victories in the killers face is fair, you guys won, just leave don't wait for the killer to come and hold the game hostage, it was because of this behavior the EDC was added. 
---
It's funny how you defend this action, because no killer wants to wait 10 minutes to just to go to the gate and see you teabag. 
---
But when killers slug it's illegal even thou there is a time limit before you die. Compared to when the survivor can wait as long as he wants to leave the gate. 
---
That the definition of people that dish it, but can't take it.
---
Even better as huntress: see someone out of the corner of my eye, look the other way charging up a hatchet, only to turn at the last second and kobe them.
---
i guess we will never know
---
Except that's a low-effort meme post and not an actual thought man.
---
I never thought about this and now I'm upset
---
Real tears
---
A sharp ruler...
---
3 isn't all bad. Compared to a lot of other horror sequels that is.
---
It's just really really really really fucking silly.  Even with the soap opera twist for the killer I still enjoy their fight with Sidney most. 
---
''God, why don't you stop your whining and get on with it already? I've heard this shit before! Do you wanna know why you kill people? Do you?" ''I don't wanna hear it!" "Because you choose to! There is no one else to blame!" "God fucking damn it!" "Why don't you take some fucking responsibility?" ''FUCK YOU!" ''FUCK YOU!" is classic.
---
Would
---
If you're saying what I think you're saying, then you really don't get why I said it why it should be Crowley next! BWAHAHAHAHA
---
Who the fuck says it's shit?
---
Michael Myers came back from the dead, so...
---
i'm excited for him but.. this... is so cheesy..
---
neither, and no sydney as survivor they only got rights to the mask not the movies sadly
---
Non coordinated SWF groups are just solo surivors, which I want to get rid of
---
Roadkill
---
This is fucking amazing
---
No, u
---
I get 4Ks and derank fairly often now. I don't care anymore, I got my 4k, I won, rank doesn't matter to me.
---
The red light is horrible and ruins him completely. D:
---
I've recently been told that me using the pink schoolgirl outfit and pink hair for Min looks toxic and that's why I get tunneled/camped often. But I just really like pink :c
---
Can you take a ban for doing this or is it safe ?
---
Some of the recent better Legions play differently than Legions of the past. Most who try to hit multiple survivors and slow the game down are probably saying he's worse than before. If you stop playing like that and play to his strengths he actually is a little better. He's still not high tier by any means, but the increase in his base movement speed is a huge thing as now it's a bit dangerous to stay injured.  
---
You run the add-ons that reduce the cooldown on Feral Frenzy. (Joey's Mixtape + Cold Dirt if you can). You use Feral Frenzy to free hit the survivor and put them injured, then catch back up to them. When you're right behind them, end your frenzy state, and down them. It allows you to end chases rather quickly and put a lot of pressure on the game.
---
This task’s a grueling one hope to find some diamonds tonight
---
exactly :) :) :) that'll show them how it feels when they do it! lol na it will be fun to do that and if they are in exit area first will be fun to crouch up to the outside of the exit and peak around the wall at them :)
---
Yeah, but it's a really bright red not a dull one that blends into the environment like the prestige tends to do.
---
I'm glad, because I love knowing I've given someone a good jump scare.
---
It is shit as it does nothing beneficial in game, but you get bonus bloodpoints out of it
---
I'm a killer main but everyone seems to be talking about survivor perks sooo I'mma say urban evasion, combined with diversion, lithe and like the new calm spirit it makes a nice sneaky build... I'm too immersed when I'm a survivor
---
Survivors don't look for the hatch anymore. New meta is to camp near a door and wait for killer to close hatch.
---
That’s not wrong! Your not supposed to hit a survivor who has been hooked until all the others have been hooked at least once! 
---
Let's be honest: it's still Dwight who's gonna be impaled ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Exactly, isn't that why people constantly use it?
---
Goal is to escape. :)
---
We all deal with games like that. The only prob i have with the community is we have way to many butt hurt boo boo face players who complain about EVERYTHING.  You are not supposed to survive every match and you are not supposed to get 4k every match.  For every I hate NOED post there is a I hate adrenaline post.  Look at the DC meta. It was not like this a year ago.  People will literally write I had a bad game post on Reddit.
---
**"might"** happen.
---
I'm very sure the ultra rare items are what she wore the day she was taken, The very rare is parts of the cannibals and everything else is swamp snacks
---
That's when he activates stealth and survivors can see it and hear it.
---
Stealth lasts as long as you don't stalk, then it starts a 5 second cooldown and stealth goes off
---
that’s not nice
---
Rather then less people being bothered by toxic survivors, now we get to hear about toxic killers too. 
---
Anyone that thinks tbagging is ok is an idiot and I hope they just uninstall already... its nothing beyond a tool for ruining the fun of a good game.
---
have you ever wondered what the heck have you created ? some dark things keep appearin in my head its scarin me :c
---
Unless you know where the hatch is already or have a key.  Ehh hatch has the same lvl of importance.
---
Collective punishment is a war crime according to the Jenova Project. May sephiroth strike you down.
---
you did it backwards, the better one is suppose to be second. No one cares fr collapse, everyone ADORES scream
---
Well, that would explain why it took me 6 matches to complete my “do 3 gens daily”.
---
They said it being an APRIL fools joke and it being May. But I totally think so too.
---
#Do the roar
---
Oh then I misunderstood you. I definitely think keys are also a problem (or at least were since I haven’t played since last patch) I’ve had games where I was on my first hook and the other two survivors escaped through the hatch and left me there to die. feels good lol
---
AND THEN YOU GET PUNISHED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET 9 HOOKS. WEEEEE
---
Tow people left. Pretty bad game for me and I had one hooked. Guarded and when the guy did come, they realized they didn’t have enough time, sat down and waited
---
Could we get Cookeh to confirm this?
---
Yes, but this is Reddit, not facebook or youtube
---
They definitely should wait to open the gate if they know someone is in a chase. The amount of Blood Warden's I've come across is pretty high.
---
Survivors literally escape and get the lest amount of bp for not doing anything but escaping. I’ve had several matches where I died and made the most bp while the escaped made less. If that makes you proud, go ahead.
---
Yeah, it’s messing up. I’ll fix it in a little.
---
They had to make a change for the EGC it would be broken with it
---
I had them all done up to ash doc except legions deranged Pursuit. That was tough.
---
What?? Scream was the highest grossing slasher when it came out btw and im pretty sure wasnt beat until last year with the new halloween.
---
I’M SURE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING DEFEAT WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING MOST THINGS IN LIFE SO IM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE INDEED
---
NO NO THIS MEETING IS OVER!!
---
Downloading the leaked patch again
---
Great post! You are exactly the crowd BHVR wants. Cosmetics on a character you play first person!!! Imagine that Hahahaha. Oh you fell for it. How about game fixes? Rank fixes? Glad there are people like you out there who get excited about nothing to do with the game and about visuals you can’t see. Smart
---
There were 3 gens left, not really keen on making 3 gens only to be probably killed anyway
---
Sweetheart, I think you're a bit out of the loop. Ghost Face is the newest killer, this was a Dev file that they were playing on.
---
Hello!  Never thought i'd ever consider myself a Legion Main until two weeks ago, once upon a time i hated their guts, now i can't get enough of playing them and i'm hyped AF for the new Frank cosmetic
---
Remember if you try to hug a survivor too quick at start of the match. He will dc . It was because he was to good to play you.
---
Told my friend I wanted this as a birthday present as a joke. It showed up on my doorstep today. Suddenly felt safe and was able to nap without any nightmares. 10/10.
---
Thanks for share facebook
---
You can still access it. I have it downloaded. You can even run it. I just need the commands now
---
**THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED.**
---
Is there anyone I can follow on twitter in order to stay up to date with the lawsuit?
---
I'd be more worried about Freddy's impact honestly. He's a literal meme in the community, at least the response so far to Ghostface is generally positive. As long as the devs don't dick it up like Freddy, I wouldn't expect many property holders to care. Leaks are pretty common in the horror industry.
---
As the victims not the killer
---
Wasn’t expecting the nyan cat, gave me a chuckle.
---
What? I dont have a facebook.
---
 Steven Lloyd 
---
for those who aren't movie wise
---
That's a very derpy outfit and it's one of the reasons i could never see him work in this game (the other being too many ideas on him using phones). But BHVR is showing they know how to do the job right and now i'm kinda excited.
---
I will give it credit for not having an impromptu musical number in the cafeteria.
---
Its tough I thought the grab still happened but maybe I'm wrong. What about other games?
---
Survivor would be a villager making villager sounds while injured
---
"Smartasses get killed. We always see to that."- The Legion.
---
Thanks. Just added his arm wraps and painted his chest more black to look less Shazam
---
Do all gens to 99 and pop them all up
---
This is amazing
---
Were you the last one left?
---
I don't think people who rely on cosmetics to make them nearly invisible deserve to be considered good players
---
Beast of Prey - "Where did she go?"
---
I love it because it makes me think of the entity itself thinking that due to the description of the text which states that momentarily your connection with the entity is lost.
---
For the amount of time investment it will need to actually get the exposed status on non-potato survivors, I don't think it's really worth it.
---
You'd be better off just chasing them and burning through pallets instead of waiting around while others burn through gens so you can get a 15 second exposed timer on someone who is going to not only hear you coming and dip, but when they get exposed, they'll burn through the same pallets you would have destroyed much sooner regardless. Then they will gain distance on you, and good luck trying to catch anyone in a 15 second timer that isn't a boosted bonobo.
---
Yup. Survivors give the best killer advice. If you are on the map after you hooked you are a camper. If you down them you  tunneled. If they escape you are a baby killer.
---
Lol. Ty
---
First time I seen it happen like that. But ya the devs removed hatch grabs
---
Yes the hatch only spawns after everyone else is dead or all gens are done
---
YW
---
They buffed it when EGC came out. However it’s still really useless. 
---
I think they should’ve made it “When you are the last survivor you open exit gates 5% faster for each unfinished generator.” That way its a niche wake up as it gives 35% if no gens are done and 10% if all 5 are. If they really wanted to they could make it affect gen repair speed as well because it would assist in getting the achievement as it used to.
---
Because a survivor can leave to join another game.
---
Oh man.  Those long pieces of fabric on his outfit are awesome. It’s gonna be freaky af to be working on a generator and be on the lookout only to see those dart around a corner.
---
That's actually genius I'll remember that next time
---
Looks fun and I can't wait to teabag people with him, but at the end of the day..
---
Worse Myers
---
Better Pig
---
Low Tier killer.
---
Bless you
---
This is a massive change! Huge advantage to survivors. Wonder if there will be any changes along with it? Directional breathing or something much harder to track?
---
Same. I think the problem is more of a console vs pc.  Console players I've found are dicks.
---
So the same thing as Myers
---
I hope with all my heart they give us Sidney &lt;3
---
These dark clothed Claudettes are mostly bad honestly. Catch me rocking the full white, shiny, flappy outfit
---
Wait is 99 the highest you can old for an add-on? Or have you just gotten 99 total
---
Okay but this is the video game industry. Meh I am over thinking it.
---
This boi is *s t a b b i e r*
---
It would’ve been better if the ace  just gave up
---
I'd keep my fingers crossed but I'm going to keep my buck 120 behind my back just incase behavior fucks me one more time. Just kidding. Fingers crossed 🤞
---
I play on console as well, and yeah there will always be dicks, but maybe I get helped more often because I have a quite altruistic playstyle
---
It could just be a placeholder effect since Ghostface isn’t due until like June or July.
---
Nah I’ve got over 100 of some pigs add-ons.
---
Yeah, I never believe that. I mean he's the kind of guy who'd say things to make himself look impressive despite being a huge nerd.
---
RabbitGirl\_Basement.avi
---
Hahaha this and the comments are hillarious XD.
---
You obviously know how to play this game. This makes your post a bit surprising.
---
1) looping Bubba for a long time is not exactly hard, especially when you get to find so many pallets.
---
2) the man got a 4K + pure salt on reddit in his name - as Bubba.... can't argue with the results mate.
---
Enjoy^^
---
true, but aces will be ace
---
This is incredible! Looks just like the real thing! (I legit thought the second pic was photoshopped from a game screenshot or something)
---
she doesn't need a buff lol
---
i swear to gods if it's not Sidney the survivor
---
Nah I mean intentionally tunnelling like they phase back to hook and see the unhooker and completely ignore them whether there’s 5 gens left or not
---
I would rather have them implement actual different gamemodes into the game
---
I play pc and maybe 8 games out of 10 are fine and the 2 aren't that bad.
---
Feel bad he didnt get to announce it but at the same time it was obvious what he was announcing so hit teases and asking for follows for early announcement came off.... idk the word? eye roll-y
---
did ash make the sound he makes when he falls when this happened? it's very obnoxious and i can't imagine hearing it for that many seconds straight lol
---
edit: didn't notice the sound button on the right rather than left
---
Can you show me a link to the gameplay?
---
I like your style!
---
Hell, a lot Better than I can do
---
Maybe just a little. Horror franchises are huge among their fans; often having details about upcoming merch, movies, even video games and promotional appearances leaked by people close to the franchise far in advance. Property owners are used to and expect leaks at this point it happens so frequently. The only thing that really matters to property owners is that their killer doesn't look weak, that's serious shit. Look into the back story of why Freddy vs Jason sucked so hard for an example of how serious they take that part.

Honestly I wish they would have used Legions kit for Ghostface, made the most sense.

it only shines through walls if you are on low settings and we don't know if they are on low settings or mot
---
This templates shall not go unused
---
I got this twice in one day XD
---
It seems as though your sneak runs out quicker while survivors can see you
---
Happy birthday to you both!
---
Agreed but if anyone PURPOSEFULLY disconnects like a bitch I'm gonna send them a message calling them a punk
---
*Angry Myers grunts*
---
Exactly, it's stupid to see people say Legion sucks now.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
It looks amazing! I don’t know anything about tattoos but it looks like it took a while!
---
Isn't body blocking in a way that restricts access to areas against the rules though? I know it's an option in the report menu. I think the annoyance was more that the killer is making it so it's impossible to access the basement rather than the fact he was camping, because this gave him no chance of being saved due to the killer's hit box being too large to pass.
---
No!!! Be nice!!! Complain to the devs for not punishing DC’s!
---
Yep
---
Farming saves lives 🤗
---
There is a reddit post to it..and one on Pauile channel
---
Its the model itself for use it on Source Filmmaker, a really good tool to make animations with Source engine.
---
Happy cake day
---
It was extrelmly hard to tell from the gameplay to be honest.
---
Whilst EAC and BHVR do not ban for the use of these custom perks yet, it is still altering the icon files and there is always the chance later on that EAC might detect this as an exploit and ban you. BHVR have made it very clear while these custom perks are not bannable, if EAC bans you for them, the Dead by Daylight customer support will not help you.
---
YESSSSS Someone else realized this too!
---
This guide is super misleading. I followed all the above and survivors were mad at me for using my yellow and brown addons.
---
Shocky daddy must be sacrificed to the entity.
---
I agree, I would have had no idea that that's how it works if I hadn't read the add on list.
---
Is no one gonna talk about the broken double knife mechanic? I mean it’s cool but personally unfair lmao
---
But look at Freddy und LF. They are weak so why wouldn't those holders be upset?
---
Your husband is a jerk, ma’am. He keeps making me scream when I’m trying to hide.
---
No, legion.
---
one of the fog whisperers that went to canada a couple months ago and saw this stuff ahead of time confirmed no survivor plus movie licenses holders want their intellectual properties to be movie accurate like how Freddy had to look like the last freddy they don't want their licenses messed with so if this was the Scream Ghostface he would be just like how he was in the movies with the black robe and everything....the fact that he is in a whole new costume is pretty much confirmation that it is a license for the mask not the movies.
---
It’s pretty nice :)
---
Yes like everyone else who talked about it because most people do this. I did link his video in the card and his channel in the discretion
---
i love how Legion went from the worst and simultaneously the most overpowered killer to a genuinely good killer if he's in the right hands. serious props to the devs on how they handled him.
---
Ok, by the gameplay he has four parts. 
---
1. Stealth- Press a button to cloak your terror radius for a bit
---
2. Croutch- More similar to survivor crouch than pig
---
3. Stalk- Stalk one survivor to fill THEIR meter, when this fills they are exposed, by the looks of it it fills extremely fast
---
4. Lean- Can do while standing or crotch, lean to one side and stalk, arrows show which way to lean
---
Legion was getting Merciless before the change. Bit easier now but this photo doesn't have a broad claim.
---
God dammit Bobby! Stop dancing around and help me stab this girl to death.
---
Honestly, they feel so much more consistent now. I don't feel like an asshole for playing them anymore.
---
These are so cool! I can’t explain how much I like these!
---
I got all that..but like speicis. Does his Stleath meter go away constaly..only when looked at? Does stalking fill it faster?
---
The point of the meme is the accidental leak
---
I'm not even sure if thats how it works cause it was confusing
---
I think you've kind of misunderstood the entire point of the post, bud. It's in reference to the claim that Legion is now apparently dogshit, which is evidently untrue, otherwise, he wouldn't be getting Merciless at Rank 2.
---
Play with no perks or add-ons? Maybe if killer just use M1?
---
Believe it or not, people actually host tournaments for DBD. For one, TydeTyme which I'm sure everyone knows has hosted his Stuffed by Daylight tourney, which my team won first place with a $750 prize, and Space Esports (From that terrible anniversary tourney) still hosts tournies with their most recent one being a weekly event with a collective 12 weeks with a chance at 150 each week. My team won 3 of them and came second once. Then there is a community on Discord that I'm apart of known as the DBD League where scrim matches are held every week. We have some well known teams in there. For anyone who cares, I am part of Instant Dodge.
---
I know this sounds like a bunch of gloating, and I hate that it does. I'm just trying to establish that I'm no random dude coming out of nowhere.
---
LeafyWasThere would like to know your location
---
Guys, even the DBD twitter said we got a peek at the next "CHAPTER." When have we ever seen a chapter that's only been one character? Pretty sure leatherface and ash arent listed as chapters, just standalone characters, meaning scream chapter will have killer, surv, map. And that's from the mouth of the devs themselves.
---
That I can't tell ya, probably too early
---
No!!!! Most perks and Addams fine. Others the devs ignore in exchange for new cosmetics.
---
Legion is bad, you probably just outplayed the survivors hard, or they were boosted.
---
Hasn't the community been positive on his changes? A lot of em said it improved Legion somehow.
---
I would definitely play ghostface. He looks really cool.
---
as someone who's scared of the noise you get when your computer bluescreens, i am petrified now
---
So the dev build that was ‘leaked’ must’ve been an older out-of-date build before they got Lantern Entertainment on board and the Scream IP with them?
---
Robert is directly referencing ‘Scream’ which Funworld, the owners of the mask and Ghostface name, has no rights to. 
---
Unless Behaviour is going to bundle Ghostface with an original survivor and map?
---
If the Scream IP has been acquired I hope we get the classic black cape and the TV show design to.
---
How do you camp without being an asshole? 
---
Why is charging a power while camping to secure at least one kill assholish when the purpose of camping is already to secure at least one kill? 
---
Why bother doing something if they're not employing their strongest tactic in securing a kill?
---
just do what he tells you to do 🤦‍♀️
---
DADDY MYERS
---
A lot of people have claimed that Legion is now unplayable, and that they're now an "M1 Killer".
---
A lot of the positivity towards the changes are because Legion was pretty unfair in the past, so anything is good.
---
yea ik but its not how the template is meant to be used. So idfk
---
You better watch out for his craps
---
That’s literally what everyone considers a psychopath to be.
---
[History repeats itself lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b30cvv/bhvr_did_an_oopsie/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I mean, I'm consistently double pipping with them at red ranks. Maybe you need to learn to play them.
---
How do we have ALL of these things already?   
---
We have his power, HIM IN GENERAL, his addons, his animations, his mori, his bloodied cosmetics, his alternate costumes... WTF?   
---
I mean I love it but still
---
What is your rank?
---
Leatherface just gets a bad rap because he attracts brainless players, but he's actually decently made and pretty spot on to his character in my opinion. My guess for Freddy though is that with the right perks and add-ons he's also pretty strong, but it's really a head-scratcher that he hasn't caused any problems for them. Maybe something binding in the contract terms or maybe he's only really been demo'd to the property owners with strong builds? These are old rich guys not typically known to really care or pay attention to quality as long as it's making them money also, maybe a little of that?
---
Spoilers dude! Spoilers
---
Ok.
---
Top tier flair my dude
---
Perk wise what do you suggest?
---
She's the only over the top zany thing in that movie that works IMO.
---
Not in my experience. The billies I’ve seen clearly aren’t 15 in ability
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
I think the biggest problem with people on this sub is that they cannot discern between opinions that matter and ones that don't.
---
No offense but what is your qualification for judging balance? Just because we are both human beings that bought DBD doesn't make us or our opinions equal. 
---
Every veteran killer main out there holds the same opinion as me, you would be hard pressed to find anyone who has enough experience and still tries to argue for Freddy.
---
So yeah, if you have any arguments why Freddy is not bad, except your opinion, I'd like to hear them. If not, keep your *opinions* to yourself, we have enough people on this subreddit that like to spout uninformed opinions
---
Mathieu next Ace skin confirmed?!
---
They most likely just allowed survivors to pass through the killers normal hitbox and made a new smaller hitbox for them to collide with.
---
Someone call the police
---
I'm never had a good blendette on my team, they always urban evades everywhere and let you die on hook cus gens are more important 🙃🤔
---
well 90% of the People on rank 15 are newbs
---
Yeah I think most of the other STAB actors playing the main characters were not well cast. I did like the body guard though.
---
But I thought the mask and the robe came as a set irl?
---
Like, why is the clothes so diff? I mean, im happy to have him, but also I'm very curious about the robe.
---
YEAH THE KILLER SHOULDNT PLAY IN THE WAY THAT GETS HIM WINS
---
HE SHOULD PLAY THE WAY YOU WANT HIM TO
---
*sad oink*
---
Wot
---
Where was that from?
---
Hooo damn that Huntress!! I may start playing her more lol.
---
Clearly I’m unlucky. Cause my Killers have still been very Rank 1 worthy. Optimal perk setups and all, something noobs don’t have
---
On the other hand, he did die...
---
I love monitor and abuse because it allows me to get closer without them realizing, sloppy butcher forbslowing down games since you have 115% now, thanataphobia is really good on him, ruin, and now Enduring Fury. My build is ruin, m&amp;a, Enduring Fury
---
I personally prefer 4 over 2. It's more like the original and an actual whodunit. They didn't pull out characters we haven't seen in 40 minutes as the killers.
---
and the media, this is a story for the ages
---
Not sure. Maybe since they’re making a new backstory and everything, they just decided to make it completely their own with a new design too
---
noob Killers can have good perks.
---
If someone played Survivor for months and decides to put those BP on Killers. still doesnt mean they are good.
---
Jerk = correct on this point. Unless we can confirm there are dedicated departments and backlogs kept separate for Cosmetics and Bugs.
---
David: "You're not Jake"  &gt;:(
---
I'd like 4 more if it didn't kill off the entire set of newcomers save the most annoying one and didn't have that really really really really bad ending at the hospital.  Nothing about that finale at the hospital makes a lick of sense.
---
Right, well lemme tell ya these Billies I’ve seen are good lol
---
Just wanted to share my story gee willikers might as well delete my whole account
---
Can't wait to let the survivors go for the safe in the basement after end game is reworked and just watch the timer tick to 0 as they get bodyblocked.
---
maybe you are just not on the same skill Level as before your break
---
Same with Billy sometimes after running into an object with your chainsaw.
---
Dude I agree with your opinion, but lets not be a dick.  
---
DbD is in a state rn, we don't need to hurt each other.  I don't like what he thinks about legion, but I respect his opinion regardless if it's the same as mine
---
Errr, no. Jerk = you came in here and insulted someone, for no reason.
---
But if that's the lay of the field, then I'm over qualified to keep discussing anything with you.
---
I’ll you do a video with all the leaked ghostface outfits and other leaked outfits?
---
Basement Bubba still lives dw
---
Success!
---
**shut up**
---
Aftercare. People always say to just use bond or empathy but I’ve been using aftercare since Jeff came out and it’s gotten me out of so many tough spots and even helped me and another person finish 4 gens and escape against a slugging and facecamping legion

---
How dare you stay behind  
---
No, ya know what? Screw you, you wanna stay? FINE. You can stay... HeheheHHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
You want Leatherface gone?
---
How are you able to play him ? :o
---
Its actually not impossible if youre under purple ranks
---
He can still be looped.
---
Deceased Erection
---
You can't bodyblock the basement anymore
---
i thought they would make the P3 mask as bloody as those halloween scream masks with the blood
---
But doesn't the end game activate when an exit gate is open, not when the last gen is complete?
---
You are fine.
---
Woah who hurt you
---
^(You dare oppose me...)
---
# Mortal?
---
It's Black Billy!
---
I don’t believe it applies to hooked Survivors.
---
I like the choice of trapper, he looks really nice here.
---
The one girl possibly lived (but with the death of Wes Craven hopefully there won't be another) I liked the girl throwing herself into walls and stuff. I agree the end wasn't the best, but at least it didn't try to retcon everything to make some random douche behind the events of the first movie.
---
Thanks chief
---
That game is beyond dead. Thankfully it was free on PS Plus lol. It had some good ideas, but Dead By Daylight became much more for horror fans
---
Google "sky pack dbd" and the first result is the tweet of the creator and how to change files. 
---
Note: Only works on PC
---
Maybe. I’ve also noticed some whack-ass new Killer perks. But it still doesn’t change the fact that Hardcore Killers are so unfun to face as solo Survivor 
---
Pretty much have to play Killer myself to get any enjoyment out of the game now. Well, that and admiring my Meg’s red sweatpants
---
Oh damn this is great! I love your line work, makes the image pop. You could do great tattoos with that style.
---
Of course, so can any Killer. CAN
---
did they call themselves telly tubbies
---
I can already feel people begging to nerf him...
---
I'd rather have Shaggy
---
The only thing I want to say is.... WAZUUUUUUP
---
I will not be able to play against ghostface without thinking about this every second, it's going to be hilarious.
---
This. I mean, don't actually HATE the devs, but I get what you mean. Petition the devs to fix the things you don't like about the game instead of forcing the community to work around it.
---
Blumhouse owns Halloween 2018.
---
Oof oof oof oof oof oof oof oof oof oof *items and cosmetics pop up*
---
Besides playing leatherface I think you’re good 👍
---
Without Brutal Strength or Bamboozle either from the looks of it
---
So did Cici and many other characters who never went against the stupid rules. Scream 2 was all about dismantling those so silly conventions. Killer kills.  No reason needed. Le surprise.
---
Clown
---
I want his bug gone!
---
Right now when you use your chainsaw and you hit someone you get a gigantic cooldown and you get rooted in place at the end of the charge, you can barely even turn your camera to look around. It makes all of his cooldown add ons worthless (since the bug makes the cooldown extra long regardless of the add ons), and makes speed limiter even worse than it was.
---
Compare the cooldown after hitting someone prior to the bug -&gt; [here](https://youtu.be/v8XcQoJHauA?t=6595)
---
to cooldown after the bug got introduced -&gt; [here](https://youtu.be/v8XcQoJHauA?t=19481)
---
The cooldown is gigantic and makes Leatherface even worse than he used to be, you lose so much time and distance.
---
I’ve stopped playing survivor until people calm down and figure out how to play the new endgame. I had too many stupid Claudettes sprint over to open a door I’d just left at 99% because someone was being chased.
---
**A BOMB’S BEEN PLANTED ON OUR ~~AMMO~~ BLOODPOINT SUPPLY!**
---
I understand where you’re coming from, but bodyblocking to purposefully restrict/prevent access to a certain area can AND should get a player banned. That rule applies to killers too, not just survivors. The killer made it literally impossible for the survivors to even get close to the hooked survivor, not only completely ruining the game for the hooked survivor, but also physically preventing the survivors from doing one of their main objectives, making it unfun for them too. Let’s say there was a way for a single survivor to permanently prevent a killer from carrying a dying survivor to a hook (and i don’t just mean bodyblocking/taking a hit, i mean permanently, completely preventing them from being able to reach a hook) it would be a HUGE issue.
---
Only allowed at pallets and exit gate to obtain points
---
I honestly didn't realise there was a bug with him, I only play him for dailies and haven't had one with him for a while
---
King of the Hooks.   
---
With Michael as hank, Clown as Bill, Wraith as Boomhaur, and Doctor as Dale
---
OOF
---
I mean that’s on your team though. They should of left but if they wanted to give him the free 4K then that’s on them.
---
I wonder what they do in their spare time.  It's almost time for work so lemme squeeze out some speculation:
---
Billy:  probably spends a lot of time tinkering with tractors or machinery in the Thompson house.  Sits at a desk and carves wooden ducks.
---
Wraith:  poor tormented boy.  Hangs around his old workplace reading the magazines the entity has pulled in there, maybe goes on panic induced flashbacks where he's checking inside of all the different trunks of cars.
---
Trapper:  Definitely spends a lot of time sharpening his traps and tuning the springs.  Probably has disagreements with the entity, hence the nasty hooks in his shoulders.  Begrudgingly obeys.
---
Nurse:  Sweet innocent lass dusts and tidies up the asylum.  Goes outside and pulls weeds, constantly throwing broken medical equipment outside.  The entity always shuffles up her hard work and she's only mildly irritated by it, but enjoys having something to do.
---
Hag:  mudbaths.  Maybe stalks fireflies and eats them, paints all sorts of freaky incantations on the walls with the mud, constantly in search of something meaty to eat.
---
Doctor:  Tunes the wavelength of the electrodes on his head, maybe takes off the mouth widener and sighs in relief.  Walks around the institute with a clipboard, ensuring all chairs are powered.
---
Shape:  Stands and waits for the next trial.  Sometimes glances as Laurie's house, maybe goes in there and checks for her out of habit.  Other times I bet he sits on her sofa and just waits.  Could possibly sit in the police cars and fiddle with the controls, or listen to the 'radio'.
---
Spirit:  Honestly?  Probably too upset and angry to chill ever.  Given how constantly tormented she is, probably stalks around her 'house' searching for her father.  Maybe longingly stares at the little creeks and bridges of her estate, remembering past summer days where she watched koi and dragonflies with her mummy and daddy.  This of course makes her spiral back into anger and she returns to the house to search for him.  Repeat.
---
Huntress:  Maybe tries full vocals for her song.  Spends her time playing with toys she's collected over the years.  Perhaps admires the shininess of badges and belt buckles she's gotten off of non-children.  Could probably spend a little time looking over a small child-graveyard and wonder why they didnt live as long as her.
---
Clown:  Sits in his rickety trailer and tests new mixtures of tonic.  Huffs and maybe drinks some of them for fun, at the expense of his health.  Thankfully the entity wont let him die, so he can kind of abuse it.  Probably has that horrible cough because the entity wants to punish him for abusing his immortality.
---
Legion:  Definitely kicks back and watches television or listen to rock albums in the lodge.  Probably pilfer some of the Clown's alcohol when they're in his realm and bring it back for illicit teen activity.  And if we're honest?  Probably some kinky shit since they're sexually active and not going anywhere.
---
Cannibal:  cooks Chili.  Probably spends some time in the Thompson's house because it reminds him of home.  Obeys the entity because he's truly afraid of it.  Doesn't have a realm of his own so he sadly screes when the entity boots him out of Coldwind when the Billy returns.
---
Pig:  Devises new ways to quickly strap on RBT and reduce the noise of her clothing.  Fiddles with jigsaw boxes and decorates the meat plant to look more intimidating.  Adds thick plastic doorway shutters, maybe sprays down the pig heads on the ground with a hose to increase maggot count.  Gross Amanda jesus.  Her constant RBT fiddling made it not activate when all gens are done.
---
Nightmare:  Probably sits around the preschool and does creepy shit with the drawings.  Let's leave it at that.
---
Plague:  definitely recites her chants and incantations, incenses the halls and chambers below.  Likely purges through the gates in an attempt to appease her gods.  Maybe even puts the entity into her chants.
---
That's what I've got for now, Time for work!
---
And Sidney didn't have Balanced Landing either
---
Ah! I found your Problem, you are a Meg Main. no wonder...
---
Thank you :)
---
What I dislike is when killers slug the last survivor and just wait for the timer to run out. I get that it's all new, but waiting around just to satisfy their desire to watch the entity spawn for the umpteenth time isn't fun. Other than that, I think the endgame collapse is a great addition to the game.
---
I'm more interested in how they took a selfie on a phone that doesn't seem to have a forward facing camera. At least i've personally never known a flip phone to have one.
---
He made the correct move by doing that, I would have done the same. He was out of time and his power is very effective at facecamping hooks.
---
Jason is my favorite, I hope so
---
Oh wow, now you're insulting me because you don't agree with. I don't think we should continue, as you ignore my arguments and just keep writing that bs. Cya
---
The boogey man.
---
You’re assuming the gates don’t spawn near each other, or that the killer doesn’t have mobility. If they do, the survivor is boned.
---
Super Freddy Please! (:
---
Finally the Payday 2 crossover we've been waiting for
---
Crap
---
Clown is good, Spirt can work if your good with her, Pig can kinda stop it, Legion. Doctor can stop it too.
---
Server desync probably. 
---
The trapper was kicking the gen somewhere else, his data lagged and the game showed you their image mid animation. I've seen it happen once on Jen's stream a while ago.
---
If it isn't a stealth based killer I will be really disappointed tbh
---
*tp behind you.OMAEWAMOU,SHINDEIROU.Nani??!! *goes to the basement instanly.
---
Look it up, items have a color rarity but you can just buy some of them in the store anyway.
---
my favorite matches have been matches as killer where I’ve willingly let every survivor go after screwing around with them and being stupid together or matches as survivor where I’ve literally just crouch walked along side the pig everywhere she went and used the footage to do one of those memey styled clips of games. Shits hysterical and some of the most fun I’ve ever had in this game tbh
---
Maybe. If Ghostface os their own chapter then yes. If it is a paragraph, as I've heard some people call it, then no. Maybe since we've gotten an individual survivor, Ash, then we'll get another individual killer?
---
Legion could be good that’s it
---
I get the exact same vibe, I feel like every Billy I vs is the same person. The games are always frustrating and he ends up slugging or magically zooming into you regardless of what you do.
---
Which makes it better to add another iconic one
---
But ghostface will be better
---
so he'd have had a better experience if he lost some other way? survivors often play in a way that ruins the experience for killers, like running Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and Mettle of Man while exploiting broken loops for the entire match which the killer can do nothing about. then they teabag, which adds nothing to the game other than a form of harassment. soemtimes, this backfres, and one of them gets camped at the end, which can often be the killer's only option. its a risk the survivors take.
---
So a survivor that does over half of the teamwork in a match on their own doesn't deserve to get out...?
---
Guess I'll just run to killer when I'm last alive and give up.
---
Yeah for sure. Have no idea why I didn't when I looked back on the footage, I never make good decisions when I hurry in this game though.
---
I wore it for 7 years straight.
---
only addons i really like, the rest just mess up my movement too much or are just plain useless
---
*under-qualified
---
No perks are toxic. They’re not meant to be fair. They’re meant to give you an advantage. Survivors have a lot of annoying perks as well. Should I cry every time I see DS, MoM, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard etc? Are survivors gonna stop using those if I cry about them being toxic? Or should I put my big boy pants on and just play the game?
---
Wouldn't it technically be hacking and get banned for it?
---
he didnt surprisingly
---
"Yep"
---
[This?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9br83c/that_face_when_the_community_for_a_game_youre_in/)
---
Here's my interpretation;
---
1. Crouching (secondary power button): can be done at any time. This does not remove your terror radius or red stain, but also maintains your movement speed and you can still attack. As such, this is less for traditional stealth amd more to simply to make you harder to see.
---
2. Stalking (power button): when you hold down the power button while looking at a Survivor, you will stalk them. Their aura will go from white to red, and a meter will fill behind their portrait (bottom left of the screen). When the meter is full, the Survivor becomes exposed for 15 seconds. If the meter is not full, it will enpty over time when not being stalked.
---
3. Leaning: when near certain walls and objects, an arrow will appear in the bottom-centre of the screen. At this point, holding the power button will cause you to lean around thr object. Doing this will cause Survivors to become exposed *much* more quickly.
---
4. Shrouded Hunt: represented by a power meter (currently around the Evil Within image). When full; tapping the power button will cause your terror radius and red stain to disappear, accompanied by a chirp sound. You can still stalk perform all actions at this time, including attacking and stalking. As such, there doesn't seem to be a way of stalking without activating this power when it is available. Also, being seen causes this power to run out far more quickly.
---
I think we need to have respect for the devs too. There's an awful lot of work and heart that goes in to a game like this that neither you or I will ever know. Just because there is a perk or in-game mechanic that you don't like or lessens your enjoyment of the game, it doesn't make you right when you vilify the creators of the game. Trying to incite hatred on anyone is a shitty thing to do.
---
Yeah it's pretty awful when people do this. I find it hilarious though when the killer goes after them instead of you though
---
OwO
---
Must... Destroy...
---
That sucks. Like it sucks when 6 out of 10 killer games I play that a survivor quits when in first chase. I had people dc just to stop double pip. We have cry baby's . lets all discuss why noed is over powered again or camping instead of talking about why there is a dc meta.
---
Shit can get
---
Sorry i think Devour Hope is in effect
---
That's sick.
---
Where's the loud fire crackle sound? Why aren't the candles lighting it up more? What is this? Hex: Harsh Reality "All hex totems now have realistic lighting and make no noise"? 
---
Honestly though, that's a pretty good replica.
---
As a pig main I’m now sad we’re not the only who can be assholes
---
yeah this fatass not very good at hiding
---
as I understand, the only bodyblocking that's actually banned is when you bodyblock someone in a way that holds the game hostage, forcing them to quit the game to leave. blocking the basement to prevent a person from being unhooked isn't banned, but if you block them from leaving the basement at all, that's banned. its also possible for either side to block a survivor into certain corners of some maps; this is banned. it''s possible for survivors to block the killer from hooking someone or picking them up; not banned.
---
spirit billy and nurse are the only viable killers with add ons against 4 competent players. Obviously if 1 or more is not  good at looping etc any killer is viable.
---
Gee willikers lol that killed me and nah man I think she deserved that
---
Dwight's new hair is certainly... something.
---
I think I downloaded the wrong endgame movie...
---
Ah yes, give yourself disadvantages and let the survivors win. Best way to play a game!
---
these guys just werent that good tbh
---
That...sounds kinda really bad acaullty. What is his power suppoed to acaullty do?
---
Nah.
---
BHVR markets itself as "Canada's largest independent developer".
---
They can only leave if I put the trap on them after the last gen, not if the timer is already ticking (except via the Hatch)
---
yes
---
nice instasaw you boosted ape
---
Leatherface is toxic bro
---
Just bought the game eh? Don’t worry. This is normal in lower ranks
---
The devs say they won’t ban you for it, however if the anti-cheat picks it up and bans you for it they won’t help you.
---
It wouldn't make sense to discard the later movies. Tapp is the most iconic Saw protagonist. He wasn't given up in that first movie.
---
it's only banned if you bodyblock to hold a game hostage. the devs have explained this before. the whole *point* of the game is to prevent the other side from completing their objectives; rescuing a survivor prevents them from being killed, and killing a survivor prevents them from surviving. this si why survivors are also allowed to bodyblock hooks to prevent a killer from hooking someone they carry. Is it fun? no, but it's still allowed.
---
That was the only Halloween costume I used twice as a kid. It'd be dope if it was a cosmetic released for a Halloween event.
---
The thing is you are excusing her being a monster for mental illness when most of the killers are the same way.  Trapper was also manipulated and delusional, as was Bubba, Nurse is just a single woman who went insane after years of grueling work in an asylum, most Legion Members are just misled by Frank, Plague pretty much is just a scared young woman trying to get a cure to her deadly sickness, and Hag was a woman brutally mistreated by men who ate her.  None of them are psychotic monsters, most of them are normal people, manipulated by the Entity, delusional, or mentally ill.
---
I hope The Ghost is a good killer. I never saw The Plague again after her release.
---
A swf group
---
It turns the game into a 50/50 for the most part. I guess that's better than a waiting game, though.
---
i just broke my neck
---
His power description is super basic too.
---
We can't really judge him on his numbers etc now zince it's a half-finished chapter.
---
OK THANKS FOR LETTING US NOW

---
How to beat him? You loop him. That's really about it. His power gives you 7 seconds of safe runtime to find a loop. While he's chasing you everyone else is doing gens.
---
The real power of Freddy comes from when he can keep multiple people in dream world. Because then he slows down the game enough to spend time in chases. If people are easily snapping out, then he's just a worse wraith.
---
I hope his P3 has enough blood to hide the stripes on his hood and make the robe look more black overall. So he can finally look like Ghostface and not an assassin's creed character.
---
It makes it so you can 1-shot the Survivor.
---
If you can stalk around a Survivor while stealthed, you can expose them before they realise what's happening.
---
Even then, he seems to be a 115% Killer, meaning the power doesn't *have* to be overly-strong.

+1 to this and I personally like third seal or nurses calling to discourage healing.
---
&gt;Tapp is the most iconic Saw protagonist
---
Okay you might not agree to discarding story, but that's just... Not true. I didn't even remember the guy and I binge watched the movies not long before release.
---
This gave me an idea, but since i am too lazy to draw it,  I'll just say it. Since the legion are not teenagers anymore (they are in their 40's):
---
Office frank: A hooded suit and a mask with glasses and not smiling anymore.
---
Housewife Julie: A dress and apron and a avocado mask.
---
Clerk Joey: Standard clerk outfir with a mask with the 7 eleven logo.
---
I hate Susie, so nothing for her. Maybe crack addict or something like that.
---
YOU ARE VERY WELCOME seriously VERY VERY WELCOME :)
---
No since once the exit gates are powered and the “last” survivor is the last one, the hatch opens by default so you can wait at the hatch and the second the gen pops you can close the hatch and since it doesn’t take too long the aura of the just completed generator will tell you at least where they started running from.
---
Exactly why I run an anti-tunneling setup. Killers like this keep showing up all the damn time. Apparently everyone has a bone to pick with Ash
---
Hahahaha
---
An easy 4k by the looks of it
---
Well yea..i assume its not finished.
---
FINALLY a quicker tbag than the pig's. Always felt the pig tbagged too slow.
---
Naw naw naw he toxic at least on PS4 idk how tf to 360 his ass that chainsaw power crazy.
---
I think that Spirit was me!
---
If this was the day before egc then I’m pretty sure this was me
---
Really? What rank are you in? I see her not infrequently around ranks 7-9, tho I know rank 1/2 is mostly the same two or three killers, which I think is more than just a killer issue.
---
The entity does that to make her feel special.
---
Whats ur psn? I can check
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE BLOODPOINTS SO SLOW TO GET!!!! WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET THEM BEING NEW TO THE GAME
---
Maybe check the gates before end game and before your potato team dies? You have options. Unlike what the killer had before
---
Sadly this is the kind of answer i expected and for good reason, to have a game you have to meta, point of my post exactly, they need to make nurse, billy and ruin NOT necessary, just an option.

I had an idea for ‘fuses’. Where survivors would have to find an item to install into the door to open it. This might help with that issue.

That’s Bill from Left 4 Dead. He is a PC exclusive character.

Jesus Christ this is horrifyng, I think I'm going to have nightmares with this image. Btw who's the sexy beast with the bright teeth and mask?

:( i want him

Well we don't expect them to work aothout a cell tower. THONKING

LMAO
---
Thats a win IMO
---
If she would have fast vaulted, maybe lithe would have activated :(

Thanks, I hate it
---
Not even help?

Different departments, different jobs.
---
What, is throwing five artists and modelers going to somehow help the six Programmers fix the code?  Because I got to tell you, as a programmer my girlfriend can't help me fix my stuff despite her art degree, and I can't exactly help her paint because I make horrible looking stick figures.....
---
[I think the wiki is up to date, it says:](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Black_Lock)
---
The Hatch will become visible (*"spawn"*) whenever the number of fully repaired Generators  exceeds the number of living Survivors by 1: 
---
* 4 Survivors remaining: 5 repaired Generators / Exit Gates are powered
---
* 3 Survivors remaining: 4 repaired Generators / 1 Generator left
---
* 2 Survivors remaining: 3 repaired Generators / 2 Generators left
---
* 1 Survivor remaining: 2 repaired Generators / 3 Generators left
---
The only difference is that the hatch will ALWAYS spawn if there is only one suvivor left in the game.
---
So, a glitch, maybe ?
---
You're not even reading what is written. You're reading independant sentances and tying your own assumptions to them rather than reading in entirety what is actually being said....

Wait, so the way you were doing it is a sideways type of moonwalk? I can do the "pc" version a little bit, didn't know there was a variation?

The chance of EAC picking it up is less than 1%. You’ll be fine. I and my friends have done this for a year, and no ban.
---
1. How do you actually know he was planning to camp 30 seconds in? That just sounds like you’re making assumptions. 
---
2. I don’t think the killers the one with the ego problem here. You’re crying on reddit about a killer killing you in a game. Meanwhile he’s playing another game and has most likely forgotten about you.
---
All that dedicated servers are going to do is ensure that your connection, and yours alone, dictates your latency.
---
If your internet sucks, you're still gonna have issues. (That is, if BHVR can have decent servers)
---
Fair enough, just like any other game with punishable offemces.
---
Heh, I rather get the nurse skin
---
If the killer closed the hatch then yes
---
That's a great idea, but I'd keep the hooks and stuff in a "classic" gamemode that would be the basis of official tournaments and stuff. But I like your idea of having to be respawned. But you should still rely on another survivor to be brought back that way the more survivors killed still applies more pressure. If you get yourself back the only pressure is on the killer to kill everyone before someone comes back.
---
Yea it looks like a placeholder. It also shows a plague infected timer on the surv and the Myers stalk icon.
---
Once is a leak 2x is a marketing ploy.
---
&gt;it's an ego problem
---
I mean, your comments in this thread have suggested that you're the one with the ego problem, but okay.

Survivor probably had a key
---
Dead but I always get a full lobby LOL also if it wasnt for the Friday's lawsuit DBD  wouldnt be so pupular

He knows because he thinks he's god.

Could also have a power where he can seek out a survivor by setting off their cell phone. HOLD SPACE TO SILENCE YOUR PHONE! hahah devs gotta do better stuff not just lean and peak and stalk.

---
I was still thinking of keeping the hooks themselves as a way of killing.
---
And that's fair. Maybe, bringing yourself back takes way way longer[I mean a crazy amount of time]? That way the killer has an opportunity to apply pressure on the other survivors, gens, etc. Whereas, it incentivizes survivors to work together bringing someone back and sacrificing time on gens.
---
You have an opinion, as do I. Mine is based on 3,000 hours of game time as a rank 1 survivor  and killer.  But, I'll take the moral high road seeing as your response made accusations of me crying, which shows your argument is weak considering you had to insert said accusations.  
---
I was actually laughing that that nurse needed such crutch perks. Maybe if you re-read it without your killer main bias, you'd see I explained a scenario that occured. No crying or complaining,  just simply sucked is all. You know what happened after the match was over? I moved on to the next game. Hell, I even gg'd the killer. But if my opinion got you this bent out of shape, you must be one insecure and fragile person.  I hope you find a cure for that.
---
Lol don’t worry people get their kicks from being toxic on reddit. If you’re a tea-bagging survivor you really shouldn’t complain about getting facecamped 100% deserve it.
---
Legion not having a terror radius is op change my mind
---
*End game Freddy doin' work in the Wreckers*
---
My problem with Franklin's on legion is that his power encourages you to immediately leave a survivor you strike, giving them the opportunity to just pick back up their item.
---
Ading ding ding
---
He is, only the survivor and other killer abusing the exploit (which is hard to pull off correctly and damn near impossible to do accidentally) will get banned, the person who queues as a killer normally won't get banned.
---
I'm gonna jump on in a bit and see if it happens for me.
---
True tho, at least but it does destroy the item slightly, and since you WILL hit them a bunch,  pair this with distressing, iridescent button, and overwhelming and you have fuck your items Legion
---
They are not interested in DBD2,they are going to support the game for 4 or 5 years. They would rather make a new IP. At least thats what they said in a dev stream.
---
yea same, those extra clothes arent really cosmetics, but ash's stuff most definitely is
---
Why would they leave the injured survivor and go for the idiot unhooking them who's full health. Seems counter productive to me...?
---
Y my pp hard?
---
&gt; Since they seemed to have copy pasted Myers makes sense they used the icon.
---
Sorry I should have been more clear.
---
Since they seemed to have copy pasted Myers _at this stage in development_ it makes sense they used the icon.
---
I mean one of them is a physical powerhouse and the other most likely owns enough bath salts to suplex a sumo wrestler
---
Mixed, no evidence for it except for RSB saying there will be
---
That is my problem with this community I don't even care about the people doin the r34 stuff, that's not problematic.
---
Probably not because they have to get the rights from whoever owns it right now. I'm not saying there won't be, but there *might* be.
---
I like legion tho
---
The flaw is with the game, that kinda chase was probably really annoying for him. Yes the killer was bad, but I understand why he did that.
---
fuck it. HISSSSSSSSS
---
Yea thanks wasn’t sure how this would help...
---
I feel you, hell when I don’t play nurse I play Freddy and the difference is extraordinary and to play high rank you shouldn’t have to play nurse or billy.
---
This is art
---
At what point do we say they're doing it as marketing? They're getting a ton of press for it.
---
They said it wasn't ready, it was just a dev build.
---
That's a very neat idea. Glad we have all these new meme builds to develop.
---
I saw the final day movie where the edgy teens torture their classmates, but like legion the edgy were like 6 and the rest were around 30 ppl
---
First of all if people get this mad playing the game they need to take a break for less stressful recreational activities. This game isnt the biggest part of anyone's life so no one really has a reason to be so irate about the game. If someone does get incredibly mad at the game I'd also suggest anger management.
---
explain
---
For everyone getting their hopes up for Sidney, I hope we get her, but I have a feeling that the costume for Ghostface means we’re getting Scream the TV Show Season 3 Ghostface not Scream the movie series Ghostface.
---
Rocket League I've always thought had a good early quit ban. It's a time ban. It only occurs on ranked games and each time you do it you get a time ban from the server.
---
Yeah there's a quit early button, but that's in all mp games. Unfortunately, if you agreed to launch into the match, you should be obliged to play it.
---
better than the pig. 
---
i can tell this is top tier killer potential
---
I didn’t even see her
---
Right??? If I get mad as a survivor I just play as a killer and wipe ‘em out for a couple matches 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm sure she can take it off, it's just that she doesn't(Or rather the license is doing so)
---
honestly Legion plays so much better now that it moves at normal speed and the way it spreads groups of survivors to make them mend, now you don't need to tunnel or moonwalk to get kills, just stab them all, go after the last injured survivor and repeat

I swear, every single match has had at least 2 DC's since the mid-season patch dropped. It is so exhausting trying to play now.
---
Deal! 🤝
---
I love that he said he got more points than me even though you get 0 points when you disconnect. 😂
---
Ya know what, throw in lightborn and boom
---
I think a regular respawn would work. 3 lives per match would be okay. I came from friday the 13th to dead by daylight and I couldnt fathom someone getting rescued from the hook and them not being dead.
---
My survivor is rank 12. I believe he was rank 14. So yeah low rank but not low low rank
---
As if it wasn't like that long before this patch. The last couple months someone has dc'd on first down pretty much every game.
---
The DCs are horrible right now even on playstation 4

---
Yeah, pretty much. Friday the 13th had some really good ideas, but a slew of other problems.
---
Yeah I’m rank 14 and I see a lot of bubbas
---
Ghost face is just better legion. And I’m excited
---
It did, if I remember right, i was in the chair for around 3 hours.
---
Your power removes the red stain too. That can be used for a quick mind game potentially. Not super usefull but maybe with faster recharge power rate addons could be a consistent strategy.
---
“okey daed”
---
Buckle up fuckkos
---
How big is your penis
---
It has to be on purpose. Things were being leaked from most chapters and since Hag Chapter. There's tons of examples and it doesn't look like accidents.
---
That's my go to. I have dick teammates do dick things to me. I've had dick teammates say dick things to me because I didn't pick up there slack.
---
Heavy
---
I am not saying it wasn't. Hell, if you check my post history, I have an entire 30 minute video dedicated to people DCing in Dead by Daylight. I have just noticed that it is MUCH worse since the mid-season patch. It used to just be 1, maybe 2 people would DC. Now it is regularly 2-3 DCs EVERY match.
---
For context, I was playing Legion while they were streaming and this camera bug happened twice, here's the [first one](https://clips.twitch.tv/FlaccidArtisticWatermelonKeepo)
---
She wasn't even camouflaged; Meg was just channeling her inner Ninja.
---
Reduces the duration of the stun after leaving FF.
---
They left out the part where your supposed to stand in a corner and feel shame for trying to do your only objective also.
---
All the background images are from the [DBD Wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki). I don't have sources for the individual images unfortunately.
---
Epic
---
And dlcs
---
Wow, that’s a long time. At least the result is phenomenal.
---
Ok. Nice. Thanks
---
instasaw spirit enduring oof
---
There isn't really anything wrong with rushing back to the hook if you're not actively doing anything. I mean if you got no leads then a giant explosion says "prey here!" you kinda go to the prey.
---
As well if im rehooking you after an unhook it tends to be less tunneling and more your buddy is better at running and hiding.
---
Or ya know, you two Decided to hug it out under the hook and your buddy ran like hell leaving you crouching there defenceless.
---
Fair enough
---
I think it's a minute and a half if you do it ideally with a full stack of remember me and have everyone in the dream world before they start working on the gates. 
---
Exit gates normally take 30 seconds to power up (I think), with a maxed out Remember me you get an additional 30 seconds of gate opening time (5 seconds for every hit on your obsession maxing out with 30 seconds at 6 hits), then the dream world penalty adds a 50% action speed reduction which gets the last 30 seconds.
---
How did you get this? KYF I’m guessing
---
F13's playcount was already on the decline before the lawsuit happened, iirc.
---
Actually there has been a version like that for every male survivor which makes me question why we don't have those in the game yet
---
how do you do it?

Same way u do the pc way, but moving it down
---
Yes I know that I was just correcting his comment
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Actually, the hair textures are bugged and can be seen from across the map. The left image needs the charcoal cap.
---
GL, I hope I'm wrong and consoles are free of this bug.
---
Dude are you that dense? I know what month it is.. it was an example like maybe they are just fucking with us. Like it's a joke.
---
Cue the stalking montage
---
I think the hit box is only smaller on basement stairs
---
I picture everything of him in his Samination parody voice, fits nicely.
---
Jesus is was an example that's why I said low key!
---
Guy who was originally meant to announce the chapter refers to it as the Scream chapter, and states there'll be a survivor and killer.
---
the lawsuit is expected to close within the next few months
---
Yes I have, dipshit. He gets killed in scream 2 by the original scream killers’s mother. Do your homework before you preach.
---
why are you such a dick all over the subreddit all the time? :/ doesn't it get exhausting being this negative constantly?
---
We still got his perks at least, look on the bright side though they only lied one time so far about being done with PC exclusives.
---
i would love to have pamela and alice in the game
---
They modeled her whole head under the mask, even adding the detail of having glassy eyes because she's technically dead. Not sure they lack the licences.
---
Ok dude.. tell someone who cares.. yall take these reddit post way to serious.
---
I’ve seen worse
---
"Webpage not available"
---
Why would anyone say discordance is a shit perk? I use it on most of my killers and it's awesome with nurse, hillbilly and spirit
---
Anyone know if this will proc spinechill? Or if it’s like tier 1 Myers and there is detection immunity for a short time

You seem new to the game, based on your rank. If you aren't enjoying the game, maybe it isn't for you.
---
So the power red bar is for peeking??? Pleas tell me that he has not CD for the stealth
---
Great now I've gotta learn how to Huntress on Xbox.
---
Seems a bit pointless though.
---
But this is David we're talking about. Even without a weapon he clearly has more experience fighting vs the least edgy teen out of the group who wasn't going to stab until Julie made her do it. That's where the devs messed up it's hard to believe a group of teens can do this even with entity powers. Frank could be an exception though as he was clearly deranged
---
What are his perks???
---
i wasnt talking to you, dipshit.
---
Yeah its just weird the outfit is different hopefully they change it also michael is called the shape instead of michael
---
There’s no mention of trumping detection perks so Spine Chill, Premonition etc should trigger even while he’s stalking/crouched
---
Lmao do true
---
Omg me too...  like people take reddit dbd way to serious.. you cant have fun or say anything anti killers related. Always a down vote. I mean do those even matter? Like i dont get the point of downvotes and karma.
---
Honestly, it's not too different to what they did with The Pig. She looks noticeably different to her film counterpart.
---
Fun fact, Myers is known as The Shape because that's how he was referred to in the credits and script of the original 1978 film.
---
check r/PerkByDaylight and check if anyone posted them
---
We need the father death robe.
---
Because good survivors split up and thus the perk won't see use.
---
Still ain't bad.
---
They did a patch a few months ago to buff Jason but before that a good player could take Jason on all alone. It used to be the best part of the game for people. Then they went downhill with the lawsuit and even further downhill with the last patch. I wish I had the combat of f13 with all of the dead by daylight aspects.
---
Worth it
---
Not really how this stuff should be handled tbh
---
Legion to me has always felt like an attempt at a killer to represent The Purge movies.
---
WHAT ABOUT BODYBLOCKING A HOOK TO PREVENT THE KILLER FROM HOOKING A SURVIVOR?
---
Spectating does stil remove dead/escaped players.  Whenever I pop back in to see what my teammates are up to, my name is no longer on the roster.
---
I agree, but if you've been on the internet for more than 5 minutes, you'd realize that banning one person won't do anything
---
“I should only be allowed to bully people but it’s not ok when they do it back to me Bc I’m entitled.”
---
And thus the shitty survivor main logic
---
Keep spamming your video
---
One day someone might actually watch it
---
Did you killed the janitor?
---
Found the killer who used to shake their head and try their hardest in 3v1s. Thank god that's no longer a thing
---
Hey, don’t attack fat Jesus, he’ll get his father, fat god, to smite you
---
Honestly, what i think they need is make Deep Wounds more of a threat in some way, have missed attacks reduce it by like 25%, remove the normal attacks removing it, and maybe make mending take longer. 
---
Another thing is let hitting survivors with deep wounds do something.
---
I’ve already gained 18 subs and 1k views :) But don’t worry I will - go back to Roblox instead of stalking every post under this thread every single day
---
Jumping out a second story window and being hit a full second after the vault has been my worst hit
---
Let me show you fortnite
---
Here's my version of Frank's mt:
---
•Attacking survivors with deep wound in feral frenzy doesn't turn it off
---
•Successful attacks reduce deep wound timer by 30%
---
•Mooving speed in feral frenzy reduced to 4,8 M/S
---
Ultra rare rarity.
---
is ash really a chapter? I just assumed he was a paragraph
---
Taking "ez kills"  is pretty much what's led to the epidemic of DCing. No one wants to be first down cause they know how the story plays out. Scummy as fuck gameplay guaranteeing you'll depip with no points.
---
physics?
---
Excellent point
---
I just realized, it's never really a 360. It's always a 720.
---
long boi w the long hitbox
---
Don’t buy it, it breaks in the first few seconds....
---
There’s a button that literally hides chat. The stuff in the picture is extremely mild.
---
Legion is a horrible killer concept so to me is more of a killer to make memes about more than anything lol

Wow

Huge numbers congrats

Potentially the only killer that will make use out of Dark Devotion, and that's extremely exciting.
