Great Idea
---
---
---
Yeah, that got me thinking. Now you can safely slug the last survivor and walk away as long as the hatch and gates are all closed. Gonna suck for the last survivor if they get on the killer's bad side.
---
What’s stopping bond and empathy from having the same result?
---
Billy still gets looped
---
ALSO VIABLE

---
If you can't find anything to do besides chasing unhook bubbles then you're just awful and need every bit of help. My suggestion is just face camp it's easier than proxy camping.
---
Huntress is also very capable same is myers. Dont overexaggerate. Also as you can See by the statistics hag does best vs. All
---
Yes, it’s actually great considering I’ve only posted a few videos and only Hag - and only started just over a week ago :) why don’t you try it and see how you do?
---

---
Um, because how else could you possibly see my post amongst the hundreds of other posts every single time? Get a life. 
---
Not sure if you’re mentally deficient? You don’t seem to click on that it’s a different video every time. Oh well. At least there will be one less hater on this forum in 15 years time eh. Good riddance, well deserved - do something nice with your life instead of stalk and hate, like a cancer to the Earth waiting to be eliminated. 😢
---
Billy &gt; Spirit &gt; Clown
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury will also help you a lot.
---
I've heard but has anything come with it? Like noticible improvements or is it just basically them saying they are going too fix it (like how they said it would be better in December and nothing came.)
---
WHY DOES NOED REWARD THE FUCKING KILLLER FOR NOT STOPPING PROGRESSION?!?1?!? MOM SHOULDNT EVEN FUCKING EXIST. THE KILLER HIT YOU AND YOU GET REWARDED??!??1?!
---
Dedicated servers meaning slightly better hitboxes. But the biggest change is 60 fps
---
&gt; Only thing I care about is don't be a dick and immediately rush back to the hook to tunnel the unhooked person.
---
haha .. no. Yell at your dumb ass teammate that decided to unhook you when the killer was still close enough to come back and get you again. 
---
Look, I try to be nice and find the person who unhooked you but if you and you're scratch marks all I see and can't immediately locate the unhooker I'm not just going to let you get away because you made up some rule that you think you're entitled to be unhooked and get away to be healed up and try again. Instead of baby raging at the killer about "tunneling" you should be babyraging at your dumb ass teammate and lack of good decisions making to unhook you when it wasn't safe to do so or not running perks\take a hit for you to be able to get away.
---
Wait there will be 60 fps? Hell I would be happy with 30 as long as it was stable.
---
I talked to him about it like 2 days ago, and he said he didn't know if they had the rights to the movies or not, so unless he got new information in the last two days, it's fake.
---
tfw your renders are better then the dev renders when it comes to marketing, lol
---
Woah, woah, don't turn this into a "fuckin' killer mains" deal. Survivors DC just as often, if not more. Killers? Well, instead of DCing, they usually facecamp the guy that set them off.
---
Still, neither will ignoring them, and ignoring them will usually make you feel a lot worse

Have one about generator placement. Meaning, don't waste your time babying a gen that's across the maps from others. Let them finish farther gens and put pressure on a cluster that are closer together. It makes end game near impossible. 
---
Have the pig talk about get surveillance here too because having surveillance on the last 3 gens being clustered means almost imminent loss
---
Same! I can imagine her terror radius sound being "Kill them, Mommy! Kill them! Don't let them get away!" Her doing Jason's voice and such, ya know?
---
It's not that it's restricted. It's more that the rights are complicated.
---
The movie franchise licensed out the mask that already existed as a Halloween costume because they hadn't come up with the killer's look yet when Wes and company were scouting locations. 
---
They found the mask in one of the homes they were looking at and called the company to work with them. 
---
Thus the movie franchise and the mask are two separate things.
---
I was just messing around I was joking hence the lmao...
---
If true, we just do not know.  The license holder decides what can and cannot be used at their preference.
---
Scream was owned by the Weinstein company. When Harvey Weinstein was convicted for sexual assault all his properties were left up in the air. Scream is in a weird situation right now.
---
Its 30 max right now. Optimization update is meant to be a stable 60 fps even on the original ps4. Not sure about the original xbox but I'd imagine it's the same deal. I think 60 is max as well though, so dont expect higher
---
I mean, sure if you let pixels from strangers affect you that badly

No aggression this is pure fucking around.

I have someone on my friend's list who only plays Trapper. I'll ask them what rank they are when I get home from work.

I have no respect for people who leave behind their teammates
---
Are you sure that was real?  I don't have a source.
---
It's like when your dad plays Mario cart with you and let's you win
---
That last one can't be stressed enough, the amount of times where I spectate my allies and they lose a chase in seconds because they're holding the camera straight in front of themselves while running around. Even at the higher ranks I see it happen all the time.

how? its just one spin around the axis. so 360
---
i apologize
---
They might be timing the launch of the new season trailer + release date with inclusion in DBD (aka May 28th). May be why they teased ghostface in DBD so much, a diversion from the bigger news.
---
Getting the rights from the movies would involve giving money to Harvey Weinstein which I doubt BHVR would do (same reason we won’t get Jeepers Creepers).
---
I wonder if this killer will be good with the huntress' perk that makes the red stain disappear
---
The guy was meant to be the one to announce it, I don't doubt that.
---
As for the Facebook post, it's now gone, so it's possible he deleted it to cover his back to avoid getting RJ Torbert in legal shit

I guess so! Thank you :)

True, i was so paranoid of being banned I disconnected my internet. Now theres people playing on the server. Risky.
---
sounds like a bunch of babies with fragile egos that can't take losing. It's not scummy as fuck gameplay, that's like saying Killers should just DC because survivors get "EZ totem cleanses" or "EZ Gens" because 1 or 2 popped before the killer got a chance to check them all. 
---
It's the killers fault you can't loop or make mistakes or that your dumb ass teammate hooked farm you after he only ran 10 feet away, so you're gonna throw a babyrage fit and DC to punish him? That's scummy as fuck gameplay right there and no different then the killer DCing because he sucks and can't catch the player looping him, or made the poor decision to not rotate off and instead tunneled someone for 5 gens and then DC's because he "know how the story plays out" toxic survivor behavior and chat after the game along with guaranteeing you'll depip with no points.

Jeff is pretty cute
---
What about the Spirit, who was literally murdered along with her mom and has only turned into the violent killer that she is today because she wants revenge on her dad who killed them both? I've always thought her backstory was the saddest.
---
I dont see why it wouldnt work.
---
Trappy boi lmaoooo autocorrect changed it
---
I mean, mental illness does exist
---
I didnt see a new head looking through the files. The outfits are numbered and I just used the latest one.
---
You're still spinning 720 degrees.
---
As a killer, I like it for the fact it pushes people out of the game when they get all gens done. As a survivor, there’s two things I don’t like. One, the timer turns seems to take the bravery right outta teammates and two, it seems like if there’s one survivor left the killers main goal is now to find the hatch and close it then just patrol the doors. Often times with noed.
---
That’s kinda rough, especially when you only had one gen left and don’t get to finish it before the hatch is found. 
---
As a killer it has been really helpful though, and I don’t try and abuse my hatch power.
---
Ohhh I see
---
"but tbagging is SoOoOoOoOO BM!"
---
They accidentally released him in the most recent update, It was only for a couple minutes
---
This also happened to me today, it was nuts and so loud the Myers that was chasing me stopped to looked around an we just sort of stood there looking at each other.
---
Then he chased me for 4 gens and then my team fumbled the rescue.
---
Still though that noise was redonk
---
As in 10-1, I typically saw a decline in the use.
---
Have you tried it with Solidarity? You can heal yourself for more than the limit with the first two skillchecks. Lol
---
That's why I play with Susie with the default knife
---
Y'know,  I have noticed that I got more than 50% on a few occasions using Autodidact, but I wasn't sure exactly why 
---
This makes sense, because using the bonus skillchecks did not give me extra
---
Honestly it might be because I'm 70:30 Killer/Survivor. My buddy got the game a bit back and I swap it up to play with him. I could just be ignorant to how others plays, tbh
---
Thanks for the love!! 😁❤️ knew there were some out there! Power to Hag the skinny legend!!  Rusty shackles for the haters 😏 that hater went onto all of my videos and disliked each one 🙄
---
I enjoy that as well when I am playing Killer, when I play I like to rough them up but in the end they realize nobody is getting hooked. That doesn't effect an entire team though, when I am survivor I try my best for the team. If it's swf I try even harder because I know them, and I want them to win.
---
Judging by leeks from awhile ago it's definetly Sidney, given "Sidney's House" being the leaked map.
---
Moon
---
If you hate the devs and DbD so much, just don't play it. You have no reason to shit on the devs cuz they have a few mechanics that you don't like.
---
Finally, a killer that speaks the survivor language. I can't wait.
---
One for killers?
---
You just made my day.
---
UwU what's this
---
&gt;:( I said be nice.
---
As funny as this is, I don't think this community is that bad. Definitely have some great memes and when someone DCs, you know why they did it. When someone teabag's, it's basically part of the game and you if you're really going to enjoy the game you have to roll with it.
---
Jeff and his perks are fine.
---
People have been arguing for ages that it's not BM. Now we are going to find out if that's true.
---
Myers main on console. I struggle to get any power in the corn to a degree that I don't bother I just slug or scare them out. I literally can stalk survivors around corners and behind objects with only a tiny glimpse of a shoulder showing and be fine but literally 1 piece of corn breaks full line of sight and nothing. It's just really unpredictable on console imo.
---
still waiting for :\~\~

---
It would be cool. Especially a token perk that gains tokens after winning a chase, and vice versa, and tokens give small bonuses to action speeds, and it would be based on how often people tried to kill her. A lot of quotes for that.
---
That's what I thought to do afterward, honestly. The Legion Downed me and left before.
---
Moniter and Abuse
---
We'll Make It -wh9ch I thought was a popular perk, but I've seen literally nobody use it in months besides me and a random P2 Quentin like 2 weeks ago.
---
Is there any news on survivors being dropped or like leaks for their perks or did we get a killer only drop? I wouldn't hate a hideous neve Campbell model
---
They really put the killer from scream in the game?
---
i agree and the alternate cosmetics are lit as well i want the red devil one for sure lol
---
Oooh, i add in Botany Knowledge instead of Buckle up, but we run almost the same healer build!    
---
Inb4 we go against The Plague and no one wants heals.
---
You're welcome❤️ And I love Rusty Shackles! And yeah I saw the comments that jealous hater made, don't let him bring you down. He obviously doesn't have a life and trying to bring him down to his low level. Quite sad really
---
Well make it is probably one of my favorite perks of all time, combined with botany knowledge it’s literally an instant heal off hook
---
I personally avoid any perks that passively speed up healing as it gives less chances for skillchecks.
---
Legit though, I hate going against any killer with Sloppy Butcher without Autodidact, so I just bring it every time now, lol. 
---
Plague hurts me on the inside though, yeah....
---
MoM is fine, NOED is fine. If NOED and MoM reward bad gameplay, then Deliverance rewards farming a player off hook and Dying Light rewards tunneling the obsession, so on. If a killer has bad gen pressure it's common sense to cleanse dulls. If NOED goes off and killer is bad it's everyone fault for allowing it to go off. The game is balanced if you think about it the right way except in ranks 13 - 20. Sure, a few things need changes, but not a lot of things do. Ranks 13 - 20 needs changes to make it not as unbalanced as killers can easily get 4ks with NOED at this rank. Hell, maybe even better game tutorials so new survivors and killers don't just get the minimum of what is needed to kill players and survive.
---
Wow you're calling me a stalker but you are the one seeing my previous posts rofl
---
Also congrats on your alt account making that comment
---
Sure makes it more belivable
---
Oh yeah, because “facecamping” is adapting. 
---
Good lord, how tilted does someone gotta be to DC if it’s not a map they like?
---
I'd have to say your translation is inaccurate. People nowadays can't take the advice and use it, they just get in their feelings and misdirect. Like you, you read my helpful comment and take it as I can't have fun and only want to win, but that is so one dimensional. All people are capable of caring about multiple things at one time, such as I who greatly appreciates the experiences of new players, but also care enough to increase their game knowledge. I also care about the truth, which is why I made it a point to correct him on the situation he was in, which in fact was not a chase at all.
---

You know i think sherlock will be the next killer
---
I’m using them right now and they are AWESOME. Do you plan on completing the set? Like the survivor icons on the bottom left while in-game, the gen icon and the like?
---
That's fair. I guess it's worth it for some people to see their monster look badass during the lobby. I usually just alt tab until the game starts though.
---
I agree about Dark Sense.Seeing the killer's location when doing gens is so useful
---
That's not holding the game hostage tho.
---
I FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED
---
There's been games where I didn't get a chance to heal anyone until end game, and then they rage out at me for running Autodidact and the "slow heals" post game, so, I also run BK to speed things up in case i don't get a chance to collect skill checks.
---
Never thought about running Bamboozle on Legion for the vault speed, I would love to test that for myself
---
Coming from someone that loves playing as and against Freddy, the *best* thing you can do to survive is to instantly run in what you believe is the opposite direction of Freddy once you're awake. Do not stop running. Take the longest route possible and do not take any shortcuts. 
---
His default power has a very short range and some Freddies will waste a lot of time trying to catch up to you and put you to sleep. Just keep running until you don't hear the Lullaby anymore. 
---
Once you are asleep, it's just a good, old fashioned game of ring-around-the-rosie until he gives up on you.
---
Amen to that
---
Object of obsession IS how I got use to the killer, I probably have the worst Death rate of any other player but as long as you have fun it doesn't matter
---
I really hope this is bait
---
Jeff's my hero
---
I thought the menu music was cool :)
---

---
MoM is not fine... M1 killers have zero counters against it and the effect simply can make killers easily lose games.
---
Adrenaline is clutch now in egc.. they like to slug then close hatch then bam adrenaline kicks in.
---
The power lasting only a few seconds in chase is long enough to do a mindgame, also don't crouch mid chase. I also made a seperate regarding that I am sure the power lasts longer when not spotted, if that is not the case then a lot of addons make no sense. IF the pwoer lasts longer outside of being spotted, then the crouching is a tool to be sneaky and get closer.
---
Yeah, first survivor I leveled up was Laurie. I brought OoO pretty much every game, and by the time I hit 50 I certainly wasn't afraid of the killers anymore haha.
---
It's no bunny Feng but I'll take it
---
nah has an survivor u either camp an exit  and wait for hatch to be cloase and dont look for the hatch or run around looking it you dont sneak to it anymore
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
there no reason not run looking for the hatch since even if killer sees you he cant grab you anymore if ur looking for it you should run not sneak
---
the only advantage killer has over survivor is the extra Movespeed
---
your solo cause the killer managed to kill ur team, the hatch is their to give u a chance, its not hard to escape from it really like i said gives u 7k points
---
the stakes are did u find the hatch before killer thats it
---
We should have a cop killer
---
I would much rather an all black version of this than the default one. It’s perfect
---
Obvious bait try harder next time
---
he can play with you and have his way until the timer runs out, how is he not holding me hostage? i will die after 5-6 minutes but he still has full power over me for no reason.
---
Bruh that's some bullshit.
---
When it didn't quite work, his folks they just quit.
---
But Danny took a look inside of it.
---
I got a survivor saying they were a killer main, my Micheal is only level 11.
---
I've been told, (Im paraphrasing  a little) "Just a tip, if you tunnel less you'll get more kills"
---
I was not even tunneling, I was literally just killing whoever was right in front of me.
---
They proceeded to deny that I was rank 1 before, told me that since I wasn't rank 1 this month my opinion doesn't matter and on top of all that claims to be a killer main. The fact they didnt see my achievement for getting rank 1 killer was quite baffling to me, its one of my first achievements. Its right there in my profile, I dont see how they would miss it.
---
I got 2 kills that match. TBH felt pretty good about it considering I only had 3 perks slots, enduring, thanatophobia and play with your food against 2 toolboxes.
---
I know, he comments on every single one of my posts! So strange! Can’t imagine living like that 😂 Thanks again! If you ever post your gameplay send me it I love watching Hag too!! ❤️
---
IF YOU PLAY LEGION AND DOWNED A DWIGHT THEN YOU SHOULD FEEL ATTACKED
---
Did I say facecamping was them adapting? Sorry, I meant facecamping was their alternative to DCing. I'm trying to argue that you should not lump this down to a "killer mains versus survivor mains" post. Survivors DC all the time just because they get caught first, while killers DC for maps like Haddonfailed or Lery's. People DC on both sides just because of a rough start, not just killers.
---
it isnt, happend in 3 back to back games
---
There are definitely games where you don't get any tokens until the end, and in most cases I simply leave or don't bother to heal if I don't have at least 2 tokens by then. But, being a situational perk, it is *great* in its situations. 
---
Against a Plague? Yeah. Cry and use your tears to fill up the fountains you'll use to heal yourself. Don't count on healing others very often though. I don't up against Plague often, but I accept the fact that I won't get much healing done unless someone is slugged.
---
NO DISRESPECT BUT YOU STILL WANT NERF? HAVE YOU SEEN NURSE?
---
Just last week a killer watched me bleed out instead of hooking me until he finally picked me up at the last second to hook me in basement and taunt me. He then said I deserved it cause I tried to gen rush when there was bps? We had done 2 gens btw, and in that time he moried my 3 other teammates so that now is considered gen rushing too! I had the privilege of receiving a variety of insults for trying to survive, it was a wild ride
---
LET ME FUCKING KOBE JUST BECAUSE IM THE LAST ALIVE DOESNT MEAN I DON'T DESERVE A CHANCE GAME FFS
---
how is it a bait? 3 games in a row people had to deal with this nonsense.
---
I don't have any friends PepeHands
---
Good to know ty
---
Just deal with it and move on. Not every game is like this
---
How can they carry you for 5 minutes before you wiggle free?
---
If you play PC and have Discord you ca add me and we'll test it out

---
I once got called a camper for staying next to a gen as doctor.
---
Hostage means no way of leaving the game i.e. bodyblock so you can't move and you can't be sacrificed. The collapse will kill you so it's not hostage.
---
I cant tell if your being sarcastic
---
Was really helpful when the last gen gets popped you see the killers aura for 10 secs even if you didn't do that last gen.
---
Very helpful in seeing what exit gate the killer is going to.
---
doors are closed, he drags you in the middle of the map and follows you. hatch is closed and cant be opened. how do you win? you cant shake him off either, skratchmarks
---
I laughed way to hard.  This is why I stay sub'd.
---
Because after the timer runs out you're in the lobby. That's not holding the game hostage. Holding the game hostage is like blocking survivor in the basement not killing them. Where the only way to go back to the lobby is quitting. One you get penalized for, the other you don't.
---
They look like the Fantana girls
---
You're right, she had new hair. Ill upload it.
---
If you're gonna go for a garbage save you better just body block.
---
Oh, because treatment cutoff makes endgame go faster? Haven’t played doctor yet after eg..
---
Holy shit, re-watching the Paulie footage, I think I was right, he's got permanent stealth while unseen.
---
holding me hostage for any amount of time is **STILL** holding me hostage. only because i die after 5 minutes doesnt change the fact that i cant move or play in any meaningful way.
---
Thats politics for you as well. Ive had my fair share of being no positions friend.
---
I adore this
---
Care to explain how? New killer sounds like fun.
---
Only killer, i saw no new survivor or map
---
escaping gives them 5k though points that the huge part of the objective the hatch is just an means to exit the map 
---
realistically it should give the same amount or less then opening a exit gate cause thats harder to then just finding a hatch solo (not that saying nerf the points just pointing the points dont measure the objective difficulty at all)
---
so using it in that light is a means of escape so it should give more points doesn't really make sense since escaping through the gates solo is much harder to do and that gives less
---
Completely wasted opportunity to give Tapp Officer Earls uniform.
---
Word. Feels like a missed opportunity honestly.
---
I guess they can’t make ghostface like this for technical problem, also bunny hoodie feng-Ming’s cosmetic doesn’t release for same problem.
---
It does. There was a very brief moment i saw in Pauiles Ghostface video where the power didnt go down since he was  hiding. Now if it goes down while stalking i dont know. 
---
He can crouch much faster then pig though, its like a survivor crouch
---
Amazing! Will you be doing the devil outfit too? :)
---
it shouldnt be happening at all, fix is easy too. if the last survivor gets knocked the fuck out he should die RIGHT AWAY to the endgame collapse.
---
Explain what? It looks like one of the cakes from Nailed It🍰
---
Run it with Detective's Hunch and get all the information!
---
I remember the automatic bot patch message maker that mentioned fixing the issue of the pig refusing to get pregnant.
---
We need a assless chaps and shirtless doctor.
---
I'm so in love with these cosmetics, thanks for posting!
---
I WAS PLAYING MYERS TODAY, BUT I DID THAT EXACT THING. IN MY DEFENCE THOUGH, THE SURVIVORS WERE BEING WALNUTS.
---
Uh bruv if you get knocked down and die right away thats unfair cause the survivor could still crawl to the door and escape lmao
---
Absolutely stunning post, just the attitude I like to see towards newer players.
---
I’m English, so I love to make a nice warm cup of tea, which calms me down, and sit watching some gameplay on YouTube or a stream. So maybe make a nice hot drink you like? :) I recently started uploading killer videos too so I sometimes just create thumbnail art which is therapeutic to me. :)
---
I don't know the details, but there is at least one video out there that shows you how specifically for this patch. 
---
Google is your best friend
---
I personally prefer Alert but it has its uses

This might be one of the best moris

Sidney!
---
This is literally not what taking the game hostage is.
---
Yes they are holding you hostage for a limited amount of time, but it’s not reportable as you will eventually die and leave the game.
---
I had 2 survivors earlier that had 3 gen themselves and refused to touch any of them. Went around the map for over 10 minutes and finally found them both walking in and out of the same few lockers over and over. Now that’s annoying and holding the game hostage.

---
you still make the timer a part of the discussion which it shouldnt be. in your scenario you could unplug your internet cable for 5 seconds and end up in the lobbyscreen.
---
read the post again, both doors are locked and hatch is closed, how can you escape?
---
If it is fake, I still believing Sidney come in as survivor.
---
PLEASE
---
You don’t win. You wait less than 2 minutes to be sacrificed by the entity while the killer watches if they want.
---
A big strong boi will die like anyone else if you stick him with a pointy thing.
---
yes it is, getting involuntarily controlled by an outside influence is the exact definition of being a hostage. just because the collapse adds a timer to that doesnt change the fact that you are helpless for 6 minutes
---
it shouldnt be happening at all
---
Detention rules, bitch.
---
Lmaoooo this is hilarious
---
Crouching itself doesnt get rid of his TR or Red Stain, thats his Stealth power which is on a timer bar like Legion.
---
Yeah I know but I thought people couldn’t get in games with him
---
But you will eventually die. Why can’t you grasp that?
---
Is face camping a survivor with Leatherface with the chainsaw in their face taking them hostage? Because it’s the same scenario you’re describing. No chance of escape and forced to wait it out.
---
I see flaw in your gameplay. Add me on discord I can help. I'm not that good either I haven't played in awhile but as and I can help shadow or I can stop by and help
---
!Slaying#4200
---
i didnt justify any of these things you mentioned. so your salty opinion is out of place. 
---
getting held hostage in ANY case shouldnt be possible.
---
I see, I see
---
You are such a claudettehead.
---
It’s not holding the game hostage if the game ends in 2 minutes
---
What Font do you use?
---
Qt
---
for the sake of an argument.  lets say facecamping is part of the game. i have multiple options, i can wait it out and let my team do gens or i can kill myself. with the scenario i pointed out there is no hope of survival, there is no gameplay advantage for my teammates ( they are dead) there is absolutely NOTHING of value going on.
---
Hunny, don’t judge an entire community because of one bad member
---
Because you clearly dont knwo how to play to avoid that.
---
I think you can make the same version of "behind you" for killer. People tend to always destroy pallets, knowing which ones are not safe pallets for survivors is important, but also realizing a survivor is abandoning the area where he just threw a pallet is more. If you can tell they just ran away after throwing a pallet (that is not blocking you) is better just going around it normally.
---
As killer knowledge is power. Knowing where people are and what they are doing (BBQ and whispers) is very important. You don't go after the guy running you just spot with BBQ, go to the one doing the gen. But also, you don't chase people into the chapel/ironworks/coal tower. Stubborness is what stands out in bad killers. It's easy to recognize them because they don't hit people body blocking them, they stack bloodlust, they chase *that good looping survivor* the entire game instead of spreading the love, etc. You can run thanatophobia or sloppy as a mean to demonstrate how you build up pressure on a team instead of tunnel vision on someone.
---
 
---
But to be honest, the best advices you can give to someone in terms of killing efficiency tend to get them called sweaty. For example that actually hooking people you just downed is not always the best thing to do and slugging can be very effective.
---
So this isn't in the PTR or anything I'm guessing. I'm curious how you were able to play a match with him. Is it just because both of you had the update that had him selectable or was it something else?
---
Thats what i could tell from gameplay anyway we could be wrong. 
---
So bascally..you want to use Hunt, Crouch to hide, stalk someone but time it right so you cna sneak up on them to hit them out of it as they are expoded and not be seen.
---
&gt; 1) Keep the survivors off of generators! (Hag says: My perk "Hex: Ruin" causes survivors to ignore generators until the totem is cleansed.)
---
lel
---
Man this sub is just full of killer mains. I agree with you completely. NoEd was good even back in the day, now It's way too strong. Telling people to just cleanse dull totems is ridiculous. MAYBE back in the day it was fine, but it takes a long time to find all 5 totems now. Trying to coordinate a team that you can't talk to in order to find them all? Impossible. It's a blatantly overpowered perk that punishes survivors for basically winning the game. It's so easy for a killer to go from 1 kill to 4 with this endgame system combined with noed. I don't understand how all these people can possibly defend it, even when purely looking at it from the perspective of "does this provide fun and enjoyable gameplay" the answer is no.
---
not true, he can knock you down and prolong the game.
---
Ok but for real though I really appreciate these high effort non-meme posts. More guides like these will always get an upvote from me!
---
doesnt make any sense, if you are trying to troll me it doesnt work.
---
Roboto
---
Still, the timer will end at some point and that only adds like 10-30 seconds to the timer. Not that long
---
I suggest that the timer simply moves much quicker if you are the last person alive and you get slugged. That way the game ends faster and everyone is happy.
---
Would love if they implemented some kind of counter for this. I was thinking last night that I wish they purposely had a way to forfeit the game. Not DC cause that’s no fun for anyone (losing BP and items, ruining the game for your team), but a forfeit button that lets you die straight away, that way killer still gets points and you can move on to your next game.
---
The main thing is to never take advantage of bad survivor decisions. Tunneling is tunneling even if the unhooked survivor is self caring behind a rock in a corner and you have Nurse's Calling.
---
I faced a Legion yesterday who got that spot and I only found it because I went up there for the chest. I'd say it's a pretty good one overall though as you'd only go up there for the chest or to loop.
---
I'm not trlling

---
I JUST GOT TUNNELED LONG ENOUGH FOR ALMOS 4 GENS TO GET DONE!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD UNDERSTAND WHEN IT'S TIME TO END A CHASE YOU COMPLETE MORON! THE ONLY REASON I EVEN GOT DOWN WAS BECAUSE THE HORRIBLE LAG FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH ME
---
And read what other people been commenting been telling you. Or stay one minded. I'm done here.
---
Clearly a bug.
---
&gt;MoM requires you to get hit 3 times for it to go off. If you don't, too bad so sad, it ain't going off
---
How do you kill survivors without hitting them 3 times... Every hooking requires at least 2 hits. You must down them 3 times, thats 6 hits. 
---
I am an average survivor and against me, even Billy and Huntress can't reliable use their M2, unless they waste a shitload of time waiting for the opportunity while being looped. 
---
Every other killer just needs to eat MoM because they are basic M1 characters.
---
So you want to make a killer that has 12% survivor run speed, stops pallet looping entirely with his perk, uses doesn't have any vision at a certain point and can be spotted cross map because of how tall he is?
---
Legion 2.0 here we come.
---
Seriously, this game needs a forfeit button that requires majority vote of survivors still alive, so if you are last survivor, you don't have to deal with this nonsense.
---
Haha superwom-min
---
Survivor and map doesn't have to mean they are the movie ones. They might just have the rights to the mask/character from the show.
---
The map can just loosely reference one of the movie locations to avoid any legal problems, the survivor could be an OC created by them.
---
I never thought I would agree more with that kind of statement.
---
At this point I just dc if they slug me at egc. I don't care about the bloodpoints or pips I just want to play the game. I'm not about to sit here and wait for 4 minutes while the timer slowly runs out. Hopefully the devs come up with a solution for this fast.
---
Yeah, I kinda saw this coming and voice disapproval, but everyone was too caught up with "it will solve survivors taking game hostage" :/
---
My entire team just got slugged because the killer was mad we wouldn't farm with him. Some killers just love to slug. :(
---
Better than nothing.
---
Lol oh fuck this oughta be good.
---
Community isn't that bad. I don't play fortnite anymore but back when I used to play it no one would be toxic to each other, maybe that was because I mostly played it before it got really popular buy I don't find the community that bad
---
&gt;you wait till theres only 2 players left to hook the guy with MoM
---
I feel like you are baiting after this reply.
---
You can't know which survivors have MoM.
---
It absolutely has everything to do with this. The reason everyone complained is because it was **wasting their time.** Now that the tables are turned and a killer is wasting the last survivor's time with this shit, all of the sudden it is not a problem. K
---
Get your nuance out of here. CHASE BAD CAMP BAD KILLER BAD. Seriously though...yes, the chase was poorly done, but camping was the right move. I feel bad for the killer in a way. The margin for error gets so thin against good survivors.
---
The perks are really op
---
I'm mostly against prestige in dbd but Ghostfaces bloody clothes seem like they're going to look awesome
---
The problem is that they get full kill credit, so there's really no incentive for them to hunt you down other than Camp the exit gate. If you've invested enough time and one exit gate and the killer knows, you're doomed. And since the killer doesn't have to actively seek you out, he can just guard the exit and wait for the entity to kill you. I think the culmination of match should provide pressure and urgency to both sides.
---
I do often DC on Legion matches.  I just did about an hour ago tbh.
---
Killers: Are an unstoppable force meant to be as strong as four fit adrenaline fueled humans. Able to break large pallets of reinforced wood and nails by simply kicking it twice and can easily lift more than 200lbs (see Jane) with one hand as if they were nothing.
---
Also killers: Takes 30 seconds to flip a piece of metal closed.
---
The point is to prevent survivors from hiding around the map for as long as they want. 
---
Being slugged for roughly 5 minutes you know the match will be over in that amount of time. Before EGC, survivors could stay in the trial for undetermined time.
---
Sidney is practically required. We were already cheated out of Sally
---
It absolutely is free real estate
---
And a free chunk of objective points to me. ;D
---
My friend mains Kate and sometimes her hair glitches and stretches across the map it's hilarious.
---
Love the EGC and the new hatch mechanic.
---
Now when I get hatch I know I earned it instead of just waiting it out/knowing the killer can't stop me from leaving unless he willing to wait longer then I am.
---
And reverse, I'm glad that now if I know where the hatch is an I get there before the survivor does, I can just close that bad boy an go check on my doors. 
---
It keeps things in a better rhythm, I feel.
---
New Legion is awesome, much better then before but not great. A solid C+ or B.
---
But does it *work underwater?*
---
Can I get a reason? Frank’s and moonwalking is non existent and Legion isn’t boring and broken now
---
Slugging was a thing before this and its a thing after. Its no different. They slug so you cant get to the hatch.
---
Stop being a salty survivor main saying 'they only care about killers' because they dont.
---
I’m not trolling. Haha. I seriously didn’t know. Shows you how much I use the map.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWNBmjyv7Y
---
Lmao its worthless unless its rainbow
---
Its going to happen because its new. They want to see the new anmation. Once it passes they will stop cause they know its pointless.
---
It do tho
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They've changed the game from a variety of possible outcomes to 2 solid outcomes an 1 slight chance.
---
Either 5 gens will get done and people will escape or 5 gens will not get done an no one will escape.
---
Then there's the slight little chance the last survivor standing MAY escape if they're LUCKY.
---
Which, honestly, is ok IMO.
---
Part of the reason I love playing as pig is teabagging toxic survivors. Before seeing this I was intrigued about ghostface but now I know I need to get him
---
Kindred is great for solo survivor
---
Alert, Botany Knowledge, agitation and rancor imo are really good yet underrated
---
Hatch standoffs sucked and EGC looks cool I’m very happy
---
Correctly, you would go for the chest or to loop but still it's in the corner so if you are in a chase chances are you won't look and for the chest even maybe you won't look either. It was a nice surprise as placement. And as you can see in the 2nd screenshot it was Devour and it's still there, almost maxed :)
---
But that is the first time i have EVER seen that
---
No problem. I love Spine Chill as it is, all the new Ghostface players will make the perk even better when the new chapter comes..
---
Pony man, this hurts to look at an I can't even comprehend what your trying to do here.
---
New System Concept to help diversify the Survivors more, as well as customize the progression more, and cut out perk categories you might want to avoid.
---
"This just in; Florida man tries to cosplay video game gang "The Legion." Takes selfie on his flip phone, and is immediately shot by 6 white riot officers and a blue Crocodile. Alligators-I MEAN investigators are looking into the reason the man sounded white under all that black clothing. A hate demonstration indeed."
---
Only those who are guilty will get offended.
---
Wouldn't that be a good scenario? Like two people not doing gens?
---
No clue. I was referencing "The Witch"
---
Mori someone in the next match. Only use green and yellow Moris though
---
I agree the nerf was unneeded. I assume it was for a "Everyone else is dead, survivor isn't obsession, you close hatch and it'll take too long to open the gate" situation but that is very situational. (And if you devote a perk slot, why shouldn't you get the advantage?) For normal-gameplay the collapse only starts once the door is actually open, be it survivor or killer who opens one of the gates so why  nerf it.
---
Does the killer see you like that?
---
Self heal is bad m'kay. Dude you did your best so gg.
---
Don’t listen to them. Use whatever addons you want cause this probably won’t be the 1st time it happens to you
---
Why give up? Get those struggle points.
---
No I can see that, but I can't read it lol
---
I will sure as hell tbag
---
TCM2 is hilarious. It’s a dark comedy, not much like the original. But I think it was the right call to go the opposite direction as the original is lightning in a bottle. Can’t be topped.
---
Very impressive😂
---
pure gold
---
That's a cool system!
---
One thing I had brought up, which many people disagreed with when I brought it up but I still stand by, but its based around the EGC timer.
---
Basically, the timer is 1 minute 30 seconds at base, 3 minutes if someone is downed or hooked. For every survivor no longer in the match, 30 seconds are added onto the timer, 1 minute if someone is downed or hooked. That way a group of 4 survivors only have 1 minute and 30 seconds to get out, making it more stressful but definetly possible. But one survivor has 3 minutes to escape, still leaving it stressful, but making it possible if killer closes hatch
---
That's the mind of rank 20s lol
---
I really don't know,but i think yes.
---
you know what? no
---
Mte whenever I see a pink haired Nea i know she’s a bad bitch
---
They better not make it like amanda's crouch and there's time in between each teabag.
---
Stupid question: I thought all this time that multiple survivors on a single generator was an overall faster method. What's the speed penalty? I always join people on generators because I thought it was faster.
---
The Feng skin....why do they hate her so much 😖
---
That's good because he's getting the permits to use that as a new treatment.
---
occasionally a similar thing happens to a downed Survivor when a different down Survivor gets picked up somewhere else. The survivor not getting picked up will levitate in the air like he is
---
The gave them a rework, it's too much to type out as it was a ground up over haul, check the patch notes it's all on there.
---
But basically, 115 standard movement speed, longer frenzy duration, if you miss a frenzy attack it ends the frenzy, cannot use frenzy until entire duration fills back up, Slightly slower frenzy speed,  and I think that's just about it besides a complete Add On overhaul as well.
---
The patch notes explain it much better then I ever could.
---
"Jake, what the fu-- OH shit!"
---
It actually hurt me to make this
---
There's literally no point in playing Springwood as killer. It's a loss every time against semi competent survivors. There is usually 3 God pallets on that map, the school infinite, the basement house jungle gym and the two story house loop/jungle gym, and that's not even mentioning the amount of other pallets on the map. 
---
The survivors have to be on the next level of potatos to allow the killer to pip
---
Yeah you move slower and it'll take longer to tier 3. There are tells
---
Well, complaining to the devs and saying that they're shit and their game is shit also isn't nice.
---
Wait? Links? Data mined? Wut
---
Did you read the post
---
No, from the loading screen. With the new update the game ends if someone DCs in the loading screen, and that happened twice in a row. Seemed too coincidental to me.
---
As a killer who plays Survivior, Noed is bullshit
---
The Jane Train
---
They just look at me.
---
Real fun, huh?
---
There's a spirit, I think
---
&gt;hide behind gens
---
Physically obscures. Does not hide aura. 
---
&gt; get in a locker
---
Don't always have time/Lockers are trash. 
---
&gt;Distortion
---
Garbage perk
---
&gt;Sole Survivor (this one is trash but still somewhat a counter
---
Still a garbage perk.
---
I guess tier 3 madness prevents survivors from opening the gates too?
---
It is technically faster, but not as fast as if you were on two generators. Basically, if one survivor is repairing a generator, he operates at 100% efficiency. Each additional survivor lowers the efficiency by 10% on each survivor. This means that two survivors on a generator will repair at 180% of the speed of a single survivor. 3 survivors will be 240%, and 3 survivors will be 180%. If one survivor is repairing the gen without any effects (toolboxes, Thanatophobia, etc.) it will take 80 seconds to complete. If two survivors, it will take 44.4 seconds to complete. While this is faster, it means it takes 88.8 seconds to complete two generators if both survivors work together the whole time, versus 80 seconds if they split up. [You can read more about it here.] You'll notice the efficiency decrease because your repair progress bar will be red and an icon will be above it. Dwight's perk Prove Thyself lessens the effect (removing it entirely if two survivors). (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators#Efficiency_Penalty)
---
I don't know if it's as common on ps4 because I don't run into it too much or I'm just lucky. But that perk does mess me up if under some circumstances like if everyone had it. But really if at least one of the survivors is still in the dream world then they usually can lead me to their friends while I still have NOED so still work out. 
---
But I do play Freddy in a very risk/reward kind of way. Adrenaline could mess my day up but if they don't have it I've laid a super cool trap for the survivors to fall into.  I like knowing every game is pretty much going to be amazing victory or humiliating defeat. It's why I still run blood warden, 9/10 times it's a wasted perk slot but every once and a while you get an overconfident survivor tbagging by the gates after you just hooked their buddy and it's so satisfying to see them realize they can't run away at the last second.
---
You couldn't actually queue up into a game with him, it'd kick you out.
---
On the plus side, you can now tunnel your obsession without them healing and get max stacks
---
The legion always reminded me of someone from the purge or the strangers.
---
So I main spirit and did not know this.
---
Jesus Christ, reading that was something else. Sorry you had to deal with such toxicity.
---
YOU DID MENTION NURSE BUT IT'S IRRELEVANT BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSE.
---
Yeah thats what I thought I just wanted to know what perk it represented
---
Attention-whore-ey
---
Another question. Is there rank-based matchmaking?
---
Freddy/Legion
---
I'm sure he will. After all, it is probably just a night job.
---
If you’re on PS4 it’s because the add on literally hasn’t worked in a year.
---
Yes, but its kinda trash. You get people around your rank if they arent swf
---
Dang man tellin' you bout them generators man,  dang ol sparks of lightnin' coming an' dang ol shocking like "Woo Woo", man, gotta take a little, dang ol', ace in the hole man dang ol' immersion man, gotta get them items man dang ol', urban evasion man
---
Makes sense. I’m not a great killer, (17), so the add-on was a waste once I found a game with a 6. Great matchmaking.
---
thats teh point
---
Yea just keep playing man. I see you’re playing myers, so go pick up monitor from the shrine if you havent already, its amazing on him. Also, if you want perks, my build is spirit fury (spirit), enduring (billy), monitor(doctor), and bbq (bubba). Maybe ruin if im having a bad day
---
Not you, Fred
---
Thanks. I actually did get Monitor for its... interesting application with Myers.
---
LMAO 😂
---
Is this on Xbox?  I'm pretty sure I've killed this person before lol.
---
&gt;This wall of text just to complain about NOED?
---
***Salt/Rant*** read tags my duud
---
&gt;Just cleanse the 5 dull totems. Use Small Game
---
You can't track how many totems are left, how many your teamates have done, and wasting a perk slot for the slight chance the killer is enough of a douche to run noed is pretty fucking dumb
---
&gt;Comparing NOED, a perk with many direct counters with MoM, a perk that has ZERO counters. Sums up how much you understand about the game. 
---
Didn't say noed was worse than MoM, it's not but it's still utterly broken, your logic about countering noed is the same logic as my MoM counter, assume they have it and use a ivory before they get 3 hits.
---
&gt;Bloodlust wasn't added because of pallets, it was added because of infinites. Just because bad killers enjoy bloodlusting at every pallet, doesn't mean this is the purpose of said mechanic.
---
When survivors got sprint burst back while running and every jungle gym had 2 pallets pretty much everything was an infinite.
---
I need them both, they're so amazing!
---
It was fine for a while until they reverted the lighting changes for some reason.
---
Real talk, that'd be kind of a nice homage.
---
Lol you hurt his feelings pointing out the flaws :P little boy wants to cry now
---
Id prioritize bbq first if you haven’t already, and go watch vids on how to run tiles effectively. Other than that best of luck man, see you in the fog!
---
Another thing for killers is if the surviver keeps running around the same object just keep chasing them DO NOT go back and forth on that object just keep going in a circle you will catch up unless you are quick enough with your movements to catch them beforehand
---
TAPP COSMETICS
---
You would think.
---
Lol how is it any different than survivors hanging at the exit gate and teabagging? Killers deal with that EVERY game. Just now it's killer that gets to waste the same amount of time instead... 
---
4 games in a row is nothing.
---
Same but it still looks kinda sick. My personal favorite is the red but w the white mask.
---
You’re right! I forgot about that. I just always thought of Crotus Prenn as Clown’s map. Forgot he shared it.
---
Nerfs? The end game is super annoying and unfair for survivors.  Killers just fuck with you and keep you downed instead of hooking if you're the last survivor. The timer is way too quick for a survivor to open the gate, and the killers can find you easily before you get the chance to open it. 
---
The hatch  standoffs  used to be annoying too, nut they were annoying for both. The end game is just annoying for the survivor.
---
We got absolutely crushed and I genuinely don't know what else I could've done other than bring unbreakable. He just slugged us all within 5 minutes and let us bleed out.
---
You kind of didnt read what I said did you? Killers will come to my gen, they kick it look around and leave. I then go back and finish the gen. When I play killer the immersive ones are the ones who escape and irk me. They hide like it's a art. People who think they will loop me forever get caught faster. I think that's why you see people talking about the 4 man immersive squadette teams. You dont find them.
---
I’m hyped for both.
---
It's only a "nerf" to assholes who farm people
---
Calm Spirit
---
Except I don't do that, so bringing me into your toxic spiral ain't helping. Why should I suffer because someone else was a jackass? Go mori them.
---
Would be fitting if they made a Freddy pillow.
---
It's totally just as realistic as the rest of them. Even if you wanted to stay true to the lore both the alien and predator have been on earth at all kinds of points. They even have subterranean predators that live underground and dont use fancy tech.
---
Oink
---
Cry
---
I'm ok with this.
---
Red &amp; green are inherently the best "tiers"
---
Only Jane has both red &amp; green
---
That's a lot of thicness for meta survivors
---
Whispers. its the best perk for killer in the game if you know how to use it.
---
Your personal favorite is what I decided I wanted my customization to be when I got him that's cool. I'm not into the devil mask but I dig the red and black poncho look.
---
They did?
---
Just Rank 20 things.
---
Yeah, Auras used to be the same opacity at any distance for like a month after Ch10.
---
Ya the devil mask is hella overhyped
---
There was a great big flash, everything just changed.
---
His molecules got all rearranged
---
Wow. Did they even think gor a second maybe you didnt have self care? *face palms*
---
I was hesitant at first because I'm not a big fan of reaction type videos, but this dude had some funny shit in there by the second minute, lol. 
---
Perhaps in the future, I can do something similar.
---
sounds like it worked since all gens got done and almost everyone escaped so well done. her own fault for wasting so much time on you like that
---
ps if you wanna know another annoying strat that will really give idiot killers a hard time, play with a friend against a killer with toth and another totem. you stand at one, friend on the other. spam a totem and hide then when you hear a TR have your friend spam the other one. had a killer waste 3 gens going back and fourth between them like that(and the funny part is that when one finally got cleansed it was HG, not devour. take that, totem guarding spirit!)
---
Dewey and Gale ... yeah but it would be silly to choose them over Sydney. 
---
Fingers crossed for Syd.
---
Try this strategy with No Mither + Resilience + Saboteur + Exhaustion perk with a Commodious Toolbox + sabo add-ons.
---
I really like reading the journal entries from Benedict Baker. Would be cool if they ever made him a survivor
---
No better
---
Yeah, I also wonder if he's going to get a more ghostly outfit (the black drapey robe and such) as normally attributed with him, and his current outfit is just a placeholder until they get the details worked out.  Right now he kinda looks too Medieval/Assassins Creedy.
---
The entity feeds off hope, just killing them straight out would not be a very good output of hope. And I'm guessing from a lore standpoint the entity does the egc to prevent survivors from thinking they can just be cocky and bully the killer with no repercussions
---
Our community is almost as bad as Fortnite's... that's saying something...

That's all gameplay though.

I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYBODY THINKING THE LEAK WAS A MISTAKE. F.R.E.E ADVERTISEMENT. HOW CAN ANYONE BE SO GULLIBLE? THEY HAVE ONLY DONE THIS AT LEAST 10X NOW AND EVERYBODY STILL BITES LIKE ITS A NEW THING TO HAPPEN
---
Pretty sure what he has is staying cause I don't think they got the licenses for it
---
It helps killers *tremendously* because it pressures survivors  to leave before they're able to rescue anyone on the hook. It also helps because the killer usually is the first one to find the hatch, and solo survivor has no other chance (good luck opening the gate without someone  distracting the killer ). There's just not enough time to even do it in two phases (opening halfway then hiding) as the killer will know this is the door you're going for and can just camp there. If you go for the other door, you've run out of time.
---
It do be like that.
---
It’s just a game people 🙄
---
Can we pin this?
---
This post doesn't quite meet the level that is on that subreddit.
---
what is wrong with you?
---
You do whatever you want lol doesn't make you any less trash eh
---
Np
---
I'm pretty sure in their universe the survivors don't see a timer over their head or think "I should mess with the killer a bit before getting out". They want to escape asap and by any means. It still makes no sense for the entity to bypass the hook ritual.
---
But of course, I am not a developer. this is just some fan concept from which at much devs would take ideas from.
---
Now if somehow Devs said "Hey I like this let's make this giant killer", he would end up having 1 good perk,  maybe 1 decent one and 1 or 2 weak ones.
---
But are you sure they are OP:
---
1.- Stop pallet looping is something people have been wanting from so much time ago, as far as I remember it was considered an exploit, so getting rid of it is by no means OP.
---
2.- How many times you manage to hit a survivor on the face? then add to it that the instadown happens only 1/4 times. the rest of it is pretty much useless. Not to mention survivors can adapt to it, if you see the killer appearing in fron of you just turn your back and get hit on the side at least.
---
3.-Items are kinda overkill, a lot of survivors play without them anyway. Anyway:
---
medkits: they are the most balanced item, to be fair. but with stuff like instaheals, they become broken as well.
---
Flashlights: They can really make a killer's life miserable. So sharing that pain is fair.
---
Tool boxes: Gen repair speed is already fast enough.
---
Of course it would suck for new players, but even then, items are not really needed. This one is the one that tyo me is the most OP.
---
Best explaination is think of a myers stalk ability crossed with pigs crouch and can lean and peek around corners
---
Should be coming tomorrow. I'm getting advice from a few other users here, as obviously graphic design is not my strong suit, and I want to make the next one a little easier to read and more aesthetically pleasing.
---
Yep which is totally fine. Not all killers are dicks.
---
the entity has decided that masturbating with tears is much more enjoyable than eating emotions or whatever
---
"I can explain the hole in the back"
---
I will go home and play a few rounds of basement bubba and when they all get salty in the post game lobby, I will drop a link to this thread.
---
The Entity is basically a toxic killer, it feeds on your Salt.
---
*doing gens, you?*
---
Its handsdown the best perk IMO for myers, just wait until you get a lerys offering with scratched mirror, theres so many ways to play myers
---
Today I had a game where all of the survivors rushed the hooks. They were surprised I didn't go check gens or something with all 4 of then on my screen. Obv I'm gonna camp hook but I'm toxic for that apparently.
---
Clap cheeks with a build like that.
---
The Ghost can move stealthily, crouch, lean around corners and stalk Survivors.
---
His primary power is Shrouded Hunt during which: The Ghost has no terror radius.
---
His secondary power is Stalk: The Ghost can stalk individual Survivor to give the exposed status for a limited time. The Ghost also has the ability to crouch freely and lean around corner while stalking.

Thank you!(:
---
... how does that look like Adam
---
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in hook
---
i tried to be really nice about it
---
Indeed, one shouldn't compose titles @ 2a.m. Do you have anything better?
---
Debatable but I understand.
---
I think they won't do that because ,in the past ,to get (alert as example) you needed to unlock this survivor(Feng), or wait for this perk in shrine. Many people buy this dlcs only for this perks. Now we will get all perks without buying dlcs? All we know about bhvr love to money, and we know that they won't do that!
---
Non stop do gens. Must do more gens and faster.  I ways run a perk to know when a killer is looking or coming my direction anyway.
---
I made a killer you can check it out if u want
---
Good advice is when you drop a pallet don’t wait on the killer to move first 9/10 I’m going to feint like I’m going around the side to get you to jump the pallet and so far I always connect a hit with this tactic.
---
In my experience, killers just use the extra time to farm you. Down, pick up and drop until you get back up again then down again. Then the timer runs out and you are taken by the entity
---
I think this is a screenshot from a larger gameplay video
---
I really wanted a high school map ;-;
---
The Entity keeps both the survivors and killers suspended permanently in these "between realms" and constantly sends them from trial to trial. I highly doubt it has a problem maintaining a trial so the only reason for the collapse is the entity arbitrarily deciding to do it.  The Entity is supposed to feed through the hook ritual so I still don't understand bypassing it just to make sure survivors are on their best behavior.
---
&amp; all console survivors suddenly forgot how to read
---
Looks like the shoe's on the other foot and the perpetrator has become the victim. How does that humble pie taste?
---
No, I do. I am not surprised at all. I have been playing since the start and mained killer for a while back when there was no bloodlust, vacuum pallets were everywhere and infinite jungle gyms on farm were a nightmare. I still play killer even now. That doesn't make me think ANY differently. I am not strolling around taking out my pent up rage on other people who didn't do shit, so pardon me if I don't agree with it.
---
Thank you for saying this! Grinds my gears to see it. Unless you have to, like for a camper, do not save as the killer walks away.
---
Oh why the nipple, pls cover up the hag sag
---
Oh how the turn tables...
---
Oh I just had no sound so I couldn't tell
---
Poised. When Jane came out everyone I knew was so focused on Head On, then they asked why I don't use it. Well, 10 seconds of no scratch marks per gen popped.
---
Saved my ass many times during a chase.
---
He’s a black man
---
You mean 'tables have turned'.
---
Agreed. I think most DbD players aren't really true genre fans....This proves it. hahaha
---
When he first woke up he had realized, he had snow white hair
---
and glowin green eyes
---
Yup
---
pray
---
Are you accidentally hitting the touch pad? That toggles the inverted camera.
---
Underrated perk. 
---
This would have single-handedly made his build (Infectious Fright reliant) pretty useless. 
---
If OP had brought Calm Spirit, then he'd only have to deal with a giant terror radius, which really only serves to give you a bigger heads up for when to run.
---
Very good and way less blunt than I'd be, though thats probably for the best.
---
"If you're using Self-Care or Urban Evasion, good players think less of you and believe you are actively throwing the game. Please leave these perks on the bench."
---
This is amazing. I would love a part 2 on the Killer side.
---
Okey dokey doo buddy :))))))
---
Whooooooosh
---
•3• ^*'oink*
---
it's probably this, there needs to be an option to disable that because i hit it a lot
---
He’s traumatized because of what he saw on the inside
---
FIVE MATCHES. FIVE FUCKING MATCHES, AND EVERY TIME, THE KILLER SPAWNED RIGHT ON TOP OF ME, AND HAD ME HOOKED IN SECONDS.
---
GAME, KINDLY STOP PISSING DOWN MY BACK AND SAY THAT IT'S RAINING
---
Wouldn't that still effect the settings? I have to check and uncheck the option cause it seems like it glitches out. If not they need to fix that. Regardless no I'm not going ham on my controller like that so I dont think that's the case
---
In that case, we welcome you to the community.
---
It's a reference to "The Office"
---
So, we aren't going to mention the absolute absurdity of this whole thing? Survivors are mad because they have a bad time. Killers are mad because they have a bad time. We all have those days or weeks where we can't touch the game because it's gotten us so pissed. Yet we keep coming back, hoping next time will be different. We are addicted to this game. It's broken at times and it sucks for both sides. We are a community at the end of the day, so why cant we try to make the best of it? Everyone knows when they are being toxic, just don't do it. I had 2 guys who kept destroying hooks over and over. There were only 2 genes left before I finally got one hooked. I was screaming in rage but I didn't dc. Because it would ruin the game for the other 2. I ended up getting a 3k. With no salty message. Never camped, never went after the one unhooked. It was hell. But I know that if I'm a survivor and the killer DC's, it sucks. Treat others the way you want to be treated. And remind me to stop writing bloody essays in the comments.
---
*xXxD4rk_Sl4y3rxXx* has added you to a group
---
I know that Iv got every killer to lvl 40 except 3
---
Didn’t know that,
---
Plenty of killers do DC when things don't go their way. However outside of dedicated SWFs ruining the game for the killer is pretty difficult.
---
*"They all look the same to me!"*
---
Is it just me or players that like DBD will most likely also be playing rust?
---
Tapp can cuff me any time he wants. ;)
---
The world doesn't care about us colorblind people, comrade.
---
I WOULD RATHER GET HOOKED THAN SIT THERE AND HAVE MY TIME WASTED BY KILLERS DOING THAT. IT'S HAPPENING WAY TOO OFTEN
---
Play however you want but don't be surprised when people DC instead of playing out a shit game.
---
A weird bug. 
---
But as mentioned, those are the sounds for picking up/dropping an item. Kind of makes sense that the two with items get the pickup sound while the Kate gets the drop sound.
---
They fear our potential
---
Pretty much every nurse on console
---
I haven't watched that in years
---
Thx for the feedback
---
What did you bring upon this cursed land
---
It's practically a dead perk. Even in SWF you still have to be lucky enough to make the first unhook before going down.
---
Then you gotta deal with being broken for a minute, good luck with that.
---
Don't get me wrong it's fun as hell when it works but it's not consistent enough to justify.
---
We hold out till the end brother
---
i misunderstand that survivors have no means of communicating unless they are in a SWF group together? lmao. the only person who doesn't seem to understand this game is you. in fact, i now have to question whether you have even *played* it.
---
I miss the days of panicking at the first sight of the heartbeat. Good times
---
Did your friend just get the game? If so, all it means is that the multiplayer aspects of the game haven't downloaded yet, and it needs some time to download.
---
It's probably because an update didn't finish, usually only the tutorial will be Available. Make sure there isn't an update that got left behind
---
no u
---
LOVELY
---
Thanks! Will let him know.
---
I love running deliverance personally, but that's just me. It is definitely not a top tier perk, but I enjoy using it just to self kobe.
---
Thank you! Will ask him to check.
---
Well it’s time to go back to nurse so I can win games
---
In the patch notes it says something about keeping addons and offerings in your inventory if you DC. Is that the case here I wonder, or am I missing something? Or is that only when all 5 people don't finish the initial loading screen?
---
But yeah, what a waste. He does deserve to lose the addons regardless since he DCd!
---

Set the engine to Unreal Engine 4 version 4.21
---
Empathy, Calm Spirit, Alert, Sprint Burst. Keep breaking LOS
---
Hope you both figure it out and are able to play with one another!
---
They need to make it so the killer does not get the points for the entity kill
---
My only advise is in chase never bring the killer to someone working on a gen especially one that's almost done :(
---
Because one way or another, the Entity requires the ritual of survivor/killer struggle to feed itself. It’s not just feeding on their bodies or souls - it needs the trials it sets up in order to feed. EGC really doesn’t effect that, in my opinion. And really, the Entity certainly had the ability to just kill or otherwise dispose of the survivors at its discretion even before EGC was a thing - the lore isn’t always super consistent, but it’s definitely explicit in that the Entity is always in complete control of everyone in its realm (except maybe Vigo). It doesn’t just kill them because the trials are the whole point, not simply death. (Sorry I really like analysis and discussing lore)
---
No problem. In the meantime, I suggest telling him to go through the tutorial, so he can get the tutorial bloodpoints and get a head start on a character
---
It's because people here have enough of a victim complex to say things like "Killers have SUFFERED for YEARS at the hands of TEABAGGING" that they feel some weird sense of retribution doing it to others.
---
I don't get it either.
---
Mine is the complete blue outfit.
---
Like others have said, it would appear you have all available perks to Tier 3 on Spirit. This includes all generic killer perks, The Spirit's three unique perks, and any teachable perks you have unlocked from other killers. Since you said you have most killers to level 40, I can assume you've also made sure to buy the teachable perks in their level 30, 35, and 40 bloodwebs. Check, and you will probably see that you have all of the perks you've bought this way on Spirit.
---
And not all perks have purple rarities. You'll probably notice that when you buy new perks, or even look at a level 1 character who only has their uniques, not all perks are the same colour at Tier 1. Instead of checking for colour, look for the little number in tally marks in the top right of the perk icon. If there are three marks, you have the perk fully leveled up.
---
Ok thx
---
Its tapp.
---
RITUALS ARE THE NAME OF THE GAME. THEY SEEM IMPOSSIBLE, BUT ARE WORTH IT. AT LEAST, THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING.
---
I don’t remember there being any other leaks, you sure you’re not talking about some fanmade thing
---
Ok thank you for the info
---
Squeal Team 6 in full pout and ready for action!
---
Yes, a lot of male survivors have the textured torsos under their clothes. Some licensed survivors do not. The females have bras.
---
Ok I want to thank everyone for taking the time to help me out with a lil DBD knowledge. And from that knowledge I know everything I need to know about this.
---
Dat ass
---
League of legends would like to have a word with you
---
If a killer closes hatch, what do you expect us to do? Sit in a corner?
---
This scares me
---
in game, when reaching level 3 myers will have the hand open instead of closed
---
The Entity cant kill you if you go down before EGC starts, or even shortly after. You'll bleed out before then. Blame all the asshole survivors who urban immersed around the map for 20+mins to waste killer's time, thats why you have EGC.
---
No, I'm not talking about normal gameplay. I'm obviously talking about the killers who take the game hostage,  quit trying to make it sound like someone is begging for a free escape. I play killer too,  and i think it's unfair how easy it is to get kills. Noed and EGC says it all.
---
Sorry for being unstoppable
---
In other words
---
You're going Ghost?
---
6000 bp isn’t much though… You didn’t do anything in that match.
---
Same thing happened to me earlier today, I was playing killer, downed the last survivor after forcing 2 others to leave, but the timer kept going at normal pace. I killed the last survivor anyway, but still, it was very odd that the timer didn't slow down at all.
---
Exactly. This strictly is in killers favor,  it takes all want away from solos to want to be altruistic. It's already hard to get saved off the hook,  let alone when this is started.
---
Just because they can crouch, doesnt mean they're really pig like. The pig's crouch is slower, where Ghostface is fast
---
That was probably the most aids thing I've ever had to read.
---
As much as I agree, you have to remember that the skill gap between some people is ridiculously large. I picked up the game 2 months ago and got to rank 3 a week or two after the reset. A buddy of mine has had the game longer and he can't break rank 10.
---
I tried picking up the Nurse and had a lot of success, but her blinks were still iffy to me [if you hold any other button except forward, your blink will get skewed which messed me up a lot]. However, you're great with her! It all depend on the skill level.
---
AWESOME!! I'M MAINING THE PLAGUE AND CLAUDETTE. HOPING TO MOVE SOON TO JANE. STILL LEARNING EVERYTHING O/\O
---
Gen rush is not even a thing
---
Also splitting up is always great, since if the killer finds a group of survivors on the same gen they all will be forced out of the gen. Also, being split in gens removes most travel time and doesnt have the efficiency debuff from co-op gens
---
HA! Yo ass just got Looney Tune'd
---
&gt; hopes and desperation of survivors in their attempts to escape
---
Having a timer in this game should increase the survivors hopes and desperation of escaping = entity feeds more = lore is supported, not defeated.
---
FUCK KEYS
---
WHY WOULD THEY CREATE AN ITEM THAT JUST GIVES SURVIVORS A FREE ESCAPE
---
I mean, if we didnt have post-game chat and a history of teabagging as an insult, that last part could be someone's reality.
---
Seeing all that toxic behaviour as encouragement, and thanks.
---
Omg,  what are you not understanding? Lmfao. They block the door after closing the hatch,  little whispers light goes off,  they go block the other door,  and you cannot open it. Boom you're dead, and they get a free kill from camping yay. That takes so much skill that since I evaded them and they couldn't hook me I die anyways.
---
Kind of a dumb question Zombie, but if I unlock a perk from the shrine of secrets...do I have to go to that killer/survivor, and unlock it with them before they start appearing in my other survivor/killers webs? I bought monitor and abuse, and have not seen it pop up once on my killer
---
What was the deal before? Deadzones?
---
So youre saying you cant open one door while the killer is at the other? It takes 20 sec to open a door you cant bounce back and forth between doors.
---
Aeons old too.
---
Wow, yet another "Legion is bad" post.
---
Legion's fixed now, no reason to hate them anymore.
---
Dont place traps near hooked survivors. Infact dont use any of the special moves
---
Every match I've had the doors are basically 2 feet apart,  so yeah you cannot open them. You must not play survivor lol.
---
I hope they fix the audio soon, the sounds of repeat hooks and the entity noises are annoying as hell atm
---
Those eyes staring into my very soul
---
The survivors don't see an ingame timer over their head in their universe, you're arguing gameplay.
---
I've had only 2 matches so far when the doors are on the same side. Moat of my matches the doors are litterally on the opposite sides off the map. And im a survivor main actually, i guess i shouldnt be suprised coming from your rank.
---
Chances are you’re gonna get camped anyway, on the floor or on a hook. What does it matter, you’re pretty much dead anyway
---
And you downvote... Dear Lord. Survivors see the burning cracks on the ground, they hear the sounds, the music, the shattering sounds, everything.
---
I feel like Legion doesn't deserve all the hate it's just bandwagon at this point.. And that's coming from a survivor main
---
6000 is an awful score tbh....immersed survivors are the worst
---
Is that killer already in the game or was it next update?
---
If you like a challenge and dont get easily then sure if not then dont buy it.
---
He literally just asked if he could on Twitter last year when Ghostface owners said they had upcoming news about video game content. They said yes. It seems like the tweets have been deleted since though.
---
You can only open it if no gates are opened and all gens are done, killer cant seem to do it once the collapse has started
---
"He is flawed"
---
You see. Instead of telling the killer actual good advice on how to chase better or how to end chases faster you get upset that he got demolished.
---
As if losing wasnt bad enough you have the audacity to be salty towards him for securing his likely only kill. And your teammates were clearly very bad if they let a 4k happen.
---
You know, theres a lot of knowledge of how to run loops as a killer like bubba and how to run certain tilesets that tutorials are not really in the game nor does anybody know how to give good advice.
---
 Additionally breaking chase is something that's pretty hard to do and not always pays off, the only way it pays off is if the second chased survivor is not aware certain pallets are used and thus will go down fast. If they reach a pallet though the result is similar to chasing the first guy.
---
It's very clear you know the game better than him. But instead of helping him get better so he can catch somebody, move on to another chase, and not feel like he has to camp the one guy who managed to run him the whole game you just say he is trash and get all salty instead of realizing you won by running him for that long and your teammates are trash for feeding him a 4k in a situation he had no reason to leave.
---
It doesnt help that he is playing bubba which is probably one of the killers I feel is just so weak that it's really hard to build momentum with him.
---
I like the animation, but the toxic gameplay isn't going to get any better. It's a easy guaranteed way to get kills for doing nothing especially lower rank killers.
---
Good old kindred!!!! Yeah
---
The killer shouldn't *have to* push them out of the exit gate. There is literally nothing stopping survivors from just staying in the game *forever* unless the killer is forced to push them out. "A few minutes' worth" my butt. Because survivors are precious sunflowers and killers are the evil monster, clearly.
---
I was seeing the same thing with the Dwight right. Yea he activated it and while Dwight's back was to him he lost no power but as soon as he looked at him the power began to lose charge.
---
Team mates can't help you on the ground,  numerous things can help you on the hook.
---
I feel if it the kill doesnt count the survivor will just hide to spite the killer. I dont feel like its so bad the killer has the advantage after closing the hatch. the survivor has failed to escape twice already
---
Monto wants to know your location
---
I thought I was going crazy. I just hit the touch pad to revert it back.
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
I don't know it eliminates the incentive and I think it does make it a little bit easier for the killer, especially depending on who the Killer is and the location of the exit gates. I'm not saying not give any credit, I'm just saying it shouldn't be a full killed credit so that the Killer is encouraged to go chase and look for the Survivor. At the end game collapse, The Killers primary objective shifts from trying to actively seek you out and kill you to basically just deny you an exit. Like I said, if you progress and exit gate far enough, the killer knows that you're in the area and he only has to Camp that exit gate. There isn't enough time for you to go find the other exit gate and wait 20 seconds to open it. If the killer didn't get full kill credit, he might go seek you out. In the vast majority of games, the Killer is almost always going to find hatch first because he can freely move around the map at greater speed. The Survivor has to be a little conservative because if they get spotted, they're likely done on hook.

---
The EGC kind of forces player survivors to "want to escape asap and by any means", instead of messing with the killer a bit like they so often did before the EGC was implemented.
---
I shit you not, that’s the same map and possibly even the same gen I had that happen on. Expect it didn’t last the whole game for me.. Oof
---
To think there are so many people who think like this. 
---
Nah. Die or escape. No rules in the murder zone.
---
Gotcha. Thank you, Zombie
---
I can't see you in this shade through Tapp's new sunglasses and cop uniform

That's gameplay.

I'm not meaning to be, I often forget that tone and wording doesn't match sometimes (especially on the internet). This is just how I'm used to talking, sweetheart, hun, etc.. is just in my vocabulary from where I live.

Exactly, now imagine him in the artstyle of the videos, and instead of a heartbeat he will have his own lullaby. I wouldn't survive against him because I would be unable to do anything because I would just laugh.

I bet you can't see with the light reflected off the new wrist blades
---
Meh, youre method may have been flawed but you got the desired results all the same.
---
Good work.
---
Nice but you should have also explained hook gymnastics. It's kinda important and there is no way new players could get this right.
---
Or underneath the hook lol
---
No it's the fps, it's really hard to play nurse on console, you'll rarely come across nurse mains
---
Agreed
---
i think it'd fare just fine without the sound. the annoying sound is all, especially when someone marks it next to a gen and doesn't remove it.
---
You might be onto something here mate, you know what? I think it might actually be satire!
---
Except that the whole point of this thread was about wasting people's time, hence the name. People abusing the EGC to waste other people's time is NO better, period. I don't care if it is 3 minutes or 3 hours.

---
When you mention "survivors hanging around, bullying killer, not escaping like they should etc" you're talking about gameplay.  Gameplay shouldn't affect the lore to the point of the entity throwing all it's rules and lore out the window to make sure survivors are on their best behavior or any other reaso which was the original point.
---
Could’ve been an error
---
His skins would just be different varieties of Minecon capes.
---
Wait there's a penalty for multiple people on gen?
---
I dont think anyone was worried about the remake freddy voicelines Robert Englund had all the iconic lines.  But with this actor doing all the voices for ghostface and him also playing a character on cartoon network once upon a time he doesnt seem unobtainable. The thing would probably be licensing. It could turn a inexpensive voice actor into a expensive one. Either way if they wanted their own voice for him it wouldn't be that big of a deal as long as it was close enough. I know his voice is just as iconic as the mask but at the same time I can only recall a few times when he uses the voice while killing someone.
---
If you really want that Kobe just for that 1-in-10 chance to find the Hatch before you get whacked again, then that's your prerogative.

Botany is really good, only way to run self care anymore it to run this to, also makes healing teemates not take forever

Level 18 Myers with all of those level 3 perks? Seems like another high skilled player purposefully deranking.
---
Do note: if you try to mess with quality settings (Low, Medium, High, Ultra they don't work and you have to use the console commands to set the game to low quality. I'm pretty sure they're on ultra.
---
its tough being a dad and a great-uncle at the same time \^\_\^
---
&gt; So you want to make a killer that has 12% survivor run speed,
---
Actually it's more, that is his starting speed, the idea is him being faster. which would be to compensate this:
---
&gt; and can be spotted cross map because of how tall he is?
---
&gt; stops pallet looping entirely with his perk,
---
Now this really confuses me since I tought people wanted pallet looping stopped. the hindered status I made it short enough so pretty much would never happen and just added it so it becomes useful since lvl 1 (you know, the changes in the lvl being that and not the number of times you have to pass through in a chase, forgot to say that one) you know, it could be replaced by some other useless stuff, but the main idea would remain.
---
The second one I thought it would be funny, but I consider it kinda useless since fast reflexes counter it. And i thought it funny as a survivor, that you see the killer in front of you and try your best to avoid getting hit on the face.
---
the third one, yes, It can be OP against new players, and annoying against other players, but I kinda see it fair, like how 2 or more flashlights can be annoying for the killer. maybe make it a hex, so survivors leave their items while searching for it, then go back for them.
---
&gt; uses doesn't have any vision at a certain point
---
Yeah I also fucked up on that one, I forgot to say that the calm down is not to "control" it as stopping the meter, but to actually reduce it. So the idea is that the player would have to control the meter so the killer gains vision, or speed and attack power depending on what the player needs. and the completely blind mode is more like a penalty, or in some rare cases a strategy to take down multiple survivors, kinda like a superfast leatherface. Something that does not have to happen.
---
And for survivors, well, as you can see a lot of the things are made so they can leave LOS.
---
Rewatched this movie last night.....did not age well.
---
We got David King shirtless body pillow, why we can't get shirtless Shape body pillow.
---
I'm just saying the option should exist. I have kobe'd before in front of a killer while the other guy was still hooked. I used ds and made it to a jungle gym. I got downed because I lost the mind game but 8f I had been more patient who knows.
---
Love those little survivor quips
---
😂😂😂
---
I mean... You kinda can, though I disagree with him being low tier(I'd assume mid), you can very easily make those judgements based on their stats &amp; power.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
The first one, I don't know, stopping pallet looping I tought was a good thing to do, the second effect is just filler to avoid having to lvl it up to be useful. (2 times in the same chase on the same pallet seems like good enough)
---
the second one, I tought it was kinda useless, since you don't get much hits on the front. Just a jumpscare perk that gets countered by fast reflexes.
---
Third one, as a hex I think would work just fine.
---
But anyway what changes would you make?
---

---
We can’t see The Ghost’s full potential in this video
---
No, not really. I was never really scared by this game.
---
Idk but for past few days im constantly spawning on top of hex totems soo here I come
---
I mean did you? Sure the ranking system is one thing. But the self reward of looping a killer for 4 gens is definitely something to be proud of, pip or not. But if it was for nothing and teammates cause a snowball leading to a 4k then it's just such stupidly bad luck that seems to be more and more common.
---
nah those are given to everyone :(
---
Not to devalue it, but the killer is also using incredibly bad add ons for actually getting kills.
---
When you stalk someone, it fills *their* stalk meter. If you don't fill this and stop stalking them, the meter will empty over time.
---
Placing a trap on someone when the gates are powered won't activate the trap any more. ACTIVE traps still kill you in the gate, inactive ones do not.
---
That's not an effective gen rush 4 survivors on 4 gens, one gets chased while 3 work on 3 and complete all 3. it is now ~90seconds into the match and you hit 3 different gens, if you are coordinated enough you broke or even completed a cluster meaning the killer can't effectively play defensive. Jumping from gen to gen every ~35 seconds is easier for the killer to track and make plays against it.
---
Okay! Gotcha. Thank you for clarifying that
---
Might be worth Spirit saying about Spirit Fury on point 4. Spirit Fury saves loads of loop time.
---
1. This gamplay was people testing stuff out, not playomg properly.
---
2. It doesn't take much stalking to expose someone, so that's faster that doing 2 chases.
---
I still really wanna see some Julie and Frank fan cosmetics. I really wish we were given more to go off of with them.
---
Time doesn’t pass in the entities realm.
---
Basement blocking, its been there since forever and it should have never been there.
---
Careful that's how the entity finds its new killers.
---
Im just interested to see if the people justifying tbagging will continue to do it lol. Social experiment, im curious.
---
Just saying - if you ran No Mither and Resilience you'd get a better boost.

---
And on the day of the leaks people kept looking at BHVR's tweets calling it a chapter to signify that there was more content, while people who previewed the content said there wasn't. 
---
You're awfully mistaken. Our comments are just clarifying that the wording of tweets shouldn't signify the actual size of incoming content.
---
I know. Why do you think I was complaining about the score? Literally since the X2 event ended I haven't been able to make bloodpoints. The most I got was almost 30k. That was with 2 bloody party streamers and the killer helping everyone max everything out. He let us stun him. He would place down traps so that we could defuse them. He hit us once for the healing, then the survivor rescues. My friend got around 80k and I got almost 30k. I don't know if it's a rank thing since he is an 8 and I'm a 14, but it's been really annoying.
---
Well there is only one thing that I can tell you now...
---
learn to play.
---
Yeah watching streamers has definitely helped the mindgame and chase aspect of the game. After watching enough videos I can atleast down 1 person every game now. I understood from the second day I wasn't going to get any better without learning that part first .
---
if you do a gen with someone both of you get reduced by 10% ,but the gen still get done much more quickly   
---
with 2 people (90+90) at 180% repair speed one generator needs  \~40 sec to get done
---
against it why? lmaoo bit of a weird thing to be against
---
Pig=upvote
---
Implying The Legion isn't a killer
---
If you starts swinging your arms on hook i'm not coming for you, it's more commonly used to signal survivors about a camping killer than "hey come get me". Makes more sense that way.
---
Immersed survivors? As in people that play as if they were really in that situation?

I doubt it’s on purpose. If they’re anything like me, they stopped playing for a month or three (or more) and rank resets brought back to low rank.
---
It's a joke 'hUn'

Pig&gt;Tapp&gt;everything else.

I am a BIG Saw fan so I like both.

“I’m personally offended by other players grinding longer than I have”

No I made it. There could have been a few people who’ve made this meme before me. I’ve never seen one though.
---
Don't forget Tapp
---
But Jane's perks in those tiers are among the worst/most inconsistent lmao
---
and this is if you repair the gen alone, you can easily get all 8k objective points just by doing 1.5 gens with 2 other survivors (Teamplay is actually a great BP boost)
---
Definitely a different play style and definitely my type of playstyle. Stealthy yet aggressive
---
You just a have to check behind you every few seconds and when vaulting windows or dropping a pallet , you don’t have to loop the whole time whilst looking behind you
---
Name of the channel here is The Merkins and I highly recommend anybody to watch them. They make really great parody songs including classic killers from cinema history
---
Ok but
---
Is that survivor ok?
---
the concept of something being timeless is really confusing.
---
Yeah, the entity might be in a something between time and space. So, it is 1996, 2019, 1978, etc. at the same time. but even then, survivors have memories of the trails, so in a way they do perceive time and while their bodies don't change, their minds do. you can of course always say that the momment they appear ingame is when the entity brings them into it's realm, so the Legion was brought from 1996 but in this timeless place they have been killing for a time lapse of 5 "months", while Freddy was brought from 2010 but has been killing for the equivalent of 1 year so they are still teenagers. the release of new killers and all is not part of the lore of the game and the entity has to somehow adapt to the time of the realworld even if in it's time doesn't exists and they have been there for more than 20 years now, or maybe there is indeed no time in the entity realm but these teenagers are actually thousands of years old in perceived time.
---
So I rather ignore it and just continue the joke that they are middle aged guys now.
---
Im not saying you shouldnt be proud.. but the ranking system in this game is total asscheeks so..
---
Same. I switched to feng and ace
---
Billy is better than Spirit, but he is far from OP, but he is way to easy to play
---
Huntress is the hardest killer tbh.. nurse is pretty easy after 1 hour kyf
---
Urban evasion means your likely to be scared of the killer. (getting off gens way early and crouching everywhere.)
---
Self care is weird. I like it because i don’t have to rely on randoms, but some people hate it because it doubles your heal time and you could instead run bond (or empathy/aftercare but they’re less reliable) to find others to heal you faster.
---
How is Legion the least serious killer?  We got a clown and a giggling Doctor

If you're using P3 Claudette, you're a blendette whether you immerse or not, unless you literally sprint everywhere you go. On certain maps all you have to do is stop moving and you become invisible.
---
Not necessarily toxic, but the biggest dickhead survivor mains play exclusively P3 Claudette because of this, you're just going to roped in with them.
---
Why would I give advice to a rank 4 killer that just tunneled me and facecamped because he got salty? You sound very angry and frustrated.
---
I am not salty, I’m just frustrated with getting tunnelled for 5 gens and then depipping because the rank system is trash.
---
Just chill you’re way more upset than me or that Bubba.
---
Wrong, all the steps are to run directly to the killer and slam all pallets.
---
Can't wait for incoming post of "nerf ghostface", "ghostface op", etc..
---
"Huh ha, wanna see me pull my head off?"
---
He doesnt even look like what he did in the movies, im pretty disappointed.. unless this is a cosmetic from the shop?
---
Wait, wait, can he actually double hit?? WHAT
---
"Its late, You best be sleepin now."
---
Fantastic list, only one issue, I’m just a little bit colour blind and can’t read it without some serious focus haha. Reckon there is just a base text version. Sorry for being a bother. Haha
---
*pew* they were wrong
---
Heard a rumor BHVR might be addressing the DC issue, I hope its true.
---
I wonder if building it was worth the time. I mean, it will get destroyed in two seconds...
---
wait really I'm glad I bought ashy slashy some killers have actually let me have hatch cause I had it
---
The ‘more details’ that come will be that there isn’t a new survivor or map.
---
A lot of them might be intentional but there is a bug force disconnecting people. It happens to me a lot and it sucks not getting to play a full game.
---
People only meme with it, ive started to bring it and spam the light when i 360 the killer, looks cool in montages
---
Obviously
---
As I said, I THINK that's what they were doing. I never said that they absolutely, definitively did. Though, logically it makes the most sense that their goal was to wait out DS, since they likely would have done other toxic things, such as shake their head or waste their ability to assert dominance.
---
I had to stare at the loadout for longer than I'm comfortable with to see the direction he was going in, and you're right, it's rather brilliant.
---
He is here to fight, for me and you!
---
Gonna be teabagging so fast lmfaoo
---
I played with boil over many times and it never worked for me once, i really enjoy making killers exercise a little
---
The difference between lunges and quick swings would be good. I started playing just survivor so I knew there was a difference when I picked up killer, but not much about the utility. Even then, I still struggled to think about it in the moment. Even when I knew the survivor was going to attempt a 360 and I told myself to quick swing instead of lunge, I still would instinctively hold down too long. 😂
---
And along the same lines, swinging through pallets. Mind gaming with the red stain is a good thing to be familiar with, especially when you get into high ranks.
---
Isn’t it a little unfair that bbq and chilli does the same thing but also has a useful in game effect?
---
We got the Wraith, the Spirit, and now the Ghost. 
---
Now we just need the Phantom.
---
Don’t forget too that every week in the store you have the opportunity to unlock 2 Killer perks and 2 Survivor perks using the Bloodstones you get from levelling up. It costs 2k per perk and resets once a week (for me it happens on Wednesdays at 8am GMT+8), but it can allow you to spend fewer Bloodpoints on killers/survivors you don’t necessarily enjoy just ‘cause they have a perk/set of perks considered to be amazing and a must have, or just save Bloodpoints in general from not having to unlock it from their Bloodweb, and instead put them towards your favourites !
---
And yeah, sometimes it can feel like you have a big grind ahead of you, especially as killer, but you can also think about it as time to learn how to play them to the best of your ability and try some different strategies or perk/add-on combos. Didn’t manage to snatch anyone to hell but figured something out or discovered a set up you like ? Then the Entity can be as displeased as it bloody well likes 😜
---
Pretty much any top floor hex is really good
---
Eww legion
---
It definitely ruins everyone's day :(
---
Same thing happened to me. Match registered that I escaped and I lost one pip. Happened because another player disconnected, not the killer. So I’m assuming it’s a patch bug
---
Go ahead and share your opinions about killer perks aswell I wanna know
---
For a 360 to actually be successful you need to plan ahead of where you are. If you don’t have a pallet/window nearby then you’ll probably get hit anyway even if you 360. The best time to use 360 is when you know your next loop if just slightly out of safety so you avoid the hit then run to the pallet/window.
---
Swamp: I amAbout to end this mans whole career
---
So what youre saying is big cock no shock doc just got a new perk &gt;:D
---
* do not leave a survivor on the ground for any reason. This is called slugging and it's not ok
---
How so?
---
"Phase"
---
Billy is the top 3, if not top 2, killer in the game. His ability to travel across the map in seconds, insta-down, and insanely good ad-ons puts him at the top. There's a reason why top rank players mainly play Nurse / Billy, because they're miles ahead of a lot of other killers.
---
I’m fine with it!
---
Red on black/dark images is really hard to read.
---
Idk
---
Yea.   Note that it has some conditions to it.  Each time you hook someone, you gain a token, up to 2/3/4, that reduces your terror radius by 4M during a chase.  I remember this part for a fact.
---
Upon being unhooked, the person who was on the hook becomes the obsession.    If you kill (Or hook?) your obsession,  you lose all (or 2?) tokens.  IIRC the exacts.  May or may not be 100% accurate, but the basic idea is this.
---
Ghostface sounds all around fantastic so far, so hyped

"Normally it takes less than 30 seconds to get it cleansed but that's 30 seconds of not gen repairing."

Someone’s gonna say it. Defo not me. I’m biased when it comes to ghostface coz he’s my favourite horror character
---
Ace says:
---
Lmao go looting my boy
---
a mori
---
O shit cool
---
they escape by fucking over their team. it's a team game so it's a selfish playstyle. somebody needs to be chased to give the rest of the team enough time, if you just hide that won't happen. hiding should only be done if you're injured and/or trying to lose the killer after a chase.
---
It's nice, the collapse is cool, Coldwind rework is god-tier and Legion change is fantastic
---
Gotta teabag after getting BW off after the half way point of the EGC

Too much work, balance-issues and bugs.

I think they should still work in kyf tho....

I would bet it's a bug.

The only acceptable bias
---
Your essay was just long enough, even though its falling on deaf ears when you're talking to trolls.
---
Hard to explain, but many people can agree its a terrible system
---
So maybe there is 0.1% chance of getting Brenda :D
---
The first image makes it look like Dwight's getting that good Ghostface dick from behind
---
Sounds like you're salty to me since you are still complaining about it.
---
Listen if the killer was good enough to not get looped for that long then they would be able to pressure survivors instead of facecamp you.
---
Unfortunately due to the lack of time in the game to go chase another guy he decided to camp you and your allies just fed him kills for altruism.
---
the sound is there so you can at least hear it through walls on lery's or the game
---
Are you, uh, a real killer?
---
How dare you upload footage of me to reddit
---
It is not a rank thing and a bug like that does not exist. Unless you are the only player in the game that has that bug you are clearly not counting the BP properly and just assuming you are getting 30k or doing something wrong. The game is not against you, you are the one messing up somehow.
---
&gt;  I was stealthy, I was hiding in lockers 
---
Here's your problem
---
Hey! This is the DbD subreddit! Not Chu-Chu Rocket!
---
get away from my totem ya animals
---
Doit
---
Herobrine &gt; Every other killer
---
Yeah, just holding W and not even moving their mouse LMFAO
---
Not really man. If I use that playstyle i usually do a majority of the gens alone. I mean I dont use it as a finite playstyle. If I need to draw aggro I can and will but if I dont have to then why bother? If one person is just sneaking constantly doing gens that means the killer literally has no pressure to apply to the team as a whole. How is that selfish? A stealthy gen jockey isnt all that bad. If people hide and they just dont do shit to help then yes I agree it's useless.
---
You don't actually think that certain survivors wouldn't bully/BM though, right? Especially after being in there for so long and getting used to trials/killers etc.
---
Ash for sure would be one of the first ones to bully as he does it in his own respective series, but I could see David, Feng Min, Ace and maybe a few others get super cocky after a while as well.
---
As cool as this guide is, I can't read the red text in the frames. This was posted by the colorblind survivors gang.

Self care: spend 40 seconds in a corner healing yourself when you could be doing gens or get healed by an ally, it's not worth running.
---
Urban: placebo, 99% of the time you can just walk + urban evaders waste time crouching around when they could be doing something productive.

I think he just do it so you dint t-bag him at the exit toxic scum :)

Pretty bold of you to asume i have friends

It's not just russian players, you know.

They cant complain about it either, otherwise its a double standard.

Not in my experience. TheseBillies are good at holding their chainsaw till they know they can hit their mark
---
...what?

How tf can I not be afraid of the killer when the music is creepy af
---
Unlucky.
---
not letting them stalk
---
Yeah, just that Russians make up a high chunk of the playerbase if you're from northern/eastern europe.
---
This implies that Ghostface is communicating with somebody from the real world. Instead of making them aware that the real god is a massive spider-being, he just sends them a murder selfie.
---
Dude, this is awesome!
---
It's *playable*, or so I hear from console-players,  still dogshit fps but doesn't spike as much.
---
It’s only 3 ranks above, besides it’s a hag using bodyblocker build, and people at those ranks don’t know how to use hag
---
Monitor and Abuse raises your terror radius in chase (and for a moment after it ends)
---
Infectious Fright affects everyone inside your terror radius.
---
that's also why he's running a dead rabbit add-on with an infinite tier 3
---
dead rabbit decreases your terror radius in tier 2 and increases it in tier 3
---
he wants as big terror radius as possible, so whenever he downs someone he knows where EVERYONE ELSE is
---
I'm from eastern EU, so I get to experience that playerbase.  
---
If there's one thing that particularly annoys me about russians, is that I never know what they're saying in post-game chat.
---
AND NANCY
---
I know, I just find it sad that so many of us can't enjoy the game without dehumanizing the other players. On both sides are human beings which we seem to forget.
---
People who care about it know it's a possible spawn.
---
most people are legit just scared of dying lol.... 
---
they gonna man up and not be afraid of taking a hit or running through a pallet
---
Paulie actually hates the creeper and said he doesn't want him in the game because the creator is a pedo and he doesn't want to support him
---
Same, I just them with the "sorry habibi me no speakuski baruski" &gt;:D
---
One of the most effective ways to play trapper is the 3 gen strategie. At the beginning of the match select the gens u want to keep and trap around them. On good maps ez win.
---
Imagine having friends to play kyf with
---
Literally just yesterday this happened. I know they’re trying to optimize and there is small improvements and we should be patient but so many crucial plays have been thrown because my screen froze for 3 seconds.
---
Killer‘s equivalent of decorating the christmas tree
---
The issue is they then have to basically keep outdated patches in the game AND functioning. Considering the amount of bugs in keeping one version alive I don't think it'd fare well.
---
How do I make my own dbd porn tho?
---
Honestly don't mind dying to the entity 🤗
---
I miss her lunge so fucking much tho
---
Oni Susie when
---
Don't let him stalk and do gens. So basically a solo players nightmare cause you know no one is going to do gens and he is gonna suck someone who isn't paying attention dry.
---
U right u right, wish more people played in the early patches tho, I have a copy of 1.2.1 but never get to play it :/
---
Why would you care about hatch escapes?  
---
To me, at least, they don't mean much.
---
Self care is 100% worth running, these people don't know what they're talking about. Yes, you personally take more time to heal yourself, but it's a 100% time efficient perk(and time is very important in this game, the faster survivors get the gens done the less time the killer has to chase, down, and hook people. One person healing themselves for 32 seconds takes just as much of the collective survivors time(the survivors effectively have 4x as much time as the killer, because there are 4 of them) as one survivor healing another(because neither of them can do anything during this).
---
It's also amazing for solo play, it's absolutely miserable trying to rely on randoms, so unless you're playing with a SWF group, self care is basically mandatory. Urban isn't great(it used to be good before exhaustion was changed) but it can still be useful sometimes. Still, best to avoid it as those are somewhat rare situations and it's a bit of a noob trap perk(lots of people just spend the whole game crouching 90% of the time, wasting time they could have better spent doing gens or getting people off hooks. Hope that helps.
---
No, he just kept shocking her.
---
Cmon he got instasaw addons
---
And the very next part of that line was also repairing generators. The hiding in lockers is to prevent the doctor from causing my survivor to scream. Being stealthy was avoiding the killer. You know, the whole point of the game.
---
Ive actually let people go cause I close hatch on there faces and i just feel so bad like there spamming r1 but I'm there to just slam it close
---
Waaaah
---
Thanks for the ultimate killer guide kind sirrr
---
That was good
---
Jeez, that joke got ghosted.
---
Killer can't get enough emblems to pip if one of survivors disconnects
---
both sides are affected
---
they had to make a new light bake map for every bouquet and they didn't want to work harded just to make every new map look good with offering you can't get anymore
---
Haha alright, you got my upvote.
---
That makes two killers who can t-bag. One is just faster tho
---
he's complaining about killers that close the hatch, down you and refuse to hook you while you have no hatch nor an exit gate open to escape
---
I started playing like 6 months ago roughly. I logged a lot of hours since then and at first it was super toxic with survivors. I'd get hate messages left and right. As of late I dont run into as much toxic playstyles with survivors. It's more rare than the toxic killers I run into. Playing killer isnt that bad anymore. I was getting salt if I won and even if I lost I'd get salt. No it's just gg stuff and that's been it.
---
10% penalty when two people work on one, meaning they work in total at a 1,8x speed. This equals to the gen being done in 44,444 seconds.  
---
20% penalty when three people work on one, meaning they work in total at a 2,4x speed. This equals to the gen being done in 33,333 seconds.  
---
30% penalty when four people work on one, meaning they work in total at a 2,8x speed. This equals to the gen being done in 28,571 seconds.
---
I love that my salty message posts get taken down instantly even when I censor people's names but this has been up for 6 hours
---
I've also noticed this bug. Had a team where 3 people rage quit and fucked a poor Dwight, so I let him do gens to try for the hatch, but the hatch must've tried to spawn on the DCed Nea. We could both hear it but not see or use it.
---
How about instead a way to customize all the attributes you just mentioned? Just a bunch of scroll settings so you can do something stupid like give the killer 200% speed but pallet stuns like 30 seconds and gens are 4 minutes etc. Something a la creative mode of other games.
---
some of them do it to see how it looks like
---
the rest wants you to taste your own medicine
---
Finally some good fucking memes XD
---
Not going to lie. It would never work but imagine doing a few gens per match and finally you did the seventh gen 3 matches later and samara pops out of it and now two killers are after you.
---
It was fun the first 2 times. After that, it is kind of annoying to have my time wasted for it.
---
Imagine playing against her and then your phone rings IRL
---
I just got ashy slashy and I so happy with my purchase :D
---
The dcs are random. I usually get at least 1/10 matches that have DC's it's not that bad but it happens.
---
See, that's the opposite of what I've been told to do. This is the first time I've almost beat him, and it was by keeping an eye on my manic level. Now I'm gonna admit that I'm not good at looping killers. I know people talk about it like it's some easy to do method, but aside from one time in the map with the bigger trees, the killer has easily kept up and knocked me out. I'm getting a little bit better at it because I've been doing more daily rituals like the "run from killer for 120 seconds as so and so". 
---
I like those ones cause I'm not planning on surviving and it makes it less stressful for me. But the doctor stresses me out. This seems like a stealth-ish game and going against a killer than can make your character scream just by holding a button for a few seconds annoys me. 
---
Killers I've beat:
---
Hag
---
Michael
---
Hillbilly
---
Nurse
---
Vomit lady
---
Pig head
---
Clown
---
Killers that I absolutely cannot get past
---
Doctor Dick
---
Freddy, bringer of creepy children chorus. 
---
So like, any advice on these two would be absolutely fantastic. I'm not good at this game. But it is fun when I have fun teammates.
---
The Game is good if you run Balance Landing. Without BL is pretty meh. But it still has some safe pallets where you can loop the killer for a long time.
---
I've done that to someone before with a recording of her. It was great but they got pretty scared and cried. I'd do it again too though.
---
Nurse is a pain to even discuss because there's only awful nurses or gods. Nerfing her to bring the gods back in to the fold basically ruins her for everyone else.
---
I'd love if Myers did the "BWAAAH" sound when getting hit by a pallet.
---
He's a phantom, dududu dudu dudu
---
I had to take my ashes p3 clothes off sometimes because I get dodged a lot late at night. Can confirm.
---
I see, thanks! Yeah, playing with randoms without Self-Care feels a bit hazardous because more often than not the person unhooking you just runs off without a second thought, and even if I follow them and indicate that healing would be appreciated, they do nothing. At least that has been my experience, so yeah.
---
It's been like that since they changed the pip penalty.
---
It takes 3 tries on xbox too. I hate it. I figured out though if you crouch it will work the second time.
---
The real disrespect isn't in Ghostface's turbo 'bagging, but his start-up into the Mori animation has him mount the survivor from the rear.  You can cancel it out and keep doing it and turn this shit from Scream into Deliverance. 
---
And they thought they could stop me by removing the LF hammer whack.
---
Never play Smite then. God the day I learned some games split EU into same-alphabet chunks I cried a little....
---
This is why when I play her and am done with killer for the day I immediately switch to someone with less annoying sound effects. Lol.
---
There have been some posts about it,but i think they went down due to the tons of posts about the new killer
---
^because ^^there ^^^arent ^^^^enough
---
&gt;!ok!&lt;
---
I'd actually love to learn how her blinks work.
---
there are too many posts about it
---
As a P3 Nea Killer Mains my Nea seems to not be able to kill anyone my flashlight M1 is not working is it a bug? :( And whenever I run Object of Obssession my teammates start running away from me I don't get it is the perk that scary? s/
---
On another Note Thank god I see so many survivors just being crouch walkers everywhere even outside Killer Terror Radius. My past few games these fricking P3 Urban Evasion Claudette mains Literally afk crouching close to you when ur on Hook outside of Killer Terror Radius it's actually insanity.
---
They all vanished somehow under "HEY GUYS LOOK AT THIS 7 SECOND CLIP OF A KILLER MISSING A BASIC ATTACK!!!"
---
I mean he does use a voice changer in all the movies so Ghostface never speaking without it makes sense (in the context of how Scream movies are "whodunits").
---
Maybe give Ghostface some in-game goal cosmetics ala Leatherface that has him replicate the voices of various survivors (gained after sacrificing a certain number of them).
---
doctor is on the bottom of the tierlist, because his power only gives him information and he messes with your visuals. the only real effect of his power is that being shocked stops you from vaulting.
---
The Clown
---
You on PC or console? Just trying to get an idea as in the past console was about double the amount of disconnects
---
I'm curious how they're going to name the new killer in german. Ghost = Geist / Gespenst. Wraith = der Geist, Rin = das Gespenst. So both terms are already taken... but thats just a german thing I guess :p
---
Don't blame this on the Feng Mins, Sid. 
---
Feng Mins don't make t-baggers.  Feng Mins make t-baggers more creative.
---
That is actually a genius idea. Idk why I never thought about it. I guess because I forgot ghostface did that in the 3rd film.
---
whoever finds the hatch first wins
---
Myers,Hag and Spirit are in my opinion the most enjoyable.
---
Legion is also close,the feeling of vaulting pallets and windows is so liberating
---
I mean it was playable before I quit but it's not much fun when its 1v1 or 1v2 at the start of a round. I know fpd isnt going to be super amazing on console but hoping they are at least a little more stable.
---
What I meant by that is I don't do it myself, not I flame people for doing it
---
because most of us won't buy it anyway
---
also, people were meming about it a long time ago when it was teased
---
I don't do it is what I meant
---
Das cheating, dont
---
Yeah from time to time i have my patience corrupted and my integrity fail, i get the shits and either boycot dbd for a while or just piss and moan the whole time a play, we all go through cycles just like the games community, but i definitely agree with you saying that this game and its players have changed, its so much more balanced now, so much better, less reasons to be an asshole, less reasons to hate indiscriminately, slowly we are getting there. I love it to be honest. And its the small contributions we make, like saying "ok" to salty rants instead of biting back, stuff like that.
---
Crank it to 100%. I play on ps4 as well and anything less than that isn’t going to let you effectively look back and forth without bumping into something.
---
Console. Xbox. I meant to put that in the comments. Idk how it is on PC but on console I would say it's not common enough for me to be put off by it. It happens at least a couple times per night. If you play killer it will happen a lot more often. The dc usually is at the start of the match or if it's been long enough and no gens are done people do it. The rage quitters a little more rare.
---
well, we faced a nurse yesterday, I was the last Surv. Both gates are literally next to each other and in between was the hatch. So there was no way I could open a door, as each door is just 1 blink away for a nurse. She closed the hatch, all I could do was get into the basement and look for a key. Pretty bad that there was no real way out.  
---
Thats the other side of this new endgame. Some people do nothing and escape, some people do most of the work and still cant escape.
---
Rage quitters I'm not so mad about it's the system disconnects I hated starting a round with at least 1 survivor not connecting.
---
Damn, that's really cool. I'd want one for my shelf!
---
domenatrix huntress when?
---
Happened to me earlier, too. He shut the hatch, and kept knocking me down while I was trying to power up the gate. He wouldn't hook me; I'd wiggle out and run back to the gate to continue opening. Rinse and repeat. Happened 3 times before EGC got me.
---
I'm more proficient with *Wraith* than with Billy's chainsaw.  Can't hit one to save my life.
---
I usually dont even see the red from the killer. But the stumble after vaulting is what keeps getting me. There are times when I'm panicking and I'll try going the nearest vault with him right behind me, but I tend to play safe and try to trick with a quick turn before vaulting.
---
I load into a three man game and I get annoyed when the killer goes ham from the beginning, like maybe give us 1 gen to make the field “level” again even though it really isn’t. Even when I play as killer I either let them get one gem then go ham, or I kill 2 and let 1 go.
---
This a reference to something?
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
But your opponents are also console players so there's that.
---
I think he might of mean hes photoshop skills for this meme.
---
How is it bad but you can't even explain it? :S
---
Yeah it’s pretty bad at this point. BBQ was nerfed pretty good, decisive was nerfed bringing balance. Then all of a sudden MoM is released then the balance is gone. Lasted a whole 2 seconds.. it just seems unfair to use these cheap builds. I always felt bad using decisive pre-nerf but now I’m starting to feel that way with MoM. 
---
The perk system just needs a complete balance “pass” before we’re stuck too deep in the rabbit hole.
---
&gt; Sooo how does that make him OP?
---
"His ability to travel across the map in seconds, insta-down, and insanely good ad-ons puts him at the top"
---
You should really read before you downvote instantly
---
if you had Borrowed Time or were injured with MoM activated Billy and Leatherbuns don't have collision after m2. they can't bodyblock you in corner and hit again. with Leatherface you are mostly fucked cause can do multiple m2 hits in a row but with proper Dead Hard timing plus to your MoM/BT you'll escape.
---
and, yes, it's really weird Plague has collision when vomiting. it's as if Myers had it while stalking. yes, she technically can't get instadown with a hit from healthy survivor but cornering the healthy dude and vomiting for less than stalk she makes them broken and there is your instadown basically. i don't know why it's in the game.
---
Doc is far from the bottom of the tier list. He's mid-tier at the absolute lowest.
---
"You shee Mr.Powers, I love goooold!"
---
P2W
---
I play from the Middle East and I get *a lot* of Russians in my games.
---
Play how you want, and tell anyone who has a problem with it to go fuck themselves and cry more.
---
Ok thanks, I will use it!
---
Watch it be something dumb like "Gestalt" or "Erscheinung" which makes no sense, like they did with Michael.
---
I really hate playing against doctor so I don’t really like playing as him, also I know prestige is worthless now but I feel accomplished seeing all killer prestige 3 :)
---
he's next to wraith and freddy
---
All of that makes sense. I don't LIKE MoM, but that and BT are perks designed to give you an extra protective hit, it shouldn't be a matter of which killer powers can cheese them and ignore them entirely. Chainsaws always behave that way too, as you can use speed limiter and survivors will still behave as if they've been M1ed.
---
Myers is a whole different monster to Plague. Plague's vomit is a really fancy method of getting a first hit 9 times out of 10, where Myers snowballs off stalk and could down multiple people rapidly because someone gets trapped. At most the team loses 1 hit from someone getting pinned in by Plague, which in some cases can happen from chases where she breaks people in a single puke anyway. Like I said above, removing her collision during her power would make her completely countered by running directly through her as she charges.
---
Literally any FPS games with dedicated servers - Rainbow 6, Call of Duty, CSGO, and a lot more
---
I disagree. He feels stronger than Freddy and Wraith and easier to play than Hag or Trapper. You can shock loops and pallets to prevent pallet drops/vaults.
---
Also his 3-gen game is unparalleled. 
---
Why do you think survivors disconnect against him so much?
---
why is this comment getting downvoted so hard damn
---
One of the reasons I play on PS4.  You can knock consoles all day, but I don't get salty messages after every game.  lol
---
D: i know, i'm just whining cause frustrated, i always play how i want.
---
Hahaha do you realize how easy it is to reach red ranks?
---
You should make more of these,
---
You don’t have to watch it...?
---
It looks stupid, but I don’t blame the Clown at all. Claudettes are invisible in tall grass.
---
IF A RED RANK SURVIVOR PLAYS WITH THEIR RANK 20 FRIEND WHY DOES IT MATCH AGAINST A RANK 20 KILLER INSTEAD OF A RED RANK KILLER. TIRED OF HAVING TO FACE OFF VS WAY BETTER SURVIVORS BECAUSE THEY PLAY WITH THIER LOW-RANK FRIEND. I AM NOT GOOD AT THE GAME BUT AT LEAST GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH EQUAL SKILLED PLAYERS SO I CAN LEARN AND GET BETTER INSTEAD OF GETTING BULLIED.
---
Don’t hide in corners ? I love when I catch people in a corner with her hahah
---
Psssssh stop posting about it and buy one ! We all have ! I have 4 myself.
---
Actually now you're able to stab them 28 times without them going down.
---
I noticed!! Hope they fix it and put them back in. 
---
Rip Look Who’s Shittin In The Tall Grass
---
I love their own design, the cloak just looks dumb, he would trip over it constantly of get it stuck on corners.
---
The one which doesn't do harm to survivors off, otherwise it's toxic , dirty or whatever other shit excuses ppl have
---
Lore wise, the entity is just angry, that his killer is failing so he steps on, you say the same about mori,
---
Just you.
---
I hope this is sarcasm
---
I’ve done this on the game, it wasted to much of the killers time, that’s the whole point.
---
Which would be holding its own little flashlight!
---
I can understand that if Infectous Fright was a bit more reliable (maybe if it showed actual aura instead of just a notification), but it seems kinda counter intuitive to run Monitor with it IMO, but I can kinda see where he's going with it
---
My retinas are burning just trying to read the text.
---
You are queer
---
The result of which being, the killer has to sit and wait 10 minutes for the survivor to nut up and do a generator...
---
Or the end game starts without a hatch, and they either open a gate or die.
---
The movie outfit is just unpractical really, he would be tripping up constantly or getting caught on things, this outfit looks amazing I love the flowing ribbons.
---
Its obvious to me that it's the Alien from the movie Alien. I think knife he's holding is just a place holder for his real weapon... The the face hugger. The fact that he can get so low and still stay at speed gives it away. And the fact that we know it's a licensed killer.
---
No dont justify intentionally being a cunt as "the usual". 
---
Choosing to be a fucking asshole is choosing to be a fucking asshole, its a choice regardless of how it looks.
---
Learn to predict survivors movements. When you’re far from a hooked survivor and they get rescued, don’t just run straight to the hook they were on. Try to predict which way they might have run to and try to cut them off.
---
IT'S NOT A GLITCH, IT'S A FEATURE
---
yeah i noticed that and im really happy it does.
---
If You are Good u dont need that much Time 
---
And propably 30days to hit rank1 isnt A problem to A good Player even when he dont have Time to Play The game bcs  ,,he Have life not like me it ogier rank 1''
---
Just try and have fun friend
---
At this point they have to, it's either 3 DCs or I get destroyed, love purple ranks
---
Me: Can you speak english?
---
Ruski: Shut up fa\*\*ot
---
LUL. Yeah seems like the hatch mechanic is just broken just like before, but in different terms. Imho there should be a limit for the minimum distance between doors.  
---
GL on ur matches o/
---
As a killer main:
---
- Remember that Hilbilly and Bubba have a melee aside from their chainsaws. I don't know how many times I've caught a survivor off guard because they thought they had time before I charged
---
\&gt;  All of that makes sense. I don't LIKE MoM, but that and BT are perks designed to give you an extra protective hit, it shouldn't be a matter of which killer powers can cheese them and ignore them entirely. Chainsaws always behave that way too, as you can use speed limiter and survivors will still behave as if they've been M1ed. 
---
how's that in any way relevant to what i said? i literally just said how it goes with LF and Billy &gt; I can't remember if they do lose their hitboxes or not. 
---
second part though makes sense, thanks for pointing that out. i didn't think of the part where you can run \*inside\* Adiris. then how about a solution for a survivor to lose collision when they go into broken state like these few moments after being unhooked? because it really does snowball if 2 or more people were trapped in basement by Plague, pretty much Michael, i do agree they're different but Plague is stronger than him. survivors can choose not to cleanse and with that easier to spot and hear. i played enough Adiris to find it much easier facing survivors who choose not to cleanse because the hardest part with her is tracking(don't know how it is for others, but i'm having a hard time spotting people behind that constantly in motion weapon. just like with Spirit in her Geisha outfit - sleeves are moving a lot distracting from survivor's movements). but if they do cleanse, it gives you a lot of power. so when you trap and put 2+ people to Broken status that gives you 1 guaranteed down + either someone easy to spot or pool of power. so i think there must be something done about it. she's a high mid tier killer unlike Leatherface.
---
You’re missing out on chase points. You need to get into some chases, doesn’t matter who the killer is
---
Der Spuk, der Geist, das Gespenst, die Seele, der/die Wiedergänger/in. 
---
No idea what the German versions are since I play in English, but I think that there's enough to make it work?
---
I don't see many people use Deerstalker out of slug builds for example, I use it because I can't see for shit, everything else involves getting more bloodpoints, somehow I'm doing fine without actual help from perks, but then again I'm only rank 15
---
Really? I would've gone with der Schatten for example. It's not the same as die Form (which would be a fucking stupid name, lol), but it gets across the ominous vibe that the Shape is supposed to have.
---
I don’t even have the game, but I still read that.
---
Unlike you I barely have any time to play what with going to uni and having a job. My point however is that the system doesn't feel any more difficult, all it has done is increase the amount of games you have to play to rank up. It just means I can't play any game other than dbd if I want rank 1 which in its self is not fun to be in with queue times.
---
That's one part of Nurse down, then comes predicting survivor movement when you have no LOS on them and potentially getting used to certain set of add ons (which isn't that hard but still, variables...)
---
The amount of hypocrisy when the ghost teabags back at survivors on the hook will be epic
---
Really like this idea. I think it'll be handy for new players as well to understand how perks work and affect their survivability.
---
What rank?
---
I've got a few basic tips: 
---
when breaking a pallet, try to do it from the side you don't want the survivor to run to
---
Kicking generators might seem important, but it is often a waste of time. If you need to chose between chasing a survivor or kicking a generator, chase the survivor.
---
Don't stick around the hook. You're wasting your own time. You give the survivors all the time they need to complete their generators. (The Cannibal says: "my perk 'Barbecue &amp; Chili' allows you to quickly find your next victim agter hooking someone.")
---
I disagree lol
---
We already don't get many BP if we facecamp. But people would still do it to basically say 'hey FU'. Douchebag killers, yup I'm hating on those people.
---
Same for the tbagging survivors who won't leave the trial. Douchebags, it's not the mechanics, just people choosing to be douchy, not because they don't have a choice.
---
You have to click space-bar while healing.
---
Meanwhile Dwight behind that campfire is like :D
---
I think he was rank 6? Around purple ranks anyways.
---
you have to click your skillcheck button while healing without a skillcheck being there
---
4 survivors not doing anything for 30 seconds is 120 seconds total survivor time lost. Completing a ganarator takes 80 seconds, so you effectively took a generator and a half worth of progress away from them
---
Yea but it probably will never stop at this point even if they were nerf him into the ground
---
I find Clown fun to play against loopers, people even DC against em xD
---
Hillbilly is not overpowered at all and the fact that you are saying he is means you have little understanding of how the game works
---
Yeah your right I just picked it up the other day. Your perceptiveness is unrivaled.
---
It's a meme, they were just posting that in case someone gets the wrong idea and comes to the comments to complain.
---
Give me a Creeper who just silently sneaks up on survivors, explodes, downs them and respawns at the nearest hook.
---
Yes daddy, I'm a salty survivor, make me tea bag
---
honestly I've had the opposite experience. But then again, I let the survivors farm every game, so people were a lot less likely to be dicks
---
I'm actually sans
---
Noed isn't really needed for killers with insta downs.
---
HOW IS IT RNG IF INSIDIOUS APPEARS ON MY BLOODWEBS EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL UNTIL I TIER 3 IT JUST SO ITS GONE. NO ONE WANTS INSIDIOUS ON A DOCTOR. ITS THE MOST ASSHOLE PERK IN THE GAME. ITS LITERALLY ONLY GOOD FOR BEING A CAMPING DOUCHE-CANOE
---
Dude what? :D Explain it to me please.
---
She's the same as billy and bubba when it comes to bodyblocking. Don't hide in corners against her.
---
The worst spot for the hatch to spawn
---
Because bodyblocking is a game mechanic. Don't want to get bodyblocked in a corner against Plague? Don't hide in a corner against her.
---
I said give 1k not not 5k
---
Ik it just adds overkill basically because he can 1 shot all game with or without noed plus if he crouches and you don't see while noed is active you're basically dead.
---
Smart of her to actually notice it was the one you needed. Your teammates should have left so you could get hatch. :$
---
Yeah, both sides have their own bm and I don't think there is any point in getting worked up about it, haha.
---
im currently in season 2 episode 8 of Ash vs Evil Dead and i can now approve this post as its calling ash and/or his puppet Ashy Slashy
---
The killer closing the hatch overrides the survivor jumping in. I’ve seen a video of a survivor start to perform the jump animation and the killer just closes it anyway.
---
I was up against a really bad nurse (no hate she's stupidly hard) and when I finally got downed after being chased for 3 gens I was farmed twice by the same guy.
---
Love this game
---
Haha Noed so skill
---
I don't think we have to leave it as "sadly there's no way to prevent this". It's a problem specific to Leatherface's kit. They could patch it so that if he revs his chainsaw at a hooked survivor for more than 10 seconds, then it turns off with a cooldown, so survivors at least have a chance to rescue their team mate.
---
There was a lot of posts about it before the item dropped and when it was just teased.
---
A lot of posts aren't coming out because if you look past the funny meme fact, it is a garbage piece of merch, it's an overpriced piece of merchandise that you can just DIY for higher quality for far cheaper.
---
Sucks man. All Leatherfaces are trash like this, they really could add a cooldown to continual chainsaw revs, just to prevent this situation.
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Doesn’t she have nip?
---
This. Always thought it worked like this.
---
Thank you! These people are insane. Sure, in a situation where all four survivors are alive, healthy, and not busy doing objectives or in a chase, and near you, it's more time efficient to get someone else to heal you. But there's a ridiculous number of cases where self-care is useful, especially if you're not running a medkit because toolboxes are better for gen-rushing.
---
Only two survivors left and one is in a chase? Yeah, saunter over them and stop their chase to ask for a heal!
---
You're injured and you don't know where the other survivors are - better waste time going looking for them!
---
Just work on a generator while injured - hey you're fucked as soon as the killer finds you! 
---
Only two survivors left and one is hooked? Forget unhooking and bodyblocking to help them, you're super vulnerable now and are probably just throwing yourself off a cliff! Better wait for hatch. 
---
It's ALWAYS better to be fully healed instead of injured. And it's actually more common than not that you aren't in a position to be healed by someone else. Ergo.....
---
I am not new But I will be reading this. Looks very well structured, I love it :3
---
you can see for a split second that David does his "jump into hatch" animation and then it stops
---
then he stops
---
Freddy says:
---
My perk "Blood Warden" shall not let them pass".
---
"Exposed"
---
It's well documented there's toxic pricks on both sides.
---
I know. He messaged me later saying he forgot about the endgame and got startled when I closed it
---
I wish they actually put these tips in the game. This is nice.
---
Hex: ruin might deter new players, but hit great skill checks just power through them.  I hit 3/5 greats or so, not a problem
---
An me saying I’m the only one who disarms traps
---
Dear God yes, I'm so worried about it too.
---
Legends say that if you mori her, her ass will still be alive.
---
Nah but he could've not said EZ in the endgame chat.
---
Mine are Hag, Huntress, Clown, Plague
---
What if she had no hitbox while charging but it came back while she was releasing. plus when running at her you'd be charging directly into the stream and take a significant amount unless you were directly in front when she vomited
---
Yeah I got that but how the fuck did you do that, the timer ran out
---
Wraith is literally a kind of spirit so yeah i can understand how that would be confusing.
---
To me, I think they may have accidentally did it for Evil Dead DLC. Saw how much of a positive response they got and now deliberately did this one. Theres no way they're just that bad at keeping secrets.
---
Yeah sorry bad. Screens half fucked so zooming in is a pain. Didn’t even think to look at the chat box. More just looking at perks and such
---
BHVR arent exactly known to be masters of story telling.
---
Plot twist: she came for you and you had to get off the box
---
I'm getting a gamerpic drawn of her where she's going to be dummy thicc.  #JaneGang
---
Should've cosplayed Jane, if you know what i mean.
---
The rest of your team DCed like pussies, what do you expect?
---
I blame the game. I was expecting to die.
---
Well both meaning are kind of contrary to each other, so I hope not...
---
Gotta get em all cause he's *Danny Phantom*
---
" Quentin nodded "
---
Well the natural state on the hook is to just hang there so doing so should mean nothing. 
---
Waving your arms means you are actively trying to get a message across to teammates which should imply something is wrong. I’ve always spammed unhook to mean killer is camping.
---
If the killer isn’t camping and no one is coming to get my I tart to perform longer unhook animations, almost like i’m trying to unhook myself, to encourage someone to help.
---
Happened to me on The Game and I DC'ed after being downed for the third time.  The Nurse herself even messaged me, "Wow, your teammates...."
---
Even though my post doesn’t say so, I will share my thoughts too!     
---
Keep in mind that the list is ordered and S tier is the highest tier:      
---
S - Nurse (pretty much the only busted character when played correctly tbh)    
---
A - Spirit, Hillbilly, Myers     
---
B - Huntress, Clown, Hag, Trapper    
---
C - Pig, Legion     
---
D - Doctor, Leatherface, Freddy    
---
F - Wraith
---
Honestly it depends on the situation. Shit teammates. I want them to come and get me. Same with SWF. Come and get ya boi. But if the teams trying to save you and is actually playing smart, then I do it to sign that the killers nearby. Every game is different and that's why I say it's both. It really depends on the type of game you're having.
---
Nurse says "what are pallets"
---
Because that was a bews 4 weeks ago???
---
I could have sworn I thought that was the original concept.  Thank you.
---
DCing is for wussies

Yea. The game is one of the worst maps for any m1 killer or billy
---
he got buffed?
---
That's a pretty fun idea. And the Mori has to be the sleeping bag kill.
---
&gt; Waving your arms means you are actively trying to get a message across to teammates which should imply something is wrong.
---
Well if nobody's coming to save me it's wrong. It's not like you begin to do it instantly after you're hooked. I wait until the killer is far and then begin to flail around if I don't see anybody moving from a generator.
---
Stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Not going to buy that one for a while. No point in buying the potential next freddy if it turns out hes "unfun".
---
Though Ghostface pulls it off, making the killer look exactly the same (giving you the illusion of him being everywhere) whereas Legion wears a pretty revealing outfit that makes it clear that one isn't the other.
---
Legion is, to me, far more akin to the various people who wear masks and kill people in the The Purge franchise.
---
NO TOUCH
---
S- nurse 
---
A- Hillbilly, spirit, Myers
---
B: Huntress, Pig, hag.
---
C: Clown, Doctor, wraith, legion, Plague, Trapper (rank 6-10)
---
D: Bubba
---
E: Trapper (at rank 1)
---
F:reddy

You'll still see the red glow and hear the heartbeat. It shouldn't be too bad.

I've had dbd's toxicness ruin more games on 600 hours than 6000 on rust
---
Well, technically, I can get pallet looped.
---
Nice! Glad I'm not the only one. Even down to the ability being called Feral Frenzy and in The Purge having the "notion" of "releasing the beast" on Purge Night
---
You got Mori’d didn’t you?
---
Blasphemy. Scream is an iconic horror movie.
---
They DC'd cuz he invis camped the first person he hooked.
---
Lol, I place the post and not even 20 seconds later, I already have 2 downvotes, people probably just saw the title and tought I was an idiot. Rather have them read the whole thing and then think I'm an idiot
---
I mean if you get less than 10k in a full match i dunno what you were doing.
---
That was a scene straight out of a horror movie lmao. 
---
\*the final girl escapes at the last second even though she should be dead\*
---
Yeah I've seen some posts about it, sounds really annoying if it happens often :c
---
No, I haven't played against a Nurse in a long while, in fact, I haven't played survivor in a long while. This is just a post I wanted to make for a while and on another post I saw someone defend Nurse in the same way, so thats the last push that got me to make this post
---
For a whopping 12K bloodpoints.  Is that even worth it honestly?
---
Just because one side did something crappy doesn't justify the other side doing the same thing they themselves didn't like to begin with
---
I mean, isn't the first one literally the only one without Jason, aka the one big reason why an indie horror film turned into a big franchise? Did Miller come up with Jason? 
---
Is he after the money making machine that is "Friday the 13th" or does he just want more than two sandwiches and a really disgustingly warm handshake for his involvement in the film that started all of it?
---
Nurse is bullshit but you cant nerf her without making her shit. Id be happy if they got rid of 3 blinks and omega blink though
---
If you look in the direction of the killer you can see their aura. But if they happen to look in your direction while you do that, they can see yours.
---
I used that streamer shirt with Dwight with the big ass target on your back.  The killer walked past me when I was hiding in some grass, but once he turned around he immediately saw me and my target hahaha
---
They need to update gate spawns too. I had one game I was the last person. The killer closes the hatch but you can see both doors from the same spot. They either need to have the hatch open again after a while or the doors clear across the map. Literally helpless if the killer finds you after they close the hatch.
---
That very last second innit?
---
As a killer main I actually feel sorry for you.
---
My survivor games have been much better since the change. People actually want to not only sit still and be healed but also stay after the unhook to heal cause they’re wanting to secure their token. 
---
Crazy how that conditioning settles in so early.
---
I've been wanting to make my own icons.... do you know of a way to access the perk icons with transparent backgrounds so you can just paste them over your own backgrounds?
---
although tbh it almost never helps out in the long run
---
I use Jane's full blue suit with her awesome hair down and while I may stick out like a sore thumb, I look damn good doing it.
---
Noice
---
You're safe as long as you didn't contribute to the glitch purposely, they know when someone does that and it's bannable
---
For a ton of people bm is part of the games' appeal, it doesn't affect gameplay and only requires you to not take the game so seriously.
---
I don't think there is any problem with bm existing.
---
Nurse is just hard to get into because she plays so differently, but she is pretty easy to get good at
---
Everything is a Spongebob reference.
---
How
---
It's mostly because survivors are really supposed to be skins, but Claudette being black, having access to dark clothing, and being smaller gives a very Pay to Win vibe on her.
---
Am I the only one who mutes @everyone and similar notifications in every Discord server? Otherwise my OCD and annoyance levels skyrocket to completely unreasonable and irrational levels.
---
Sounds like an immersed baby got found in their corner
---
I totaly agree with this. It's pretty sad to me how many people dissagree, she is the hardest killer to get into, but the easiest killer to learn
---
Come on it literally says in the post I play killer and think it's cheap
---
Yooo I especially like the sunset
---
Other killers also need to predict survivor movement, but they also need to loop and mindgame, nurse just blinks and hits
---
It all started quite early, when there was no hatch, we were at 2 gens left when second person died and only then the hatch showed up. A friend found it accidentaly at the other side of the map, I wouldnt have time to go there, and even if I did go, the gates were not powered, the friend couldnt escape so the hatch wouldnt open :/
---
We still have the Clown stomp, right?!
---
It ends the game, thats the point of it. Before a survivor would just hide at 4+ gens wasting time, hatch standoffs wasted time. Now the game ends.
---
Doesn't change that toxicity exists on both sides. It's shit that he did that and shit that he said ez though.
---
You are, because you're perfectly okay with the half dozen second chance crutch perks, SWF, and second chances EGC offers you. You want ezmode.
---
This is honestly my favourite skin they've made so far.
---
Now we just need the option to change how our throwing hatches look and I'll be happy forever.
---
You know what would be awesome? If that Mori would have an actual effect on the game. 
---
Two ideas.
---
Either you have a neat little vanity collection of Selfie Kills, where you can basically get an achievement for having selfie-killed all the different survivors in the game with a Mori. 
---
Or, killing a survivor with the Mori would create an actual add-on or offering for Ghostface for other games. Could be just a fluff version of, say, survivor pudding (since you do burn a Mori to get that kill and you also potentially waste more BP that you could've gotten from chasing and hooking that survivor)
---
Like I said thats why I perform longer unhook animations like i’m trying to unhook myself if no one is coming. You can tell the difference between spamming unhook every 0.5 seconds and performing a long unhook animation every 3 seconds.
---
They also stated they will never do a clown killer. They also stated they would never make a killer around religion. And here we are, lol. Who knows.
---
Uhm, don't just assume these things. This post is purely meant to say that Nurse acrually doesn't require the skill that other people claim she requires
---
I believe it's implied she killed herself after snapping and killing all her patients, then herself.
---
I dont think people deny camping killers exsist. Also what did you want from staying? To be let go? 
---
People that do this want to trigger people
---
Against randoms:  
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag, Huntress, Plague, Myres, Clown, Wraith, Leatherface, Legion, Doctor(really close to Legion), Trapper, Pig, Freddy.  
---
Against good players:  
---
Nurse, Spirit, Huntress/Hag, Billy, Plague, Myres...
---
The hatch was created by a survivor (Vigo) when he was experimenting with the entities powers. Why it keeps appearing is up in the air, but it wasnt the entity that put it there.
---
Welp then let’s just be hopeful then 😂🤷‍♂️
---
Its not cheap to get an instadown because someone is so immersed they wont move til they are literally bodyblocked. A billy,leatherface etc gets a free down why not plague?
---
The entity.
---
r/fOuNdThEmObIlEuSeR
---
Yeah, some can argue for real psychos like Frank, Clown, Myers, etc. but I believe Amanda also would qualify as a psychopath because she purposely put people through these awful traps knowing they were doomed to die, even in the Entity’s Realm she’s messing with the traps.  Tampered Timer? Box of Gears?  Jigsaw’s Sketch?  Most of her add ons can qualify as cheating to make the traps harder to escape
---
I don't think the gates should be really far away on most of the maps as any killer that isn't billy/nurse won't be able to defend the doors outside of endgame collapse.
---
I mean if the killer finds you then yeah you are dead, but that's kind of the point. If you win the run for the hatch you escape, if they close it before you get there then you are in a really bad spot.
---
I think that the biggest problem here is the waste of time. The killer will camp hatch instead of closing it, the killer will slug to see the animation/waste time. Imo the entity kill should happen immediately once the killer has downed the survivor, so that they can't stall it out. If the killer remains in close proximity to the hatch, the hatch will close automatically to prevent hatch camping.
---
What does object of obsession do? I'm somewhat new myself
---
Huh? I had a killer grab me out of it in a game recently when I inaccurately predicted that I could jump in before they came back.
---
Three months later. New killer is revealed, "The Shadow".
---
Sounds like every other killer who tunnels. It’s scummy but there’s nothing to do.
---
I rank Trapper really low because he needs a lot more setup time than Hag and has nearly no map control. In addition, his traps can also be much more easily avoided, and he's much more add-on reliant.
---
SYDNEY PRESTCOTT HERE WE COME
---
90% of people complaining about the nerfs dont even play pig so i find this funny
---
not really worth it tbh
---
The Blood is just on a new set of the Basic cosmetics
---
No, just tired of seeing the same stuff posted over and over: nerf nurse, nerf NOED, killer DC’d so I depipped.
---
These 3 things are posted every day. Kicking the fuck out of a dead horse and they just don’t merit legit responses anymore.
---
Yeah, I think there just needs to be some alterations to the EGC. Having hatch stand offs was annoying but now having essentially zero options if the gates are close isnt really better.
---
It is currently not worth to prestige. All you get is the bloody cosmetic per prestige level.  
---
It applies only on the cosmetic you are given after getting to the next level of prestige.
---
I’ve learned from this though, when that happens to me I’m body blocking the stairs.
---
Fun to face? Maybe for you. I kid you not, literally ALL the Billys I face run the same damn build. It always has to some variation of BBQ, ruin, enduring and fury. BBQ &amp; Ruin alone seem to be built into every Billy user. So fucking boring and predictable to face.
---
He can remove his terror radius and red stain and from what I seen, he can stay in this stealth mode untill he is spotted by a survivor, then his terror radius and red stain comeback.
---
As a pig main this infuriated me
---
18 naked cowboys at Lery's Hospital.
---
It’s bad because I can have games where I do 3 gens and get 2 saves while not seeing the killer at all and still don’t pip even in yellow rank.
---
Trapper makes 4
---
Yup, that’s exactly why. Play Trapper against good survivors and you’ll realize he’s basically a scuffed hag.
---
aaaaand you havent read/understood the Post
---
SC6 doesn't have Link ;-; I also thought the customization system wasn't broken and restricted. You can draw dicks on their forehead but you can't face morph or create custom clothes. I did like 2B and the man from Witcher though.
---
As a Russian I really want it to happen, because Michael is also translated as Тень in russian which means Shadow and there's literaly no other word for "Shadow" in russian. Personally I always though that they should've translate him as Силуэт (Silhouette) or at least as Фигура (Figure).
---
And they call us toxic?! Sorry survivors, but we wanna enjoy the game just as much as you do. If ya’ll are stupid enough to be right there when I hook someone, expect to get smacked!
---
Oh, the spins
---
Right? All the promotional art, especially the Hallowed Blight last year was fucking phenomenal.
---
I usually let one go so I don't pip up as fast, but only if they weren't a prick and they don't struggle. I'll even stand in front of a hook and if they struggle at all I'll throw 'em on.
---
And do your jumping-jacks on the hook right!
---
If the Killer is camping you do jumping jacks!
---
If the killer backs off stay still!
---
If the killer is away and no one is approaching, signal like you're GOING to kobe but release just shy of 100%!
---
Many of the newer players do it the other way around and no one saves them or unhooks them with the killer directly there because of that :/
---
What separates a good/god Nurse from an effective Nurse is how well you predict survivor movement after you lose line of sight. Which can take some time :)
---
I main Nurse because she is the best killer in the game and only one who can beat a coordinated SWF (which are more common in red ranks now after the ranking changes)
---
Wonder if EZ was a sarcastic joke and they laughed at it after game was done and op didn’t take pics of chat? Hmm
---
It's a circle of toxic, from both sides.
---
IDK about you guys but if we could get a map with trees like that. I would be in all in the map looks awesome if this is any reference to the map in game.
---
In the dev build they did also have a shard cost though that might be because it is the dev build. That devil head piece looks amazing though for the Ghost.
---
you dont get more BP from Distressing. You just get them faster
---
*surprised Pikachu*..............no u
---
WOW
---
Solid cosplay op :)
---
Underrated post
---
Damm thank you. That was close. Almost wastet them.
---
I feel like the killer hits should still grant stacks, tho the inclusion of more ways to gain stacks sounds pretty good.
---
I found the nea file, but what should I be looking for to extract the model?
---
&gt;I main Nurse because she is the best killer in the game and only one who can beat a coordinated SWF
---
No disagreements here.
---
&gt;What separates a good/god Nurse from an effective Nurse is how well you predict survivor movement after you lose line of sight.
---
True, but the same goes for other killers as well and I think Nurse has an easier time when it comes to getting survivors out of your line of sight
---
&gt;Which can take some time :)
---
Indeed, this takes some time, but not as long as it takes to become a god at looping, wich Nurse doesn't need to learn
---
(I love finaly getting a civil argument with someone. Most people just call me an entitled survivor main who want the game to be even more survivor sided and accuse me of using crutch perks)
---
As a survivor main, it does feel like a buff to the killer, but regardless, am happy it speeds up the game a bit
---
Goodbye pig HELLO GHOSTFACE
---
Step 2: figuring out mind games and not getting juked.
---
Bleh, I think if the hatch jump animation is starting that it shouldn't be able to be closed. Whats the point of removing grabs if closing it is literally the same thing but better?
---
you fool
---
Esports ready
---
Honestly the 3 person fixes alone have made this game so much more enjoyable.
---
OOOF huntress worst killer? Damn, poor Anna :(
---
Haven't seen something get *this buried* since Zack Ryder
---
If I saw this at the beginning of playing this game, I would have been better off.
---
I've also been getting a huge BP bonus over the last couple days. No BPS offering.
---
Playing on xbox.
---
Yea I think those ranks are close enough, minus the rank 2.
---
That's awesome. I don't have the money to get ash.
---
I REALLY HOPE THE SERVERS ARE LOCATIONS BASED. IREALLY HATE PLAYING AGAINST RUSSIANS, MANY DC BECAUSE THEY GET CAUGHT, ARE RUDE AS HELL, TERRIBLE CONNECTIONS AND DOESN'T BOTHER TO WRITE IN ENGLISH:
---
THE COOL I LOOK AT THE GROUND AFTER PICKING UP A TRAP FEATURE IS AMAZING
---
I got told this once when there were 5 gens left to do... 
---
This was after they DOSed me because of it to. Ruining the game for 3 other survivors.
---
Thinking about it, would actually hacking a savefile for 1.2.1 be bannable? If not, that would be a way to do it.
---
I don't like what I've seen here today
---
My personal tier list :
---
Billy/spirit (Billy is better against decent or bad survivors, spirit is better against good survivors
---
Huntress
---
Myers
---
Plague
---
Pig
---
Wraith
---
Trapper
---
Leatherface
---
Legion
---
Freddy
---
Not as far as I understand
---
No wasnt u, it was some person named comander702
---
He just sounds fun which is enough for me lol
---
Thing is pretty much every killer is better than  legion at this point except for maybe freddy
---
I like civil discussion :P Also i play both sides equally, most of my killer gameplay is on Nurse (Huntress 2nd, Wraith 3rd) but i play all killers except Legion because they're unfun, boring and way too easy. As survivor i usually either go with random perks or a looter build :)
---
[why did you repost your own GIF from a year ago?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/6qgtvc/best_axe_throw_world/)
---
Yeah that was unnecessary on his part.
---
I think the "survivors are the most toxic" part is a result of there being 4 survivors per match, so up to 4 chances for someone to play like an asshole. (In my personal experience, there's a max 1 or 2 people playing like assholes, but let's go with the worst case scenario &amp; say "up to 4.")
---
So either multiple people are playing like assholes, or the killer player gets frustrated by the person playing like an asshole &amp; won't stop focusing them (doesn't happen to everyone, but does happen to some people,) further exposing them to someone playing like an asshole. Whereas even if every killer plays like an asshole, you only have one killer per game max that can play like an asshole.
---
There's definitely a bunch of assholes on each side (and a bunch of good people, too,) but survivors are a more concentrated group in every match so it can feel more like it's All Survivors.
---
This is very good, r/Splatoon subreddit is doing something like this for a game mode of theirs. Anyways, these tips are good, it’s not telling people what to do in the game but how to do it.

P.S. does anyone know the number for the time penalty on generators when multi-players are working on it?

---
That's not how OP's system works..
---
I would say their story writing was pretty underwhelming in the beginning, but recent OG killers have had some good lore imo.
---
Flashlights are broken using the puppet though, they sort of get aimed into the floor by default and I can't seem to aim it high enough to get a beam. Any other glove works, just not the puppet
---
I don't know how to dumb it down any further. A 720 is 2 360s.. but it's a continuous motion which is what makes it a 720 degree spin..
---
I wish I was Jared, 19.
---
It’s been pretty good on Xbox.  Frame rate is pretty good, stable 60fps as survivor, pretty close as killer with minor drops from certain powers and events (such as gaining bloodlust) but nowhere near as bad as before.  Lobby wait times are pretty decent right now.  Biggest problems I’ve seen lately are the DC’s and hit latency.  As someone else already stated though, if they DC in the loading screen it cancels the game, so that’s good.  If you play with friends you don’t really have to worry about people DCing at all.
---
It's still insane she saw what was going on. I can't focus on guarding boxes as pig because of generator patrolling. Too much to pay attention to.
---
I had a full body orgasm when I saw Pig.
---
my only beef with Scream is that it’s not 3 hours longer

I had a feeling you'd be here

The fuck is Nea doing? Go do a generator you clementine.
---
WHY THE FUCK THE DEVS DONT IMPLEMENT THE OPTION FOR THE SURVS TO DC DURING THE EGC WITHOUT LOSING RANK AND BP?  YOU'RE BASICALLY ALREADY DEAD, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT 4 MINUTES DOWNED.
---
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN LESS THAN A WEEK AND I ALREADY LOST COUNT OF HOW MANY GAMES I DIED ON THE GROUND FOR THE KILLER TO SEE THE EGC ANIMATION WITHOUT THEM HOOKING ME.
---
It’s me on pc
---
Its not dumbing it down... You are just wrong... I am going towards the pallet, do a 360 spin and going towards the pallet again. 
---
Full circle... Full circle is 360 degrees = 1 spin.
---
720 would mean two full spins, because its 2x360... Please consult your maths and geometry books(the ones you find in elementary schools) and then come back, thx.

Hi guys, im using a very old, very basic video editing software, i dont know how to use it or any other, im self taught and i know my videos are cute in the way they are so early 2000's in feel, but theyre mine, what i will ask is that if anyone is here who is decent at this kind of thing, i would love for some input, some tips, some advice, because things like this come along and i cant do them justice, this happened and it feels cheesy haha, so please, let me learn from what you know.  
---
Context is i had some quitters, just like the game before and the 3 games before that, and the 5 before those when i was survivor, and i think the Entity grew tired and an audio bug happened, and i heard its voice, to be honest i feel honoured and im usually humble but this, this is my trophy, the entity itself spoke to me, and it felt good.
---
'Pointless drama'
---
JFC you are so aggressive why? it was an honest question? i was curious, i was not trying to start Drama, sit the fuck down and stop being so aggressive.
---
Just playing devils advocate here...but what if they ran this very specific build to counter the constant 4-man stacks with Adrenaline, DH/BL, MoM, BT with instaheals and such
---
Nooooooo!!!! :',','[
---
I had a bunch of D/C's last night and all those games I got bp and progression twords rituals. So idk maybe it's just a visual bug?
---
Sometimes if I feel like it. Depends on DCs and my mood.
---
For suvivor sure...its nice to have the skin lets you blend in easier. For killer i dont think so i dont really see a difference in rarity of items and such.
---
I just prestige the characters I really enjoy and to get the achievements. I take breaks every few weeks of this game so my character levels aren't high but right now I only have 3 characters prestiged (Jake, Trap, and Hunt).
---
Since release of the game this has always meant camping.  Waving your arms means you are waving off the save. Not sure why the influx of new players had to get this twisted. When I see waving arms and I'm a survivor,  I will not save you. Dont be stupid and wave when you're not being camped.
---
I'm still a newish player and trying to find a good balance between being TOO bold, or being TOO worried. Sometimes "not giving too much of a fuck" and staying on gens or not being scared to run from the killer works well, but other times so does staying crouched behind a barrel or a bale of hay. I suppose a good deal of it depends on the person playing the killer and their playstyle, and how savvy your teammates are (I keep getting the idiots that run to unhook someone when the killer is RIGHT THERE, and don't even have borrowed time).
---
I'd love to see something like this with tips and tricks for people who play killer. I'm still having a considerable struggle on both sides.
---
I guess that’s a good thing since she’s a killer 😂
---
Ah tis a shame.
---
I'm PC, good luck with your quest!

I'm one of those killers. The puppet is just so darn adorable.

---
They’re gonna change the power logo right? It’s just Myers...
---
Yes
---
The thing is, no matter what they do with your first blink, you'll be able to get them with your second blink.
---
That is a shame.
---
Well have a good weekend bud.
---
this aint a shitpost. issa documentary.
---
Sadly too many people sincerely believe that nurse requires skillz either due to huge lack of overall mechanical skills (20 hours is overkill, most people with shooter/race simulator experience will learn to blink good enough to wreck 90% of random survivors in 5-10 hours) or because they ego is based on indentifying themselves as "skilled gamer" , specifically "skilled" in playing nurse, often OMEGAblink or 3 blinks + noed variations, so this reaction to your post is expectable
---
Also to all these arguments about being counter to crutch and second chance perks, truly skilled and smart nurse with the most effective loadout completely overwhelms good parties even with maximum amount of second chances, all they can hope for is one person hatch escape
---
If the killer pulls their cord (as in kills their internet rather than quitting the game, or force quits it in a way that makes the game think it crashed) then survivors get no BP. At least, this is what I was told. I haven't tested this and cannot confirm or deny it, but apparently that's a thing.
---
For real, surprised me on the PTB and thought it had been fixed on live, but nope
---
Number 85 is my favourite
---
THat's what she's called, at least. I think the "difference" between "spirit" and "ghost" is that a ghost is confined to a certain area, item, person that they haunt whereas spirits can move and go freely (iirc).
---
Nah that's for wholesome content
---
I dont see any other killer ability that needs more skill than the nurse's
---
The only one i think would take a bit more skill is the spirit and thats because you cant see the survivors xD
---
yea ive used her a few times and i get wrecked every time.   
---
would love to use her more to get used to her, but at the same time i hate getting hosed.   I gotta try her out with my buddies  see if i can learn a few things.
---
This is true
---

---
You serious? I'll go over all the killers in a second, finishing a game against a Nurse first

Just wait to get to red ranks. Its constant 4 man groups who know every pallet loop, you have to learn how to fight againts it, but the moron survivor thing happens in rank 4. I had a guy tbag me for 2 minutes while I was hooked and his reason was '' I brough the killer to him'', I had no clue where he was and and even then, the killer stayed on me all game. 
---
Red ranks has killer or survivors gives me headaches because in 10 secs, my ruin is gone and 2 gens are done bf I find one person. a real pain
---
I don't know why this made me laugh so hard but it did. AT first I thought the dust pan was Legion because he's "garbage" but then I realized it was the pig and I got the stretch reference and was like "oh".
---
The spins killed me haha
---
3 urban evading p3 Megs and Claudettes have made me take a break from this game.
---
yeah same, i love the jigsaw films and even with the new cosmetics i just cant bring myself to play her, she really needs a rework
---
I THINK THAT ITS A GREAT IDEA THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. I THINK A GOOD IDEA TO GO WITH THIS IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE HOOKED PLAYERS AURA, YELLOW MEANS GOOD TO SAVE, RED MEANS GO DO GENS IMMA CHILL ON THE HOOK REAL QUICK.

Dude if they licensed this I would pay 20$ for that dlc

Yeah, I actually used to get really upset about BMing but now it does not really affect me(it bothers me sometimes but mostly I don't care). I realize that they're just trying to get you angry or get a reaction out of you for their enjoyment. Honestly what you described isn't even a BM imo, it's harmless and silly. Thanks for the advice!

Has happened to me as well, before the last patch. I was Doctor at the time.
---
Love it
---
How did you get off his shoulder when the wiggle meter wasn’t full?
---
YEAH WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THAT I GO BACK TO PLAYING TRAPPER AFTER THE UPDATE AND NOW FUCKING LOOKS DOWN AFTER EVERY FUCKING TRAP FOR NO FUCKING REASON. WHAT THE FUCK?!!!!
---
Meg Thomas “An athletic survivor”
---
Stunning throw
---
I've got a nurse friend on ps4 that can end the game in like 2 mins hes insane with her... but he let's me and my friends live. Lol
---
I think it's a great way to stop people from camping the hatch.
---
hahaha yeah, everything aside, maybe I should be impressed? :D
---
Well, mistake on my part was being seen in the first place in the area where was this box and where she just lost her chase. I was with the trap for some time already, so when she saw me she might've tried her luck by bodyblocking it and checking how I act. When I didn't go away, she realised it is the only one I need to check. 
---
Probably might have mindgamed her there, rushing away - she would think I still have other boxes to check and maybe she would leave this one. But that's too high level of mindgame for someone with bomb ticking on your head ;P 
---
BUT still, that doesn't explain how she spoiled her pip and bp gains for the rest of the match (she still had sooo many hooks and chases to do and gens to kick) only to secure a kill on me ;/
---
You must have a really bad headache
---
Since good teams won't cleanse, I don't think so.  
---
Would have to see it in practice, though.
---
I was hoping it'd be a shooting star meme
---
I play on ps4, And my experience with frame rate is overall very good, I don't really experience many problems, but a lot of other people claim to still have issues 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Dude I’m rank 3 killer, if gens are popping fast I’m doing bad at pressure. If someone is doing exceptionally good at loops they get 1 hit and I leave. Even like a 4 man good swf team I’ll at least black pip which I’ll take as a win lol. I also rarely camp or tunnel. Also I have a rule, I try not to hook the same person twice in a row. If you fucking run at me thinking you’re gonna dead hard and pull some sick moves. I probably know you have dead hard and get back on the hook bitch.
---
BUT SERIOUSLY HOW THE FUCK DO YOU SCREW UP ON A CHARACTER YOU DIDN’T EVEN CHANGE?
---
That'd actually be scary!
---
&lt;3
---
Oh, I thought you was talking about the 200% blood points nerf
---
Wtf, how did the exit gates close?
---
*cries in nurse*
---
As a killer I had closed it before in matches and I felt bad... then fist game yesterday morning I put hag traps around the hatch when I found it and completely forgot to just sit and wait to close it. The Dwight got away, I felt so stupid!
---
\*pop\* noice
---
Only two explanations
---
When timer runs out, all survivors are forced into a released state [shoved out locker, released from trap or flung from killer shoulder] so when timer ran out the survivor was released from killer's grasp instantly
---
Or if the killer picks up and drop the survivor too much the survivor will escape from grip even without wiggling. Each drop will give the survivor a boost to wiggle bar until bar is full and they instantly escape
---
If I can add them to my Steam screenshot folder, I'll become a GF main the day he's released, no matter how bad he is, because at that point I won't be playing for blood points, rank, or salt, I'll be playing for selfie trophies.
---
I’m just gonna imagine it’s as big as his regular weapon (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
---
Close it before they jump in then. Can't hatch camp if they HAVE to leave or have it be closed.
---
Dat spin zubSWEAT
---
Yup. When I see other survs waiving their arms I assume the killer is camping and avoid that area like the plague.
---
Stop posting same video ffs, it's damn annoying
---
If you want to upload some ghost's gameplay in order to get upvotes then go and record your own gameplay
---
Maybe I'm biased as a killer main, but having control over the Endgame is really really nice. I dont feel like I'm being pushed around by survivors anymore and can punish cockiness. Just my opinion though
---
As a survivor main, I totally approve of this. I've been waiting for the killer hatch close for sooooooo long. hatch standoffs are lame. Survivors either need to figure it out or die trying.
---
yea I don't see how fair this update is for a whoever finds it first wins scenario. The killer has an obvious advantage over the survivor with the combination of how long it takes for the 3rd person to die, killer being able to know where the hatch is preemptively most of the time, the killer's animation taking precedence over the survivor's animation, and closing the hatch triggering end game, so the EGC and NOED come into play instantly.
---
I feel the hatch should open as soon as the 2nd to last survivor starts dying, and/or whoever literally touches the hatch first should get it, I've seen several times where the survivor clearly starts jumping in only for the hatch to still close.
---
Ikr
---
It has been a long time since I have gotten a four man because I let them go
---
Not trying to get up votes, it is ignorant to think everyone has seen this footage... 
---
Really just trying to make sure people that are casual Redditor's can see the information.
---
This gave me a laugh. Best editing NA.
---
Naw I agree with that but now killers just camp hatch and wait for survivor. And if there are 5 gens left that’s gonna be a long wait to 99% 5 gens. I’m saying let killers close the hatch but punish those who just sit on it by making it easier for a survivor to escape
---
The spirit got me, holy shit lmao
---
Also I am rank 3 killer on ps4 and rank 7 survivor lol. I prefer killer tbh. I get face camped and tunneled too much as survivor and that’s just not a fun game to me.
---
I respect that
---
The best part is that Meg still escaped
---
Lots and Lots of pallets, Make some thicker ones too!

---
LF: The golden chainsaw " Chainsaw dash duration is increased by 4 seconds."
---
That's the point. To change the metal surrounding the endgame. 
---
In this clip, it would have been smarter for David to run off to a gate somewhere instead.
---
Honestly I'm thinking it's a marketing strategy at this point. Saying it's a leak makes the info spread like wildfire lol
---
No. I think most are at least in their 20s.
---
Imagine getting downvoted for not wanting to prestige
---
Trust me i’ve gone against a few brilliant Nurses, who probably had a good laugh at my Dead Hard and DS giving me an extra 5 seconds 😂
---
When I think of a killer's ability requiring skill, I think of the killer needing to make tough choices. Do I use my ability or don't I?
---
With trapper and hag, it's regularly the best option to break chase and place some traps
---
With hillbilly and leatherface you need to learn when you rev your chainsaw and often need to chose to chainsaw or to go for a regular hit
---
With Nurse, you just blink. Only time you make a choice is when you don't see a survivor directly, and you always have your backup blink
---
I get this too. I play more survivor than killer, though. When I'm survivor I get a bunch of thumb-suckers that try to unhook people when the killer is right next to them, suicide on the hook, hide and not work on the gens, or just disconnect on the first hit. 
---
When I'm the killer? I seemingly get groups of 4 SWF who can juke me like no tomorrow and leave me with next to no blood points.
---
It's really hard to learn what to do and what not to do on either side when nobody is willing to play a legitimate game for you to understand it.
---
Hag and the stealthy killers
---
True also she has ambush, easy for her to choose who to kill.
---
Killers do give you the hatch quite often if you get stuck in trash rounds like that. But I have no idea what that ash was doing lmao. I've seen people ragequite many times before but that was pretty stupid to have 2 people suicide instantly.
---
Why you waste p a l l e t  :(
---
I guess the killer felt bad due to the shit you were dealing with. I do that woth survivors too, there are plenty of nice people in this game, toxicity just outshines the goodness
---
Absolutely no point in prestige, waste of a lot of bloodpoints. You pay 1000000+ bloodpoints for a bloody skin which you never gonna use. Better use those points getting good shit from bloodweb.
---
Yea. But they need to have a new skin for Laurie that turns her into Danny Trejo too lol
---
give grandpa mikey
---
No, it isn’t ignorant with the like 40+ times it’s been posted. I’m sure everyone who wants to see it has seen it at least a dozen more times than they planned to.

**Nurse:**  
---
Fragile Wheeze:  
---
Adds 1 additional Chain Blink.  
---
Ataxic Respiration:  
---
Considerably increases the maximum range of the Blink.  
---
**Hillbilly:**  
---
Iridescent Chains:  
---
Allows you to keep chainsawing after hitting a survivor at a greatly reduced speed and dealing half damage.  
---
**Huntress:**  
---
Rubber-Head:  
---
Ricocheting hatchets. Adds 2 hatchets
---
I don't understand quite how it works either.  I'm rank 15 killer and constantly being put against rank 8 - 10 survivors now.
---
It released 17 hours ago. Not even a full day, lol you make me laugh
---
How is that possible when the killer and survivor are on the hatch when it opens?  The survivor literally hatch camped in the clip. Am I the only one who watched it?
---
I never DC against swf, it's more fun facing a stupidly altruistic group than randos
---
The Nurse add-ons will obviously replace the existing ones :)
---
The nightmare got me. I laughed a bit too loud
---
My problem with Trapper is it seems his traps always get disarmed and don't do anything
---
I've been seeing other survivors just standing at the gates, knowing that it's coming and waiting for it to start so they can bail and not even bother with the other survivors. Ouch. :(
---
&gt; I feel the hatch should open as soon as the 2nd to last survivor starts dying
---
That would help.  The EGC is a huge killer advantage when it's the final survivor.  The killer can freely look for the hatch as well, whereas the survivor really can't, so giving the survivor a little bit of a time advantage is probably not a bad idea.
---
What does that mean?
---
The white Pig Mask :DDD
---
We might not be that altruistic haha might just let a teammate die for the fun...but then I'll need to take a shot haha
---
Literally just watched scream for the first time last night  due to the hype. Instantly rewarded with your joke. Thanks reddit.
---
I know people also wanted Brenda from scary movie, but I totally have respect for Sydney and would take her first for survivor now.
---
Infectious Fright isn't too bad on him either. Gives you a target to chase after downing someone with EW3.

30 seconds recharge time. And I saw on Paulie Esther's video that his stealth mode doesn't go down when nobody sees you. So you can activate stealth mode and remain without terror radius untill you are spotted by a survivor. And his stalk is faster than Shape's stalk, especially when he leans around corners.
---
I dont play console but I would imagine an aim assist for the hatchet throwing would be needed.

Well...if she had we´ll make it then she most likely uses it on a regular basis,so she is used on healing the one she unhooked.

it's definitely improved. Certain maps are still troublesome, but overall a much better experience. Now they just need to fix the sound.

I don't know it seems his crouch and peeking seem tacked on

its gotta be before the line is fully completed, most commonly used for stomping on survivors as clown or sledge wacking as cannibal

**New Perk: Manipulate**

The Entity pities your poor chasing ability. The more you double back and respect pallets, the more powerful this perk becomes.

Once per chase, **slightly/greatly/tremendously** manipulate space and time to ensure you win the chase.

Yeah, hasn’t been posted at all before.

---
The myers has a rank 3 plague perk and she hasnt even been out for two months yet. There's also only been one rank reset in this time meaning that if they were high rank they wouldn't have been put all the way back to rank 20 from one reset.

This is a brilliant infographic. BHVR please hire this man to create tutorials.

You can see them a bit in the first skin too :D

Thanks, I really needed to hear that

I just wanted to tell you that I really appreciate these renders that you do!

They really help build up the hype and convince me to purchase certain skins.

I tried it on Xbox One X after this mid chapter patch and it’s better than ever.

Thicc boy clown is s tier everyone else is aight i guess

I love the trapper with the lego thats perfect!
---
I’m not mad about anything lol. I said it doesn’t need to be reposted dozens of times. You made a stupid retort, so I posted 8 links of essentially the same thing you posted (all in less than a 24 hour period mind you) to prove my point. Stop getting butt hurt over it. You’re acting like you’re doing some kind of public service by posting it again (you’re not). I pointed out that it’s been done to death and provided links. Get over it.
---
Seems like a normal game to me.
---
Did you end up living?
---
Lmao, video was already pretty great then you started spinning the hatched then it became amazing!
---
He was waiting for the hit to not get grabbed. The survivor didn't know that you can't get grabbed anymore. The op said thats what he was told by the survivor.
---
I use bbq monitor spirit and enduring
---
Billy is not OP, you can loop him as any other M1 killer, he can just punish mistakes better than others killers with his instant down and he also has map pressure, unlike others M1 killers.
---
i thikn there was an eye i messed it up i think i removed it as it was just black.

I am so glad i have read your comment
---
so?
---
4 man groups are 3-6 % of survivors. Don’t exaggerate it too much.
---
If you can't find a generator, look up! Most maps have generators with flashing lights over them. Completed generators lights will be fully illuminated.
---
Deja Vu is a great perk for finding generators, and will help prevent having the last three generators be too close together.
---
They need to remove Mori cancelling cause it is the strongest case of holding the game hostage now
---
I know killers aren't able to grab survivors off the hatch mid-animation anymore, but can they still close it with the animation going on?
---
This scenario makes it look like it's possible, but I believe it was just your client registering the hatch closing first, right?
---
Sorry:(
---
Yeah autohaven is crazy
---
I'm the new community manager. I only started last month, no worries. Before that I was an ACM, and before that I was a moderator since the beta.
---
I havent thought that far ahead but an idea could be to do with his balloons and maybe work like a trap like the hag. Maybe he could appear when the balloon pops because a surviver is near and he can tp to it or just be alerted and it pops blood onto the survivor slowing them down. Just a thought. Just see the new IT chapter two trailer and thought he would he a cool addition
---
Same here. I personally just say "fucking it, it's just a game" and try to rescue anyone left behind...unless, of course, we're talking bubba's basement. I won't give bubba the satisfaction.
---
Survivors between rank 15 to 20 are pretty brainless lol.
---
Myers is hot garbage against survivors who pay attention. He would be balanced if gen speed wouldn't been so fast. Billy is fine. He shouldn't be nerfed because he is already not too great against good survivors. If you nerf him, then everybody would play just Nurse and Spirit at red ranks. And trust me, you have more chances at winning against a good Billy than against a good Nurse or good Spirit.
---
&gt; keep a mental note on what perks the killer is running. The killer is only allowed 4 perks maximum and while you dont know what they are initially; you can guess them based on the killers behaviour and use this info to plan your next move. Obviously, red ring of death is a clear sign of Ruin. Is the killer heading straight for you after hooking a survivor? Probably has BBQ. Is the killer coming for you when you start working on a gen? Probably has surveillance or discordance. Also, unless you know for sure, always assume the killer has NOED.
---
This also goes for killers versus survivors, especially in regards to Exhaustion perks. Pay attention to the behavior of survivors in chases. Are they running for hills or the second floor of a structure first thing in a chase? Balanced Landing. Are they walking or sitting on a generator until the very last second when you're about to hit them? Sprint Burst. Did they just dart forward to dodge a hit? Dead Hard. Compensate in future chases to end them faster by cutting off their pathing or waiting a bit longer to attack.
---
Other perks have telltale markers as well. Are they running directly up for saves right after you step away for an unhook? Borrowed Time and WGLF. Are they they Obsession, most likely MOM, but also likely to be DS, so plan for an extra hit and wait to pick them up if hitting them after they get unhooked. Many survivors run their default perks as well, so look for Nea players to be crabwalking around corners with Urban Evasion and always pick up and hook a Bill ASAP to deny Unbreakable.
---
Mother's dwelling has some nice pallets iirc
---
I also like nurse's and clown's maps
---
that wasn't mindgame, that was bombgame + Amanda knows her games x,D
---
It isn’t impossible to beat. You just have to get that bloodlust or mind game. I have a feeling that these people have over 1k hours on survivor and decided to play killer for the first time.
---
I don't think I would have made it to 100 hours if I believed pallet looping what toxic/OP. I guess some people are masochists.
---
Upvote for the effort
---
Im sure im wrong but was Queen community manager before? If so, where did she go?
---
Also thanks, and nice to meet you.
---
I can probably make a colorblind version if people want. Would removing the background images and changing the text to white be enough?
---
I suspect it was actually Ashy Slashy speaking all along, and now that there's an item in his mouth, he can't speak. Think about it, no other survivor can speak, why would Ash be able to?
---
Wake up, sheeple!
---
No but for real, that's a bug, we'll look into it.
---
Someone dropped their M&amp;Ms in the lobby.
---
Depends when the last time was that you played OP.
---
There was a good performance patch sometime around the spirit or legion release I think where it was significantly better. Still some minor tweaks with more recent patches too.
---
This is based on my xbox experience. Game used to tank whenever I used Nurse Blink, Myers Tier 3 or just gaining bloodlust. Which was obviously horrible and resulted in many lost survivors. I found skill checks were harder back then too.
---
ahhhhhwww man.... and here I thought I had another nice killer for monitor... :D
---
Some people are just incapable of believing that they’re doing something incorrectly or not as well as they could

She still is. She's the Lead Community Manager, actually. We've got a team of three in the office and a couple regional CMs around the world.
---
Oh I commented halfway through the gif lol. Learned my lesson and won't do that again.
---
I like how you still bothered to recover before crawling towards hatch.
---
Fair enough haha
---
Oh thank goodness i thought something happened lol, brilliant hope you 3 enjoy your work, I'm sure you already do.
---
As much as I loved that it was only like 1 note.
---
Yes, he have easiest one hit to land, and most people play immersed, so if they get found, they are getting down in seconds, but against good survivors his chainsaw is useless, and he is left with his basic m1 attack. And again good survivors will not go down against basic m1 killer easily. He can be frustrating, but one thing will help you counter him - git gud. You won't win against him running urban evasion. You have to learn how to loop.
---
That steam message sound got me fucked up.
---
Exactly. This is the first game I've played in which people make such a big deal out of BM-ing.
---
he looks like that guy from courage the cowardly dog
---
I'll try and do a colorblind friendly version and link it when I post the killer version since a handful of colorblind users have brought it up.
---
Then when someone gives you shit after a game you can send them the picture of you murdering them :)

I most likely won't get it but I like how it looks.

Most likely they couldnt get the license to use the outfit.

"Retuuurrrnnn the flasshhhligghttt...."
---
I've also noticed a ton more camping and short range hook patrolling than usual. Have just countered by focusing on gens. If they're sitting at the hook, they aren't stopping me from chilling with my M1 down. Boring but whatever.
---
I have also noticed survivor queue times are WAY up at purple/red ranks.
---
Except that's a lie cause the guy jumped in immediately.  Clearly shows as soon as the hatch opens he starts the jump animation.  He's probably trying to cover up the horrible play.
---
susie would like a word
---
Did flip phones have front facing cameras?
---
Always appreciate a good kobe.

Just play nurse lol
---
Niiiice! Reminds me a bit of "The Ritual" movie.
---
I'm new to the game, almost 2 weeks in so I'm still learning. :(
---
That’s not my point! Pallet looping isn’t a hard thing to deal with
---
The Game probably has the safest Pallets
---
Yeah I really don't understand why they didn't just do that. Why nerf a perk in every situation because of that one specific situation where they think it's too powerful, instead of just addressing that situation in particular?
---
Still never got why people get legitimately tilted over tbagging. This is going to be so great haha.
---
Can't say until he is officially released how fast he is or if he will stay that speed or not
---
It's nice to be able have the survivors and the killer's mercy now though. Before Egc it was we'll stay for as long as we like just tee bagging, run around in circles, and keep flicking flashlights while you watch. Now the killers can do it too.
---
Not sure how you can make a purely comp game casual. 
---
Like aside from "everyone gets to hold hands and escape together" it wouldn't work.
---
and the "split the high ranks from the low and never let anyone change the ranks" 
---
i could so easily drop ranks and just abuse this system.
---
The two ones at the basement are great. The others meh
---
Her most common add ons are her best, really sad for a pig main such as myself
---
Wait what?
---
I have no idea what he was doing either. The only thing I could even remotely guess was he was waiting for everyone else to do the work then bail if the killer initiated endgame.
---
This was the first time I was lead to the hatch but maybe I'll find more nice killers in the future.
---
Sad oink
---
Soon we will learn lol.
---
Prick. (That's Wes Craven, BTW)
---
Yeah I've seen some pretty cool and understanding killers, and survivors that like to mess around too. It's just a bit rarer for me to see than the tryhards or people who would rather die and not care.
---
I don’t get the pig’s one... am I dumb?
---
In his latest kill count for the Texas chainsaw massacre during he said "putting them on the hook for the entity" when leatherface...well put a person on the meat hook
---
Just break the pallets and move on, right?
---
I second that claim. What in the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land
---
Don't do it again!
---
Or the Pig will put a RBT on your head and Oink at you.
---
Yeah, but I think they might mean before the pallet is dropped but idk, I saw posts talking about making so survivors are slowed after vaulting a pallet over and over, like ugh these people are complaining about game balance when they’re ideas are so bias
---
Imagine a photobomb of teammate. Hell yeah would be a great mori tho
---
I don't get why everyone needs to have these unspoken rules, if it's my job to kill 4 people, I'm going to do and take whatever is going to help me do my job. Same goes for survivors with surviving, but it's always "omg bro you ran (insert perk here) that's so toxic, crutch perk baby killer" or "bro you stayed in the area i got hooked in for 0.2 seconds after hooking me wtf camperrr"
---
If so this will be a sad oink.
---
Amazing work, thank you! BHVR take my money!
---
Jason is in Friday 1. He’s not the machete wielding maniac that we know and love, but he exists in the movie. Technically Victor Milller created the character, which future screenwriters made into a murderer.
---
As far as I know Victor just wants his slice of the pie he feels he was denied. He doesn’t want to impede on the franchise’s progress or anything, he just wants his share.
---
Swamp is ugly
---
10/10
---
I got a pallet that was up against a closed wall. If you didn’t do the gen then it led nowhere.
---
It’s the same “safe zone” that prevents Amanda’s traps from priming if you put them on while in the gates.
---
HOW
---
There truly was no other option.
---
Oh mah gahd dont kil ghost boi ples
---
Change direction means just run one way for 4 seconds(or 5 just to make sure) then run the other way, doesn’t matter which killer
---
Her ultra rares are pretty bad for the rarity that they are
---
Oh jeez, I didn't realize the survivor coughs up blood when ghostface lifts their head up. That's pretty disturbing.
---
I'm sure its been posted a million times, but the window vault on the tiny boat on Backwater Swamp gets you stuck for a second or so as killer if you're vaulting from the deck of the boat to the outside. Not sure if this affects all killers, tested with Billy on PC.
---
Make the yellow mori  (last survivor can be mori'ed baseline during EGC). They'd rather Mori you and be gone then watch you crawl around for the EGC to kill you.
---
Basic jist of it is that Pig when crouched looks enough like a survivor that it's a disguise and survivors will fall for it. Here she's a pan and brush disguised as a roomba. 
---
...It's a stretch. I couldn't find anything better for her besides a generic knife.
---
This. I absolutely loved your Legion renders. I was sold the minute I saw them.
---

I love spine chill, just don't get too comfy before you know what killer it is as Myers t1 is immune to it. I had to learn that the hard way so you don't.
---
After constant tea bagging, hate messaging post game, and constant taunting. I find it reaaaallly hard not to close the hatch in front of someone who was taunting the whole game. But I don't, but it's nice to know that I could do it.
---
Its cool dude, i just remain clear and open in my posts otherwise things get messy, personally i get annoyed at tbagging, i theorize that i choose to in some way even if i dont want to, i think its because in my life ive taen practice into being better but also i never logically understood intentionally bringing bad feelings/energy into other peoples loves when it serves no purpose, also tbaggin is usually done in complete safety so i see it as cowardly, its like going into a boxing  ring and getting the piss wailed out of you then getting a lucky wild hook in and winning by TKO and then gloating  like "haha whata bitch bring me a real challenge", it doesnt make sense and people choose to do it so it makes me believe they are horrible spiteful people.
---
Theres my thoughts :)

BBQ is not a necessity

Ah ok makes more sense now lol

Reading first line made me a bit salty before reading the rest.

but yes this perk is crutch for BP

How is it a crutch perk?

Oooh, I thought Pig was a dust pan because of her recent patch.
---
You have get downs with deep wounds applied to them so just use your power for 1st hit follow up with a normal m1
---
I don't know why either. I'm personally looking forward to Ghostface teabags, I think they'll be hilarious and will make me laugh more than anything.
---
Devs put taunts/emotes in PvP games for a reason.
---
Same with Billy, I slam into walls a good 70% of the time.
---
Mate i stumble all the time, i turn into a disgustingly behaved person just like the rest of us, but i remember who i want to be, this is life and its for gaming too.
---
But i know man, they can be horrible, so horrible so often.
---
Well what’s a survivor supposed to do with no gens done? Just lose? And this way if the killer really wants to win they can close hatch and check doors, bad killers and loses bad survivors will lose
---
So, just the regular game but worse?
---
Please god, if Jason was in the game that's all I'd ever play
---
I love you daddeh
---
I mean it kinda fishy that it didn't spin that much. Might be fake
---
Åink.
---
Slower.
---
WELL THISLL PROBABLY BE THE ONLY TIME I GET CLOSE TO RED RANKING EVER SO ITS WORTH STEALING HIS PIPS. ;)

Because if it is funny, then it gets tagged as a shitpost.

Yes faster generators = faster games!
---
Fun fact : if you bump into a doc clone, it will disappear.
---
obviously
---
It me. I've achieved competency of some variety with pretty much every other Killer on the roster, but the second I get a Nurse ritual I garbage-can that thing immediately.
---
Cuz that’s not how it works
---
It's also a pos move to let your teammate die on hook so you can get hatch? If someone doesn't wanna be a team player they can't expect their teammates to be one either

Platform:  PC
---
Type of Bug: Audio
---
Description: After hooking a survivor and then that survivor is rescued, the hook continues to play the entity “creaking” sounds as if the entity’s tentacles are still there. 
---
Steps to reproduce: Hook and then unhook any survivor. 
---
Expected result: The sounds should cease when the survivor is unhooked. 
---
Actual result: The audio continues playing. 
---
Reproduction rate: 90% or so, not certain if it occurred when I was playing huntress.
---
Can’t use sprint burst

Who would've known rank 20 survivors are bad! Wait until red ranks buddy

"Hag Titty" made me laugh but also scarred me
---
Still waiting for the Drag Race DLC
---
yep
---
I don’t want to argue but I didn’t get her caught because I was salty that I got caught, I actually went down pulling her off the hook. 
---
I got her caught because she did nothing all game then left me to camp the hatch when I was on my first hook.
---
Get off this fucking sub
---
Good way to put it
---
I mean if you're referring to end game, the killer interaction is Space Bar (or the secondary interaction button) so it's not really equivalent anymore. Before EGC, yeah, I see your point.
---
Sometimes even gods work can be done for him.

---
agreed
---
Love the editing btw man
---
I’m whelmed.
---
Well a higher percentage of people are going to pick the thing that gives them the best chance to win at any given video game.  In sports games people are going to use the best teams, the best guns and load outs in shooters, and best fighters in fighting games etc.  If they nerfed this killer/build whatever, people would just find the next best combo, and you would see that over and over and it would become stale.
---

---
Cool now do shirtless clown with nipple piercings
---
Honestly they should make the accuracy actually matter and add in a larger factor for accuracy so it’s not a pinpoint blink most the time.
---
You need to get more teachables, but I'll try and see what non-teachable builds I can make.  
---
Doctor:  
---
Desired - BBQ &amp; Chili, Enduring, Ruin, Spirit Fury  
---
Non-teachable - Distressing, Sloppy Butcher, NOED(If you feel like you need it), Discordance.  
---
Hag:  
---
Desired - BBQ &amp; Chili(for BP), Make Your Choice, Haunted Grounds, Ruin/Corrupt Intervention.  
---
Non-teachable - Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, NOED(if you feel like you need it), Third Seal/Thrill of the Hunt.  
---
I'd recommend focusing on getting BBQ &amp; Chili, as it helps with getting insane amounts of bloodpoints per game. Then Enduring, as it is one of the best perks for M1 killers. I would then focus on getting Ruin and Spirit Fury.
---
Why'd they made the character's makeup look so bad in the original. 😬
---
The map is nice, Auras just suck and all the perks are pretty good

That seems pretty fair, yeah.

Hey uhh... mods?? lmao
---
I suppose i left out some context, I nearly instahealed her not to long before she saved me, so she saw I had it. And i got her off of me and started healing her and she wouldnt stop getting off to heal me, then she ran away for no reason, I followed her and she just self cared in front of me.
---
Move away from the hook, it glitches it out
---
That's only possible if you get a pretty late skillcheck, I believe a 4-o'clock would happen before the hook action.
---
I mean the whole game is casual mode
---
Ah i see, thanks so much! I didn't realise level 50 was indefinite
---
I'm sure you will.
---
Guess she's just big dumb.
---
A for effort
---
Pls no  
---
Kthx
---
Get lost, internet thug. Mods, please take care of this shit-stain.
---
As a killer, looping is not toxic, running an infinite is not toxic. Blinding is not toxic (and its not op either, its just annoying)... I mean, after all the survivor is supposed to... survive. What I take as toxic is tabagging after throwing a pallet, that shit gets me ticked but I'm starting to learn that they only do it for attention and if you ignore them they start to nunb down.
---
But Peanits, I don't have a lot of time to play between work and school and being a single mom, will I be able to purchase premium creatures with my Auric Cells?
---
Holy shit, I need to get back into this game.
---
I mean. Some of the mods of this subreddit are gay. I foresee a ban in your near future.
---
You shouldn’t insta heal like that tho, it’s a waste and she has no way of knowing it’s an insta heal
---
I was kind of curious to see if it would do that but that hatchet actually downed me earlier and just stayed there spinning (somehow hit me through those 3 trees which have collision so...)
---
Don't worry, someone else will put on the mask before the new chapter goes live.

The devs acknowledged that there have been some issues with cosmetics, so hopefully this gets fixed soon.

/4 of the way thru her bar got an autodidact check and it was about 90% immediately. So she knew i had auto, then she healed me after and I was already half healed bc of solidarity. If she paid any attention she knew what my build was

Dude, just let the unhooker heal, it makes sense, then you can heal afterwards, it doesn’t make the heal any slower

---
I definitely wouldn’t call it a fair thing to do. But...I really feel like way too many killers think every swf group is some kind elite special forces team.
---
Anyways, my answer to question two is to make solo queue have some of the advantages of swf built in, and balance the game around that.
---
I do agree to a point but also think of the amount of games that have repeating voicelines. Yeah they get a little annoying but at least you have different killers so you don't have to deal with it. Or even an option toggle to turn voice lines off.
---
oh yeah! james plays dbd on stream sometimes.
---
NO. The devs of the game specifically covered this in a developer stream. They also clarified the false narrative/outright lie of SWF not being intended to be in the game.  It was always intended to be in the game,  but they had issues trying to implement SWF into the matchmaking process,  so it was delayed upon launch.
---
I've been apart of random groups the have destroyed killers. A swf team is just a group that can run and play extremely efficient. Some people say swf groups dont necessarily make them good but when they are they are really good and they go out of their way for there friends survival. I think its inherently harder to play killer against them and they should get that advantage in ranked matches. It's why we need casual matches.
---
Killers like him will use any excuse to camp. Chatting isn't cheating, though depending on how try-hard the survivors are, it can be a little unfair sometimes
---
Yeah, that's 100% fair.  You're a big nasty domineering killer.  You're supposed to have control.
---
Thanks! &lt;3

My *Hex: Suspension of Disbelief* has been cleansed.

You guys are lucky. I lost moment when i could extract models from the wrong patch(

Or the content still inside?

Such an underrated perk. Combined with iron will you can escape chases really easily especially on lerys
---
The only microtransactions are skins. Do you expect to not pay for DLC? Lmao. Are the devs supposed to spend all their time and energy creating new characters for free? What do you expect?
---
Not for long!
---
ill update the post thanks for reminding me
---
practise giving head
---
Not her brother in this lore
---
Wouldn't it be to op?
---
I know right.
---
haha 2019 is the time to be woke more than ever
---
yeah, agreed. if it's going on too long you have to just bite the bullet and get pallet stunned, destroy it, and hope for better luck on the next chase. at least that's how i've been doing it.
---
I feel pretty hindert if I Kill the guy who knows where my Totem is and it gets instantly cleansed. But it really isnt cheating
---
I check that part of the map everygame I play that map. I play killer , so i know how dangerous it can be ;) .
---
I never expect players to not communicate if they're grouped up. Personally I don't give any specific information besides whether or not the killer is close to my hook, but that's just because I like my friends to stay nervous about who the killer is and stuff.
---
As a killer it can be frustrating when communication is clearly happening. It makes perks like Third Seal almost worthless despite being fun against randoms. The only time it feels truly like cheating is when you're playing Trapper and every survivor knows the location of every trap.
---
I mean it depends what time frame, in the original Scream they didn't even have camera phones.
---
I was going to comment I remember this gif, no wonder
---
is this a joke?
---
* Platform: Xbox One
---
* Type of bug: ingame
---
* Description: completed 3 generators from 0 progression to 100% progression by myself. Scored 655 points for objectives but still earned iridescent lightbringer for 118% generator repair and 19% totem cleansing.
---
I'm not sure if I'm understanding you correctly, but would a potential solution, in this case, be matching SWF teams against a killer who is a couple of ranks above them to partially negate their teamspeak advantage?
---
I don’t recommend going out onto the internet without being connected to a VPN, that includes while playing multiplayer games.
---
well yeah, but it only goes on for super long if you get caught on an object or respect the pallet
---
Once you get to like rank 12 that's where it starts getting to survivors who know how to play.
---
I tell myself I'll learn her!... then get bord of her playstyle and go back to other killers
---
An issue I cant pinpoint is that I seem to frequently get hit through windows and pallets, yet when I play killer, the survivors have a VERY small window of time where they're able to be struck after vaulting.
---
Them: *vomit blood*
---
Q&amp;Q, Head On, Dance With Me, Lithe
---
I think DbD should have something like an in-game chat that gets louder of softer based on how near survivors are to one another, and killer can also hear it if close enough.
---
Is anyone ever going to mention how off the robes are for ghostface? I thought I’d see at least one comment by now
---
He made this gif look at his history, I don't really know why he reposted it but probably because the community is bigger now.
---
Wow I literally have none of those unlocked for all characters... oof
---
What a stupid question
---
Lmao well done
---
Yeah sure like i am faster then the killer.....
---
Also, when killed by a clown, he grabs his left hand instead of the puppet.
---
teabag away. but don't expect me to stay in the game while you do that.
---
Must be my rank, I don’t try to get any higher because I switch between killer and surv. when playing or if it gets stale. But it makes me sad playing survivor these days. Even people in pre game chat can be awful, right off the bat LOL
---
Not that easy when Billy and Nurse can go door to door quick af
---
They said right now its hard to track since the Killer is the host. With dedicated servers they will be able to pinpoint DCs a lot better. I am eagerly awaiting that punishment wave :)
---
Yeah, the lowest ranking match is indeed shitty, solo killers should not have to deal with this. Funny thing is, I don't think it was like that before? I remember playing with friends when they were ranks 1-5, while I was rank 15 back in Dec-Jan 18/19 - and we would always get killers on their ranks, not on mine. Now even if the bf and I are both ranks 11-12 - we still somehow get matched against a rank 15. That's awful.   
---
And yeah, you're right about the 1-5 ranks, sorry. I've been on ranks 11-12 for so long - I've forgotten anything even exists above 8 :P
---
This person clearly never recieved enough love growing up
---
I really hope so.
---
Till he gets way lower in the ranks, he wont know true pain
---
i agree but neither should have ever been a thing. i don't care about the standoff now. what bothers me is that killers can hold you in the game now for the entity to kill you. like if you find me just kill me. but killers now are doing this to make sure people die by the entity. that's the same bm killers complained about and now that they have the chance they do it themselfs
---
Yes, you're right, that is an important issue. I promise to respect your totem in an SWF and will ask my teammates to do the same ✋
---
I mean technically Freddy and Wraith are magical creatures. Magical doesnt mean Child Fairy tale. The Entity itself is magical, he can grant immortality and create realms
---
Voice Chat isn't cheating, but gives the survivors a huge advantage.
---
I was very pissed off for a second, because I thought u were the guy I'm discussing something with in another subreddit and your comment seemed rude in the context lol
---
But yeah! I was very pleased that she didn't get the hatch.
---
So now DBD collabs with the Winx Club?
---
Who the hell spells against "agains't"
---
It's okay, if I were an incel, I'd be mad, too.
---
And here we have a classic case of Stockholm syndrome! Joking of course but it feels like with this game its applicable for its community.
---
The community is insanely bad and its surprising it managed to get this bad.
---
Looks like the most logical line of play in that situation to me
---
I’m gonna be perfectly honest with you. I have no sympathy whatsoever for survivors whining about this. They had the guaranteed hatch escape for so long that everyone just accepted this as part of the game. It’s really just a dumb mechanic.
---
If you want the hatch, you beat the killer to it. This is called balance my dude. As a bonus, killer doesn’t even win if he gets hatch because you get free powered up gates. So you get a second chance after your second chance of escaping after you failed the trial.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
I was maining killer for a good while and I would be in green ranks and I'd get matched with reds and purple ranks because they had one green in the group. It's really awful. I think it's the matchmaking. It actually will link you up with whoever if you have been waiting long enough. I have been playing survivor in green ranks with all green teammates and get put against rank 2 killers. I ask those killers how they think that happens and they basically just tell me they have been waiting a really long time for a match. They dont think it's fair and we dont either. They need to rework the pip system because the red ranks have abysmal match wait times.
---
The entity is more god-like and i would say wraith n freddy are demonic, not really magical per say but when i hear "magical" i instantly think child-like  but maybe that is just me but who honestly thought this was good idea? Killer are already pressed for time as is (in ranks starting in yellow) n really dont have time to go searching for bugs to counter the "powerful" buffs they get.
---
It’s not cheating, but it’s sure as shit unfair.
---
Think of it this way. Having comms basically means you inherently have aura perks like empathy, bond, object of obsession, etc without having to actually sacrifice a perk slot. Its a huge advantage to have, but it doesn’t effect how well you do in loops. If you’re a bad player you’ll get beaten just as easily.
---
Nice!!
---
Hey devs, this isn't a legion rework, it's just a legion balance. Get the terms right man. Rework implies you're going to work him from the ground up. This is just a bandaid..which doesn't do much.

---
Pansy you'll dish it out but can't take it
---
There’s no thing like hatch camping now.
---
You clearly didn't read a thing i said did you? 
---
Hatch is fine now. What is not fine is that killers can bm you by blocking you from opening the gates after the hatch closed by sheer blocking or downing you and letting you wiggle off just so the entity will kill you. 
---
That's the same bm killers complained about yet they do the same bullshit now.
---
I have played a game where 2 of my teammates were dead, I was doing gens and sometimes teammates little bit too and I ran with killer as well at the same time. Then me and 1 of my teammate were alive. I saved him and did the last gen. I had the gate almost opened and the killer came. He put me on the 1st hook and my teammate found the hatch and teabagged there and I died and I was so pissed.
---
That's my worst memory of dbd

It breaks the whole purpose of the game but devs said its ok. It was in the last official survey on the negative things for the player question so you never know.
---
preposterous
---
but honestly insane. cause doesn't add up to conversation. it's \*literally\* your opinion. not the actual reality in any way. first of all because i did not apply any of my opinion to the things i listed(except for Sole Survivor) and the person i replied to didn't claim anything but fact that there \*are\* counters to BBQ.
---
I'll look for the comment... agreed tho.. wraith, shape and clown dont take much skill just a few matches to figure out how to use their power correctly.

Myers dont pop tier 3 on an injured survivor wraith uncloak behind walls and what not. I havent played as clown tho

I wonder if the people who say these things ever feel ashamed when they find out they said it to a popular streamer.

It is nice to see that you are grounded and actually think before speaking, I agree with you when it comes to some perks being toxic but considering the option is there I try not to get mad as I gain nothing if I do.
---
Glad to see you are nice in your responses, thanks for that.

It was great talking to you, cheers.

---
those kate ones look fantastic!
---
Look people are only doing this because it just came out and people want to see the animation. It will stop in a few days and it will be business as usual. It's like how everyone plays killer after a new chapter and queue times are really long.
---
I can just imagine that Legion tipping their fedora and going "M'survivor"
---
Had the same situation with a Meg on swamp with a huntress. We both realized while in chase (it was fun a chase so that part was good I guess) the Meg wasn't doing the last gen. Killer noticed and let me go to find her but she Urban evaded everywhere and we couldn't locate her - no bond. I motioned for huntress to just kill me to stop wasting both our time. Meg shows up for hatch standoff (pre endgame update) and when she gets yoinked she dced on purpose!!! Like those could have been my points and killer's points. Boggles my mind.
---
Most of the time yeah.... my whole post is about the toxic side of killers but ok
---
Hah right at least you tried.
---
Guess you can't read either
---
Your issue is with you, nothing with game mechanically. Everything has a timer that will end the game shortly. If it upsets you because you feel it’s a BM, that sounds like a personal problem, not an issue with the game.
---
Hoes mad x24

I’ve heard some pretty good things about NordVPN, and it’s super affordable, I personally haven’t used it though.

I use F-Secure’s Freedome VPN. They’re a cyber security company based out of Finland. I usually connect to a location that’s about 150 miles away from me, and the latency, download, and upload speed is practically negligibly different.

I never said BBQ was OP bc it isn't. But to insinuate there are counters that aren't counters or viable perks to counter it when those perks are trash...yeah I gotta point that out

---
Dodge this!
---
What is wrong with people reading today. I think i did clearly state that it concerns killers that abuse the endgame with either blocking the door or downing you then let you wiggle off right before the timer. 
---
The endgame timer is fine. Not a personal problem. It's a game mechanic problem if it can be abused like this
---
Ghostface is an innovator.
---
Lol so you're complaining about other people being toxic, and then you're throwing unwarranted insults at me. Cool beans.
---
As a killer main I've learned how to spot swf groups. I'm sure many other killer mains know this as well. 
---
Playing against a swf can either be hell or nice. I agree with a lot of the comments about swf finding totems that they shouldn't be able to or knowing where everyone is without using aura perks. Killers always feel at disadvantage against swf due to that reason. You can't protect your totem from everyone, you can't mindgame with traps because everyone would know where it is. I think you get the point...
---
As for what I would do to change it. I say make it possible for the killer to hear your talking when they get nearby. It wouldn't completely destroy the communication, but it would give the killer something to work with. Other than that it should make it so the rank of the killer is at least 1 or 2 ranks above the highest ranked survivor in the team, since a swf group work too efficiently for a medium ranked killer to handle

doesn’t steam ban VPNs?
---
&gt;Imo the entity kill should happen immediately once the killer has downed the survivor, so that they can't stall it out.
---
As a bonus it would have a certain cool factor to it. Unlikely to be added though, since it would favor the killer a good deal.
---
That bottom right Nea 😫😍

---
Accept your fate or play a different game.
---
No, it is of course not cheating as the devs deliberately put a mode in for it. Looking at the game as it is now (based on perks and addons that reveal the aura of other survivors/the killer) the game seems to have been originally designed/balanced for solo queue. You can use observation+coms to gain the benefits of a number of these perks, to some extent, and in many cases you get much more information than perks/addons can provide. In solo queue, knowing what your teammates are doing and what they want you to do is much more difficult. It is also easier to coordinate your builds with a team of your friends over coms.
---
I don't think the devs should or would get *rid* of SWF, but they do need to fully embrace it and balance the game around it. That means adding in-game coms and permanent auras or something similar to try and give a lobby of 4 solos the same coms advantages as a 4-man SWF. And then buff killers accordingly, of course.
---
Tl;dr I don't think the game was ever properly balanced for coms but it was deliberately enabled by the devs so it is, by definition, not cheating
---
You need a new significant other

thank you! Just made her look less like a raccoon that crawled out of a sewer

I'm a slut for split hair tbh
---
Kiss your dad square on the lips
---
Uhm, it's not considered cheating. The only advantage I can think of is on nurse and huntress. And it wasn't because I wanted to, I was just curious if there legit was mouse support, since for some reason there is keyboard suppprt
---
Jane perk build: Solidarity/Botany/Autodidact/Empathy
---
Good idea, but you should rename it to "Catatonic Boy's" Last Breath.
---
More like you refuse to accept that i got a valid point and you just ignore it and make up your own bs. That's you. 
---
Accept that i'm right or don't comment.
---
Better would be survivors can’t start the jump animation if the hatch is in the process of being closed. 
---
What’s the point of changing endgame if it’s a free escape still regardless of if the killer got to the hatch first. 
---
Like they can actually do something now!
---
You called?
---
Oh boy, I'm trying to love myself, so I'll spare me from doing that thank you very much xd
---
:\^)
---
Male surviviors still get bugged in the lobby and become frozen
---
Killer still sees survivors ice skating if they drop a pallet
---
Why not show any screenshots of the addons/perk screen?
---
OP you just clearly made a mistake here or are trolling.
---
I don't know, but there's so much potential! it kinda makes me sad we can't mod these things
---
good killers can find people without BBQ
---
what?
---
I agree. But i aint talking about that. I'm talking about killers abusing the mechanic to get you killed by the entity. I aint talking about i can't open a door in time(you probably can't) but i'm talking about the killer finding me and not killing me. So he either pulls me off the door or blocks the access. Or he downs me and let's me wiggle so i still die by the timer. That's just toxic and bm.
---
Deal.
---
People call me thunderclap all the time.
---
"Huzzah! A man of culture!"
---
He truly is one, it seems.
---
Some day they're gonna make some nice skins as an april fools joke
---
Aw dang, foiled again!
---
*daddy
---
I think it might be working like this right now because killers host, so them closing the hatch is registering as happening first and the jump animation only happens partially because of lag. We'll see if this still happens after dedicated servers.
---
No they don't. They are angry people who have no shame and want others to feel angry. The psychological reasons behind it are a whole different discussion and they should probably seek council.
---
IMO, a fair solution would be to add an animation for the killer to close the hatch, like a 3s thing or something. Right now the killer will just camp until the survivor is closer. He will still be able to close, but will have to choose the right timing.
---
Bullet ants? That's how you call them who can kill a man?
---
hmmm, good point actually
---
Now that gives me an idea. Although it'd be nigh impossible to pull off, you could put all 3 of the mori'd guys teammates in the photo's background.
---
Since you have such problems reading ill say it again. This is when the killer finds me when he activates endgame but instead of killing me he's holding me hostage in the game so the entity will kill me. That's toxic and bm. The same kind of bm killers were talking about with survivors teabagging at the exit gate. 
---
Do you understand it now?
---
I'm struggling too but it feels the same problem as with every killer since I sometimes just win.
---
Rank doesn't equal skill.
---
My only problem is that blink accuracy seems to be bad to begin with - I don't always go through an object with a fair bit of second blink charge, sometimes I do with no second blink charge, and sometimes I don't go that far with a primary blink charge. Haven't met the up/down problems a lot of players complain about.
---
Excellent, pleasure doing business with you. I'll send the papers over for BHVR's signature and we should have this wrapped up by next week.
---
Yes. A "casual" mode where you can't play with friends. Sounds great.
---
Now that's what I call skill
---
As soon as the hatch is closed you can open the exit gates
---
This is why it's important to play both sides of the game.
---
Its not cheating but it makes the game un fun for a killer and gives a HUGE advantage to survivors, the game is supposed to be scary and silent, if the game never implemented a in game voice chat, it means they don't think its needed. Playing alone is just more fun 2 cause its more of a challenge and its more of a ''horror' game
---
Do you think it was just normal desync or did he lagswitch cuz he doesnt know how to loop?
---
Plague has a learning curve. I hate playing her I only use her for dailies.   I play in ranks that think they need to cleanse anytime they get sick which is stupid on their behalf. Dude you're making me stronger lol but figuring out how to use her power correctly is something I dont wanna take the time to learn.  Plus her stupid incent burner thing takes up part of my screen which annoys the hell out of me
---
Right? I threaten to trade him in for a younger model but I don’t think I’d get much for trading him in. He’s my mishapen potato ❤️
---
The original post was funnier, wish you just reposted that if you were gonna do it anyway.
---
Huh?
---
Yea wow the one called GPU 0 is pretty much at 100 almost all the time but i do have a 1060 graphics card so i feel like it should be better than that
---
No, don't do that! It's not your job to balance the game around coms, that's the devs job. Play to the best of your ability, within the rules. SWF/coms is allowed.
---
Yeah it gets exponentially harder
---
Not a spicy build... just a point farming build..
---
Leaterface is a chapter, not a paragraph, at least according to the official website.
---
You can get grabbed before it actually pops, which I find dumb.  
---
They could just put a 60/50/40s cooldown on it, like Dance With Me.
---
This why we run these build because of killers like you.  Who get upset camp,/tunnel...
---
Wouldn't mind Eligos being the killer for Evil Dead. The ability to send out a fake "copy" of yourself to mindgame the shit out of survivors would be phenomenal.
---
Not spicy just a healing build...
---
I can't pip so the ranking system must be broken, obviously.
---
Yes it's happening and it's a problem but it will go away.
---
Nope, it definitely seems like this player is purposefully deranking. This must be addressed by the devs.
---
*paternal unit
---
It's not toxic to use them, they are a part of the game.
---
Some of them are stupidly op and awful to play against, but they are in the game and there is nothing with you as a person to use them. Killers hate going against mettle of men, haddonfield offerings and instaheals, survivors hate going versus instasaw, omegablink, prayer beads etc. It's up to you if you want to use them. I usually try to avoid using the stuff that I hate going against, otherwise I'm kind of a hypocrite in my eyes. But that's just me.
---
Imo it's better not to use them if you want to learn how to play the game well, playing as Billy with instasaw is much different than playing regular Billy for example. You will get used to how much simpler they make the game to be and your skill won't grow nearly as fast as it would if you were gonna learn without some of them.

Xbox 1- In game ; audio bug, reproduction 100%

After a survivor is unhooked, that hook will always display the audio that shows as if the entity is still being summoned/sacrificing the survivor.

The only passive there really should be is passive Kindred 3 for everyone.

&gt; somehow hit me through those 3 trees which have collision so...
---
Clearly it's a magical hatchet. Must be a leaked add-on. Homing Hatchet + Iridescence Head
---
It was unbalanced one way for a while, it's only fair to unbalance it the other way.
---
LF's chainsaw can multi-hit. 
---
With a  tremendous rampage movement speed increase and a tremendously decreased charge time you could probably actually hit multiple people if used this add-on without Insidious camping. 
---
You could also probably hit the same person twice if they mess up their post-hit speed boost.
---
Only when the killer closes the hatch. From what I’m seeing a lot of killers are just sitting on top of it.
---
ohh so that's why I'm rank 20 😂 oh yes
---
When an idiot responds to my post without actually reading it then yes. He ignored everything i said and came with his own statement. I'm fine with the killer closing the hatch and yeah sucks if both doors are close together but w/e it can happen. He's ignoring what i said about killers finding you after they close the hatch and keep you hostage in the game for the entity to kill you off instead of him. It's the same stuff killers complained about before endgame.
---
As a Feng main, I'm wet
---
That explains everything tbh.
---
Dwight
---
I did too, 4 minutes if anybody has a trap is awful, it makes pigs endgame worse than any other killer. It also makes the traps pointless again unless you tunnel the trap.
---
It's not cheating, I feel like if I couldnt swf in party chat I'd play a lot less as would my friends we enjoy playing together bullshitting and talking shit about the killer lmaoo..
---
Usually, you want to aim your blink to be "in front of" the survivor. What I mean by that is that you should end in front of the survivor from your point of view. To clarify what I mean: if you're south from the survivor and the survivor is running towards the north. You want to blink to about 1 meter south of the survivor. If he double backs, you will get a hit in, if he continues running, you can easily use your second blink to close the distance and get them. 360ing barely works on PC from my experience.
---
The mistake I see many nurses make is that they try to blink to the place where they think the survivor will be

It is like the top post of all time i think
---
Hey I told you not to post this picture of me!
---
If the red stain and terror radius aren't suppressed when he's stalking in the end product, he's garbage tier.
---
The last thing we need is a killer who requires standing around staring at a survivor before they can actually attack with a giant "LOOK AROUND FOR ME, I'M RIGHT NEXT TO YOU" sign on their head.
---
Its goes from 0 to rank 12 in 60 seconds
---
Nahh someone else will probably do it
---
Finally someone taught Nea about makeup basics.
---
They kill you upon exit if the trap is activated so they already have your 1. and 2. point in place lol
---
Hearing the end game collapse final sound effect is pure adrenaline.
---
Yesterday I was cleanising a totem when a David trapped me in the corner, t-bagging.
---
Exit gates were close and there was a window, he did a good timing because he started running near the end of the bar. I heard the fucking sound effect as I was at the door.
---
I mean, I wouldn't have been mad at the David, it made me laugh, but damn that was a close call.
---
And so, I never stay near a corner ever again.
---
You got slammed for this post but I DC’d the second I heard a Nurse blink in every game I played during the blood hunt :)) they got no BBQ stack for me and often other survs followed suit after me too meaning she would only get like 1 kill after waiting like 10 minutes for a killer lobby lol
---
totally worth it to prevent sweaty nurse mains satisfaction during a time when you often see the community work together for BPs
---
You point fingers at the devs likely because you feel that they allow situations like this to happen during the endgame, yet you offer no suggestions on how to improve the quality of the game. This has nothing to do with competency of the developers. They've actually improved the endgame experience.
---
The endgame before the EGC was added had the potential for way more problems/toxicity/hostage taking. Playing out the endgame for maybe 3 or 4 minutes now isn't nearly as big of a deal as someone (killer or survivor) holding the game hostage indefinitely by body blocking or a survivor hiding in a place where the killer can't find them.
---
What a cunt
---
I definitely thought since you crouch most of the time as Pig, you would have to crouch,yourself, to use a pan and brush. Maybe I thought too into it.
---
Not enough to rage about it. Plus even if it is currently safe, there's a notification when one is unhooked
---
Wait, but EGC isn't supposed to be a tool to get more kills, it's just to make sure survs don't take the game hostage. That's why it doesn't start until the gates are already open and they could leave at any time. And this would make pig pretty much exactly the same as she was before, no?
---
Oof, not at rank 13 she doesn't
---
you can 4k as freddy on red ranks perkless if you happen to have a good match. this doesn't prove anything. You can't change the fact that he's weak. His power is 100% avoidable and ends up only giving you some information if survivors you're up against are smart enough, turning you into a powerless basic m1 killer
---
Nurse is really brutal when played good. No shame in losing every now and then
---
Yeah that's really weird. I would say it's your game file but you did the reinstall already. You used to play dead by daylight before and not have this issue?
---
You can think what you want, I'm just telling you how I win chases. Maybe it doesn't work for everyone. But I've been playing all day and losing killers no prob. You should try it, it really isn't hard
---
Really cool concept! Sounds pretty goddamn OP but it’s be interesting to actually see this in game
---
Eh good point. I still think Doctor is higher on the tier list than you think considering how good he is at wasting everybody's time and stalling. Nobody else has a 3-gen game as strong as doctor.
---
Yeah. There's too many dicks of there, I agree. Also there are few nice killers who have fun and don't facecamp all the time but the number is way too low. I haven't played dbd because of toxic people. Camping and toxic survivors won't let me enjoy the game. I wanna play with more premates and maybe then I can enjoy without frustration after every game.
---
i think it could be cool is done correctly. his power could be that he's tiny, fast, attacks quickly, and his terror radius is small, but his attacks are a lot weaker. maybe it takes two hits to put you into injured and the another two to put you into dying.
---
Yikes
---
Get out of here jacksfilms

pretty sure he let you escape

Rainbow and DBD share the same writer! Make it happen.

Frequent flailing means killer is close, visible or heartbeat.
---
Long flailing is usually the "come get me dammit" sign.
---
Sassygurl every time I see your name, I associate it with some stupid salty bullshit because that’s all you ever post. I will never take any of your post seriously again.
---
maybe your scenario is like teabagging at the gate, but that's still in the game. so now both killer and survivor has a "teabag at the gate" move. fair, next.
---
what the endgame solves is survivors holding the games hostage for as long as they want and hatch standoffs that could go on forever. a mere two minutes of a killer "teabagging" is a fair price to pay to eliminate all of that nonsense.
---
Huh??? Lol
---
You sorta have to think one step ahead of what the survivors are doing.  A lot of the time (at lower ranks) survivors will B-line away from you and run through structures.  So you can blink to where they're about to be pretty easily.  The killer shack for example, say they vault the window and turn left, they're about to go for the pallet.  Just aim ahead of the pallet and smack them afterwards.  In other matches with more seasoned survivors it's best to teleport into the center of the shack to see where they're going first, because they might double back or triple back to throw you off.  Give yourself a moment to evaluate where they're going, you have a short time in your blink window to decide where they're going to go and where you're going to go as a result.
---
A lot of survivors will immediately reverse and run into you as you're blinking towards them.  Recognize the survivors that do this and punish them by aiming at the ground closer to your feet.  You'll instead blink there.  Be careful because often times if you're on the second floor (meat plant) or above the basement, you'll straight up teleport through the floor and end up losing your survivor.
---
Dont be afraid to perform super quick blinks to confirm a hit, and remember if you're holding your charge during a chain, you can just *not use it* and wait for the fatigue.  This can throw survivors off and make them wiggle in front of you.
---
Another thing you can do is consistently blink, but when you know a survivor is close, just dont blink.  You move at 96% speed, which is still fast.  You can take advantage of a survivor that has waited too long before sprinting or one that made a wrong turn and got themselves stuck on geometry.
---
Let's say you're pursuing a survivor around a corner, first instinct is to blink through the corner and meet them at the other side, cutting through it.  Low ranks that's the right thing to do, but some survivors will double back.  So if I'm looking at someone with prestige cosmetics, I'll blink *to the corner*, just at the peak, and if they double back they run right into you, if they dont you can use your second blink to close the gap.
---
The only way you can counter nurse is like this:
---
Out-brain them.  Make them second guess where you're going to be.  Pop into a locker after they blink, they can't locker check during fatigue, but they can yoink off of totems, windows, pallets and gens.  Round a corner and wait for them to blink, once you know where they're going, double back for a moment and then run back forward to bait a swing.  Nurses have a long lunge so watch it.  Run towards a window to get them to blink to the other side, but never vault it, etc.
---
Different floor abuse:  Example.  Somehow you have a nurse on Gideon Meat Plant with a fully charged blink, top floor.  You can 100% safely run up and give her a kiss, she can't cancel her blink and smack you, she needs to either blink a full distance away from you on the same floor, or teleport downwards and then straight back up.  Either way you've got time to move.  I've seen god nurses travel down through the floor and back up to prevent survivors from seeing where she'll end up, and that shit is personally beyond me.
---
Best way to juke an inexperienced nurse is to fuck around in the rafters of the groaning storehouse, or travel up and down staircases.  Good nurses will teleport to the middle of the stairwell to cut you off to one area or the other, and then use their second blink to follow up.
---
Oooooof
---
Any more to the left and i wouldve hit the walls hit box, i suspect. After being abused the whole match it mustve been fog justice.
---
THATS THE POWER OF KING CRIMSON! HE ERASED THEBSECONDS YOU SPENT RUNNING AWAY
---
I only got the Xbox one, but it seems better overall. It’s less choppy, both on the survivor and killer side, however it can still be jerky. Going for perfect skill checks for example is frustrating as the frames aren’t always super consistent. Also, when the killer hits you, often times the frames might drop and you might run straight into a wall just to get hit by the killer again. Not perfect but is better than before I guess ;p
---
Fucking survivors always be pallet looping
---
Dont F*** with Kate Denson.

Hearthstone has casual and ranked gamemodes. I've been playing on casual for since the game came out and now I wish there wasn't the split and every game was ranked. it's much better when every match is ranked

EZ fix.
---
Oh Brother! Drink one for me, for the death that awaits. 
---
Hopefully I will see thee, teabagging at the exit gates.
---
No man, no teabagging from me. 
---
See you in the fog.
---
Thanks a lot! I intentionally decided to look into the Nurse's lore for this, and noticed that she has no "last breath" addon for the "Catatonic Boy", giving me the idea.
---
Fun fact his stealth is infinite until a survivor sees him- that’s the reason why his power takes so long to charge. He even gets audio cues when a survivor directly looks at him. Which causes it to rapidly drain in 5 seconds. (Also it’s the reason his crouch doesn’t remove his terror radius because of the shrouded hunt permanently stealthing him when he’s out of sight of survivors)
---

---
sometimes you do get fucked by the map (can't do shit on 3 of the coldwind maps) or happen to go against 3 people with urban evasion, but it's a fun experience. you have to learn how and when you should use your traps to pull 4 kills in most games
---
I mostly play in duos and we just talk about stuff while playing. Isn't as frustrating as just concentrating on the game. If you have fun cracking jokes it gets harder to get salty about the game

---
those aren't pallets, but they are still effective
---
I recently started playing a lot more nurse after the legion nerfs. Legion was my favorite killer because he could ignore pallets and loops. Since he now gets looped like any other killer now, I switched to nurse.
---
Nurse is fine. She requires a lot of mechanical skill and severely suffers on some maps (game, corn). I'm currently playing in the red ranks and it is difficult to keep track of good survivors. The juking and line of sight breaking is very effective against nurse. Granted, I use no add-ons because I'm trying to get good as nurse.
---
Stop trying to get nurse nerfed and force killers to loop. I hate looping as a killer. Hence why I play killers that ignore that mechanic.
---
The problem with nurse (and old legion) is that you can't transfer the same skills you learn as survivor against every other killer and use them against nurse. That's why she makes so many people mad. They feel it's not fair that they can't use the same boring loop mechanic to survive. Just learn some new skills. Don't force me to play an m1 killer just because you can't be bothered to learn to play the game without looping.
---
I need the rule set. A friend I always play dbd with will come over for a week next month and we need a drinking game. A Dbd related one would be perfect
---
If you're running Bond or other Aura Perks just to get healed you are way better off running Self-Care.
---
Being healed by a teammate wastes as much time collectively as SC (16+16=32), but you also have to spend extra time finding a teammate, while making yourself more vunerable since you have to walk around injured. 
---
While if you run SC you spend the same amount of time healing by yourself, but now your teammates can work on unhooking, repairing, opening exit gates.
---
Bond is a decent perk but on most maps, specifically the outdoor ones, it often isn't worth it since you can achieve the same effect by paying careful attention to your surroundings. I personally only use the perk whenever I'm burning an offering for the indoor maps like Meat Plant or Lery's, or the pseudo indoor maps like Haddonfield and Springwood
---
Not really, the second blink is much harder to hit if they juked your first blink and even if they are in range, second blink is a risk since if you miss (or even hit without downing them) then you're suffering the attack cooldown and an extra long blink fatigue cooldown, which offers the survivors a good opportunity to lose you.
---
Oh definitely! I feel like that could be a game in its own rights
---
***pray.***
---
Nah was the right one. Just not a fan. Guess it’s an unpopular opinion.
---
he gets a bit slower. he doesn't lose his terror radius when crouched tho
---
he loses his terror radius by starting stalking while his power bar is full
---
Except if you never do gens and hide around the corner of the map and just press emotes.
---
nice

“Hm. Nice.”
---
the ones that add Jigsaw boxes are actually helping survivors
---
Edit: in case you don't know the Pig boxes don't work as advertised in that you have a 1 in 4 chance of getting your hat off at each box.  Rather statistically speaking each box once you complete the search runs a "success or fail" check your actual odds of getting your hat off at each box is 50% so adding more boxes just adds more places the survivor can search and less distance that needs to be traveled.

It's hilarious you remember my name because yours doenst ring a bell. Why is it killer mains can post any type of shit and its fine, but as survivor main I'm just salty?? Fuck off
---
It a flip phone? And you don’t need reception to take pictures
---
Getting hit by a trick is worse than getting hit by a truck.
---
17 minute long video?
---
I figured it was a retread of what I've already seen, I'll give it a watch.
---
Yeah, the angle doesn't show his left arm, although you can see his hand close to my butt...Frank got a bit handsy there :))
---
5% movement speed....yeah how about no. Somebody else already pointed out the big flaw,since you can potentialy outrun 110% killers,but even without hope its crazy.
---
Its already laughable how long you can loop 110% Killers. So no.
---
The idea of passives is cool,but this is way to overtuned

I knew I shouldn't have told Mikey I was ditching him for Ghostface
---
It does go faster, but for every survivor that's on the gen aside from you you get a 10% penalty to your repair speed.
---
So if you work by yourself you work at 100% effiency, repairing 1 charge per second, fully repairing the gen after 80 seconds.
---
If you work with an ally you both repair at 90% effiency. Which means you both repair 0.9 charges per second, per person, but together you repair 1.8 charges per second. That means you will finish the generator in a little under 45 seconds.
---
3 people together on one Gen get a 20% penalty, taking 33 seconds to repair a Gen. And 4 people on one Gen means you all get a 30% penalty, repairing a Gen in 29 seconds.
---
Show us that it's a repost with the link, or else it's not. No one else is saying it's a repost, and you're the only one, so you're the only one to give us a link.

Well I am the guy who created those stats/survey. So I know. Also people don't get it but it is not a 50% per box. it means 50% of survivors remove it first go.

This is old as hell, haha. Still quality though, but not sure if it was yours originally or not.
---
Only active, which is BS.
---
My inherent fear of dolls was quickly suppressed by this image, lol. That would be so hilarious.
---
Gee I wonder why
---
It's not because survivors were holding the game hostage indefinitely by hiding in the map or taunting you on the hatch to give them a free escape.
---
Yall deserve everything you get.
---
Due to the amount of time it takes to get to tier three at that point, you have to be fairly coordinated with your team, if someone is getting chased everyone has to be doing a gen. Rush the gens as fast as you can and be wary of his tier 3 terror radius, it will give him away. If someone is good in chases you can have them lead him away. Its not easy, but very possible to accomplish.
---
At that point it’s in the killer’s best interest to be able to find and get kills.
---
Disappointing. I'd love to see Dwight hiding in a locker surrounded by dozens of magical woodland creatures
---
Not calling for a Nurse nerf, I said so multiple times. I was ranting about the "she takes a lot of skill, so it's ok" argument. If anything, your comment proves what I mean. You only played Nurse recently and made it to red ranks.
---
Also, looping is pretty much the whole of this game. Thats where all the action happens
---
Yeah, saw that post too. Looks to be likely with the leaks.
---
This is the content I came for. Now it should contain more Pig, but we will work on that.
---
This has happened to me twice now. Exact same situation with NOED and all. I love surprising players that don’t know how the new update works lmfao
---
You're offering has been accepted.
---
Thank you!
---
It's cool that you came forward and are being honest. I'm sorry your boyfriend was such an asshole to you. Your reason for leaving is actually pretty valid, and I think you mentioned you don't really make too much a habit of it. Keeping up with your therapy is a good thing! I'm pretty new too, so if you need someone to play with let me know (if you're on PC).
---
As for what you can do to help your anxiety and self esteem, try taking some deep breaths. Remind yourself that nobody is really out there to bully you specifically (and if they intentionally grief you CAN report that). You're doing the best you can, and that's all anyone can ask. People might rage, but nobody is going to "hate" you. Lots of people play the game casually, while drunk or high, just for shits and giggles, having a snack between gens, that sorta thing. Just approach it with as much of a "whatever" mind as you can instead of worrying about points or being the best player.
---
If the game isn't fun, take a break for a bit and come back. A good strategy would be to find some supportive friends to play with that will help and encourage you and keep your mind in the right type of mindset when you play so you're not alone and mentally beating yourself up.
---
Stay strong, and enjoy the game!
---
Looks like photoshop to me. 
---
I highly highly doubt that Ghostface is a chapter just a standalone killer.
---
It doesn't matter if you're not the game dev. You want something in the game to change, so you need to take some ownership over it. It's like if there's something on the floor that you didn't put there, but you keep tripping over it. You could just leave it there and continue walking that way, but you're just going to keep tripping on it. If you want something to improve, you need to do something about it.
---
In the working world, you don't go to your boss with a problem, and just expect them to fix it. You go to your boss and tell them there's a problem, and that certain things would make it better. If you just tell the devs that you don't like the new endgame, they might come up with a solution, but you might like it even less than you do now.
---
You're seeing this from a very one sided point of view (yours). How was a killer supposed to feel when survivors would go hide somewhere they couldn't be found, dragging the game out for as long as the survivors wanted? And don't say that you're only talking about things from the survivor perspective, because the developers have to take both sides in to account.
---
Additionally, what was stopping a killer from slugging someone at the end of the game or blocking them in the basement before? Nothing. Sure, you might be able to crawl around for a few minutes and hope to find the hatch, but maybe the hatch wouldn't have spawned before (but it does now!). Three or four minutes is NOT a hostage situation. Is it shitty to wait for a few minutes so the killer can watch the new death animation? Sure, but it's not taking someone hostage.
---
Then he yells at your for doing what he just fuckin told you to do
---
Not many. We only have 5 lincesed killers out of the 15, so its not many. 
---
As for what they will get, it all depends on how the liceinsing goes with them. Ghostface praobly took this long cause they have 2, and its why Jason is taking so long to come.
---
It doesnt happen as much because of that reason.
---
Behaviour has to hire you :D
---
I wish Claudette would look like your right pic! I’m really not a fan of the silver eye shadow.
---
It's not like you get any sort of reward for being a higher rank, so it doesn't really matter unless you're just looking for some kind of bragging rights. I've heard lobbies take longer and are even more toxic at higher levels as well.
---
Oh, i know, most people do, thats why anything funny is tagged shitpost. thats basically what it means here.
---
No kidding. I’m terrified of dolls so this helps a bit. I suppose I’d have to become a David or Jeff main
---
I should also say do this at your own risk. It is unknown right now whether or not this can get your account banned.
---
How would taking away Leatherface's only means of quickly downing a survivor be op? At best this would be like giving him an extra Brutal Strength that doesn't stack with actual Brutal Strength
---
**Huntress:** 
---
*Mother's Mask* \- A old and broken mask, that once belonged to a lonely girl's only parent. Ironically, the mask is that of an elk. This memento fills the Huntress with sadness and the desire to kill.
---
\- The Huntress' humming is silenced.
---
\- The Huntress' Terror Radius is considerably reduced (20 m -&gt; 8 m)
---
\- The Huntress' maximum hatchet count is reduced by 3.
---
*"I can't hear her... Where is she!?"*
---
*Iridescent Head* (Rework so they're less cancer but still cool enough to warrant using) -  A glass-like Hatchet head moulded from The Fog itself. The blade is warm and reverberating with The Entity's power. 
---
\- Hit victims auras are shown to you until they heal or unless they are within 12 meters of you.
---
\- Hit targets suffer from the Mangled status effect for 120 seconds.
---
*"The iridescent glass cuts through flesh and soul."*
---
**Hillbilly:**

*Black Engravings* \- Engravings found on the chainsaw body that represent the horror of isolation.
---
\- Considerably increases the Chainsaw's movement speed.
---
\- Considerably increases steering while using the Chainsaw.
---
\- Slightly increases charge time.
---
\- Slightly increases the time penalty when bumping into objects.
---
*"How is he so fast!?"*
---
*Iridescent Brick* \- An unbreakable glass-like brick moulded from the Fog itself. A reminder of a very horrible past and a warning of an even more horrible future should the holder ever perform poorly. Fear can be a very powerful motivator.
---
\- Tremendously increases the Hillbilly's Terror Radius (32 m -&gt; 48 m).
---
\- Slightly increases the Chainsaw's cool-down.
---
\- Moderately decreases the Chainsaw's charge time.

*Carter's Personal Notebook* \- A small and well worn notepad filled with the personal thoughts and scientific notes of Doctor Herman Carter.
---
\- Shock Therapy area of effect becomes a 24 meter circle centered on the Doctor (any Survivor within the circle is effected by the attack).
---
\- Slightly decreases Shock Therapy charge time.
---
\- 6 second increase to Snap Out of It.
---
\- Survivors with Madness have the following affliction:
---
\- Madness II: The Survivor perceives an Illusionary Doctor as following them (it follows their exact path). The illusion persists until the Survivor runs through it, 'stuns' it, or 30 seconds pass. Can be seen by the Doctor as an allied Aura.
---
\- Madness III: The Survivor perceives an Illusionary Doctor as following them (it follows their exact path). The illusion persists until the Survivor runs through it, 'stuns' it, or 60 seconds pass. Can be seen by the Doctor as an allied Aura.
---
*"THEIR MINDS ARE MINE!" - Herman Carter*
---
I hate the distance throw accomplishment. Cross map KO still doesn't count......
---
Now Michael, play nice with others.
---
yeah this has been happening a lot to me lately. Usually it's Nurses mid-blink, so I think their games are crashing rather than they're quitting. I've also had Spirits in the middle of phasing and Wraiths uncloaking disconnect as well, but not as much as the Nurses.
---
Also, matchmaking has been ridiculous lately, so a lot of killers are getting matched with survivors that are way above their skill level, so there is the possibility that games have been less fair for killers so they just rage quit.
---
Try to remind yourself it's only a game. Sometimes you win and sometimes you dont. You shrug off the loss and learn from your mistakes. Remind yourself (literally have that dialogue in your head) this is just a game. If someone is so tilted by a mistake you made then honestly, fuck em. Mistakes happen! Anyone who is harshly critical in a toxic manner towards you, remind yourself that they mean nothing to you so neither should their opinions. 
---
Another suggestion is playing with friends. Then you kind of create a "safe space" to make mistakes and learn the game at your own pace. And of course have fun in the process! 
---
If you play on PC and are looking for a friend let me know! I'm not great at the game lol I'm not even that good. But for some reason I enjoy that rush of sneaking around and attempting to survive as long as I can.
---
This so much! The music was playing in my head the whole time I was watching it.
---
Oh.
---
Oh snap.
---
I'm going to LOVE Ghostface.
---
I like Endgame. Glad it's in. I wish it started once the final gen got done, though. Not when the door opens.
---
I appreciate the time you took to write this out, thank you. We will take a shot for you, as a little warm up when the time comes. Cheers!
---
Ps: I like the optional rule lol
---
Yes and in certain circumstances you cannot prevent the anti stealth perks from going off no matter what. Nurses has pretty simple minded counterplay, as does BBQ. But distortion is niche and as bad as it is bc it doesn't do anything fancy. Concealing your aura is good for countering BBQ but just jump in a locker. If ur so worried they'll see ur scratch marks, run lightweight or Urban Evasion, 2 perks that are very good for stealth builds. 
---
If distortion had all the same functions as it has now but you could regain tokens in a way similar to stake out (sit in the terror radius and don't get spotted long enough to) then It'd jump to being a must have for any stealth build
---
It really is. I'm even enjoying Killer quite a bit!
---
dead meat high key the best youtube channel for the past well since he created dead meat
---
Can we please fix the pig in general tho?
---
Mathieu please fix pig
---
This is good advice. With my ex I cared deeply about his opinion of me and everything that I did, but I guess I shouldn't really give a shit about some random person thinking I'm crap because they don't know me. They aren't a friend and I don't care about them either, and if they get that mad at a game I wouldn't WANT them as a friend I guess.
---
The "safe space" sounds great, I just feel awful that I'd need to be babied and that I'm more fragile and less "thick skinned" than a lot of players when it comes to stuff like being trolled or doing poorly. It's something that I'm working on.
---
Thank you. If you'd want to try playing with someone like me I can try.
---
If Sidney does come out I might ditch Feng and it pains me to say that.
---
Same, it makes her eyes look sleepy. Which is a shame as I absolutely love her hair
---
I actually main nurse when I do play killer. However, the whole "skill" argument you brought up is very accurate. I think she needs changed in several ways. Mainly in terms of add-ons but also pallet usage against her. About a year ago, for a few weeks, pallets would stun her while blinking. Nurse mains complained and it was reverted. I thought it was a fair counter play against a very oppressive killer.
---
Yes, she is very easy. Until the red ranks. Get there and then come back and report. Once you play survivors that can juke and break line of sight effectively, you will see she isn't op. Her add-ons can help and yes she is still strong, but not anywhere near game breaking. 
---
Having a killer like nurse is necessary at red ranks. A killer that can end chases in moments, compared to a minute or more of chasing through pallets.
---
Especially against swf with comms. Nurse is the killer you use when you're tired of pallet loops and gen rushing because YOU can actually set the pace of the game, rather than the survivors.
---
My theory is that it drops you from the killers grasp to kill you, but the drop animation pushed op out the exit before the entity animation started
---
I guess nea's look is inevitable
---
Not sure if a bug or not, but in game on PC, sometimes swapping to treatement mode as Doctor and clicking m1 at the end of the animation will swing your weapon instead of charging the ability. You will be in treatement mode at the end of the animation.
---
You did the right thing to do.
---
I expected to be met with a lot of serious hate, but I thought that by being honest and opening up to people I might get some genuine advice and help.
---
Other people have suggested finding some good friends to play with so I'm going to try looking! It would be nice to get some tips or gentle encouragement while I play with other people instead of being petrified that I'm dragging everyone else down.
---
I'd be happy to play with you. Thank you so much for your kind words. I'll try to remember this.
---
If you guys can get ones for Claudette and Feng to work, that'd be great lol.
---
Shut your mouths, Shirtless Myers, then Shirtless Kate.
---
Normally, I'd agree. BUT I've been getting chain-sawed through windows too often to agree right now. :( 
---
Why BHVR? :(
---
Exactly my first thought. I just came back after a few months away, reset to rank 16 and I just wanted to farm my 3 killer dailies. I intended on letting everyone leave alive. Hag, Freddy and Bubba dailies. Three 4k's a row, 3 dailies done and I was like "oh yea I was supposed to let them live". 
---
When it's really easy and they can't even find the hex ruin, it's quicker to just get it over with. It's almost like a rank 16 runs 10% slower than a rank 3. Hard to explain really.
---
The official name for Leatherface's DLC is "Paragraph II: LEATHERFACE"
---
You can bring in work analogies but that doesn’t apply here. I don’t work for them. I’m a costumer who isn’t satisfied with the way a part of the game is at the moment. I can ask them to look at it again and maybe they will find a way that will fix he problem. I ain’t gonna fix something that others should fix for a living. Otherwise if i bring a suggestion and they use it, I want to get paid for that. 
---
You say I see this from a one sided point of view but I already said I like endgame cause it counters the bullshit survivors did with keeping it hostage. This however falls in the same category as blocking people in the basement and keeping them hostage. I still think that should be bannable. 
---
3 or 4 min is taking the game hostage. There is absolutely nothing I can do to counter or stop it. All I can do is go afk in windows for that time. Well guess what. I won’t do that. I’ll dc and lose my points before I’ll let some ass waste my time like that.
---
Guess I better switch to PC ;-;
---
Welcome to hell. Please enjoy your stay.
---
I like it as well, if it wasn’t for some killers abusing the way it works
---
I agree
---
I think this just made my day
---

---
A little thing to remember is it's just a game meant to be there for people to have fun most importantly. When you play to have fun and not necessarily to "Win" it doesn't feel like mistakes are really made as often. Plus it helps you learn from them more than really just playing to "Win" right at the start of playing/learning the game's mechanics.
---
I don't think the killer models would fit a small doll. Also in order for them to carry the surveillance they wod have to have a very long and complicated animation.
---
Probably a majority of men*
---
But he cannot find you. If you just urban evade and emote then he can't do jackshit but get lucky or have whispers.
---
How big were the old bloodwebs? I was around in the closed beta but hardly really leveled anyone up.
---
Nea looks the same
---
I'm sorry it just sounds dumb to me. Indont get your reasoning to do it
---
"I was good to you Mikey"
---
Agree. You just can't play this game to make everyone happy, because different people want different things. And others just want to be upset, or to make you upset.
---
Ha, that one actually does look funnier because Adam really looks like he could be Claudette's dad there.
---
I will Neve that Campbell for all time (even though it will probably not look much like Neve)
---
The punchline is the exact same with the same type of screenshot, that's the issue
---
Despite BHVR using the actual word "chapter"?
---
I love the whispy tassels going on. Did you see the gameplay footage somebody put out the other day? They look *cool af*.
---
They could be getting errors or rage quitting. I was playing killer the other day and I got an 8018 error mid match. This sucked because I used a mori and then I was returned to menu screen. This has been happening to a few people on PS4 and I think they’re trying to fix it
---
How about an average size doll man that crawls around like a demon?
---
Yep. The survivor and killer tutorial gives 25,000 bloodpoints each.
---
I really want a grainy potato quality photo to pop up on the survivors' screen after they die. It's got to be potato quality to really get those 90s feel.
---
Ace in the Hole + Plunderer's Instinct.  
---
Maybe use a coin offering to have a better chance at getting good items, but it all comes down to luck.
---
In this case, I don't think intent matters. You screwed the other person intentionally, regardless of motive. The result is still toxic.  There's a weaker argument for not being rescued from the hook. There are a lot more reasons not to I.e.: killer, totems, position of hook; all those things come into play
---
Woah big guy you better take a fucking seat with that slick ass mouth. You dont know me whatsoever. 
---
You mad about my opinions on the game.. grow up
---
The "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me" copypasta is new to you? It basically invented copypastas.
---
As a Meyers main, I felt territorial as well......... lol
---
Could be a red herring considering they are trying to avoid the situation as much as possible.
---
My main reason for being sceptical is the fact we haven't seen anything survivor based, like, no perks, no skins, no options a single image that says the new survivors name.
---
A lot of signs point to no survivor at this time but i am hoping i am proven wrong.
---
Just play however you see fit and block out messages of those who try to give you crap for your playstyle, The whole point is to have fun and as long as you're doing that you're playing the game the way it's meant to be
---
It's repost... unless it's the same person that did it before lol. Anyways upvoted, brung me a joy on my face, I didn't remember this haha.
---
Survivors always make a mistake at some point
---
It’s not supposed to be balanced 1v1, that’s how asymmetrical games work
---
Think it was used more so in shooters like cod and CS where you throw a grenade and kill a guy. Same kinda thing the goal and how to get there are just different
---
Does luck affect it?
---
Plunderers &amp; Ace in the Hole. You could also add Up the Ante, I think it's a bit bad though.
---
If you just want med kits with add ons go for Pharmacy &amp; Ace in the Hole, I use that quite a lot.
---
Throw in some salty lips with that. It helps.
---
Out of curiosity, will you be making another post with the results from the poll later?
---
Hm... I guess overall I’m kind of in a similar boat to you, but I’m also not in the sense that it’s my boyfriend who makes me anxious about messing up as much as it is I get mad at myself for making really stupid mistakes, since I personally hold myself to a higher standard.
---
But everyone has to start somewhere. I know a lot of people were saying to try playing with friends (and tbh it’s good advice), and here’s my offer to play with you (also on PC) and maybe even teach you a few tricks that I picked up while I was learning. But I do think that as you get better about not beating yourself up, it would be good for you to play solo every once in a while, as maybe you’ll learn other things that you maybe can’t see or learn currently due to your mental state.
---
Overall, you can’t win every game. You’re a human, so are your team mates and the killer. None of you guys are perfect. People play the game in different styles and maybe their way just clashes with yours. No biggie. It’s a game, shit happens. Plus you gotta remember, you’re all here to have fun.
---
Maybe when it gets to be a bit much and you feel the need to DC, jump in a locker for a second, take a breath, and try to finish the match. Then maybe be done with DBD for a bit/the day and play something that’s relaxing for you, or do something else entirely. While there are toxic people within every gaming community, there are those of us out there that are understanding and would rather just smile and say it’ll be fine. So don’t let someone who clearly isn’t worth worrying over keep a grip on your happiness. As long as you can learn to accept your flaws and love yourself you’ll get through it. ❤️
---
Trust comes after the game starts, not before. Otherwise you get some assholes that maybe give you 2 hooks.
---
They did use that word to describe Ash on Twitter too though
---
We made our own rules  :)
---
I'm pretty sure luck only helps with Kobe-ing, I think pharmacy ups the chances of finding first aid kits if you're looking for those, but plunderers and AITH are probably your best bet, use a coin offering for more chances of chest = more chances of better loot. You'll probably find a lot of skeleton keys
---
If Bubba would have more BP gain from BBQ, everyone would play as him.  
---
Most survivors would then play characters that give you exhaustion perks for the faster cooldown.  
---
I think that adding stuff that's character-specific will just ruin the variety of characters played.
---
The gens aren’t blocked until endgame is activated so just do gens while the killer stands there like an idiot.
---
You can feel that way, I'm just saying toxic or not it looks like it was the best line of play for OP.
---
The lethality of the nurse vs everyone else is hilarious
---
What the game considers a "safe rescue" is not the same as what you or I would consider a "safe rescue".
---
I could sneak to the hook, wait for the right time, heal the guy in 5 seconds, tank a hit, lead the killer away while I'm bleeding, but somehow this rescue is considered a "farm" even though my ally gets off scott-free with 0 risk to himself.
---
IMO, that's the only issue with it.
---
The Night He Came Home, hurry yo slow ass up Mikey 😂
---
Use whatever you want but pretty please don’t camp me and tunnel me off the hook.
---
I couldn't find anything relating to her actual power so we went with the bullshit overpowered joke.
---
I bet he gets a short duration speed boost and raises knife when a survivor spots him.  It would fit with movies where he'd largely calmly watch someone, and then when they spotted him, go full bore chasing immediately.
---
by far the most requested survivor, lol - i hope i did her enough justice! i tried to record my process with this one but the recording program i used crapped out on me. hopefully next time, though!! :(

And the way he just peaks the corners and you can see them in the background is amazing
---
I believe it does, but it's not that great of an effect that you'd want to waste either a chest or a perk slot on it.
---
I like it.  My favorite is the wraith tho. It cracks me up
---
I use all my traps ASAP. I rather stall out the game.  I don't understand why its a big deal for egc.  Imho people who have traps on usually don't heal. So you have a easy target if you run in to them later if they don't get trap off first box  1 less person on gen. That builds  pressure. Rbt stops self heal because of time so takes away 1 perk. Sure some will still SH but that might cost them to much time. Get 2 people with active traps on and your chance of snowball is in a great position.  If you just use rbt at the end game you might get a kill but the best strategy is to burn them all and start the snowball. I main her over most and consistently get mim 3k.  Yes if you get gen rushed it might feel good to trap 1 or 2 at endgame but by then even if you do get a kill your bp will be so low because of rush . I want 1 or 2 survivors at endgame not 4 and maybe trap one. Try to burn them all before last 2 gen and I would bet you would have kills and more bp then to wait.
---
That made me cringe so much. Sorry you had to ensure that man.
---
Reminds me of a Feng that blew up at me in chat yesterday because I wouldn't just die on hook to give them hatch. There 5 gens left. 2 DCs at the start. I almost got an entire gen done, myself, and was chased by the killer[who the Plague] the entire time, giving them ample time to get something done. They didn't do anything. So I held out as long as I could lmao Sure enough, Plague found them in a locker.
---
It hurts me how people are misunderstanding what I’m saying. I understand the mechanics of dbd and the counters. I’m saying putting an easy fix can prevent the abuse entirely.
---
I'm not going to say that Nurse doesn't require skill, but play any other killer and you'll see how much more skill they require
---
Are you one of the charms? Was there really even a peanits to begin with?
---
Same
---
Don’t Look in Here
---
You can stalk without stealthing, though.
---
Holy shit that's exactly him, yeah we play league. Inteterestly enough, I'm not talking to him right now because hes been a huge ass lately, like he would open and ignore my messages, go out of his way to not invite me but make sure I saw he was playing my favorite shit, and just a bunch of other stuff. so right now I'm not talking to him for that, like he made a bunch of new friends due to a tournament that he took way too seriously, and he likes to bounce between the 2 groups freely leaving the people he was just playing with in the dust and personally wondering what I did wrong. Just an asshole right now for some reason.
---
This is wonderful!
---
Yeah, I don't think he will came close to top 5 killers ( Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Huntress and Hag ), but he has the potential to be around Myers place, depending on how good his power will be in PTB and live.

I’m a survivor main but I play killer sometimes and when I do I never down teammates who get farmed right away. I always go for the farmer to hopefully teach them a lesson. It always feels good and like you’re playing god lol
---
Yeah! She barely gets any deviousness points. Landing ambush attacks isn't very common and you can only put 4 RBT without add ons. There's also pretty much no point of the "game over" event since it's almost impossible to get a RBT kill unless you run rule set no. 2 and tampered timer
---
When the flashlight Burns you hear a nom
---
He sounds like a toxic player *and* a toxic person. I'm sorry you have to deal with that too. It's horrible. :(
---
&gt;yours for 5000 hours grinding or half the price of the game.
---
It actually doesn't take that long to grind 21.600 shards, if you know how to do it.
---
Reminds me of that earlier post, where someone made a video with a super long hatchet throw(through multiple maps) and kept randomly spinning the hatchet
---
I'm really glad you did. I had an itch that could only be scratched if I knew if it still had collision.
---
That wasn't toxic, but making this worthless post giving that one dumbass way more attention than he deserves could be considered toxic though right?

Both Kate and Claudette look vastly improved. Nea...can't seem to get a break...
---
Well I had to put the text there for the meme, but it's a damn cool picture
---
I've felt that before. What helped me was me looking at myself and asking, "Am I the me I want me to be?" Nobody will live with your actions longer than you, so worry about making yourself proud instead of trying to live to standards others set for you.
---
Naw, Billy was born from inbreeding/incest.
---
Take it with a grain of sugar, people just get upset with they mess up and blame whatever is the easiest
---
As far as escaping, yes.
---
Facts. In F13 even with Proximity everyone was on comms in party chat. Why? infinite range and the Killer cant hear you.
---
For sure.
---
I had a friend like that once, basically became such a shithead over a game that we just stopped talking entirely. People suck.
---
As a killer, picking out a few dumb meme builds and spending a match every now and then just messing around can be a great way to relieve any stress related to the game. Since your goal is just to have fun and screw around, the only way to really do poorly is to take things seriously. Something like spending a match as Myers with a scratched mirror/m&amp;a and just seeing how many times you can scare the hell out of people can work wonders.
---
I love when I don't let the guy farm and hook him and the guy who was hooked comes over and points at guy on hook and BM s him. I give a nod to guy and go kick a gen and let him have his fun with the farmer.
---
Thank you! My Nea edits seems to get the most critique, so I'm glad someone actually likes it &lt;3
---
If the killer wins, they're toxic. If the survivors win, they're toxic. DbD fanbase logic lol.
---
I love how Nea in the middle looks like Pink
---
imagine someone thinking Amanda being OP
---
doesn't happen to me, try reinstalling dbd?
---
Jane played by Diedrich Bader
---
FUCKING PLEASE. I JUST HAD A FUCKING SUPER-IMMERSED P3 CLAUDETTE FARM ME TWICE IN FRONT OF THE KILLER, WHO NEVER WENT AFTER HER... EVER.
---
F
---
Sounds like Leatherdaddy to me
---
Hahaha once in a lifetime
---
I have to ask, did you find all these pictures online or did you take some?
---
As a killer I only chase the savior. Every time. Yet I always get tunneled and it's outrageous. But when I'm the killer and I come back to the hook I usually only find the wounded one cornered and I just look at them like, "Okay where'd he go? Rat him out"
---
Affect*
---
That shouldn't be the expense of escaping without criticism tho, that's my only contention. I don't think you're obligated to get someone off the hook. But also, don't be a rat.
---
They do have Jeff's roadie baseball tee and Dwight's "surf tones" shirt. I totally agree though lol.
---
There still is the issue of the fact his hitbox for his chainsaw is a cone which adds to the wonky nature of the hitbox. 
---
Nurse and Billy I find from my experience are in the same boat of 'hard to get the hang of but when you do they can really ruin your day'.
---
What you trying to say about Nea, huh?
---
That was a very buggy match right there OP.
---
Timer going down normally while you are downed, you escaping, etc.
---
To be honest though, that Clown deserved it for the BM lmao
---
They're so tired they have to stare at their hands for an hour.
---
I touched the butt!
---
Reminder that this is a horror game about merciless killers and human sacrifices...
---
I know, but I just used the template image

These are all random shit off Google.  Even the roomba with a lego brick photoshopped onto it.
---
I don’t care nor does it bother me, but the term makes no sense
---
I love everything about this post.
---
Exactly! I bought the entire outfit but I just can't seem to wear this head cosmetic although I love the hair.
---
Kate can fuckin get it
---
That's amazing, thank you for finding all these hahaha
---
I wish she was OP
---
I really wish they'd take a look at this and consider touching up on character customization.. Softer looks a lot better than harsh.
---
While op, I need the doctor one in my life!
---
Title should be “Legion after the nerf”
---
Same to me, I do like you do when it's happens
---
Love this. But I think legion and nightmare should be swapped round
---
Survivors have been able to open the gate at any madness level, the exception is after being shocked.
---
I see you are using those perk images like Noob3 does, do you get banned for it though as it is changing game files?
---
Why so salty
---
I play survivor usually since I think I'm "better" at it (barely), but I do like killer since there's less pressure. If you die as a survivor, that's it. You either spectate the rest of the game or leave and hope to find a new match. As killer you don't have to worry about dying, and you seem to get more blood points just for participating even if you don't kill a lot of survivors. I'd like to at least get a kill or two, doesn't have to be all four. Or have survivors that KNOW I want to mess around as piggy or someone else and just chase them around and not hit them and just be silly.
---
Just wait for the next wave of bandaid perks to fix current complaints/issues rinse and repeat and cry as the grind gets progressively worse.

---
But the Entity chose me!
---
Limited amounts of drinking don't affect the baby, like a glass of wine a week kinda limited.
---
Maybe he hasn’t gotten in trouble because of the leaks already and if he gets in trouble then we know a survivor is coming
---
I relate too much
---
It's a meme
---
What'd you have with Dead Hard, Lithe and Balanced Landing?
---
Exactly this.
---
I don't care if you don't respect the 4%, I don't care if you use NOED &amp; MYC &amp; Rancor &amp; Devour Hope on perma-tier-3 Myers (so your insta-downs can have insta-downs,) just please don't tunnel me when I've been farmed.
---
And it was drawn like it was from a Saminations video
---
Because survivors have a 60-80 percent survival rate?
---
Dont start saying that your only playing agasint 4 mans. Only 3-6 % of matches are 4man
---
Duh he’s gonna pull a Deadpool and break the 4th wall
---
I actually somewhat agree with you.  
---
It's just bothersome at this point.
---
So, easy counterplay. Dont approach the hatch near a killer that's already there. Get thee to a gate!!!
---
That makes no sense. If there *is* a survivor coming and he said there isn't, he wouldn't get into trouble, because it wouldn't be in breach of the NDA.
---
Given that he signed it, if he gave out any information that was true, BHVR would be within their rights to get him in trouble. He hasn't gotten into any trouble, implying that his information was false.
---
I mean, to be fair, they somehow managed to get makeup while in the realm of the Entity. I don’t think they’d have their makeup done up pristine when they’re constantly running for their lives.
---
From a money standpoint, you’re paying for costumes, so it’s equally fair to expect them to look good and worth your cash.
---
Same thing for balanced landing and lithe just buff to 155 percent. As for dead hard maybe the sprint you do goes just a bit farther. Like I said these aren't  game changing but they might drag the chase on just a bit longer.
---
Lol imagine if she deadharded past you
---
I finally got bbq n chili a few weeks ago. Then I ranked up Myers about 70 times and didn't get it once.
---
When you read in the Internet that it's possible to deactivate killer's traps with a flashlight.
---
this is really wholesome
---
Try to play the game with people who don't care in a KYF! Just play casually, everyone in a vc, and nobody taking the game seriously. Over time, it will be easier to make mistakes because everyone's being chill and making mistakes on purpose to have fun. :)  
---
I got a couple buddies that I play with, and if you'd like to do that with us, message me and I'll be happy to play with you!
---
Why not? Survivors have no obligation to each other. If 'being a rat' gets me the hatch in that situation then nothing personal but I'll do the same thing OP did every time
---
it took a huge leap for me to finally start playing this game in the first place because i was so anxious about fucking up (and multiplayer games in general scared me at the time). i used to exclusively play SWF and let them carry me - but the more i played, the more confident i became, and my friends never really gave a fuck if i sucked tbh. it also helped that i watch a LOT of DBD YouTube and Twitch, so i've absorbed gameplay strategies from that.
---
idk. i guess my point is if you're playing with the right people, they're not gonna baby you, they're gonna be working as a team to help everybody win. try not to think about it as being babied.
---
i also have implemented a strong personal stance to never DC, since that actually makes me more anxious about fucking over that team, lol. i've broken it a bit over the Legion update, but i'm back on it now that they've been fixed (and shouldn't have broken it in the first place tbh). maybe that's something that would help?
---
wishing you luck. 💜
---
Solid disagree my dude. Other killers require less skill. They are easier to learn. Looping and counter looping are easy, just tedious. Nurse requires far more skill when faced with good survivors. But she is also more powerful and more in control of the game.
---
[OH MY FUCKING GOD.](/intensifies)
---
I HAVE PLAYED 3 ACTUAL MATCHES TODAY. I HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS. EVERY OTHER GAME HAS BEEN A DODGED LOBBY OR A CANCELED MATCH, I GOT THREE CANCELED MATCHES IN A FUCKING ROW (AND I NEVER HAD 3 MATCHES IN A ROW WHERE SOMEONE DIDN'T LOAD IN, EVER.)
---
MY THREE MATCHES THAT I WAS ABLE TO PLAY?
---
IMMERSED TEAMMATES WHO DIDN'T TOUCH GENERATORS OR COME GET ME OFF FIRST HOOK.
---
FARMED TWICE BY A P3 CLAUDETTE WHO WAS FRIENDS WITH THE KILLER.
---
&amp; DESPITE UNHOOKING THREE PEOPLE, WHEN I WAS FIRST HOOKED IN THE BASEMENT, I 4%'D, RAN OUT AFTER SEEING MY TEAMMATE'S AURA NEXT TO THE GATE *RIGHT OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT,* THINKING IT'S A CLEAR ESCAPE... ONLY THEY 99'D THE DOOR AND WERE FUCKING STANDING THERE, SO OF COURSE I DIED AND THEY LEFT WHILE I WAS BEING CARRIED BACK TO A HOOK.
---
I DON'T EXPECT TO LIVE EVERY GAME, OR EVEN MOST GAMES, BUT WHEN I HAVE TO SPEND A SOLID 45 MINUTES BETWEEN DODGED LOBBIES AND CANCELED GAMES TO EVEN GET INTO A MATCH, I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE IT IF I WEREN'T PAIRED WITH IMMERSED TEAMMATES OR TOTAL ASSHATS.
---
No they don't
---
Same, it really makes him seem like a legit “Ghost”.
---
I don't blame her for hatch camping, sometimes it's just what you gotta do haha, but that was a great reverse on your part, nice job!
---
Since the DS nerf, I haven’t had any trouble against it. For flashlights you can bring franklin’s demise. MoM and adrenaline are unfortunately pains in the ass only a chainsaw can really remedy.
---
Not really, every game in existence has its own Kobe.  It's all about taking a chance on something difficult and succeeding.
---
It really wont but fantasizing is cool. I'm fairly new to this sub also
---
Nea still looks like an deadite
---
I still feel as though it'd ruin diversity.  
---
Because, you know, everyone needs to maximize efficiency for this eSports gaming experience.
---
EAC, as far as i know doesn't even check image files like the perk icons.
---
Lol, drag all those immersed players into the bright moonlight!
---
I've gotten some messages with channel recommendations for killer and survivor strategies, so that helps a little bit with wondering what the heck I'm doing (or doing wrong for that matter, or what mistakes I'm making easily that many others do and how to fix it).
---
I try not to DC TOO much, but I admit I'm still doing it a few times a day if I really can't handle the pressure. I don't want it to become a habit, so I do my best to stick around if I'm able to unless it's really affecting my mental health/I'm shivery if I'm remembering things and events and need to step outside or have a breather. I'll do my best to become more forgiving to myself and my circumstances.
---
He literally just explained why it made sense.
---
Many sites available, i use this one myself: http://www.dbdbuilder.net
---
Mind my stupidity, but who or what is OP
---
Its not like you can really do anything on the build anyway. Whats the point?
---
I mean, hitting people over tall obstacles when they're healing is always satisfying :P
---
and you actually did better
---
It takes awhile but it prevents the trail which is a net positive in my opinion also i use quick and quiet with kates perk that removes the tracks for a few seconds
---
A++ sentiment.
---
Play your best and give an earnest GG after your rounds!
---
Good luck spreading that positivity around
---

---
I did. However his prestige 3 glove is kinda disappointing. I'm glad I bought Ashy Slashy tho, I will never let him go (see what I did here?)
---
A new stalky boi is about to give him a run for his money
---
If it doesn't mean Opposing Player, I got nothin
---
Depends.  If it's a shitty SWF then it could be 2v1v1v1
---
this was back when i played on XBox - i can only assume that it wasn't intentional lagswitching, since the game disconnects at the end, or if it was, the killer fucked up. either way, this was the first and last time this sort of thing happened to me to this extent, and it still makes me laugh when i watch it.
---
the bugs on XBox were unreal, though. ah, the days of rubberbanding back to the hook as soon as you tried to run away after being unhooked. good times.
---
Please no joke characters thank you
---
r/justiceserved
---
Exactly except it's a snowmobile instead of a car.
---
So it says it was availible in week 11. That means I'm fucked for the rest of the year basically?
---
I'll send you our rules.
---
Think they were pretty decent.
---
I'm drunk as fuck right now so haha
---
fuck man , and i thought video games are here to let us forget the cruel real world. i aint got much advice other than reminding yourself its only a game.  Its also totally fine if you disconnect because of your health, be it physical or mentally.  Health goes first gal, and about your Ex, well i hope hes beeing abused in jail by some bigger guy. maybe some real life david king will.... show him some affection
---
this gif was made before 2.5.0 wasn't it? there's no reason someone would say "fuck decisive strike" with current DS.
---
Fun fact, I've got a friend who is in this exact same scenario. If anything I reccomend having a good friend circle, one where they play the game but with good/fun intentions.
---
I love the ebony mori text that talks about the killer stopping and smiling like it was just given permission but from a survivor perspective
---
Rofl
---
thank you :3 &lt;3
---
This is so satisfying to see. Any post game salt?
---
A Fearful Leader?
---
"Let's go for the kill count!"
---
I love his channel.
---
Daddy &lt;3
---
That one guy already made a tweet about it being called the scream chapter and mentions a map and survivor
---
I always thought it was because Kobe is a super rare (as in not common) kind of steak, and getting off the hook (without Deliverance) is also super rare.
---
If you overthink that hard no term made sense when it first came up.
---
Lara croft
---
twitch clip from OhTofu: https://clips.twitch.tv/HonorableGorgeousCrabTooSpicy
---
Thanks a lot
---
You can't predict the shrine, it's supposedly random.  
---
You can just see what the average appearance frequency of a perk is.
---
He is not wrong.The rank 1 number is very high because the rank at the end game screen is what was used for the stats. So if you went into a game as rank 1, died and dropped to rank 2, you were counted towards rank 2. This means pretty much only people who survived were counted for rank 1, hence the 80%. This was explained by someone who works for BHVR, so it’s not speculation. In fact, I believe he said the actual survival rate for rank 1 is closer to 43%
---
I think the connection to Kobe and difficult shots is the overthinking part. It’s a stretch
---
There is no better way to play this game
---
Maybe but it would at least give people a reason to play different survivors
---
I wish a real life David King would show *me* some affection! Aww yeah!
---
Joking aside, yeah. I know it's not good to disconnect. I try not to if I can help it and I feel truly sorry when I need to duck out when I'm starting to freak- though I think if other people knew my history and why it was happening they might not feel so upset or mad about it. Hopefully they aren't anyway. I'm gonna work on it!
---
You seem to be taking this very serious for Reddit. I would suggest maybe Nathan Drake/Lara Croft for PS4/Xbox?
---
And then the killers you do get are just playing killer because they are bp whores.
---
When?
---
[Her legacy is different aswell.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/794234129529906328/3095001255C0D76E84D6EE0719F0F563B7FE1E98/)
---
The collapse kills are staggered across the survivors. One survivor dies instantly, one right after, one right after that, the pattern seems set even if other survivors are already dead. You may have been lucky enough to be the last survivor in the list, so you had just enough time to get out.
---
When I first started playing I thought the red eye/blindness icon meant you couldn't see people outside of the locker. Then the killer walked past and I realized it was just auras but they really shouldn't let you see out of them.
---
You mean people become the Legion or they grow up and become Legion players?
---
Feelsbadman
---
You joke like I wouldn’t buy that cosmetic lol
---
All I'm reading whenever someone points out that EGC now allows killers to BM now is "killers have been abused by toxic survivors these past few years!  Better be toxic to other survivors now the game allows killers to be toxic!"
---
 maybe I was just thinking a little while ago for maybe Xbox one version they can add Alan Wake as the Survivor
---
And 90% of the time they facecamp and tunnel
---
(Insert generic sword wielding fire emblem character here)
---
They would also be added as dlc for smash.
---
Honestly I don't see nintendo letting any of their beloved characters get put on a meat hook......except maybe Travis from No More Heroes.
---
I'm confused. You know that the collapse doesn't even start until after the exit gates are opened, right? The only point of it is to force survivors from holding the game hostage. Pausing it while a survivor has a trap wouldn't negatively impact the Pig in any way.
---
Please don't take this as an offence, but I wouldn't take the word of someone who says looping is easy, but at the same time picks killers that don't have to loop specifically because he doesn't wwnt to participate in looping
---
Personally I don’t see why Bill couldn’t be unlocked as L4D was released on console
---
As ZappedG/demonshonor said, luck does not affect them.  
---
  
---
Luck ONLY affects your chance of unhooking yourself, and saving yourself from a Trapper's bear trap.  
---
Run Plunderer's Instinct and Ace in the Hole for definite, and you can run Pharmacy if you want to get Emergency Med-Kits (Green Med-kits).  Pharmacy will also cause you to loot faster, but if you don't want the med-kits it's not too great to take.  
---
You could burn some coin offerings for the extra chests to loot to increase your chances of getting something good to take out of the match.
---
I’m just gonna pretend it’s because they are so constantly getting slashed to do their makeup
---
Tunnel good
---
DC bad
---
I really like the far left and the far right one. The sad face and the extent of it gets me. 10/10
---
Isn't that every killer, on every platform :)
---
I can't wait for ghostface to be memed as always leaning around Michael.
---
Can confirm
---
RNGesus really loves calm spirit
---
Don't know about the real numbers, but are you talking about chasing a survivor in a straight line, like you try to calculate on a basis of both you and the survivor following the same exact path? I don't think that is the way to see the problem if so. Most of the times it is used before the window/pallet zone to be there first or when in the window/pallet to slow down and mind game the survivor.
---
How did you obtain the numbers above, you mean Meters per second right? Even if it costs you .6 meters the most common killer speed is 4.6 mps and the survivor is always 4.0 mps.
---
Cool dude, very original
---
It's a joke about them becoming the Legion, knowing they're teenagers.

I haven't been paying too much attention to the shrine, I just use it to get bp
---
Standard move speed is loopable, stalking only works if the survivors are staring at the generators, and he still has to deal with pallets and windows.
---
He's definitely going to be usable, but he's not going to be top tier.
---
No, but yes.
---
because im an idiot at times and I didnt think of that
---
Appreciated!
---
You could try finding people that understand this and would play in a way that makes it okay to mess up in game. 
---
If you're ok Xbox, let me know. I'm currently a solo player that switch he'd between killer and survivor whenever it gets too sweaty.
---
Ace in the Hole + Plunderer's Instinct. Pharmacy gives a guarenteed green medkit on first search and makes you loot faster. Open Handed can make you see chest auras from further. If you really wanna be santa Ace use Bond so you can go find survivors to give them good items much easier.
---
I see, I asked because it can be interpreted both ways.
---
Wouldn’t it be a weird idea if it was like the entity pulled the idea of Michael from a collective consciousness of people lol like it pulls from the REAL world, but also from a collective? Enough people see the Shining and the entity is like “alright well here’s Jack to do my bidding”
---
I know dude, I just wanna hug her.
---
Farms
---
Nice! Default costume on point
---
Why??
---
This was a really good post! What made it easy for me to play as a survivor was to play as the killer for a few rounds here and there at first to get a feel of what it’s like for them. Once I realized they had a hard time finding people and were in first person, it made it so much easier to play as a survivor
---
The 2 second duration is its aura stickiness. The slow lasts indefinitely as long as they're in the gas cloud, and then once they leave the cloud, it will last for 2 more seconds.
---
**Haddonfun**
---
I'm getting mixed messages here &gt;:(
---
its the same state as the game was before go free on psn
---
whatever bhvr do on consoles the game will die soon or later
---
I know, I just want to able to use more of her addons.

I spoke lorewise. I dont believe in any god.
---
The middle are nice too, the second one is like the we happy few mask!
---
But what if I hate killers and survivors equally?
---
I'm on PC, but I thank you very much for your offer regardless. It means a lot.
---
A handful of people in this thread have offered to play with me and create a better environment to get me on my feet, and I'm super grateful of that.
---
BBQ aura is a little odd to use on hag, but good for points.
---
same on pc they seem harder to pick up
---
Glad I'm not alone. Me and my friends N E V E R get face camped or hardcore tunneled by anyone other than Russians. I've been keeping track for about a week now. Anyone can be toxic, of course, but in my experience, Russians are almost always toxic in one way or another.
---
Only with very specific add-ons.
---
He looks glorious.
---
Game is nothing close to that atm, there is just not balance between amount of survivors and killers on the console
---
I'll understand if it's only the mask license, but if it's also the movie license and we get a full Scream chapter, it'll be hard to be mad at anything Behaviour does in the future, lol.
---
Applying makeup by campfire is hard but they try their best, bless their hearts
---
Not Hell, not Purgatory either. Here are a couple of reasons why:
---
1. The Entity has the ability to cause actual concrete changes to real world according to the lore, but only in short spurts. Some examples include; driving Sally (Nurse) mad, transforming Lisa (Hag) into a monster to kill her cannibalistic tormentors. Lucifer works in influence and manipulation, specifically to prove his point that humans are flawed creatures and are the most capable of evil.
---
2. Most of the people in the Realm *never actually died*, most are stated as having disappeared, or their deaths are implied. Only one member of the cast has explicitly died, and that's Freddy, who's a friggin' demon, which leads to;
---
3. The one cast member that has been to Hell and back identifies the Realm as seperate from Hell. Freddy himself is a demon, who dwells in dreams, and he *has* been returned to hell when defeated, but when he was taken alongside Quentin, he didn't recognize *anything* about the transfer, no familiar energies, no colleagues, nothin'. His lore even states that he was modified by the Entity in ways Hell didn't, or couldn't.
---
4. Morality; Adam Francis is the very *model* of morality and kindness, his life was one of disipline, hard work, and charity. His final act before being taken to the Realm, was to save the life of a young child at the risk of his own. Now, does that sound anything like a person that would be taken to Purgatory, much less Hell, after death?
---
Exclusivity is never good. Bill got released because he was a Valve exclusive, and Valve only wanted Bill on PC. The chances of platform exclusive survivors is extremely low.
---
They CAN be good there but I think Myers would fare better
---
Things seem to point to it just being a killer, but then what would chapter 12 be? It'd either have to be something else coming out soon, or just a killer. Neither of those makes sense to me.
---
A bit bland, I admit.  But vital.
---
Good job. I, personally, would rat her out to the killer somehow and run to hatch.
---
Eh?
---
Can I join ur group I need people to practice with too
---
First I wanna say I'm sorry you went through all that.
---
And like many have already mentioned, always try to remember that it's only a game. 
---
A great tip that Sulgrey mentioned is play with friends! While this community can be annoying sometimes, there are good people. And those people aren't gonna judge how you play, even if you mess up.
---
Which we all do, I for sure mess up many times. But try your best not to let toxicity get to you.
---
I assume you play on PC so if you need another person on your friends list feel free to add me!
---
You're not wrong. I guess since they're more human than most of the killers - they probably feel like there is a chance.
---
Definitely! I've always thought from a lore perspective that surely they'd at least remember and know/try to counter it, even if it meant they still died.
---
Good for stealth killers and Trapper, pretty shit for everyone else.
---
Damn, that freddy one made sense. So if your case is right... Does that mean that in the DBD world actually no other gods than the entity exist? Was the Plagg actually praying to The Entity all along? Was The entity unkowingly an ancient religion as old as babylonia? Its sad that we dont have that much lore yet :/ But atleast we have our community and theories!
---
I'm honestly overwhelmed by the kind and sweet responses people have been giving me so far (since as I mentioned in another comment I half expected to be met with a shit ton of negativity because I'm a "disconnecter" even though my reason is so much more than a ragequit/butthurt). I'm only a month or two in so I'm nothing amazing, so I realize I'm bound to make dumb mistakes and that most people I play with, killer or otherwise, likely have a lot more time and experience under their belt. We all start somewhere and are dumb noobs in the beginning.
---
I'd be happy to play with you! Yes, I'm PC.
---
The Game. Its just so frusiting with like 3 floors to it, its hard to keep track of things.
---
If you don't think that way, whatever. Sorry for overreacting
---
❤️
---
Never heard of a meme before?
---
That was also that particular account's first and only post. Don't be so gullible. It's an edited image, like there's been a variety of (I remember a "Woodsboro" map screenshot, for instance - also obviously faked).
---
new DS is better than old DS, change my mind
---
there will be no balance when there is option of swf in this game
---
console players know it and thats way the game is almost dead
---
going free on psn just bought bhvr some time a year maybe
---
I can confirm that people are disconnecting randomly. It will show that the killer disconnected (notated by the plug icon beside the killer's name), but in reality you were dropped from the game. Last night, I was in a 3-person SWF, both my friends were disconnected at the same time, and they said that the killer disconnected (based on the plug icon), but I was still in game and the killer was still chasing me.
---
I think the entity was supposed to kill OP but maybe the devs haven't prepped for it the survivor was being carried by the killer, so there was no animation and she just got away freely.
---
That's cute as fuck, bro.
---
Do you remember when exactly?
---
Haddonfield? More like wtf are these bullshit ass fences like seriously devs please fix that shit
---
Id like to see the statistics on escapes after the hatch gets closed. The killer needs to go afk for you to be able to make it.
---
That's where the right friend will make a huge difference from "just a friend". The right friend will make sure to let you know you're doing great no matter what, and that they're proud of ya'.
---
I hate that I think Meg looks pretty hot like this, even despite those braids
---
OP in this context means "Original Poster," usually referring to the guy that made the post we see. 
---
It can also mean Overpowered when you're referring to something in-game
---
Huntress isn't op, don't get me wrong she's a good killer, but she isn't op, (unless their running iridescent head and infantry belt, that's a completely different story) there are plenty of ways to counter her hatchets, such as going around corners or walls, crouching in front of an object such as a truck or tires etc, and, well it takes a bit of practice, just outright dodging the usually works pretty well.
---
No less than 3 weeks ago I got the perk out of the shrine.
---
If they see you creeping on the hatch before they shut it I suspect it's close to 100%. 
---
After that it's down to map size and hatch position relative to gates.
---
Yeah but I think Left 4 Dead but more people see as a PC game than a console game, Team Fortress 2 and the half-life games
---
/shrug
---
To each their own. I thought this was too close to the first one.
---
Any tips for how to deal with an unlimited Tier 3 Myers?
---
New Leaked Survivor: Maine
---
I was just thinking that Travis Touchdown will be a good character
---
While I've been playing for a while, I've made probably thousands of mistakes, still do. 
---
I'll dm you my steam link so you can add me!
---
the cosmetic i use still make me hidden in corn so hahaha IM STILL IMMERSED
---
It's most likely because all the games are hosted on the killers' clients. The killer's actions always register first since there is no ping to another location.
---
David's actions had time to show up on the killer's screen but because of the delay, the killer closing the hatch registered first.
---
Had a similar experience also on this map, I finish the last gen and get run around by a Wraith with Noed. Get downed, other survivor's hiding in the shack and not at a door. Get hooked, Wraith camps me, she unhooks me, Wraith even though he has Noed up just chases me again. Continue to run the Wraith around, probably been chased about 3-4 minutes now, find Meg hiding in the basement waiting for the hatch, get downed again with Meg literally 2 feet away from me and the killer doesn't notice her somehow. I get hooked, Wraith camps, Meg takes hatch. More than enough time to open the door, I ask in the chat what she was doing and her and the killer just call me salty which yes I damn well was.
---
you know, i haven't encountered a toxic kate ever, and the only times there was one they usually are really bad. nice drawing anyways
---
Scream is probably my absolute favorite movie, and while I'd really also like the classic black robes, the new design is awesome.
---
I'd rather this happen to me than me getting camped all game because I tbagged once
---
a whole week? wow, talk about scientific rigor!
---
Just a follow up if bhvr wanted a fix to this issue give a soft ban to those who dc make them wait an hour or something to play again or make it so there isn’t a leave button
---
Thank you. I just learned my first Reddit term today
---
Wut
---
Gut punch when I spotted this, especially considering the only reason I prestige is for the cosmetics
---
In most cases the killer still has the advantage if they just manage to find the hatch a little bit earlier than the survivor. Now they just need to be more careful if they want to keep the survivor from jumping into the hatch.
---
Because of the 60-180ms delay, the killer should be able to close the hatch before the survivor is able to jump in.
---
It’s a bug in the icon for the shirt it still has the bloody arms
---
amanda op can't find box pls nerf
---
lol i can't unsee it now
---
They probably added it if a match was completely unfair, sandbagging survivors, working with killer, etc.
---
Best part is when they dc because they think you're a 4man with comms
---
Yamaoka's Estate. The bamboo and foliage makes spotting survivors so difficult.
---
No Shame at all, specially when they are good.
---
Can Myers stalk through the corn?
---
ur right! Originally it was more straight lines but it ended up looking a lil facist-y from certain angles and there was no way i was doing that
---
Its kinda the only thing he does well.
---
May someone please explain what the timer bar in the top of the screen means?
---
I don't get why they kept giving the girls homophobic makeup. Like isn't there one person at least who can give feedback on them while they're still working on them.
---
Reminds of that one The Office episode
---
pretty sure he was being sarcastic lol
---
All of them, I'm a shit killer
---
LockerDaddy
---
It’s the endgame collapse. When the timer reaches zero all survs who’re still alive get killed by the entity
---
Yeah I’m mostly a survivor main and when I went and played killer for the 1st time and it amazes me how fucking stupid some of these kids are. Legit will be in a chase with them they will turn the corner and try to hid in that corner and hope I just somehow walk passed and don’t see them. Like do they think I’m blind, just blows my mind.
---
Uhhh, but this is from killers' POV too. You can clearly see he jumps first. The action is already registered.
---
You can say what you said if this was from david's POV, but thats not the case.
---
lol the betrayal make Mikey mad
---
Happy ending :)
---
Thanks. I just got that for the first tine yesterday and lucky that we just left in time.
---
I think it's really important to remember that your presence in a game inherently helps other survivors.
---
If you go down in a chase? Don't DC when you get on the ground. You are taking up that killer's time in picking you up. Wiggle to the hook. The longer you take to get hooked, the longer your teammates have to do generators.
---
Getting camped? Longer for your teammates to do generators while the killer focuses on you. Get tunnelled off the hook? Waste the killer's time more. By DCing you are inherently taking time away that you could be serving as a distraction for the killer.
---
You never know what your teammates run, either, so in the time the killer is taking to pick you up if your teammate is slugged, they could be recovering for flipflop, unbreakable, etc. They could be crawling to hatch. DCing takes away that person's ability to use their perks or get to a more optimal place to DC, so always remember that even if you made a mistake, staying in the game increases your team's chances tenfold. 
---
It's also cruel to take away a killer's chance at kill points by DCing because of your own mistake, even if you're going to die, stay in so that killer gets their sacrifice points. You never know if they're working for an achievement or not, too.
---
Nea looks really good
---
My only issue with Sidney Prescott is: if they have the license for ghostface and movie, why is there no all black outfit like he always wore? 
---
If they only had the mask and not movie then his leaked outfits make 100% sense. But if we’re getting Sidney then I WANT MY ALL BLACK COSTUME
---
It's not. The idea that there should be some sort of exclusion zone around a hooked survivor makes no sense.
---
Killers find survivors by attempting to predict their actions. Gens, totems, injured and hooked players are all likely places to attract other survivors  so it makes sense to check them.
---
I play killer as I'd like the other killers to play when I'm a survivor.
---
If I'm hooked camping is unpleasant and boring so I don't do it myself. But I don't have an issue if the killer moves away and then checks back again over time.
---
why would you want to give content to 1/3rd of your playerbase and not to all of them?
---
As a survivor main, I never had a problem with hatch standoffs, because I just 99ed the remaining gens and then finished them, usually triggering the killer to leave the hatch and then leave myself.
---
People have already mentioned a lot of good advice and tips. One of the main things that helps is time in the correct environment.
---
Like others have said, playing with friends who are there to have fun with you and not only 'win everytime' is a good way to start adjusting your mindset. Plus having people to play with makes mostly anything better. They can also give you a pick me up when you're getting down or they notice you aren't doing so hot.
---
I'm still not the best at this game but if you need another person to play with you can add me
---
Sorry :(
---
3 floors? You playing The Game+ or somethin
---
Since always.
---
And entity help you if you spawn as the huntress there, So many corners twists and turns, And all those tall bamboo stalks blocking your hatchets.
---
ELIZA, GET TO THE COMVEE
---
The Entity being worshipped during the Plagues time does make sense, as they had multiple gods and the Entity directly communicates with people on both sides in the same language that she speaks. Plus, you gotta think Lovecraft rules, the Realm is its playground, but also its prison.
---
You said you mostly play killer right? Why not give survivor a shot? Just for a change of pace.
---
Da
---
It is *unbelievable* how well this stupid meme build worked in my favour. I made a couple of bizarre choices but holy crap, what timing.
---
To be a good survivor you need to play killer sometimes and understand how they play. To be a good killer you need to play some survivor games to understand how survivors play.
---
I hated the Game too. Then I realized the map is so small you can always do a 3 gen patrol and it is nearly impossible for the survivors to get their last gen. 
---
Always protect the 2 on the top floor near the middle + 1 gen in basement closest to the stairs. Don't spend too much time checking far away gens, protect those 3 and only a coordinated swf will be able to pop the last gen.
---
Oh and you have to eat all the pallets. Most of the pallets on that map are safe so honestly just facetank/break them because they'll only be an issue later.
---
Lol maybe, can't really tell since it's just words on a screen though. Bound to get whooshed at some point lmao.
---
[Reference.](https://youtu.be/1qnMrCuujzQ?t=10)
---
I like his add ons the most with either bone clapper or coxcombed clapper with ‘the ghost’ soot. It’s a surprise based build. The I’d run with it would be nurses calling, sloppy butcher, ruin, and spirit fury.
---
Wasn't this already posted?
---
It's kinda fitting to the character though
---
That's fine then, go straight to an exit gate and hope that the killer goes for the other exit or can't get to you in time
---
She needs more ways to gain Deviousness. Like maybe points for the amount of time someone had a trap on or pick the wrong Jigsaw box. Buffing ambush does nothing since it’s a chore to use without running the add ons for it and with the new killer it’ll be a straight downgrade
---
“Took a big fat L today, now my wrist is my new cutting board.”
---
All maps with Corn
---
Exactly.  That is a big reason why F13 is only gun with a full lobby of friends, to keep things honest
---
11/10
---
That’s pretty cool
---
Haddonfield, which is ironic since Halloween is my 3rd favorite series, behind Scream and Evil Dead
---
Everyone here saying it's lagswitch. I was thinking the reason could be your internet. This happens to me regularly as my wifi has huge amount of packet loss. Just doesn't look like a lagswitch very much. If you play on wired and you know that your internet is good. Well then ye, it's killer's potato connection.
---
Not to mention the small army of crows that are behind those fences giving you away if you even try to approach from behind those houses instead of the street, And all the fences are tall enough so you can't see any survivors,  And don't forget all the constantly safe Balanced landing spots there.
---
Perks: BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury/Make Your Choice.  
---
Add-ons:  
---
Good - Windstorm + Swift Hunt(works really well with SF)  
---
Fun - BattleBong(Bone Clapper + White Blink), Double Shadow + Dance all action speed perks, Ghost + Coxcombed Clapper.
---
Personally love the map but i agree it isn’t the best. Better than Coldwind for survivor at least. Killers popping out of no where with chainsaws is terrifying.
---
Sigh
---
*Unzips wallet*
---
&gt;Reply
---
The designers seem to not have a clue about aesthetics and fashion, its really annoying. I will happily give them money for skins if the skins were actually decent. Seems like they only know how to make skins for killers lol. Great job, especially on Kate!
---
I’m having the opposite problem on PC.  Instant as survivor and 10-20 minutes as killer.
---
is that from something? and what does the penis perk do?
---
Hatch standoffs are gone.  Pallet looping and flashlights are a core mechanic of the game.  Maybe just turn your messaging to friends only?  Git better at the game and teabagging will become less of an issue.  And like someone else suggested, if you get frustrated try survivor.  I’m on Xbox also, let me know if I can help in anyway.
---
this is the first time this has ever happened to me, my internet connection is very good
---
Had the same thing happen to me yesterday.
---
It's not "abusing" anything. The difference is that one has a definitive end (EGC). The other had the potential to be infinite.
---
This would completely change the game and be something the community as a whole is not asking for.
---
Type of Bug: Visual
---
Description: Unhooking survivors sometimes desyncs my character model and teleports my character to the hook so it looks like I'm unhooking the hook.
---
Description: After a survivor is unhooked, the hook still makes noises as if the Entity is present.
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Game randomly disconnects multiple players/survivors and acts as if the killer has disconnected (indicated by plug icon) even though the killer is still connected in the game.
---
I see
---
I would have a good attitude towards this game, but nope, the tunneling facecamping leatherfaces that nod and tbagging flashlight spamming swf are here to let me know otherwise
---
There is one youtuber that has a coaching series. It helped me tremendously.
---
its always the meme hair neas....
---
Visual
---
Kate's ponytail head doesn't clip right with her other outfits (the one it comes with is fine, however) and her neck is open allowing you to see inside her model.  
---
[Imgur Example](https://imgur.com/a/eljcVkg)
---
I am doing my best to give survivors a fun game at least. I dont really mind securing kills or ranking up so its all about having fun together.
---
Those posts are already against this subs rules so it really goes without saying.
---
Don't let him stalk you. Both addons drastically increase the time it takes to get to T3. He has to have line of sight to stalk, and corn will break that if your're on a farm map, so make sure you are ducking around objects and behind them as much as possible. It's possible to get all the gens done and escape before he hits T3, but once he does the match is basically over unless you go full stealth.
---
I don't get that one.
---
Damn that's well done.
---
Oh… you’re right. I went back and look and you already did everything there was to do :/
---
Well, a big thank you because they are awesome ^^
---
Looping IS easy. It is just tedious and unfun (imo). I prefer to skip it altogether. I never said I couldn't do it, or that I couldn't catch those that do.
---
Wraith is still one of the weaker killers in the game.
---
&gt;another coward with friends. learn to play the fucking game tryhard faggots.
---
-Doctor who'd zap people to tier 3 and then leave them alone
---
I'm gonna exact my revenge for all of the times survivors t-bagged at pallets and the exit gates. It will be glorious
---
I haven't been banned on Live yet and it looks like they closed the servers on the Dev Build.
---
Still, use at your own risk.
---
You literally have no idea what you’re talking about behavior posted the actually FACTUAL stats and survivors don’t even have a 50% survival rate not even a 4 man swf
---
I know but I had to main a weak character to consider myself good. Billy is one of the meta characters and that shit's ~gay~ cheap
---
Is that what the doomsayer category is? I read that as being about rage quitting but that was probably wrong of me. It just seems like they’re all over the place and it’s like nobody friggin cares that you stopped playing the game!
---
People just get mad after being spanked and take out all their frustrations on Reddit.
---
That’s all killers do is piss and moan about not being able to kill everyone. I main as clown and that’s hard enough in its self. But nobody will ever be happy until the kills are handed to them. I barely ever get a 4K. I mainly get 2-3
---
right. Meters per second. My point is it costs 1.8 meters distance to throw it. But only buys you 1.2 meters gained. A 0.6 meter deficit. They would need to be slowed for 4 seconds to even make it worth it. Thats PER bottle
---
You’re the first person I’ve encountered on this sub to at least understand where I’m coming from.  Most ppl just downvote me when I try to talk about this.
---
The survivors did a lot wrong and I only watched the first two minutes.
---
You forgot Nea.
---
hahaha
---
so glad we've got people encouraging them to continue making stupid shit instead of fixing the game
---
I'm so sorry to hear you went through that, it is utterly horrifying how much a supposed loved one can affect us negatively and hurt someone like this. You are going through a lot of understandable pain, and its really admirable you make this post. I hope previous advice has helped already but I'll chuck in some more reinforcement.
---
You play for you, now. Own it. I understand how you feel about not wanting to let others down and the fear of failure, but even the best survivors made mistakes and still do. It is very human to do so, and to stick to a game to the end even if mistakes are made is far better than leaving. Anxiety is difficult to overcome, I can't say I have conquered it myself, but I have started to talk back to it. You play this game because you enjoy it, embrace what you love about it!  The doubt and thoughts will try and bring you down, you're in a different place now, not even yourself has a right to treat you like this. Maybe in these games you fear doing badly, you end up making a great move that saves someone. We are always learning and you never know how a game will end up! Most people forget mistakes quickly in this game, and trust me, everyone makes them. And that's okay!
---
I would offer to be a teammate but I'm on PS4. I do agree playing with some good, chill people like friends would help you a lot. Your ex was a horrible person, all the more kudos for you for doing your best to move on, my heart goes out to you.
---
I wish you all the best. That horrible part of your life is behind you, I know it takes much time to heal but I can tell you absolutely want to, and I believe you are going to. You can do this, we support you!
---
faces look like trash in this game. Please fix Ash and post it here and send to the devs. Bloated grandpa putty that looks nothing like the real Bruce or the dbd promo art.
---
did you mean to imply that adrenaline will heal the plague's attack?
---
Yamaoka estate, way too big.
---
The guys making this merchandise are not the guys coding the game.
---
Thanks!
---
Yup. The worst is when you get a cross map trap (thereby unable to capitalise) and it does nothing toward your progress.
---
cool. fire the merch guys and hire better coders. easy solution
---
Why did he carry you over to the exit gate, I wonder?
---
This sounds like me and my friends we had a “friend” who would get on to us if something went wrong or if something happens to him we overall fell into a void of anxiety. 
---
He would always mentally abuse us and manipulate us to but him stuff do things we never wanted to do. We eventually left got over it and left it behind us 
---
A couple tips I learned where that mistakes that happen in game are not always your fault or even the teams fault it may just be up to bad luck. Other things just such as minor fails from my experience no really cares like okay that happened moving on. And as for toxics just ignore them. my tip is quick gg and leave. If you feel overwhelmed go in a locker take a breath and remember...In the end games are for fun have a good time go out there and meme and have a blast if your not having fun the try something els you really shouldn’t have to worry about your mistakes in the end it dose not effect your life.
---
Just don’t take every little mistake or imperfection out on yourself because your beautiful in every way, your strong and caring. You deserve way better then toxic friends sorrowed yourself with caring people and if you want someone to play with or just talk to you have a amazing group right here.People do care for you. I would personally like to play with you and help out anyway I can just remember you can get over this!!! 
---
(Just woke up from a nap sorry for any spelling and grammar mistakes because ya know my brain don’t want to work)
---
All im trying to say is, it might be killer, it might be not. You can be disconnected from killers' for many reasons. That screen doesnt actually mean anything. Im just trying to offer some advice that in case it is not, you can find some potential problem by checking your own connection. No harm in taking extra steps to prevent it from happening again.
---
I'd be happy to add you! I play on PC, and have Discord too!
---
Yeah, I had a very previously ingrained "if you don't win you're trash why do you bother playing" type of a mentality tattooed into my mind so it's hard to try and knock myself down from that plateau I was screamed at to stay on and just be able to mellow out and play the game in a more chill fashion. I've had many people offer to play with me on here as well that I know will be gentler on my mistakes so I think that's a really good step towards healing.
---
Yeah true lol, I was just trying to imply that sarcasm is more difficult to identify when it's done via text compared to saying it out loud, and as I tried to convey sometimes people just don't catch the sarcasm like what just happened to me.
---
i believe the answer is yes
---
Nurses calling is surprising good on hag. Combined with M&amp;A you sneak up on people.
---
I don’t think survivors get to keep their bloodpoints when they DC, that only happens if the killer disconnects.
---
In an all new story that's sure to have you humming along, whether you like it or not.
---
Also, one thing I was looking at is OP's top right bp counter. Shouldnt he gotten more?
---
If we're being brutally honest, no killer is trash when you're playing against trash survivors. They were giving you constant free hits and not one of them looked like they knew how to loop. 
---
I love playing Freddy. But when you go up against good survivors who know how to waste your time, you'll start to see how bad he can be.
---
Why does ash look nothing like Bruce or the promo art you made for him? Love Evil Dead - hate cosplaying grandpa.  Why have the voice lines in the lobby at all? They stick out like crazy and don't fit. You guys made the choice of not having voices in the game to keep it international - stick with it.
---
Great shot tho
---
When you don't understand what it means to "hold the game hostage".
---
They were pretty much at the same time, and that makes a big difference. A few milliseconds off but still.
---
The killer's client most likely didn't register david's actions, hence why the killer was still able to close the hatch a few milliseconds after david had started the animation.
---
Because of these two incompatible actions happening at the same time, the killer's action overrides David's.
---
And of course they respond in the chat with "lmao EZ XD"
---
You can watch some of the best streamers and YouTubers who play this game and you will see them make mistakes (maybe not as many as us randoms haha) but they definitely do so honestly if I’m playing badly I just accept that today I’m not feeling it. Sometimes if I’m playing awful as survivor I switch over to killer and just mess around with the survivors, maybe farm a little, have fun with the game to remind myself that this game CAN be fun. 
---
I’m sure you’ve had hundreds of offers but if you play on PC let me know I’ve never played SWF and would love to play with people and have fun with the game :)
---
Wow, we timed out conflicting reply perfectly. LOL
---
Looking at the top right, I think he didnt get any. It only shows that he got points, it never gave him any points
---
[what the David said](https://imgur.com/gallery/ph6K2CL)
---
Oh, hm, might be that glitch where it shows you the results of the previous match instead of the match you were just in.
---
As you were.
---
He's to good for the no skill required to play him. Right click to down someone, it's BS
---
How do I delete other people’s posts?  Asking for a friend
---
Because the entire point of Scream and Ghostface was that anyone could be wearing a cheap mask they could buy at a convenience store and do horrible horrible things?
---
"It's a simple formula; EVERYONE'S A SUSPECT!"
---
Ok fine, but still. There's no reason to do this. Just wasting everyone's time.
---
You would have really shit your pants if you had to earn unlocks like video games used to.
---
Still get the perks, I can’t see an issue with the idea.
---
Not really too related to a hatch escape, but maybe someone can still explain it to me.
---
2 days ago I was playing with 2 friends and so we had 1 random. We ALL escaped random person included but we all knew she didn't do anything all game it was practically a 1 v 3. Either way, at the post-game scoreboard I noticed that some how, even though escaping gives 5000 points, the random only had I think it was 4.6k or 4.9k points.
---
I don't even understand how the hell as a survivor, you can get LESS then 5k points with an escape. You literally 5k for an escape, you could be 100% AFK and ignored the entire time by everyone getting 0 points, then walk out and escape for 5k. How do you get less then 5k?
---
its a joke
---
Ghost face
---
It entirely depends on how good the doctor player is and how good the survivors are. He is S tier at rank 20
---
i was here before the post BLEW UP baby .  Gold me when this post gets like 1,5k upvotes or smth
---
Coldwind Farm.Because why not give it to me 3 times in a row to punish me for having poor corn vision,smh
---
🤔
---
Maybe idk if they were taken off the hook
---
I can agree to an extent--He has some upsides and downsides like any killer. It just depends on category and perspective. In other words, in what categories is he good and where is he shit? 
---
Here's my list:
---
+Finding and Accurately Tracking Survivors 
---
+Generator and Healing Pressure 
---
+Slugging 
---
+Stealth 
---
-Reaction Time 
---
-Pallet Looping 
---
-Ineffective Power in Chase 
---
-Defensive Strategy
---
It seems like a lot of people commenting here have had a "friend" like my ex. It's comforting that I'm not alone in that regard, but sad that so many people have had to put up with that garbage.
---
I'd love to play with you too! All these offers to play with me and help me have a good time is super heartwarming! I'm on PC if you'd like to message me and share details.
---
Thank you so much for your kind and wonderful words.
---
My guess is that since the Entity can pull survivors from different realms and universes at any point in time, outfits are just survivors from different universes/points in time. This would also give an in-game explanation to having multiples of the same survivor
---
With tongue
---
It's a perfect map for scratched mirror Myers.
---
Funny.
---
Okay cool! I'll pm you my steam profile. 
---
It's rather hard to change but it is possible. Just requires time and support from others. I'm glad you're progressing towards healing because I know how difficult that can be
---
i really poor one
---
They should really just give the killer bonus BP at the end of a match for each SWF there was. It wouldn't solve the issues with SWF, but it would certainly make it more palatable and fair for killers.
---
I had a game the other night where I got absolutely devastated, along with flashlight clicking, body blocking, instant heals, teabagging, etc
---
I was sooooo mad. Post game chat, I got things like "Woooooow" "Why when play killer if you suck so much" etc
---
I took the biggest breath I've ever taken and wrote back, "Thanks for the good game, guys! We all got a lot of points, that's awesome! Good luck out there!" Or something
---
And like the 3 that stayed were like "Oh, okay. I like your spirit! Keep practicing, you'll get better!" And stuff like that
---
And the whole time I was just thinking I hate all of you, please burn
---
But I didn't go there
---
Sometimes you gotta kill them with kindness
---
I was still upset with them
---
But hatred only leads to more hatred, and all that
---
No shock Big cock Doc
---
I did this the first day of the update since i wanted to see the entity kill the survivor xD
---
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. Even pro e-sport gamers have big fuck ups sometimes and it takes insane amounts of practice to get to that level of good (not saying I'm after that, just that nobody is perfect). I've learned to chuckle at myself sometimes if something funny happens, like when I lead a Trapper into his own trap or the time I turned a corner and tried to enter a window the same second a Myers was climbing out.
---
I do play on PC and I think it would be wonderful to make more people to play with! Thank you so much for your offer and words.
---
There will be no survivor with this killer.
---
Farmer John 😂
---
True. I think it should more accurately represent a Killer's skill level (which it doesn't right now) but maybe that's just me. Otherwise it's not really a huge issue.
---
They tried. In a Scream documentary I saw it said they saw a mask in though house they bought for a set and just knew it had to be that one. They tried to make their own versions, but none were as good as the one they found.
---
More I say, more!
---
did he hit you right after your adrenaline popped? i can't really tell
---
Not confirmed.
---
This reminds me of a legend that I can't remember the name or geographical location of. I believe it was mentioned in "Ant-Man and the Wasp" and "Rise of the Tomb Raider"
---
Grabs, NOED, Moris, Devour hope, and Rancor are decent counters to Mettle that's available to all killers, I've found.
---
For more killer specific, chainsaws, traps, stalking, feral frenzy, and ambush attacks, all deal damage without feeding Mettle.
---
Someone got facecamped recently.
---
That's the first thing I thought of when I started playing is "Wow what the fuck is happening? What even is anything? What? Who was that? Where? WHY!?" and people were just like "Yeeeah it's a rough game to get into" since the tutorials didn't even really cover much other than the basic objectives.
---
Thanks for your reply and your encouraging words. :)
---
I main Freddy, I'm posting this in the hopes of helping people understand he's not bad, to play as.
---
Does that mean the killer only comes with one perk? Since that's all we've seen
---
That's because to many swf. I play killer and see the same teams all the time.  When I play killer and do good I get dc and if not a good game  team goes BM.  When I play survivor I get hook farmers and people who dc .  So people party up and no killers . we on the ps4 that's our community.  Don't play killer because all the swf .  Don't play solo because the hook farmers and dc that screws you. So we have nothing but shit killers who farm because that's the only way to win for them because survivors will rush for saves. Its a catch 22. When I play killer I don't farm but I also never double pip because the dc meta .
---
yes.. i went to message him and his bio said “professional face camper” so i left it and im still super salty
---
No lie. Used to hit rank 1-3 easy a few months ago. Now I can't get higher than 9. Kinda glad though, I like that SWF groups arent always ruining your day in these ranks. They only do it sometimes.
---
Cold wind farm maps of course, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone else mention Ormond, you can’t see auras and the middle building is full safe pallets that you can’t mind game
---
Dont know if this has been mentioned yet.
---
Ps4 Spitit
---
After using her phase the her direction (right stick) jitters about by itself.
---
For some reason most of my teammates never get that idea
---
Yep you don't get any points if you finish the gen. If you stop doing the generator before finishing you get the points. Happens on PC too btw.
---
This is NOTHING compared to what survivors used to be able to do. Slugging isnt fun. I get it. But it still isnt as bad as hatch standoffs or survivors sending so much time in a match even after the doors had been opened. Just to troll and keep you from your next match.
---
True that true that.
---
Back then exit gates wouldn't be powered at all unless all gens were already complete, so your only option would be to risk your life and finish doing gens or try to win a hatch stand off. Most people went with the latter and killer was basically powerless to do anything about it besides give up. Now the power has been shifted to favor the killer (1 killer &gt; 1 survivor) but the survivor still has an escape method.
---
Again, I'm aware. I used an image **template** for the image above. It's a **meme**, this was already brought up earlier. 
---
I don't control the text as it was a **template**
---
I got both of mine Rory thank you so much again! They’re beautiful!❤️
---
Damn why does Huntress get cosmetics like every update lol
---
Doing gens, you?
---
It's okay Michael, I'll always love you most. &lt;3
---
Pig obviously wants to see the entity get you. That’s reason enough.
---
Unless you are playing survivor in which case they are still potatoes for some reason.
---
Like the best part of the game is post game chat. The salt is invigorating.
---
every map besides the preschool
---
I honestly think dbd is at its all-time worst at the moment.😣😣
---
Wouldn't be surprised.
---
The Claudette skin with the red lipstick looks soooo much better. I wish that's how the real version looked.
---
Any chance you are touching the touchpad?
---
using end game mechanics  &gt; everyone cries if they dont make it out 
---
LOL
---
If you can dodge a makarov you can dodge a hatchet
---
Gas Heaven. More like pallet heaven.
---
Yea I wouldn’t call it a meme build. It’s meta for sure.
---
Hot
---
Not when you play killer
---
If the killer closes the hatch, you can open the exit gate  
---
If they don’t close it, the gens aren’t blocked and you can do them and escape as normal. 
---
There is counter play where before there was none. This is why it was changed and is not an instant win either way any more.
---
I have no idea how this is possible tbh. There is no way to get negative points oO That's weird
---
Doesn't really help if I want to continue playing the game.
---
Omg macmallian estate. The blue makes it hard to see.
---
Bsacally anything that isnt a normal attack.
---
Is it StreamDad?  Please tell me it's StreamDad.
---
Every Time you feel you fucked up watch streamers with 1000s of hours go down at their first jungle gym because they got the confused. Also I feel like in this game it is really easy to fuck up and you will get punished for it harder than in other games.
---
All I ever learned was how to get yelled at while holding the flashlight
---
I'm afraid it's not StreamDad. It's RoryDiesALot, she's very nice and has a nice community. They play lots of other games too.
---
Wait..... is Tapp getting cosmetics?
---
If you dodged that bullet then just imagine how easy it will be for you to 360 killers then :D
---
My situation was a little similar to yours, but you have it much worse than I did. Anyways, I used to absolutely REFUSE to play online multiplayer games because first of all, I have social anxiety, so any game where I have to talk to other people is a no go. So, when I found dbd and saw that talking online to people wasn’t a requirement, I thought to myself hm maybe I can suck it up and play this game. I started out just playing swf matches and being too scared to play on my own cause I didn’t wanna fuck up and have people think I’m trash or insult me. I’m sort of like you in the sense that I take criticism very harshly on myself. But, I started to really think about it like it IS just a game after all and we all make mistakes and these people I’m playing with online don’t even know my first name so their opinion of me really doesn’t matter. I used to feel so much anxiety just in the loading screen alone but after playing a bunch of matches I’ve gotten better with accepting I’m going to make mistakes and that’s okay. It’s just a game, after all. I’m glad that you are getting therapy now! I hope you continue to do that for yourself because you should be able to enjoy something as simple as playing a video game. Your ex’s opinion is the LAST one you should be listening to because the only people’s opinion you should be listening to are the ones who actually know you, care for you, and respect you, and your ex did not care for you if he made you suffer from panic attacks from yelling at you because of a video game. It sounds like he has some major growing up to do and as terrible as this all is, I hope you can learn from this and grow into a stronger person from it. Remember, things always get better.
---
Love, a fellow dbd player❤️
---
I mean as in the exact replica of the face. Not just colors. So like you see Dwight's face on Bubba.
---
I love the mental image of outrunning this little toy and just hearing a distant "***FUCK*** you!" shouting behind you.
---
Okay first of all, don’t feel guilty for leaving. It may not be the best thing to do but I feel like because of your trauma, your choice to quit is more understandable than other situations. This game can be so frustrating in general aswell. Sometimes it’s not even about skill and just about luck. And there’s plenty of players who rage quit simply because of their ego or they were triggered over some petty shit. So in comparison to that I think you should ease your guilt a little and not be so hard on yourself if you choose to leave. It’s just a game and the players in your lobby will move on to another match instantly forgetting the previous one.
---
Also positive affirmations helps a lot of people. For every negative thought you feel say the complete opposite out loud. Root for yourself. If you mess up, use it as a learning experience. Nobody is perfect so don’t forget that. Don’t let the toxic voice inside your head control you. ❤️ And I think playing with positive people will help your mindset change from your past experience.
---
first thing that came to mind was your dog humping the pillow 
---
LOLOLOLOL
---
Higher levels they are shunpoing to gens and shit
---
damn is he single 👀
---
ye, some real kbaane shit
---
Actually, It does.

The reality is that even a glass of wine can hurt your non-born child.   
---
Is drinking just one glass of wine safer than a bottle por day? Than 3 bottles por day? Yes. But that doesnt mean is SAFE. You really shouldnt go to people and tell them that limited drinking is safe, because there is some people out there that isnt going to make the slightest of researchs.
---
When timer runs out while carrying a survivor, the killer just drops them. I tested that almost immediately. It plays the animation as if I pressed "r" and they were killed in the dying state
---
&gt; Chucky can climb on objects and jump on top of survivors to damage them
---
&gt; Chucky can’t break pallets but can do a quick crawl underneath the pallet.
---
Time to loop and stay in open areas where he can't jump on me!
---
I lol’ed at this comment. Justice has been served.
---
Right? Had it coming.
---
Yeah. I've seen that happen a lot I just rather not die on my first hook. I will though I usually still pip without escaping.
---
I love how simplistic it looks
---
Wrong
---
Ahh I see, so it's a good place to test stuff out! That's good to know! :D
---
I want to see the same thing that happened to Fallout 4...  ANIME
---
I’m sorry you had such an emotionally abusive gf :( people who makes others feel bad when they talk about something they love are the actual scum of the earth. Glad you still play dbd regardless❤️
---
Hahaha! True, true!
---
If you dc after this it would only be more satisfying
---
You get slowed for 2 seconds after leaving the gas cloud, so the survivor is slow downed much longer than 2 seconds.
---
Oh I think she should have fatigue or stun not both. I understand that frustration but instead of changing that they removed the feature all together.
---
How does this encourage people to farm if they get downed because of it? &amp; Yea downing them is a good idea but the farmer could reach a loop in that amount of time and I rather just make them pay
---
Pikachu skin for Doc pl0x
---
Haha! Survivors are little shits, gotcha! I guess we all make major fuck ups sometimes. I'll try and take it easy. :) Thanks for all the advice.
---
From 1 year to now:
---
Survivor: Mettle of man is the new one you have to look. Dead Hard is pretty common too. Decisive strike is not meta.
---
Killer: Ruin, BBQ AND CHILLI, nurses calling, Monitor and abuse is still META. new perks that are good is corrupt intervention, Hex:Haunted ground and discordance, although I don’t think they are meta.
---
I’m not a Pro, this is what I see. So other opinions are welcome.
---
A toxic Jake? Jakes are the least toxic players omg
---
God damnit, you got me. 🤣
---
Is it me or does that look like monto?
---
I love itttttt 😍😍😍😍 you’re so talented!
---
On the other hand though we all get that wave of euphoria when ruin stays up for way longer than it should.
---
I've seen some hilarious fail/funny moment clips on youtube of random, bizarre shit killers or survivors have done to each other and it's absolutely hilarious. I hope to get more games like that. :)
---
