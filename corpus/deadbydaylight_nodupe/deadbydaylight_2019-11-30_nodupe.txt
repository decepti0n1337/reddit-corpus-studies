Someone got downed. I need unhooks for the Tome like everyone else, so I headed towards the hook to free my mate. He had kindred and helpfully summarised the bullshit gameplay experience BHVR have created with this latest tier of the rift

Thank you for letting me go üòä #KateDensonMain
---
Didn't even bother checking. My bad. Realized it gives 100 instead of 0.
---
I mean they literally did that. Problem being is both Claudette and Trapper who the tome is based off have kind of uninteresting perks. There's not much you can do with Brutal Strength, Agitation, Unnerving Presence, Empathy, Self Care, Botany Knowledge, and a power as simple a Trapper's.
---

---
If you didn't notice we have had challenges involving all 6 of their perks already, escaping specifically as Claudette and trapping survivors.

I wish they'd make changing challenges easier. It's such a fucking pain to switch between every match, and god help me if I forget to change one more time.
---
Like, had they not told us yesterday that it would be today- then fine. But to say that and then say they need more time? A full week? That‚Äôs a fuck up.
---
Or just generally better than console
---
I am a low rank. Just now started getting into it
---
She had a hex, camped and annihilated us then camped on all 3 next to each other it happens..
---
r/TheLegionLegion
---
I read this as "this is a facial"
---
What is the error?
---
At this point she can jumpscare me sometimes but usually it's just "God fucking dammit not this shit again"
---
Ehhhh no not really, outside of just he hardware advantage it's really the same. PC just sweat more no matter the game, if there is any hint of competitiveness at all y'all go wild
---
Yes, as a killer main and not really all that good. I have the 90% of survivor that‚Äôs nice. But the remaining 10 can really ruin your day
---
All you have to do is be working on it as it‚Äôs finished you don‚Äôt have to do the 100%
---
Slow the game down just a little bit..... about 15 seconds to be precise
---
Nutty! Lol i swear I thought i just had to fully complete them from start to finish you know lol
---
Got confused im in both subreddits
---
It took me 3 games to get that one, it‚Äôs not the hardest but you do have to just hope that the killer leaves you alone
---
I never said he is shit.
---
Sacrifice 5 killers to the Dwight. Must be done while playing as entity.
---
I was wondering why it was 100 cells more, I didn't even realize buying the killers unlocked the corresponding survivors lol. I don't play survivor almost at all though so I can see why I missed it. 
---
It's still strange to me that Ghost Face never came with a survivor or a map. I think having Sidney/Dewey as survivors would have been cool. Also a map based on the house party at the end of Scream 1.
---
They can‚Äôt see what I am doing ... sometimes I pop gens slash another person and still..: I am tunneler
---
Seriously though haha, the luck has to be real! Also with being in the purple rank it's rough
---
REMEMBER ME, MICHAEL?!
---
Hmph !
---
I kinda have fun playing legion
---
Especially their ability, basically a stand. It makes survivors DC once they see you
---
You gotta respect Frankie's hustle there ain't no breath holes in that mask.
---
You have unlocked god mode
---
Next week doesn't mean next Friday. It could happen on Monday or (more likely) Tuesday.
---
It is a console spirit, so you never know üòú

Mediocre? In what world?
---
Yea, dozens, i think there are at least 7 of us, but we are good.
---
Mmyup
---
Middle yes. Farthest away? No,  best way to get three genned you did those last.
---
Well, if u bought it with cells, it doesnt. I buy the dlcs directly, which also unlocks survivors which I  do play with friends. It may have higher price because it is relatively new. You are right that it is weird that our spooky boi doesnt have a map or a survivor tho
---
You could say the same thing about nurse before they changed her add-ons ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
What perk are people upset about?
---
Which is utter BS. I've put 70 hours in the game since rift release, have finished all of tome 1, 2, and half of three, and I'm rift rank 36.

Killers want survivor perks nerfed because of "sweaty swf." Those types a swf's are extremely rare to go against.
---
I can imagine jason being the awkward friend that really is just there for no reason.
---
It's been said before, but I'm glad with the changes, for now. They're taking baby steps adjusting her, so she doesn't get nerfed straight to the bottom tier, and then thrown off to the side and ignored because she's 'not frustrating to play against, so who cares'.
---
I wish this would get fixed already... Having to wait 15 minutes for a Survivor game only to be given those error messages back to back is really infuriating.
---
DS, at a point i remember someone saying Spine Chill bc it gives off stealth killers, Prove Thyself, etc.
---
I understand why OoO bc SWF abuse it. But for someone like me who is solo queue, I have no such benefit. Why should I be punished for things SWFs abuse?
---
Because his power hinders his map pressure, and was designed to waste time. In the time you spent positioning yourself and being unseen with your gangly ass robes flying everywhere you could‚Äôve just hooked them through M1
---
I love it! She looks amazing! As always your art is simply stunning! üíñ
---
I dont understand people's problem with clown
---
It was lol and i was the nancy
---
Lery‚Äôs, Hawkins, and The Game are probably his best map. I would recommend you try getting the achievement in those maps
---
Yeah exactly. There is a difference between SWF and solo queue. Perks that work well in solo queue can be abused with SWF. So then when they get super nerfed, SWFs find other exploits while solo ppl get fun drawn out of their games
---
I already got it days ago. Not hard lol
---
Every killer in the game is viable at the red ranks. The ‚Äúweakest‚Äù one has a 60% kill rate.
---
Buy ghostface with real money, because then you can buy spirit with iridescent shards.
---
This speaks to me on so many levels lol
---
Any reason I have 14 dislikes? Lol
---
If you do the difficult challenges, then they'll just be made easier with no consideration for people who did them already.
---
If you don't do them, then they'll give a nice reward for people who struggled through them.
---
Unless you're a lucky person, you're guaranteed to be screwed over a bit.
---
That‚Äôs why I love Franklin‚Äôs Demise!
---
This isn't terrible. It's not great, but I've seen much worse than this.
---
like cool attraction or it turns you on both are fine
---
Rrrrreeeeeeeeeee.
---
The entire thing honestly feels way too grindy and unfun. I assume I'm going to fall short of making it to T70 unless I absolutely push myself.
---
Nothing about it is very fun, and on top of it you have to continually make sure you select your challenges, and when you fuck up you waste an entire game and it feels dog shit.
---
It honestly feels like they wanted to snatch as much money from players as possible, first by tricking people into spending $10 they can't get back out of the game, and secondly by making it as annoyingly grindy as possible so people with more money than brains or time to play will buy the tiers they have left.
---
I've paid for a crap load of battle passes or battle pass style content (including well before people called them "battle passes") and honestly this feels like a grab for money rather than a play for content to keep people playing and interested while also making money, like they normally do.
---
Don't know why we'd expect anything less from BVHR though.
---
By the time they fix the challenges I'm gonna end up finishing them all.
---
I mean ds is pretty free. I also only solo queue and always bring it. Its super annoying tho when others dont bring it. Like its the best perk in the game everyone should be running it.
---
3 games after this have at least 2 red ranks ... and they are gooood
---
If you dont play for a few months. This does happen legit sometimes.
---
True. I saw a rank 9 get matched up with all red ranks
---
There is a less than zero chance they give a reward to those who already completed the challenge. Its BHVR
---
Welp, back to grinding.
---
They can be confusingly worded sometimes.
---
Bull shit, I've played battle passes in plenty of games, and they're never pure grinds for lackluster skins that we've been told you can just buy later, or are ALREADY up for sale...
---
What the fuck are you on about?
---
Yeah I dont know what is going on with the ranks but they gotta fix this
---
But in both add ons it is taking less time to do something but both increase and decrease are used to explain the same thing. They are written poorly.
---
LMAO
---
And if you don‚Äôt do that you are stuck on the challenge for days as opposed to doing the several a night
---
Wraith was carrying her out, duh
---
Not an alternative power, but I don‚Äôt think frenzy should start running out until you hit someone.
---
Light mode bad
---
Demogorgon is fun but his perks are awful. Spirit has Spirit Fury and Haunted Ground and is obviously a very good killer. Freddy is braindead strong and easy to play at the moment but his perks arent good 
---
Up to you
---
Overcharge, tier 2 madness, tier 5 huntress lullaby, unnerving presence, spine chill. Anything else to make the skill checks worse?
---
### C U R S E D
---
Yeah exactly, especially for killers who hard tunnel. I have games where killers will tunnel me bc i stun them and loop them. So DS helps me during those situations.
---
I don't expect them to, but when I don't do the challenges  I won't be surprised if they do give a reward
---
Kills =/= Medals
---
It's not that hard... avoid gens that are far on the corners of the map, if you see 2 gens too close only repair one, if possible the one nearest the center, and if you see someone working on a gen don't work on a gen thats close
---
Had a full team rocking that perk against me. Even though I was the killer, lockers became my ultimate enemy that game... I was scared of every single locker I saw.
---
Bill, lithe is extremely good but it can be replaced by other exhaustion perks, BT can‚Äôt really be replaced
---
Time to play prayer beads spirit or forever freddy. Not everyone wants to play the best killers. I want to play Trapper or Huntress but they‚Äôre pretty shit right now.
---
Yeah if rift fragments are based solely off of experience gained in a match (i.e. 800 is needed for each fragment) then you'd need to spend on average like 13 minutes and 20 seconds in a match (you get one point every second) without counting the exp you get from emblems (which is just +6/12/18 for each Silver/Gold/Iri emblem).
---
I gotta find that totem man
---
not wearing the hospital gown. that -30% is deserved
---
Don't camp and you're fine everything else is fine don't listen to salty survivor mains that don't know what their talking about, your toxic but somehow them teabagging and not just escaping is not.
---
Ahh yes the 'your not a X so you cant comment on X' excuse.
---
Again, this is BASIC functionality, like bare minimum that a QA pass should be running through, completing all challenges in a closed environment. The only reason something like this would not be caught is either
---
1. There was so many other critical bugs (Like game crashes bugs) that it was put on low priority and never fixed, which speaks for the game health overall if that is the case.
---
2.There was not a QA pass and as such it was not noted
---
or
---
3.It was noted, but since its a bug that simply slows progression on a event designed to be a grind, they elected not to fix it immediately.
---
Im not speaking out of my ass here either, i do actually have a insiders perspective into game QA, and again, this isn't some minor bug either, this is not like the UI does not update or something, again this is basic functionality for the challenge 'have the challenge count'.
---
Plus lets not pretend the game is a unwavering in its stability, DBD has consistently, almost every update, had major bugs sneak though that make entire perks and items literally not function. Again its not that fucking unreasonable that at bare minimum the challenges function. Especially when the Bugs are so consistent that a QA pass would have easily picked them out.
---
Again you act like its such a insane unreasonable thing that people expect the game to work. Expect that bugs should be rare situational occurrences/or so minor hiccups as opposed to 100% consistent occurrences that directly effect everyone who interacts with the new content.  
---
Ultimately its the principle of the situations, the game is constantly unstable, we should not be having such frequent significant bugs every patch, the community should not have to do a QA pass to figure out what content does not work on any given patch, and the fact the devs have outright said they have no intention of forgoing a chapter release to do a Game health chapter just means that issues like these are going to keep happening.
---
Theres also billy, GF.
---
Since the release of stranger things, I‚Äôve gotten to p1 with ghostface and Myers and p2 with legion. You can imagine how much of a slog the last one was
---
God I wish I could wear more survivors
---
If you have bbq get freddy if you have legion or discordance get freddy if not ehh bitter murmur is ok but you might struggle if your newer
---
Adam. With a good outfit he‚Äôs super stealthy and his perks help clutch games tremendously. Autodidact gets a lot of shit but empathy makes it practically godtier
---
did anyone else finish all of these and is super fucking pissed by this...
---
I chuckled when I saw it was delayed, never surprised anymore with how often they mess up but I gotta say I'm pretty disappointed. Guess I'll just work on the less grindy and buggy missions for the time being.
---
He's one of the most effective anti-loop Killers in a game that basically requires you to learn how to efficiently loop every tile. Because of this, Clown flies in the face of what you've spent hundreds of hours learning, and even though he's the weakest Killer in the game since he sucks at everything else that makes a good Killer, people still hate him because a decent Clown annihilates even the best loopers.
---
Its so bad that I have to queue like 4 times until I found a lobby, with one being a NAT Type error, one being a can't connect to host error, and one being a timeout error.
---
Then, when I finally found a working lobby the killer dodges because he doesn't like a bald head Dwight or the fact that one survivor has a flashlight
---
Lithe, it‚Äôs way more reliable than BT.
---
Yup. PS4, in my experience, is full of toxic tryhards who all act like they outplayed you for pallet stunning you. I've been reported for downing someone with 3 tokens of devour hope.
---
I will say that recently I've run into more survivors who loop well, can react to mind games, and don't waste time t-bagging or flashlight spamming. I love running into survivors who actually play, even if they out smart me and crush me. When I lose to them, I feel like I actually deserved the loss.
---
I know it counters Spirit but who is the other aluded killer
---
This happened to me two matches in a row as Ghostface. It kicks me from the game, this error message came up, and then I was moved to the title screen where it loads indefinitely.
---
Witch hunt? You can‚Äôt even see their name? Are you alright bud?
---
Oh ok that makes more sense lol. I thought unlocked the character counted as unlocking the DLC. Probably a smarter move for the Devs to offer the deal through cell packs so that money goes directly to them, instead of splitting it with the licensed characters copyright holders. 
---
Scream is one of my favorite series, so I'm just happy to have Ghost Face in the game.
---
IMHO the reason he was bad was because its hard to chase people with his power. He needs to be up at survivors face in order to hit them with his power and that could be troublesome with pallets and windows.
---
Play with your food solves that problem instantly. I usually just go PWYF with any add on that reduces chainswaw charge time and can usually get 3 or 4 kills with him. When i havent got the perk yet, i just use carburetor and chilli so i can chase them after i found them. Its so fun when the survivors dont expect you to be able to chase with the chainsaw.
---
I bet this guy could even afford add ons. Cheeky fuck.
---
If you don't already have Balanced Landing, then go for Lithe. I'm not the most reliable source of Alrtuistic actions, being a gen jockey, but Borrowed Time isn't always reliable.
---
No it tracks it. It simply only lets you get one iridescent emblem per match. So the bug is that if you earn 4 iridescent, you only get 1 for your archive.
---
I do play optimally. When someone is getting chased I go and do a generator. When that someone is downed and hooked, I go to save them. Unfortunately I always get teammates who save immediately. There's nothing much I can do.
---
This is purple - red ranks by the way. I have gotten the most useless, immersed teammates I have ever seen. All they're good at is farming someone off the hook ane partially doing a generator before they hear the killer terror radius and run away.
---
I also don't call myself a good survivor. I know there's a lot to work on but this game relies heavily on team coordination. I usually play SWF with my friend but that's never enough.
---
Yeah, fully upgraded it will silence him whilst hurt
---
I think the issue with that would be stealth killers. You'd get shafted against a t1 Myers, for example. And you can't have it as a certain distance, as that'll still be abusable, just by survivors trying to keep the killer on top of you.
---
two best killers? who?
---
Soooooo, not tracking? Lol.
---
Fortnite. Weekly challenges and the daily medal system combined give you 14 levels per week. The weekly challenges can be done in 1-2 hours and the medals take 1 hour to complete which makes completing the battlepass not grindy and allows you to complete the battlepass weeks ahead of schedule.
---
[removed]
---
Honestly that's very true. Based on my experience with actual competitive games (League of Legends, Counter-Strike, etc.), calling a random person out ***during said game*** leads to that person getting offended or arguing, which tends to lead to that person playing even worse majority of the time. I am sure people have those extreme outlier cases, as all studies do, but most coaches will tell you to focus entirely on your own game play and to completely disable chat as it will not help improve your win chances.
---
I feel like PS4 players have seen all the errors this game has to offer just queuing up for games. Lol
---
I usually do it the other way around, I always try to go for the guy who went for the unsave unhook in my face but often the guy who just got unhooked and has BT on him tries to bodyblock me and take a hit. Than I do the follow cloaked thing, but otherwise I go for the unhooking guy.
---
Well idk about dbd but Hearthstone has some pretty consistent inconsistency with the wording on cards
---
It's weird. He reads normally when it's his own notes. (Like the logs about the entity.)
---
I have a confession - I ***have***  done that before.
---
I only defense was I was still green and didn't understand the perks. The person got pissd and gave me the "Come Here" Gesture - ran to a gen, and then Pointed at it.  
---
I guess they were saying "Leave me alone and get to work!!"

soozie...
---
I know its a bad thing. And a bad habit. But the next game will be better. Not every killer is a piece of shit
---
Very true. You now have 39 days to complete all to the tome challenges to receive their respective rift frags, while their bloodpoint rewards last forever. This means that if you are currently at least tier 31, you only have to progress 1 tier a day to reach tier 70, and with level 3 and 4 challenges to unlock even more fragments this should be no problem!
---
Not quite like that theres a 3 second decay to your terror radius upon cloaking. So you can camp if ya want but you cant ignore borrowed.
---
The logic here doesn‚Äôt make sense unless it‚Äôs a full premade you‚Äôre facing
---
It's funny because theres op perks on both ends and I'm tired of people bithing about them I'm survivor main and I hate it when survivors bitch about op perks and I hate it when killers bitch about op perks so let's just stop the bitching
---
*I see what you did there...*
---
So what you're saying is Susie is legal.
---
It's extremely loud. I'm pretty sure all basement sounds (including breathing) are louder in the basement so the chest is loud as hell
---
Yes?
---
Oh that was a long time ago. Now my skin is as thicc as Jane‚Äôs ass. But thanks
---
Rancid abbatiors idk if that‚Äôs how you saw or any map with cornfields
---
Then you camped
---
If I get chased for a combined total of 4-7 minutes and I don't see a generator completed after I'm downed to my last hook I'll dc immediately.  I just dont want to look at the screen anymore at that point.
---
Its broken ATM! It was only counting 1 per game for me with it so it took ages to finished!
---
Make sure the exits don't get opened while you habe Unnerving Presence in your loadout
---
It's like the "foot in the door" theory where if you get someone to do something small, you can get someone to do something bigger. So I didn't dc because I went down, but I DC when I got downed because of previous build up. Like one day I got backwater (hate this map), haddonfield (hste this as survivor too), the game (yup), and finally lerys all in a row, so I was already pretty done, but this isn't enough of a reason to DC. Then as i was looting a chest a ghostface, 3 seconds after the game starts, comes up behind me and pops his stalk on me before I could react (even though I was looking around while opening the chest). Now normally I'd just be like: "ok wow where was he stalking me from I didn't see him" and move on, but the down was the "foot in the door" which made it easy for me to DC as a result of all the buildup and such.
---
Hit box non existent
---
Let me just reiterate for clarity because I‚Äôm kind of an idiot.  The wiki seems to state on the rift fragment page that once a new tome opens up, say tome 4, any uncompleted challenges in tome 3 won‚Äôt reward you with rift fragments anymore, only bloodpoints.  Is this true or am I reading it wrong?
---
I find legion quite fun, actually. All the information you could ever need
---
If you think the cosmetics and grind here are anywhere on par with those in other battle passes you're either completely delusional, or you've never actually seen or played other battle passes.
---
Lmfao. Because animations always happen right as you hit buttons. Even when it lags. Thanks you just proved to everyone that you don't know anything.
---
When Toxic SWF groups ruin it for the rest of population:/
---
Now we got to deal with blood warden/ NoEd and theres no way to tell the randoms not to open the exit gate yet
---
That the point, but when u broke it at the start of the game, the killer ragequit
---
That‚Äôs the smallest Of the farm maps so it‚Äôs probably my least favorite of those
---
Just saying, don't complain over a loud card if you were dumb enough to get a blower style card for $100 more than a regular double/triple fan one.
---
Who?
---
Im just saying that im tired to play everytime with a killer with the same perk like bbq and ruin,
---
i feel like it is only counting for your pips seems like those who got a pip got 1 and those who got 2 pips got two
---
Gay
---
only dozens
---
As much as I feel bad, I also feel like you don't actually use cypress mori's often, so I see why he wouldn't respect it
---
It's an exploit... but at least it makes Sprint burst viable what side of the fence do I go on.
---
Nice some more fucking garbage literally useless perks that no one with an IQ above room temperature will ever fucking use.
---
BEHAVR will love it.
---
I did this challenge on the first try. I counted only 2 gens I was on at the moment they were done, but I‚Äôm sure I touched at least 5/7 gens on the map.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure as long as 3 gens you‚Äôve worked on get completed, it counts.
---
Omg that's me :D
---
I must have shrek clown

:'DDD
---
Haven‚Äôt pulled that off yet. I‚Äôve got good pallet play but I need to learn more jukes for when the time comes
---
I have Adam I just haven‚Äôt leveled him up yet. What does autodidact do and what does empathy have to do with it.
---
This is like asking for Captain Price in Dead by Daylight, the two genres are totally separate from one another so it doesn't make sense. Dead by Daylight isn't Super Smash Brothers, I hate to break it to you but that's just not how it works.
---
I will do it if I know that the killer‚Äôs next swing will down me because I can‚Äôt create anymore distance. im at red ranks and I‚Äôve had killers stand back because they think I‚Äôve got head on (which I do) and they are weary of getting stunned, but even if the perk doesn‚Äôt activate in time and the killer opens the locker I‚Äôm in, that‚Äôs an extra 5-10 seconds I‚Äôve wasted, which could mean the difference between a totem being broken or a gen popping.
---
dude wtf is with this rudeness? Also, you gotta understand that normal people are not born with the knowledge of every PC component or at least good ones. This is my first PC and it was mostly prebuilt. Yes, I know blower cards are worse than the other types of fans, but I didn't know that until months after the fact and I do have the right to complain because even if its a blower card, it shouldn't have to go super rampid on lower graphics settings including since I can run most AAA titles on Medium with hardly any pushback.
---
I don't prestige my characters anymore, I don't like or use the cosmetics enough to go through the trouble ü§∑
---
This is legit for fun... calm down.
---
Rude.
---
dang there goes my dreams :(
---
I mean, in the original movie he has the old lady mask, so it isn‚Äôt too far fetched
---
I hate playing on ‚ÄòThe Game‚Äô as both killer and survivor. It‚Äôs just the absolute worst.
---
As survivor, keeping track of the killer with the heartbeat dipping in and out when they‚Äôre actually on the floor above/below you is annoying as all hell. That and trying not to accidentally three gen yourself is an bloody nightmare, especially if you solo-queue.
---
Meanwhile for Killer, I struggle with tracking in general on that map. Hearing survivors who you think are nearby but they‚Äôre actually above/below you and the closest set of stairs are halfway across the damn map? Absolutely mind numbing.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on par, I just think every battle pass is inherently grindy.
---
People were competitive as fuck back during MW. Like it isnt even that good, it's a less fun black ops 1
---
I use small game with nancy but still im just tired, i just want a game different. Because everytime is the same perk.

I‚Äôm sorry. A week?! One of the challenges is bugged. Its either broken or a horrible grind
---
Where's that guy? You know. The guy. The guy who links every other post on the same bug?
---
I‚Äôll see your Scoops Ahoy and raise you Babysitter Steve.
---
Or I just one hooked everyone really fast? Happens a lot in low ranks bro.
---
I play on console, I never see it happen
---
The far superior Dead Hard. If not DH then Lithe since it does the same thing with a easier activation and you dont have to worry about walking/crouching everywhere.
---
One of the challenges is bugged. I have to grind out 15 iridescent games until next week?‚òπÔ∏è
---
Yeah I killed chat on LoL and I honestly improved quite a bit. Silver to gold. Small improvment, but just not having chat spam up was huge.
---
This. üôå
---
Like okay, I understand BHVR wants to delay stuff to get some of the bugs out of the way. But everytime they delay something they wait until the last second upon release to tell us is it has been delayed.
---
Nah this is the right game
---
New Clown skin confirmed?! (Not clickbait)
---
Big q
---
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their first try‚Äù isn‚Äôt a good excuse
---
I think it‚Äôs a good excuse, since the only issue people seem to have is that the challenges were too difficult and that seems to be mostly addressed.
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs completely broken and needs to be revamped entirely. So it being their first go and not being perfect I think is fine, it works it can be improved upon let them do it.
---
Unforeseen circunstances
---
Lol
---
These are all simple fixes, this is hotfix territory for any other game. They can't fix this one, if they can't just fix them all easily. Nothing special is going on here, this isn't diving into integrated spaghetti code game programming to fix underlying issues, or reprogramming parts of your game to work on dedicated servers. This is fixing tiny small challenges so that they complete at a smaller number, or so that they can count to 4 instead of 1.
---
As a programmer myself, this is complete dog shit.
---
They are telling you to complete it how it is, and next week when they feel like it, or when they release their next DLC, they'll make it easier for those that aren't even trying to push the archives anyways. Have fun with that.
---
Give him a minute I think he‚Äôs taking a shit
---
u/DecutorR
---
Wedgie time
---
Looks like cheating, you reported him?
---
I know a lot of DbD youtubers brighten the videos so their followers can see things clearly. They play the game at normal darkness though.
---
Didn't report him. Really felt like a glitch and or a dedicated server error.
---
I still bought him today for the blue haired cosmetic lmao
---
There is an enormous different between instant gratification dopamine and grinding 5 plus hours a day for two months straight.
---
Getting two unhooks in EGC isn't something you can do in the side, and you're not playing enough naturally to complete the tomb without having no life or being a streamer who's getting paid to do this.
---
They don't have to give back the cells, but I've rarely if ever played a pass that didn't, as it's free to them and is a trick to get money in their system that you can't take out. It's not to benefit you, it's to entice people who would otherwise not pay.
---
I was under the impression it kept bumping you. I might be wrong. I think its widely believed though lol.
---
you clearly weren‚Äôt listening if you think the challenges are too hard is peoples‚Äô only complaint here. I‚Äôm pretty sure that was as intended anyways, do something outrageously stupid and then roll it back so it looks like you (the dev) actually give a shit.

---
Omg I'm gonna do this with pig
---
Okay just please stop. Use the search function next time before you post something. This is literally the 30 or 40th time somebody has posted this shit in the last 2 days. And yes it's a known bug and they're doing something about it.
---
Bro you didn't have to make another one of these posts either, you could have just looked up to 100s of others.
---
We both felt like making a post though didn't we?
---
It's a trap!
---
Was he nerfed or was he never good?
---
Wow it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve never seen this before definitely not like 6 times an hour for the last like 3 days.
---
Phone.
---
Broo
---
Please tell me you're kidding.
---
If you‚Äôre relatively new to the game then yeah it‚Äôd be a good idea.
---
Stop fucking posting this. This is at least the 3rd one in 20 minutes. I wouldn't ever bother posting this. if it's a bug, nobody here can fix it for you. We're not the devs.
---
Takes TRAPPER to a whole new level.
---
I‚Äôd rather just play David King and have him be your BP farm build since he comes with that perk. If I were you, I‚Äôd rather use the BP on a perk that could be useful with all builds or a meta perk. For my David King, I just use a max WGLF and just found We‚Äôll Make It in the Bloodweb since it wouldn‚Äôt cost Iridescents
---
When I first saw this in  game I tried so hard to pick them up lol

I love playing on The Game as killer (unless I‚Äôm Billy)
---
For survivor I really like Ormond
---
underrated comment
---
They are??? That's jolly good news!
---
I play both sides pretty 50/50. When I'm playing Killer I literally like am analyzing and stereotyping the survivors since the lobby. If it seems like a 4man SWF I'm ruthless. If ingame I notice they're toxic during loops I show no mercy. Full sweaty try hard mode. Punish risky unhooks by slugging if nobody has BT. That kinda shit.
---
Who cares what people think dude, it's a game, play how you want.
---
Bill / because his Left Behind perk is great, too! Same for Unbreakable. 
---
Feng only has the one good perk.
---
it‚Äôs not that serious though. but ok
---
Yeah that was the impression I got from it, that his father did the crime.
---
However, if you read the lore of Trapper, it says they never proved Evan did it. This could be a new, lore-friendly twist to his lore that makes him a more sympathetic villain than just "daddy's boy," because now he took revenge on his father more than just did his dirty work.
---
That said, it doesn't make sense that his own lore is misleading, and there's probably lore on one of his cosmetics somewhere that contradicts all of this, then we probably get "the rift can be mysterious, multiple timelines, blah-de-blah."
---
Does it matter if it‚Äôs toxic? Play how you want. Tbh I tunnel and camp all the time, but I also seem to be the only person who actually has fun playing this game anymore because I‚Äôm not constantly worried about being seen as toxic.
---
My main is - Resilience iron will dead hard and detective‚Äôs hunch
---
My 2nd main is - head on, decisive strike, lithe and iron will
---
Does he generate static by using those slippers?
---

---
If you wanna kill 1 guy and lose yea but who wants that?

‚Äú no. No Claudette YOU ASSHOLE YOU PIECE OF SHIT LET ME FUCKING G- ‚Äú * gets downed *

*laughs in quiet Xbox one x*
---
Kidding, please don't start a console war in the comments
---
In a seriousness are you playing on disc or download? Cuz while I've seen a few comments possibly explaining why this happens (not that I don't trust them just curious), I remember I'd mix up the fan sound and disc spinning sound all the time back on 360
---
Be cool if he had the hair of the survivor as well so it could be easier to differentiate each face, as right now it's impossible to really tell which face he has, even with claudettes darker skin.
---
I think it'd be interesting to for survivors to have dialogues that play automatically once in a while when specific characters are near each other. Think Dota 2, just little bits of banter here and there based on proximity, or even just when working on a gen together.
---
Yeah, I have a feeling you just aren't aware of what was going on.
---
I think he's just joking
---
Hearing him breath through the mask is my daily asmr
---
Head on can be such an awesome perk when the stars align and you can save someone or temporarily stop a chase
---
Try 4 bps and you die within first 2 minutes :c
---
Coming from my survivor main side: yeah, it‚Äôs annoying, but go ahead. I don‚Äôt really care it‚Äôs probably my fault anyway.
---
Coming from my killer main side: ***SEND THOSE FOOLS TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL***
---
For whatever reason the dev's thought not locking the fps on the title screen was a smart decision
---
lol u and ur friends r so ghetto
---
Sounds good, thanks for the advice. I think I‚Äôll be getting ghostface his playstyle seems pretty fucking fun and he‚Äôs always unexpected
---
I do love how this dude was never taught what a period or a comma were and just keeps going in one breath
---
Is this a bug or do you actually not have a life?ü§£
---
They are fixing it. Don‚Äôt worryüòÅ
---
One of my great joys is evading killer while slugged. I wish this was a thing.
---
Even still. Power outages are unexpected.
---
I understand, but do you have any suggestions?
---
I suggest The Shape üî™
---
Finding Nemo, Survivor Edition
---
Mine, mine, mine, my unhook, mine, mine, mine, mine!
---
Dbd reddit is lame jokes and posts hating the lame jokes.
---
You downloaded Dicked by Daylight.
---
Not sure if someone who laughably believes Nurse and Spirit didn't need the changes or someone who is pretending survivors were asking for piggy nerfs
---
What you can do is approximate where he put the traps meaning if he's been on the other side of the map for a while you know there's most likely going to be traps on that side so bring him where you want him. Also if he traps pallets you could drop pallet and make him force to break pallet.
---
I‚Äôd say watch some streamers or YouTubers playing them and see which fits you.
---
this is awesome lol
---
p3 Quentin main here :D
---
Wait till he takes his shirt off üò§
---
Stop this shit. As a killer main I beg you. This perk fucks up my tracking so bad.
---
Just let the farm happen man we got challenges to do.
---
I think maybe updating the current state of the game will also help create new perks. For example the killer being able to close the hatch and force the player to quickly find the hatch or exit gate while time runs out.
---
Shape and ghost face are worth it 100%
---
Ok so basicly: autodidact is essentially a healing perk. While healing, in the event you get a skill check, landing it will cause the heal to regress, but you get a token. For the first two tokens, it regresses, but once you get 3, each skill check will cause it to boost. Once you get 5 tokens, getting a skill check will add a 45% progress bonus to your current heal progress. Works great late game if the killer is slugging, as it allows you to pick up survivors incredible fast. Empathy is just to help you get stacks and heal others
---
The last thing this game needs in more pallets lol.
---
I always suggested an offering that protects you from a mori or at the least require you to be hooked twice.
---
You are going to get around d the same experience with pig and ghostface. Dare I say ghostface is better.
---
The Killer can already do that.
---
It's hooks, not sacrifices. 4 survivors can be hooked 3 times each in a match.
---
I really need a key for this... I can't tell which killers half of there are supposed to be. That said, I'm going to assume the one in the second row on the right is a gender flipped Hag. Or maybe Huntress. Either way that skin is super legit and I'd be ok with it.
---
yup..
---
I know but the killer didnt use to do be able to do that.
---
yes! that's the video.
---
I'm not the most amazing killer in the world; however, I have been playing killer for some time now, so I'll tell you what I can.
---
 As far as perks, most of them are pretty moderate, ones that you can wait for the shrine. I'm new to ghostface, he's very fun.  Hard for me to get down at first, but I'm slowly getting him down.  His best perk (my opinions of course) is thrilling tremors.  Decent alternative to BBQ.  Myers is my second best killer, however he is very linear.  Save the best for last is good in some cases, however there are better options (especially on exposed killers).  I don't have the pig, but Make Your Choice sounds like a viable perk in some cases.  
---
I can recommended Gf and Myers as playable killers though, they both are played uniquely compared to other killers.
---
I think you ACED it.
---
Ehhhhh?
---
Not trying to be a dick or anything but genuinely asking, have you come across iron gasp a lot during your time playing dbd? 
---
And yeah boil over isn‚Äôt a perk that runs in the top ten. I see it as a meme perk tbh. When I get tired of butthole killers, what I like to do is run saboteur &amp; boil over. Remove hooks from a good chunky area. And troll. And not teabagging trolling but waste the killers time. Get downed in said area and see them struggle taking me to a far hook. Just to wiggle out and run back to the safe spot and have them try again lol
---
Haha, careless bubba isn‚Äôt worrying about it.
---
Oh it happens on PlayStation as well. It doesn‚Äôt really affect what you get from that game, but I really don‚Äôt mind. I think it just lets you know that killer left after he killed everyone.
---
I was a dick and I felt bad after, just wanted some more points :( This game breeds toxic events lol
---
BasementFace claims another victim.
---
And THEN he stopped replying.  L M A O
---
The spirit made a choice, I never shut hatch if I can help it because of adrenaline.
---
The Disconnection will happen even if I die first at the beginning of the match (shamefully)
---
like, the killer is doing well and it just auto-disconnects me from Host and shows the killer's build and 0 BP for them
---
I often forget that double crouch means different things to other survivors and I accidentally tbag killers when I'm trying to thank them, as a reflex. It's the worst when a killer brings me to the exit and let's me wiggle free and I do the double crouch thank you and realize I just spat in the killers face. I always apologize but I wish that survivors thank you wasn't the same gesture as BMing the killer.
---
They should just change the Legion's name to Legionary, give him a throwing spear and some voicelines whenever he hits survivors.
---
"Ave, true to Caesar"
---
"vale"
---
"Retribution!"
---
"some of the slaves have been spreading stories about the burned man again"
---
"THE CAESAR HAS MARKED YOU FOR DEATH, AND THE LEGION OBEYS. READY YOURSELF FOR BATTLE."
---
Trying to figure out what you could do with it. There‚Äôs nothing really appealing about this perk. It only works on the basement hooks so it‚Äôs use is already limited. Even if you applied the effect to all hooks all it does is make survivors die faster on a single hook which actively hurts your rating now.
---
*unhooks self, grabs hook, and walks behind meg ready to kill her*
---
^surprise
---
weren't they like horrible and a lag switcher one the last comp?
---
Survivors even with iron will still make noise when affected by the plague as they cough and vomit so they can‚Äôt be silent. But other than that yes iron will is an amazing perk and resilience grants a 9% vault speed which many overlook
---
it does, the grunts of pain reduction stacks, the killer cant hear u even if he runs stridor
---
Wouldn't be the first time.
---
whatd they do
---
Iron Grasp's impact is pretty minimal in most games. It only really serves to give you *slightly* more tactical decisions in which hook to use. It's only really impactful in a full basement build, in which case Agitation does far more anyway.
---
One, a no-effort perk that wiggles faster would be much stronger than one that makes it slower. The killer cannot see your wiggling is faster, and many mechanics like saboutage and other perks like Flip Flop and Boil Over all stack up and can make severe dead-zones in maps already. Dead zones should never be an easy, common occurrence, they flat out ruin the game. It'd be like a killer being able to just disable repairing all gens on the map for 4 mins, because as a survivor you can almost always realistically reach a dead zone you've set up for yourself.
---
Secondly, now that Yui's perk exists, it's obviously off the table, can't have both a perk that speeds up wiggling AND one that does it because someone else is near, it'd be ridiculous. If they didn't stack, nobody would bring Yui's, they'd just bring BO.
---
Understandable. Still funny just unfortunate lol
---
Agreed.  My new loadout is No Mither, Dead Hard, Iron Will and Resilience.
---
bubba has 0 time for megs, this dudes just tryna get them destruction points

JaysTwoCents is a good yt channel on building pcs. Its a fun process once you get into it! What‚Äôs your budget range?

At the end of the day he‚Äôs just a weaker Trapper, so playing him isn‚Äôt too bad.
---
I‚Äôve had this issue with my PS4 countless times, but the old Xbox does just fine, even on games like Battlefield.
---
Instructions unclear. Pressed ready and got into a match within 3 seconds
---
This post is a excuse to show off the rest of your complered challenges, i'm sad now
---
So disappointing...
---
You gotta use insidious and camo gens. By time the Survivors start working, you can 1HKO them lol.
---
Honestly, this all sounds great. I would like an idea of what buffs Bria would grant teammates though.
---
Trying to use iron will. It makes a bigger difference than I thought.
---
I didn't downvote you, but it looks like you cared enough to downvote me hahahahhaha.
---
PEBBLE, Leader, Prove Thyself, kindred
---
They'll also be viable again once Oni is out. One of his perks is perfect for Legion.
---
The Claudette in the background is the killer

Hm, it doesn‚Äôt show me his perks but it does show disconnection from host.

Again, you haven‚Äôt seen their code. You don‚Äôt need to be a programmer to understand that you actually don‚Äôt know shit until you‚Äôve seen their code.

How hard is it to get this shit right??
---
That comment that makes no sense xD
---
alright thanks!

I'm guessing you died. So youre salty
---
that is exactly point
---
Is that what the ladies do in the restroom ??
---
Well if you want specifics you have to click on the link to see her perks. But in short, one perk makes it so when she heals an ally they will get a buff to altruistic actions, cleansing a totem gives her an aura that makes the closest ally to her get a buff to all actions for the next few seconds. And cleansing a totem gives her a buff to her next action.
---
They are no longer a small company and that excuse is no longer valid. They've made MORE than enough money to improve on many aspects. People like you are the reason they get away with as much as they do. I love the game, but enough is enough with these devs.
---
Even make is looking over from his portrait like...

Why not just kill yourself on hook at least and get some points out of the game? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to just dc cause you wasted your time with that game
---
Just get rid of groups in public games and make it so you can only invite people into customs, problem solved
---
Lol okay m8 you all say while all of the best Survivor Perks effectively get removed from the game. While Killers get reworks, good perks, and buffs with every patch. Survivors got lucky that we requested for Nurse nerfs before this happened.
---
Good old dbd reddit lol
---
Susie Mains Unite!!!!
---
That ones pretty good, I'm mostly referring to "Hex:" and then a word that makes literally no sense after it. Lotta people are raging over this comment like I'm campaigning to get the names removed when it was only a shutout lol
---
I'll check what I had
---
Oh yeah Moris and Keys break the game in similar yet different ways and make the game less enjoyable for the receiving ends.  Some Killer powers meanwhile practically rely on addons to keep them viable/usable (Leatherface and Doctor come to mind), others become straight-up broken or overpowered with certain addons (prayer beads Spirit being the most popular gripe).
---
You happy now?
---
The colour work is incredible. Thank you for sharing!
---
I would recommend Hag or Wraith for your first time playing killer. They are easy to use. Once you feel more confident playing killer move on to more advanced killers
---
Does it matter? The power doesn‚Äôt down anyone. To tunnel someone while I‚Äôm frenzy wouldn‚Äôt make sense and would be counterproductive
---
Are you the 2? If so I'd imagine there's a rank 1-4 in your game and they're with her/him
---
I was doing the Tome 2 archive challenges for Survivor, and i encountered so, SO many people who killed themselves on the first hook.
---
It wasn¬¥t even anything understandable like Prayer Beads Spirit or Iri Huntress, i had a Kate kill herself whilst i was ca. 20 m away and already running. I know some game are stressing/frustrating and you just want out, but this isn¬¥t LoL where you are stuck playing a shitty match for 25 minutes.
---
Boil over is literally useless. Maybe if they buffed the effect it already had, it might do something, but as it is now, i see no difference when i pick up a survivor with boil over vs a normal survivor. The wiggle force is not enough to slow me down at all, and not seeing hook auras is stupid, they are too tall, i can see them regardless, or know the spawns or am right next to one. As a killer, i see it as a pointless perk. Increasing wiggle speed is way too good, but there isn't much they can add to effect carried survivors. Maybe add a way to get stacks that helps speed up wiggle speed, but it can't be by much, just like a max of 4 stacks at 3% per stack. Get stacks similar to WGLF maybe. I don't know, disregard the idea, but right now, boil over is literally useless and a wasted slot.
---
Pls stop these posts
---
Bodyblocking is fine. Even if the survivor wiggles off, you still have a lot of people injured
---
Do you still keep the stuff you earned that game?
---
just dont be bad or just drop them its not that hard
---
I mean you're the one bitching about an easy solution to a easy problem
---
Lets you feel in control for a few seconds.
---
Times when my internet is bad, I'll try to play stealth mode as much as possible to avoid "interaction" with the killer. Interacting with the killer is what messes mine the most, so I try to be a sneaky bean! Of course, that isn't always possible and you have to keep an eye out for teammates needing unhooking. Otherwise, there isn't much I can do when my internet is lagging.

Grabbing someone out of the hatch
---
What outfit is that nurse wearing?
---
nah people just wanna play with there friends. Solo play is cancer so i dont blame people.
---
I appreciate the advice. Unfortunately, my family lives rurally, so when I visit them I‚Äôm left with internet that just doesn‚Äôt quite cut it for online games. :(
---
It's simple really from your perspective. You make a call, can I make the number of swings required or do I need to drop this survivor and start slugging. Don't swing unless you are almost touching them, run iron grasp agitation save the best for last and mad grit.
---
What part of "killer" is everyone failing to understand?  I've seen a prevalence of whine posts from survivors, and an equal number from so called killers, about "being nice" or giving hatch.  You're not entitled to hatch, you don't "deserve" to escape, suck it up and wait your 10 second queue for the next game.
---
is this one the Claudette that is so good at finding pallets, they manage to use one every 10 seconds without stunning you a single time?
---
$10 for a skin is a really fair price compared to other games (like fortnite where it‚Äôs like $25 for a skin) count your blessings

Well I guess we have to agree to disagree then, eh?

Yep

No add-ons? Downvote /s

It doesnt, I'm not campaigning to get it removed it's a shitpost lol

It's a joke remember I have a lot of friends that are jake mains I just say this stuff as jokes
---
You asked a question in the title. Either way, it's Reddit, which is a social forum. Discussion is going to happen over whatever you post.
---
how about you gift me mad grit, oh wait you can't. meaning I have to put up with the griefing rendering the perk useless. Also why would I bother with a perk like that when it's probably not even good. I'm not bitching you're just upset your boomer tier advice isn't being heralded as gospel. So unless you wanna do the work for me to get mad grit your solution is basically to just take it under the chin until I get the perk to stop something that doesn't happen often and get a probably crap perk for it.
---
I have to be level 35 if im reading this wiki right meaning I have to put in 3x the hours I have in currently for a chance to unlock it. Horrible advice your input was a net negative to my post.
---
&gt;insults me

&gt;tells me to calm down
---
I bet you tipped your fedora after calling me a twit.
---
The metas tend to be the same across platforms just some killers, primarily nurse, are much harder on PS4 due to framerate and controls
---
lot of things, like them wiggling me out of range or lag.
---
I get that but it says "trappers be like" which would imply that the meme that follows would be trapper related perhaps the trapper doing something or saying something but instead it takes a turn and shows a meme about the entity
---
can neither confirm nor deny but I wager with how you like bodyblocking you're a survivor main.
---
Bro you don't even need mad grit you idiot. Literally fucking hit them the moment you get to a hook. If you're traveling that far just to a hook to the point one hit breaks free you're doing something wrong
---
my  regular ps4 be tripping on the title screen for no reason

it's rhetorical.....

Personally, Legion is my favorite character in all of DbD. I love their back story, and am always wondering if they have some sort of shared conciousness or the like

It‚Äôs possible she thought his DS was active (the fact he has DS suggests she may not know DS only activates once, and so she may have been trying to close hatch after because she doesn‚Äôt wanna risk him using DS again... also, rarely do any killers I run into take note of how long someone has been off hook, so she might not have known how long he was unhooked too). That‚Äôs what I would think since I can‚Äôt manage chasing someone while also counting the time they‚Äôve been off hook.
---
Now, if I know I can‚Äôt reach a hook in time (this usually happens late into  my carrying them to a hook, meaning if they were picked up again they would wriggle out) and I don‚Äôt know where the hatch is and the survivor is downed, I basically use them as a hound to sniff it out for me so I can close it. Then I pick them up and accept a chase that I know I‚Äôll win because the hatch is closed, they are wounded, and a chase has begun.
---
Does being a trapper main matter at all in this explanation or no? Felt I should mention I‚Äôm a trapper main to give context to how I think.
---
I might have to change my name. Bubba is nothing compared to Ace.
---
This is getting ridiculous.
---
if they're uninjured I have to hit them and recoil from the animation hit them again to down them, and this is assuming I'm not ontop of the hook with a freshly picked up survivor. If I have to travel the 2 strikes on just 1 would be enough for them to wiggle out. It's frustrating to have to deal with something that doesn't even make sense like this.
---
Yeah crowd around the man with a knife.
---
Not sure that it does too much right now. I also wonder what happens if you give someone a thumbs up?
---
Same when i get asked why i put so much effort into nurse when i can take a 3 day break and lose a lil bit of edge.

Nurse was made to have a high skill gap, in the hands of weaker players, she was terrible. Going up against a sensible rank 1 killer she was next to impossible to deal with.
---
Cosmetics are just for show, if anything they‚Äôre more of a detriment. The best stealth cosmetics have always been P3 with the exception of Adam‚Äôs old grey coat (which was brightened).

‚ÄúA delayed game can be good. A rushed game will be forever bad.‚Äù Not precisely the right situation, but this is the concept. Coding is not a simple process.

Yea no my anxiety ain‚Äôt gonna do well with that. So I take it that it‚Äôs not a community thing?

Yeah, the challenges of coding a game.

---
Ew emoji on reddit please leave
---
It's a hotfix that changes the requirements for some challenges. Do you realize how hard it is to fuck that up? It is literally going into the code, finding where it says "Hook 15 Survivors" and changing it to "Hook 10 Survivors."
---
;-;
---
My boyfriend's a coder, I know how difficult it can be. But they're three years in, with lots of money from cosmetics and chapters to show for it. Remember when they postponed the archive a week and then released it and it was still total butt? Yeah? Me too.
---
Ya honestly I did not think some of them that are being changed are not that bad just long. Only thing that‚Äôs going to be hard for me is the end game NOED kill
---
Wasnt talking to u but the other guy. Should of added a /s mb
---
Hes not as popular a survivor as others, so the return on giving him cosmetics is less than say... meg or dwight
---
Thanks yall
---
Entirely is a big overstatement. Will low mobility killers struggle on things like disturbed ward? Yes. Is that game worth abandoning? No. Getting a 3k/4k even with bad rng for spawns is possible.

That's nothing, two years ago I made a Bubba DC because he couldn't figure out why the gen in the killer shack stopped regressing every time he left for two seconds to come right back. Apparently he couldn't distinguish the boxes next to the pallet from a wild David King.

Yep I see now. Thank you so much

This is a disturbingly good photoshop

That was sarcasm...

Urbaning from gen to gen, accidentally scaring other survivors when I get close

Might be a glitch

No you downloaded the right game

Today I had a dude do like 2 tiny tbags at the gate right before the escape and it was enough time for me to down and hook him. His injured friend came to grab him while I was right there so what should have been a 1k became a 3k. Ofc the last friend kept T-bagging out of reach but I wasn't abt to leave the hook and downed guy..

multiple bps promotes cuckiness from killers
---
Sooooo many dc at green rn on ps4...wtf
---
I've done all of tome 1 &amp; 2, and like half of 3. I'm at tier 63. I haven't had many issues with the time put in. The current tome's survivor challenges are extremely grindy, but he killer ones are pretty fair. Did all of the killer challenges for tome 3 in one day (about 4 hours roughly). Not terrible, but just needs a little rework.
---
It‚Äôs probably clean. I just cleaned all the dust inside of mines and the noise got reduced.
---
Don't let ass holes scare you over the internet. Even if they fetch your address, they don't have the means or the time or a good enough reason to show at your door. Plus most of us gamers are harmless nerds.
---
It is clean, I keep it clean but I didn't know people hardly clean them to the point where the PS4 is working hard just to USE the fan
---
I love Detox.

I just used the build No one left behind Prove thyself Balanced landing Borrowed time and just open the exit gate as soon as possible igz its hard but i got it done

Acknowledging one's shittiness but doing nothing to change said shittiness doesn't make someone wholesome.
---
If we want to bring medals into it, do you really think all 4 survivors are double pipping in every single red rank match?
---
That's not true at all, there are many perks you can use against her.  
---
I personally love Lithe and Dance With Me combo, it's especially good on corn maps.
---
Perk categories in general may be a better idea, but everyone's still pretty salty when you have to consider that Survivors get 4 perks each and SWFs are allowed to stack.
---
Could someone help me on custom games? I'm trying to test some loadouts with different killers so I know what perks to save up for on the blood web.
---
I'd rather see bad perks merged until everything is at least somewhat viable, and it's easier to find what you want in the Bloodweb.
---
Thanks for the insight! It's been a while since I seriously played the game so I'm way out of the loop
---
Maybe you could have Nancy focus around generators. Since she‚Äôs a journalist she could take notes on where things are if that makes sense.
---
Steve is normally upfront and center for the team (or leader/guardian). Maybe use him to where he deals with the killer as well as keeping the team safe in a way.
---
I hope this may help you in a way.üòÄ
---
It's almost like people who do that don't care about anyone but themselves.
---
Kinda funny that Ace who has 3 garbage perks is asking for a perk rework lol
---
Perfect lol
---
Iron Maiden: My time has come.
---
Xbox player too. Mind helping me test some killers and perks in custom game?
---
It‚Äôs people like this that stop the world from ending
---
Yep trying to please everyone is impossible and some people turn blind eyes to certain facts, but yet we play on.
---
If they just removed the "complete in one trial" restriction it'd be fine. I can do everything they ask over time, but going back to zero like I crossed Golden Experience Requiem isn't fun.
---
Dbd is a GPU demanding game as opposed to CPU.
---
Feel free to message me if anything like this ever arises or if you just wanna talk. :)

Sounds good.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why people hate Legion so much. In my opinion, the Legion is fairly an easy killer to go up against.
---
Same and I‚Äôm a legion and pig main and I vaunt find a match as both cause people disconnect in the loading screen if it says who I am
---
Are you trolling? The loading screen doesn't show who you are.
---
They ARE on sale again though
---
This is definitely a troll post.
---
They said Plague was OP before release
---
They were wrong
---
Very wrong
---
Sure
---
You found a beam of light. Congrats my dude
---
I am close to your tier but I think you should finish if you do the challenges, and it‚Äôs only 70 tiers.
---
It can it‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúgoing against [killer name]‚Äù and you can see it as the killer and it‚Äôll give you a tip as survivor and killer
---
How about you play Wraith in red ranks and see for yourself :)
---
Yeah because fixing 5 gens on your own with the spirit after killing your team and camping on them is totally fair... What even.
---
It‚Äôs not
---
Well that's not a good mindset to have in general

Nathan explosion would be proud. BRUTAL

So not in a chase. If the killer isn't chasing you for 20 seconds then it turns off standing or if you are downed then more than 24 meters away.
---
Just play Nurse or Spirit with 3 meta perks and Unnerving Presence and just destroy everyone

Exactly. I think the important thing people miss is that games are supposed to be fun. Don't let toxic comments and actions of people to get under your skin--they don't deserve your attention. Just laugh it off, and move on. They're the ones who look like idiots if you play nice and say nice things in chat while they rant on like lunatics. 2/3 of my game hours are in Killer and I've maybe only had a handful of really toxic people. Generally people are nice, and even if they play "toxic" they're chill in chat. Perhaps it isn't really the case outside of red/purple ranks tho, but that I don't know.
---
That being said it's also a communal game (players dictate the match) which means it's really imperative for respectful plays from both sides to make it fun for everyone involved. The community in general imo is really chill and in the game for fun. Most of the "toxic behaviors" tend to be people just memeing or looking for laughs in good faith--unless those behaviors significantly impact your capacity to have fun (i.e. 3x pre-nerf red insta SWF, or facecamp bubba etc).

Aww. Can't come up with anything? Okay, dumbass.

He looks like Salad Fingers
---
I play Legion for 3 reasons.
---
1. I like to earn my wins unlike other killers.
---
2. The being a group of edgy teens turned killers is a change from other killer backstories.
---
3. Susie=Best Girl
---
Pwyf nurse with matchbox made her pretty fast
---
I finished it after three games because I messaged the killer to help me out if I helped him out. PS4 btw
---
People are not salty because they are too strong, people are salty because they are too weak. Both of them are outclassed in their own category, pig outclassed by ghost face and Myers in the stealth category, and legion outclassed by the spirit in the ‚Äòbase kit altering‚Äô category. If you want to win, playing on pc at red ranks, you don‚Äôt pick pig and legion. I love people that play these characters, because they lead to more fun matches, though.
---
That'd *probably* work. I'm over fond of saying "we'd have to see it in action", and I stand by it here as well, but this sounds like it should work.
---
Sure ain't.

You shouldn't get dumpstered, either.

still funny how many ppl dont kboe what that is

Sorry I don‚Äôt post on reddit much

That match had all the salt they needed in stranger things season 3.
---
Nice
---
Luckily I got passed that awful rescue 2 in end game one
---
*proceeds to make your first post*
---
You sure?
---
I‚Äôve always thought it was a coin with a moon design on it
---
does what?
---
I‚Äôm proud of you!!
---
Yes.. That's either a matchmaking issue or they Queued together. That still doesn't change what we're talking about in terms of rank.
---
Most survivors at Low Rank will demolish a Legion just because the Legion can't put enough pressure. Yes, they have extra mobility but the fact that survivors can just Mend and ignore healing to full health since Low Rank Survivors will be able to loop effectively. This means the pressure gained from the mobility is lost.
---
Survivors at High Ranks won't be able to loop as well, so they can't spend the game in the wounded state. So they have to spend time healing to full, and since the pressure from Legion's mobility isn't lost, Legion becomes much better.
---
So when people are saying Legion sucks, they're talking about lower ranks where he's too easily countered and fails to pressure compared to other killers. Hillybilly has better mobility and a one-hit down, Freddy has better mobility and better chases, etc...
---
Thanks man!!!!
---
Oh god yes. If you‚Äôre new, RUN THIS PERK. it helps save you so many hours of grinding.
---
I don't know why this made me laugh so hard lol
---
It's a vicious cycle
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you have enough time if you play on average
---
I found myself less interested in Dead by Daylight lately.  It was bothering me why I was losing interest because, generally speaking, I enjoy the game.  So, last night, I login and I've got a Legion daily of getting 4 Deep Wound hits.  I'm still behind on Archives, so I swap my archive goal to 200,000 blood points.  My plan is simple.  I'll go in with Legion with Barbecue and Chili.  I'll deep wounds and down every survivor once, getting my hook stacks up, and then I'll just run around and deep wounds and farm hits and chase points.  Go for a higher BP game and not worry about the pip.  (Legion is my meme killer)
---
I get into the match, down a survivor very fast, go to pick him up and he DCs.  I go after survivor number 2 after doing a round of Deep Wounding everyone and down the second survivor.  As I'm carrying him to the hook, he DCs.  I do manager to get the other 2 hooks in and get some blood points, but not as much as I would have liked.  As I get out of the match, I am frustrated because this is not the first time DCs has made my Archives challenge difficult.  My total sacrifices kept taking longer because of players DCing.  
---
I switch to survivor and switch to 2 Pallet Stuns in the same match.  First match starts off really well.  Briefly hear a terror radius and nothing else.  I do a gen.  I do a totem.  I notice no one has been hit.  I check the map and no killer to be found... basement de-ranker.  I go to a locker above the basement and make it clear my presence is very well known.  I know it is going to be a leatherface down there with insidious, but I'm hoping for a pig.  I want to chase them out, get two pallet hits and then let them kill me or go back to hiding.  Nope, it is a leatherface who downs me and I just rush back to death.  Maybe the next match will be better... I get a nurse killer.
---
It is at this point I realize why I'm getting so frustrated and less interested in Dead by Daylight right now.  I love the archives.  I just don't like the time limit.  I'm a casual player and I feel pressured to play more than I want to commit to when I'm busy with real life stuff.  The disconnects are negatively impacting my ability to complete Archive rituals.  And I'm still on Level 2 challenges and I know what is coming with both Level 3 and Level 4 to come.  
---
I'm glad that these changes are coming to Level 3 for when I get there, but as a whole, I think the biggest issue I have is the time limit.  Instead of just setting my current archive to something I will get sooner or later anyway (2 pallet hits) and letting it come naturally, I feel compelled to play with disregard for my team because I can only get in some many games a day and there is a limit on how long I can spend completing these challenges.
---
For the record I don't give a damn about reaching level 70 in the rift.  The cosmetics mean nothing to me, personally.
---
I do agree with most of what your saying but it depends on how the person plays legion cause most are different
---
Yes, but you are not going to be a silent gen rusher against a plague.
---
This happened while playing against Ghostface today. 2 people downed. 2 people DCed. Fortunately the killer was cool. The killer, myself, and the other survivor goofed around for like 15 minutes. Got ourselves some extra points. Had some fun, then escaped.
---
D e e p e s t L o r e
---
Tome Level 4 Challenge: Get a girlfriend
---
in doing the challenge i discovered i only have monstrous shrine unlocked on one killer because *what's the point*
---
That‚Äôs probably why they can destroy bad survivors because pig wastes a lot of time and legion can stay on survivors well throughout the match but past rank 6 they just aren‚Äôt viable pig has nothing in a chase and can be looped for the entire game (most games in purple and red ranks are under 5 minutes) and even if you manage to hook one the timer is long enough that it won‚Äôt matter because they will have the rest of the gems done by the time it would start ticking down, legion is currently the worst killer for better ranks mostly because his ability is completely useless he can chase people down but he has to end the ability and suffer a fatigue to go hit them again it‚Äôs really only good for the first hit and even then stealth killers can do it better
---
I would agree with you, but... its takes 2 perk slots to carry someone that far. So unless your doing a basement build no one would do this just bc. They are b teir perks at most, to make it fair boil over should just slow you down ( 7% ) and bump you around
---
But i need my Spinechill, ds, balanced landing and bond to stand a chance in colo queues
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me a couple of times while I was playing nurse and while I was playing Michael. However when I played Michael, there were hackers and I‚Äôm pretty sure they had hacks that made it so they wouldn‚Äôt get downed if they were hit. I would likely assume the game is glitched or they‚Äôre hacking but that‚Äôs just me
---
I hate to call you out, but you probably found the Hawkins Lab one by watching Paulie Esther, if we‚Äôre being honest.
---
Sorry that happened :/ Some people can be so damn toxic. Good on you for handling it well.
---
Same
---
I think that Dead By Kink
---
It‚Äôs a small bonus and it would give you bloodlust tier two after only 15 seconds of a chase instead of the normal 30 or so seconds
---
no that's the game you want

 I run shadowborn on my nurse. It TREMENDOUSLY helps me with blinks and locking on to a survivor. Just don‚Äôt swing every time you blink unless you know for sure you‚Äôll get the hit, because doing so increases fatigue time. I can‚Äôt really provide tips when blinking since you will have to play nurse more often in order to understand how much you need to charge your blink. Set your sensitivity to 90-100% and for addons, I find all addons good but don‚Äôt use the increase bloodpoint add-ons if you are still learning. Best addons would be both recharge speed addons or green recharge speed and a distance addon. You probably already know this but looking down decreases the distance you blink and looking up increases the distance you blink. That‚Äôs all the mechanical tips I have for you, good luck to you in becoming an alpha nurse!

Damn. Thanks I guess..
---
I enjoyed 10 seconds ago
---
Oh yeah, most of them were taking too long to find so we did have to search on youtube. But we had fun anyway :)
---
Regardless of what you want to say, hes one of the best survivors in the community. Toxicity is what keeps him relevant. Look at this, whole arguements on reddit about it. Yall keep his name circling around which is exactly what he wants. Hes funny and entertaining, isnt that what you want from a content creator?

Put Thanatophobia on plague immediately.   You'll either get a 16% total slowdown on performing actions or you'll get survivors that cleanse.
---
Is it just me or are survivors dropping pallets even though you‚Äôre like 5 feet behind them?
---
GIMME MY 1000 BLOODPOINTS

I play Legion for the dailies... and for the cosmetics. They got nice cosmetics.

I loled at this

what is it

Gotcha, wasn't made clear in your original post.

Wait, Dota 2 has a battlepass? God dam, I had no idea

Personally I don‚Äôt like strider cuz I always think the survivors are right next to me lmao

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e3rg3i/how_to_skip_archives_challenges_wait_this_isnt/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I have found a few of them i thought it was soppoused to mean RIP genrush?
---
a map addon, a beacon, only visible for survivors
---
In my experience with dbd on ps4, a lot of survivors are super altruistic, either bum rushing the hook or urban evading 10 meters away. This gets worse with SWF.
---
So if I see 0/1 aura(s) on BBQ, there's a solid chance someone's ready to unhook. Now I don't hard camp, but I definitely check near the hook before leaving (in said scenario), and more often than not find someone.
---
I know that people can obviously just be running distortion or hiding in a locker, but in my experience being within 40 meters is more likely
---
I thought it was two penises about to touch and find love.
---
Ikr
---
If Behavior is to be believed: Freddy.
---
I'm not sure who OP is referring to in this case outside of Spirit.
---
I think it's incrediably unfair that there are 4 survivors to 1 killer. It should be even with 1 survivor to 1 killer or 4 killers to 4 survivors.
---
Aight. Just don't complain about NOED ever again
---
what does it do?
---
They're not the worst (Hello Clown), but they do need a rework. Something to make their power more easily managed/buffed/nerfed/tweaked. Right now, any change, even a small one, seems so drastic because of how unfun and uninteractive the power is. Adjust that aspect and things can be tweaked towards more balanced.
---
ew you main a false god
---
Clown does suck but his perks are pretty good and they need a lot of rework on leigion
---
Forgot to switch accounts or?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt watch noob, is he actually toxic during videos? Cause if he‚Äôs being toxic just to be toxic what separates him from ochido?
---
LolüòÇ
---
Jake, where 10% gen progress?
---
as a stealth main I don't have time to just chase them. it is hard especially if the rest heal and take turns taking damage to get me to drop them.
---
Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious.
---
Getting a farm map can be an instant loss for certain killers sometimes. Like Rotten Fields and Thompson House. You can play perfectly and still lose with killer on these maps.
---
You can dh over traps as a last resort, otherwise disarm traps or just be careful around killer shack or safe pallets and grass. Lately I've been running resilience and it's really good against m1 killers.
---
I think that whoever did the whispers for the entity was told to improvise and whisper in an eerie way and ‚Äúget me out‚Äù instinctively came to mind for them
---
BUT if this isn‚Äôt the case... what could this mean for the lore (of the entity)?
---
U/you_cant_eat_cats
---
Haha yeah check my profile it's on there a couple months back.
---
Elaborate.. where do you hear these sounds? On every map or specific maps? Any specific killers?
---
I like the first one. Adds some danger to being the obsession
---
And with Doctor, super impressive my dude! Keep it up!
---
If it randomly happens on a corner, the survivor has no idea if you switched directions or not
---
Having both those addons makes you get it very often.
---
While running both those add-ons, you can ignore what Spirit is all about, chase them normally and even tho you‚Äôre 110 speed, if you mindgame 50% of the time you‚Äôre straight up unloopable. 
---
Is it good? No. But it‚Äôs like playing a scratched mirror on myers. A new playstyle to have some fun with.
---
You can still use your power tho, to cut off long loops, move around or use it ‚Äúnormally‚Äù when facing survivors that can‚Äôt get tricked easily.
---
It‚Äôs probably when you walk by fires and stuff
---
I beg to differ, while Thompson can suck, it's far from the most survivor biased map, and is absolutely not a guaranteed loss or anything. You can 4k against good survivors on places like Thompson or Rotten.
---
Next week
---
Can any bad things happen to the ps4? Because I wanna try it
---
I want more ‚Äúdo bad stuff to obsession‚Äù perks.
---
Currently the obsession is the safest person in the game and I don‚Äôt like that theme-wise
---
When was this announced!?
---
2 escapes is fairly rare, and there's no data on or real relevance of other people pipping, though. 
---
You'll see a lot of 0/1k (to abandonment) games with lower-tier Killers though, and the BM often makes them stand out much more in people's minds. That's getting dumpstered.
---
Person with a map puts it down. And other survivors can see it. If you‚Äôre not on comms it‚Äôs a good way to communicate things like hex totems and trapper traps quickly, but that‚Äôs it
---
That‚Äôs what I was talking about!
---
Devs suggested that they‚Äôd remove all of those ‚Äúoverused jokes‚Äù but I commented saying that ‚Äúat least review them, some have a good twist which makes them worth keeping‚Äù and I got downvoted to hell
---
Run a good detection perk or two. BBQ lets you spot players on hook, and Whispers tells you when someone's near. Crows can also give non-crouching players away, even without Spies.
---
After use 1 000 000 of bloodpoint on my feng ming. Impossible. And today, i got 256 443

‚Äúdo I need to show you this one match from one streamer in order to disprove actual statistics from BHVR?‚Äù 
---
seriously what are you thinking dude.
---
Bahaha ya me too man
---
There is a risk for the reward. If he has iron grasp, that‚Äôs one perk dedicated to not slowing down gens, to not finding survivors, and to not getting downs easier. I would say it‚Äôs a fair trade
---
Why all the downvotes for this comment?
---
I'll explain the joke:
---
You see, a "trap" is when a male resembles a female - often the term trap is when photos are shared to straight men without sharing the knowledge that it's actually male. Hence, "it's a trap!"
---
Now, what this user did was create a play on words. The character in OP's photo is a character named The Trapper in a videogame called Dead By Daylight. This user has taken the term "trap" and used the sexual context on OP's photo of The Trapper in a sexual manor, knowing The Trapper is male -- while the back and bottock region that has been photoshopped in is actually from a female. 
---
It's funny because "The Trapper" and "Trap" contain the same word, but originally had different meanings. So this user has merged the two meanings and created a quick joke about it.
---
i like cheese
---
Frank got neon set 3 months ago
---
Basically her jittery animation plays more often, makes it easier to mindgame. Not worth using unless you dont have any other addons you want to use.
---
tomb 2-3 is difficult the guy has a point stop being a bitch about it and respect other people's opinion.
---
still the same, you shouldn't even be pipping every  match either. When the sign of a safety pip is a "draw" or that you were evenly matched with the opposition.
---
They announced changes to the challenge coming next week. That one specifically is only going to require 1 rescue.
---
Lol We‚Äôre All In This Together is just poised but for everyone
---
they said it meant to be hard after the leaks came out. but since they are nerfing it I highly doubt that are they about. but you know since they are good with releasing patches we don't want broken stuff... yet we don't want delays too :////
---
I always saw a tiger Jesus
---
If there were data of people pipping it would be so contradictory to who is good or not. A survivor hook bombing with BT would be pipping a lot more than a survivor actively trying to escape, inversely a Legion would be pipping more than most killers, and any insta down killer would have skewed data as well.
---
Yes there are some killers that completely lose matches, just as often I see matches where the survivors are dead within the first 2 minutes, it happens. Doesn't mean the game is unbalanced.
---
He taste the light
---
If you really, really play against her a lot and you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice a perk, urban evasion lets you crouch around dangerous areas without tripping any traps.
---
Rank 8 can ragequit if they lost the hex totem in 30sec. When he can't catch the survivor in a pallet looping after 4 gens done ( with ruin activated), when they get 360 so much time, when everytime he grap a survivor and there is a pallet save or flashlight save. When he can't win a chase and lost everytime the survivor and that all i think. But im on xbox.
---
Add me @ jssteer
---
The design I went with was to have it the basement be more of a oh shit hook rather that just a meh maybe a little harder 
---
It also would make the game have more to do and add some slowdown to it but would also make it harder for a killer to do things too thus more slowdown
---
Honestly without changing the idea of the perk or be hard to make it fit into any build this way it offers something that can be used more and could be the focal point of some builds
---
It is very much possible unless you get Lerys or Ormond but I have been loving Nurse on console for some reason. It takes so much time to learn but when you do, you are a powerhouse. I have been running without ruin and getting 3-4ks at red ranks because of how comfortable i‚Äôve gotten with her.
---
I really don‚Äôt get those going for stealth cosmetics. Do you enjoy the game or sitting in corners?
---
Shit like this makes me so mad I hope you reported and they all got banned
---
He‚Äôs not actually toxic. He never teabags. Killers confuse being shit and getting looped (when they can leave chase whenever they want lol) with toxicity.
---
Joey got his Neon outfit a bit ago, and Susie and him are getting their Sweaters in a bit
---
Both depending on the context, I they are standing still, maybe buttdancing, they prob just want you to hit them to give you points, but if they are trying to 360 or being cocky they are just being toxic, I did this once where I 360‚Äôd a billy and then flashlights him and escaped right away, but my flashlight was still on and I lost it on the way out
---
All three are extremely fun, Myers has good perks (save the best for last is amazing, play with your food is alright at tier 3, and dying light isn‚Äôt too great, but it has its place), Ghostface has 1 great perk (thrilling tremors), 1 more situational perk (I‚Äôm all ears, I still really like this perk though), and a borderline useless perk (furtive chase), and pig has a really good perk (make your choice), a pretty nice perk (surveillance), and a perk that does almost nothing (hangman‚Äôs trick).
---
All three of these killers are pretty fun to play, they have some very good perks between them, and Ghostface is one of the best killers in the right hands, he takes a lot of practice though.
---
Literally not how that works but okay.
---
Just use plaid flannel if you can‚Äôt tell where you‚Äôre going to blink. Helps a lot for new players to get better at Nurse. Now that it‚Äôs a common Add+On then it should be easy to find this in bloodwebs.
---
Anything over $2 is a shitty price for a cosmetic. Just because shit game companies got you used to this shit doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not much.
---
1/4th of the game for a piece of clothing is not a MICROtransaction
---
Am I the only one who‚Äôs disappointed that Joey and Susie sound the exact same to frank and Julie
---
The day we get Funko Pops is the day DBD drives me bankrupt
---
Those whispers are caused by Doctor's insanity, which you are afflicted with on the debuffs, the brain symbol.
---
I'm kinda dissapointed myself, but it's still a 4 for 1 deal in terms of characters
---
Yes.. duh.
---
They‚Äôre also the entity‚Äôs whispers; they play if you have the Whispers perk!
---
Wait when is it coming then?
---
Shiiiit, I used Iron Will all the time. It's good for looping since I feel like the Killer's are too dependent on hearing.
---
Nothing personal, it‚Äôs just business.
---
 *yeets across pallet*
---
It was most likely a hacker. The only in-game explanation would be if someone broke a haunted grounds totem and then managed to hit everyone, but it sounds suspicious
---
Nah you just B A D
---
If it was gen grabs or locker grabs they one shot, otherwise I have no idea since you didn't mention the killer having haunted grounds.
---
&gt;ment level squad and put them against any killer besides the top 3 (with tournament level skill too ofc) and see what happens.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I bet that clown wouldnt have a 60% kill rate i
---
you do realize that fluke, by definition, means something outside the realm of expectation. Something very statistically improbable. So depending on your definition I suppose you could say 5% are flukes but I doubt anybody considers 1/3 to be "fluke" territory
---
BHVR are lazy fucks, they won't bother buffing weak killers (which is most of them) they'd rather nerf the few viable killers at the top and then claim the game is now balanced.
---
Im very sorry but im french canadian. And i don't take attention on this. But im very bad in english but still trying to write correctly
---
Hol' Up...
---
Thanks for being the one person who didn't say "Just give trapper all of his traps at the beginning".
---
That‚Äôs hot
---
That t-bag tho :(
---
You really not gonna give us the link?
---
I saw a some kind of grinning face in it before so I wasn't far off but damn do I feel stupid...
---
Oh happy days!
---
Possibly running the necklace add on with another; the necklace removes that audio cue when she is phasing and make it really easy to grab people off generators, as they don‚Äôt even know she‚Äôs even there until they get grabbed.
---
David King for Labor MP
---
If only Legion didn't suck. :(
---
I do but im tired to do only hex skillcheck for 0 bonus progression.
---
Could be grabbing people off gens with necklace add on.
---
"Next week"
---
Thank you
---
The unhooks for me. Even if I run the moment the survivor gets picked up someone just happens to be closer than me.
---
If only :(
---
And on spirits withering blight head cosmetic. She grows his third eye
---
well it doesn't work if they know you're in the locker. it's like trapper traps
---
Hopefully in a year or so Legion gets a rework that makes them a high tier killer like the devs did with Nightmare.
---
Every dlc character besides ST ones are 50% off.
---
That doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything. I‚Äôve had dozens of plague games where I 3k and depip
---
Half of these are just ‚Äúmake this add on part of the base set‚Äù if you play your cards right you can 4K with the majority of these killers, I agree some need buffs, but not by making addons part of their base set.
---
createScare.addSound(roar)
---
well yes, but actually no
---
Two, because it's someone confirmably good at the game vs. cross-platform data with no additional data to separate by SWF, perks, or matchmaking. Taking into account that early kills snowball immensely, that data's practically worthless for anything but identifying extremes.
---
Or do you get wiped in 70% of your games as Survivor?
---
So run a different one, like Rancor or Infectious Fright.
---
Noed doesnt help you, its pity kills. The aim is not to let them do gens. Ruin is meta, noed is for memes.  
---
Thats said play as you like, the game will suckk with imaginary rules. I play both at red ranks. As a surv I dont mind being tunneled/camped/slugged/notgivenhatch/mori etc. As a killer I also dont mind doing those things, I hardly use mori and noed but if i feel like it I will, no worries.  
---
I main Legion with thana instead of ruin mostly. Another thing is you dont have to win all the time. You'll get used to toxicity from both sides in no time. Eventually you'll just see them as cuties
---
Well in a way they do actually do it ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù if you just keep rotating to the closest gen it should be common knowledge by at most your twentieth game, AT MOST, to space our gens properly.
---
What perk is that between Stake Out and This Is Not Happening?
---
&gt; Make it so that survivors who reach madness tier 3 become injured or put in the dying state if already injured
---
This feels enormously overpowered. There is just no real looping Doctor after this.
---
It still is tho? Just cuz it makes your empty wallet cry doesn‚Äôt mean they still aren‚Äôt microtransactions and they‚Äôre still optional. As in dont buy them if mommy allowance is too little
---
...i don't... have those yet. I'm not even prestige on anyone yet.. my highest is a level 40 Quentin Smith... all my teachables (save for Quentin's perks) are from the Shrine. Like i JUST got self care because of the Shrine of Secrets yo...
---
wait an emoji, that's illegal
---
The problem with spreading out is that the game‚Äôs points system heavily relies on co-op points. So as opposed to spreading out I would hope the survivors could run in pairs and space out properly.
---
It does if one situation almost always happens to one character and the other happens similarly often to another. It might be more nuanced if Survivors varied more, but "A Survivor" is one thing and probably safe to assume meta perks for at red ranks as well.
---
They said it wouldnt need a client patch and that they would just update it on their backend meaning you would only have to restart the game.
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Piggy doesn‚Äôt need nerfs for sure and I feel bad for her. After they nerf spirit they should nerf billy and Freddy though. They‚Äôre definitely over preforming at red ranks. Every other killer is relatively close to each other then you see Spirit, Freddy, and Billy above everyone else in kill rate.
---
I just wanted the extra bloodpoints but now it takes so long to finish the challenges and the amount of bloodpoints doesn‚Äôt seem equal to the time put in.
---
That makes no sense. What does the killer or survivor‚Äôs spawn point have to do with spacing gens unless of course you don‚Äôt want to be chased first then by all means hide in a locker until you see someone get hit. Lol. Inefficiency is so much better than getting chased first.
---
Haha no worries. As for the wraith I think it's pretty different because he is quite clearly visible to the player and  he is a rather weak killer so making the wailing bell make no sound seems like a good buff imo. Otherwise you could make it so that it only starts ringing at the very end rather than as soon as he is uncloaking
---
It‚Äôs only hard when the other survivors are only doing the safest gens without realizing the killer is trying to 3 gen lock the game.
---
Well, then use Whispers and listen closely. Nothing can hide from Whispers.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be the same
---
Sounds perfect, except this makes unbreakable‚Äôs existence pointless.... which I‚Äôm fine with
---
A blendette can apparently. She still managed to open the gate even tho i never friggin saw her.
---
Honestly for the oni just nerf how much blood he gets on a hit and your fine no need to nerf him otherwise imo at least
---
Check ur audio drivers.
---
Honestly the game is semi-broken to the 3 gen strat. Luckily noob killers just camp and never learn about it early enough but if a capable higher tier killer wanted to run that strat then its a gg all day.
---
Thanks bro üòä
---
The archive doesn't have a time limit. The time limit is just for the rift. You will be able to complete the archive even when the next time releases. They've said so multiple times but it might not be clear enough ingame.
---
If you don't care about the rift then you can relax and just do the archive challenges whenever you want.
---
I  suggest this because they are very add on dependent and some of the adds on are rare and it's not possible to use them every game. For example  the silent wailing bell add on is an ultra rare so not viable every game.
---
Changes like the trapper getting traps from a locker are good imo because it means he doesn't have to leave his are of control to go and get additional traps and avoids that annoying issue of trying to pick them up and it taking ages.
---
But that's the simplest change, make some of their add ons part of their base set and then give them better add ons.
---
What I mean is make the bing bonging out of cloak have less sound, because coxcombed clapper wraith with the addon that supresses heartbeat and terror radius is ridiculous to be up against, even though they sacrifice windstorm and reappearance add-ons
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be.
---
Weird, I didn't think survivor mains ever left the loop. :)
---
I hope Hazbin and Imp has cameos
---
Started as killer main for hundreds of hours in red ranks and rarely played survivor. Facing SWF is usually what ruins the matches for me. If you play fair and they have an easy game they'll bm every opportunity... 
---
I've started to block people on steam that either excessively teabag or are toxic in post game chat. And every game as killer that I get I check all steam profiles to see if anyone of them is blocked. If they are blocked they'll get the most toxic game they can imagine. It's so satisfying to tunnel, facecamp, mori the suckers that were toxic when you played fair. The postgame chat gets really entertaining.
---
Recently I still started to switch more to survivor since it's a much more chill experience as solo survivor than as killer. I do get annoyed at noed and moris just like everyone else. Everything combined made me think how amazing it would be if some items like mori or key or a perk like noed were limited to being usable only against people that you've lost against before. Sure BHVR would have to track a lot of data but it would feel so much better.
---
Being able to bring a key against a killer you know killed you before or to be able to mori someone that escaped previously would be fun.
---
Not my Proudest fap
---
See, I'd argue that the high kill rates come from that last line. All it takes is one moron and a game that would otherwise be a 0k becomes 3 or 4. And considering how notoriously bad matchmaking is, that one moron shows up a lot. So the statistics overall, with how little specific information they give, are somewhat less informative than seeing actual gameplay at a known skill level. If you show me someone clearly playing poorly, I don't care what they think. If you show me someone playing near-flawlessly, who does so consistently, and getting stomped, that looks like there's a problem somewhere along the line.
---
Bro that‚Äôs sadüòÇ
---
Nerf or rework? I think a nerf would be if it affected his base kit.
---
The ‚Äúweaker‚Äù killers aren‚Äôt weak in the sense your thinking. They are just weak compared to the top 2-3.
---
The only killer that actually needs help is leatherface. It‚Äôs easy to get salty after a game or main one side and think the game is imbalanced but I promise the dbd devs did a way better job than you think.
---
If you doubt me on this for even a second, go play Friday the 13th.
---
Dota had it even before Fortnite
---
That stupid bich
---
He gets pissed off at survivors when they bleed too much.
---
My vote goes towards Black Metal Jeff.
---
Can we make this an official skin?
---
Maybe not high tier, mid tier would work for me. Legion definitely doesn't need to be in the position they started in, though
---
I‚Äôve played a little bit of Dota 2. When I say little, I mean little. Still, the few games I played, I don‚Äôt remember Dota advertising for a paid battlepass. So weird
---
What this implies to me is that I can use the force ingame so I‚Äôm ok with that
---
I don't see a problem gachiHYPER
---
Steve - Babysitter, Borrowed Time, Bond, Decisive Strike/We‚Äôll Make It/Iron Will
---
Nancy - Detective‚Äôs Hunch, Inner Strength, Fixated, Sprint Burst
---
Yup. You can use it as many times as you can heal 1 full health state of another survivor, but you can't stack it. One at a time
---
Something can be unbalanced and bad too!
---
Watched a Scott Jund video on why dbd shouldbt be balanced around the top 1% of players. And he made an interesting point, people love to complain about gen rush and how unfair a toxic swf group is but nobody bats an eye when a Iridescent head huntress  with an ebony mori ends the game just as quick.
---
That does sound like an improvement, since it would force anyone going for a save to do so quickly, meaning you would be much more likely to catch them on the way in or out.
---
You know what I‚Äôd like? Give trapper a 5 seconds channel, where you look at the trap and and the end of the channel it burrows under ground and appears in front of you
---
At this point his ability could slow while revving, then go back to normal and speed up, and that might make him more viable in a Chase.
---
Or maybe make breaking a pallet with the saw reset the momentum but let the charge keep going, really lean into Bubba being a super strong killer if you dare to try and juke or play risky.
---
Sadly, this will most likely be dodged by people suiciding on first hook :(
---
I finally feel fortunate that it keeps showing up in early bloodwebs, so I can just stick it on whoever has decent Iron Grasp and Agitation.
---
It totally isn't, PC gets full priority. In some way I get it. It's their largest playerbase. But don't throw you other console ports in the trash.
---
Leaving on a separate comment for easier discussion 
---
Make cloaked wraith totally invisible from more than 24 meters away and giving him more movement speed while cloaked should be enough
---
Not me, I have been readying up for an eternity
---
Delayed?
---
Not surprised.
---
SHE WAS DRIFTING LMAO
---
As long as you don't co-op heal any part of the heal you get to reactivate it
---
I believe it was because it‚Äôs a bug with a surge and surveillance combo
---
How is Legion a low-tier killer but also really difficult/annoying to play against?
---
Well, if you're gonna go down anyway, is there any reason to not try to bait out a swing by jumping into a locker?
---
Nurse is so cute it hurts
---
I like Otzdarva
---
She vibin
---
Yeah I think I saw that they're changing It to only one kill during EGC.
---
Not 100% sure on that one, I havnt seen a list of what they're changing!
---
A new awakening?
---
PRETTY GOOD JOB
---
Their "numbers" guy told them they can't again
---
Just look at the changes and nah don‚Äôt think they are changing that sadly
---
The Halloween one or the rift one?
---
No the right one
---
I wish they would leave Nemesis alone but BHVR is gonna change it when the new chapter releases due to complaints sadly.
---
"it'S OLd LeGIon AGaiN wTF!?"
---
:/
---
Jotted out at the last minute and then pushed out without review is the BHVR content model
---
unistall the game and reinstall
---
Really? You cannot heal someone else with someone?
---
No but from psn store
---
it's a joke
---
No longer bugged... next week
---
...... why did you think that was a thing?
---
It would be pretty crazy. You‚Äôre increasing the range and having reduced charged times as well so it‚Äôs literally a free health state.
---
If you do 99% of a heal and someone helps you with the last 1% of the heal you don't get your perk activated
---
You must be one of those survivors I match with that can't counter Spirit because of a small brain and huge ego. Thanks for getting me sacrificed, homie.
---
Yeah perhaps make it so that it can only be heard when he is right behind you but even then I'm not sure it is strong enough. Possibly though if they had it so his base speed while cloaked is increased by 15% and his reappearance/uncloaking speed is increased by 50%.
---
I feel like the Doctor changes kinda make him very similar with Plague without the consequence of making yourself fully healed.
---
I think you meant r/dbdgonegay
---
now why would she do that......
---
It doesnt make sense that it isnt a thing
---
Its not a coin flip. Its conditioning. The first time you make a play, say dropping a pallet and vaulting it back and that works, the next time your in that situation you have to think if you should go for the same play again or if she‚Äôll be expecting you to go for that same play since it worked before. Thats the mind game. Once youre in the other players head youll be able to waste a load of her time before you she finally gets you. Its like playing against nurse when you mix up doubling back and other line of sight break jukes.
---
Yeah that would be cool but I think trapper already loses a lot of time as it is and just going to a locker to grab a couple of traps seems less time consuming.
---
So you only get 99% activated?
---
People hate healing over and over and over again.
---
If you are looking around on the internet a bit, these statistics sadly include all consoles not only pc.
---
If you exclude them and you consider the other figures they released a week ago, the ones showing an 80% survival rate for rank 1 survivors, you will find that constantly pointing at these recent figures is not a smart idea.
---
Yeah! Ace mains rise up!
---
I had a level 40 one that had haunted ground 1 bbq 3 and pop 3.
---
First off... HOW ARE U ALREADY DONE
---
Also, the one for clown seems absurd. He can reload at anytime and being able to essentially keep a generator out of play for a minute would be pretty nice but having infinite bottles to do that? I don‚Äôt know about that one.
---
Im rising up, getting to rank 3 with legion only.
---
Same.  Spine chill is more prioritized than iron will for me tbh
---
I would definitely buy the Oni üòä He is so cute.
---
( and this game supposed to be horror game)
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Such a good combo
---
The reason that most of these are addons and not just buffs to each killer, is because then the killers would DESTROY new players(survivors) and then those players would just refund the game and BHVR would lose out on the potential money from skins and different killers. 
---
You have to think of this from a business stand point. Most of us have been playing for hundreds of hours and maybe a decent chunk have never spent anything past the game purchase. But new people could potentially buy the game plus more.
---
Yes
---
Rip I‚Äôm sorry (not sarcastic)
---
he does some toxic things, including his attitude and playstyle. Hes also really good, so it really excuses his toxicity. Overall a good player so it doesnt really matter
---
To be honest while dbd has a loyal fan base it's small , an maybe funko doesn't think anyone would buy.
---
Hex: Sensitive\~
---
That sounds worse, I‚Äôm sorry for your loss
---
Ah yes *Monro*
---
I disagree, It is a coin flip. You try a juke and pray to whoever god you follow that you‚Äôre juke worked. No skill on your end just luck. Theres zero information on how effective your juke was until it‚Äôs too late. 
---
Against a good spirit your juke doesn‚Äôt even matter as you‚Äôre moving over three times as fast as the survivor‚Äôs walking speed. They don‚Äôt need scratch marks or moans to find you, your footsteps and breathing is more than enough for a competent spirit player to find you.
---
If it‚Äôs the rift Jake I‚Äôve had my fair share of useless Jakes in a few games. One hid in a locker the entire match.
---
God, my boy legion is getting killed out there, he‚Äôs so fun to play but he‚Äôs also not high tier enough to compete...
---
Improper use of meme?
---
It‚Äôs only white while regressing. Once the gen is 100% regressed it turns red
---
He was downvoted because this community likes to virtue signal and some see trap as a slur even though there's entire communities that use the term with no issue
---
Ie r/traps is one (a very NSFW one)
---
The signalers ironically hurt their own movement because they keep making these strict ass rules like  "dont say this or you're hitler" which pushes people away from being supportive because spoiler alert people don't like being told how to speak or think
---
I wouldnt  be mad if they  let killer jump
---
Yeah although if you want to place 6 traps around killer shack would sacrifice a lot of control in other areas. Usually red ranks but with the occasional  purple rank team and the quality greatly varies.
---
My point is that wraith is too weak and needs a buff and you can hide your shimmer if your approach from a certain angle. Perhaps make him completely invisible until he gets within a certain range as well
---
Thank you!
---
As you can see here:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests#latest
---
The console and pc versions deviate quite a lot. Survivors on console are limited, with better controls and less lag you can pull off quite a few things on pc you cannot on console.
---
The game is balanced around pc because it is the only platform that matters for any competitive purpose.
---
Statistics released by Behaviour should be taken with a pinch of salt.
---
Awesome job! Looks great :)
---
It‚Äôs not the pacing of words, It‚Äôs the pacing of sentences. He sounds like a read please program, or like they cut out the narrator‚Äôs breaths between sentences. Sometimes his tone is fitting, but most of the time it sounds monotone, like they only paid him to read the script once without voice inflection.
---
Their "recolors" just get more and more disappointing
---
Yep same happened to me. I was an agent if the entity I was able to complete that as a survivor.
---
Yeah I think the honing stone should be part of his base set. Reduces the randomness of people escaping in one attempt and getting other survivors to help means less people on gens and gives you more time to get there.
---
Not even joking, I can barely notice anything. Wtf
---
I mean, no one wants to admit they ate 9 cans of Raviolli.
---
It hazbin a very confusing time for survivors
---
Yeah, I personally don't think that makes him top tier or anything either. Would be cool to see a different visual to his power too.
---
Yea, I started playing as a killer two days ago and queue times at rank 20 eu PC are like 15 minutes and a I'm getting NAT error every second lobby. Worst of all is match quality, people just either bomb rush hooks or d/c'ing  most of the time.
---
Literally just happened to me
---
Yeah I get that but when I was watching Otzdarva it stayed white infinitely once regressed. He said it's possibly an unfixed bug but that didn't happen for me? Was it because he was using surge too?
---
I doubt that happened, but if it did, it was a bug. It‚Äôs not supposed to do that. And no, it wasn‚Äôt because of Surge

What?
---
There are 7 gens on the map. If he want to focus on one gen then he is wasting a lot of time. But yeah I could see the issues in the end game with a 3 gen strat. perhaps it could have a cooldown on it - e.g he can't do it to the same gen for another 2-3 minutes or something
---
At least it's better than Nancy's
---
You have to think of this from a business stand point. Most of us have been playing for hundreds of hours and maybe a decent chunk have never spent anything past the game purchase. But new people could potentially buy the game plus more. Businesses always need to bring in more and more people... just the way the world works.
---
x24
---
The moment Christ saw this, he returned to his cross and requested the sweet release of death.
---
Just a new dlc killer, the strapper
---
It still wouldn‚Äôt even be good, it would just not be a trash tier perk never worth using.
---
‚ÄúTrick or trea-‚Äú
---
**neighbor dc‚Äôs**
---
It did happen 110%, if you watch any of his streams where he plays freddy then you'll see what I mean. Maybe it's been fixed on console but not pc?
---
Only if you buy from the ps store. Anything bought with Auric Cells or Shards does not get shared.
---
Can we just agree that monto is awesome
---
There's pops for smaller, more niche fandoms so honestly I doubt that's it
---
Yeah if it did happen it‚Äôs a bug then
---
Username checks out... wait a minute
---
Get a PC Pepega
---
I think there are generally three categories for killer success, Lethality, Ability to waste time/ lengthen game, and detection. Out of ten each trapper is like (in that order) 7/10 2/10 4/10
---
Doc is more like 3/10 6/10 7/10 Trapper cant really waste time and find survivors very reliably, doc can. If played right you can deny vaults and pallet drops, find people incredibly easily and waste time by putting survivors into tier3, also doc would be top tier by far if his tier 3 madness made you lose a  health state, you‚Äôd essentially have a cone weapon that goes through walls, shock until dead.
---
Yeah it's not totally horrible but I feel like I'm waiting for the poor guy to just take a breath.
---
Just Dodge the lobby or protect the babys
---
So dlc's are available for both accounts, even head case?
---
As soon as I realized how much power I had as a survivor (and how much I didn't as a killer), the game stopped being scary.  
---
Survivors control the game clock.  How good the one being chased sets how fast the gens are being done.
---
Going blendette is the same as throwing the game if you can't loop
---
It looks like he will be throwing it HARD,i think the update will give him the ability to throw hatchets but  the hatchet will remove 2 health states upon hitting a survivor
---
Yeah I understand that, it's the same reason swf won't be nerfed because they'd lose a lot of the appeal. 
---
I'm not sure how they can balance it tbh. Maybe have changes to the killer only exist past a certain rank and have some in game communication to help solo survivors
---
The archives are usually done in a couple games for t3 it's not that difficult lol
---
Thats why i always look at survivors hands, fuck key cucks
---
The doctor been taking some experimental meds
---
How do you have team mates if you're the killer?
---
There's always that one crying baby survivor
---
I just assumed he was referring to our Spanish Trapper Boi. Like, as soon as I saw his build I knew it was a direct ripoff of the (several) videos Otz puts out. Then he said that line and I figured it was a *homage*, kinda weird he didn't mention him by game though.
---
I thought they fixed this around a year ago. My fps never jumps above 60 during intro and load up. Not sure if that bug is still present in PS4 though
---
Hey these stats don't favor my opinion so I'm going to pretend I didn't see that - Every toxic survivor main
---
Ah yes, a tik tok user
---
I agree that BO1 is more fun but MW2 and BO1 are two very different games
---
Maybe it has something to do with his model transformation, still incredibly disappointing whatever the case.
---
My only problem is BE over promised. But think about it, it‚Äôs thanks giving and a weekend. They are people too unless the developers are currently sitting somewhere in India or Eastern Europe. So BE happy thanksgiving, just try not to overpromise next time and guys let‚Äôs cut them a break, it can be worse like... deathgarden worse
---
Lmao dear god I hate when survivors think they‚Äôre good at the game and only hang out by loops.
---
UPDATE: The David is now looping himself.
---
So I'm going to assume that everyone here agrees that Nurse needs a buff, Freddy needs a nerf, and Spirit nerds that are coming shouldn't be implemented because she doesn't have the highest kill rate she's basically tied if not a hit lower than hillbilly which most people believe is the most balanced killer
---
I've been reading so much fucking manga I keep reading these things out of order and it's like I'm getting spoilers
---
6 months without fix. Devs are lazy motherfuckers who don't give a shit about players outside NA.
---
Lol oh I love this, thank you.
---
Cheating is gaining an unfair advantage from third party software.
---
Griefing is teammates working with the opposite team. 
---
While they are both ways of breaking the rules they apply to separate things.
---
If you saw someone hacking their speed that‚Äôs obviously breaking the rules so according to you it‚Äôs also griefing.
---
shirtless?
---
Likely just rank 20, default.
---
Yeah I was being a bit sarcastic in my last sentence. Some will be chased regardless so no need to be too scared was my point. Once you get to higher ranks all your time should go to objective tbh. I mean you can get to rank 1 as an immersed blendette but that‚Äôs still the opposite of the meta and what your team needs.
---
Next you two should do Trapper and his little brother the Crapper from the Sanimatiin cartoons. ;)
---
cannot unsee
---
Now I‚Äôm intrigued.
---
Those are over a year old, not from last week. So I could say the exact same thing "stop using the 80% number it's bullshit"
---
You're welcome, I immediately wanted to make it when you said you vote for Jeff as the sexiest survivor.
---
I was actually thinking about doing trapper as my next costume. I talk to him and see if he‚Äôd be ok with it
---
What do you mean? Ace in the hole is meta :D
---
It's probably safe to say Oni was already near the end of development by then.
---
I bought Legion, and in my third match with him I hit my first Merciless Killer. Hes got a pretty fun playstyle I think, I just keep getting jump scared by his frenzy ending lol.
---
Ruin is way more important than any of the other options.
---
Well sorry for the misunderstanding, you have your opinion and I have mine let‚Äôs leave it at that yeah? I apologize for any wrong I‚Äôve done. Please continue to have fun in the game and if for whatever reason you wanna add me on steam: JustSomeWaffles
---
Yeah Blood Warden is fun, why remember me if I need NOED to prox?
---
Honestly, I didnt knowing I was looking at Nurse until I remembered she's after Billy. That was an awkward 30 seconds of who the hell is this
---
Thing is, the entity might have its own language. As indicated by the perk whispers, which reads ‚Äúyou have a rudimentary understanding of the entity‚Äôs voice‚Äù which suggests that it doesn‚Äôt speak a language we know. Most killers would know what English is except for the plague. 
---
It might be a coincidence that it sounds like ‚Äúget me out‚Äù.
---
Then again, we know that the entity doesn‚Äôt understand the real world but it does try to mimic it. Maybe the ‚Äúget me out‚Äù is something the entity picked up from a killer or a survivor along the way.
---
What is there to be skeptical of. I'm posting ideas for killers, not trying to get you into a pyramid scheme lmao.
---
Cheating = breaking the rules.
---
 And just so you know the killer is gaining an unfair advantage if your team mate is working with them because then it's a 3 v 1 and the hatch is being denied by your team mate still being alive. 
---
But can we stay on the current conversation, this was buried weeks ago
---
The new killer, OPs mum
---
Look at comment on newer post.
---
aww
---
I was thinking Save the Best for Last but Fire Up would be viable since it'll be at max when I need it most versus STBFL which would depend on tokens
---
if you buy in the psn store yes
---
"Stupid sexy trapper!"
---
Thank you for letting me know, I tried buying cells for my friend and there was some bs that just because they're using my US dbd that they can't buy cells because it needs to be the same as the game country it was bought in
---
like a skeleton key but worse, 1.cant open hatch 2.can only be used for 10 seconds by default
---
I was really hoping to read this.
---
Stupid, sexy trapper...
---
Now I myself disagree with camping in general but if that spirit is trying to win going across the map looking for 1 survivors isn‚Äôt the play when you have 3  people on nearby hooks also the hatch is dumb as shit it‚Äôs like noed it rewards playing shit now I‚Äôm not saying remove a feature that gives the survivor a last chance but don‚Äôt make it luck based
---
Dark Sense, Detective‚Äôs Hunch, Borrowed Time (the most meta out of any of them), Ace in the Hole. 
---
On my Bill build I run Unbreakable, which actually saw use often back when I ran him. Got a lot of lucky breaks with it.
---
I hope you aren‚Äôt using any Freddy perks as Freddy there. I got in trouble for that earlier today when I got that challenge üòÇ
---
I've seen rank 1 survivors pair up with a rank 20 killer.
---
I‚Äôm scrolling through the subreddit late at night, and this image actually startled me for a moment. Jeff you‚Äôre creepy af
---
Everytime I start a match, it's a fucking rocket launching
---
This is it chief
---
BUREOCRACY!!!!!!
---
Reading your comment reminds of that doge meme where he babbles ab crap and then gets bonked on the head
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs glitchy. 
---
I got 2 sacrifices as a survivor once. Same story as you, got bored and played a survivor match 2 people got sacrificed and I finished the ‚Äúsacrifice 6 survivors‚Äù challenge.
---
I know right! Babies are so cute, especially on console
---
Yeah I guess I should've said I was on ps4.
---
I always go back to the hook that the survivor was unhooked at, and if their savior is long gone and I find my previous victim, I either slug them and leave to let someone help them, or hook them again.
---
Congrats bro, you done did it!
---
Hooking everyone twice might seem like a good idea but on my first try 3 people suicided on their second hook, in my second game 2 people were never rescued and in a third it was a combination of both with a DC.
---
It's hard to win an argument when you make bs quotes instead of replying to what has been said. yeah I'm sure you're an expert on what behaviour would do, one post you are being nice and another you are trying to insult me.
---
If I was always being downvoted then I wouldn't have any karma would I!? If you actually read my post history then 90% of the stuff I put gets positive feed back. A few anonymous people who disagree with my idea for the doctor without any real explanation is pretty irrelevant.
---
I cal it OoO
---
Restart your switch. It happened to me yesterday.
---
Ah, all a killer loses by camping is ranking points (and not even that if another survivor is close by) and since ranks mean diddley-bupkiss I can live with that from time to time. Eliminating a player shift the balance of the game towards the killer, it puts pressure on the other survivors and since most of them are so desperate for those sweet altruism points instead of being smart and finish the gens if the killer camps camping usually results in at least 2 survivors not working on gens.
---
It can even become a swarm of 3 fruitcakes trying to get the save and that gives the killer a lot of chaser points and nulifies the camping penalty as well... it's a risk/reward strategy like any other.
---
Survivors letting people die on the hook so they can park their moist assholes on top of the hatch and getting 2000 extra BP for excaping that way though now that is bad play... no guts, no glory just looking out for #1. That is why most survivors whine so much, you think it's always so unfair if it's not going your way, but do you guys ever really teamplay? No 95% are vultures that will only show up when you can get someting out of it instead of truly teamplaying.
---
And that is what killers are counting on when they hook camp, and it's actually sad that it works so well...
---
I disagree.
---
Welcome to the game! I dont think there's much of a difference between digital and disk though I don't know about the nightmare disk
---
No the ps4 just has extremely loud fans, hopefully the ps5 will be quieter.
---
I am on ps4.
---
I love little wholesome after-match discussions with the survivors. I usually start things off saying, hey, sorry if I made a few scummy moves, needed to do something for the archives. Then it just becomes a conversation between us about how Level 3 just really sucks, and discussion on what challenges we‚Äôre currently going for, before we say gg, wish each other good luck, and move on.
---
I don't know about that boss
---
üò¨
---
I‚Äôm so ready for more Daddy Ace lore. And (hopefully) an Ace charm!
---
Yes.
---
I play both and survivors are generally worse but there's 4x the chance of a survivor BMing per game than a killer.
---
All fun and games until they‚Äôre hiding in a locker all game,
---
Best choice imho, while Ruin II and III are nice the 1% isn't going to do a lot while 25% BP is a big deal!
---
Nothing fills me with than putting traps in random places and survivors walk into it because they don't look down unless it's bear a loop.

---
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with MoM being a dead perk tbh, the poor people who main M1 killers got dicked on hard by that broken ass perk, it never should have been added 
---
The balanced nerf is a lazy bandage however. Running balanced was already a risk reward, playing survivor there was a decent chance you‚Äôd waste a perk slot by running it. But BHVR decided nerfing it would be better than fixing certain maps.
---
That‚Äôs really poor sadly
---
There arn‚Äôt challenges that require DLC because this tome focused on Claudette and trapper. 
---
After a couple of tomes you‚Äôll need certain characters to finish it.
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre not thinking of the **actual** tiger mask offering?
---
I‚Äôm honestly interested in what will happen once the rift finally goes past the guys that came with the game, and starts getting into the DLC characters. 
---
Will the challenges require you to use them? What if you don‚Äôt have them? Will they give you a challenge to do that doesn‚Äôt require them instead?
---
What I hope they do is make it so if you have Ace and Hag, for example, you get challenges relating to his perks, and Hag‚Äôs abilities. If you don‚Äôt have them, you get a substitute where you get like a Meg or Huntress challenge instead. That way everyone can still finish the rift all the way, but people that have the proper characters can actually use them.
---
Rule number 3 of gaming: never question bugs that work in your favor, it‚Äôs working as intended
---
It just counts how many Medkits are depleted during game, not if you deplete them. It's not a points event that is counted like blinding a killer or sacrificing a survivor. Since it doesn't have a BP point count it'll work for all players in the game on the quests, even the killer.

I thought these were the same picture until I read the caption. This guy's whole power is focused around blood, he should be covered in it.
---
Haunted Grounds got cleansed maybe? I don't know it's been a while since I dedicated time to playing Spirit.
---
I hope they make the characters free for the duration of the rift.

Crouching has no effect on GF‚Äôs terror radius. His power, night shroud, gives him the undetectable effect, removing both his red stain and terror radius. Crouching has 0 effect on any of it.
---
A lot of people ignore his crouch ability, however I find it useful to get closer to a survivor and to stay hidden more. I always crouch and lean to stalk survivors if they don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm there.
---
It's good that Jake's get played a bit more again, that way Bubba can finally get his last face unlocked!
---
Ooh, that sounds really cool. That would be a nice way to kinda advertise the characters, get people interested in paying for them after. But I sadly doubt that would happen

You can see trappers nipples

....whats the source for that butt?

Is that Detox?

And it still somehow stuns you.

thats so weird, also do you live in a fish tank

every time i see legion i imagine theyre someone who really wants to be cool and edgy
---
Shhh
---
I‚Äôd say Cannibal for BBQ, basically double bloodpoints every game, and shows you the location of all survs when you hook someone. Although Ghostface is my favourite to play.
---
I like their aesthetic
---
Nah OP is complaining cause the grind to get it for free is too hard. Or something. Idk it all sounded kinda like whining to me.

Nut By Daylight

if you know how to play just separate and solo gens, this doesn't work so well vs new players, they like the clump up for safety. Being separated literally makes Legion a one pump chump.

Helluva Trapper

I did that too except I was constantly "chasing" 1 person while the 2 others did the last 3 gens. Then I downed one with NOED and hooked while the exit gate was being opened and Bloodwarden activated. I went to find them and one of them was in the exit gate still and got hooked too. The last guy escaped because I didn't care enough to hunt him.
---
*laughs in HHHHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUU*
---
I wouldnt then ask for others‚Äô opinions. This subreddit in itself is more toxic than most toxic DBD Players.
---
Noob3 does normal things and calls them toxic as a joke since the DbD community is filled with dipshits that call everything toxic. I.e. toxic gen rushing (its not a thing) and ‚Äúoh killer has prayer beads let me quit bc they are dicks‚Äù
---
He is just very sarcastic and you just have to watch his light hearted content and enjoy it. You also don‚Äôt have to pay attention to everything he does unlike Otz‚Äôs videos. Otz is educational mostly and while Noob is also occasionally educational too, he makes DbD just a fun, light hearted thing to watch

You don't have to buy the cosmetics tho, if you want cosmetics then just wait for the next update where they give out a bunch of cosmetics for free

Trapper looking proper thicc
---
I like how nobody notices the impossible amount of bloodpoints you have
---
Yep! Definitely a trap!

That's not OP's, its a screenshot of a video on youtube where someone with 600 million bloodpoints fully prestige Oni and Yui
---
Spine chill is always used for me, now half of the killers are stealth it‚Äôs my personal favourite perk
---
One of the first teachables I unlocked, has made it incredibly easy to earn bloodpoints. The missing perk slot is an issue tho, but if you only run it while you're farming it should be good

Hag bad

When my PS4 Pro started being loud I cleaned it and now it's quiet again. Even in the archives it's completely quiet now.

Rank 20 killer queues are shit. Getting to rank 14ish makes the queues much quicker.

But shes one of the best killers???

How caveman chose their waifu 1800BC

Ah okay thanks. But still how can He have 600 Million bloodpoints?
---
I don‚Äòt use Surge myself but I‚Äòm pretty sure when Otzdarva played, the gens that had Surveillance applied by Surge stayed white at 0% even though they shouldn‚Äòt. I think he explained that this only happens when the regression happens through Surge instead of kicking.
---
LOL well that was easier than expected. I almost had to throw the game.
---
http://imgur.com/a/qXQz59p

I killed 2 while there was still 4 gens remaining, had the other 2 on dead hook by 2 gens completed... Literally waited in the corner waiting for them to finish the gen. They didn't even rush them. They were slow and probably looking for me. Followed Bill after gen completion, Whispers told me what door he was headed for. Got him down to slug, Ace, "The Obsession" , opened the other door so I doubled back, got Bill on the nearest hook and got to Ace in the 30 seconds before BW stopped. 
---
Much easier than I thought.

... NOED is too easy.

Killing a Baby Dwight is sin and should be punished for those who do.

I mean, technically you didn't trust any of the killers...
---
I mean I wouldn't really call this a "good twist", the old "Find hex totem but it's actually ruin :O" is one of the most overused jokes on here. I could tell where thidsmeme was going on panel two.

Actually, you can go into the wall from the dead end hall there. She was just cheating.

I'm rank 16 and I waited 20 mins and when I loaded to a game 3 people dced because I was playing plague and someone cleaned:(
---
Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll just leave the bandage in the game after already removing what caused it to be necessary.
---
I noticed that too while using the perk. Seems like its a bug because its not supposed to stay white at 0%
---
The change was so dumb, once people realize SB is much better thats gonna get nerfed into the ground 2
---
Wow that‚Äôs really bad, I actually never saw it on PTB. It‚Äôs cosmetics only but it would be nice if they added more blood on his torso and hands. Killer Prestige cosmetics are pretty badass, like Pigs for example.
---
Why not? The rank 2 survivor will get a rank 2 killer. The Rank 20 teammates will learn some experiences and lesson they never forget....
---
If not, they will unable to learn.....
---
The experience you get in each match is capped at 10 minutes / 600 xp unfortunately so you can only ever get a max of about 3/4 of the way to a fragment per match.

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahshahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

See right there ,I've did the skill check
---
When you're going for the iridescent emblem challenge and someone killed themselves early, so the only one you know for sure you can get is devout :|
---
I‚Äôd definitely go for the BBQ tier, It gives you an extra bloodpoints in the long run. Ruin is pretty much the same all tiers, they should increase the regression by 1%. A 3% and 5% won‚Äôt really make a difference.
---
Pretends to chase baby dweet and he drops pallet down when you're 50 feet away. \*face palms\*
---
*"See right there I used it as distraction as game told me to"*
---
A good hag player is an absolute nightmare to go up against. Definitely a top tier killer if played correctly
---
What a joke of a company.
---
Possibly Nurse due to her fatigue?
---
Personally if a killer let me get a bunch of BP like this and then wants to kill me at the end it don't bug me at all.

Borrowed Time doesn't work against Insidious or 0TR killers though. if you're doing it at least do it good!

Lol exactly. Typical Karma farm meme.

She‚Äôs so fat that that she‚Äôs one of the maps.
---
Since you are forced to use Monitor and Abuse to get the adept, try to use a sneak doc build: use the addons "Calm" - Class II and "Calm" - Carter's notes.
---
Strategy: don't go into Treatment mode at the start of the match, use Punishment mode to sneak up on people working on gens. If you need to, use treatment mode to interrupt the survivor you are chasing from dropping a pallet or vaulting a window.
---
After hooking them, use treatment mode to find your next target, then switch back to punishment.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
I never played her because I really don't like her design, don't know if this is universal tho.
---
What's wrong with Nancy's?
---
I really hate how over-used Trapper is.
---
That has a lot to do with your rank. In purple/red ranks, killer queues are actually faster than survivor ones, since there are more red/purple rank survivors than killers. Survivor queues take longer, and you often end up versing killers in green ranks because the game simply doesn't have enough purple and red rank killers to match you with.
---
Yeah I'm seriously considering not prestiging him, and p3 all my killers as soon as they come out.
---
Maybe playing a stealth character might help? It can also depends on your rank, as rank 20's will be easier but rank 1's will be damn near impossible. My advice is to play a stealth character like ghostface and try to grab off of gens
---
Best places to trap:
---
1. killer shack window!
---
2. popular loops (windows and pallets)
---
3. narrow paths covered in tall grass
---
4. places survivors frequently pass through (play survivor and see where you would go)
---
(5.) place one or two traps really obvious at a pallet or a window to generate additional map awareness when they are disarmed
---
When does this update coming out. My challenges are the same.
---
Ps4 here
---
or if you can just message them and ask
---
Oh god
---
6? That's ridiculous, you'd be lucky to get 1 depending on your rank. Should at least be a 50k bp one, if not lowering the requirement.
---
If you‚Äôre struggling too much try to farm with survivors, grab them from gens and drop them until you complete this pathetic challenge.
---
i've been trying with ghosty but i can't seem to actually grab anyone, it's bizarre.
---
if i go through enough matches trying to do this though eventually i'll end up back at rank 20 and maybe then i can pick up survivors like grapes off the vine
---
Guess you're not from the EU
---
"I don't understand why it's so hard to play the game and do challenges at the same time"
---
The "challenges" are either hard, or tedious. People would rather get them out of the way then try to struggle through them, Its much better to just farm rather then actually play through them bc they are basically luck based
---
No, more annoyed.
---
The trapper has become the trap
---
You're almost there buddy, keep going!
---
They go around and cut me off or I just get hit through the window anyway when I'm meters away.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\\_/¬Ø.
---
Being forced? No one is being forced to do these challenges. My point is that these challenges are forcing a change in peoples play style and in most cases, these challenges have a negative affect on other players/the game.
---
Her ability to shut down loops is amazing.
---
It's already started and is still going on.
---
The percents are additive, not multiplicative.
---
Yea, the challenges need to be changed. It's the first tome so I was expecting this, I'm sure within the next tome or  2 they will get better.
---
So with a week delay are they adding more time to the overall rift count down?
---
Did you mean mods? Devs aren‚Äôt removing the overused jokes lol
---
Why ask for an Iron Grasp to be brought down to the tier of Boil Over, one of the worst perks in the game? Especially when it's already completely outclassed by Agitation.
---
Billy is definitely a lot slower while revving.  Unless you had already lost the chase, them 99iny their saw shouldnt ever be a problem.
---
Dude who else heard the hulk say this
---
dude i swear they figure out a way to kill themselves if you avoid them.
---
Like i refuse to even look at them all game then as soon as i hook the meg in basement she turns into the dwight
---
Ah oh cool, looks like I'm using surge haha
---
Was this when you were also running surge?
---
Those 25k bloodpoints better be worth it!
---
I believe you don't lose all of it with tombstone. Maybe he had addons to stalk faster?
---
Billy is slower when he charges his chainsaw. He moves to around 100% movement speed as opposed to his normal 115% movement speed while charging the chainsaw.
---
The only real way to prevent a billy from sawing you is to use everything in your power to prevent him from being very close to you as it will allow him to more or less guarantee a insta-down. 
---
Windows are your safest best against a Billy as it forces them to have to walk around the window to get an angle on you.

---
I love the Legion‚Äôs concept and design, but I really suck when I play the Legion. 
---
I don‚Äôt play Killer much either way but my track record is definitely much better as the Wraith over the Legion. I usually get at least 1K as the Wraith, but often 3K-4K (I am low ranked though). I have a really difficult time with the Legion and sometimes can‚Äôt get a kill in at all. 
---
I actually picked them up because I was really into their design/concept and wanted to be contrary to the massive amount of hate they received at the time. Then they really beat them down with that nerf hammer. I never really knew how to use them before that though.

ummm, running Overwhelming Presence or Franklin's Demise? thats my best guess
---
Hmm then I am not sure. Myers cannot stalk dying survivors. The only other thing I can think of is that he had stalked or done some stalking on the third survivor that was not downed to 99% and then activated it on you. 
---
I have no idea how else it could happen.
---
That's the point of the battle pass...
---
But about the end game pop up, I agree it is annoying and should only appear if you hover your mouse over it

Finally caved and purchased the pass last night, and I'd say it's worth the ¬£8 for sure!

Yo getting a skeleton key with killer aura add-ons is lit
---
Probably because while her basekit is already good (if not great, like the original Nurse) and that perks and addons just make it better, she requires strategy moreso than other killers and her approach is more inclined to setting up (like Trapper) and finding survivors with her traps. She can hunt and chase survivors, but doesn't have the speed for it. Instead, you want to hide and ambush them. I want to say she's similar to Nurse in terms of skill ceiling. 
---
There's also that gen rush and coordination really hurt her so if survivors destroy your web, it's really hard to make a comeback. Despite her power not having little to no counterplay, We'll Make It, Borrowed Time, Object notably and Urban Evasion hurt her. However, losing as Hag often ties to making major mistakes (eg: poor trap placements, chasing into a zone with no traps, not resetting and moving your web, chasing for too long, not teleporting to traps at all). 
---
That said, losing as Hag is actually more beneficial and overtime as you improve with her, it feels very rewarding. You can also get very creative with your webs, especially addons, so she's really fun to play.

---
"Sacrifice the obssesion 7 times" you all MF better have DS
---
As a killer main with a pretty solid survivor background, I honestly don't "understand" your "killers' POV".
---
First, games are supposed to be **fun**. Don't let what strangers online say or do get under your skin. Have the right mindset: you're in a lobby with 4 other strangers to have a good time. Are there toxic individuals out there? Sure. But their words and actions have nothing on you if you just laugh it off and act cool. They'll just be making themselves out to be the clown they are. I've faced some salty/toxic SWFs back in my days. I just play normally, say nice things and move on. You're just feeding them the attention they want if you play toxic in return, and say nasty things in chat. Deprive them of that attention--that's how you deal with weed, by sapping them of nutrition. Its not like that represents the majority of the player base. Most players are chill and in it for fun. And most of the "toxic" players I face are simply trying to have fun/meme and are self-aware, being generally nice at endgame chat. Eh, I guess there tends to be one salty manchild every other game, but you can just ignore him/her.
---
Also, Noed and Ruin are **not toxic**. Noed is a crutch perk, sure. But toxic? How so? Survivors have counterplays to it, and Inner Strength gives an incentive for survivors to break totems. Over-reliance on Noed might suggest needing more practice with gameplay, but who cares? While I'm not fond of it, I have nothing against ppl using it. And Ruin is necessary if you're not running DL/Thana/Pop, and DL/pop are arguably much better perks for slowing the game anyways with red rank survivors being able to push thru ruin, if Ruin doesn't get found in the first 30 seconds anyways. Perk build is your choice, and there is nothing toxic about it.
---
As for being "nice" or "fair", I don't think you have the right idea of what a **"fair" killer** is. Most survivors don't give a shit about escaping if they had fun. A fun killer to play against is simply one who doesn't ruin others' fun by camping you the whole hook, or tunneling off hook nonstop (bonus points for mori off hook). Nobody cares what perks you run, getting free escapes, or you taking it nice in 3v1 (IMO its better to just end it fast). I feel like I'm on the nicer side of the spectrum in that I try not to tunnel people if I see other targets (and esp. if they got sandbagged), but that is pure choice which I can bend the rules as I see fit. With DS/BT being as common as is, you don't really want to chase them anyways other than maybe slapping them to force a mend (and in the absence of, I just decide based on how much control I have over that match). Important thing is that DbD is a PvP game: each others' fun is determined by our own actions. And it is imperative that everyone share in on trying to have fun together.
---
Lastly, what is the point in trying to justify your current/future toxic actions? If you are being toxic, you are toxic. No excuses. Don't pretend like you are some anti-hero trying to right the wrong done to you. But keep in mind you, as Killer, pretty much dictate the mood of the game. The game has come a long way in terms of balance and even the most toxic SWF won't be immune to getting downed/hooked (unlike when Instas, DS, Mettle were all in their broken state, with 2x more pallets in map alongside pre-nerf infinites. that was fun to go against..). There are still some changes needed to balance gen progression and specific loops, but many are still being fixed (new BL change fixes Haddonfield for the most part). Point being: **You have a choice as killer**. You have full control over whether you have fun or not, and by proxy whether the survivors have fun or not. If you don't let your prior or current frustrations affect you, you will have a fun game with everyone in the lobby having fun. This could be a tall order though--and individual mileages may vary I guess.
---
My brother used it before I got him the game
---
ace or steve
---
I know.
---
Why.
---
you dont need any perks to loop any killer except nurse and spirreh and hags traps are useless in a chase, you just run to the next loop... she can only put down 10 and theres def more then 10 loops per game and shes the slowest killer too, you shouldn't chase with a hag at all.
---
I just imagined the oni rage mode but with trapper voicing it and it sounding like some reverbed trapper stepping in his own trap multiplied by hundreds
---
Yes, if it wasn't obvious. I mean who would actually run iron will to be quiet over no mither?
---
Thanks for the reply. I'm on PC. And I don't encounter the bug as you described. The bug pretty much uses up all the freddy splinters I offer and doesn't let me play him. I simply spawn as one of the killers I own (the one I make the offering with). It doesn't unlock me freddy temporary or anything like that. It's bizarre that this bug is still in the game.

My Xbox does the same thing

Let me opt out then instead of putting seasonal events in there which should be separate.  You're right - should not come up unless clicked on.

Shame on you for not staying in Tier, 1 I mean wtf were you thinking man?

No but seriously, thats actually fucking hilarious. Thats his ability after all. üòÇüòÇ

Umm... Hello there....
---
If he gets hit and it triggers borrowed time it's not a safe hook rescue. It's a rescue but to be a safe one he neds to be unattacked for what was it... 7-10s. I think.

2 hooks all then kill them in endgame thats how I did it

It's     NOED + Blood Warden + Remember Me    time!

Just bask in their hatred as well as in their blood!
---
Cancer (Survivor)
---
Empathy, Distortion, This Is Not Happening, Aftercare
---
I chose Empathy and Aftercare to reflect Cancer being connected to others emotionally, and Distortion to show their ability to withdraw and hide. This Is Not Happening because Cancer is moody and reacts intuitively to the changing situations around them
---
Basically, true to their origins, Cancer perks are a Claudette/Jeff blend
---
Cancer (Killer)
---
Agitation, Mad Grit, Nemesis, Rancor
---
Agitation and Mad Grit because Cancer is reactive and moves from their emotions, and Nemesis and Rancor for their capacity to hold grudges and view conflict in deeply personal terms. Most of their perks would reflect a shifting emotionally-led playstyle as opposed to strictly strategic or analytical
---
Fun prompt OP!

Indeed, Our battles will be glorious!, We shall bask in their fear, their hatred, their anger AND their blood!

Bad optimization
---
If you don‚Äôt have decent headphones or aha e a hard time hearing survivors, yes. Also if you see yourself encountering Iron Will a lot yes. However most Spirit mains would recommend that you not rely on it completely. Similar to how some Nurse mains say don‚Äôt rely on any of her perks and learn her without them first. (At least before the rework that was what I was always told by both groups.)
---
I had the same issue with a toxic cunt couldnt find a way to report him. If someone has let me know too.
---
Lol everyone gonna hate either way, may as well win and be hated ;D
---
Yep, my main perk as survivor.
---
I hate stealth killers, so spine chill alerting me of a t1 myers is a godsend.
---
Ok cool and I can play spirit ok without but I encounter iron will a lot
---
It does work agains Iron Will, but it also makes you hear sounds much closer than where they really are coming from, so watch out for that.
---
Just block them
---
Ah that's good to know, cheers
---
Personally I like The Plague a lot, if you use Thanatophobia and Dying Light on her he gets exponentially harder to deal with, and the Thanatophobia will add more issues to the disease in the form of slower repair and such prompting them to not only take the broken status but also the slow, it will cause some survivors to heal faster giving you more Corruption pools.
---
Hag with Monitor and Abuse only has a 16m. TR that's actually quite good... and once you learn to use the teleport skill she is very quick on the battlefield.
---
It's all preference, go for what you like best.

That's unfortunately how it is now. SWF used to be average rank of all players, but since many high-ranked Survivors abused this to bully lower ranked Killers when playing with low-ranked friends, the devs ultimately decided (relatively recently) that it would the highest rank now that determines the matchmaking.
---
Lmao
---
Lmao, nice job
---
Already a thing üò≥.
---
alas i don't have her
---
Nope, you just didn't understand how the game actually calculates that stuff. I understand that the wording is misleading, that's indeed on them, but that doesn't mean the calculations in the background are wrong.
---
Even if seems weird, the doctor has the fastest grab in the game if you're in treatment mode,you need to click various times really fast but is an almost garanteed grab
---
Did you mean add-ons?
---
His lore says he was alive centuries before Rin. He is her ancestor ebeing the yamaoka that started the curse on their familly and drew the entoty to them from the start

The Walmart here pays $13.00 to start, we're also $7.25. Where I live it's a pretty sweet deal.

The future of DBD.
---
You're just going through my posts at this point. What a shame as judging from your history you are apparently someone in at least their 20's lol.
---
If you have spirit, shes probably one of the best characters for grabs since you can hear gens being repaired, and, for the next week or so at least, you can actually bump the survivors to tell which side of the gen they're on.
---
He isn't implicating that he did a bad job, he did well cause he got loads of blood points

I have a "Saver/Babysitter" build for Steve, for onvious reasons. Mom Steve wont end hust becuase of a different cosmic threat now will he ? Its borrowed,babysitter,Well make it and a flex slot which can either be ds,an exhaustion perk or something along the lines of saver again
---
I always thought it was some funny face, never saw the demon. Kind of like if the Gingerdead Man was squished flat.
---
No shit they cant do percentages. Have you seen their "statistics"?
---
Ah yes, this is also true, how could I have forgotten?
---
I know exactly how the game calculates that stuff. It's just flat out wrong with respect to the game rules stated.
---
It's called sneak and do gens
---
Dedicated servers isn't Billy's fault. What's your point? Yes, dedicated servers are fucking ass, and for every bullshit window chainsaw you get, I get a phantom chainsaw, where I should have hit a survivor but didnt.
---
BHVR fucking sucks.
---
Iron Will is a fantastic perk now that it actually works most of the time. It used to constantly bug and just not work at all. It is also one of the top Spirit counters as well. However, it only helps a survivor when they are INJURED. So remember that a healthy survivor still breathes out loud normally, and some survivors are much louder than others. 
---
Here‚Äôs something to keep in mind as a Spirit. 
---
https://youtu.be/P0aFo4lPARw
---
The YouTube video link is an experiment that a YouTuber named **not Otzdarva** did to find out who the quietest and loudest survivors are. This was done before the Stranger Things DLC mind you. It‚Äôs a good video to watch as a killer main. 
---
The Loudest male survivor is **Jeff**. And here are the male survivors in order from loudest to quietest:
---
- Jeff
---
- Ash
---
- Bill
---
- Jake
---
- Adam
---
- Quinten
---
- Dwight 
---
- David
---
- Tap
---
- Ace
---
(I believe Steve is closer to the top but somewhere also in the middle)
---
Female Survivors from Loudest to Quietest:
---
- Meg
---
- Feng
---
- Laurie
---
- Claudette 
---
- Nea
---
- Jane
---
- Kate
---
(I also imagine that Nancy is somewhere in the middle) 
---
So you will frequently find it more difficult to find Ace and Kate in terms of sound. I have no idea what Yui will be like as she hasn‚Äôt been tested. But with this in mind it does help you to just find survivors via their breathing. Male characters tend to be louder and taller, and are therefore easier to find. Ace specially is so quiet that he practically has built in Iron Will.
---
Being in ¬´¬†such a situation¬†¬ª, which is what, exactly? She could‚Äôve hooked and closed the hatch, but she tried to be cocky. She deserved every bit of it.
---
No. The killer shouldn't know how close a survivor is to wiggling out.
---
No.
---
I agree.  Legion is also my favorite killer to play.  That bring said, if they ever brought in some characters from Dead Rising I'd be all over them.
---
why
---
Sometimes I really, REALLY wish I wasn't fucking stupid :)
---
I cannot see anything in the grass and I feel like being blind and a joke... I mostly play tall/medium height killers.
---
Love the Legion aesthetic so much. Legion the only character I've bought skin for.
---
Nobody is gonna mention the blood points amount? Good lord.
---
Are you sure they‚Äôre mentally ill and not just high school students? Oh wait...
---
That's the big brain play though. At this stage of the game, people know most if not all the good spots for traps, so they instinctively avoid said spots (like that corner bush at Killer Shack). So you put traps where they may swerve too and CLANK!
---
Quentin would totally have something to do with insomnia.
---
As survivor, definitely Hawkins. Only 2 pallets are not worthless on that map. I can't even remember when was the last time I escaped through thr gate on Hawkins. And as a killer, definitely Ormond. I swear tracking people is impossible on that map because scratchmarks are so faded. I even struggle to see some of the hooks because the red is faded too.
---
Those add-ons match perfectly well and make it even less possible to do anything against Spirit once injured, especially with Butcher. Getting the first hit against healthy survivors is more difficult with Mother-Daughter Ring, of course, but "more difficult" in Spirit terms is still "pretty easy" territory, and then Ring also allows you to catch up in mere seconds if a survivor did manage to get away.
---
People generally underestimate Father's Glasses, it's kinda comparable to Prayer Beads in how BS it is. It gives you precise info on an injured survivor's path and location, and all but nullifies Iron Will, more directly so than Stridor. At the very least, the Bloodhound effect should not for some inexplicable reason be innate to phasing, so that way you would have to use Bloodhound and Butcher to use Glasses to its full effectiveness.
---
Shame they disconnected, though. Make sure to also burn your Black Wards while you are at it.
---
Well duh, the truest gamers xD (sorry, I'm really dumb over phones)
---
Spreading across the map means walking across the map as a slow killer and as gens get done, part of the map becomes dead zones. 
---
Hag either takes a lot of luck or a lot of foresight to really shine.
---
it would be very cool to have a killer that kinda distorts the world, like things get warped and blurry, but people would 100% get sick from that
---
Its only 39 years of doing gens you are close!
---
Same thing happened to me, IT'S THE ENTITY, IT'S BREAKING OUR MINDS
---
Is that sarcasm
---
Hey I saw that on Monto first
---
Even if he dedicates a non-meta perk to it? 
---
Most killers can count anyway...
---
There are times when a person truly is a scumbag, but personally I don‚Äôt see the point in wasting the time because most of them do it on purpose and don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs just really ridiculous when someone WINS (survives or 4k‚Äôs/kills you) and then they still feel the need to harass and talk shit. Like dude, you WON. 
---
The most I will ever do, is call out a scumbag survivor that is purposely trying to get other survivors killed. Because hilariously, if you add the killer to the chat and they see it during the game, they will specifically go after the scumbag. The nicer killers (me being one of them) even purposely let the survivor making the call out live or even go so far to farm with them as an apology. Personally, I call that justice. If I‚Äôm playing solo and I notice a survivor doing something like that I don‚Äôt feel bad blasting them and warning the rest of the team. 
---
Also when playing killer if I notice a survivor doing something like that to another survivor I personally make sure the scumbag dies, and gets as little points as possible, and like I said above I help the person who got screwed over. Especially in the situation of a 2 v 1 where I‚Äôm constantly only finding one of them and the other is just hiding and not even trying to do a Gen or literally anything but hide for sometimes as long as 15 minutes or longer. I will personally message the survivor I keep finding and let them know, ‚Äúhey you realize your teammate is screwing you over for the hatch right?‚Äù As a survivor main that doesn‚Äôt care about killer and only plays killer for extra BP and quests, I refuse to turn a blind eye to toxic actions I find myself constantly being hit with when I play survivor.
---
r/downvotesreally
---
pretty common build honestly
---
If you can look ahead and put them in places survivors are more likely to go, it can work just fine
---
Sorry I didn't notice the joke. But judging from our previous interactions and your comment history, I honestly can't tell. And also not once did I even mention spirit in my comment lol

What a god I always believed in you man

Same goes for the sacrifice.I played surv and I got progression for sacrifice  after every game.
---
it only effects his legs and mask lol wtf
---
It definitely works (or did work) with some of the other survivor challenges. I think it was the depleting medkits one - my friend depleted a medkit and I didn't and I got progress. Some of them give you progress no matter who did it in a game.
---
The Oni's mask is not only on the offering, but you can see it on the map somewhere in the house
---
Battery pack? I didn't know DBD was out for 360
---
I saw some weird face before I am so stupid
---
Nea would be the ultimate stealth killer. She would be dead silent until she tagged you, and she'd probably have a built in Balanced Landing type ability where she gets a bloodlust boost after falling
---
*Damn boi he ^thicc*
---
You call my comment dumb when i say spirit is easy and stridor makes her even easier, then say you didnt notice the joke and that you never mentioned spirit.
---
You commenting under this saying it was dumb is literally saying you think spirit is hard. Unless you agree that she is easy, then you just called yourself dumb.
---
Give the speed boost a exaustion and it's good. The whole fast valt from whatever angle is good
---
Poor quintin..
---
yeah that will be overpowered without exhaustion
---
Billy is x10 worse imo.
---
Ya. That's Just Free speed boost city!
---
the spirirt had 5 gens left, garenteed gold devout and iri gate keeper is always a pip
---
Frank West survivor

Snapshot: Press the active perk key to pull out a camera and take a picture of the area in front of you. Earn bloodpoints based on objects present such as hooks, chests, other survivors, and even the killer. The more objects of note, the more bloodpoints you get. Has a cooldown of X/X/X seconds and taken snapshots can be viewed postgame
---
Improvisation: Anything can help. While running, press the active ability key to lunge forward with a salvaged piece of scrap. When the killer is struck by it, they are slightly slowed for 5 seconds but may still attack. Improvisation causes exhaustion.
---
Wars Covered: What good is a scoop if there is no one to see it? For every survivor who escapes before you, gain a 25% stackable boost to all bloodpoint gains capping at 25/50/75%.
---
Hillbilly is the worst looking Killer imo. That said, I wouldn't mind a Hag redesign.
---
Yeah they're cute until they fail 5 skill checks in a row
---
GeNEAral Kenobi.. you are a bold one!
---
Which nevertheless doesn't mean it's calculated wrongly, it's working just as the devs intended.
---
That the wording is misleading could be attributed to them being French Canadian, English is a second language to them.
---
Mettle of Mans getting buffed?
---
Sounds like a normal anti heal build
---
thats not an excuse, there was still no skill involved and there could be numerous reasons to close a hatch like that for one the person may have been unhooked recently so you cant take the risk. "just dont do certain thing toxic killer" is not an excuse for unfair circumstances when the killer could have had a reasonable reason to do that thing. but of course it is all the spirits fault for not anticipating something out of her control 4 head.
---
New Chapter leak confirmed; Killer: The Spy
---
this sub has gone to shit when someone expressing pity is downvote bombed
---
No, I don't agree with your statement. I don't care that she's easier or not. I think your comment is stupid because he wants to know if he should use stridor as a way to counter iron will (it's heavily implied). Any monkey can use spirit and fuck over a survivor without iron will. 
---
I'm not going to reply to any further comments from you as it's a waste of my time, I mean like you are the same person who hates the balanced landing nerf because then it actually becomes balanced
---
Maybe because they made the killer from the mask on the family shrine thing from the estate... Mind = blown. Funny how that works.
---
If being a project manager means taking the easier way out instead of addressing the actual problem, I don't want people like you either. I agree it does take lesser resources to nerf BL, but that doesn't address the reason why BL was broken. I'll let you do the thinking.
---
"if i can help it" there are situations were you need to shut the hatch - though rare- you cant assume the spirit didnt fall under one of these situations. if anything having to shut the hatch for saftey is more common than adrenaline plus key because key users are counting on escaping through hatch instead of making it to endgame.
---
I literally did this the first time, then realised I didn‚Äôt have the challenge selected.
---
Did it the second time, realised I didn‚Äôt have the challenge selected.
---
It took 4 more attempts WITH it selected for me to actually complete it
---
Those ads-ons are great together, especially when running sloppy butcher
---
That hurts but it‚Äôs fair
---
Balanced Landing gets its passive removed, so no.
---
If balanced stayed, it would be something I could get behind
---
You're making an assumption based on how the game refers to it. People still crash when the game loads.
---
You survived but were you hooked?
---
Horrific.
---
"cheating" the amount of times that this claim has been debunked in so many ways - its just fucking hilarious that you think thats a valid point
---
Can‚Äôt lose altruism points for leaving someone behind if you‚Äôre already GONE
---
When they came out with Legion the first disappointment was that the "multiple characters" aspect turned out to just be a cosmetic gimmick. Then I assumed they would at least get a lot of cosmetics, due to that. But they've barely gotten any at all. The characters not having distinct voices is also a disappointment.
---
The biggest disappointment with Legion however was the exploitability of their original design, and while the "rework" was disappointing as well, I enjoy playing Legion, and think they'd be fine with a few key adjustments (and add-on buffs). What I primarily want is for Frenzy fatigue to be reduced back to 3 seconds again, because while I do enjoy Legion as a barebone chaser that mostly uses their ability as a way to set themselves up for those chases, Frenzy should have some in-chase value against survivors that are already inflicted with Deep Wound or already injured. But the Deep Wound state itself could also be looked at, as well: now that survivors are not supposed to actually bleed out anymore to begin with, the bleed-out mechanic could be replaced with other effects that incentivize survivors to mend, and ideally they would be chase-relevant effects.
---
I'm looking forward to the adjustments that are coming with the new Chapter. While they're not going to change a lot about Legion's strength, they'll make them more agile again and increase the fun factor of using their ability. And personally, I won't miss the Sloppy Butcher/Save The Best For Last interactions, as I hardly ever used those anyway. No word yet on whether the Nemesis/Beast Of Prey interactions are being addressed for release, which I hope they will be.
---
Also: Julie best member. Unfortunately I don't like her new cosmetic too much, and given that it will probably take months if not years before we see another Julie cosmetic, I bought Dropout Frank, which is just pretty stylish.
---
At least her wacky ass height makes it impossible to flashlight blind her 90% of the time.
---
Inb4 nEa iS dA kIlLeR
---
no balanced landing still has the passive while not EXHAUSTED so i think that lithe should vault a fast vault from any angle while not  exhausted but if you are exhausted the vault from any angle (except well the angels that you can fast vault from) will be normal medium vault
---
Definetly Feng!
---
Thick borders finally! Thank you.
---
I don't know if that perk works on ruin skillchecks but even if it does..realistically, it's inconsistent and risky
---
:)
---
Neither
---
Outplayed to the max bro shoulda hit fredbert harder
---
Bloodpoints
---
Dead Rising is all about gaining Prestige Points to level up and become more powerful, so it's fitting that Frank would provide point-boosting perks. Snapshot is quite literally a direct rip from Dead Rising's photography mechanic. Wars Covered also encourages you to help your team survive, which I would say is far from nothing.
---
She‚Äôs extremely hard to learn
---
I really thought this was about the zealot from darkest dungeon that aside cool concept my dude!
---
Yippieyayaymotherfucker!
---
I did the same with bubba
---
He‚Äôs not invited to the murder party
---
oh, when talking about a free fast vault just for the speed burst use then sure, why not?
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see it sooner or later. As far as I know the Dbd team would like to include Pennywise and Jason. I'm not sure if they can get a license for Jason but I can't see why not for Pennywise since the game has a good reputation among the players and large for the genre player base, its like getting paid in return for free advertisement (licence).
---
Who the fuck did you get so much fucking bloodpoints?
---
It's been discussed before many times and I don't think there was a statement from developers about it. I might be wrong on this one.
---
he cheated in legacy skin out of frustration because behaviour was ignoring his valid claim for his old one to be given to him after he lost it to a save data bug way back when. his actions did not effect anyone and he was not giving himself anything he didnt deserve he later apologised for his actions
---
&gt;You won‚Äôt get into high ranks this way,
---
Because that's not the right way to play Bubba, even if it's simple. It won't work against good survivors because they'll see a camping Bubba and bash out the rest of the gens while their buddy dies.
---
Bubba's map pressure sucks, but he's still a 115 killer with an instadown. If you understand how to mindgame with his chainsaw at pallets (or just run pwyf), then he's a serviceable killer.
---
Incredibly map/survivor dependant.
---
Play Hag vs a couple of flashlights and come back with the results.
---
But that‚Äôs not how it is at red ranks for a killer. For a killer if you 2k that‚Äôs a black pip if you are lucky. You need to be constantly winning in order to stay up there. 
---
Meanwhile for survivor, you can die and as long as you didn‚Äôt potato out, you would probably safety pip. 
---
If the current system was fine with a killer in a ‚Äúdraw‚Äù with survivors and was more punitive on survivors who ‚Äúlose‚Äù in the eyes of the entity, then I‚Äôd be fine with not 3/4K every single game. But the fact that you can‚Äôt maintain your rank at the current line where it is considered balanced, shows that there is an issue.
---
I bought legion because when he came out I remembered thinking ‚Äúso it‚Äôs like a survivor snapped and started stabbing people? Cool.‚Äù
---
how
---
Honestly it feels more like that in higher ranks -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ywbzUWfQE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ywbzUWfQE)
---
Thanks for that. I better start grinding right away then.
---
Or maybe because he's not op?
---
I think pink haired Nea looks better but I also think she‚Äôs more toxic than blue haired feng
---
I took a month break from the game and i'm wondering what is the power level of the ONI? Is he spirit level of EZ and Good or like a trapper where there is skill needed but is nutty AF?
---
Put an obvious trap near a hidden one and the survivor think "ha,he thinks I'll fall for this one?"and bam,they step on the hidden one
---
Are you fucking kidding me.
---
gg ez
---
The Red Lantern Corps Oath seems to fit the Oni better though!
---
 ***"With blood and rage of crimson red,***

---
This movie was great ngl. Didn't like how It's final form was just a clown with several extra legs but I guess it makes sense with how Bill Skarsgard was absolutely fuckin flawless through and through, and you never cover up your lead actor's face.
---
I don't think survivors should be able to attack the killer in any way. Even if its harmless.. it just make it so the game loses the sense of "fleeing for your life scared". Other than that, I like the other perks. Are in theme with the character. Specially the Photograph one
---
*This breakdown is courtesy of u/voater14.*
---
Instadowns:
---
Myers = Needs to delay the chase to stalk in order to earn the instadown. Time limited.
---
Ghostface = Needs to stalk without being spotted to earn the instadown. Time limited.
---
Leatherface = Slows down while charging, so needs to get close initially then has a limited window to pull it off. Has a massive time wasting tantrum if he hits a wall, or a lengthy cooldown if he misses.
---
Billy = Can casually walk behind a Survivor, charge it, and line it up. Has a minor cooldown if he misses or hits a wall. No slowdown, no stalking, can spam sprint the entire trial at minimal cost.
---
Mobility:
---
Spirit = Has the ability to cross the map at roughly 176% speed. Cannot see Survivors while phasing. Once arrived at her destination, needs to wait 15 seconds for power to recharge, leaving her as a 110% speed M1 killer.
---
Freddy = Can teleport to a gen, giving Survivors a lengthy heads up via blood spurting. After teleporting, goes on a long cooldown before it can be used again.
---
Demogorgon = Has to place a portal where he wants to travel, then has to place another one as an entry point. Portals can be destroyed by Survivors.
---
Hillbilly = Sprints at 230% speed across the map in seconds, leaving Survivors little time to react. Can instantly turn around and sprint back to where he came from or elsewhere. Has no cooldown.
---
So in conclusion, not only does Hillbilly have the BEST instadown and the BEST mobility, he‚Äôs the only Killer to have instadown and mobility at the same time.
---

---
Stupid Sexy Trapper
---
Wait Autodidact resets the healing progress in some percentage right? Does it count or does it also reset for the perk?
---
Wtf are those perk icons XD I love them!
---
survivors do vary. There are just as many factors that go into survivors as well, were they running meta perks? Did they escape solely because of their perks meta or non-meta otherwise? Did they escape in a SWF or solo? Did the killer just grant them mercy and give hatch? Was it a farming game? Did they loop the killer on a 5 gen chase? Were they immersed the whole time and just left with no killer interaction? Were they just face camped on first hook? Were they left to die on first hook? etc. etc.
---
I've never met a good hag that plays like the way you just described
---
As far as I know the servers are Global, at least for Console they still are since we don't have Dedicated Servers yet. I get a lot of Asian people at some hours, but it's not really that bad the ping stays remarkably low.
---
I am saying that the game is in a  way more balanced state then it used to be. The game is becoming more balanced yes, the game isn't perfect, but when people are acting like this is the same DBD that we had ~2 years ago I believe that's incorrect.
---
I am from EU and my killer queues are at day very long, and after 7 pm less then 1 minute long
---
There's always that baby survivor that's toxic don't worry about it.
---
there are 2 different types available, the type with the white inside border has cleaned up icons (idea credit to  [u/Monkeymo10](https://www.reddit.com/user/Monkeymo10/)). The type with no inside border has just the normal icons but if there is enough interest i will change them to clean icons.

The other perk pack that I am making is coming soon! :) Sneak peek [https://imgur.com/a/1orMTic](https://imgur.com/a/1orMTic)
---
Still, that's 10s too many. I don't care if it's been posted before, I got a really interesting reply from someone who did the math to calculate how long it would actually take, it was worth it just for that.
---
It‚Äôs not as simple as adding a layer of blood to whatever cosmetic. It means making an entirely separate bloody cosmetic for every existing cosmetic, which I don‚Äôt think is something they‚Äôd want to focus on
---
Why do you call her bitch? She wasn't even bming you, she just wanted some points
---
Thank you so much!!!! I hope to be good as you one day!!
---
Awesome!!
---
Billy's "bustedness" is most apparent after a rank reset. A decent Nurse could end up getting like one hook all game because she's hard to use. Even Spirits will struggle now that she's been nerfed down. Regardless of the current narrative around Spirit being pick up and win, most less-experienced players can't do that. It's a combination of them not being able to accurately predict Survivors' movements, having less confidence in using her Phase Walk, and her moving at a mere 110% speed.
---
Billy, on the other hand? If you get him at green OR red ranks, a lot of times you literally can't unhook your team fast enough. He instadowns one, zooms across the map, instadowns another, and flies back to the first hook before you‚Äôve even had a chance to unhook the first Survivor. Sure, green/yellow rank Survivors aren‚Äôt great, but neither is the person playing Hillbilly. Survivors are required to have a much higher skill level than the person playing Hillbilly.
---
Additionally, every other Killer with a 1HKO ability by default has to actually work for it, but Billy just gets it instantly. Leatherface moves at like 85% when revving, while Billy moves at 100%, which is the same speed as Survivors. If he gets to you point blank and starts revving, you're going down due to the hit box, and getting hit through vaults and pallets. Furthermore, he has 115% movement speed, but Spirit/Hag move at 110%?? Then, he gets a 230% speed boost when sprinting. So, not only is Billy the fastest Killer in the game; he's the only Killer to have insane mobility/map pressure AND the best 1HKO power, at the same time!
---
Billy simply doesn't require as much skill as he should for how effective he is. A bad Billy can do well just by picking up the controller.
---
:(
---
Nerf all killers! They are op and its not that survivors are bad or force killers to use certain tactics to counter insta popping gens.
---
The challenges are actually all extremely easy, just slow. Everyone is rushing to complete an entire challenge in 1 or 2 games and be done with the entire rift in 3 hours. 
---
25 unhooks? You get 2 to 3 per normal game, just play 15 normal games. But no, people rush the hook and kill themselves for 1 unhook. 
---
15 hooks in the basement? Play normal, just with basement perks. But no, people are playing insidious leatherface camping the basement. Hook the obsession twice? Normal game. Nope, tunnel them instantly, 3 hooks. The challenges aren't the problem, it's the people that throw the whole game to get the challenge instantly.
---
Idk about you ,but I think he is pretty balanced. Almost every game I play against a Billy I always have fun and he really does seem like the most balanced IMO.
---
Cold-Can ravioli... Ewww!  
---
Giuseppe from Fratelli's Italian Restaurant is having a violent seizure just thinking about that!
---
Being strong =/= being op. He can be looped just like everyone else if you're not a potato and get caught in the open. In fact he's even easier to loop because most billies will try to use their chainsaw on pallets wich they should not .
---
But of course, survivors will complain about eeeevery single killer that forces you to use more than 3% of your brain. A killer has to be loopable for 3 gens and can't do anything good other than being a M1 Killer otherwise he's too op nerf plz.
---
Whenever I play survivor against a billy, its jut a matter of who can play better. Its fair. He can be looped. And whenever I lose, I know it was because I made a mistake, or he played badly, and whenever I win, it's because I managed to do good. He's fun to play as, and against, because he IS balanced, strong, but not overpowered. 
---
He's meta because he is able to play the game without struggling like pretty much every other killer bellow him, wich SHOULD be standard. If he was op like you claim he would be top 1 or 2. There's a reason he's not.
---
I'm rank 7 killer, and rank 4 survivor, and killer queues are way faster than survivor queues.
---
I can get behond this.
---
Oh no its
---
*THE FEATHERED FIEND*
---
The issue is that you can't select multiple, or hell have them all be active from the start
---
I expected more from a professional arguer
---
Then you must play against potato players. Billy is currently the 2nd best Killer in the game, and the most-picked (besides Spirit). This is obviously why so many defend him. Most Killers are Billy-mains!
---
You play for fun but you‚Äôre the weirdo that makes a crying post abt your matches. I play for fun, I have fun by being chased, unlike you I don‚Äôt have fun by holding m1 on a gen.  It‚Äôs not throwing as it gives everyone time to do all gens.

Welcome to RnG

Flashlights and teamwork hard counter her at higher ranks, and on many maps she has an unforgiving setup time.
---
It feels great to play as hag when you do it well; traps in weird spots, people having to croutch too amd from hooks and gens so they move much slower, being able to counter strong loops, being in 2 places at once.
---
Against a good survivor team you can be turned into a powerless 110% killer and that shit sucks
---
Just e-mail PS Support and tell him you got problems with a spammer you can't mute. Give them a few screenshots and where you can see the spammers PS-network name and they'll sort it out.
---
You could actually add it as a visible layer on the existing cosmetics, or a shader maybe.
---
Agreed completely, for me it's just about not dissuading new players from playing the game at higher ranks.
---
Playing survivor; if I queue up into games and get some string of "potato teammates, disconnect, unhook farming teamate, face-camping bubba"
---
The game can be REALLY un-enjoyable. I'm trying to be mindful of players time and trying to learn the math behind pipping ect.
---
My way of playing gets reactions like "OMG i peed myself laughing so hard"
---
Which TO ME is what the game is about.
---
nice. Worth noting if it helps for later that you can open a door when they're powered yourself. Which then could help to trigger blood warden.

Seriously, are you guys all parrots? These are meme excuses. Billy hasn't really been touched since launch. Ask yourselves this: Do you really think BHVR would release him in his current state today?? You know the answer.
---
I get that Billy is the most popular (and easiest) Killer, and people rely on him for quick 4Ks, but seriously, he clearly needs reworking. Even just a cooldown on his chainsaw would work wonders.
---
That's good lol.
---
dude have you ever seen jane's p3, or any level of prestige? cmon lets talk about it :D
---
Bold of you to assume survivors will all co-op on gens
---
It's the "Shitty UI Pack 1.0"
---
Yeah, there seems a lot of kids play this game more than adults in my experience
---
Calm down Satan ‡≤†_‡≤†

Sadly that's not how it works

Yeah its called being at rank 20-8

Nice bait

Where's this "Billy 2.00"??

Also, I quoted someone, while giving them credit for the breakdown. The original post is my own, as well as every other response.

I literally have the same, but Adam is left out... and I main Quentin xb
---
One of many.
---
You ignore what he said, you still have to walk all the way to spread them out as slow as shit killer. In addition you have a harder time seeing survivors because of the size while they (rendering that Hag "tutorial" hint that shes great at using line of sight blockers cause smol uselss) can see your red stain from a mile away. And she cant teleport across the whole map, so whenver you are at one edge (say, to spread out your traps) and one on the other end gets activated, you are shit out of luck, and can walk back with your incredible movementspeed to replace it.
---
Guy he is probably upset he got 3k 5 genned and barely got hatch.
---
He needs a cooldown, at the very least. His chase music and hit box also need serious tweaking.
---
What would Pennywise be mimicking? If he came into the game and he mimicked being a survivor I would be pissed. First off, he never mimics an actual full-on human. Second, that power should definitely be reserved for "The Thing" if they could get the license.
---
Never thought my two favorite things would join together. Thank you for this comment.
---
Not that I know of :(
---
Nope. Unfortunately I don't think you can do anything about it. I had that happen to me once.
---
What are you on about?
---
That was game 4.
---
Freddy is op as f- now... not that the old Freddy was bad.
---
In that case yes it is.
---
Why do we fight again?
---
"If your team is shit", you're complaining about useless teammates that just farm. But its not morally correct to do the same, even better as I always run BT.  But clearly as you're new to this community you don't understand much.  "You'd have a better chance", better chance of escaping or pipping. Pipping is winning in most eyes, same on killer side. Like I 4K de-pipped yesterday on killer, whereas you most likely think a 4k is a win. Just as on survivor you can escape and de-pip, which you would see as a win? I don't care for pips in general but in a match pips and emblems show how well you played. Not so much on killer but on survivor yes.
---
&gt;She is currently in an argument with him
---
waste of time.
---
Just Report for unsportsmanlike behaviour and move on
---
Bodyblocking isn't, holding the game hostage like that is. There's sort of a gray area (due to endgame timer) but that's not typical "bodyblocking".
---
 N O
---
How many days did we get for those challenges? 70, 90? You can get almost all of them by playing like 1-2 hours a day.
---
Yes it is, it is counted as griefing.
---
send an ingame report and then send video footage to https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
Ingame report is mandatory.
---
Oh, I know. That scrotum-faced abomination is a favorite around these parts. These Billy-Bob mains will die on the Hill for their "EZ 4ks", but remain completely silent about the REAL chainsaw massacre being utterly useless.
---
So, would what he did be punishable, because it was just her and everyone else escaped but her
---
Oh god the pallet challenge... just throw every pallet when killer chases you...
---
sadly i don't have the doc on pc. i should've prefaced this with "here's all the killers i don't have" hahaha

Woah, rank 15?! Good job my man, I‚Äôm still on rank 473464247523. Good job!

---
Fucking quality meme üòÇ
---
Imahe report? Like username?
---
That‚Äôd be great.. if it was the Scream Ghostface
---
That is holding the game hostage. Survivors bodyblocking a killer is not. The killer can swing and get out. A survivor cannot. It is grieving and can be reported.
---
I would also like The Thing to be added but considering it doesn't have any real form that we know of, it wouldn't really work in the game.
---
It‚Äôs all true!
---
You know how it was before the change? When you could fast vault anything at any distance and angle? If the answer is no, you've no idea what are you talking about
---
instantly kill survivors when you hit them
---
I mean i cant get an image of him doing it but I can get him confessing he did it the entire game
---
I don't know, personally speaking I have never seen keys used all that much. Last time I saw one was during a farm match about a month ago and the people wanted to get the achievement tied to everyone escaping
---
I don't think it has a true form. I think it's more of an extraterrestrial mutation. It's never explicitly said that the Thing IS an alien, just that it arrived in an alien ship.
---
It happened to me too, I thought the Claudy in my game was legit stuck
---
That's so sad..

Demogorgon is a little bit hard to use but he‚Äôs pretty good

I played dbd mobile for a month after it came out and let me tell you it's buggy af
---
Is the survivor with the medkit intended to be dwight?
---
Yep. During that challenge I was purposefully notifying the killer of my presence so I could get chased. I would still perform proper loops around every pallet and threw them down when I had to. I also gave my teammates time to complete generators.
---
Now you usually see people throwing down pallets immediately after entering a chase. It's less efficient and essentially throws the game. It also takes longer to complete the challenge as you'd be throwing down a pallet immediately without looping it. Chances are you're going to die on hook rather quickly.
---
Bro I'm still stuck on unhooking during egc

it's not toxic if it's unintentional

You enjoy tunnel Legion fuck-your-mend gameplay but hate Hillbilly? Ok boomer.

This case is totally reportable. He didnt play how he was supposed to. He kept the game hostage which is one of reasons you can get banned for. This is the link to officially report players, but i think you need video proof to attach

---
I agree. I just feel like I'm on easy mode while playing Billy. He gets boring fast, but that doesn't stop the types of people who ran One-Man-Army, Danger Close, and Grenade Launcher in MW2 to exploit the shit out of him.
---
It figures that Billy players are also the most toxic Killers, in my experience. I've gotten a hatch from almost every other Killer, but Billy us the only one to drop me near the hatch, watch me crawl to it, then slam it on my face, before hooking me again.

It looks absolutely amazing. My favourite is Streetwise.

He is immune to aura reading. Spine chill and premonition are not aura reading perks.

I know I'm stupid excited for MoM, We're Gonna Live Forever, Breakout, and Dead Hard. Probably won't be the best build but it should be fun.

Also you can force the survivors to leave if you‚Äôre tbagging. You can‚Äôt change your fate if you‚Äôre getting camped

I'm on Xbox and I know you can do it there too its just I don't want to switch it on and off all the time for other games I play

It's a shame, the game before we both had a last second hatch escape. One of the best plays in my 150 hours of play time

Steve‚Äôs perks aren‚Äôt good, and Yui has the perk that lets you pick up dropped pallets, so I would level up Yui first.
---
Warhammer 40K gods.
---
Thank you for listening to feedback, BHVR!  This feels much more doable.  The first survivor challenge alone (just finished last night) took me probably 15+ matches to finish due to D/Cs and the fact that everyone else was trying to do the same challenge.  I was getting tired of the grind and that was making me not want to play as much in general.  Now fix level 4!
---
So TRUE
---
What makes her so good?
---
Nice Catch!
---
I wanna say Yui. The fact that you can make someone wiggle out faster from the killer is (just by being near them) is pretty amazing and she can also put pallets back in place.
---
And you wish you could choose two challenges at a time like you can with rituals. But oh well.
---
I wouldn't say his perks are garbage, but they're definitely unsupported.
---
- Luck allowing everyone to Kobe is great since it saves time, but the problem is you have to stack it so it's useless solo. I don't believe they've added in Luck helping chests, either.
---
- Open Handed is again pretty good, the issue with it being less that extended range is bad and more that the only two perks it affects are Bond and Windows of Opportunity. I mean, sure, it works with Plunderer's, but it's absolutely a waste to pair with that perk.
---
- Ace in the Hole has given me Styptics on a brown medkit before. It's pretty good.

And no, she won't ready up.
---
Perhaps maybe try on console with her? A lot harder to receive messages from other players since there‚Äôs no post game chat.
---
&gt;I refuse to believe he‚Äôs that strong at lower ranks.
---
He is, I assure you.
---
&gt;Yeah he‚Äôs a top tier survivor
---
Most people aren't on the level of streamers, and using essentially a pro-player as an example for why Billy is balanced isn't a good argument, especially with SWF.
---
&gt;but it‚Äôs not that hard to vault windows and use pallets effectively which nullifies hillbilly‚Äôs one shot ability.
---
Like hell it does! Hillbilly has hit me through pallets and vaults more times than I can count! His hit-box is busted.
---
Not really, it's not just a layer. It's physically part of that model, just throwing on a blood texture would add a lot of texture seems what would be easily noticeable, they need to physically add the blood itself on the models which would be incredibly strenuous to do.
---
"autistic zoomies" yeowch. oof. not very cash money op
---
Oh, it just takes longer to find matches for both survivor and killer now
---
F
---
Yeah I should probably do that to avoid all the shit talkers that feel the need to message me about how trash I am
---
It's Hillbilly-specific because he's the ONLY Killer who can spam a 1HKO attack, and fly across the map with NO penalty. His chase music doesn't become audible fast enough to react to him when he's sprinting in your direction, and he can hit you through pallets and vaults.
---
Usually happens when killer runs ruin :/
---
That territorial imperative had you shook lol that's a really good description thanks for the information!
---
No chases matter on both players as well as killers ability and the map. It isnt just if the killler is "good" also that is a snowball character similar to trapper you have to set up and once you're set up you profit a lot. She ends chases fast with placing traps at loops which you can use to minigame survivors or mess with their camera.
---
That tv setup though.
---
We both have gaming PCs and not consoles so isn't worth the money to switch platforms
---
Pretty sure they fixed it by making the stun instantaneous and takes priority.
---
Too hard to copypast 3 killer faces to make a decent meme
---
Alright hoss. Neither of us can see the other‚Äôs side, so I‚Äôm cutting it off here.
---
Legion has to use up a perk slot to be viable, and has a lengthy cooldown. Billy is busted right out of the box, and has basically non-existent cooldowns.
---
I mean it‚Äôs hard to pay attention to people just screaming and yelling shit.
---
Way easier to notice civil and well thought out responses.
---
OP, we need further context as to what is happening here.
---
I never bought Steve. üíÄ

It's the fact your arguments are shit lmao

I just said she may have not known DS only works once and couldn‚Äôt time the last time he was unhooked, and didn‚Äôt wanna risk him getting away. He had DS.

Haha, okay bud. I wish I could see the look on your face when you meet "old Legion."
---
I bet you uninstall immediately.
---
BET
---
He is balanced, wheter you like it or not.
---
He has great potential but he is not unfair. so even if he managd to be top 1, he would be fine.
---
All that free real-estate and not a drop of blood on his tiddies.
---
Babysurvivors are cute in the "kitty doesn't understand how to be sneaky" way whereas baby killers are cute in the "that kitten is trying to kill a bird bigger than him! Silly kitty"
---
Ace really so quiet? I dont hear any difference
---
I thought it was a bull...
---
Honestly bring it BACK
---
Yeah she looked like a burned corpse
---
Except OG Legion was powerful out of the box. He will now need a perk slot to even be viable. It's even more of a trade-off than Nurse, since she only needed specific add-ons.
---
Don't say that
---
Facts
---
No bloodlust, windows reopened, moris no longer requiring a hook, BNPs being instant. I'll pass

Ace main here. I love me some papa ace. The wacky cosmetic combos you can pull off are great. I usually run his short shorts and whatever combo of weird clothes i have from the 3 to 4 cosmetic bundles I've gotten for him.

---
I can see what you mean there, every match against doc I seem to never leave his terror radius, but he's loopable, a well timed shock can stop a pallet but the time it takes to switch between weapons makes it so the window to hit the survivor safely is only one second
---
&gt;  It is so easy to get stacks for MoM now
---
No you still have to lose time not playing seriously as survivor to get your stacks. As long as it will be the case MoM will stay at the tier of Sabotage.
---
Why? Pay attention in the lobby
---
Doctor is F tier.
---
They did it with The Legion (sort of?) in their trailer.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been playing on and off since the clown came out, but the past couple weeks I really dedicated myself to the game and I‚Äôm almost red rank.
---
Literally cant find this, they all same to me
---
Agreed. Billy's backstory is that he just loves killing - his parents, other people, farm animals, doesn't matter. 
---
Trapper might have that Khornate look down, but he resorts to traps, which is frowned down upon by Khorne.
---
If you play him you‚Äôll notice lol. He‚Äôs a mouse
---
You're one salty Billy-main lol. Don't worry, he's certainly next on the chopping block. Nurse and Spirit got toned down, and now it will be everyone's favorite tard Leatherface cosplayer.
---
*sigh* Just hit ready.. OMG WOULD YOU JUST HIT R‚Äî
---
*killer dodges*
---
Seeing as BHVR completely ignores buff requests, no.
---
What‚Äôs haunted grounds?
---
Literally console.
---
Agreed, tru3 might play both sides but he‚Äôs very biased towards the killer side of things. Scott comes across like a survivor main Hen talking about balanced while he plays more killer
---
Isn't this the one where you only have to be on a generator when it's popped?
---
Just get a four-man SWF to 99% 3 different gens for you, and after popping your own generator and running by their generators, you can get it done in just under 10 years instead!
---
It looks awesome, I‚Äôm jealous. I kind of wish PS4 had something similar :(
---
I would mind this concept but it would have to be well executed. Otherwise I don't want it to be competitive looking.
---
Just because your positioning is bad doesn‚Äôt make hillbilly‚Äôs chase music is broken. You won‚Äôt hear his chase music because he is not in a chase with you, if you get caught out in the open. Just use your mouse and look around. If you hear heartbeat(you can hear that one I hope) position yourself better so you don‚Äôt get hit. 
---
About spamming I guess you forgot you need to charge it first and if you miss you can‚Äôt immediately rev your chainsaw again. There is a small window between two chainsaws like hatchets. Hitting through window is NOT a hillbilly specific problem, it is a server and ping issue. Learn the difference first.
---
Been in queue as survivor and killer 10min and nothing.  Playing on PC
---
Get a new computer
---
Thank you!!
---
Me too. I actually play DBD on PS4 but I‚Äôm playing a different game on Xbox right now and decided to make her.
---
I got this one on the first try last night and NOED wasnt even activated lol. I had to slow down and by the time the exit gate was open, one was dead and the rest were on death hook so I downed one and opened an exit gate. Hooked her, used bbq to find one more person and hooked them
---
PS4 and no
---
I'll never understand what it'll take for players like you to stop pretending the game is still horrifically unbalanced for killer.  They've been nerfing the nutsacks off survivors for a full year and a half of balance updates now.  They've lost soooooooo mich cheese man.  What more do you need them to take away before you are finally willing to accept responsibility for the outcomes of your games?
---
If the game is truly this "unwinnable" for killers than please tell me how I was a red rank killer for years playing primarily M1 killers during a time period when survivors had so many broken mechanics at their disposal?  The game has only gotten considerably easier with each passing month of balance updates.  This false narrative that somehow after the insane string of nerfs they've received over that time that they're still these uncounterable free win machines is just absolutely absurd and honestly kind of turns my stomach.
---
*meg_scream1*
---
Fair enough, it‚Äôs never helped me very often though and I only play trapper as killer.
---
Sacrificing a perk slot to make Legion an inescapable tunnel machine is called a build, its not a sacrifice.

Two trapped Hex Totems will spawn in the Trial.
---
When one of the two trapped Hex Totems is cleansed by a Survivor, all Survivors suffer from the exposed Status Effect for 40/50/60 seconds.

The remaining trapped Hex Totem immediately becomes a Dull Totem.

Just aim at the pallet, not her face. Or pallet then face.

Second Wind is the best perk out of all of theirs.

It‚Äôd be cool if we were able to read what the paper said. Little things like that would be awesome

Am i the only one that actually enjoys going against spirit and nurse? Like every other killer in the game i dont feel the least bit of duress at all because i know how to loop but spirit and nurse i actually feel like im playing a pvp game instead of a run in a circle simulator. Theyre the only killers where there are actually mind games involved because to me a killer just moon walking isnt a mind game, its a tool that might let them close a small amount of distance on you and is 9/10 react-able anyway. Every mind game i win against those 2 i actually feel like i outplayed the other person and i know i know, yes eventually they will down you and theres no avoiding that. But thats what this game should be imo, your goal should be to waste as much of the killers time in a chase so your team can do gens, not to 1v1 the killer for the entire game. It is a 1v4 after all and with 15/17 of the killer roster you definitely do not feel like something 4x as powerful as you is chasing you as most of them can easily be 1v1 for 3+ gens. Idk maybe im crazy.

---
Because most survivors suck. Same with killers. The game is often decided by the players being bad on one side. But if you have four survivors who know how to play properly AND a killer of equal skill, the killer can't win. Sometimes you can win against very strong teams because they decide to try and go for stupid saves etc. because they value that attempt more than the win, which is cool, but doesn't mean it's not unbalanced.
---
All these nerfs to survivor just make it shitty to play solo because now you aren't strong enough anymore to completely win on your own. But again, it's not just you, and the balance isn't good because you can't win with idiots on your team. You literally cannot win as any other killer against a full team of actually good survivors. If you think that's untrue you've never played against actually really powerful teams who also don't yolo their games out of boredom or for fun.
---
Its because it used to be any m1 hit gathered stacks. No protection hits needed.
---
I only get one WGLF stack for every 10\~ protection scoring events I get, and I can actually be healing or unhooking someone (literally touching their model) and get hit and not get a protection scoring event, the amount of bodyblocks in the gate area to save someone from getting downed that give me WGLF stacks? Zero.
---
My attempts at getting MoM to work is about 1 stack every 3 games, averaging 3 hits in model proximity to other survivors a game (1 in 9 successful stacks).
---
It's frustrating.

I wish DBD had more merch, I'm waiting for the trapper nendoroid to come out
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
@engels962 this is exactly my thoughts. People do this alot. I mean I don't mind playing against it but at least I want to know.
---
Think I‚Äôll try something else first
---
Yeah, true. If he‚Äôs running unnerving presence with some good add ons, it‚Äôs impossible to not be spotted almost.
---
Don't Do that, don't give me hope
---
Like what?
---
Reddit
---
Maybe have them install Steam and then invite them to the game/have them manually join via Steam.
---
Literally anything other then spending hundreds on a new console
---
Blah blah blah "you're just bad" ad hominem, ad hominem... I'm tuning out.
---
BHVR is already listening to reason. Billy is the #1 most-played Killer, outside of Spirit. He's the go-to character for all the players who lack the skill to play Nurse or Freddy, and just want "dem EZ 4Ks". Predictably, there'd be a lot of backlash when people start calling for the character to finally be updated.
---
Clown might actually work, he kills for the thrill of it, too.
---
Story of my life
---
Bro why is there only 3 survivors there? Did the 4th die?
---
It still feels like a defensive ability. Like, you are hiding and the killer approaches your hiding place. You start to panic and in an impulse you burst out of the locker, "jump scaring" the killer. It not "attacking" the killer, it kinda feels like a defensive ability
---
It was very difficult before the changes.
---
This would be fantastic especially since in the lobby screen sometimes the character models are too close to each other or are completely standing sideways and you can tell what their bringing.
---
Weird 3K hours over 3 years but I'm that one player that somehow AWAYS got "bad" survivors.  Nope on all that time period I've never faced "good" survivors.  Do you people even listen to yourselves when you toss out that bumper sticker nonsense?  Of course I've played good survivors.
---
They haven‚Äôt changed it yet
---
Changes aren‚Äôt coming till next week
---
This also appears in Preschool next to trash cans or phone booths. It's a very old Easter egg aside from golden toolbox hidden under picnic tables or inside phone booths.
---
Just keep playing, don't feel bad for doing what you're supposed to do.
---
Ok ig
---
My statement is still correct.
---
Only with character and camera positioning it's possible. Some players suggested that Huntress would have a focus ability when charging but would be really bothersome with FOV.
---
Have you ever heard of the new killer, Oni? He dashes around the map with an instadown that's even easier to hit that Billy's? Sure he has to collect blood, but its very easy to do so, and while he is in demon form, he has no cooldown, and is pretty much impossible to get away from him. Not even pallets stop him
---
He has spoken
---
Welp, sorry mate but that's all I got.
---
It's not a phase mom!
---
I‚Äôm just damn good then
---
Philosophers, futurists and artists will meet to explore the realities of (I think this next word is **bioterrorism**). Steve Ma(**nes**? Whatever this is, it's his last name anyway), inventor of wearable computers, talks to Rebecca Caldwell about DECONference.
---
This must be an attack from an enemy stando user.
---
Oni must build up to his abilities. That's the key difference. You know what? Make Billy have to collect fuel for his chainsaw, and I'll be satisfied.
---
Well, no. You said yourself you don‚Äôt really have time to play and be in the correct rank. It‚Äôs more of rank reset bringing high rank players far too back. 
---
There‚Äôs changes to how rank reset will work on next reset (I think?) so the rank tier / color will only be reset back one. 
---
Ex: Red ranks will be purple instead of green to make players near that rank face against same or similar rank players.
---
They could put a "blood string"(like the little connections in the blood web) between the people playing together. That way killers have some time to change their load out if necessary or just dodge the match all together.
---
Or they could put a little multiplier in any lobby adding fractions of time to finish gens for each blood string. Other games have that where it's a "difficulty multiplier" based on how many people are playing together.
---
Sure, you can claim that.  There are some exceptionally difficult challenges on there.
---
Legion is really fun to play, and I do really good each time I play them. I'm likely never going to main them, but that doesn't mean thay're not good.
---
No warning...
---
Literally the entire map can hear it.
---
No one knows how to explain to you that you need to use your ears. 
---
If your slamming out a gen while hillbilly is booze cruising then he's gonna run you over, eventually.
---
Nice strawman. 
---
I didn't say you never played or won against good survivors. I'm saying you can't win against four excellent survivors if they actually play in an optimal way. Outside of four killers, you just cannot pressure enough on most maps, and if you don't slug hard just picking up and carrying to hooks makes it impossible to not lose all gens. It's just math and logic. But since you're either intellectually dishonest with that last comment or genuinely cannot think logically, I don't doubt you're disagreeing.
---
More grindy than difficult I‚Äôd say. 
---
You can do many of these challenges if you just farm a game.
---
True.  A majority of them are merely time consuming.
---
She has no counterplay, just like how survivors have no counterplay if you're any killer other than her or Nurse. Hexes are garbage against actually good teams, Pop never triggers because you literally don't have time to kick gens against the best teams. Those survivors also don't 3gen themselves. Slugging is unfun but viable, but also only on smaller maps, otherwise you don't get enough out of it.
---
If you think hex totems Pop or 3genning work against good teams, you don't think of the teams I'm thinking of.
---
Yeah, its common knowledge, you have to earn 15 in a singer Trial dude...dah. 
---
(It's a bug, lol!)
---
Uhh. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how unnerving presence gets you spotted. I think you have the perk mixed up.
---
As long as you have to intentionally get hit by the Killer to proc it, Mettle of Man ain't fixed.
---
You could just not get hit and repair a generator instead of throwing the game trying to make some gimmick perk work.
---
I've never noticed until yesterday, it would be cool if you could start a kyf lobby by yourself and explore all maps to search little cool details like those
---
If balanced landing didn't exist you would have many of the insane infinites that exist on Haddonfield and other maps. The stagger reduction effectively created a speed boost every time a survivor fell. 
---
If you think reworking several maps in the game is the way to go over number adjustments on a perk you're just plain delusional.
---
nerf*
---
It's a known bug, going to be fixed with the small update for the level 3 challenges.
---
Phasing through someone is a literal buff.
---
Depends on the time I guess. I‚Äôm EST time and usually I‚Äôd see non-NA players during mornings. I assume most NA are working / in school. The afternoons to nights is where I would be against / paired with NA players for the most part.

---
Regardless of how many iri emblems you get you will always get 1 as of right now. 
---
(As long as you actually have an iri emblem)
---
Don't worry the games toxic on all platforms. Xbox is just as bad, even though people have to go out of their way to message you directly.
---
I agree with this whole statement.
---
I hadn't played on PS4 in quite some time myself and yet didn't have any issues finding matches last night or today. Xbox was bad and PC was instant. I'm in NA.
---
It got delayed to sometime next week
---
billy moves at a speed of 92% also known as 3.82 m/s when revving but other then that this statement is very correct
---
I've found my people.
---
I see that you‚Äôve never played against or played the spirit in your lifetime. 
---
Being able to know where somebody is through collision was incredibly powerful. 
---
In any other game, it‚Äôs a buff. This game is different. It‚Äôs a nerf.
---
Correct, Survivors can push the Killer if doing specific actions like let's say it prevents them to destroy pallets. (Like any other player would troll standing next to pallet to confuse Killers)
---
You can collide through if Killer hits you for a few seconds or if you jump from height to Killer or Survivor.
---
Devs also removed collisions if someone is sabotaging cause in the old version you couldn't hook if someone was dismantling a hook.
---
Dude, can you PLEASE do the same but with the confused cat meme???
---
Or teach me your secrets so I can do it xD
---
And you can plug them in and not use batteries (Xbox one doesn‚Äôt use battery ‚Äúpacks‚Äù. The battery port thing is built into the controller instead of being removable)
---
Yeah, first when you‚Äôre in killer you make your load out and once you do that you switch to spectator there must be at least one survivor and killer. Once they both ready up and you hear the loud noise from when they ready up you switch to killer and if you do it properly it‚Äôll say connecting and the connecting to other players screen will take longer than usual
---
Collision is wack as fuck. I can see you just don‚Äôt know wtf you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
Use your ears. That‚Äôs how she‚Äôs suppose to be played. Now survivors won‚Äôt be able to tell exactly where you are.
---
Yes this. Hardest one for me was escape 10 games because killers keep lobby dodging or bringing moris üôÇ
---
Well then don‚Äôt. Plug it in for the 10 minutes left in the game and then go buy batteries
---
Queuing as survivor instantly gets me into a match but it took me about 10-15 minutes to get into a match as killer today ü§î
---
You absolutely posited that I don't play good survivors it was no strawman.  That's simply you walking back a very silly statement you said that others mindlessly parrot on this sub as well.
---
Pressure is a playstyle it doesn't rely on specific killers though some are better than others.  It's not math and logic causing your losses it's your unoptimal play and self-defeatist attitude becoming self fulfilling-prophecy as you blame game balance for the outcome of your games as a copout instead of accepting it's in your hands to turn that game into a W or an L.  I don't use balance as an excuse and that's probably because I've played through the game when it was TRULY HORRIFICALLY UMBALANCED in survivor favor.  This game is do much easier playing killer than it used to be they aren't even the same sport.
---
I'm not intellectually dishonest I'm just not a soft biased killer main who blames the game on my losses.  If I lose it was my fault.  If you lost it was your fault.  The second you start to accept that the sooner you'll be on your way to actually competing in your games.  Learn from your failures and plug the holes that definitely exist in your killer play that lead to your helpless feelings of inadequacy when facing survivors.
---
WHY WON'T YOU PEOPLE KEEP UR MOUTHS SHUT, THIS IS BENEFITTING US, THE DEVS R GONNA FIX IT!!!!!!!!
---
No, it‚Äôs actually surprisingly Tapp.
---
bruh. 
---
   
---
also cool concept.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt argue with that guy. 
---
The four killers being Nurse, Freddy, Billy, Demo? I wasn‚Äôt aware we got a fourth map pressure killer recently.
---
You'll quit before they nerf Hillbilly.
---
Wait which one is P3
---
No we cant, everyone has different opinions. Everyone won't think this.
---
Source? Or have you just gone delusional?
---
Petition to make Shorty the next survivor. His perks include ‚ÄúRUN BITCH, RUNNNNNNNNNN‚Äù and ‚Äúshe had a fat ass son, I mean it was like BANG!‚Äù
---
Boss, I hate to tell you this. If a survivor knows where you are due to collision, the spirit is getting the hit. 
---
All a spirit player needs is a good headset. Without a great headset, you can use collision in most situations. 
---
I understand you may be new to this game. However, taking away collision is a nerf. Bottom line. Anybody with your viewpoint is in the slim minority.
---
Good luck on your exams mate.
---
A lot of the new challenges are bugged
---
The console wars are dumb.
---
Sorry I forgot to mention Distressing also. Unnerving presence increases difficulty in skill checks along with Distressing where the terror radius is increased by 26%. If the doctor has good add ons with these two perks and the survivor goes into third tier madness, hitting those skill checks to Snap Out Of It causes him to see your location if you miss those skill checks. Even with ruin, I am pretty decent at hitting my great skill checks but with the doctor and his madness where the skill checks are all over the screen definitely heightens the difficulty.  Not to mention, even if you do get out of tier 3, those doctor ghosts follow you for most of the game any way which helps him get your location.
---
Battery packs for the Xbox One are a thing.
---
https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/batteries-chargers/play-and-charge-kit
---
"RUN BITCH, RUNNNNNNNNNN" (LOL) Any survivor you point at that is currently being chased gets haste status for 5 seconds. 60/55/50 second cooldown.
---
Yeah
---
Dude. You‚Äôre a douche, and don‚Äôt know wtf you‚Äôre talking about. Bottom line, who the fuck cares about minority? Sorry I‚Äôm not hive mind brainwashed like you.

You don't have to crouch, you just have to use Night Shroud.

Afaik, there's no Moscow server yet. Frankfurt and London are two EU data centers right now. If there was an announcement about additional servers, I've missed it.
---
- His chainsaw sound is static, and WAY too quite.
---
- He zooms across the map faster than his terror music.
---
- He doesn't need to run you over, when he can keep up with you while tap-revving his saw.
---
You do realize that the dedicated servers are still being worked on
---
I understand distressing makes the TR larger and so on. If you‚Äôre good at hitting skill checks, unnerving doesn‚Äôt do anything besides make you hit great skill checks. 
---
In tier 2, the Doctor illusions aren‚Äôt as strong as you think they are. You will see them a lot more than the doctor will see them. I promise that. Those things are terrible unless you‚Äôre focused in a very fixed direction.
---
Freddy might find this statement awkward.
---
Too busy scrolling through reddit to look lol, even right now
---
Can someone say what he‚Äôs saying?
---
Lol noed doesn't screw those people over, nah it's screws over those who played good and fair the whole game just for them to go down trying to save someone and then getting camped by a baby Trapper.

Sad shit like this happens to people and people should really be banned for toxic behaviour.
---
Personally, I don't give anyone shit playing as killer because it's your decisions and playability that is at fault if you fail or do something wrong, HOWEVER, if a killer camps someone on the hook (as in they stand infront of them or circle around them), they deserve a few good words.
---
Sorry to hear that your wife had a bad experience

---
Removing collision is a nerf lmao.
---
I‚Äôm gonna hold out that they‚Äôre gonna fix that up post-production. Until then I‚Äôll just keep him at 50.
---
"what is the point then?" like i said before the mori in its current state is useless for high rank killers or just any killer who wants to rank up as such I see it fair that the new mori be no different in usefulness at high ranks. I wanted the mori to be purely cosmetic seen as the mori is flawed on a conceptual level, any change that doesnt outright make it have no advantage doesnt actually solve the problem that the mori poses. On a conceptual level the mori must allow the killer to kill a survivor by thier own hand even if red mori allowed you to only kill one guy on their first hook that would still be as unfair as the old mori but simply to a lesser extent and it would  mean the mori would actually be to powerful because it would allow the killer to triple thier pressure supper early on with no counter at all and it would not cuck your devout to a significant degree. the mori was useless before so it being useless after really effect anything, but the new mori is usefull, the whole fucking point of the change is to make moris the ultimate bming tool - to make them finishers. having moris be finishers in this way is atually pretty cool it feeds into the entity allowing the killer to have some fun after hard work fantasy alot more than me me tunnel first guy and insta mori him yes.
---
"buff D-strike"
---
funny joke i am fucking dieing of laughter. The changes i wish to make to moris would mean that they would become a commodity to use on special occasions which would mean it would not exactly be the meta to use them. I want to limit the effect moris have on gameplay as much as humanly possible, allowing a finisher to bypass the most useful perk in the game would just lead to this item to be abused: my change is to make moris a finisher version of hooking a person for the third time not for them to bypass ds. So not only would this change not effect ds in the meta at all nor would it change its usual effectivness seen as you shouldnt be tunneling riiiight? it would just mean people cant abuse moris to tunnel people anymore, i mean if you have people on fucking death hook and you were confident enough to bring a rare item that would just be cosmetic why the ever living fuck would you need to tunnel. this only effects you if you tunnel and you shouldnt tunnel at high ranks anyway let alone cry that your favorite way to abuse the in game systems to play like a bastard are being fixed.
---
i am sorry i didnt express my thoughts consise enough for you to understand what i meant properly but i hope you understand now
---
Eh I just went up against the doctor with those two perks and it was the worst match ever haha. All of the survivors struggled getting out of tier 3. He also had on Huntress‚Äô Lullaby which added to the madness. I think everyone has a killer they struggle against. It‚Äôs hard to argue over it when everyone has their strong suits/weaknesses.
---
For anyone wondering that Claudette did the same to the survivor who died earlier in the match and it‚Äôs obvious the Ghostface and Claudette were working together.
---
Bet
---
have you used a mori you dont get an entire fucking rank medal
---
The entire map gets an audible warning that suggests you may want to move away from the gen you are working on.
---
I mean, do you have a SWF group? Do they put up with your incompetence?
---
Simple: make a trade deal. Allow them to farm, under the agreement that you can take 2 of them.
---
I got the trap 5 people in a single game on my first try because I just went around and put traps in random places thinking "yeah I'd probably run through here at some point since I'm a shitty survivor."
---
I know its not the killers fault shes sandbagging, but I hate when they see how obvious it is yet work with the person instead of killing the sandbagger.
---
You‚Äôre still living with your mom?
---
Nevermind, this is save, not sacrifice
---
Probably on The Game. 
---
The more you play, the more you‚Äôll see the glaring weaknesses and limits of the doctor‚Äôs kit. He‚Äôll become more of a slight annoyance than a real killer.
---
No! No, god, please no!
---
Freddy got a complete rework, not a straight buff. Nice try though.
---
I bet they don't nerf Hillbilly and you quit because you still don't know how to counter BBQ.
---
$10
---
Lol chances are mine would be over by then
---
P3 ACE GANG
---
this wont buff ds it removes moris abilities to bypass ds seen as it promotes and allows for tunneling which would cause people to complain about being tunneled and feeling powerless against it. do you like being tunneled and moried at the start of the game is that what you want but for later on in the game?
---
They aren't default though.
---
Just do bones and don't get found.
---
in what way is this false are you saying nerfing moris is wrong? the fuck?
---
Yeah, it's supposed to be on Michael.
---
Well they must be incomplete
---
More ad hominem? Tssk tssk...
---
You can stop stalking me now. We get that the hill of Hillbilly is the one you've chosen to die on. Your valor has been recognized.
---
Spirit has mobility. It's just she gets slow chases if she uses it for mobility, but she's still fairly mobile, especially with good add-ons. I don't really count Demo because it gets absolutely nothing out of the mobility, because it takes so long and is easily avoided, but I guess you could count him still. Five then.
---
You're saying the Freddy reword wasnt a buff?
---
So basically it‚Äôs a buff to ds. You literally just confirmed you want to buff ds
---
Honestly this is really sad seeing folks bombing OP's comments for trying to prove Hillbilly is not the greatest Killer out there yet he seems strong and top pick because of his actual outdated flaws. Defend this Killer all you want but players play him in a shady way. And why Hillbilly is strong at the moment because of BBQ sharing aura reading to reach from point A to point B and etc. Beforehand Hillbilly had to randomly pick a spot and reach there probably with Whispers if I remember and we was average and strong at the same time. Also, I haven't came across a Killer that uses him WITHOUT any aura reading skills and perfected 4K. My simple idea would be for him to have a short lunge like Bubba for charging the chainsaw but instead holding and releasing same way as it behaves right now only with UI showcasing hollowed way how much charge is left. The charge should be short not actually an aircraft device for drunk driving because he looks absolutely absurd as he barely has good animation for sprinting with his chainsaw. I really want some changes to Hillbilly to make him nice... although fearing devs might screw too much.
---
The 360 didn‚Äôt have rechargeable batteries included by default. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not understanding the ‚Äúwho uses battery packs in 2019 lol‚Äù meme when a lot of people do on the One.
---
I had my controller die right after rank reset as survivor, mid map, had time to go to my kitchen,  find new batteries and replace them and literally nothing had happened in game
---
Little Shop of Horrors
---
There are batteries in ps4 controllers like how do you think that your controller can hold its charge and also xbox controllers can be plugged in as well
---
They listen if the reason makes sense. They don‚Äôt take action after one post on reddit by hardheaded person. Of course you are bad if you complain about very much balanced killer. Not everyone tryhard enough to pick only high kill ratio killers or ‚Äúlow skill‚Äù killers. It is clear that you had few bad games against it and what shall you do? Come here and complain of course. 
---
The most funny part is you are the only one complaining about hillbilly and think there isa lot of people complaining about him. HAAHA. Your tick-tocks don‚Äôt mean anything or won‚Äôt scare anyone.

---
Everybody just sees his strengths, but forget he shares a weakness most killers do, it‚Äôs being looped. That‚Äôs what makes Hillbilly be strong but still a balanced killer. Tofu even has a video about Hillbilly and goes into detail about a lot of stuff on him.
---
Same here. The chibi Oni is just so frickin adorable
---
The Trapper will be the one, who will clap her ass cheeks
---
It isn't.  Cross play between PC steam and windows store is however.
---
I'm just suggesting that you play with the volume on instead of crying for a nerf.
---
Yeah, I main her and all and love her gameplay design but her visual design is kind of underwhelming. I heard that they originally wanted to give her Spirit hair but couldn't get it working back in the early stages of the game - that would have elevated her design a lot and would look really great as she bursts out if traps.
---
Survivor is dead hard adrenaline unbreakable borrowed                                                                              killer is Bbq Stbfl nurses sloppy (For all m1 killers)
---
That‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt count spirit or demo. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say mobility = normal map pressure. The spirit is able to apply map pressure due to her very quick chases. I wouldn‚Äôt say spirit, by default, has map pressure. If you use all of her power to be mobile then you lose map pressure. 
---
Legion has mobility as does wraith. But you wouldn‚Äôt count either of those.
---
If this is true, that's awesome news, i've completed all nodes except this one. It's so RNG based and it's really frustrating. on the 4th level there is even 3x safe unhook version of this...
---
Trapper's been working on that bod

This. It's an immediate flag of teaming if the killer goes along with it. Sure, it's free and easy points, but they know damn well what they're doing when they cooperate with people sandbagging.

You just get the character's default outfit (or flesh, in Demo's case) covered in blood. So, yeah, it's pointless. But it still looks cool, so, I do it.

Hey if other people are buying them, just means we get better content updates later on. Fine by me.

Or kill them and try next match?

They aren't, blame latency

No, but Surge and Survivilanescilesinance works well, too.
---
So your argument is "nothing you listed works against SWF teams". Got it. Let's balance the game geared around SWF teams and see how the playerbase falls through the floorboards, lol. You should take a trip down memory lane to October 2017 when Freddy was first introduced and stop making threads like this.

My salt while you were mocking me. Sure buddy. You do you. Friendly advice: Learn the game before make another post.

When I had the game on PC (PS4 now), I got the SAW chapter which includes the Pig Killer and Detective Tapp survivor. That DLC was pretty decent, killer was fun and easy to play while with the survivor, it was alright (I used to and still main Dwight). There are other survivors that are better, like Kate and Adam but not all DLCs are perfect
---
Good thing you were lagging hard enough to phase through her hit.
---
Imagine if they brought in the sniper from Deathgarden and her scope could read this, though.
---
Never said the liller was toxic. I play killer. I also know that you don't need a 4k to have a good game. To get mad and say it required no skill or foresight is a stretch too. They had the back up plan. Good on them and well played.

And of course you didn't disappoint with that true and tried chestnut from this sub "He's just lying since he doesn't agree with me".  I end all exchanges once they stoop to that level.  I don't lie about anything it's pathetic and doesn't do a thing for me.  I'm just not a weak player unlike you.  I watched lots of YouTube vids over the years and learned how to counter a lot of bullshit.  I'm an equal 50/50 player not biased for one side or the other which is why I know how absurd your entire post is.  Players like you won't feel in control of their games until the survivors spawn in on hooks and will continue blaming survivors for every L they take which is why you will continue to lose your games and come on here to complain about it.  Best of luck not improving and accusing people of lying on here.  Have a good one.
---
Oh my god! You countered the spirit you better take this down before everyone loses their mind.
---
It's the effect players get as legion when you hit someone with feral frenzy, or as ghostface when someone breaks you out, or Demogorgon when someone is by your portal. It is essentially just their location is given away
---
My fave is the salty squads that D/C in endgame.....
---
The game being balanced around proper teams would include plenty of upgrades to survivors that minimally benefit premades, but vastly improve solo play, so nope. But hey, you can't extrapolate information from reading, you can't actually argue against what I say so you go with the "but the playerbase" argument (which is a valid thing to consider, but completely irrelevant to the actual point as to wether the game is balanced or not), and you seemingly can't do math after an alleged three-thousand hours of gameplay. 
---
So, cheers. Maybe you wanna just stop replying with nonsense if the truth bothers you so much. I'm sure you can find an echo chamber that suits you somewhere else.
---
Come on, man. Say it, say the Freddy rework wasn't a buff. I know the troll in you wants to say it.
---
This is why we NEED Ruin to add time, skill checks, and regression to opening the gates! It's not fair that they can just, like, open it!
---
/s
---
Make it spawn a second basement and swap its secondary power to BP. Keep the Kobe slash for what little it's worth, I guess.
---
Do you know what hitboxes are?
---
The way Oni's killing, they should add a belt of tongues or spray of brain matter.
---
He drank it all.
---
This is why we need grammar. I thought she was getting defensive about people not thinking female pixels were sexy.
---
Ghostface is 3rd best killer if you don‚Äôt try to stalk the survivors. Billy is incredibly easy for me to loop and is why I don‚Äôt really play him. You must die by Leatherfaces and Clowns if you think Billy is op
---
Wait, What would failing a skill check look like on a gate? Would they just, like, get scared?
---
thankyou. As a newbie, is there a good killer dlc to buy? like the Saw chapters pig killer.
---
Cool perks but if they didn‚Äôt give Steve his bat they won‚Äôt give anyone a bat.
---
I doubt they ran adrenilin with a key for that play in mind
---
I don't understand how this can be a problem considering the xbox literally has a notification pop up that tells you when your batteries are low.
---
 It literally tells you when your batteries are getting low.  If you had that message pop up 2 or 3 times already just change them out before you play a game that cannot be paused
---
It gonna take a lot more than 1 mil to get all perks. Just hope it isn‚Äôt the last one to show up in the bloodwebs.
---
Yes cause stunning a killer with locker doors is definitely a possibly thing to do...Head On is the equivalent of attacking a killer
---
Thats two stacks my boi, we dont pass on two stacks here.

---
Majestic AF
---
That's the point. Remove Stridor interaction. She's supposed to be a mind-game characer, when she has many free mind game win passes built into her kit.
---
she manages to get the first hit, why would the second one be free?
---
Not remember me cause you want them to open the exit gates to start the collapse
---
Don‚Äôt waste time stalking his power comes from no terror radius and no red stain
---
I remember being absolutely terrified of alerting the crows.  I assumed every time a crow flew up it would provide some visual notification to the killer no matter where they were on the map.   Even with the perk that thankfully is not the case.
---
Personaly, I whenever I get Night Shroud, I crouch, because I'm harder to see. Always lean and stalk, avoid survivors looking at you (Leaning is good, because you can always stop leaning).
---
I don't know, if my tips will help you, but here you go
---
Sometimes it's better to leave a survivor that is closer to being Marked for another one, if your power has been countered. Doing so leaves the possibility of ending a chase quickly later on. But try to only do this if there is another target available.
---
You can stop acting above it, considering you are clearly also attacking people for simply stating facts (you already did, I can also be very sterile about the wording, doesn't change the meaning of the words). It's just making you look hypocritical rather than just delusional.
---
I'm not upset about swf. I play swf myself. It's completely reasonable to play with friends in general, and moreso in a game with shitty matchmaking. Solo survivor gameplay is mostly a horrid experience. The things I said also apply to just four solos who are all very good at the game, but it's a lot more easily achieved with coms, naturally.
---
By the way, two quick notes:
---
Why do I have to check friends list to get a balanced game? So, it's unbalanced? So, you agree with me, you just dodge the issue? Coolio.
---
And secondly: Why do you check the friends list if you're so good? Shouldn't matter then, right? Oof, cliche reddit player did another oopsie. Nice how you "ended all exchanges" out of a petty urge to get a condescending last word in by the way. You really are full of BS. Keep deluding yourself you're great for slapping boosted brown ranks.

Don‚Äôt even bother suggest anything to him. He is pathetic enough to complain about very balanced killer, reply everyone with same sentences and downvote anyone whose against him. Let him cry in the corner since no one agrees with him.
---
I don‚Äôt tunnel and most of the Killers I go up against don‚Äôt tunnel and most games tend to end in a 3K or 4K.
---
wow, no mercy huh
---
oh god, the cringe is realüò≠
---
Doesnt drop til Tuesday
---
Rank?
---
Or, you can just let people do whatever they want without dictating them how they should act.
---
I know I shouldnt, but I just get obsessed with this mentality. There is so much wrong with the game, yet Billy is something done right and these people that just cant learn from their mistakes try to start this NERF wagon. 
---
Its sad tbh.
---
Dude probably gets rolled by every killer, every game, but picks on poor Billy.
---
The devs already said they would never do any kind of flying killer. As cool as it is, the way that maps are designed wouldn't work with it. They would have to remake every map for it.
---
Anyway, that's how I lost my medical license
---
It is very possible to get a 3k or even 4k without needing to camp or tunnel, just depends how good you are
---
Dont you have to stalk to get no terror radius or is that just crouching?
---
Cheers, I'll probably get her.
---
I just don't know what perk to switch out with my Dwight for Better Together because I run all 3 Dwight perks and Premotion but I don't want to get rid of Premotion as I have seen a drastic change within my playstyle and success of completing the trial.
---
Is it a good idea when I can get Better Together as a teachable perk to switch it with Bond?

---
"Slight" man I'm consistently Rank 1 and I still hate that asshole.
---
I mean against an SWF thats different. Tho i dont see how this is possible when gens are done in about 30-50 sec and you will most likely hook 1-2 people in that time.
---
While sprint burst is good I don't really see it getting nerfed unless they change something else
---
Only if survivors get to see the killers addons too
---
Kate is the questest female survivor
---
I just got a "headset" with only one speaker and mic so I can hear game noises seperate from voice chat.
---
Context: I got a 3k with the last survivor who was dead on hook escaping via hatch, I was trying to be nice in the endgame chat and that's the response that I got
---
still takes a bit to get into a game from my experience but it just leads me here so no complaints.
---
Probably stealth 300 or stealth 600. Im looking to get one soon and I know turtle beach had that when I had the earforce like x64 or some crap for xbox 360 there were separate volume knobs.
---
Edit: depending on next xbox news I think the purchase for me here pretty soon will be the stealth 600. Just an FYI because its wireless and the 300 isnt.

Gonna be honest about it I'm not even going to attempt this challenge because I know I'm not going to be able to do it.

 I hate flashlights I can't use them they are absolute garbage and they do not work properly when I try to use them so I stopped trying.  This and saving 2 people during the end game collapse are going to go uncompleted and whoever made them needs to be fired.
---
You're both dumb tbh.
---
How long have you been playing for as a killer and do you play killer often
---
But then they went and made all of the challenge is incredibly tedious or damn near impossible

40 hours? 70/30 killer 70 survivor 30
---
Stop posting your bad experiences here. Leave that shit behind.
---
Downvoted for teabag
---
if u like focusing on gens i recommend u detective tapp, his perk detectives hunch shows u the auras of totems, chest and generators after u repair one, really useful for finding the next gen and start gettin more pressure on the killer, it also helps u not to 3gen yourself.
---
Luck is too niche to have any real use in my opinion, until they make it affect more than just kobeing off a hook i wouldn‚Äôt bother running it outside of a meme build. 
---
Open handed is useless by itself and even then its like you said only useful on 1 or 2 perks
---
Ace in the hole is a fun perk especially with plunderers but outside of a fun chest build i wouldnt consider running it. 
---
His perks can be fun but i would never seriously consider running it in a serious game.
---
Nope, sorry. The nearest you could get would be to gift people credit they could use to buy Auric Cells on their platform of choice.
---
[deleted]
---
The Saw DLC is good if you like playing a stealth based killer. I'm a survivor main that plays The Trapper when I do go Killer and I can't get into her or the other stealths (Michael Myers and Ghostface). That being said she is a brutal killer if played correctly!
---
It‚Äôs so dumb. Like, anything that isn‚Äôt a 4K is an unacceptable loss to him.
---
He started out crying right away about how the build isn‚Äôt optimal, and then when he actually started using it and it worked for him he changed his tune completely 
---
He also played the early game terribly. Dropping a chase with an injured survivor because they threw one pallet immediately? Bruh
---
If your GF can't handle a joke, then she might have some issues
---
I was a war hammer die hard but now I‚Äôm doubting it after I didn‚Äôt get this
---
ill take it down, im sorry, i saw other posts like this so i thought it was okay
---
He probably doesn‚Äôt play killer tbh
---
I know! I had a Smol Jake working a gen while I was on my way over and he hides behind a thin tree that covered maybe half his body. I'd already gotten my BBQ stack off him so I let him be. I hope he was proud that he could hide from me :)
---
Hmm.. not sure why you only seem to find that you get only around 1 kill without camping then. I dont mean this in a rude way but it just must be down to skill, since camping takes the least amount of skill possible. I play survivor mostly and many of my games have more than 1 kill without camping. Are you in red or purple ranks perhaps? I know a lot of killers resort to camping against those survivors
---
Tho i play nurse and sometimes do good and sometimes decent. So thats probably why. 
---
With freddy tho i do get 3k-4k very often
---
Ultimate karma
---
If you're going to pick up a DLC I'd suggest The Stranger Things bundle. Yo uh get two survivors (Steve and Nancy, both who have some pretty decent perks) and The Demigorgon. The Demigorgon teleports and can lunge attack...he's a really fun one to play!!
---
Quintin is gross
---
Neither when you enter night shroud mode you can run full speed with no terror radius that‚Äôs his best asset
---
Oh well. The killer was trolling anyway.
---
Not bad
---
And besides, the devs have said they wont do a copycat Killer.
---
Everyone should stop it.
---
This 1 kill is only if i hook every survivor once and even then there is end game where i get atleast 1-2.
---
So yeah i usually get 2 without tunneling if i only focus on 2-3 survivors.
---
otzdarva made a video about it, where he showcases it really well about the survivors sounds
---
That headline is my life summed up in two words
---
BHVR: Releases stats showing that literally every killer has a 50%+ kill rate. 
---
You: Survivors have literally no counter and killers are helpless.
---
Omg in Black Friday  I got all the survivors I was missing except Quentin too lmao
---
The flair's there for a reason.
---
Eh I still like Ruin more than Thana on plague. If everyone is injured gens take a whopping 12 seconds longer. I only really like Thana with Sloppy, but that doesn't work with plague cause the fountains instaheal.
---
I highly doubt it could be figured out for DBD but I would love an entirely separate game of The Thing. Maybe the gameplay would be similar to the game Secret Neighbor.
---
Yeah because why remove the cause of the problem rather than constantly working around it and slowly fixing the symptoms
---
Never trust a hole that large.
---
?? Maybe watch the movies before commenting he‚Äôs become human multiple times maybe you didn‚Äôt know it but he was a human in multiple scenes. They even refer to him as a mimic in Chapter 2 many times. But yeah I also hope The Thing comes into the game at some point, and I never said his power has to be becoming a survivor btw
---
1) why you use any exhaustion perk or quick vault outside of a chase anyway??? Wtf
---
2) literally true of all exhaustion perks 
---
Good god
---
Thank you, I can't believe people are still angry about it
---
...you can‚Äôt choose to SB the exact same way you can‚Äôt choose to Lithe
---
You are on another planet
---
The irony
---
Yeah like that wasn't a problem
---
this is one of the best things ive seen
---
Not at all. Vaults with long drops, vaults that lead to enclosed portions of the map (The Game has a good number of these) and pallets that are very short loops. All of these effectively waste Lithe, but it is map dependent.
---
Dropped a chase with an injured survivor  because they threw one pallet...and got 3 kills because of it. So was it bad play?
---
You can only get one every 20 seconds and BT hits don‚Äôt count, but idk if felt perfect to me yesterday. Worked as intended but I‚Äôm guessing it was just a lucky first game with MOM
---
Ruin, Haunted Grounds, STBFL, BBQ.
---
Ruin is self-explanatory, Haunted Grounds protects Ruin and helps you get hooks early to slow the game down as well, STBFL because he can avoid losing stacks as well as sticking to chases much better with STBFL and Shred. BBQ because is also allows you to travel throughout the map to unactivated portals without the survivors knowing you are there.
---
You need to learn how to use Shred and Portals properly though, perks alone won¬¥t help.
---
there is a difference between Batteries and accumulators you know
---
1) Sometimes it's necessary? How often do you play the game? Sometimes Lithe or BL is the only thing keeping someone from dying on hook. That's the whole reason they made Lithe work on any vault, not just in chase.
---
2) What? Please tell me how a Killer can force Dead Hard or Balanced. Sprint Burst is a bit different, since it is tied to the main form of movement for survivors.
---
Now that you say that I do remember the "kiss me fat boy" scene in tbe original. What I was saying was that he doesn't really turn into actual living humans much. I know you didn't specifically say that would be his power, I did say "if."
---
Care to explain? From where I'm standing you just look like a dense idiot who cant understand very simple concepts.
---
oh!! these are so pretty
---
As a Hag main, I agree.
---
Im just saying why people are complaining about the protection hits not whether its correct or not.
---
Also hides your scratch marks for 10 seconds which I find a lot of use out of. Being Poised into the game as well and have a full 80 secs of running with no scratch Marks
---
I'm sorry, who are these?
---
spoiler alert the butter's spoiled
---
I thought mother/daughter ring was the busted iridescent add on.
---
Alright fair enough
---
I feel like his real power is his ability to turn off his terror radius and his crouch. The stalking it just something you can take advantage of if the opportunity shows itself.
---
I wouldn't waste too much time sneaking around and taking the long way just to get your stalk because they might see you anyway. I would use sloppy butcher and maybe nurses calling. If you see the chance to stalk someone then do it to 99% and get close then finish the 1%. If they survivor is injured then 99% stalk them and leave them, unless they are on a gen and you need to stop their progress. But if they are just running around or healing then leave them at 99% until they get healed, then next time you see them pop the 1% and insta down them.
---
what's to stop somebody holding the game hostage if the egc doesn't start?
---
Yeah, the coin flips against spirit are so interactive and fun ‚Äùmind games‚Äù.

---
Daaaaaaa you want to mess wit me. I spit hot fire while im crushing these beats.
---
‚ÄúUseless in a chase‚Äù lol
---
How would that hold the game hostage? The egc should still start as soon as the exit gate is powered up, but it shouldn‚Äôt start before then since all 5 gens were completed
---
I love it when people say "but I only use this exhaustion perk because of it's effect that works while exhausted". Like, don't you see a slight issue with that....
---
Understandable however, finding gens and chests ain't a problem for me. Finding totems, that's a fair point.
---
I do remember having Tapp on PC and really liking him. Need to check him out.
---
Cheers for the recommendation
---
There's no difference between Red Rank survivors and Rank 20 survivors.  Red Ranks are just as immersed. lol.
---
Maybe i'm taking the piss, but eh -- I was playing a game in the Green ranks and kept trying to mind game the survivors.  Was told "Stop trying to mindgame them, they are just running, they aren't trying to do anything fancy.  The only one you are mindgaming is yourself, idiot."
---
I'm still having problems with saving 2 ppl during egc, is it just me?
---
So all the survivor would have to do is... not power the gates, and then wait until the killer is forced to DC because the game will never end.
---
Yeah if you can‚Äôt recognize some of those well known gods I‚Äôd definitely be critical of your die hard status lmao.

I don‚Äôt think they need to be rewarded for 3k, the 3k is their reward. It penalizes the last survivor who managed to stay alive and finish the last gens
---
I did that yesterday
---
*laughs in Dead Hard*
---
I honestly don't think that it too grindy for the # of days in the battle pass but my problem is more so with the battle pass content itself. I have finished tome 1 and 2, started on 3 and have already hit lvl 50 in the rift unlocking all of the putrid serums. I will probably end up maxing out to 70 but even then I'm not buying cells to cash in on the pass, as I really feel the rewards are lackluster. I think the real shining star in this event were all the blighted cosmetics and it's a shame they don't allow you to unlock 30 more serum between lvls 50-70. Would make doing these challenges actually rewarding for me, rather than just blood points. And man choosing just 6 of those killer pieces was tough but what I went with was the clown face and weapon, spirit weapon, billy face and weapon, and trapper bod. Cmon bhvr give the free rewards SOMETHING more at the high lvl other than fuckng charms lol.
---
I think they are saying if you have Sprint Burst, you can't choose to run at a regular speed at any time if you are not exhausted.
---
Hooks are great pressure but they aren't the only pressure you need. If the survivor kept Tru3 going for long enough then the gens would have had a ton of progress on them by the time he caught the survivor and that will snowball into a loss. Leaving an injured person to heal is fine so long as you start pressuring other survivors.
---
To use your bullet points:
---
A) Adrenaline would already have activated once you finished the last gen before hatch was closed. It wouldn‚Äôt take away the exit gates being powered and egc starting if less than 5 gens done.
---
B) With more time than the egc gives you, you can be stealthy about how you open the doors and if you open one a little before going to the other and opening that one. The egc gives almost no time to be smart about it
---
Also he's a bitch. I'll take Ritchie tyvm
---
Steve tho
---
I'd like it so it could motivate me to grind games for rift progress tbh lol
---
I can see the tiger but I don‚Äôt see where you see Jesus at all
---
Bitch, me too, tf
---
Mettle of Man is a perfect example, but the perk was a bit overkill. The best fix would be to increase the amount of hits you need to take, but instead they changed the perk as to where you need to basically throw the game to activate it. And as to killers, the only reason many people call for nerfs is because it‚Äôs literally broken, like MoM was. The Oni has way too much control with Demon Dash, and that should be fixed.
---
I'm not the other commenter but uh
---
2. The killer can just wait until the survivor Dead Hards to go in for the hit. I personally have made people who obviously have Balanced Landing waste it by going just close enough to them to make them drop down and then I left them to go do something else, effectively wasting their Balanced Landing.
---
Xbox gang here üòä
---
There‚Äôs nothing to stop them from holding the game hostage before they open the gates anyways so I don‚Äôt see your argument here
---
Okay on a side note who‚Äôs a killer main and who‚Äôs a survivor main?
---
Someone call the repost police

It‚Äôs all good! I just wish people would actually link to the original post. Memes are meant to be shared around! I just wish people wouldn‚Äôt steal the same punchline and literally the same text box, only changing the image. I have to grudges against you lol. Just please if possible link to the original post where you got it from. You wouldn‚Äôt steal art and take credit so we shouldn‚Äôt steal a meme and take credit for it as well :/
---
Thank you though for your response that‚Äôs very kind
---
Jesus fucking christ, WHY ANNOUNCE IT IF YOU STILL NEED TO TEST IT?

LIKE AT THIS POINT DON'T EVEN GIVE US A DATE JUST TELL US YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AND IMPLEMENT IT "SOON"

No this is the current one

Thank God. Me and the wife are tearing our hair out trying to do the current ones...
---
You must have 0 life if you're stalking strangers on the internet. I pity you.
---
BLOCKED.
---
But how is that any different than when only two people are left anyways? That‚Äôs how the gameplay is
---
Dunno, on a gen it‚Äòs because something goes wrong with the electronics, but the gate-switch? And they can‚Äòt add skillchecks for that, skill checks are required for something what is hard to do or needs skill to do... like repairing a gen or healing someone. That‚Äòs why there aren‚Äòt skillchecks for opening exit gates or cleasing totems. It won‚Äòt require skill to rub something or pull a switch.
---
FOOL, that only works if you're injured
---
I agree with what you say sometimes, but there are kinder ways to say what you want to. This is an observation on your responses in many topics, not just here. If you have a point to make, there's no reason to be antagonistic.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy playing immersed, but I couldn‚Äôt see myself using Steve‚Äôs perks like I could Yui‚Äôs. 
---
Thanks for the response :D
---
i wish somebody would rip the texture file so we can see it more clearly
---
Good job, man!
---
Somebody hasn‚Äôt watched his latest videos
---
I take it this wasn't PC version? Would say if I ever come across her I'll be sure to slug and camp her for ya.
---
It's still a game in which each side has a limited array of options, some of which counter other tactics and characters to various degrees. The biggest difference would be perks, which have chaos similar to Create a Characters with custom movesets.
---
Some base powers are just bad, though. At the absolute least, you can tier the Killers statistically. Wraith is compromised by his decloak time and obviousness when phased, as well as having no chase. Even if he can have a good game at red ranks by lucking out with perk matchups, he's going to be consistently outperformed by someone like Freddy. So Wraith may not be globally bad, but he will be globally worse than many other Killers when played at the same skill level.
---
I disagree that its a coin flip but even so id rather a coin flip than something completely unmindgameable like godloops anyday.
---
Yeah you 50/50 guessed and got lucky, this is the best counter for this killer, have fun BTW!!!
---
Always nice seeing another Jane main
---
I‚Äòm a 50/50 player, and when I play killer, people like this (sandbaggers) die first!
---
Still grinding through them. :(
---
Debatable top three at this point. Nurse, Spirit, Freddy, Ghostface I'd argue are all better on the whole. Demogorgon and Legion both are top tier in experienced hands. Billy can still be looped more easily than these others.
---
If lithe or BL is the only thing to save the dying person on hook you already fucked up.  
---
struggle phase lasts an entire minute. Plan accordingly.

---
"Strong" is code for overtuned. Billy is stuck in 2016. He would never be released now in his current state.
---
Actually....
---
*starts applying mud all over* not again
---
I like that idea
---
If you think weak lies like that will deceive everyone you‚Äôre sadly mistaken
---
Im about to downrank and shred this guy with Billy the rest of the weekend. Who's in?
---
Yeah but hes not just strong he is too strong. Once you get good with billy it's too easy to wreck especially against non swfs and just plain out bad swfs.
---
Ah yes, just walk in a chase.
---
You don't need to camp or tunnel to secure kills or a 4k. That actually gives the other three Survivors a much easier time rushing the gens. You can sabotage gens and chase others while someone's hooked. When someone's hooked that's two less people working on gens since at least one person will try to save the one on the hook. Maybe even all three will. You never know what'll go down. It shouldn't matter if you win or loose. I'm happy securing one kill as a Killer and I don't care that much about dying as a Survivor if I feel like I got a decent amount of playtime in the match and that is to say not being tunnelled and camp which renders you unable to do much of anything.
---
Try disarming a trap. If the killer whacks you, DH across and jump in the hatch while he‚Äôs still wiping his weapon. ezpz
---
http://imgur.com/a/JHzlc0a
---
This is from BHVR themselves. It's the most recent one I could find. Billy is top-tier, and has been that way since launch. Newer Killers have toppled every vanilla Killer's pick-rate, except Billy. The consistency and popularity is evident.
---
Unless you're at rank 17

Indeed

You mean like he did when he decided for some absurd reason to chase an uninjured Jake around the stack of cars after kicking the gen instead of going after the injured Kate much closer who was also near the 3 gen?

That huge mistake didn‚Äôt affect his 3k at all so I highly doubt ending that early chase would have

the meme to disguise the cry
---
I've been playimg this so much i can guess the rank of killers i play against almost 80% of the time . Based of who they are and perks that get shown. Im bouncing back and forth between red and purple rank survivor and usually camping and tunneling happens in high green rank and up. Low green rank is usally a wanna be try hard trapper/freddy/spirit/demi/ghostface/Myers and maybe billy (slug for the 4k) 
---
Purple *to* red usally are spirit/ghostface/freddy/boopthesnoot/Myers and maybe a really good glow in the dark legion that i so happen to run into alot.
---
You shouldnt have to camp tho for a 3k though. Or 4 in high green. Gen rushing isn't......survivors with sometimes little to no items finishing gens b4 u hook your second person. Thats just u *not trying* to run ruin and/or discordance. If u see items in pregame on everyone And u suspect swf. Run bbq if you're not very good at finding or franklins to stop the "gen rush" all together. As a survivor that plays swf i expect that too especially when the killer unreadys for a sec. Who else can u play as. Not gonna lie u maybe want to try spirit b4 this patch comes through on console if thats what your playing on
---
Hey buddy you know pallet loops and windows use them the hardest counter to billy.
---
This is like your 18th post saying the same thing across different meme formats. It will never become true and you are batshit
---
If you're gonna die, might as well look fly for the picture
---
Also the fact this is upvoted is a huge indictment of this forum and massive evidence it is not killer biased like survivor mains pretend
---
I had to read up on Michael to figure out why he just kept on staring at me. O_o
---
I cheesed this one. Had noed, carrying perks, and blood warden. Got a 3k with the EGC timer because they stayed until I popped blood warden on them and they were trapped
---
Same with me. His perks are meh and his looks are eww
---
Snapshot is so useless but the BM potential is monstrous, I love it.
---
You said elsewhere that Dead Rising is all about completing objectives and taking photos to level up, which I think is really appropriate for the character. Its even reflected in his UMvC3 gameplay. While this perk set reflects the idea from a bigger picture, I think something that would allow the perks to grow in strength over time would be much better. Think of something like Autodidact, thats more what I would envision for Frank West.
---
Snapshot could instead gain tokens for each object of interest you take a picture of and increasing something related to that objective (the more totems you've taken a picture of the faster you break them, the more gens you've taken a picture of the larger the success areas of skillchecks, successfully taking pictures of the killer giving you a small amount of haste in chases (up to 3%), the more hooks you've taken a picture of the longer your stages last with a hard cap of 15 seconds or so). Maybe make it so you can only get tokens for one subject at a time, you could even add in the DR photo subjects here (Killer = Brutality, Totems/Gens = Drama, Hooks = Horror, etc).
---
Improvisation could instead be made into a perk that increases stun duration of pallet drops. Each pallet you drop in a chase gives you a token up to 4, each token increases stun duration by 0.25 seconds. Your tokens are lost upon breaking chase.
---
Wars Covered could instead be made into a perk that gives you tokens per chases successfully broken, at a cap of 4. Upon powering the exit gates you get a haste effect equal to the number of tokens you've acquired, the effect is also applied to survivors within 12 meters of you but at half strength.
---
I will upvote any and all Scrubs memes
---
Especially right now with the sale, i bought 4 new killers and I absolutely NEED bloodpoints.
---
I can definitely relate to this and I appreciate this post. It can be easy to get caught up in how competitive people can get in this game. I‚Äôve found that breaking from my normal perk loadout and trying new builds is not always successful in escaping, but it is refreshing to play in new ways. 
---
My sister and I recently tried a Sabo build, with Unbreakable, Flip Flop, and Boil Over. We eventually were wiped but dang, was it fun while it lasted. We also occasionally ‚Äúadopt‚Äù baby survivors and play just trying to make sure they have a fun time.
---
I generally find a game ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù if I get good points and generally enjoy the match. As soon as you start focusing on pips, it becomes less fun. I usually sit in red ranks and although mixing up my play style has left me in the purples, I am having way more fun.
---
Exactly. This isn't a Killer main vs Survivor main debate.
---
It's just about balance.
---
That's what I thought tooo
---
Except in my ridiculously long amount of playtime, which involved getting literally every trophy for the game, I've found Lithe to be the weakest exhaustion perk. Is it bad? _No._ I never said it was bad. It's fine, it's just niche. This would make it a favorable pick over, say, Sprint Burst. As it is now the best exhaustion perk is Head On, just for the swag alone.
---
It sound like me but I don‚Äôt run infectious was it on pale rose where the dc happened it also might of been my friend he runs the same build as you mentioned
---
Rusty shackle, mint rag, all hex perk hag ftw
---
I was howling at cbt
---
You know what's not a variable? Billy's position on all the charts.
---
But hey, we can pretend the numbers mean nothing.
---
I thought they changed the challenges? Made them a little easier?
---
I was with you until you said lets make them uninstall..... 
---
Not a big fan of purposely trying to lower the playerbase
---
In my most recent game, I stalked a guy from Tier I to nearly III while he was working on a gen, looking between two trees on Ormond. I don't know how many times I hit III that match, but it was at least IV. Never had such a good Myers game.
---
me just add more traps, cant deadhard thru 5 traps
---
LOL #BillyGang
---
If the killer hits you while running to the hook you transform into a pile of wood and teleport to another random location xD
---
Guessing you didnt read the new matchmaking settings...
---
GO GIT EM
---
Delete this faster than my hopes and dreams
---
Wraith with silenced bell and his other ultra rare addon.
---
No problem man. Tbh I would probably switch premonition for spine chill as I think spine chill is more effective in a immersed build. In my opinion switch out bond for better together as it is more beneficial to your teammates than bond is, and will reveal the other survivors locations to you if one of them is knocked, so that is I believe more helpful.
---
THEN DOWN EM SO HARD THEY BECOME A BILLY MAIN
---
Im Not sure if i get it right, but the name of the challenge is ‚Äúblindsided‚Äù, which is what Spirit do to survivors all the time. 
---
Spirit be like ‚ÄúWaohwaowah! tables are turned now, bitches ‚Äú
---
Liverpool top of the league get innnn
---
Lizard thing god thing no match for mighty-great hornet Rat, yes-yes
---
I mean, normal people can draw sick pictures too but not ALL normal people can.
---
In other news, I tried playing Bill yesterday and OH MY GOD HE'S SO LOUD
---
No man, get the fuck outta there. He is stalking you to tier III!
---
First off yes a killer is balanced or weak when their main counter is looping. Also hit boxes are not bad latency is. Hillbilly get destroyed at high ranks when the team is Competent.
---
Billy players should get a good chuckle from this. Read the OP‚Äôs comments https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e3wvcw/they_hated_jesus_because_he_told_the_truth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
And I thought a p3 claudette was hard to notice
---
Gonna do that
---
Trapped the basement chest successfully
---
Another issue would be Flip Flop. It is by no means a common survivor perk, but the only strength it really has is that killers don‚Äôt expect it or know they have it so think they can get further than they actually can.
---
As a big Unbreakable fan, I like to throw it on once in a blue moon for shiggles but a change like this would make it even more useless.
---
Did you see his other post? Dude‚Äôs stubborn enough to create another post instead of getting better at the game. Unbelievable.

Ha, I would‚Äôve turned on that Claudette so quickly during endgame. Make them feel stupid for trusting an actual **manic**
---
One of your previous posts was a repost that got called out by the op
---
He‚Äôs balances
---
I upvoted because part of me feels like he definitely wouldn't fly being a new killer but I guess Oni will prove me wrong or right in enough time.
---
I recently picked up Billy and play near purple ranks due to the reset and playing more survivor. He absolutely crushes survivors that are too cocky or don't know what they're doing but otherwise he is very counterable.
---
I've been playing him without Ruin and honestly had to slap Corrupt on because good survivors will slam out gens. And once they know it's Billy, they will simply glue themselves to structures that forces him to become a M1 killer, wasting his time and value.
---
Of course, once you know this as Billy, you simply have to pick the right chases and really think about hook spots and keep up pressure.
---
I'd say he's perfect for higher ranked players as far as balance goes and I only hate him as a survivor because I feel none of my random teammates last long against him including me üôÅ
---
I had 3 matches in a row this morning where 3 of the survivors were carrying flashlights.
---
Me when I hear Oni roar
---
When healthy, playing against Spirit is a mind-game town and it's fun
---
When injured, it's "let's hope you're on the right side of the window" and you don't even have a 50% chance of surviving, as there's a point where you can be hit from both sides
---
Lithe is more than fine. It's got tons of builds (like my fav, lithe, fixated, quick and quiet, and dance with me). It might be useless put of the chase, but at the same time, so is deadhaed, head on, and pretty much every exhaustion perk. It's fine.
---
Ty! And Oni still hasn't come to console, so we'll see how he plays. The fact that he has to level up his abilities by collecting blood is definitely a good thing. But yeah, I like to mostly play solo, and Billys tend to wipe my team quickly. I've won against him, make no mistake, but it always feels like a monumental accomplishment. I feel like I've escaped more Spirits than Billys.
---
Dead hard sorry for terrible spelling
---
Calling for nerfs before he even hits the live server is overkill. plus I can say the exact same thing for Billy, and he has no CD
---
Remember Freddy? Good.. then let's wait instead of judging him from potatoes on ptb
---
The problem is that sacrificing vaulting in a chase for the SB isnt worth it.
---
I think anybody with a brain will laugh at that guy‚Äôs post.
---
Nice looking meme! I'm going to add stuff from the background though, not just add the face

not using noed?! &gt;;C
---
Yesss, being high rank gives nothing at all too
---
shes really silent, about 95% of her painful grunts are, theres just that one short burst where shes loud.
---
It's easier to see in the board in the basements in badam preschool (not the boiler room)
---
Congrats! You figured out the survivor role way better then most of survivor mains and even a majority of red rankers.
---
Have fun in the fog brother. Glad you are enjoying both sides now.
---
That is only if the distortion uptime and poised uptime don‚Äôt overlap
---
Just like you can walk up to somebody and press a button as a killer and get a "free down"?
---
I'll see if I have a picture
---
In a match earlier there was a Feng who was being so annoying the entire match. It was pretty satisfying taking her to the escape hatch and shutting it before picking her up again to hook her. 
---
Normally if I play a good match and get a 3k I'll take the last survivor to the hatch and let them leave. These Feng survivors love to antagonize me the entire match and all that common courtesy goes out the window.
---
Ye ye yeah! Gamer tag?
---
Devs hide one on every dlc map. They get insanely hidden, Hawkins lab one is in a box that doesnt open until egc starts.

H to the I to the V

There's a lot I could say, but I'll just say he starts the game out getting 360'd. . .
---
As far as terror instilling killers go a raptor definitiely fits the vibe
---
? Are you talking about noed? Noed is busted, I‚Äôm not arguing that, so are moris, I‚Äôm just saying that keys aren‚Äôt alright either
---
At that point it seems reasonable that killer should be able to whack a gate and start the endgame. I honestly don't know if that's the case now, but I know for sure you can't whack a gate if the other gate has been more tenderly opened.
---
She ain‚Äôt even thicc. She‚Äôs doing that stupid trick where you bend your pelvis backwards to give off that illusion.

Im on either the chucky or raptor train.

I died at the give him a gun and cbt
---
Ace is the most silent because he breaths in pain instead of screaming. I mean, he is the "realest" because people in real life do that when they are suffering instead of screaming (especially if they know someone is going to kill them).
---
If you run that kind of build you‚Äôre not getting five gens done.
---
I need to pay attention to the tomes more, I've been getting iridescent emblems all morning with The Legion smh.
---
I want x4 bloodpoints then I could prestige everyone faster.
---
This was literally my game last night lol killed 2 and had to wait for them to finish the last 4 gens
---
Best build hands down is running level 1 Ace (üòç) with Ace in the Hole exclusively
---
You win. No comment can beat this.
---
Of course great movie but I find that dinosaurs in video games can never be scary it always comes off as funny its just a fact about dinos 
---
While in real life yes they would be terrifying games can't do that with them which I find is very interesting
---
Yeah, I think the frustrations some people will have with Oni are going to be very similar to Billy's playstyle but they won't make the connection because they rarely see Billy or are convinced he's fair.
---
I honestly see Oni being a great killer but being countered by the very thing Plague, another killer with potential to be crazy powerful, and that's stealth.
---
I know it's not a playstyle promoted on this sub, but it is extremely effective against many killers and I think Oni will be no exception. He gains his power really slow if he doesn't find no one and can only traverse fast once he gets it.
---
If they survivors hide it out, he'll have to wait for the power again. Not saying every game will be like this and I'm not saying he's not loopable but I do think stealthier playstyles will be his weakness.
---
The only issue with that is some people find it boring or ineffective because random survivors will take it too far and get nothing done at all.
---
Platform: PS4
---
Bug type: Archive challenge progression
---
The "Iridescent Age" challenge only goes up by 1 point, even if you get multiple iridescent badges in a single match.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/25mOhXY](https://imgur.com/a/25mOhXY)
---
What does the progression with the incandescent challenges mean.
---
Tome 2 challenges were broken and by broken I mean they stacked up if someone else had the same challenge as you activated. Deplete med kits we did in 2 matches. You didnt even need to play killer if the killer was running the kill X amount of survivors challenge. All you needed to do was activate that and hope you got a killer doing it and if they had it active you got the credit for survivor kills while playing survivor. Your own death counted towards it. I  did the self care challenge and forgot I even had it because I never use selfish care. That's how people die on hooks and gens never get done. Someone else was selfish caring and I still got credit towards it.
---
So what I'm saying here is this. Has anyone tried running that same iridescent challenge when someone else was to see if you get the credit towards your challenge to make this less grindy?
---
This meme is a couple years late üòÇ
---
Can‚Äôt lol.
---
But they‚Äôre constantly like this unfortunately. Their replies are super toxic and are constantly arguing with someone
---
Silent bell and the ghost soot, not double ultrarare.
---
Trying to not apply pressure to massive maps and get into chases/hook all the survivors, when it just makes me lose gens too quick and I'm lucky to kill 1 or 2 people if they're decent
---
I just have fun playing that way because it's how I got used to playing Billy/Nurse back in the day, but now it's like i have to just pick close gens and focus a bit more on proxying a survivor, but even that's annoying when a DS or BT can just ruin all your pressure. 
---
Just overall not a fun experience playing killer at red ranks so I just play survivor these days. I wish I could not care when I play killer like I do when I play survivor. Idk why I can't, maybe it's the 1v4 aspect.
---
If you are curious, when he dced they had already done one generator, i was playing The Plague, and he was playing Nea.  
---
I get that people rage leave when they get downed "early" but why would you then wait for the entire game to talk shit in chat? If you are gunna wait to complain in chat why not just play the game...
---
Gee sounds like TydeTyme
---
I have adrenaline Idk what this convo is about though :l
---
Would be too goofy imo
---
So myers is not imune to spine chill anymore? Damm
---
How the fuck did you go an entire game without hooking someone.
---
My answer to this is Sloppy. You can commit to a hit, break some pallets, then leave the survivor to self-care (which takes ages with Sloppy) or find another survivor, which will take just as much time.
---
Although, I was told recently Sloppy only adds 5 seconds to a regular heal(?)
---
Everybody needs a second chance.
---
I'd really rather have chucky. The devs talked about about it in the AMA and they acted like they had no idea on how they would let them out survivors on the hook which is nonsense.
---
Both tbh
---
Shit dude I think you triggered the meme police

What? The implication of their comment is that they hooked someone
---
With how many perks there are in the game I think it would be a good idea. If you own every killer/survivor it's a fucking nightmare, and it's why I have most shit to P3, because I usually get total garbage in my bloodwebs so I just say, ah fuck it.
---
Yes they are because the survivors emblem system is completely fucked the game rewards survivors who rush. Which leads to survivors sucking ass in chase. Majority or red rank surivors are garbage and I‚Äôve been playing this game for 3 years on average only 10% of players I go against know how to loop and the other 90% sit on pallets or hide. This game needs to focus on teaching survivors on how to loop. Not the community.
---
It works against him now, all it blocks is aura perks, like object of obsession.
---
You want a piece of my heart
---
My biggest problem with playing killer is the generator repair speeds. I can play a match where the survivors suck at looping and nearly every chase doesn‚Äôt even last long at all, yet the generators will still pop lighting fast, even with ruin still up. I shouldn‚Äôt have to leave a chase where I can get a very easy down to patrol generators because they‚Äôre just that fast. Sometimes it feels like the only way to win with killer is to patrol hooks and take advantage of altruism so you have a chance to snowball.
---
Its been half a year now and still no patch, wtf BHVR
---
No I‚Äôm saying killers that can get looped are weaker than those who can‚Äôt plus it all comes down to map pressure because the devs haven‚Äôt touched gens in who knows how long.
---
I too get absolutely destroyed when I run Plague but I personally think it takes way too long to fully infect someone with no add ons. I spend the whole game just trying to get survivors in a broken state for the daily and I'll lose 2 gens before my first hook.
---
If I ever see something like that, I will f*ck up the toxic ones, and let the non-toxic ones live.
---
I decided I wanted to try nurse recently, and I was, obviously, struggling a lot. However, it was only a 3 on 1. I was expecting the claudette to come back, but she never did. After I realized she wasn't coming back to the game, I went and killed her, and let the remaining survivors escape. God I hate those kinds of people.
---
Sorry, there is grind in any battle pass, yes, however devs set the amount of grind. They made it too grindy. We would like them to make it less grindy.
---
Yes and the implication of the comment is that they failed to hook that person, hence how the fuck do you go the entire game without hooking someone, not anyone dipshit.
---
This has happened to me maybe two or three times, but it only happened to me when i was at the low ranks.
---
Why is Kate sitting on David's lap
---
When do the changes go live?

One gen left, killer with low mobility camping hatch, proably a gen that you can safely finish. bEtTeR sIt In A lOcKeR fOr TwO mInUtEs.
---
That usually won‚Äôt happen unless they have Bitter MurMur but yeah true
---
Deliverance doesn‚Äôt activate unless you unhook someone. They didn‚Äôt even use deliverance in the game which made me realize that ds (anti tunnel perk btw) activates if you unhook yourself. Exclude yourself from the discussion spaz.

People who think you need to rework a bunch of maps instead of nerfing one perk need to rethink their life decisions
---
Obviously wait 60 seconds while they crawl out of gate. Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
---
Dammit I have the same as steve
---
You think you hate it now but wait until you actually go against survivors that work through it or find it in 2 seconds. 
---
Not to mention a survivor can go 15-30 seconds without getting a skill check so sometimes they don't even need to worry about it at all.
---
I too hate Ruin and have been trying to get away from it.
---
You are correct in your second point. And just who has the most map pressure in the game? ü§îü§ó
---
Why did you hook them so close to the gate?
---
Or you lose the totem in under a minute and you now just have 3 perks
---
Hello fellow ESFP. Also Steve is best boi.

As of right now billy I‚Äôll give you that but it does nothing when you can‚Äôt down surivors looping around a jungle gym or loops in general he‚Äôs balanced and your low rank ass is not going to get him nerfed when majority of the community agrees he‚Äôs balanced
---
I fixate on one aspect of the game too much, I either over protect my totems or try too hard to protect one gen or force a three gen setup.
---
The controllers can be charged in the exact same ways and you dont even need batteries in the controller if it is plugged in to play
---
Oh it's gonna happen. That's coming next.
---
Should have just hooked them at broken/occupied hooks or used agitation. Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
---
Didnt even think about that, would be cool to see an animation where he climbs up onto the hook or something
---
Yup
---
what does "become more aerodynamic" mean exactly?
---
You've got *some* nerve. I love it.
---
I know how to make a heart shape with paper, would guys want to see Empathy but with my hands? xD
---
Y'all been watching too much land before time
---
Just wait until the rework.
---
Um...okay
---
No shit sherlock, you failed to hook someone until endgame which then gave them the chance to unhook themselves.
---
To be fair, if you haven't hooked a person the whole game and they use deliverance they deserve to escape.
---
They delayed the hot fix for it, it‚Äôll be like that for another week ;/
---
That looks awesome
---
I didn't realize it was the same guy lol, thanks for pointing that out
---
.....ok
---
I still dont understand why the devs couldnt release the simple bugfix for this. Like yeah you want to have more time to balance the rift, but cmon why do you have to delay the fix for this one challenge?
---
If your at a point in the game where the gates are open and a survivor gets off the hook it's a bit out of your hands at that point. You've been outplayed by meta perks, just like a killer with nurses, bbq, or anything like that
---
When injured you can have iron will which completely counters spirits hearing your moans why should spirit have to have stridor if you aren‚Äôt even going to run iron will?
---
Could print off a green rank 3 perk and put your hands over it with the heart in it
---
When i found this post the post with the cat was right above it
---
I‚Äôve reported someone who was doing this exact same thing (working with killer to sandbag and farm). I used the in game report function, recorded the entire game, and sent both to BHVR using their online ticket submission. Both players were banned, at least for a short period.
---
They did end up getting unhooked, but billy knocked them back down again and killed them. For the rest of the match, I‚Äôm pretty sure he just stood there because the rest of us did the gens and escaped, he was no where to be found. rip
---
The fact that you are bragging about how much playtime you have and that you have all the trophies in the game and are still this completely wrong and have no idea what you are talking about is just sad
---
FUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKKK!!!!!
---
 I'll have it done by then....
---
I get stressed before the game even starts and spend 20 minutes before each game deciding if I want to deal with random bullshit again.
---
TydeTyme definitely isn't a fog whisperer.
---
That's glorious.
---
Link?
---
TydeTyme is fog whisperer? I never really liked the guy
---
I will make a few rebuttals. Please discuss with me your opinions on the ideas.
---
Camping: I agree that it is in the game. However, it isnt a fun thing for both sides. Makes...
---
1. Survivors not able to get altruism points
---
2. Makes the survivor being camped not get anything
---
3. Makes killer lose points
---
It does confirm a kill (usually), but it just isnt fun for anyone. Also, you can easily get "genrushed"
---
Tunneling: I also agree that this exists in the game. It still has the same issues of it not being fun for either side. This leaves at least 2 survivors to "genrush" you. Also, DS is a thing.
---
Gen-rushing.: I personally hate this term. It is used to describe toxicity of survivors doing the gens, but I prefer saying "gens get done to fast"
---
SWF: yeah, I understand this sucks. We all face SWF groups nowadays.
---
Ye. They delayed it so it would fuck with people who already completed the challenges
---
Glorious is my favourite word. Thank you
---
Billy is #1 besides Spirit. Most people who aren't on the Spirit bandwagon play Billy. That's why so much of the community disagrees with him needing balancing. Billy is the key for many unskilled players to rank up.
---
I'm starting to think you may be one of them.
---
Left her flat on her ass with this one
---
Devs have already said they aren't changing no mither because they like the idea of using it as a hard mode perk.
---
Why not?
---
and? It is literally impossible to have the 17, soon to be 18, killers all statistically perform the same unless you literally just give them the same power.
---
That's another thing, basing killers on their base powers VS. survivors with meta perks and strong items doesn't sound smart either.
---
You shouldn't be comparing the killers directly to each other in this specific case. How do you quantify a comparison between 2 killers who fundamentally work in 2 completely different ways?
---

Eh its fine, its just the swfs that i have issues with. When i play with randoms it goes pretty well, got 4k in a row with freddy. But with swfs its 4 escapes lmao.
---
Edit: most of us have issues with swf teams
---
You know what how tedious and absolutely brain dead most of these challenges are I completely believe that they would delay it on purpose just so that we have to work harder

Nice repost, I‚Äôve only seen this 30 times in the past hour
---
Well, as I thought
---
You shouldn‚Äôt rely on Ruin anyway
---
We figured out the smoothest way is to just give him a hook that has a chain attachment and a hoist. He would need person hooks.
---
That's bullshit and you know it. Vault and pick up are on different keys by default so unless you changed it on purpose, this should not happen at all.
---
Don't even know what that is
---
Why else would you hold your arms like that? :D
---
The complaining begins
---
Mhm. You shouldn't have to rely on a perk that can be gotten in less than a minute to even have a chance to win when you want to play a killer that isn't the same 3 boring high tier killers.

Yeah... they could do a bit better. But it‚Äôs the fact that they‚Äôre still sticking with the game, even after all this time that matters, hence the Labor of Love nomination
---
I've begun to try and get into playing Demodog and Plague without ruin to at least have some decent fun and my matches are lasting roughly 6 minutes because of how fast the gens go. It really seems like it's almost completely necessary against Ranks 3-1
---
You clearly don‚Äôt play killer, or if you do you‚Äôre either 
---
-a nurse, spirit, or billy main
---
-between rank 15-20
---
Never say never. They fistfucked Legion with nerfs and destroyed them. Then they came back later on and did it again, and while they nerfed the shit out of them, they repeatedly buffed an already OP meta perk (Borrowed Time).
---
Also don't forget that the Nurse and Spirit nerfs would have never come around if not for the oceans of survivor main tears.
---
Recently, shit is really not going well for me, i've found myself saying variations of "bitch" more often than freddy on his movies

Unfortunately yes

Unnerving Presence is a Trapper perk and makes skill checks on gens ‚Äúharder‚Äù. This current Tome is about the Trapper and stopping the gens from getting done means the gates won‚Äôt get opened.
---
When you chainsaw a gen and it pops, but you have kindred and see yourself
---
I know poor mori we tried to get him to use it on us
---
And then I downed them again after they got the 3% but they are allowed to have a free escape? Makes no sense to me. Perk is too op and needs nerfs. This a good way to slightly nerf it while letting it retain its job as an anti tunneling perk like borrowed time does. Borrowed time doesn‚Äôt activate on self unhook so why should ds?
---
I honestly havent got a salty message in a long time in console. Its definitely on a downturn for some reason.
---
Nice thinking! But could just picture my hand with the heart then crop it and put it on the green perk.
---
He's done the same thing in For Honor. He'll give some misguided presumptions and his fanbase just eats it up and let's him hear exactly what he wants. 
---
Hell, you could give several paragraphs worth on Warden's limitations and weaknesses (pre-buff) and then link a post on Competitive For Honor which leads into a video showing exactly how to 100 percent counter Warden when Out of Stamina (again, pre-buff) and the response from other viewers will still be "Warden main spotted, OmegaLOL" and True will still believe Warden is uncounter-able aside from the very best or when guessing and that going OOS against pre-buff Warden is an instant loss.
---
It's genuinely (and I mean genuinely) disheartening to see a good player get so wrapped up in their own opinions or observations it becomes unshakeable fact in every situation applicable. Either that or his vocal fans are such yes-men that it's numbed him to everyone else's thoughts (or atleast thoughts that aren't his own). 
---
But regardless, I just wanted to finish this by saying I don't hate True or his fans and this isn't an attempt to start a flaming war. If you find him entertaining then good, I'm glad you can find enjoyment where I can't. I've just had some thoughts for a bit and felt this was an opportune time.

No matter what happens just never forget when the game was alive boys. Before the tears brought nerfs. Chop them up until its dead.
---
Any other ones you think look nice?
---
What I will say is that player numbers swell hugely when there's double BP, with the lows typically being higher than regular highs
---
Indicates that there is a seriously large percentage of the "player" base that only sees a reason to boot up the game during double points, and BHVR should probably make more drastic moves to try and re-engage those players before they just move on to a different game entirely
---
Ah yes, Noob3. Doesn't he disconnect for stupid reasons? And didn't he witch hunt the devs that one time?
---
Not really. When two people are left, the killer can slug and go hunt for the fourth one. When that situation I described happens, the killer can effectively do nothing because the survivor is so immersed and doing nothing besides that. The game will not end without the EGC.
---
&gt;dude you really must have not nothing better to do if you‚Äôre saving every single one of these posts. I agree they‚Äôre annoying but jeez just downvote and move on and move on with your day.

I don't save them, I just update the comment. So many people replying to this comment saying "it must take a lot of time to save all these links".

---
Battery packs don't fall out. And I use a cord
---
Nothing they are just cosmetics
---
Was it even a stealth killer?
---
Not too mention they're really easy to rank up with because the emblem system wasn't designed for a killer that can grab more than 2 hits off a survivor before they go down. Even if you only get bronze devout you could easily end up having iridescent in the other 3 categories because his ability just fulfills them so well. 
---
Because of deep wounds and the ability to track other survivors it's pretty easy getting a decent gatekeeper score, and because you can get 4 hits per down you can manipulate the malicious and chaser emblems since every time you hit them you "win" a chase and since you can do more damage than they can heal you don't have to rely on hook states to give you malicious.
---
Cosmetics on what? Like, what aspect does it change?
---
Not sure, but I was just replying to your second message. Thought it was a little funny in the irony of telling someone else to grow up on a subreddit for a video game... no harm man, I enjoy double bp too

Check the customize button on your survivor, there are 3 slots beneath the regular cosmetics where you can choose charms to hang on your belt.

Same for killers, but the charms will hang on the hooks instead

they're just little decorations you can put on a survivor's belt or on the killer's hooks. you can put them on where you change clothes

It's not a brag dumbass. I'm literally just telling you that I have the experience to know what I'm talking about. I understand maybe your life boils down to just one grand pissing contest but for the rest of the world it isn't like that.

I believe Otz said he just never applied in the past, but if they do another round of applications, he'll probably apply then.

Gates are open but you barely started?
---
Yes this was/is a real thing on tome 2 of last weeks challenges before the news ones came out.
---
Stridor does not counter iron will because sounds are still very reduced normal people don‚Äôt NEED these perks to be successful against these killers :) by the way iron will is good against ANY killer who has ears considering it can cause you to completely lose a injured survivor
---
If you take stats at face value you I don‚Äôt know what to tell you
---
Not all heroes wear capes

Thanks for the info, I did for thoe reasons

"Hate." Lmao

She only screams loud when downed, hooked or zapped.
---
Freddy has bloodwarden best perk in the game
---
So it is still working or no?
---
by the looks its more of a teleportation than any real flight, but i agree it wouldn't work just because of indoor maps
---
Billy is a crutch? I suck with him xD
---
I don't know. That's why I'm asking here for people to try it and see if it works.
---
Does he really smile or is just a visual bug?
---
Play with your food would probably work decently with this character
---
&gt;Billy is a crutch? I suck with him xD
---
Only against bad / inexperienced survivors.
---
Bbq is very good but without ruin, your games might end too quickly. Even though the same case if ruin was found early but the ruin slows the game A LOT in comparison to chasing a survivor, attack them twice, then hook them for bbq to be active
---
Yeah, OP also said she was camping so that's a black pip for sure
---
I personaly think billy isn't too bad to play against. On paper his power sounds incredibly annoying and OP but in practice it tends to ballance itself out. The only really annoying part of his base kit is his ungodly speed but it also takes a decent ammount of time to charge and can't turn very well. I think him being one of the only free killers to start with helps his case of being one of the most played. Some people don't have the time to grind out shards or don't want to spend the money to get the other top tier killers (spirit, ghostface, and freddy all cost money). And nurse is very hard to play which would turn most newer killers away from her. You're entitled to your oppinion of course but thanks for reading this text wall of a comment anyway.
---
I would get Pop Goes the Weasel as a teachable before getting Freddy. Nurses is a good perk in general but not necessarily on freddy.
---
^
---
Yeah, but you would have to go out of your way to get them, I use a USB personally, but before that I just used rechargeable batteries
---
Yea... that‚Äôs true but the extra bloodpoints should help me get ruin again right?
---
Yeah there‚Äôs an unbelievable amount of ghostfaces right now!
---
It‚Äôs fine just the way it is. It‚Äôs meant to be an anti tunneling perk. And it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúfree escape‚Äù anymore like the old DS. You have to have get hooked for it to even activate
---
I mean this will be a good remake of DS to be honest.....
---
Because I 3 hooked two of his teammates and 2 hooked another that escaped. Then hooking him for a 9 hooks game, an Iridescent medal. Presumptuous to say shit killer when you yourself are most likely not good. Theres a thing called slugging that good players use against decent teams and slugging means you may not hook a player right after downing them.
---
Im just running lightborne, yes Im cruel like that
---
I appreciate your courteous input. It's shockingly in short supply around here.  I wish you plenty of successful trial in the future!
---
Oh really? I just had a match where I hooked someone at the start of the game. In the meantime I hooked a totally new person. The first person hooked was taken down and fully healed. I then found someone running to get the second person unhooked. I downed them and surprise! I was hit by DS. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was the first person because there was two with the same cosmetic.
---
So you can bugger off with that shit.
---
Just because he‚Äôs more successful than you doesnt mean you have to always mention the mistakes he made in the past, like every teenager does.

Why the fuck would it activate when you search a chest? because I don‚Äôt remember Laurie strode searching chest in the Halloween films plus there‚Äôs only like 2 chest minus offerings you can bring so that part doesn‚Äôt make sense but I do like the wiggle speed part
---
Okay, listen here. These need some nerfs.
---
Or, and this may rock your flipping socks, I have a differing opinion! Wow! It's almost like I'm an individual and don't _have_ to conform to the majority! I'm not acting superior, I'm having a _discussion._ I present my point, people present their counter, I respond etc until one or both of us agree or decide to part ways. It just so happens that I disagree with what people say.
---
Ash: *nurse noises*
---
From what i've seen--- Spit on everything. Then when you're done spitting, spit on everything else some more.
---
Then maybe the perk should deactivate if you heal within the 60 seconds? 
---
Just cause you hate playing against it as killer doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good perk for a survivor
---
Well then shit yo nevermind
---
The seraded blade wasn't in the movie tho lol
---
I just had the same problem while playing with another friend, we both went on ready but decided to get some drinks so we unchecked ourselfs and went downstairs. After 5 min we went back and found that the game had started on its own aswell, with us both killed and chat being salty about 2 afk's.. 
---
Have u ever found out why this happend to u?
---
Usually when they do that, I don‚Äôt get them until they‚Äôre on the brink of death. If you‚Äôre gonna make it harder on me, I won‚Äôt care about you
---
Hazbin Hazbin nothing but a blight on my life and an annoyance in my ear, like a gnat or boils.

I stopped playing a long time ago but Hillbilly was never a crutch for bad players to do well... I played Nurse and that felt like a crutch but was so fun. People were still bitchy when I‚Äôd 4k as Nurse even when they complained she was difficult to play üòÇ
---
Non-potato survivors use those 60 seconds to turn the perk into a stun grenade by hopping into lockers or throwing themselves at the killer. If they get healed they can then body block for someone twice and STILL crawl out if close enough to the exit gate, which they likely will during EGC.
---
Yeah I know, but the thing is I don‚Äôt have a lot of them cuz I usually don‚Äôt even bother half the time in the bloodweb to get them lol
---
It was mikey boy.
---
Down voting doesn't solve the problem actually it hides the problem makes it less likely to get noticed.
---
 People are posting about it constantly because they need to get off their asses and actually do something

I really hope it let you play like this

You dont know that.  The way the movie ended he could very much be the Thing

especially if it's gonna be like a majority of your paycheck, tf fam? i have terrible spending habits and even im not that bad. also bhvr is a fucking joke fam, they treat their fanbase like shit so idk why youd want to reward them with more money.

I dont get it, you all must be swf players. Bc I'm rank 6 and whenever I go up against billy my teammates go down instantly. So whenever I play against billy we just get wrecked mostly bc my teammates r ass, which is what makes Billy seem so op. Maybe I need to get a Swf group.
---
Actually trapper is far more popular than any other killer. He's so far forward that people don't even see him. And the reason that Billy isn't nerfed is because no one is complaining about him. He's existed from the beginning, and has never been a problem, so no one has had any reason to nerf him.
---
I had this for a game too it‚Äôs really annoying
---
I only hear low ranks say that dbd is killer sided. Survivors are so powerful if they actually do the gens.
---
Being forced to slug (a thing survivors hate) instead of tunneling (another thing survivors hate) is not counterplay.
---
Huh weird. You didn‚Äôt interact with the substance of my post at all. It‚Äôs almost as if you know I‚Äôm right and have no counter. Soooo weeeeiiiirrrd

---
Yea... That's exactly what you are supposed to do? Why did you make this post if you knew how to counter ds.
---
If the unhooker has DS and runs to save, you down then and camp till it's up, then you pick em up and leave.
---
It's there fault for running in with a shitty plan like that.
---
There is no substance.  That's the point.  A point which was abundantly clear to anyone on the planet that isn't the transparent asshole who wrote this post.

Wtf kind of logic is this? If the entity had any control over what came in chests it would be a middle finger and nothing else. I'm convinced you think survivors pull a shard of glass out of their ass to stab the killer with.

And where the fuck did I say anything about a knife?

im sure its a cool attraction

Unlike everyone else in here i agree. You shouldnt get hit by ds if you didnt tunnel. Shit happens more then it should

---
&gt;Being forced to slug instead of tunneling (another thing survivors hate) is not counterplay.
---
You need to look at this from both perspectives. Apart from DS, survivors have zero tools to use against a tunneler and being left slugged is good for both parts. Killers get to temporarily pause someone from doing anything while creating another objective for 3 other survivors (traveling and picking up that one guy). Survivors instead of being removed from the game ASAP, they get to stay in the match for a while longer if they teammates manage to pick them up or the killer gets DSed. 
---
&gt;(a thing survivors hate) 
---
Survivors who hate being slugged in the current scenario of dying state (95% recovery bar) are just new to the game.
---
Most people use photoshop and stuff like that to create killer designs. Don't know a website that offers that. But your idea will probably get lost in every other Pennywise killer concept.
---
As stated on pretty much all of the tri-daily posts asking for this it would require getting permission/ rights from different people than who they got the rights to even have ghostface in the game. So its almost certainly not happening
---
Casey vorhees.

Oh, so your saying a good killer who is one of the 4 starters whose easy to play as is one of the top killers? Weird. Reminds me of somebody else.

Just look closer.
---
Just make sure to have your whole team carry toolboxes
---
The reason why the perk had a side benefit at the time of its creation was because of how situational it was to actually activate the perk. They need to somehow make this perk more versatile if they‚Äôre going to get rid of the side effect. The perk is still a gamble on whether or not it will be useful and that isn‚Äôt ok for essentially a downgraded Lithe.

Who isn't? We know at the least that it applies to Slaanesh.

Yeah bro, my squad is running 3 brand new parts on commodious boxes with prove thyself
---
The random god trap
---
&gt;a lot of Hillbillies in my experience begin to proxy camp as soon as the game goes against them.
---
You've just hit the nail on the head. That's the type of playstyle encouraged by his kit, and he can be so effective at it, that Survivors may as well give up at times.
---
&gt;And that's a perfectly valid strategy and very effective but completely ruins the game for survivors and will guarantee a win against most teams that aren't communicating.
---
Bingo. And it shouldn't be an encouraged strategy.
---
&gt;The ultimate 'noob stomper.'
---
The irony is noobs play him to skyrocket through the ranks, then proceed to shit-talk and rank-shame everyone else.
---
Yea its bugged and will always count only 1 emblem
---
No, he still has a one shot down, and just because Billy Mains have to do smaller chainsaws and cant zip around the entire map doesn't make him "trash" on those maps.
---
You can still BBQ, spot someone, zip around faster than most killers, and end chases faster than almost anyone else.
---
This goes RIGHT along with people acting like these indoor maps were survivor sided before were were straight up given percentages that show the EXACT OPPOSITE.
---
Just because you don't like playing on a map as much, doesn't mean it's "trash" or you're not still overperforming.
---
Isn‚Äòt that a part of a No0b3 Video?
---
Yeah, they were just giving a chance for a trash to feel special
---
The reason for her kill-rate being so low is because a lot of people who play as her suck ass with her.  But on the other hand the people who are great with her dominate almost every match. So yes, she is indeed in a fine spot. But if the god tier Nurse players were the only people who played Nurse than her kill-rate would be through the fucking roof at every rank.
---
He actually does smile, if you look at his idle animation sometimes he'll just smirk

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e42n3o/iridescent_emblems_challenge_only_counts_one_per/
---
It's quite literally the opposite, what the fuck.
---
&gt; which would also stun 
---
So a stun on top of a stun? No thanks. And I'd hope the killer would still be able to move their head up and down as needed to avoid said flashlight saves even while stunned. Plus, 30% wiggle increase is too much, especially on top of all that other shit. You want to increase the chances of getting the survivor off the killer's shoulder, but this makes it too easy and takes all the work out of it for the survivors. Survivors should have to work together in order to get a flashlight blind off, not this.
---
So now we should nerf the shit out of over performing killers? You do realize that taking stats at face value will kill this game as we pull the trigger on killers when they are clearly not overpowered
---
So happy Last Minute Hero was reduced to 1 unhook. That‚Äôs actually doable without massive rng. Thanks BHVR
---
Sanya lox
---
Ford? As in for? Because no phantasm which is fantastic imo because no one knows what's trapped or if they triggered it. Especially when they go for the rescue either:
---
Randoms have no idea its trapped or where its trapped.
---
Swf: prevents them from tracking you unless they've been counting both the trap countdown and how long mint rag is on cooldown, and if they even triggered a trap.
---
You can a different addon but *I prefer* that combo.
---
I didn‚Äôt lose. Got the 4K. 
---
Sorry champ
---
Meh. Billy only becomes a crutch killer when you slap insta saw addons and ruin or spirit fury on him. Otherwise he's probably the most balanced killer.
---
goes both ways
---
Wait how did you get 660 mil bloodpoints?
---
Distortion good as is imo
---
You can hear Bill from the next trial over.
---
&gt;If you hook someone else, DS deactivates for any other survivor.
---
This. I like this.
---
They delayed the patch another week how about work on its stead of delaying it for no reason I also want you to not be a Jack ass about it by posting this crapp on everyone who complains
---
24/7 yeah
---
Oh,thanks comrade ( that detail is in some way,scary)
---
Yes!

Don‚Äôt bother with these people, OP. They are all hypocrites and liars

It heals one health state where as NOED rids two therefore no.

Even on console? Cus as far as I know I don't think they can punish anything without dedicated servers

i only get russians no matter what the time is :D

Yeah, if someone like me who barely knows anything about Warhammer can recognize those gods instantly, I very much doubt your "die hard" status.

Oh no, you're all stood around healing/wanking each other off, I guess I have to stand here and watch your little circle jerk :(....
---
What are you talking about? If their issue is deliverance then they die hook someone 
---
You have no idea what‚Äôs happening right now
---
Ehh, not necessarily. It‚Äôs because the bright hair cosmetics are picked a lot by the players who want the attention, not even to mention how toxic Nea‚Äôs can be.
---
Being not an asshole was never an option
---
This was already posted here before.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what age you are, you know not to lie, cheat, and start witch-hunts at about six years old.
---
Not an excuse and Noob fanboys are braindead
---
At this point, I'm just getting entertained by the salt I'm mining from all the psuedo-high ranks.
---
I really like all of these changes. None of them are overkill (like some people suggesting wiggle speed to Boil Over) and it would go a long way towards making them more fun to use.
---
I just have one suggestion for Saboteur: Allow survivors to see hook auras.
---
And yet you're still crying like a kid who scrapped their knee.
---
Must be hard constantly seeking emotional affirmations over video games 
---
You lead a lonely life.
---
I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre mean. Tone doesn‚Äôt matter to me at all. They‚Äôre just wrong. OP is talking about Deliverance which objectively means they hooked someone
---
Sadly, yes. Anytime you say something they disagree with, they immediately try to call you a noob. Crazy, right??
---
So this sounds like a perfect game to me and your still complaining about a 10 second stun?
---
I'm sorry I dont get the reference.
---
In The Game map, you can acually read the warning yellow labels on some of the machinery or pipes on the walls in the map. One of them says something like "whoever has time to read this is a dbd pro has a lot of free time".

Can I counter gen speeds by "bring good"

So just your standard Billy players then?

Wait I think I figured out what you mean?

Holy fuck you have some of the worst English skills I have ever seen

No his breath showed up in the cold. Things dont. Like the black guy (sorry dont remember name) didnt have his breath show up at the end

Please no, I can only prestige so fast
---
You‚Äôre talking to someone who is brain dead. Don‚Äôt bother with them
---
What's that? You want another?? Careful, BHVR might take notice and nerf your favorite drooling tard with his ballsack glued to his face.
---
Bhvr is not a huge multibillion game studio. If you're calling them lazy for not fixing all the maps where BL is problematic as well as not wanting to balance each map they wish to add twice, you're being pretty selfish.
---
 Also you realize that nerfing the locations where BL can be abused is doing the same thing in the end as just nerfing the perk? Balanced landing is still a solid perk, just not as oppressive in the long run.
---
And I too hate the misuse of word infinite but BL literally does enable infinites on haddonfield
---
Ok, I know what's going on here, but Angel's leg is kind of covering the knife so it's hard to see what the meme is supposed to be.

Lol billy is only strong if you dont know how to run. This seems like a you problem and I'm a survivor main.

These variables don‚Äôt necessarily skew towards killers. Solo queue survivors take up the majority of the survivor playerbase so against uncoordinated survivors a lot of the killers who are considered weak gain an advantage. But against semi-coordinated survivors these killers lose their power immensely. Clown, Wraith, Trapper and Leatherface are all destroyed by survivors who know how to manage their time efficiency.
---
Yeah, good luck running from his insta-saw lmao.
---
I call this:
---
King of the Hill reference. Dale Gribble frequently uses the alias of "Rusty Shackleford" whenever having to give his name to anyone of authority. Just a dumb joke on my part lol.
---
But they were working together. Why would he kill her first
---
You were supposed to hit inside the white zone
---
Dude I fucking love you.
---
I guess people can‚Äôt grow up, huh? Has he personally done something to you for you to react so badly? Your current mentality is just as bad as his past behavior.
---
This is what I‚Äôm getting from this post, ‚ÄúThe clown is OP because it requires more thought being put into being chased and I can‚Äôt loop the killer forever and it actually means that there‚Äôs a risk to being chased and I now have to avoid it!‚Äù
---
I'm a killer main though.
---
Thanks, I can be a bit paranoid about this stuff
---
Afraid to ask,  whats BK myers?
---
I'm not here to be wrong or right. I'm here to stimulate critical discussion on game balance.
---
You got their name. Nice.
---
Autodidact and Lightweight are fine the way they are but I really like the No Mither change
---
I play killer though?
---
Moscow server was planned at full release of servers, I think.
---
To be honest, I'll be very sad when it'll happen. Playing 90%+ of games on Moscow server is my nightmare
---
This is being hysterical now, like 50% kill rate is somehow terrifying to you. "Don't believe any of the stats" oh how convenient. Flair checks out.
---
....spose ill take it &gt;:(
---
By saying one of the weakest killers needs to be nerfed? Yup CRITICAL discussion right there.
---
I legitimately don't understand how. Ace has this really unique quick breath noise that he does instead of his groans that is *much* quieter than any other survivor, and is basically built in Iron Will. You can still occasionally hear it when trying to look in an area for an injured Ace, but in the middle of a chase it gets drowned out much more than the others.
---
Ngl, even though the power is a joke, I love to zoom across the map and slide over pallets lol
---
Imagine having this take. Yikes.
---
As a former clown main, this is the most wrong thing I‚Äôve read in a while
---
Well then why are you complaining? His power exists solely for those points
---
With the bugs I understand
---
if only he wasn't so boring
---
Hell yes buddy! Preach it! I appreciate this mentality greatly, as it is one I try to spread as much as possible.
---
Sometimes I die helping the other three escape and killer will say to me "Haha you lost!", in those situations I simply respond "I'm here to play the game, helping my fellows escape is part of the game. I have only lost if I leave before any of them."
---
Moral is I love your post, have an up-vote.
---
You realize survivor mains talk about buffing lower-tier killers all the time, right? It‚Äôs part of the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no variety at high ranks‚Äù deal you hear a lot.
---
Clown's weak as hell, what're you smoking, XD, you probably think every killer that can stop your loops needs a Nerf, don't you? Base kit, Clown slows you down, nothing else. How about actually playing killer regularly before making demands.
---
True. I still use it, but it barely get's put to use. I'd say the only 2 scenario's in which I get to use it are:
---
1: If a killer (hard)tunnels me off the hook. I don't think anyone finds that unfair.
---
2: If all gens are done and the killer camps/patrol me to get the last kill. I don't mind killers camping me, but I do also find that ds is fair here
---
He has bottles that help alot with chases thats litterally it. He has no map pressure at all so gens will go by like no tomorrow. If you think clowns op you must be a rank 20
---
i'm more likely to believe in unicorns than in a killer main that's complaining about a lowtier killer being op
---
New survivor perk will increase wiggle speed if there is another survivor within range. Can't remember which one must have it equipped tho.
---
This is an interesting one but will sorely be wasted if survivors have Maps and deja vu. Not to mention that certain generator spawn in certain locations. If I use this perk on a map like the game or any indoor map where generators always spawn near doors that aren't open then survivors are going to know I have this perk. Plus this would be an interesting perk to force a three gin
---
Makes sense but then Freddy is a weird guy if that‚Äôs what his dream world Is
---
Last drink is sounding a bit like Wake Up
---
Look at the other comments. It's succeeding. And I wouldn't say he's a weak killer.
---
Never noticed that... I'm going to watch again
---
Holy shit my guy, sure you can be mad but you don‚Äôt have to be an asshole to anyone who tries to reply, a bunch of the time they are literally trying to have a civil discussion but you are responding being a toxic cunt. Take a fucking breather and sign up for anger management, goddamn.
---
Nothing to back up that assertion I see.
---
On Friday it was "tonight, then the deadline slipped to "next week",
---
I thought maybe being able to always keep an eye on the killer might spice it up a bit. But I‚Äôm always open to some suggestions!
---
Even on the worst of days he smiles. I love it.
---
But my mommy and daddy bought me a PS4 and they can't afford to buy me an Xbox One as well, so I'm going to be ANGRY at the Xbox One to make myself feel better knowing I'll never own one!!!!
---
I play killer for a challenge. He's too easy to play.
---
I‚Äôm not a fan and he‚Äôs repeatedly done negative things. I don‚Äôt have to forgive him and no amount of fanboys are gonna change my mind. He‚Äôs already showed what kind of person he is. The people who say ‚ÄúhE cHanGed‚Äù has a point... before he did it again.
---
Adam grins when he escapes the trial,otherwise he just frowns
---
None of the killers go above 75% which is a 3k so no most killers do not dominate most matches
---
I main killer though, so...
---
are you from russia? :D   
---
why would it be a nightmare? (i agree tho but i wanna hear your reasoning :D )
---
&gt;no map pressure
---
That's what perks are for.
---
Its funny, people saw the stats and immediately forgot about the well oiled machine that is DbD matchmaking.
---
And Nurse is in a low position in both charts. So Nurse is low tier right?
---
Use your brain for a second.
---
Freddy and Ghostface are closer to being the rank 3 than Billy, and Spirit and Nurse are rank 2 and 1 respectively. Straight data doesn't mean shit. There are WAY too many variables in DBD to just look at data and make conclusions. And ranks don't mean shit when garbage can Blendettes can get red ranks by just hiding but the moment they have to face the killer they get killed in .3 seconds.
---
He's not low tier.
---
U IS FOR UMWTFAREYOUPUTTINGUPMYASS
---
If they add another Survivor they better increase the number of generators and they better give every single killer a extreme buff. I'm talkin a Trapper being able to carry every trap in the game kind of buff
---
Let me guess, you are also anti-vax?
---
This just in, no killer ever 4ks. Got it.
---
Drag that troll!  
---
Huzza for fellow Killer mains.
---
Yep, it's very annoying and I think they should fix that.
---
There is nothing you can do but report and hope honestly
---
Jesus. Somehow I'm doubting that, but putting that on the shelf for a minute, have you ever touched Clown specifically?
---
I thought it was clever
---
Tombstone + Vanity Mirror.
---
You can't go to tier 3 and your tier 2 movement speed is slower than the survivor running speed. So basically a Fat Myers meme build
---
Do you know what a critical discussion is? A discussion addressing a critical issue with the game clown being op (which he‚Äôs not) is not critical to the game balance. And he is weak in the grand scheme sure he can stop loops but that‚Äôs a 1v1 no pressure to the other 3 who have just done 3 gens per one hook, then they save and you chase get another hook last two gens pop games over you lost thats a weak killer.
---
Bennings-Thing's breath [shows up just fine in the cold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Z44BIDPPc&amp;t=1m28s).
---
Don‚Äôt believe any of the stats??? I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt fucking take them at face value but you keep twisting my words
---
Don‚Äôt know the amount of perks, but you can have an infinite amount of perks, granted they are in the game
---
It is critical to the game balance. I'm presenting the null hypothesis, playing the devil's advocate. People may find more reasons to have him buffed out of this.
---
These people vote ^
---
Remember that guys.
---
Ok heres a stat for you genius, coming in mere *contact* with Oxygen that is around 1/5 of earths atmosphere has a %100 mortality rate, anyone who simply touches the stuff dies.
---
GG
---
yes yes he is. 
---
he has no map pressure, his tracking is below average, he's barely good in chase as his power does NOTHING except slowing down survivors and being an annoying piece of shit. 
---
so he's an m1 killer.
---
Some, though I mainly play the shape and the spirit.
---
Steve in the bg is the killer
---
Ask that salty and toxic swf, who thought that it would be funny to bm a hag and get rect later
---
Allow me to elaborate, while yes, he can block off certain things, he has no map pressure, mostly mediocre add-ons, long reload speed, somewhat short range, and a relatively high skill requirement when it comes to ‚Äúwhere am I going to throw this bottle‚Äù or ‚Äú should I reload now or wait‚Äù.
---
All killers are m1, so that point is irrelevant.
---
That person must be drunk or something i swear
---
Yeah I did. Though not sure if anyone actually gets banned on console for this stuff.
---
Because on maps that balanced landing was needed to help make the map tolerable for survivors (the game, Hawkins lab. The top two killer sided maps). Instead of fixing maps that need BL or that BL could be abused on
---
They‚Äôre the same button forXbox/PS4/Switch.

I have a key and the hatch is right next to me, lol gg, baby killer, Haha outplayed
---
&gt;How many survivor and killer perks are there (including teachables)
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks . Alternatively you can just open a KYF lobby to check every single perk and how many are there. 
---
&gt;what‚Äôs the max amount you can have on someone?
---
All of them.
---
This real?
---
100%, he was even saboing hooks lol
---
What are you talking about? Saying he needs a nerf to get people to talk about why he‚Äôs weak as if they don‚Äôt do that already? That‚Äôs the dumbest thing ever anyone who plays killer already knows why clown is weak they don‚Äôt need a bait to discuss it which is what you‚Äôve done.
---
But I don't have BBQ
---
Spamming this everywhere and on other people‚Äôs posts isn‚Äôt going to help you. This is like the third time I‚Äôve seen you scrolling around 
---
Maybe look at your own Internet connection? I‚Äôm Rank 4 Killer and get a lobby in ~3 minutes
---
I hate Ruin
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Right bc that's the suggestion. There is only 0 and 100 right? You can't have fun with everyone without being bullied right? You can't play to win without bringing OP or annoying perks and offerings right?
---
Play to win, but don't play like an asshole. You don't have to chose one or the other.
---
DS is the anti tunnel perk. If you have time to down someone and hook them ds should be at least half gone. Then you can just slug and hook. Yea in that situation it's not exactly tunneling but there is an easy counter that gives you amazing map pressure.
---
Its funny to think that Wraith was technically a top 3 killer at 1 point
---
You don't touch oxygen genius.
---
That's actually kinda cool to see such a big streamer playing dbd. Hopefully it brings in more players!
---
These stats are the average matches which means a majority of matches are 2k I never said "No killers ever 4k"
---
It gets people to be more emotional, which does indeed enhance discussion.
---
You got the other 3?

No perks cant even do that. Clown cant get from one gen to another across the map like billy. Billy has amazing map pressure. Clown doesnt.
---
Problem is, there's always been a bigger fish.
---
Ruin is map pressure.
---
I tried MoM out on the ptb and got it to proc like 3 games in a row, can‚Äôt say if it was luck or not but it does seem more consistent to me
---
Clown is so bad don't make him worse
---
All I can say is, have an upvote.
---
I mean they did it to spirit so...
---
not really all (hillbilly, demo) but eh whatever.
---
what, you have nothing else to say? 
---
look at toptier killers.
---
nurse -- insane map pressure, godtier chase.
---
hillbilly -- godtier map pressure, decent chase, instadown.
---
spirit -- annoying piece of shit, good chase, nice map pressure, though some different things about her made her toptier..
---
freddy -- godtier map pressure on ANY map, good chase if you know how to use him, annoying piece of shit.
---
even hag is good cuz she has map pressure. 
---
does clown have it? lol no. he has absolute zero.
---
I didn‚Äôt think to do that, I have all the dlc I wanted to p3 50 some survivors but was wondering if it was worth waiting until I unlocked all teachables, thanks!
---
I just hope he doesn‚Äôt bring hook camping kids with him
---
I can see it now
---
Post game chat: "Go back to fortnite.".
---
This has to be a shitpost... I rate 8 for effort considering the wall of text (mostly dumb things but still wall).
---
The shape doesnt have map pressure and has worse chase potential than clown, yet he's good.
---
Yes, I am. And Russians are sweaty toxic tryhards, that's why a prospect of playing on Moscow server is terrifying.
---
Apologies, that was changed last patch
---
But you don‚Äôt need to get them emotional any killer main could have a nonemotional discussion about why the weak killers need to be buffed. All you‚Äôve done is dropped a lit match in a munitions deposit. You probably thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say something outlandish to get people to discuss the same thing instead of just saying clown needs a buff‚Äù

I‚Äôm not a fan either, but I really don‚Äôt get why he should be hated. What else has he done other than the banning issue?

He‚Äôs the awkward guy that quietly stands by the snacks at parties

*sigh. No just stop.
---
michael isn't good lol 
---
he takes forever to come online and only really works if survivors are blind and let you get tier3 ez cuz u have lunge.

myers also has sooome map pressure cuz you always look around for him and almost never truly know where he is, especially at the start of the match.

They can, they have access to everyone's accounts, they couldn't punish DC's wothout dedicated server because they themselves can't tell if it was on purpose or because the internet or game was having problems, the accounts of people are still in the hands of the devs, if they have solid evidence of something, they can ban people, they had proof Noob hacked his legacy back into the game, so they banned him, if they have proof this Wraith hold the game hostage, they can ban his account, even if it's just for a few weeks or months.

garbage

Cause while my spirit is level 50 I rushed her and picked the cheaper addons in the bloodweb (she‚Äôs my next killer to prestige)
---
The perk screen is from my Ghostface. I wanted it too look as legit as possible but had to work with what I have.
---
Did this really need to be a post?
---
My cum is boiling
---
I know trying to talk sense into you is talking to a brick fucking wall, but Spirit and Nurse are the OP killers and Spirit is the one who needs less skill.
---
Did you need to comment?
---
Not from my experience luckily
---
Triggered
---
I‚Äôm sorry ‚Äúold‚Äù is subjective. This clip was from 60 days ago. And I was still really bad at the game I just recently started playing a lot
---
He probably will, regardless of intention.
---
&gt;No, not tunneling can and does still get the killer ds‚Äôd. The counterplay is either slugging, mori them, or pretend they don‚Äôt exist for 60 seconds.
---
This an issue that devs need to work on but not tunneling still is the counter play. The problem is when you don't tunnel but you are too effective (sounds stupid, I know).
---
Considering a lot of people have been complaining about this, devs will have to come up with something to fix it (like deactivating DS when you hook someone else or whatever else they can think of).
---
"What if You the spirit but said"

That lady sounds like a man. ugh.

Yeah but bbq

oh ok then if a russians says that it might be true, i thought it was only me finding russian player omega toxic :D
---
It's the combinations of factors that make his miserable to face.
---
You forget what kind of players might be brought in... watch yourself, there be dangerous encampments near now... they give me conniptions.
---
Context for those wondering, this isn‚Äôt bragging or anything it‚Äôs the fact this game never ended. If u look at the bottom left there is no hatch icon cause I closed it and on the top there is no egc cause it ended. So this was a bugged game because one of the survivor bugged it out somehow the bleed out never worked either I had to leave the game.
---
Spirit and Nurse got nerfed. That's the whole issue I'm adressing.
---
Red girl how many things are you going to steal holy shit
---
&gt;Did this really need to be a post?
---
Considering I don't watch Fortnite let alone open Mixer (ever), I am glad OP posted it. I wouldn't have known otherwise.
---
Maybe this will be furtherly explored when we get a Wraith-themed Archive.
---
I did that on ps4 and one of them sent a message saying "I hate you you got me banned"üòÇ
---
Platform: PS4. I lost all of my save data! I have hundreds of hours and have spent hundreds of dollars on this game! Please help me.
---
The fuck is wrong with those people? They do realize they can be reported for that I hope?
---
Well, I am kinda busy playing multiple different games with events, so you can imagine my DbD grind is slow.
---
[Just as her grandaughter &lt;3](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9bzdvz/i_have_the_power_of_the_entity_and_anime_on_my/?st=k3m5mt12&amp;sh=b93aea12)
---
They also have pictures of the coldwind farm sometimes in the haddonfield houses
---
Fucking the game "tolerable to survivors" ??? The map that has had literally the highest amount of safe pallets (up to 18) ever since the legion update? Hawkins lab is definitely tolerable for survivors too, and it had ridiculous loops with balanced landing if you knew how to run them.
---
Also you realise it's far easier to make those maps more survivor sided than it is to remove every single god loop that BL enabled?
---
Highlight please
---
he‚Äôs playing now? tbh I hate ninja, I used to play fortnite before dbd and I just could not stand him
---
It's 40% off on Steam atm, so if it crossed your mind to get it, then you probably should.
---
I haven't finished the game but would recommend it for sure, stunning visuals and art style. It's a challenging, but most of us DBD sadists will cope just fine.
---
agreed!
---
Clown and Huntress for me. I cant pressure gens enough with em.
---
Yeah he's playing now on mixer, he's playing like a noob and raging ü§£ i dont think he'll stay
---
Fuck
---
&gt;he‚Äôs playing now? tbh I hate ninja, I used to play fortnite before dbd and I just could not stand him
---
He is streaming it on Mixer for 5k viewers.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you tell us what the sub is called? You know, so we can check it out?
---
I think that‚Äôs really the only change it needs because it really isn‚Äôt fun being tunneled but like you said the killer shouldn‚Äôt be punished for being too good at not tunneling lol
---
Lol play one game with survivor on red/purple ranks on ps4 and u will regret what u said
---
DS got buffed actually
---
They're still stronger than Billy. His power is just a dash attack that occasionally lands a hit, which happens to skip straight to the dying phase. His power and perks don't halt gens, don't discourage teamwork, and are simply above average in the chase. Freddy, Ghostface, and Axe Mommy are far better than Hillbilly. He's not even hard to outplay, just bolt for the windows. Even I can outplay a decent Sawyer, and I'm a Legion main.
---
If it's taking too long, well just don't do it! Puke on them once and chase them as you normally would, let the timer do the rest, even if it means having to hit them twice! They'll eventually end up broken or they'll cleanse
---
thank goodness. It‚Äôll be good for dbd‚Äôs popularity at least, but yeah nah I hope he sticks to the shooters
---
I really, really hate Whispers. I can't stand the sound. I played one match with it and became so infuriatingly focused on that stupid perk that it didn't even help me locate anybody.
---
Fair enough. I'll give that a go, I appreciate the insight!
---
I may be Slaanesh...
---
how old was he like 17-18? literally who cares its just a video game. Hes literally just a content creator for a video game, why do you expect him to be some robot incapable of making mistakes? 
---
‚ÄúCancel culture‚Äù is lame. Find something better to do with your time and energy than trying to find out if a famous person made a mistake before in their life.
---
Ad hominem.
---
Survivors only get hatch if they're Altruists who were very dutiful with objectives. Blendettes who just fucked off in the corner while their teammates were doing gens don't deserve
---
It‚Äôs not really for tunneling though
---
The new insidious buff looks great!
---
yawn
---
I feigned farming for most the game and got 2 hooks letting them save farm, someone opened the gate and then I threw two peeps on the hooks at end game collapse. Challenge, complete.
---
Whaaaaaat, that's weird.
---
Shame this got delayed. These challenges are being the most annoying.
---
Some of them are hella difficult. Also, the one for getting emblems doesn't seem to be registering more than one per game, which is quite annoying. lol
---
Noob3 is older then me. Crazy how I know not to break TOS of games, lie about it, and start witch hunts. As I‚Äôve said MULTIPLE times, it‚Äôs not just a one off event. He‚Äôs shown me enough to pass judgement, at least for me.
---
These takes are so fucking stupid
---
Please make this happen.
---
The situations needed to have the sacrifice for the SB aren't that common, and can be easily avoided with either running a different perk or learning hiw to use lithe correctly. There is no need for a buff.
---
"safest pallets" and ridiculous loops doesn't change the data that the game, Hawkins lab, and Larry's are the three deadliest maps with over a 64% kill rate. 
---
Everyone knows that the game is so heavily killer sided. It doesn't matter how many safe pallets there are if to transition to half of them you either need to find stairs (which can kill you before getting there) or need to take a drop (which can kill you/damage you if you don't have balanced.
---
Here ya go https://twitter.com/datgeistra/status/1179019657178574849?s=21 enjoy
---
Actually unplayable
---
Got it from the shrine a while back
---
Clown is a good killer if you can get pressure early and maintain it throughout the game. However he's extremely vulnerable to being ran over due to not having much snowballing potential (unless the survivors throw themselves at you), he doesn't have a 1 hit (without his add-on or a perk), and while his bottles can definitely help in a chase, they're very counterable by good survivors. 
---
If anything Clown needs a buff to help him maintain a reasonable amount of pressure on the survivors or give him something to help snowball the game. I know every time I choose to play him that the game can be over pretty fast simply by getting off to a shit start.
---
Btw sorry for my bad english
---
It shouldn't be physically possible to have a wrong opinion yet here we are.
---
I only play both solo experiences
---
That's true, I overlooked that.
---
No, no... Should delete the thread for more Noob and Otz posts.

A hillbilly with bad ping is an impossible nightmare (I‚Äôm on console)
---
They are shitty survivors. Play the game thru for better or worse. Take it like a champ and not an asshole. (Side note: I play survivor most often. I hate people like that too.)
---
That's fair. I tend to stick to just a couple games for that reason lol.
---
I know the Rat isn't in 40k. I've said as much twice. At least five of the others are tho.
---
And the Emperor isn't a chaos god. He's just an insanely powerful god-like half physical being.
---
Still the worst exhaustion perk. Not a bad perk, mind. I just feel a boost would make it a more attractive choice in comparison to the others.
---
Make your choice, ruin, STBFL, and dying light is my build
---
I think people actually hyperventilate to dull pain IRL.
---
I agree.
---
Although, hopefully, those interactions will stay. If you are wounded, you will bleed out. That is a good mechanic, and adds to the borrow factor.
---
Or they should rework it. Making mending time low (so you can potentially mend while in a chase if skilled enough), but the bleed-out speed is unaffected by the killer‚Äôs presence.
---
However, if the killer is absent, you need to seek other survivor to mend (or take twice the time). This would make logical sense, and while being chased, you are more likely to do things faster + adrenaline helps.
---
If they don‚Äôt do that, then let the interactions stay. Then, killer would be a stun scary killer ‚Äî ‚Äúyou stun it, you buy it‚Äù. Or he can use other perks (insidious, beast of prey), but even then it would take too long to tunnel somebody with a bleed out timer anyway (keeping it balanced).
---
Will it be fun to play as ‚Äî absolutely. Against ‚Äî not so (but who cares, doctor, plague etc are also not very fun to play against. Yet they exist.. Why? Because they are the killer damnit, they are made to be terrifying, not the entertainers).
---
So you just want a constant rotations of nerfs to top performers? Brilliant.
---
Power has to be peted

---
I was just thinking this.  Sometimes it just feels not very rewarding.  Even if you succeed the best you can on either side, it still feels very stingy.  The dailies and archives can help a bit, but if they ask you to do something with a character you still haven't touched yet, they feel like deadweight.
---
We need more semi-regular 2XBP events, like every month at least...
---
Just saying lol I'm a survivor main anyways, but with how salty a lot of them are I've read killer say the same thing.
---
99% of us do.
---
Your such an ass
---
Just learn how to loop and you can loop a killer for 5 gens lol
---
Well done, I will never unsee that in my killer bloodwebs XD
---
I'm going to have to P3 him regardless. All of my favorite killers are P3, and he's going to be my main for a while. Sucks that its so weak looking. At least his paid skins are good.
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
Holy fuck man you're toxic lol. Willing to bet if we could see all the details in your life like public figures deal with we'd think you're a pretty vile person too lol bit keep hiding behind anonymity and acting like your opinion matters to make yourself feel special I guess :)
---
Do you pronounce it as no mither or no mither
---
They also said they won‚Äôt do any clown killer with the respect to the actual phobia, but here we are. Also, same can be said about Demogorgon (as they were reluctant to do something not-human-like, but I may be incorrect on this one).
---
This is accurate though I'd say about 1.6m to 50 instead of 1.5. 1m usually gets you to 37-38.
---
Still mu favorite Donnie moment.

It's ok to admit you don't understand how to read stats.

Trapper??

What if he mimics killers instead of the survivors? As in temporarily changes to the other killer and has their power for the limited time? But needs to collect/inflict fear from the survivors to do so.
---
Need mobility ‚Äî- billy. They swarm hook ‚Äî bubba/hag. Need chase ‚Äî Nurse/Spirit. Need pressure ‚Äî legion, hag, doctor. However, the exceptions would be trapper, plague, pig, demo etc. because of the in-game items appearing (it would be hell to code). If they can, it would be super awesome though.

I'd swap self care out and try to get spine chill to 3

This is a really good idea

But then the rank 18 is actually a rank 1 that has just gone through rank reset
---
You had me at cbt
---
Two hex totems spawn. When one of the two is cleansed, all survivors, not just the poor bastard who cleansed it, are exposed for a while. (Exposed means if a survivor gets hit with a basic attack, they go down even if they were healthy) Once either one of the totems have been cleansed, the other hex totem becomes a dull totem.
---
You have to time it so it blinds when the killer has control of their camera. Same as always.
---
looks like the entity decided it likes god pallet more than it likes you and punished you for using it.
---
Honestly though. Been running it on huntress, you'd be suprised how many screams you hear from it. Faster reloads is also nice.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what it is? I always thought so
---
Because if they DC they can deny you points as well as screw over their teammates.
---
You can throw hatchets through walls. I don‚Äôt if that‚Äôs what the killer did.

That was weird anyways.

Can confirm, I started playing her and I was complete shit on a stick with her. I would usually practice a lot with getting her blinks accurately (plaid shirt addon) . After a few hours I started getying better... and by that I  mean that I actually downed two different people and hooked them. I stopped playing after 5 hours on her because of someone insulting me in end game chat. I will pick her up later, I just don't feel like she's quite there yet in the basis of perks for her.
---
No, i think he has good qualities, but he‚Äôs far from overpowered like you‚Äôve said to multiple others in this comment section
---
Hillbilly is loopable. 
---
Unless he's good at curving, you play a loop badly, or you run into a deadzone his one hit down will rarely come into play. If he had 110% he'd suck at high ranks because his power is not a counter to looping.
---
Yes, Hillbilly can sprint around the map at 230% (faster with engravings), but unless you're not paying attention or are in a dead zone, it will not kill you. Just run to a nearby loop and begin looping him. 
---
Just because other Killers suffer from drawbacks to using their power doesn't mean Hillbilly should. His one hit down is baitable, avoidable, AND it does in fact take time to charge up as well as have cooldowns associated with it's use; missing has a cooldown, bumping into a wall has a cooldown, and hitting a Survivor has a cooldown. They are all fairly brief but they can make a big difference and are more punishing than whiffing an M1.
---
A bad Hillbilly will only do well against Survivors that mess up.
---
I do agree Hillbilly has BS hitboxes on dedicated servers, but that's no reason to nerf him.
---
lol ok dumbfuck
---
should've dropped the pallet honestly. if youre gonna troll commit to it

use whatever makes you feel comfortable. it's not bad. I'd swap self care though. it's kind of useless in 2019 if your teammates aren't on the edge of the map the entire game
---
He was moving at least two of the times he got blinded though.
---
Yes because you black pip otherwise
---
Yeah I noticed and don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs missing as it‚Äôs there in her default outfit and the Business 85 one.

There has definately been a few times where at EGC i have gone on a suicide run to get the hooked guy. I always bring borrowed time for just that reason. If i had a good game, i will gladly die for some rando. The game is fun even when you die lol

It‚Äôs just a stupid idea imo. What if I just want to plunder, I‚Äôm basically screwing my teammates from getting DS for running a fun build, and they take the fun away from the build I have since they need to search a chest too.
---
I would love to see perks pixelated!!

If anything The Spirit needs a buff

This seems like a very cool/strong idea. I like it very much, would be very hard to balance I believe though

every time I escape as a survivor and see my dumbfuck teammates teabagging at the exit gates I pray they get yoinked before they manage to escape

Nope, it would appear I haven't posted it how I intended, welp.

I usually only do that when the last one alive was a better player than their teamates who died. Like if I didn't see them all match or they were good at disappearing from Chase's and getting their objectives done.

Looking at you, Freddy and Legion

My thoughts exactly.

The better question is, did you hit your DS.

How far did you scroll and where were you scrolling

Well said. I feel the exact same way about Tru3, as well as Scott Jund's fanbase. If either of them deem something "uncounterable", we are supposed to just accept it because they said so. I'm so sick of Twitch streamers and their ego-stroking echo chamber fanbases. Honestly at this point, I don't like any of the "serious" DBD streamers. I only watch the memers like Demi and Farmer John now. At least they make me laugh.

Borrowed Time is really your best bet though Babysitter may help you. If the killer returns, take hits or try to get teammates to guard them as well. As long as they can last 10 seconds, it should count. Some will die, but that‚Äôs a sacrifice you‚Äôll be willing to make.
---
Alternatively, the challenges are being adjusted next week I believe, and I think that challenge is being reduced to one instead of two so should be much more manageable (aside from everyone else trying to do it).
---
I would just say try not to get found by them, and rank up in other ways. that averts both problems of making them sad by chases, and the problem of them face camping you if they down you
---
This is how the Entity influences acts of violence
---
Well they were going to change it yesterday to one unhook but for some reason said the balance changes they are going to make to the challenges are delayed.
---
They don't need to perform the same; some will have steeper learning curves and higher skill/reward. They should perform similarly at higher ranks, though.
---
Obviously, the balance should be Base vs. Base, then perks should be adjusted so that there is no exceptionally hard meta. But killers playing differently can still only have one of 5 kill totals and one of four pip results; they just get there by different means. Wraith getting 0k every match wouldn't mean he has a different playstyle; it'd mean he's too weak.
---
Didn't state he was. I stated it sounds like him.
---
Id say he more forgiving if they get stuck on a wall,let them run for a sec,if they go for unsafe hook scare them off don't down,stuff like that.Someone did this to me and I learnt.Now I love the game.My old account was lost tho so I'm square one too but I don't want mercy.Id say the same for baby killers.if game goes by fast I'll let him kill me so he has no or farm them with pallets.
---
Killer still takes a little bit. Maybe 10 minutes on a bad day, 1-2 minutes normally. Survivor is always 2-3 minutes and 5 minutes with a 3 stack.

Um.. there is no checkmark on selfcare

Then get devs to fix broken hex spawns and not have Survivors be able to spawn right in the proximity of one and have it cleansed immediately. It hinders the perk useless afterwards especially if your working on Devour Hope stacks.
---
The one that uses xD in 2019 is secretly the killer
---
Not bad for what you have. 
---
As others said, it can be useful to not rely on Self-Care. It takes a long time and encourages more independent play which can easily backfire. In higher ranks, it will hurt more than help you. 
---
Bond is my favorite perk for Survivors and in my opinion is worth it for the team heals, and all the map awareness it gives you. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. 
---
I also see you have We‚Äôll Make It. If you have BT and are looking to be altruistic, it‚Äôs very valuable and lasts for so long. Pair it with Empathy/Bond and you can easily get 1-3 heals out of it. Anytime I get unhooked by someone with WMI, I instantly think they‚Äôre a champion and will go out of my way to try to ensure their escape.
---
What we need is the creature from the black lagoon as a killer
---
Legions strength is to draw the game out a long tiime. No one wants to play a 30 min round that involves half the team mending in a corner at any given time. At high ranks I dont leave my gen against a legion who plans to frenzy hit me and runaway. Gen rush til I have to mend and then back to gen rushing. My advice and the legion I hate uses power to make a first hit before they cancel on top of you to make the down instead of frenzy hit and run away.
---
And if you use the logic from The Thing (2011) prequel, Childs isn't assimilated either because he still has his earring.
---
So Oni is Sans apparently.
---
This is true
---
Right
---
I hate the unhook 2 survivors during the end game collapse challenge.
---
Well, since he gets millions of dollars from microsoft to stream on mixer, he doesnt need the money from subs and donations that much anymore, so he is no longer forced to play the games that brings him the most money, he can just play what he enjoys the most or try new games.
---
On console. I played on Xbox. Plenty of survivors there.
---
well when you start comparing base vs. base then a killers job becomes even easier once you factor out DS and BT, hell a killer like Wraith benefits greatly from that since he's one of the best killers that can capitalize on sloppy saves. Not to mention tons of other variables taken out the equation(Dead Hard, toolboxes, fast heals, Balanced, etc.)
---
Also Wraith isn't getting a 0k every match, that's the thing. That's the whole thing I'm arguing about, EVERY killer isn't getting a 0k every single match, from what I've seen and experienced myself, even in the sweatiest matches a killer is capable of edging out at least a 2k, maybe it would be a black pip, but they aren't getting destroyed in every single red rank match ever.
---
CUTE
---
Ghostface is no billy, spirit, or nurse, but he‚Äôs absolutely on the higher end. I‚Äôd put him in the same box as freddy and a good huntress
---
bc the ruin nurse really deserves Corrupt right after
---
Uh... yeah? it's pretty popular
---
solo survivors are fucked yea in certain scenario
---
That movie was terrible and flopped. Don‚Äôt disrespect the masterpiece of the original by even mentioning that heap
---
You deserve it for wasting shack like that
---
I see nothing wrong. The game is working as intended.
---
I can‚Äôt even get everyone infected. They run away before I can spray them enough and once I catch up and spray them enough, hit them, hook them, 2 or 3 gens are done. I don‚Äôt struggle like this with anyone else
---
When I pull a survivor off a gen with ghostface but my challenge was not accwpted *true story btw*
---
Clowns gas is only a 15% speed reduction which isn't terribly slow, and he also has no map pressure, tracking or stall potential. He is not good and is far outclassed by killers like huntress, Billy and nurse.
---
no
---
That would be broken, but also... so fucking boring. 
---
it would be the most lazy killer in the game. he would add nothing new.
---
It was fine. It wasn't terrible, wasn't great. BHVR should troll everyone by teasing The Thing, and give us the one from the '50s (the original).
---
It is
---
Good point, I have a love-hate relationship with that though 'cause the traps don't arm themselves the way you originally placed them. There is often enough where they arm themselves again only to be misplaced just enough to where they won't trap anyone which sucks
---
Oh gosh. That‚Äôd be terrible
---
This happened to me so much I bound the alternate action key to one on my mouse and having both the working key as M1 and the action button on one hand gets me 9/10 great skill checks
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have if you didn‚Äôt post this so...
---
Because noob hasn‚Äôt been spring for a while but I agree otz is great
---
Yet you don't see survivors mending with legion with nurses.
---
Haha.
---
I guess it was pretty desirable since he had been gone so long
---
Platform: Xbox
---
I cannot get a custom game to work. We'll have 5 people all ready up, it'll go to the loading screen, and then boot everyone out saying "Host Unreachable". It literally doesn't matter who the host is or how many times we try.
---
It would only increase toxicity
---
Fair
---
For that challenge just slug two survivors and then open the gates yourself followed by a hook. Very easy on paper. Bring an endgame build and it‚Äôs not bad at all
---
High risk, high reward. No.
---
If you're having too much trouble with that just M1 them and down them if you think you can, it won't reset their infection and they'll just become broken later. A really good thing to do is use Corrupt and an addon that increases infection time on objects so you can vomit on gens and they either won't be able to do them or the infection countdown will start when they do. That also gives you the bonus of knowing when a gen has been touched.
---
Cursed image
---
Right, which means the perk balance is a mess, with things like DS being broken, but it'd be better to buff Survivors base options first since they lean heavily on the crutch of OP perks. Or it would be, if BHVR hadn't balanced around the presumption of Killers bringing addons, which makes things much harder to calibrate.
---
And remember we're dealing in averages, so what you're seeing is a split of Killers managing 1ks in sweaty games and 3/4ks in games featuring an early kill for any reason, or Killers just being sweatier than survs. Although even a few 0ks are happening, so it's not "at least" anything.
---
Lol exactly.
---
Are you also getting separated after matches?
---
Good answer go put your brain dead comments somewhere else
---
Hex perks are so powerful because they have that risk. The most they will do is give bonus bloodpoints if they are taken down very early or give you a tiny power like larger field of view, nothing substantial
---
So you want to reveal the killer at the start of the game because this shows what the survivors are using even since the killer can see the items in the lobby already?
---
Steve should get his nail bat.
---
If you‚Äôre being serious, it‚Äôs an eye, ear and finger lol
---
You got downvoted for laughing emojis...wtf
---
And you are blocked ;)
