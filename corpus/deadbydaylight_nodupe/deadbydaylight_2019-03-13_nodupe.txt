Yiff in Hell
---
---
---
SWF is bullshit because it negates core game mechanics, it's just as simple as that.
---
The entity has summoned her.
---

---
Add it for both sides or not at all.  NOED is ridiculously strong enough as is but I'm fine with this as long as survivors can see totem count too.
---
My typical perks on a survivor include a combo of bond and prove thyself to max out objective points as quickly as possible and move on to get altruism and boldness points and stack up my WGLF perk.
---
I am still experimenting with the 4th perk, currently, since I am running bond I think it would be nice to be able to heal faster so I run Botany Knowledge.
---
I have experimented with Urban Evasion but it's counterproductive for my combo, I tried 'We'll make it' but half the time survivors been running away after unhooking so I just scream internally.
---
I tried Lithe and Balanced Landing but to be fair I've learned to play without exhaustion perks and adjusting my gameplay to these two perks is just too much work. I tried Alert but as much as it is nice to know where the killer is or if he's in a chase I didn't find a practical use for it, perhaps if I was to play with a flashlight I could theoretically go after the killer when Alert activates rather than chase after killer hoping he will down someone for a flashlight save.
---
I think I will give kindred a try especially now since the rank reset is happening on the 13th and I think it might be useful since during rank reset I find myself playing with really scared survivors. 
---
I don‚Äôt think OP is the petty one in this situation... ü§î
---
Be Dwight 
---
man, that's amazing!! worth all the hours you put into it imo
---
Just as long as there is a new perk or offering that lets this David kick the shit out the Legion for 5 mins. 
---
Breaking totems takes huuuge amounts of time for a fairly small possibilty of noed. Almost 90% of red rank survivors wont waste time searching for and breaking totems in my experience, and rightfully so.
---
Felix isn't a furry tho
---
thank you
---
legion is supposed to be used to injure as many survivors as possible
---
but that isnt the best way to play her 
---
what you want to do is use him to tunnel 1 player at a time 
---
she is the best killer at tunneling 
---
hit them once while in frenzy. back off a bit to end the chase and then just look down and follow the scratch marks since you are looking at the ground the chase wont trigger so you can follow them. leaving them in a position they cant get out of. if they stop to mend you will catch up and down them with a normal attack. if they keep running the deep wound timer will run out downing them anyway
---
Of course Meg is pointing and of course the Totem is right beside the hook.
---
[removed]
---
WAKE ME UP!
---
*stabs someone*
---
WAKE ME UP INSIDE!
---
I'm okay with it. I prefer another perk to be used other then the usual that we always see lol
---
Literally why does this even exist? In any game? r/Overwatch devs said that basically no one rated matches in Overwatch, except when people lost where they'd give the match 1 star.
---
Honestly haven't gotten to end game in like 7 matches so noed is a waste on me
---
This community has NO chill omfg hahahaha
---
That's true for most killers, though.  SWF is a bloody pox on this game.
---
Bold of you to assume im a survivor main just because i dont like some killer perks. 
---
Spirit got feet like Ryu
---
No, it's right
---
Maybe don't feed the infinite tier 3 Myers?
---
Equipping Franklin's isn't sweaty, lol.
---
And yet again it complement the game mechanics with other type of interactions as well. All and all, the game would be very different without it and probably much less people would be playing it by now. I'm still playing dbd after all this time mostly because I can have a meaningful co-op in this game
---
YES!!
---
*Fucking Jake Park...*
---
The hunt ress
---
Cool, Common Map Offerings! A Red Forest one and something else.
---
I suppose it's better that they're gone (less clutter in the bloodweb) but I still like the idea of them.
---
This and Pink and Common Perks are things I wish I'd been able to experience in DbD.
---
I doubt your teacher had a discord server for it.
---
Yeah, The Spirit‚Äôs got one of those stories that is a real head scratcher but makes more since in the context of The Entity simply knows mind control and people pay more for sexy killers.
---
My efforts in life
---
YIFF. 
---
IN.
---
HELL.
---
Thats why I use Whispers
---
Decisive comes out on shrine as soon as it's about to be nerfed. Nice 
---
yeah! I needed dev hope 
---
It's definitely a nerf. 
---
Nice, I needed DS and Iron Will.
---
Because its rank 8?
---
Iron will and Devour Hope! Yes please
---
Why are these comments the dumbest actual shit people could say
---
Good
---
Waahhhh!!!
---
Lmao, that's hilarious. 
---
This is bad because Kate will frequently be getting slashed by the glass shards sticking out of the spirit... she‚Äôs also dead.
---
if you want to be in lesbian with someone, make sure they‚Äôre alive
---
&gt; What are you even on abou
---
I'm asking you the same question. I'm seriously at a loss of what the hell you're talking about. You haven't pointed out how I was being hypocritical or how I was being a "douche". 
---
I'm just trying to understand your poor attempt at an insult. 
---
You lost all credibility at 'NOED is fine'.
---
Maybe we could not with the "trap" nonsense pls and thx
---
Dwight didn‚Äôt wash his hands after he finished his pizza
---
According to who? You? Lmao.
---
How does not using noed make me a baby killer main lmao
---
This pallet looks massive 
---
DS is literally useless after the nerf. 
---
For me and my friends it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only game like it (as far as I know) and the downsides IMO don‚Äôt put weight the upsides. It‚Äôs still scary at moments, requires actual teamwork and losing really isn‚Äôt THAT detrimental 
---
&gt;Decisive comes out on shrine as soon as it's about to be nerfed. Nice
---
DS is being reworked, not nerfed. People also said Borrowed Time was being nerfed and the updated version ended up being way better and more balanced than the old one. Current version even has the Deep Wound mechanic which consequently made BT stronger. 
---
I never bothered to use DS before but I might start using it from now on because in some aspects, DS is better than it was. 
---
I can hit them through Ruin pretty easily, but when there's a survivor working with me I tend to choke on the pressure.
---
where's the lie
---
You look like you‚Äôre annoying
---
&gt;DS is literally useless after the nerf.
---
In some specific scenarios, DS will be stronger than before. What are you on about? 
---
Thank you very much! I going to unlock all the perks now I'm going to try spirit fury+ Enduring+ BBQ+ Ruin for my wraith even if he's not a "top tier" killer I find it very fun to play with those jumpscares!
---
Should I prestige to get all the perks in the same build or just keep doing bloodwebs until I get all of them?
---
Except you're just pulling that number out of the air. I play at red ranks and see survivors break totems frequently, and it really doesn't take huge amounts of time
---
It's borrowed time but you don't have to rely on the rng of another person having running a specific perk. I wouldn't call it useless.
---
Sure. 
---
It can be a fun gamble 
---
Weak
---
*laughs in small game* 
---
They do have a point though; people aren't on this subreddit for this type of content. And they didn't say to remove it, just to add a nsfw tag. 
---
Honestly a very good shrine. I've been waiting for Devour Hope for a while. 
---
Your never done with pixel art it just creeps back into your mind bit by bit 
---
Unless you are experiencing bugs that I‚Äôve not experienced or seen a single complaint about, you aren‚Äôt getting blinded in half of these situations from where you think you are or are blatantly lying. If the latter is the case then I don‚Äôt know what to tell ya. If it‚Äôs the former, make sure you are actually staring at the wall or perform a fake pick up to make survivors run to you and then either chase them away and pick up right away or get a free hit.
---
You're very talented. Well done!
---
Goodnite, sweet prince
---
Probably middle of next week. 
---
She looks like a measured killer. 
---
Agreed. I love going to their streams and saying Hi after a game. Oh yeah I was the Spirit.
---
Oh man lol
---
Yesterday we had a swf match and we absolutely destroyed this poor nurse...
---
She didn‚Äôt even down one of us if I recall..
---
At the end I wouldn‚Äôt leave and tried to get her to kill me for points but end the end she wouldn‚Äôt kill me...
---
We had a literal death standoff lol, finally she shook her head no for the last time and I just went ahead and ran out...  however, letting her hit me a couple times and giving chase points during this gave her enough points to safety pip (I would assume, no way she deranked ) 
---
Still no BBQ lmao
---
I know, just joking
---
Buy Leatherface dlc. Use BBQ and Chili and just grind it out. Get Huntress Dlc. Get David King. Farm your potato teammates with WGLF. PRAY. 
---
Damn it Dwight 
---
It's the perspective, actually. I actually didn't notice that while making this, but he does look tiny compared to the massive pallet.
---
*Change some words for instant nsfw*
---
Hag, Nurse, Spirit, and Billy work best with it imo. 
---
Feelsbadman :'(
---
Because this is happening at higher ranks.
---
I think this will be possible sometime in summer or near end of this year when dedicated servers are out. 
---
That's (one reason) why I run whispers
---
I just played against a wraith with Haunted Ground, Ruin, and Make Your Choice with BBQ thrown in and we got utterly destroyed.
---
More like ‚ÄúFreddy isn‚Äôt complete shit‚Äù
---
Enduring doesn‚Äôt reduce that stun. It only reduces pallet and DS stuns. 
---
Yeah in general, huntresses is usually better than ruin because it also tells you where they are because they usually fuck up the skill checks
---
I don‚Äôt get why people do that. Don‚Äôt they spend most of the match exhausted?
---
I was hearing that new DS is unaffected by enduring as well.
---
Shouldn't there top one say "Okay, maybe I'm straight" or am I missing the joke?
---
It is very much a nerf, it's more situational and for some reason they've felt the need to decrease the stun by 1 second while it's still affected by enduring.
---
You have to shine it in their eyes. I have never been able to manage it ever after playing a a few years lol
---
this IS AMAZING
---
I love Legion, but..
---
People hate his Frank‚Äôs Mixtape add-on (it‚Äôs OP) and his moonwalking exploit (only scumbags do this). And then a bunch of other people jumped on the bandwagon and decided that Feral Frenzy makes him the worst thing that ever happened to the game.
---
With that out of the way, here‚Äôs some tips:
---
His biggest strength is keeping the whole team injured/mending with Feral Frenzy. When he lands a frenzy hit, he can see the heartbeats of nearby survivors. This allows him to chain his attacks, and force multiple people to go mend/heal. This will keep them off of generators and their crying will make them easy to hear.
---
Down the survivors that are caught out of position, and always patrol your generators, especially the 3 that are close together. As the map gets smaller, Legion‚Äôs power becomes more effective.
---
A lot of perks work well on him, but there are 3 that I always use:
---
-Monitor &amp; Abuse was tailor made for Legion. It shrinks his already small terror radius, allowing him to sneak up on people. Once a chase begins, it expands his larger Feral Frenzy terror radius, allowing him to see more survivor heartbeats.
---
-Sloppy Butcher is especially good on Legion because he injures entire groups with ease. They all have to a perform a mend and then a lengthy heal.
---
-Thanatophobia is a perk that Legion makes better use of than any other killer. Since he excels at keeping the whole team injured, he‚Äôll stay at 4 stacks, slowing the game down. This perk also got a major buff in the PTB.
---
Some other good perks are: Bloodhound, Ruin, Distressing, Nurses Calling, Stridor, Franklin‚Äôs Demise, BBQ, and Remember Me.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Love it
---
Looking forward to it, honestly think it'll feel like a whole new game without a lot of the lag problems!
---
Nice artwork. Will you be adding color in a future post?
---
Having a hard time classifying her. ‚ÄúProduct of her environment‚Äù or ‚ÄúGot a raw deal?‚Äù I usually classify ‚Äúraw deal‚Äù as killers who started out more as victims and she doesn‚Äôt quite match that criteria. At the same time, ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù implies their surroundings fostered killing intent and that isn‚Äôt quite right either. I‚Äôm more inclined to put her in ‚Äúraw deal‚Äù because she seems more like Hag and Spirit than Doctor and Leatherface. 
---
&gt;I was hearing that new DS is unaffected by enduring as well.
---
There is that too.
---
People are on crack if they think DS is being nerfed. Either that or they are just too inexperienced to actually see the benefits provided by the new DS. 
---
If you have time to search them and break em and dont get absolutely demolished doing so , im happy for you. I highly doubt cleaning all totems is viable against high skilled killers, and i dont mean just rank 1, i mean legit skilled killers
---
Nah. True ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù are good at killer.
---
That's not the devs problem though. But anyways the new update made ranking harder so there ya go.
---
If I see a dull totem I cleanse it, but I don;t have time to run around a map and search for all totems which by the way are to be improved more and more. When you're playing solo you don;t know how many totems your teammates has destroyed. By the time you're running around and searching for dull totems because "killer maybe has NOED", pallets are being broken, survivors are being downed etc etc. Time is important for both sides in this game.  
---
It's not even about this perk having a counterplay or not. DS has so-called counterplays as well(juggling, enduring, dropping into a basement). Those two perks are just stupid and they reward you for playing badly.   
---
I almost alwayst know that killer has NOED cause he's playing like an idiot, no mind-games, just following survivors like a headless chicken, chasing one survivor for 4 gens etc etc. And those people are in red ranks because of NOED and cry about survivors being toxic because they loop them(I know a lot ofsurvivors are toxic, but it's not looping that's toxic). Players who play so badly shouldn't get any kills IMO, they should be punished by loosing.  
---
Oh the irony!!! XD
---
This made me laugh out loud. I‚Äôm sorry
---
DS was reworked, not nerfed.
---
My last perk is bbq too, it's a crazy good build
---
r/cringe
---
Can you selling this or making like a accesories to key ?
---
Yay, no need to level up Jake.
---
oh my god ur right
---
this is the best music taste
---
You might as well go for it; much less effort than levelling up Laurie, and it will be cheaper to just get it from the shrine if you don‚Äôt already have her.
---
Does anyone know why this could happen?
---
I... okay
---
This is awesome!!!
---
I think Territorial Imperative may be the perk you're looking for.
---
Shrine of secrets only shows the level 1 version of the perk, the other tiers come with higher level versions of the perk 
---
I wish you were playing when flashlights actually used to be broken 
---
Shrine of secrets doesn't show you the full perk description
---
Unless you're using Father's Glasses, you can't see blood whilst haunting. Bloodhound would only show blood when you're just walking normally. If you're having difficulty tracking in the haunt, replace Bloodhound with Predator to make the scratchmarks more consistent. 
---
I mean its not like its never been in the shrine before like bbq lol
---
Muda
---
I bet this will end up being the kind of perk that's in the shrine every other week that no one wants. Iron will and devour hope is good.
---
man imagine thinking bamboozle is necessary 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Wasn't sure if it was the case for this perk. Thank you very much
---
 A Hex rooting its power on hope. The false hope of Survivors ignites your hunger.
---
When a Survivor is rescued from a Hook at least **24 metres** away, *Devour Hope* receives a Token.

---
I know.  I am play Freddy.
---
Probably next Tuesday
---
That doesnt work. 
---
When you puke, you "shoot" like 50 "bullets" per load. The puke you see is the bullets connected with lines. But only the actually bullet hits the survivor. The lines which connect the bullets dont have any effect. 
---
DS was quite heavily nerfed.
---
Oh no
---
Your normal and alt account downvoted me
---
You must feel like a god
---
Or it's the other way and t-bagging is here because of killers camp, tunnel and taking the game hostage. Both sides can be toxic or play fair, voice comms have nothing to do with that directly. If you're a jerk, it doesn't matter either you play killer or survivor, solo or in a team
---
Proof here that DBD likes to meme.
---
Imagine if hitting a hooked survivor fully replenished their sacrifice meter 
---
I came here only to write this so have an updoot instead.

I wasn‚Äôt trying to trick you Scott
---
And even if the BS swf doesn't get you, the fact that there's noone in your rank bracket outside of free weekend will make sure you a get few semi-pro flashlight baggers. 
---
I am getting that ds üòÜ
---
Well to be fair, legit high skilled killers generally aren't running noed and at 0k when the gates get powered anyway 
---
*oh i'm feeling it*
---
i'm gonna ***use ds oh god oh fuck don't let me be one of them***
---
Yeah, the shrines are totally ‚Äúrandom‚Äù lol
---
Just aim for the face, it takes like 2 seconds until the killer is blinded.
---
You can see if you do it correct when the beam of the flashlight is getting tighter.
---
Well, I‚Äôm happy for you that you know who you are, friend :)
---
Ramona, I‚Äôm in lesbians with you
---
*seriously tho can we get Ramona Flowers as a survivor*
---
Nurse
---
It's not bad when you run it with botany knowledge. 
---
And thats what i mean , i always assume his high skilled, no time for fuckery like cleaning totems.
---
It is if everyone is playing for fun. 
---
I haven't had issues with killers disconnecting, but in the 4ish hours I played earlier I had at least one survivor dc ever single match. Either they didnt like the map or they did something dumb. I feel like this has come about with the big "rank is pointless" flood. Everyone's dcing nowadays 
---
How much would you charge?
---
Hag, Nurse. Pretty much it.
---
You can try it on others but these two benefit the most, as Hag can keep the totem somewhat safe/is far away from the hook ideally and Nurse has a lot of mobility.
---
Some might say Billy but he already has an instadown, so it's not really that good on him.
---
It does
---
If you have a good headset it should be easy to follow injured survivors, you dont even need stridor for that. I personally get fucked by stridor coz of the noices beeing louder I always think the survivors are closer than they really are.
---
Also pay attention to the grass/corn moving to track survivors.
---
Yup this sums it up every time, but I can‚Äôt see myself punching my 55‚Äù flat screen, not for this game... 
---
I‚Äôve been saying for a while a DBD killer would work well in Terror Drome or MK
---
Why are you downvoting this? He just gave the source?
---
Dummy thicc
---
A fan made horror fighting game featuring every horror icon ever pretty much also there‚Äôs a sequel coming but with monsters like mummies and stuff 
---
Where is Claudette? I only see 3 earrings.
---
Same 
---
In what aspect is it better?? It is a huge nerf. I do believe it needed one, but there is no way this one is arguably better
---
I've recorded 6 video clips of people cheating and some other of people abusing glitches and I haven't gotten a response to any of them, honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they're dead buttons. 
---
Okay, but "Diary of Jane" by Breaking Benjamin and "Animal I've Become" by Three Days Grace
---
(Joe claimed dibs on "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mud)
---
It's not going to be a meta perk but I'm going to use it when I'm tired of getting shafted by tunneling killers. I be able to use and not feel like a dirt bag, only reason I don't use it now.
---
Feeling Pukeish.
---
Respecting pallets is so 2017
---
But then you can just take a medkit with bonus charges and you have another perk slot.
---
Getting DS now is BS
---
Just like every killer, wraith is a monster when built and played properly
---
Its random
---
Or other people have correctly assessed that "situational perk that might help if your team actively farm you or you fuck up and get downed immediately after coming off a hook" is objectively inferior to "a free escape", and you're just a moron? 
---
Urban dictionary:
---
**P**rogrammed **R**andom **OC**curance.
---
How is it *not* being nerfed? I understand the situational benefits of the new DS, but literally having a free get-away after being downed no matter the situation is still far superior. The killer could easily slug to ensure they aren't affect by the new DS, again, literally making it useless.
---
&gt;Tunneled when being rescued from the basement? DS away.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Tunneled when exit gates are opened? DS away.  
---
&gt;Tunneled at any point during the match? DS away.
---
These three still stand for the old DS.
---
&gt; They removed the only two "counter-ish" that DS had which were dribbling and hook proximity. They removed the awareness that killers had when at least 1 DS was in play. 
---
That's because DS is now only specific to being tunneled. If they hand't have changed that, it wouldn't be a good anti-tunnel perk at all.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it.
---
:D
---
I don't know why, but I had to laugh. :D
---
Is it possible to avoid using your exhaustion perk on console? Eg. Running without always using sprint burst. I believe on pc u can but I‚Äôm not sure on console. 
---
Procedure, think of it as activation due to a certain set of criteria
---
I originally made these as keychains!
---
I made them as earrings as a secondary!
---
I also sell more of these as keychains than anything else.
---
By the third or fourth gen it's normally not too hard to determine if the killer is high skilled and effectively pressuring survivors.
---
I do it everygame to get more chase and escape points!
---
M8, klaut is right. The plague is a murderer. She hunted down those who sought out medicine, then tortured and killed them as heretics. She is the reason the plaugue started and spread in the first place. She new what she was doing and enjoyed it. 
---
&gt; It just went from a time waster perk to a anti-tunneling perk.
---
Its both now :)
---
Same. Unless the Killer doesn't come to the exit gate in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Haha yeah. It doesn't make much a difference to me to be fair as i bought all the DLCs anyway
---
Claudette is *supposed* to be on the top right corner, and opposite to the DBD logo.
---
Her face must have rubbed off or something? 
---
It‚Äôs called performance anxiety. The good news is that there is a pill for that. Ask your doctor if  Cialis is right for you. 
---
I can't wait for the rework then. He's decent now and waiting to hit isn't always bad. People usually take a second to react and notice they are being pulled in. I just trail behind them or in some cases right in front of them backwards if i have the speed add on and the add on to not see me in transitions. 
---
Where's the love for my boy, Adam??  Ya'll sleeping on him.  I have some great gameplay of killers coming up on me while I'm working on a generator, kicking it, and leaving me crouched motionless before I resume my activities. xD
---
Oh, I think I see her now. Sorry, it must have been the tall grass.
---
you cant
---
He is a lot stronger now, I think people that don't play him just don't realise how much his built-in windstorm and awesome redone addons help him. He's not S tier (only Billy, nurse and spirit are actually competitive versus the best survivor teams), but he's probably not literal bottom, worse-than-freddy at rank 1 any more. 
---
I know. :P
---
Nah, I think it's the fact that the stain is darker than the super bright background. 
---
I should retake the picture with a LOT of lighting. Maybe she would be more visible then?
---
Soon(tm)
---
I couldn't possibly dumb it down any more for you. I have seen your comments before and see that you have a way of making yourself look like a condescending douche nozzle. Going to go with that advice and block you. Have a nice day being an absolute dolt.
---
Mained spirit ever since she came out, do very well with her, to me she is the second best killer in the game behind nurse, yes even better than hillbilly (but people get triggered when you say that)
---
Tips:
---
Something that can help you while you're still trying to get you phasing down is fake vaults. From the survivor's perspective, the spirit does not have a vault animation, she stands still and teleports to the other side. So if you stand still at the window, you can make survivors think you are vaulting.
---
Something to keep in mind while phasing, focus on audio as much as possible to hear where survivors are going, listen for footsteps and breathing
---
You can still see/hear survivors disturbing grass while phasing, pay attention to the grass
---
When phasing/fake phasing at a pallet, try to stand in the pallet, this way they take the risk of running into you if you're faking if they try to loop the pallet
---
If you're phasing and the scratch marks suddenly stopped, they either stopped and started walking, or turned around, use your ears/intuition to try and determine which way they went, this takes a lot of practice but you'll get better at it, even I still mess up on this sometimes
---
If you can get a hit without using your power, do it. It is far easier to track injured survivors while phasing, since you can now hear their groaning in addition to their footsteps.
---
Be sure to use your power to get around the map as well, keep up the map pressure!
---
Hopefully these tips were helpful, I'm actually currently working on a spirit guide video which I will post to the subreddit, just need to stop being lazy and finish it XD. Good luck and keep practicing with her, she's a blast and super strong :)
---
&gt;Billy cant really curve without add ons
---
Not true. You have (as far as I can tell) free control over your camera within the first (about) 1 second of the chainsaw. (It's specifically until he brings his chainsaw to maximum height in your view).
---
I play on console (low max sensitivity) so I don't know if it's actually "free" control. You can easily do a 180 before you're locked out of your control.
---
Pink Add-Ons in general make the game lopsided. I don‚Äôt support them but they‚Äôre not going anywhere
---
Am going to dribble every survivor after new update :p
---
Skill checks are not hard to hit. That lessens the skill gap, but does not make the perk better for those who can hit their skill checks.
---
They nerfed the stun time, so sure, enduring doesn't affect it, but the stun time was nerfed, so why does that matter? Now it is less effective more often than not, and even when they have enduring, it is probably around the same, maybe a little better now.
---
Sure, if you get downed on a hook it's good... the second time. What if you get downed on the hook the first time? SOL. With old DS, you just had to be downed far enough from the hook either time for it to matter, now it is just one hook. 
---
If you like playing stealth Adam's pebble perk (while a meme) is fun as hell.
---
For me it‚Äôs because I want someone with all the perks so I have a lot of build options. Right now I‚Äôm running spirit and I‚Äôve dumped a ton of points into her because I like having variety more than a skin I‚Äôll never see
---
Agree. Even if the killer slugs and camps the body for 60 seconds thats time wasted and a much higher risk of a coordinated group still saving the survivor.
---
tl;dr the Wraith's power is mostly a hindrance in the chase and a fairly good buff outside the chase; helps the killer, not the killing.
---
In a reply, I mentioned captioning the post with a quick explanation as to why it‚Äôs labeled NSFW. Something like ‚Äú(insert animal) death warning‚Äù. Again, it‚Äôs not ideal, but there‚Äôs no other way to go about regulating whether or not people end up watching something they didn‚Äôt want to see on the subreddit.
---
Like you said, people will still click on it regardless of the NSFW tag, which is why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to tag it as NSFW with a warning.
---
I thought the picture was mighty darn close so I figured eh why not
---
If you get to 5 tokens and then someone breaks the totem, do you still get the benefits? Or do you lose all your tokens once it is broken?
---
Don't worry, I only found this out after like 1500 Hrs. Granted, Freddy only released when I had like 1500 hrs, but still.
---
The killers dont want such a paltry amount of BP though. Just leave. The time you spent waiting would be better spent getting into another game.
---
They should make it so that the person he can insta kill is the person that he built up the most of his stalk meter on
---
Mmmm, rub that salt in the wound
---
"Going to go with that advice and block you. Have a nice day being an absolute dolt."
---
Do us both a favor, yeah? Fuck off.
---
Imo:
---
Adrenaline, although super annoying, is fine
---
WGLF needs change. I think the best change for it is you get 20% faster unhooking or something among these lines.
---
Noed change is too weak. It's basically a discount remember me. If it's going to get changed, it needs something else. I saw some good ideas for it but I don't remember them
---
Enduring is fine
---
Hex ruin just needs some totem improvements. Better totem spawns, perhaps letting the killer pick its spot or something. Other than that it's fine 
---
move on to the next match, forget 
---
*laughs in huntress*
---
Exhaustion is my natural state of being. 
---
I need sleep 
---
Less toxic? No not at all it would still be pretty damn toxic. But games would take even longer to find a match even for killer and survivors lobby jumping would be a big problem. also we prob would not have half the license killers we have now because the devs would have not made as much cash. 
---
i didn‚Äôt even know that thing existed. i realize it was there he whole time now that i see it. this thing is actually on a whole new hilariously low level of uselessness.
---
it was probably supposed to give the devs information about what killers, perks and maps cause what levels of fun, but why is it in such a hard to see spot, like why would you ever design something that way?
---
If the devs couldn't add a resolution option in setting by now, than probably not.
---
It's actually because ranking is easy on both sides.
---
Agreed.

---
So start leveling Adam. Thanks man :)
---
I would say just keep doing bloodwebs, as starting from scratch will likely take even longer, and all you get from prestige is the 1 piece of bloody clothing, while Wraith has some of the best cosmetics. Have fun!
---
Sigh, I literally just unlocked DH. All I need is BBQ even tho Im not gonna use it. Need for BP farm builds every once in a while.
---
I try not to get to end game with freddy but if you do noed probably won't help much. Itd be nice for everyone to get pulled into the dream world once all generators are done. 
---
reverse it and you have the truth
---
Tbh i dont feel like they are that strong. The piece is definetly better than the pink one (when your not going against total potatoes), but the amount of stalk it requires is still very high.
---
I have never been tombstoned before and usually im the one tombstoning, but whenever i feel like myers has cornered me and potentialy might have the tombstone, i just find something close to me that i can "activate". Myers is gonna one-shot me anyway, might as well play it safe and deny him the kill. I wonder why survivors dont do it more often. Literally anything from vaulting to breaking a totem will deny him the kill.
---
That being said, i understand it might be a bit annoying. 
---
Iron grasp is free though, some people don‚Äôt want to level up trapper. 
---
I didn‚Äôt mind it because shit agitation is fun
---
You can move on.
---
To be honest I have no idea, I'd say if you just google "reee" it should tell you a lot more than I could
---
Why the fuck you lookin like a cryptid.
---
Scaring me.
---
Not the killers fault survivors can‚Äôt stay out of their line of sight
---
Also take note that he can‚Äôt mori you if you are in a locker I managed to jump into one to avoid getting mori and he was forced to hook me and I was able to escape and win the match.
---
Another thing to take note is that some of them might try to wait for you t leave the locker waiting time letting your teammates do gens and lowering his power meter
---
BBQ when only appear once they nerf it to be useless
---
If you think the shrine of secrets is completely random, then I bet you also think casinos are completely random
---
Yeeeah Charlie caaandy mountain
---
Wym?
---
What, you don't only play killer?
---
I think you're on the wrong sub.
---
Survivors also make a loud grunt when they get in a locker, it's pretty audible and especially if it doesn't come where you could have dropped off something, I'd be checking lockers.
---
Decisive Strike
---
Iron Will
---
Overwhelming Presence
---
Hex: Devour Hope
---
I can get 4K below rank 10 with the wraith. Use bloodhound and then just uncloak around a corner then surprise hit the survivor then just sit back and follow the blood trail.
---
What makes you say that?
---
Telling it how it is.
---
Xbox players are awful. I don't know how many salty messages i have dodge but its probably a lot. 
---
People keep saying the shrine is random. It's not.
---
Damn dude I‚Äôve never heard someone Ree this much from an opinion lol
---
This one does not spark joy
---
yaassss &lt;3
---
The shrine is not random so they won't give away top tier perks. 
---
His power can absolutely be helpful in chases with windstorm and swift hunt addons. There's a lot of power in being able to keep survivors away from loops, plus the lunge on decloaking can get you around short loops.
---
He's no Spirit or Hag, but proper use of his power can give you a doctor-like ability to shutdown loops with the map pressure of a slower but infinitely more maneuverable Billy. Plus the ability to get that first hit around when most chases start.
---
Except you know, you're not actually murdering people.
---
That‚Äôs not bad coming from her
---
I don't really have a problem with flashlights, but last week I had my head against a wall on the yamaoka estate and got blinded by a survivor that wasn't anywhere near my screen.
---
Ive never seen a good hag though. I always get paired up with hags that never killer more than one person. I rest easy when i see a hag. 
---
Jane wishes lol
---
Isnt DH top tier?
---
Problem is that it just isn't true. Everyone knows the current ranking is terrible because people who should be rank 10 make it to rank 1 due to the fact that they have basic knowledge of the game, not even their skill. If rank 1 was just cause of swf, how come I don't go against swf every time? Or how come if i do go against swf, they're so bad on multiple occasions that I can't tell they're swf? Not adding up.
---
I think the devs said that. Not sure tbh, but it really seems like certain perks have a greater rarity than others.
---
Oh god they stole my kidneys 
---
Who‚Äôs crazy ass looking troll foot is that
---
Another good stealth perk is Jeff's distortion, as it allows you to hide from aura-detection perks like BBQ and Nurse's Calling. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with bbq? The aura reading is so rarely useful it‚Äôs just a bloodpoint perk
---
....More like Susie‚Äôs Mixtape 
---
Wow this is so fucking cool, have you got an Instagram or something where I can see more of your stuff?
---
The report is a dead button. I mean they even tell you how to report someone if they're cheating...and it doesn't include the report button.
---
So what you're saying is that you don't understand what "literally" means. Got it.
---
Well. Fuck.
---
Devour Hope - Decent.
---
Overwhelming Presence - Unnerving Presence's hobo brother nobody likes.
---
Iron Will - Decent.
---
Decisive Strike - HOMERSCREAM.MP3
---
I know almost every totem spawn, but with small game i can pinpoint exactly where it is or whether searching somewhere is a waste of time. Sometimes I am even legitimately surprised by a spawn location. With increasing ruin, lullaby, and NOED builds it is a huge time saver. Time is probably the most precious asset for both killers and survivors, and i believe it‚Äôs the key to winning or losing. 
---
I like running it because sometimes I don‚Äôt have another perk I‚Äôd rather run. But yeah it‚Äôs pretty average - it takes longer than healing by a teammate, but at least you can do it by yourself
---
Please do.
---
Hi all, just started playing during last week's shrine and picked up Bamboozle/Adrenaline. I was thinking of getting DS, but I've seen a couple comments here mention a rework/nerf. What is it being changed to? 
---
i feel bad for the people who get DS lmao
---
I agree and I understand the difficulty in having a decent ranking system in dbd. I cannot say how I'd rework it myself. However, it should be one of the devs top priorities to rework it. They keep pumping chapters and honestly the experience isn't getting any better. I'm ready for a better ranking system!!
---
If 2 people use different map offerings its 50/50
---
Brb gonna run a very rare add on every game and say the killer is good. 
---
Honestly, killer viability should be decided using, at most, Green add ons. Even those if you main them you can run out of if you use them a lot. But purple/pink add ons are the nice cherry on top of a sundae, not the main course. 
---
This is why i love spirit art
---
um Um UM

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
DH is not a paid character perk tho
---
That doesn‚Äôt specify self heal 
---
&gt; Also Hill Billy has vertical slice which encourages use even in close quarter
---
I can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôre saying here. Are you implying billy has a better chainsaw at closer range because he swings vertically? Because that‚Äôs just not true. You can make an argument for him having the better close range saw with instant add ons, but bubba‚Äôs swinging doesn‚Äôt clip things next to you that billy wouldn‚Äôt. Furthermore you can actually turn with it which makes close range jukes risky to impossible. 
---
If that‚Äôs not what you meant then this comment is pointless
---
If you are even mildly facing away from the wall they can blind you. My suspicion would the you weren‚Äôt staring straight into the wall and you were looking at an angle. 
---
You say that, and yet even the best players can't just find Ruin whenever they want, or Devour whenever they want. So im inclined to disagree, ontop of I play hex hag plenty, and there are games where my totems are just never found.
---
The Dwights have found their new locker
---
I don't have Jeff, maybe I will buy the DLC when it comes on sale, thanks mate :)
---
Aww that's so cute and cool, happy birthday!
---
Omg I need this fighting game lol
---
I dont think playing the game and having someone give up in that game should make me farm because someone is. Bad 
---
Thank you for the BP.
---
- the other survivors
---
Actually with WGLF it's an extra 100% :P But yeah, farmers really erk me too.
---
Yes.
---
The point is to keep players from getting up to ranks they DO NOT BELONG IN.
---
I, as much as I actually like the challenge and responsibilities of being a rank 1 killer, wouldn't mind getting there slowly while I do some fun shit with rank 10s.
---
I once sat in the basement as T1 Myers until all the gens popped and still PIPPED on the old system. I got 1 chase, 1 hook, and 1 death without seeing anyone else. That's not right. 
---
I only get it to work when I run spirit with haunted ground and no other hexes. People are too scared to cleanse totems and don't realize one is DH until too late. Did get a full 4k with Hag on it once though, what a match.
---
I mean if you care for time efficiency, you shouldn't even be doing totems prior to finishing generators.
---
It's much more time efficient to finish the generators first. If your team is not in a hard spot when finishing the last gen, you can opt to do the totems since you have more breathing room. If not, you pop the generator, some people get healed with adrenaline.
---
If the killer isn't running Noed then doing totems would have been a waste of time. If the killer does have Noed then searching for 1 lit hex totem while the killer chases/hooks/camps one guy will also take less time. 
---
It's about fun, engaging matches, and not about rushing a 4 man escape.
---
Though, we could use incentives for making sure others live as well. 
---
... you‚Äôre special, little friend. 
---
In my opinion, i think Adiris could think the Entity is the god they‚Äôve been praying to. I could be over-analyzing, but the way she walks in the game, she probably enjoys killing, because maybe she thinks she‚Äôs pleasing her god. She sees this as no more than carrying out commands.

---
ha lol
---
Almost the same picture got posted at the same time 
---
yeah thats what I normally do just this time I was talking to my brother and turn back to see KYS and u suk, jeez. Thanks for the kind words tho
---
It also sucks when you try to hook someone and this happens
---
You... really haven't grasped the point of this post. 
---
THAT'S RIGHT 
---
She doesn't have much gen pressure but great in chase. I just really like playing her though and got all my points ready to spend on her. She is FAR from Legion, have no fear
---
It's me! üòÜ I wish I can change my Reddit name. Thank you for linking.
---
Well, then you're either lucky or you rank low. Because my damn Ruin never seems to last all that long. üò≠
---
Shroud? No. There wasn't.
---
&gt;That might make it too complicated, and sometimes killers blocking windows or pallets is a valid tactic, sleazy, but, it's valid. That might be affected, no doubt. 
---
I have some doubts that anyone would block a window or pallet for 30 seconds.
---
It sucks how "unfriendly" this game is to new survivors. When I first started playing I would frequently verse rank 15-10s (I still do even now that I'm rank 9!). And when I started to rank up I would also start to verse rank 18-20s...they need to fix this up asap.
---
all i do is WGLF with BT. i think i'm doing them a favor, no? better than when you're left there. ever think they're actually trying to help you? the only thing they may need is BT, if they don't already have and use it.
---
I love these dbd and rpdr crossovers, they give me the life the entity steals from me
---
I think we're under-estimating the patience of some toxic players.
---
Also I am pretty sure I misinterpreted what *Dezere* said in the first place.
---
i just wish they had more of the 2500 options, where you get 250k bps instead of just 150k for 2000.
---
Trapper, maybe? Bloody Cleaver is arguably the best looking bloody weapon. 
---
HAA!
---
I dont think I've laughed harder at any gif than this one
---
HUUAAAHH......... HAH!!!
---
that could certainly be good, especially if you run the fragrant tuft of hair with it so you can use all the gained time to fully charge that ability, also yes, currently discordance is better at rank 1 than rank 3 since at rank 1 you will get a notification if people are continuing work together on a gen after only 8 seconds whereas there is a delay of 12 seconds on rank 3 between notifications
---
I feel ya. I've been screwed over several times, mostly by P3 Deranking Claudettes.
---
Why would I be complaining about hook farming if they had borrowed time? It's not farming if you're giving them a chance to escape, it's only farming if you unhook knowing they are absolutely fucked and have no chance.
---
Sounds like a News Headline. 
---
Was there any offering of any kind like that?
---
He looks so sad! Aww
---
TIL people actually spend shards on bloodpoints
---
Great cosplay! This almost made me not hate legion,so that must be a good sign!
---
^This guy's got you, sorry. Urban Dictionary is undoubtedly a valid source of definitions!
---
I never knew how much i needed this until now 
---
His play style is pretty similar to Hag in a way. The proper way to play him is by using a hit and run start alternating between survivors. In other words don‚Äôt tunnel. Snowball as much as you can.
---
It's pretty good,but remember it's a hex so it can be a risky one
---
You can continue. It's not the end of the world 
---
Fuck I guess very few people understand sarcasm nowadays...
---
Seriously though the SFM stuff is average at best. If you look past the porn there are a few posts there that are pretty good art-wise
---
Looks good except for one thing. Needs a trash can at the bottom and a picture of Claudette next to it
---
Yes that is me alright
---
It‚Äôs criticism, if the streamer can‚Äôt handle basic, relatively calm criticism then they should be a streamer.  
---
I saw both this and your post together.
---
Don‚Äôt ever disrespect my guy pug
---
Here comes his brainless army to defend him 
---
Nah, you don‚Äôt go into someone‚Äôs channel and bash them. Do you really even think this guy offered calm criticism? Come on man. He flat out says here that he told Pug he was making shit up so he doenst look bad. That‚Äôs not calm criticism
---
I spent 2 weeks working on this and watching tutorials on YouTube.  I would gladly accept any polite criticism as I am still pretty new to digital art and coloring in general.  This was done on my note 8 phone! 
---
Doing generators alone is the least rewarding in terms of points, getting chased by the killer for a while is a great way to get points (and 1k per palette stun) and saving people off of a hook is 1.5k if it's a safe one!
---
Jake isnt there
---
The DbD devs have a server for communicating in game. Yet do you think it's cheating
---
Annoying not fun at all nonsense gameplay 
---
he doesn‚Äôt like kitkats 
---
Most teammates be like "hnngh.. haaa.... hng...... hnghhhh.... annnnn...."
---
Isn't Rin really young? And Legion too?
---
If the DBD streamer mostly plays or only plays survivor, chances are they have a God complex.  
---
In this case, AngryPug is a guy in his 30s that has a purple beard.  I'd be disappointed if he wasn't an insufferable moron. 
---
Nothing of value would be loss. No need to say more to people like that.
---
Literally only once back when leather face was first released
---
he just doesnt support nestle ok
---
Four minutes. My god. The poor children.
---
He's not that strong of a killer, he's just really annoying because his power is literally to just injure people and then make them heal. He's just a time waster and a really annoying one at that.
---
Welcome to planet earth criticism is needed because it‚Äôs suppose to help things be better
---
I mean, it‚Äôs entirely possible that it‚Äôs random. I think Apple had to change their algorithms for their music system because even though it was as random as it could get, people complained because they kept getting songs by the same bands. Could be a similar thing. 
---
Anything for daddy myers
---
If I knew how to film stuff so it looked like it was in the first person while having two hands in frame, I would totes film this. I would do it in the third but I just flipped my glasses off when I showed off how I would do it and I feel old now.
---
It's important to let people know they're wrong.  
---
They likely don't think about the licensed survivors, or say over 21 for legal reasons.
---
Laurie and Quentin are both likely still high schoolers, and Quentin's lore places his disappearance shortly after the movie's events.
---
Why does mikey look so short lol
---
Practically every  youtuber have blind fans who will never question their idol and will attack anyone 
---
.
---
Unfortunately even good YouTubers who are nice people aren‚Äôt safe from this and when that YouTuber criticizes someone some of there fans will attack even when the YouTuber tells them not to
---
I guess I‚Äôd have to see how it went down. But I know with every streamer I watch occasionally you‚Äôll get the people who go into the chat with the specific intention of being critical of them. It‚Äôs always obvious and they rightfully get the boot. 
---
The general rule though, is if you don‚Äôt like what someone is doing or saying, you just leave and find someone else to watch rather than start shit.
---
to get a merciless victory you just need to get either 3 iri and one silver or 2 iri and two gold, so even though you only got two kills(which is only a silver) you guarded gens hit survivors and chased people well enough to get iridescent in all three other categories 
---
Has it always been a two week waiting period from PTB to live? 
---
Susie is nothing but metal and edgy tunes. The brighter the hair, the darker the tunes.
---
The aura reading is pretty great. It lets me know the general area someone is in, or which gen I need to move to after a hook.
---
‚ÄúI called him out on being salty,‚Äù this is completely and utterly calm criticism. Pug is notorious for freaking out on viewers and not taking blame for his mess ups. Why bother defending him especially when you are quite clearly wrong? 
---
Everyone will just destroy shack pallet. No thank you. 
---
Iridescent King: Am I a joke to you?
---
You were disconnected from playing this game?  Interestingly enough, you‚Äôll find most survivors disconnecting from your game now that you‚Äôve picked up Legion. 
---
Yeah i guess so, obviously ill have to try out the perk too aswell to see but thats a fair point
---
Damn, Nea as a mom. =\]
---
0 counter play = not fun for survivors 
---
I enjoy legion too, but the reason people hate him is because he has no counterplay, he‚Äôs boring and unfun to play against. 
---
Nah, hitting/hooking is not that hard. Maybe pallet should return once the hex is cleansed, that‚Äôll be fine. 
---
there‚Äôs an obvious difference between saying you think something was a legit hit vs accusing the streamer of making shit up. Shit starters get booted in every single channel I watch, it ain‚Äôt just Pug. 
---
No counterplay?
---
So legion is high tier like nurse?
---
I don‚Äôt get it a lotta people said that legion is bad
---
Tbh I‚Äôd be happy if it was just something that I had to hold like with a generator. Hell maybe an insanely hard skill check could get you a kobe in the struggle state. 
---
Honestly i never have a hard time with freddy, he is bad but his rare and ultra add ons make him really good imo
---
[Devour Hope be like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/340/260/f42.png) 
---
Yea, I've noticed a lot of survs using windows of op latley. Makes it very easy for them. Also depends what killer you're using. Hag makes it very easy to shit down a pallet loop.
---
No. Legion can‚Äôt down people easily. You either engage with frenzy, then chase as a 110% speed killer, or hit the survivor 4 times in frenzy. 
---
Legion is only top tier if he has Frank‚Äôs Mixtape. 
---
Legion is about F tier for me, somewhere above Freddy. 
---
Try Kate‚Äôs perk: windows of opportunity. The pallets are likely there, your just not seeing them and instead your going further away than you need to. 
---
60 seconds of Laurie Strode. 
---
Only Jake and Laurie remained among the living survivors on Haddonfield. The houses were empty and the only echo was the chilling screams of the others who came with them. Jake had just released Laurie from a hook outside a familiar looking house and they both knew only they remained. 
---
‚ÄúRemember what I taught you. Bite your tongue. No noise. No sound. You‚Äôve got an Iron Will, Laurie.‚Äù
---
Laurie nodded in agreement and the two split off to confuse Micheal. He was exceptionally murderous this time. He has already ran through both Feng and Nea with just his bare hands. It was quiet in the streets, but they knew he was going to return. 
---
Laurie began counting the seconds until she could feel his presence. ‚Äú45...44...43..‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt long before that dreadful feeling creeped up on her. That strange and Overwhelming Presense that Micheal terrorized her for years. As she began to cut between houses to make distance she spotted Jake running the same way. He had gotten mixed up and wound up cornered with her. 
---
Micheal turned towards the man quickly catching up to him and grabbing him by the throat, running his knife through him like a fresh blade through warm butter. Horrified, Laurie looked on as she witnessed the last Hope of their escape, violently murdered and tossed like a ragdoll, Devoured into the clutches of The Entity. 
---
‚Äú23.....22...21‚Äù She kept counting. She had to break free and hide. She had to escape somehow. That Presense crept up on her back once more as Laurie circles out of his line of sight and stayed low next to one of the house sides. ‚ÄúI have to make this count.‚Äù Laurie‚Äôs hands gripped a piece of the broken wood from the house as she walked out into the open. Micheal‚Äôs eyes were on his last prize as Laurie saw a locked door appear from behind Micheal. An escape. Her last chance. 
---
Laurie‚Äôs legs carried her as fast as she could muster, she brandished the wooden piece and was fueled by her desire to escape. ‚Äú3....2.....‚Äù
---
Micheal did not lunge. 
---
He did not move.

His hands turned upwards toward her throat as he lifted her to his eyes. The sound of his breath staggered through the mask as Laurie cried out, feeling his knife exit her back. She miscounted. Her Strikes were not as Decisive this evening. Micheal threw her body across the yard and walked away. 
---
Love the artwork my dude
---
Simple, but funny
---
I've played this game enough to know what you are going thru, but its pvp game so for me its expected to get salt. even if you did really good or really bad in any game you are going to get toxic cry baby's. my advice enjoy their pain let them fill your cup over so you never have to run out of salt again :)
---
Yea maybe hitting for a token is too easy, but getting 3 hooks while keeping your totem alive is not. 
---
Liar. I know you personally and you can‚Äôt help, but do this. You also hit people on hook. You‚Äôre just a toxic scumbag. Grow up.
---
You lie! Ace would never do that. D:

Anytime two girls exist in a group, said girls must either be bffs or frenemies. So either they clash on music or both like the metal.

Trash game. Everyone has there Monday (tuesday)
---
I will forever love these crossover posts &lt;3
---
Yeah you can. Tbh tho I‚Äôve yet to find an arangemt I like better than the default one as it makes it super easy to swing the camera around if you wanna pallet slam and your not sure which way they‚Äôre coming from. 
---
Dont worry, we salute to those few who still run BT after the changes, so i salute you good sir
---
I've been waiting for devour hope for a while now... Woooo
---
Still, Hag is not free on PC, and I'm pretty sure that majority of playerbase plays on PC.
---
good lol i have rules to how i play killer. that or i let them get the gen and farm with em
---
I never said it was cheating, I was pointing out the flaws in an argument that ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt cheating if everyone does it.‚Äù
---
Cheating is an extreme way to put it, but does it give you an unfair advantage over the other team? At this point in the game, that‚Äôs up for debate. If the game were where it was like a year ago, I‚Äôd say yah, but the devs have since tried balancing more around swf instead of solo queue for a while and things have been a bit better. 
---
Swf isn‚Äôt broken overpowered anymore, now it‚Äôs just regular overpowered. It still makes the game a lot easier for one side when it shouldn‚Äôt be (never a good practice to have in a multiplayer game) but it‚Äôs not unbeatable anymore, just exponentially more difficult than it would normally be given your opponents skill.
---
So low tier normally and high tier when using that add on?
---
Can‚Äôt wait to be sent this every time I play killer normally
---
What glitch?
---
There was a bug at one point where sometimes survivors would spawn right in front of the killer, maybe someone put on a shroud and they got the glitch so everyone spawned next to the killer
---
You get downvotes, but I'm with you. As soon as I see someone asleep I think "ugh, better finish this gen and go help them escape". Like, it's not even close.  
---
Just the other day freddy got one kill and had blood warden with noed, so he got 2 more of us as we went for the last minute save... that perk
---
 is the only thing that made the match interesting.
---
What exactly will you be doing other then "Holding M1?" working on a gen? Running from the killer? bc if you like running from the killer, then legion is like a god sent for you, They have to hit you 4 TIMES to down, unless you think playing against a 4 blink nurse and spamming space bar in the basement is fun.
---
fedora man bad
---
I can agree, i only play ace as he has all the perks so i only bought some outfits for him, most of my shards go on points from the shrine
---
Pretty much. 
---
He makes the game loading bars.  
---
&gt;go mend. 
---
&gt;now go self heal. 
---
&gt;now do a gen. 
---
Meanwhile 5 min have past and all you have been doing is skill checks
---
Im a bit out of the loop, what are they changing on ds?
---
At least one person every match has gotta take one for the team, sometimes its you, sometimes it isnt its just bad luck
---
Its better than WGLF since the nerf to healing but WGLF has its moments
---
2 minutes is quite a long time and hex ruin can be destroyed in the first 10 seconds. Not to mention really good survivors can bypass hex ruin with great skill checks anyway. 
---
That normally happens when steam finds out your name is offensive and changes it. 
---
i had my name set to a very offensive name involving a certain uncle joe and being touchy and steam was like ‚Äúnono, have these numbers instead‚Äù

She's good but she ain't no Dwight.
---
Probably the unique primary key used to identify your individual account.
---
I assume that if it fails to load your Steam name, it will display your ID.
---
This is true. I feel as though there is a large disparity between toxic killers and toxic survivors though so I try to make up that gap. And because I think it‚Äôs funny and is a good way to get a reaction out of someone to spice things up. I‚Äôll always say gg in the end tho. How do u know me tho?
---
Against the Plague I found it pretty useless since people just insta heal at the fountains but it's fine overall. I don't know about the exhaustion trigger on Head On. Poised is really strong cause killer can just lose you if there's enough LOS blockers and you can haul ass away from gens and be just fine.
---
I understood some of those words 
---
It would be useless mid-late. noed is useless early-late, yet its still one of the (prob most) powerful perks in the game. All in how you use it/ what your build is.
---
Nah, Laurie‚Äôs whole deal is that she‚Äôs always well behaved and proper. 
---
I had 22,000 the other day, spent it on the big swinging dick Jake 80‚Äôs track suit! I‚Äôve had allot of fun taunting the killers with it lol! 
---
All the other survivorinos are slurping the pineapples bro
---
Thank you for all the birthday wishes, I'm trying to get the devs to see this masterpiece 
---
Not always, I had it spawn in the street today.
---
Sometimes I wait in case someone gets hooked and needs rescuing for those sweet BPs. Or if an injured person needs healing. I usually don't wait at the exit unless the killer was particularly good and I'm scared of getting downed lol 
---
I don't tea bag though. 
---
This is because computers can't really do "Random".  They do pseudo-random. 
---
Iridescent Head: So what am I, chopped liver? 
---
So would it be ok I go into Tru3‚Äôs stream and ask him why he always blames the game design instead of his own mistakes as killer? Or would it be better if I just, you know, didn‚Äôt watch at all?
---
I dig the art. =\]
---
For console? Because if it is hag ain't s tier
---
The tunelee can only escape it if Freddy let's them. You can't escape a killer with infinite wall hacks
---
Is that the one you can block completely just by jumping into a locker? 
---
Ha haa! Nice lol
---
WTF Ha haa! This is hilarious!
---
Never trust someone who streams primarily survivor lol
---
If you're bad at Billy than sure.
---
Just because you start playing Nurse and your blinks are bad because you're inexperienced doesn't mean that blinking is bad, it just means you aren't very good.
---
If you can't utilize free-control properly than that's a you problem, not the mechanic's problem.
---
Free-control is what allows Billy to be amazing on so many loops. The ability to quickly round corners is something that any good Billy should know. For example, you can round the corner of Killer Shack's door (the non-pallet one) and aim immediately for the window. If you were to just walk around the corner and then chainsaw you wouldn't hit the Survivor often.
---
There‚Äôs way dumber things they could say.
---
lol. Were you playing on the jigsaw map? If so that was me. I have like 10+ of his rares and ultra rares. It was hard as hell to get it to tier 3. That's why I don't use them much. It was not that fun and the BP is so low. 
---
Damn yes! This looks awesome!
---
It is not a tier list for console. That‚Äôs why Nurse is S tier. 
---
Yeah, I cannot even play legion without people constantly dcing
---
It's gonna counter tunneling by giving you DS after getting unhooked and then chased down.  
---
For any competent killer, it's a straight nerf to the perk, but it is a big help vs tunnelers
---
I did not feel it necessary to stalk your profile, as that comment wasn't made with any malice.  Was just a rough guess that you'd probably missed out on that Era. :) 
---
F 
---
Because bloodpoints are the easiest form of dbd currency to obtain.
---
Shards are easily the hardest currency to obtain, it's like trading a diamond for tap water.
---
You can buy dlc and cosmetics with shards, saving you money.
---
Nurse belongs in a tier of her own imo, with Hag and Billy being A.
---
It can only be used after you have already been hooked, after you successfully use it, you become the obsession.
---
It pretty much becomes an anti tunneling perk. 
---
Paper mask. Skirt. And tampon in hand. Calls it cosplay. Whatever. Watch me get downvoted to fudge.
---
Ok? What about suicide is so appealing?
---
Hag still ain't a tier regardless of what you play
---
Nea's eyes are mesmerizing. 
---
&gt;i only play ace as he has all the perks so i only bought some outfits for him, 
---
That's cool. 90% of other people don't only play one character though.
---
I agree totally. As a survivor, I love playing huntress. I feel like there's more of a chance.
---
Laurie and Quentin were aged up in game. He's 18 in the movie and 21 in game
---
Yes. 
---
Pug isn't even interesting.
---
But they belong on the internet after having the slightest of disagreements and then running to reddit to post and complain about it. 
---
I must be a crappy survivor because that doesnt seem too bad to me lol. Its the same thing but cant use it before first hook. Do survivors in high rank not really get hooked? When i was rank 1 killer i didnt care about ds because i would just follow the trail again and kill them lol
---
If you're trying to insult me, that was a very odd attempt.
---
thank you sm!!
---
Thank you!! &lt;3
---
As a killer he is not fun for sure and you have to be extremely skilled to play him. If I had both characters and had to choose one to play I'd pick legion. But as a survivor I'll take the killer that I have the highest chance of escaping from. Lol
---
A serious critique:
---
Hag a bit too high, Huntress a bit too high, Doc too high, Clown way too high, Trapper too high, Legion a bit too low, Freddy way too low.
---
When killers hook you, then proceed to smack you the entire time you struggle/die
---
This may sound like a dumb question, but what do the letters stand for?
---
Survivors have god mode for 6 seconds at the start of a Chase, and after that you're just a wraith with no bing to bong; Freddy is just wraith with a 6 second window of doing nothing in chases, and he has cataracts or something.
---
T-bagging, it is so annoying! 
---
I usually only see that when the survivor deserves it for being a genuine asshole (not just good at the game, bc that's fine, but being a legit toxic player with dumb-ass t-bags and taunting flashlight clicks and shit)
---
Thanks! Good to hear!
---
It's a fun thought exercise since DbD is a really strangely designed game. I'll likely keep doing these for the foreseeable future, so keep an eye out for one next weekend!
---
&gt;Best stall in the game
---
Arguable. He does do well at stalling the game but I feel like Pig does it better. 
---
&gt;Good stealth
---
Yes, he is a great stealth killer. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs the best, but he‚Äôs a good stealth killer. 
---
&gt;good M1 mindgames
---
The only advantage Freddy has against other M1 killers like Wraith and Myers is his height, so perks like BoP are actually good on him. 
---
&gt;ability to abandon chases
---
Arguable. Majority of survivors will actively try to get out of the dream world, so yeah you can abandon chases but I wouldn‚Äôt do that since you just lost a chase. I‚Äôd only do that if they‚Äôre a god at looping. 
---
S is the best, D is the worst. 
---
Cool, you can get a free hit on some people if they don‚Äôt get to a pallet first, a window first, or have sprint burst.
---
‚ÄúBest tracking in the game‚Äù if they‚Äôre outside your terror radius while asleep they‚Äôre probably about to get woken back up.
---
‚ÄúAbility to abandon chases easily‚Äù wtf is that even meant to mean, if you‚Äôre bad at everything that you mentioned above then only then will you need to abandon chases
---
‚ÄúEungh!‚Äù  (translation:  ‚ÄúAnd such is the price of hubris, young woman.  An ignoble death for which none shall mourn and for whom no pity is to be felt.  May this lesson by example impress upon all those great virtues, humbleness and respect, both for one‚Äôs self and one‚Äôs enemies.  Indeed, is it not that the self is often the greatest and most dastardly of its own enemies?‚Äù)
---
It‚Äôs not the most fun thing in the world, but it gets me more fun perks to play with, faster. So I always stick around. 
---
Especially if blood hunt.
---
It's only first time you get downed if you choose to use it. If you don't press the button the old ds didn't get used and you could have it for the next tim you get picked up.
---
It's not powerful, the stun is shorter and the timer ticks down during chase.
---
Need a new section because I think Neither David nor Jake will be interested in Kit Kats. 
---
You're a douchebag survivor main. Probably a boosted Claudette.
---
The Legion is a pathetic weak killer, had one tonight on PS4, rank 4 killer, with all the add-ons, bbq, mix tape, etc. well this dude got run around for the first 2 gens by a kate who was the obsession, he finally got her and hooks her. I‚Äôve seen them going back and forth and he seemed like a rank 10-13 killer or higher on how he was playing. Well he finally makes it over to me since he has BBQ-chili, does the deep wound, and the chase is on! I loop him for 2 more gens, he hooks me and decides to straight up face-camp me. The game has gone on for about 10 mins now, don‚Äôt know why gens we‚Äôre taking so long, ruin was broke 30 seconds into the game. 1 gen left and he is sitting there slowly moving back and forth and going in and out of his stupid frenzy and puts a few stabs in on me while on the hook, I hit struggle faze, last gen pops, claudette comes with borrowed time,  but the killer missed me and her, gets the unhook, I ran and hit a window fault, my lithe kicked in and I‚Äôm away, killer goes after me still as I can see him behind me and I‚Äôm running for the door. He breaks off and goes after someone else, I make it to the door and open it, bamn! NOED POPS Claudette is down. I heal up and head over for the save and while I‚Äôm heading that way I find his totem, break that. I get his attention and he‚Äôs back after me, he hits me with the frenzy and a nearby nea but turns and comes for me, we start looping again, Claudette was saved. I‚Äôm slowly working my way to the door and looping, but somewhere in there I lost him or he broke it off. So I work my way to the open exit and start to heal and then bamm! Disconnected...  The pos disconnected, no one had left yet since they were healing, and I figured it was a rank 10-13 or higher killer because of the DC and then I see it‚Äôs a RANK 4 with all his perks and add ons and I‚Äôm like are you fucking kidding me! So yah fuck the Legion, I haven‚Äôt come across one yet on PS4 that wasn‚Äôt a scumbag player! 
---
Your tag is my next project :)
---
I thought it wasn‚Äôt affected by enduring? I haven‚Äôt tested it, but I did read some comments/twitch about it.
---
But if you have all the dlc or cosmetics you want? Just look at No0b3, guy has over a hundred thousands shards. If you play hardcore then it‚Äôs no skin off your back to trade them in for bloodpoints. An easy 150k-200k worth per perk
---
Disconnecting survivors need to be punished. They need a 30 minute ban or something
---
I still don‚Äôt like the idea of killers messing with survivors‚Äô mechanics. Didn‚Äôt work well for Legion 
---
Thanks, I'll check them out. 
---
Except anyone decent is just gonna 360 a trap or have Lithe on and boost away while youre left just standing there. Even if they DONT do that, any other killer is gonna be able to catch up and hit you faster. Hag is A tier, but below Billy and Spirit
---
Pig can stall the game like a beast, and she‚Äôs one of the few killers that doesn‚Äôt need Ruin. Freddy needs Ruin and his stalling is not as good as pig‚Äôs. 
---
For me, it‚Äôs between Pig and Freddy for best stealth killer. One is completely invisible, but the other can sneak up on survivors and grab them, just like Myers, but has an extra power. 
---
When you leave them alone, as long as you don‚Äôt hit them they can‚Äôt self care out of the dream world, forcing them to do a gen or find a teammate. At the end game, they have to find a teammate so if you have all of them in dream state they can‚Äôt get out. However, it‚Äôs very situational so they‚Äôll most likely wake up if you leave them alone. 
---
4 man swf all running ds
---
I noticed that looking for a lobby with 3 people takes the longest. As you still need a 4th and not that many people play survivor alone. 
---
True randomness doesn't usually appear random, so who knows.
---
Even as a killer that does well with open maps (Billy, Nurse, etc)?
---
I was wondering when people get taken into the dream world how doe this affect them? like I said I don't really understand his mechanics.
---
why does the repair bar turn red when more than 1 person is working on it
---
"in lesbian with eachother"
---
m'kay
---
I stole from a bank once. Was pretty peeved when they got me arrested.
---
Ruin and Huntress is really good but yeah. I don't use endgame cause it for me is pointless. I usually kill everyone before endgame and I find using it a little cheap. 
---
It can, effectively farming will only grant you 29.6k. You can only get 5.6k in the Sacrifice catergory. Survivors can get anything above 30k if they keep doing gens together, blowing up the gens over and over to max out their Objective, running around in circles around you will grant them chases and escapes. If they self heal their Survivability also surges and if they escape your grasp, their survivability also surges. It's tough as a survivor to get 8k in Survivability but it's doable. 
---
Bitch you labeled yourself a cheater a half dozen times.  You know you did something against the rules - stop pissing and moaning about it.  
---
Own your shit, move on, good riddance.  
---
I agree, I don't belong at Red Ranks but I always hit Rank 2 or 1. I'm really good staying stealthy, shadow unhooks, working on gens, but during a chase it's always half and half. I never know if I'm going to lose or win the chase.
---
How do you 360 so fast on console? I have my sensitivity on max and I can't spin that fast. Idk if I'm doing it wrong or what
---
Slugging and leaving me to lay there. I wasn't toxic, I'd rather die than be forced to lay there and watch another two teammates go down.
---
Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs a couple prestige‚Äôs and killers make stupid amounts of bp just earn it back.
---
I cannot speak directly for Australia, but in the USA I have been connected to players from different countries all over the world.  Usually the other countries are Canada or Mexico, but I do get some as far away as Russia or China.
---
I believe I have seen an Australian before, but I am not 100% sure on that.  I would say it is likely you do get some people outside of your region in some matches.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Thank you! I appreciate that!
---
Thanks!
---
Ahhh, that's awesome! I made this one in the same size and resolution... Just letting you know, in case you decide to switch things up!
---
I agree! Thank you!
---
Aww, thank you. You're precious. &lt;3 It's always lovely to hear from you, and I'm glad you like this one!
---
&gt; Pig can stall the game like a beast, and she‚Äôs one of the few killers that doesn‚Äôt need Ruin. Freddy needs Ruin and his stalling is not as good as pig‚Äôs.
---
Pigs stall is based heavily on RNG, and Freddy doesnt need Ruin. His stall might not be as powerful, but he can apply it much much much more often.
---
&gt; For me, it‚Äôs between Pig and Freddy for best stealth killer. One is completely invisible, but the other can sneak up on survivors and grab them, just like Myers, but has an extra power.
---
Eh, thats fair
---
&gt; When you leave them alone, as long as you don‚Äôt hit them they can‚Äôt self care out of the dream world, forcing them to do a gen or find a teammate. At the end game, they have to find a teammate so if you have all of them in dream state they can‚Äôt get out. However, it‚Äôs very situational so they‚Äôll most likely wake up if you leave them alone.
---
They will wake up, but they wont be doing gens in that time, or if they are they will be doing in incredibly slow AND will be regressing the gen with the failed skill check. Thats why Freddy has good stall, which is really good in this gen rush meta.
---
I concur!
---
Mk, knowing the definition of an exploit isn't helpful here. 
---
And thanks, your opinion wasn't asked for anyway. 
---
How hard is the skill check to hit? Like an Overcharge?
---
I really appreciate you saying that! At some point in every big project, I have this huge "wait, I wasted HOW MANY hours doing this?!" moment, and hearing things like this make it feel more worth it!
---
So when they are put into the dream they can now see Freddy obviously. When they are out of Freddys terror radius Freddy can see their aura at all times. Also when in the Dream their action speed is reduced by 50 %. To get out of the dream they have to fail a skillcheck, or get another survivor to wake them up.
---
What stall? The survivors fail one itsy skill check and your power is useless. You cant track them if they're not awake. The survivors can also see you while transitioning into sleep, and they can just run to a window or pallet as soon as they start the transition and stun you as they enter the sleep state. My guess is that you haven't actually played Freddy above rank 10, you're just ignorant to facts, or you're just shit posting.
---
While I didn't *consciously* make the Meg a huge asshole, I'm sure the fact that I main Meg was a big component in this... Great observation. xD
---
I am trying to P1 all the survivors right now. How is it bad to just stick to one lvl 50 survivor with all the perks? Eventually I will prestige him too, but that's after dumping BP into someone else so they become the perk jockey. Would that not be the correcr way to do things?
---
Thank you so much! That's really sweet of you to say that, and I appreciate it!
---
You're right.  But it shouldn't of been taken in the first place. Take what I cheated to get, not what I earned. 
---
Because of that,  I am just gonna quit playing DBD for awhile and, when I do, I won't be playing killer (only cheated w them).
---
Ahh, I just looked that up! That seems super doable, but I'm pretty sure the devs would shut it down in a heartbeat! Also, thank you--I'm really glad you like it!
---
Lmao you commented the same thing on my post a week ago
---
Unfh, isn't that the truth. &gt;&lt;
---
Killer isn‚Äôt hard but best of luck
---
&gt; Except anyone decent is just gonna 360 a trap 
---
No? What? The trap looks in the direction of the survivor at all times, you physically cant 360 a trap. 
---
&gt; Even if they DONT do that, any other killer is gonna be able to catch up and hit you faster.
---
WHAT? Lmao she can teleport. How can any other killer aside from Nurse do the same thing? I disagree with his placement as well but shes not below Spirit.
---
I changed actions to B so I can self heal without throwing a pallet down lol
---
Thank you very much! &lt;3
---
I had it set to X for a while but it screwed me up more than helped me 
---
I tried watching him a couple times but it always went to talking about sports like he was a sports caster, and  talking down to most of the people on his stream. A bit of a turnoff for a new viewer. (Personally)
---
Those salty tears taste so good. Tell us more, please. 
---
Well, it's a good thing that it's measured to outside his terror radius, blocked by lockers, and easily removed, then.
---
 You have time to get running, and with Borrowed Time and solid chase play/perks, you're way more likely to live, or die post-gens, than to die mid-match.
---
This applies even while most Freddy players are trying to facecamp, as long as your unhooks are timed out well.
---
I will say if you're going to say that his ability to wall hack makes him better in chase, no. It's useless besides finding the next pallet to eat, unless you let him use his height to mindgame you.
---
Been playing this game for over a year now, and bbq never appeared once. 
---
No way that‚Äôs basic rng I agree. 
---
He would, he's too cool to care.
---
&gt; What stall? The survivors fail one itsy skill check and your power is useless.
---
I dont think you understand what stall means. What happens in the space of time before they get the skill check lmao?
---
&gt; You cant track them if they're not awake. 
---
Then spread the pain and put more survivors asleep lol.
---
&gt;  The survivors can also see you while transitioning into sleep, and they can just run to a window or pallet as soon as they start the transition and stun you as they enter the sleep state.
---
Then mindgame the times you are invisible in the transition. It doesnt work all the time, but more than you would think. 
---
&gt; My guess is that you haven't actually played Freddy above rank 10, you're just ignorant to facts, or you're just shit posting.
---
Lmao ok bud
---
The searching will attempt to find people from Australia/NZ first, then it'll branch out when it can't find them. The playerbase in OCE is very small so quite often you'll get 150+ ping games.
---
I actually use it
---
Yup
---
FEED ME!
---
Tunneling is actually really bad for Freddy.
---
The glass bead is where you set a marker on secondary action (whatever your skillcheck key is). You, and the other survivors can see this until you change its location. The killer can't see it.
---
The crystal bead shows all survivors the aura of objects the map sees when you use the map.
---
It's like arguing with a brick wall
---
There has been times where I've landed FL saves but my friend I'm playing with says the killer's facing sideways on her screen, but it's impossible that someone blinded you through the floor in the basement.
---
this is real cute,,, whos the original artist tho,,
---
First off I have about only 40h in the game and play both sides (~60% survivor Rank 10-11 survivor and 14 killer) so my opinion might be bias, uneducated or not accurate enough.
---
Playing both side is really good even if you main one sides as it gives you an insight on how you opponent are going to behave and helps with mindgaming and general understanding of the game.
---
When I play killer and get looped, if I lose too much time I'll drop the chase and go find somebody else, When I get flashlighted at pallet or when picking up somebody i'll try to listen for footstep, wack and pray, sure it's frustrating but that's how the game is.
---
When I play survivor, I find it annoying when I get tunneled and camped but there is nothing I can do about it so I just hope that my teammates realizes it and keep working on gens.
---
I won't change how I play based on what happened to me, being on receiving end of both showed me how frustrating some things can be but I have a hard time understanding what this community consider toxic and not against what would actually be toxic.
---
I don't tunnel/camp even when I get bodied by a 4 man SWF and can't do anything throughout the trial, I just call gg, have a chat with them if the game was fun and they don't flame and move onto the next game.
---
Just yesterday with Huntress (my killer main) I had a game with 3 man SWF and one solo most of them had 600h+ and I got looped for more than half the game and got only 2 hook, it was probably one of the most enjoyable game I had as a killer as it was a very insightful game and I we even had a really nice discussion post game.
---
On the other hand I had a game where I played Billy for my daily (level 1, I don't like his gameplay and don't plan on investing into him for a long time) and managed to pull off a 4k while playing fair (going for the unhooker, trying to not hook the same survivor twice in a row even when they didn't heal and were being obvious, going in a corner of the map when only 2 survivor were still alive so they can unhook as there both were on they last hook) and got shat on by one of the survivor (rank 7 claudette with T3 perk from other survivor all around) because I didn't let her get the hatch and grabbed her, the game was fun but I got written off as a "dick" when I played fair and still got 4k, thus reducing my overall enjoyement.
---
The survivor entitlement is probably the biggest problem that I have as a killer and I can't stand being facecamped when I play survivor but it boggle my mind that some strats that are legitimate (and i'm not talking about camping here as I personally consider it "low" and "unskilled") are being written off as toxic and players will flame you over it. If flashlight didn't work the way it does now and would be used to navigate the map it would be either underwhelming or mandatory. if NOED for example would be a classic Hex that lit the totem at the beginning of the game it would it would defeat the purpose of the perk (can't voice any opinion on whether or not movement speed need a nerf since I haven't played enough) , DS is getting a nerf from what I understood soon enough so there is that.
---
I kinda went off trail but my point is, play how you want, the killer is not going to be nice with you because you respect them and the same is true the other way around, people who only play one side of the game might not fully realize how some stuff can be frustrating but the main point of the game is still winning as is it, to some extent, a competitive game.
---
In my opinion playing both sides is a really good thing but if you wanna restrain your gameplay because you know how bad it feels I think it's not the best solution as alot of people won't realize this and keeping on playing in a "toxic" or "unfair" manner and have a blast while you purposefully handicap yourself so that your enemies won't get pissed at you for whatever reason they see fit.
---
I actually use it to rank the people I play against if its a close game I'd rank it higher.
---
How do you even remember your dreams so vividly? I can barely even remember mine.
---
I feel your pain
---
Jeff would never
---
Wait can‚Äôt you cancel heals?
---
GET OUT ME SWAMP
---
Shit i meant to say being at rank 1 doesnt mean your good rip, my bad.
---
&gt; Do you know how to play Freddy? You never want to hit people then leave. You aren‚Äôt legion. What do you gain from that anyways? All it does is give survivors a free escape and wasted time. It‚Äôs pointless and you never want to do it.
---
Yeah... I main him. You dont play him the way you are telling me.
---
Ive watched it, not a fan. He barely scratches the surface on the character. 
---
She‚Äôs not free on PC?! What?! What other killers/survivors aren‚Äôt free on PC? 
---
Criticising some kid's cosplay as being too low effort for your rarefied tastes seems like a weird hill to die on, but you do you. 
---
I mean its pretty useless after the change. Ur better off running deliverance or borrowed time.
---
A 3 second stun based on killer behaviour isnt worth it
---
He's been following me around for a couple weeks either to tell me to and I quote "suck my dick bitch" or just call me a cunt ect. 
---
Nightmares are much easier to remember, and I wrote this down as soon as I woke up. For me, the way I remember most of it is by picking one of the most memorable parts (like when the doctor just went and burned the Dwight that was giving us away), and working backwards from that to remember what happened before it and after it. Anchor points like that are what keep me from forgetting a dream completely
---
Not in recovery state, theres nothing you can do to stop someone else from healing you 
---
Put him at the bottem, he sabotaged the kit kat
---
You really don‚Äôt. As much as I love nightmares and horror movies and would watch them end on end for hours, living through them is just something else entirely
---
Come on son I was saving for Jane and Plague :c 
---
Is there a block feature on Reddit or does that not exist?
---
i still got it, i think its gonna be a great perk for when bubba camps me in the basement :)
---
He did a livestream today where all he played was Freddy. Watch that. 
---
What do you gain from hitting a survivor then leaving? Don‚Äôt say ‚Äústalling power‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt do shit for stalling. The only good thing you get is the 300 BP for hitting someone, which is a god awful reason to tag them. 
---
The only instance where  that Nea costume doesn't look terrifying

KATE NO! SHES LIKE 16! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! SHES EVEN DEAD. 
---
this is so hot, can i get a nsfw version
---
Damn, that sucks, some of the players in that game are actually brain dead
---
Read the guide, then you'll find out. Ill check out the livestream now, but I dont have high hopes.
---
My mans got a bad case of the squiggle leg and that knife is too big for him
---
I‚Äôll be sure to, but I‚Äôve already watched the video he linked. 
---
It's actually a one-two nerf, not only did they make it need a trigger (40/50/60 seconds after unhook) but they reduced the stun duration to 3 seconds (which is tier ones duration now) at all ranks. As longs the Killer doesn't tunnel it's a dead perk, and even if they do enduring hard counters it. 
---
Oh I love your bunny feng! Found another artist to follow ;)
---
Hahahaha Adam is such a good teacher 
---
I think the devs were looking at VR once, but they said it'd be really hard to do for the survivor side so they scrapped it.
---
If you read that guide it would've told you that tunneling as Freddy is a bad idea, and that switching targets is a good idea a lot of the time. I main Freddy man, trust me on this.
---
I main Freddy too, trust me. 
---
So im backwards here. But its basically the same thing i guess except more revengful
---
I'd swap jeff and meg, meg's a good kid lore-wise, jeff is metal af, would totally teach kids to say fuck
---
You absolutely can 360 a hag trap once she teleports to it.
---
and she can teleport under a pretense. Billy can zoom over at any time and Spirit can catch up way faster. Her teleport isnt a reliable way to catch up to a survivor.
---
now the big question. did he let her live
---
I enjoy the freddy birghtness though. His brightness would be better as a perk. 
---
It sucks, but could have been worse. Not trying to one up you, but some asshole had me for hours before
---
Then you should know how to play him correctly. Read the guide, or join the teaching discord server I offered to you a while back. Theres someone whos much better at freddy than I am, who can explain a lot better. Link is here: https://discord.gg/r4KTbua 
---
I hope you join man, if you are a Freddy main, then this will help you improve your gameplay immensely.
---
feng min mains give me that vibe
---
As a Jake main who loves KitKat....I cannot express my sorrow right now.
---
darn
---
&gt; You absolutely can 360 a hag trap once she teleports to it.
---
Even if you could, countering a 360 is one of the eaisest things to do in DBD.
---
&gt; and she can teleport under a pretense. Billy can zoom over at any time and Spirit can catch up way faster. Her teleport isnt a reliable way to catch up to a survivor. A teleport doest help you catch up to a survivor, which is what I said. She is below Spirit 100%
---
It absolutely fucking does lmao. Have you ever played Hag?
---
Jake is a solid snap don‚Äôt worry ( if he liked them )
---
How does TELEPORTING move you forwards towards a running survivor? I dont think youre understanding
---
I'm not even going to respond to that thats so stupid 
---
easy =/= fun
---
And I do snap my KitKats....
---
ALL HAIL u/CynthiaArts the one true prophet!!!
---
Youre incredibly hardheaded in this entire comment section. Youre such an idiot
---
Yeah, the best mistake of your LIFE.
---
I dont know if people here will, but if you join this discord (https://discord.gg/r4KTbua) people will be happy to do it for you.
---
This made me laugh out loud 
---
r/woooosh
---
(„ÜÜ·¥ó„ÜÜ)
---
This what immersed babies rhat only crouch throughout the whole match waiting for their team to die for the hatch need to get.
---
I think Bill would be ‚Äûjust watching‚Äù, he‚Äôs too old for this shit. But on the other hand Bill mains are usually quite altruistic so maybe OP is right. 
---
Why not both?
---
That is true! Just a question but do you think that the killer is getting the most blood points out of the game compared to the survivors? Im not talking about the ending number side by side but overall from the activities. Also thank you for your input! :)
---
I don't know if the hag would have been my top choice lmao but congrats man!
---
Who would you have chosen?
---
No one if you're going to hook trade at 5 gens up like that
---
I hope you enjoy the Hag, she's very fun, but can be hard to play well.
---
I‚Äôll think about it when I wake up. I don‚Äôt even use discord since I‚Äôm on PlayStation so I‚Äôll need to sign up. 
---
Probably gonna switch back to nea seeing these kind of posts... 
---
my questions:  
---
1:wtf  
---
2:why  
---
3:what was going trough your head when you made this  
---
4:what inspired you to make this 
---
I'm a Nurse main. I'm no stranger to difficult to play killers, lol
---
Spirit or bubba
---
Funny you say that, I have only bought 3 dlc, those being Spirit, Doctor, and Bubba. Also, Bubba is licensed so I wouldn't have been able to buy him sadly :(
---
Hey there! I‚Äôm the girl in the picture! Just wanted to let you know I spent days making the mask completely from scratch, and thrifted all the clothes I‚Äôm wearing. Thanks for the constructive criticism but I‚Äôll be having fun at comic con, hope you have a nice day.
---
Oh wow. I mean top tier killers are still legion as well and freddy but they just aren't fun to play against for most of us survivor mains.
---
...but it is definitely a random shrine guys?
---
Maybe like a year ago but No0b3 is almost always between rank 10 and rank 1.
---
Unless they‚Äôre de-ranking 
---
Yea all deawings of nea are amazing, but ingame shes a monster.
---
Yeah me too, as long as she doesn't get changed
---
Well she does not look like nea, and thats a good thing quz shes a ugly ass mofo ingame.
---
sucks for you, ochido fan boys. enjoy the nerf ;) 
---
Were you in a SWF?
---
AHHH I LOVE HER
---
I have a back-up character (Dwight) that I played whilst Kate had no perks.  That and BBQ and Chilli on Killers as well as Prove Thyself and WGLF on survivors gets you bloodpoints fairly easily to grind at a pace that doesn‚Äôt murder you inside out.
---
I'm excited now! :D
---
OP: ‚ÄúGladly accept any polite criticism‚Äù 
---
You: ‚ÄúIT NO LOOK LIKE IN GAME MODEL ALSO NEA IS KILLER LOL LOL PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR üëèüëèüëèüëè‚Äù 
---
üòéüëâ
---
How old are you? You look so short in this picture, but if you have a Reddit account it makes me think your age isn't in the single digits...
---
Damn i was not tryna attack anyone, i mean that nea looks much better in all these drawings than she does ingame. 
---
Autohaven is pretty decent for Huntress though. I'm surprised Haddonfield didn't make that list, it's the real anti-fun map for me as killer.
---
Lmao At my lunch break and lol'd ppl looking at me like I'm crazy.
---
When a artist asks for ‚Äúpositive constructive criticism‚Äù what part of that sentence do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to say it looks nothing like the one in game and that the in game one is ugly, she looks like nea a lot actually, it‚Äôs just Bc she is super pale that you think that I guess? 
---
I‚Äôm 18 but I‚Äôm 5 foot 1...  o o f
---
I also just made this account to respond to the comment because it made me laugh, I love a good and spicy roast üî•
---
Oh god 
---
I had a game yesterday, teammate gets chased and dropped pretty quickly and I think nothing of it.
---
Fast forward 8 minutes into the game I finally get into my first chase, not a single pallet anyway. We had 1 gen left to grab yet no pallets inevitably meant we lost.
---
Post game chat I asked the killer why there was no pallets anywhere, killer told me the survivor who went down at the start dropped 6 pallets in the less than 2 min chase he had.
---
This is at rank 1. How do survivors get there dropping pallets like that. I feel your pain but look towards fellow survivors, not game mechanics. 
---
This has been my TedEx talk on pallets, thank-you for coming. 
---
Guess we'll have to agree to disagree there. 
---
**Evil Withintercourse**
---
I wouldn't call pallet looping breaking somebody's ankles but ok.
---
No
---
Who said anything about pallets?
---
Came here to say this, got the points for the DC's and I'd feel bad about the guy left on his own. I'd at least give them *some* points at least.
---
As i have mentioned before when this is brought up, people don't want to pay what amounts to 10 dollars just to get a meta killer perk. I have no interest in playing LF at all, or his other perks, yet because of the web im forced to either wait it out, or spend cash to basically buy the perk.
---
RNG or not (i honestly suspect its weighted RNG but that is neither here or their), at this point its just frustrating that BBQ of all perks comes up so infrequently.
---
Survivors: Feng, Quentin, Kate, Adam, Laurie, Tapp, Ace, Jeff
---
Killers: Leatherface, Hag, Doctor, Pig, Freddy, Myers, Clown, Spirit, Legion
---
I see some cute creature of the fog. Nice artwork tho. 
---
One time(2 months after release) they released some infos about best rated user. After that no
---
were you talking about 360s? Your use of the word "Looping" was misleading. 
---
My god.
---
Yeah 360, loop, same shit lol
---
Disagree, I see a legion I'm pretty sure I'm gonna win the game. As long as I have a competent team I'm not too worried. Unless it's franked and you're confident in your abilities it's a fairly easy game. In my personal opinion anyway :)
---
No problem 
---
Yo who tf downvoted this comment LOL
---
very funny
---
So your argument is that it should be changed because it takes a little bit of skill? 
---
Where the fuck is he suppost to get kitkats in the middle of the forest
---
You can buy licensed killers with shards? I thought you could only buy them with money.
---
1. Hag can teleport across the map *instantly*, plus Hillbilly is unstuck by maps like Lery's. 
---
2. This is a CONSOLE list, that is why Nurse isn't #1. I acknowledge her power, but it is all on the person playing her, due to console limitations. Anyone can do well as Myers, but most will struggle to even 1k as Nurse. This is why she's the least played Killer on consoles.
---
3. With analogue sticks, lag and poor fps;  yes they are. On PC you can easily thread the needle and hit a Survivor over an object. Such precise aiming is just not reliably possible on console with a crosshair. Even then, she's still got the worst map pressure, is the easiest to sneak, suffers badly at loops and loses far too much time getting hatchets.
---
4. As for Spirit: Hillbilly has better mobility and lethality, Hag has more map pressure as is better against loops, Clown is better against loops and has better add-ons, Myers has better lethality and add-ons, Legion is better in a chase, Doctor has better pressure, Nurse is Nurse, Pig slows the game down and is better against loops, Leatherface has better lethality and higher base speed.          
---
I understand your point. But I also feel like, given the context of not only the sub as a whole but also the title itself, you could have guessed how things went down for the animal(s) involved within the first second or two and scrolled past. 
---
Once again, I acknowledge your point as a valid one, but your language makes it seem as though it were forced upon you. 
---
As an animal lover, I get not wanting to see them get hurt. But you‚Äôve already said you understand that it‚Äôs just how nature works. And this video isn‚Äôt particularly bloody/gory/violent/etc. 
---
Hope none of this seemed too insensitive. I genuinely am curious about your viewpoint on this. 
---
When you see those cosplays, I cant help, but ask myself again and again - how is she seeing anything through those holes in chases... 
---
I still like those songs. I never fully outgrew my angsty 12 year old self. üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs just waste of time
---
Ain't it a bitch when you get punished for doing something wrong? IT'S SO UNFAIR
---
MFW there‚Äôs no Green Day üòÆ
---
This looks like a new Spirit skin... I would've totally bought it too... 
---
UwU what's this *notices iron will*
---
Its not easy. You will either get 3 or 4k or you will get no one. There is hardly a in between. You either match up woth your rank or like rank 1-4 and for newer killers that can discourage a eprson from maining. 
---
If heightened senses were a person, they'd  be FunGoose.
---
I'm in awe every time I watch his stream.
---
Crunchyeggrollzz
---
Just grind. Killers have these add-ons, may as well account for them.
---
I run FMT every time I play Legion. If I run low, I pop a Black Ward.  
---
I straight up refuse to play killer normally at the moment. I usually play basement defender or other meme stuff like that. 
---
Feel myself trying too hard when playing killer seriously. Not a fan of that.
---
Of course the hex is in the most obvious spot smh
---
Yeah I just like saying that because some people are oddly protective of it and they will usually rant and that‚Äôs funny
---
Blue haired spirit is a thing of dreams. Believe! This neas head cosmetic was for real my dream cosmetic and it came true lol. 
---
I feel this. I love the game (kinda) and after 800 hours it‚Äôs just hard to play for me. I really liked survivor awhile ago, but the BS that can go on just ruins it too much. 3 survivor games, ebony mori‚Äôs, plain crummy behavior from lots of killers simply makes it feel too unrewarding and generally a negative experience. The only reason I play killer is it‚Äôs not unpredictable and I feel like I can define the flow of the game, instead of letting another player choose an single offering that guarantees a crappy match for everyone else involved. 
---
Fookin‚Äô Dead ard
---
That‚Äôs a theory I haven‚Äôt heard before but I like it
---
He's almost 40. On one of his drunk streams he admitted he had a tiny dick and was pissed about it. Pretty much summed up everything there is to know about him.
---
+10 if the Legion was in Frenzy. 
---
In all seriousness, you can slam pallets from pretty far away. Walk up to a pallet next game and slowly walk away from it, you‚Äôll see how far you can actually slam it. 
---
really baits killers if they think you‚Äôre running through it and you vacuum back for the stun. 
---
Nice, free 600k BP. \*Laughs in I got all the Perks\*
---
I also got banned for calling him an asshole. Gets moderators dicks hard to ban people. Angrypug can be toxic in his stream but god forbid his twitch chat be toxic and stop stroking his dick for 5 seconds.
---
I'm guessing she forgot to put a trap on your head and figured kicking the gen would prevent this exact scenario from occurring. Or, you know, just Pig things, oink.
---
I hope you don't mean an actually robust replay system full of features. I don't think BHVR is capable of this nor do they have any huge reason to invest in it so you're better off recording your own gameplay, seeking out VODs of streamers you play against, etc.
---
Watch Vinc3ntV3ga, he is the best dbd streamer and deserves all of angrypIgs subs 
---
Is this post rank reset, or an old video? 
---
I know your title said you haven‚Äôt played this season but I‚Äôm asking because today is the 13th and I don‚Äôt know what time rank reset actually occurs. 
---
I have pointers though. 
---
My headcanon was a lot more metal.
---
Iron Maiden, Metallica, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath, etc
---
Then again I always use Susie so maybe that‚Äôs her mix. :p
---
I sorta just drop the pallet and 100% thought I was dead anyway. I was really surprised that I stunned him. I did slowly walk away, survivors seem to that very often when I'm a killer but I'd never been able to pull it off. 
---
I'm not sure how I did it, I think it was luck but hopefully that's just a start :)
---
David for wglf and dead hard (easily one of the best exhaustion perks)
---
No I took this as a joke! Also complimenting it bc you said its not ugly like real nea lmao 
---
Only true gang members have witnessed the beauty of NEA 
---
2 survivors Dced early, so I just let the other 2 leave. After the game, one of the dcers told me I was getting reported for working with the survivors.
---
Its a lot more frustrating maining killer. Imagine the way you feel when someone is face camping you on a hook. For killers thats usually hownit feels when all for people escape and you hooked everyone twice but because how the cards fell no one was sacrificed. You have a lot more different things to go up against as killers. Are they going to flashlight spam you? Will they gen rush you? Will they destroy your hexes in the first 2 minutes? Its so stressful. I been playing survivor a little more as of late but i main freddy. 
---
I hit rank 1 pretty easily and pretty quickly. It's not about double pipping. Consistently hitting a single pip is easy. Get a couple of unhooks and *Heal* those people if at all possible. Clear 1/2 dull totems and do at least one gen. 
---
Easy peasy guaranteed single sometimes a double perk. Take off DS, you don't need it if you can loop well and as you said it often gets you facecamped. 
---
Best of luck, I've just taught two people to play the game and it took them maybe two weeks to hit red ranks with my help from no knowledge whatsoever. Watch videos, be willing to learn and you'll do fine. 
---
At lower ranks, survivor's can't play the chase to its max potential, and so the meta is hide and seek. Freddy is the king of hide and seek.
---
At higher ranks, survivors can drag chases on forever and don't need to hide anymore, so the meta becomes tag. Freddy doesn't have anything to help him play tag, and in fact he can't tag people until they get a head-start. 
---
Most of the people on the subreddit are high ranks, about 1-4, so they only care about the high-rank meta. A well played Freddy can still work at high ranks, but he doesn't play well to the strongest meta, and needs to use a more fallible play-style instead.
---
In all likelihood he is not remembering it 100% dreams are a mess and you have multiple dreams every night. 
---
A/s/l
---
When I am on a hook,no one is doing generators and my 3 other teammates want to be altruistic for the WGLF stack and unhook me, and the killer is 2 feet away
---
Why is this a thing, I'm scared :(
---
I understand where you're coming from and am in no way trying to invalidate your point, but there was a sufficient amount of time to realize where the video was going and pause it.
---
Being banned unrightfully isn't really the slightest of disagreements, but you do you.
---
Lol I just wasted mine fml
---
My favorite part of all of this is that Legion is "Didn't like the date". Like, NONE of them
---
Killers on suicide watch this week
---
I don't get why they keep throwing money at this guy. The only reason I gather might be that they are very much like him, but cannot be the same type of asshole in their everyday life for various reasons. 
---
So they keep supporting him to live vicariously through him.
---
You‚Äôll get them more often if you learn how to loop. If you throw them down early you can obviously never get the stun. 
---
Well i guess I'll save a few milliseconds of time going forward now &amp; not even bother rating my matches....
---
Appreciate it! 
---
Welcome to the internet
---
its about the size of a tier 2 overcharge 
---
Hey iron will is quite a good perk. Reduces sounds by 100% in its final form. If you use a female character there sounds are usually more noticeable in game so this negates that weakness and you still keep a smaller harder to see hit box. Also great against 2 top tier killers nurse and spirit. Great
---
Absolutely. I notice a trend that has been going on for a while though, that nice, calm streamers (not just DBD, just gaming in general) often don't attract much subscribers with very, very few exceptions (CoryXKenshin is a good example of a succesful one). 
---
And it's not due to that they don't advertise themselves, or that their content is uninteresting. But for many viewers being polite and nice seems to equal being boring: they'd rather watch someone hurling insults and slurs. Maybe because they themself would rather love doing that, but are afraid of the social backlash.
---
Yeah. Some Nurse kept me for 55 minutes in a corner. I posted about that a few weeks ago. 
---
OhTofu and HybridPanda are my go-to DBD streamers when they‚Äôre live. Puppers also but usually only when neither of them are live. 
---
If you want to balance around SWF that's a good idea and fine. But if you just give every survivor a totem counter than NOED will be weakened. Period. Don't argue otherwise, please, that's just dishonest.
---
So we could include the counter, that raises solo survivors to SWF level (almost), which is good. But in turn, NOED as a perk will be weakened, so we'd either have to change how the perk works or buff it. Or accept that it will just be dropped.
---
Claudette would teach them how to use active camouflage instead of saying fuck. 
---
What if... Claudette uses swearing to toggle her active camouflage? 
---
That's what I was thinking too.
---
Or just get morid. Old DS at least helped a bit vs mori.
---
They made a prototype VR version of friday the 13th Carter testing it the decided that the world wasnt ready for that. Those were their words
---
Is that why you pallet loop and teabag poor Myers :&lt;
---
Dude you are so right. This is the devs fault for leaving this exploit in the game. They also shouldnt force people to cheat. The nerve of them to reset their levels as a lesson. Totally unacceptable. /s don't cheat. 
---
I play killer sometimes but not much. Like I said in another comment, i play this game with friends so I don‚Äôt do it often. I‚Äôm rank 15 killer and have not found it difficult in the slightest to get to that rank. I can easily get 4k‚Äôs without camping or being toxic in the slightest. So all the complaining I see by killer mains in my opinion is BS. I think survivor is way more difficult and I think all the updates within the last year have made it even more difficult. All of the most recent new killers are impossible to counter. Like I don‚Äôt even want try when I see that it‚Äôs Legion, Clown or Spirit because I don‚Äôt know how to win against them 
---
Why is Claudette in the normal section? She would totally eat the wrapper and bury the chocolate.
---
This is a cursed image. Take it down.
---
I really do think people undersell the legion. He may be a teen, but he is BRUTAL. Just look at the now famous pic of him in the mirror, they all count their kills. 
---
I'm not saying that he is stronger than David, he probably isn't, but I am saying that he deserves more credit. 
---
Besides, Frank WAS a foot ball player, he HAS had some physical activity under his belt too. That said, what does he have that David doesn't? 
---
The drive.
---
Hell, we saw it first hand. Legion clearly had David under his thumb in his trailer, and even if it was 1v1, Legion is faster, more dangerous in close combat, and armed. 
---
Bill had GUNS. 
---
Tapp had BACKUP... And guns. 
---
Meg... Um... She is fast? 
---
Legion may be a teen, but damn, I think I would rather fight David. 
---
David would leave you with a broken nose, Legion would leave you for dead.
---
Plus it is kinda funny thinking of Susie fucking MANHANDLING Jeff, come on
---
Yeah there are probably a lot of trolls in the mix, too. But I have encountered more than enough people over the past years who really and honestly behave like dicks and feel entitled to do so without being called out on it.
---
Tru3's great because he explains *everything* he does. He's not the best but it's a good stream to learn from.
---

[Its the perfect combo](https://i.redd.it/fkv35d651l621.jpg)
---
Sweet fan art. I might have to switch from Pig main to a Nea main now.
---
The bio said freddy didn't die when the parents killed him and death didnt want him a second time. It then said he lured Quentin back to the preschool to get revenge on him because he woke nacy up (his obsession) and saved her from him. So given that info and what the devs said that timeline has to be 3 years after the movie. That was the moment the entity took them both. At that point quentin disappeared and freddy heard others roaming the halls. 
---
I swear they always give the map offering to the survivor... or at least they do every time I burn a map offering as killer. 
---
Doc
---
Santa clown. Easy choice
---
Please color this it‚Äôs beautiful 
---
I had this hapoen the other night. Meng and I had a good ol time farming. 
---
Legion mains don‚Äôt deserve names anymore lmao
---
Yeah, I gave up on the leg. As for the knife, that‚Äôs (for some reason) the default size for Michael‚Äôs knife in SFM and I forgot to resize.
---
Noob3 is a sound guy and he‚Äôs also genuinely very good at the game. His streams are so relaxing and entertaining at the same time. I watch on PS4 and just turn the chat off so I can‚Äôt see it cos his fans can be a bit weird. 
---
I started as a survivor main and was always a bit timid to playing killer. Then, one day I decided to switch over to killer and never look back. Once I got in touch with the entity, I just wanted to brutally murder every survivor I came in contact with. Now I‚Äôm a happy Santa clown serving the entity every day. 
---
I just hate when the killer DCs pretty early on, so I didn‚Äôt really have time to do things to get bloodpoints, but I still get negative rank progress for the match even though it was because of the killer 
---
You are going to love her teachables, specifically hex ruin. Really good perk. 
---
Devour hope can also be great if the survivors fail to find the totem. Having exposed then moris will cause survivors to drop what they are doing and hunt the hell out of totems.
---
Hex third seal can be good if you are slugging. Hooking will show the survivors the bubble but then not the aura of the hooked survivor so it can be useful if you hook someone in an abstract place.
---
The hag herself is really strong but she has a learning curve. Need to set up webs of her traps. She becomes really strong when hooking survivors as she can make unhooking really dangerous.
---
What you said is true. Freddy only has a few things going for him. He can see you after he dreamscapes you no matter where you go and he can sneak up behind you to pull you in because you don't see him. Now smart players run when they hear the lullaby but for some reason 90% of people wont get off a gen until they get interrupted by the dream pull. I main freddy and because i do so going against him is easy for me. 
---
Once it's gone you lose the benefits 
---
Can we bring attention to the fact that billy did so terribly on a farm map
---
I agree with that. 
---
no he just has to let you fall before DS triggers, like now.
---
Id rather spend money on any cosmetics. 90% of cosemetics arent even that great so after a few outfits there isn't much of a point to spend shards on them when you can get perks and bp. If I want to play someone new im not going to do it with no perks. 
---
HybridPanda is probably the biggest youtuber known for DBD. He streams often as well, but doesn't limit himself to DBD only. He used to be part of the Yogscast I believe.
---
Almost four you mean. Came out June 2016, so its fourth anniversary is in three months.
---
Kind of offended, I am an ace main and I would be at the tier above the top tier shown in this table
---
Yeah bp gain is sucky on survivor. Distressing will become the Walmart version of bbq if they‚Äôve changed it to all categories of points 
---
I see people go into lockers in the killer room a lot with bbq. I dont think its what happened here because you surely would have been too close tocsee but its obvious when they are 20 meters below the ground and they make a door closing motion. 
---
If you‚Äôve got spare shards get it anyway because why not 
---
the best perk
---
Yeah I think that was the idea. Because BBQ was the only way for 100% BP gain they made distressing for people who don't have BBQ. The BP perk for survivor is free so I'm guessing they thought it was only fair for people who don't have Leatherface.
---
I‚Äôm just a lowly console player so I have never had this experience 
---
The sad thing about wglf is that it encourages farming and has no other benefit to survivors 
---
Look it's good artwork but there's a lot of kids who play dbd and are on the subreddit (fact check it). Go to dbdgonewild please
---
Welcome, hope you find something you like.

In my experience anybody I sleep then don't chase will immediately wake up from self care checks

I use DH a lot, on spirit it is handy that survivor don't dare cleanse the totems, but with TOTH, DH becomes a strong perk on many killers and even without TOTH, if you get lucky and survivors don't run into the totem untill you get 3 stacks, then there isn't much the survivors can do except for getting the fuck out
---
Hag + Rusty Shackles + Mint Rag + Hex: ToTH is the best gen protection imo. I had matches when literally everybody knew where my totems are (because they already touched each one of those at least once), but they refused to touch my totems further because they knew I'll slap their booty after that
---
This susie looks like she came out straight out of a creepy pasta
---
i once had a survivor saying that moonwalking as a killer is an exploit XD

---
This is my favourite out of all the art on this sub, really amazing looking.  
---
Good job! :D  
---
If you rob a store they don‚Äôt just make you give the items that you stole back and then let you off. You‚Äôre punished for it as well as having to give the stuff back. It‚Äôs the same here. You used an exploit and got caught so they reset what you cheated to get and your punishment was getting other characters reset too. Grow up ffs
---
Technically you can unlock em all for free, that is what I do, unlocking them trough gameplay, but the only killers you get at the start are Hillbilly, Wraith, Trapper, Nurse and Huntress
---
Not toxic at all. If you don‚Äôt wanna loose your bp and you have an opportunity, just leave your game on in the background and go afk. They‚Äôll get bored eventually. You just need to outlast them.
---
Yeah I agree! He just took this picture after I finished my mask I‚Äôm still adding some details to the outfit! :)
---
*lifted* the hook? please elaborate 
---
Hag is a good killer if played correctly, I feel that should be A class, billy could go up to S so could spirit. Tapper could go up to A/B, he has high map pressure and can cut off almost every loop, as a trapper main i know of some places where traps can be placed to make them almost invis, huntress isnt A teir, but thats from a console standpoint, pig can add lots of pressure too. I also LOVE actionmaster wraith 
---
He got the boop 
---
Up the whooooooo
---
Genuinely the only players (other than cheaters) that I truly hate. Face campers are dumb but can be countered with two or more people and in specific circumstances are understandable, 360 dukes and flashlight spam is annoying as shit but fair game, unhooks infront of the killer suck balls but they probably don't know any better. But farmers, fuck farmers. Ruin every game their in, there's no way to counter them and stop the farm, and I either have to zero bloodpoint depip to get out or wait 5-10 minutes for another match while the gens and gates finish. Report them everytime, it even says on the report feature working with the killer and not engaging with gameplay.
---
Bold of you to assume Adam isn't further to the southwest. 
---
Also, no Feng? She's definitely near the top.
---
You lift with your knees not your back
---
*cough* ***MYC*** *cough*
---
? Ds is gonna get gutted soon, iron will is pretty balanced imo 
---
I have only been playing half as long as him, and have half the hours he has, but...
---
I grew up, while he regressed into an entitled child with a superiority complex. Winning is second to fun for me, while he needs to make people upset to even feel anything other 5han salt.
---
Dude is a fucking loser, because he thinks his worth is tied to his gameplay, so he ends up an emotional wreck in a few matches, all the while sweating his ass off to try and tilt other players. 
---
Even past the killer Nea jokes, Nea mains always seem to teabag, fail flashlight saves, sandbag, and in general act like Ochido while imitating NO0B3.
---
Dont ever disrespect david and nea like this again
---
Dwight sees all from the locker
---
You never won nothing. You took that picture by default mawma. 
---
I would posit that only Nurse and Billy can really function well without addons. All killers are weaker without them and most killers are easily countered by competent survivors if only using their base power. Those two are the exceptions because they directly reward skilled play and either punish mistakes brutally or outright change the chase parameters to where you're not even playing the same type of game.
---
I‚Äôd rather farm then fight legion tbh sorry 
---
The skillcheck happens during pickup so the juggle cannot be used.
---
Wait I'm confused, isn't hag a default killer??
---
Yeah DS is completely useless now and Iron Will is overrated. But make sure to keep pretending you've played survivor before and how happy you're with the changes &gt; As A SuRviVor MaIn
---
No it's complete dogshit.
---
a feng min once farmed me without even waiting for the spirit to leave, not even in phase. I went from no-hook to dead in under 30 seconds, completely out of my control. Agree with you completely.
---
You get the camos and lickage, welcome tote zomunity
---
ah nice. 
---
I have a feeling bill would yell at you if you didn't snap them correctly. 
---
yea everyone should be beautiful tall and blond right ?
---
You‚Äôll also find that those same survivors are the type that wait at pallets instead of looping for as long as they can on that one pallet. 
---
People like this can single hand rely lose games. 
---
Survivor tbags furiously
---
Ah see. I was never a part of the community at that time,  but would have loved to experience it.
---
This
---
Yeeeee Haaaaaawwww! ‚ÄúChainsaw noises‚Äù
---
Aww, I forget the tree guy's name, from Fallout 3.
---
Herman? 
---
Yea Cwalk is a great person and he honestly deserves more vievers. 
---
When they tbag and flashclick they won't DC after I down them because a lot of those players are like that
---
Rather than uselessly commenting "this", you should try adding something to the thread.  If you agree with someone's comment, simply upvote them.
---
Puppers is good. Hybrid Panda is also really funny and positive!
---
Puppers gets my prime sub every month, he's such a positive, nice person and he's very entertaining. Check out his old streams and cos plays on YouTube, his Bill and locker cos plays are two of my favourites. 
---
He really does. He's definitely growing though. His 4Headery is like none other haha
---
Now who's uselessly commenting?
---
Don't let computers win, folks. Never give up.
---
Yeah but my slippery meat makes me avoid traps
---
That's how killer's emblems look after 4K in the current PTB
---
minuscule is even an understatement. It was nonexistent. 
---
Unfortunately, prestiging ONLY grants skins atm. Maybe the devs will adress this one day (doubt it though)
---
well it was painfully annoying for killers everywhere. maybe they could've spaced the hooks properly so survivors actually have a chance to wiggle free.
---
Yes, but if you knew that the killer has a mori you could purposefully go down away from a hook/have wiggle ds which is hard to predict. 
---
You could still try to push things in your favour.
---
They are talking about the old DS.
---
Hopefully never. 
---
On Badham, this is possible with luck 0.
---
Can confirm, love seeing reactions to children speaking the forbidden syllable
---
He just turned into an alcoholic. Sad really.
---
I had a similar issue with hxy and it ended the same way. DBD seems to attract a few toxic streamers, but the fans who support them are much more telling. 
---
As someone who had never played Left For Dead, i can‚Äôt confirm nor deny your comment. But I‚Äôm gonna trust you on that one.
---
What did you do to that Feng?
---
Oh no, I'm gay
---
hello gay. I'm dad.
---
Someone should start a thread just discussing old, funny features about the game
---
legit nothing, i hadn't seen her the entire game up until that point
---
Maybe you don't know but you can buy original chars with the in-game shards. But you need to pay 9k for each killer /survivor. And you don't get a "skin" with you get when you buy the whole dlc. 
---
Where's kate?
---
Was it the endgame???? Lol
---
Yeah, but that's why it been nerfed in the end. I agree, Mori should be nerfed too
---
Oh my God, I did something like that before, me as Meg and the killer as Myers hhah. YoshiSmiles, he's in the same DBD group like me in Facebook XdxDxaDxdxdx 
---
Okay let me rephrase:
---
Being banned for no good reason.
---
A rainbow meg oO so rare
---
Part 2 remastered is coming do not fret
---
I got you man
---
Mistymils doesn‚Äôt stream dbd all the time but she‚Äôs fun to watch when she does
---
As an Adam main, he not only yells at people who teach kids fuck, he also actively makes sure to glare at them at all points afterwards. 
---
lol don't say sorry, it's fun to hear this from newer players
---
The fuck you say to me you little shit? How are you how are you not in school? You kiss your mother with that mouth? Its called its called you kiss your mother with that mouth? JWKSJSJDBJWK YOU SHUT UP WHEN IM TALKING TO YOU
---
He also throws a rock at them once they turn their backs
---
That was the best part in the whole video lol
---
Flair checks out
---
It is so true, so heartbreaking i can't stand it anymore.  
---
I must end it all.
---
That was the best part in the whole video
---
WE NEED TO ASK HIM! ILL GO FOLLOW HIM INTO THAT WEIRD FOREST
---
How many characters did you glitch ? If you did like everyone then I can see why they took it all away. 
---
I don't know why people need to call a streamer names on their channel and then act surprised when the streamer puts them on blast and mutes them. Their stream is like their home. Would you let some random stranger disrespect you in your house and not kick them out? If you don't like how they are playing leave the stream and find someone else.  
---
I LOVE LIFE
---
Don't dig up tweets from 5 years ago to create some kind of outrage. People can change and if you can't find anything recent then it just makes you look like you're reaching 
---
You‚Äôll find all your teammates have probably wasted them. 
---
David would definitely be the kind of person to yell at the people teaching kids, but while he does it he uses fuck every other word.
---
Shame she looks nothing like this. 
---
Is this OC? Finna send it to a discord and I'd like to credit the artist. this is a very good
---
Lots of killer perks got adjusted to fall in line for consistency to their t3 versions. Thanatopobia also got hella buffed and Fire Up got adjusted, so to say. 
---
Yeah, because the kitkat wasn't enough...he's off, seeking more kitpussys to break open.
---
yeah but still 
---
He‚Äôs just an angry man child can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs a whisperer. 
---
hehe she's being caring 
---
Thanks for the nice words :)
---
I was sad at the beginning cause killer isn't third person, I like to see my character. But First person is better for the chase. And yeah we don't see as much as you survivors, buuut the thing we Do see is 'focused'  lol
---
And nothing more fun then walking somewhere but then stopping in your tracks cause you heard grass move for just a second but it's all you need to start scanning that area, and that survivor staying still like "oh shit" or running off in panic
---
Being civil = downvoting everything the other person says. Braindead fuckboy thinks his passive agressiveness is completely fine.
---
someone linked it after I could not figure it out. it's a Japanese artist. 
---
These tweets are 5 years old, you probably did or said things 5 years ago that you aren‚Äôt proud of, as did most people. People change, no need to go around snooping and digging up their past just to create some Twitch/Reddit drama. Invest in a new hobby imo. 
---
please dont do that, its just a pain in the ass for the killer, and just for few points. 
---
yes it is‚ù§
---
I had a dream too, but I was still the killer mwhuhahahahaha!
---
AFAIK you smack your obsession, switch to treatment mode and the 32m TR is on them now and you can get 0TR shocks while your obsession can potentially put their allies in more madness tiers. Also any perks are viable on any killer if you know what you‚Äôre doing. 
---
Buddy go tell it to your boosted SWF-squad, youre whiteknighting a guy who doesnt bring medkits or self-care, anyways bye.
---
Oh damn, that was educational. Thanks!
---
Karma stings man, like a hook in the shoulder
---
He suck a pickle through a vacuum hose. 
---
The Kate one makes me mad
---
I ain't downvoting anything though? I disagree with you sure, but I'm not downvoting because I don't really care as much as you obviously do. May seem like a brush-off but it's the truth; I don't NEED to make everything me.
---
You still have to worry about Blood Trail tho.
---
Same with Marth
---
Ungrateful survivors, like they survive but feel the need to call you names regardless, even though no camping, hook patrolling or tunneling has been done
---
Why I don't use slippery meat
---
I hear you. It's my least favorite map, no matter which side I'm playing, but when I play Huntress I absolutely loathe it (I never DC, but on that map I always think about it).
---
I hope you never have to deal with that kind of nonsense again. :( 
---
Without Whispers it can take forever to find an immersed Survivor on any map.
---
Nice backpedaling, buddy
---
They're called germans and russians and they're just assholes, can't do much about em.
---
I thought most guys liked their women short/ average length, not tall. 
---
don't worry I'll tunnel them
---
 Just had a Feng who got hooked at the end with three gens done and killer was Doctor.
---
I was almost T3 and he was hovering her so rather than trying to save her and getting killed mused I started hunting for the hatch as I had a key. However, she sits there the entire time, he finds me, chase ensues, can‚Äôt find hatch as it‚Äôs in the corn somewhere, she refuses to give up the ghost, Rush for pallets, there are none, they‚Äôd all been wasted, inevitably get downed and rage DC as if it wasn‚Äôt for the silly cow on the hook holding out for no fucking reason (I wasn‚Äôt escaping that chase in T3 with no pallets) I could have found the hatch from he sound queue, but no they held on have the killer a 4K they didn‚Äôt deserve as they‚Äôd been camping but the other three all but fed them.
---
I FUCKING HATE RANK RESET
---
I really dislike him so I don‚Äôt watch him but do you really expect a steamer to just let you insult them ? The whole point of mods is to kick people who do that and spam excessively 
---
I don‚Äôt get why anyone would be surprised that if you come into someone‚Äôs ‚Äúhome‚Äù that they‚Äôll just let you make fun of them lol 
---
I think its great that Quinn is alone because nobody knows what he is
---
Dwight teaches kids to say fuck and then yells at himself
---
Mhm. Honestly think they should go back to the former rankingsystem so that people would be forced to actually do shit in order to get rankup
---
Idk I kind of think of Kate as the one who says "why the fuck are you teaching them to say fuck" *in front of* the kids. 
---
Putting Decisive on the Shrine before it gets nerfed, I see. :^)
---
Serious moment though with the exception of Overwhelming this is a pretty legit Shrine. Iron Will for the 30 billionth time but all the perks are good.
---
Soon....too soon..I'm not ready..PTSD
---
Jendenise is a cunt
---
who left my girl feng outta this 
---
Literally no one outside of reddit circlejerking cares you got banned by a streamer. Go outside. 
---
I can see where youre coming from here. I lose more then half my games as survivor (on xbox) because of a spirit, Michael or Lag. The idea of the killer deciding how you play is kind of what the game is built around. I found that playing with friends helps immensely because you could have someone to get mad with. Or if youre really desperate, find a new player and use them as a rank anchor.
---
Because 
---
Other 
---
Survivors
---
Don‚Äôt 
---
Matter 
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of random perk generators posted on here. When I get bored I like to use one just to see the weird combos I get and how well I can play with them. 
---
Sure they can but Germans have it in their blood so therefore they are always assholes. There's also a streamer called gammalunatic who does nothing but camp and spam ebony mori's, guess where he's from? Most viewed German streamer is a camping asshole with 2000+ hours. 
---
Just went against this guy 2200 hour german player who has 17 pages of -rep because he camps, he was using ebony mori with 2 very rare/ultra-rare addons right on rank reset day, just very friendly people though, nothing wrong with germans, literally 9/10 asshole killers are from germany or russia, [https://steamcommunity.com/id/graffit2/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/graffit2/). but "don't say it though that's politically incorrect and you're evil" go tell it to your communist leader.
---
As a offended Feng main I am gonna do that to you right about now :( 
---
Laurie should be right next to Ace. 
---
Maybe this is just me, but I swear, every time I hook one she just yeets herself off without Deliverance.
---
That aside most of these are fairly spot on and Tapp's position is perfect. Almost nobody ever saves a Danny Glover when he gets stuck on a hook. It's made me reluctant to hook them, because they usually just die there.
---
I like the zone
---
He also said you'd probably run to reddit afterwards.
---
Make your choice is fine. You have to be 32 meters away from the hook AND it can only be applied to one person at a time. 60 seconds of instadown just for hiding in a locker? And it reveals your location? That‚Äôs way too much. 
---
Iron Maiden is fine. If you HAD to buff it at all, maybe a 20 second exposed timer, but it‚Äôs fine as is. Your proposed buff would make it insanely broken. 
---
Hopefully never; but if they do, it'll be alongside the DLC update. That is most likely going to land on the 19th of March. 
---
&gt;Its not easy. You will either get 3 or 4k or you will get **no one.**
---
*laughs in camper*
---
Crawling towards the Hatch.
---
That‚Äôs not how these posts work. Freddy is the worst killer, and I‚Äôve had SEVERAL conversations trying to convince me otherwise. If I wanted upvotes, I‚Äôd make memes, but I don‚Äôt care about upvotes. 
---
I mean a lot of subreddits have less than 3000 subs
---
Its completely useless now and here's are a few killermains who will tell you it's still useful but it's not. Mark this fucking comment and read it back after it gets -30'd on this subreddit and then in 2 months look how many DS's you will see in your games.
---
Don‚Äôt sweat I recorded it on my iPad from my tv don‚Äôt have the equipment for this but I understand 
---
Yes it is, I drew it myself!
---
Wait so its literally only useful for 60 seconds after first hook? Wow... yikes
---
I never use a good item without using a ward
---
What about brutal? I get that with no kills. I play the legion. I'm wondering why I do good with him, but not with anyone else when it comes to ranks. I'll have decent games and not pip, while doing almost nothing and pip with legion. 
---
I really fucking hate that man.
---
if every men are 2m high then average length for women become 1m80.
---
it's not specially interesting in the subject but personally i like strong and tall women as well as short or "average" length women.
---
i'm just closed to easy girls.
---
Did legion become OP or something? I stopped playing a bit after he was added
---
She is the cutest :3
---
Was it a bug just now when I couldn‚Äôt snap out of Madness 3 while injured? I didn‚Äôt really have a way to get healed, was unable to interact with anything, and trying to snap out just flashed to prompt but didn‚Äôt progress at all
---
‚ÄúWTF I DID A CHEAT AND GOT BANNED??!?!??‚Äù
---
I try to save my really good items and addons for when I play with friends. That way if I die early on, I can tell them to grab my item and hope they can put it to good use and/or escape with it.
---
Other than that, I try not to let losing a good item or addon bother me too much. I always tell myself I can get more!
---
Hard to be relaxing when he has notifications on for 100 bits minimum.
---
Sorry no, it's just similar 
---
I would switch to legion IMMEDIATELY 
---
DUDE
---
Thank you very much!!
---
Darn
---
Ahh thank you so much!! :') 
---
I don't care. I bring them in with the expectation of losing them and I don't use keys/toolboxes because I actually want the game to be fun and have like 30 purple flashlights at least and rarely use them either.
---
On killer though having Doom Rngravings wasted pisses me off, everything else don't care tho.
---
Same, just to see how fast they disconnect
---
Multiple reasons.
---
1. Some people think Nea is ugly (she's not) so they say "Oh no it's the Killer!"
---
2. Samination made the famous DbD parody where the above happens.
---
3. Some Nea players, but NOT all of us, make it their mission to crouch around that map, or miss skillchecks, or otherwise get their fellow Survivor killed.
---
4. Some other Nea players, but NOT all of us, make it their mission to bully the Killer because they've seen No0b3. Basically they try to be a Killer of Killers.
---
Hope this clears that up.
---
-Sincerely,    
---
a Nea who genjockeys, runs BT, doesn't t-bag, and cleanses totems to counter NOED.
---
Don't even know if Nevil has Reddit
---
I agree with their message üëç
---
Na, he is even pretty weak, altough the problem is, it is just no fun to play against him, because he can get you if he wants. He will always kill at least one person, but never get the whole group, which is pretty frustrating for SWFs, many people DC when they play against him
---
Dude it is cool and all but then don't complain if me and my Swf team stun her and T Bag at the enter of rhe ComicCon
---
Debating on if I should get decisive or devour hope first 
---
I guess these players doesn't need to add salt to their pasta.
---
He's like Nurse but even more mind-numbing  to face, no real counterplay, if a Legion wants you dead you will die, there is nothing you can do because he puts a fixed timer on the chase.
---
Views from my mom's basement

*laughs in huntress *
---
I don‚Äôt use my best items unless I‚Äôm playing with friends. Or when I decide I‚Äôll prestige a characters, no point in not using them
---
When was the last time you puked while having flu.
---
If you have a flu, you cough and you have a runny nose.
---
No shit sherlock
---
Sadly this wasn't live, maybe boyfriend sent me this and said i should post it on reddit, i would have instantly swapped too, at least to make the picture üòÇ
---
Tbh bill would switch to the other side. 
---
As he would teach the kids to say fuck but indirectly, by cursing at the person teaching them.
---
It actually never do be like that...
---
Wait, you cant anymore? how does it work now?
---
Technically yes, in practice no.
---
It depends on his mood
---
Unless you can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt play for a week, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing this since it wastes quite some BP 
---
Where does the hate for Legion come from? They kinda counter SWF and moonwalking is BS but apart from that..?
---
Awwwww, was kinda hoping they only need one week again to release it, well, next week it is then.
---
Aww you make me bwush stepbro uwu
---
How does the Decisive Strike nerf affect other perks, mainly Object of Obsession?
---
Yeah we know you're a killermain, thank god you're consistent in your dumbassery by disagreeing on both my statemens, as a killermain you should just stfu and stop pretending this DS-thing wasn't a major nerf to survivors AGAIN.
---
If you are using object of obsession, you will lose the added aura reading bonus of being the obsession as it has shifted to someone else. It still has the same effect. 
---
Other obsession based perks will have their effects changed based on who the obsession is. For example rancors effect will simply change to another survivor if the obsession changes. 
---
Save the best for last will now impact the new obsession meaning hitting them will make you lose points. This can actually work to the killers advantage for perks that benefit while the obsession is alive. For example if your obsession kills themself on the hook or you kill them early, Save the best for last cannot gain any tokens as the obsession is dead. If you switch obsession to a living survivor in the same game then you can start to regain tokens. 
---
The only perk I can really see suffering is dying light as it only works while the obsession is dead. If you switch obsession to a living obsession then you lose the effect. I suppose it can also work on your favour if you tunnel a player since you have already hooked them you save yourself the effort of having to find and hunt the obsession. Remember me can also be negatively affected. Changing obsessions from a dead to a living obsession means the new obsession can bypass the effects of the perk.
---
that happened years ago when the whole reddit is just low quality memes that are rinsed and repeated 
---
Imagine Ace eating his KitKat like that in the middle of a fucking Casino.
---
She pretty strong you just have to use her right
---
Survivors cant tell if you are using your power if they are within you radious with this in mind you can fake using it and they will most likely walk into you when you get to a loop start using her power (or fake) and listen to sunds of grass moving(or moaning if they are injured) and you can catch thwm easily
---
Because lorewise Claudette is a rule following little nerd who probably doesn't even know there's other ways to eat a KitKat.
---
Imagine leaving the map with the highest amount of safe pallets and the greatest pallet density ever.
---
But if you want to play as an invisible character isnt wraith best?
---
As a partial David Main can say that yes, he would. ~~Even if it would be an accident because he's probably as much a dumbass as me~~
---
She is litteraly one if the strongest killers in the game
---
I play all characters where do I go
---
Feng isnt on there because decent Feng mains dont get hooked
---
It seems like ever since the in game shop was made a thing, I have noticed a lot of toxic Feng's as well.
---
t-h-i-c-c?
---
bnp was crazy op also, they can nerf op shit. we all know killers will cry about adrenaline next, they should nerf moris in the meantime. the red one and the "kill 1" should only work after 2 hooks. i would not touch the kill the last survivor one.
---
If you ask me, then i think you should max Wraith. Play only him.
---
But for real! Do not ask stupid questions! Do what you want to do and not what others want.
---
This happened to my friend and he didn't bitch half as much, and that is after I took the piss because I warned him if he was caught he would get punished. They took away the stuff you cheated to get and then as punishment booted you down to rank 1 on the characters you cheated with. It is up to the devs what the punishment is for breaking the rules not you. Christ imagine if a criminal in court suddenly got up in arms because he felt the punishment was too harsh and used lame excuses like 'they didn't lock their door so how was I supposed to know I couldn't go in and take their things.' 
---
You come across super entitled crying about being punished for doing something that any idiot can see would be cheating and then using the excuse it wasn't made clear this earned a ban before hand. Maybe don't take a game so serious and use the life lesson that just because you find an opportunity to cheat the system doesn't mean you should take it and if you do accept the punishment and move on. 
---
it‚Äôs patched in the ptb
---
u funny
---
She is pretty strong. My friend is a Spirit main and can consistently get 4Ks. Like said above, you just need to be able to use her right. 
---
No, it's left
---
Yes it does.
---
They aren't wrong
---
Smh
---
Wraith can be easily seen if you pay attention he shimmers when hes walking
---
Angry germans downvoting the truth, you people caused both world wars and it's not a coincedence, sorry not sorry.
---
it‚Äôs a scumbag legion that‚Äôs proud of people disconnecting, you really think they care about other human beings?
---
The "Grey Performance Top". A common torso item. I wouldn't know if it's exclusive to PC. 
---
they arent wrong 
---
I thought about "Mori after 2 hooks" too. I thought it will make Mori's kinda worthless tho. Maybe they need some additional conditions, like "can be moried after 1st hook if N amount of time has passed after"/
---
I won't cry about Adrenaline as killer :) But I wasn't like crying about DS either, it just feels easier to breathe now
---
This is the most wholesome comment I‚Äôve gotten so far and I‚Äôm crying in the club, ily 
---
Plague is like:
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
thanks, comes off as weird that's the Nea stereotype when I play for Stealth Altruism all the time.
---
Need this as a new cosmetic for Myers.
---
Just to clarify since OP failed to point this out. He did get a ban, if I am right its only like 48hrs and it was on coming back OP saw that they had also removed all the progress he cheated for but in doing so booted ever character they cheated with to rank 1 again. Probably like most people pointed out because they can't distinguish what levels and items came from cheating so to reinforce the punishment they just kick you back to 1.
---
‚Äúyo why the fuck my candy bar so crunchy??‚Äù 
---
Yes it is, I drew it myself! :)
---
80 seconds is tier 1
---
It's more than the killer simply need not target the guy who just got unhooked, it only lasts 60 seconds
---
Same here, Im playing in my alt account now
---
Did you forget injured survivors leave blood and make sound so them hising would require leaving scratchmarks, blood behind and make sound.
---
Jane so Thicc she took Jeff‚Äôs seat.
---
Personally, I would use a random perk generator and play around with them. Can be really fun for seeing how you can make each perk work. 
---
Could also try experimenting with different perk builds. 
---
I had this idea of trying to combine trapper with third seal. When a survivor gets trapped his aura is no longer shown to survivors and when combined with the honing stone, he is left in dying state if he escapes. The idea of the survivors being left clueless to where each other entices me to play around with that. If it's viable or not is a different question but if you have gotten everything then I would say its worth actually playing the game and exploring the different killers and synergies. Then maybe you could post your findings on the subreddit.
---
I do get irritated as it seems I do get found first/tunneled/farmed/camped when I do decide to bring something good in or a streamer. Kinda why I rarely bring anything above a yellow now unless playing with friends.
---
Pretty sure it does
---
"this better have some fockin' protein to it. shit tastes like dirt."
---
Her smug aura mocks me

I really hope you're trolling me, but on the chance you aren't I'll reiterate my statement:
---
***People*** ***can*** ***be assholes*** ***regardless*** ***of their*** ***country of origin******.*** 
---
Your 'blood' doesn't make you a jerk, you and your actions do.
---
Go into invis, find a gem thats being worked on and walk past each side til your paths is blocked. Come out of invis and grab the survivor that‚Äôs on the gen. She‚Äôs a really good killer you just need more practice, Monto plays a great Spirit I‚Äôd recommend watching him for reference.
---
this week is really nice, but I already got all 3 perks that I needed DX, if ds can make it, when will bbq be there it been so long
---
Kinda feel bad for Nea but at the same time she probably tried to spray paint into a Killers Mouth as a reflex before.
---
Yes that is wrong. The 100% that is states is ONLY for We‚Äôll make it. Botany and WMI does stack for a sweet 133%.
---
David @ the other survivors: ‚Äúy‚Äôall eat your KitKats with or without the peel?‚Äù
---
I hate rank rest because all the Noed try-hards come out...
---
same
---
I'd recommend either playing a different game for a bit or playing Killer instead. The first few days after Rank Reset are always very... interesting.
---
Bill is very wholesome
---
I got to rank 1 for the first time yesterday, now that i have the achievement i can finally chill and now tryhard
---
Disagree. You need to wait for the killer to act before you act accordingly. Some pallets if not broken act as infinite‚Äôs, I need to know you‚Äôre going to break it before I look for another loop. 
---
Also if you leave before killer breaks it you often give up any headstart you had by the killer just walking around the pallet and by that point you‚Äôre nowhere near a loop and go down instantly. You need to know what the killer will do before you act. Blindly running away will get you killed quicker than waiting for the killer to move. 
---
When I talk about waiting at pallets I mean to get a stun guaranteed without making the killer chase you round the loop once or twice. It‚Äôs all about time management. I know I‚Äôm going to probably go down eventually. It‚Äôs about how much of the killers time I can waste before doing so. Not waiting at each pallet to get a guaranteed stun before running to the next. That‚Äôs bad play and you often waste less time doing that than effectively looping. 
---
If you could stop running through my post history and trying to disagree with everything I say I‚Äôd appreciate it. Thanks. 
---
I bet you are the kinda guy that believes free healthcare exists
---
Proud of you &lt;3
---
Should I get Decisive or DH in shrine rn??
---
Noed tryhards are all over the place at rank 1 too though 
---
There is a learning curve with sprit but once you get passed it you will find spirit to be one of the best killers within the game.
---
Her strongest thing is that she is great for mind games. With Spirit, you do not want to chase survivors around loops without using or fake using your power. Her 110% movement speed destroys her loop potential. if you are being looped just standing still leaves the survivor having to guess if you are using your power or not. This can result in them abandoning the loop or even walking towards you. If you injure a survivor then you can track him down while phasing using the sound of his whimpers.
---
I would suggest watching tru3talent if you want to see some high-level killer plays using the spirit or any killer for that matter. Watching him really improved how I play.
---
This comment has been my favorite so far
---
I‚Äôll just enjoy my games while I‚Äôm not at rank 1 yet 
---
&lt;3
---
I think you can avoid self healing by pressing movement keys.
---
You approach a hooked survivor and you keep W pressed that way you can't self heal.
---
But I'm not sure... It's been ages since I last ran self care.
---
Literally 80% of my games as spirit are 3 or 4ks
---
Bottom left: Gens  
---
Top: Runners  
---
Bottom right: Altruism
---
One of these a day is gonna be Picasso in a year or two. Keep up the good work homie!
---
What is it your looking forward to most with Jane? her perks or her thiccness?
---
There is my confusion :D lol thanks for clearing that up. For a second I thought you got Bill instead of Tapp but then I was sure I had seen PC players using Tapp. 
---
Wraith isn't truly invisible and basically gives survivors a free sprint burst every time he wants to get a hit.
---
Bold of you to assume feng min does anything helpful for her team
---
No problem. &lt;3
---
And yeah it's odd, but almost all stereotypes are wack.
---
 "People can eat rice regardless of their country of origin" yeah but asians still eat rice like 100s as much as other people, same with Germans they're assholes 100x as much as regular people. Prove me wrong or don't respond.
---
That's a fair decision. DS nerf will happen soon so I would make use of the perk I suppose while it lasts.
---
Virgins. 
---
All you need to do is play and you‚Äôll get there easily. Ranking system is actually a joke, Until the next patch at least
---
The reports do sonething only if there is a massive number of them on a single player. Legends say that once every complete solar eclipse someone actually gets banned
---
Great to hear people are enjoying the game!
---
Ty :)

---
Breaking off a piece = The canonical way.
---
Eating it from the top = The lazy yet understandable way.
---
Eating it from the side = The Doth'raki way.
---
Humans don't recognize that last one and you should alert Area 51 of invaders.
---
Bill main here. Would do that.
---
Well there's The Shape's add-on
---
Alternatively: Using Deliverance for the kobe achievement but getting insta saved in front of the killer instead so you don‚Äôt get to use deliverance and also you‚Äôre in struggle now.
---
Weren't you practically able to heal damage before the killers cooldown even finished.
---
An acceptable power move
---
A survivor farming BP for a killer? It's always the other way around... 
---
I find it more likely you're getting downvoted because you're being openly racist on Reddit, but whatever.
---
And actually the Austria-Hungarian Empire and Russia both caused World War I as much as Germany did, by responding with excessive force to their respective issues, but, again, whatever.
---
I farm as a survivor 
---
Ermahgeplague
---
We also need Old Man Myers from H2018
---
When someone takes advantage of an obvious glitch. Such as when survivors get stuck somewhere (against a tree happens too often) and the killer just downs them and hooks them. It‚Äôs kinda crappy when you ‚Äòknow‚Äô they didn‚Äôt have a chance and they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. 
---
Rarely I‚Äôll have nice killers who will uproot me from the spot and let me go, at least for that moment.
---
It‚Äôs kind of a rare glitch these days (for me at least). 
---
Multiple questions:
---
1. Do FOV gains stack? Like Shadowborn and Monitor and Abuse?
---
2. Any tips for Legion? I struggle to get more than a 2k in any game and I'm not sure if I'm playing wrong or don't have the proper perks or what
---
3. Why is Nightmare not getting buffed???
---
4. Why is Wraith considered D tier by most people? I main him at rank 3 and consistently 3k
---
Jeff main, can confirm.
---
Gonna need my coffee as black as my metal.
---
Sure! I just have to find my pendrive and the upload it here
---
&gt; Prove me wrong or don't respond.
---
Typically the burden of proof falls on the one making the claim, not the person disputing it. If *you're* so certain that EVERY German EVER is an asshole, prove it.
---
Bill says fuck regardless. Why he only ever comes so close in L4D
---
Sure! I'll do it asap, sorry for the delay in answering
---
Nah they're definitly angry germans and you're an angry SJW.
---
I can‚Äôt believe you admitted to running a legion around for awhile lol reading the reddit you would think that‚Äôs not possible and they only last 10 seconds lol
---
For real tho that was shitty of them to dc because they got wrecked but not all legions are like that some don‚Äôt even use franks/cold dirt I rarely run into it, same with the moonwalking legion. Good on you for sticking it out against legion and not just dc when you see deep wound, at least you learned how to play against him 
---
Where else would you find some lewd thicc Huntress?
---
yes
---
Number 2 killer in the game. Devastating once mastered. You control the mindgames with her
---
So can Trapper. In fact, he actually does that better than she does. 
---
\*cough\*nosurprisethere\*cough\*
---
You sound like one of those teammates who self-care in the corner instead of doing something more important. You probably self-care against a Sloppy Butcher Legion too huh. 
---
Newsflash: self-care very often throws the game for your team by either allowing a hooked survivor to enter next stage, wasting time that absolutely needed to be on a gen, allowing the killer to snowball while you're doing nothing etc. 
---
Add the fact that you're putting too much importance on dbd's bad rank system, you sound like a useless teammate to me. 
---
Oh, I thought that you'll get better addons everytime that you prestige, in that case I'll just get those perks and keep grinding, thank you very much!
---
Everytime i bring a green i get tunneled as soon as the killer finds me.
---
However, i never waste good addons thanks to Black Ward
---
_"All in." he says smugly, waiting for the other Players to follow or quit. The American who had been so sure in his Cards seems almost hesitant as he follows. The rich Korean Man who'd been cursing about his Son quits, throwing a glare in Ace's direction. The Actress across from him stays, eyes determined even as she fumbles with her Cards.
---
Boredly Ace fishes inside his inner Pocket for the Candy Bar he'd saved. While the last Player, a nervous Man who didn't look like he knew what he was doing and generally seemed more like someone you'd expect to be a delivery Boy rather than a Casino Visitor, nervously shuffled in his place the Gambler probably had enough time to eat his KitKat.
---
The neevous Guy quit and as soon as it was his turn Ace grinned, taking a bit out of his KitKat before revealing his Hand. "Royal Flush", he states, revelling in the shocked expressions of everyone at the Table. "What the..." he hears someone start before abruptly shutting up.
---
It's only when he opens his eyes after a close-eyed Fingergun that he notes their gazes aren't directed at the cards, but rather at the KitKat next to them with a giant hole in it's middle._
---
Wasn't it when we'll make it worked on self healing. If you ran a full healing build you could self heal with a medkit in like 2 seconds. 
---
I‚Äôm pissing my fUCKING PANTS HSHSHS
---
Let's play a game together you without self-care/med-kit but with iron will and me with self-care or a medkit and see who gets more points/is more useful in the end bitch. What? No time? Don't feel like it? That's what I thought, gtfo boosted trash don't talk to me.
---
Shame he's taken. üò≠
---
I just wanted to play Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery‚Äôs but Noooooooo we get to play on fucking Rotten got damn bitch ass Abbitoir. 
---
Fuck you, Dwight. 
---
No hag does it way better than Trapper. Trapper has more obvious traps, you can walk around his traps in some instances, and Hag is better at pretty much everything. The only thing Trapper has over Hag is more MS, which doesn‚Äôt matter since Hag can teleport around. 
---
Ah, doesn't really matter, I've got over 5k karma so I can troll as much as I want üòÇ
---
Ahhh thanks for that.
---
Dwight main, definitely
---
Imagine not running balanced Landing or Lithe and being like this unironically. 
---
Nope. I think Ace In The Whole is the only perk that does. Otherwise I would probably expect to see the fortune Icon while searching if it did. 
---
Yeah.... Tell me how that went.
---
Or yaknow if we could just stay as a complete lobby instead of disbanding everyone and whoever wants to leave can without losing the whole lobby 
---
Stupid shit, like trying to play while moving backwards.  With a name like Backwards Man.
---
I played a game against a legion, and they brought franks mixtape and iridescent button, and when the game loaded up I was the only survivor. Felt bad for them.
---
Watch this and you know: https://youtu.be/arEkqdiMKNI
---
Her moth thi
---
The devs themselves have just said that NOED is in the perfect place. 
---
It‚Äôs just not fun to play against him. Impossible to counter is frenzy pretty much. 
---
I don't think I've been rude, name-called you, or been overly aggressive in the push for socially progressive ideals at any point during our discussion, but okay then.
---
&gt; That's my point mate, doing generators isn't a counter it's wasting a lot of time 
---
If the killer is yanking you off generators that's one thing, but if they're just running around the map with the other players and they're doing their farming thing, just do the gens yourself and leave. Why does a (farming) killer that lets you do generators and leave bother you more than a (camping) killer who is actively trying to prevent you from playing at all?
---
I've been in matches where a killer is getting looped by the other survivors for so long that I never get found, I finish the gens and leave without ever seeing them - how is that any different? :)
---
Prestiging your characters is worthless, all it serves to do is to take all the BP you put into that character and flush it down the drain for a reward that's nothing more than an artificial sense of progress and a shitty cosmetic.
---
&gt; You will have more chance to get better items on the bloodweb (addons, offerings)
---
Nope, this is basically a myth at this point, i think the most people have determined is that it's like a 1% increase in greens or some shit.
---
&gt;And you get a bloody skin for the killer every single time you prestige. 
---
Which looks horrible.
---
Ds boys, get it while it‚Äôs still toxic!
---
For everyone complaining that u/CynthiaArts forgot about Jake. They didn't, he's just had to be [taught how to eat it by the Entity](https://i.imgur.com/5advtJs.png).
---
Pissing off killers, save to say I won't be playing anymore after the next patch.
---
3rth from the right emblem
---
It‚Äôs a skill he wasn‚Äôt taught in the woods, I feel like if there was a ‚Äúaccidentally eats it with the wrapper‚Äù section, he‚Äôd be there with David
---
I'd probably be so mad to see that Guy and be told that he regularly wins Money. And I love that lmao.
---
Shoulda got all 12 hooks.
---
Don't care that 2 of them DCd....hook their lifeless DC'd ass again
---
I‚Äôve seen lots of these videos, and it‚Äôs always megs....
---
Step 6 of what he he has learnt: screw all the Steps. They're too tedious, eat the whole damn thing.
---
I'm still missing a couple of killers missing tier three, so I do have that to do. 
---
Otherwise, I like doing random perk wheels, which can be fun. If I'm survivor, I play with friends and we make up ridiculous rules like 'no hitting skill checks' or 'no standing still unless you're on a generator' or other things that turn out bad points wise, but are hilarious at the time. 
---
Recently, I got the chance to build up points for the new survivor and killer, so that grind was some fun. 
---
Meme builds are great. My two favorites? A challenge build for survivor including No Mither, Iron will, Tenacity, and Unbreakable. A totem protector build for killer including Thrill of the Hunt, Ruin, Devour Hope, and Haunted Grounds (on any fast killer, but hilarious for Spirit with her beads!) 
---
Or, I've done a thing where I've kept a list of all perks, and crossed them out as I used them until I've won a game (escaped or 4k) with every single perk on the list, no reusing them! It's easy in the beginning if you use meta builds, but then you get towards the end and it's like welp, what mess of a build do I make with these perks left?
---
And if I'm really not feeling the game, I take a couple weeks and swap games, coming back and feeling refreshed. Take a break, *play Civ V.*
---
You should really work on shading as it's clumsy and use various pencils to give drawings more depth, this looks like a sketch rather than a finished piece, good luck with learning!
---
Whoever downvoted this is a Bitch.
---
So basicly going to the other side of map and wasting that amount of time which is fucking good for freddy
---
This is why I avoid lobbies with suspicious looking Megs. 
---
I hit rank 4 for the first time but I didn‚Äôt get to 1 cause I haven‚Äôt been able to play. 
---
Burnt an Ebony Mori for a daily ritual, only have 2/4 DC just as I was about to kill them, managed to get one and the other escaped but man it felt like I‚Äôd wasted it.
---
It was an Ace :(
---
Legion with Franks mix tape is insta win cuz all the dcs
---
Because in that match stuff is actually happening, in that match I'm ready to go on saving the guy if needed and still have to avoid the killer if the loop comes by. Similarly if I get facecamped I just tell people to gen rush and we beat the killer, I really don't care about facecamps because they're easy as fuck to counter.
---
A farmer just wastes my time.
---
Brooooo for real, I get so discouraged. It's always like as soon as I'm at like mid 11 or 12 and then I get dicked by the reset.
---
Hahaha that Freddy 
---
I can make that happen ...
---
No its not. Sorry if im coming across a twat but these bragging posts are plain annoying.
---
You rank up by playing the game, its not hard to do so
---
If it's not a rare thing why isn't that percent higher? That's literally the definition of rare. 
---
My favorite thing is the last couple games on a killer or survivor where you use your best add ons and items without a care in the world. That in mind, if you're intending to prestige everyone eventually, I'd say just pick the person who has the most fun stuff on them!
---
Of course there are, never claimed otherwise. I just stated you need to play to rank up, meaning that regardless if you do well or not, you‚Äôll get there anyways. And that doesn‚Äôt take dedication. 
---
LMAO THAT WAS THE BEST SHIT I'VE SEEN IN DAYS!
---
I'm not 100 percent sure on this one but when I faced a killer that got stuck in the air somehow and on a rock/wall I usually let them hit me to see if that helps. Sometimes it does and other times not. 
---
The locker squeaks when you open in, even if you open it slowly. Plus they can hear your breathing, which can be amplified by perks. Since it was the basement, they could have seen you go down with Territorial Imperative and guessed the right locker. Could be Whispers and a lucky guess. Could be a killer cheating, but there's plenty of ways that a killer is able to figure out your location if they're clever enough.
---
It only boosts my Spirit. &lt;3
---
procreate
---
+1 here
---
There's. Hag is awsome, i recommend her to you.
---
Spirit
---
But did you tunnel
---
I saw your flair and I just wanna say that I agree
---
They‚Äôre not wrong though
---
Playing a full match as killer youll struggle to get anything lower than a safety pip even if you lose badly. Most matches you pip and plenty you double pip.
---
It takes a while to get rank 1 based on playtime not so much skill
---
I *love* totem protector builds when I'm playing killer. Survivors get so distracted by their existence and forget that generators are the goal. On the flip side, if two survivors start a totem at once, then the whole thing starts to crumble down. It's a risk, but a far lower risk then just running one hex. 
---
As survivor, I hate seeing the build, but the best thing to do is to ignore the totems. Your teammates are probably going to be trying to get them, so you might as well try to get a couple gens done in the mean time. If you're in a SWF, coordinate with another to work on totems across the map from one another at the same moment, as that's the way the build breaks. 
---
Nice, claudette. Well done
---
The upcoming one definitely the new killer looks amazing and the map is super cool.
---
After that probably the nightmare on elm street chapter. Shame Freddy isn't that great.
---
*laughs in thrill of the hunt*
---
So I'm pretty new to playing survivor. I am working my way up with David King to get WGLF. Should I get DS or save up?
---
1. No FOV gains do not stack.
---
2. None here.
---
3. Freddy isn't getting a buff (or rather his promised rework) because reworking Legion is a far more pressing matter currently so they're focussing on them first.
---
4. Wraith is considered D tier because he has nothing to help him once he's found people. He doesn't have anything to shorten the chase or delay survivors. Every killer can 4K at high ranks if played well, but that doesn't mean that their killing potential is equal. (Very short explanation of the problem Wraith has)
---
I feel ashamed that I do
---
its funny cause in the original script freddy was a child rapist as well as a child murderer 
---
but they cut that from the final product and left it as subtext 
---
the remake apparently put it back in but i never saw the remake 
---
I play with friends. I‚Äôm pretty much maxed on every character but playing with them makes them makes the game so fun. I would never bother playing this game alone unless I‚Äôm doing killer 
---
Felt like the closest they'd come to writing is express their feelings with smiley faces  if I'm honest lmao
---
No counters in the chase is what I mean. If she had no counters at all she would be s tier.
---
Isn't only the Yellow Mori the one that allows to kill last survivor only? Last I remember (I don't use Mori or Add-ons) that Green Mori allows you to kill one survivor that has been hooked once at any time in the match once they are put into dying state again.
---
They crash before the match starts.
---
You did yourself a favor, don‚Äôt watch the remake. In the remake they straight up have scenes where the two main characters find photos of themselves as children ( assuming you know what about ) that Freddy took. 
---
But you are the asshole
---
Lol it‚Äôs okay, it looks good :)
---
If Killers wouldn't Kill me upon approach I'd just never loop Susie ~~not that I can ever loop a member of the Legion anyways~~
---
While I totally understand what you're saying (I've been there and it's beyond frustrating) calling them spiteful little cunts and exacting them to just blindly die for you probably wont help your cause. Dying on the hook is certainly a nice thing to do for that last player but do they have to do it? Absolutely not. 
---
Yes, what I mean by half is the actual appearance rate in the bloodweb. It is true the green allows a kill after hooking, but a majority of people will have a 5:1 yellow to green ratio or worse
---
It is unintentional I believe.
---
You can‚Äôt Mend while in T3 because you have to Snap Out Of It first.

1. You should be able to hear them. Check in settings, see if you can mess with the audio a bit. Even if you can't hear them, as you rank up, just think about what survivors do and follow scratch marks. For example, some survivors like to linger near pallets, so swing through them coming out of phase if you suspect someone is there. Sound is important for her, but you can work around it if you really want to. 
---
2. Prayer Beads is undoubtedly the best add on for her (in my opinion, because I always run grab builds with her, lol.) But, the duration and charge reduction ones are good as well. I'm not certain if there's any reapperance duration or reapperance speed add ons below purple, but try them out if there are, because they're quite good as well. Passive phasing add ons is really only good for mindgaming at pallets and windows, and rather useless overall. 
---
3. Distressing if you don't have prayer beads on. Monitor and Abuse if you have them. There's no point sneaking up on them if they're going to hear you coming in phase anyway. Neither is entirely necessary if you want to save that perk slot for something else though. 
---
I love it but now I can only focus on THE FOOT
---
Bs. Having counterplay is always gonna be more fun than having none
---
Hey man, I‚Äôm just the detective working the gens.  
---
DS needed changes, it was literally broken. Survivors have plenty of good perks as well lmao
---
Often add ons and perks are not considered for the killing potential of a killer.
---
Whilst those add ons help a good amount, it allows for other killers to also have their add ons considered. For instance Doctor could use two calm add ons and reduce his terror radius to 6 meters in punishment and almost global in treatment, making him a lot stronger.
---
1) I haven‚Äôt put the new killer on the tier list because I haven‚Äôt played the new killer, Hell shes not even been released. 
---
2) It is my tier list, if you don‚Äôt like me posting it, ignore it. This is r/deadbydaylight, not r/K_sper
---
I can post my tier list if I want. 
---
Calm down before you talk shit. 
---
Very enjoyable video. Extra points for syncing the music with the actions.
---
I like how you haven't mentioned Balance landing
---
ive heard nothing but bad things about the remake and since the first nightmare on elm street is my favorite movie of all time i have no intention of watching it. 
---
its why i skip the second movie whenever i want to rewatch the series. i appreciate that the second movie tried to do something different, and as im gay i do like the idea of freddy kind of representing suppressed homoerotic urges if film theorists are too be believed. 
---
but its just such a boring movie. there are things i dont like in the other films but at least they dont put me to sleep. 
---
Well done
---
They aren't wrong legion is worse than nurse
---
Dwight is thicc üëåüèª
---
As a fellow gay I also agree, the second is pretty painful to watch but the idea is pretty cool. It feels like it drags on for hours while watching it lmao 
---
Yeah, I've had that experience before as survivor. As killer, I always make sure to go after the person who sandbagged if I see it happening.
---
In other words, bad legions use strong add-ons and items, and good legions intentionally lose the game?
---
I think you have 2 different styles of vids going on here.  I hated the music choice, but thought the 2nd half was decent with your generated sound bites..  
---
Killer here- it isn‚Äôt toxic in itself. Like at all. Its the players that are already toxic and use it. Plenty of players are toxic and don‚Äôt run it
---
Definitely. I've never really considered it since I play on PC with headphones, but playing DBD (ESPECIALLY Killer) without more precise audio seems like a nightmare. I'll use tracking perks, sure, but sound plays such a big role for me in regards to cutting survivors off in chases, knowing when to double back, etc. Being able to hear grass rustling, breathing from lockers, the thud of footfalls on different kinds of surfaces. The amount of info you gain from having good sound is immense. 
---
Beautiful. 
---
When you hit a survivor as Trapper and they use their post-strike burst of speed to run directly into a trap. 
---
Big thumbs up for this!
---
&lt;rank 5 I actually always get to 3 stacks, and most games get 1-2 moris
---
I actually gave her the hatch but i was playing around for like a solid 2 minutes before i did. Didn‚Äôt want the vid to drag... same result either way. 
---
Freddy. But we all know how that ended T_T
---
‚ÄúTypical survivors‚Äù You say as you play your p3 spirit 
---
Wait it stacks with botany? That seems really strong
---
She dummy thicc sure, but she ugly
---
All bow down to the mighty Dwight boi
---
Dwight teaches kids to say fuck because he doesn't give a shit but feels guilty about it later and yells fuck at himself.
---
OOHHHHHHH FUCK! AS A KILLER MAIN I PLAY WITH NOED SO THAT I CAN KEEP TOXIC SURVIVORS HUMBLE, BUT LAST NIGHT I GOT A 4K GAME BEFORE THE EXIT GATES WERE OPEN AND A SURVIVOR BERATED ME FOR HAVING NOED. GET OVER YOURSELF BITCH TITTY.
---
Feng Min and Ace are like kindred spirits. They always seem to be together in these charts. 
---
Reminds me of my favorite troll build of Devour Hope rank 1 and Thrill of the Hunt. Savvy survivors think the two are Haunted Grounds and avoid it. Then, wham, mori out of nowhere lol
---
I'd suggest swapping out Rancor for Bitter Murmur, given that it's basically a better version of that, since you see everyone not just people who completed the gen plus you get an endgame mori. 
---
Yes! How DARE killers use moris whenever they want to. Shame them, SHAAAAAAAME! /s
---
What
---
Here's what I do and it's pretty fun:
---
\- A few days before the reset I stockpile the hardest dailies on killers I never play/level up
---
\- Play a few games while watching a stream or something
---
\- Get the 4 hatchets/lethal blinks/etc but just injure people, never down them
---
\- The survivors notice and help me complete the dailies. We all have fun.
---
In the end you learn a bit about a new killer or practice skillshots, and get a ton of BP while chilling.
---
it started when the first dlc chapter came out and people were saying nea looked more scary than the nurse, thus the meme was born 
---
Yup. But even when I realized, I finished it for achievement's sake lol
---
Haha baby survivor ggez
---
If you feel like you're getting tunneled all the time,get it.It will be waay more situational than it is now though.
---
Also after David I'd recommend leveling Meg or Claudette,for that sprint burst+adrenaline(maybe even quick&amp;quiet for some juking) for or self care.
---
Try to Sit on your hands for 5mins before playing a round...  
---
You can actually hit them at certain angles in my experience, you have to lunge at the right angles but its possible.
---
Most people assume that it‚Äôs going to let survivors continue gathering points/doing gens and escaping.
---
I think the moonwalking fits perfectly into the playstyle if you look at it like this:
---
Angry killer players use an angsty teen killer to deal out unfair gameplay against helpless survivors as a punishment for all the instablinds and teabagging they had to endure over the past.
---
For some type of players, this is *very* enticing.
---
Is there anything you'd recommend against survivors that *do* choose to heal rather than repair? And how do you deal with things like pallet and window loops, would you use Feral simply to pressure the one survivor or just let the loop run?
---
Yeah I LOVE the red forest map I‚Äôm so excited to get a new map for Red Forest
---
[How to record and share gameplay on the PlayStation 4](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-record-gameplay-on-a-ps4/)
---
I hate to say it, but Trapper's still weak. He is in need of some buffs to his base kit. Maybe an extra trap or two, higher movement speed when out of stock, you get the gist. His add-on reworks really helped, yes (as did Hag's), but I think that some of that needs to be integrated into his base kit. Hag got a really serious buff, so why shouldn't Trapper rise to meet her? 
---
I wouldn't say Hag is Nurse Tier, though. Nurse ignores the game, pretty much, but no matter how hard Hag pushes to prevent it, she still has to deal with pallets, vaults, and loops. 
---
Yes, he brought the most changing gameplay in-game (don't count nurse) with no really terror radius and add-ons to install someone.
---
I always try and stun a legion. Anything to get rid of that damn frenzy. 
---
MEG LOOTED THE BASEMENT CHEST BEFORE ME REEEEEEEE
---
It's not a connection issue, it happens when you play killer too trust me, you hit things that should DEFINITELY not hit even when you're hosting the server.
---
I was a Nea main until I changed to Tapp just recently. Can confirm.
---
Define weird, and the circumstances leading to this strange terror radius. 
---
I know leatherface is bad but it still hurts seeing my boy at the bottom
---
the 50% penalty and having to mess up to get awake are the only things he needs to apply pressue 
---
Monitor and abuse. 
---
Yeah no kidding. It sucks seeing Freddy at the bottom. I love him, but god I wish the devs would rework him. 
---
If you have the equipment to play the game, you have the equipment to record it.
---
IM NOT REALLY MAD BUT I THINK ITS FUNNY AND INSANELY STUPID WHEN SALTY SURVIVORS SAY KILLER IS EASY AFTER I DESTROY THEM. GENS GET DONE WAY TOO QUICKLY AND I DONT USE RUIN SO GET OUTTA HERE
---
Yep, that's why all big-brain killers swing at every window and pallet.
---
If they did some killers would have complete baby lunges.
---
They actually fixed it so that slower killers could lunge further.
---
If they implemented shorter hit boxes for killers with tiny weapons (freddy) etc., then you either wouldnt see that killer or b would have to give them faster longer lunges to compensate
---
And while you might think that's better just think about freddy lunging twice as fast when youre trying to jump over that pallet. It would also create gameplay inconsistency that people would complain about.
---
Can't make everyone happy.
---
Im criticizing your tier list right now. If you dont have any hot/unpopular takes and dont even bother to give a brief summary of your picks then how is it different from any other effortless shitpost in here?
---
Not to mention I can comment whatever I want just like you can post whatever you want.
---
&gt;if you dont like me posting it just ignore it
---
Well if you dont like me commenting that just ignore it
---
Like I said, I‚Äôm still tweaking it. In my last tier list Hag was below Billy, Spirit, and Huntress, but I changed that. 
---
Freddy
---
I don‚Äôt think a hard tunnel has counter play
---
Clown because clowns are scary
---
"why are two seperate departments doing stuff simultaneously?"
---
Pallet looping
---
yeah I'm really sick of being hit by pallets before even rounding a corner fully 
---
With how most people feel about Freddy, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fairly unique. 
---
YOU CAN LOOT ANY CHEST ON EARTH
---
BUT YOU CAN'T LOOT THE BASEMENT ONE. IF YOU TRY, I WILL FERAL FRENZY THE SHIT OUT OF YOU
---
Definitely not in my experience. Frame rate is consistent against her.
---
Freddy is one of the worst killer. Pretty unique
---
I'm pretty sure the actual game developers are working on new characters numb nuts, since they have entirely new game mechanics.
---
I personally believe she's below Myers, too. The variety to his playstyle and instadown in his base kit actually puts him above huntress in my book. 
---
With some of the shit people say and where they place him on their tier list, yeah it is.
---
Funny how people want rank 1 even though it rewards you with nothing
---
I REALLY HATE THAT PEOPLE THAT USE WGLF HAVE GIVEN THAT PERK SUCH A BAD REPUTATION AS A SANDBAG PERK, I JUST WANT MY BLOODPOINTS BUT I ALSO DONT WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M A PIECE OF SHIT FOR ACTIVELY BEING INVESTED IN SAVING THEM
---
It's probably an accident but I find the censored GG funny.
---
Bop bop
---
I've always stayed on the hook because I figured if the killer had to patrol the area, it'd give my teammate a chance to finish the last gen/heal/find the hatch (if it applies) in the meantime before I die. Oh well, TIL.
---
Gonna need more info than that.
---
Have you? This argument is pretty weak tbh. Of course I couldn't do what the devs can do but it's not me that's working in that field. Yes believe it or not when you're working in a profession people expect you to do good. Would you be okay if your surgeon completely fucked up your surgery because "SURGERY IS HARD TO DO". Yeah why did you choose to be a developer if you can code? 
---
Jane looks like the kind of person who would want to speak with the manager 
---
Straight up gnawing like a squirrel.
---
THOSE FUCKIN LAGG SWITCHES I HAATE YOU. KILLER NOT EVEN IN RANGE AND TWO SECONDS LATER I'M NEARLY DOWN
---
The perk says on it that it reveals auras for X seconds so I'm gonna fo ahead and say as intended.
---
Row Row Row your knife
---
Gently down their chest
---
TydeTyme had a similar thought. Myers can still be looped, which Hag deals with. She‚Äôs either A tier or S tier for me because her traps and the way she deals with pallets and windows. If you set up a trap on a thrown pallet and walk to the other side, the survivor is stuck. They can either vault and blow up the trap allowing you to teleport and hit them, or stand there and let you hit them, or abandon the loop entirely. It is amazing how 1 trap shut down an entire loop. She also deals with L and T wall loops very well by just placing a trap in the middle of it. 
---
Rancor as well, but only applies to 1 person.
---
What the fuck.
---
Nope. Xbox 1
---
can confirm
---
Brah if you get 20 down votes it's because a lot of people disagree with you. No one makes 20 account like that lol.
---
Seriously again, who hurt you to act like a toxic baby? 
---
^killer ^main ^btw
---
Yeah I‚Äôm done, I had a request for a killer version of this one. I won‚Äôt be fuckin up the reddit anymore lmao
---
I feel you on that bro 
---
HUNTRESS' BUG GOT FIXED WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS, MEANWHILE FREDDY'S BEEN HAVING TO DEAL WITH A SHIT TON OF BUGS AND SURVIVORS ABUSING HIW HIS POWER WORKS FOR THE PAST YEAR. AND BHVR OUT HERE INTRODUCING NEW KILLERS AND SURVIVORS AND BUFFING AND NERFING THEM ACCORDINGLY WHILE STILL LEAVING FREDDY IN THE DUST. COME ON. I'M FUCKING SICK AND TIRED OF WAITING FOR FREDDY TO GET SOME HELP. MY PATIENCE HAS RUN OUT.
---
2010 remake. It was originally supposed to be in the first movie as well, but Wes Craven (the writer and director of the first film) scrapped the idea.  
---
He's also not happy about the idea being brought into the remake, or at least he wasn't at the time. I don't know how he feels about it nowadays.
---
If it's full body control VR, killer could probably just destroy pallet before they get used or catch them mid-drop
---
Aight sounds good I'll try it when i get the chance
---
Is there a story behind that, or was it just an insult? 
---
It is, Infectious Fright is supposed to show their location akin to that of Iron Maiden.
---
Damn it feels got to be a pig/legion main now
---
I use Monitor and Abuse, Predator, Sloppy Butcher and Bloddhound.
---
I never use Evil within, so the terror radius es non-existent, as well as the Red stain.
---
Then scare the Legion out of them.
---
On the bright side, at least you didn't have to play an Amanda.
---
Monitor and abuse to make his terror radius basically non-existant for survivors. Gives him a higher stealth capability. 
---
BBQ is great for finding more survivors and gaining momentum 
---
Ruin is great at providing him time to stalk enough to gain tier 2. Without it, the survivors can race through gens while you try to reach tier 2. 
---
Bamboozle works well on him, especially during his tier 3 stage as he vaults windows faster. Can help end chases with him quicker. 
---
Nurses calling works well with M&amp;A as survivors will not hear your terror radius by the time you can see them healing. Allows you to attack vulnerable survivors. 
---
Any perk that helps with chases such as enduring, brutal strength or spirit fury to reduce the effects of pallets. 
---
Knockout and/or deer stalker can be useful for when you are in tier 3 as it allows you to insta down someone then leave them for someone else. Stops you wasting time on your tier 3.
---
Yeah this‚Äôll only get you a couple levels
---
What sucks even more is that Legion is getting his rework first. McLean said on his stream that they‚Äôre gonna talk about legion and their rework after the new chapter comes out. They want people to be focused on the chapter. So I guess we have to wait another few months before Freddy‚Äôs rework. 
---
How very not 5 dots of you to say so
---
Easy for you to say, you are a killer main you dont have to deal with legion. 
---
Honestly, forgot Rancor was a perk, thanks for mentioning it
---
probably just another bug, but i have no idea because i don‚Äôt actually know what you‚Äôre experiencing. was just guessing it might‚Äôve been the new plague perk
---
LAST NIGHT I SPAMMED NEXT TO THE KILLER IN 5 OUT OF 7 GAMES.  
---
BECAUSE OF THIS, (AND ALSO BECAUSE IM NEW AND IM BAD) I WAS HIT WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE AND ALSO FIRST ONE TO BE HOOKED.
---
I WAS UNHOOKED IN FRONT THE OF THE KILLER SEVERAL TIMES  AND GOT TUNNELED ALL 3 MINUTES I WAS IN THOSE GAMES.
---
I WENT FROM RANK 11 TO RANK 13 BECAUSE AFTER THAT I WAS TILTED AND JUST PLAYED EVEN WORSE. (NOT THAT I CARE BUT THOUGHT I'D BITCH ANYWAY  BECAUSE WHY NOT)
---
Maybe I'm too picky, but I'm having a hard time playing solo on any rank
---
No. I was solo.
---
Oh, there's a story alright. I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/pBKEa3R1ru0) to catch up on it.
---
Wouldn't Bill try to smoke it?
---
THE GAME PROGRESSES WAY TO FAST FOR KILLERS WITHOUT RUIN
---
I‚Äôve always been rank one.. well except during reset when I get thrown to 10... as a killer main all the try survivor try hards are there.. and suspiciously disappear by rank one
---
it is meant to show a bubble just like doctor screams, but they messed it up
---
Saw definitely!
---
Imagine playing dead by daylight without expecting someone to leave as soon as the game doesnt go that well for them
---
Happy cake day.
---
Also, yeah, it‚Äôs broken. Sat in queue for a few minutes then get into a game like that.
---
**Pretty Good Job So Far.**
---
Base nurse has the ability to completely ignore everything survivors have against killers (pallets, windows etc.). Her power is punishing if you mess up but considering it can close a chase super fast in a reliable way if you're good at the killer she becomes top tier
---
It is quite strong botany has always been a really strong perk. The 33% reduction of use on med kits and 33% faster healing speed makes medkits last 66% longer. Great for people who don't have self-care.
---
My feng ming at top so happy
---
I think he was joking about how mathieu brandon the director said you should just play civ6 when someone complained about dbd not being fun.
---
Here comes the Crimson Chin 
---
Lass? 
---
Personally, as a killer main (been steering away from Wraith lately and more towards Legion/Pig), just go around a corner and have better map knowledge. As survivor I often run around a corner and simply crouch next to the edge sometimes, then just sit in my little corner. Use perks to limit the noise and run marks you make because personally I rely on these to track. Outsmarting the killer, even by using darker colored cosmetic items can help you blend into the map and "vanish."
---
tfw when someone uses an image from a porno and doesn't give a link
---
As a survivor,hag is like a classic horror movie,everyone is crouching around doing jackshit and there‚Äôs jump scares every 15 seconds
---
&gt;You have to be 32 meters away from the hook...
---
Most of the time people aren't leave a locker next to you, infact assuming that is what makes Iron Maiden weak. 
---
&gt;...AND it can only be applied to one person at a time.
---
The buff I proposed also would only effect one person at a time too.
---
&gt;60 seconds for an instadown for just hiding in a locker?
---
People don't hide in lockers as much as you think. Maybe 60 seconds is too much but 15 or 29 seconds is way to little. I honestly feel like this part the buff would need to be tested.
---
&gt;And it reveals your location?
---
When you unhook a Survivor the loud noise created from it is pretty much the same thing.
---
Hey! MW here. Wow, there are so many killers in DBD right now.
---
I tried to draw all of killers and it took me around 3 weeks. 
---

---
Fuck legion and fuck all these toxic little kids playing that shit. Shit has no counter play and you spend half the match holding down m1. Bring on the downvotes killer mains. 
---
Wraith and nurse are good at taking care of kidsüòò
---
nah mate its legit. 
---
but you don't need to play it to "autism" levels for rank 1? you play like one to two games a day and thats about it. As survivor you just can't loose a pib, just make sure to not be the first one to be found to minimze the risk of getting facecamped to death and thats it - you allready got a black pip - do a littlte bit more aaaand one pib
---
There‚Äôs clearly things that are waaaaay more important that need to be improved first
---
Next time, hit F12 for screenshot
---
My guess... goes straight to post match chat. *shrug*
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so happy you liked my art. I love the Huntress and the Pig dance too, they‚Äôre so cool and sexy!
---
*Laughs in Legion* you right tho, some extra BP would be nice.
---
As someone who regularly gets rank 1 on both sides, I find rank 8ish survivors to be way less potato than red rank ones. All the urban immersion Neas and Claudettes flood red ranks. 
---
I would want a rin dancing outfit
---
They still have the same tips from when the game was first released lol
---
I‚Äôd recommend Meg over Claudette, you don‚Äôt need self care if you just bring a medkit which are extremely common in the bloodweb. 
---
It rewards you with a steam achievement. That‚Äôs all I want from it. Then to never go back
---
What if it was reverse psychology cuz they wanted to play against Legion
---
This is so great! I especially love Philip and Sally.
---
DS has been there a few times, not that much but it‚Äôs been there. As far as I know, BBQ has only been there once. 
---
I had a similar SWF join my lobby a month ago but instead of legion it was "Leatherface=DC" and "LF=Fuck you killer". I switched to LF immediately and I laughed my ass off as I chainsawed each survivor and watched as they instantly disconnect before I get to pick them up.
---
Seriously, do SWF's think insulting the killer before the game won't lead to karma biting their ass?
---
good killers will literally just wait until you use it; the only thing its good for is gaining some extra distance to get to a pallet
---
I THINK DELIVERANCE IS KIND OF A DUMB PERK I CAN SEE THE ADVANTAGE BUT IF I WALK AWAY AND YOU UNHOOK YOURSELF IM GONNA COME RIGHT BACK
---
About that, I used that perk with ace in the hole and got a instaheal medkit. 
---
66% added on to the 24 charges makes it have 40 charges which would provide 2.5 heals. Emergency med kit has 25% decrease charge consumption so you gain 3 full heals with 4 charges left over.
---
At least I believe that to be the case.
---
The tremendously means you heal other survivors 35% faster so its even more efficient. Combined with botany you are healing a survivor almost as fast as we will make it.
---
Yeah like anybody can rank up when a Top-tier nurse gets a 4k before a single gen in done
---
Right, but I find that placing a trap in the middle of a chase is an easy way to throw it. 
---
"Elitist" "fucktard" "it"s a shame to see an eating disorder do this to a person." 
---
Just in case you forgot what you said.
---
i‚Äôd recommend watching space coconut on youtube if you wanna learn how to play her! he does a series called Hagvice where he reviews hag games that are sent to him and also posts a lot of gameplay/discussion stuff as well. He also plays spirit sometimes. One of my favorite killer youtubers ‚ï∞(*¬¥Ô∏∂`*)‚ïØ
---
My heart! Ow, fuck! Too cute, Too cute! *c muere* 
---
I WISH THEY WOULD JUST PORT THE CODE CHANGE THAT MAKES THE LOAD SCREENS NOT SUCK ASS ON PTB TO LIVE. I SWEAR I'VE HAD BARELY ANY CRASHES ON PTB, BUT ON LIVE I STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS DUMB SHIT EVERY FEW GAMES AHHHHHH
---
I‚Äôm saying you need to dump basically all of your bloodpoints into him then and you still won‚Äôt have it every game. You don‚Äôt see spirits running prayer beads every game, you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúonly use FMT‚Äù if he‚Äôs meant to be a main lmao
---
Oh shiiiiiit
---
Thank you! Aw they‚Äôre such a sweet couple, I love Phillip and Sally ship!
---
YES!!!
---
People who don‚Äôt look behind them when running. People not doubling back during mindgames and in general not timing their pallets correctly. 
---
Honestly as Wraith, run Enduring and Spirit Fury And just disrespect every pallet cause either they drop it and you get the break or they don‚Äôt drop and you get the swing. And once SF is up, just go ham. 
---
Hahaha Thank you, my friend!
---
They're a company. They have priorities. Sometimes a smaller group can be better because everyone is flowing in the same direction and collaborating. Working in a big company myself, I see a lot of disconnects. One of our teams was building software B that would work with software A to do XYZ. But as they were nearing completion, they found out that the team that runs Software A is actually sun setting that tool and is creating Software C, so software B became obsolete before it even got released.
---
Shit happens. Voice your concerns to them. Send bug reports as often as possible. Use the feedback options built into the game. They cant do anything if they dont have the reports coming in!
---

I've been away from the community and haven't kept up. What's going on with the ranking system in the next patch?
---
Okay but did ardetha ever put forward any evidence at all to backup his claims? I hate ochiso as well, but those accusations really just felt like empty words to me. 
---
I'm looking forward to be proven wrong 
---
NOW THE REAL TERROR COMES TO LIFE
---
The low-rank lobbies slowly though get better as you progress through the month. Eventually, reset to normal standards after a week maybe with everyone back to their respective ranks. It allows lower rank players though to experience high-rank plays and can learn from it. Also gives them incentive to get better at the game if they have a challenging experience with the killer.
---
As opposed to just wasting points once you've got all the killers and survivors to level 50 with max perks?
---
I absolutely love this. The Fedora on Daddy Myers is an especially nice touch 
---
NOPE, definitely NOPE!
---
That's true Legion is an amazing way to maintain a high ranking in the game. Wonder if it still works though with the PTB rank system.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but Craven died in 2015. 
---
Listen: most of the gameplay against a good Legion involves running behind an object and holding down a button. 
---
Turns out this isn‚Äôt a very fun button simulator.
---
IF YOU DONT FARM THEM YOU WONT HAVE THAT REP
---
I especially don't like the "Facing the ____" because you *know* that not only causes DCs but can Ruin a Killer's element of surprise. 
---
Glad all my mains teach little kids, probably how you know they‚Äôre the toxic ones
---
They need to make a queer character.
---
That's why you need a good manager who can communicate between the teams and coordinate them. But you can't say what I just said wasn't true. Unless of course you didn't bother to actually read the whole thing.

With how fast you can place traps now, it isn‚Äôt that much of an issue. Besides, you can place traps before you start a chase so it doesn‚Äôt matter too much. 
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
It happens when you would reach level 100. You are then Devotion 1 lv 1. You gain nothing for it, sadly, 
---
It was said in a live stream, I'll do some digging to see if I can find a link for you
---
In order for the killer to follow you as soon as you get unhooked they need to know where you're going. They can know that one of two ways: Someone unhooks you in front of the killer (So they see immediately where you go and follow you) or you don't escape after being unhooked in a skillful enough way. You led the killer to your hiding spot. Sometimes just running away isn't enough, you leave scratch marks. Sometimes you have to walk away, crouch in a good hiding spot, find a locker etc. etc. It's not the killer's fault that they are playing the game trying to win, they have the right to try. You are a weaker target compared to your team mate so why wouldn't/shouldn't they try to target you?
---
That's only 220 hours as survivor. It's a drastically different play style. Think of the famous really good survivor they have like 4000 hours. Plus theres been lots of changes recently that kinda go against survivors who are just starting out. So it's pretty easy to get wrecked when you first start.
---
I DON‚ÄôT CARE HOW MANY DOWN VOTES THIS GETS! FUCK THE LEGION AND THE SCUMBAGS WHO PLAY THEM ON PS4! YOU ALL CAMP OR DC WHEN YOU GET YOUR ASS HANDED TO YOU! DO US ALL A FAVOR AND PLAY A REAL KILLER OR UNINSTALL THE GAME! HAD A RANK 4 PUSSY DC LAST NIGHT AFTER THE FACE CAMP AND HAD HIS NOED BROKEN PLUS HAD ALL THE GOOD ADD ONS AND MAX PERKS! THAT IS ALL...
---
It just takes a while. Killer mains play with a killer mindset and mess up because of it. It takes getting used to if you want to understand the survivor mindset more and do well.
---
 I have a irl friend who mains killer and sucks ass with survivor too, but he comes to me for advice since I know a survivors mindset. Just keep at at and ask around, I‚Äôm sure you will get better decently quick once you play more games as survivor. And again, anything I can tell you to help just let me or anyone else know!
---
 I play killer as well to better improve my understanding of how a killer will play so I can adjust my survivor play based on that. 
---
Trapper x Doc! Wraith and nurse! Am I in heaven?üò≠ Thanks OP, your artwork makes my day!
---
Tip from an avid Freddy player, range addons&gt;blocks. I personally think with smart playing and juggling everyone into the dream world, Freddy is better than leatherface, especially with addons taken into account. Class photo wrecks people.
---
The facing tips are actually rank based. I believe it only displays for rank 20 to 10. You do not get those tips at the higher ranks.
---
STOP BEING DICKHEADS IN THE BASEMENT OR AROUND THE KILLER IN GENERAL. THEY WILL NOT GO EASY ON THE REMAINING SURVIVORS.
---
ALSO PLEASE STOP SUICIDING ON THE HOOK WHEN IM NEARBY, FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
There is plenty of proof regarding the witch hunts; he was temporarily banned from DBD as a result of his toxicity and harassment, although unfortunately Twitch weren't as willing to ban him for the same reason, despite there being video evidence on his own VODs.  
---
As for the sexual harassment part, as far as I know there isn't concrete evidence, at least not from what has surfaced so far, but there are plenty of witnesses (one of whom used to be a close friend of OchiDO's) and victims.  
---
It is certainly true that he is an incredibly thirsty man, but the rest should be taken with a grain of salt until or unless solid evidence shows up.  
---
I for one am willing to believe it's all true, because in my opinion everything about him screams shady, but I cannot be certain without proof, of course.
---
It's interesting to see the skill check loading tip. The skill check for gens looks massive, especially the great skill check size makes you realised how much the game has changed.
---
He was literally spinning in the basement
---
Aww thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you liked my DBD art üòÑ!!
---
Thats some big brain plays right there
---
March 19th

Makes for more fun games, it‚Äôs not always fun to dick on people getting a 4K all the time, sometimes you need to run into a survivor who fucking loops you til your ankles break.  Before you mention rank doesn‚Äôt always net how skilled they are, it definitely groups them tighter than it would be random. From 7-1 I run into some crazy good players and sometimes at 1 you find a potato who doesn‚Äôt deserve to be there.
---
I REALLY HATE THAT KILLERS CAN HIT YOU AFTER YOU VAULT OVER A WINDOW. THE POINT OF VAULTING IS TO BUY YOURSELF SOME TIME IN A CHASE, NOT TO END THE CHASE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE GAME IS BROKEN. 
---
Nea wanted dead or alive
---
To block pallets and windows during a chase. You block areas you herd the survivors to and when they try to vault or slam a pallet they get boned. If Hag as Body Blocking Traps, she can‚Äôt teleport to them at all. So if she traps the hatch up and doesn‚Äôt get there in the time it takes the trap to dissolve (3-4 seconds) then you‚Äôre home free. 
---
The best part of this fan art ;)
---
Well if there's no evidence it's a pretty scummy thing to spread around. You can be the biggest asshole in the world, that doesn't mean you should be suspected for pedophilia.
---
Lol bro the only time I can play survivor reliably on PS4 is after they've reset my ranks.  Otherwise I'm stairing down 8 minute plus solo queues.  I basically have to play killer constantly once I get anywhere near rank 1 survivor.
---
If you're on PC, steam sales usually have all DLCs on sale except for the newest one. Not sure about console.
---
No, even though the obsession is clearly being chased and their icon just showed them getting hit, David is going to sprint to the furthest corner of the map to heal so the killer can spot them with BBQ.
---
Its like that  dude in Troll 2
---
When other survivors won't leave so you can get the hatch. I've got a trap on my head, and you're in the gates? Leave. You're on your way out because the killer is still chasing me in the middle of the map? Leave. I'm downed and they aren't running deerstalker but you're just teabagging in the exit? Leave!
---
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?!?!
---
sure
---
Ruin, decisive strike, Adrenaline, and all the exhaustion perks have all been on the shrine multiple times. BBQ is the only anomaly
---
Pretty disappointed it wasn‚Äôt LF and Pig
---
Is there any strategy involved in bringing No Mither along outside of getting the Adept David achievement?
---
Thank you so much! It would be cool if all killers can have that hat üé© in the game. Hehe Nea poster is my favorite part of this art ;)
---
Thats a bitchin build thanks friend!
---
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME WHY IM SO HYPED FOR THIS DLC!
---
THAT AND DISTRESSING BUFF!!
---
Who'd you get there with?
---
Depends on the build. If I have a build that allows me to pretect my totems, I will use TOTH (silent spirit, mint rag hag, speedy billy, speedy wraith, long blink nurse, snipe shock doc, auto trap trapper and maybe something else I missed) if I don't have a build like that, I will often still select the perk and hope survivors don't run into it
---
Do you sell these as stickers? I would love to buy some!!!
---
come on, legion should be where pig is
---
YOU ARE RIGHT BUT IT REALLY EFFECTS SOME OF THE KILLERS LIKE CLOWN AND TRAPPER AND THAT SADDENS ME
---
Oh I've been playing killer for a while now i just was wondering what was good for Myers and i like this idea as well thanks!
---
Idk why but when people use the killers actual names it makes me sad... I know its lore but its still sad
---
Np, just wanted to point it out.
---
well it stays up longer than ruin thats for sure
---
Stealth will only get you so far. You need to learn to run a killer, and take advantage of a killers split attention (like with doctor, rush gens while he chases someone).
---
You can stealth doctor, you've just got to pay attention to your madness tiers - you only scream when going up a tier, or getting hit by shock.
---
How in the name of god does one accumulate 26K shards? That's like almost 3 free new characters
---
Maybe he's the killer?
---
BuT bUt SeLf-cArE iS a GoOd PeRK. Imagine not using it /s
---
Zzzzz I just dont understand the principle for rank reset when you get absolutely rewarded in no way. It's stupid. If you want the rank to reflect skill then just work on that, and do a rank reset once that happens.
---
I don't consider freddy useless or unplayable, just very boring and weak comparatively to nearly every other killer, which is why I want him reworked.
---
Every killer can 4K, depending on the survivors they go against, and even a billy won't get a 4K every game because competent survivors can still steamroll through generators, so it's not entirely Freddy's fault. It's just that on average, he will perform worse than other killers under the exact same circumstances
---
I like killers where you use the power consistently, rather than once and then play M1 for the rest of the chase. That's mostly how leatherface ends up too because his chainsaw will only work in open stretches, which is why he's also considered weak, despite having a down. The simplicity and ease of use for his power however not only makes him effective at low ranks, but also very strong at low ranks. Freddy getting a free hit on someone that most likely won't waste much time before taking a second hit works similarly. But the better survivors get, the more they'll abuse the lack of a killer power
---
&gt; but at least they dont put me to sleep.
---
I bet you think you're *pretty* clever, don't'chya?
---
yeah but iron maiden isn‚Äôt bad. it counters the main counter to BBQ.
---
"haha ez game, git gud scrub, pls uninstall"
---
Glad to be of help, my man.
---
Hope to one see you in a match one day, looting my chests :p
---
I don't know why, but I would assume Hag to be further towards the "yells at people who teach children fuck" corner. Maybe I'm just stupid ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I don‚Äôt know why but they could be best friends in my head!
---
Think it this way. McDonalds is having an intense marketing problem. Why the hell would they get cashiers and cooks to help? That‚Äôs not how a company works. Look up a tutorial of animation. Now look one up of lighting. These are very different things and shouldn‚Äôt be compared. Someone that counts #‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know how to market nor does concept artist know how to program hitboxes. Also, I think you are throwing too much shade at the devs. They work on other games and they were programming the hitboxes for Plague‚Äôs vomit.
---
I actually like it more in the PTB, and will probably start using it as my 4th slot after the update goes live. Feels way less scummy against fair killers, and punishing tunnelers/campers with it never felt so good (for me).
---
Only reason why they aren‚Äôt is bc Susie yells at them for doing it
---
I agree but I'm not sure there's a good solution for this. On the bright side these games are few and far between, and it probably doesn't need to be addressed.
---
If you're worried about de-pipping you can do totems and stand in front of the afk killer for chase points. Then all you lose out on is altruism points.
---
I think you mean we‚Äôll make it not wglf
---
I'm at 8 as survivor right now and I love it. Much better than people around 10-12 who barely have a fucking clue. Hiding in lockers and not doing gens. Self healing all match like wtf
---
Are you actually talking about gen tapping in 2019 jfc
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I mean, pretty sure there's multiple claimants? The whole thing was that Ochido gets his fans to harass people, I doubt they want who they are to be revealed.
---
I mean they both are murders and do suggestive things in their meantime.
---
Found this out the hard way. It was a dirty climb to get there too :/ I used Morris and add ons and noed from like rank 4+
---
LOOOOOL
---
NOED isn't found until it's too late.  They are pretty much always in position to crutch out a down with it when gens first pop as they're either chasing someone already at that point or they simply smack one down at the door they're attempting to open.  Unfortunately solo queue randos don't help cleanse totems.  Took out 4 myself again yesterday still to eat NOED from the Billy I destroyed all game that couldn't get one successful down on me lol.  If weak players are going to continue running the crutch and the answer is always just do totems then all I want is a reliable method to take them out in solo queue as swf already have a totem counter every game it's called a mic lol.  They're addressing the biggest survivor crutch currently with the decisive rework so a totem counter would be the lightest balance they could add for NOED without removing any effects these types of players require to down a survivor.
---
Wait, this hint Just appears If you play against that killer for the First time, right?
---
Aw even they are not together in this fan art but I‚Äôm pretty LF will love the Pig always
---
That's the problem.
---
The Exposed only lasting 15 seconds means that if you're 40 meters away than by the time you reach the Survivor, the Exposed is already gone.
---
What is that red shirt, left corner?
---
well then wouldn't they be in the same spot on the other side? besides, i feel like it would be more joey, frank, and julie talking to the kid and susie kind of giggling at it watching. either way, i think they should at least be above doc lmao
---
I remember the first time I managed to 360 a killer. Good times... (it was like a week ago)
---
I hate this idea that because i have a problem with blatantly op and unfun aspects of killer that means i just play survivor
---
Yea I had a match as survivor the other day. I'm at 8, had one at like 7, 11, and 2. The 2 was the only one to die and they didnt get tunneled. Lmao granted they had no perks or anything either.
---
He has no real Counterplay and many, many Legions Moonwalk so Survivors are forced to bleed out in a Chase. The no Counterplay thing is something that's meh to complain about because people could've tried to hide from him but the Moonwalk thing is a legit problem.
---
That being said the People in this Pictures are actual Crybabies who either are extremely stupid for thinking that won't make People play Legion OR are extremely smart if they want people to play Legion against him.
---
That's not how it works. Faster healing just spends the medkit faster. 16 charges of a medkit are needed to fully heal, doesn't matter if you have healing speed addons or sloppy butcher applied. You will spend 16 charges
---
With botany it takes 11 charges ti heal fully
---
Never got caught, obviously
---
but it means they can‚Äôt hide from bbq, which was a very strong perk before (and even still after) the locker buff. the exposed status isn‚Äôt exactly the main use of the perk, it‚Äôs just another nice side use.
---
That's not quite true, as You can see [here](https://github.com/jesterret/DBDPakTrack/blob/master/DeadByDaylight/Content/Data/BloodwebData/BloodwebPrestigeModifiers.uasset), higher prestige increases chances for better items by 10% per level.  
---
Unless they broke it, and it's not applied, that is... But other than that, it very much is affecting Your chances for better items.
---
2 months? you talk the most shit going
---
Save yourself. Red ranks are full of noed, defensive strike, insta heals, and rage. Save your innocence.
---
IS IT REALLY? I ACTUALLY DIDN‚ÄôT KNOW THAT, THANK YOU. I WILL STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT NOW.
---
I'm not sure if it was just the angle but David seems a bit taller than Freddy and about the same height as Legion
---
Hmmm ok I will try if I can!
---
Ok, cuz I got legion up to 40 when he first came out and I never quite understood what all the hate was about cuz I never knew about the moonwalking stuff
---
Kk
---
That's the thing, I believe it is ment to be the main part of the perk. The search speed bonus (in my opinion) is extra since the Exposed is next to useless on most Killers.
---
The only reward you get is it makes gaining shards slightly easier for the first few levels after devotion.
---
Dont let the thicc fool you, Jane has an odd torso. According to proportional analysis, her belly button is too high and her crotch is too low. Blue is where things should be, and red is where they are. Did the entity stretch her?
---
the classic russian claudette
---
Sir you must be lost, anyone playing a killer that a person doesn‚Äôt like, is a typical killer implying it‚Äôs easy and op to that person. Which spirit apparently is??? Hello???? Didn‚Äôt you read his post???? /s
---
Claudettes do this all the time. If I'm playing survivor I run we'll make it, med kit and botany I can basically heal you in the killers radius stop running!!
---
Well, as you just showed us, there are way more dumb people in the world.
---
Yeah the music needs to be Signs of the Swarm - Cesspool of Ignorance.
---
The people that say "gg" only when they win.
---
I can't lie, I get mad when I lose sometimes- but never to the point of flaming anyone. When I'm doing SWF, I'll talk shit about the randos or the killer to my friends, but never to the actual other people.
---
It's either "gg" or instant click "Upgrade" for me.
---
You may get downvoted, but you‚Äôre not wrong...
---
Idk man. I consider myself a really good hag, and at rank 4, I have games where I cant seem to get a fucking hook. They'll have 4 gens done and all I've been able to do is get a single hit on everyone a couple of times because they just know how to find the pallets, and to run AWAY from gens and team mates... My point though, is paying killer is a joke until you hit red ranks where people actually try. Seems like everyone has elite game sense. Then it kind of stops being fun because of all the try hards and you feel forced to run noed and other op perks.  
---
As for survivor, yes I think its harder. Sometimes you get tunneled and sometimes your team cant seem to do a fucking gen. I've had games where I'm solo completing my 3rd gen and not one other has been done... everyone is just laser focused on unhooking eachother. Ugh, hate those games. The cherry is when they all get on the last gen and leave me on the hook, noed activates, they ditch me. And I get 0 pip for doing 4 gems and not u hooking or healing.
---
This is beautiful.
---
I had a similar thing. I tried getting in Dark Souls because I heard it was hard. Boy was it harder than I thought but I prevailed through the game until a certain boss. More like bosses because there was 2 of them. Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt get past these guys for a full 2 weeks so I threw in the towel and asked for a strategy and help. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a bunch of ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù or ‚ÄúI beat them X times with Y bad item‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt ask for a change to the whole encounter, just wanted to know how I can improve. After see all that I instantly got turned off from the game and never touched it since.
---
Unless the survivors are toxic I use NOED to show my dominance then carry them to the exit.
---
Agreed. Pig and Amanda FTW!
---
Already told you that doing 5 totems as a solo player isn't happening because you spend too much time looking, and thus give the killer more time than even ruin might, hence making it a too strong perk, and thus the idea that you can counter the perk by essentially making it a 3v1 for 5 minutes is an absurd notion
---
Also, your argument that having a totem counter would make SWF easier is just absurd. A SWF can say 'I did a totem' and you can simply keep count. It's not hard to do. I've managed to deny noed THROUGH A STREAM(I was playing with them, but not communicating, and had around 15 seconds of delay), and all they had to do was tell each other that they had cleansed 4 of the 5 totems amongst one another for me to find and cleanse the last one. Such barebones 'communication' allowed me to deny noed. There's no way a group of SWF cannot easily tell one another that they've cleansed X totems, leaving X totems behind, meaning a counter would in literally no way help them. You know who it'd help, exclusively? Solo players
---
&gt;The only reason to add a counter would be to counter NOED, 
---
Yes, because people say 'Just cleanse totems', because then you can COUNTER it, which is the SOLE argument any noed user stands on. 'It has a counter'. Not a viable one for solo players. And if you tell me that it shouldn't have a legitimate counter, but one which is so unrealiable as a solo player that it may as well not exist, then you're also basically acknowledging that currently, the reason it survives is because a lot of players are solo, and thus we don't really have a proper counter to it
---
Give us information enough to actually deal with a dumb perk, or stop saying that it has a counter. It's one or the other
---
Go to bed, Quentin.
---
Halloween
---
And this new plague one has my hype full throttle 
---
She just looks fun
---
I feel like they don't have to be connected. They just have to be connected with the chapter's theme.
---
Clown and Kate- Both performers. One used it as a disguise for his collection, the other wanted to see smiles on peoples faces.
---
Spirit and Adam- Both suffered losses in the family. And you can argue the train derailment was connected to Rin's father getting fired.
---
Legion and Jeff- Apart from the obvious fact that they actually met, they hide something inside them that they mask from the outside. Legion masks the darkness inside by acting friendly. Jeff hides his friendly nature with a tough persona.
---
Plague and Jane- Gonna go out on a limb here and say they both gathered a following that led to their demise. Hence "Demise of the Faithful"
---
ITS WEIRD TO BE POSITIVE IN ALL CAPS BUT YEAH I USE IT FOR WHEN MY TEAMMATES DECIDE TO LEAVE ME TO DIE
---
Oof, that spicy meme!
---
Thirded.
---
Yeah but sadly at high rank, even with TotH, if more than 1 survivor knows where your totems are, they get broken as soon as you go to start hooking someone lol. So you either have to slug (not a bad idea necessarily) or something just to protect totem. Hopefully that won't be so true with the new totem changes that are on PTB I haven't really seen anything on that yet
---
Can we become friends lol
---
This is nice! 
---
If I can offer any advice, I would recommend starting out by breaking down the overall form into simpler shapes to build up a "skeleton" for the sketch (ex. The head is essentially a circle and a rounded triangle for the jaw). This will help with proportions and depth later on :)
---
Awesome work so far, keep it up and good luck! :D
---
Over a short time, BP generation favors killer.  Over time, it favors survivor.  In my opinion.  So farming is far kinder to Survivors than killers.  That being said, it may still be better for a killer to "waste" time farming in an already established match vs just trying to barrel on to the next one. 
---
  
---
Survivors can build up more BPs without needing the killer to be right there, whereas 90% of a killer's BP will only be made interacting directly with a survivor. 
---
Killer will probably hit the cap on a category before any Survivors do, but other than that, they're likely increasing more categories minute to minute than killer is.  
---
If we take farming out of the equation, then killer is making more BP in a single match, but Survivors will be generating quite a bit more per hour playing.
---
I cant even count the games I get one kill because a good runner just keeps tea bagging and setting off every trap (hag main) I place. Like fuck you. You cant go do a gen? You have to set off my tral just to teabag me and make me chase you? That's the only time I will face camp is if that's the only kill I'm able to get.
---
There's always Civ V
---
Have you looked at the other survivors? Their proportions are way off too. But who cares? Let's just all enjoy the game.
---
POSITIVITY IN CAPS IS JUST POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT ALSO IT SUCKS TO HEAR PEOPLE LEAVE YOU BEHIND
---
Why don't players adapt to legion play? I get that moonwalking is a big issue however using stealth and staying away from other survivors counters legion.
---
I think this really has just become a meme started by a popular streamer so players haven't even tried to adapt.
---
Wait until The Plague comes - again its totally different strategy then what we are used to.
---
What's wrong with self heal?
---
I wasn't going off I was genuinely asking since its the map I get the least.
---
I ended up getting downvoted pretty hard when I posted on here about the player base because I was heavily considering on picking up the game. The people who commented were extremely nice, but seeing my post downvoted to the ground... that deterred me a little lol

    Not calling this post out just saying that the community needs to stop bitching about Legion for 3 seconds.
---
Because he‚Äôs not a chasing killer- not all of them play the same, if you chase you‚Äôre at a slight disadvantage, he‚Äôs a stalk and hit boy, obviously you can get a whack if you can but if you stay looped that‚Äôs you just playing poorly.  His reappearing got buffed that it‚Äôs almost a guaranteed hit if you block exit routes properly. Can‚Äôt approach a chase like other killers would. I mean unless you have the speed addon... then chase and body block fools cause that shit is borderline op.
---
You wont get to use it unless you basically get farmed off hook,

No Mither Resilience and hope you are not the one getting caught first, just Gen Rush as soon as the game starts. Works against sluggin, as long as you are not the first one, and killers wants 4K so bad. Some other gimmicks but it is mostly hard mode.
---
Will try that out, thanks!
---
The point that ‚Äúit becomes a hassle to cleanse totems if you‚Äôre playing solo‚Äù is a really cheap way out of it. You are not forced to play solo, you are queuing up, no one is doing it for you. And by that you should no that playing solo is a lot harder than SWF, you cannot communicate as well about things like who/where the killer is, what perks/add-ons they have. So by queuing up alone you are deliberately making the game harder for yourself, how can you then sit and complain about NOED, if there is a simple solution, play SWF. And if you say ‚ÄúBut I have no one to play with‚Äù you are wrong. You can just join the DBD discord and always have people to play with.

Max you can earn is 32k. On average you'll only earn about 20K per match(Some go by too fast, some are just bad games, some you'll earn more, but overall, 20K is reasonable, for a killer. For a survivor, it's usually less). And to level 35, you'll probably be closer to a million bloodpoints, so we're talking probably 40-50 games. Not to say that's inherently that bad, because you're just playing the game as you otherwise would anyways. The real kick in the nards is that the killer ain't free, and a lot of people literally cannot, or just simply might not want to buy a killer
---
How do you do good with freddy? Blood warden and noed? Cuz that's literally the only way I lose to him....
---
So, spinning in his grave then?
---
ring ring
---
Since no one asked, who is the girl?
---
PS4 version is a garbage in terms of performance that's undeniable truth. So when killers on PC complain about survivors being too OP, I laugh in my 20 FPS and 4K as myopic Huntress
---
It would if it was hard to pip, but as it stands, until the new chapter comes out it just isn't hard enough to pip.
---
Love all of these. Absolutely wonderful work. I love Bubba and Lisa the most, just something about your interpretation of them is amazing.
---
Meg is definitely a lesbian.
---
He‚Äôs boring. I don‚Äôt think his power merits that he‚Äôs just a lesser wraith. SHRUG.
---
They have to reset rank because of their matchmaking system but I agree it needs tweaking a bit. They have totally eff'd killer ranking on the PTB - so hey at least they are working on it.
---
FUCK COORDINATED SWF THAT GENRUSH ME! WHENEVER I  SEE 4 GENS POP ALL AT THE SAME TIME I JUST WANNA UNPLUG MY PC! ALSO FUCK INFINTE LOADING SCREEN THAT HAPPEN WHENEVER I USE A RARE OFFERING OR PERK!
---
Looks like a costume for a Guardians of the Galaxy musical lmao
---
I for one want the offering screen to stay on longer. I'm still not familiar with all the offerings and like to hover over each one reading about them.
---
Idk y‚Äôall acting like it‚Äôs a dead perk in my mind they will kill 2 rocks with one stone
---
-not everyone will be able to use dstrike 
---
-and it will stop the killers from camping and tunneling (or give the survivor an extra chance to escape)
---
This will make the killers happy bc not every Claudette and meg have ds 
---
And the survivors should be happy cause if they tunnel u ‚Äúhey look a knife‚Äù and the killer is stunned for 4 secs.
---
And tbh this one change will turn the game upside down for killers cause now they can‚Äôt just tunnel one survivor at the beginning at of the game and if they do they gonna get gen rushed to hell
---
I believe the game has the lowest survivor survival rate. It might have changed though. The devs had graphs showing each maps survival percentage on one of their streams a while back.
---
Yeah, with many of the builds I go for a 3 totem strategy. They don't need to survive, in fact, I expect them to get destroyed, but being able to hold them up for 2 minutes after the survivors found them already gives you a huge adventage
---
BUT HOOD MAN BAD
---
Im sitting on a fat stack of 1 mil bp waiting for miss thicc :P
---
Thank you, my friend! I‚Äôm really happy you liked my art!
---
Did you literally just copy paste your last post, even though I provided points to why this was a completely ridiculous suggestion to make? And you got caught up in the idea that a proper counter is somehow a nerf to noed, even though the ground noed users stand on is 'It has a counter'? Come on bruh, try harder
---
You only get this the first 2-3 times you face a killer. So if im new and i play against a wraith 2 or 3 times itll tell me.
---
In my head canon Meg is gay and crushing on Huntress.
---
I also muse that Adam is as well. 
---
And well we all KNEW wraith was but then BHVR screwed that up with his romance with nurse.
---
It‚Äôs survivor queues that are trash. Killer queues are almost instant games.

I think Nea is very much loved, and unban evasion is probably her most signature perk :)

Fourth perk usually depends on my rank. I was using devour hope up until about rank 5, but you could do ruin, noed (if you're trying to get rank 1, otherwise no need to ruin everyone's fun) bbq if you have it...

Iron Maiden provides auras. It's supposed to show their location a la Madness, and Rancor.
---
Those only really come out near the end of the season when all the shit killers have managed to get to Rank 1 purely through playtime. Rank 1 on the first half of a season is usually pretty nice and has some killers that are fun to be in chases with.
---
You should really keep that kind of info to yourself.
---
Lobby wait times are a few minutes for killer on PC still. Longer than survivors but not too long. At least at like 18-20 anyway cause I am a trash killer and never get past that with how little I play killer.

It was decent!

Its 4 people but I like to think that Frank went nuts, killed them all, and now he has DID and they are all just him ala Norman in psycho.
---
Definitely check him out, he helped me a lot when i started playing hag. His videos are comprehensive and very helpful!
---
I hope you enjoy!
---
Oh shit, thanks for the insight on third seal. Gonna use that tonight. I always thought that perk was kind of useless. Like. I thought it just negated perks like bond and empathy.
---
Ever since noed got buffed, I've seen one every other game(Or more. Never less though), even on killers like nurse and billy. They suck absolute ballsack through the game, even at rank 5(I haven't played survivor enough to get to rank 1 in a long time, and getting to rank 1 as a solo player, when you get camped, tunneled or chased for a century so you can't pip, it becomes a chore), then the noed comes into play and the killer gets at least 1 pity kill. I'm so sick of how prevalent this perk is, because it gives killers a potential pip or black pip they 100% did not deserve
---
At first, I thought it was "That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen" , but it's not.
---
Those tips only show up the first time you play against that specific killer.
---
BBQ has been on before,but like a long time ago
---
Sorry bud but ending a game faster is not good for points. I think its stupid when a killer ends a game in 2 minutes. Winning does not equal points. Maxing out your categories does. You want that 32k
---
Bringing baby legion to a whole new level.
---
Yea I never understood why that wasn't part of the loading screen
---
I have a feeling you didn't read the whole guide
---
Would all the content be good though? I mean loads of content is fun, but if for every nice killer we get 5 Legion type killers I would like a pass
---
People don't hate freddy, actually personally I find him one of the most fun killers to play and I'd rather play him than most killers it's just that sadly he's terrible. Perhaps his rework will make people want to play him more
---
no problem!
---
I know how to run a killer what I am saying is that because I like o juke a killer in the terror radius the doctor is not the best for this. 
---
I do not think the doctor is a strong killer my point is that for my play style of running about, liking chases and slipping away during them he is one of the best counters.
---
Yikes 2 DCs, a slug and a hook.
---
HEY HEY HEY! They have feelings too!
---
Yeah with exhaustion, flashlight, pallet/windows nerfs and killer speeds buffs I don't even know what people are talking about, survivors are super EZ if they play at least a bit suboptimal.
---
I'm playing with mouse on PS4, but it's sensitivity desires to be better so I don't shot long range hatchets like at all, mosty pallet/window baits
---
1 - The only real way to rank up slower is to let survivors escape and do the bare minimum to black pip I.E not gain or lose any rank. To do this you need to avoid hooking but still play efficiently enough to make up for it by downing people constantly and winning chases. Its really hard to rank up slowly as with killer you usually either rank up with getting a really good game or derank as you lost the game and all survivors escaped. I would still play normally as you will find that ranking up as killer is alot harder compared to survivors. Even when you think you did quite well, the game may just black pip you. 
---
2 - Piping is the process of being rewarded a point that progresses you to the next rank. When you play a game you can either depip, black pip, single pip or double pip. 
---
Each rank requires a certain amount of pips to progress to the next rank. If you do bad in a game then it will "Depip" you where it will remove a pip from your account. This more or less regresses your progress through the rank. If you "black pip" it means you neither gain nor lose progress towards your next rank. If you gain a "pip" you make progress towards the next rank. 
---
For example. To progress from rank 8 to rank 7, you need to earn 5 "pips" from the games you have played. If you "depip" and you have progressed 3 pips into rank 8, you will now have 2 pips and have will now have to earn more to reach rank 7.
---
try infinites and lt walls, u dont always need a pallet
---
In eyes of most legal systems in the developed world, anyone under 18 is a child, and someone over 18 trying to get it on with someone under 18 is considered a paedophile.  
---
There are of course a multitude of factors that go into this kind of thing, and it is not nearly as black and white as my gross oversimplification makes it out to be.  
---
The actual medical (and psychological) bit is a little different, though, with paedophilia (attraction to prepubescent children) and ephebophilia (attraction to adolescents) being two different things, albeit usually trees of the same root, meaning they normally stem from the same mental health issues.  
---
Personally, I definitely suspect him of these allegations (again, he absolutely beams shady vibes), but would not make outright accusations against him and pretend it's 100% true without evidence. All I'm saying is I have seen his behavioural pattern before, namely in Heavy the Squid (if you don't know who he is, grab some popcorn), and I would not at all be surprised if OchiDO's tale has the same end.
---
Huh?
---
fuk u
---
Yes it is, you finish a game and can go play another one, you should average around 25-50k per game and end games faster than if you try to farm. It doesn't matter how much 1 game grants, it's about how much you get per hour.
---
Those are the only killers I prefer not to use add ons with.
---
STOP HEALING IN THE CORNER OF THE MAP ITS A UNSAFE PLACE TO HEAL, GO HEAL BY A PALLET OR WINDOW
---
I have nothing wrong with it. I just never knew The Clown‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúKenneth‚Äù lol
---
It doesn‚Äôt take 60 DAYS to get 9k shards, you‚Äôre lying
---
Also maxing out objective is pretty hard to do with out prove thyself. I don't know why I keep replying to you when I know you are incorrect but I just want to make sure I'm not the one who's wrong here lol
---
I hear ya. My standard set up is M&amp;A, Ruin, blood warden, and NOED. It gives you a nice mix of end game should you fuck up during the early/mid game. But also delays the beginning so you can potentially get like 1-2 sacrifices before gens are done. 
---
If i have my perfect addons set up I usually just run Z block/unicorn block. Brings the dream transition down from 7 seconds to 3.5 which helps significantly. But i don't always have z block available so in that case I'd say unicorn block + nancy's masterpiece/sketch.
---
That Claudette and meg skin omg üòçüòç
---
For what purpose though? Some attempt to be edgy with the remake? I'm sure Craven scrapped it for a good reason
---
Plot twist: David is using No Mither. Chasing him with a medkit is therefore completely useless.
---
I'm not gonna read a pointless guide.
---
Yeah I mistakenly wrote least favorite killer when I meant objectively worst killer.
---
No I'm not... I don't play all too often, so I saved up the shards I collected for two months. Is it that farfetched?
---
Oh ditto. Ill completely ignore someone if they do that
---
I can agree with that. But on PS4, if you're a survivor it's best to max out to the best of your ability every game because you never know if you're going to find another game lmao
---
I ALSO DID NOT KNOW THAT. HECK YEAH. I‚ÄôLL BE SURE TO DO THAT NOW.
---
Are you a chick?
---
OMG i feel like the dumbest idiot alive,i never thought about not claiming my rituals so i can hold more than 1M BP
---
There was leaked audio of him telling an underage girl to do inappropriate things.
---
Sounds too me yes, if you care about the game that much to post this accomplishment on Reddit then you more than likely play it fairly often
---
&gt;playing surv to farm BP in the first place
---
AWESOME
---
There is a new PTB buff interestingly enough that makes distressing provide 100% bonus to bp gain, same as BBQ. So your guide will become even stronger when the plague gets released.
---
This is gorgeous! I love your art style!
---
THANK YOU
---
SWF IS A BLATANT BALANCE ISSUE AGAINST KILLERS BUT THAT ONE IS JUST ON YOU
---
Welcome to the Rice Fields..(Grind). Good luck cya in tha Fog
---
All it takes is one good runner lol.
---
I liked the remake :(
---
Freddy is so disturbing in it
---
It was a Pig &amp; she gave me the hatch so I couldn't even be mad lol
---
Yeap
---
I'm gay and use it ironically but I would NEVER haha I just do shit like camp / tunnel = gay
---
uwu ‚ù§
---
It was an accomplishment for me because of how long it took me, plus it's the first character I have purchased by only playing the game.
---
The perks will still work the same way. If the obsession changes then the perk will ignore the previous obsession and have its effect reapplied to the new obsession. 
---
STBFL will allow you to regain tokens again if the obsession changes
---
PWYF will work the same with new obsession were chasing them will increase your movement speed.
---
When it's literally every single one, that's obvious horseshit. Just stop lying
---
I'm like 100% sure Legion was supposed to be a killer that disguises as survivors, I mean come on! "Darkness Among Us?" They vault windows like survivor's, and they even walk like survivor's! That would've been fun to play but all we got was Feral Frenzy..
---
That's been a problem for a while. Basically you have to 360 out of the exit to get over there
---
The are different varieties of music in the previous montages :)
---
It didn‚Äôt take you long playing the actual game, it took you long because you don‚Äôt have time to play. It didn‚Äôt take you 2 months
---
There's actually a lot of builds that make freddy super strong. Like the end game build(noed+bw+remember me)
---
Thank you for your insightful input on the matter
---
nice selling point lol but no sale today
---
True, that would be really dope.
---
I'd like for them to add something to the lore about this. The lore has everything else. Maybe, the entity reshapes people like it does with the environments, to add to the unsettling nature. Imagine having to adapt to a slightly different body in this dire situation.
---
Probably... this is not official.
---
range addons are basically blocks but they can get the job done better
---
Can't be, everyone knows Tyler1 is 6ft, this guy is only 5ft
---
Same here
---
I WANT THE NIGHTMARE DLC, BUT FREDDY WILL NEVER GET REWORKED, HE'S A LICENSED KILLER SO DEVS MAKE LESS $$$$$ ON HIM, THEY TAKE CARE OF HOMEGROWN KILLERS FIRST. (it does make business sense but it SUX 4 us)
---
Fifthed?
---
^is ^this ^legal?
---
My favorite is when people get downvoted in the "no stupid questions" weekly thread
---
Didnt know wraith had a huge stall and wallhacks outisde of his terror radius. Wack
---
Don‚Äôt know why you are being downvoted for speaking the truth. When I first started playing I didn‚Äôt even know how to break pallets, I got bullied so hard by higher rank survivors that had all 4 perks and flashlights and honestly it made me quit after like 3 games and uninstall. Then the saw dlc came out and I started to play (because saw is one of my fav series) again and since I‚Äôve put 500 hours in the game.
---
Play on PC
---
Ah OK, I run a BP build on survivor so I avg 30-40K a game. You  get a lot of BP very quick with this.
---
Yea I'm at 5 now. You're right it's not too hard once you really get to know the maps and get better game sense
---
Boil Over and dead zone tactics. Funny as hell:) A whole new level of planning
---
You should totally play as legion
---
Hag looking T H I C C
---
She took it upon herself to become high priestess after  dedicating her life to the temple and the other priests died. I‚Äôll let you take a gander where she lie‚Äôs on the chart.
---
O&amp;S is basically the breaking moment for most people.
---
I just love hav so much but nurse might be my next killer to rank up
---
Well when you got one on the hook and another being chased there really is no point to self heal. Get the hook save and heal eachother.
---
Guess I wasn‚Äôt good enough then. I‚Äôll have to go back and give them a shot again
---
YOU'RE WELCOME
---
YES, WELCOME INDEED. DBD WILL EAT YOUR SOUL, AND THEN SPIT IT OUT IN FRONT OF A TUNNELING KILLER OR A FARMING SURVIVOR. GL
---
Lol just run killer around and make sure they down you in a corner?
---
WHEN YOU GET DOWNED, PLEASE FUCKING MOVE AWAY FROM THE PERSON WHO GOT HOOKED, I CAN'T FUCKING HEAL YOU WHEN THE KILLER IS THERE, AND THE KILLER ISN'T GOING TO FUCKING MOVE AWAY WHEN YOU ARE DOWNED NEXT TO A HOOKED SURVIVOR!
---
Clearly dudette/dude.
---
If, being forced to chase more than other killers, how do you maintain map pressure when you're forced to tunnel a survivor for a single down, and potential have to repeat this when they get unhooked?
---
I've always had a thing for big dangerous men with masks on ;) in my fantasies. dont get that shit near me irl
---
I would, but I don't have a desk so my ability to play killer is quite hindered. Also playing on controller on PC is a death sentence.
---
It still gets pretty choppy on Ps4 pro on certain maps and killers...there really isn't a solution...unless the devs are telling the truth about the new patch
---
This sub has made me appreciate the LoL community. I used to think they were toxic, then I played DbD.
---
this gives me an idea of a meme that i may or may not make and put here!
---
Nancy's not in the entity's realm... üëÄ
---
WHY THE FUCK WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR RUIN STAYS FOR THE WHOLE MUCH, BUT WHEN I PLAY KILLER IT'S GONE IN 2 FUCKING MINUTES?! SERIOUSLY WHY?!
---
No it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre just sensitive
---
8 minutes? Boy have I news for you. I've had 30 minute to hour waits more than I'd like to admit.
---
My suggestion as killer (Actually this is my build).
---
I play with The Wraith because of 0% terror radius when cloacked: 
---
- Distressing 
---
- BBQ
---
- Hex No Escape
---
- Ruin 
---
All matches I get around 80k pb, if you use bp offerings you get more bp, even if you kill one or nobody you will get at least 50-60k very easy with this build.
---
In gameplay you probably aren't gonna notice the off proportions, and it could definitely be worse but.
---
That's not how bodies work.
---
Self care is probably the most common perk I see players with and it's pretty annoying because a lot of the ones who use it dont seem to understand just how loud healing is and end up getting caught
---
Can't really blame them.
---
Frank and Julie is awesome lol
---
its a joke lmfao. calm
---
No, thank you for sharing! It made my day. &lt;3
---
This. He‚Äôs weak in most scenarios where you have a SWF Group of at least 2-3 people. The issue comes in playing with randoms who will either give up, or just not try all game and wait for their death.
---
That‚Äôs all Legion is though. Just annoying as hell to face against and it‚Äôs not even fun. 
---
Sit on a Gen, get stabbed despite running past 2 windows and jumping a Pallet. Get stabbed again. Break line of sight while his Terror Radius is JUUUUST at the edge. Then when you start to mend with no time left, **surprise!** You get M1‚Äôd and downed.

Oh okay, it‚Äôs 2019 , you can‚Äôt really tell these days lol
---
My friend has been trying to get out of green rank hell for the longest time. I hate to say this but he isn't very good at the game. We play the game together a lot and yet he can never seem to get to single digit ranks. So if you ask me it does take a good amount of skill to rank up against competent killers.
---
Huntress &amp; Pig are my guilty pleasure ship ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ also the Doctor lookin thicc üëÄ
---
a Girl you can take home
---
Yeah, I'm very confused by this sub sometimes. I bought the game and got up to rank 1 solo survivor in like 2 weeks. Its suuuuper easy to pip, you don't even have to do that well to get a pip in games. 
---
Also, everyones talking about NOED at rank 1, which I pretty much never see. Only Ruin and BBQ are guaranteed, most good killers ditch noed for more useful perks.
---
It's a Gang of Four people, but you only play as one? Not sure where the others are, guess they're just vandalizing stuff while waiting for Frank to come back with the one weapon all four of them share, apparently.
---
I think it found be cooler if it was just a pack of delinquents chasing survivors around.
---
With some michael jackson vibes
---
The HeadPiece and face/eyes look really good! My only criticism is the face needs to be slimmer and ‚Äútaller‚Äù? And the mouth needs to be proportional, but otherwise this is great! I‚Äôd definitely color it.
---
I'd rather run ds now than before
---
Wait you have to buy the hag..?
---
On PC, yup!
---
They‚Äôre such a cool couple!
---
You‚Äôre actually more gay for using legion than you are from being actually gay.
---
It's not always a lagswitch. It could be, but let's not rule out the very real possibility of it just being someone with a straight dogshit internet connection.
---
I started playing around the same time as you. I wish I would have found this game sooner so I could have been hyped for the Saw chapter. I think the Pig is such a cool killer
---
Oh wow, that‚Äôs crazy haha
---
Needs more Linkin Park and TOOL
---
Bless you. I feel the same and sometimes it gets hard to have fun when people are just trying to ruin it for you for no reason
---
Ur so cool gg keep going plz
---
I want to know what made this interview catastrophic. 
---
How the hell can you be dead middle between ‚ÄúYells at people who teach little kids to say fuck‚Äù and ‚Äújust watches the shit go down‚Äù?
---
10st
---
Thanks.
---
yeah man if you check out the PTB patch notes, distressing getting a sexy 100% bp bonus. It's really nice. With doctor, though the synergy of BBQ and distressing will be amazing with him as distressing is what you need with him.
---
MAN chin
---
I also have a million. What I do is go down to 800,000 BP and build myself back up. It's easy and it a great way to stay in check.
---
Right, your tame opinion. Blame others for your own lack of kindness and you over sharing your unwanted opinion. This post from OP was supposed to be a positive one, but obviously people here don‚Äôt appreciate that. 
---
Yeah, old flashlights pissed me off to the point where I had to take a long hiatus from the Game because they were SO fucking meta.
---
PTSD Flashbacks to trying to pick up ANYONE as Leatherface and immediately dropping them because the Claudette pointed a flashlight at my earlobe. 
---
They‚Äôre so sweet
---
Ninthed
---
I know I just want the steam achievement lol
---
Really like this, thanks for posting!
---
The devs really need to buff perks that no one uses. Would add some very nice variety to the game and open up so many new build combinations.
---
Thank you! They‚Äôre my favorite ship too!
---
I do that too :D highfive ;)
---
Aww thank you, my friend‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I don't dodge flashlights, those are usually the survivors trailing you waiting for the pickup instead of working gens, but I'll usually dodge if there's more than two toolboxes. Gens pop too quickly. /shrug
---
like wow dude go check those Gens 
---
I‚Äôm so happy you liked my art! Thank you!
---
My boy Tapp perfectly balanced.
---
&gt; quite literally robs survivors of their items a "Try-hard" perk.
---
just pick it back up bby survivor git gud
---
3 for me too. I feel like once 3 people are stuck in the basement, the last one is not going to even try and save them. It‚Äôs a death sentence.
---
Lol
---
Source?
---
Dude this happened to me, Im just going for the achievement and I was 1 pip away from rank 2.
---
In what way is me wanting others to be healthy in order to live longer and possibly more fulfilling lives unkind? I‚Äôm rather curious to hear this. 
---
My comment isn‚Äôt particularly negative, you just took it that way seemingly because my opinion differs from your own. 
---
But I‚Äôm the unkind one, right. 
---
Have a nice day, no need to continue this. 
---
I think, this is the game, if you are not happy with the game try to request changes in dbd official forum or, it is sad but try to find other game to play. Unfortunately the game won't make everybody happy, I agree that is boring to see everytime same killers and their perks but thats what we have...
---
This is my opinion.
---
I actually want to verse this, just to see what its like lol

I honestly never saw the point of adding that.
---
NOED is bad on nurse because you can 100% prevent NOED from ever activating if you play nurse, IMO
---
I‚Äôd like to see daily Trials/Challenges/Community Challenges that change up the game a bit more than just ‚ÄúChase a Survivor for 3 minutes.‚Äù
---
Maybe like, ‚ÄúUse _____ perk and gain 100% more Bloodpoints in your next match.‚Äù Or winning a game only using Grey Addons will get a Bloodpoint jackpot.
---
The problem with DBD is that the meta eventually gets drilled into every player, and if you want to do well, you NEED to use ____ and _______. 
---
It sucks but the game eventually does get boring when you see the same 4 Killers using the same meta Perks. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a Wraith/Hag/Trapper/Hillbilly in over a month, and I play pretty often.

Lmao I basically mean it‚Äôs just a game of find them and M1 them, and you‚Äôre basically a ghost. Freddy has the better invis obviously, but I personally find wraith to just be better at the pace of the game, Freddy is just slow for slowness sake. :( 
---
I know this might be a weird concept but..
---
Totem spawns in the tiles are static just cleanse them.
---
90% of games I'm in

NOT IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE ANIMATION ANYMORE. THAT SHIT IS NOT INTENDED.

This ain‚Äôt it, chief.

That's the one. Thank you.

oof

I LOVE RANK RESET. TUNNELING BITCHES AND POTATOE TEAMMATES.

and it's EXACTLY what it sounds like.
---
Huntress A tier? This must be a pc post. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure I get it either...
---
Those 5000 points add up. Could have probably p3'd a whole character by now based on how many times I've been fucked over by Noed.
---
My favourite is Clown n Freddy, they're both my mains so I'm happy to see them together. What are the odds there's a version that exists that I could use as a phone background?
---
Yeah I was almost turned off by it. I started last October, and coordinate SWF groups just being toxic assholes is hard to take game after game - especially when you are new to the game and they deranked and you don‚Äôt even know how to play the game yet
---
Y'know, usually I'm one of those people that says "just cleanse totems." (as thats what I do and it works like a charm) but I suppose this is true too. You can usually tell when a killer is gonna have NOED based on how quickly the game is going. The amount of times I've said, "yeah, he's gonna have NOED" based on how easy it was to beat them early game, and then I've been correct about it when looking at the perks after game, is amazing.
---
THAT IS TOTALLY UNTRUE. STOP MAKING STUFF UP
---
Oh yeah, you‚Äôll get over that soon enough. Hell, you might learn the maps and tiles before you even get Windows of Opportunity in a bloodweb. Anyway, that issue gets much better with time
---
It doesn't. It also doesn't work with huntress lullaby. The benefit of it being when you pull survivors in the dream world it drops your radius down to 16 (when in the dream world survivors auras are revealed to you when outside of your terror radius). So they can't really run too far from you. 
---
This is his actual face behind the mask. The devs really go all out on killer details 
---
No sarcasm here but what are some well optimized alternatives? So far I've just seen Last Year but it only has 3 killers which seems lame.
---
IF IT IS TRUE, THAT IS A VERY RECENT CHANGE I AM UNAWARE OF, SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD LINK THE APPROPRIATE PATCH NOTES
---
The billionth "noed/ds is a crutch perk and your grandmother is a whore if you use it" post this week.
---
Yes it is, despite me being a console player. It‚Äôs largely based off other people‚Äôs tier lists, mostly Bricky, but I also put some of my thought into it. That‚Äôs why Hag is higher than billy. 
---
This will occupy me for the next 100 years thanks
---
4 DS and 4 Adrenaline does not make good players lmao
---
Trapper serving My Bloody Valentine REALNESS
---
Just ignore him? People do shit like this for a reaction. Responding only gives him that reactions that he wants. Just block the dude and move on. 
---
Yeah the mask is nice but the rest of the outfit doesn‚Äôt fit and seems pretty low effort...
---
Just did and thanks yeah they mostly just do it for a reaction but I don‚Äôt play much so doesn‚Äôt really bother me much
---
Just say gg back and block...
---
Thank you, my friend! 
---
All I got from this thread is that Ochido is the AliA of dbd 
---
Yes, still brings up the main point: if a survivor sees you coming, you really can't do match...unless you have add-ons, giving them less (or even no) time to react. It really is the add-ons that make Wraith so divisive. Freddy, with add-ons, is better. Leatherface, with add-ons, is better. Trapper becomes lower mid-tier with the right add-ons. But Wraith really, *really* needs add-ons to be properly playable. Of course, the further down the ranks you go, this statement is obviously made moot...
---
Yeah, but I didn't give that information sinse I tought it was too obvious, I was just talking about non-licenced characters
---
Where is it from though
---
Job well done friend, also loving this doctor ship lol
---
Good reply! You are the real winner for not participating in the bs toxic cycle.
---
I don't doubt she is A tier, it's just harder on console. I play both and honestly I had to stop playing her on console. Switching between the two was too awful. Same with nurse but not as drastic. Nurse is definitely top tier even on console as long as the player can play her well. 
---

I hope that backpack gives you one point of back armor...

I hate toxic people so I never promote it back üëçüèΩ. 
---
Ya, sure! You can use as a background. There are each killers pictures in my blog. https://art-by-mw.tumblr.com/post/183427293947/all-killers-shall-we-dance
---
Yeah, I'd rather have my team mates gen tap than keep missing skill checks repeatedly. Even in red ranks there are people who can't get great skill checks. Besides, there isn't any rules saying someone can't do it.
---
Well then
---
Fellowsurvie main here! Just trying to offer some friendly advise, CLEANSE TOTEMS!! Dont think your teammates are? Then do it yourself. It's part of your objectives anyway. There are literally 5. you can probably sprint burst around the map and cleanse all 5 in the time it takes to do 1 gen.
---
No totems, no NOED. its literal laziness on your part.
---
Well given the Grecian theme she does kinda look like a gorgon (which she actually has a different skin for) but it does look nice.
---
Hard agree. Guess we can mix his business suit with the mask. 
---
As a counter, yes healing is loud, but self care feels like basically an essential perk to run if you‚Äôre playing solo. You cannot always depend on your teammates to heal you and finding one is difficult at times, especially when you‚Äôre injured and don‚Äôt want to wander around and have the killer find you. The number of times I haven‚Äôt needed self care doesn‚Äôt measure up to the times I haven‚Äôt run it and wished I had. That being said if your teammate is following you to heal it‚Äôs dumb to ignore them and self care lol.
---
Trapper‚Äôs Bloody Valentine skin is pretty ballsy.
---
Thing is, wraith is still just a teenager if I remember correctly^^
---
I go wherever the Hag goes, the cult of the Hag never rests. Praise be the hag.
---
***Prestige 4 clown***
---
I find Hag to be amazing on console for the same reasons she‚Äôs good on PC, but also she can‚Äôt be 360‚Äôd. Since you‚Äôre using analog sticks, it‚Äôs easier to 360, but if you trigger a Hag trap it will always face you directly, so when you teleport you can just hit them without being 360‚Äôd. 
---
WOW! GREEN connection? 
---
1. Place traps in unexpected places/use Mint Rag
---
2. Top tier Killers can reliably 4k as FREDDY. Huntress and Nurse have objective disadvantages and are harder to play than most Killers, but Nurse's power is off-the-scale.
---
3. You can drop traps in 2 seconds. That means you can do it mid-chase. Try actually *playing* her.

Yeah it might be nice to give him a noble beast variant. He‚Äôd look good with an Abe Lincoln or I‚Äôm sure steampunkers would love a steam version.

Did they just turn my fucking Ace into a hipster?
---
Damn, he can get it üçÜ
---
Oh I was taking about huntress. I do agree hag is bae though, she's one of my favs. Especially since haunted ground came out lol. 5 totem build with her is absolute chaos for survivors 
---
Netflix adaptation?
---
Careful what you say about killers, this subreddit is basically all dbd pc killer mains. 
---
Jane and Plague also share the familial abandonment.
---
Honestly, Nea's the only original survivor with a very direct story connection to their associated killer. She's the only one that directly interacted with the killer's home turf, the rest just sort of disappear in the woods. They've pretty much always just been conceptually related characters.
---
Herman thicc 
---
You‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs what I do as both survivor and killer. But because the ranking system is as bad as it is, a lot of potatoes are at rank 1.
---
Ah shit my bad, I confused you with another guy. 
---
Yes, she‚Äôs harder on console. With how hard it is to hit hatchets because of the low sensitivity and the previously mentioned 360‚Äôs she‚Äôs not that great on console. Hopefully when dedicated servers come out and console gets optimized she‚Äôll a little bit better. 
---
Hitboxes are a different discussion entirely haha.
---
I'm definitely saving up some shards for that trapper and doctor skin! HOT DAMN!
---
When I play survivor I never do totems. Of course only once have I had to deal with NOED, wasn't salty after. 
---
Herman's asscheeks is my favorite of them all &lt;3
---
That's a good point actually. Or he could just get the knife and show dominance 
---
*Swallow noise*
---
Nurse and wraith are so fitting, wraith does come off as sophisticated somehow. 
---
I got the strangest woody... 
---
I put him as horrible at first but then I thought he's the only one among all 16 survivors that I'd put in an adult day care (like a husband day care) lol
---
Never seen a killer do it. 
---
Sorry about that! ~~Not really~~
---
MY THICC DOCTOR 
---
Oh no, a looper what ever shall I do? Could I equip one of the many dedicated perks? Nah *facecamp*
---
why are there no comments 
---
You're just bad lmao. I escape vs legion more than any other killer. There's plenty of counterplay but the biggest part being, just like nurse, you cant allow them to be too close to you.
---

You mean raise his alrdy hand-held knife and raising the Halloween theme bg music lol. Would be more work is kids pee themselves also lmao
---
You have called every single killer either unfun or OP. Stop playingdumb
---
I know this on an emotional level
---
"Hey Louis, I think there's a puppy in there. You should go and pet it."
---
Wiggle DS is the strongest DS because the killer doesnt know about it
---
They‚Äôre perfect couple!
---
Maybe it just seems like there are more of them because they complain all the time üòÇ
---
hag is a parent? did i miss this lol?
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense lol you did a good job even getting 3 dead 
---
he‚Äôs not one of us

They've evolved, now its 6 seconds fedora man bad

I literally ghost wrote this, i too am a nea main who gen jockeys runs bt doesn‚Äôt t bag, cleanses totems and also are runs prove thyself üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
What the fuck is this??
---
Yeah, Claudette‚Äôs, p3s, legacies, flashlights, medkits, none of that scares me. But 4 toolboxes is just asking for a whole lot of trouble.
---
Considering every other post on this sub is survivor crying, I doubt it
---
Exactly but in his deformed brain he thought if 1 person escapes the survivors win
---
Now 4th dimension it.
---
Nea main: I‚Äôll stay silent 
---
I think Susie has gone at least a little bit psycho but probably is a Chaotic Neutral or Chaotic Good. Still doesn‚Äôt vouch for swearing kids probably
---
Yeah I remember this. It was 750 shards on the old system. I played the most I have ever played and got to rank 1 on killer from it. Still didn't manage to get enough to buy it and it has never been on the shrine since.
---
Rank in this game is a joke. Bad killers will get matched with good survivors and the killers won't know how to counter loopers. Then they get salty and just facecamp because they want to punish the looper for... doing their job as a survivor.
---
IT DOES REQUIRE PRETTY SPECIFIC POSITIONING THOUGH, ALONG A SPECIFIC EDGE OF THE HOLE IIRC.
---
Oh god being a non main on here is annoying. 
---
4 of the last 8 posts are survivors crying.
---
All of these are pretty awesome. The best ones are the Trapper and Meg skin IMO.
---
"Speak up, Francis! Your voice got all muffled from your head bein' so far up your ass!" 
---
Tenthed
---
It can be countered. I think it it‚Äôs a great perk from both perspectives. Can help a killer bridge a gap in a bad game or spice things up for a survivor. 
---
tiktok legend !
---
Play alot.
---
For Survivor I use WGLF, Prove Thyself, Self Care (it gives survival points which is a hard category to max), We'll Make It (if I'm already unhooking, I can get a fast heal). I also bring in a green medkit with extra charges to speed up the self care. For Killer I use BBQ, Distressing, Beast of Prey, Bitter Murmur. Distressing and Beast help max out the categories faster and Bitter Murmur just helps find survivors faster to get more chases and hooks.
---
Nea is best for anything 
---
Doctor x Trapper is the OTP I didn't know I wanted but I needed.
---
COOTCH AHEHEHE
---
I died laughing when I saw Freddy. This is a perfect tier-list.
---
When you hop in a locker instead of vaulting *harmonic song plays*
---
I think the people who make these posts don‚Äôt really participate in this sub, for example OP has 1 comment in this sub
---
Ehh I like that Meg jacket but the backpack will make it harder to hite.
---
one trap at the hook is enough. survivors don't see what you see. when someone gets unhooked often the rescuer crouches away while the injured survivor runs away leaving scratch marks. so you only find that survivor that got unhooked. of course you hit him. everything else would just be stupid. it is not your fault. it is the survivors fault that did the rescue. yes, he got his buddy off the hook but little did he do to actually save him.
---
when you play hag it is common that you get called camper, because you trap the hook. well, just don't trigger that trap next time.
---
people that complain are usually just salty because something didn't go their way. the louder they scream the more salty they are. in the end just try to ignore it and don't get into an argument with someone on the internet.
---
against the hag a lot of survivors get salty when they loose because someone on the internet told them that hag is just D tier ;)
---
That's a weird looking Legion cosmetic
---
Nea twins! *\*high fives in Nea\**
---
I love you so much
---
*urban evades across the map with you* 
---
Yeah I forgot, sorry fam
---
I love the way you paired up The Legion. Of course you had to have Micheal with a fedora haha.
---
Its amazing how you don't be negative but voice an opinion and the reddit users down vote the shit out of you and you are -19 karma just like that.
---
She‚Äôs bipolar 
---
I'm rank 20 and I've been sitting in killer queue ~10 minutes now. Just started playing on PC after playing PS4 for a few months. The PC version is so much better but why are queue times so bad? I never have to wait more than 30 seconds on PS4.
---
1. Yes.
---
1.2 Snowball is not the same as stall.
---
1. how can one man be so wrong. Spirit is the second best killer in the game. She has Freddy's power but it is actually good. Freddy is the worst.
---
2.  I agree it helps freddy, but i was pointing out the fact he isn't invisible. Pig Tree without pallet is still good, magic school bus, torment creek silo, coal tower, the nightmare that is the grim pantry houses. And every other killer can deal with pallets just as well or better than freddy. I don't know what you don't understand about that.
---
8.2 Spirit is near impossible to dodge if you are injured and the spirit has ears. Huntress has a loud wind up. Also yeah, the hitboxes are janky but that hurts huntress as much as it helps her.
---
1. Are you gonna mash crtl while in a chase? Because while it is possible, it is very hard to react to the notification it time while you are in a chase, and if you are in recovery for any reason its a no-go. Hardly wasting time is still wasting time. and sure she can force pathing, on the right maps, in the right areas. Like I said, Hag is good, but she has problems.
---
Sure, you could just not chase people, but eventually you are gonna have to try, and if you wait for deadzones against good survivors you will lose the game before that happens. Slug freddy is the best way to play him, but i do not want to slug in this game. It doesn't give any points, and even with KO it has it's problems.
---
What are you talking about. Freddy has less time then everyone else, we have been over this. If they run to a safe pallet and drop it you get rid of it. If they are good you don't.
---
every other 115% M1 killer has better ways of dealing with pallets and creating deadzones. The game doesn't go on for very longer with freddy. You want real stall play skillcheck/totem Doc.
---
Yeah that's true. I climbed to rank 1 survivor way too quickly when I first got the game. 
---
Depends on what you wanna deal with in your life that day bruh
---
Is the distressing in your post the new or the old one? If I remember correctly, in the latest patch notes (that are now online in the ptb) it said that distressing gives 100% bloodpoints.
---
**DO AS I SAY!!** - Laurie Strode, literally every Halloween movie she‚Äôs in 
---
Huntress needs to move up a block.
---
Why do survivors still think killing is toxic?
---
Gods work
---
As a Kate main, you¬¥re right :(
---
You‚Äôre my one true inspiration 
---
Doctor looking dummy thick as usual
---
Whoa, you're a god at Huntress!
---
This. 
---
I always imagined him being a remorseless Killer, but being a very proud and stubborn remorseless Killer; the kind of person who always wants to be in control of the situation.
---
I was this close to putting Nea up there but I knew if I did I would be sacrificed 
---
Yup, that's Reddit! Sorry about that :(
---
Not really what I was going for. I'm actually trying to get people to STOP bitching about it lol
---
Even Amanda has a fully modeled face under her mask.
---
AFAIK the only person left out is Huntress. :'\[
---
Im downvoting posts that talk about ds or noed from now on. Its all subjective and pointless at this point, because nobody listens or has any reasoning.
---
üòâüòâüòâ
---
looping is definitely not toxic.... killer just has to know how to counter, mindgame, or just break off the chase to pursue a different survivor and/or pressure gens  
---
That‚Äôs slightly ominous because I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to imply
---
Mine is the old i suppose. I read the notes when they came out and i didn't see anything about distressing but i will look again because i didn't know it was getting changed
---
Why is the huntress, who is a parent a child?
---
That's awesome thank you for letting me know that. Makes me even more hype for the new chapter to drop
---
Chase the survivors for a total of 2 minutes as The Nea Karlsson üòÇ
---
I OBVIOUSLY MEANT AFTER VAULTING. EXPLAIN HOW SOME ATTACKS DON'T HIT BUT SOME DO. IS THAT INTENDED?
---
Dude Im a rank 1 Killer and Survivor I know how to play as both and what he did was tunnel If I took a clip of it and you watched it you would agree too. I might not be explaning it well but He ignore the person who took me off the hook and came in my direction he should have just went for the dude he was right next to instead of following the scratch marks
---
Awww thank you so much, my friend! Your comment made my day. I‚Äôm really happy you liked my DBD art :D
---
Exactly. If every game is the same we‚Äôd all get bored. I personally like seeing different builds even the occasional insidious basement lol. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a game and you should play it the way you like. I hate getting in lobby‚Äôs and ppl just whine about what perks others use
---
As awesome as it is, it makes me kinda sad.
---
Oh well, we were probably never going to get a Bloody Valentine chapter anyway. :'(
---
EASY COUNTER FOR THE CRYBABYS ABOUT BBQ-CHILI, #1 CRAWL INTO A LOCKER, COUNT TO 5 SECONDS, #2 JEFFS PERK DISTORTION. YOUR WELCOME.
---
I MEANT THE LATTER, OF COURSE. I MEANT VAULT ANIMATION.
---
It's called rebinding your keys. I heal with X now and Gen tap with R1. 
---
Just checked, it says that all tiers award 100% bonus bloodpoints, so did the old tier 1 and 2 give less bloodpoints and now they give the same?
---
Also some facecamp because they lost all their gens and have to secure a kill.
---
Hahahaha no no my friend, I just wanted to smile üòä 
---
Rank reset is such a cluster, just utter chaos
---
I'd be okay with these, nothing too "abusable" and also auto-struggle would improve the experience for many people whose fingers just cant do that (ironic since I play mobas at high APM, but dbd fucking strains my fingers) 
---
Though I think BHVR has said that they will not be making any "accessibility"-changes (this mightve actually just been about colorblind mode dont remember) I do think these are good changes.
---
Also not to be rude but out of curiosity, if she has 1 hand and seeemingly plays on PC how does she move her character? 
---
ah
---
Art idea: baby versions of killers. ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
---
Honestly any of the speed boost addons help.  But of course if you run in the open RIGHT at them, you lose. You have to play similar to pig, if you play either like other killers- you lose. Hard.
---
Quentin is correctly placed.
---
I MISREAD YOUR COMMENT AS 'NOT IF YOU ARE IN THE ANIMATION," SORRY
---
BUT THAT'S STILL INCORRECT. 
---
&gt; EXPLAIN HOW SOME ATTACKS DON'T HIT BUT SOME DO. IS THAT INTENDED?
---
YES
---
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS INVOLVED LIKE HOW FAR AWAY THE KILLER IS, WHEN THEY DECIDE TO BEGIN THEIR LUNGE, IF THE SURVIVOR IS DOING A FAST OR SLOW VAULT, ETC.
---
CAN YOU CITE ANYTHING THAT SAYS IT SHOULD NOT WORK THIS WAY?
---
Despite his negative parenting skills, yes, yes indeed.
---
It also encourages you to bodyblock thereby giving you more opportunities for WGLF stacks
---
Yeah if I‚Äôm in a swf group and we‚Äôre trolling each other it‚Äôd be one thing. But when you do that to some random person that‚Äôs just wrong. 
---
Shit killer thats got one hook all game usually equals NOED
---
Auto assume freddy/wraith/trapper have it
---
Also been a string of diabolically bad billy/myers players for some reason
---
They don't have to secure a kill. If they tunnel one person the entire game it won't make a difference if they get 1k or 0k. They will decpip anyway.
---
Also safe to assume most pigs run it to counter the gen-rush used to beat her traps
---
It shows up on PC as a test build for people to test. Then about two weeks from the start of it, it releases on PC and consoles. It should be there by next week.
---
The gameplay you are seeing is probably from the PTB which you can opt in on PC. The release date of the new chapter is usually a week after the PTB closes and should be available at the same time for all platforms.
---
Hahah you're brutal.   
---
I like to play the hag and lay the most annoying traps you'll ever see. If there are 2-3 killers left I will start putting traps just outside 3 gens in close proximity to eachother. The "triangle", if you will. That way as I go check a gen and they have premonition, they sprint away and bam you have a killer swinging at you as you pass a tree 10m away from the gen. God survivors will stay and finish the gens.   
---
However, if i dont have 3 gens set close to eachother, i will put 5 traps just outside each exit gate. Every nearby window/pallet/corner you will walk by to get to the exit. If I've been getting a lot of toxic survivors latley I'll surley run NoEd and i always have myc as well, of course.  
---
Around rank 5 now and I get a lot of games where theres pretty good survivors so every now and then I let one live. Like if I haven't seen them all match and 2 gens are done I just start setting traps in a line to max bloodpoints and let them find the hatch.
---
The original post stated nothing about getting off a hook. Just that they ran them for 5 gens and got facecamped.
---
I have 3:
---
\-Teammates who do not do Gens or even seemingly everything.  Guess I am expected to do all 5 Gens AND every unhook too...
---
\-Killers who Tunnel (and camp).  Basically the Killer is intentionally ruining the game for that player
---
\-The Game map.  It is so Killer biased that it is basically a guaranteed auto win for them. If that offering is played I immediately quit the game before the map loads.
---
SOMETIMES I GET AFTER FAST VAULTING AND I EVEN START TAKING CONTROL OF MY CHARACTER. THIS HAPPENS EVEN WITH 100 PING. 
---
SURE THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE FACTORS INVOLVED BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEING THIS BAD SAY 6 MONTHS AGO.
---
Yeah,but I feel Bond is superior to it+it's getting nerfed but not to such an extent as DS
---
Like we said, no concrete proof, but lots of allegations. Suspicious at best.
---
Any DLC the PC gets, the PS4 will also get. It's just in PTB(public test build) right now where PC gets to try the new patch and chapter. Basically looking for bugs and balance issues. The players do not get to keep their progress on the real game. And then PC and console gets the DLC officially at the same time
---
Correction. While that is true, some people just don't understand the scoring system. 
---
*darns in freddy*
---
The booty boop
---
Freddy would be *perfect* at babysitting
---
Yeah, Priest is Mid-Low Tier at best. His add-ons are bad unless you run his iridescent addons (but that's every Killer). He has great map pressure but no chase potential. Running at the movespeed he has he has to crawl to late game and hope to outlast the enemy. But with every aggro Survivor player it's impossible to make it to late game with all this genrushing.
---
Honestly, I hope BHVR will buff Priest within the next Chapter.
---
Oh fuck my b I read that wrong you‚Äôre right 
---
I WAMT THAT FEDORA FOR THE SPIRIT
---
SHIT I JUST REALISED FUCK
---
Ik I‚Äôm godtier and FUCK I JUST REALISED
---
I‚Äôm a fucking idiot

Boy

It‚Äôs in the PTB it‚Äôs the secret graphics overhaul (I‚Äôm sosorry I put this in the wrong sub)
---
Someone wanted attention 
---
r/lostredditors
---
I literally was standing still for a few minutes trying to listen to what the crunching sound was and I turned around and someone was cleansing a totem behind my unassuming ass it was great 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Freddy cause I can use the fxxk out of my old boy. Got me to rank 10 once.
---
Now i can finally work on unlocking bbq and chill
---
You do realize The Game has the Lowest Survival Map of All Maps right? You do realize it is the most Killer friendly map in the game game?
---
-It is the easiest Map to track Survivors
---
-It is the easiest map to spot Survivors
---
-It is the hardest map to actually determine the location of the Killer
---
-It is an extremely small map that requires Generators to be done before areas even open up
---
-You say it has the Highest pallet density. Obviously the pallets don't make up for the crazy visibility (no corn, most is brightly lit, lack of buildings, etc)
---
You mistimed it by just a little bit. Just a tiny bit early. The Killer needs to have control over their character before you can pallet save so you need to time it very precisely. It's like a Flashlight save. You can blind the Killer during the pickup, but it won't save unless the Killer has control over their movement. This is why you have to time that precisely so you get the blind off just as they can move.
---
You even got the sound-effect and Killer Stun event score. This means you definitely *hit* the Hag, but doesn't indicate whether you timed it right.
---
Stealth doesn‚Äôt work on legion. Trying to stealthily fix a gen away from other survivors? Well legion just hit your friend and now can see exactly where you are, rip. 
---
Errou o sub kkkkk
---
Its like they‚Äôre asking for you to
---
Yes she was. He got the "Killer Stun" event score *and* the sound effect. He clearly hit her with the pallet. He just timed it too early.
---
Definitely like these changes, especially the heartbeat suggestion for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing.
---
I get why Freddy is with Kenneth, because he's also a clown. Nice.
---
Ok jokes aside this is great
---
I always run Bond, and usually Lithe (Gonna be Head On when I get my hands on it). After that, I run whatever I feel like is worth running
---
Yep
---
I'm also gay and would never use the word in that way. It just leads others to think that it's okay when it isn't okay any more than being racist is. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. 
---
AFAIK [this](https://i.redd.it/hrpb0ohodtgz.png) is what's under her mask.
---
She has no hair, no eyes, and no eyebrows. The features she does have (nose and ears) are also very low resolution, especially compared to the other Killers with masks (Trapper (above), Legion ([F](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a14qgc/legionnaire_frank_unmasked_4k_render/), [Ju](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a14qo8/legionnaire_jules_unmasked_4k_render/), [Jo](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a14k8t/legionnaire_joe_unmasked_4k_render/), [S](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a137xf/legionnaire_susie_unmasked_4k_render/)), and [Amanda](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7smq7o/amandathe_pig_has_a_fully_modelled_textured_face/)).

^(...)
---
^(And no I didn't forget Michael; his mask) *^(is)* ^(his face.)
---
Legion is legit waifu
---
He gambles so much because she took the kids
---
It reminds me of bloody valentine, the mask at least
---
I was thinking Les Claypool
---
This is indeed his face. I recall seeing it during the Beta because, for some reason, the Trapper was in the place of a Survivor, t-posing, without his mask on.
---
:0
---
My favorites are Anna/Amanda, Philip/Sally, and Evan/Herman. Do you sell these anywhere??
---
&gt; LOL. What reason do you have to suggest that Hook Suicides and DLC's are disproportionately higher on that map that other maps? 
---
What are you talking about? No one was talking about a specific map, fam.
---
Oh my god you're referring to OP's title, huh?
---
Hahaha you can't read
---
Doc really out here with zero ass to his name
---
Can I ask why Blood Warden? It's extremely situational and doesn't reliably proc. 
---
You probably moried after first hook
---
It's the same company though? Are you guys directly emailing the cosmetic designers or something? Money goes to the same place. Shared resources allocated. Consumers are allowed to complain about a product they purchased.
---
You get a little green number under your player level that only you can see :)
---
Oh gotcha. I did. I didnt know you couldn't do that
---
You there. Yes you. I'd say eat my upvote, but you'd probably fuck that up somehow too.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Same, but it feels kind of bad to be the only Killer without much of a real face. :p
---
his ability has zero counter play, its even worse when they have franks mix tape 
---
Can someone explain how lunges work? Is it the longer you  hold the farther you lunge? To grab do you have to barely hit the attack button? 
---
Yeah was going to say Black Metal.
---
Not a lot of people know about those sweet Scandinavian sounds.
---
I got downvoted for asking for actual proof so no I doubt he is. It's just word of mouth
---
IT ONLY MAKES A 2 PIP DIFFERENCE. RANK 1 GETS RESET TO 10, WITH 2 PIPS... RANK 2 GETS RESET TO RANK 10 NO PIPS
---
If they made him too much like the movies, nobody would be able to beat em.  Heh.
---

---
I saw that, but I've been playing quite a bit and realized that 9K shards is one hell of an investment. Not to mention that only gets you either the killer or survivor, not both. IMO they're wayyy overpriced in terms of shards.
---
Start writing down what you can remember and try to not think about anything else after you wake up. Grasp every bit you can about your dream, replay the events in your head, then grab a piece of paper or open a google doc and write down everything you can. The more you do this, the easier it will be. I‚Äôm able to recall every bit of my dreams now.
---
Hmm if it‚Äôs ok, maybe I could try to make some stickers or T-shirt later 
---
(This isn‚Äôt my usual build I just wanted to try a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù build pls don‚Äôt come for me)
---
Get yourself someone who looks at you like Herman looks at Evan.
---
What if I just  want to keep you company in the basement?
---
dunno why you downvoting when i literally told. the truth. go watch some ochido is awful type videos. it was in a couple
---
But this is Wraith. He should be laughing in NOED.
---
I‚Äôve gone up against him before. I was Doctor and I got a 4 man against him. He also had no real argument with me. He said I was too little for this game and that my internet was bad without giving any reasons or saying when my internet supposedly messed up (if I had to guess, he was either trying to make excuses for him dying or it lagged for barely a second, which let me hit him and he threw a fit because my internet‚Äôs normally pretty good). He then started talking about my only platinum at the time being Evolve and the fact that I had bought the Godzilla game like they affected my skill in DbD. I think he might have been running out of things to say and just resorted to my other games instead of trying to bring up any real points. He just seems like an entitled player who just wants everyone‚Äôs attention. I even have pictures of the messages and a video of the match that I played with him if you want them. 
---
probably true
---
Im not joking bitch!!
---
#DoccyDummyThicc
---
Remove it.
---
Really? She gets no love in the cosmetic department and I‚Äôm super disappointed with this.
---
Nothing affects dribble speed.
---
Fire up affects kicking stuff and vaulting.
---
if they do, he'll never be fixed tho
---
My thicc doctor is THICC
---
BTW being gay is wrong I just wanted to let you know that, joking about it is fun but if you're serious you're gonna go to hell for having sex with other men.
---
Just a bit to early wait until the animation stops completely and you should be able to get the hit.
---
I got no comment about the hatch but: 
---
&gt;I know my ass will be eaten out nonetheless
---
I think the phrase you're looking for is "I know I'll get my ass chewed." What you wrote has a whole other meaning lol.
---
People like you who find video game women attractive is the larger problem.  The thin line between sexy and fat is one extra donut. No thank you.  
---
right i want every single person who keeps upvoting these low effort unfunny bs daily shit memes to reply to this comment with ur full name and address so i can come to ur house and strangle you with your own fucking tongue
---
Maybe for pathetic losers its enticing. You must have to be a pretty sorry sack of shit to essentially ruin random peoples game because other people in past have ruined yours. Then again I imagine 80% of people playing legion are assholes or are just bad enough at the game that they have to play legion to kill anybody.
---
Doctor should be directly between "teaches" and "watches". Gotta introduce an experimental variable and then monitor the outcome.
---
As a Kate main, I‚Äôm disappointed with this skin. I love that Ace skin though.
---
Has ability just doesn't have any counterplay.  It's literally "I don't want to learn how to play killer so I'll just stab you repeatedly with no real cooldown and run super fast and fast vault everything".
---
This game is full of bugs I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
I don't know what that is, go do your homework 12 year old.
---
Yeah. Im happy she got some new clothes, a claw with accessories and actual hair this time
---
Next you‚Äôre going to tell me that Doc ain‚Äôt Dummy Thicc
---
Good one.
---
4 P3 Claudettes will never be hard, it's just annoying and not worth the effort.
---
Why is this downvoted? Most people in this game are fucking terrible with flashlights and will miss the saves even if you give them a big open area to get it. This sub must be full of terrible killers who can't counter flashlights or don't turn their head so they get chainblinded and give terrible survivors free flashlight saves. 
---
Isn't the phase "I know I'll get my ass torn open"?
---
I think that was the joke 
---
It's not fun being blinded at EVERY pallet. Do you know how many flashlight blinds 4 flashlight carrying claudettes are able to pull off?
---
Unless they have a perk it would take the same amount of time. Two people healing at the same time, at half the rate, is the same as two people taking turns healing at the normal rate. They could get bloodpoints and emblem points if they healed each other though.
---
I loved the idea of killer closing hatch. I assume that a lot of complaints followed. I think closing the hatch should still be allowed, but it powers the remaining generators. Giving the survivor two potential escapes, but they are risky instead of who can wait the longest. Maybe they should open a little faster after, but I think they are fine as is.
---
Michael: *"BOO."*
---
They hated jesus because he told the truth
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôve played against this guy. I got a message after the game from him too.
---
WHATS WORSE THAN NOOBS DC'N, PLAYERS THAT KNOW THE GAME DC'N,  RUIN MY GAME WITH A DC,   REPORT RAGE QUITERS!!!!
---
If she actually looked more like that, maybe more people would like her.  Well done! 
---
No I‚Äôm going to say that ‚Äúthicc‚Äù as you put it is unhealthy.  Glorifying fat is why you see whales wearing skintight outfits thinking they are cute.  Give me anorexic any day over an ass implanted Kardashian
---
r/badbait
---
*Omae wa mou shindeiru.*
---
I play both lol mostly killer ofc but I play survivor when my friends are on
---
The amount of times I've sit a gen working with someone tea-bagging next to me trying to heal me. I'm like, can't you see the broken symbol. Same problem with deliverance.
---
I mean, that's usually how it goes. AFK killers are usually trying to derank without dc'ing, so yeah, they're not going to hook you. 
---
Besides, even if they did try, I'd hope you could survive the fifteen second chase to the exit gate on a map where no pallets have been used. If you can't manage that, then yeah, take your save pip and just leave after the gens are done.
---
Looks really nice. Wish the in-game skin had this kind of hair and not that play-doh bs that sticks to her neck. Nice work!
---
I really wish we got something closer to this:
---
https://static.zerochan.net/Zero.%28Zero.Time.Dilemma%29.full.1998089.jpg
---
Not like Doc doesn't already wear long jackets. 
---
Omg ! 
---
If you can't hear them, they're not moving. I go against wannabe flashlight Claudettes almost every day and very, very, very few can even get a single save. Do you even go against them often? Do you play much killer? I can guarantee you most good killer mains will say the same thing. Flashlights, and especially flashlight saves, have been nerfed almost completely into the ground. 
---
What? That doesn't even relate, I'm a survivor main.
---
It is kinda situational though, as the space thing must be near to the end and if you are 1 meter away from the hook, DS will be able to activate
---
A true jumpscare Myers is capable of this and more. Especially on L√©ry's. You've really gotta start watching out if you go like two minutes without hearing him tier up. There's no hiding, either--Scratched Mirror allows him to see through walls. 
---
They use their power to camp the hook, and a wraith without NOED is not a common sight. 
---
Eleventhed
---
THAT'S NOT SURVIVORS ABUSING HIS POWER. THAT'S DEVS FUCKING HIM UP
---
He would still have no counterplay.
---
The oh no cracked me up

I love you he looked right at you like a Deer caught in headlights.

Jake: "AAAAH! Ha... hah... okay, off you go... Oh, SH--"
---
IT'S BOTH. 
---
Unpopular opinion - Freddy is just fine the way he is, learn how to play him properly.
---
DONT WORRY FELLOW TEAM MATE EVENTUALLY EVERY ONE WILL MOVE OUT OF THE CORRESPONDING POTATO TIERS 
---
Being half deaf  myself I wouldn‚Äôt mind having some sort of visual cue when something is happening on my right. It would be hard to make it not broken but sometimes I miss things because I cannot hear them if they are on my right hand side. 
---
THE KILLER WAS ENDGAME CAMPING (WHICH IS FINE NO BIGGIE) BUT ME AND A TEAMMATE WERE STILL GONNA TRY AND SAVE THEM ANYWAY. WE GO OVER, HE TRIES TO UNHOOK, GETS SLAPPED, SO I TRY TO UNHOOK WHILE KILLER IS STUCK IN ANIMATION... AND SOMEHOW TELEPORT THROUGH THE HOOKED GUY TO HEAL THAT TEAMMATE INSTEAD??? THAT SMALL ERROR GOT BOTH OF THEM KILLED WHILE I COULD ONLY CROUCH WALK OUT THE EXIT GATE IN SHAME
---
Dear God, it‚Äôs as terrible as tales spoke, Quentin perks are terrible..
---
I love this!! That‚Äôs my favorite skin for her. Alternative Nea is my bae 
---
NO IT'S NOT. WHAT, ARE THE SURVIVORS SUPPOSED TO JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE IN THE DREAM WORLD BEFORE GOING FOR THE UNHOOK? COME ON
---
Yeah.
---
When you have adrenaline but your teammates never pull you off the hook after all gens are done  :/
---
I WISH LOBBIES WERE SEARCHABLE SO I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT 10 OR MORE MINUTES FOR ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR ME TO PLAY A KILLER
---
I'm not, though. I live in a European country.  
---
The age of consent applies to teenagers under 18. However, when over the age of 18, most legal systems say to stick to other people over 18. Keyword here is most.  
---
Again, though, there are a ton of factors to consider, as it's not a black and white issue. For example, use of alcohol or drugs, as well as the age gap is one of the more prominent things judges will look at when faced with a case of statutory rape, sexual misconduct, underage grooming, or anything else of the sort.
---
Had to wait until we had an even number of killers on this one
---
Again, I don't play it all the time and mostly focus on Xbox, but I have been playing a bit lately. I usually let the dailies fill up.
---
Mega oof
---
I DISLIKE THAT AFTER THE RANK RESET I AS A NEW AND RATHER INEXPERIENCED KILLER THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THE META SURVIVOR PERKS AND THAT EVEY GAME IS A GROUP OF P3 CLAUDETTES MEGS OR ETC.
---
I ALSO HATE THAT WHEN IM PLAYING SURVIVOR I NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIGH- RANK DOWNRANKED PEOPLE WITH ALL THE META KILLER PERKS WHILE ME AT MY PRE RESET TIER 9 HAS TO DEAL WITH THEM AND IDIOT TEAM MATES THAT FARM ME ON HOOK
---
Ok
---
I sacrificed a Meg who was being farmed by a Claudette last night. She DS‚Äôd me and I was slightly annoyed about it, as well as being a sore sport from the game before. I think the Claudette was being a survivor vigilante by being anti-DS, but I showed the Claudette no mercy as well. The Meg DC‚Äôd on her last hook (rightfully so), and one guy DC‚Äôd during the shit show, while poor David was doing gens. Guilt flashed throughout my body at what a shit show the match was, and I was going to show David mercy. I didn‚Äôt. I was in too deep and I killed him too. I felt so scummy after and quickly left the end screen. 
---
^^^David, ^^^Quentin, ^^^and ^^^sort-of ^^^Meg, ^^^if ^^^you‚Äôre ^^^out ^^^there, ^^^I‚Äôm ^^^sorry. 
---
Don't you be disrespectin daddy Trapper. 
---
Oh don't worry, plenty of us already associate with them already 
---
Now I kinda wanna see a killer that fakes being hooked and if pulled off, punches you in the face
---
HONESTLY I THINK THEY WERE JUST MAD BECAUSE THEY WERE SO EASY TO FIND. BRIGHT HAIRED NEA WHO RAN EVERYWHERE. 
---
Nope, I do it all the time 
---
Bill would be a harsh but amazing parent. He kept 3 other survivors alive in a zombie apocalypse and sacrificed himself. Definitely the top slot.
---
Hey, just wanted to update you. I've been on the skill check site practicing, and had a game last night where I was the only one to finish gens and somehow, in Gideon meat plant, was still the last survivor caught. Thanks for the help again! 
---
Here's my thought--the Killer should be allowed to close the hatch on two conditions:
---
1. There is only one survivor remaining and one or more gens to still be repaired. If the exits are powered Survivors are free to use the hatch. 
---
2. If the Hatch is opened with a key, the Killer can close it without prerequisites, therefore instantly ending the time for which the hatch can be open immediately. The Hatch will not reopen for the last survivor in this case due to the killer already having lost a potential kill. 
---
r/Iamverybadass
---
Personally I think once you hit rank 1 you shouldn't be able to drop below rank 10. If you can hit rank 1 you have a good enough understanding of the game that you should never be playing with new/bad players.
---
STOP FACECAMPING AND T-BAGGING I WILL JUST KILL YOU FASTER AND LOOP YOU LONGER!
---
He's too strong to play against if he tunnels you to death when he hits with frenzy  and weak to play if everyones spread out
---
I get it. I‚Äôve played some real try hard killers , NOED, etc and I was sooooo close to getting out. I‚Äôm always tempted to type something rude but just exit out. The game does get competitive sometimes but once the game starts getting to that point for me I take a break.  
---
I very rarely get a legit gg from survivors. I main Freddy and Leatherface (Neither of them are mid tier) and every time I 4k or 3k I get trash talked about how Freddy and Leatherface are too OP and that they are pay to win. I simply reply with a GGWP every time and they proceed to call me a baby killer. Survivors are too entitled sometimes. 
---
Again, in almost all European countries an 18 year old can have sex with a 16 year old.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe
---
Before the new DLC announcements, there were a couple folks speculating about a Werewolf.  That got me thinking that such a character would open up a whole new kind of stealth system‚Äîone that didn't rely on shrinking a terror radius or vanishing into thin air, but a more sinister and deceptive stealth.
---
See, the Werewolf would have two modes:  one, of course, is the classic wolfed-out mode; and I don't mean windswept modern model-dog, I mean horrible snarling, drooling hell-beast ala *Werewolf (87-88)* and *Dog Soldiers (2002)*.  A truly terrifying abomination that would slash with its claws and have a huge lunge-bite with its saliva-spewing maw.
---
But the Werewolf would also have a human mode.  While in this mode, he'd look and move like a survivor:  crouching around the map, pretending to move around loops and through buildings, feigning work on a generator, luring in survivors with the promise of momentary companionship and the strength of numbers.  Only when you approach too close do you notice the ragged clothes and the bloodstained nails.  By then it's too late.  You try to run, but after a few seconds of horrifying transition, the beast is upon you.
---
It sounds neat, I think.  Only problem is:  they'd have to come up with a mighty ass-ton (2.6 regular ass-tons) of cosmetics for the thing's human mode or people would just memorize what it looks like from a distance and avoid it.  Heh.
---
I hate people who downvote or talk shit to new players! Great way to get the player into the game guys!
---
**Ages of consent in Europe**
---
The ages of consent vary by jurisdiction across Europe. The ages of consent are currently set between 14 and 18. The vast majority of countries set their ages in the range of 14 to 16; only four countries, Cyprus (17), Ireland (17), Turkey (18) and Vatican City (18), do not fit into this pattern. The laws can also stipulate the specific activities that are permitted or differentially specify the age at which a given sex can participate.

The best thing about Freddy is how salty people get when you play him. I‚Äôm a nurse main but decided to do the end game freddy build ( remember me and noed ) and they get SOOOO mad. Like fine I‚Äôll go back to getting ez 4ks with the nurse lmfao. 
---
But I put effort into each of my posts. :(
---
Some not as good as others, sure, but I couldn't possibly make A+ content every day, so I make these to break the monotony and satisfy my creative urges. 
---
I'm hoping for this week
---
Yeah. Or killer DCs on certain maps. I‚Äôm not taking a survivor / killer stance as I play both pretty often, but people just get way too worked up. I guess I‚Äôm ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù but sometimes it does get to me, I‚Äôll often turn off chat just for that reason. Let‚Äôs just have fun ! 
---
Me too. It suckedfor my next game because it made it hard to hear through the whole thing.
---
If you run No Mither you're always exposed.
---
He‚Äôs good for noed and remember me. The 50% slower opening the door plus built in deerstalker is amazing. Down and slug them right at the end. 
---
Standard thing to do to a Kate. 
---
I agree, but do you really instantly feel sick seeing an overweight person?
---
Isn't that as frustrating as a DC? I mean, yeah they get blood points, but there was no fun to it.
---
Freddy OP üòÇ. I play Freddy pretty often and I think because he‚Äôs not played much people just struggle against him and his style of play sometimes which works out nice.

Damn right Billy's running at the end! No one steals Michael's Add-on's and gets away with it!

I got rank 1 with freddy, getting 4k's the whole way there this last season. No idea what anyone is talking about, sure he's not as good as billy or nurse, but is he suppose to be or something?
---
I don't get the whole "face me again and I'll beat you" mentality. Do you actually care that much what some random player on the internet thinks of your "skills"? You'll probably never even see them again.
---
Don't listen to this dude, I think you are really talented person, it's not eazy to animate and you are posting this daily, I would upvote it twice if I could.

It has pros though, especially paired with perks that help you when injured.

My point is that being puked on wont do shit if you're already running it, so you wouldn't need to cure yourself and give the killer Corrupted vomit.
---
Killer doesn't know about it, and usually never will since there's always a hook close enough to make it useless. The only times I'm ever really able to hit wiggle is if I go down near a hook that's already gone or if it's a map like Lery's or The Game.

I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre either exaggerating, or you‚Äôre thinking of 300 pound women instead of mildly overweight ones.
---
Frank and Julie is the relationship I dream I had. Haha~
---
Huh, 1200 hours and never knew that. The more you know.
---
F
---
Think I'll try to learn Nurse too since I'll focus more on the survivors for now. I'm going back and forth on xbox and it's taking longer.
---
Sorry, noticed a mistake...seems you put Trapper pretty low, my man is supposed to be on top
---
Mhm He‚Äôs just perfect 
---
What platform?
---
Lol I know. I honestly I just wanted the game to be over. Your good at looping and jukes, that‚Äôs great. But sorry you got caught ? Is it really that important to you I know how good you are ? üôÑ needless to say I‚Äôm done for the day üòÇ
---
The scratch marks have been pretty wonky lately.
---
They‚Äôre such an adorable couple!
---
I thought trapper was a happy killer.
---
I mean.. look at his mask
---
u/themikeotr

r/dbdgonewild wouldn't mind

Give me my 1:30 minutes back.

T-bagging and doing a fake self care after every pallet or window is toxic. If you don't do that, you aren't being toxic. 
---
FREDDY CAN'T FUCKING STOP THEM, THAT'S MY ENTIRE POINT. COME ON.
---
Eat shit, a classic
---
&gt;  just annoying and not worth the effort.
---
Hmmm, if they are annoying and not worth the effort, it sounds like it    might be hard...
---
Ps4
---
Just admit it‚Äôs bait, then people won‚Äôt think your skull is that dented.
---
In a way, I like that there is *some* of those who reject my work because then I don't get so big-headed. 
---
Plus, those who provide constructive criticism help my work become better. Point out specific flaws
---
No. Weight is disgusting.  It instantly changes people and there is nothing more disgusting that an overweight person funneling their gruel to add another layer of padding to the 8.  Mild overweight is not attractive either.  You dont need to be 500 pounds but if you are a woman and over 135-140 pounds it‚Äôs extremely gut wrenching.  Literally and mentally.
---
When o was little my fucking portal was shot by a ghast and it closed... now that was hell
---
*Plague laughs in bloody vomit*
---
Yup, the longer you hold the farther you lunge, although there is of course a limit to how far you can lunge. I think the longest a lunge can be is only half a second, anyway. All killers have the same lunge distance except for T1 Myers and I think Nurse. 
---
Grabs only work with tapping the attack key. You have to be within a certain distance and they have to be injured.
---
woah that's dark dude
---
This is why my PSN messages are private. As a killer I got messages like this after every game.
---
Yeah, she was coming home from school or something like that and her father went bezerk. 
---
STFU, you probably use decisive strike, self care, dead hard and borrowed time. Killers have literally 1 crutch perk, survivors have way more than what I just listed.
---
Lol I saw gg even I get absolutely dumpstered with 1 hook and 2 bronze medals at the end.
---
Honestly, on the sub where killers, survivors, legion, decisive etc. =bad, where Freddy is a meme (even though nobody plays him so they can't really judge him) it is quite refreshing to see these kinda Posts. Keep up good work my man. 
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
BUT THEY'RE NOT ABUSING HIS POWER BY UNHOOKING BEFORE THEY'RE IN THE DREAM WORLD LMFAO THEY'RE JUST PLAYING NORMALLY
---
welcome to rank reset 
---
Ok. I've mostly played killer.

You are right. Let me get him a tampon.

I meant that players have been complaining about hit box size forever. 
---
hhh YES I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING
---
did someone say
---
nerf him to the ground?
---
I was rank 1 before reset and i get matched with a rank 15 huntress with only 1 perk. I felt kinda bad after the game knowing her rank.
---
I WAS FIVE PIPS OFF 1 
---
This gping to hunt me to the grave
---
He is the Lorax and he speaks for the trees

Latrice 
---
Claudette is scarier than any killer in the game
---
Yeah, from the backstory I don't think there's any way he would have willingly left his father.  It says his father was found abandoned in a warehouse‚Äîno way old Trappy would have done that.  My guess is that the Entity came calling, he hid his father from it and took the thing head-on.  Entity liked his zeal and snapped him up.
---
I highly suspect that it took a *great* deal of "persuasion" on the Entity's part to get him to cooperate with the trials, and I think he really shows a lot of that wear and tear.
---
you are less gay from being gay

I recently had an issue with vaulting windows in lerys. The windows would close when I entered a chase with a killer couldn‚Äôt vault anything but pallets.
---
Saying use mint rag unironically is actually hilarious and somehow more ignorant than people saying legion is OP and ‚Äújust use franks‚Äù. Go ahead and try to use a pink add on for more than 50% of your games, it probably won‚Äôt happen. 
---
‚ÄúNurse has objective disadvantages and are harder to play than most killers‚Äù okay but you still haven‚Äôt refuted my argument - It doesn‚Äôt matter that she‚Äôs more difficult to play as when a correctly played nurse outperforms every killer, even on console at max potential. To say she isn‚Äôt #1 because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs hard‚Äù isn‚Äôt objective, it‚Äôs subjective which makes your list unreliable at best. 
---
Go ahead and drop a trap mid chase and tell me what the survivor does. If the answer is ‚Äúrun to the next loop‚Äù, then congrats you understand the problem. You act as if running through an open field and being able to drop a trap means they‚Äôll set it off, but a survivor worth their salt will watch the killer enough on loops to know when it‚Äôs time to leave
---
I'd put Doctor in J tier (Joke-tier) below Freddy.  
---
And Spirit doesn't need Prayer beeds to be better than Billy ;) Billy can be easily looped, Spirit can't.
---
I KNOW THIS SUB LOVES HIM BUT MYERS IS WORKING HIS WAY TOWARDS MY "LEAST FUN TO PLAY AGAINST" LIST. HE EITHER HAS A LOW AS SHIT TERROR RADIUS OR SOMETIMES NONE BECAUSE THEY ALL RUN M&amp;A OR HE'S POPPING T3 RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU AND YOU'RE FUCKED. 
---
MYERS HAS SOME GOOD ADD-ONS THAT REALLY CHANGE THE WAY HE PLAYS! HE CAN BE WALLHACK STEALTH MYERS ON LERY'S OR MEAT PLANT! HE CAN BE UNLIMITED T3 TOMBSTONE MYERS FOR UNLIMITED FUN! BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT BURGER KING MYERS... HE'S ALRIGHT THOUGH IT'S KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME.
---
Spirit is Top-Tier Waifu!!! Fix your List!
---
I love this so much
---
How is she babylonian with that shoe ;)
---
Yes, it did...
---
I would have loaded legion with Frank's and a red Mori üòÇ
---
I'm a rank 3 survivor and I've only seen a legion twice. Where are all these legions everyone keeps complaining about?
---
I can‚Äôt relate 
---
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NEVER SEEING BBQ AND CHILI IN THE SHRINE OF SECRETS. I'M NOT BUYING LEATHER FACE  SO PUT IT IN THERE PLEASE!!

That was probably scary

That edit totally is helping you out

WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS MF'ER!!

I FEEL THIS ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL. MY BLOODPOINT WHORE BUILD HAS WGLF AND BORROWED TIME, BUT I STILL GET SHIT FOR WGLF BECAUSE ‚ÄúIT MAKES YOU A SANDBAGGER‚Äù AS I TAKE HITS FOR THE PERSON I SAVED
---
If you complain about legion you should really consider getting better. 
---
Lost my first ever diamond pick
---
I guess not being able to heal wouldn't make any difference with no mither but at that point why not ditch that stupid perk and bring something useful. You're not going to heal anyways. Are you just hoping she'll slug you despite knowing you have no mither?
---
Correct.
---
I just meant that it isnt difficult to go through, its just unnecessary amount of annoying
---
ACCORDING TO YOU? YEAH.
---
I see them mostly between ranks 12-5. Just saw my first one in a couple days today after the rank reset. But they‚Äôre still a giant pain in the ass.
---
Shattered*
---
Why do you think Hag has babies? I thought she is a teen.
---
It always got to the same conclusion tho: It's useless against SWF and the time required to spend camouflaging oneself through the map in a convincing way would give you no map control/pressure at all, it would instead take it away.
---
We already got Pig and Legion. Pig could work pretty much as you said, but alas, we can't have a ton of cosmetics for her. People still mistake her for a Claudette tho. Same goes for Legion, except this time we did got a ton of cosmetics.
---
You're mistaking wraith for spirit =P
---
Both legions I played against only got a 2k, they can't be that bad to go against
---
ill freeze myself then
---
She's not a parent, Anna grew up feral after her mom died when she was like, 8. While she has maternal instincts, she tried to satisfy those feelings by kidnapping children and caring for them, but her lack of child-rearing knowledge and the poor condition of her home meant they didn't last very long under her care.
---
They dont need a counter. If survivors swarm to killer = no gens. If killer just turn around and then pick them up, its a counter to one person. If killer checks area or looks at wall, its a counter. Its fun to use killer addons and its fun for survivors to run flashlights. Why ruin the fun for survivors.
---
As someone who hates the shitposts on the sub and wishes we had Thoughtful Thursday back.... no. I like these daily template memes
---
Only Frank and Julie share a weapon, really. Joey and Susie both have their own weapon
---
yeuup. I love Anna, but she *SUCKS* at looking after kids.
---
You can still spread the sickness and fuck your team though... 
---
... Why the hell are you posting on the DBD Subreddit about Minecraft?
---
why D tier?
---
Uhhhh maybe I just leaked a new killer, Ghast 
---
dang. I definitely thought that voice chat would've been a thing, but that's because most multiplayer games do. Is there still a large number of people that play the public servers? Is it easy to get into games on a consistent basis or does it take a while to match make?
---
I usually get like 4ks on Freddy I dunno why people have such a hard time with him, just gotta corral the people together 
---
It‚Äôs rough for Survivors, even solo,  but as Killer I get games no issue.
---
I never use any of those anymore. I only ever use BBQ for the blood point boost or very specific builds.
---
Self Care takes for ever and it almost always a waste of time considering you could have used that perk slot for After Care, Bond, or Empathy to help you find teammates.
---
Rank 1 survivor and killer. (Rank 10 as of today's reset) -Soul Ripper117 -Xbox
---
Nah wraith is a grown man who was doing messed up stuff without knowing he got mad at his boss for it his boss says thats how mafia works and wraith just takes his bosses spine and head off
---
Not if everyone is running no mither
---
Those homophobes...They should be the ones going to Hell...
---
Freddy and bicheal lmao
---
DBD's bugs are overblown in my experience, I don't see most of the issues people are constantly whining about very often. It's far from perfect yes, but it's not THAT bad, at least on PC. Add that to the fact it's the only good game in this genre and i think DBD is in a decent spot. Absolutely BHVR needs to slow down the chapter releases and spend some time fixing bugs, but it's not a matter of the game will die if they don't take a month off chapters entirely to fix things right now.
---
BE does allow you to use autoclicking software for struggling. You'll have to install a third party software of some kind but it is an option.
---
Best to follow this guy's advice.

---
Keep in mind that a lot of perks are dogshit while few perks are godlike.
---
So it makes sense you'll see a ton of bad perks on the shrine. It's unlikely that BBQ wouldn't show up yet but I doubt they'd weigh the RNG. Even with the money they'd get from people buying LF, they make way more money from a new chapter release and cosmetics.
---
As soon as he said rank 10-15 I just fucking lost it.
---
Adding onto what you said, the lower rank (rank 1-5) flashlight users usually have the murky bulb or w/e it's called and can "blind-lock" you. Even then, it's easy to figurre out where they are and smack their ass.
---
Bonus points if you run https://i.imgur.com/HgiglKv.png

Why have Shattered Bloodline when you can have Shattered Skull? Featuring the new character, unjustified homophobia!
---
I‚Äôm laughing too hard at this 
---
Nah
---
The fact that one of the issues the survivors have to overcome is being randomly spawned makes voice chat kinda meta. If the survivors can coordinate around the killer, it allows them to essentially run circles around them. A well-coordinated team can really fuck over a killer if they have voice chat.   
---
It depends lol. The matchmaking is a point of contention rn. A lot of people are displeased with it because sometimes it takes a while, it will matchmake wildly different ranks (I've been rank 1 and been matchmade against a rank 20 killer. Needless to say the rank 20 got destroyed and it just wasn't fair). But I'd say it doesn't take too long if you're playing alone and still new. It only really slows down once you get higher in ranks. 
---
All animations in DBD are locked once started and can't be interupted (save for killer grabs on vaults and such)
---
This means when going for pick up saves, you must wait for the animation to be completed before trying the save. This goes for flashlights and firecrackers as well.
---
You know what, I think it's better to delete your comment or accept it's bait before this goes out of hands.
---
Susie or riot.
---
For nurse, you just gotta practice a lot and learn how far your blinks will go, and what survivors will do to juke you. Oftentimes, if they turn a corner, they will come back around the corner after you blink, so instead of blinking around the corner, just blink forward. 
---
For add ons, I would use the pocket watch for training, as it reduces your fatigue time. Also bring whatever cancels out the negative effect of the pocket watch(don‚Äôt remember it off the top of my head, it‚Äôs either the spoon or the comb).
---
Don‚Äôt swing your blade unless you are confident you will hit a survivor, because swinging after a blink will increase your stun time by a second.
---
There are a couple nurse guides on YouTube 
---
One by
---
[Bricky](https://youtu.be/KayVcAi9_tE) that‚Äôs a bit old but has decent explanations
---
And one by [Ardetha ](https://youtu.be/EfnmZvK4l88)  that‚Äôs more in depth and has numbers
---
*pushes up glasses* if you read the lore
---
pfft, Rin in back like *WAAAAAHH*
---
There really aren't any tips for Nurse. She's all about muscle memory. Get used to her blinks, develop the ability to learn from and adapt to survivors' movement on the fly.
---
Got those 2 things and you'll be a good Nurse. How do you get that? Practice!
---
I advise you to try Nurse without add-ons, and learn her that way, too. Since she's all about muscle memory, if you get accustomed to playing with add-ons, it'll be hard to use her effectively whenever you play without / run out of add-ons.
---
Can we stop just saying ‚Äúthis‚Äù? It contributes absolutely nothing to the conversation and wastes space on the internet superhighway 
---
Ooooo it's NOED and Ebony mori time!
---
as i pointed out in the thread, in the original script freddy was a child rapist as well as child murderer. they cut the rapist part out of the original films but the remake put it back in
---
You know someone knows they're out of arguments when they whip out the old "kiddo" at some random person online. I'm 20 next week, and the fact you'd go around crying "kiddo" means you're probably 16 or under lmao. Even if you're older, that's seriously embarrassing. 
---
I just wanna beat you down and watch you crawl around. See you at rank 1 üòàüòà
---
Welp, looks like i'm going to take a break from playing nurse and play trapper.
---
It is honestly them messing with the matchmaking or just a killer shortage in general. Usually the slow match making is due to a bug in the actual matchmaking system. This wouldn‚Äôt be the first time.
---
Pretty sure they cut all support for the pc and console version while they go to work on the Switch :(
---
i'm finding games ok, i'm on the west coast side (idk if that has to do anything) but games do slow down passed 9pm
---
Survivor less than 2min killer instant 
---
ouch, i know that feeling
---
I got called toxic by a doc that was camping and tunneling because we popped his hex and was looping him.
---
k.
---
In the stun sounds tier list, definitely.
---
Where would you put her?
---
Fair enough
---
Who are you talking about in this?
---
I might have to do that myself it gets really annoying sometimes

Eleventhed (now its illegal)
---
He is also fairly easy to loop...
---
I don't see any trap on your head.
---
Those rituals are less total BP than 2 matches as a killer with BBQ lol
---
To be fair, if I was a babysitter and a homicidal stalker was after us I'd probably be yelling at the kids too. Before Myers shows up she's all making popcorn and watching movies with the kids.
---
My friend has a pro and its not even that better to be honnest
---
Yup, still wrong.

No Pig is an RNG killer. She can be very good or very bad, it depends.

I'M SICK OF THESE ENTITLED KILLER MAINS SAYING NOED ISN'T A PROBLEM!!! YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING BRAINDEAD TO THINK OTHERWISE!!!

There is a pretty good Deaf streamer that I watch, [https://www.twitch.tv/deafgirl\_gaming](https://www.twitch.tv/deafgirl_gaming)  
---
She uses perks to her advantage of not being able to hear well. I dont know if this is something that would benefit your sister? Best of luck.  
---
Oh yeah I agree, I‚Äôm just using that quote to support the OP‚Äôs choice. She definitely was a good babysitter, she fought off the Boogeyman of all people. 
---
I hardly play (less than 500 hr) and have bought 2 killers for 9000 each and an outfit or two for another 14k or so....It's really not that hard to get shards.
---
perks and addons do not come into play in tier lists. his 3 second rev charge gives survivors enough time to find a window pallet or even a locker and render his power useless
---
i meant use the name thing not legion tho lmao
---
I think most characters cost 9000 shards, and the original chapters are always $7.99 on Xbox. Not sure about auric prices though. I‚Äôve never bought a character that way tbh. Probably the same as what you have paid in the past. 
---
Ooh the Michael Jackson Myers makes me happy
---
Id say mid bottom, around Legion and Wraith.
---
Two defaults in their natural habitat lul
---
"gain haste" nerd
---
I feel like Hillbilly should move down to the Child category.
---
I'm pretty sure this was the intended idea but they couldn't get it right so they scrapped it and shoe horned basically an m1 ability with a timer last minute. 
---
Exactly right. "Toxic" is daring to stay alive. The nerve of those survivors right?
---
But then killers will face camp to secure a kill, and think that's justified because those oh so toxic survivors dared to run away for slightly longer than they liked.
---
BTW are you in the tutorial entity discord?
---
PROBABLY MEANS THE SURVIVOR WAS ON THEIR LAST PHASE WHEN THEY WERE DOWNED AND USED DS? NO MATTER WHAT - STOP TEABAGGING AT THE EXIT!
---
Man, on PC I've only ever had some of the coolest most sincere games.
---
As a killer I occasionally catch some salt.
---
But I'm also only ever between ranks like 8 and 12
---
Not all I think I have had it happen on redforest, lerys and Autohaven/blood lodge
---
Which reminds me, what's SWF?
---
I quit due to the toxicity on both sides, and solo survivor is horrible.
---
Bhvr doesn't know what they are doing really. 
---
Don‚Äôt get caught. Why didn‚Äôt I think of this. Omg and you know what. It works on every killer. Guys! DON‚ÄôT GET CAUGHT! I think this is gonna be the new meta. 
---
Came here to suggest both of these actually! Honestly these are the *best* and most immediate solutions for OP's sister. 
---
The macro completely solves the struggle issue (could even do one for wiggling on the killer's shoulder too). Stake Out is great too but the only issue I could see with it is that sometimes you get stuck with all 4 tokens and don't have anything to spend them on, and the timer doesn't tick if you have full stacks. Might be a good idea to pair it with Premonition or Spine Chill too? Also wouldn't be great VS huntress since her Lullaby technically isn't terror radius.
---
like Legion is in any way busted in a way comparable to Freddy.  Stopping complaining will give them the impression he's fine, and he's the furthest thing from it.
---
I don't think she said that in the Busta Rhymes one.
---
...really dragging it into a thread where Leigon isn't even involved?
---
Trapper can be my waifu uwu
---
Well duh, we all know that Busta Rhymes was the final girl in that movie.
---
like yeah he is just a bit worse billy. he just doesnt have the map pressure
---
Can I ask why? I‚Äôve seen some gameplay and studied her a bit but can‚Äôt seem to figure out a possibly play style that would fully work. 
---
Lol no.
---
If camping was meta he would be god tier. Just saying.
---
Why not?
