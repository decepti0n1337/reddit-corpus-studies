Behvr: not in the rules
---

---
But deranking is ok
---
---
---
I always imagine Oni at like 30 feet tall because he scares me
---
The problem that he sees with other killers is that they have to follow the survivors rules. That's why he likes his playstyle on Wraith and Ghostface so much, he doesn't have to chase, everyone else does. I personally don't agree with them being 3&amp;4 I just think that more killers are viable than people think. I'm not basing my argument on any one specific addon that's hard to find. Iri is replaceable, the tape isn't m. But, the tape is yellow, it's easy to get. Alot of killers have one to two "can't do without" addons. Huntress and clown have exhaustion, billy and bubba have insta saw, plague has vomit effectiveness. ect. I don't think it's a problem to consider addons as a part of a killer's viability of they're easy to get.
---
I feel like you bringing up gen rush is a bad point. Every killer can get gen rushed, it's not Doc exclusive. Not to mention there isn't such a thing as prethrowing pallets when you have the tape. You always have enough range to stop a pallet drop.
---
You're right, he doesn't have map pressure. But, he makes up for that in constant info. Being able to see the survivors is more important than getting to where they are quickly because you can't get to them if you don't know where they are. Without info, you're put in a guessing game where the speed is less consistent than the manifestations and screams.
---
Format?
---
instead of flashlight i thought you were going to mention t-bagging
---
I’m clearing the cache in steam itself. I just said download cache because that’s where it was located in settings
---
Bruh don't mention the hivemind! It attracts them!
---
For context, Guy on hook was being hard camped and everyone else was on death hook while i hadnt been downed yet, so i went to the effort to give myself up because me on hook would give the others well over a minute... i immediately regretted my decision.  Ace also had dead hard so i knew he would make it away from the hook.
---
if i could, i'd teabag OP's post
---
Cool just making sure. I'll check back in a bit
---
Billy doesn't need insta-saw to be viable, his two common add-ons are good enough.
---
And probably the bulkiest
---
He wasn't shitting on anyone, just asking a question regarding the constant flow of said post.
---
I mean, you had to be at least somewhat tunneling for them to DS you.
---
Which fog whisperer was it?
---
the thing is it allows them to do really cocky things like unhooks in front of killer and work on gens and the killer can do nothing about it
---
Context: October/Octobies (Tofu's SO) posted a tweet along the lines of "Honestly I dont know why people shit talk Tru3talent, i find it very inspiring that someone with severe development disabilities can be sucessful on twitch" then EdgarAllenBro laughed at the joke too, and thats the jist of it.
---
Those aren't useful at all.  Screaming when you get hooked is whatever, same for getting hit.
---
If you watch Otz's video on him commenting about it, I see Tru3's point he can be good with the right perk and addon combination
---
For survivors definitely 
---
1 Adrenaline 
---
2Dead Hard (Or Balanced Landing both same imo)
---
3Prove Thy Self
---
4Spine Chill(or Resilience but with both it’s really good)
---
5Unbreakable(Quick and Quite can also be as good) 
---
Other perks are really good too but can be really situational which is why DS isn’t on here anymore the nerf really killed its value for me basically useless most times, I don’t play killer that much so idk which perks would be the best but this are definitely the best if not definitely top tier perks imo but I would also like to run different perks lmk what you think :)
---
If that’s the only skill involved, then he isn’t as completed as we thought he was. I personally wish they kept the flick and made the cooldown for his dash more punishing. You could just run into a loop and wait for the survivor to overcommit and get your free down.

---
Thanks! Unfortunately I didn't have OBS or shadow play running at the time to get my side of it.
---
Mostly just play to get better hatches and get my 4 bbq tokens
---
This is adorable and i love it. Please continue.
---
People thought Billy flick was as intended beforehand
---
Hag is basically a corpse, the only thing keeping her going is willpower and entity magic.
---
I get one very game. If not a d/c, then an instant suicide on hook. Been this bad for a few months..
---
honestly if i get into a match and see a Fog Whisperer charm, I know I'm about to have a really shitty match
---
I was being satirical.
---
So it did nothing
---
As an Ace main this makes me warm inside
---
&gt;October/Octobies
---
why the fuck would she post that lol
---
Thought wraith could look good with it too
---
This was so pure.
---
I’ve actually been wanting to run quick and quiet and resilience but I just didn’t know what to switch it out for, thanks a bunch
---
I think people misunderstand what makes basement trapper scary. It’s not traps at the bottom of the stairs. It’s trapping the window and one of the exits, making leaving the shack extremely hard. 
---
I had a lil baby Jane teabag me after dropping shack pallet(and getting hit) within the first 45 seconds of the game.  She then camped an unsafe pallet, tea bagged after dropping it and went down.
---
I had to show her the reason not to do that so I drag her to basement, trap window and far door and run off to patrol gens on the near door side. Survivors have no trouble getting in and unhooking, but by then I am at the only safe exit and everyone is fucked.
---
Same case with trapper. I can't play trapper without running an extra traps add on and honing stone. Thankfully I dumped a lot of bloodpoints on trapper so I have quite the amount of add ons for these but still, you should not rely on add ons for a killer to be decent. It also removes add on variety
---
Definitely give Freddy a try if you have him. I've also started playing the Wraith lately and he's pretty fun, too.
---
I guess to make fun of Tru3 by saying he has "severe development disabilities"
---
I kinda forget but does calm spirit counter SFTS?
---
Idk I'm always at red rank for both survivor and killer and id say the only annoying thing is that you always vs the same killers with the same builds and a lot of noeds, not ebony mori every game though because with new ranking system it's hard to pip using one.
---
But did BHVR give conflicting statements about it after it was nerfed?
---
Lmao I see everything you just said at red ranks all the time, besides accusing the killer of wall hacks. Its soooo common for people to d/c when they're found first that I'll hardly even play solo queue anymore because once the first one quits someone else usually does too because they dont want to deal with it.
---
IKR its so weird, even some days even after multiple matches of trying I still miss half of them while on other days I will hit everything. They could give me the tiniest skillcheck in the world and I would still get it.
---
Nurse is floating, thats no fair
---
I'm just gonna stick my dick in red and dip. I dont need to go balls deep.
---
Still no response... :)
---
This Billy comparison is the most annoying to me. If people are going to bring up timed abilities, compare him to Myers. But that won’t make their tears seem worth it lol
---
More than ‘some’ practice lol
---
Again this was when I watched her. Maybe shes different now but she used to be a total generic toxic claudette. I can assure you of that.
---
Slug
---
I just did a match and the survivors are pissed about the constant bing bongs in the background
---
And I honestly think it looks better than his default.
---
Firstly I think you’re taking wording too literally. We all know BHVR has a history of failing to deliver a message correctly. Secondly, yes there most definitely were conflicting statements. And communication was much worse then, seeing as the Billy flick stayed for quite some time.
---
It happened to me but I just closed Dbd and then it just gave it to me, not sure if that will help you, good luck tho, from another person who just got rank one for the first time
---
I can "somewhat" understand trying to defend dark sense of humor(although joke was shit and clearly Tofu tried to attack Tru3 for no reason like how he always tries to) but telling people to drink acid is just ***Y I K E S***
---
Nah I really feel you on that point. I get killed first almost every game I play and yet I'm still hovering around 5-6. Literally one unhook, part of a gen and a 30 second chase will guarantee you dont depip. Definitely wish it was easier to derank because now all I do is essentially sandbag my team and then still stay the same rank
---
They don't appreciate good music
---
I’m rank 6 rn, yesterday I played 5 games in a row with ebony Moris and at least 3 of them had 1 dc
---
I love ghost
---
Kate would’ve crawled out anyway
---
Do you have any DLC?
---
Oh my god my cheeks were so clenched, and I knew if I went down he would face camp me and get 3k. I did not want that to happen and somehow pulled that spin out of my ass.
---
Learn how to evade early on. A lot of tricks that work in low levels can be used on high levels too, such as looping scrath marks, 360ing, and faking vaults. Once you get good at those, you will be able to progress up to about rank 10 or 9, where you have to perfect all your strats and have luck or your side.  Alternatively, as a killer, learn how to moonwalk, use pallets/windows to your advantage, and push survivors into corners.
---
Only ghostie
---
We had a match ?
---
Yesss. I wish it was as hard to rank up as it is for killers. My killer is rank 10 and if I don’t really try he will depip
---
“Every killer is ghost face” lmao
---
Windstorm should be base
---
Wow he must have had a hard match
---
Lol I I would’ve done this the trapper would’ve killed me
---
Yea sometimes but this clearly wasn’t the case
---
I’m so proud of you. You did it and you avenged every survivor that’s come across that type of Bubba! You’ve served your community well 😭
---
I can deal with getting morid but the dcing is so fucking garbage.
---
This mental image is bad enough, but now you’ve reminded me that in the movie “See No Evil” starring Glenn Jacobs (WWE’s Kane) Vince wanted there to be a scene where he jerks off and has a 16 inch dong. Everyone involved in the production refused this idea.
---
YOU PICKED THE WRONG KILLER SHACK FOOL!!!
---
I mean that's true but you shouldn't joke about disabilities
---
&gt; Did she intend for her tweet to be insulting? Of course.
---
Then I rest my case. Thanks for finally agreeing with me.
---
I like Bubba more tho...
---
Survivors make interesting choices sometimes. Like when they stop to pick up an item that you just Franklin'sed from them, and that slows them down enough for you to down them (thereby Franklin'sing the item again)
---
As someone with disabilities (not hard ones to have tho, but bad enough that people refuse to talk to me most of the time), I'm fine with jokes about disabilities as long as it isn't used as an insult.
---
PEACE AMONG WORLDS
---
That range is crazy, I love it
---
I get to red ranks every month just from playing. It sucks fucking fat chodes. I feel like the hotspots for eating shit at least as killer is from rank 20 to 15 with all fake yellow ranks and rank 7 to 1 with all the people who still care about piping. With the changes to rank reset I never leave the sweat zone so it fucking sucks. I dont want to pip but if I do well I will

Oh I thought it meant landing stagger recovery. I'm guessing it means weapon recovery?
---
It should certainly activate when you get grabbed from a locker. That’s not all just survivors trying to be toxic, that’s literally the only counter to being tunneled and slugged.
---
I'll say my current opinion atm for both killer and survivor. This is individually and not in terms of synergy. Also this is the top 5 but not in order of rank. 
---
Survivor:
---
**Spine chill**: 
---
\- Very useful against stealth killers
---
\- Get warning outside of most killers terror radius
---
\- increased healing, repairing, gate opening and vaulting speed
---
Pretty much just allows me to sneak away to a loop or hide before the killer gets to the gen.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**Bond:**
---
\- Gives you information on what you should be doing, whether you should go for the save, where team mates are on gens, if your team mate is suddenly injured then you know how near or far the killer is and you can see them being chased.
---
\- Helps you find team mates to heal them and get better altruism to rank up or for them to heal you
---
I believe this perk is pretty bad at level 1 though however.
---
**Borrowed time:**
---
\- Allows you to basically give a team mate invincibility against one hit if the killer is camping or tunneling
---
Pretty much it, 4 people running it makes it insanely strong imo.
---
**Sprint burst:**
---
\- Allows you to sprint away to a loop before even getting hit
---
\- Can 99% it and then use it at will
---
I would put Dead hard here but I find it too inconsistent based on ping etc.. Balanced could be an alternative but it's a little more situational and probably not as good since the nerf.
---
**Decisive strike:**
---
\-  Just having someone with this perk on the team can make the killer think you all have it
---
\- Gives you 60 seconds after unhook to make sure you can get a safe distance away and heal or do gens
---
\- Can get in a locker and force a grab or for the killer to have to waste time waiting you out
---
\- The fact it stuns the killer for 5 seconds is pretty strong, that's enough time to possibly lose them completely or at least find a good loop
---
\- If you have it left at the end of the game and the your team mates have powered the exit gate then you basically become invincible. There have been games where the killer has decided to camp for one kill and decisive strike was what made the difference between me escaping and being hooked again.
---
\- It just buys you time and wastes the killers time. Time being a precious commodity in this game.
---
Honourable mentions:
---
Iron will; Effective against spirit, can help you lose the killer far more easily.
---
Adrenaline: Strongest endgame perk; heal one state, speed boost, wake up from dream world, works when exhausted etc..
---
Inner strength: Bypass sloppy butcher and thanatophobia, heal quickly and without help also counters noed.
---
Deliverance and many more tbh.
---
**Killer:**
---
Honestly this list seems harder to me. it's impossible to choose so instead I will say the 5 I use the most
---
**Ruin:**
---
\- Strongest gen slow down perk
---
\- To some extent also counters people stacking on gens
---
Would be probably strongest in game if not for it being able to be cleansed in 0.0001 seconds
---
**Pop goes the weasel:**
---
\- 25 % regression to a gen and 60 seconds post hook to use it is no joke
---
\- Not only is it ding that 25% but by the time a survivor actually gets back to that gen it's probably regressed another 5% or so. They may even just give up on it entirely
---
**BBQ and chilli:**
---
\- Gives bonus blood points to get better perks and add ons at a faster rate
---
\- Gives valuable information on survivor's locations
---
Corrupt intervention:
---
\- Gives 2 minutes where there are only 4 gens survivors can work on. 
---
\- Is invaluable for getting early hooks and snowballing before gens pop.
---
**Devour hope:**
---
\- It is a gamble perk but when it works it is hands down the strongest in the game
---
Hell yeah I genuinely appreciate that. 😂 Also in case anyone was wondering the Nea also made it out the other door! RIP to the two survivors we lost. 🙏
---
I could be eating a glorious mountain of a sandwich filled with mustard, mayo, ham, and big booties and my finger will still click the ready up button with ease.
---
"oh. thank god thats over."
---
I mean, ignore what I said all you want, that doesn't mean you're right about what is or what isn't a mistake. Glad to know this whole conversation was a huge waste of time.
---
yeah but WHY
---
Yes and no, I've played my fair share but not as much as half the people on here who could explain it better but the best thing to do is play bother killer and survivor so you can learn both sides and just find your play style. I'd recommend watching a few "pain reliver" Dbd videos on YouTube he explains things and gives helpful tips ect
---
Even in halo people would crouch in place at each other. Even in l4d and plenty of other games.
---
The dbd fanbase are babies and take offense sll the time for some reason
---
I'm 100% certain his super natural crap was retcon long after the 3rd movie
---
Something multi-dimensional, which I think is a strength of the original killers.
---
Like the Huntress is a big burly feral woman who *also* hums a lullaby to look for a daughter she doesn't have. And the Nurse is a WWI medic nurse who *also* has a motif revolving around asphyxiation and strangulation
---
Whatever comes next, I really enjoy the Killers who have layers to their character and are more than just one single concept
---
Best bet would be a clean install of the game then I'd say.
---
Yeah, my hateful rants about the game fall under hitreg fucking me somehow or players. Other than that, I used to love playing Myers
---
Thank you!
---
even worse is that i play on console so i depip then have to wait 200 years for another game just to depip again 😔
---
Oni is just Shugoki but less thicc
---
UwU Works for PC and Mac! If you guys like this I will consider making more DBD characters. Please comment who you want to see next!
---

Someone had to do it thank you
---
I agree with the complaints thing but he doesn’t come across as arrogant. A lot of the time it seems like he wants to just start discussions (recent discussion with ortzdava being a good example) instead of people just blindly accepting x is good and y is bad.
---
EdgarAllenBro apologized but it didn't seem very genuine since he went on to keep defending himself as if he did nothing wrong. The original girl October deleted her tweet but doesn't give a shit, even making it worse by tweeting, "Okay you fucks the tweet is gone. May it live on forever in screenshots and memories 😩"
---
No problem. And if you need any tips on any of that, just let me know.  And just so you know I am a decent source i usually am around rank 7-4 when I play often.
---
That meme is dead now
---
They just need a casual mode. I tried playing with my brother for the first time last weekend and it was depressing. He's trying to learn the game and have fun, and because I'm ranked in the mid ranks were the try hard are it was, BBQ and Chili, Ruin, Hallowed Ground, and Eboni Moris left and right. It wasn't fun for us.
---
Feels bad man
---
youre right it's working fine, if you had revealed him even tho you could barely see him that wouldve been busted
---
Fuck naw
---
because he is not bad with addons, but without he is easy one of the botton 5
---
Yes, so even if all 3 survivors go on 3 different gens, they will each only get 1 gen done between the time the survivor is hooked and when they die. Now factor in the time it takes to locate more gens after that, plus the likely chance that the killer has ruin, and the time it takes to actually determine the killer is camping (especially if you’re not playing in coms with your team).
---
All 5 gens will not get done before the survivor is dead, even if they struggle til the end.
---
Will try this tomorrow. Thanks for the advice
---
What's up with everyone just shitting on True? Still haven't gotten an answer from anybody.
---
Yeah that was a nice buff, speaking of which her lullaby feels more echoey in the new patch
---
No problem!
---
She wasn't actually a fog whisperer but she is the girlfriend/wife (not sure which) of OhTofu, who is one. And another fog whisperer EdgarAllenBro was laughing about it.
---
She should have the normal killer speed (4.6 I think) but I don't know if that would make her too op
---
Incorrect. The stupid ass hate circlejerk over him is a joke though
---
No one escapes bing bong
---
Right
---
This... is accurate.
---
I don’t get behavior and then wanting consistency it should be nice to have variation, huntress could have 112% movement speed. Not everything has to be the same
---
We also bring unbreakable lol
---
Even If that was true, if you let it get to you then he succeeded.
---
This is the cutest thing i've ever seen.
---
1) What you said essentially is basically saying "Making jokes about autism is helping bringing awareness" 2) See my first edit about him blocking people 3) He keeps making excuses for himself and octobies still has not apologized.
---
Heard a rumor that calm spirit makes hooks shorter because you skip the scream before the timer starts
---
Wow, what a couple of cunts. Definitely avoid their streams.
---
Somebody went to college for this.
---
Pretty sure it was considering they let the killer down them when they were standing at the edge of escape and just messing around. Especially if they weren't toxic and any other point of the match.
---
Could we please get a where wolf killer!! That would make this game the best horror game out . Thank you!
---
100% agree. Although, after Oni came out on live servers, I had a little more faith in them. Killer came out fun, had a bit of a mechanical skill requirement, seems like most people liked him, etc.
---
That didn’t last long.
---
And yea, hopefully the feedback gets this entire situation fixed relatively quickly. I doubt it though.
---
yeah, unless the devs changed a meh perk, so it probably still works
---
I had that bug like 3 weeks ago, the killer couldn't pick me up so I had to dc, can't believe they haven't fixed it yet
---
Yeah, no. He's lethal during his power which is the point. Now hrd s joke so you got what you wanted.
---
Thank you future man
---
&gt; If people are going to bring up timed abilities, compare him to Myers
---
People are comparing him to hillbilly because hillbilly is 1 of the few killers where you can still compete with survivors playing optimally. 
---
Myers is not, he's fun and he can be good but kind most killers is still in the position where if youre up against a good team of survivors you'll just get your ruin blown up immediately and there'll be 3gens being worked on while you chase a person then by the time you hook that person 2 gens are done and the other 1 is 3/4 of the way done and they're on their way to unhook.  
---
If it's going to remain the way it is now then so be it but at least give the killers the tools to properly oppose it.  Freddy can still compete but he just copped a big nerf too. But as is against those really good teams we had nurse spirit hillbilly oni and freddy. And literally all of them but billy have been hit with major nerfs recently
---
I'd say he deserves the flick. Not having the flick makes him a worse billy because he still has to charge his power. Why play a killer that needs to charge his power when another killer with basically the same power doesnt have to charge it.
---
Those damn cows
---
this isnt dbd, the fuck?
---
Hook 3 in the basement. 
---
1 guy saves them all, but you are Bubba and down them all again. 
---
Get hit with 3 consecutive Decisive strikes.
---
Hook 1.
---
They Kobe. 
---
Down them again. 
---
DS.
---
It's a bit of a stretch to say he's really good but he's not as bad as most say
---
Show them Jeff and tell them it's Jesus.
---
1) That's fair I didn't word that properly, it was meant to be jokes about themselves. Like there are disabled comedians who make those jokes, to me that's their territory. Although I don't understand how you got "Making jokes about autism is helping bringing awareness" from what I said. Like the He I was talking about was the gentleman who was upset.
---
I’m starting to feel a little W o O z Y
---
Slugging should be a situational tactic, not common practice.
---
Really?! Omg I like his videos!! I should check, damn I’m so happy everyone loves your idea!!!!🔥🔥♥️
---
Seems awesome for if you are on vacation or something. Also a lot of people play phone games exclusively.
---
At least she’s self aware enough to call herself a trashcan person in her twitch bio.
---
I basically came to thinking recently.  Why use anyone but hillbilly.  Had enough of trappers ridiculous bugs that took an eternity to fix and killers that literally are not equipped to handle optimal survivor play.  
---
So fuck it.  I only use hillbilly now
---
What do I win?
---
what's wrong with him?
---
And all of that stuff was already gone
---
The game just get boring at that level. Every game is the same killers with the same perks.
---
Which is why I said he needs buffs
---
Like I said, info is better than speed for knowing where people are and stopping them. You can't use your speed to catch them of you cant find them. Id rather be slow and consistent to fast and inconsistent.
---
Nope
---
I'll take them too
---
Slug for a minute, come back if no one picks them up
---
You look like Alladin
---
No, please, I don't run self care or inner strength.
---
I have some survivors P3 50 all perks (Kate and Claudette). I prioritized killers first because each one is unique so I can play whatever killer build I want now which is really cool and helps with the dailies lol.
---
Survivor is gonna be much harder as there are more teachable perks to learn but I think on average a survivor bloodweb is cheaper than a killer bloodweb but don’t quote on me this.
---
Not really. He's just become "slightly less than Forever Freddy" but feel free to celebrate if it makes you happy.
---
Even though three out of my five mains for killer are licensed (and the only survivor I play is licensed), I love basically all of the designs of the original characters. Standouts are Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Huntress, Spirit, Plague and Oni.
---
From playing against and playing with it readhead's pinky finger is pretty broken too
---
Do people really hate Tru3 that much? Honestly if you don’t like him that’s fine, but why obsess over him then? I don’t like a lot of streamers but that doesn’t mean I obsess over them
---
Good luck but maxing out all survivors is gonna be much harder.
---
I want some sci-fi, we went all the way back with the plague when are we going to go far into the future?
---
Only 6 games, but 83% is a pretty high survivability rate. 70-85% is pretty common for everyone I know
---
Hello!
---
After seeing [this post](https://redd.it/e9o90b) on the frontpage I decided to get my stats up. These were recorded after last reset until today. I setup a [spreadsheet](https://i.imgur.com/3femhwu.png) saving what role, survivor/killer played, map, results, minor notes and date.
---
I’m not a fan of his content, but I don’t get the hate either
---
The realms are cold, dog. Like the entity says, we are blessed and cursed
---
[Here's my version of this :)](https://redd.it/e9wecu)
---
I think leather loop would be fine but infantry is absolutely broken. (But so is the Pink Mori and I know someone is gonna bring up the key but you have to finish several gens before that is usable.)
---
I agree. I think that a survivor taking their own life, or the life of another survivor, is a loophole. Because "dying/death" in the realm is only defined by whenever a survivor is killed by a killer or The Entity itself.
---
Nah any competent Oni could 180 easily
---
I’m so happy I could have been a part of it, but it really is all you! Your concept art is fantastic! Congrats!
---
Yeah it is generally a waste. But for me, I have 2 survivors P3 50 all perks and I play a lot and reach a million bloodpoints quite a lot so I need to use them somewhere so I decided to prestige the killers.
---
Very cool, thanks for the data.
---
Its deceit and no it shouldn’t be here but damn I never knew he played deceit.
---
Ya I was furious when this happened
---
I'm the same, not a fan of his content but I just don't understand, especially going to the lengths to call him mentally disabled
---
Damn I’m jealous. Survivor is much more didficult to max out than killer. That’s my next goal but I think it’ll take me months haha
---
Doubtful. He's a second-rate Billy now, and that's what survivors wanted. God forbid a killer that has to farm their power be strong. Nope. Every killer should be weak to basic ass looping with no way to outplay it. Sounds like a perfectly balanced, fun game.
---
the backstory is nothing but racist tropes and stereotypes strung together, the names sound Meso-American and not Native American, and idk how anyone could possibly conflate Native Americans and voodoo (which is African).
---
Omg yes that's absolutely brilliant
---
Prepare your anus.
---
A more accessible bad power is still a bad power. If oni finds a survivor in a spot where his power can't really handle trying to down someone he can't even turn it off. The way it works right now is Just a huge hassle for something that can potentially be a negative
---
Combined with multiple nerfs that kinda cancelled it out
---
The funniest part is that they're just re-skins of their regular clothes too. Might get Susie's cause I prefer her pink hair, but I don't wanna spend auric cells.
---
They should make it so the broken key cant open the hatch but in return has really good aura abilities when used with the other key addons imo. Like increased range or increased time or something
---
Aaaaaaand this is relevant how exactly?
---
Are you trying to *cancel* him or something?
---
It was tofu’s girlfriend not tofu, him and tofu actually agreed to move forward from everything but for whatever reason tofus girlfriend decided to be a total child and attack tru like that.
---
I survive maybe 20% of games. Maybe
---
Dont spread hate
---
Yeah, probably but I think Mr. OP should give it a shot regardless. If they really want to play the game, might as well try their hardest to get that privilege.
---
I disagree with the nurse basekit statement. I've seen many people cheer for this change as they felt that a killer shouldnt be as powerful without addons, it's like saying survivors shouldnt be able to escape without items it's ludicrous. To me on ps4 nurse has become worthless. Unless they unlock mouse/keyboard and optimise the damn game I dont see her getting better. I used to 4k a lot with her and then 2k sometimes with a 0 kill game happening once in a blue moon. Now because controller aiming isnt as accurate and fine tuned as M/KB my missed blinks get punished harder and I can't pressure survivors. I get 0 kills most of the time and 2 kills sometimes. 4 kills are almost nonexistant unless they were screwing around. Believe me, most survivors that went up against nurses are happy with her nerf even though it was unwarranted.
---
Because it's cheaper to just sell a bunch of infinite pixels than to deal with production, inventory, storage and distribution.
---
Agreed, hit rank 1 killer when Myers came out as a survivor main and never want to go back, I’m happy as a killer alt in the 8 to 12 range.
---
You can balance a killer assuming people will learn how to loop him if it is possible to loop him, and Oni is capable of being looped.
---
This is called 'balancing for the skill ceiling'; you can see issues with 'balancing for the skill floor' in Overwatch's Genji or pre-nerf Tracer, in which you could out-skill the Tracer/Genji but still get demolished, and a good Genji/Tracer could wipe your entire backline 1v3.
---
If you balance "for the people who don't know how to loop", people who do know how to loop will be overpowered, you have to balance a killer against the mechanics that exist. (Meaning if you're balancing them assuming no looping, you'd better remove looping).
---
"Balance Oni against survivors who can't loop" would be terrible, flat-out; looping is an acquired skill, and it's your fault if you don't acquire it.
---
Also they can indeed balance killers around perks that a majority of the players own (like Decisive Strike) or can unlock for free (like Unbreakable), they can assume players have an exhaustion perk (like Meg's Sprint Burst), that players will have a way to heal (Claudette's Self-Care, medkits, searching chests) or find others to heal them (Dwight's Bond) or otherwise have things that reward them with health states (Meg's Adrenaline) under certain conditions.
---
If someone buys a DLC and runs Iron Will and Inner Strength instead of Adrenaline and Self-Care, you're still essentially balancing for the survivor being able to perform an objective and heal.
---
And that's okay, you should balance around the types of perks survivors can run, and the presumption that **all survivors will have access to every free perk and may be running any combination of those free perks** as well as the assumption that **all survivors may be running any perk that has appeared in the Shrine, can appear in the Shrine, or can be learned from characters that can be bought with Iridescent Shards.**
---
You might not be able to balance specifically around "Meg with Dead Hard and Adrenaline and Iron Will and Quick And Quiet", but you can balance around "Survivor with a way to avoid the killer landing their attack (Dead Hard), a way to heal if they meet the conditions (Adrenaline) and two perks that aid them in evading the killer".

Self proving on this forum usually gets deleted by mods bro
---
Pig needs to be nerfed, 0% winrate
---
Between the trees on the right
---
Baby buffs first. Ptb oni was too strong but live oni is too weak. Potentially his power might need reworking with when it activates and cancels.
---
I mean tofu does try to start beef with tru3 quite often whenever he has a chance to(like when tru3 proposed ways to reduce toxicity) so I wouldn't be surprised if it was him
---
No, this is you and me “OUR” work, my friend! I couldn’t even imagine this amazing concert art without you! Hope BHVR think about this cosmetic very seriously. ♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
---
Baby buffs first. Ptb oni was too oppressive but live oni is hard to play. With more access to demon mode, we can see what needs tweaking from there
---
Yea... literally every dbd youtuber/streamer talks like this when they are not on camera.
---
Could have literally just looked at the rift and it’s right there, do not need to ask reddit.
---
you tunnel the shit out of people with legion then
---
Sorry that was my bad i thought you were talking about Edgar when you were talking about the jokes
---
I reached rank 4 survivor just because of the tome challenges and want to go back to 10-12 so bad
---
Yes. Exactly.
---
That pallet looks hella safe.
---
The devs need to balance for both. But they don't know how to, which is why the game is in the state that its in. Gens have not been touched, yet killers keep getting "adjusted". And if prior history is any indication, the developers will always choose survivor fun over killer fun. Since killer players only exist to enable survivors to have fun, right? And we are far less in number than survivors, so they have a built in impetus to keep them happy.
---
I really hope Predator: Hunting Grounds and the new Resident Evil multiplayer are good. Maybe competition will force the devs to take an actual look at proper game balance, because right now BVHR seems pretty complacent.
---
He has opinions on who the best killers are in his eyes. Said wraith is easily top 4 behind nurse, spirit, ghostface. Hes basicly getting shit because he has his own opinions and since hes a big streamer his opinions get out there. I dont understand why people are being assholes about it tho but i guess thats the community for you. He gets alot of shit for being mostly a killer main too.
---
Who is octobies? Never heard of her
---
An alien or cyborg would be super cool
---
It’d also be nice if disconnects counted toward challenge progression as
---
IKR. I’m pretty sure there’s more negative posts about Tru3 now than there ever were against AngryPug and Ochido back in the day
---
I'm about to start leveling the demogorgon.
---
I’m so pleased with everything that’s happened, I’ll be completely stunned if this becomes a real cosmetic! Thanks so much for sharing the glory!!!
---
This is really interesting, thank you for sharing! Also 83% win rate against leather face I could NEVER-
---
We don’t have the rank ones on console thankfully.
---
The all seeing.  Kindred, bond, windows of opportunity, and open handed.
---
*Cry in a indoor map*
---
What have I done?!
---
makes sense, but i dont know if its true.
---
At the end of the day, survivor gameplay is simplistic and killer gameplay is a stress simulator. No amount of tweaks is going to fix these fundamental issues because whenever they tweak something one way, it'll ruin the experience for others.
---
I'm just hoping Predator: Hunting Grounds is fun. Maybe a bigger studio can make an asyemmtrical game that actually feels asymmetrical. Instead of this unbalanced and shitty 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 situation we have on DBD.
---
Ah ok I'll have to buy him then
---
I don't really factor in any addons that are purple or pink into discussions of power because they're  inconsistent to get. You have to look at killers addons with a mindset of "I can consistently run at least a green or yellow if im putting BP in as I'm playing.". I put Iri King in the build because its his 2nd best addon but, manifestations or pallets will do just fine. Most people would prefer to run Iri heads and Belt playing Huntress to win, it's the same principle.
---
He used it as a joke, with a friend at that. It's not like he actually meant anything buy it.
---
I’ve been really inspired by the space suits in 2001: a Space Odyssey, perhaps a manic AI in such a suit would be a good fit?
---
That’s not how it works
---
Not really trying to do that legit looking for advice and the best way to get it is for people to watch gameplay and give feed back but thanks for the warnning
---
*Yes*
---
Don’t take Monto from me... I’m mourning the loss of EdgarAlanBro, I can’t take two cancellations in one day 🤧
---
And that’s on dbd luv
---
I disagree, I have played a lot of Hag, she has the 2nd best map pressence in the game behind Billy. While free info is nice, a similar effect can be had by just using whispers. I can see an argument for the other 7 killers though. Those other killers can capitalize on finding survivors better though.
---
I agree with tofu about tru3, Paulie Esther seems like an overly sensitive bitch.
---
 No one cares your son is retarded just like no one cares my brother’s autistic. It’s almost 2020 and people need to sack the fuck up.
---
We’re still not sure if there is one
---
I 99% agree with you.
---
&gt; The problem isn't whether a killer is viable or not, it's SWF having a major advantage that makes the weaker killers seem unviable. And that the ranking system is pretty fucked for killers so that makes killers unviable for those who base it on pipping as you said. 
---
I think this is the core issue. I bet if the pipping system reflected their verbiage around 2k as a balance point 99% of complaining would vanish, and all that would be left is the relatively minor annoyance of the 5% SWF teams being OP.
---
Care to insight me on how it does? Btw this shouldn't even be on this sub, it has nothing to do with DbD besides Monto
---
Forever just like last years

A slur is a slur, regardless who you say it to.

Then what is?

Awesome work! Would be cool to have and I would wear this irl
---
I feel like a lot of the items in the game, like this key, have been neglected. They need to be updated. They were made with the 2016 version of the game in mind. I was happy to see the medkit add ons get a redo recently.
---
Just make two hooks per person required for a mori, killing off one survivor after the first hook is so silly, especially if you have people playing stealth killers to avoid BT and camping hooks all day
---
the hell is this game anyway? Last year
---
Awww I'm gonna use this:)
---
Butt = clenched
---
Doesn't work with medkit...
---
&gt;s really good aura abilities when used with the other key addons imo. Like increased range or increased time or something
---
Exactly my point. A lot of items in this game were made with the 2016 version of the game in mind. These items haven't lasted as the game has aged.
---
Yes it is. Otz has made a video on it btw
---
I know when a Legion is doing a good job when every time I manage to just finish healing, they’re back to stab me again.

It’s called deceit or something
---
he still has the benefit of better tracking through blood orbs, so it's a trade off
---
I kind of agree with him with the ranking system. Every game in existence pretty much follows one rule with ranking: if you win you rank up, if you lose you rank down. 
---
The game doesn’t care if you 4k. It cares about you consistently end chases fast, defend your generators from being completed too fast, keep survivors injured, hook survivors multiple times, etc. 
---
Same is true for survivor. The game doesn’t care if you escape. It cares about you extending chases for as long as possible, doing generators, healing your team, unhooking you’re team, etc. 
---
Too many survivors are caught up in escaping and too many killers are caught up in 4k’ing every game.
---
Yup
---
Deceit, FreeToPlay on Steam.
---
I agree they needed to tone it down a little bit to give survivors who were in good positions a better chance. I just think they took it too far though, especially with the other nerfs to lunge distance, turn radius and his pallet break speed. His power just really isn't that good now, even when you catch people out of position.
---
There wasn't enough time to carry both off before they crawled out.
---
DS 100% works when the killer isn’t tunneling.
---
People like her think that killers exist to make fun for the survivors via getting looped for five gens.
---
Same things let you escape, gets you killed
---
My guess is it'll be changed one more time and made a bit less clunky. I doubt he'll still be S Tier like before but he'll be in a decent place at least.
---
The campfire cafe looks like a nice meet and greet for killers between matches!
---
I'd love to see q lego mommy Huntress
---
After a while the map becomes cluttered with orbs and tracking leaves the equatiin is it will lead you on ghist hunts.
---
This is fuckin great. She's probably like "Its so dumb and  bold that it may just work!"
---
It’s among the hardest maps for killer
---
I would love a killer like this personally but, 
---
Group therapy is OP
---
Darker maps arent going to happen (devs have said)
---
And high alert seems like a bad kindred
---
I find all these "I get red ranks w/o even trying, I barely do anything and get sacrificed and still pip up" don't realize they are in a minority of players who go on a subreddit, understand most of the mechanics, and probably play a lot.
---
A similar effect of a portion of his tracking can be done with whispers, but that's just his treatment. But, that's just a portion. Manifestations allow to see survivors no matter where they are in moderate intervals. You'd need Whispers, BBQ, Nurse's, and Discordance to get the same amount of tracking Doc gets with one addon and time, it's nuts. Not to mention the whispers would still be less consistent than the manifestations and screams within 32 meters. 
---
I prefer Doc's info to Hag's because survivors need to fuck up and fall in a trap to know where they are. Hag also needs to rearm those traps after they're used. After they get to Madness 2, Doc knows where they are, always. But considering that Hag can teleport to them if she's in range, I'd say it's up to opinion. Hag's still a better killer overall tho.
---
This is my new wallpaper thank you
---
no self promo please
---
A really edgy killer that doesn't suck shit like legion does
---
DBD On ps4 is fine for me. I bought every character except Quentin Kate and Tapp I would say some are worth more than others though
---
i leveled him up to 50 to start playing him with a "decent" build and after 2 hours he got nerfed i feel cursed lmao
---
God ghostface is broken
---
You don't win... But you do. Legion is weird.
---
ok billy
---
Nothing is going 2 happen, the dbd community could give less shits. Im sure edgar will give like, a twitter apology, but literally no one cares about someone saying that.
---
The dbd community just doesnt care, and thats really not a bad thing since cancel culture is just cancer in itself.
---
Cancelled out? The buffs outweigh the nerfs. I never really relied on getting easy stacks of STBFL or getting downs with his ability, which was the only thing that got nerfed, so to me the speed increase and new pins are amazing.
---
Monto is the new ninja
---
A lot of people say yes, personally I can’t stand the spam notifications every 8 seconds (find it more annoying then helpful) so I usually level it up.
---
Now with rank reset change you'll be in red ranks literally all the time
---
Not self promo like i said before legit trying to get advice
---
Yeah, I normally don’t pay attention to downvotes but there are some seriously salty survivors if they can’t handle BMing being called out for what it is.
---
So what did true do to October or tofu?
---
But i can see why it seems that way probably shouldve worded it better
---
In the developers native language they refer to her in the female tense.
---
And thus he became the Crapper
---
Literally only 2 secs to find him.
---
When you play against ghost face enough you know these things lol
---
This line of thinking puts killers in the role of "dungeon master" where they apparently have to make fun for survivors. News for you: killers are just players too. What is fun for a killer is usually the opposite of fun for a survivor.
---
Because shes an ass
---
Is he any fun?
---
Basically, someone recommended Hybridpanda and Tofu as non-toxic dbd content creators in response to Tru3’s tweet about Otz. Tru3 said that Hybrid seems like a nice chap, but he’s had bad experiences with Tofu.( I have no idea what these experiences are) Tofu rightfully got a bit peeved as this was admittedly rude of Tru3, especially given that despite whatever happened, Tofu has never really said anything bad about him. At least I think thats what prompted this. And then this response happened and...like....bruh.
---
Lmao survivor mains will never understand this. They just want us to be a nice killer and hook everybody 1 by 1 vs taking opportunities blatantly presented to us
---
It's because the emblem system is simply broken. You took too long to get your first down and 3 gens popped in the first minute(which WILL happen often in red ranks)? Enjoy your silver Gatekeeper. 
---
You picked Trapper or Plague, and play them to their strengths, herding survivors to traps and taking advantage of them being broken to end chases immediately? Chaser is also gonna be silver. 
---
This kind of bullshit means that some killers are way way easier to rank up with than others. For example Wraith and Legion are amazing for getting iridescent at Chaser, since you'll be getting one hit off(which counts as a successful chase), and then disengaging. On the contrary, Trapper, Hag and Plague will have a lot more trouble getting the necessary medals to pip.
---
I dont know, bought him and have not tried yet. I have watched some gameplay of him and it looks entertaining if you can get used to it
---
Damn that's sad I was planning on playing it soon :(
---
Wish we got rewards for ranking up, like bloodpoints or iridescent shards
---
Cahlaflour is the best Fog Whisperer and I’m really shocked that there aren’t more like her.
---
Dont be upset. Literally _everyone_ talks like that. i fucking promise you i know for a fact.
---
Super dope this is
---
Yeah, his ego is pretty big. True. But he never called someone mentally disabled for disagreeing with him.
---
So I think I'll stand with Tru3 on this.
---
You forgot 2 hour lobby times
---
wait thats illegal
---
Game breaking killer
---
Epic survivor main brain you have there 
---
Ur right. They should just make him the worst killer in the game
---
Haha stupid devs
---
There’s no such thing as gitting Gud at those loops. 
---
And any relatively smart survivor is gonna go to those loops and abuse them.
---
Thank you 💕 wish they didn’t though 😬
---
So then what is gonna be the benefit of a Mori? Literally the only use for it that i can see in your version is gonna be avoiding DS, and maybe shaving off some time that it would have taken you to get them to a hook. I'd much rather every Mori require you to have already hooked everyone once before you can use it.
---
F
---
Then what would be the point of demon mode? This is a terrible suggestion.
---
Can't use a key when you're in the dying state
---
They already nerfed the cooldown for demon charge so now it's just:
---
Don't get hit: easy just turn as soon as you see them charge
---
Make distance: do anything that forces him to cancel the charge 
---
And then you can just stay in a really tight area where his powers a liability and he actually cant even do anything about it because he can't even turn his power off. Then once it runs out you have plenty of time to make distance again because the cooldown when you exit oni form is huge
---
I like the detail how they made it 666
---
Imagine being this afraid of The Doctor 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Is this a pc thing? Im on xbox and my queue timed are only a couple of minutes
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the info! Been awhile since I've played console.
---
sounds about right. im rank 8 and the only game so far against an all red rank swf that I've played they all dc once they saw who i was playing because "noone wants to play against legion" and i depip'd down to rank 9 from it. was kinda annoyed as legion is by far my favorite killer.
---
I am on PC
---
Nobody is gonna feel sorry for a camping bubba.
---
Ranks 20-15 are absolutely horrible for queue times on killer side. If you can push past that you'll have much faster queues. And rank reset's coming on the 13th so you might as well wait until after that.
---
Ill take that this oppurtinity to repeat again i have NEVER gotten iridescent addon for Oni. They sound awesome. Been wanting one since ptb. Never got one
---
Dang. I'm not sure if my queue times are short or I just don't notice because I'm on my phone or I'm used to long queue times from overwatch
---
Doc's power is permanent info, it takes Discordance, Nurse's, BBG, and Whispers (plus their own prerequisites) to get close to the info Doc has with a single addon.
---
Doc's ability to prevent loops is tricky but, it's far from impossible. The tape allows you to hit the survivors from insane range and makes sure your shock has value. If you have good timing, Doc's slow down is nothing compared to the power a shock can give, you just shock, switch immediately to punishment, and get your free hit.  Even if you dont hit the shock, putting the shock and a good angle can make them loop improperly and you still get value. 
---
I didn't say Doc was some kind of sleeper, just better than people'd have you believe. On my tier list, I put him above Clown, Legion, Bubba, Pig, and Trapper. He's just about under Demo.
---
With the Wraith stuff. I'm not saying Wraith's crazy like Tru3 is. Tru3 shone a light on an under appreciated killer and showed their viability, that's what I want. Someone much more influential than some idiot with a keyboard that people have trust in to tell them that Doc is viable. 
---
The stopping bloodlust is an issue, if you find its too big of a hit, run PWYF, you keep stacks while shocking and it makes you shocks matter more because you stay fast as you charge them. Run it over BBQ, Doc already has built in BBQ, I just run if for bloodpoints.
---
The power of illusion pallets is that they make people go into more dead zone while they're already near nothing. True, pallets are a memory game but, besides pallets with good landmarks (shack, god loops) there's no way of know if the pallet was used or not if you didn't put it down yourself. 
---
Dedicated servers (from what I've seen and heard) do suck, right now. BHVR will make the lag better every update, slowly accidentally buffing Doc and slowly accidentally nerfing Huntress. Lag isn't a valid reason to say a killer is weak or strong. It's out of your control. Every killer is worse with lag the same as they're better against bad teams, it's not your fault that these things happen so you can't really put them into play while discussing power.
---
I'm at Rank 1 and using my power effectively. I say I haven't depiped in the post so that's a weird thing to put in. Yeah, he's an M1 killer, that's why I run STBFL. He gets really good use out of it while people still shocked because they have to just run. It makes up for the time loss that M1 killers tend to have. At 8 stacks, I've shocked at a window, hit the survivor, then hot them again immediately after because the shock gives them no options. 
---
I don't blame you for taking his power at face value. You don't play him, no one does. He's a hard killer to master the timing and use of info on. I take killers like Demo and Clown at face value because I don't play them. A Clown main would be able to open my eyes to things I didn't know you could do on Clown, you could do the same to me with your main. All I'm trying to do is let you see my favorite killer as a killer that really belongs in C, not F.  Sorry for the essay you just had to read, thank you for coming to my TED TALK.
---
Ah I dont really watch him I just kind of saw it on a couple of my killers and got confused
---
There used to be a bug where Freddy constantly swinging would move way faster than survivors. I had a couple fun meme games where someone would be his little shoulder-slug for a while and let him chase after survivors swinging like a madman.
---
That word was actually a pretty main stream insult for years upon years, it's ingrained pretty deep into a lot of peoples vocabularies at this point so it's not unsurprising that it would slip out when you're drunk and not able to pay as much attention to what you're saying.
---
Don't drink and stream kiddos.
---
I fucking suck at this game and will end up at rank 1 if I decide to play it regularly.
---
you actually think that should’ve hit?
---
I am not talking about his powers mentioned in post 3. I am talking about his movie 1 (cannon) powers. He was able to survive a point-blank bullet to her head, and the vanish. He was able to lift one’s guy while body and impale him on the knife. Not Superhuman-kind-of-strong, but too strong for a real human, and too durable.
---
1) dead hard
---
2)drop shack pallet and hippity hop over the trap in the door way
---
If everything is blocked you aren't completely screwed
---
No he didn’t. In this match they had a random whose scream happened to be slightly high pitched, it was directed at him.
---
First time I seen this spongebob scene as a meme, well done
---
It's simply far easier to reach red ranks as survivor than killer, so there are lots more survivors queuing than killers, because of this killers get fast queues and survivors get slow ones. The opposite effect happens in low ranks.
---
Legion is so fun to parkour with, he and Ghostface are my favourites. I used to play pig before them so I guess I’m into playing a with survivor like movements but with a stabby twist.
---
this is so cool!
---
There shouldn’t be a benefit to a Mori in the first place. It should just be there as a gimmic. It literally ruins the game for killers and survivors by speeding up the game
---
I mean I still kinda am. Game limitations nerf Bill big time. Realistically Bill wouldn't be doing gens. Hed make on the spot weapons give them to the other survivors and set up traps/ambushes for the Killer. Suzie can't do shit when Kate, Bill, Jeff, and Ace are all beating her with Rusty pipes. Same with Myers and the like. Myers gets staggered being stabbed in the eye. Imagine if people were beating him non stop while one person grabbed his knife and decapitated him.
---
Where do the people who DC fall into this?
---
Dunno, i personally climbed to red playing nothing but Pig and Freddy, and i think these 2 are pretty alright to pip with.
---
Good drawing! Are you going to color it?
---
Theme is missing an E. Hang me.
---
It’s called growing up. Try a different game for a bit and come back later.
---
Decisive strike takes up a perk slot, and its used to counter an action that doesn’t take up a perk slot. Killers can counter that perk with yet another action that doesn’t take up a perk slot. But! Survivors can just take up ANOTHER perk slot to counter it. Wow. Two perks needed to counter something that’s absolutely free. Your logic sucks. Why is it not an option to just not tunnel? The only time I’ve ever used decisive strike is when I’ve been tunneled. It’s what it does. If you get hit with decisive strike, you tunneled. Deal with it.
---
Satisfying asmr
---
With the color of the fluid in that jar you might want to see a doctor.
---
i cant even find red rank killers on xbox. most of the time its purple rank killers.
---
this is why Hatch interrupts should still be a thing
---
i personally prefer tier 3 discordance because there’s not a lot of times in which the survivors just stop working on the gen when i’m not nearby. i like how it gives you more time to see it as well especially if you’re in a chase.
---
That’s what I came here to do. Take my upvote.
---
Whatever floats ur goat
---
Yeah you right. I even noticed Killers at rank 20 (in my smurf) with a build so nasty &amp; sweaty that I can’t believe those Killers are rank 20.
---
I want to believe that they don’t stand a chance against red survivors and derank to bully the new ones. Bc there are some toxic people in this game, including Killers.
---
Even so, he still used it as a joke. And from what I'm shown here the person didn't take offense to it.
---
Yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing. I think when I played Paladins and Apex every night in the summer it started pushing me away from DBD.  Trust me, I’ve taken a break and that’s why I’m starting to feel bad because I’m still not excited to bounce back.  Fr*ck
---
Survivors also have access to things that can also speed up the game, Toolboxes and Keys. Moris are indeed unbalanced in their current state, but i think there is a place for them in the game. If they were changed to no longer promote tunneling, they'd be in an alright spot.
---
YEET
---
He said himself that wraith's basic bell is shit and you needed add-ons for it to be good. But he did say you don't need the ultra rare add-ons to be good and proved it by still getting a 4k every match with yellow add-ons.
---
Yeah I'm definitely getting a cosmetic for Yui as well. I just finished getting Oni to P3 50 so shes next in line :).
---
Wow, but it was on stream? If it was, send me the link pls:)
---
I fully agree and hate teabagging. But in this scenario it seems she was clearly goofing around. There's no way she actually thought she was going to make it out after that first hit.
---
Just because there’s other bullshit in the game doesn’t mean we have to leave everything else as is. A mori should just be to kill on their death hook and that’s it nothing else. Anything else is unbalanced and unfun
---
I don’t know if you want to see it maybe
---
the entity really does not want you escaping rn
---
It’s not okay to use slurs because of “jokes”
---
There are fog whisperers that DC every other game.
---
Very suprised BHVR keeps them.
---
Cahla, Streamdad, and Bahroo are what the community is, imho. Everyone else is just noise o/
---
You gotta absord to keep your strength up man
---
*crickets*
---
Oopsy is just unnerving presence, isn't it
---
it’s not a matter of cleansing or not cleansing 
---
cleanse smart that’s the way to go
---
the middle
---
Generally I don't, because it gives her a free, massive, power up. But it also depends on the skill level of the Plague.

Swf queues have been busted before that that change
---
I had someone do that against me three times in a row. I actually got mad at him in post game chat asking why the hell did you keep going into the same exact locker three times. He said he didn't think I would check it a 3rd time lol.
---
It depends if you want to be heard or not I think
---
Ik I’ve been getting blood points with my wraith and billy
---
I think I had 1 from watching that.
---
I80°s are gone
---
Totally depends on the situation. Obviously don't cleanse right away everytime but when you do make sure you cleanse on the opposite side of where she is running or where all gens are repaired. I usually also cleanse when i'm on my last life.
---
His flick got nerfed. And his flick was what made him so good. At least on PC.
---
You're wrong. His 180 flick got nerfed too. So now he's pretty shit at jungle gyms.
---
Nice way to put it
---
They were slow but they werent 5 minutes slow. It all started happening around a month ago when they made the change to swf lobbies.
---
Always taken years for me at least
---
I believe you shouldn’t cleanse as once they get you all to the sick state their power is useless. Meaning if you are good enough you can just loop her while others do the gens. This makes apples that much stronger though. If you feel the need to cleanse I recommend you do it after a couple gens have been completed and use the fountains there so she wastes her time walking I like to wait for when the exit gates are powered myself, then cleansing on the opposite end of the map.
---
Agreed. I was pretty bad at looping, but i've improved a lot by seeing what the survivors i'm versing are doing against me.
---
The killer bias is alarming.
---
How doing cocaine feels like
---
"Not tunnelling" refers to "Not chasing and Downing survivors." It's the killer's objective. Not doing it is not a reasonable option. 
---
Imagine killers had a perk that downs survivors the moment they touch a generator. Survivors would rightly complain. The killers then respond to these complaints by saying survivors just shouldnt work on gens. Bullshit, right? Yet here you are, saying "just let the survivors go lol" 
---
I'm not saying Decisive Strike should be deleted. I'm saying it should be counterable in a reasonable way. Slugging them and letting them have a chance to get healed is reasonable. Letting them go for the price of a skill check is not.
---
I agree, I’ve stopped using ds and I realized I play better without it, not using it broke bad habits. Now that I don’t rely on it, I’ve become better with mind games and looping, of course part of that was time played, but you get the gist.
---
Jund never “put him in his place” with that video. Funny with Jund too, many times he acts like hes so good and mentions how killer is braindead and so easy then when hes getting pounded on stream by survivors suddenly hes going on about how theres nothing he can do due to killer/map etc
---
In a perfect world I’d tell you to take off BBQ and replace it for either Thrilling Tremors or Sloppy Butcher. Thrilling Tremors + Pop Goes the Weasel and A Nurse’s Calling + Sloppy Butcher are both amazing combos. But since you’re new I’d recommend just keeping BBQ on since the bloodpoint grind is a long one. Honestly, don’t worry about your build too much. What you have is fine. Optimal builds only start to come into play when you get to the higher ranks. Focus more on learning and mastering your killer and you’ll be able to win with any build you put on.
---
Basically this. Like if you want to cleanse because you're on death hook, go do it near a completed gen or a dead zone. Somewhere where the Plague has to go out of her way to get it. That gives everyone else more gen time or more time to hide, and wastes a bit of her power as she walks back and tries to find people again.
---
Idk why they decided to nerf him, he was literally fine, aside from on console where he was just slower Billy who could be juked easily.
---
Now, he's that but on every platform. Ffs, maybe he didn't need to turn 90 degrees, but this nerf is the dumbest shit I've seen in a while. I guess BHVR just wants everybody to run Spirit Billy and Nurse till the game dies.
---
I’m on pc and it takes me 20 minutes half the time
---
Super cool, keep up the good work
---
Whoa whoa kazan it's rin chill chill.
---
most toxic swf are in this rank
---
And then she notices
---
I used to be a Tru3 fan but he really has become whiny and bitter lately. He says he wants discussion but just watch his stream and he puts down anyone who disagrees with him in his chat and tells them “if you think that you’re wrong” and thats the end of the debate for him everytime. He needs to look at his own behaviour.
---
That said he’s bang on the money about the dbd streamer clique. Not surprised they all come running to each others aid. Todu is always in the thick of it.
---
Good
---
Thats hot
---
Yea it gets a lot harder to pip in red ranks (especially rank 2 ) but it's kinda hard to depip , even in red ranks .
---
Exactly, red ranks are good enough to punish you for it, while lower ranks just get mad. 
---
Personally Im blind as shit, specifically in dark games, so after I cant usually find both people and end up only finding the injured people after unhooks. Back in rank 10 even I was called a tunneler every match, but in rank 1 I get gen rushed with only 2 hooks, camp to secure the kill and get nothing but ggs. Its much harder in red ranks but everyone understands your pain
---
What the original say?
---
Don't cleanse. One person cleanses, and it's a domino effect.
---
You are saying not to "balance a killer assuming that everyone knows how to loop", if you're not assuming that know how to loop, you are balancing for them not knowing how to loop, it's binary.
---
I think you need English lessons, you don't want anyone balancing Oni to assume survivors can loop Oni or even know HOW to loop Oni.
---
But then you say you're not saying that, but it's right there; you don't want anyone, *anyone* who is balancing the killer to assume the survivors know how to loop the killer.
---
If they don't assume that, then what is there? You either loop or you can't.
---
Like I said, go take some English classes, get up to college level (might take you a few years, considering your current state) and then come back.
---
not my most successful post but definitely my most needed one
---
Wow its almost as if theres a killer thats  power is  also a coinflip.
---
a lot of people will play crazy ballsy if the have ds up, especially in lower ranks, bodyblocking and going for crazy plays and stuff
---
Legion idk he has discordance and I think he is more fun to play but demo is fun too
---
yeah. you get much faster queue times once you hit purple. i was sitting in almost 20 minute queues at 18-15 but at purple its almost instant
---
I also posted the sketch if you all want to see it
---
I think you did a really great job!
---
Thanks
---
How do I use it? Or download it?  :(
---
Omg best comment
---
Bad nerf then. Make the ability harder to get rather then nerfing the ability that makes the oni fun.
---
You can blame the troll with friends for that one.   Asshole teams would purposely stack a 15 alt in their group to be jackasses to killers.
---
When consoles can’t turn past 40 degrees while pc can turn about 90 degrees so you just make both not be able to turn passed 40 degrees
---
I mean you’re not wrong in any sense and I hadn’t even thought about maybe running resilience prove thyself and adrenaline because end game you are kinda guaranteed that heal as long as you don’t 3 gen yourself. I play usually at least with 1 person so it’s pretty viable in the sense of doing gens if you need that heal so I’m gonna give it another go and play a few more games with it than I tbh want to but I’ll see if it’s as clutch as ppl say it is.
---
I didn’t level up Jake because before a bit ago- I didn’t even realize it was a perk because nobody talks about it but I can see how it could be a high tier survivor perk.
---
Thanks again for all the info. It’s cool to see a different perspective on a lot of different perks and builds and pretty helpful, have a g night man.
---
The best part is she probably hid all game and did nothing
---
Protection hits have a shorter cooldown, yes.
---
And if you're within 10 meters distance of an **injured survivor** (per the Mettle of Man entry for what counts as a protection hit), any negative change in YOUR health state seems to count as a protection hit.
---
Healthy to injured, healthy to dying, injured to trapped, injured to deep wound, etc.
---
Demo is much better though
---
honestly i think there shouldn't be perks that are designed specifically to counter certain killers. like of course some perks will work far better or worse depending on the killer (like spinechill cucking stealth killers). but slippery meat for example always seemed like bad design
---
Really though? I used to think that until I started finding myself in the same situation as op here. I think at this point I'd rather wait 10 minutes for a fun balanced game than party 2 ridiculously unbalanced games where I get stomped and I'm lucky to get two hooks.
---
And fill your early death from a Mori for being mistaken by the killer as a dull/skeleton key in the lobby.

Posting that and then deleting it shows she's not as bold as she thought she was.
---
And in general, because he has to collect his traps each time he wants them, instead of getting to reset them without collecting them/having them update their position as he places more.
---
minecraft nostalgia
---
I fully agree with you. I reached Rank 10 last week and have been getting mashed up against red ranks and getting totally stumped. I just spent the last 2 hours deranking myself to 13 so that I'll get reset to 17 tomorrow on rank reset.
---
That's how I feel about almost every Christmas sweater then made. Like let me buy myself Feng's or Bill's Christmas sweater already
---
The entity is a magma cube
---
Oh shit son, guess I have to actually get good at killer now.
---
When on PC, I suppose you could open in new tab and save as from there. If on phone, tap on it and then check the top right to select save. Then, dial a random number and say WHAZAAAAAP
---
On the hook
---
The ranking system is indeed broken. I hit Rank 1 by pipping every game, even if I die all the time. The thing is, that still feels like shit.
---
I did kinda forget about how ranks reset tomorrow but I figured that there should be people at all ranks but I guess I was wrong.  Anyways I realise this is a temporary problem so I can just wait
---
ur breaking my immersion
---
Ah shit you're right. The T names tripped me up.
---
To fix queue times there needs to be more red rank killers
---
The wraith.... next!
---
When you had a hard day at work so you sit back and relax looking at all the people you hate
---
This shit is why i wish playing as both roles was mandatory. If the people running blendettes with keys and toolboxes and then tbagging you were forced to face the same bullshit themselves, you bet your ass they'd be way less likely to behave like that in the future.
---
Ruin sloppy butcher thanataphobia and nurses calling. Watch truetalent on youtube. Hes a really good player in general but he has started a ghost face movement over the past few months with an interesting playstyle. He doesnt use his stalk almost at all and focuses on keeping everyone injured and playing with his 0 terror radius to catch people off guard.
---
He even nods at you 😂😂
---
Fuck corn maps
---
I don’t mind red ranks for survivor but for killer hell no lol if I get close to red rank for killer I stop playing lmao bc i get tilted too easily
---
Repairing 2 generators fully and rescuing + heal 1 person seem to be enough to pip once, so it's really hard to lower your rank.
---
Behavior did balance for survivors who didn’t know how to counter a killer before you want to know what happened, they nerfed Freddy the (at the time)weakest killer in the game
---
This pleases the ghostie boy
---
I copy pasted into my notes tbh if that’s fine cause this seems like it would be a blast sometime if I get a fourth and even just for builds you posted a few good ones so I’m glad you took the time again to write in full and not skip anything. I pretty much only play swf and we like to have fun so know this list will go to good use in the future :) thanks again the more I know the more confident an cocky I get and the more I just enjoy playing because I feel a lot more aware. Have a dope night man really appreciate it.
---
I think it’s cuz with killers you are more of the deciding factor in the game (Don’t have to rely on a random teammate)
---
While if your solo queuing as survivor all it takes is one dc / one bad teammate / or a mori and you can’t control that
---
That’s why I think they should implement something to combat a one sided games (4 survivor escapes / 4K with killer)
---
Maybe gen speed is related to the amount of survivors left (4 survivors slower/ 3 survivors normal / 2 survivors faster)
---
Kind of like how endgame collapse timer slows down when survivors are in dying state or on a hook
---
This also helps average games out so both killers and survivors can clutch (they always still have a chance)
---
Something to make the game more intense and close instead of “oh someone dc the game is already over”.
---
Why I stopped playing survivor. I am not a sweaty killer main
---
I missed so many times in a row. It was a living nightmare paired with the lag. Also, I think they were friends bc they were very coordinated. It was a terrible game 😂
---
Idk about fucking spirit
---
I mean, one, she's a corpse, that's gross
---
Two, there's a katana inside of her, you might slice your dick
---
And three, she died in high school, so, depending on your country, she's probably under age
---
I believe the Christmas outfits are in the store forever. I'm wondering if they will have another outfit sale around Christmas like they did for black Friday. If they do I'm gonna likely buy more outfits lol.
---
For real. I've had ruin down and two gens done before first survivor even gets hit. They still dc'ed.
---
For BHVR, this is a Thursday. You're surprised?
---
Ok good to know thank you! And I’m considering waiting for Christmas to see but I did the math and I only need $5 to get all the things I want so now I kinda just wanna do it this weekend lol. We’ll see!
---
I'll get so close to rank 3 and then people will DC and not give me a pip and I'll get deranked after 5 games which is complete bullshit
---
Yui?
---
ooooOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
---
Oh this is fun! I’ll do that as well, starting today!
---
I mean you may not want to hear this, but offerings help.
---
Different game
---
cleanse far away from her &amp; other objectives. 
---
it’s the best of both worlds. by the time she travels all the way there to collect her power she won’t have enough time to actually use it.
---
Ideally people would just leave each other alone if they don't have nice things to say. I don't know why so much drama happens on twitter to begin with. Like I've said in other comments, I think she should make an actual apology, and I won't judge her entire character off of one incident. Oh well. Reddit's already decided I'm wrong.
---
I mean this is coming from the guy who completely went off topic 3 times and then made crazy rambles about his own assumptions. So, yeah sure I am the one who needs help. Maybe when you figure out what's actually wrong with you, let me know.
---
That was way too deep man lol
---
Cause sometimes getting a problematic gen done fast is really important. 
---
If it's very unsafe and adjacent to two other gens, it's probably better to do that faster than so 3 gens slower but more efficiently.
---
When you play ghost face enough to notice these things
---
Keep me updated if you receive your order or what ends up happening
---
underrated comment he’s so crippled w/o it
---
Well, as long as she won't make an actual apology and only says things like "alright, i deleted the tweet you fucks" i doubt anyone against her will stop judging her all of a sudden.
---
People die when they are killed.
---
Ive been playing killer red ranks for the first time in years, and Ive noticed a lack of toxicity, dcing, and accusations than in purple ranks and below. I have no idea how you guys can have such a different experience than me. I dont even remember a dc in red ranks so far
---
Unfollowing, unsubscribing, whatever. I don’t care about damaging her income, calm down.
---
I hope to be that one day lol
---
Actually, I've found that broken keys are a great pairing with Blood amber and Prayer beads. Used sparingly and quickly, you can sneak around most killers if you're observant enough.
---
Even though there are plenty of absolute madlads in GC playing on m&amp;k, I don't believe a single dedicated keyboard player has ever participated in RLCS
---
But then it's less fun in another way, where the killer feels like their power is taking far too long to charge
---
Just a comment of appreciation for your mentality. Good job, thank you and good luck with that stupid challenge.
---
omg thats adorable, i'd love to see a plague one!
---
I cant get past purple ranks cuz the queue is TOO LONG
---
Brand new part on ghostface must be op
---
Improvise and adapt...
---
How would she see her own head?
---
Tried to hide from Meyers, he found me, body blocked me for the rest of the match while the other survivors finished gens and then when all other survivors left, the trap door spawned right underneath me. Definitely the most ridiculous escape I have ever had lol.
---
My boi shugoki out here slaping these bois
---
I’ve lost many a teammates to Bubbas basement.
---
i just dropped from 8 to 10 cuz every game has been against 4 red ranks that instantly got my ruin and stayed on gens permanently, but atleast i got to actually play the game
---
Dwight/Bill/Ace
---
Behind the tree
---
Yup. DC's everywhere. I've lost so many pips because the killer committed to a 3 min chase and then thought "fuck it" or teammates who didn't pay attention and got fucked in 4 seconds. Git gud and stop being crybabies.
---
D Strike
---
Iron Will
---
Adreneline
---
Dead hard
---
Spine chill.
---
This is normal
---
but then that would just make the game really hard for killers without ebony moris. Maybe the mori could cause the gens to go faster with less survivors? Like "in the face of brutal slaughter at the hands of the killer, you are determined to make it out alive." Just to make it fair. Maybe then a key would cancel that benefit out and a key on its own would increase sacrifice progress. "The Entity doesn't want you to escape so easily" or something like that.
---
I keep seeing this. It's so unfair and we can't know what we verse.
---
The spirit vid tru3 made is a joke. Like seriously just walk away from the loop 4head and give her a free hit since she moves x2 faster than you do
---
Scott doesn't say killer is braindead at all, he might say ormond, cowshed and thompson house is braindead since its actually stupidly survivor sided. Scott uses just ruin and crossmaps people on huntress, tru3 is a basic bitch relying on pop to win games.
---
The only thing unique to tru3 is his boring builds and ghostface thanat build where he switches targets, which im not saying is good, and his new wraith build - which is performing good.
---
can list u zubat, ryanpez and umbra that are all more skilled at killer. Tofu probably fighting zubat for the top spot of best killer
---
Perks: Legion. Cuteness: Demo. Ability: up to you.
---
That poor trapper
---
I too am just here to say I appreciate you not hook camping. It took me forever to finish it as well because I play killer how I’d like to go against a killer so using noed and hoeing ppl is rough for me. good luck
---
You telling me he wasnt in the center though?
---
I think I found the cause of "6 rank rule" not working.
---
Most of the time, yellow ranks gets paired with red ranks after killer dodges
---
My theory:
---
6 rank rule is being set by the killer.
---
1. Game made a lobby: three rank 3 survivors and a rank 5 one vs a rank 9 killer
---
2. rank 9 killer leaves
---
3. lobby still looks within "6 ranks around rank 9" and finds a rank 14 killer
---
Only problem with that is I’m very impatient lol! I love both sweaters, I play Susie though (obviously) so that’s the one I prefer, Joe’s sweater is super cute too though.
---
It's so annoying when survivors blame the killer when THEY are the ones having an off day in the game. We all have crappy game plays. And you're right, the game is meant to be played out of enjoyment. If it stresses someone out, don't play. I hear coloring helps ease tension 😜
---
As a survivor main myself, I just want us all to have fun. The last game I played, we all could've gotten out, but I know how aggravating it is for the killer. I knew I'd done enough to not depip, so I gave him a chance to catch me. It was my last hook, so it was over pretty fast.
---
After all, the game doesn't determine success in our life. It's just a hobby! So let's enjoy it! 😻
---
Change your play style to be more conscientious of others. I am mid-ranks and I can not do more than safety pip because of my play style. 
---
For me? My goal is to make sure one person gets out, and that person is never me. Take protection hits, unhook people, play lookout for other survivors, take the heat off of people getting tunneled. Basically, I play babysitter so I can make sure other people learn and enjoy the game. 
---
I safety pip every time, but I don't rank up with three silver and an irridecent.
---
Yep, and you usually learn a lot from playing against those players too. Like which loops are not worth chasing someone around, and when you need to peel away to stop a gen. Red ranks are so good at just working on a generator right next to you while you chase someone else. Then when you go for them they just switch. Its so dirty lol. I main huntress and you can always tell when you go against someone that is REALLY good at stalling you for a long time.
---
It was probably of the drama as well that her boldness couldn't take
---
Killer with locker perks wait gg
---
Edgar gave a shit apology where he pretty much called anyone who got offended a pussy.
---
I dropped all the way to 17 and I can't get a match been like that for a while now. I just wanna play oni
---
Again, it's not the killer's job to ignore you because your teammate unhooked you in front of him. If I were in your shoes I agree it wouldn't feel good, but it's unrealistic to _expect_ the killer to not capitalize on the survivor's mistakes just because you'll suffer for someone else's mistake. That's all the killer does, capitalize on mistakes. That's the game.
---
That said, I would still totally get disconnecting in that situation, even if only because your teammate is clearly more interested in getting BPs for himself than actually playing smart and cooperatively.
---
Claudette buffs op plz nerf.
---
This is very cute but at least say you need to pay for this even if it's a dollar.
---
I was rank 8 and it's dropped to 17 now.been having this issue for some time
---
Myers on break before the next 4 survivors show up.
---
Oh look, ghost face shared another succesful Mori.
---
He's always been kind of an ass. Never played a game with or against him where he didn't feel the need to be passive aggressive or pissy in post game.
---
I miss the old days :(
---
Plague mains: *nervous sweating*
---
Ah my mistake, in this video i was using the upper right corner like a moron haha, thanks mate ill work on it.
---
I need wine 🍷
---
The more you practice, the more the game will change and the more you'll enjoy it. The best advice will come from people who play BOTH sides, not solely one or the other. Watch videos, read through this sub, but most of all make sure you're getting CURRENT info on characters. Many of them have been re-worked from even a few months ago.
---
I didn't say it wasn't used as an insult, just that if it was used as a joke that I would be fine with it.
---
Tried to hide from Meyers in a corner, he found me and body blocked me the rest of the match. My teammates finished gens and escaped then the trap door spawned right under me..craziest escape and had to take a screenshot.
---
Do not! Please, do not! You cleanse during/before end game at far from the gates fountains.
---
Gen rushing is basically when the survivors do all the gens in like 5 minutes
---
Fair, I'm the same way. Luckily I had a enough saved from the rift pass.
---
So I haven't played Oni since the nerf (wanted to take a break after all the buggy bullshit) but while I never though he was OP while I was playing against him and still don't, I seriously think he's the farthest thing from skill-based characters.
---
When out of his Demon Form, he legit does not have a power. He's a basic m1 killer, and the only knowledge it takes to use him at that point is that of any other basic killer. The duration of a chase weighs far more heavily on the skill of the survivor than it does on the killer at this point. He hardly takes any skill during this point, because he literally doesn't do anything. 
---
Then he injures someone, and he can suddenly track exactly where they go. This even takes away what other "m1 killers" have to do at the very least. 
---
On top of that...Oni can't even make any "choices" that might take game knowledge or a willingness to weigh the chances of taking a risk. Because he literally doesn't have  a power. He can't be like Pig and decide if she wants to try using Ambush at a loop to potentially cut it short at the expense of potentially failing and delaying her down. He can't be like Myers and make the choice of going for a t3 down or just a regular m1 down and 99ing t3 for later, or even choosing to stay in stealth for a while. He can't be like Trapper and try to bait survivors into certain locations to potentially get a faster down.
---
There's no potential for a faster down outside of just the regular m1 killer mind-games or whatever. 
---
And then you finally get your Demon Form. And there's almost nothing a survivor can do. The flick wasn't difficult, and the amount of steering power (IDK if this was a bug maybe?? I thought I saw a bug about turning in the patch notes) means it takes almost no skill to hit. You can't be looped just due to sheer speed. You break pallets super quickly, so it's a waste if the survivor drops it. The range of the hit is bigger and also AoE so you can't have  a teammate body block. You can hardly dodge it. A survivor can hardly do anything other than afk stealth, which is a basic universal mechanic against every killer. The duration of the chase weighs almost entirely on the killer player, which little for the survivor to do.
---
At the beginning of the game, Oni has to use extremely basic skills that anyone playing killer should know. Once he gets his power (which he has very little influence over because the duration of a chase is almost entirely in the survivors' hands before he gets his power), survivors have to resort to...extremely basic skills that anyone playing survivor should know because he's too strong in a chase (survivors have very little influence over the duration of a chase because for a time being, the duration is almost entirely in the killer's hands). 
---
There's like no point/situation where a killer's exemplary game knowledge or mechanical skill really helps them take advantage of Oni, and there's really not a single time in a match where a survivor really has a chance to make daring plays to outmaneuver or juke or mindgame Oni, especially not in a way that's different from any other killer. Simple loops/mindgames at first, then stealth. 
---
I actually think he was kind of shit because if all 4 survivors were competent, Oni could hardly compete, and I think part of that is because you can't really be skillful from him because whether you get your power at all is heavily dependent on the survivor mistakes.
---
That’s what good hole sounds like
---
My post was never a competition about who was the better player, I couldn’t care less.
---
My point was that Jund has openly said how easy killer is before but changes his tune once he comes across a hard team. Just feels like he’s trying to gloat sometimes.
---
Also tru3 does ok against Spirit. I do ok against Spirit. Junds scenario where spirit plays perfectly everytime and requires zero skill.....it just doesn’t happen like that. Hell Spirit isn’t even the hardest killer to go against.
---
On a side note, zubat is overrated. Maybe its the fact hes in a different region but he seems to get more potato survivors than your average EU streamer. I watch videos of his from time to time and it seems to be consistent that the survivors are less sweaty. Now im now saying ALL games before you post a one off video and cry im wrong, im just saying in general on EU servers the survivors are often more consistently good.

---
I mean look at Steam, only 5.9% of players have hit Rank 10 as Killer across the entire platform.
---
Dead by Daylight matchmaking (supposedly, according to one of the changes, but I don't have a dev post handy) prefers to match players within 6 ranks of each other, and only after it fails to match you with someone within 6 ranks, does it expand the matchmaking.
---
Also ranks 16 to 20 supposedly don't count for the 6-rank preference just to get them into a game ASAP and promote their engagement as new players.
---
Basically if you hit purple ranks, you're a preference for those rank 2-4 survivors and you get into games faster, because you have priority for matchmaking over nearly 95% of the entire established killer player base.
---
Of course games as killer against red rank survivors suck, but anyway, hit rank 8 killer and you should be fine.
---
Keys seem alright to me considering you need to complete several generators to open hatch. At the very least 3 that’s a lot longer than it will take for a killer to hook and down a survivor once. DS is kinda broken ngl.
---
No it’s 9k shards or 500 cells or but from steam store
---
Oh and one more thing to add, a lot of the time when you get a skill check the frame rate will go down to around 10-20 frames, it’s still easy to hit the skill checks but decisive and great skill checks are super hard to get
---
Pray for the Myers. We can't stalk through the corn. ;-;
---
It was a funny challenge for me lmao my idea was: going into the game with a green mori so I could get someone out of the way fast, then get the other 3 to death hook and kill someone when the gens were almost done, then it was just a matter of slugging and opening the gates before hooking (with bloodwarden if necessary)
---
What happened is that someone DCd probably because of the mori and one person just gave up and killed themselves on hook so I pretended to farm with the other 2 and just killed them when they did the last gen lmao
---
I’m saying with 4 survivors up the gens would go slower 
---
So it’s harder for 4 people to escape
---
And harder for Killers to 4k 
---
Benefits not as good survivors and not as good killers (Adds another layer of balance on top of matchmaking)
---
Basically like how Mario Kart gives people in last place the blue shell to slow down the person in first or bullet/mushrooms to catch up
---
(Same concept)
---
Slow down gens if the killer is not the greatest
---
Speed up gens if the survivors are failing
---
Survivors can still use their skill to waste as much time as possible just need to do it for longer if the game is going good for them
---
Killers can still use their skill to kill and pressure but average survivors actually have a chance if their team is doing bad
---
Maybe instead of just deaths factor in the amount of hooks killers are getting 
---
(Lots of hooks and deaths = Faster gens)
---
(Fewer hooks and deaths = Slower gens)
---
Maybe something like
---
Every hook = 1% Increase in gen speed
---
Every death = Reset gen speed bonus due to hooks to 0% and just add 10% gen speed
---
So killers who keep all survivors on death hook (8 Hooks) would only get 8% gen speed increase
---
3 survivors means 10% gen speed
---
2 survivors means 20% gen speed
---
This gives the killer an benefit to try to keep survivors alive for longer and have many chases and hooks (Fun for everyone)
---
For weaker killers (Maybe 5-7% slower gen speed for every generator done for max of: 20-28% slower)
---
Of course these values can be tweaked but the hope is to get the average game to progress to the powered Exit Gates and around 6-10 Hooks 
---
Preferably 8 Hooks (2 on each survivor or 2 Survivors dead and 1 on death hook)
---
Max 12 Hooks in a game should be hard
---
(1-3 Survivors dead) 
---
All survivors escaping should be hard
---
Its just there all the time. Its hard to ignore. Especiallly since I got suckered into buying the battle pass since it was my first experience with one.
---
Wont be buying the next though. I miss playing for fun
---
Oh snap! Is that the same with outfits too??? I thought it was both oops lol
---
He’s not camping, he’s patrolling!
---
You shit lol
---
I wish I had Huntresses' teachables. That would be beautiful on Bubba.
---
i think we just call that the system working as intended
---
Litterally not even 3 seconds after looking at the picture and i saw the ghostface.
---
I AM THE TRUE ALPHA VIRGIN MALE.
---
I’ve had people use that build against me and I was scared to use pallets since l couldn’t do anything
---
I’ve never had this happen personally but I’ve heard others talking about it. How is that even supposed to play out? I wonder if it’s a glitch or something new they’re testing out? Who knows but definitely sounds crazy!
---
taking a broken key makes the killer bring a mori or tunnel u to death or take Franklin's and if ur lucky all three, and u can't use hatch, might as well take a dull or skeleton with the same add ons and use it until it has a small bit left so u can still take hatch
---
Everybody clap your hands!
---
Yeahhh I know the feeling. I'm feeling a lot of pressure right now to get to tier 70 because I paid for the premium pass. I'm only at tier 40 right now and I've done all the killer challenges and about half the survivor ones. Even if I'm not in the mood to play I feel like I should get on and play a few games.
---
I honestly don't mean this in a nasty/rude way, I am just confused: What else could the survivors do instead of gens, if they want to complete the round and escape?
---
The new pins are good but 2 if his add ons (purple!) that have to do with **deep wound timer** are completely useless now, even more than before if that’s possible.
---
I'm not a killer player myself, so all I did was let the survivors farm with me all match and then when the last gen was done, I opened one of the gates and killed 2 of them. It's pretty easy to do that if you're really desperate about completing it and don't care about probably deppiping once.
---
That’s what good pussy sounds like
---
I was a survivor. After finishing a generator with one of them he quickly got in front of me and I couldn't get out. They all gathered around me at some point and then the Claudette took over. Thanks to  aftercare I could see the others working on gens and farming with the killer. When the killer finally got to us Claudette pointed at me when he inspected the situation and he insta downed me (Michael) and hooked me on my last hook.
---
1 yellow flashlight is busted flashlights?
---
This system would only serve as another crutch for killers in a long list of crutches (Hex: Ruin, window blocker, bloodlust, etc.). If the killer isn't doing well with all of the support they've gotten, then they shouldn't be propped up and should instead learn from their failures and get better at the game. Same applies to survivors. If the survivors aren't doing well, then they should lose and realize that crouching in the corner of the map is not an effective strategy to escaping.
---
Trap them in a corner, crouch, make the dash noise over and over.  :) they have no choice.  Boop and die or just die. 
---
Unless you reward boops with life.
---
It does, the couple seconds you spend screaming, your hook state doesn't decrease. Since Calm Spirit skips that it makes you die faster on the hook.
---
So I just played a game... Last half of the game I got blinded while destroying a pallet. The flashlight effect wore off then immediately came back and I was permanently blinded the last half of the game. So of course they get the last gen done and escape and there is absolutely nothing I could do about it. Also related, those ranks tho. : /
---
Yea, you only really invest more than one trap in basement if you have 3 perfect gens nearby to defend with it so that you can try and force a very painful 3 gen.
---
But damn is the stair-clip trap super good.  You can clip a trap into the bottom stair of stairs into the basement, and it is as good as invisible from above, and still really really hard to see even if you are eye level with it.
---
I play with my wife. Just something satisfying about getting to them in time for it to work.
---
Deadhard's been such a buggy inconsistent pile of crap lately that I'd probably take my chance just running through the trap.
---
And you don't trap the pallet, you trap either side of the pallet at the edge where you land from a vault/drop the pallet.  So that they have to answer to it if they jump/drop the pallet, or just deal with it if the pallet is already down.
---
Yeah, and people complained removing Hillbilly's flick would destroy him as a viable killer.  Now there's people complaining Oni is dead without it too.
---
This is reddit over-reacting as usual.
---
Some outfits are auric cells only, others are auric cells or iridescent shards.
---
Note: any copyright character is auric cells or steam store purchase only. Can’t get those with just iridescent shards.
---
You can get their perks through the shrine of secrets with shards, but that’s a random 4 perks every week.
---
Well you can run perks to be able to communicate.
---
Imagine making the same meme with "touch a gen that was just kicked and looping is a valid strategy" instead. Would sound ridiculous right? Right...
---
I just keep clicking away while they hack at me. :')
---
Am i wrong by assuming that dwight is based off one of the devs?
---
The thing is that if killer kills everybody too fast with a mori, he will depip as well
---
Yep, because it perma blinded me haha.
---
Survivors
---
Especially in swf, it’s fun to use head on. Tell your friend where you are and have them run in front of it, usually I can save a friend or two with it if they’re injured
---
"excessive celebration" xD!!
---
Ohhhh I get it. Jesus how did you win then?
---
Well kill 2.
---
Lol
---
As a huntress main I can tell you that aiming for those hatchets is not easy, especially  If they are trying to loop you around cover because the hit boxes are so broken her cover. So having the 2 extras makes all the difference otherwise Iri heads is worthless
---
I thought it was a glitch that popped up before Halloween, but was supposedly fixed? (Obvi it isn't, but I thought they had fixed the issue)
---
I really hope they don't ever take away this combo because as soon as they do Iri heads will be worthless
---
This is especially true if you play trapper, too.  You want a lot of survivor experience so you can know exactly how the survivors will want to move.  This will let you optimally place both main stay traps (That 95% of trappers know), and special trick-traps that are unique to you that just flat out catch a survivor off guard.  Why the fuck was there a trap there?!?!
---
The tombstone don't forget the tombstone.
---
I mean... Define winning? because two of them escaped while I was blinded. The two dead were killed before I was blinded. The person with the flashlight wasn't the one who blinded me, I assume someone picked it up off of her.
---
# q

Survivor are Adrenaline, Dead Hard (60% of the time it works 100% of the time!), Bond, Distortion, Unbreakable. Distortion I've found recently to be a really underrated perk for solo queue survivors (Which I am one) not so much because of the hide your aura effect, but rather the information it provides you when it goes off. Goes off after killer hooks a survivor: BBQ. Goes off after you pop a gen: Bitter Murmer. Goes off while healing: Nurse's (Which is REALLY important info with so many Ghostfaces stealthing around the fog these days). Goes off randomly but then you hear a bing bong: All Seeing add-on. Goes off while going into the basement: Territorial Imperative. I like having that kind of information as a solo queue-er, which is also why I really value Bond as well.
---
Killer is BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Nurse's Calling, and Pop. BBQ and Ruin for me are the 2 perks I run on every killer with the other 2 slots being killer-dependent, and not limited to the other 3 perks I listed here, so your mileage may vary depending on which killer you play as. For example on Trapper I run Enduring and Corrupt Intervention because you need as much time in the early game as possible to set your traps up so having Corrupt and Ruin will normally give you that while Enduring makes the M1 life easier, but on a killer like Pig or Ghostface I'll run Nurse's and Sloppy Butcher because that's just a nasty combo for stealth killers. Pop really shines on killers with great map pressure like Freddy, Nurse, Spirit, and Billy, but is really average on killers like Clown and Leatherface who have 0 map pressure.
---
But I thought death wasn’t an escape?
---
That’s what I did. Bought it digitally and didn’t tell them; they found out like a year later and were like welp you already bought it.
---
You are a pillar of this community and I wish I had your tenacity
---
In the front btw
---
I disagree but doc is still more lethal than old Freddy either way so it really doesn't matter tbh. 
---
As for Hag, I place traps where survivors pretty much have to go through either by going to gens or to get away from the hag. Yes there is some truth that I want to place traps in high traffic areas, but survivors can't just not travel the map, and it's not reasonable that a survivor is going to predict where every single trap I place is.
---
Why not add on all the gens should pop and the gates should already be open, too? Also, the killer should be 0 movement speed for the rest of the match.
---
What's the point of frenzy? It's an easy hit, and it's hard to loop it.
---
Y tho
---
I mean it is a strategy a really and one though and easily punishable and the devs see it as a strategy so I dont think this anyway would happen.. 
---
I feel this feels better under shitpost then concept.
---
I thought I saw a 4k. My bad. But I'd say killing 2 is a tie.
---
I reward boops with life. if you reward boops with death, you're cruel
---
You have my approval.
---
It's understandable. You worked hard on this and I certainly wouldn't want to just give it away. As a suggestion can we perhaps see a little Ghost Face in the future or Daddy Myers? I mean Michael.
---
I only ragequit if my teammates are morons and I know it’s going to be a bad game. For example, when an urban evading Yui brought the Killer right to me, then tried to unhook me right in front of them.
---
Yeah, no. Fuck that noise, I’m not sticking around to play with someone that stupid.
---
Would suck if three gens got completed while he camped. Wink wink.
---
yeah, it is not the same, they left me without helping xD
---
I know this is gonna sound entitled
---
 (I can’t think of the right word to use)
---
but I don’t wanna buy the legion sweaters, since they feel like lazy reskins
---
Lol well there are cruel people everywhere. 
---
Not that I do this,  I don't play pig enough.
---
I mean, if a killer brain is to just mock any idea you disagree with instead of adding to the conversation, then I prefer the big survivor brain anyways.
---
The purpose is to bait the killer in to thinking you have a key.
---
Ngl tho I’d love to wear either of these irl
---
dead by daylight
---
Yup, sometimes I want to dc but at the same time, I don’t wanna be toxic, because I want to earn at least some blood points, I do get mad at times, but I don’t bad mouth the killer I just say “gg” or “you did well” and I’ll move on. 
---
-sincerely from a sweater Kate main.
---
I haven't seen a shimeji in years...
---
Ebony mori btw
---
Yeah but make it rank 8-9 because I swear every fucking game I get
---
I would have at least gotten a 3k, maybe 4k (baring a hatch escape) had this glitch not occurred. : /
---
What wrong with that
---
Dead By Salt OverDose , these developers fucking infuriate me.
---
Did someone try and kill your computer at the end?
---
I play pig occasionally. it's nice to not give a fuck about the game until 2 gens are left sometimes.

Well congratulations, you officially win the award for the dumbest fucking post I've ever seen on this sub. That's a very impressive feat.

i feel bad for nea shes always associated with the idea of dbd toxicity
---
Complaining about ranks (or saying they’re f’ed) while bring an ebony which can remove someone from the game basically instantly
---
I think the devs are questionable, but they're a small team and this game has gotten pretty big. I think they think we'd want more content over bug fixes and shit like that. At least the casuals with under 500 hours definitely want that. They don't see the flaws of this game...
---
Weird, that's never been my experience.
---
There's a weird bug when I play that just immediately disconnects me when I know I'm about to get moried.
---
I thought it was about the wraith top tier thingy or whatever, never seen tofu being toxic though but i dont understand why get so upset about it neither
---
I used to not DC but I just don't have the patience for toxic bullshit anymore.  The more I see it the more I deal with it the less I can handle it I'd rather just disconnect and find another game where I have a chance of having fun then play a match that I can't stand because my teammates are either useless or the killer is playing toxic.
---
 You are better than me and I'm not ashamed to admit that. - a NEA main who doesn't Tbag or flashlight click because fuck those people

Sorry, can someone explain for my five year old self?

I've heard it has been.
---
In a tweet discussion involving tru3 someone mentioned tofu and hybridpanda as good examples in the community. Tru3 instead of being a smart guy and mentioning good qualities of hybrid decided to talk shit about tofu which was totally uncalled for. Some people called him out for his hypocrisy of complaining about people being mean to him while talking shit about someone else without any provocation. He continued to reply to those people but never taking back what he said about tofu as if he was owner of the absolute truth. 
---
October probably went out to defend tofu since tofu, as a content creator, would never put tru3 in his right place, a "coworker". Tru3 is a terrible human being that pretends to be positive. It doesn't take much to notice this from his almost infinite replies on tweet. 
---
October was incredibly wrong on how she got back at tru3 but this guy ain't no saint.

I would rather use a skeleton key for that.  But I don't mind losing keys.  I currently have 8 skeletons, 7 dull keys.

If you don't camp and you main Leatherface, hats off to you. I love playing him and I've fed him millions of bloodpoints. He's lots of fun. I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. So he was the first killer I mained.

To depip I'll just run builds where all I do is help my team. Breakout. Mettle of man. We're gonna live forever. Etc. If I don't get hooked three times before any of them get hooked once then I feel like I've failed. I depip. It helps my teammates. Win win.

I mean, not totally worthless because you basically still have a ranged instadown. But I don't really play Huntress that much tbh so I'll take your word for it (also dedicated server's made huntresse's hatchet hitbox more random than ever)

Those aren’t crutches they are literally necessities so survivors don’t break the game’s poor map design
---
Also it’s not like these changes should swing the tide of the game they can fine tune it to where it just brings the averages closer
---
If a survivor is just crouching in the corner they will still lose (just cuz gens are faster doesn’t mean they get an easy escape like the hatch rng)
---
This is basically in-game dynamic balance to try to somewhat counteract the terrible unfun every one dies or escapes (GG EZ) games
---
Because match making can never be perfect (It can’t account for all the variables in a game and the skill differences even in just rank 1 Killers/Survivors is so huge plus lumping all players into just 20 ranks is just the beginning of balanced matchmaking)
---
Only thing that can account for all these variables is balancing the game dynamically while it’s occurring like they already did with endgame collapse which gives survivors more time to plan and save teammates if one is down (Thus balancing each individual game) 
---
They just need to apply it throughout the whole game now
---
This gets posted all the time man, no one cares. It happens to everyone
---
Then you can watch your team self heal all around the map while you struggle on hook :')
---
Tru3 shittalked tofu without any provocation. Refused to acknowledge it after being called out by tofu himself and some friends while also not taking it back. October had enough of his shit and decided to talk shit about tru3 since tofu would never do it.
---
I honestly agree. It makes me want to cry, and I'm a grown man. This concept is fucking phenomenal. A terrifying spider god taking people and pitting them against horrifying beings in an endless cycle of death? That's like some Lovecraft shit right there!
---
But somehow, they've really just fucked it. They're clearly running out of ideas for killer powers when the community has offered great idea after great idea. 
---
Some of the survivors look like they have brain damage (Claudette) and the graphics are pretty shit.
---
Legion is an absolute joke, the majority of the Pig's addons don't even stack with each other and Bubba's are just fucking awful. Oni's power is literally just a recycled version of Billy's, and of course, bugs galore.
---
It just makes me really sad. This game has the potential to be one of the best in the history of gaming, and I really mean that, but it'll never get there because of the developer's inadequacy.
---
I do like that perk though. Less chance of me being left up there if everyone can see my team.
---
I understand, some games where you’re just getting tunneled, and chased, without a break, and having teammates that refuse to help. DC’ing would be the preferable option but when you dc the killer and all your teammates might develop a negative opinion about you. But based on what I know, you’re the type of player that wants to have fun and enjoy the game, I too am like that, the type of person that wants to have fun. Anyways I wish the best for you!
---
That's pretty shit, I'm sure he has his following of loyal defenders.
---
I am scared booping the snoot will lead to an untimely stabbing lol.

What a swell guy.
---
Oh wow what big balls you have, wish i was as courageous as you
---
But the reason they haven't added in game chat and the reason SWF wasn't a thing at launch, isn't laziness. The devs wanted the game to be played solo. To add more fear. They wanted you to rely on people you didn't know. I watched a 100 facts about the game video on YouTube. It was very interesting.
---
I pride myself in not using moris unless the game bribes me with 60k blood points.
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
Not sure friend. I suggest taking screenshots and sending in a ticket to BHVR
---
That's a good idea
---
Yes. If you take the totality of it..
---
Do you even remember how the game was on release? If not, you have no idea what are you talking about
---
201 to 500 employees. And they make games for other studios. There's not 500 people on the Dead by Daylight dev team.
---
it was a glitch, but they patched the most known way to do it. there's a new way to do it for sure though and barely anyone knows about it. I don't even know how to do it, I just know that the glitch still exists. I'm guessing most people do it on accident because most dbd glitches require insanely precise timing.
---
Jesus Christ, you salt machine. If you hate the game so much don't play it.
---
#Susie is the best legion member
---
I’m really only concerned about one purple rank in solo queue matches with rank 18s. 
---
Other than that, the difference between killer / survivor doesn’t really matter. There are a shit ton of sleeper reds at 16.
---
if you boop at the wrong time, probably.
---
My point is that maybe instead of implementing more things like bloodlust and window blocker, maybe behavior should just fix the map design, balance the killers, and bring all perks to the same level so that killers don’t have to bring ruin to not lose
---
Just wait until he goes against Spirit. He won't like the teleportation lol.
---
Your missing the /s and yea my balls are pretty big whats your point? Are you actually trying to white knight the devs after all the shit they have pulled? Common man.
---
I hope they read the subreddit so they can fully grasp just how pissed off people are with their ineptitude tbh. Maybe then they would actually fix the game.
---
Op is salty because he gets face camped.
---
I think Susie would LOVE hello neighbor ;)
---
Hahahahahaha nice joke
---
The first Spirit I faced when I was new, confused the fuck out of me. Nobody played Spirit when I started playing. At least at grey and yellow ranks.

&gt;Oh wow what big balls you have,

All the more for you to suck, my dear
---
Looks like I’m unfollowing Tofu on YouTube and checking out Paulie instead. 
---
Screw you to anyone who uses disabled people as an insult and mockery. You are pathetic and you’re a coward for hiding behind the “joke” defense. Disabled people are not a joke, but you’re definitely an asshole. 
---
“But Tofu had nothing to do with this!”
---
You dumb summer child. She’s his wife so even if he disagrees, he’s still going to defend her and her disgusting actions.
---
Flashlight them as they break pallets
---
&gt; Some of the survivors look like they have brain damage (Claudette)  
---
Well if you read her lore they sure make her sound autistic as fuck.
---
Same here. I just remember feeling overwhelmed and not knowing how to hide from her lol.
---
Let’s hope his rework doesn’t make him worse. He has 3-4 really good add ons... but the rest are worthless. 
---
I’d rather keep that, than have a bunch of meh add ons
---
So many mispellings
---
#Y E S
---
Holy shit yes I've said this forever. Remove keys and moris completely. It's dumb as shit when I'm playing well as a survivor and the tide starts to turn in my favor. I have 2 sacrificed and 2 gens left. Obviously 2 survivors left. Then boom game over.
---
As far as I have encountered!
---
With Jane's cheeks too those bad boys must have been thunder clapping
---
Holy fuck, there's so many posts of people losing their shit in recent posts.. Do you really have to leave a post in all caps where you say fucking this and fucking that every 2 seconds? Just blind at pallets. Simple solution..
---
I don't bring noed just vs it a lot
---
Does anyone like the swamp at all
---
I’m not entirely sure if you’re being serious or not, I’ll just assume you are. idk if you have already or not, but try messaging a killer and ask if you can do the challenges and in return, you’ll let them hook you. When I couldn’t use flashlights, that’s what I did. It’s frustrating, but if you haven’t told them what’s up then they’re not gonna just let you get blinds, y’know?
---

“That’s why I loooooooooovvvvveeeee borro-wed TIME!”
---
-a modified version of the nestle crunch commercial meme
---
When you 1st start playing her it's very evident that throwing the hatchets accurately requires a lot of practice I still miss about 40% of my shots.
---
So having only 1 shot renders it very ineffective.  For people that are very good at looping the killer it's even worse because most of them are pretty good at either dodging right on time or staying behind cover that is high enough that the hit Box is incredibly broken
---
I was confused as to why she was standing still and staring at me.
---
Lol what the fuck else are you gonna do if you have 3 in the basement
---
uh.. no. the system they currently have/are updating it to is pretty good. it causes the playerbase to have something to want to grind for, it helps keep the queue times lower (not saying much but it does), and it's a good way for BHVR to monitor gameplay by ranks. maybe someone made it red ranks on a whim of luck one season or got carried. if the game allowed them to stay at red ranks, they'd get destroyed. the ranking system is complained about but it's extremely useful.
---
When you won vs a killer.  Was that an escape or a pip. Because some people only count a win if you escape when in reality a win is if you rank up.
---
I kept saying to my friend "LOL I THINK SHE'S DCING".
---
Last I heard, appearently Benedict Baker caught David shitting his pants on the hook according to his note about him. Seems David is rather scared and nervous but tries to hide it. Who would blame him? Mans been through a lot and is very distraught. (Yeah, I'm a bit of a lore nerd for this game XD)
---
I'll keep note &gt;w&lt;! Thank you
---
Ah yes and what other games are they working on again? (DEAD ON ARRIVAL GARDEN?)[https://steamcharts.com/app/555440] . I swear some people would look up at a fucking bolder falling at them from above and stand in place because they think gravity doesn't fucking exist.
---
The biggest problem with red ranks is that the rank system is broken. 
---
Second biggest problem is that people want any excuse to stroke their ego, so let’s ignore that the rank system means nothing because I WANT TO FEEL IMPORTANT.
---
But that’s the thing in a game like this you can never have perfect balance
---
(There are just too many variables)
---
I just thought that balancing each game individually is easier and more efficient than balancing each killer power/perk/strategy/matchmaking/randomness in general compared to the ever increasing maps/survivor perks/killer perks because each thing they add could be balanced alone but combined with another thing just straight up broken (Ex: Balanced Landing and Haddonfield and Hawkins Lab / Nemesis and Legion’s Power / Nemesis and Play with your food which is pretty strong rn)
---
Balancing the individual games accounts for all the randomness aspect and allows them to add new content to their hearts content
---
3 layers of balancing
---
1. Nerfs/Buffs and Reworks
---
2. Matchmaking
---
3. Dynamically Balancing Individual Games
---
Cause I like self care. Got a better chance living with it Than without.
---
I don’t think Doc can go down to 0. Purple and yellow Calm (he doesn’t have a green Calm) will reduce it by 12. Monitor will lower that by another 8 for a total of a 12 meter terror radius while in punishment
---
Unhooking yourself has a 4% chance of success per attempt
---
I just hate how you can still get into lockers while it's active
---
Unpopular opinion
---
DS wouldn't need to be so strong if Babysitter was in survivor's base kit. Most "tunneling" is  a result of unhooker hiding
---
Clown main club
---
r/askreddit but what a great question
---
Do you play killer? Survivors get real sloppy/brave when they have a get out of jail free card
---
I’m pretty sure he can. Unless that was updated. I’ve never tried it. 
---
If anything it’s like a 5 meter radius.
---
I'm also that had person that doesn't care of they have a negative opinion of me.  I have actively DC games as a killer where the survivors run credible talks it because I just don't have the patience that and when it happens multiple times in a row multiple times a night it makes me not wanna play the game at all so I would rather leave a badd game and have people be upset with me then play a badd game where it makes me not want to play the game ever again.
---
 I'm incredibly pessimistic and easily depressed person because my bipolar disorder  I get frustrated very easily  And repeated failure without having fun makes me awful.  I hate that about myself and I try not to but even I have badd days where I have no self control
---
reminds me of when my best friend stabbed his xbox 360 with a screwdriver when he was 13
---
People trying to defend tru3, saying he is the victim being harassed by other groups (like he always says), here is how it all started:
---
https://twitter.com/XolfRiggler/status/1204929205625974784 
---
If you know how to use twitter, just continue reading the replies and the people joining the "conversation".
---
Tru3 basically shit talked tofu without any kind of provocation. Tofu himself called him out for that but tru3, as arrogant as he always is, refused to take back what he said and continued on the same path. October probably got tired of his shit and decided to make that terrible tweet since most of the other content creators tip-toe around Tru3 as a professional courtesy.
---
well yeah, your add-ons are cancerous
---
I like the game and I'm willing to put up with the bugs. I don't know how it plays on PC, but I never face bugs on console. The only gamebreaking bug was the basement bug.
---
Just get good lol
---
Nah the game has problems but just thought the final part of what you said was kinda sad
---
Well it is... but it’s a horrible start that smart people can easily abuse and punish.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
yes
---
Yep they should either switch the killer one to get a 4k or switch the survivor one to make them double pip. That would be fair.
---
I imagine there's a lot of problems caused by dedicated servers.
---
Worst part is it wasn’t even my Xbox. Apparantly my brother was just borrowing it from a friend. That’s 150$ I’ll never get back
---
They're bad and/or (but usually both) don't know how to play as a team rather than an individual.

---
4. I hope you get the challenge done soon
---
That's a recipe for red ranks to ruin low rank games.
---
Well my teammates never heal me. I might aswell.
---
I understand that, but what is the point of it if you're missing? If you're swinging in the first place you already know where somebody is. What purpose does the scream serve at that point?
---
The funny part is Claudette's lore makes her autistic. Literally.
---
Its why I stopped buying characters immediately on their release
---
hoooly shit. Brothers friend must’ve been pissed.
---
That's because you get people who work with the killer, so it can make people pretty wary. I will listen for the most part, but if someone is pointing at a locker for no apparent reason, I ain't trusting that.
---
Don’t stress yourself to hard and I hope you have a good one, repeated failure can get annoying but if you can try not to let get ahold of you. Again I wish the best for you.
---
Yeah if you run iri hatchets then selfish or entitled people will just quit.

Dedicated servers are definitely an issue, Peer to Peer wasn't perfect either, but that's just the reality of gaming online. In general, dedicated servers are better overall when done CORRECTLY. But its BHVR so ya know, the servers being poorly optimized and riddled with errors is par for the course.
---
I know, cringe title I’m sorry
---
Well then, you're either very lucky or straight-up lying. Because I've run into four that I can remember on console (though I know I've encountered more):
---
\-A healing action on another survivor interrupted for literally no reason
---
\-getting stuck on a tree
---
\-automatically dying during the second hook phase
---
\-somehow crawling past the exit gate spikes but not actually leaving the game
---
It's okay Moose. As someone previously said, try to flash them as they break pallets.
---

---
GeForce NOW executes the cloud gaming very well
---
Well yeah, not being able to chat with the other survivors is part pf the game
---
if you missed the survivor you're going for, it was either they're good, or you messed up. if they're good, just go after the person who's not paying attention.
---
Bring inner strength if you're worried about healing. 
---
I used to be so worried about healing, but now I just run Adrenaline or Iron Will or both. Sometimes I bring a 1 or 2 heal medkit. Self-care really isn't good. Even if there's no sloppy or Thanatophobia, it's still 32 seconds wasted.
---
Mclean? Is that you? How do Mccote's balls taste?
---
how the flying fuck did you complete it early.
---
You took anger management classes because you don’t know how to get out of a situation that’s pissing you off. 
---
Mate when you are having multiple bad games just get the fuck off because it really affects you and can make you horrible in general and then you do horrible shit whether to yourself, others or  objects. 
---
There’s no point in putting yourself through that suffering, just have fun and play a different game.
---
Absolutely agreed. Please BHVR!
---
I don't usually crawl out. I run Adrenaline or dead hard so I can usually get out fine. I do bump into objects a lot though. That fuck up my loops as killer or survivor. But I've never automatically died during second phase. I do die to lag spikes sometimes on hook. But the healing thing happens all the time. It always takes me 2 tries to heal someone. It just makes me tap them a few times and it is a time waster for sure.
---
This argument is irritating because nobody is talking about the logistics in this situation. Talking about the game environment, repetitive games with people using this “strat” is what keeps survivors from playing and has turned much of the Survivor base away, because it’s damn near impossible to have any fun playing a game that bland. A horrible start that can easily give a killer two kills if they run insidious is less of a abuse and punishment situation and more of a pain in the hind quarters. Even worse when a person considers themselves “good” at the game if that happens. So the wrong people end up in red ranks and red ranked players practically hate the game by that point.
---
But I also was just making a meme so
---
We don't have dedicated servers on console yet and I'm kind of glad.
---
I like how you intentionally left of the scores. Get the 4K but didn’t want people to see?
---
It's cause the game tries to matchmake you with other survivors/a killer that's within 6 ranks of your own. It'd be next to impossible to find a game otherwise
---
My Kate has a sweater with default Horta (I’m saving up shards so I can but the Americana denim pants)
---
If he gets destroyed he'll derank eventually. Being a good player and getting paired with dumbasses is extremely stressful. The new ranking system is somewhat better though
---
Ahh didn’t see shitpost my bad and I find it more toxic survivors turn killers away more then anything mate.
---
Stop trying to give the survivors a fun or fair game, they'll never appreciate it and always come up with new reasons to whine
---
Insta heal + 4 Borrowed Times btw
---
honestly just a kind fucking anything :(  And i thought i lost my fucking shit this month.  Week after week of fucking putting up these suicide posts.  And idek like ive talked to so many chill people and shit, i should feel better but i dont.  Ever since my dad cut me out of his life shits been fucking awful, then recently my friends and  SO dumped me and shit just fucking sucks.  Im a nasty person now and i cant fucking do this shit.

---
It can still happen, this is just the first of many examples I could find sadly. But yea this game is one huge spegahti of bugs and wasted potential.
---
I run it, but never use it in terrible situations when/where I shouldn’t. I don’t use it when I know that I’m in a position where I can be healed by teammates instead. I’m altruistic as fuck, can keep chases, and do gens. I’m never a potato and I dont use it when I notice that a teammate is about to die on hook or about to reach second hook when no one else is trying for the save. If I’m near a gen, I’ll hop on it rather than healing myself and heal myself after getting a good bit done. If you’re the selfish type and heal yourself in stupid ass situations and fuck over your team, then you shouldn’t run it. I’m rank 1 and it’s just a really nice perk for me honestly. I’d rather not run bond and end up running across the map to a teammate who may or may not heal me with the possibility of the killer finding me in that time. I know it’s strange to hear, but self care can be used efficiently. Just depends on who’s using it.
---
Disagree :)
---
I don't like Tru either but Tofu is just as much of a toxic piece of shit as anyone else. Just because he's jovial and not bitter (like AngryManchild) doesn't make him any less shitty.
---
With the majority of tracking perks (the word perks including killers innate add ons and abilities) and vigilance could find a stray survivor who’d been working on objectives easily and Escaping alive doesn’t give enough to pip or not de pip last I checked and plus it is really shitty to generally leave someone to die on hook, especially first hook. like I said - Odds are that killer will get two kills from camping in a normal game, and maybe more depending on how the game goes on. It’s hard to pull the “You’re not being smart.” Argument if the killer is running insidious, is one of the killers who can hide their terror radius, or has an insta down ability.
---
I'm quite sure someone will yoink that one and delete his signature one day
---
Yea he is
---
Gotta love losing rank as killer because you played so well, the whole survivor team d/c
---
fortniteburger.net
---
Well so is two of Legion but they're killers nontheless.
---
Honestly I think I would like him more if he didn't say the f word so much. I'm not against cursing or anything, and I definitely say it myself, but he can hardly say a single sentence without the f word in it. I dont know why people consider him "wholesome" to be honest. Regardless, he is a good streamer that educates people about the game, which is more than we can say about many of the other DBD streamers. Tru3 dat.
---
Tombstone requires you to throw the entire game to maybe get all the juice and there's no way you're not losing pips
---
Pinky Finger is very strong, but requires you to use bottles a way clown usually doesn't (landing it directly on someone)
---
Iri Head tho? F that shit. With belt, it's 2 less hatchets for free instadowns. it practically increases your hatchets by 1 (3 instadowns vs 2.5 downs with normal ones) as long as you can land them, but landing 1/3 is quite easy
---
Can someone tell me what the fuck a "Fog Whisperer" is?
---
I think Pop by itself is probably the strongest killer perk. I sometimes like to run empathy cause the ability to see auras is powerful. Can give you really good info on your positioning and can even tell you where the killer is if a chase is going on with someone injured.
---
i can see why it should be one of the top 4 survivor perks. i just dont run it myself because i prefer the social aspect of using Bond instead and finding someone to heal me
---
Not screaming when getting hit can be big
---
She downed me and as she was putting it on the last gen popped &amp; adrenaline kicked in

Just make sure you have Any Means Necessary to reset it back
---
don’t blame the perk.. blame the players who don’t know how to use it correctly. oftentimes it would be irresponsible to do anything while injured. yes, there are many cases where there’s literally no reason to sit over there and self-care for half the game but no skilled player has the nerve to do that to themselves. 
---
i run self care because it helps me &amp; my team.
---
I almost shit myself ngl 😭😭
---
sorry im fucking done wih everything right now
---
I NEVER stopped?!
---
Nope 😭😭😭
---
it's more than the fucking game, this is just a breaking point.  Sorry I couldn't deal with my shit
---
&gt;china is the north korea of japan
---
bruh
---
Imagine being this upset over a game you clearly don't like. Think you need to get a grip.
---
alright thanks
---
I had a match in the memorial where a generator kept getting worked on and I couldn't figure out where the survivor was, I must have ran through there at least 7 times to kick it. Finally I realized there was a locker so I decided to check it and there was Detective Tapp staring me in the face. I check lockers a little more often now.
---
It still happens on Dedicated servers on PC. It will be even worse on console. Dedicated servers are a joke and might as well just not exist.
---
ps4
---
Wtffff. What was the killer?
---
Have you made a Michael one?
---
Itd be cool if you had dual monitor set up and put your main survivor on the left.
---
I’ve gone through the same thing in life man, no part due to dbd but I know what you’re feeling. If you’re on xbox, go to recent players when you get in the match and the odd username out from the survivors in the lobby is the killer. I’m not quite sure about ps4, but I’m pretty sure there’s something similar too. If you ever need to talk, my messages are open. Stay strong, don’t do something reckless. Ending your life takes away everything, not just the sadness. You’ve got so much to live for, if dbd makes you this upset, it’s time to put the controller down and pick up something that brings you joy and joy only.
---
I didn’t see lol
---
&lt;3
---
You give me a stubborn enough Meyers even without those addons on which slow his stalk insanely and I can still give you 2 gens at one loop before he gets to tier 2.  Line of sight can be a real bitch to him particularly at the long loops when he's in tier 1.  Consider how slow he is physically while running the addons you're complaining about.  This makes it insanely easy to loop him and get distance on him.
---
And the whole 3 gens thing is just an arbitrary number you're tossing out.  Again I've played against this plenty of times and denied his tier 3 entirely.  It's all about how good you and your teamates are.  It takes like 3 full survivors maxed stalk to get unlimited tier 3 with Tombstone.  That should take an incredibly long time as long as everyone rotates their camera while repairing.
---
You asked how you could know he was running those addons.  He literally told you what addons he was running the moment he moried the first survivor and didn't come out of tier 3 but you should have known before that.  His movement speed is noticabley slower with Tombstone on.  Also if he's playing primarily to stalk from a distance just assume he has at the very least unlimited tier 3 addons on if not both of them.  There were plenty of warning signs of his addons, you just have to know what to look for.
---
I feel like actively being able to communicate makes the game way more unbalanced. It's why I kinda super hate SWF, but understand why it's a thing (it's fun to play with friends) that they added. The lack of proper communication and no way to get across what you're seeing to other people outside of gestures adds to the tension, the fear and makes the killer more of a threat. If you actually know where he is at a given time outside of perks, it's a lot easier to deal with him.
---
It’s ok bro, it’s gone. It can’t hurt you or scare you anymore. 😭
---
Imagine thinking because someone calls out something for being bullshit make them suddenly hate everything about it. Jesus man the extrapolation is insane. The things you love oftentimes get the hardest of scrutiny exactly BECAUSE you care about it. Maybe you should learn what the fuck your talking about before you wrek yourself friend.
---
I don't mean to rain on your parade but desync can still happen on servers
---
MYC would require for a wraith not to camp which I think is impossible.
---
FULL SUPPORT BROTHER
---
and im going crazy hurting myself over one.  Good god man i should just quit this game. Bad for my health
---
Gotta love it when you wait 10 minutes for a lobby, 3 more minutes to get in game, then the game is over is 30 seconds...at some points this game feels like a queue simulator
---
Hey, just because you react poorly to how you're feeling doesn't mean you're a nasty person. You're still capable of doing good things, so I don't want to hear you talk about yourself like that! I'm sorry shit has been so hard for you, that has to be so incredibly difficult to deal with, then to get on DBD and have a bad time. While I can't help you with your personal life, I do hope it gets better for you. I have Major Depressive Disorder and have attempted suicide twice, so I can sympathize when you say you want to die. I just want you to know that there some options out there to get some help, and I do hope they are in reach for you. I do understand if they are not in reach, in which case I hope you can hold on until you get that help. People like you are what make this game good, friend. I hope we don't lose you.
---
I had that happen to me once
---
I was running plunderers and found 3 keys. I have 2 of them to others
---
Then we did all the gens and I was close to the gate (no idea where the hatch was)
---
And then... One escaped, second one escaped, third one escaped, killer found me.
---
I ran across the map, looping as possible, checked 5/6th of the map, didn't find the hatch
---
Went to the last part and then... I got downed next to the hatch.
---
If only they waited... I had Bond, I would've seen them... We had multiple keys, so killer closing it wouldn't be an issue. I did all the totems so noed was also not an option.
---
They paid the price and didn't get the "Where did they go?" achievement. Luckily, I had the achievement already.
---
we? is your mother joining us?
---
Better to learn it now. Small game will help with the learning process, but once they start memorizing the locations, they can use that perk slot for something else. I’d recommend maybe Empathy or Kindred (I’m just running a fun build of Kindred, Empathy, and Bond as I get to P3 Yui) for help in determining what to do in certain situations or to have really good info when someone’s injured or on hook.
---
You're so mad lol. Just a game. No need to cry.
---
I played against 3 Blendettes in the same neon outfits and toolboxes. The 4th was in all dark clothes and had a medkit. I brought out the green mori, Franklin's, the chewed pen/drop leg knife sheath add-ons, and the purple rotten oak. No one escaped.
---
I’m so glad I never bought him, knowing how they always treat their strongest killers at early release. I wait months to buy a killer until he’s balanced.
---
Imagine being new to a game and immediately declaring something over powered and demanding it be nerfed. Actually, youre gunna fit in just fine here.
---
No honey... survivors, practically regardless of the killer, have a 30% survive rate. I’m sure Oni’s stats were INCREDIBLY more aggressive (&lt;10% survive) yeah yeah go ahead and downvote me
---
Sounds like you need a break after a long day my man. Game can get frustrating but dont let it devour you
---
Lol kid your outclassed and your just making yourself look even worse, just give it a break.
---
Just take a break from the game.
---
I played against 4 matching Kate's one time, and got DS'd 3 times. I was so confused watching them all run in packs.
---
The original game was based around teamwork without communication, it's just that swf changed all that.
---
It is a very poor add-on. The only use I can see in it is during niche situations where you may have a survivor that may be hiding in a locker and you want to quickly find which one they are in.
---
Other than that its very poor as 12 meters is barely any distance. Its only purpose really is to tell you where a survivor that has dodged your demon strike has went which to be honest is not really helpful.
---
Don’t forget to mention wait times in ques. One of the big reasons that Console has such small communities is because wait times coupled with killers that abuse camping strats. People view the game as not worth the time and frustration. Between that, waiting forever for a game, toxic people on survivor and killer side, and the horrible way it runs on console? Why would they want to play. This just gives them more reason to quit. 
---
It is infuriating to wait 20+ minutes for a game, only to be found first, camped, and then hard tunneled off the hook.
---
I hope Ghost Face and maybe Pig get sweaters. That’d be amazing
---
How did she take damage before you even started swinging your club? Like she screamed and blood spurted and only then did you swing it.
---

heart attack by daylight
---
They were clearly being toxic in this clip your very delusional
---
I didn’t, figured it was just a glitch on my part
---
I forgot to add that I've seen some people commenting about sound bugs in the game, but nothing like this. :')
---
I was in a dark room when I played this and everyone in the house is asleep. It spooked me good lol, now I'm afraid to walk to my bed!
---
Seizure by sunrise
---
The ptsd still fresh
---
susie cute sweater
---
I’m just joking around relax bruh, that challenge was pretty tough for me when I didn’t know how to use a flashlight too
---
Honestly was waiting for another trap to be around the shack lol
---
How did a 5 year old make you this mad to post about it on here like it's your diary?
---
JESUS CHRIST MY HEART the moments DBD is scary as fuck
---
Because they're too stupid to know they're throwing the game.  Just laugh it off and play to pip not survive.  Self Care Gamers will kill you everytime just get that rank up on the way out.
---
Same
---
I laughed so hard my dogs started to awooooooo me
---
Geez I’m actually starting to feel somewhat bad for tru3. The constant hate he gets and now this? But that’s nothing to how Paulie feels right now. Must be a real kick to the teeth to have a fellow whisperer joke about such a serious matter to him. Paulie nor his family deserve that, too wholesome :(
---
I knew somebody was gonna say this! I just thought it was funny that’s all ;)
---
yes bc everyone that is actively playing is gonna be around those ranks bc today is rank reset day
---
You accidentally DS'd your connection instead of the killer.
---
I dunno, it just doesn't seem fun to point fingers and laugh at someone who could very well be a little kid.
---
Had the achievement for awhile actually
---
At first, I thought he was wearing a McDonald's outfit
---
Such a noob perk man.  Leave it at Green ranks and below where it belongs.  It's just free gen pressure without requiring a killer perk slot.  
---
It's good for securing hatches while the gens don't get done and you wait out teamates to die, that's about it.
---
I love the swamp as killer and survivor. I get why people hate it, but I’ve had my favorite matches on that map. My least favorite is the game, it’s too hard to tell where everything is and just not fun to play on.
---
Darn it, Myers, why u have to be so tall when I'm trying to sneak up on survivors with Monitor and Abuse? ☹
---
I honestly thought they were just trying to get me mad in a childish way. I wouldn’t post it if I knew they were a kid, trust me.
---
Just because someone uses a mori doesn't mean they suck.
---
be careful with your words please when someone’s obviously not having the best time. it could be anything. even if it was a joke.
---
I run self-care because I don't trust casual matches
---
Actually in the other clip it kind of sounds like trapper for a sec
---
Ah yes you totally should need it centered to the very fucking pixel, very logical
---
Fuck em, then. Go onto the next game lol
---
Big oof
---
Outplayed obviously.
---
The point is if you spot him, you spot him.

---
I use it because I only trust myself. I don't give a shit if anyone else lives, I play solo, I survive solo.
---
Dead By Daylight has the same pattern as Friday the 13th did, except I doubt this game will die like that one did.
---
The devs colossally fuck something (or multiple things) up, the player base is outraged, people speak up against the shitty devs. Then the devs drop new content, the player base quiets down for a bit, and then the cycle repeats when something else gets broken.
---
I haven’t played in days so I don’t even know what issues are going on, but I guarantee this will happen again. The devs have the money to hire outside help, just like the F13th devs did, and they refuse to do it when they clearly cannot handle this game. It’s sad.
---
Exactly!!! There’s so many tater tots who play Nea it’s not even funny
---
thanks bro it helps a lot to be spoken to with respect and to be given advice.  I lost my shit so I didn't deserve your kindness, it'smuch appreciate
---
I just play her because I like noob3
---
Same happened to me yesterday on Pc but it was nurse and myers. I couldn’t play after that game because it kept freezing ( worked fine after validating the files in steam)
---
They are just trolling and trying to get streamers. If there isn't enough offerings they might just kill everyone off and find a new game. They aren't good enough to know how to max every category with BBQ and get up to 65k points a game.
---
Yeah, but that’s what I’m saying about his add ons. There’s like 3-4 that make it pretty good... but you’re pretty much forced to use them. 
---
Then you get survivors who know how to loop and it’s game over. Lol.
---
Favourite: crotus penn asylum &amp; coldwind

Worst maps in the game: the game &amp; badham preschool
---
dude i got you if you need someone.  I'm trying to be okay and you're a great guy.  I'll do what I can for you bro.  I appreciate your help tonight
---
Killers who mostly camp are gonna end up basically 50/50 of either losing with this strat of theirs or win because of getting hook grabbed or actually managing to give borrowed time on someone or just plain and clean rescue.
---
But am I the only one who thinks that basement camping is the most unfair situation? And alright, unpopular opinion of mine but basement should be changed by its overall look or give it an additional path or cave entrance? I want it to have two ways of entering cause I really dislike how some of the maps and their base entrances have very and very narrow entrances. I guess the most low effort match I had to witness that I was outside of Thompson's house and inside the main building was the basement: Plague used her vomit as all three Survivors that got in for rescuing one person and she continued this till all of them purged down with full sickness. (Not to mention there were more egregious moments where Killer just stands there and blocks the path specific map basements just to be annoying)
---
It very much is Sarcasm. I never thought a statement that silly could be taken as serious but I suppose /s exists for a reason.
---
Its forced culture. Make war not love.
---
Freddy, no question. He brought something completely different to the game and murdered survivors when he very first came out.  Within a few days, decent survivors figured him out and realized that he wasn’t all too strong. However, the damage was already done. Enough players lost their shit over him and bomb reviewed the game causing a knee jerk reaction by the devs. They essentially destroyed an already extremely counter able killer.
---
I mean, you kinda fell for it. Have I ever done it? No.
---
Will I someday? Maybe.
---
Can I? Yes. 
---
Is it possible I will in the near future? Yes. 
---
Will I choose Leatherface? Yes.
---
The think is it takes time for oni to get his power , billy has his chainsaw 24/7 and having that turn advantage taken away feels like a nerfed billy who has to steal gas from survivor to use his power
---
If you have it, remember me.
---
Only maps I like are the Macmillan ones. I feel most at home on them. Scrotus prenn maps suck dick.
---
Hey man that’s life, shitty things happen but we gotta bounce back lol. 
---
Don’t worry about me focus on yourself I hope things get better soon man. 
---
Also np if you ever need to talk or vent just hit me up man . But I won’t lie I can be brutally honest sometimes whether you want to hear it or not, I rather be truthful then kind of lie lol. Anyways good luck to you!
---
Samination made a joke about this already. But oh boy, I surely wouldn't mind an April Fools day to give or even mod out for Amanda's pig head to Miss Piggy.
---
Freddy is prolly the number one. When he came out he was different and so people complained so he was nerfed into oblivion for 2 years. When he first came out, he wasn't even top tier really, but then he got hit so hard it wasn't even fun in an ironic way.
---
Not as radical but a good kick in the pants is when they "buffed" Wraith by adding his speedboost, they also gave him a slow while uncloaking, making it virtually meaningless, and on top of that they gutted his best addons.
---
That's actually pretty funny.
---
If me or my brother get as much as a message from a random person after joining a lobby we leave
---
i appreciate it! no problem. i hope the best for you and your struggles whatever it may be.
---
    B I N G      B O N G
---
This made me laugh thank you
---
you're just mad because you got got.
---
Freddy for is a good candidate but he’s back with a vengeance. Idk tho Oni might take the cake cause he came with a huge day 1 nerf basically lmao
---
That’s an interesting conjunction
---
You bait good killers into hunting you while everyone else works.
---
Yes, it's all coming together
---
Holy shit, this game actually is scary after all
---
I am talking about people just standing next to the hook. Wouldn’t be a meme if it was as rational people keep trying to make it out to be. Have faith, I understand common sense.
---
Oh dude i got stuck on a gen while playing on pc the other day so im glad it wasnt just me. I kinda just spun around on the gen until a claudette came up and started working on the gen, damaging it unstuck me
---
Probably 15th time for me. It doesn't harm you in any way. It's rather an error where you can't go back to lobby when exiting a server.
---
Almost as fair when survivors spawn next to my ruin.
---
Fait enough, but at the same time, camping wouldn't be a thing if survivor's didn't dive hooks like madmen.
---
I crouch once to say thanks. More than one, to me, is BM.
---
Why would I cry when someone dc's? They're being a pussy. I don't give a shit. 
---
You seem very bent out of shape after this experience. This guy really did some damage on ya.
---
Besides the Primer Bulb, Tuning Guide, Beast Marks, &amp; The Grease. I would argue the rest are literally useless. Let's also not forget about the fact that both Chili &amp; Award Winning Chili have been broken since *day 1*. Or that some add-ons that they copy pasted from Billy to Bubba just fundamentally work on him like the muzzle add-on that makes it quieter. What use does that have on Bubba since you're always on their ass anyway? He's been in such a sad state since his launch and they've done just nothing about it.
---
By far not a Tru3 fan here (haven't watched him in over a year),  but people would have questioned why he ignored the suggestion of Tofu if he just talked about Panda. If the two legitimately have some beef (which it seems clear they do) he was in a lose/lose regardless of what he did, and saying he has some bad experiences with the guy seems like a minor thing to say in comparison.  
---
Tofu could have also messaged him privately to sort out the situation, instead of coming in all guns blazing on a public forum.
---
The only issue with Bubba is how good of a camper he is, it’s fun when they ACTUALLY play him like he was realistically which was deadass CHASING PEOPLE WITH A CHAINSAW. I don’t think he needs a rework, I feel like there should be a activity timer where if a killer is just standing there doing NOTHING within a certain distance of a hooked survivor, something bad happens. A refined system, nothing that could be exploited by toxicity.
---
He's trash, not you.
---
For endgame collapse it's even better. You can use No one left behind, Hope, Borrowed Time and Breakout.
---
Having 14% of speed for reaching a hook body blocking it, is just pure mad man build. Just be careful not to screw yourself with it.
---
It's so fucking unnecessary. I don't understand. I feel so fuckin bad for Legion mains.
---
People dislike the fact that DS remains active despite obviously not tunneling. They hooked someone else, so they clearly weren't tunneling. 
---
I've had games where I get a down then just run into a previously hooked survivor. That survivor wasn't tunneled, they played badly. 
---
As a whole DS is fine, however I think it should be changed so it is no longer active after either healing or someone else being hooked.
---
This is so cool!
---
just one
---
dont use oni
---
The MacMillian maps are all around the best ones imho.
---
Coldwind maps can suck all of the dicks in the universe.
---
Mention must go to old Pale Rose, that map was fucking unplayable at release. For the uninitiated, old swamp was about four times as large as it is now.
---
It’s honestly funny how the chili add ons are completely worthless. I have a massive stack of them because I had to clear blood webs just for spark plugs and long rails.
---
The flick has been nerfed.
---
I think you mean Scrotus Peen.
---
You have totems spawning on the very corners of the map. And even hatch spawns on corners.
---
For Killers it is sometimes great because Survivors don't usually search at the far ends. But it is vice versa.
---
SHIZAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Wow. I became an adult tonight and was so excited and lived this comic
---
At rank 12 that’s only one rank, it would reset you to 13
---
Flick is almost non-existent at this point tbh. When using oni I would have as much info perks as possible, zanshin tatics, bbq, tremor, discordance, definitely have nurses as survivors will be healing to stop the blood orbs and do not follow survivors to infinite loops while using fury. If they reach a loop and refuse to leave it, abandon the chase and head to one of the far gens and catch the rest of the team by surprise using that demon sprint. Also don’t hook immediately after downing a survivor with demon strike always check your surroundings as you may find another. One last thing is if you get a hook and fury at the same time, don’t use fury. Save it until someone rescues then sprint back to the hook to get a 2 for 1. Oni is all about pressure rn I would play him like a legion/billy hybrid just run n gun the whole match don’t do too much chasing except to build up fury
---
I can’t play it on my Phone 😐
---
I'm waiting until it's 0 degree :)
---
Yeah I got a piggy game yesterday and all I wanted to do was boop the snoot but they kept trying to kill me and succeeded. I left that game with zero boops and a broken heart.
---
I'm a Bill main because I LOOOOVE the L4D games but most Bill mains are pretty dumb
---
So you want to nerf an already bad killer? Lol. 
---
Dude, without add ons, LF can’t use his chainsaw in a chase. He only has like 3 add ons that even work.
---
I did tell the other person that the flick was unintentional even before the patch. Perhaps I'm a dev in secret XD
---
Otz and Tofu are friends, or at least friendly with one another as they recently played together with Scott Jund and JaeRoar
---
I don’t know a lot about true, I personally am not a fan of him at all, but I can understand why some might be I suppose
---
Tofu’s girlfriend saying that stuff about true was way out of line, but it wasn’t tofu who said it and I haven’t seen him say anything about the situation yet besides his own tweets about the initial set off prior to his girlfriends tweet
---
Okay if I get this glitch, I'll have a heart attack. Please tell me this is a one time thing.
---
well yeah i know that but i mean like for future reference. that’s still annoying af
---
This is me when I play. I even had a group of 3 people who would follow me crouching and spin in circles with me.. But they wouldn't boop my snoot :c
---
They don’t though, not from what I’ve experienced at least. Unless they’re newer to the game.
---
I thought they buffed it with the last patch, at least on console. I know they nerfed it on pc
---
Then you must be lucky.
---
Survivors who play bad are cute and I feel bad for killing them.
---
Then enlighten me? I’m just speaking from experience and spitballing a idea that is by no means unrealistic so forgive my confusion.
---
Flicking doesn’t really work on console unfortunately but you can still maneuver him well.
---
Awesome. One more please for my second monitor 🥵
---
ah yeah that might explain it. PC survivors at high rank are super fucking bold for no good reason.
---
My favorite is how literally every DS thread has the exact same argument in it:
---
“DS is designed to do X, but it actually does X, Y, and Z.  It should be changed to only do X”
---
“But we need it to do X, you can’t change it!”
---
“Okay but it needs to change to stop doing Y and Z.”
---
“Only bad killers have to worry about X.”
---
“God this sub is so (insert role here)-sided, BHVR just listens to babies whining”
---
They're saying Freddy but I didn't played when he first came out. I'll add another one for the discussion because it was the biggest nerf I saw: the pig.
---
The pig was a tier or two higher a year ago. She wasn't even top tier killer or anything, but was much more letal than she is now. I played her a lot and she was the one who got me to the red ranks for the first time. I mained her for almost a year. Then, the nerfs came out of nowhere. First, the increased terror radius, then the shitty helmet mechanics update. If I play her now on the red ranks I'll probably lose the majority of the games. 
---
The increase of her terror radius was the biggest nerf I saw in this game. Along with monitor and abuse it  allowed her to get very close to a Gen, suppress her terror radius by crouching and then ambush or Gen grab someone. Also, nurses calling was very good on her for the same reason. Now you have to be crouch and walk slower than survivors to be stealthy or stand up and don't just be an m1 killer with no fun. Devs are killing this game and they don't know that.
---
They meant a bamboozle thingy I think. Like making you think they are watching a mori for the fourth time because ebony, but in actuality they are watching them on YouTube because they suck and can’t mori survivors
---
Doin' gens,you?
---
ok bye :)
---
Killer camps, he’s already being punished. Gens are being done and he’s actively losing points. That ends that argument. 
---
Adding another feature to fuck over a camper (in this case LF) is a straight nerf. On top of LF not having any working addons is just cancer. 
---
If LF is camping, who cares? Just fix the gens and leave. Nobody is making anything. And that killer won’t be making it to higher ranks. 
---
If it is a rank one face camping, he’s fucking with you. Fix the gens/struggle and leave.
---
For me it 75/100 lol
---
If the area around the basement is the area you are in and that has pallets you usually won't have a choice unless you somehow lose him.
---
Plus agi/ig are pretty common on trapper, so the distance to the basement grows.
---
Yeah, well tell that to my teammates who refuse to heal me.
---
That double scream was beautiful
---
Yeah, I've been abusing Botany Knowledge alongside Abdominal Dressing. I don't use Charges Addon while this bug is live.
---
I love this game but I hate this community and these developers. I'm stuck at red ranks as a killer main on PS4. The game is basically not fun anymore. I have to sweat every match with the killers I like to play (Trapper, LF, Huntress) to usually squeak 1 or 2 kills against these 4 man SWFs. The devs do nothing to compensate killers for having to deal with this aggravating bullshit. It's too time consuming to derank since just straight up d/cing a bunch in a row gets you banned. On top of that, it's unbelievable the amount of people that I have to block for sending me angry messages calling me trash or gg ez or telling me to kill myself. Just sad.
---
Queue times for red rank survivors on PS4 are usually 10+ minutes. They must not have a lot of killers playing. I wonder why, can't figure it out
---
Didn't take long but only because there were many of those posts before. I love it
---
Legion been nerfed so much he’s used to it now
---
I have so much fun using ebony moris.
---
Ranks mean nothing in this game. All it does is separate those who play a lot and those who are more casual. It's not skill based.
---
idk what the worst of all time would be but to explain how "old" legion worked, he was all around faster, and his attacks in frenzy had no cooldown(basically mad grit) and he could hit the same survivor with frenzy multiple times, and it would take time off the deep wounds timer. also they could just frenzy someone and follow their trail without initiating a chase and the survivor would go down from deep wounds with no counter whatsoever bc even if you try to mend theyd just slap you with a basic attack anyways. legion on release was some pretty terrible shit. it actually deserved the nerf although the devs almost always go overboard with the nerf stick
---
Same here. Problem is that I rank up to red ranks eventually no matter what I do
---
You mean it's boring again or did I miss something?
---
The only Pig I faced today tunneled and proxy camped me and kept tunneling me when though I had an activated Trap. But this is a rare occurrence. Most Pig Players are awesome. You can find them on r/Oinkers_
---
Demo regains sealed traps.
---
No doubt brotha!
---
Yo can use perks to occupy Survivors or even give bonus to yourself. As long as you know how to give pressure you can do it without ruin or corrupt. And depending on maps.
---
Dying light and Pop Goes the Weisel. I kill the Dying Light asap. Breaking gens with every hook.
---
I actually main David with a No Mither build but haven't encountered Oni yet. Will I leave orbs for him if I run No Mither regardless of the perks attributes?
---
Old rank reset would have sent you (a rank 12) down to rank 15.
---
Thrilling tremors and play around it. It single handedly let me win a match as wraith after letting them finish 4 gens.
---
I want to Kermit suicide!
---
I have never gotten jump scared by a stealth killers. Just annoing how sometimes they get free first hit, cause no terror radius.
---
KERMI KERMI KERMI! -miss Amanda before murdering Kermit the dweet
---
So now using the chains addons for Freddy is even more pointless than before
---
I do sometimes. If I'm working on a gen looking one way and they come from the other direction and grab me.
---
That will often jump scare me.
---
And yeah, they get easy first hits. But they're balanced around that.
---
😂 whole team scurrying around in a panic. Did anyone get out? Of the basement or the trial?
---
You misssed  something. It’s all dead and cancelled

---
Trapper has been left behind in the dust. While survivors are weaker than launch in some aspects they're a lot stronger in others, namely how fast the speed of high rank games are.
---
The other meg managed to slip out of the basement. Unfortunately she didn't get very far though, because he had almost every trap outside it
---
The true decision is to get stake out, since you're always in the terror radius it's infinite stacks
---
Damn. Yeah, well played Trapper. 😂
---
I've been at rank 2 with wraith and let me tell you, it was not fun.
---
Which is a perfectly justifiable change.
---
Do you take bloodpoints?
---
And maintains him being anti-fun for the other 4 people in the game.
---
Did you feed her after midnight? Or pour water on her?Or expose her to bright lights?
---
Idk why some pigs are so aggressive and sensitive about it 💀😂
---
Yeah, people saying the "flick" took skill were kidding themselves. You just swung the mouse in the direction the survivor turned with a good 1-2 seconds of leeway and the power did all the work for you.
---
We get it you play nude. No need to brag.
---
Lol "then wake up". Of course I kept running from border to the map to border to wake up every minutes, but surprise, yopuc ome back to your gen, kicked with a pop and with a new stack of dying light applied while you were attempting to do a gen. 
---
Just waking up against this build isn't enough. Even working with someone else on the gen is totally boring, and overlong. If you haven't really played against a full dying light stacks + thanatophobia + ropes, you can't understand I guess.
---
Its a toxic cesspool of assholes who actually get off on trying to ruin other ppl experience...Moris are almost fking necessary because of SWF gen rush...its terrible...I am so sick of how games went from being about fun to being "I am gonna make this my job" mentality...its sickening...I blame Twitch and the "pro gaming" scene.
---
Wow, no why is it that people think weebs are tragic? I just can't seem to remember.
---
Nah, the game is literally dead. No more updates and the devs said they'll keep the servers up for a couple months more and that's it.
---
Wait was he nerfed?
---
You're right forgot but you should still have some free cosmetics for her.
---
Literal "Omae wa mou shinde iru" moment.
---
I run Shadowborn on every killer because it helps me see better, my eyesight is shit.
---
Ouch. Even that one huge update wasn't enough to save it I guess.
---
And there both right. Huntress on hawkin’s, trapper on rotten fields, bubba on any indoor map &amp; most killers on Ormond are a few both streamers mention a lot.
---
They are just not comparative whatsoever. There is a huge difference between calling someone blind or deaf and saying someone has severe developmental disabilities
---
I can agree with the last part. I went againts 4 Bills yesterday and only one of then had BT equipped
---
I'm a beast with ghosty it just gets boring after a while when u keep getting ez 4k's
---
My preferred build for most killers is BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Pop &amp; (something killer dependant), this on wraith let me win after letting them get a 4 gen head start as wraith.
---
I don't agree. I almost never run it and can constantly get near/to red ranks and I can 4k pretty easily. Then again I'm console and haven't played much on PC.
---
I actually forgot I was waiting on a match and finished a sink load of dishes.  I grabbed my switch in a panic  and I still hadn’t been given a game.
---
I despise with everything that I have the Badham maps. I get horrible frames there for no reason like what?
---
My favorite has to be Azarovs resting place or te temple of purgation
---
Love those guys!
---
I'm normally fine with reskins, but there's something about the ugly sweaters that makes them look off. They're too smooth and shiny for what should be wool.
---
4 gens aint enough
---
how can you just call me out like this
---
Why cant survivors actually have a unique ability like killers? I think it would be alot more interesting...(1 per team tho)...like Claud would be a better natural healer or something...
---
Its not a thing for months now.
---
Bill players are MVP.
---
No.
---
Corrupt doesn't actively do anything and means even bad Survivors can repair two gens by the time you get 1 hook.
---
Sure, Ruin can be cleansed within 30s, but it can also last a whole match.
---
I would say in most cases you get more value out of corrupt than you do Ruin. Corrupt is a guaranteed 2 min of zero progress on 3 gens. Of course the more valuable part of it is that it forces survivors to your side of the map. This makes killers that snowball like Oni, Nurse, &amp; Billy really effective with it. Ruin is hit or miss 90% of the time. They either cleanse it in the first 30 seconds or it's still up by the time the gates are open, rarely in-between.
---
I was really excited to play Oni but after all these nerfs and obvious favoring of Survivors, I think I’m going to take a break too. Just means I can focus on Pokémon Sword and Shield anyway. Maybe BHVR will get their heads out of their ass
---
Dedicated servers predicting what's going to happen
---
Yeah I really wish this was a thing too. But it's probably too late to implement such a sweeping change.
---
Thats definatley not the solution, it will be to easy for survivors at green ranks and absolutley impossible to win at red ranks, when this happen usually nobody pip or make more than 15k points but thats not a solution
---
Oink
---
I haven't used it in a while. I use Ruin most the time. It used to slow the survivors after the obsession was killed but now I see it has been changed. I guess I will use it again and see how it works as a combo. I apologize.
---
Nerfs, nerfs everywhere by BHVR.
---
BBQ and Thrilling? they do basically the same thing, not worth running both
---
1 per Team would create more toxicity ("leave you xy I wanted to play Claudette/ Yui/ David)
---
Giving survivor unique passive / ability / bonus would create a tier list and unbalance on the side of survivor. As well as pay to win mechanism because you NEED to buy the new survivor if she/he had a great "passiv". Right now perks can be ignored sins they are a lot of good perks that you can unlock for free but giving "unique" to survivor would change that.
---
Its an ability but..... cmon........
---
Google DBD submit ticket
---
It’s hard. Terribly hard. Now that I know there is a “blind the killer four times” challenge, I let people blind me as a killer. [This is my friend trying to use one the first time. ](https://twitter.com/allaboutsplat/status/1201666474177261568?s=21)
---
Overcharge its useless, even if somehow they miss the skillcheck still its a very small effect. Its depends on the killer. Territorial killers like Trapper and Hag get great value out of Corrupt, but for anyothers Ruin its problaby better
---
Damn he called you a stupid bitch watch...watch out we got a badass overhere.
---
Magnificent he's the entity
---
I don't think the ranking system is any different on a console, at least I haven't seen it being mention anywhere. I have been playing this game since June 2016 and have 1.7k hours in-game and probably double that on this subreddit. I think with time you'll get better and those seemingly good survivors will not be so good in your eyes any more. Yes, there are some survivors  that their whole intent is to take you on long chases and their whole perk setup is designed for it but majority is not as good as that.
---
Just seems like a game logging place u could Google it and see if it's a hosting place bc if u haven't seen this before I'd assume it's either dedicated servers related or the new dc penalty tool
---
This comment is underrated
---
It's "Bhvronline".
---
Clearly it's something with Dead by Daylight.
---
This concept is so good. Well done!
---
Ruin gets cleansed within 1 min most games anyway though and then I only have 3 perks left.
---
Couldn't agree with this more
---
Yeah I have my on rule with ds and that is if I feel bad for the survivor (or the game is too short) I check if they have ds by picking them up, if not I just drop them and let them go.
---
Like I have said to every one of these post it's way to late to give survivors unique abilities bc since 1. People who don't play just survivor could have Survivor with a ability they aren't gonna use like for example what if Jake could sabo without sabo well I never sabo and I like Jake skins this is useless 2. Personally if my Meg got a ability I don't like I want a refund for all the cosmetics I've bought.
---
Point is too late for this feature to be added
---
wonderful, love it. im using it now.
---
Even if it has, I love it. Thank you
---
EPITAPH
---
Might be the former. I haven't had anyone DC in my games today, and I don't generally DC myself.
---
They should change discordance to highlight the gen for a same duration on all levels and give and extra 5%/10%/15% slower repair speed if survivors are staking on gens (it shouldnt pop up for them tho)
---
Calm down he has a max of 2 IQ at most, and we all know that shit takes way more IQ than that mate.
---
God we need one
---
The answer is trickled down balance if it works for high tier games it will work for low tier games that's how all games with a competitive setting balance their games.
---
But then again DBD isn't supposed to be competitive
---
Best stabby
---
She's not as bad as how people are portraying her here.
---
I want all 5 then and deal lmao that sounds like a fun challenge tbh
---
Ranking up as killer becomes incredibly difficult because you have to beat 4 gens. Changing the game based on rank is nonsensical. The increase in difficulty is supposed to be your fellow players, not the actual game mechanics.
---
Well there goes my more unique mask
---
Debatable
---
Just play Civ V
---
Rank does not matter. AT ALL. Granted i aint playing with a rank 20 cause i wanna actually win. But rank does absolutely nothing. Ive seen red rank killers that get outplayed on the safest of safe pallets. (Trying to mind game a safe pallet is stupid)
---
I don't know what you're smoking but I want some. AFAIK developers balance the game around 2 dies and 2 escape. Currently, the average of kills between all killers is 70-75% at red ranks. All of your suggestions are about making major changes to survivors without balancing killers at the same time.
---
Your best source of power is hitting uninjured survivors anyway. You'll always be able to get couple to get last 2%. 
---
Glove now have synergy with more blood orb add-ons. You can see healing survivors for like 10 secs after healing. this is insane
---
Glove is still his best add-on
---
If it’s 1 time use possibly
---
I just ruin as diversion so I can place more traps and hopefully win in mid game
---
You do know the devs said not to draw any conclusions about balance from the data they released right?
---
He'll see your ass all the time if you don't heal, sweetheart
---
No idea what's going on, but I do remember like a year or two ago in a DbD match when I was newer, OhTofu (who I did not know was a big streamer until I went to report him), his wife, and two of his buddies were killer + the other three survivors and what first appeared to be me just being sandbagged by some random asshats, then it became clear they were working with the killer, and then I was held hostage with them refusing to allow me to escape and also farming me/bleeding me out.
---
Which is when I found out he's a pretty shitty guy who was actually a big streamer, and for some reason he never got any of the shit that other "toxic" streamers like Ochido or Noob3 got. 
---
My report didn't do a fucking thing to them cause I didn't record it unfortunately and they were not streaming. So I'm kind of just enjoying that people are starting to call them out for whatever reason lmao
---
You know what’s even more crazy is that you could’ve just skipped over this but naw instead you had to say something you think was intelligent. 
---
If you don’t remember asking then why would you click on the post? 
---
Also he’s not making it just for you don’t be on that special shit mate. 
---
Wow that’s crazy mate you are a imbecile.
---
I like running corrupt more because my ruin tends to get broken in the lobby. At least you know how long you have corrupt for and its not a gamble.
---
And happy Friday The 13th to you mate.
---
Adding more gens will make it harder for killer. They’d have to add 2 more gens so you can’t 2 gen yourself. Then it means it’s a lot harder to apply pressure. Just increased times by 5-10 seconds per rank
---
He isn't even top 5 now. This will just make it worse...
---
Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Ghostface, Huntress, arguably Hag and Myers...
---
Playing red ranks is not a fun experience, its the sweatest and tryhards, not playing for fun at all
---
It's available through shards too
---
I need to rebuy my Susie skin but it’s worth it
---
That data is the only source of legit information about the current state of the game everything else is thoughts and feelings. Trash killers will complain their survivors escape more than they would like and trash survivors will complain they don't escape as much as they would like. The data simply shows that all killers are above 50% threshold and that is what's important. Legion might not be a top killer but they still get those 2 kills on average, when the legion is going to get changed it's because he's not fun to play as and not fun to play against, as well as he requires more effort to do well than the rest of the killers, not because he kills less than 2 on average.
---
Agreed. Stealth killers are the best. I love, love, love going up against jump scare Myers. I had a recent match where me and a friend were on Discord and the only two Survivors left in the match against a jump scare Myers. We were both hiding at the top of that tall building in the Ironworks of Misery map too scarred to leave. Every time we heard footsteps approaching we both squeezed into the corner behind those wooden boxes and Myers at one point came right over but we were just out of view. I didn't feel like it was Dead By Daylight anymore. Never had such an intense match.
---
She is a default survivor only on consoles tho
---
There’s 2 of us?! Woohoo! I feel like I met a lost sibling or something!
---
Because I’m an altruistic bitch. Sounds like a paradox, me using self-care because I’m altruistic. But I like to tank hits for my teammates, running straight at the killer to bait a swing or just plain take one to the face and run off. Self-Care allows me to do that more often because I don’t have to go out of my way to find a teammate to heal me.
---
Of course I sometimes just get into the fray while injured, sometimes you don’t have the time to self-care, but sometimes the time it takes to find a teammate is longer than the time it takes me to self-care while hitting mostly great skillchecks.
---
No but really, we have 2 chainsaw based killers. Why not two clowns who cause hallucinations?
---
“excuse me, you're blocking my hatches"
---
He is definitely better than Myers and Huntress.
---
Hey mate, nice to meet you, we can be stalking buddies
---
I'd be much happier if being hit didn't cancel your unhooking animation. There's a special level of confusion when I think I should've finished the animation and I'm hurt without having completed the save, then I'm downed when shit catches up.
---
What the fuck?
---
That was not a true Pig.
---
How did he got nerfed? I nearly lose every round to every round to him lol
---
Drugs
---
yea true plus even 2% faster would still be a balance problem like ffs just 3% is enough for a killer to always close the gap
---
Lily:
---
Low Blow: too many requirements, but if had less, it’s easy to bully killers with. Hard to balance. Underpowered right now
---
Swift Escape: why uninjured? Also, let’s make it more of a BHVR perk. Always 5 seconds, 60/50/40s cooldown 
---
Legacy: bhvr would probably set the vaules to always max and stack the “maximum of tokens” but I like it more the way you did it
---
I know that’s just a saying but you do realize boomers are in their 70s and unlikely to have a 17-year-old right? I’m just asking.
---
Don't prestige until you use up your items.
---
I would add this to We'll Make It. Also, like mentioned, hits shouldn't cancel the unhooking aswell.
---
The Hallowed Blight event with the event skin for Wraith is absolutely gorgeous. So much roots and glow particles on him.
---
Am I the only one here that enjoys playing red ranks? I get challenged much more and have to play better since some teammates are just useless.
---
I don't really see many moris or dcs but maybe I'm just lucky.
---
Only thing that annoys me is that I usually get matched with Russian killers that have a worse ping and many are pretty toxic.
---
Bex:
---
Hold Your Head High is currently a worse Stake Out. Someone failing a skillcheck is rare on higher ranks and should be more rewarding. Max 3/4/5 tokens, get 2 tokens per failed skillcheck
---
In Synch: Make it more like Leader. Set range to 8m but make the effect persist for 15 seconds after leaving eachother. Add a line about being able to only be affected by one at the time. Maybe buff tier 1 and 2 values to 8/12/15%
---
I always attempt to boop the snoot often risking the entire game just to boop it
---
Most ban systems don't work on a one report basis. It's going to take multiple reports from multiple people to even get one of the mods to look into it. Additionally BHVR has the easy anti cheat program added to their game. This program looks for third party programs running in the background of your computer that are modifying your games connection. If you have nothing running and you do get a crapton of reports thanks to the bug they will be able to see that it was a bug. TLDR: it's unlikely that getting a speed boost because of a bug will get you banned.
---
Something that everyone always wanted.
---
Not a good idea to do it, though. The devs already have an unbalanced game.
---
And for the people who say it would create a meta, I don't really think so. I think most people play the Survivors that they like and I'm sure people wouldn't leave their favourite just because one has a better passive. I would never leave my Jane even if she had the worst passive.
---
Usually yes, if you want to have more than 20k points for that game
---
Well I'm scared now.
---
Sarah:
---
Pigtail Demon: BHVR likes the activation to stay the same and the effect/cooldown to scale. Always 35s, blind for 3/4/5s, 100s cooldown OR Always 35s and 5s blind, make cooldown scale to 140/120/100
---
honestly at this point what's the need to have a rarity system if brown/yellow add-ons get used more often then purple/iridescent add-ons. good iridescent add-ons I can think of off the top of my head: Bloody Coil, Iridescent Stone, Coxcomb is decent, Iridescent Head, and that's it.
---
i believe the clown dlc is called Curtain call
---
Behavior's doing well, fucking shit up, as usual.
---
You mean T H I C C
---
I'm on console as well, it's great that you can get 4ks without it but I feel like wraith has pretty much nothing good to show without windstorm. Windstorm gives wraith map pressure which is extremely viable and helps him catch up to survivors who are far from him. Vanilla wraith is really slow when cloaked you might as well not even go invisible. The surprise factor becomes less and less effective the more you go against better players since they can usually easily glimpse your shimmer (most maps are also big open maps with widened fov's which does not help).

And like that my friends, we should avoid this whole mess. Let's just watch some wholesome DBD streamers that aren't related to this fuck fest. Just let it simmer down and in a way let this be a lesson to any major figure, careful what you say on ther internet, don't be toxic and just enjoy the game for what it is. Monto always seems to cheer me up with his randomness. Noob3 is another candidate, but is a good toxic person that's in it for the memes and always dies. Otz is another guy too. He really breaks down every engagement for both the killer's and survivors' perspective.

Just make Gens take 10 seconds more. And put the time for gens with two or more people up aswell. That way the killer can get his first down quicker and start pressure before he's being pressured.
---
Though that would probably completely ruin the games with idiot teammates that are scared of doing gens. Got another solution for this. Make piping harder for survivors so all these scared survivors keep out of red ranks.
---
why hello there
---
Why is this pig so much scarier
---
Ds is literaly a force field that makes you invincible for 1 minute and lets you do alot of bold plays in the killer face and he cant do more than slug you, and not even that if you have unbreakable
---
I mean...they put out killers that cost real world money...that are amazing...esp now
---
its just like ppl who still play the worst killers in the game...simply because they like the way they look...so i concur with you
---
*quality DC
---
Pre-mades in any game have advantage, can’t put people who wanna play with friends at a disadvantage, that’d ruin the game and community
---
I got myers his pipe and hospital shirt
---
What the hell are you talking about mate?
---
EXACTLY...i just get angry seeing ppl in red ranks that play like lvl 16-20...like you dont have to be a loop master but when i see noone doing gens and hiding and ppl who do gens missing multiple skill checks its irritating....need a way to keep low skill players out of high ranks
---
well it can ruin the experience for the one solo killer....if they want to be toxic...which is common...just the truth...
---
a solution needs to come about
---
Believe it or not, if you crank up controller sensitivity on killer, you can "super-steer" at the beginning of the chainsaw run better, even in mouse and keyboard.
---
I'm in red ranks and all I get are green ranks and purple ranks.
---
Bhvr u okay?
---
I had a game like this as against a Ghost face.
---
No NoED but against a Ghost Face
---
Nea was hooked in the basement on the other side of the map on The Game. I ran all the way to the other corner, Unhooked her, and we ran out and Ghost Face got me exposed but I was able to narrowly escape him until we got up stairs and a room away from the exit Nea gets out, and I accept my fate...
---
Then he walked me over to the gate and let me free.
---
So, I had some thoughts about it yesterday.  
---
While I was a killer in green ranks, I would get exclusively purple or red ranks. So, I thought... yeah, there's a cap of +/-6 ranks for matchmaking. Being matched with higher ranks just means that there are no green rank survivors available, right?
---
  
---
BUT
---
Then I got down to yellow ranks... and I started to get green rank survivors. They exist. They are available (actually I'm one of them). But the game matches a lower ranked killer with higher ranked survivors. It's seemingly intended to be matched with survivors of a higher rank color. It's not matchmaking failing... it's working like that on purpose.
---
As a side note: Ranks do not necessarily represent skill. I had purple ranks, who I really thought to be grey ranks while playing the match (and I mean, I'm a green rank, but I play like a grey rank, too). But still, it's more likely to get skilled survivors in higher ranks than in lower ranks, so it is still a pain to play against people who are several ranks higher than me.
---
No dont do it
---
No, just get better as killer. If you get bullied it
---
clearly shows your aren’t good. That’s not swf being strong that’s you being weak. You make it sound like every swf is try Harding
---
I would kill for ash’s Christmas sweater
---
I thought his 180 flicks were kind of insane when I first saw them but I really didn't see them much in the ptb
---
Yeah I'm red rank and I play against greens all the time and even saw a gray once.
---
Probably because Jeremy Renner is a huge sack of shit
---
whispers activates for the person on hook too
---
Exactly!
---
Thanks, I really appreciate this. It’s some great stuff!
---
Multiple objectives for survivors instead of just doing gens. It would be more fun for survivors, and slow the game down so killers don't have to use ruin all the time.
---
I feel like the most fun to play killer is at purple or high green ranks because you'll get mostly purple rank survivors and not reds which are 100% tryhards
---
Context. The It from It isn’t a clown. His true form is more like a Japanese spider crab from outer space and he basically just takes the form of things that scare kids and is partial to the clown. I think there’s an actual reason why It prefers the clown, but it’s been so long that I can’t remember.
---
Yup, it's very hard to hit purple/red with killer so it's a wasteland there, most reds usually play green killers (out of range mostly) so if you're in red range you'll have below one minute q times.
---
don’t get why so many people think this is a huge nerf. They also got buffs. Been having nothing but 4ks with them. Save the best for last wasn’t anything special on legion and ardetha could agree with me on that. Sloppy was good on them but it’s not a huge deal not having it anymore. T.phobia still works on them so.Oh and they also vault faster and it’s overall smoother now?I’ll take it. My personal build is monitor,nurses,ruin,and brutal strength. Legion is a hell of a lot better than hag,doctor,pig,and leatherface in my opinion.
---
Calling someone disabled as a joke doesn’t mean that disabled people are a joke.  Are you twelve?  Did you ever take a speech class?
---
Of course it's not a basic attack, it's tied to a form where the killer can dash 4 times faster than the survivor.
---
People can joke about whatever the fuck is funny.  Stop being a gatekeeper.
---
Nah we don't need survivor perks to be telegraphed, if they did that then the community would want killer perks to be telegraphed also. This idea is a lot more beneficial for Survivors and a lot more detrimental for Killers.
---
Nurse, Billy, and Huntress are widely considered some of the best killers in the game (and even wraith now too) and they all come with base game, what's your point?
---
"How it feels to chew 5 Gum..."
---
Oof. I always expected "pros" don't bother about cosmetics but show their "superiority" by the P3 outfits.
---
Me though, rank 4-5 noob on PS4 (I have no idea how i get there. It's just... after one or two weeks after reset I'm up there again. I feel like it's just the amount of time you invest that you will rank up anyway) with cosmetics cuz I'm a fukking aesthetic b*tch.
---
If you're good at the game you can pick up on perks semi easily.
---
Helloooo nurse!
---
Have you never gone against an ebony mori? Holy Fuck I seriously cannot believe what I’m reading. Even the green mori is just as bad. It’s a FREE WIN. How in the fuck is that fun for the survivor or the killer? The survivors lose points and the killer loses points. No one benefits from it. Everyone sighs and groans when they’re 2 minutes into the game and someone gets killed.
---
So you acknowledge that you have to guess about perks on either side, but they're somehow not part of a guessing game?
---
Also, it isn't the same, as many killer perks, like hex perks or debuffs, provide survivors with information, whereas no survivor perks do the same, except maybe if you count No Mither.
---
Legit happens to me all the time as well (legion main here) and it gets really annoying when someone calls me a tunneler or a camper when they force me to take a Decisive or they all bomb rush the person I just hooked (very unwise against my legion since I use the legion pin add-on constantly now).
---
Most of the time I just slug someone that just got unhooked so they can still play for a bit and enjoy the match and I try to avoid tunneling someone unless they played like a cunt the whole match, teabag and click your flashlight at me constantly  and I'm leaving you slugged on the ground the whole match
---
That’s pretty much been my take.
---
Knock Out, Infectious Fright, Deerstalker, Ruin. 
---
This build is quite popular.
---
He always looks so sad :(
---
Jesse's heroin scene in BB
---
thank you I've been blessed
---
The memes of people on Twitter calling him special ed are pretty funny
---
Its not usefull? It even helps survivor on working on more than 1 gens at the same time .
---
i play dwight for the memes
---
I mean, the same was true for outsmarting Spirit, but not everyone is good at the game, so it really ought to be changed!
---
I’m sorry you think someone not wanting to educate you for free is being a cunt. You must be PISSED at private schools lol
---
As survivor I hit red ranks every season because I'm not bad, but more because it's too easy even when I try not to double pip. I was happy every rank reset so I can chill a bit more.. but now I will get stuck in red ranks.
---
But as a Killer I don't know. I was once a Killer main, then switched to survivor and now I play both sides like 60/40 but the people are much better than a year ago here on console. But I play more for fun and play many different killers, so maybe it's the reason why I'm not that skilled. Hope the new rank reset will not push me more and more into the better ranks, even when I'm not ready for that :/
---
i like true and watch his videos now and then,but it’s ironic when people mention anyone that has an opinion against him as them being in a “i hate true circle jerk” like his followers aren’t solo jerking him off. Literally taking “circle jerk” from when he mentioned it way back when on twitter and over using the fuck of it
---
He literally badmouths other streamers and plays the victim. 
---

---
Sorry, but NO streamer should badmouth anyone else. Goes for anyone speaking on a public platform. If you have an issue, take it to them directly. You don't need an audience to resolve a problem.
---
Yo Hag is definitely better, she's hard to play though.
---
If i see a jeff when playing killer, I will not hit them
---
Rank 50? Christ, I was only at the late 30s before I started attempting the fuck out of that endgame unhook one.
---
'Educate you' pepega. I asked for a fucking link dude, I called you a cunt for being a pompous twat and responding like one. You gotta chill.
---
Bruh keep tht twitch chat shit in the app. Google would give it to you would be infinitely faster. You just wanna be spoon fed.
---
You can tell they have dead hard when they're turning their heads behind them to see when the right time to Dead hard is. Ds you can tell when they jump in a locker just after they get unhooked, or they're cocky and in your face. Sprint burst when they walk as you come toward them. Balanced landing when they get to a high point. Prove thyself when you just started the game and 3 gens are already done. Borrowed time when they rush a save and you're around the hook. No mither when they start the game broken. 
---
I mean, there are plenty of signs for experienced players to pick up on and know what survivors are using. 😇
---
When did this happen?
---
red ranks is filled with quitters, try hards, reparators and M1 Players.... purple rank is ok, the best rank to play IMO is green, good balance between decent players and queue time, also ive seen way better players both sided, killers and survivors, on green rank, for me green is the go rank to play, at least thats my opinion, and at least on ps4,
---
I was asking for -your- source. Google is a good source of information, yes, but it's also filled with misinformation and buzzfeed articles. I wanted to be thorough. My time's just as important as yours, but here we are both wasting each other's as if it wouldn't have been faster for you to get a helpful first response, or not respond at all.
---
This is a horrible idea, it's not hard to remember if someone has dead hard after they use it the first time, same for balanced landing, this is a case of get good.
---
Actually I’m having your responses play over the loud speaker through text to speech at work and even my coworkers are laughing at how you respond. So you’re not wasting my time. Only your own. Feel free to keep replying.
---
The beginning is exactly why I have a "FUCK YOU" build I swap to (P3 doctor with Jigsaw Piece and 3-gen build + Franklin's or Ebony Mori Iri Head Huntress with Franklin's) if survivors quickswap like that.
---
Are people actually still talking about that lame shit? Pig got that fix a long time ago along with every other damn killer in the game and not a single person said a god damn thing. For some fucked reason legion was the exception to the secondary abilities don't apply status effects and y'all go ape shit crying about a "nerf." Legion has been nothing but a fucking nuisance in the game since they released him since he's done nothing but be able to cheese game mechanics and when the devs fix it y'all really call it a nerf? What in the fuck makes you think it's ok for only legion to be able to apply status effects of perks with their secondary abilities and no other killer. 
---
This pig main is dying to know what's up with the fake outrage.
---
Mhmm, totally, and my dad works for Microsoft and he's going to ban you from Fortnite.
---
I respect your opinion. I find hag easier to survive against and weaker to play as than legion however. For one,hags biggest power move is her ability to pressure hooks with her traps and capitalizing on inexperienced teammates who trigger traps like there’s no tomorrow. Now,with a good team,you could run circles around a hag and have a teammates going around either triggering all the traps or using a flashlight to disable them. In solo que she still isn’t much of a threat unless she has increased teleportation add-ons. If she sets a trap just run away 😂she isn’t catching up with that 110 movement speed

---
It would activate, effective against the DS Headon people
---
Thank you, I have been wondering about it for like a minute
---
*sigh* all people talk about are his "nerfs" when they never actually intended his frenzy attacks to count as basic attacks and decrease the mend time/change deep wounds, yet when they did all this they gave him buffs as well, increasing his frenzy speed a little bit, increasing his vaulting speed a fair bit, changing the button add-ons so that they are actually useable (legion pin is amazing and arguably one of his best add-ons), and increased the added duration from add-ons a little bit
---
My main problem with both tools is, they offer no counter play. Both keys and moris also share the same problem, that they allow you to "cheat" for a victory otherwise not earned. Not to mention, both these items are unfun to go against.
---
Yes, but my point was that contrary to all other hexes, HG already gives use when cleansed
---
If you want to buff it, you could make it so one person is exposed until HG is cleansed, at which point all other three survivors are exposed
---
How do you switch to the build if the survivors 6 second switch?
---
I would also like the template
---
It's hilarious, expect some DCs though
---
When/where did they confirm that date? I thought they said it was originally the 10th. Not trying to discredit the info, I'm just curious.
---
Have my cursor over the killer, the millisecond I see/hear the survivor fade out I click.
---
I could trap Dwight in the locker forever
---
Uses all meta perks on killers, yet complains when survivors use meta perks. I don't know why he plays the game so often if he hates it this much.
---
You can check the in game news tab for it but I'll try and find a post about it from BHVR.
---
I’ll be playing normally not focusing on anyone then I’ll get DS’d by someone who was unhooked a whole 59 seconds ago and I’ll throw the game just to kill the survivor for disrespecting me.
---
Clearly you were just outplayed by the killer's connection. How you couldn't predict it is beyond me.
---
no at this point I think BHVR is trying to make the game balanced with the edition of Dedicated Servers like if they didn't want this game to go in the direction people want they could have stuck with P2P. 
---
Like I would be fine if this game became balanced for competitive I love this game just as long as BHVR can understand we just need trickled down balance that literally if it works for higher tier gamers in DBD it will work for lower tier people. Look at camping a higher tier survivor will know that it is better to do gens and have 3 people get out rather thank 3 people rush 1 guy and probably die. But bc these dumb challenges people do not give a shit.
---
Better players are more likely to break your game you are forced to balance it around them
---
Did you make this after playing a game on Xbox? Swear I just played against you if so
---
Seriously tho, add-ons that used to affect healing speed are useless now. Plus 150% bps on great skillchecks is a joke.
---
"Yea, welcome to the club pal"
---
BBQ is a after match boost so it is very possible but yes 32k is max points
---
Any tips for playing him i want to play him but im shit with him
---
I honestly like the idea but like ive said it is too late to add this since that would again be another balance problem to deal with and we have enough.
---
more like she took the easy way out of embarrassment
---
What would be his perks and power tho?
---
I love this lol. It's always the pig fan art that's best
---
Huh, either they changed that or I'm just stupid. Thank you very much!
---
You also getting depleted in 10 seconds of the match?
---
That's the gamble. Occasionally, Ruin lasts way longer than that.
---
Only update we need to make NOED more balance is to introduce totems to be displayed as gens while it is already hard to find all 4 totems on 1 map knowing how many people have done a single totem is impossible and knowing if a killer has NOED or not is impossible so doing 1 leads u to doing all 4 imo NOED should maybe have some noise notification for everyone or show the killers location once all the gens are done and say "hey noed is in the game" but removing noed would be just as fine it is not even worth the perk slot imo
---
Yeah, there are multiple reasons i dont watch him. Altough if i dont like a streamer, i dont watch them. And sure as hell wont take my time making a video about them.
---
Is it just me or is legion neither fun to play nor play against? I'd ask for a rework but I feel like the scorn of legion mains would be upon me.
---
This is perfect lol
---
Come and join me in the yellow ranks anything fun could happen im just a shit killer
---
legit I hate adren bc every time I have used it it has been moments I would have been better off using just DH. But personally my new fav build is Sprint Burst, Resilience, Iron Will and Adren but on this build it is only bc I saw it as a looping build where Sprint Burst already gets used to get into a favorable position to loop the killer at that point Adren works good
---
because the doctor already fits the role of the second one
---
Yamaoka maps worst in game change my mind
---
Thank you for this because I’ve been trying to figure out how many of what things I need to do in a match to pip/get decent bps!
---
So? We have multiple killers who pour into other killers
---
I agree about adrenaline popping when I want to use my actual exhaustion perks and it being annoying. I've been enjoying sprint burst because Yui hasn't been able to get dead hard.

---
I just became a ghostie! So I really love this 💕
---
Ghost face players are the best killers imo, they’re usually always really fair if they’re not friendly or they’re just straight up there for memes!
---
man you had me until i checked the flair
---
In my mouth 😩😩
---
Yeah, i agree. Still the race for the hatch is killer sided and also a matter of luck most of the time, so I do think the key for the last survivor works.
---
And yeah, the main thing is they both are very very unfun and unfair. Asking for a safety pip when it comes to moris/keys is not outrageous either imo
---
Indeed
---
A ghost face legitimately almost gave me a heart attack. I was repairing a gen and out of NOWHERE I’m grabbed. I actually shrieked 😂
---
What is baby survs?
---
Well you know you gotta toss an s out there mate I don’t know how you think from how you type yet.
---
I've yet to see a Nea that looks good. It's like a 50-way-tie between all her lurid crap.
---
Fine by me.
---
Plague is probably the most recent unique thing we have. The issue is they tried to completely remake the chase mechanics for Legion and it's been a cancerous fiasco ever since.
---
New/bad survivors.

You would be surprised how twisted a sense of fun can be, then

U have all the corn maps

honestly hit it twice and then just waited for rank reset cause I always ran into the same Japanese nurse who entirely would obliterate me and my friends.
---
Thank You for that awesome Wallpaper
---
Yep you have no idea how balance works. Let me guess you think bbqc isn't broken though
---
It's Twitter...
---
I really like Swamp as both sides, don't understand the hate tbh. I think it has some of the best unique structures, open enough with low debris and raised vantage points to not be overly stealthy, but still lots of bushes and reeds for stealth to work. And it looks great!
---
super cute
---
Im both red rank 1 with killer 2 with surv, ps4, killer lobbies are literally instant, surv lobbies take  like 10/15 min constant, it seems like u can never get a quick one, because you will get a couple with 200+ ping which idk why the game even gets u in those lobbies when its obvious thats unplayable.
---
Waiting to play killer that's a damn shame.
---
Unprofessional.. it's Twitter not a freaking conference
---
There's worse things on Twitter to call out that are worse. He just expressed his opinion, very calmly too while others actually shit talked him making fun of him and every person who has disabilities for example
---
No BBQ isn't broken since it's quite easy to counter you only have to go into a locker. Iri hatches are litteraly just free downs without requiring more skill to use them.
---
?
---
Did I hurt your feelings or something?
---
Did that once with 2 survivors left. So while I was chasing 1 survivor the one trapped in the locker decided to DC. Toxic af, just because their 'burst' 'ds' combo didn't play out like they thought
---
&gt;Pig got that fix a long time ago along with every other damn killer in the game and not a single person said a god damn thing
---
This isn't true, everyone was upset about pig nerfs too. Both of these situations were hurting already very weak killers and we're completely unnecessary.
---
Yes let’s make “stealth” killers super loud again.
---
trapper is among the most common killers my dude
---
how? at high ranks i barrely see one because he is  not strong
---
It’s his living ? He gets money for it.
---
Mum help I'm being bulled
---
Dude, real shit! I feel really really bad if I didn't find the NOED and have to let the survivor die. Most of the time I will trade places with them, I know they will be fine because I run BT all the time. As long as they survived, I'm okay with it. 
---
There's this one game in coldwind, a survivor got downed by NOED and I know where it is since I brought rainbow map and already cleansed the other outer totems. The other 2 teammates left because of the NOED Sadly, the survivor was hooked nearby the totem. I got the totem since the killer was facecamping, and ran towards the hook while the killer got corn visioned and ran pass me, saved the survivor within the terror radius for BT and get out. I always feel accomplished whenever I got this kind of save
---
So he needs to do something else. If I hated my job that much I'd get a different job.
---
Something something licenses, unfortunately.
---
Next patch Legion can pallet stun themselves for negative points.
---
Oof that’s a really weird glitch. There’s a lot of weird things that happen due to lag
---
Good shitpost but I'm sad now :(
---
Ghostface
---
I’m the same way, I always run borrowed time and I feel better trading places with them as long as I got them saved.
---
Idea of curses is good, but HG and noed are to op for me
---
With 2 gens 2 unhooks 2 totems and a bit of chase you get to rank 1 in no time. Then you get sweaty tryhard Killers that run ebony all the time and drop down
---
Well he had a point original DS was cancer
---
Easy money I suppose,
---
Sees Dwight fail
---
“Aw he’s just a baby”
---
Sees Nea fail
---
REEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeeEeEEeeEeEeEeeEeEeeEeEeEeEeeEeeEeEe

I know, hence why I said they changed it to that since they more than likely didn't intend it to be that way
---
Well, somebody said it. Must be true.
---
Nurse is B tier now...so is Huntress...Billy is the only A tier killer on your list...Wraith is a solid C and a D without the correct addons...dont know where you are coming from...
---
And the point is you tried to say it would make it so you feel obligated to get certain survivors because they may be "OP"...so I countered and said the same thing can be said of killers...ESP Freddy now...who is A tier.
---
What a fucking dickhead, seriously dropped so sharply into shithead territory

Yeah, this would help so much, but we can expect this in 2 years, knowing the devs

Well, at least you only went for a shower. I went out for 4 hours for a movie + dinner, only to come home to  post game chat, survivors accusing me of deranking.
---
I was playing in a room that had a skylight and it was so hard to see, I actually got caught by the killer because I was trying to run through a window. I thought it was a door.
---
I haven't but I could give it a shot in later
---
Skillcheck?
---
Don’t be scared of the killer, and learn how to run loops.
---
Here we see that legion isn‘t that bad^^ My win percentage with legion (me playing) is like 90%
---
Demogorgon main here, Mew's guts is literally better than all the other add-ons
---
To me the idea that all gens can be done in 5-6 minutes while killer is applying pressure is ludicrous, Moris are ludicrous, maps with structures that cant be played around in multiplayer games are ludicrous. Oni was fine as he was imo. High skill cap killers should be able to down people fast.
---
I swear to God I've walked past so many people in the open and in and game chat people went "did u not see me?" I was like "wait there was Survivors in this game?"
---
This is dead by daylight.
---
NICE.  
---
Suggestion: add a survivor face on the other side looking up at him kinda like AVP.  
---
Suggestion 2: Add the back of someone's head infront of his face, on the other side of the logo, so it looks like he is stalking them (breathing down their necks).
---
It's obvious that we all know that OhTofu's wife October made the comment and EdgarAlan joined in on the dogpile. So let me make this perfectly clear in the event that someone decides to screencap it and send it to either of them. I want to break this comment into parts so its easy to understand each of the points I make:
---
# What's been said has been said:
---
I don't hate either of them for what they said. Personally, it is not my call or my judgment to make with how they interact with other people part of gaming communities. I enjoy Edgar's content regularly and on the off times October streams, I enjoy them. I'm not being a kissass. I know EXACTLY how it feels to say something in the heat of the moment. I lost someone very special to me. And I know how it feels to go into fight or flight. BoxGhostz was getting flak. So they did what any good friend would do, stand up for her. And I can respect it that they had the courage to face the mass head-on. Tru3 literally stated that BoxGhostz had "Little Intelligence". Come on man. You're only sparking the flames
---
# That doesn't mean its acceptable:
---
It still doesn't excuse what was said, however. Look. I know its cool and hip to make fun of people who say dumb things. But Tru3 OPENLY states that his DM's are open for discussion. He is LITERALLY opening his arms and saying "You are free to talk to me and I won't bash you for doing so". A lot of people complain about not being civil and yet when someone like Tru3 does open up, he's blasted to next year. What do you people want? Do you just expect us to stay quiet? Do you expect us to just curl up and cry? 
---
# Tru3 isn't the smartest tool in the shed, however:
---
Personally, to an extent, Tru3 isn't exactly batting a thousand when it comes to ideas and opinions about the game. I think the reason Tru3 thinks Wraith is top tier is because of being able to run the new Dying Light, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher and Ruin, along with either Shadow Dance or Windstorm add-ons. And by all means! That's a good build! I can see he's picking up the slack the Wraith has with some good perks! But sadly, that doesn't make Wraith top when it comes to the Wraith's power being good. Wraith is without a doubt fun to play. But Wraith being strong is still up for debate. 
---
#  October and Edgar's Apology:
---
Since the original situation, as of when this has been posted, they have both apologized. Granted they never apologized at Tru3 for what they said, but they at least apologized for their supposed "jokes". If the majority thought it was a poor take, its best to just stand on the podium and apologize. And I can respect that. 
---
# What we can do: 
---
For starters, we can let it go. We can stop giving them hate and we will NOT go into their streams and throw hate their way. If we want them to "Be better" we gotta put our hands out first and let them improve. Let them move past it and understand that they know what they said was bad. We are not solving anything by giving them the hassle. Again, I want to make it VERY clear that I don't hate anyone in this whole situation. I respect everyone involved but also hold everyone involved to a high standard. I can only hope sometime down the line they all decide to at least talk it out and solve any issues they may have with one another.
---
Used to be freddy but forever freddy got fixed so i dont give a shit now, maybe ghostface?
---
Yep that build works well. Your 4th perk could be Boil Over :)
---
Yes, it does - clearly, you have neither attended joke classes, sociology classes, or English classes because not only is it a shitty “joke” (guess what? Saying something is a joke does not absolve you of consequences nor is it a fuzzy blanket to hide your bigotry and cowardice under.) but if you call someone disabled as a joke, clearly you think disability and disabled people are a joke otherwise you wouldn’t try to “joke” about it - and in scumbag October’s case , she was clearly trying to mock and demean, and she was using disabled people to do it. 
---
Grow the hell up and learn some kindness, empathy, and understanding you little edgelord clown school dropout.

---
Pathetic
---
Similar thing happened to me yesterday. I was struggling to get to rank 4 before reset. I lost 3 pips/games in a row. So when everyone in my team came and body blocked the hook the killer was taking me too, I was very happy. We all ran to the gate and won.
---
any killer that's like: "it's a matter of when, not if" he's gonna get you.
---
Like legion was on release and now it's ghostface, not sure how is he on PC but on Switch with its tiny screen you can look around all you want you still get exposed.
---
"1 blendette ah ah ah, 2 blendettes ah ah ah"
---
I'm a pink hair Nea and I kinda suck...
---
me too
---
Cosmetic-wise, Frank's mask would be a head cosmetic and could be changed. The other three masks would be part of the overall body cosmetic and would basically be static.
---
&gt;"superiority" by the P3
---
Play P3 Blendette and you deserve to be morried. Tis the law.
---
I just started swingin
---
Just some shading and I think it will pop more but very nice art
---
Gross...nice!
---
Flicking was correcting a mistake, you started running a loop with the thought in mind that you gonna flick just like you loop with dead hard knowing you will use it.
---
Litteraly every single Ghost Face I've played against just camps a random gen and when someone gets to it they crouch slowly towards it to scare the shit out of you
---
Ara Ara time
---
Just like how people play the most optimal killers? I already see way too many Spirits.   
---
I'm half joking by the way, I don't like the idea either. But I always thought the problem exists on the killer side too so it's not a good reason to \*not\* do it.
---
Is that a mother fucking dr stone reference?
---
I do think the nerf was necessary but people didnt like it so you gonna get downvoted to hell
---
You shouldn’t have been mori’d, just incapacitated
---
yeah but one thing i can respect about noob3 is that he is respectful and actually acknowledges when he is being toxic i see alot of dbd youtubers who are always trying to be a cocky know it all veteran where as noob3 actually just plays for fun and entertainment of his fans
---
Yeah, I definitely agree! I usually only draw in black and whites, but with this particular drawing it was hard to make out what was what, so I did a quick (I say quick, but I did this over the course of two weeks) colored version to kinda get across what I am going for
---
Yesterday I was doing a hex and I actually heard wraith's footsteps and got off before he could bodyblock me. It was on mother's dwelling. Sound isn't completely gone.
---
Nah this guy had the add on that lets him instantly choke you sensually then stab you, he didnt hit anyone all game, just stalked for 3-4 gens.
---
Well it's impressive to a guy that can't be happy about his drawings of a cube
---
Spine chill isnt working on Ghostface? Or is it when he is in Stalking mode?
---
sounds like we missing the most important part of the context
---
It’s sort of fixed but I went against a Freddie with a similar build to before and it still took forever
---
Still Spirit.
---
The only things that could be considered OP on survivor side are perks, and theres not even a need to buy survivors just for perks because of the shrine of secrets. As for killers, they need to be different for the sake of game variety. If all of the killers had the same power and the differences were cosmetic/perk-based only, the game would get very stale very quickly. On top of that, grinding for blood points in this game is hard enough as it is. Making every survivor different for people to switch up playstyles would make an already rough grind an absolute nightmare (no pun intended).
---
Very true. I think new rank reset isn't at all perfect, but it's better than it was
---
I know the add on, but if you are in the vault animation nothing will happen but going down
---
Meg. Just all of it.
---
Just had 3 people dc on me, got morried by the killer in the end.
---
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
---
That's not how this works! It isn't how any of this works! 
---
(The heads of the other members are frowing out of Frank as tumors, but the body itself is still Frank's. I can't comment on any other tumors growing on unseen parts of the body though)
---
His main ability would be the possibility to jump anywhere, able to jump on top of fences (jungle gyms etc) and to be able to balance on them you know just jump on them or jump anywhere. Like he jumps from rooftops to rooftops. A killer that is able to jump around, would be scary to get jumped on as survivor!
---
Points are points
---
The guy next to her just wants to stay as far away as he can lol
---
Hope is a good perk, change my mind.
---
Hahaha no I do know what you mean. I find him a big inconvenience!
---
The thing is, they're releasing too much.
---
What we really need is a good balance update, Bubba rework, Clown buff, Doc rework, buff of useless perks (eg. Deja vu)
---
Just a joke to cheer up, but really this is the best blight legion drawing i've seen so far, most of the other concepts is just Frank leaking orange juice, great work on that one
---
Ummm.... Hope is one of the best survivor perks. B tier at the lowest.
---
Probably somewhere in summer
---
because she is
---
Hag for me
---
Thanks! :) 
---
I felt it needed more than just a drippy Frank
---
Aw, glad I could help in some way.
---
It's very cute art, and you should be proud!
---
Legend says they're still running around sliding on that pallet to this day.
---
you can't make any arguments huh?
---
Charge up the ability to walk through pallets effortlessly without slowing him down would be pretty terrifying.
---
Just an idea.
---
I understand that they want to keep things consistent, the power doesn't proc Sloppy butcher, no STBFL, ect. So why does Micheal get to freaking run around with an Insta-down, Vault Pallets Faster, Proc STBFL, Proc Infectious Fright, Dark Devotion, ect. When T3 is his ability that last for a certain amount of time? Why does Hillbilly and Oni get to see blood/scratch marks when dashing across the fucking map **while also having the ability to insta-down**. What about the extended lunge Spirit gets after coming out of her power, gives her good range and can proc many effects. I don't understand.
---
I feel like they have either make every killer follow the rules that they have layed out or expand the list of exceptions.
---
Much spook
---
Corrupt intervention is an excellent perk in place of ruin. I’ve been using it instead and its pretty good. Pop is good and I use it too but it can also be OP. You hook someone and pop a gen next to them, they get unhooked and tap the gen giving the killer another opportunity to pop it again if he gets another hook. As a swf, you can chose (knowing they’re going to pop it again) to not tap it so they can’t pop it, allowing it to regress anyway, or try and finish before they can pop it most likely getting hooked to finish it. If the killer snowballs you lose an entire gen. It’s especially crippling when you’re down to a gen or two. It needs a 60 second cool down so you can’t just obliterate a gen that was almost done. 
---
Swf does not make pop useless, just because you’re playing with friends does not make you immune to going down.
---
Yes, and killer mains whine about balance landing and it got nerfed, goes both ways. And also, i dont think legion is broken at all, but he feels the most unfun to play against, they need to rework him, not nerf him.
---
If randoms could join that would be the same concept as public games.
---
Well if you want to be philosophical, yeah it's not impossible but it's pretty damn hard to beat. The only exception is if your 3 gen isn't the most optimal close-range 3 gen.
---
My strategy is to completely dead zone 1 gen. I.e you trap the gen, then trap all nearby loops. Then 1 trap at each other gen, and trap the nearby strong loops
---
You then patrol your 2 "soft gens", trying to remove any pallets and injuring survivors until a survivor is stuck in the spiderweb of your "hard gen". 
---
With my above setup, you'll know when someone is at your generator. Dead zoning will prevent the need to chase for very long. PGTW will eliminate the progress they made during this timeframe. 
---
This definitely wouldn't work with any other setup though. They would eventually pop a gen due to attrition. It's also very frustrating if any survivors are running Urban Evasion as they can get out of your web slightly faster without proccing traps.
---
To add to what you said PGTW rewards a killer for playing well. If you get 11 hooks which is difficult you get rewarded with some breathing time. With DS sometimes it rewards a survivor unfairly tunneled and sometimes it allows cocky survivors to open exit gates knowing if you grab then they'll stun you for 6 seconds and run to the gate and there's nothing you can do. There is "some" counterplay to pop obviously being efficient in chases making them last longer so he gets less time to use pop but with DS there currently is none other than slugging and that's not fun for either side
---
Meg, I can see you

2k and it would be "balanced" ;)

It seems like you aren't a very experienced player keep playing a bit and maybe read through some perks and you will have better understanding of the balancing in this game

Spare thy Dwight and smite thy Nea

I’ve yet to be in a strong Oni game. Just stupid solo survivor groups. -.-

Yeah, swamp gang rise up

the only thing "balanced" here are the scores around 20k...

Just camp it and 3 gens near it, Survivors are morons and will constantly try to get it. Then when you hook them they will all try for the unhook,unless you get a sweaty SWF group then you will only get 2 maybe 3 of them
---
Sorry we only have medium

Hag and Spirit

Adorable stabby, would love to see a variation for each legion member! Then could have the whole gang chillin about

My friend who refuses to play killer thought the same thing too.

**OH MY GURL WHAT'S UP HAHAHAGH**
---
I dislike it for the same reason I don't really like Ormond: with a map  so circular with the main building in the middle, it's hard to ever be really 'away' from the Killer.
---
Also it's the most pallet starved map in the game why is there only one on the top of the temple
---
I life for a life, perfectly balanced
---
Corrupt Intervention, Thrilling Tremors, Discordance and I think it's Surveillance (one of the Pig's perks) are all good
---
behind the trees
---
Wouldn't that be fing? Nice drawing
---
I'm not sure about deactivating on another peron being hooked, but yeah, deactivating upon fully healing makes perfect sense. If you had time to fully heal, you weren't tunneled off hook, and now you have another hit anyway.
---
Ant Hill of survivors
---
Dude, that's some Pinwheel from Darksouls shit. I love it!

Man I cant wait to beat pinwheel. He is pretty easy though. I hope I get the mask of the father.

In the novel I don't think the spider was his true form just one of his transformations, if I recall his true form was the deadlights? Like some floating orbs of light

Okay this is epic!!!
---
I've never played Dark Souls, only Bloodborne, but I see a slight resemblance when I google it
---
Nah. The apologies were damage control.
---
Its easy to get to red ranks as Survivor though. You just have to play and you'll get there, since its insanely easy to pip as a Survivor.
---
Ghostface they all seem to be tryhards
---
I would really like to know how they would bring IT to dbd.. It just doesnt fit, Pennywise is more like the entities boss
---
Specially console players.
---
I don’t think the reason people are complaining is just because he became weaker. His power being so strong was supposed to offset the requirements to get it so he wouldn’t just be worse Billy. But now it does not, so it’s become a “why not play Billy instead if all you’re getting is a strafe?”
---
Okay, for starters the nerf to his FF not counting as a basic attack was to remain consistent across the board. No other killer had a secondary attack that gained/lost stacks, why should Legion be any different? Secondly, STBFL on Legion is extremely overrated. The reason you run STBFL is to minimize the distance after you hit a healthy survivor. Against the Legion survivors rarely heal, so having 8 stacks of STBFL is useless when everyone is going down in one hit. The changes to mending while a nerf, arent that bad of a nerf. Survivors still have to mend, if they dont mend all they can do is run around and if they're doing that then they arent doing gens, and if they are then the timer will tick down and they'll have to eventually mend.
---
That’s.... anecdotal and not really even accurate
---
Gotta love that senseless time of the month that force better players against people who actually belong in that rank. Literally meaningless reset without any rewards.
---
Implement rewards based on rank. Or keep rank/MMR a hidden stat and don't reset it.
---
The same thing happened for me except I was searching for a totem to cleanse as Nancy so I could heal in a locker lmao
---
Maybe failing means that you should study harder instead of playing...
---
I fucking love Hope. You can make whatever loop an infinite against 10% killers and pretty safely loop a 15% killer at the end game...
---
Dude, yes! Legion's only strength has been to cheese stupid shit, Frank's Mixtape, Moonwalking, Infinite mend timer, Franklin's demise and STBFL stacks, and on the PTB it was using nemesis on him. Legion was just good for cheesing shit but now with these buffs and maybe some future QOL changes he can actually be a good killer.
---
I once looped a Tier 3 Myers around the 2 stacks of hay bales with a pallet in between for his entire tier 3, start to finish. Against a tall killer, you can see what he’s doing on those but he can’t see you. That was the high moment of my life.

P3 Ash, who is also now wearing his Christmas Sweater. I get Mori'd on sight at least 50% of my games. Last night, streamer spend the first half of the game chasing me down, just to return to unhook and chase me down again for a Mori, just because "Ash needs to shut up in pre-lobby." :(
---
You have a very, very good point.
---
You’re really overestimating the social needs of the people on this sub
---
I wouldn’t be against these changes, but IMO a better change would be to make it deactivate if someone else is hooked. 95% of the time I get hit with DS I hooked somebody else first and the person had like 3 seconds left of their timer.

Ohhh okay

With stealth and oneshot killers beeing most of red ranks atm it just straight up counters them on a 40 sec CD and gives you a lot of freedom to get to your loops, but I guess mister green rank likes to talk badly about yellows :D
---
Play much? My devotion is 5 in dbd... is that enough...

No
---
Monitor and Abuse helps with the first hit to get his engine rolling, and it also combos with Infectious Fright. 
---
You can use Knockout for slugging; Deerstalker isn't necessary but can help in some situations.
---
BBQ, Ruin, and Pop are always a fan favorite.
---
I'm personally thinking about trying Tinkerer and Pop on him for some sneaky Demon Dash downs on a near finished gen, then kicking it back down past the Tinkerer threshold.
---
Fuck,  haddonfield and decisive strike.  Laurie still has plot armor

I guess it makes sense given you being red ranks and her being a high skill cap. I main her, and it does get really rough in red ranks unless you’re a god at aiming
---
I recall some discussion about how not all killers are supposed to be comparatively viable at higher levels or something by the devs. Meanwhile it's somewhat hilarious that two of the top tier killers are base game at this point. You'd think they'd want people to buy DLCs for the killers..but then the killers get nerfed into the ground, only leaving perks.
---
Not that it really affects survivors, of course.
---
Love the design but This might look too similar to another killer. Maybe make it like Frankenstein where the mask is a mix of all the masks of legion, and then mix and match body parts from each of the legion members
---
Hag, spirit, huntress, trapper, clown, Freddy uuuh Nea
---

Yeah, I feel like he mostly does it to make good content. He also comments on how he deserves to be face camped pretty often
---
M &amp; A
---
Ruin
---
Enduring
---
Infectious Fright
---
My experience has been close to the opposite of this. They really like being able to tbag as killer it seems.
---
I had to leave two people behind the other day and I felt so guilty. The killer had two people hooked and one downed as I opened the gate. He was patrolling the two hooks like his life depended on it so I was only able to get the downed person. I still felt so guilty though 😞
---
Which killer should i do next?
---
I would suggest pig
---
Ahhh lol
---
It's been multiple games now.
---
Rip
---
Ok
---
when you're against billy and you get a free win because you can just run to the statues in the middle with 1 extremely strong pallet and one weak pallet
---
imagine if the game records matches info, that would be crazy, eh?

I keep trying to do this but drop the ball after a few games. Props to you for being dedicated.

Most ghostface games I play, they are either a really good sport or are campy as hell. I’ve had one game where he camped every survivor on the hook from behind a wall — whenever someone unhooks he takes the next person instead. A lot of them seem to think that tbagging as ghostface isn’t bad. Someone literally give me the explanation “it’s not toxic when ghostface does it because it’s goofy”.
---
His tracking ability isn’t that great outside of early game due to how much blood ends up scattered across the map imo. 
---
The multiple instant down thing is irrelevant in most situations. The only time that he actually hits more than 1 survivor is during really unsafe unhooks. 
---
His power doesn’t deplete after picking up a survivor BUT, assuming the survivor isn’t out of position (which is power is still fantastic for), he’s still going to have to run around a couple a loops to potentially get the survivor. When he does get the survivor, he loses a chunk (20% ish iirc) of whatever is left of his power. So he will likely have little to no power left after a good chase, returning him to normal m1 killer status. 
---
You can run Oni around most tiles now if ran correctly. Most gens in are near some form of loop too. Now with those gens out in the middle of the corn or super unsafe for another reason (bathroom gen in the game),  Oni is probably going to destroy you.
---
The biggest point: Yes, old Oni could destroy you at most loops and you couldn’t counter him at these loops, but that was a large point of his power. It was to balance out the fact that he gets destroyed when he doesn’t have power and a somewhat competent team could get 2-3 gens done in this time. A killer of extremes where if you don’t take advantage of when he’s extremely weak, you’re going get destroyed when he’s extremely strong. If you have a problem with this, then it’s not really an issue of Oni’s nerfs and his overall strength but an issue of his fundamental design concept.
---
Which is fine, a killer of such extremes and how good he is for the game is definitely debatable lol.
---
im assuming its Ash, he isnt pictured and he smokes cigars. Bill smokes cigs
---
Shhhhh don't give away the legends secrets lol
---
117 moris is the most accurate thing I've seen on this reddit tbh
---
I don't get it
---
I got tenacity and i had all the other perks for the sabo build (unbreakable, boil over and no mither) i didnt use no mither tho, i used self care since i dont like being 1 hit and i escaped a lot with this build (of course i brought a big toolbox)
---
More people played Quentin than Ash...this is a crime against humanity
---
Freddy, by far. I love almost every killer, but Fereddy is too damn' proficient at too many things. It's particularly outrageous he can just chuck down snares without even slowing when actual trap-oriented killers like Trapper &amp; Hag have to actually prep to shut down loops, without any of Freddy's other strengths.
---
I usually have really fun games with him, a lot of people seem to get the try hard toxic ones though unfortunately.
---
"Haha nea scariest killer lmao"
---
Yeah, well, at least you don't have to wait an hour for a match
---
He got them all but me. He should’ve been at least partially satisfied
---
Nah give him a gold plated, diamond encrusted mask. Basically make him drip hard as fuck! Or give him that mask that Xxx wore once, it was this black and white mask.
---
Freddy is my least favourite. The sleep timer is too short and yeah you’re absolutely right with the snares. I haaaaate going against him.
---
😂😭
---
I would deadass shit myself if I see this fucking thing sprint at me.
---
Its sly, basically a skillcheck came in just as i was almost healed, just as the needle reached the zone i finished healing, so it essentially baited me into pressing spacebar, which once i wasnt healing anymore made me throw down the pallet lol, a very safe one too.
---
Nice.
---
A Demogorgon one would be really cool
---
Probably just Frank or Joey and Susie or Julie. 1 male and 1 female. Really doubt they'll do all four.

Scoops ahoy Steve. 
---
Or legion, that’d be cool too
---
The true form was described as an endless hairy creature made of orange light
---
In lower ranking games you can still pip with 2 kills, you musta pissed him off. He might have been trying to de-pip to do challenges easier

...yeah it's a 33% chance lol. One person is on the Gen with Prove thyself, so that leaves 3 other survivors with only one with prove thyself so 1/3, so 33%

* Mend times for Deep Wound reduced: 12 seconds while mending yourself, 8 seconds while being mended by someone else.
---
* Attacking while in Feral Frenzy will no longer be a basic attack. This means that perks that trigger with a basic attack will no longer trigger under this circumstance.
---
* Deep Wound timer will no longer go down when Sprinting or while Mending. Deep Wound is no longer connected with the Killers terror radius.  
---
Yeah they made him move and vault a bit faster but they nerfed him more than they buffed him in the last patch imo.
---
friday the thirteenth is a scary time for baby killers
---
I like the idea of the counter clockwise skill checks, but not the static blast
---
I like how your formatted this, really easy to read not sloppy like a lot of other peoples
---
Might aswell make one for each killer and make an imgur post with everything on it instead of posting every single one one after the other.
---
Devs said something about how it changed, but it definitely listed the 18th on the in-game news menu shortly after the archive patch dropped late October. I only remember because I wrote a note on my phone of the dates for future reference, and remember wondering why they had an extra week between the final two levels.
---
Doctor, not because he's hard to go against, he's just so annoying.
---
Legitimately nobody has complained about nemesis, they’re complaining about nerfs to a D tier killer
---
Mmm I like orange 🍊
---
This is horrifying. I love it!
---
I agree his strengths come in wasting time, but BHVR doesn’t seem to want him to have any stall at all, so the changes would change his strengths to their liking
---
I know they changed it when they made the end game collapse, sadly, i was MIA during it so im not 100% sure on how they changed it.
---
I believe tho, that if the wnd game collapse has started, they can leave. If a door hadnt opened when u put it on, they cant. 
---
Im not 100% sure tho
---
At least it's not a second ormond map, fuck that map
---
Forever.
---
I am physically unable to harm Survivors that ran themselves into Corners or Dead ends. That slow turnaround just makes my heart ache, so i turn myself and grant them another change
---
I believe he prefers the clown because kids like clowns so it’s easier to lure them in. I don’t know for sure but that’s what I’ve heard. (Hoping to get ahold of the book soon)
---
Absolutely based
---
My least favorite is the ormond maps, aura's are pretty much invisible on that map
---
it says nice at the end of trapper 🤣🤣🤣 69% win rate 🤣🤣🤣
---
I mean, OP kept on moving and cancelling the heal so it wasn't really her fault.

Hehe.... ah... no please...
---
Am I old if I got that?
---
The reason I hate ormond is because aura's don't work on that map
---
oof
---
Yeah cause it didn't come out. When people found out you can use nemesis on Legion to bring back the old Legion they were excited cause they completely forgot how cancer old Legion was. I'm sure if the devs allowed you to cheese nemesis on Legion they would've fixed it in the recent hot fix due to people complaining about him, and for good reason. Old Legion was horrible, no need to bring that back. And all people mention are the nerfs like that's all the devs did to him. They made the Legion consistent and actually gave him good add ons.
---
Agitation... Basement joke... nah it checks out
---
I hope they will truly consider adjusting RF yield in the next tome. It does seem low when you sit down and do the math. You should be able to get very close to the end of the rift by completing tome challenges alone (the remaining math more or less getting covered by all the games where you need to play multiple matches for some additive challenges, or for ones that take a few tries).
---
stop canceling the heal jesus
---
And this is why you don't lunge for every attack
---
Hope OP wdym
---
I can never unsee this now.
---
Great concept!
---
that's P2P for u I dont miss this at all
---
ty
---
I heard there’s a guy using shouts in the market better go stop him
---
Not everyone plays everyday otherwise your argument will be true. If a skilled player comes back 2 weeks after reset, he'll just outplay the opposition and make the weaker player feel bullied. It's temporary until he gets back into his own rank - everyone will go back to where they belong in rank eventually. But is this cycle really necessary?
---
Thank you :)
---
P2P?
---
Ive literally stop queuing, went to take a shit and came back to find my character being facecamped by a bubba while people are trying to unhook me
---
Jason doesn’t use bear traps.
---
Yui : You guys got a choice?
---
Nice, thank you so much!
---
I had 2 really early Kills, both survivors farmed each other. So i let the others finish the Gens, hit them both with noed, open one gate on my own and hooked them.
---
At all? 12 seconds is nothing? Inflicting DWs on survivors still buys you time and if it doesn't you'll gain even more time from survivors wasting time healing only to get injured by you again, or they don't heal and you save time from only needing to hit each survivor once. If you desperately need his old mending time to win games then just run his two mend add ons.
---
peer to peer what u console players still have where yall connect to the host aka the killer
---
I feel personally attacked for playing Dwight I just like the way he looks.
---
Ive also forgot to unready when queuing for a killer match &amp; cameback to a results screen, but i changed my name to "Escape if you're gay" so it was i who truly won
---
i haven't seen any pigs and im not dumb enough to try it on myself if there was but they did make it so traps no longer activate at EGC so if you shut the trapdoor and start EGC it doesn't activate the trap.
---
Feng's the hole meal
---
Oh, yep thanks
---
isnt this console? I was told 360ing on console is way stronger bc killers sensitivity isnt enough to keep up with it
---
I get easy 4ks with oni on console. There's lots of builds the other guy who wrote a paragraph covered a lot of it. Also someone said use both sticks when dashing you can move and aim at the same time. Basement builds are decent. Very map dependent (lerys is balls). Don't chase at infinites. Lightly tap the attack while in fury to fly thru pallets. I find the combo of addons where you activate demon dash faster (green) and faster demon dash (purple crutch) is a good combo people get caught off guard with they don't expect you to fly in so quick. I haven't tried this yet but pig perks seem like they'd do good. Hook someone and zip around and regress gens and then you can see where they go back to and discordance to see if people start together which they usually do
---
omg I didn't even notice it was a loop
---
It isnt really a hallucination, thats correct, but when you´re gassed your Vision becomes jittery yellow-green, and noises sounds kind of jittery aswell. 
---
Also on a side note, being hit by Clown whilst gasses is the most glorious sounds. Seriously, his distorted laughter is just godlike
---
Yall got anymore pixels
---
It’s not that I can’t win, it’s that the nerfs were unnecessary. Also, good survivors will still be able to waste a good amount of your time with 1 hit, although most wont.
---
Sounds like Spirit getting her jagged ghost bussy bashed
---
Too easy to counter lel
---
That's exactly how we're supposed to play her. =)
---
Give him a lick
---
2/4 people have the perk. So there’s a 50% chance that the first survivor on the gen has the perk. 
---
There is then 1/3 survivors left with the peeled meaning there’s only 33% of a chance, if you were lucky to have the first person be a survivor with the perk. 
---
So the answer is 50% x 33% = 16.65% chance.
---
Everybody else’s math is wrong sadly.
---
Ahhhhhh I see
---
She is pretty strong, out of all of these I specially remember one hag game where we got destroyed, it’s a shame so many people play the top few and the rest are pretty much untouched
---
why do people keep trying to crawl when others are trying to pick them up?
---
Survivor: *doing generator*
---
Ghostface: Hey can I interest you in a grab?
---
Mew's Guts is probably my second favorite add-on, but people sleep on the usefulness of Rat Tail too. People breaking your portals? Put them back down nearly instantly. Waste no time prepping and setting. "Slightly increases" is a 50% speed boost.
---
He is! I remember getting at least four of them in a row I was done for the day at that point
---
Dude, did you play back then? It was possible to finish a game in less than a minute with the broken as hell brand new parts, also whats with this narrative? Survivors used to be basically impossible to kill and the game suffered for it. When bhvr released kill rates at the end of 2016 the average was around 55%, the recent kill rate stats are around 60-70%. I'm all for buffing weak killers, but can we not lie about how the game used to be just to fit our point?
---
Nearly everything about nemesis I saw was complaints, which was fair. Good addons is arguable, legion pin is nice, mangled one is ok, blindness is bad. They also nerfed his blade addons
---
It's too hard to rank up as killer compared to survivor imo
---
I’ve play against him like 20 times and only two times I had fun most of the time it’s Ruin,Barbeque,I’m all ears and bitter murmurs so like he always knows where you are but you never know where he is lol
---
bad hits are common but that doesn’t make them any less stupid.
---
No, they can't nerf him! If they do, then there is less reason to stop No Mither from dropping blood orbs.
---
I'm sick of teammates getting angry in oni matches for picking my favorite perk. Then when I propose to take the blood orb dropping away, people start saying it'd be unfair (which I don't get since you still get blood orbs from hitting people)
---
So basically Nurse with extra steps.
---
Unnecessary? The change to his FF hits were to remain consistent with other killers. Demo and Pig's secondary attacks didn't gain or lose stacks so why should Legion? It was inconsistent, so they changed it. And the mending changes were made so that you couldn't cheese nemesis. Yeah the reduced mending time buys you less time but it still stalls the game a bit.
---
Who is that girl? Never heard of her tbh
---
Of course there is, some on-hit perks can make broken builds if they worked with powers. And I understand the need for cohesion, either it's every power, or none.
---
Legion is shit tho, I would never disagree with that, but he needs a complete rework at this point, not some half measures, Deep Wounds just doesn't work as a core gameplay mechanic. On the other hand, being able to cheese through STBFL stacks is not a good thing either. And I say that as someone who enjoyed very much doing my Legion dailies with the STBFL build.
---
1) you have to be injured in advance
---
2) doesn’t work against good trap placement.
---
do freddy, that would be dope
---
Yeah most people here downvote instantly and don\`t even know what a flair is.
---
Yeah the 360s look like they’re from a controller, the killers sens can go pretty high, but when I played on console i 360d a spirit 20 times in a row, just shows how killers on console need uncapped sens
---
Imagine being this much of a dickhead
---
It’s a worse adrenaline that provides a negligible boon that is just as niche as adrenaline, with a worse buff.
---
It’s mid-tier
---
No that's actually it. Killer was a pig, so not even an op killer. No one was fucking up or BMing. Just a normal, good start to a match. Then a dc because they get hit.
---
I mean I've been playing agaisnt purple ranks for the past week or so and I'm only level 11
---
I'm 100% sure, I put it before the last gen popped and it even starting making the fast beeping sound when she was getting near the gate, but it didn't go off
---
Fair enough but people act like Bhvr completely gutted the killer and that all they did was nerf him which isn't true, they made him consistent and also buffed his speed and add ons.
---
And definition of private is?
---
Lol I was the Nancy in that and one of the survs killed themselves on the hook immediately
---
I mean you literally use a perk just for bragging rights lmao
---
And EVIL!
---
There's no point in making them faster in frenzy and vault faster if they still have a 4 second cool down and their power is useless
---
Santa Clown has been in the shop since last year, it's there right now
---
I don’t even know what you’re saying in the first few sentences. If you’re saying that it bugs because you press the (activate dead hard) button twice then I can assure you that that is not the case. 
---
They didn’t code it this way. Since release it has worked like it did until a few months ago. Even if they did change it they would make a statement about it somewhere to let people know that it isn’t a bug, which they haven’t done.
---
I got mori'd ;-;
---
*again bc it is rank reset really soon or already has happened*
---
Frank knitted them
---
This is horrifying.
---
Great job!
---
None of them are good at all, any memes ness is just fun.
---
*MEEP!*
---
The worst survivors are those who instasave and farm you from the hook . The killer gets an other instand hook in 99 from 100 times. gg big brain
---
Can you still play the game?
---
Legit, I thought they reworked an addon lol
---
I posted about getting this too! its way scarier than most horror games have ever been!
---
Not really, I mean, at first, yeah, but I've learned to see the pro's of the perk and have developed a playstyle around it, and since killers rarely run into the perk, they haven't developed a way to play around it.
---
Difference between getting scared and jump scared
---
The legion 2: the Chernobyl boogaloo
---
Try to relog in your steam account and restart your game again. Prob just a connection problem with your profil.
---
Hey guys! I have this idea for an ability where when the killer hooks you, he automatically has every perk in the game activated at once for 10 minutes.
---
u expect too much of survivors as if it is bad enough now people are trying to do their challenges bc \*bt means they dont have to care about ur safety\* FUN
---
Reported.
---
Tombstone and lock of hair are both great
---
yea yea WOOOSHHWOOOSHSBBTSH
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Yes
---
But the killer is camping and decided to tunnel you.
---
lol, if gifs with sound was a thing and I could just uoload it so it keeps looping I'd have done that.
---
You physically can't power the exit gates with Self Cares it requires gens yet if you flip the script you can quite easily still repair gens while injured if need be.  That's the difference.  You know what I'm talking about.  Watching the game burn around you as your useless teamates Self Care into Sloppy Thanatophobia killers.  They give away gimme games with their thoughtless playstyle.
---
VVVVSHSHAWOOOVSHSH
---
I have never heard anyone whine about balanced landing
---
Outplayed obviously
---
Welcome to superior gameplay *but you didn't hear that from me*
---
What are they doing to nerf oni?
---
My first killer I played was nurse and my immediate thought was "yo. This is possible!" Lmfaoo
---
Once i saved someone after the endgame and the killer was like: i'm not going to attack because BT and all these bullshit but i didnt have BT.
---
So in the endgame chat he was like: HOLY SHIT YOU DIDNT HAVE BT WHAT A NICE TEAMMATE and was really fun to see a killer being happy for "losing" the game.
---
Aww *hell* yeah
---
&gt; julie
---
Susie you uneducated swine.
---
It's probably the Frank mask, it looks quite similar here
---
I honestly didnt even see the first Blendette before she was moving
---
There is no playing around, you just hit someone and they're insta down, and you know not to slug them because you can literally see them beeing broken, not leaving blood isn't an issue as well since you almost never track someone via blood and it doesn't even make your character silent while beeing hurt. It has no upside and only downsides since you'll never get slugged using it and if slugging is such an issue for you unbrakable has a second effect next to standing up, recovering faster, which makes it superior in every way
---
Those survivors are just openly assholes. I think most people who try to heal others off the ground just don’t know any better. This means they can be taught the do’s and don’t’s and become better at the game.
---
ikr, i used to run balanced landing instead of dead hard because of this, now they killed balanced landing instead of fixing the maps. jeez
---
You should try Huntress. She's fucking amazing on PC compared to console. A good PC huntress is terrifying
---
Gahhhh smh
---
STBFL, Infectious fright, nurses, I'm all ears. 
---
Preferably dead rabbit and another add on of choice.
---
I drew them very grotesque, but in execution they would retain Frank's posture and length, just with some extra heads here and there. Joey's head might make him slightly taller than standard Frank, but Spirit's length is also dependent on which hair she's using.
---
I like corn maps as survivor 
---
Depending on who im playing as, I like some corn maps as killer. Billy on rotten fields for example.
---
ye it twas meh
---
platform?
---
This is horrifying...but unique!
---
I did, and boi is shit awkward. I'll probably be playing with her a bit more while I dump points into perk unlocks
---
Give me swamp any day over yamaoka
---
Reminds me of Borderlands kinda.
---
Games should never be balanced around the lowest skill level. The instadown hatchets are bad if you miss most of your hatchets, but if you're actually a decent Huntress then there's nothing the survivors can do.
---
People who think games should be balanced around the lowest skill level would say that means they should buff the instadown hatchets, which would mean that the actually good huntresses would be completely uncounterable. That's how you get a poorly balanced game.
---
Borrowed time doesn’t work on downed survivors so what do you mean? I’m not talking about hook saves in this guide either I’m specifically talking about saves on downed survivors.
---
Can you do a Plague one too?
---
Any means necessary
---
It's obvious it's because OP is a console player and Huntress is barely playable, especially red ranks
---
&gt; they never actually intended his frenzy attacks to count as basic attacks
---
Evidently they did, seeing as the attacks were coded as basic attacks all the time up until now.
---
This is why I'm around purple and green. I swear it's not because I'm bad
---
Underrated perk.
---
Thanks :)
---
that would only happen if u get saved lel
---
Is a basically a 3 month period we will be taking to fixing the gaem
---
Take a hit as you're leaving the basement, and there's very few trappers that know to cock the basement pallet
---
ew wraith
---
Indeed brother
---
&gt; broken
---
if he can be countered (he can) he isn't broken
---
I'm mean, seriously. You're complaining that he is able to protect his ability. That's not reasonable
---
You said theres nothing you can do about a DS user on a gate and also said slugging counters DS. these 2 things cant exist together js
---
I save them for special occasions and daily quests
---
Yeah they're much more viable on console.  On top of sensitivity limitations on killers end, survivor 360's are aided by terrible frame drops.  There are times when the frames explode and it's difficult to track where the survivors body is period.
---
Lol that guy lunged every time and never baited. Congrats I guess.
---
Yeah that's what I wanted to know. With Huntress and nurse being so far down.
---
Hey, look everyone! It's pinwheel!
---
So how do you get the DBD cosmetics
---
If they have ttv in their name i’m bringing an ebony mori, ghost face, and NOED. And I may or may not relentlessly tunnel them.
---
Thanks ;)
---
Also a possibility. I just always found it a shame that the concept of the Legion being four different persons was never implemented in the game. I tried to show that a little bit with this design
---
same lol
---
Plague because the only thing that matters is trust in your teammates not to cleanse or hope she doesn’t have an apple
---
Did you switch from Xbox to PC because I want to know if I get DBD from the Microsoft store on my PC if it will save my Xbox data so I don't have to spend more money
---
Sorry, forgot to mention this too, I’m on PS4
---
Oh man I love Frankusliey
---
Nah they are fine. Be more aware, stealth killers arent truly undetectable, they just are harder to see coming that standard non stealth killers. Also run spine chill if they bother you that much. Spine chill literally counters every one of them, including michael now. Poor scratched mirror RIP. btw I am a survivor main saying this
---
Someone on a gate I grab them off and I get DS'd = nothing I can do
---
Of course he can. But he would be massive, have a normal terror radius, and no power. As long as someone knows how to loop, it really doesn't matter if he knows where you are. This is the reason killers like Legion and Bubba, etc. suck so bad. It's not because they can't find people (there are sooo many perks to do that for you), they just have no ability that helps them down survivors or counter loops.
---
On PS4 they've been able to babyrage in a manner that denies every player every last bloodpoint.  And they do it to be pathetic and petty.
---
Am I the only one who feels like he would seem really out of place in dbd lol
---
That's the killer connection.
---
That "build,"
---
Imagine having some of the worst netcode imaginable for a game that is built around dropping pallets and chasing through vaults. Dedicated servers can't fix bad netcode, not that this was on a dedi server.
---
Killers learn survivor perks throughout the match though. Pay more attention
---
Im saying that its like this because it could trigger twice if it wasn't
---
Oh yeah, I definitely like your idea better, I was just adding what I thought BHVR would actually wind up doing.
---
Me and my friend are having the same issue at the moment, we can both find killer lobbies but they remain empty. Not sure what’s happening with it but yeah, might just have to wait it out. When we try survivor it gives us ‘host unreachable’ every time.
---
I'm gonna tell you right now, Huntress on console is excruciating and I only do it despite it being a nightmare because playing most other killers is pretty boring
---
Damn, that actually made me feel bad lol
---
But still a good meme tho hahaha
---
These edits are honestly shit. Why keep doing them
---
that would be nice and it would fix most of these problems, yes. but i think it wouldn't work 100% accurate unless they make dedicated servers work as intended. one time i got hit in mid-animation.. lol
---
I think it's a bug, as it seems very inconsistent.
---
Yeah true. I've seen some amazing concepts for cosmetics floating around. It's a shame BHVR doesn't ever consider them unless it's in a contest
---
Next time just get the clip
---
I absolutely refuse to do that don't worry he got mad last night because our first match we were farmed by claudettes who unhooked us in front of the killer without bt and would refuse to do anything if injured and would just self care super slowly. Also refused to accept faster healing from me
---
&gt;clown is enjoyable
---
Probably because you just swapped. Wait till your ranked up.
---
no he was trying to crawl towards the pallet to put the killer in a position where he'll be uncertain with the pick up but the killer wasn't anywhere near the shack so didn't make any sens
---
The slowdown and vision impairment is awful when they use good add-ons. It's simply unfun
---
Didn't you already post this as "when the drive through window gives you the wrong order, twice"?
---
no swaps transfer, not even steam to Microsoft.
---
You know ive always wanted to try legion, but idk anymore I can just stay on my main and have fun. Or spend my shards on 50/50
---
lmao they nerfed Oni? He's not even that good.
---
Well they obviously know they hit you, but playing as killer once i get stuck in fatigue or wipe blade animation I'm already turning my camera according to the sound of the yell from the hit. Possibly getting 2 or 3 seconds of confusion from no yell could be enough for that survivor to make it to another loop instead of going down.
---
Notice how it took 9 seconds from the time she picked you up to when you died.
---
She simply used Dio Brando's stand, The World. You needed to use Decisive Stroke in the 2 seconds of movement during stopped time allowed by Star Platinum.
---
Better luck next time. Mudamudamudamudamudamudaaaa
---
Evactuation compl...
---
Deep wounds might as well not exist. He's just worse plague.
---
Most Hag players totally suck but it still isn't fun to be somewhere random then all of a sudden you spin around and get hit.
---
Or they'll be Super Bots and put like a trillion traps around Ruin and you'll accidentally run by it, trigger them all and engulf yourself in chaos, then the Hag will just reset all 10 of them and you're like "really? okay"
---
By your logic, this would happen anyway if natural rank decay was a thing. Say someone takes a month off for whatever reason and drops a few ranks, the situation will be more or less the same. 
---
It also gives players a chance to balance back to a rank more appropriate for their skill level in some cases, without having to get their asses kicked multiple matches in a row and depipping naturally from it (because face it, nobody enjoys the demoralizing feeling of going through that.) Rank reflects skill to some extent, but if we are being honest, time played factors in almost just as much. 
---
For example, I have had months where I play much more killer than survivor and end up in red ranks, where I don’t really belong. Then I’m forced to stop playing because I’m grossly out skilled and no longer having fun. Rank reset gives a built in way of finding your skill balance. 
---
People who truly belong in red ranks will rank up quickly enough that they’re out of your hair. But no matter how they systemize it, there will always be higher skilled players ending up in your matches from time to time. It’s just how most multiplayer games shake out, ranked system or not.
---
Damn man, that's a very good job!
---
I would be so happy if the devs made this skin.
---
U could even get some auric cells for the job.
---
I play leatherface a lot and don’t camp or use insidious. Sadly if I don’t do as well I get people yelling and shitting on me cause I’m playing leatherface :(
---
Ok that makes more sense, don’t understand the downvote though...
---
I always play dream pallets because of this. snares feel kind of unfair and dream pallets are just so fun
---
I personally love him fun to play and I hope when he is reworked it doesn’t gut him
---
You can tell when it loops because of the amount of power charge left.
---
&gt; shortdistance chainsaw billys
---
uh what does this mean
---
Then that’s some shitty ass code and it needs to be fixed.
---
Yes yes, spaghetti coding. But the solstice “event”/reskins require much less complicated coding than, say, last year’s Blight Pustula integration or Lunar lamps.
---
Nothing makes Pop useless SWF or not.  That is just a baseless statement that isn't grounded in fact.  Pop is great against any lobby and I've personally been saved with it against swf groups countless times in continuously dragging out those final couple gens.
---
yeah the format was the main point
---
No. Susie deserves skin more than Julie bye Julie
---
Yes but it's also simultaneously zero fun for any killer with a real power to play as well.
---
Imagine a level of Super Mario where you run directly in a straight line to the exit with no actual gameplay. That's Hawkins.
---
Then survivors should be able to switch out a perk in the beginning of the game if they spawn in a match and realize they want a better perk to counter a particular killer 😂
---
Also, don’t rely on Ruin so much. There are other perks that can help slow the game down a bit if ruin is cleansed in the beginning.
---
Huntress
---
Well it does and it still helps stall the game out a bit. It's not as long as before but it still buys you time.
---
What system are you on, I am on Xbox and I haven't had any issues with Dead Hard. If anything it works really well since the killer swings and I hit the DH my game has a slight freeze to interpret the DH and instead of showing the animation it just does it. Sometimes it doesn't freeze but I don't have an issue with it. Other than my own stupidity when I use it right I go right into a wall since I am not looking forward.
---
There's actually some weird bug where you click Ready/Unready, hear the noise, but it actually didn't register.
---
&lt;Also the rules would probably bop the post because of the ability bar resetting even though the loop is perfect.
---
Yeah I’m a bit concerned they’re skipping it. I hope they won’t, because to my understanding, it’s not too difficult to copy/paste the elements of solstice events of the past couple years. But I’m not a programmer, so don’t quote me on that.
---
That sounds like more of a you problem with your tracking than anything else.  Why not just look at them while you're wiping off the blade?
---
It doesn't if you actually plan on drowning anyone. Since the survivor has to be standing still, outside of your terror radius without cleansing for the meter to go down.
---
I've heard a lot of complaints about stagger reduce on certain maps
---
Oh shit, someone contact Bhvr and tell them to sign you! That actually sounds like a dope ass cosmetic.
---
That's the dream, gamers.  That's the dream...
---
Hell yeah #SusieIsBestGirl
---
cries in pig
---
Holy shit. this is actually scary. But we know BHVR... they wouldn't be able to do this since it is too far away from the normal Legion body.
---
nope, dont care about rank at all.  I actually hope they remove it from the game in the future
---
He'll get his power with 2 hits and couple of orbs. Almost nothing changes
---
Exactly this /u/JBSuperTroop
---
It's the way I've played him since PTB and I believe it's the only way to play him (every now and then you can get some stalks off though)
---
&gt; I dont know if that's because they are so good and it makes it more fun at that point or if that's the optimal way to build
---
It's the optimal way to play. You can waste so much time trying to get a stalk off just for them to run away anyways. I can't count the amount of Ghostfaces that I've looped for the entirety of my exposed state.
---
If this is on console, that just auto-aim fucking over the killer - not you being good. I can’t count the amount of times I’ve missed a lunge, especially as Spirit, because the survivors do this shit and I’ve had to resort to getting right up their asses to do short swings that will actually hit them.
---
Aren't they on two different buttons
---
Please do this BHVR.
---
If you think 4 is bad, imagine being rank 1 and being reset to 10
---
The new intro is the scariest thing in the game
---
You know I am reporting ^ for harassing...
---
&gt;  I actually got caught by the killer because I was trying to run through a window. I thought it was a door.
---
I DID THIS EXACT SAME THING
---
When he revs and chases you, then waits till hes right behind you to instadown you with it
---
20
---
Imagine being so salty about the complete non-factor the Spirit rework turned out to be to the point where you take to reddit to create this absurd false equivalency.  
---
Spirits ability to consistently win games wasn't affected at all.  Literally all they did was raise her skillcap slightly so trash tier players couldn't boost rank by playing her anymore.  Judging by your language here ridiculing survivors for thinking she needed a change I'm gonna assume you were one of the people that actually relied on collision to get survivors instead of the two human ears I presume you have.  Which is all I needed to find my survivors mid phase.
---
I accidentally tunneled down this poor rank 18 Claudette in my rank 3 game because another Claudette unhooked her right by me and then disappeared into the void and the unhooked one somehow came out of that same void into my face
---
He hooked you and his connection to a potato
---
Claudette so you can heal yourself as you are likely to have no med kits at first and you will be paired with morons
---
Miss one hatchet as Huntress: guess I'll lose
---
I mean, if it's in a goofy way, sure. It's not like killers have emotes.
---
Nope, not offended the slightest bit. It's just a number on a screen.
---

Pig players are a treasure.
---
As we can see here the mythical creature the Claudette being hunted by one of its natural predators. The Claudette is known for living in bushes but due to a recent drought the bushes have declined exposing the claudette. This ecosystem might cause the claudettes to go extinct if the drought gets any worse.
---
I mean fair points, but when a GF is literally in  the open about to be revealed by me and he just crouches and stops my reveal that is a problem. When I am standing in an exit gate and he is leaning, stalking at me and I am looking him right in the face and it wont reveal, that is a problem. Too me the reveal mechanic doesnt work as it should and maybe they should take him a different route. Idk
---
As survivor I'd recommend using feng min, she may be loud as fuck when injured but all of her perks help you learn as a survivor. Alert: Who and where the killer is when they break pallets or generators. Technician: Lets you learn skillchecks better and easier until you're comfortable with them. Lithe: You can get the fuck out when using any pallet or window which is easy to find usually. I did this before I was comfortable and then I started using dead hard when I got it and it helped me learn looping and chases a lot. Before I had dead hard I pretty much would die as soon as chase started, but then I learned where pallets commenly spawn and I worked on cutting corners very closely so I get the most distance on killers, when it comes to your camera don't always look behind you. Typically it's best to look ahead to know your route and then keep the killer just in your line of sight while running, just looking behind you and not being used to that will make you run into walls.
---
The majority of console players on xbox are SWF stacks.  It's super easy for them to find groups because of the LFG feature on live.
---
It’s not camping it’s showing love while they’re on the hook
---
Dude, Hag more than Huntress? I get a Huntress once every 4-5 games in red ranks.
---
"And then you wake up, sweating, with your dick in your hand..."
---
That is the best way to end a story I've heard in a long time.  I'm gonna find ways to pepper this one in organically to the end of my stories.
---
Ok well in that case if a killer realizes they are being sent to coldwind farm or haddonfield then they should be a able to change to a different killer more suited for the map ;D Honestly I'm not against the idea of survivors having being able to select perks to counter killers except for swf this would be just too strong. 
---
I don't rely on ruin but without it gens get done way too fast. I think ruin should be changed entirely and that without perks gens should take a bit longer. 
---
For example: Make gens take 2 minutes instead of 80 seconds by default and change ruin so that it is similar to thana. For example ruin slows down gen speed by 3% for every person working on a gen. So if 3 are doing gens while 1 is chased then ruin slows down the overall speed for everyone by 9%.
---
1) trying to imply that Ormond is a killer sided map is fucking bonkers
---
2) that design is actually extremely good for survivors because once you get that center gen the rest of them are stupid hard to patrol, and the strength of the central building makes that gen pretty safe, similar to Disturbed Ward
---
It’s not the deadliest map or the safest sooo....
---
various weapons with different active abilities scattered throughout the map. hatchet, harpoon gun, machete, chainsaw. pick em up but they eventually break
---
Yeah I'm red rank and can't seem to drop, I'm not bad though I'm average. But you'd think it would be harder to stay in the highest rank. Like killer is actually hard.
---
This makes Ghosty Ghost happy! Thank you!!!!!!!!
---
You'll be happy to have it when you have to loop a NOED Gamer.
---
i am the type of player that can take out DS and adrenaline, but i never ever take out BT
---
bill mains assemble!
---
Okay, now you're just intentionally misunderstanding what I'm saying.
---
Legion's stab gives one free hit against an uninjured survivor in a chase.
---
He then gets a notification if any other survivors are in his terror radius. Let's say that you stab all 4 and they were all healthy. 
---
The survivors now have to mend before they spend 8 seconds not sprinting, mending or in the killer's terror radius. 
---
Legion is now chasing one injured survivor as a 115 killer with essentially no power. 
---
Since survivors can heal and aren't given sloppy butcher on stab, he will have to do this basically every time he chases. Which wastes more of his time than the survivors'.
---
Plague spits on everyone once and she not only gets the same effect but permanently throughout the match but also gets better tracking against the loud, contagious survivors.
---
yes they do. they fixed the auras
---
scratch marks don't work
---
Not on PS4, which this seems to be.
---
Did she use dead hard?  I know that used to make escaping with an active bear trap possible, IDK if you can still use it like that though.
---
For his map it should be that creepy house he has or maybe like the whole outside of the house and the inside of it and instead of crows it should be red balloons that float around you when your afk and the balloons float up and faintly pop if you run by them or walk by them.
---
Same near like window vaults it's so weird
---
Do you get the broken bone icon? I think that's a perk for killers
---
This thing called exhaustion stasis effect and it exists
---
Nah its some seriously fragile killers that can't accept a gaming trope that's been in games since 2001.
---
If this is happening on console this is happening to me because of my controller
---
I'd love to see a Spirit one\^\^
---
Intentional de pipping for easier games or the angriest of rage quits.
---
No I did not and, like u/RalseiBestBoy mentioned, that's mangled. You're thinking of hindered (the chain with two cuffs) which I also didn't have.  
---
u/TeddyBearKilla69 mentioned it might be an issue with controllers so I'm looking into that as I have to use one right now
---
He can definitely put survivors in his bag.
---
Nah, I had a game where I should not have been playing against any of those people.  It’s an example of how not having stricter rank limits/SWF breaks the already fragile motion of balance in this game and makes it worse.
---
There’s plenty of people at all ranks and SWF does not carry the player base.  The game wouldn’t die if solo queue got to play without premade teams.  That’s a paranoid notion.  I’ve known more people who have stopped playing because games weren’t fun than have stopped because of queue times.
---
When it's happening to me as killer or survivor I can visually see my characters skipping mid animation as if I'm not going full speed and then I just reclick thr button hoping to fix it. As survivor even if I have a sprint burst it just doesn't go full speed sometimes.
---
Unrelated but may I get an elaboration on the perks? Not bashing or anything just curious
---
Sammmeeeeee!
---
I went from 4 to 5 on both killer and survivor
---
i wonder what that would look like from the other claudettes point of view
---
Good advice :-)
---
Just reducing his flicks so he can't do a 180 spin during his charge, as far as i know
---
LOL,  Ace looked like he was having fun at a really disgusting rave...hahahaha
---
About to look into the analog stick (PC, but in a situation where controller is necessary for a bit)  
---
She is really strong but I think many find her playstyle boring.
---
Shoutout to those randoms who saw me looping the Wraith as baby Dweet and flashlight saved/bodyblocked for me so I can make it out of the gate!
---
That’s the plan. I meant they’re harder because there are more survivors than killers and they have more perks, too.
---
I barely have time to click the queue button and I'm already in game. I love it. Rank 1 killer east coast
---
it's apart from all other bugs. plus 3 months of Host Unreachable that now turned into endless loading screen. i waited for 30 minutes(restarting my game 4 times cause of endless loading screen) to get a game to get this fukin bug. i just wanted to fukin play.
---
fuck no I am happy to get out of purple ranks again and back into green now I just wait and let the try-hards get back to purple or red and await to play against only noobs bc that is enjoyable
---
Your sprint button is broken
---
I get a lot, I only played him for a lil then realised I'm trash.
---
pharmacy &gt;&gt;
---
If this ran at me im leaving the game.
---
Console 360s are not skill.
---
I trust BHVR to mess it up
---
Ive been playing BBQ, Nemisis, play with your food and ruin. Then fragrant tuft of hair and judiths journal. Pretty fun.
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
I'm not surprised hearing that from you seeing all the bullshit you say on other posts.
---
Yes it would. If killers could opt out of groups almost no one would get a game ever.
---
&gt; and SWF does not carry the player base.
---
does it *carry* the userbase? No.
---
But it still is extremely popular and odds are that your lobbies have a two person in it
---
if you opt out of groups as killer, that would affect you, groups, and solo players trying to find lobbies
---
&gt;  It’s an example of how not having stricter rank limits/SWF breaks the already fragile motion of balance in this game and makes it worse.
---
sorry but the example you gave is pretty rare. making a drastic change over that is insane
---
Yep it still sure does have bugs.
---
Healing now takes maybe 3-4 seconds with any medkit green or better. Thanatophobia used to be decent on him because of that. And that ideal situation (which almost never actually happens) still only wastes 12 seconds of survivor time. And now, you're just worse plague again. Wt least before you could play around with perks like beast of the hunt and insidious.
---
I gotten about 15 already
---
Predicted what?
---
That's because Trapper used to be able to deny unhooks by trapping directly under them and multi directional unhooks weren't a thing for some time later.
---
are you trying to mess with me? lol
---
I've been running tenacity/unbreakable/MoM/no mither at rank 1 for like 3 days and I'm still rank 1 trying to get MoM to proc with no mither.
---
Its really hard not to rank up unless you actively do nothing all game.
---
Yeah her hit boxes are SO ANNOYING sometimes
---
Man y'all need leave the Sicc-ness alone. Imma jiggle my fat laughing ass around Penn, tossing my roofies at baby jakes, and catching pallets into my chin until the thickness subsides.
---
I mean yes, but I don’t think Susie is in a relationship like frank and Julie is
---
It's what happened to me. lol I thought it was a bug associated with a perk I was running and I submitted a ticket about it before googling like a jackass
---
Exactly. Speaking of which, I'm really glad that they lowered the MoM protection cooldown.
---
To be fair you kept cancelling the heal.
---
Anytime I used to only care about rank grinded out rank 1 now its fun still get down to rank 6-7 but no sweaty red ranks lol
---
Pig mains didn't cry about it for months at a time. It sucks but we got over it. The legion players, that are generally bad at the game anyways, pick legion because, as I said previously, legion has done nothing but cheese game mechanics with exploits. They cry and cry and fucking cry when the devs fix that shit and it's still going. 
---
Do you honestly believe that legion should be able to make each survivor mend for 10 minutes at a time? That's a "nerf" right?
---
You think that's healthy for the game?
---
What about Frank's mixtape then stare at the damn ground, WHILE STILL chasing someone to exploit the mend timer mechanic to get free downs by literally doing nothing.
---
Then y'all want that same type of shit back again with oni's new perk. Are you fucking out of your damn mind?
---
They fixed all these cheesy bullshit exploits and you say it's a nerf. However, when they actually do nerf killers, like my pig. Y'all as a whole community are fucking crickets. Legion is a whole community karma factory and everyone is on the bandwagon. The last time anyone said a damn thing about pig was the introduction of the EGC timer.
---
If you need a killer that relies heavily on cheesy exploits to win a game, kinda like the forever freddy scrubs, then you're not actually good at the game. You're using cheap cheesy exploits for wins which is the same thing as cheating. "ItS nOt ChEaTiNg If ItS iN tHe GaMe. Duuurp."
---
More money
---
It’s a me mario
---
sounds like for some reason you specifically are having a lot lot lot more issues than anyone else
---
no I would give u all of them if I could idrc about iri addons for Oni
---
It’s bullshit man
---
I'm just gonna add that there's A LOT of people who've purchased the game over the years who barely touched it; all of the steam achievements have very low percentages
---
yeah he kinda like the nurse addon when you get a hit with your blink you turn into a m1 killer
---
OH YEA I remember someone saying that
---
Nah, I look forward to rank reset. Gives a small break from the same sweaty killers in red ranks... or at least it used to, before they changed how the reset works. 
---
Now they need to get rid of rank entirely, or add more ranks/pips so that the rank is actually somewhat accurate to your skill/experience level.
---
He's already nerfed. He can no longer hit survivors when they turn a corner, so now instead of being different billy, he's just worse billy that needs to charge his power.
---
It’s those goddamn eyes
---
Yeah, I’ve never had a ‘bad’ one where they camp &amp; tunnel etc but none of them let have let me boop the snoot 😔gotta have consent ☺️
---
well you only need to turn 90 degrees to hit someone with his power you dont need to turn anymore further since that would be pointless
---
What's that?
---
This is a hard one because killers don't get nerfed too often (emphasis from devs has been rebalancing survivor the past year and a half) and when they do it's usually really sensible small stuff like the recent Spirit adjustments but I guess I'd have to say Old Freddy when they nerfed him like a week or two after being released.  I don't even remember all the changes off the top of my head but I remember a big one was he used to be able to slug and you were forced to wake them up before being allowed to heal them which made for some crazy end game slug strength.
---
Hag, Trapper, Spirit, and both chainsaw bois. The Billy and Leatherface are just annoying with the one-shot and extreme movement when I wish they didn't have it. Spirit is still not fun for me, even though she was nerfed she still bothers me. Trapper because cutting loops makes games super short to me. And Hag oh boy hag, what isn't wrong with her. Placing her traps around a hook with a survivor is still camping, when Hag is the killer everyone forgets how to crouch when going for a save and the one who is saved also forgets, and finally she is just not fun to play against since she can just teleport freely when someone activates a trap literally cutting loops
---
When did they fix the aura's? Must have been when Oni came out because they were still invisible last time I played
---
Thanatophobia+discordance+nurse's calling
---
Everyone works alone, spreads out. Gens are harder, so it is slowed down. If they meet up to heal, take 'em out. Keep them isolated and they're easy picks
---
Survivors aren't going to waste their time healing, much less waste a green medkit against the Legion. And guess what? If survivors are healing, run his green pin add on, it gives the survivors the broken status effect for a whole minute. Apparently you're the only Legion who always goes against survivors that are constantly healing, so I think you'd really benefit from using that new add on.
---
runs out of party streamers  
---
*I'm out*
---
Like a hunter from L4D, i would actually shit myself playing against a killer with that power.
---
...quite a long time ago.
---
sounds like an issue on your end
---
the hallowed blight cosmetics (with a few exceptions)
---
Whatever you say, chief.
---
I would say that they buffed the base kit of Legion, and IMO the fun of legion, but hard nerfed the more interesting perks, and made him otherwise worse. Are you saying you'd rather him be a viable killer with interesting perks that synergize with your abilities rather than being fast af? Yeah, me too.
---
They changed it with the last DLC if you’re rank 1-4 you get reset to 5, rank 5-8 you go back to 9, 10-12 (13), and so on. Just resets you back one rank color
---
If they dont heal, you're a worse plague. If they do heal, you're a worse plague.
---
Wut? I was a 4 and I went to 9 on survivor  also someone told there rank didn’t even change lol
---
There is a difference between gradual rank decay over time due to inactivity and forcing everyone (active and inactive) to decay x amount.
---
Forced reset doesn't solve that issue of going back to where you belong to play against your own skill level. This is the flaw if the emblem and pipping design because you shouldn't have been there in the first place if you feel out of place. 
---
As for balance, rank gain and loss is gradual for a reason. The system will try to put you where you belong. And if you are matches up against slightly tougher opponents, then that is your opportunity to improve and have fun at the same time. There will be times where matchmaking fails due to population so you'll have easier opponents and pip to a rank where you don't belong. But those easy wins will come with hard losses if you don't belong there. This should happen naturally instead of waiting for a reset which doesn't solve the problem and only makes things worse. It's like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound.
---
You feel forced out of a certain role because you are too high ranked and have no incentive to keep pushing since you gain nothing out of the frustration of being stomped every game. This is why rewards for rank should be a thing. Give the players something they can work towards and reward then for their hard work, instead of making players manually depip or stop playing until rank resets.
---
What I've found as killer: if I play to make sure other people have a good game, then I have a high blood point game. The things I do to max out my points let other people max out theirs, too.
---
right. so i am not surprised in the slightest you have no substantive reply. that's pretty typical
---
That is such a cool concept, I would LOVE this in the game
---
I just want more Macmillan and autohaven maps. Nice outdoor maps with no bullshit
---
But by late game, oni basically had his power 24/7 with the amount of blood orbs around the map. Not to mention having a few less gens that the killer needs to patrol so survivors would be closer together, theoretically, providing more hits.
---
not just me

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/100362/for-we-are-the-unwanted-children-of-the-entity-fix-host-unreachable-on-pc/p1
---
many people do for same amount of time and bhvr doing jack shit about it not even recognizing the issue publicly. 
---
i managed to reach out to some community manager on twitter, she said she will give this information to dev team two weeks ago. so basically they were either unaware for 3 months (though support every month was saying "we know, hope to fix next patch") or just don't give a shit because it's not majority of people having the issue.
---
Haha it's amazing how much of a difference it makes.
---
Just made the switch from console to PC 3 weeks ago, and already I got my first 4k as the Nurse two nights ago.
---
Yeah what's happening.  All I read was some dipshit point out obvious flaws in many games and then topped it off by being a typical douchebag.  "If your salty..."
---
not possible anymore.
---
What? If they dont heal you're basically the same as the Plague, except you're shorter so you can probably mind game some loops better. And again, if they do heal they're wasting their time and you can just run the new add on that leaves them broken so they can't heal anymore.
---
It's been a long time but according to the first like 8 Saw movies I saw Amanda was and is decidedly *not* cute.
---
should of hit 12 lmao, you knew reset was 13th
---
Looks like you were having too much fun there champ!
---
Was for me last night, had to close and restart a few times then waited 5 minutes it gets stuck loading your store bought stuff
---
it goes to the next color now
---
...You do realize the player base is much much much much much much larger than that right
---
that doesn't change that this is a really specific issue
---
what? when was that
---
I know that, I'm just saying it used to be that bad. The max is 4 ranks now.
---
That thing would definitly make this game horror and not a 4v1 Tbag Bully Simulator !
---
Survivor complaining about teabagging LUL XD
---
I got way too excited seeing this!
---
only a little
---
Only to the youngins.
---
*Beaker noises *
---
It blows my mind that this narrative persists because it's just, like, anti-reality. If anything people are desperate to heal you even if you don't want it because of the points
---
Happy Cake Day ❤🥳
---
Oh god, can we just have ONE killer nerf without this subreddit crying?
---
It doesn't actually suck because the games are easier and generally more fun. I spend most of the game in chase instead of hiding and even at rank 1 i see teammates hiding while im being chased so I'd rather be chased by a worse killer if my teammates are gonna be scared all game
---
You could have whatever head cosmetic you pick be mirrored on all 4 heads and the blight head be a unique mask on all 4
---
Being shorter makes almost 0 difference. The stain is just as visable. Temporary broken using an add on vs permanently broken without one. And plague has better tracking.
---
Clearly
---
I don’t care. Gimmie Jason.
---
Yeah true , I hope they buff him in other ways also instead of just a secondary ability :)
---
Use spine chill and he becomes far less annoying
---
The Killer class really is made up of killers!
---
Respect +10,000,000,000
---
Same here! That Joey sweater is amazing!
---
You’re just so clearly set in your ways there’s no point in wasting more time on you.  You have no true evidence, just an assumption it would be bad.  I can look at the endless complaints about how unfun SWF is on here and every other DbD forum online, all the games I’ve had made a mockery of because of poor matchmaking, and the friends I have that no longer play because they couldn’t play balanced matches.  One is based off of real experience, one is based off of assumptions and paranoia.  You’re lost in your delusions though so there’s no point in continuing to try an convince you.
---
a lot of people in Russia and Mid East have this issue, man. a lot of people in South America too. you do understand what this means, right? that most people can't even voice it in English. i'm sometimes in Russian dbd discord and way too many people have the error(now infinite loading screen) all these months. that's not a tiny little local issue. it's an issue of several regions that don't have English as first or second language.
---
Never said anything against it, just hate it but its gonna happen, there's a reason he get the addons to decrease the cooldown and charge time
---
She's doing what none of the other survivors are willing to do, fight back. Lol She's been here just a couple of weeks and already she's had enough. Haha
---
If they all have DS someone has unbreakable.
---
Letting them all get up is worse, because then they all still have DS to use later.
---
Waiting is also not an option, because then they are crawling all over the place.
---
And BHVR has nerfed your dick.
---
That's what I tried to do.
---
I don't usually play boring.
---
those stats are junk, friendo. sorry about your narrative
---
Why is ONLY your post like this then? 99% of posts link straight in the thumbnail.
---
Damn I didn’t even see the first one!
---
and even IF it's not a huge issue numbers wise, what the actual fuck is your argument? did i not pay for the game or something?? why the fuck can't i play normal for 3 months??
---
Fair enough :)
---
Here’s the question: Pre or Post undead? 
---
Which look is the default?
---
Part 7 or I riot.
---
*Engravings give no tactical advantage whatsoever, Snake.*
---
Past my shitposting, 10/10
---
Dedicated servers fixed the problem btw :^)
---
True but I’m saying if Julie and frank gets new original skins make one for Susie too
---
Dwight, Meg, and Claudette
---
Him being sneaky sneaky and gen pulling when you forget to check around you
---
Well, yeah. 
---
For starters, they didn't use standardized games. Secondly, they didn't control for relevant variables. Lastly, they didn't evaluate the significance of any variables.
---
If you want to make a statement on game balance using statistical analysis those conditions need to be met.
---
I also not that you didn't dispute the inaccuracy of the number you were touting
---
Lol Just accept it he got nerfed more Sure your a bit faster vault faster big whoop by time u get to stabbing the last guy first and second will have already mended and you become a shitty m1 I love legion its sad what they have done with him all we can look forward too is full rework and change power altogether
---
True. I didn't mention it does come with Adam/Spirit and Kate/Clown and I think it has David/Hag and Doctor for free too.
---
Specifically for xbox?  Because I can tell you for a fact the LFG page is always hopping with people 24/7 trying to find others to play with of all ranks.  
---
Part of it is it's a gamepass game so lots of people subscribed to that just started playing within the past 3 months.
---
okay. have you tried asking for a refund?
---
Boring FACE.
---
i dont think you should complain about uniqueness because if you take in consideration that uniqueness is literally combining two things together and besides the last two killers were very viable i think it would be smarter to complain about viability since the nerf to oni's flick was completely unnecessary and stupid.
---
I can't really see anyone on this map, It's so dark, they gotta do something about it.
---
ah okay
---
have you checked out OhTofu's guide on playing Billy? Maybe seeing how to play him well could give you ideas on how to play against him
---
You make good points, so I say double down and use both. That way half your games you only have 2 perks. 😎
---
yes, i did. right after ST chapter. they said they can't do anything. no compensation, no fix.
---
It actually is though, especially since they removed the collision and added a vault animation.
---
Gracias
---
Oh we’re going big brain time with your AP stat background nice nice. Well yes, and no. They didn’t need to run these fucking controls. They released the game stats. They didn’t release conclusions or point fingers. You need controls to do that. They released (allegedly) the results of ALL games played with a filter for red ranks for additional clarity. Not these aren’t some perfect beautiful stats from a controlled environment. But law of large numbers says they’re good enough, and killers quite clearly are more favorable (if you count 50% as fair)
---
[here is my WIP](https://www.reddit.com/user/CaptainRelyk/comments/ea6i6z/prom_night_legion_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
What do you think?
---
just tag them all tbh. It doesn't really matter. Those are just for searches and given all of those things lead back to dbd and will be involved in your video in someway.
---
No, now that you've presented the idea I WANT this hodgepodge abomination of the four. Don't take it from me!
---
ah well, they really should refund the game - but ofc that would also mean you lose your account and would have to get a new one after they find out how to fix it, to be clear
---
*last for 8 seconds*
---
I just found out like a day or two ago the burrito can track the hatch while it's still invisible to the survivors if it's rainbow quality or the green verde burrito with the black silk cord.
---
you son of a bitch, im in
---
no
---
Reported for abusing the report... cause there is no death threats nor a PM -_-
---
Perfect! Not the soundcloud rapper I wanted but I think these are much better!
---
That's just a really meh play against a not very good killer, what's so special here?
---
Leave room for ~~Jesus~~     \- Kate
---
Hag x Freddy makes so much sense, but is still one of the least explored ships in this community.  
---
I will put this in my possible request bag for safe keeping. &lt;3
---
Was really hoping that Yui was gonna use her powerful arms to make it usable again.
---
Mori me daddy
---
Prepare for Blendette trouble and make it double.
---
I do want it to come, I’ve thought about this and one way they can do it is that if ps4 and Xbox queue for a SWF then the other 2 survivors will either be ps4 or xbox, and that the killer will either be ps4 or xbox. But if say ps4 player queues with a pc player then the other 2 survivors could be ps4, xbox, or pc, and the killer could be, ps4, Xbox, or pc.
---
Crossplay wasn't possible earlier, because matches used to be connected via Steam API and friend system on both consoles. Now that we have dedicated servers and in-game friendlists, it's possible (as shown by Steam-Windows Store Crossplay)
---
Cross-play with consoles most likely will come one day, as BHVR said it's something they are interested in.
---
Hag. I can’t recall ever having a fun game against her. Maybe it’s because her ability essentially requires her to camp hooks.
---
I saw this and my immediate reaction was: “EDwArd?”
---
On the other side, I just had a fucking david trying to heal me at the exit gates while the killer was right there when I could’ve gotten out if he just took a hit. Killer picked me up because that jackass wouldn’t let me leave because he needed those sweet sweet blood points
---
try to figure out a way to get it easily such as for homophobia, stay in a closet all match until someone opens an exit gate, then run thru
---
I love the stop at the end. "Xbox record that"
---
oh helll yeah
---
I can share an experience where it was only me and Nea and I opened the gate but she got hooked and was struggling.Everyone else ran out and i was injured.We were up against a trapper but I ran back to get her off the hook with my borrowed time , I had to fake out a body block so he can swing at me and I used dead hard and we both escaped 
---
I just love coming back for the rescue and also heavily appreciate others who do !
---
I wish Susie didnt look pregnant. In the lobby animation she moves from side to side and there's a weird bump . I love the sweater but hate that
---
That is Furtive Chase, not Monstrous Shrine. Combined with PWYF to probably get a better jump on survivors with the lower terror radius.
---
It’s not even that bad though? I don’t know why y’all are complaining. If anything it’s a buff for console players.
---
You're literally saying that you need those conditions to be met to make a statement on balance, admitting that they were not met, and you're still trying to make statements on game balance
---
massive oof
---
&gt; and killers quite clearly are more favorable (if you count 50% as fair)
---
so
---
uh
---
first, way to abandon your 30 percent lmfao
---
secondly, in what world ins 50/50 not fair?
---
fucking lol
---
I think that would work great! I think the killer/other survivors would have to be the "harder" medium. Like if I joined a SWF with a PC survivor, the killer should be PC because going against an Xbox killer would be too easy for them. Plus this would tremendously help queue times, no?
---
I didn't even think about that :') obviously the blindable head would be Frank's
---
Minus the baby bump I love this skin
---
I love it they're like The Thing!
---
This would be SICK AS HELL, love the 4 masks on the head.
---
i obviously don't want refund or lose my account. i've spent over 3k hours in game before the error, i really love it. but if i could turn back time and just not get it before it was too late, i would, i legit regret getting addicted and wasting so much time on this game. and i'm only bitching everywhere because i want to play my favourite game but it keeps cucking me. 
---
like, man, i quit smoking, but can't quit dbd. it's insane.
---
God i get nothing but this as killer.  Only thing is that survivors have enough IQ to tbag closer.  Wish there was a thing that killed survivors for tbagging (or at least a debuff).
---
**Dead By DeviantArt**
---
My name is Steve-O, and welcome to Jackass.
---
This is cool and a much better fitting concept for Legion as a killer. The name for their current iteration makes no sense. 
---
I have Legion but never play as them. Is there at all any difference in the play styles?
---
I could always give her a try, but since she's licensed, it'll probably not happen until actual pigs would actually fly
---
i 100 percent agree
---
Thx, now I’m gona call this thing buritto, and hatch camp even before it spawns
---
Imma go check it out later, thank you for letting me know. Does he do guides for all the killers?
---
I would guess maybe she canceled to repair gen to stop it from leaking 🤔
---
I'm curious as to when. It seems like BHVR is moving pretty quickly in this direction, at least since earlier this year. Thanks for bringing up the in-game friends lists, I had forgotten about that.
---
Don't give up hope! He's basically an original killer with a licensed face, so who knows?
---
me after queuing for 20 minutes: omg i can finally play
---
hidden offering: no
---
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING PLEASE HELP
---
&gt; law of large numbers
---
uh law of large numbers is probability and not applicable at all
---
dude.
---
cute :)
---
well think what e was trying to do was heal you so that the killer couldn't mori or pick you up and probably messed it up, don't immediately assume he was trying to be an asshole
---
I don't think so. billy is just his favorite
---
Choke me Myers
---
what? i asked if you asked for a refund and you said yes
---
that is the proper remedy here
---
&gt; like, man, i quit smoking, but can't quit dbd. it's insane.
---
oh yeah tell me about it
---
This is only true if the survivors don’t heal. Which to be fair, most survivors don’t heal in the current meta lol. Even with less gens he can still end up getting looped due to their placement. Although; it will happen less often due to breaking palettes earlier in the game.
---
As PS4, it sucks when a dying survivor is by a pallet. I always fuck up
---
I kept cancelling it and my man kept going
---
Bringing in cross play would help the community, and bring more ppl into the game.
---
No it went from being able to do a 90 degree turn to about 30 degrees. Sensitivity wasn’t changed, but the window that you can actually do the flick was greatly shortened. You gotta M1 people normally at jungle gyms and structures with tight corners now.
---
At least it won't drop you to rank 15 anymore.
---
 I haven't really drawn her before, but I'm up for the challenge. she is definitely gonna be featured sometime soon, but sadly not the next one. keep your eyes peeled and your apples blessed. ;y
---
I wasn't excited about the nemesis cheese. I don't want old Legion back, he was cancer. I just like STBFL because it was fun on him, and it made him pretty decent. You can punish people for grouping up, and end chases much faster than normally you would be able to. Mainly though, I just liked it because it was fun. I know people are saying that they're just changing him to be normalized, since everyone else's secondary attacks don't trigger status effects, but I don't know why there can't be exceptions to certain rules. There's no reason that every killer has to have normalized powers. That was something that was unique about Legion, and I don't think it was something that needed changing.
---
and like.. i have so many cool new games: Hunt: Showdown, theHunter: Call of the Wild, Disco Elysium, Garfield Kart - Furious Racing but i just can't get into them D:  almost every day i start something and it's just not enjoyable :c maybe i should get a therapist or something uh
---
Lmao cunt
---
Adding the game to your Steam library (that your DBD game also has to be a part of) will automatically make Meg's mask available in her inventory and the Trapper's in his.
---
This would actually make Plague matches fun for a change.
---
As someone who just made it to red ranks, ghost face ghost face ghost face ghost face ghost face ghost face ghost face ghost faceghost faceghost face ghost faceghost faceghost faceghost face 
---
Finally fell back to 5 because was just getting crushed by him
---
so your gonna call me a cunt because you couldn't rank up 8 ranks from new player status over a period of a month lmao.
---
 Might expand on it in the future, but who would be in charge of it? do they take turns or is it the entity perhaps?
---
I understood that (disgusting and delightfully horrifying) reference!
---
I’m saying you’ve got 3 months (iirc) of game data, and its been simply averaged out. That’s a ton of data even with these shitty queue times, and without having the numbers ourselves it’s safe to assume it’s more than enough data that the averages speak volumes
---
That does sound like Yui 'Why don't you guys just pick the pallet back up?' Kimura.
---
Ahh x)
---
his lack of terror radius and speed is kinda ridiculous tbh
---
By the time you see him, it's almost impossible to get away unless you're near a pallet and have a dash
---
yes, i did ask for a refund. but i don't want it D: i was hoping they could give it to me so i'd just fuck off with the game. thought maybe refund will make it easier to quit. it helped not going back to some gmod server when i got a refund for a custom class. like i just fully stopped caring about it.
---
It’s not broken... that’s literally how it’s supposed to be... gens are supposed to make noise? You think just because you run technician the gens will be completely silent? That’s not how it works
---
This is console.
---
What'da mean specifically? It had it across PC, Xbox, and PS4. The vast majority of players that play DBD end up SOLO queuing, straight from BHVR
---
The only thing that really scares me is when I'm the only one alive and powering an exit gate after the hatch was closed. The anxiety of being so close to escaping or getting killed at any second with no escape is incredible.
---
You have been chosen by the council.
---
OMG I can’t with how many posts are like this Bill got sweater for FREE he’s been had it for almost two weeks
---
This isn't even **OUR FINAL FORM!** (this is dope, and I hope they put it in-game!)
---
are we sure it is an issue or not a counterplay like stridor and iron will granted technician is not that amazing of a perk so I doubt it needs counterplay
---
I didn’t say the FF hit change was unnecessary, I meant the deep wound changes. The sprinting thing makes sense for nemesis, but the mend time just feels dumb considering how bad legion was and still is
---
It takes longer to heal in general now, even moreso with self care.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
you literally have no idea what you're talking about
---
like at all
---
and you havent even tried to explain why controlling for variables isn't needed, and instead fell back on a misapplication of an irrelevant concept 
---
and averages do not matter if the games are not standardized
---
Billy: *Hey I got me power back!*
---
This game is shit anyway
---
I'll cleanse haunted grounds, knowing its haunted grounds.
---
Not enough people play as shirtless David!! Not enough!!
---
Good.
---
Likely because so many maps are unfriendly to any but the best huntresses. I’ve been trying to play her recently and holy fuck is it bad. I know I seriously suck with her, but doesn’t help that so many maps have things people can hide to break line of site. It makes it un-fun to even try and play her. Out of every killer she’s probably the hardest to play right now.
---
Did you get hooked, steve?
---
there's probably so many Trappers because of the archive challenges.
---
The fact that you know this. Terrifies me. It was up for a few minutes. And I mean, like 5 Then I pulled it to post it at a better time.
---
Five Night's At Legion's
---
Yea this messed with my stats, same with Claudette in my survivor post
---
did u think u would get a warm welcome? fuck no get in the damn que so we can play the fucking game I am sick of waiting for a baby killer to come along
---
Can't slug if they jump in a locker
---
I knew this was the same person who made the dinosaur ghostface and hag! Awesome work.
---
See, I like you man. You actually present yourself in a respectful and logical manner. Everybody either just downvotes my comment and doesn't say anything or just says I'm bad at the game for having a different opinion lmao. But to answer some of your points, its much easier to change one killer than to change a whole lot of other killers. Also, STBFL did have it's uses but it was mainly in the late game where survivors usually decided to heal now that they can actually spend time healing since the gens were done with. In most cases you'd down someone and the only use was that you save some time with picking them up.
---
r/iamsorrypiggy
---
\&gt; I am sick of waiting
---
I guess with problems like mine, the time will increase with every day
---
If you get D-Striked, you were tunneling... period.
---
That one was just infuriating to get. Took me 2-3 weeks of learning plague
---
Unfortunately humans can like literally anything, you mean to say most don't, but I can assure you. There are some killers that play to camp (and I think that rocks)
---
Yeah!
---
We got this!
---
Where's the other one!?
---
In what sense are you talking about? Shawnee Smith is absolutely gorgeous. She's cutest thing in the whole franchise.
---
You could try doing it the way otz did
---
From a Survivor-perspective, I honestly just hate that he gets to remove his Terror Radius and move at normal speed. Out of all the other “Stealth Killers” his ability to do that is just too much sometimes, to the point where not healing against him constantly puts you at a huge disadvantage.
---
I’m mostly just salty that Wraith/Pig get shorted on the Stealth Mechanic so badly in comparison. Pig moves much slower and you can normally see Wraith coming and react accordingly, but Ghostface can just slink right in and stab you working on a Gen injured in .2 seconds.
---
They should really increase the sound of his coat, but make it non-directional.
---
It is pretty lazy. Especially with things in the store like this https://shop.deadbydaylight.com/collections/hoodies-jackets/products/trapper-vhs-trapper-hoodie?variant=13155970711607
---
Oh sorry, you said nerfs so I thought you meant both of them. But yeah, the mend time nerf was confusing to me but it's not a huge nerf. It's not like everyone was going down to DW.
---
I main Huntress on PS4. It's taken a lot of sweat and tears (about 900+ hours) or so to play her well. And even then there are times where the game decides to skip frames and hatchets go right through survivors. It's stuff that I've gotten used to, but it's still annoying. Poor optimization on consoles doesn't allow Huntress to flourish like she's supposed to. But if you put in the time (maybe too much like me) you can still be successful with her. And she's a lot of fun to play with.
---
I guess worst spend 10 bucks for game..
---
People are going to  10,000,000,000% love the second map!
---
I'll cleanse haunted grounds, knowing it's haunted grounds, and then chase the killer.
---
Good question! I started using it again recently and it is such a useful perk! Downside is that it might make people play super immersed
---
I guess my comment was clear enough? I also main her on PS4 so I know all this
---
Didn't read the title, bud?
---
Ah yes, the new killer.  Legions
---
I don't have to repeat myself do I?
---
I'm telling before the changes it made both of them reduced audio they made for Technician before the change to Surveillance came in. If you haven't experienced old Technician I can't say much to you.
---
i get called a try hard for sneezing during a match
---
Pleeeaaase remove the blood from all of these dude. These would be so cool if you could see the Killers signature map behind them
---
Her racing team.
---
I’ve taken the time to actually run those builds (Ghost face and Wraith) and i came to the same conclusion and agreed with his opinion. All he did was bring it to light and challenged us to use the same build and start a conversation so i guess i’m adding on to that lol. Those builds on both of those killers turn them into top 5 killers with no debate from my experience
---
Blendy outfits for Claudette
---
Stolen meme
---
HOL UP
---
Epic
---
It also doesn't help that the more recent maps are very unfavorable for her. Both Yamaoka maps have a lot of objects and oddly shaped loops. Plus they're big. Hawkins is an utter disaster because when you finally get a hatchet ready, the survivor always finds a corner to turn on. The Temple is not too bad, but sometimes the constant rain drops FPS at least on consoles. She's lowkey been given the shaft recently.
---
That is amazing. It's my new background for my phone. Could you do a legion one????
---
Otzdarva is awesome if you want to learn how to play trapper.  
---
Puppers is one of the best survivor mains I've ever seen and is as chill as it gets.
---
flesh and blood please
---
But Ghost is pretty strong without that build, whereas Wraith kind of isn't. I think that's a relevant point about their strength respective to one another
---
&gt; and challenged us to use the same build
---
ngl I kind of rolled my eyes when I saw his Wraith build because I was already running something similar back when I played Wraith and I was surprised it took someone who's all about optimum builds so long to figure out that it would be good on Wraith
---
I'm uncomfortable.
---
Spark please.
---
Part of his power was his ability to counter loops very effectively. Now it’s shit. 
---
He’s genuinely dropped from high A tier to maybe a C tier, though I haven’t played him on console yet so you could be right about that.
---
&gt; the answer will come once you play 
---
I think I rather waste 10$ on game and not play it than burnout my GPU with 99% usage and 70+ C on 100% Fan curve..
---
Who cares about pips, escaping is the goal
---
Ill take the other 2 if you still got them
---
finally my letters of complaint have paid off
---
It’s ok, you can say bitch on the internet
---
So if you escape and depip did you achieve your goal?
---
Actually you can force them to cleanse if they're broken and have been hooked, From there it's a slippery slope with the plague gaining all of that CP
---
I hate leather face purely because 9/10 they face camp. Yeah I dislike hag for that reason too. I don’t like the hags that place ALL of their traps around a hooked survivor to waste time and basically camp whilst feeling better about camping because they’re ‘placing traps’.
---
mettle of man on ghostface is insane
---
I would go for Mettle of Man myself, since it would negate the fourth DS.
---
100%!
---
May I have Curtain pls
---
Is it free and do we need to download open or play it
---
this is so sad, can we let killers swing at nothing and hit every survivor in the match? oh wait...
---
Yeah every game has bugs
---
Why are killers STILL bitching about DS smdh..its not even that good of a  perk anymore. Also you said that should have been a bad play on the Ash's part except it wasnt because he relied on his perk that he can only use once and it probably was going to wear of in less than 5 seconds. You could have hit him instead of a grab and downed him then chase the teammate. I just can't believe DS has been nerfed into the ground and people are still complaining.
---
This came back in the....september update I believe?
---
Seems maybe its still slipping in. I thought they had fixed it
---
Noticed it but I didn't watch Dr stone. I recognize the main character
---
Okay but it doesn’t reduce gen noise question answer. the fact that you are still using this perk anyway says a lot about how much you know about the game....
---
If you just pressure hooks with hag then you are playing her wrong. Her kit is designed to put pressure on the entire map and she can do that very well.
---
Her traps can also cancel out some loops.
---
A good hag has huge map pressure with her trap placements
---
Here's a little gift for you ace!He's all yours
---
Nobody ever explicitly said DS is only an anti-tunneling perk. If you cant wait 60 seconds to put someone back on the hook idk what to tell you
---
True but kinda morbid since I think the alchemist is a cool dude but this would mean he's kidnapping and experimenting on HS kids bro
---
Psychopath HS murderers but still...
---
Also very true
---
I don't dislike either
---
BHVR: say no more fam
---
Nope goodbye
---
I've never liked self care personally. I tried it, but I found that I was wasting so much time that could be used to complete gens, and since effective time management is a huge aspect in this game, it was easy to let it go. Instead I just learned to run more effective loops so I can spend time working on gens (I'll use Sprint Burst so I can stay on a gen even a second longer and get a head start), even if i'm injured. If i really want to heal myself, i'll just bring a med kit and still be able to make use of a perk slot, or a team mate usually finds me on a gen and prompts me to take their healing.
---
I didn't expect so much ghostface
---
He’s obviously high tier thats why so many people use him. The best stealth since he has zero terror radius and can hit immediately, and also a very hard to counter exposed effect.
---
As survivor I fucking hate him. I know many people feel the same. The reveal is completey busted. You have to work so hard to get it to proc that he’ll end up getting a free hit anyway. On top of that most GF players use his stealth to camp the hook. Fun killer. The most fun of all.
---
I’ve only gotten merciless on plague once and I’m a plague main lmao. Wasn’t even doing adept so I didn’t get the achievement
---
Thanks, you just made my day
---
My name jeff
---
I never cared about Dead Hard until I started playing Huntress. It's so annoying lol
---
I pretty much used perks once in my lifetime. All I'm questioning why they haven't checked this issue yet but my theory might as well be true how both of these perks might have affected audio issues together. Surveillance change definitely still works well but Technician might have gone kaput on how Surveillance does a trick. Otherwise I'm aware that if both sides use these then it should behave as a normal gen sound. If one side doesn't have the perk then it benefits obviously to one side.
---
And besides, Stake out and Technician work well as a combo.
---
This, ladies and gentleman, is the average self-carers mentality.
---
I mean... if you use a mori you don't suck, but if you rely on mori's you really suck, especially if you aint 3-4k'ing every round.
---
Mainly haddonfield, that’s what I was saying
---
Why the teabag though?
---
[deleted]
---
Many players don’t cleanse at all regardless of whether they’ve been hooked or not.
---
Are you sure this is your opinion...?
---
Because it is literally a copy and paste of tru3’s views.
---
The majority cleanse post first hook when broken by my experience
---
yea but like now, I played this season till i hit four on killer and surv, and it reset me to 7 on both
---
LOL
---
it is free and you don't have to download it just add it to your steam library
---
I sent them screenshots, leave me alone
---
Survivors with meta perks + purple flashlights + toolboxes + keys: "Are you really in charge here?"
---
Can we just talk about how the last 3 killers have had the most boring add-ons imaginable
---
what did I just watch
---
You say that like its a bad thing. whats wrong with it?
---
I would encourage you to play as Ghost, because his reveal issues are not one sided at all. The aspect that indicates where the reveal is coming from frequently doesn't work, he can be revealed from behind solid barriers, and he can be revealed from clear across the map
---
Why is your first post here complaining? We have enough of that already. 
---
Ask a question. Or use google. Much like the rest of us, we’ve gotten used to things and it doesn’t matter to us. 
---
Go back to fortnite if you think this game was a waste of money lmaoooo.
---
Funniest part is if I remember rightly she did do this after
---
Oni please
---
Nobody in this game relies on anything. It's just something people say to make themselves feel better about losing.
---
Incoming downvotes but its true.
---
Also to save some of ya'll some time, im sure you know someone that relies on noed or moris blah blah blah, bitch no you don't.
---
Yo come on man I’m still recovering from that.
---
Pennywise's mori should have the survivors remain floating on the spot afterwards.
---
"We'll be right back"
---
Phew, thank god the devs did that change. That would've been so aids to go against.
---
Nea: Not me!
---
If his goal is escaping 
---
and he escapes
---
he has thus reached his goal. 
---
I thought that was a pretty simple concept.
---
In all honesty I barely even pay attention to my rank so yes
---
Wait, Nurse has a blight skin? I kept looking for one but couldn't find it for some reason.
---
I'd instantly buy one.
---
Oni has a higher ability uptime than Myers, doesn't need LOS to charge it, and has infinite chances to use it.  Oni is a better tier-3 Myers than Myers is.
---
My favorite perk combo to run in solo queues is Better together and Prove thyself also second wind and we’ll make it/empathy/botany
---
"Claudette wasting shack pallet." more like "OP refusing to be healed  by teammate."
---
I think you are confused because it says the distance in which killers can hear on the description that is referring however to the distance that the killer can hear your repairs
---
That sounds so damn good
---
Spine Chill is great! Especially against stealth killers.
---
I heard that one from my friends hahahaha
---
True enough, I don't remember how to view every single percentage on Steam (it's only showing me percentages for my last 5 or so per game).
---
Though even with Steam's percentages not fully reflecting the player base, rank 8 or 9 is still probably pretty good for fast games, since matchmaking will search up to rank 14 or 15 (within 6), rank 16 to 20 (new players to get them into fast games) and down to 2 or 3 (within 6 again) before ever having to 'expand' its searching.
---
Also you'll be the first stop for anyone who managed to hit rank 1 between resets once their own matchmaking expands to search past rank 7.
---
Post undead, part 7
---
.
---
You damn right
---
and i took upon his views to try it myself and agreed with his opinions
---
you didn’t think i would use the build myself? that’s not a blasphemous assumption to come up with lol
---
I expected that.
---
The actual way to beat oni is to only work on gens near strong positions such as killer shack or near a jungle gym. Or near one where you can easily make it to a strong position during the 4 sec start up animation of his demon mode. Its to be expected that survivors will not do well against a killer on ptb as they have been exposed to it for literally hours or a few days. We ve seen this with literally every killer that hit otb such as old freddy and demogorgon. Also personal experience is a pretty weak metric of how strong something is. If you are a rank 15 killer against presumably rank 15 survivors you wouldnt break a sweat consistently 4king with clown.
---
“Why play the game to ensure 4 survivors escape when I can be unproductive and take a chance on being able to solo hatch escape?” 
---
You see nothing wrong with this mentality?
---
I’ve had this game for a couple of months now. I still haven’t encountered a clown.
---
There’s a second one?
---
Sigh. Yeah I'm just, gonna stop even bothering repeating myself.
---
😬😬
---
To be honest I’m at red ranks and I NEVER see any piggy’s. With the reset today I promise to boop any snoots I see on my way back up
---
It’s not supposed to reduce actual gen sounds OMG like I can’t with you
---
If you escape and de pip you did basically nothing for the entire game.
---
well, thank you for the respect, I always try to be as respectful and pro-discussion as I can be. And yeah, there's a lot of cancer in this particular comment section, it's pretty bad.
---
And to continue against your argument, I absolutely understand what you're saying. My personal reasoning is coming from my experience as a Legion player, and STBFL has been an invaluable tool that's saved me many times throughout many many games. It's not super amazing, but it was fun as hell, and I'm quite sad that they got rid of this unique advantage Legion had.
---
It was a half arsed change
---
“Men only want one thing and its fucking disgusting”
---
That's like losing a game of overwatch but who cares because you have gold eliminations and gold damage.
---
lmao i love these ironic posts
---
So if you tried it, can I see your data? Do you have any? How did you come to this conclusion? 
---
Tru3 can have his opinions based of his own results but nobody has the exact same opinion. You literally said “wraith is 3b GF is 3a” which is an EXACT copy of tru3’s words.
---
If you’re going to express a view, you should make it your own.
---
I don’t know why you’re telling that to me. I told his goal, and I told you if he escaped then he achieves his goal.
---
this didnt age well lol
---
But a necessary one. I'd rather they half ass an attempt to make sure old Legion doesn't come back than no attempt and survivors have to deal with absolutely no counter play against Legion.
---
I didn’t know how bad I could want this. Very cool.
---
Because a strafe is better than nothing.  And it has the potential to multi-down.  He's not worse than billy, just a slightly different playstyle.
---
&gt;offset the requirements to get it
---
Which are pitiful, to be honest. 2 or 3 hits and he's got it already, before the first gen evens pops normally.
---
Oni is a combo of the best traits from Myers, Leatherface, and Hillbilly.  He's still pretty damn strong.
---
Then don't. No one is forcing you to keep up if you don't get the clue what I'm even saying.
---
If you keep on going with your point and used a perk once or how it is now and ignoring me mentioning old version of a perk. Then I have no clue what you're going with this ongoing drag.
---
i did.... i literally played with it for the entire week i’ve been playing the game lol you need statistical data for my *opinion* to be valid? it’s immediately disregarded because i don’t have stats or data? all i asked was what was people’s opinions on ghost face lol that’s the purpose of this post.
---
I mean if you are actually a good survivor with teammates you dont need ds, ifnyou play solo then probably. I despise people that play in self that run ds, adrenaline, (any exhaustion) and either BT or IW
---
I use head on for clutch moments and as my main exhaustion perk. I use deliverance and DS for a second chance off of hook which has actually gotten me escapes if I’m caught when doors are open. And I usually mix it up for the last one which can be unbreakable for killers slugging my DS, Pharmacy for a quick self heal, or stake out for fun
---
Mine too
---
*dedicated servers
---
Perfect
---
I did. 
---
Just asking you to see if you’d give a real answer. So your goal is to do everything. 
---
Got it.
---
Yeah Borrowed Time would have been great, I was just mopping up some last trials stuff with Claudette, we had to leave those getting banged and just bang gens, sad way to play, I just don't get it
---
I don't think Wraith is as good as people make him out to be. Mostly because he is almost entirely dependant on add-ons to hold up a decent team. Run a no add-on Wraith against some competent red ranks and your ass cheeks are gonna get clapped. However, run a cox-combed clapper and a purple windstorm and then all of the sudden you're the one doing the clapping. 
---
Ghostface is pretty good. It's really weird how his best style of playing him is opposite of how the devs wanted him to be played. If you try to play him as a super stealthy killer 9/10 the killer will see you behind whatever wall you're hiding behind and sprint burst away. Play him as an uber aggressive killer who can eliminate his red stain and terror radius at will and then all of a sudden you're going against and unstoppable, unmindgameable killer.
---
Creepy
---
They should’ve just gotten rid of the oblivious part of Nemesis instead of hurting Legion again
---
gold
---
No, I don't think it's in the rift, it was just given out for free.
---
He means feng, but no, it‘s definitely nea xD
---
sadly
---
Ooooh okay, yeah it sucks getting face camped but whenever I do get face camped I just hope my teammates do gens. In two minutes 3 gens can be done and maybe another one if two people hop on one.
---
I see you haven’t met leatherface yet
---
Which is why I maintain that Iridescent Head is not actually OP or bad against to play against, a good Billy is going to sprint across the map (if they know where you are, BBQ&amp;C proc, seeing you running, etc) and get a chainsaw down on you more times out of 100 than Huntress tossing one-shot hatchets in your general direction.
---
Counting the first 3 attempts at Billy chainsawing/Huntress throwing per each of the 100 times, before the latter has to reload if running a belt as well.
---
I always get the newest teachables on my bloodweb first as I main Jake and I have every current perk tier 3 on Jake. I’m guaranteed to get any new teachables on next bloodweb
---
and Iron Will is meant to be stealthy even while injured but stridor counters it
---
Your argument is ridiculous. It isn't possible to prove a person's influence on an opinion completely because of the subconscious mind. You are basically saying that because he has heard someone MENTION their dislike of ghostface, his opinion is invalid. 
---
Stop arguing for argument sale and just give your opinion.
---
This is clearly a bug dude. He wasn’t even exposed,
---
Looks amazing!
---
How is that a downside? tbh stealth should be how the survivors play seeing how many perks are for it
---
I've been on both sides of this. They're both equally annoying😂
---
So here's the thing. We'll make it together is a far better heal. I only solo queue and ensuring that the survivors hooked return to full HP fast generally increases my survival. Those survivors will now return to gens/chases/carelessness. Also players will likely return the favour. Nurses calling is very popular and against oni selfcare  feeds him more blood. Self care plays more into wasting survivor time and time is the most important asset in DBD. If I want a heal I'll run a med pack.
---
I’ve gotten so close so many times, I end up getting hooked near the final gen. So satisfying to have finished it!
---
I was about to comment that!
---
Just Yui casually lifting it up after that.
---
dwight body pillow &gt; david body pillow
---
Saddest part: you would have gotten it if you were in a lower rank
---
You can still 99 without popping? What's your secret?
---
How was that not a real answer?   
---
I do the generators ruin or not until the killer finds me or someone else.    
---
If I get chased I waste as much of his time as possible.    
---
If someone else gets downed and I'm closeish to the hook, I'll wait until it's safe and rescue them.    
---
If no one has saved the person and they're getting close to struggle I'll rush the hook to farm them with borrowed (if camping is the reason they aren't being saved) before they hit struggle.  
---
IDK what kind of answer you want, it's a multiplayer game and every killer and player is different so you need to be flexible with your strategy.  My personal goal is to maximize as many point categories as possible and earn my pip.  I have the most fun when I'm getting chased and I make my down worth 2-3 generators.
---
If your a good survivor DS is useless. I lol'd bc I think its garbage bc I can never use it when I put it on bc it always wears off before I am down. Making it less than 60 seconds might as well just remove it from the game unless babies only use it
---
I'll upvote that too
---
Yeah, I brought a key, just in case.
---
I didn’t even need to hide a lot to not get hooked, I didn’t even get downed as a matter of fact, simply because the killer always gave up on chasing me. God bless rank reset!
---
Is it fine if I use this to make a wallpaper in wallpaper engine and upload it? Would credit reddit /u/ or any other perfered way.
---
What rank are you? That may have a lot to do with the experiences you're receiving. I have noticed particularly the purple rank range is particularly sweaty and annoying as hell. I'm in red rank and that's where most of my experience comes from. If I ever teabag as a survivor it's the super rapid fire teabag while I'm staring at the sky spinning in a circle for the memes xD
---
&gt; Oh I see. You have no reading comprehension.
---
No need for childish insults. The reality is you have no *writing* comprehension.
---
&gt; If everything has gone FUBAR in a bad game, like what was stated in the OP, it probably means the other survivors suck and I will do better to play for the hatch rather than expose myself.
---
One way a game could go FUBAR is to self heal through sloppy/thanat as you obviously have no problem with. Also personally my games as solo queue wind up ending with positive outcomes. This is usually what happens at red rank survivors and having red rank teammates who understand how important teamwork mentality is to be successful in this game. Unfortunately, it takes one self-care mentality player to potentially bring down the other three. As they say, one bad apple...
---
&gt; Plus, I don't really care if 4 people escape. That isn't my goal.
---
I understand. That is why you have the self-carer’s mentality. It’s like being a hermit.
---
If person b forms an opinion off what person A says, they would in fact, be copying person A’s opinion. 
---
I asked if he had any data to back up his own opinion. Didn’t say it was invalid. Just said it I believe it wasn’t his own. Since I can’t ask tru3 directly, I wanted to know the viewpoint and mindset of somebody who shares this exact same view. I’m not doing anything wrong. 
---
I’m not “basically saying” anything. You can literally read what I said. And who mentioned disliking ghostface? Did you read anything?
---
YES this is so annoying when I’m running dead hard 😭
---
At least in my case. Even if I do get downed while I still have time, I get slugged just long enough for it to wear off. I genuinely think the perk is bad, but I dont think it needs any improvements. I think it should be left as is personally
---
Yeah I tried Dead Hard a while ago and it’s such dog shit. It made me lag so much, and got me killed more than it saved me. Thanks for the advice. I think I’ll try using it just a little more and if it still sucks ass I’ll get rid of it.
---
Yeah, but they really could’ve done it better. Why not make it so that the oblivious status effect does not count for mending? Really easy change to implement
---
Thats mostly true
---
so just kill off the survivors?
---
I feel like if it's not against the rules, then you can do it. People can have their opinions about whether or not they should, but I'm not gonna cave with how the community clearly tries to discourage different play (that they don't like) with what seems to be excessive name calling and shaming (they have the right to do so). But I'm glad there's other people that don't cave
---
If you can't make it to the open exit gate in 3 minutes then yes
---
“Strafe is better than nothing” that’s true.
---
The potential to multi down is low due to the time it takes to catch a single survivor who is not out of position. It’s a different story entirely if the survivors are potatoes and not near loops most of the time (especially since most gens are near loops).
---
His requirements are harder to get than any other killer rn imo. Like you said, it takes 2 or 3 hits to get his power. Getting 2-3 hits is going to a hit against competent survivors. “Before the first gen even pops normally”: yea, if you’re going against potatoes. You have 2 choices as Oni after finding a survivor. 1. Chase them, get the hit and continue chasing them while sometimes absorbing blood to get power. 2. After the initial hit, find another survivor and get the initial hit again to get the large amount of blood for hitting a healthy survivor.
---
Influding the time that it takes for you to find a survivor, you aren’t doing either of these in under 2 minutes. If 2 gens don’t get popped by the time that you get that first hit either team is bad or the person running can’t run well lol.
---
Tldr; He was arguably better than Billy before the hotfix but they were relatively close strength wise. What gave him the arguable edge over billy was that he could destroy survivors at loops which let him keep his momentum up during the time limit for his power instead of him being forced to chase individual survivors for a long time and not getting much overall out of his power.
---
He didn’t really change/is still good in situations where the survivors are just out in the open or something. However; these situations aren’t as common at finding them near loops. Unless you’re playing on rotten fields or against potatoes lol.
---
your self control is amazing lol the fact that you didn’t DC from that
---
Shying away from the point again. I’ll help. Escaping is a goal in the game, regardless of how useful/useless you are. Maybe they’re an immersive rank 15. 
---
How can you say that’s not the goal of the game if you don’t know the goal of the game?
---
OP is definitely on console..
---
Wut rings u got, bicth?
---
May I ask what would wiki information do here? If it's more of an in-game issue related.
---
I do, but it never works. Like I understand that there’s a bit of a delay because that’s how I hit ruin skill checks. I hit it just a little before it’s on the white. I do that with DS but the line just keeps going right past the white part. No matter how early I hit it.
---
Ngl this is such a weird thing to do but it looks cool
---
how am i supposed to do that if i’m the last one alive and the killer is patrolling both doors.
---
I've gotten a bunch. It seems RNGesus is not on your side.
---
Oh no, whatever would I do *looks at ebony Mori and lightporn instead of one of perks in the build*
---
alright, the blind i understand, it *somehow* knocks legion out of their power without any stun, the instadown i understand not at all
---
Pretty much, attempting escape was the funniest thing ever.  He grabbed the air
---
Legion just needs a rework. It's as simple as that. The latest nerd was a knee-jerk reaction to the new Nemesis perk.
---
That’s fair. Is it because EGC started and I could get sacrificed? Like if the last two of us were trapped up there and no one could open the door, would they be bannable?
---
There's a version with sound that I tried crossposting but it was removed immediately so I just saved and posted it but now there's no sound for some reason.
---
The thing is that I adjust for the delay, right? I’ll hit the skill check just a little before it gets to the white, but the skill check still just flies right by the white area
---
we’re talking exit gates closed after a shut hatch
---
"The only one without a blight skin" 
---
You sure about that?
---
And you Kobe yourself to the moon.
---
I feel like I almost never see Adam mains or even Adam players
---
i'll cleanse HG knowing it's Devour Hope, in reality it's just Thrill of the hunt.
---
I’ve been enjoying head on, iron will, spine chill, and urban evasion lately. Last couple days I’ve switched out head on with the yui perk that you can reset pallets (can’t think of the name) and I’ve been having a blast. There’s something magical about resetting a pallet lol.
---
If what you thought it does doesn't match the perk description, then you experienced a bug that worked in your favor. 
---
They probably just brought it in line with what it's supposed to do.
---
A good tip is to camp a door and when the killer turns their back 20% the gate. The light won't appear so it looks as if the door hasn't been touched. Then when the killer comes and leaves hope and pray you can finish the door
---
Nah, don't acknowledge people like that. You didn't know and there's nothing wrong with asking. Sometimes people just think being rude is fun and makes them look cool 😂 ignore them and move on mate. There's a lot of nice people here on Reddit and in the community. Don't let the few toxic ones make you lose sight in that 😊
---
Jesus you lived when she was healing you, you idiot! Change it to “I make my teammate dc because I moved while she was healing me”
---
The delay? What are you talking about? 
---
Hit your respective button like a normal skill check. DS is huge. Wait until it touches the white. 
---
If your skill check flies through the area despite you hitting it, that means you didn’t press your button/your button is faulty.
---
The or a rating is completely overpowered and that is the reason people use it.  The bones blood points is the only reason people try to say it's not overpowered because they don't want it nerfed.  If behavior even knew how to properly balance the game which it's clear that they don't either because they listen to the players which is stupid,  They would remove the aura reading at keep the blood point game I guarantee you people wouldn't be using it as much
---
Yes, it would. Trapping a person for endgame collapse is fine, but as long as it isn’t the beginning of the game, it’s completely fair game
---
 Nice! Tbh he’s blind for not seeing you behind that barrel though
---
I was wondering how it kept refilling but I now I realize lol
---
People still say cringe? Man i thought only middle schoolers said that lmao
---
Escaping is not the point of the game at all.  It's 5,000 out of 32,000 possible points in a match.
---
I've had games as an M1 killer with two hexes (Ruin, Devour Hope) both spawning within LOS of a generator and one of them spawning right by the first two survivors as well, causing Ruin to immediately get cleansed because I can't keep both of them off it without just camping on the totem and losing generators anyway.
---
And then I start getting teabagged and looped around every safe pallet and 3 gens pop in the first 60 seconds even after I switch targets to chase them off the generators, and whatever.
---
I don't do it often but sometimes it's just bullshit that if I go to pressure generators, they just rotate who is on them, and 3 gens pop before I even get a down within a minute at most.
---
If you hit any skill check when it’s directly on the white, you’re going to miss it. You have to hit the button a little early to get the skill check. Especially with ruin. And I’m pressing the button and it works perfectly. Lol I’m not a noob, I understand how the game works. That’s why ds is so aggravating. I know I should be hitting the skill check, but it isn’t. Idk maybe it’s just my shitty internet.
---
I dont DC lmao, this game makes me mad but I dont DC
---
Their aren't many examples of holding the game hostage anymore because of the endgame collapse. Only example I can think of is trapping all four survivors in the small generator room in Hawkins lab
---
That guy just gave Myers free stalk for no reason. Now someone is going to die all because of him.
---
I did talk about it and people spammed me with she’ll be broken because of that
---
Can't say for sure what the killer was thinking but i don't see it as a bannable offense. If you were the last one left there's no reason for the killer to go after you in that situation. Because you either jump down and have a slight chance to get away or the collapse gets you. It's a win win for killer.  The killer going up after you would almost guarantee you get away. Just seems like an unlucky situation.
---
^ this
---
Fun fact! A survivor’s hit box when mending/healing is as tall as a survivor standing up, so it’s easy to go for those hiding behind a wall :)  this also applies to those working on generators and totems
---
No mither, resilience, dead hard, and this is not happening. Really terrible build but a lot of fun. You can crank out gens so fast
---
Isn’t the point of the game to have fun? 
---
“Escaping is a goal in the game.” I said this. 
---
I asked for the goal of the game. We are talking about goals. You can’t tell that guy that escaping isn’t a goal of playing survivor.
---
Honorable, considering there were still 4 gens I prolly wouldn’t wanna fuck over my teammates that badly either tbh, but I would’ve considered lol
---
Maybe the lag problem but the amount of times ive been hit through pallets since dedi servers is kinda crazy. It happened before, but now alot of them look twice as ridiculous
---
legion has a glitch that allows him to use exsposed will in his power giving him so decent potential not great but decent 
---
bhvr when they here about this nerf legion
---
Yeah, but you can't know exactly. That's the problem. He can wait til you use a pallet or are out of position, instantly pop it and down you in 2 seconds. Oni can't do that, since his power transition is several times longer, and he literally has a red glowing orb in his hand.
---
He doesn't break pallets instantly. This is false His "enhanced break" is marginally faster than a regular one. You can still drop a pallet and get away during his power. 
---
Citation needed on the larger lunge range, because there's no info about it in the wiki. T3 Myers has the longest range in the game, and the camera doesn't get all fucked up like with Oni's, and Myers has several times more control over where it goes, whereas Oni is relegated to a turn of 40 degrees or less. Oni's lunge is absolutely not better than Myers. It's not all the same , at all. 
---
I agree that Oni has good potential if people don't heal. I'm not arguing he's as bad as Doctor or Clown. But the only major advantage Oni's power has over Myers is mobility. He's loud as fuck and easy to evade, whereas it just isn't an option with Myers sometimes. This is what makes Myers strong - he is unpredictable and can catch you off guard, whereas Oni has a very strong but painfully predictable power. Oni is a killer that will struggle against good survivors, and be absolutely shut down by sweat squads. 
---
This lack of predictability is precisely why killers like Ghostface, Wraith, and Spirit are so effective. You can't accurately predict what they'll do. And especially after the latest nerf to Oni, what with him handling like a fucking 16 person passenger van in his ability - it's just hard for me to consider him any higher than B+ or A-. 
---
I mean, you talk about large blind walls like there aren't dozens of them in the game. We're not talking about an uncommon feature.
---
its what she deserves :,)
---
I think every high level Billy player knows that.
---
Does it really matter how it works? Deepwounds isn't meant to get you downs, it's meant to waste survivor's time. It still does that. If people are genuinely upset that Legion couldn't use Nemesis as a loophole to bring back the old Legion then they must've forgotton how unfun and little counterplay old Legion had. Old Legion was bad for the game and anybody that is upset that the devs changed the way deepwounds works just so that Legion couldn't abuse it is dumb.
---
DS doesn’t just go by if you hit the button. If you hit your button, then you missed or you have a faulty button.
---
Because I totally knew that I was gonna get forced into the corner when I tried to turn. Dunno how I managed to offend you but whatever 😂
---
Which ones your favorite add on?
---
When tunneling I hit the recently unhooked survivor and wait 60 seconds for DS to expire, just standing over them, waiting
---
If this same killer does it to you repeatedly it would fall under griefing. I do not know what the exact threshold is, though. One time? Not bannable
---
And anyone is going to get annoyed when you tell someone the same thing 3 times and they just don’t listen. You do realize that not everybody has the same internet connection, right?
---
Not too sure how people are ready to throw out 'toxic' and 'hostage' so quickly, without even putting two minutes of thought into it.
---
No, it wasn't hostage. Why would it be? It's in the EGC, you died from it.
---
Only if they did it repeatedly and intentionally, but they can't choose their lobbies, and if if you get caught in a situation like the above repeatedly and the killer takes advantage of it, I think that's more on you than them.
---
Cuz it's our second favorite map
---
Thank you for your contribution, sir. Logging on as Legion now, rank 1 here I come
---
I see one comment about DS and dead hard not working. 
---
And then I see another comment from a PS4 player, who is in the sub often, that says his perks work just fine. 
---
Once again, you are asking me to believe that the game magically breaks for YOU only with two perks rather than you’re having an error.
---
I guess I love year 3 because I love Spirit, Legion, Plague and Clown. I'm really hoping for more original characters because Huntress, Nurse and Hag were so well written and unique as characters
---
good that i changed it from Space -&gt; Mouse4
---
&gt; you still have that percentage of how much you got stalked before revealing. Like I can reveal him but I'm at 90% stalk. So that when he activates his stealth mode again, he's going to expose me with ease.
---
If it was otherwise his stalk would be utterly and completely useless. The only reason it's viable in any way is because Ghost has a "stalk economy" he can draw from throughout the match and this is also balanced by him losing all of his stalk progress if he hits you

I dig it. Nice and clean lines, surprisingly stylisht. Also a huge fan of non-humanoid killers. Nice work, keep it up!

what a heavy map

I would guess she is in the top 3 most popular

Sure, feel free to call me a person that has Amnesia or so.
---
More Jeff’s than last month, the Jeff’s saw they weren’t very well represented and showed up to the party lol
---
cuco. yess
---
&gt; but they can't choose their lobbies
---
they still know who's in their lobbies. they can still do it to the same person repeatedly and intentionally fam
---
&gt; and if if you get caught in a situation like the above repeatedly and the killer takes advantage of it, I think that's more on you than them.
---
sure but I don't think that has any bearing on whether it's bannable.
---
A game being hold hostage is basically anything that can last indefinitely without any recourse, so even if the killer traps 3 survivors in the house this way, it's not holding the game hostage because the 4th survivor can repair the generators and trigger the EGC, putting the game on a timer (therefore not lasting indefinitely without recourse).
---
Of course if you and your buddy decide to urban evade around the map forever because the killer can't find you and you're not doing generators, that's holding the game hostage; the killer cannot meaningfully find someone fully immersed away from the generators who avoids the afk crows.
---
Though I think even that has to be excessive, like 30 or 60 minutes of you doing nothing but urbaning around as the killer hunts for you and records it.
---
This isn't an AAA game bud, we have enough desync problems
---
I think you just suck, I’ve found plenty of killers that can be 360d tons of times and some that cannot be 360d for the life of me. now let this guy enjoy his moment ffs
---
First art I’ve ever saved, please make more
---
Want
---
He’s just taking that baby Dwight to the Hatch, no big deal
---
Perhaps
---
I might keep track of mine and graph it next month as well. I would like to cross-reference your experience with my own and see how they match up. Thanks for doing this every month btw :)
---
The key to Ghost Face is making it seem like you are around the corner of EVERY gen when in reality you're constantly moving around and patrolling. If he's able to pop out everytime you get to a gen, it might be a sign you're too predictable with which gen you're pushing and making it easy for him to keep tabs on you.
---
alert on ghostface would be OP... he could see when he breaks pallets or kicks gens!!!1
---
She crawls, like a cat would
---
In other words. Almost every map in-game.
---
Why did you make me notice that
---
Ye. RIP big guy. I don’t think anyone was even complaining about him.
---
Nah they gave him an ugly everything.
---
I found that perk pretty good. 9% boost on anything that the game has is pretty good. I find this perk being underrated most of the time. I know you have to be injured but you can have a medkit and 99 your health and do amazing things with it. I suggest you try it 😉
---
I mean they were speaking circumstantially, in that you can employ the strategy.
---
Think about any other game, you have tons of strategies that you can employ, but not all of them are good for the situation you find yourself in.
---
There are tons of really good strategies in Stellaris, Civ 5, Chess, Overwatch, etc. that become really terrible and awful strategies based on what your opponent is doing.
---
But sometimes those strategies become viable, like if you have two survivors camping the hooked survivor, staying near the hook (commonly called camping) is a strategy.
---
&gt;Yeah he's weak at the start but once you get your power for the first time you can easily keep bopping around the map, downing multiple survivors very quickl
---
Red ranked survivors are catching on to the fact that when you hear his power you should just hide for 30 seconds. It's pretty tough to deal with.
---
We do have a killer who focuses on one thing (Clown) and he’s trash.
---
Ah yes, an Amalgamate
---
Looks at this guy punishing the killer for not destroying pallets 😝
---
Okay fair, it's just observational from my point of view, again, just looking for a more solid understanding of the game.
---
Maybe I mean to say why does it feel like some killers are more effective than others?
---
"Except you Quentin, fuck you."
---
"You too, Laurie."
---
He can't mori you if you jump into a locker
---
Kudos to him for not camping so hard that the rescues couldn't go off.
---
Let go at 95%
---
I literally said that I have an archive for escaping
---
Prototype huntress maybe 😅
---
I have been wanting to try this build so bad but at red ranks you need to have an irl perk called “iron balls” to run No Mither lmao....but definitely wanna use this build for fun! Thanks for sharing
---
But grimsby, eight legs
---
I was wondering if there was an add on that refilled the power if you vaulted a pallet. Didn’t realise it’s a loop
---
For fun I run 
---
-Tenacity
---
-Unbreakable 
---
-Flip Flop
---
-Boil over/ Breakout
---
Never pick me up or leave me down can replace unbreakable for No Mither
---
&gt;This is false His "enhanced break" is marginally faster than a regular one. You can still drop a pallet and get away during his power. 
---
It's much faster.  Same speed as billy's break, if not faster.
---
&gt;Citation needed on the larger lunge range, because there's no info about it in the wiki.
---
It's literally on the wiki:
---
&gt;Special Attack: Demon Strike
---
Press and hold the Attack button while Blood Fury is active, to perform a Demon Strike in the direction you are facing.
---
Demon Strike has an *extended Lunge range* and successful hits immediately put healthy Survivors into the Dying State 
---
&gt;Oni is relegated to a turn of 40 degrees or less. Oni's lunge is absolutely not better than Myers. It's not all the same , at all. 
---
Only if he's coming out of charge is it limited to 40 degrees or less.  If he's just using Demon Strike without Demon Charge, it's got the same control.  
---
&gt; Oni's lunge is absolutely not better than Myers. It's not all the same , at all. 
---
Pretty sure they're equal.  If not, Oni's lunge is just slightly shorted than Myer's.  Again, read the wiki.
---
&gt;Oni is a killer that will struggle against good survivors, and be absolutely shut down by sweat squads. 
---
The same can be said about Myers. Or any other killer, tbh.  If anything, Oni's mobility and gen pressure. makes him stronger than Myers at high ranks.
---
&gt;whereas it just isn't an option with Myers sometimes. This is what makes Myers strong - he is unpredictable and can catch you off guard,
---
No body at high ranks is ever caught off guard by Myers. People may be caught out in the open sometimes (like with any other killer), but he's painfully predictable when he's edging Evil Within.
---
&gt;This lack of predictability is precisely why killers like Ghostface, Wraith, and Spirit are so effective. You can't accurately predict what they'll do.
---
You mean because they're stealthy and rob players of information?  That's what they really have in common.  You can predict what they'll do, but if you lack information (ie terror radius) it's harder to counter them.
---
&gt;And especially after the latest nerf to Oni, what with him handling like a fucking 16 person passenger van in his ability - it's just hard for me to consider him any higher than B+ or A-.
---
He's still a lot more agile than hillbilly, albeit with the power charging drawback.  His agility while in ability is not something to bitch about.
---
He's still solid A tier, higher up than Myers for sure.
---
Damnit pinwheel go away
---
Well drawn but really weird
---
I’m not new, and I know when to leave a gen, ok
---
You should be more afraid of getting spotted with bright pink hair in the middle of a cornfield. I can't tell you how many times I've spotted people just because their character has colorful hair.
---
Information perks are needed on him. I love infectious and monitor for ultimate fuck you.
---
We weren't talking about you, we were talking about creepy clown.  
---
I actually gave you some advice to help you get those escapes.
---
only time i do it is when i see nobody with bbq like yall motherfucker think im dumb or when i see a meg behind a tree but if i see 3 people  with bbq im gonna a be bum rushing to them
---
someone’s in the Laurie faaaanclubb tah omg
---
&gt; why does it feel like some killers are more effective than others?
---
because they are. it's simply hard to create a pool of killers with adequate variety in powers without there being a discrepancy like this, especially since survivor gameplay generally demands that killers have the same basic mechanics so that the survivors can play around them, the powers get more difficult to really implement in a way that creates variety and equatable power
---
BHVR is sort of starting to even the playing field for killers. They buffed Freddy, brought down Nurse, Doctor is next to get a buff/re-work, etc.
---
Doctor mains be like...
---
This looks fun! Thanks for sharing
---
I’m fairly new to the terms of DBD so what’s a safe pallet? Lol to show you what I mean I only recently learned what the god pallet was
---
Does Breakout also work for self wiggle??
---
Same, I'm trying my best to get the skins yet, but I'm really upset with the game.
---
Once I get the skins, I'm out for a while, hopefully for good.
---
I tend to run into a ton of huntress and ghostface on ps4 granted I'm purple rank but rarely see freddy myers and wraith basically all the stealthy killers with a bunch of huntress
---
Love people who do this.
---
As a killer.
---
Yeah, as I approach red ranks, I can already see the way people play and their attitudes change.  Tunnelling, basement camping, slugging, teabagging, flashlight harassment (when playing as killer and surv).  Killer and surv build variety plummets, hex ruin in 90% of games.    When I play as killer and play in a more light-hearted and silly way, people actually start getting annoyed at it post-game and insult me.  DBD is a lot less fun here :(
---
No  it’s just so they won’t touch me or my son again.
---
L O L
---
Not to be rude, but you really don't know the game. That's fine - welcome! - but you're concerned about the balance of something you've not even explored. Where's Pig, for example? She's a stealthy killer who needs a rework.
---
There are problems with balance, but until you reach certain levels of gameplay the far more important variable is player skill. Sure, some killers are more or less responsive to player skill (a bad Michael is closer to a good Michael than a bad Nurse is to a good Nurse), but what you're discussing here isn't really about balance. Rather, you're more discussing which killers are feasible in 20-10.
---
Stranger Things Chapter! The Demogorgon is a genuinely fun killer to play against and it’s so cool to have mainstream characters like Steve and Nancy as a part of this game.

I really love this! Will you colour it in?
---
I didn't list percentage values in Heavy Arsenal because I don't know the percentages :)
---
I learned on Feng Min and still main her. I think her perks are good for beginners. Plus she has pretty cute cosmetics haha.
---
technically even start of the game is fair game too as long as not every survivor is up there. the game state isn't paused since other survivors can still do gens.
---
I'd take a wendigo that could walk out of trees around the map. Teleporting but restricted to wood. "Wendigo, where'dhe-go"
---
HeS mEtA *ignores that you have to use red items in order for him to be viable*
---
I like the original killers more because it feels like they designed the power first and wrote the lore to fit it, whereas the licensed characters have to have their power designed around their lore. More freedom when designing the power=More interesting powers.
---
Yeah I think Swordsgirl needs a complete rework to be honest...
---
Is the red supposed to mean something? I’m not getting it if so
---
#IF IT GLOWS IT GOES.
---
Oh, it's just Jane's thicc ass, my bad
---
Lol yeah
---
That felt like pure chaos 😆
---
Well I've only been arround for like 4-5 patches so I wouldn't know much about that, although form what I gather they fairly if ever reply to anyone about these things.
---
I like strong killers, and the unpredictability from killer players keeps gameplay from going stale but I can see how a particular playstlye will wear out quickly for a lot of players. I really try not to take anything personal in this game but I doubt others take that mindset often.
---
My bad
---
&gt; we’ll make it/empathy/botany
---
but... we'll make it explicitly states it doesn't work with other perks since it doesn't go past 100.
---
I play both sides and consistently reach the collapse as survivor and I don’t see that happen ever. I would say it’s probably less than 5% for most of us.
---
exactly.
---
even with ghostface people were talking about not stalking like right away. for instance, i wasn't using tru3's mindset for Ghost because I was already doing that with wraith, but i was talking about using him as an assassin type killer built around STBFL/I'm All Ears (although since then I've come to appreciate his talk more despite its issues)
---
Isn’t necessarily a bad thing, just means you enjoy using unique characters :)
---
Can I repost this if I don't include any links then? I mainly just want to show what I made :/ Also if I were to give him away for free as fan contribution, is that also allowed?
---
when you think about it, it would seem kinda fucked up if Legion gets one. since these skins imply that the killers were forcibly experimented on with the serum. Outside of Licensed killers, Legion is the most human + youngest killer(s) in the game being young high school students.
---
I'm not against them getting a skin, but it would be that extra bit twisted if they get one...or 4?
---
If you’d allow me to be so rude as to counter your question with a question, do you also enjoy ”destroying liberals with facts and logic”, despite you yourself not listening to facts and logic (Such as major global scientific consensus)?
---
Oh, also, to answer your question, no, not especially. I’m just really surprised to see a ”snowflake”-user in the not-really-flesh-but-still.
---
when someone tries to roleplay in postgame chat
---
For killer or survivor?
---
Now that i have tenacity from the shrine, I'm gonna be running the fuck you killer build.
---
Tenacity/Unbreakable/DS/Deliverance. Argueably you could drop tenacity for borrowed to basically make this a basement endgame dive build as long as you were on first hook.
---
LMAO infinite tombstone is one of the least sweaty builds in the game. 
---
Myers is SLOWED + has to spend ages (he has to suck 3 and a half survivors dry of stalker juice) stalking to hit tier 3, and by that point the games over. Even then you can counter tombstone via lockers.
---
Same, the franchise has been on hold for about 10 years now and they keep saying they're working on it and nothing happens. I actually really enjoyed the game when it came out but the problem became.. not much changed or improved after it came out lol
---
This.
---
This is beautiful.
---
Killer or surv
---
What a terrible idea
---
Weekend at steve's
---
Yes! There were even scratch marks there! I guess that he was so focused in getting the downed Survivor he didn't even noticed them.
---
Gj
---
Better than the status quo.
---
If I could choose anything other than "next to a gen 4Head" and "out in the middle of a fucking field Pepega" I'd be happy.
---
This is Jeff erasure and I won't stand for it
---
He has used them
---
Guy used bond to lead killer to his teammate. Red is the killers stain thing
---
i know lmao i just wanted the achievement ( which i got). plus i think you can just vault a window or pallet and he cant kill you during the animation
---
I’d like to try to do it digitally this weekend
---
Oooh! Thank you.
---
I'll give some general descriptions:
---
Slots are where you place your perks/add-ons
---
Perks are special abilities you can apply to each individual killer/survivor that changes what you can do in the match. Some of them can help make you recover from a swing faster or tell you where survivors are after a generator is completed as a killer, or make you faster while crouching as a survivor. 
---
Add ons are things that affect your Killer's power directly, it could make your ability go further,activate faster, etc. For survivors, they make items last longer, apply faster,etc
---
Bloodpoints are the in game currency you use to level up your characters.
---
Let’s just say we got “LIT”
---
how did you get to the conclusion of
---
DRAGONS.
---
and Dead by Daylight.
---
they can, i've already sold my soul to bhvr
---
Yeah Ohm is the best dbd YouTuber in my opinion. Unlike most of the others he doesn't cut out all his bad plays and doesn't complain about shit being unfair and unbalanced.
---
Cause I like dragons and dead by daylight
---
Ironically the hag is based on the wendigo and also teleports
---
both
---
Where are those lines from?
---
Why’s my boy Adam always number last? Where’s the love?
---
It says suggestion and not shitpost 😕
---
7
---
Deep Wounds is obviously such a problem for them, and I really wish it would be the main focus.
---
They obviously don’t know what the hell to do with it. Sadly, having it pause during a chase was the best option for it, but thanks to how weird chases actually work and the fact that you can exploit it, that probably won’t ever happen again. 
---
I’d love to see a version that just COVERS your screen in blood/darkness if you let the timer tick down to long.
---
yeah I generally do that too. I'm pretty casual it's nice to know others do the same
---
So I'm supposed to magically know she has NOED and cleanse that specific totem I never came across the whole game or waste the game cleansing every totem and ignore gens and people being hooked? Noed should never be near exit gates that are close together that's ridiculous.
---
You didn’t look at him long enough, that’s why he got you. Git gud nerd. /s
---
Dwight. Meg's Sprint Burst is hard for new players to use well, and Adrenaline is worthless if you can't survive until the gates are powered. Claudette's Self-Care is a trap.
---
BVHR: And I'll fucking do it again.
---
Protip: only buy a new killer with shards, and only after about a month. Seems like despite their monetary success, BVHR has the testing abilities of a basement Indie studio.
---
Completely broken and needs a serious work
---
Sounds SWEATY
---
Oni: “You picked the wrong house fool!”
---
Spirit: “Yo Oni it’s me spirit chill chill!”
---
*m’piggy*
---
I'd say year 2
---
I just simply clense every totem I come across...it does not take that much time anyways and it is kinda your fault for ignoring the totems...
---
I’ve been playing Hag a ton lately and I kinda love that few people play her. Majority of survivors don’t use Urban Evasion anymore so they get really reckless and start blowing traps. She’s been great for those basement challenges.
---
Thank god you don’t make any decisions.
---
Where is has his feets gones
---
Power: Harvest Their Fear
---
Whenever you engage a chase with a survivor, you apply a fear token to the survivor every 12/20/26 seconds during the chase. When a survivor has three stacks of fear, activating this ability will consume all tokens and put the survivor into the next health state. Tokens harvested this way grant you a movement speed buff and allows you to see the aura of other survivors with fear tokens for 3 seconds. Fear tokens will remove themselves after 60 seconds of being out of a chase.
---
Mori animation: It picks up the downed survivor and shows them the deadlights
---
Don't know what to do for teachables, but what do y'all think so far?
---
what does desync have anything to do with OP's post?
---
Don't use the perk "Self Care." 🙃
---
Adiris ate one too many ashen apples.
---
Yup. Can't get past rank 15. Can't keep my items, can't get +1 or +2, can't get bloodpoints. Happening in 9 out of 10 matches. Also, when I say 8 months, it's literally 8 months, I was probably one of the first persons to get this bug and in a high intensity.
---
I used to be rank 4 surv.  
---
All of my matches now are at low ranks and are basically me doing 3 gens alone, while 360ing the killer and making him give up on me after a 2-minute chase.  
---
Meanwhile, I watch the other 3 survivors crouching at the corner of the map, not doing gens, cleansing totems with no hex and getting downed after 5 seconds of chase or getting grabbed while slow vaulting a window.  
---
Match Final Score:  
---
Me - 28000 BP (Which I can't retain) - escaped  
---
Noob 1 - 9500 BP - sacrificed  
---
Noob 2 - 8600 BP - sacrificed (forced his death on hook cuz didn't want to wait)  
---
Noob 3 - 7800 BP - disconnected (after getting downed for the first time)  
---
How can I have fun in this place? It's like forcing me to play rugby with 4 year old children
---
im not offended? im just calling your stupid play stupid.
---
The meta has changes and its just not optimal anymore. You have better ways to heal and sometimes you shouldn't heal at all. Especially not when the killer is running anti-healing perks
---
i'm not sure why people around here are against having discussions on a what is essentially a discussion board.
---
You're right on the money. It's impossible to balance for both solo and swf. Since the majority of people play solo, killers have to draw the short straw and recieve nerfs to bring them down to that level. I hate seeing killers get nerfed because it only serves to further the us vs them mentality that some nurture, but at the same time I'm thankful that I'm not being punished by choosing to play alone.
---
Didn't feel like it, so thanks but no thanks
---
So every single game you straight away ignore all the gens and killer and the team being hooked and go around cleansing every single totem? I smell bullshit.
---
Oh, relative to one another? Killer balance is a disaster. Freddy, Billy and Spirit can utterly humiliate the likes of Clown, Leatherface and Wraith (respectively, if you want to be even more clear-cut). Ghostface is just a better Michael.
---
The problem is that Killers are all fundamentally very similar because they're easier to make that way. All that changes is their ability (some Killers get two of those), and in a few cases, their movespeed and terror radius. With so few variables, you're going to see a few "X but better" instances.
---
Clown is getting a boost because of of the Santa outfit
---
That's surprising that you're having such long queue times then.  
---
I had no issues today with my killer games this morning, both lobbies were less than five minute waits.
---
Resist the temptations child!
---
18th
---
Do I look like i know what a jpeg is?
---
Hmm yeah you got a good point there. I would honestly be happy if they just looked at the reveal mechanic and make some tweaks to it. That's really my main gripe.
---
I feel like you should be able to fuck around like this in custom games, it'd be hella fun.
---
See, if they'd just make this a mode, people would stop doing it as a glitch and create impossible games. Though I'm sorry you got a sweatlord.
---
Ad hominem. Nice try though.
---
\&gt; Pls never fix this
---
$5 says we see this in the next patch notes
---
I don't really agree with that. The last few killers have been very lackluster with power design. Honestly the most creative power is probably new!Freddy's and that's only because he's a swiss army knife of killer powers.
---
What Perk is that?
---
Console player?
---
Good luck m8
---
Borrowed Time.

I went down by 2 ranks.. Kinda dissapointed tbh

does the game bar not come up at all, or is it that it won't save the replay?

Likely.
---
Try Hillbilly and one next time and race them, no add-ons, no perks to see who the fastest
---
Plus they mess up swings a lot, making stuff like pretending to go for windows WAY more effective.
---
I just have my phone set a timer with voice command for 60 seconds when I get in a chase. If the survivor is still up I switch to one on a gen.
---
They’re not survivors.
---
Thats actually hella dope
---
i assume you've restarted your machine since this behavior began?
---
I never use Moris but I’ve seen more keys than I can count the past few days. From now on, if someone brings a key, I’m bringing a Mori and tunnel the hell out of them
---
It says it clearly here on the survivor rule book page# 457, thou shall not strike a survivor if he doesn't see you before he vaults through a window.
---
Dead hard, prove thyself, iron will, and borrowed time or were gonna live forever
---
Or just don’t prestige.
---
Hells yeah!?
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass
---
yea could like make it a bit bigger, please.
---
Gives endurance to person your unhooking if killer is in 32 meters of the unhook. when person is hit in the next 10-20 seconds based on rank it gives deep wounds.
---
I think Legion and Ghostface would be the coolest to receive a blighted skin because they're the closest killers we have to regular people. I'd like to see how fucked the blighted theme can actually get when we can somewhat properly relate to the people
---
And the thing is, a legion did this to me yesterday, And they got a 4k
---
WGLF is just for extra BP so I’d use that only when there’s a 2x BP event
---
&gt;Noed should never be near exit gates that are close together that's ridiculous. 
---
For all we/you know that was the only available totem to be hexed, making it have to be near both exit gates. The only real change needs to be the Map Logic putting gates close together.  
---
Problem is that the gates are as far one way as they are close the other so the logic might only see them as being as far as possible because of that.
---
Why is it so hard to comprehend that if you're not swf you can't know if someone has cleansed them or not and if you're wasting your time and no one said gen rush you sound like a killer that relies on fucking noed to get any points at all.
---
This should be the reason we uninstall the game, don't joke about Jason. Either add him or don't mention him jokingly, we've seriously been wanting Jason in this game since launch.

---
HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!
---
Yes it was. The game started with 3 survivors being in the lobby
---
I think they're supposed to be different ages. I think Frank and Julie are meant to be older while Joe and Suzie are younger, and considering Frank and Julie are the default Legion they could easily just use those two who are probably 18-19
---
Is this the “how the get bullied by survivors” build?
---
I ran into a Leatherface yesterday who would down someone and Insidious camp the hook in plain sight. Their name was CampinToRank15.
---
Yeah I can agree. Definitely one of my best experiences in dead by daylight so far
---
There is a challenge to deplete three keys.
---
The Alchemist has lost his sanity, though, as per the Hunger story entries in the Archives. It'd make sense if he continued his experiments after succumbing to his addiction to the serum
---
There is an input delay. You have to press the button a little bit before it's on the white, that's exactly how an input delay works.
---
Just waiting for him to get nerfed, so I can never play killer again.
---
Sadly, it was a public match so probably the only experience I will have with 2 killers in the game
---
Yeah I don’t care. Keys are annoying. To me keys are the equivalent of Ebony Moris, hence why I never use either. But I’m getting REALLY sick of them
---
It's unrealistic to make each single survivor know exactly where and how many have been cleansed and like-wise for all you know there might have been 3 other totems in more reasonable places. Then let me edit to your liking - Totems should spawn right near exit gates.
---
Ugly
---
If one green key/key that doesn’t get used is the equivalent of an ebony Mori then you value things incorrectly. Bringing in an item doesn’t give you an excuse to be an asshole.
---
Just curious, what are your reasons for them being equal to eachother?
---
I mean it is fair though, it was complete chance that he walked in your direction when he spawned and you guys were just in a bad spot.
---
Either they are good, or they suck and that’s allot of them who just Camp in shroud mode and that’s what you mostly see in the Red Ranks for PS4
---
Usually. Unless the last person pissed me off they always get hatch. Carry people to the gate a lot too.
---
We have found that The Pig is actually able to kill survivors. We think of this as overperforming and she will be getting the nerf she deserves
---
1. The reason Micheal gets to benefit from perks like STBFL or Sloppy in T3 is bc T3 attacks are no different than normal attacks where the survivor is exposed lol. Imagine if you couldn’t stack STBFL or apply Sloppy if you got 3 devour hope tokens, that’s what ur arguing right now. Furthermore Micheals power is based on survivor actions and how much stalk they grant him, and T3 is finite in both duration and commodity. You can’t get infinite T3 (unless tuft) or as many bouts of T3 as you want. 
---
2.  Billy and Oni get to see blood and scratch marks while using their power bc their power is less maneuverable and doesn’t place them, the killer themselves. In some kind of altered state of being. Oni also doesn’t get to see blood orbs during demon mode and Billy is slowed while charging his chainsaw, would you like Legion to have to charge up Frenzy before using it and be slowed for that duration?
---
You clearly slow vaulted at the end though?
---
Use custom instead of private, it seems people aren't understanding the post.
---
Oh yeah it is
---
Ghostface is also super good at hit and run which is why you see so many of then at red ranks. 
---
Not to mention trying to reveal him before he gets an instadown on you is about as difficult as feeding a cat a pill and usually ends in a similarly disastrous manner.
---
Long term benefits are better at P3. You'll have more stock on the strongest items
---
credit to RinsHauntedGround from Tumblr.
---
it’s funny how nobody plays nurse anymore even though every single add on but extra blinks was buffed and her power nerf was not that bad
---
Absolutely how I imagined it. Billy's balance for his rapid speed is that he basically has to travel in straight lines, Oni's "problem" is that he can be drifting around, spot a survivor, and intentionally go for them usually without stopping the dash. Don't nerf his mobility, just make it so the dash isn't basically free to use. Now we have three variations of "Charge weapon to make a one shot swing with a short lunge straight in front of you"
---
I think Kazan would be the overprotective father figure Rin needs.
---
&gt; **i didn’t know how people would react. I have started drawing killers as dragons** 
---
Don't sexualize them and we good.
---
What's the point here? You ran straight into him. 
---
*Second hit* Ohhh I see the issue now, good ol' desync
---
Unless they changed the rate in the last year or so, my understanding is that the difference between P0 and P3 is almost negligible.
---
That's cool. I mori'd a streamer and he just plugs his stream to "Show how a real red rank survivor/killer plays". Currently in Rank 1 mainly using Legion without ruin in my build
---
This is really good can you maybe make one that fits an iPhone?
---
To be honest even with the 180 flick it wasn't hard to loop. I enjoy playing him but decent survivors just went to loops that hard countered it or at least allowed for potential outplay. After they increased the recovery after stopping the sprint he was completely counterable.
---
What perks?
---
Trapper mood: Really Not OK.
---
And I'm aware that's often the case. But not doing totems because you're not on a SWF group isn't a reasonable excuse, in my opinion.
---
Same reason I run kindred and don't run we'll make it
---
Yet to be in an oni match where more than one survivor dies. It's usually our mate derik. Bless his heart.
---

I mean that's not an answer to what he asked but ok.
---
I think using Franklins is a bigger kick in the face than a mori. The feeling of my precious key being yeeted out of my hands breaks my heart. Plus, when you realize another survivor stole your yeeted key and the betrayal you feel. Amazing.
---
wait it heal and pallet drop the same button on console?
---
BBQ, Ruin, Nurses Calling, and Thanataphobia
---
yes 
---
mind telling us why you think that?
---
That is definitely an advantage to be able to join voice chat that easily. I have only once or twice ever been offered someone's discord link prematch that wasn't already a friend of mine.
---
This explained it the best. Thanks a lot for the teachable part. How about prestige? I heard about that and I don't get it why people do it
---
Hey man, that's my grandpa's pocket watch!
---
Damn, and I'm just about done collecting pretty much the same data :P
---
Hope mods don't mind me also posting some graphs
---
Seriously. Someone's just being a lame-ass negative nancy
---
I’m getting better. Decent with gens but my evasion skills are definitely lacking. I’m on the switch, idk if that makes a difference. My first game, I spawned pretty close to the killer and I was hung up in at least the first 10-15 seconds. He was a level 20 but all his slots were completely decked out. It’s pretty disheartening.  Thanks for the info.

---
This keeps happening, games, crashes while loading. Every freakin time i open this game and try to play it
---
Am I the only one who really, really doesn't like the blighted skins?
---
Hag is ridiculously powerful versus solo queue since no one is feeding the team info on where her traps are. Even then of you run her ultra rares you'll destroy even seasoned survivors. I got my ass utterly eaten by a Hag running Mint Rag and Rusty Shackles last night because I wasn't paying attention to where she had all her shit set up.
---
LITER OF COLA.
---
hooks and bear traps only
---
i love running borrowed time, we’ll make it, empathy/wglf and self care.
---
I started this morning reset to a 17 and I went to an 18 in three games because the killers were so good. I’ve died every single game I’ve played.
---
I’m almost positive they removed depipping from below rank 15.
---
I mean, I'm not experienced with this kind of stuff but depending on how long it took for the other dude to get the gen(s) done and escape it could be counted as bodyblocking and would very well be temp bannable.
---
You don't need to call people dumb its literally just a video game.
---
not everyone plays the game religiously.. sorry but this general argument is stupid.
---
They chill alone, it was answered on their reddit AMA
---
Nurse isn‘t undead
---
There is a difference between someone being op and someone being just unfun.  
---
I dont say Freddy is op. He is okay I think.  
---
But its just NOT fun to play against and for me personally not fun to play as.  
---
Hell I like to play against Spirit more than Freddy, because atleast the games end faster.
---
"NYAHHH!!"
---
~Rin Probably.
---
$5 says they fix it and it causes players to drop through the floor.
---
I meant all the people still alive (3 of them)
---
"Ara ara oni chan"
---
ranking is just bad at this point. it’s a time commitment, nothing to do with skill. anyone can get to a rank and sit there safety pipping.
---
I havent gotten a single 2k or 1k as Freddy, and I'm rank 1 who's constantly playing. 
---
Low key kinda broken
---
They did do something.  They nerfed the effects of all the Forever Freddy Addons yesterday.
---
Spirit is ridiculously op devs please fix how cant tell if shes phasewalking towards you when you’re right next to her. That is dumb op asf shit
---
Near direct quote from their recent Q&amp;A:
---
"When outside of the Trial, Killers are either in a Null zone being tortured by the Entity or (something about being somewhere waiting for a trial). Killers can also be tossed into the Void when they lose use to the Entity."
---
Unfortunately, that's the answer. At least Legion gets to stay together.
---
It's nice that I don't have to deal with constant red ranks but the new system just means that I'll stop ebjoying the game faster.
---
The drawing is good but i just cant say i wanted to see It cuz i thought you just merged pig and a dog and It looked traumaticing to me
---
Spirit is dumb op
---
Oh shit it is-
---
But I don't have 4k hours in the game man so ruin is a massive help to me. I believe it is possible but extremely difficult unless you have played this game a lot or try incredibly hard every game.
---
Btw what are your add ons for doc? I find the base shock therapy hard to hit but people say the 25% + range but longer charge time is bad?
---
I’m going to go with chilling in a cheers style killer bar where everyone gets hyped up when someone walks in. *door opens* “TRAPPER!”
---
So you want a re-work of his re-work?
---
I swear this game cancels my heals all the time for no reason.
---
No, I agree. Only one I like is Jake's.
---
I don't think a living person could have a pillowcase wrapped around their head enough to suffocate them and fucking *float* and stay alive
---
So you’ve never called anybody dumb before? 
---
Anybody who goes out of their way to ruin things for other people isn’t a very good person.
---
His lunge is the same as anyone else
---
forever freddy was already nerfed
---
Oh so he’s being nerfed to console level oni now. So he’ll be the same on console as he was before
---
Imagine if they somehow added proximity based voice chat like Friday the 13th where the killer could hear as well? I know it would totally change the way the game was played but it would be an interesting addition and might encourage more team play between random players and add new depth regarding immersion and aggressive play. 
---
I.e. imagine that teabagging Nea just screaming COME AT ME! Followed by rapidfire clicking of her flashlight xD
---
I honestly dont know what they could do to make it more fun, but there has to be a better way except another rework.
---
This reminds me of that one sponge bob episode
---
You are definitely playing him perkless or wrong then.
---
#LIGHTPORN
---
take out snares, only have pallets
---
I believe it started o. December 17 last year, so there is still a little time before I get disappointed.
---
Give it some time and you'll be bitter and jaded too...down here with the rest of us.
---
The giant lunge makes Mikey pretty hard to dodge in T3. All your vaults have to be a quarter second or so earlier which leaves you that much more vulnerable to double-backs. Also he gets quicker vaults, although that one doesn't get me too often since choosing to vault as killer isn't that good in general. 
---
Not to mention the dramatic ass tier up music stresses me the fuck out and makes me loop worse lol.
---
Year 3 because original killers are amazing.
---
Legion's chapter at launch was aids though.
---
Is that an addon?
---
What? Bruh I always be getting 4k or 3k with a broken build
---
I choose to ignore all of that and believe saminations version.
---
Lmaooo I was literally watching Spiderman 3 last night and I had the exact same idea when I saw this scene. Glad I saw ur meme before I went out and made the third iteration lol
---
“I know it’s not an efficient build but I’m just having fun.”
---
I don’t think you understand what a joke is lmao. OP is implying that oni received unjust nerfs like legion, when in reality he was fixed.
---
This reminds me of Pinwheel.
---
Yup, it's amada's letter.
---
You lose 3 of your traps but you gain the ability to see survivor auras when you're crouched within 12 meters
---
No I havent actually. Again, I feel like you need a reminder... its a video game. Don't insult people so easily, it's not what a "very good person" would do.
---
The dankest timeline
---
Jund just a streamer who pretends to be killer oriented so he can pander to survivor mains to make money. it's ez bucks
---
he does this thing, same as scorpionz, where he pretends all you need to do well with spirit is shadowborn but both of them get rolled in most of their games when they do that
---
For me personally it's mostly Huntress, Trapper, Ghostface, and Plague.
---
I see what you’re saying now. 
---
“I haven’t gotten a single 2k or 1k as Freddy” made me think you weren’t getting literally anyone. 
---
My apologies.
---
Dedicated servers be like
---
You gucci. And 0k*
---
I enjoy the fact the community refuses to believe the actual canon and all have a sitcom in their head of the killer's lives.
---
Right. What a morally upstanding citizen you are. Never negative. 
---
I don’t really act nice to people when they try to take fun away from others. I will do what I do. You will do what do. Thank you.
---
Loops billy for a century
---
Billy: *THATS IT! I’M GETTIN’ ME MALLET!*
---
Until they come back. I don't always want to farm
---
Yeah, as far as the first hit.
---
I find alot of killers will predict me when LOS is lost. The idea here being he wouldnt expect me to double back but rather put the pallet between me and him on the other side of the wall. Doesnt always work tho : /
---
60 seconds is easily 2 or 3 generators depending on the number of other survivors alive and their loadouts. Letting a survivor go free is not valid as counterplay. DS should at least not allow the survivor to force the killer into a stun by getting in a locker in front of them or by getting grabbed while unhooking. 
---
consider this: suppose Overcharge got reworked so that when the killer kicks a generator, the killer gets a DS-style skillcheck. if the check succeeds, thye next person to touch the generator within 60 seconds is instantly downed. and this works up to 4 times per game, just like DS. Survivors would be pretty pissed at this bullshit right? so the killers respond with "I already kicked that one, lol just dont tunnel the gens." it's their base objective. not reasonable.
---
It's more fun and entertaining that way
---
“Pharmacy&gt;selfcare”
---
Heck yeah! Who do you play? Who are your favorites so far?
---
I need the items NOW (jk) but let me know when there done!
---
Just making sure you’re aware that he didn’t ask for build advice or perk criticism. 
---
Glad we cleared that up.
---
May I suggest Otzdarva?

On next episode of "meet the killers" Rin tries to set her grandpa up on a blind date... with the plauge!?

Oni coming at you being so strong he is swinging part of a statue down on you.
---
I’m 100% positive I was 16 when I went to bed, a 17 this morning and an 18 now.
---
You can only mori the killer if ur Nea!
---
Michael on a bicycle!
---
Ignore him this guy doesn't understand a thing about what he's talking about.  You'll find cynical noobs like this on here often.  Just wanted to point that out because you're still new enough to the game yourself where you might not recognize what they said as being 100% horseshit.
---
You’re using the annoying bitchy survivor main definition of tunneling to try and prove your point. The definition of tunneling is not “killing survivors” and you’re an idiot if you think that. It’s only going for one survivor until they’re dead. Which is shitty. If I chase a healthy survivor to the hook, they get the unhook, and then I change targets and down/rehook the person who just got off, that’s shitty. They don’t get a chance to play the game. It’s not hard to not do that. And if you find yourself doing that, you’re a piece of shit and/or bad at the game.
---
Aren't devs voicing the characters in game?
---
On console the button for pulling down pallets and starting to heal is the same one, so because the heal was cancelled, the "heal" prompt was replaced with the "pull down" prompt.
---
He specifically said they either were not the best, or were nerfed.
---
Clearly hes implying Demo wasnt meeting his standards even after the buff. I dont remember if the buff was significant but Demo had something done to change his shred no?
---
Mike on a bike.
---
How dare she talk to daddy myers that way.
---
It’s a really big sword. Too big I guess for them to wanna put it in. So they cut it in half
---
Ladies and gentleman, the smartest and most reasonable person on Reddit. Round of applause for this man/woman/Apache helicopter.
---
tru3 literally didn't so anything wrong here at all
---
False. Bottom frame should be porn.
---
It is literally impossible to depip from ranks 16-20. You can only get rank reset down from 16 to 17 after this newest patch. 
---
If you somehow depipped even further after rank 17, I would record that and submit it as a support ticket.
---
If your on console this nerf probably doesnt change anything since you can’t really do the flick.
---
I just want my doctor rework lol
---
Some of them, not all. I'm not sure if they're devs either, but they do work for BHVR in some way.
---
It's if the unhooker is in the killer's terror radius, not 32 meters, which is an important distinction against stealth killers and Freddy
---
Maybe that’s why they did it? So console players didn’t have to feel left out? If that’s why it seems unnecessary (unless they get cross platform play? Plz)
---
It’s sad to see myers become irrelevant because of ghostface all he did was copy him and boom he becomes more popular.
---
Are people seeing a lot of thanatophobia? Isn't it ass?
---
It’s not live anymore, that was the point of my post lol.
---
Its Pig and Tapp
---
When
---
You can, it's a low chance.
---
On the day of rank reset as well have fun and good luck lol.
---
If I recal it helps you
---
* better chance of unhooking yourself
---
* better chance of breaking out of trapper's traps
---
* better chance of finding nice things in chests
---
might have forgotten something
---
Yeah it is console with a controller, it's usually hard to do this for me only because of the shit house internet in my area. That's the reason why I'm proud.
---
Thank you. It took a lot of brain power.
---
Ok but you do realize the new map is like kinda rectangular right? Its shaped like azarovs resting place. Not at all a circle
---
Berserk reference
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of tapping spacebar for 80 seconds or whatever. It's not fun, it's just annoying.
---
I watch him to but ohm is still my fav
---
the audacity of having anyone in the game who isn't a 1:1 representation of me smh my head
---
Best VA in the whole game.
---
He definitely wasn't weak at all.
---
Admittedly i haven't played him much, but from what i've seen, he is indeed very strong. The only real issue i have with him is the inconsistancy of his kit, as you can sometimes fully stalk someone mid-chase, or you can end up revealed before you even realise it. I do plan on thouroughly giving him a try in the near future, as i'd like to get my hands on both Thrilling Tremors and I'm all Ears.
---
Hex: Sleep Selfie
---
you do a 80s gen in ~74 seconds. The speed increase to other things might as well not exist, cuz it's so minimal. Def. not worth a perk slot
---
The only killers I have ever claimed to main are Huntress and Legion, who I play roughly equal amounts of.
---
I'm sitting happily in purple ranks as a Pig main on my Xbox. I like to think I'm decent.
---
So I booted up my girlfriends Xbox the other night to do some of her rituals and archives. She NEVER plays killer, so she's rank 19. I felt immense guilt for my back to back to back 4ks. Trapper with terrible perks and add ons. My victories were undeserved. I caught people with the worst trap placements. No one could hit a skill check, everyone hid in a locker, and EVERYONE was Dwight. I'll go back to purple rank now where my gameplay takes effort lol
---
Tip: (you probably know this) Play your best survivor and put the BP into your person u want teachables for.
---
So....is she a ghost then? If not undead, what category would you put her in?
---
yeah and now with the new rank reset system you'll never see the lower ranks again. Here come the smurfs and derankers
---
Happy to help with the balance and numbers. Studying existing perks and balance changes taught me a lot when it comes to balancing concepts
---
He's really fun to play as, though. Mindgaming the teleport, trap play that doesn't take forever to set up but also isn't an insta-down, and he's great with kids. Freddy #1!
---
There was a nerf a while back that I created had times.  That right there made Self Care garbage.  Then to make things worse Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia became meta af and are all over our lobbies.  These perks are literally ran to destroy Self Care Gamers.  You can't waste almost a minute a pop healing and expect the killer not to savage your team since if everyones Self Caring the game away they aren't completing the gens efficiently which translates into a 5th gen pressure killer perk he tricks survivors into running for them.  On top of all of this there are currently several top tier killers known for intense map pressure that basically require you to plug away aggressively on gens if they are played by anyone solid-good.  
---
Self Care is hot trash now.  Learn to be comfortable injured and take heals when you stumble into others on gens.  You'll be a much better teamate for it.
---
I was thinking "Meyers on tires" but that works too.
---
My fiancé and I think it’s pretty fun. I just wish I was better.
---
Welcome to Reddit.... I guess?
---
Probably a shit idea but what if they implemented skill checks for struggling? That would counter act some perks tho like boil over. I would just rather not break my analog stick and still get hooked in the process.
---
Imagine ever not using Pop Goes the Weasel
---
lmao
---
I don't know. I find the long distance hook camping play style pretty dull. I usually also play her like a trapper and focus on a 3 gen strat because of her movement speed.
---
Ohm is definietly my favorite of the group.
---
Interesting to listen to but not nearly as loud as Delerious.
---
Wtf is this Karen in the car
---
That's unsettling and disturbing. I think I like it but I'm not sure
---
“ThE ReVErSE BeAr-TrAP Is JuSt a giMmiCK”
---
Self care or urban evasión?
---
That's 4 words though...
---
Delerious and him together are great lol especially when they play last year together
---
We'll make it is only for healing others.
---
Shitty pathetic game this is. Definitely gonna uninstall and get my money back
---
It’s such a disappointment. I wish I would’ve know so I didn’t waste my shards on them. I’ve been waiting for Tenacity to be in the Shrine forever. I’m not gonna be online for a bit so I won’t be able to get it now.
---
Apparently it was intended to be an immersive feature. Feel the stress of fighting off death. The thing is, it is only speeding up the death of my controller's button.
---
i didnt say killers should have no risks if they choose to go after one person disregarding all others until they're dead. I'm saying they shouldnt bepenalized for going after a recently unhooked survivor when there's no other/better option. 
---
If someone unhooks when I'm already near, leaving the inujured, svaed survivor in front of me, and doesnt have BT, it's not my fault when they get downed. they can use DS top counter me, but I have every right to counter DS by slugging them while I chase or search for the "savior" while the slugged person has a chance to counter me by crawling away and heal or get healed. these are reasonable counterplays to each other.
---
However, when the survivor decides to deliberately quick hide in a locker in front of me, I have no reasonable counterplay. I can no longer slug them and avoid the stun, I can only stand there for 60 seconds while 2-3 gens get done, I can let them go free, or I can eat the stun that can no longer be reduced by enduring and basically let them go free. this is really more like an explit on their part, and they deliberately hid in the locker for that reason of it being uncounterable.
---
He was running him for around 20 minutes actually. A guy in the stream even said he took a shower at the beginning of the match and when he was done, noob was still playing the same match.
---
Meg
---
alternate ending: He gets nerfed
---
They released stats fairly recently, although they were merged across platforms. Freddy is currently the strongest Killer (which kind of makes the game P2W, incidentally), with Clown as the weakest at red ranks. But that's calculated by kill rate, which isn't the best metric.
---
idk then. but ps4 has always needed ps plus to play. any game you want to play online needs PS Plus actually unless the game is free on the PS Store.
---
Its her father
---
Then i has to be that you or someone that used the console had a subscription to ps+. Probably a 6 month or 1 year long one at that since you went uninterupted.
---
You can actually, but it will bug the game and sometimes you can't use your power.
---
you do realize some people don’t want to spend hours on a game every single month, right? people take breaks and have things to do. i personally lose motivation to play a week after rank reset. believe it or not, tons of those who play this game are just casual players and don’t feel the need to invest time getting to a certain rank.
---
That's kind of dumb especially since I've payed like 60 dollars in dlc. Guess I'll have to start over on the switch version
---
&gt; it's one of those perks I've never really thought twice about.
---
there really wasnlt a reason to for a long time lol but now Furtive Chase can be implemented into builds thanks to Nemesis
---
also Furtive Chase *could* pay off with this build with a survivor taking you to others who get caught off guard but I wouldn't bet on it
---
How do you do that?
---
I have no clue what happened to be honest.
---
They nerfed the speed increase a few weeks ago but I believe Spirit and Wraith are currently bugged so they don’t receive their speed increase at all.
---
I got lazy tbh, just like the devs of the Quentin model. Ahh, the burn..
---
it shouldn't be hurting your hand. rotate your stick in any direction instead of actually wiggling it.
---
Probably because you're telling people to run Self Care lol.  It really is a killer perk at this point in the games meta.  Self Care Gamers have killed more survivors at this point than Nurse and Spirit combined.
---
Then survivors would know the meta locations and we'd be back to square one.
---
Oh rotate it??? I’ll try it, thank you 😊
---
Yo dude how did you come up with Post-Its shits fire
---
Really wish I could just sit down and read the lore. Feel like it would answer so many of my questions and head cannon.
---
I mean I'm always down to see something other than fury/pop/ruin/enduring in my games.
---
Don’t worry I see it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Def not a meta perk but I wouldn’t say that saving around half a minute on 4gen just with a perk is a waste of a slot. And it’s not only gen related since your vault is faster, opening exits is faster, unhooking and healing are faster as well. I might agree that alone the perk isn’t clutch, but paired with an item can be imo
---
Once you get to red ranks you'll almost always be there now too. Especially since the matchmaking range is 6 above and below from the start you'll be vsing rank 1s
---
They're definitely not garbage, for starters. And they are way more fun all around than snares
---
anyway, I'm kind of glad you replied to me because I actually peeked at your comment history previously today and I wanted to let you know that your whole "oooh I have a secret OP Freddy build" is peak neckbeard loser
---
Cant warp through time, and that pocket watch has the magical ability of making the effected person have super human endurance
---
The host has to be the main killer.(iirc) The second killer switches and makes his loadout, switches to spectator and waits. When all survivors ready up the killer will ready and you have to quickly switch to killer. Hope this helps.
---
welcome to club. but you don't have to start over. it's $60 for a year, or you can do what I do and make a new account every other week and get the free trial of PS plus. it's free, the only downside is that it will only last 2 weeks and then you have to make another account.
---
Ya unfortunately the biggest reason I dont play as much as I used to is I can't bring myself to spend more time in lobbies than in game anymore. It sucks I really hope they fix it but I dont hold much hope for it coming anytime soon lol.
---
She’s into kinky shit tho
---
1 hit hatchet Huntress be like....
---
rotating is insanely more consistent than wiggling.
---
Honestly it should just be cross play, maybe there aren't much player on consoles. I wonder if crossplay with pc is possible also, do PC players have any advantages with keyboard and mouse?
---
I'm in this subreddit for the memes mostly
---
Ok but get a pen and paper out because its a bit convoluted.
---
This game in particular i may or may not have been a bit drunk and panicked when picking perks and just fucked it up completely then just made it work.
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk
---
I don't know why but this put the picture of Yui wielding a Hatchet and using David as a meat shield while she battles the entity's spider legs in my head.
---
It’s an issue with there being not enough Killers.
---
I’m PS4 EU and if I queue as Survivor it takes anywhere up to 10 minutes for a lobby. If I queue as Killer I get one in 10 seconds, no matter my rank. There’s just not enough Killers on console.
---
Trust me, as someone that ended up farming a friend against a Freddy last night because I had been told it was fixed, it wasn't changed.
---
Can you delete the accounts I'm not gonna buy ps plus for one game especially when I'm already paying for switch online on one of my switches.
---
uncapped framerate most of time carries desync problems
---
Omg. That’s so clever. Went over my head at first haha
---
Someone is mogged they die by dream pallets. Low tier add-on, any decent survivor can avoid them.
---
You're sadcuzbad
---
Not five?
---
eh it can be pretty hard to use non-meta perks unless you're playing at lower ranks. once you're in purple and above you face the same 4 strong builds every game and you need to keep up.
---
but i do try to mess around with builds on my killers except Huntress who I really do need a standard meta build on all the time because I play on console
---
Never go out without your pocket watch !
---
Exactly! I'm pretty sure it's not good game design to have player actually regret getting good at the game.
---
Nerf Ghostface your gay
---
That's how queue works. Less players play the game or play the other side, you have to wait a while for game. And do you know how bad matchmaking already is with ranks? Red ranks get put with grey ranks all the time. You can see people complaining about it all the time on here. Always getting put with people 16 ranks higher than you would kill the game for new and worse players and then we'd be back to square one.
---
You use are. The streamers are the subject of the sentence in this case, meaning the verb is based on them. You would say birds are a flock, not birds is a flock.
---
Source: I’ve done a fair bit of editing work and I’m studying English in college rn
---
Same thought here...putting IT in the logo like that sells it for me alone.
---
Yeah thats great. But you cant post stuff like this here. Make a shitty meme instead.
---
Shirtless guy jumping out the window?
---
Guess someone's husband had just come home...
---
What's his name?
---
Wtf are you talking about? Hillbilly without addons is probably the most balanced killer in a game. Just rework his addons, that's all he needs
---
I would say huntress considering there’s things you can download to get crosshair plus the stable 60 fps compared to the lock 30fps on console. Other than that I don’t really see any other issues
---
indeed you can delete the accounts.
---
Lmao you sound so dumb saying you went and searched there comment history dude. Are you 12?
---
Ok good
---
You can't.

Maybe you got some deal with a free subscription?

You need to pay on consoles to be able to play online games. That's how it's always been, and it sucks.
---
That's untrue, though. Botany Knowledge stacks with We'll Make It, as well as using a medkit with healing speed add-ons. It can be extremely fast.
---
The "Cumulative healing speed cannot exceed 100%" is left over from when the perk used to change two values per level: the duration the healing buff lasted as well as how much speed per unhook it received (50%/75%/100%).
---
In general, thats my bubba game, get up close.
---
then you shouldn't care about rank reset if you don't play that much, your still in the shitter ranks regardless

Which has good news - supposedly it SHOULD settle next year around July from what I heard.   
---
Jason has a chance
---
Man I miss when online games were free
---
Am I crazy or have those last 2 points always been true?
---
found key in game, got consumed when hatch was opened?
---
Plunderers'd a key?
---
thx
---
Imagine the devs think its ok for console players to have shitty fps for 3 years. Weird.
---
I know, unfortunately. I do have hope for the future though.
---
Gorilla as next killer confirmed.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
How does PC killers have an advantage against console tho? Like all you're doing as a survivor is running away and you're still in 3rd person. I don't really see any advantages much pls explain
---
Most gaming monitors have built in crosshair overlays that can be toggled at this point (mine does at least), no software required.
---

---
I'll have to try something similar on mine then. Nothing like mind games and chainsaws to keep the evening lively.
---
not sure what meta means but the best perks are the bps ones, BBq and WGLF
---
Not_Queen I believe
---
Please time it then, because it is not much faster. It's a little faster, but the chainsaw pallet break is definitely better. 
---
Yeah, it says he has an extended lunge range. I know that. It doesn't say exactly how much. Myers has a 0.6s lunge I believe. That's useful information. Just extended lunge range is not because it's obvious. 
---
I mean, I've already got Oni to P1 and it seems like there's a lot less control. You're relegated to one direction more or less when your lunge starts. You can't turn like a normal lunge attack. It really doesn't have the same control, even outside of Rush. 
---
Yeah. I'm not arguing that Myers is S tier. He gets dumpstered by a sweat squad, too. Same as Oni. Unfortunately. 
---
Yeah. When survivors can read your every move, kind of makes it difficult to kill them. Killers that take away surv information are the most viable. And considering how in red ranks, survivors are the power role, not killers, at least a few killers need to be viable. Oni is not viable vs the best survivors. 
---
His charge is good but it's easy to juke. Billy had more consistent map pressure and can always chainsaw people. Tbh I think people who try to argue Billy is worse than Oni(not saying you) are kind of braindead.
---
really can't believe people were saying old legion is back when you know for a fact devs would never let that happen
---
you know, you could actually help the problem by playing killer sometimes
---
&gt; I don’t think they care about fixing it, I hate to say it.
---
they can't magically make people play killer
---
Damn, XD
---
Meta is basically what's best or most efficient to use in game to win. So the perks you mentioned would be meta, something like Tenacity for instance, is non meta.
---
&gt; But what if you are slugged and the killer is camping or patrolling you? Theres no counterplay there.
---
There is. gen rush, distract the killer, crouch closely and finish the heal, all of these work. Slugging counters DS. healing and/or getting a new target counters slugging. Lockers to force a grab have no counter. 
---
Look, a locker to force Decisive Strike nullifies killers by taking their only objective, capturing survivors to be hooked, and turns it into the survivor escaping, the number one thing they can't allow. All due to a skill check they have no control over. 
---
So let me adjust my overcharge rework example: When the survivors finish a generator, (their objective, just as hooking is the killer's) the killer gets a token. 4 per game, no more (same number of times Decisive can be used). Killer kicks a gen, uses a token, gets a difficult skill check. for the next 60 seconds, any survivor on the generator when it gets to 85% completion instantly gets downed. It's ok if they just tap it to stop the regression (like slugging) but if they get close to finishing it (like a grab just before getting hooked) they go down. which they are to avoid above all (like the killer is supposed to avoid letting the survivor escaping his grasp, it even affects pips after all.) Now on top of that, there's also a way killers can force survivors to not let go of the generator. which means the survivor is almost certain to get to 85% completion before the timer runs out. (just like how Survivors can force a Decisive grab by jumping ina  locker in front of the killer's face.)
---
Is the last part in particular fair? not really. but this is equivalent to allowing lockers to force DS stuns.
---
Yes! I need to wear the Jane sweater so people can ask why a grown ass man has a pink sweater with the name Jane on it
---
It’s goes both ways, it’s stupid how many survivors use self care and dead hard even though they aren’t too useful.
---
I prefer using my shards on killers. I wasted shards on shrine parks early when I could've just bought the unlicensed killer with them.
---
I thought the blood would look cool but i was wrong, maybe i'll just tone down the blood next time.
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
If you listen closely you can hear my rational leave my body
---
I’ve been playing this game for a very long time now. I’ve seen multiple changes to the queues. No that’s not how queue works. “Less players play the game” etc because if you were around several months ago they did something where we were paired with any ranked players and games were instant.  Though it’s not fair for new players to go against red ranks- I can see them potentially figuring something out to avoid 20s and 1s. 
---
I thought once dedicated servers came out that might be our only hope. I could get paired with a rank 1 killer in Europe and games would run fine. Which ultimately gives us quicker games... that’s the only thing I can think of helping
---
Not really. Imagine throwing a balloon down a hallway on Lery's towards a gen. You could then walk over, kick a different gen then teleport to where the balloon has gone instantly.
---
It would also be like Hag, where survivors can see you have a choice to teleport in front of them and have to make a decision where to go that could be straight at you.
---
Resilience should be meta. once people understand just how good it is it will be im sure.
---
So i wont say its my fav, instead, i would go with Poised. That perk on a map like rotten fields makes you impossible to track. or hope.
---
My least fav would prob be aura based survivor perks. i just dont think they fit my playstyle.
---
ChillBilly, nice
---
This is so wholesome.
---
Try your best to reserve your power when you use it because it seems like the second it runs out is when you need it. Sloppy butcher is a must on this killer imo.
---
literally trapper/hillbilly but blue. nty
---
You’re not immature to look at someone’s comment history. Toxic people will shame you for pointing out their consistently toxic behavior.
---
Idk about having rank 16s queuing up with me. The wait times are horrible for sure, but getting into a lobby with bad survivors against a good killer is not enjoyable either, in fact rage inducing.
---
Holy shit I need this and I dont even play legion
---
I remember when I felt this way, it fades rather quickly believe me but dbd is still unlike any other game for me.
---
But since survivors are in 3rd person on both PC and console and don't really need to aim besides flashlight its basically the same right? Survivors are basically just running away and looking at their surroundings with 3rd person its the exact same to me
---
Rule Set No.3
---
Survivors with RTB on can't fucking access to any of the Jigsaw Boxes, leaving them to die.

Actually if you press F6 on your keyboard near a window you can mount the window and pull your pants down, thats what i did but i cut it short to keep it PG
---
I think Susie should be the main head as the presence of the others destroyed her and infected her, corrupting her into a killer. Their heads growing from her like tumours would symbolize that.
---
Frank being the main one for this skin I think wouldn’t make as much sense since he really was the one who corrupted them, if anything having franks head growing out of the back of each of their heads would make more sense since they’re really just his lackeys since he’s essentially just a teenage cult leader
---
Me too
---
Please don't call him that ever again.
---
Heard someone in the comments a while back that just said that now the mending state is just like the injured state except there is a flashing orange bar.
---
See you later change was more because of beast of prey than nemesis
---
The number of times I've been cucked trying to vault a window in the office on Azarov's Rest only to fast vault into a locker is triggering. I wish that we could map specific actions to certain keys instead of an all-purpose action button.
---
Thats actually really funny
---
What makes you assume I don’t play killer?  I don’t think I put anything stating I don’t play killer...? 
---
I can make a post about queue times on console without having someone telling me to go play killer.  I single handily can’t change queue times and I wanna play survivor. 
---
But I do enjoy playing Hag, Spirit and Michael often.  Tysm
---
Legion was that learning experience for me. Buy them half a year later, youll get them on a sale in addition to some security. If survivors still complain at that time in any noticeable numbers, dont get them at all.
---
I could try to remake it, I thought the blood would look cool. Sorry.
---
i just thought i’d post this. i’m not a professional btw so don’t hate me.
---
Pwtf is nice too
---
Play how you want. Do you wanna farm as much BP as possible? Run perks like BBQ, Distressing, and Beast of Prey. Do you hate pallets with a passion and want to get them off the map asap? Run Enduring and Spirit Fury. Do you wanna slow the game down (just a little bit lol?) Run Ruin and Thanto. In the past I've had times where I just wanted to quit. I just picked up another killer and tried out many different builds. Just have fun! Fuck what other players say to you.

Learn where and how to mindgame. Scott has a pretty good video running through common tiles.

*Trap Trap Clauduette*
---
ye I thought the same at first all good
---
Didn't she enter the hospital of nurse and no one heard from here ever again even her parent's didn't give a shit
---
no that is not good 4head
---
You missed it but on Black Friday they do!
---
Right?! Like, now that self care has fallen out of favour with all the nerfs, I don't understand how resilience is still so slept on.  Legit have yet to see another survivor besides me in-game to use lol.
---
that is another one all the short versions of perks
---
Hahaha I'm a huntress and nurse main. I only place huntress if i get bored of nurse
---
Thats cool but i want pop dolls or the hell is the name for dbd ...
---
Hands down, yes. Yes to all that you said. If he sees this, I would personally like to apologize for using the trend of making fun of Quentins appearance for reddit upvotes.
---
yeah, cause the non hero definitely saves a photo 2 minutes after it’s uploaded to prove that it’s “sToLeN,” leaves an entitled comment and backtracks afterwards.
---
it’s a tiny ass watermark. i do that for everything i make out of habit. i’ve had the most random shit stolen and posted no matter how simple it was. 
---
i tested the lockscreen and just setting this as your wallpaper already crops it out for you.
---
yk, but of course call me a dumbass after being proved wrong. sounds logical.
---
I play on both PC and PS4. Killer cues are a nightmare on PC and Survivor cues are terrible on PS4. I’d be willing to assume the FPS issues on console deter a lot of people from playing as killer.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
What else would he call us? "The frontal penatraters?"
---
what didnt happen to self care
---
I've definitely turned more than 30^(o) ever since the 'nerf'. You used to able to literally do a full 180, now it's more like 60^(o)\-90^(o) max
---
&gt; All I’m doing is talking about survivor queue times on PS4. It’s a fact. Many people agree.
---
...I know that. And the reason is a lack of killers.
---
&gt; But to shut it down, I do play killer often (not as often I don’t turn on the game as much lately) but I love playing killer. But this is about queue times so let me shut that down now
---
Again, I know it's about queue times. The solution is more killer players. And I told you to do that because, despite your insistence otherwise, it's clear you don't
---
its the f2p currency for pay items, almost no devs put that shit on sale lmao
---
Yea but even if the nurses have better aim on PC it doesn't  change the fact that survivors on PC and console are still the same playing on PC against a nurse isn't going to give survivors a better chance to survive  than on console, also I don't think the skill gap on PC is better I hate when ppl say this, on PC most games that requires aim are just better with a mouse. Being on PC doesn't make you better if a console player gets used to playing with mouse they'd be just as good and if a PC player goes from PC to console it would take them longer to get as good bc its harder to aim with a controller
---
Same! Whenever I play huntress I hear the fucking sound of it hitting a wall or a rock and watch the survivor downed thinking if it was an impossible hit on my end how fucking infuriating it was on their end
---
Just seeing that drifting red balloon, wandoring if it will just harmlessly pop and startle you or if a fear eating clown will emerge from it is the type of shit I'm all for
---
Nobody plays PS4. let the PC players talk.
---
Yea that's what I said, the killer is a little better on PC but survivors are the same pretty much. Unless this have a killer vs killer mode then it would be unfair
---
I'm 5head, you're 4head.
---
Probably never. The short of it is, the rights to Friday the 13th are a fuckin' minefield. In irradiated lands. During a hail storm.
---
The writer of the first movie went litigious trying to take over the franchise, and in the process killed it.
---
This is literally the main reason I don't play survivor
---
AFAIK queen only voices spirit
---
My go to was breeders but that's *way* better
---
Always run Borrowed Time.
---
GL friend.
---
&gt; like burning through the acquired blood faster during cruising
---
Thing is, this is how he's intended to work. There's a loading screen tip that says this exact thing actually happens. Except it doesn't.
---
Pretty good job so far, I guess
---
Ghostface. He is best for grabs. T1 Michael can pull them off too.
---
All I can say is Poor Legion
---
doctor. hook someone, use treatment mode, spam attack button behind them for an auto grab
---
Yep. Despite survivor main insistence otherwise, they have pretty much been getting what they want all the time, and it's affecting the playerbase
---
oh my god it's mobile wtf
---
You don’t need a specific killer. Pressing the attack, but not lunge, when close to a survivor who is busy will interrupt them. If they’re working on a gen, vaulting a window when injured, or unhooking someone, they can be grabbed. For the tome I recommend using ghostface or pig and grabbing people off gens. I used pig.
---
That guy either uninstalled or next match he went full tryhard with iri head Huntress and a ebony mori
---
I wonder who mixes the game sfx and music.  Do they have a music team?  Or do they outsource to a studio.
---
I always hear ambient sound that sounds like a locker being closed
---
Yeah its mobile.. omg that someone still dont know this game is on mobile more than 3months ago...
---
I think he said that because Feng is the one with the Trapper face surgical mask
---
I run into a lot of Deriks
---
Micycle on a bicycle
---
Mad grit is stupid fun. For survivors I like Yui's new pallet perk.
---
any stealth killer tbh
---
If you continually say you’re amazing than you’re probably not amazing.
---
I wasn’t trying to chide or anything, not a lot of people know this about the game model of Quentin so I wasn’t trying to bash and my last sentence may of came off as rude, so I’m sorry if it did. We all just try to have a laugh, but sometimes holidays can be hard, and I just remember in the AMA a developer came out and said that he was the guy they modeled Quentin after.
---
What part of the game are you on?
---
omg someone that doesn't realize that because I live in a part of the world that the app isn't allowed on google play I forget it exist
---
Itssa me, House Of Pain
---
This is so very true...
---
Demogorgon for meme potential. He’s very expressive when you nod/shake your head.
---
The counterplay to Oni is delaying him getting his power for as long as possible. The first hit is so important for him, so dropping pallets early to ensure that he either has to break it or go around is actually a good solution. Once he actually gets his power, he becomes very strong . And that's the tradeoff, it's meant to be powerful but not always accessible. The 180 flick was not intended as it's only meant to be 90 degrees max, because you really don't need more turning than that.
---
this
---
Because you can’t. It’s fake
---
Women is obviously a Democrat
---
BHVR.net/yougotb4mb00z13d.org
---
Oh I meme so hard in my games that's perfect
---
If you have footage then I’d like to see. I’ve seen a lot of people saying this, but in my gameplay and many content creator’s gameplay from this patch, I have not seen an Oni stop during his dash, and turn completely to his left/right. You WERE able to do 180s on the PTB, but that was nerfed to 90 degrees upon the chapter hitting live servers, and THEN this hotfix has lowered it to roughly 30 degrees. I’ll believe you no problem if there’s footage of this happening. Scott Jund’s gameplay, Zubat’s, or any reputable DbD player that played Oni on release/PTB has footage of his flick going at about 90 degrees, but just about all of them have discussed that the flick is about 30 degrees now, and that’s what I’ve found with testing.
---
you just downloaded a virus fam, congrats.
---
Otherwise, you downloaded a super old file that only worked years ago.
---
My favorite comment tbh
---
Clearly you don’t play PS4 very often. I’ve been playing almost the full 3 years, I’ve been all ranks, it’s virtually the only game I play. 
---
Camping is EXTREMELY common on PS4. Because the PS4 community is the most toxic in the DBD community. On killer AND survivor side. 
---
Yes there are more survivors than killer, I never said otherwise.
---
The PS4 community is much smaller than it used to be, which adds to wait times. The main reason being that DBD is insanely rough at the start without at least one friend to guide you, plus the issues that come with console. 
---
It isn’t a matter of pretending, it’s fact. There are SIGNIFICANTLY less players on PS4 than there used to be. The player base spiked in 2018 when the game went free to play on ps plus for the month. By the time Legion came out, a huge chunk of people left. The bugs that came with each DLC made it worse and worse over time. Many people simply gave up because of the issues and either gave up entirely or moved up to PC.
---
Very true. I think it is just licensing honestly, because Laurie has her issues as well, and those two are typically the only ones I have problems with when it comes to the modeling. There is no such thing as a perfect game and there will always be flaws, but when it comes to the models I think they’ve done some pretty good work all things considered, mainly because that’s where they get the money from haha, but I enjoy the game a lot too. There are faults, but that’s with everything
---
*Yeah 20 years from now*
---
Every platform has a lack of killers, so crossplay isn't going to help in the way you think it will.
---
As it stands, PS4 survivors are waiting for PS4 Killers to get into a game.
---
If we introduce crossplay, PS4 Survivors will be able to get into a game with PS4, Switch, XBox1, and PC Killers... But you'll also be waiting for Switch, XBox1, and PC Survivors to take those same pool of killers.
---
Since all platforms have a lack of killers, you'll just be pooling the problem together instead of actually solving it.
---
Yes its clear now! Thanks a lot! Other reddit guys cant even help just attack the new players... another question: how can you find the hatch easily? Many times survivors run directly to the hatch while i m the survivor i have no idea how to find it :/
---
I have the same problem! I sit in the queue for about 20 minutes and then get placed with rank 10 survivors.
---
That's bad.
---
Already posted there
---
Now I want a piggy addon there everyone starts with a RTB. That would be such a mess and very intresting
---
Except for the 360, which had paid subscription.. And the PS3... And some games for the PS2... And the original Xbox.
---
Yeah... Just new consoles.
---
That’s hella cool
---
Games that are f2p and have multiple don’t require PS+ for the most part
---
You’re getting a hell of a lot more notes than you should be haha
---
Totally agree with this. I thought the flick was very strong, but it was strong because the rest of his power allowed it to be.
---
After getting to rank one once I now only play killler very casually at green ranks and that’s like one game every now and then. When I do play I play survivors because it’s so easy for me to shit on the killer and pip up. Even if he tunnels and camps I still rank up while he deranks I literally can’t loose as survivor
---
gg ez
---
:)
---
They want you to struggle thats why. The devs something like that in a interview not a very long time ago
---
my favorite would be dance with me; with quick and quiet and/or head on, you can make some crazy plays also it gives the ability to end chases at your will as well as prolong them.
---
As it it NOT longer Meta i despise self-care with all of my being. it is usually faster to just seach for a teammate or dont bother healing and just doing a gen. the rare cases in which selfcare COULD be useful it is STILL too slow to do what its supposed to. I've lost so many games because of some blendettes selfcareing in a corner insted of just doing Objectives.
---
I love bloodhound. especially on legion it is just brutal.  
---
For least favorite id say Iron Grasp. whenever i play survivor and the killer has iron, i know that i will get even more Basement-Time than i get anyway
---
Well, on certain maps the hatch spawns in some places more commonly than others. And maybe you just don't really notice the hatch during the game much.  Most people just see the hatch during the game and then just remember where it was.
---
so sad last ep is today :(
---
He should have one knife sized claw. I know you took autistic liberty in making Michael Myers a dragon. I just think having a knife like claw would be a more accurate to a Mike Myers dragonkin.
---
I've never owned an xbox console other than the 360 and the x1 for about a month. I've never owned a ps3 only 1 2 and 4 so I wouldnt know. Nintendo (up until the switch) had free online. The gamecube the wii the wii u and all generations and variations of ds systems even the switch had free online for the first year. So yeah really just new consoles
---
My favorite non-meta perk is Detective's Hunch, especially during rank reset when NOED is more common. A possible new favorite is Breakout because it was fun the 1 time I got it to work.
---
Least favorite is probably Lucky Break. More useless than Boil Over. An older perk for least favorite would be Slippery Meat/Ante Up because you might as well leave your perk slots open if you had to take those 2.
---
What's the best way to express you want to farm? Every time I try, the survivors run like I'm trying to play seriously. Even if I down someone and then pick / drop until they get back up
---
Nice bait.
---
Isn’t Ash the only licensed character voiced by the og actor?
---
I hated this challenge because I played like a absolute scumbag urban-ing around the map until hatch spawned
---
Resilience is only 6.6 seconds on gens. It's really only worth it for the faster window and pallet vaults, especially in combination with Spine Chill. I'd suggest avoiding running Dead Hard alongside these though, as they shorten its dash distance.
---
Object Of Obsession is my favourite non-meta perk. Dance With Me, Quick &amp; Quiet, Hope, Vigil and Fixated (in combination with Sprint Burst), Detective's Hunch (with Inner Strength), Bond, Kindred, Aftercare, Windows Of Opportunity, Poised, Botany Knowledge, Second Wind, Autodidact, Resilience and Spine Chill are more of the lesser-used perks I like to run frequently.
---
For killer, I enjoy Knock Out a fair bit. More of my flavour picks would be Play With Your Food, Fire Up, Corrupt Intervention, Thrill Of The Hunt, Haunted Ground, Third Seal, I'm All Ears, Infectious Fright (only popular on a select few killers), Blood Echo (on Legion and Plague), Nemesis (in combination with PWYF and/or Judith's Journal), Discordance, Thrilling Tremors, Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
Least-favourite perks are too many to list, as there's a ton of perks that are all hardly worth using and should all be buffed. Even many of the perks here listed could still be improved.
---
Otherwise known as blendette city! Where everybody is blendette!
---
What he did was taking your game hostage.  He quit playing the game to trap you and allowed your friend to complete the last gen, open an exit gate and leave uncontested.  He did it to bm you to death and while I understand you're new, you should understand that this isn't typically considered to be acceptable gameplay.  If your friend didn't escape it would have been reportable.
---
I know it just makes more sense
---
So much better than what I expected.
---
i agree with you completely on everything you've been saying. especially since legion can apply the effect freely the mend time before was insane. i just went against a legion and anytime we were out of deep wound she'd reapply it and if deep wound still took as long as it did to mend we wouldnt of been able to do anything. but regardless of if a survivor has to spend just 12 seconds mending, that's still 12 seconds they arent doing anything and people dont realize how much of a difference that can make
---
'whoever in office has a good voice for it"
---
Hehe...
---
&gt; Clearly you don’t play PS4 very often. I’ve been playing almost the full 3 years, I’ve been all ranks, it’s virtually the only game I play. 
---
Uh, no. I've been playing this same time and have been in all ranks
---
&gt; Yes there are more survivors than killer, I never said otherwise.
---
there was an implication in your comment that the survivor community is small because of camping 
---
&gt; Camping is EXTREMELY common on PS4.
---
it absolutely is not.
---
&gt; It isn’t a matter of pretending, it’s fact. 
---
take your own advice
---
&gt; There are SIGNIFICANTLY less players on PS4 than there used to be. The player base spiked in 2018 when the game went free to play on ps plus for the month. By the time Legion came out, a huge chunk of people left. The bugs that came with each DLC made it worse and worse over time. Many people simply gave up because of the issues and either gave up entirely or moved up to PC.
---
This is, at best misleading. I'm fully aware of the numbers you are referring to and there has always been a consistent rise and dip in accordance with content release without any notable outliers.
---
The community is large with few killer players.
---
&gt; It isn’t a matter of pretending, it’s fact.
---
Oh, sorry, my bad.
---
Well 1st you have to be the killer. 2nd people have to want to farm. You can farm with 2 survivors technically but if the others are just hittin it hard nothing you can do with the collapse now
---
Yeah some people downvote as a reflex.  Don't give it much thought.  It's just fake internet points anyways.
---
i still think sloppy is good on him, you're gonna have to down them with an m1 eventually anyway so they'll have sloppy even after they get unhooked until they full heal.
---
Oh I love new innocent players. Just in a blink of eye will everything they know be torn down piece by piece and all their joy and hapiness will vanish away
---
Michael on a Bichael!
---
Why would killer want yamaoko that map is like awful for killer lol
---
Ok dude. If you say so. Guess I’m just a liar.
---
This is what I've been trying, but it doesn't really change anything
---
Self Care &gt; Legion &gt; Nerf
---
Me @ siege when I get bullied by nea mains
---
i did not know that. TIL. Thanks !
---
What kinda build were you using and i mean face camping isnt bannable but its like the most dick move you can do
---
Maybe don't play at rank reset 😀👍
---
aww, I had a good laugh out of it tho.
---
stuff like this is why i remapped the pallet drop and vault button to something else, having RB or R1 being the button to vault, drop pallets, repair generators, and heal others has fucked me over so many times.
---
That’s understandable
---
Self Care &gt; anyone &gt; Dogshit
---
Dude you have a google machine in your hands
---
I always try and save. I don't care if I escape or not, u less people are just being dumb. I ha e come to realize that helping out as much as possible is the best way to go
---
*facepalm* I never said anything about survivors. I agree that pc survivors and console survivors are the same. But when you have console players going against a pc nurse or huntress then you’ll hear the console players bitch and petition to opt out of crossplay. Same thing happened with modern warfare. Once a console(not all obviously) player gets beat badly by a pc player then that’s what they’ll blame it on and saying that there’s no chance will ultimately want crossplay to stay between consoles only.
---
Thana is not that good.
---
I'm Red rank and the T1 Lunge increase add-on still throws me off. I'm like HOW TF DOES A T1 MYERS CATCH UP TO HIT ME REEEEEE
---
Yui trying to comprehend how Claudette just fucking dematerialized
---
Holy shit thus is good
---
Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, and Decisive Strike is the meta tryhard build.
---
Get rid of self care, learn to play without it and you’ll waste less time for your team and put more time into gens.
---
LMAO thank you so much for introducing me to that sub
---
if BL has to stay then swap lightweight for adrenaline, but you might be better off with dead hard in place of BL
---
Felt like it :P
---
no, im such a mess at this point
---
The annoying part is they didn't let everyone try the Beta
---
Hell yes!
---
Thanks for the answers guys, here’s what happened when the slugging began in my game. When I hooked a Kate, I saw a Meg trying to save the Feng that I hooked earlier, I put her in deep wound and she saved the Feng, I downed the Feng, chased the Meg and as soon as she goes down the Kate was saved, I go over there and it was pretty close by, I down the Kate and the Nea, (The one who got mad) was also injured so I chase her to down her, at this point everyone was down and no unbreakable, she then disconnects when she’s was about to get hooked.
---
Better be careful, their dad probably owns Bill Gates and runs the internet or something. Could be facing a lifetime ban or some nonsense like that.
---
I think you should be able to get away with just showing a face that's clearly moaning in pleasure.
---
That would be a cool chapter. Have Harambe as a killer to avenge his wrongful death and have the survivor be a zoologist.
---
Whoever voices the Archives stories needs to re-do those. They seem so unenthused.
---
Since no one’s given you an actual answer yet, if you unhook a survivor in the killer’s terror radius the next hit to the unhooked person applies deep wounds (same as The Legion’s power) instead of downing them.
---
Never gonna happen
---
Me and my friend were duo swf and we are both red rank. And the killers we got were rank 13-19 in 6 games or so back to back.
---
Probably. He’s the only one with actual dialogue everyone else just screams lol
---
Keep in mind too, Ghostface is on thin fucking ice right now. There's already been complaining and hints of people asking for nerfs, so we might lose the one solid character BHVR has added since... Spirit?
---
those damn barrel loops
---
BUBBA GANG! 
---
*Chainsaw squealing intensifies*
---
Next chapter title - Animal House
---
New killer - The Gorilla
---
New Survivor - Estev Iwren
---
New Map - The Gorilla Pit
---
"Got stabbed? Just keep walk it off 4head u'll be fine." -McCote
---
YES, THIS
---
Disconnects are ruining DBD
---
If you're caught in the open, yeah it sucks. But as I was saying before, you can be even greedier on most loops and be unpunishable for it.
---
Daylights when the server just decides to crash your ass out of the lobby
---
BHVR! We want our credit. Haha
---
And the question was answered, so why post this. It’s okay for people to have questions.
---
We should be devs
---
I've been doin Bitter Murmur + Tinkerer for a little bit now and it's been schnasty. Still though, even with Monitor it's becoming a struggle to get enough value out of his power to really make it worth it.
---
Your the Teammate That Everyone Deserves!
---
Aesthetically, Trapper and Billy are my favorite BHVR created killers
---
More like crush it!
---
Why are you calling her "Blendette"? 
---
Is it because she's brown?
---
Yeah I knew about the hatch, but I hadn’t heard about this...
---
Yes but the guy wasted so much time when he could’ve looked it up
---
People who do this are garbage
---
Sure sounds like you do.
---
It’s hard to find time in the day to sit in ques that don’t pop, mainly due to work! Hoping to get there soon though.
---
not funny legit baby yoda memes aren't funny
---
This year my birthday is on Friday the 13th
---
Yeah, I've come to expect it. And no, Self-Care isn't UTTER trash, especially for newer players saving points and getting hit more, but it's far from the best choice.
---
Fair on that clarification. There's been a lot of entitled survivors of late and this post does come off as such before clarification.
---
And bonus fairness for your edit that uses hours played as a metric to gauge skill level.
---
But the whole survivor queue time is really a creation of survivors. And almost every survivor complaint is just looking for a quick fix without regard to how the killer side of things will be affected by it. It's honestly sad to see how our community is one of the most entitled communities in online games.
---
That entitlement is the reason low-rank killers stopped playing. It's what created the long survivor queues, because killers just don't see it as worthwhile to play against that sort of toxic, entitled survivors. 
---
I won't even say every survivor is like that. It's a small percentage, to be sure... But unfortunately, when you face 4 survivors every game, even a 25% toxic survivor ratio is going to mean a toxic survivor every game -- Which ruins the game.
---
But hey, I'll admit I misunderstood and jumped to my point a bit quickly. Happy things are clearer.
---
While survivors do have a meta it's interesting to note that killers use BBQ + Ruin more than survivors use their top 3 meta perks combined. In addition, perk selection should in theory be more varied since different powers mean different perk synergy yet their meta is stronger than survivors'.
---
What tracking perk besides sfts could you recommend?
---
r/crappyoffbrands
---
I literally said I cleanse the totems I come across what even..
---
He's not a time traveller; He just plays F13 with friends.
---
This is great. Lol
---
At least with the new rank reset thing it'll be easier to maintain a rank for the newer players.
---
Aren't you contradicting yourself tho? You've said you never heard anybody say that. Dig a little more and we'll find people have been saying the same very recently at least about Hawkins
---
I'm not defending BL nerf, but in no way I believe you've never heard complaints about it especially after you admit yourself doing the same even when applied only to specific case
---
Or they hang out in their respective realms actually
---
Yes, the entire DbD community hates brown people don't you know
---
Good to know that trick
---
Holy fuck I thought my wraith was feeling weird. His speed curve feels ridiculous
---
r/StabbyGang UNITE!!!
---
Not a third chainsaw killer :(
---
I see it better than it might be, but in context if the survivors live, they just end up in another trial. They will never live to see daylight. There was never supposed to be daylight because they will inevitably die
---
That incarnation of Ash isn't from any of the Evil Dead *movies*, he's from the TV show Ash vs Evil Dead.
---
The more you know :)
---
as long as you remember the cardinal rule- never get in a locker when playing against huntress
---
I hope they add pennywise as a killer
---
Deceased after dawn.
---
Also reminds me I have some parody movies I need to watch.
---
Very generous of you, ty for giving some goodies to the community c:
---
i'll never understand why people can't get it through their thick skulls to lead the killer away from the victim. 
---
this is absolutely NOT camping, tunneling, or any of that other rubbish.
---
I run a generator build, so whenever I see NOED...
---

---
Pants are a bit weird in game though
---
Yikes...You sound so entitled.
---
 People like you make people like me not want to play as a killer anymore. Much of the whining and negativity on this subreddit is of survivor mains complaining about how the game should be adjusted to their desires constantly, not taking into consideration that everybody doesn't play survivor, and most people who play survivor aren't even good enough players to make such demands. 
---
If more survivors stopped doing toxic things, then more people would want to play as killer, thus the queue times being adjusted. 
---
...Nobody wants to wait five+ minutes for a match just for the survivors to DC as soon as you down them. I'd rather play something else.
---
Devs should just cut their losses and accept that mending was a terrible mechanic that nobody likes to play against and is really difficult to balance around. After that they should just fully rework Legion to either be able to camouflage as a survivor or be able to switch between them like literally everyone wanted them to in the first place.
---
It’s just a half arsed fix.
---
It's  far more likely that whatever they have planned as "event" releases on tuesday. I haven't seen his video, but tuesday the next christmas skins get released, tome 4 opens, and tuesday is usually the day we get new stuff anyway. Last year it was 17th december so it being 18 this year would make sense
---
Yeah, but if it doesn't apply on Feral Frenzy it's literally unplayable /s
---
Me?  I main the cat in the hat
---
Ah, it was a salty P3 Claudette. I got a hook on the corner of the shack and she sat right behind the pallet expecting me to fall for that. 
---
The hook killed themself as someone else ran up. Like... dude, I’m literally putting pressure on every gen by standing here waiting for your move.
---
It was Noed.  I finished last gen in killers face and then got slapped with NoED. Killer was laggy and this hook was the result
---
Don't get too excited for the event though! We won't get objective based events for a while, so it might just be double BP or indeed the christmas decorations if we get them
---
I mean yea.... kind of the point of perks and addons.make it easier.
---
You'll float too!!
---
Lmaoooo
