Hillbilly. Seems like marmite, you either like it or hate him.
---

---
Put me in the hate him camp. He's just a cheap pile of shit. He stands so far above most other killers in his potential that it's ridiculous and red ranks end up full of him.
---
Bsrely any punishment for a missed chainsaw, very easy to hit with. You just get an instadown as his main attack basically. Also god forbid you learn to pressure the map or control it when you can just zoom over from one side to the other with no cooldown.

Hag is easily my least favorite, I've tried playing with the hag and against her and she's easily the most boring killer I've ever faced and played as. When playing as someone like the trapper you have to use your brain and know where is a good place to trap and where isn't while trying to herd survivors to that spot, meanwhile the survivor has to watch they step and stay on their toes. But when playing the hag you just put them in obvious spaces and walk away. To put it simply, she doesn't require much effort, and it ends up being stale on both ends. 
---
Huh. I'll keep an eye out for it. Maybe I'll do some play tests on KYF with my friend to explore. 
---
Like if your super casual (&lt;100 hours) then I can see not buying DLCs but for the price of a coffee you can literally double your BPs if you main killer. Seems very silly to not get LF.
---
Oh yeah I hate that too. They always come back to the hook. If you run, you're fucked. If you crouch walk away, you're too slow to get away and thus you're fucked. Better hope the rescuer has we'll make it and hag isn't close enough to stop the heal.
---
When I use her I put traps down to slow the rescue down but normally continue the chase because I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of a hag thay wont allow unhooks. Especially in the basement.
---
Also only 5 traos under the hook? You must get the good hags. I get a solid 8 around the hook everytime...and then she never goes more than 12m away from the hook anyway.
---
Monitor and Abuse, Bloodhound, NOED/Play With Your Food, Nurse's Calling
---
If it was this way, all killers would just facecamp the last hook in case of Deliverance, and it would make the end game more unfun on the killer side. I never want them to change it. 
---
TOXICITY RUINS THE GAME FOR EVERYONE, BECAUSE WHICHEVER SIDE RECEIVES THE TOXICITY WILL GO INTO FULL TILT AND TAKE IT OUT ON WHOEVER IS IN THE NEXT GAME VIA TEABAGGING OR FACECAMLING OR WHATEVER.
---
REEEEEEEE.
---
Same here.
---
I've actually played with Cote before and he's in Canada. (i'm in UK). Solid connection.
---
Meanwhile anyone in eastern europe...or hell even western europe and it can lag like a motherfucker.
---
Clown and the Doctor. Doctor due to his bullshit shock ability, and Clown due to his fuckin potions. Can’t loop a clown, can’t hide from Doctor. Fuck both of them. 
---
(Also Legion, but hey. It has to be unpopular, right?)
---
No I’m saying it’s fucking ridiculous you can have almost a perfect game and still only get 1 
---
"The Killers have been tasked by The Entity to hunt down and sacrifice every Survivor before they can escape." 
---
So if a Killer tries to complete the objective put before him by the game, you will disconnect to spite "someone like that." Fantastic. I love gaming. 
---
How come survivors can bring all their hyper-meta shit while apparently killers cant do the same without being hit with disconnects
---
What, you get a killer and The perks? Do you mean that you instantly unlock The teachable perks? 
---
Bbq surveillance ruin and (sloppy/nurses/stridor/) dont use noed its a waste of a perk slot 
---
Yeah, I need to remind myself to have fun sometimes. You have to always be "on" as a killer, and I'm naturally competitive, so I will admit I do get worked up sometimes. 
---
Oh, me too. 
---
Very frustrating on both ends
---
Seriously it sucks when i use my best loadout and the survivors DC making me lose all my stuff
---
I haven't seen this yet! Can't believe his twitter account is "OG shape" lol
---
Early game if you down the guy off hook and go after the farmer it can help build some pressure (1 guy down, 1 guy getting chased, 1 guy going for the heap and one guy on a gen) but it’s also a really good thing to get someone on death hook or out of the game quickly depending on how fast gens are popping or if you just want to slow the game down. And sometimes you can even get the hook and get the chase anyway. 
---
I understand survivors being pissed at stuff like Frank's mix tape because it's annoying to deal with, but killers have to deal with similarly frustrating game mechanics too. Either both sides get to use their best equipment or none can. Anything in between is hypocritical.
---
Idk, its just a thought. I don't want a perk wasted like that just cause I survived last.
---
You'll learn someday :)
---
The problem with this behaviour you're doing is that it's too nice. And more importantly they don't know you're doing it to be nice. They just think you're trash. As a response to you being nice, they will teabag you and flashlight or window spam you.
---
As far as general improvements go, you're probably hooking too often. Remember that the time you waste bringing someone to a hook is time that three other survivors are on generators. If you instead go chase someone else, you've got one person on the floor, one person mid chase, and at least one person running to the downed person to heal them, which takes longer than an unhook animation. Sometimes leaving a survivor on the floor makes all 3 others try and save him, unlike hooked survivors, whom for some reason people have no sense of urgency to save.
---
Ultimately,anything that gives you a win is considered a "dirty crutch" and anything you do to make yourself lose makes you a "shit baby killer ez GG"
---
The amount of Russians who just start writing in Russian is so ridiculous, it's kinda funny. It seems like they are having whole conversation but there is no one to listen and respond. And they just keep writing.
---
be careful, the killer mains will cry if this happens. 
---
I disagree, but it would be interesting to see what tweaks could be made. I just haven't had enough experience with her. Just remove the heal whenever you cleanse, and then I think she'd be fine. 
---
Whoops, is there a way to repost to different sub?
---
Huh. 
---
That's a shit thing to do.
---
Go talk in Edgar’s chat 😡😡
---
I guess I will, whatever it is you're referring to. Pretty mysterious (now THAT'S horror).
---
Why would they dc?
---
Stakeout, Windows of Opertunity, Detective's Hunch, Coulrophobia, and Bamboozle have all been on the Shrine twice. Tenacity has also been on the Shrine 4 times, and Make Your Choice has been on the shrine 3 times.
---
In other words perks from DLC that was released 4 months (SAW Chapter) or even *9 months* (Curtain Call) after Leatherface have been on the Shrine more than Barbeque and Chili.  
---
Yes other perks in the SAW and Curtain Call chapters haven't been on the Shrine much (Pop Goes the Weasel, Boil Over, Surveillance, and Hangman's trick have been on the Shrine once, and Dance with Me has never been on the shrine) and other perks from the Leatherface paragraph have been on the Shrine more than BBQ (Franklin's been on 5 times, Knock Out 3 times) but the point still stands.
---
Even perks from *Shattered Bloodlines*, a DLC released **more than a year after Leatherface** ~~year and 4 days if I'm going to split hairs~~ have appeared on The Shrine before BBQ got a second chance to appear. Deliverance, Diversion, Rancor, and Spirit Fury have all been on the Shrine once.
---
The only other perk from a character that's as old or older than Leatherface which has only appeared on the Shrine only once is Left Behind, and Bill is free and Left Behind is shit. ~~Again if you want to split hairs Vigil has only appeared on the Shrine once and the NoES Chapter was released pretty soon after Leatherface, but Quentin is technically younger than Leatherface.~~
---
I see a lot of people in the comments complaining that Leatherface "is only $5 why don't you just buy him he goes on sale all the time?" but the problem isn't that Leatherface is "too expensive." The issue is that he's a very weak Killer and you're essentially buying a Killer booster pack when you purchase him. You buy him for his mandatory perks and that's it. It's a $5 purchase to actually gain Bloodpoints and to have a counter to items. (Will not talk about Franklin's too much though.) You are objectively worse off if you don't have Barbeque and Chili than if you do, as not only is it one of the best tracking perks in the game but it's also the best Bloodpoint farming perk for Killers.
---
The entire point of The Shrine of Secrets is to give players who don't want to or can't buy DLC a chance to get perks they would otherwise have to spend several hours grinding Iridescent Shards (or outright buying in the case of liscensed DLC) to get. So the fact that a top tier perk has essentially never been on the Shrine of Secrets is morally iffy to say the least. We could make arguments about BBQ's mandatory nature being a problem but that's another discussion entirely.
---
I had a friend who (until she was gifted it) outright refused to buy Leatherface due to "moral reasons." In her own words she hates everything Leatherface stands for and I agree with her. The idea that you can gate off items of high power level behind a paywall with no realistic alternative for free players is very morally iffy. The Shrine of Secrets is *supposed* to be that bridge between the whales and the free players so when it doesn't function that should cause a lot more uproar in the community than it currently does. It's a morally questionable slope that, if left unchecked can lead to a lot of very anti-consumer "EA-esque" mechanics in the near future.  
---
Put bluntly: what's to stop them from releasing "Vegie Sticks and Dip", a perk that reveals the Auras of Survivors regardless of range and gives you 200% more Bloodpoints, and then never put the perk on the Shrine ever while constantly bating free players with a fishing hook of "maybe the perk will appear on the Shrine someday but if you buy the DLC now you can get this awesome perk right now!" Am I saying that Behavior would make an intentionally OP perk and refuse to put it on the Shrine? Well no, but that's what it feels like with BBQ.
---
I perhaps don't have any moral ground to stand on because I'm one of Behavior's whales. I not only buy all the new chapters when they come out but often buy new cosmetics near instantly. It's part of the reason I don't feel as strongly about the Shrine of Secrets.  
---
But I still remember to back when I was a free to play player: Ruin was on the Shrine when I first got the game and one of my friends essentially forced me to grind up enough Shards to get it. I asked him if it was really worth it and he told me that I'd regret it if I didn't get Ruin now, and boy was he right.
---
I think that the Shrine of Secrets *existing* is great and that many other gaming companies wouldn't give an option like that, but I still say that the mechanic is really poor and could use updates to make it and the game as a whole more enjoyable for everyone.
---
We shouldn't be happy that we're being fed slop just because we're being fed in general. We're not pigs we can demand more.
---
It would just be another reason for survivors to bitch for killers doing their job. 
---
"Oh gee look, the last survivor is on the hook. Game is over. I'll just stand here to await their death so the game ends"
---
*WOW YOU STUPID FUCKING BABYKILLER FACE CAMP ME MUCH?! YOU'RE JUST SCARED I'LL GET AWAY WITH THE 4% OR THROUGH DELIVERANCE AND GET THE HATCH ON YOUR ASS AREN'T YOU! SO PATHETIC THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KILL IS BY CAMPING. LEAVE THE HOOK YOU MONGREL STOP PLAYING LIKE A BITCH!*
---
Furthermore, you're absolutely right about killers being more careful with their hook selections at the end of the game, and the points gained by either/both side(s) is little more than an attempt at weaseling another chance at surviving in there. 
---
You can play a game without being an asshole.
---
Now I know not everyone who does this is an asshole, but I still do what I do, out of principal
---
Because they are streamers. It is their calling to DC
---
Not giving Trapper a long meaty dick is a crime
---
I fucking love the amount of salt Legion can scour just from his mere presence. I don't even own him, and I think it's funny. 
---
1500 points means nothing. It's the end of the game, move on to the next one. 
---
Stop asking for freebies.
---
Really? Dear god. Why are they even trying to fix issues with the game if they’re just going to have to re-do it all again when dedicated servers come out lmao. 
---
It's just... Sometimes you can meet some real assholes on both sides, and it sorta sticks with you
---
After playing her a lot over the oast few days I have to agree. She's mid tier at best.
---
They buffed pretty much everything from the ptb, but that one movement speed decrease had a bigger impact than any of the buffs combined. And yeah some loops its impossible to hit survivors on with puke. Not to mention if they're at a loop and you can only get little hits in then you need to keep puking and puking and puking until you can get enough that they're broken. Or just do it the old fashioned way with M1 but then you might as well just use clown or hillbilly or whoever if you're going to do that. The drop to 110 combined with the slow charge means you'll never catch up either.
---
So what about Huntress I hear you ask? She slows down when charging too.
---
Yes I see this comparison a lot. Here's the big difference imo and its what holds the plague back - her projectile is slow.
---
With huntress there are times where she gets looped due to her slow speed but a well timed hatch shot can make it to the survivor. Meanwhile there is a significant enough delay between starting the vomit and having the vomit actually fly through the air and connect that it makes Plague far less useful at loops than Huntress.
---
For example if you're chasing them around a jungle gym and the survivor is running along the wall jist about to turn a corner then a well timed hatch can hit them. The purge projectile is just a little bit too slow on top of her slowdown to be useful. Its weird how it looks too, looks like they should be hitting from your point of view because the stream coming from her mouth masks the view of where and when the projectile lands.
---
If they just made her vomit a tiny bit faster it would make up for her slow speed I think.
---
As if right now though I consider her a lesser Huntress.
---
It's just as relevant. (Holy shit it feels like legion came out 2 weeks ago)
---
Depends on the intent more then anything really
---
Heads of cabbage skin for each survivor pls.
---
NOED is such a crutch. I hate when I don't get downed a single time during the match, and I die at the end because of 1 hit and nobody wants to save because the killer has it, but I can't blame them. Though I'd argue that maybe Wraith and Freddy still kinda need it, but definitely not Billy's and Nurses
---
I also feel like the buffs to tiers 1 and 2 for Ruin and NOED were completely unnecessary because they were already extremely overused to begin with. Same with BBQ, they could buff underused perks to make them more usable instead of buffing perks 99% of killers already use, it makes no sense to me. I like variety, but instead I get Ruin, BBQ, Nurses Calling, and NOED basically every game because they keep enabling these perks even more, it's annoying.
---
And finally, I feel like since the OP survivor crutch perk was nerfed, it's only fair that NOED gets the same treatment. Like maybe keep the one hit downs, but remove the speed boost because it's completely unnecessary. Catching up to a survivor already isn't that hard, especially since most of the pallets are gone by the end of the match. They could just replace the speed boost with a bloodpoint bonus or some shit, I don't know.
---
Yeah no, with the new DS you'd just get a free escape.
---
Well you can believe what you will but just because you believe something doesn’t make it true.  I only have played Killer for dailies.  My highest rank killer is a lvl 9 trapper, my rank is 20 as a killer where as I am right now a rank 12 survivor.
---
Yea I’m saying that this stupid ranking system needs to fixed because being 1,500 bp away from a perfect game. Also I never once said it is impossible to double I said it’s “basically impossible” which means it’s still possible. Also I don’t give a shit if you can double. I was ranting and you’re still stuck on it.
---
Eh I say let it it's a pretty bad perk now and if it works in these situations so be it
---
Sans?
---
Fungoose sat in like 1 hour+ queues, I felt so bad

WAIT TIME UNKNOWN + DCs EVERYOTHER GAME!!!

Why does being a steamer have your calling be to DC?
---
Surprise, NOED has never been fun to play against. Nothing more to it bud. 
---
It's hilarious,  all these people really hurt. Lmfao
---
Good old infinite black loading screen maybe
---
nah its time for region lock
---
tired of playing against people from Zimbabwe and being hit by laggy lunges
---
I bring gimmick builds as survivor so it's my fault if I die, i don't mind I just get a little annoyed when I face stuff like this but hey I'm no game dev so this stuff can't be broken right? Right?
---
Why is ds there?
---
Why is DS here its so ass now
---
There was an attempt made with this comment
---
Only things on that list that bother me are purple toolboxes and franks mixtape. Everything is not that hard to work around
---
Depends.
---
When you play solo and dont bring that its frustrating when the killer brings all their best shit. Feels unfair.
---
Likewise wanting a chill killer game and not bringing noed and only taking yellow add ons then getting a 4man swf with all their best shit can be frustrating too.
---
OP shit should face OO shit but since theres no heads up its normally only one side that brings it. If you bring yours though and the other side brings theirs then no side should be disconnecting.
---
Me: kicks gen
---
General Kenobi: Hello there
---
Surprise it’s a cake for your birthday
---
OMG not the jendenise circle jerk again. She deranks from rank1 to rank 6 and everyone loses their shit. 
---
1. Rank 6 is not baby killer category anymore, you can't just bully them.
---
2. She did not derank for a long time because of all the hate she got and you guys are still on about it.
---
3. She DCs mostly at the end when the match is fucking over. No one gets screwed except her rank(see point 1 and 2) and points.
---
4. There are reasons people disconnect, maybe just maybe if the number of DCs is high there is something to fix in the game. (YeAh ThE dC pUnIsHmEnT) no dummy, the rest of the stuff because DC is just a consequence. You can't just generalize that dbd players are crybabies, it's the huge number of people from the same group than any other online game. If it's so bad here that's a sign about the game being shit.
---
God the hive mind and mob mentality of this place.
---
That has nothing to do with what I’m talking about or about this thread
---
Respect pallets and survivors be like: Lol, baby killer
---
Don't respect pallets and get stunned and survivors be like: Lol, baby killer
---
Why did you uninstall in the first place? Just curious? Tired of the bugs/glitches, not feeling it anymore, need space?
---
You said no punishment and I said yes there is. You lose stuff.
---
yeah, makes her face look super wrinkly.
---
To be fair the most satisfying matches are when you get saved/save someone from getting camped by a NOED killer and they DC right when they get to the gate
---
who knows, but you're right
---
we'll probably end up with a game that's in the worst state it's ever been in because they tried to recode their entire project from the ground up in much less time, and considering that every update the game gets turns survivor footstep noises off or some shit
---
I downed them hooked them near the gate (which was open). They Kobe'd ran to the gate, I got them last second and they still escaped due to DS
---
Cause folks here are very attached to their weird echo chamber fantasy they've developed.
---
Me too. It’s a big reason why he’s my main killer, because he’s fun as shit to play. I guess the reason he and any low tier character in any game is fun to me is because I don’t expect to win so I can just mess around. Still, I wish he was better. 
---
Friday the 13th (if that's the title you're referring to) is no longer being updated, you won't see any new content so switching this for that is metaphorically (in my opinion) equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
You forgot instaheals and I know a few streamers survivor mains that are 100% like this. Some of them are really big and encourage this BHVR. They also use MLGA to block builds that they dislike. I wonder what will they do once dedicated servers arrive and they can longer dodge killers because of their builds.
---
Not long ago I was watching their stream for a few hours and every single match at least one of them was bringing a syringe, using it and laughing at the killers.
---
They finally went against a Huntress with Ebony Mori and Iridescent Head. Nonstop bitching right after he landed the first hatchet followed by immediate DCs. 
---
They were also using multiple DS (pre-rework). 
---
I've been noticing that even though killers main complain about a lot of stuff that is exaggerated, survivor mains are the most hypocritical players.  
---
When you say "don't ask how I know" we all know how you know 😋
---
And yes the bikini Jane is posted on that safe subreddit
---
thing is they could be your neighbor or from Zimbawbe; your neighbor could have horrible ping, the Zimbabwe dude might have good ping
---
Haha genius 
---
thats a unlucky situation :/
---
it unironically tilts me. thats why i NEVER willingly go on European servers in games
---
Clearly I was talking about the person who is DC-ing, not the people who stay in the game. 
---
And even if you consider the DC-er losing their item and/or points earned, they’re things that can be earned with a minute of gameplay
---
The only way to bring me back to this game is if they rework Freddy or give me bunny Feng. 
---
When I feel bad for a killer I allow them to me instead of my teammates.
---
Even though the same thing happens to survivors on this sub over and over 
---
JUST UNINSTALLED THE GAME BECAUSE I GOT ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED 7 MATCHES IN A ROW AS KILLER.
---
EVERYTHING BAD THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN ON KILLER HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND IT JUST BROKE ME.
---
It’s not. It’s so much easier to snowball as a killer than a survivor 
---
...Gotta say, I did not expect that. You win. 
---
Ugh it really does suck. I was playing spirit too and could only see the three closest gens, really sucked :(
---
I was for a while got to around rank 29. Just not my style and I’ve been playing with friends so been maining my survivors.
---
omg u damn reddit killerz!!!111
---
Dont forget leader. 
---
nobody would ever leave the last hooked person if that was the case.
---
Killers also keep track of who saved if they say you do it, people tend to make risky saves if they have deliverance and BT
---
Make Your Choice surprisingly hasn't been listed. Nurses, Corrupt Intervention, and Moniter &amp; Abuse, and of course Make Your Choice
---
But playing killer isn't fun, it's too eassssy. 
---
Welp shit, someone made a Huntress guide. That's it, pack it up guys. No more ever again.
---
It's literally in the title of your post -_-
---
But they could, you would just stand there, anything else would be a dumb move on your part.
---
 Not really the state of the game more like the state of the people who play the game, though this game is pretty buggy as is.
---
Up to date announcements get stickied at the top 
---
You guys aren't as helpless as you make it sound, and you don't need to rely on voice-comm crutches to even the playing field, either. If you need tips just ask, this place is a good resource for strategy and meta builds. Time to adapt. 
---
Happens to me way too often
---
I totally forgot to mention this. I believe this Myers follows a 4th(?) timeline in where instead of being captured/escaping/dying/whatever he succumbed to the Entity right after the events of the 1st movie which would have progressed into the 2018 version if not the Entity intervening. Basically this Nick Castle got scooped before he could star in the 2018 version so there is no Thorn cult. Btw if we did use that canon we could definitely confirm that Myers would win because of what happened in the Freddy vs. Jason movie.
---
The argument as I understand is that the killer is in a position of power over the other players, and they host the match, so they need to be focused more on providing a fun game for them and less on "trying hard" to win. That's never made any sense to me but that's legitimately their argument. 
---
Totally burned out. This last patch has been awful. I know rank doesn’t mean anything... but it’s downlow promoting toxic plays. Even my good games just aren’t fun anymore. I was Rank 1 pre patch. I’ve been sandbagged and tunneled to 12. On top of that, there’s a disconnect like every game. :/ 
---
And as much as I hated old DS... I think this nerf may have been a bad move. Lol.
---
Straight up not havin a good time bro. 
---
You are a bold one!
---
Myers would always win  :-p
---
:)
---
Well you shouldn’t have hooked near the exit gate. ALWAYS hook away from the gate so the survivors have to come to you and you get at least that extra confirmed kill.
---
Sigh. Here comes that broken perk.
---
Survivors do need buffs but this is not the way to do it.
---
You just made me realize I met way more gay guys on this game than any other place. Yes even IRL.
---
Can you blame them?? *tHeY wErEnT hAvInG fUn!!*
---
I feel like you have a little biased judging by your name but if this guy ain’t the bastard of a woman that had involvement with a cult, he wouldn’t win against LF, Doc, Trapper and like everyone else honestly.
---
They would've most likely still had an escape not hard to get from the middle of the map with a DS and DH
---
Got 4% chance of kobie, exit gate near by, hits DS and escapes. I think they earned surviving lol. 
---
Maybe next time hook them far the the gates or start running enduring if a extremely situational perk is irritating you so much.
---
Imagine killers still whining about this perk even after it’s been nerfed 6 feet in to the ground. 
---
No. The stats showed the survival rates were a little low months ago. Pretty much everyone is reporting that it's a bloodbath now.
---
Killer mains only consider it balanced when they get a 4k.
---
ok

\&gt;Something

\&gt;Somthing

\&gt;Something

Ok think about it logistically. If you're the last survivor left and you just were hooked, even in the slim chance you struggle off, what the hell are you going to do now? You're injured and the killer knows exactly where you are, they might not even have left the area. Depending on the situation the hatch might not even be open. I get that it can be infuriating to be on the last hook when you can hear the hatch nearby, but in the incredibly off chance that happens, getting off the hook still most likely isn't going to do much for you.
---
Lol.  I had a Claudette a few days ago on Azarov's, which is an easy 3-gen situation if you don't watch what you're doing as survivor.  She camped every single pallet on the killer shack half of the map, the rest of the team banged out 3-4 gens and was forced to come to that half of the map to do the last gen.  There literally wasn't a single pallet left on that half of the map where the last gens were.  She single handedly cost her team the match.
---
THERES NO NEED TO BE FUCKING RUDE IN THE AFTER GAME CHAT IF, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WON.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
IF I, OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER, WASN'T ABLE TO JUKE THE KILLER FOR VERY LONG OR DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET ANY KILLS AS KILLER BUT TRIED MY BEST - THEN THERE IS REALLY NO REASON TO CALL ME TRASH, BITCH, CUNT, UGLY OR SPAM EZ 20 TIMES IN THE CHAT.
---
“Not Hard” well that depends *almost* entirely from your ability to kill. 
---
Legion main. usually I go for the first hit and if there's any close enough I hit them as well and just chase that one. honestly not super concerned with getting kills as long as I get to chase and hook a few times. ngl I just had a game where I was looped like crazy and all the gens got done cause I ignored the discordance notifications. TIL never ignore those.
---
Actually playing the match with all 5 player?
---
r/dbdgonewild  is over that way➡️➡️
---
yes there's a better feeling, having sex.
---
Yep, barely 24hours after reverting it (for my GF and I for the better) they went back AGAIN and for the worse for my GF &amp; I :/
---
I hate facing the Hag. I know you can use her line of sight against her, but I just cant get that to work. Then theres the damned traps that are placed at random or teammates set off and I get hit 
---
Before anyone asks about the chat, there was what i felt a nasty case of survivor farming involved. 
---
The survival rates couldn't be anything other than 'low' when you were capable of ranking up consistently with less than a 50% escape rate. Which you very easily could. It's always been much harder to rank up as a killer with a less than 50% kill rate, I'd wager there isn't a single rank 1 killer who can get there by killing less than 2 survivors on average. This was a problem with their reward/matchmaking system, not necessarily a balance issue. 
---
earned a kobe? That's like saying you found 100$ on the ground. It's not hard to hit any skillchecks at all. And even with enduring and putting them in the middle of the map they still would've had enough time to run from the middle to the edge with DS and DH
---
She probably tried. 
---
lul
---
What are you gonna do if you Kobe anyway? Killers just stand in front of you until you die.
---
And give the killer more points ( equivalent of 3 full hooks on the survivor who dcs) 
---
I think that would make people who dc out of spite for the killer think twice, because then they’d actually be giving the killer a free 3 hooks on them 
---
&gt;Can you blame them?? tHeY wErEnT hAvInG fUn!!
---
Actually, I don't blame them. You shouldn't be forced something that isn't fun since this is a casual game. 
---
 Its the hypocrisy that gets me. 
---
I like how the survivor calls you a try hard for kicking his ass.
---
You're acting like it takes more than a minute to run across the whole ironworks of misery map
---
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO PRACTICE MY SKILL CHECKS BECAUSE I CAN'T HIT GREAT CHECKS TO SAVE MYSELF AND PEOPLE LAUGH AT ME FOR TAKING STAKEOUT TO COMPENSATE!
---
Why did you think I put emphasis on *almost?*
---
Can also confirm...
---
I went up against a 2 man SWF and 2 randoms and I downed the "distractor" of the group. It was a Nea with a flashlight... Obviously. She tried juking and failed, got downed almost instantly and left.
---
Then her friend left.
---
Leaving 2 randoms with 5 gens to do and me feeling like an ass when I eventually chase and hook them. I hate unfair games, but I also don't wanna take pity and farm. I just wanna play the game.
---
A streamer who DCs cause they suck and get downed ONCE... NOT EVEN HOOKED... Is a little bitch.
---
Haha I get that all the time on here lol biased and that I'm a killer main (I'm not).
---
Yeah he probably wouldn't be able to defeat the ones you mentioned but Myers would put up a hell of a fight.
---
His psychology (not sure if that's the correct term) makes it that he doesn't register pain the way a normal person would and that he would not stop until either he was dead or the person he's after.
---
"not all men" /s
---
Legion.. it's just edgy teenagers running around with knives
---
Uhhh Legion. The Clown. The Cannibal. Debateably The Shape.
---
Honestly I would welcome the Huntress choking me.
---
Also the Hillbilly, and kinda the Doctor. 
---
Hahahaha I just find it funny that there is this giant rash of DCing survivors sitting in their corners. 
---
If you wanna let your audience know you can't handle losing then by all means DC. 
---
What about Billy, leatherface, legion, trapper, piggy, and clown?
---
And the dumbass matchmaking and searching for a match bullshit crashing the damn fucking game half the fucking time. Shit.
---
Gimme bunny feng
---
Wrong I’m saying it’s “basically impossible” learn how to read and understand.... I’m not saying it’s absolutely impossible 
---
This. The matchmaking changes are an absolute joke.
---
I feel like I’ve noticed an increase of people killing themselves lately. When I play SWF with my friend who go for PIPs we always run into teammates who get hooked early and kill themselves fast. We also run into those team mates that like to try and unhook the other the moment they get on the hook which ends up wasting so much time and hooks. Another thing is the amount of killers that bring mori’s. It might just be chance but damn I’ve been moried a lot lately. All of those scenarios feel like they’ve amplified after the latest patch. I still have fun I guess
---
I wasn’t aware that they make balance changes around SWF. 
---
Please explain how BHVR balances around SWF.
---
Oh. So I wonder who the next killer will be if the Evil Dead content is only a paragraph? I'm hoping for a Hellraiser chapter. Give the people Pinhead! 
---
Are you on console? On PC he isn't that common from my perspective. 
---
Leatherface himself isn’t great: he’s kinda hard to use and has a considerable penalty if you play him poorly. That being said, BBQ &amp; Chill is absolutely worth the money. It’s a good perk based on the proc alone but the bonus blood points it generates makes grinding out levels dramatically easier. His other two perks are pretty decent as well. Not meta by any means but there are worse perks you can see in your web. 
---
New killer leak
---
It doesn't bother. The tv show involved all the same people behind the movies. Ash from show is the same exact character as Ash from the trilogy, only older and fatter. 
---
Billy has chainsaw Sprint, piggy has those annoying braces, clown throws those gas things at you. Legion has some kind of borrowed time ability. 
---
Tbh this horse still freaks me out more than any killer in the game 
---
OP is laying down facts.
---
One the one hand, I really liked the Canadian players. I will definitely miss them.
---
On the other hand, China.
---
Get this Loli lookin ass outta here
---
Wait, what'd he say? It's been deleted. Was it that bad?
---
We liked playing against you too.
---
Haha :D 
---
Blood party streamers. Gives you 2x more BP at the end of the game. And it stacks, so in this case you would get 5x more bp....
---
I didn't get to say, because it would enrage my fellow killer mains, but if I plan to let them go if they manage to kick flip off the hook. They would be the last one anyway. 
---
He’s not new player friendly. New survivors hate him cause his perma aura reading shuts down new player immersion tactics. He also doesn’t worry about capitalizing on survivor mistakes cause new players will run in a straight line and waste every pallet when they hear the Lullaby. 
---
A killer using Freddy has to actively work against the power cause without addons the survivor has a seven second head start to try to find safety. Or just stay on a gen/heal and hope to fail the skillscheck and restart the timer. In a vacuum, he’s like a worse Wraith cause you can’t interact with a person unless you do your seven second meme hell. 
---
Honestly Freddy isn’t broken bad. He’s just frustrating bad. It’s like all the time and effort you put into him to learn Dream Transition mind games, utilizing end game perks or even strange addon combos to make games take literally forever, it begs the question “why bother?” When you can put in about a third of the effort to learn a killer who can do everything Freddy can’t do and still collect 4K. 
---
Ikr? It's kinda funny
---
This post might've made sense a year ago but not now.
---
Alot of problems in this game would be fixed if they gave out more BP 
---
I don't know what that is bud. 
---
With the new locker buff, the ability to hide behind generators auras, and distortion, BBQ and chilli has gotten way worse. Sure you get blood points, but there are plenty of other blood point perks and offerings you can use. BBQ just isn't as good as it used to be and isn't a "must need perk" anymore.
---
Huntress is one of the most powerful killers on the game. And the hatchets match her back story. 
---
That is generated from a map add on. I forgot what the add on is called, but if you have a map with that add on, you can place that anywhere. :) It’s nice to show perhaps where the hatch is, or if you want people to group up for whatever reason.
---
Doc+BBQ+BPS=Bill Gates but with bloodpoints
---
Sloppy butcher, deerstalker, and bbq never worked as the pig never knew where we were after hooks or whilst downed. Sloppy butcher just never took affect, and noed killed me and my friend as we were opening the gates.
---
But what about the hatch
---
Guys i found the survivior main
---
Hm, if you say so. 
---
Some maps let players mark things like that so others can see. Good to use on the hatch and things. 
---
actually me
---
So nice to see an honest response in this sea of "ez pz" bullshit.
---
No. Doctors ability was created by the entity, it says it if you read over the power's description.
---
That's pretty cool. Do you get to use the marker as many times as you want?
---
So then it is supernatural. 
---
Probably a bug, although I still don’t he why they don’t let you use the perks you own when using a shard
---
Inaccurate, Leatherface should've been with Freddy.
---
Don't act like you didn't know.
---
Yes!
---
See my edit for the name of the add on. I think it’s a yellow one as well. As long as you have charges left on your map, you can place it as many times as you want. You can only have one beam active at a time, though. So if you already have a beam/marker and want to place one somewhere else, the active one will disappear. 
---
Its a bug. 
---
If you have the DLC with a fully equipped character and burn the offering with a different killer, the game will load with your current loadout (perks and add-ons).
---
She has the ability to break and hit you woth little counter play when caught in the open. Feels like leather face in that way. However what she has that lf doesn’t is good protection. She can puke on gens or get other people broken by proxy and makes people waste time. Then on the other hand people can full heal for free when sick. The ups and down. If they do this then you get stronger and become a better huntress. Mid tier is fine. Like who the fuck said every killer has to be S tier. Shes fun, shes balanced and these complaint threads suck ballz
---
I'm also a relatively new player, a killer main.  Sounds like you're doing it all right, to me, but some observations...
---
If you hook someone and then patrol the area nearby because you think you saw another survivor on a generator, or you've spotted some scratch marks, or you just think that there might be another player going in for the save—that's not camping, that's strategy.  Camping is standing right by the hook, obviously not doing anything but waiting to swat anyone who gets close.  Searching the area, by contrast, is how the game is played.
---
On attacking people you've hooked before, I like to consider that situational.  If I hook someone, and I don't think there's anyone else around, I usually move away from the hook to patrol generators.  If I get halfway to a generator without seeing another soul and then get the unhook notification, I'm gonna go right back there because that's the only lead I've got on survivor positions.  Once I get there, I try to analyze what's going on and react accordingly:
---
* If the survivors are good, they'll typically be *long* gone by the time I walk halfway back across the map to get there.  If that's the case, I try to pick up any trail I can find, usually scratch marks, and follow it.  Sometimes it leads me to the unhooker, which is great; but sometimes it leads me to the person who was unhooked, which is unfortunate, but that's just how the cards got dealt.  It's not tunneling because I'm not specifically targeting that person for elimination, they just had a spot of bad luck.
---
* Sometimes they'll try to hide nearby behind some terrain or something to do heals.  They're usually pretty easy to find when they do that, but since they're literally right there together, it becomes more difficult to precisely hit one or the other of them; so what I do is strike first and then proceed based on who the unlucky bastard was that I hit.  If I hit the person that was unhooked, chances are they're back down.  If that's the case, I usually leave them down on the ground and chase the unhooker.  I see this as a bit more fair for both sides.  I can chase the person who saved around for a while, which keeps the other guy off the back-to-back hook and gives the other teammates a chance to come in and heal em up.  More points for everyone all around.
---
* Every once in a while, though, you'll get a dude that, for whatever reason, has decided that since they were just unhooked, then there's some kind of mystical power that exempts them from normal gameplay.  You'll usually find this kind of dude self-caring right underneath the hook they were just rescued from.  I like to think I'm a pretty laid-back and chill player, but if I catch someone self-caring right under a hook, I'm gonna swat them right back down and hook them right back up.  If you want out that bad, hell, I'll oblige.
---
Try to think of it this way:  if you're not purposefully doing things to people to be mean to them, you're probably cool.  Play with that thought in mind, and I think your sacrifice ratio will improve.  Just because you just so happened to down the same dude twice doesn't mean you're being toxic—that's just the luck of the draw.  You win some, you lose some.
---
Like some others have said, the majority of the time that survivors wait around the exit, they're just waiting for that one last hit before they bail out.  I don't see anything meanspirited about that.  I do the same thing you do:  check out the maps once it's obvious that the remaining players are escaping.  I'm new, and don't know the maps very well, so those extra minutes at the end of the match are great for learning the lay of the land.  Sometimes they'll try and bait you into interaction to farm points, or they might just have too much emotional investment in a video game and feel the need to rub their escape in your nose.  Either way, here's a few things to look for:
---
* If the gates have been open and a person is hanging out there, look down at the HUD to get some clues as to what their deal is.  If there are players left that haven't escaped yet—especially if those players are injured—they may be waiting to try and get a bodyblock for their buddy to make sure they get out OK.  They're not being toxic in this case, they're just playing the game.
---
* If there are people left at the exit area, making all sorts of noise to try and bait you in, I've found that in all likelihood they're just trying to squeeze out a few more points from the match before leaving.  There are some people, though, that seem to feel like they have something they need to prove.  In either case, you can look around the map if you want, but there's one important thing to remember:  there's absolutely *no shame whatsoever* in chasing those people around and swatting them out of the gates regardless of whatever reasons they have for hanging around.  They might *think* there's shame in it, but there ain't, and I'll tell you why.
---
   * One, you're getting more points for chasing them around and hitting them, even if they do wind up getting away.  They're getting points, too.  They're really doing you, and themselves, a favor by squeezing out those last drops of bloodpoints before the match ends.
---
   * Two, it's *great* practice.  When the exit is open, survivors get *bold*.  They'll run around nearby geometry and try to loop and juke, because they're certain that that post-hit movement boost will carry them safely out the doors.  This is a *wonderful* opportunity as a killer to practice your movement and counterplay.  If they wanna run around a bit at the end, by all means oblige.  You might even get a hook out of it.
---
The most important part to keep in mind is that it's a game, and we're all supposed to be having fun.  Don't let yourself fall into the trap of being so concerned about winning and rankings that you forget the joy of having a good chase around the map.  I've played games where I've chased the same dude for three generators, and it was a hellova time—I loved every second of it.  Every time I get into a chase I get all giddy waiting to see what moves they've got, or what perks they've brought in to use on me.  Every game I play, I'm the biggest cheerleader for the survivors, man, I promise.  My wife probably thinks I'm an idiot, sitting here shouting at my screen "Ooh, balanced landing," "slick dead hard," "clutch DS," "oh, sprint burst for the win."  Every group gets a GG from me, regardless of how the match went, or what they're on about in the post-game.
---
Play the game in a way that's fun for you, and don't be mean to people.  Best advice for anything, really.
---
Ok, now I am looking at all the killers and here's the breakdown: 
---
Natural (Aka, humans): Trapper, Billy, Huntress, Legion, Clown, Pig, Cannibal, Doctor (as his shock powers are made via technology) 
---
Paranormal (ghosts): Wraith, Nurse, Spirit, Nightmare
---
Supernatural: Hag
---
Argueable: Shape (how much of the Meyers movies should be taken seriously. Either Natural or Supernatural). Plague (either a ghost, or a lich of some sort. So either Paranormal or Supernatural)
---
Then don’t pay for it and play without bbq. It’s like a 3 dollar dlc so there’s literally no excuse to complain, if you want it that bad just buy it 
---
T1 Meyers is different and nurse no 
---
People know that Clown is pretty OK.
---
It's just that he's kinda boring.
---
I’m baffled if the nurse’s lunge is as long as everyone else definitely feels 10x smaller 
---
So many trash topics today. Who said you have to p3 every survivor. Theres literally no point to it. Its a grind youve forced on yourself that doesnt exist. Literally no one gives a shit
---
If you have seriously only won 1 in 25 games as solo survivor recently you are not a good survivor. I'm sorry but that is the truth. Yes you will get bad teammates and sometimes have bad games but you do not lose that many matches without it being somewhat your fault.
---
I win the majority of my matches as survivor. By my anicdotal evidence survivor is still quite strong.
---
At the end of the day we balance around players who are actually good at the game, not "average" players. If you balanced around average players high rank play would be stupidly survivor sided and was for a long time. There were players saying the game was killer sided back when every pallet tile had 2 pallets instead of one. Obviously they were wrong as was shown with good players playing survivor. It was laughable to completely steamroll the killer with a good team and even non-swf who slammed gens crushed face.
---
I have 2k hours and have been playing since beta. I still won 90% of my killer games back when the maps had double the pallets because survivors simply suck ass at playing efficiently. They truly do. Nobody in their right mind would say that the game was "balanced" with old blood lodge yet I was still winning, does that mean that killer should not be buffed? No. It means survivor players need to actually get better at playing the game.
---
DbD is also a very snowbally game and the first 2 minutes often determines a matches outcome. If the killer gets an early hook and gets their snowball going it can be difficult to come back in solo queue due to no coordination on who is saving. Suddenly everyone is injured and gens aren't getting done then you all die.
---
Vice-versa, if the killer does not get an early down because somebody can actually run the killer with an entire map of pallets to work with it is incredibly likely that the killer will lose 2-3 gens before their first hook. Solo gen takes only 80 seconds and the map has MORE than enough tiles to work with for an 80 second stall.
---
What you should be asking is "how can we reduce the gap between solo play and SWF?" Give survivors the tools to work together more in game such as a totem counter, etc.
---
Meh, but killer toxicity has a wayyyyy bigger impact. All survivors can do if offend you by clicking lights and Tbagging, if a killer wants to he can pick someone and ruin their entire game, or everyone’s if they bring a mori with iri head or some shit
---
Yeah I spent like $30 on headphones a while back and they turned out amazing. They even have a blue light in them to match the one in my pc. I’m what most people refer to as a “sound whore”
---
Actually I'm a killer main, if you have time enough to track every comment I've said on this sub you will see this is the case. Being a killer main doesn't mean I have to be stupid lol
---
The left one really looks like a cute Tsuyu Asui costume.
---
For reference Tsuyu Asui is from My Hero Academia.
---
When I find the hatch and the killer is camping it scared I’m gonna escape I just sit back and do a close gen while he wastes his time lol after a gen gets done they usually start wondering further and further away from it, again out of fear I will escape, then I make my move and jump through. 
---
My favorite time I got the hatch I was using deadhard and Michael was camping the hatch. I ran straight toward him and he ran straight toward me like a game of chicken and I deadharded past him n jumped through the hatch. Lmao I got a message from him afterwards “not gonna lie, that got me” 
---
I didn’t respond tho I didn’t like how he played. Camped every survivor he hooked and they all died first hook so he can eat a dick. 
---
I don’t agree with the person in this thread that said slugging is the scummiest thing you can do. I use tenacity so I usually am able to find the hatch while downed when he kills the other survivor and I get out through the hatch almost 90% of the time this happens. 
---
Tfw all the survivor things are garbage except playing swf 
---
Can we not use the whole "main" argument to belittle someones opinion or act like you just win the internet just because they main the side you don't. It's genuine toxic behavior.
---
Slap on enduring and that’s a fat F to your decisive
---
It's better for some people, worse for others. The only way we're gonna get it good for everyone is if they keep trying to improve it.
---
Noed was the first on my list to go, but I've heard a lot of good and bad about surveillance, what makes it good or bad? 
---
I just don't support pay for advantages.  No matter how cheap.
---
So your strategy is "run around for as long as you can, but you're screwed no matter what on open maps" Especially since no one at rank 5-20 knows how to dodge projectiles.  Using her vomit doesn't really slow her down so you can't really stall by dodging since she will still catch up. "avoid as long as possible" is just saying "you'll get screwed eventually" which is not the case with killers that you can actually lose. If you get vomited on once, it is nearly guaranteed she will find you. This is not the case with any other killer.
---
LMAO.
---
Yeah I think I’ve used that thing like once or twice honestly. 😂
---
Well then I'm a biased killer main and I still think "soft patrolling" is camping. Which is not the same and hard as face camping but still disencourages save opportunities. Look man I'm not trying to be smart or anything, just thought it's funny when people say "soft patrol" just cause they don't want to admit they play bad and need to stay within 20m of the hook to kill people, but normally there's nothing good about staying near the hook. The game emblem system punishes you, smart survivors will gen rush you, you will be punished by things like borrowed time if you also tunnel. You just don't apply pressure by patrolling. It's killers that do this that encourage gen rushers to do what they do. I'm not saying you have to always 100% leave the hook, but unless you have a true reason like someone literally showing himself and looping you next to it, it's a scummy thing to do, and also boring. Just be a happy killer, run BBQ and go for that guy spamming M1 and you'll see what I'm talking about.
---
get out of rank 20
---
I play both sides equally. I abstain from bias. I use logic. Words mean what they mean. I don't go around reinventing what I think they should mean
---
Also, as a bonus fact: it’s nifty because the killer cannot see that beam. Only the survivors can. 
---
God, for someone playing from South East Asia region, i hope to dear God theres a server for us, but considering dbd isnt a gigantic company, i doubt we're getting it. Which means us SEA players are screwed
---
ty.
---
I think he deserved it because he was clearly singling you out when he should have had more pressing objectives. And then he camped you. So to me, the tea bagging would send the message "look how far that got you". 
---
As a killer, I only tunnel and camp if a particular survivor is trying to body block hooks or aggressively jump on hooks while I'm still like... right there. 
---
It feel good to when all the generators are finished and the killer's NOED doesnt activate, one time the killer straight up DCed when he realized we cleansed all totems. 
---
It's a Jesus light
---
Then you BBQ and you see no one, hmm. 3 people in a locker? You got me. I'm just a rank 10 nobody though. Im sure you're rank 1. Awaiting pics
---
I think the majority prefers classic over remake licensed content.
---
Unfortunately, companies are only ever going to license the most recent version because of marketing/promotion.
---
Exactly lmao 
---
sauce? my friend needs this for his science project 
---
Just picked her up the other day so only had 4 games with her so far, but I agree. She's really fun to play with, but pretty tricky since there are so many options when it comes to her power. 
---
Can't wait to get downvoted again for this like I do everytime this topic comes up. Its almost like the Devs have said on stream the reason they dont do double blood point events more often is they feel it would ruin the games economy and the entire point of BBQ besides the fact that its a monster of a perk to find people(or was I should say before all the nerfs) is that its literally a permanent doulbe blood points at max level. 
---
i think the point of this post is don’t be a turd, not matter how “toxic” another player might appear, just finish the game and have a good time! ITS A GAME AND A LEARNING EXPERIENCE
---
You can feel that they are deliberately preventing bbq from appearing on the shrine. I wouldnt mind leveling him up but I refuse to spend money on it.
---
If you’re a survivor and your best perks are Self Care, Sprint Burst, and post nerf D-Strike then yikes.......
---
I can assure you the totem spawns are **GREAT**. /s
---
Ranking system is even worse now with Wraith, if you want to max out brutality and deviousness points, chaser takes a massive hit and you'll get a silver at best if survivors can't loop you, and if you want to max out chaser, you get a shit amount of points. The probability of a survivor that runs the killer around for &gt;3 gens getting a pip is even worse than Wraith unless you manage to lose the killer and solo the remaining gens, open both gates, and cleanse a minimum of three totems.  
---
  
---
I'm honestly surprised how BHVR thought it was a good idea to make a ranking system that screws over high deviousness killers and arguably the most important survivors in the match along with making it so you have to go out of your way and extend the game for a pip.
---
Legend has it, if you stand in the light for 10 seconds, you become the killer...
---
Cypress may as well be a part of killers base kit due to how it works and ivory’s aren’t bad but I feel they should be bumped up to very rare and Ebony’s just removed. 
---
The amount of times I’ve been TK’d in COD is obscene, far beats anything I’ve experienced on DBD lol.
---
It is possible to play both Survivor and Killer and not have a "Main" - It is a rather accurate shitty survivor trope, but that does not mean he is a killer main.
---
YAH THEY BEEN FUCKING BAD TODAY ON PS4, BUT AT LEAST THEY ARE GETTING SENT TO THE BACK OF THE BUS WITH THE REST OF THE TRASH 18-20 PLAYERS ONLY THING IS I FEEL BAD FOR THE NEWBIES! 
---
Quit bitching. They reverted the revert so we at least get matches instead of waiting almost a full hour to get dodged by a killer because the old system they reverted to was garbage on console and then have to wait an hour for the same shit. You might not get fair matches with the new system but at least we get matches again. Campfire simulator isn't fun. 
---
Yaaay, a console player who posts actual accomplishment, not "I did 10% of achievements and got a platinum trophy"
---
Please keep reposting this video
---
This was never posted here
---
I'm not talking about team killed. I'm talking about being blocked off an escape and letting the killer get you. Team killing in CoD gets you kicked after 3 times, this does not. 
---
As a bill and cowboy jake main, how dare you. 
---
"recovers from exhaustion at a 50%"
---
So....15 seconds between Sprint burst?
---
LOL
---
I can see the arguement, I guess he's the grey area on whether or not you consider his ability to be natural where his heart is a generator, or if it's unnatural because it's the entities influence. But if that's the case, then all of them are on some level supernatural. 
---
wow, thats no where close to what he said man. Think of it like this. She will puke on you. Some will hit some wont right? Minimize the amount that does. She wants to break you then finish you with an m1. Delay the puke processs. Just by making it take 30 seconds+ to break you can make her 30 seconds behind a killer who cudda just m1ed you. Yes, you can get away, yes you can get downed. The chases are unique to every killer, plague being no exception. And tbh if you're in the open, their are way way better killers that will fuck you
---
Obviously, gee can’t you see the logic behind it? 
---
Lurker only there because popcorn drama everyday because some mod is trying to get himself off.   The mods there abuse their power harder than this subs mods on furry day.

I never said she was mid, I consider her low tier, around Trapper/Legion level. You can very easily counter her out in the open, do 360s and she will find it difficult to puke on you. Also dont get caught out in the open lmao.
---
You guys keep asking for a counter, it'll get monkey pawed. 
---
"Oh you want a counter. Ok....but Totems now respawn."
---
Only twice a week or so
---
Soft patrolling is wasting time until either the survivor dies, or gets pulled off, which the killer will just go for again. Aka camping lol
---
I mean considering how good you are with her you don't ever need to swing to down someone, and can get cross map or long distance hits. Incredible distance to injure survivors, more than any other killer. The trapper pales in comparison. Shape as well since she has an Insta down add on that lasts the whole trial by default when used. His traps are easy to dodge, he's not really anything special. Huntress is one of the strongest killers the game offers. 
---
They all are literally on some level of supernatural. The entity gave them strength and most of their powers.
---
I’ve been blocked in every cod atleast a few hundred of times, and on HC sure not Blackout. There’s an element of dickery in a lot of online games.. shit even world of tanks has it lol. Something to remember is if you can 360 a killer, you can 360 a teammate. I’ve had people try and block me and that’s my tactic. Pinning you in a corner or blocking a path for a pallet however.. sadly not much to do there besides report.
---
triggered? Sure bro. Im using all caps and exclamation marks and my language has broken down. My implication by belittling my rank and exposing yours is to point out how frivolous your argument is. You made a  bad meme with broken logic. You dont get to reinvent what you think it means. Idc if you were the best killer in the game. You're opinion(although seemingly informed?) is still just that. where as the established narrative of what the community considers as soft patroling differs from your opinion. I'll side with them
---
I've been playing 1 1/2 years and it's happened twice to me in this game. Add in about 5 other times where a teammate blatantly was trying to get me killed, in some matter. Overwatch doesn't have team kills, but if you've played ranked you probably have had someone try to throw a game. It's just part of online gaming. Just try to not let it upset you and move on. 🤗
---
Killer expresses opinion = downvote. What a lovely community, remember, different opinion means downvote!
---
How are Survivors more hypocritical tho? Killers will laugh while they use Frank's Mixtape, then DC at the sigt of someone using Dead Hard or DS pre-update, there is no hypocrisy that's not evened out by the other side, IDC how many downvotes this comment gets, unless someone comments and proves me wrong, I'm gonna believe I'm right and that killer mains are just mad that I'm saying they're stooped down to survivor's levels of hypocisy, but the same thing would happen if I called survivors out for being even with killers, maining both survivior and killer, you get an equal perspective on how things really are because you experience it from both sides. It's kind of a curse and a pleasure at the same time 😂
---
Hypocrisy on both sides yeah
---
Can't recall the name (Metal of Man?) but after you take 3 M1 hits you can ignore the next M1 hit that would down you, but your aura is seen by the Killer at all times after those 3 hits as well till you prevent that down.
---
It's a good looking perk. But it isn't much more than a one time use Dead Hard. Id say it is worse than Dead Hard really.
---
*Thank you*. It's like people don't understand how long it takes to eat through pallets or how precious few pallets there are that let you either mindgame or loop around them to get the hit after the drop. And no, no one *ever* talks about which side of the pallet you should be trying to force them around or which direction you should run in the loop. I've always wanted to make a long post about this with little chase tips like that (those, how long a loop needs to be to know whether the survivor will have enough time to get another loop if you disrespect the pallet, the difference between pallets that are *in* loops as opposed to those that a placed *on* them, how to press into a wall so you minimize your turn radius when making turns around a loop as surv, etc.) so that people can be smarter in chases and realize how fucking hard it is to catch someone who knows the tricks and doesn't fall for easy traps.
---
But yeah, guess if I just "hurr durr swing through every pallet and leave survivors that loop good", there won't be 3-4 gens that pop before the first chase is complete. Idk why I even go on this sub sometimes, it's like no one here has ever played against a decent, coordinated team before. You only win if they screw up or puprosely try to bm you/play risky, which many of them thankfully do since they know how strong their side is. Those kill:escape numbers the devs released are so, so jacked up.
---
lol I learned the hard way not everyone had the glitch on the same game. Was asking people post-game if they had the EXTRA T H I C C edition and they thought I was being a troll. Explained that I could barely play since my model was larger than the buildings - but somehow managed to escape because Legion was tunneling the obsession.
---
Exactly, keep the needs in, but buff a few other areas on both killer and survivor sides, picking sides on the buff/Nerf issue is going to result in noone getting what they want
---
"Opinion = bad"
---
-reddit
---
Lmaoooooooooooo aight buddy
---
None of the solo DLCs have had their own map, not to mention the maps we have been getting are literally just plopped into existing environments.
---
This is why I almost always run with Franklin’s Demise. 
---
I love snatching toys from survivors.
---
Unless a killer makes a mistake, they will eventually win a chase. This is true of *all* killers. Killers are faster and no matter what they will eventually catch up to you. So yes, my strategy is run around for as long as you can but you’re eventually screwed. That is the basics of survivor. If you are being chased your priority should be to make the chase go as absolutely long as possible to give your team space to get gens done. Getting downed eventually is not bad if it takes the killer 2 minutes to do it.
---
As a hybrid player who has moved up the ranks on both killer and survivor, I can confidently say that there are plenty of rank 20-5 survivors who can dodge projectiles. All it takes is a little forethought and looking over your shoulder every so often.
---
Vomit slows her down a bit, not much as you said but it’s enough. And it still has a projectile speed. The absolute best thing you can do when you think she’s going to vomit is run in a straight line away from her. The vomit does not travel fast enough or far enough to catch you if you run away straight. People get caught by it when they try to hide behind low walls, or zig zag it. If you run in a straight line while she’s barfing it gives you almost as much space as a good window vault.
---
Getting hit with any kind of killer projectile or ability significantly increases the chance of you losing the chase early. That is literally the point of the abilities. Every single killer ability is pretty deadly apart from like, wraith and Freddy’s.
---
Your goal as survivor is to use your perks and game knowledge to extend chases for as long as physically possible, or force a killer into a mistake to break the chase early and escape. But when you get into a chase, your thought should not be “how can I get away”. That is how you make mistakes and get downed early. Your thought should be “how can I make this go as long as possible”. When you start thinking like that, you will start seeing more success in your matches as you make more space for your team.
---
That's a good thing in my opinion. Survivors are a co-optional team of 4. Their power should come each other as well as their perks. So Survivor perks shouldn't be all THAT strong to start with or else the Killer wouldn't stand a chance as seen with original versions of DS, SB, and SC.
---
the perk you can only use once, and once used you basically give the killer permanent aura reading on you?
---
or do you mean one of those 2 perks that are only useful if the killer slugs?
---
I've been getting 5-7 minutes at the start of queuing nearly every single time, only to get inconsistent results in regards to connection.
---
They tested items extend outwards (backpacks, ice picks, pizza)
---
They tested bouncy things (tiddies)
---
They tested clothing that extends beyond the normal areas (tall head pieces, dresses) 
---
It should be close. Everything about it should work when they give it a go. 
---
I definitely feel like console, PlayStation at least, doesn't have a lot of the issues pc does. I think it's either harder to use exploits or things like the flashlight bomb than it is on pc. I've never experienced that or over half of the bugs I see online 
---
I don't think the entire game is being recoded for dedicated servers, they are going to have to change a lot to make it work with them but they have been using blueprints and want to change it to C++ in the engine which would practically be a revision of the entire project.
---
For mending? No. However it will affect them with healing normally after they’ve mended. As per mends, Legion has addons for that kinda thing if I remember correct.
---
But it's also sort of annoying to sit and wait for a bit while last survivor just sits there tapping the same button for a while. Doesn't really seem inviting for either Killer or Survivor, besides Deliverence like you said.
---
BBQ was always counterable. It's just now there's an actual "counter" as opposed to general gamesense being the counter. With that being said BBQ is still insanely good for those who don't have those counters ready and still provides a ton of Bloodpoints.
---
Pretty much this. Once the hatch is located a survivor has all of the power in the event you're trying to camp it. I've done it to a few killers myself and likewise it hasn't failed me because now they need to turn their brain back on and think about the possibility of me doing another gen.
---
Myers, Hag and Huntress annoys me the most. Myers because of his staring, Hag because of her jump scares and Huntress because of her projectile    
---
Least annoying for me is Clown or Trapper
---
So you going to do anything about that sir? You clearly seem to know this is a repost lol
---
PS4 DAILY TO GET AN ITEM AND ESCAPE, ALSO TO OPEN AN EXIT GATE AS FENG MIN. 
---
I JUST CANT GET IT. I EITHER KEEP DYING AND HAVE TO WAIT *AGES* FOR A NEW GAME OR THE KILLER DECIDES TO BE A MASSIVE PUSSY THE SECOND THE GATES ARE POWERED AND DC. 
---
I JUST WANT MY BLOODPOINTS I HAVE SO MANY CHARACTERS TO LEVEL
---
If 8 inches isn't considered long and meaty, then I'm gonna have to go and cry
---
I would say yes, for Myers especially, getting to EW2 asap is mega important tho again it's something of a judgement call. Generally with Myers I look for any moment that they'll be unable to break los and pallets can be good for that.
---
Well I just really wanted to incorporate a WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH reference into this... Ok like no. If I were the Entity I would disqualify him. He has to be an active part of a brawl or it’s a tournament style where he has to 1v1 someone. That’s just unfair. Wraith could just cloak and do the same thing. I was saying that as a misconception. In a truly fair fight we have to drop somethings like how in the Entity’s world they are all immortal. I just badly worded that sentence. What I meant to say was that these killers are all the age we see them and wounds on them do not effect the fight. So basically Myers wouldn’t win by default In a fight against Plague cause she rots. The killers lose their immortality but won’t die from arbitrary reasons like age or whatever. It doesn’t matter. Freddy (with Entity powers) could pull anyone asleep even if they couldn’t. Why would we make 2 people fight when they couldn’t lol? 
---
But ash vs evil dead isn't a remake, it's a sequel
---
Well it could be like Nurse. Nurse has an overwhelming pain when she blinks so why couldn’t the same thing or something similar happen to Spirit?
---
I see I’m going to have to explain this like you’re five. What they mean by that, is that inflated blood points leads to every game having purple or pink add-on abilities, which is what they don’t want. 
---
Isn't the difference in terms of the DbD character just modern present day Ash (old) vs classic Ash (young)?
---
I recently had an 8 game escape streak as survivor, the longest I've gone. I play around rank 10 - 12.
---
That said, I've also had some 3 and 4 k games as killer with level 1 killers that I normally don't play. I'm rank 12 - 14 as killer.
---
So as with anything YMMV, I guess.
---
&gt; If everyone else is dead and you have an unused Deliverance (meaning you weren't hooked ONCE while your whole team died)
---
Or your whole team simply abandons your ass and escapes safely. That happens to me quite often, wasting my Deliverance after having saved their ungrateful asses. 
---
Also, I juke well enough most times that Deliverance would likely allow me to escape. 
---
This is simply bad game design. I say that as someone that's been gaming since the beginnings of the 1980s.
---
Some people think it's funny to reinforce stereotypes like "claudettes do this" and "streamers do that." There's not really a reason to assume anyone who plays a certain character plays a certain way or a person who streams does a certain thing outside of people saying "every time I run into them this happens." 
---
So instead of a "all out brawl" its more "tournament of death"? 
---
Then wouldn't it come down to who goes against who tho? Either way, I like this idea!
---
LOOK UP SKILLCHECK SIMULATOR, IT'S A WONDERFUL THING. EVEN HAS HUNTRESS LULLABY, UNNERVING PRESENCE AND RUIN MODES TO PRACTICE WITH. ONLY HELPS FOR PC THOUGH
---
Dumb!
---
I've been playig both sides and have a few hundred hours on the game, and I'd honestly say that the game is pretty balanced, let me explain.
---
The killer was made to be a powerhouse, to be unstoppable, and the survivors... not so much... I like the points you made, but you forgot that since there are 4 survivors, they have to be unpowered enough that it should be near impossible for everyone to get out.
---
The gameplay is also reliant on luck and bugs, which really sucks, but Behavior isn't going to be fixig the game breaking bugs any time soon, so...
---
Also the factor that you need good teamates, which is harder to find tban my will to live.
---
Overall, the game itself is balanced, you just have shit luck, or maybe it is a lack of skill, or both together, idk, but the game alone with no bugs or anything and with people who have brains, it'd usually a fair match, unless you see a flaw in what I am sayingx then please, enlighten me.
---
Another dumb post.
---
I hate going against the Spirit, Wraith, and Freddy mostly.
---
I do poorly against killers I can't always see and keep track of.
---
Once Freddy sleeps me, he can track me, and in all my matches against him the player always comes running when I'm trying to wake up. It's annoying 😒
---
Spirit isn't so bad, but that phase walk (and her animations in general) fucks with me, and I'm bad at mind gaming.
---
The Wraith is annoying to me cause I won't notice him until he's in running distance. He still has to uncloaked, but I don't like my killers all in my personal space that much.
---
Spine Chill has helped me greatly against these killers but I still hate going against them.
---
D. Va!!!
---
r/prequelmemes
---
Love the idea of Scream being brought into the game, but there are too many good survivor possibilities from that franchise that I'd hate to see it just be a paragraph. 
---
I'm screaming at the top two.
---
Do they keep their dicks in the nightstand?
---
EXACT SAME FUCKING THING HAPPENED TO ME PLAGUE IS CANCER
---
You mean enduring?
---
Yep! Glass bead (yellow add on for map). If you begin reading the map and hit Space, it puts that beam down until you move it. I like to mark the generators I am doing in case I get chased off, I know where to go. Also shows other survivors where someone is.
---
Yup. The number of safe pallets far outnumber the 50/50 pallets. Opinions with this game are weird. My favorite survivor one is "don't waste god pallet", and I'll down 2 survivors in the shack without either using the pallet. Like....why?
---
Idk about using it on legion but it passively slows the game down extremely well.
---
ANGERYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
---
intentionally leaving my feng as level 1 so I can main her with every perk once this skin comes out.
---
I saw a post where someone put a medkit in the middle of the beam and someone found it and was like "Treasure!"
---
Oh
---
Because that would be #6, and because you can't do much of anything with it. The survivors can only make mistakes when you use it.
---
NOED is not #1. You can stop it from ever happening, you can cleanse it as it's lit, and not EVERY killer with NOED plays like cancer, so it isn't always as bad.
---
Dumb question how do you know the horses name? Is it from one of the clowns arddons? (Just got him awhile ago and haven't leveled him/
---
Ah yes, hurling insults. The sign that you’re definitely winning this argument. Did you even bother to look up the definition of economy or are you just so stuck in your ways that you’re just willfully ignorant? 
---
&gt; the wealth and resources of a country or region, especially in terms of the production and consumption of goods and services.
---
Sure sounds like they could easily be talking about the blood points as resources of the game and referring to the production being doubled is bad for them, but hey, go on spouting off out of your second asshole trying to sound smart. 
---
That's funny.
---
Once it matched a rank 1 killer against me, a rank 18 survivor and some other low levels so i walked up to him after he died, dropped a flashlight at his feet and he let me have hatch
---
No Jane?
---
i mean, the killer trades off a perk(noed) for 90% of the match to hope he gets a lucky kill in the end.
---
It doesn't matter if the money goes into hair removal for one of Mathieu's buttcheeks.  BBQ is a part of the DLC that provides an advantage that can't be gained except through paying more money for features that can be added to other characters in the base game, or through (poor) chance on the shrine.
---
You're arguing semantics.
---
BA DUM TSS
---
To be people still find Ruin annoying? I have been playing this game for so long to the point where I can easily just ignore ruin all together by hitting great skill checks. 
---
You can't profit from Unrelenting as you can these perks but it's definitely of the same mind-set. That's more of a "I'm learning the game" perk than anything. Whereas all these examples make it so you have to think far less, and by extension not play with as much on your mind were you to not have them. Unrelenting KINDA does that, but it's nowhere near as extreme.
---
solution: hide the chat and make your profile private.
---
CMV: Freddy has Big Dick Energy, but Little Dick Dick
---
Yeah I don't get that one either. It's not like you can't loop the window again if the pallet is gone. And if a pallet saves you from a hit at the last second it already gained maximum utility, regardless of what loops came before it. Everyone just parrots out the same stupid drivel, I don't understand why.
---
People are so dumb. Not you and me though! *God* we're so smart.
---
I love you too haha. I’ve been defending Legion pretty much ever since he dropped. I was on board with him ever since we saw an image of him, simply because I love his appearance, but when he actually ended up being fun, I was sold. People hating on him simply because asshats have a tendency to play him in a crappy way is silly to me. Even on their end, it’s rather dumb. You wanna tunnel? Okay, but there are killers in the game better suited for it. If people would just play him how he’s meant to be played, I think it makes for a fun game on both sides. People who act like mending is the worst thing ever brought to the game over exaggerate too in my opinion. 
---
I hate that you get mori'd after one hook ending your game prematurely 
---
I say it’s fine. That situation is so rare and takes two of their perk slots. It’s not even worth running those two. Except the rare time this happens half of those survivors perks are worthless most games.
---
SWF are worst since the matchmaking reversion. Solo qs are alright but my SWFs can take 30+ min just like old times. 
---
I probably could, but tbh survivors have been the ones taking the balance-beating lately, ESPECIALLY with Decisive Strike finally (rightfully) nerfed. So the list wouldn't be as potent. 
---
And before I get shit for this post, my issue wasn't with an obsession having Decisive Strike. You could dribble that at least, or slug. My problem was NON-OBSESSION Decisive Strike. THAT was horseshit. "But you can just drop them at 3-4 wiggles," yeah, and expend the precious time killers don't have to waste. Old Decisive made SWFs an ACTUAL serious problem, instead of just a minor one that people liked to bitch about as was usually the case. And what's more, anyone that ran Decisive whatsoever was an ass hole in my book, because you have no idea of knowing if you're gonna be the obsession or not. So you could easily be bringing in non-obsession DS, which was busted.
---
Maybe I was too triggered by the perk, but I had serious issues with it pre-nerf.
---
You're list is most Cancer killer perks.  How is Insidious camping not the most cancer thing they can do to you lol?  Come on dude.
---
Killers and Survivors are so divided and I think in the long run that hurts us all.
---
Survivors all want to 4-Escape and complain when they don’t.
---
Killers want to 4-Kill and complain when they can’t.
---
The problem is that since there’s such a divide, the community doesn’t listen to each other. From my experience in these forums, any complaint/suggestion will be downvoted and met with snarky comments from the opposite side. It happens ALL the time. 
---
I play a solid *50/50* of both Killer and Survivor, and I play both at least once or twice per day if not at all. And honestly I feel like Killers have the shittiest end of the stick. Killers get singled out, harassed, Doxxed, suicidal encouragement and just the nastiest shit from Toxic Survivors. This is hilarious to me because the same people will complain about Lobby times/Killers dodging lobbies. 
---
Honestly playing as Killer is stressful as hell. Dealing with teabagging/rotten people commenting and messaging you for just playing the game normally is insane. Even when I try my best to be a “fair” Killer, I will always get some Survivor taking something I did way out of proportion and insult me. *”LMAO BABY KILLER CAMPED ME AT THE EXIT GATE REPORTED”* ...yeah, I had to or else you would have escaped free.
---
Just be nice to eachother. That’s it.
---
David main here. 
---
Yeah, basically 
---
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
---
Putting it in the shrine would end up with less people buying Cannibal, sadly. I wonder if they're planning a rework to see if that boosts the sales of his DLC. 
---
looks right to me 
---
You need to take a break from reddit holy fuck lmao 
---
The worst is when they REFUSE to leave the Exit Gates without seeing you and teabagging.
---
I knew some Survivors escaped so I proc’d my Insidious and sat in a corner and went out for a smoke.
---
Come back 15 minutes later. I’m still in the same game and the 2 haven’t left yet, I just see Loud Notifications from them in the corner of my screen. So I walk my way over there and suprise suprise. They’re all teabagging me and gesturing.
---
I just don’t get it. This game fuels some people’s sad lives and they just take it out on other people.
---
So I see not only are you dumber than dog shit, you also can't read:
---
&gt;the wealth and resources of a __country or region__, especially in terms of the production and consumption of goods and services.
---
That's in your own definition, which is still a short-hand definition. The reason it includes country or region is because _there needs to be different agents interacting for there to be an economy_. In this case, the people who produce the goods (bloodpoints) are still the ones consuming the bloodpoints (consumption). Either way, there's zero interaction. 
---
This has happened to me and I felt great about it.
---
The only problem is this encourages greedy survivors to let other survivors die on first or second hook to get that last man standing bonus. 
---
I CAN'T EVEN FIND MY FUCKING TOTEM ON MOUNT ORMOND. WHAT THE FUCK !!!
---
Prolly cuz people would complain incessantly wnyway
---
Hi welcome to the *Dead By Daylight Reddit.* 
---
We don’t have normal cold-blooded discussions here for some reason. Everything is hostile and angry for whatever reason.
---
The Spirit and the Legion got new maps.
---
Not enough red rank survivors?
---
[CONFIRMATION BIAS, BITCHES !!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Biased_memory)
---
I hate the hatch standoff. As survivor I’ll do things to force the killer off the gen if he’s sitting there and won’t give it to me. As killer I’ll hit them and let them leave after like 10-15 seconds
---
No not at all... but yea, kinda :p
---
Hillbilly and legion
---
Hillbilly cause it seems to be the only killer people play (ps4) ran into 16 of them today out of 22 games
---
Legion because he's just not fun to play against even when I use him I don't have fun I can tell the survivor aren't having fun I swapped from him to Freddy and haven't looked back.
---
First off most killers move faster then you he's no exception+his ability is running. His ability literally allows you to vault obstacles design to create distance from the killer.
---
Mind games? Nope GG his ability legit tells were the other survivor are.
---
I get you can 360 him pretty easy but with shit hit boxes and most legions having shit connection just no to that.
---
In my time playing legion the only character to ever 360 me was a Kate in a jungle gym and a Claudette just by crouching
---
I loved joining a red Ping Lobby and all the players names are **[][][][][][][]**
---
A simple strategy, avoid being caught in the middle of no where and make sure you’re near a wall or some sort of cover. Running in circles around a tree is very effective to dodge the vomit(works 8/10 times).
---
It should be 1.5-2 Gens if it is at the start of the game.  3 Survivors to do 4 gens is still very, very much in favor of the Killer
---
Give them a real power instead of a status effect? lol 
---
Because. They. Throw. The. Match. Unless. You. Are. Stupid. Enough. To. Let. Them. Profit.
---
And that's after however long they took to down the first person in the first place.
---
Okay.
---
Is Ace really quiet? Does he really have a built in Iron will?
---
That would be why I made sure to state the perks aren't over-powered or anything, and that one in particular is actually pretty dumb from a profit standpoint.
---
So instead of trying you burden your teammates by DC’ing?
---
I'm just saying it's not annoying if you have been playing for long enough. 
---
Bring me bunny Feng!
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a95zj3/state_of_this_sub/
---
DC was unrelated, the pallets were fucked for the 50th time, that was just icing on the cake. I refuse to give a hook to the killer when the pallet straight-up doesn't drop.
---
Legion btw
---
It used to be like this but people just sat there the whole 2 minutes wasting everyone's time.
---
This is literally all I'm saying. If all 4 players are good, you lose unless nurse. Of course I screw up/get outplayed sometimes.
---
And they lose all the time. Usually they're playing stream snipers who mess around and don't play well though. Or they'll only put up highlights of when they get 3/4k, like tru3
---
Or because you know, bbq won’t show survivors who are on gens 
---
Great artwork as always!
---
Deliverance into decisive strike 
---
Who the fuck cares if it’s legion
---
Nice
---
Had a legion hold my team hostage in the basement for 30 mins earlier. He’d already moried two of us and two were left. The exit gate was open and right next to basement and he knew they’d get out so just stayed there. Nobody had done anything toxic to him, remotely. All of us added one another during the hostage situation and he was telling one guy that he wouldn’t let them leave because they pallet looped him(?!?). Toxic killers are definitely numerous and as someone who plays both I think toxic killers have the ability to actually ruin the game.
---
If first stage: unhook attempts must be made in the first 10 seconds.
---
If second: immediate death, 100% of struggle points awarded.
---
It doesn't need to be hard, torturous, or convoluted. Just fair. Right now, it is not fair.

BALANCE LANDING IF A REALLY GOOD PERK BECAUSE OF THE BONUS 75% LESS STAGGER DURATION BUT THERE ARE SOME MAPS THAT HARDLY HAVE HIGH DROP OFF POINTS TO EVEN USE IT, SO ITS A RISKY PERK TO USE BUT LITHE IS REALLY POINTLESS UNLESS YOU CAN FOR SURE LOSE THE KILLER ONCE U FAST VAULT AWAY.
---
Again, no, it isn't. Because the extent of which you can apply its toxic applications are limited. You are literally stationary, not even playing the match. It is toxic, absolutely. But you cannot perpetuate any toxic behavior besides what the survivors LET you. It's far more in the survivors' hands than the killer's. And that's why it isn't as toxic as some of these other perks.
---
It sounds like you just don't grasp the limitations of Insidious vs. these other options, if we're gonna give opinions here.
---
Oh get off it, it’s fucking 4%. Like how can other killers play this game and be so powerful and get so pissy over some RNG of the other side having fun.  Guess we should remove chests and map tiles, ace perks, have people queue into killers they want so no ones ever surprised. Survivors are weak in their own and rely on teamwork and luck. I can’t see why people want to remove this.
---
BHVR has an outfits tab just let that be selective of a larger outfit that encompasses several areas. Meaning you get the entire outfit or none of it. The outfit will take the head+torso area.
---
Not at all the game was going fine he just all of a sudden D/C maybe he lagged out but it just sucks tho like that was 80k blood points lol
---
I said the perks' necessity is annoying, not the perk itself.
---
Just hearing the words "vacuum pallets" gives me traumatic flashbacks
---
I always teabag to say thank you in those kinda situations and assume the killer gets it. None of my friends nor I knew teavagging was toxic till we came to Reddit, we always did it to be friendly lol 
---
Right? Dude takes the perks and gets the planets aligned so it works out for a win? And this mans is so sweaty there’s a reddit post about it.
---
Bubba to Nea: Mom said it's my turn with the flashlight
---
It's because PS4 users are pure
---
DO IT ALREADY DEVS WHAT THE HELL CMON ITS 2019 AND SHIT
---
Remove legion but unironically
---
The jacket could have one of those zip on/off hoods. So just the chest=hood is off. chest+head=hood is zipped on
---
k
---
You don't like to play the game ?
---
They're talking about Leatherface and Bill, the only "paragraphs" instead of chapters (so far).  Pretty sure that's what they meant by "solo DLC".
---
Again I got to say man you just seem extremely inconsistent in your application of logic in regards to what you specify the list as.  You keep qualifying this as how effective it is but that isn't what your lists title or description says this is supposed to be.  The person on the hook that got downed a single time doesn't get to decide anything lol.  They're stuck there with a silent killer stairing at them, it's their teamates that decide if insidious will be effective.  It's incredibly cancerous I think you would be soundly outvoted there.  But hey it's your list so do whatever you want with it.  Just thought I'd chime in.  I'll leave you to it then.
---
Its about time survivors get more perks that use the endurance affect. Honestly if they're running out of perk ideas just start making more status affect perks for both sides.
---
Okay. Managing gens as killer is a realistic joke right? I've seen a video of three generators popping at the exact same time. I've seen a gen go in my games within 30 seconds. Noed is a crutch to be fair, it only really helps secure an extra kill or two and can be cleansed. To be fair I hate running into it, but I know why it's there. Bamboozle is whatever, only blocks one window, for 15 seconds, good survivors don't even acknowledge that perk when it happens, I've seen people completely out play that perk.
---
But will he have his horse though. That's the real question.
---
&gt;It still doesn’t change my point that we are never going to get classic licensed content.
---
What's Leatherface?  Michael and Laurie?
---
Freddy is literally the only example of remake we have.
---
Frontier Communications is my mortal enemy
---
Drops dozens of times a day
---
1.1 star rating online
---
Owns a monopoly of the area. I miss Comcast.
---
Thats unfortunate. I hope the devs stand their ground for once. The survivors need new good perks.
---
A paragraph is a DLC, just not a chapter.
---
UGGHHHH I NEED IT NOWWWWWWWWWW
---
Calling it now. It'll be one of the cosmetics released close to Easter. 
---
Thank you for reading and commenting. I'm honestly trying to respond without getting worked up, but I don't think your comment involved much thought. As I said, I've been playing DbD for almost two years. The devs have not previously introduced a killer that induces any human response other than surprise or fear. It's a natural human response to get sick when other people get sick. Evolutionarily, if an ape ate something poisonous and started vomiting, the other apes around who might have eaten the same thing would want it expelled from its stomach as well. This reaction has lingered in our evolution, where humans react this way. If you don't have it, I am jealous of you. As for the movie comment, I've never seen a horror film based on vomit. Not saying it doesn't exist, but I have not seen it. And I can easily avoid it by not watching it. I don't think my options should be limted to DC'ing every time I get a Purge game, or quit playing a game I love because all of a sudden the devs introduced a killer that induces a natural human reaction of vomit.
---
Both chapters and Paragraphs are a DLC. I never said it wasn’t a DLC I just said it should be coming soon.
---
eh, i guess.
---
Killer has no cancerous perks. 
---
Oh my god.... I feel like a complete asshole. I went thru a phase early on as killer depiping to stop survive with friends depipers from stomping noob killers, I used to farm with low ranks teams and give them tips to get better afterwards, to stay low I'd DC at the very end. I hope they never lost their points.
---
That 7 seconds is a short amount of time though. If you want to risk staying on a gen for a skill check you risk being picked up. You can run to safety but if im freddy i just follow them and as soon as a hits available i hit. he wastes time getting hits and if the gens get done and he doesnt have anyone sleeping or blood warden everyone can run right through him. i think the endgame needs a buff on freddy but besides that he is mostly solid. I can see him not being friendly for new players but thats every killer. Freddy even more so if they don't know how the dream world works. 
---
Ruin annoying?, 80% of the time its gone within the first 2-3 minutes if not less, shouldnt be that hard hitting great skill checks either..
---
Your math is off.. 2×5=10 unless I'm missing something on how high the cap is
---
I can tell you that this is false. speaking from experience.
---
Never said it was hard to deal with.
---
Nope. Because I'm already fully aware.
---
You just sound like another complaint. Another “please fix this” when there’s nothing wrong. Again, if you cant handle a sound leave the game and try to find another killer. 
---
Trapper main, can confirm👅💦
---
Leatherface does take money, since he’s a licensed DLC. He, Freddy, Myers and Pig, along with Laurie, Quentin and Detective Tapp, cannot be bought with shards.
---
Better luck on your next topic, then.
---
male characters still stick out a bit, especially if the angle they're being hooked at forces you to hide behind the skinnier side of the gen.
---
honestly BBQ is only really oppressive vs Billy and Nurse because you can't get far enough away from where they saw your aura by the time they get to you.
---
buuut moooom!
---
Yeah, I can confirm that Doc's power gets hard countered by holding W.
---
not surprised the people of this subreddit are telling you to quit the game simply for having a normal human reaction to something disgusting
---
I'm going on Friday, so hype now!
---
i play in a 3 man swf and we take heavy advantage of little gen pressure and get those shits done, and a good 60% of killers dc when they realize we got all the totems and their crutch perka is useless and they didnt get more than 2 hooks the entire game
---
If he does manage to hit a survivor, it's an instant mori.
---
Aaaaand I’m dead XD
---
Yeah possibly I haven’t had any lag spikes at all on PS4 yet tho 
---
thank you.
---
Thank you for commenting. I know it sounds stupid, but it means a lot. 
---
Wraith skin, honestly.
---
I accomplished what I wanted to so my luck was just fine this go around, not sure why you'd think otherwise.
---
Wow. You must be pretty desperate if you miss Comcast. 
---
It's usually just a disconnect from the server, it's not my ps4 going offline or my net cutting out because my spotify will still be working dunno though
---
I understand it's ridiculous that BBQ has been on the shrine once, but Leatherface is worth buying. Even if you don't play him, all 3 of his perks are awesome. I use BBQ and Franklin's all the time. Knockout is amazing for slugging builds as well. Additionally, the meme builds with LF are amazing.
---
You’re fuckin telling me. It’s bad. Extremely bad.
---
The better feeling is being the killer and having used a Black Ward instead of Streamers.
---
Yes, we cleared this up it was a typo.
---
Nice to see you let an innocent conversation get personal to you and use it to both assume and insult the intelligence of myself.  Class act man.  Well that's a wrap for me.  Enjoy writing poorly described lists that don't adhere to their onset description and needlessly insulting people over nothing.  
---
BROOOOOO IT JUST HAPPENED AGAIN
---
The only good perk in this DLC is mettle of man. The aura reading of slugged survivors is honestly dumb to run over Bond or even Empathy. Flip Flop seems dumb too. If you recover to 95% then why didnt someone just tap you and pick you up, anything less than 99 is barely going to get you wiggle progress.
---
Mettle of Man is so good against Spirit, Nurse and Hag (and all basic M1ers). But almost completely useless against Huntress, Billy, Legion, Trapper (kinda), and Plague. 
---
KILLER IS SO EASY AND IS ONLY HARD WHEN GOING AGAINST GROUPS OF FRIENDS!!!
---
it's more of a 100% + 100% + … then 100% \* 2.
---
I STOPPED PLAYING BECAUSE I KIND OF HATE PLAYING AGAINST THE PLAGUE. GETTING PUKED ON OVER AND OVER AGAIN, EVEN OVER PALLETS AND SHORT WALLS  IS WORSE THAN PLAYING AGAINST LEGION.
---
Holy shit I can smell the Cheetos from here
---
You suffered? Okay, the devs don't suffer? Jesus do you sound whiny and entitled. The devs work their asses off to make the game and this is what they get,  you insulting them, saying you know suffering more than they do. Playing dead by daylight is just sooo much easier than making it(/s). It's not as simple as just pressing a "fix the game" button.
---
The devs have to juggle making new perks, powers, fixing old perks , working on current large issues, which puts delays on everything else. It seems like they have many more issues than you not liking the game. 
---
Sorry you can't find matches, it sucks, but I'd really love for you to go over to the office up in canada and just fix all the problems with dead by daylight, please, do it.
---
Not to mention I'm fairly sure Mccote plays the game and even streams it, along with a few other devs, can't confirm.
---
then how about we make Myers have collision when he stalks? that would be fun. 
---
So players are suppose to just not use their good addons that they spent the BP to get? That’s asinine 
---
Yeah, I would definitely rather play with East Coast and Central America rather than Russians and Middle Eastern players (which, the latter aren't an issue on PC, but I know from my console days how horrible it is to play against them). Just keep people with shit ping together and let everyone else connect regardless of where they're from as long as it doesn't pass a certain threshold.
---
I've been waiting for this ever since they revealed it in their livestream. SUMMON DA BUNNY
---
&gt; but I'd really love for you to go over to the office up in canada and just fix all the problems with dead by daylight, please, do it.
---
Yea, thats very easy. I'd just put a giant "For Sale" sign up on the front lawn.... I mean, they still work out of a garage right? 
---
That's kinda always been true, but it's still way less impactful than it was before
---
I hate facing a lot of killers because console is weird. I hate facing doctor the most because 50% of the time you get zapped and lose half of your frames
---
People actually watch them waiting for a match? Then Getting DC'd? 
---
I think it would just be weird because you might have people who use the hood without the lower half of the hoodie. The only reason it works with the Legion is because his head is technically also part of his body cosmetic, including the hood. The head cosmetic is actually just the mask. That's why you can be different people but keep the same mask.
---
For me it would probably be The Hag. I hate not being able to move around freely and I don't usually run Urban Evasion in my builds so it's usually a pain to move around lol.
---
Ehhh personally not a fan of stridor, but for me, honestly I'm fine with the setup I have. It's just on the really dark maps I have this issue. And I eventually hook em'. It's as if my brain refuses to process theres an object in front of me and my aim gets super spastic.
---
If you're casually spending $5 for coffee, then you have more disposable income than a lot of people, even in first-world countries. That's ~$100 a month for something most people get from work for free.
---
Longer than that.
---
Its a pretty good job. 
---
Thought it was 1-&gt;10 10-&gt;15 then 15-&gt;20 and even if you do reset back to 17 you can depip to 20 at that point..
---
Who is that Smeagol looking fuck at the far end of the potato section?  He doesn’t even look anything like a survivor!  Is this some kind of joke I’m not familiar with?
---
&gt; "soft patrolling" is camping
---
It is, but so what?
---
&gt; still disencourages save opportunities
---
I say again, so what?
---
&gt; just cause they don't want to admit they play bad and need to stay within 20m of the hook to kill people
---
This isn't entirely true. There are people who aren't all that confident or good and they stay on the hook, there are others who stay there simply to secure the kill, and there are those who see survivors crowding the hook and don't take the easy bait. "Reasons" for camping are pretty lengthy, but you're playing the game, you don't owe anybody an explanation for it, and moralizing it is just stupid.
---
&gt; The game emblem system punishes you, smart survivors will gen rush you
---
Yes. It's the trade-off for doing what you're doing. I think they know it, and accept it.
---
&gt; you will be punished by things like borrowed time if you also tunnel
---
There's the other buzzword people love, tunneling. I don't know why people get so butthurt over being targeted after being saved. You're supposed to kill. It may not be most efficient for you as a killer depending on the circumstances, but guess what, it's *your* choice to make; no one else's.
---
&gt; It's killers that do this that encourage gen rushers to do what they do
---
Gen rushing only exists because it's the only objective, and generators go up very fast. Just the same as I don't think killers should have to justify why they do their job, survivors shouldn't have to justify why they do theirs.
---
&gt; it's a scummy thing to do, and also boring
---
Subjectively, to you, and others who think like you. There's nothing *inherently* wrong with it. It's just this lame honor rule people try enforcing that results in flaming and shaming if you don't adhere to it.
---
&gt; Just be a happy killer
---
What does this even mean? You're a bad/sad/angry killer if you kill in a way that's not considered acceptable by other players? Last I checked, so long as you're not violating ToS, you can play however you damn well please. It doesn't insulate you from criticism, sure, but the criticisms are based on personal feelings rather than objective truths. DbD is not a game where you cater to someone else's "experience". If it is, then I'd like to know where the honor threshold is for survivors in chases. If killers are to leave the hook and allow for the unhook, I want survivors to eventually stop looping and let themselves get downed. I also want survivors to not cleanse ruin unless it's been up for a couple of minutes. What's the matter, can't hit the skillcheck? 
---
These moronic restrictions and moralizations really need to stop.
---
You can't depip at all until you get to 15.
---
Psst hey you, yeah you I think you should change the tag since this obviously isn't lore related.
---
Hey I look pretty okay?! The mask makes me feel sexy..
---
Recoding the game for dedicated servers doesn't really have anything to do with the coding of outfits onto models, otherwise they would have to recode every outfit in the game.
---
Idk about unique but trapper has a very menacing walk. When he sees you and starts coming your way its scary
---
Read what I said.. 
---
He was disagreeing with the dev's argument, and thus disagreeing with you for thinking that argument was worth bringing up. In fact, it really has fuck-all to do with the current discussion, since we aren't debating how powerful the perk is.
---
So, yeah, turns out hiding behind an irrelevant quote from the developers isn't a blank check to insult people and act like a twat.
---
Don't forget to repost the video again in a couple days so we can keep laughing at the same joke
---
If you are gonna be using addons that are considered to be overpowered, you should except people to disconnect when they aren't having fun. 
---
Obvious troll is obvious. (Seriously, 'lore'?) That aside, on the off chance you are actually serious...
---
Unless someone is holding a gun to your head or the head of someone you love and FORCING you to play Dead by Daylight you have literally only yourself to blame about getting that upset.
---
It's just a game. Games are fun things people do in their leisure time.
---
If ain't enjoyable for you, stop playing it and do something else. 
---
How am I supposed to respond? You just hate the game I guess, do you not understand how game developement works? The game won't just magically become better because you want it to. Your mentality is toxic, and childish and I honestly don't know how I am supposed to respond because you aren't giving me anything to work with here.
---
Why are you telling me like I’m the one making it haha. I don’t care if they add it in or not I’m simply stating that I can see why it can work sometimes. Go tell the devs, not the players. 
---
Quitting for months doesnt excuse being a cunt running 3 strong perks and a good killer. Especially not when I can easily get a pip at rank 3 with 1 perk going against a 4 man swf. But hey this sub can keep defending people instead of promoting being decent people. 
---
Cue Killer bringing Mori and facecamping. 
---
I mean unless you literally never go out surely you have a budget for recreation. Again if your casual no point but if you're sinking hundreds of hours in to the game why not just get the DLC to make your life easier with double BP?
---
You should too 
---
The same could be said for every single person who comes to the sub to promote dcing against certain killers and to complain and promote toxicity. I've never seen a community of mostly adults act like middle schoolers till joining this sub. 
---
I was about to 4K then a tree decided to hug me until everyone escaped.
---
The happy thing was actually meant for the guy to whom I answered, since he seemed (in my own and of couse subjective mind) kind of pissed. The only thing that is actually "wrong" with camping is that you lose rank; if you think the definition of winning is ranking up then it would make it wrong. I don't disagree with you by the way. But I never said that you have not to camp because of honor or morality, what I said is basically that people that camp are mostly bad (i did mention you might have true reasons to stay close), and that it's "scummy" because it's totally non-interactive. I guess you think I'm saying that because in this subreddit yeah, people mostly feel there's a code to play, and let me tell you I've camped people that tried to ruin my game experience a fair amount of times. That doesn't make it non-scummy or anything still. I did what I want and, like you said, accepted the consequence of derank.
---
oh god, a fucking doctor player
---
I understand the pallet thing but I don't think he was just practicing. He was rank 6 and apparently a high level wraith with a purple and green add on. Perks we're (if I remember right) Ruin, Nurse's, Sloppy Butcher and Discordance all tier 3.
---
i just chalk it up to tight patrols
---
Me too. It's weird. I can't get a game as surv or killer!!? 
---
He looks he would be fun to flashlight stun.
---
I think rancor is pretty cancer, ecspecially now with the DS change.
---
any normal developer first things first would focus on actually fixing the bugs and stabilizing the game instead of showering us in new content. 
---
they have two teams. one does cosmetics, other does gameplay stuff. why not just use gameplay crew to work solely on optimizations and testings while giving the community new cosmetics which doesn't require much effort but also pays much better? if they'd go there and publicly announced that we won't have a new chapter but will get a shitton of cosmetics because devs are busy with fixing the game, do you really think anyone in the community would be pissed and not happy that devs actually think of us? 
---
you know, what they do is basically like bad parenting. they shower us in candy and new toys instead of fixing old ones and teaching us being more careful/patient. not that they have to teach us anything but they don't want to realize we can handle some time without new content if they focus on working on optimizations. way too many people quit the game because of how disgustingly broken it is. 
---
Definitely!
---
Accurate. That’s why I love it and this game
---
DBD PITCH MEETING LEAKED TRANSCRIPT. 
---
-We could add the headless horseman. He could ride his horse. And he can mori you with this cool decapitation anima...
---
-nah man. Let’s add some kids with a sick leather jacket and one of those party city Halloween masks you can decorate yourself!!!! 
---
Months later
---
-maybe this time we can use my headless horseman idea...
---
-how about a killer that pukes all over you????
---
“If you’re nothing without your shirtless Myers, then you shouldn’t have it.”
---
Alright so here’s a solution for ya.
---
As someone who is tired of doing literally EVERYTHING (unhooking survivors, doing gens, looping the killer) and then dying first hook, I’ve decided that the best thing to do is:
---
Treat those clauds and Neas the exact same way!! If you see a brown shirt claudette on your team, or a Nea with Urban evasion go find the basement asap, go into a locker and wait. If they complete a generator within 2 minutes then get out and play normally.
---
If they don’t, and they die too wuickly in chases and aren’t being altruistic, stay there for the entire game until everybody else is dead. PUNISH them. Give them a taste of their own bullshit.
---
Yeah, doing this can turn BBQ into a chance to mind game the killer, being 40 meters away from him gives you a lot of time to telegraph something and then change directions.
---
Or, after you see someone get picked up, just hop in a locker for a couple seconds, or if you're close enough just stay within 40 meters. It's really not that OP of a perk. 
---
The main thing it punishes are immersed survivors who want to be able to crouch all game and never get found.
---
I'd say it's closer to 5/10 times. Then 4/10 you get Wreckers and that last 1/10 is every other god damn map in the game.
---
&gt;"no need to rush literally anything"
---
This. Exactly this. 
---
No one expects it, that’s why it’s so strong
---
That’s good advice. I’m definitely doing that. I was also thinking of using bond to find these people and spending all those firecrackers I saved... but I guess that’s working with the killer isn’t it?
---
Reminds me of my first few times here...
---
"Haha, look at this toxic build?"
---
"It's designed to annoy people?"
---
"No."
---
"It has an annoying amount of game slowdown?"
---
"No, it has the best avaliable Killer options in their opinion."
---
"isnt that how perks work"
---
Tbh Plague’s mori animation is disgusting. I nearly puked myself.
---
Dense.
---
I always thought that Legion was meant to be Ghost Face at one point because all of the character traits are very similar to GF. 
---
I sometimes just find them and follow them around, you’ll be surprised how BORING these people are. They only work on generators when they see that somebody got injured, it’s fucking sickening.
---
So uh where’s thicc Romero?
---
or maybe don't be an asshole, play the game and realize the fact that it's not your or their fault, that it's the new pipping system that cucked everyone and now ranks literally don't matter at all? but not in a way that there are bad red rank players or whatever. in a way that no matter which rank you are you will be matched with 2-3 less experienced(not just bad) players and this is gamechanging, obviously, cause it's 4vs1 for a reason. 
---
yeah and freddy plus ruin is not that strong
---
You’re delusional, immersed babies have been around since the game came out, you’re probably one of ‘em too
---
Honestly , I've never gotten so much hate mail from a single game . 
---
I main killer , particularly Spirit and soon to be Plague . And After every. Single . Match . I get at least one person messaging me bullshit to tell me off on either how bad I did because it was a cheeky SFW , or someone just mad that I killed them and got a Merciless Killer ranking . 
---
Survivors by far are the most toxic people when you compare the two . Sure , killers can be toxic too , I've had it happen to me plenty of times as survivor . 
---
But as killer , survivors are honestly terrible . I don't particularly mind the hate mail.  But jesus , people are sad on this game . I've only managed to meet ONE nice survivor that wanted to be friends lmfao . 
---
Its still a free escape, like DS was.
---
And aura reading? Lol try playing high rank killer son. Survivors dont heal. Aura reading denied. Not to mention you can just 99% yourself if need be.
---
Then was lucky you equipped calm spirit. Wimp womp
---
I'm purple ranks, which is where most of the good players seem to be after the pipping changes.
---
I faced a guy from Kyrgyzstan last night. He hit me from 8 meters away, then I was on the ground unable to move for 20 seconds, then I teleported to a hook. It was an adventure that I don't care to repeat.
---
Will never understand anyone that thinks Self-Heal is at all a problem.
---
And I never said the perks aren't okay to use. But they are absolutely boring and unhealthy for what the game prospers in.
---
&gt;it should be near impossible for everyone to get out.
---
The devs have stated since the beginning that their ideal perfect balance is 2 escape, 2 die. That's what they shoot for. So, no, it shouldn't be near impossible.
---
That can’t be right. It’s already rated M and there are other M-rated games with decapitation. 
---
I can't even describe what happened the last few days... moon rise event was great... then 2.6.0 happened...
---
* new matchmaking... which was great
---
* then region unlock... which was utter garbage... cuz playing against people with 200+ ping was annoying af... 
---
* then they "change it back" to regionlock, but somthing is garbage now... cuz it takes more than 3 mins to create a lobby as killer now... 
---
WTF is actually going on...
---
headless doesn't explicitly mean it has to include decapitation.
---
You thought that limiting regions you can match with would decrease queue times? It's obviously the other way around...
---
not if you do it properly you can also run distortion, go near terror radius, go in lockers too. honestly if you complain about bbq than you're noob
---
It's a free escape. The killer gets slowed down and you get a speed boost. Like DS it allows you to get to another loop. In the hands of a good survivor this could be deadly, especially if you get 4 in one game. 
---
Also once you reach high rank survivors don't heal. So you'll never get the aura reading. Plus you can just 99% heal yourself so the killer can't see your aura, and if they do come close then you tap heal and you get to take 2 hits again and aura reading doesnt really matter because by then you're on death hook anyway and unlikely to get away.
---
It artifically extends chases, requires no skill to use and has zero counter play....sure what's not to like about it for the other side.
---
But obviously it sounds string that why the survivor mains here are going crazy for it. Thats also why all your top twitch killers have also said that it sounds extremely powerful and will end up being meta. People need to stop judging the game based on rank 12.
---
I mean whats the point in learning how to get good at evading when you can just have a perk extend the chase for you?
---
Well,if they did that WiFi label thing that'll obviously hurt people that play on wireless,I can guarrantee you people do their best to avoid it
---
Yes but as darkwing has said, the game is balanced for 2 people to get out.
---
Anecdotal evidence but there are many, many people reporting that nobody is getting out anymore. I see this in my own games as survivor and my own games as killer.
---
The killer is meant to be strong and thats why they're the only one that can attack but they're not meant to win the game so easily. The fact is it seems killer seems so easy these days that your average killer can wipe out your average survivor team.
---
It didn't get the memo that he's not invited to the OP stuff club anymore.
---
After seeing someone get downed 2 seconds after using DS, mid-tier is awfully generous.
---
Rating system is determined when a game goes up for review. The devs signed a contract that gives them boundaries in what they can and can't put in. Look up a YouTube video about creating the spirit and you will see Cote himself say it. 
---
It follows the same concept as a headless character. It would be cool but Cote himself said it probably can't happen. Their Livestream #107 has the line. I don't know when exactly
---
You didnt DC. 
---
I did, I wasn't the one recording...
---
I love Legion, but the players that are the moonwalking making Legion unfun. 
---
But playing against a fair legion that you have a chance to disappear when in the frenzy is fun and has counterplay. 
---
Hell it's why I've got a build dedicated to countering Legion.
---
If the maps had more grass to hide the blood trail, it'd be fine. But maps like the game, are impossible to counter a moonwalking legion
---
That was so f\*\*\*\*d up. And it definitely helped begin to draw that brawl to a very slow and confused close. 
---
LOL BABY KILLER MAIN Wow bro Decisive Strike isn’t OP I use Dead Hard only and no other Perks I WILL QUIT ALL LEGION GAMES 
---
The framerate on Xbox make it more of a tossup, at least for me.
---
The people working on purchasable content are completely different than those working to fix things. 
---
How original, another 'Freddy is bad' post......yawn.
---
Then no. Ive yelled when spoopy myers was behind me. Spine chill for the win!! 
---
you should reword this so it says "not losing pips if you DC as killer", really misleading otherwise
---
also i think ds shouldnt be affected by enduring cuz its literally an insta-recover with it
---
[Here's the actual descriptions, I'm sure some of it will change](https://imgur.com/a/R4BVsk8)
---
I think you mean Thursday. 
---
Plague has a map though. It’s really cool too.
---
It's only been Clown and Plague so far that went in existing realms, Legion and Spirit had original realms.
---
Thing is, I can't even recall the last time I've had 2 god tier survivors on the same team, let alone a single one. It feels like as I got better, the "bullshit survivors" kinda just vanished.
---
Most lobbies are filled with absolute fucking idiots, and these arguments about objective balance are a little silly once you experience games at each rank, and see just how little things line up with theory.
---
I can see it being a good thing. If they were to rewrite the code from the ground up, they could get rid of the spagetti code and since they already know what the game is supposed to do, it will be easier to avoid creating new spaghetti code
---
you're entirely right, I just meant that it's probably going to take forever for them to code something seemingly as simple as this considering how much time it's taken to get servers in
---
Every game I played today was looping to a door or window then heading straight for pallets, had 2-3 games where I broke every pallet in the level. Not going to complain because I usually still manage to kill a few. In particular I ran into a Macmillian Estate that had 3 pallets in the lower level; one to the side of the first row, at the end of the third row while the other side had a pallet in the middle row. It was a bit strange.
---
No point being subtle since last week.
---
Would you prefer them to run out into the open?  
---
Stupid place to ask this but what about moonwalking (I wasn’t legion that game, I think I was Plague actually) with a survivor on your shoulder because someone’s standing by the hook trying to flashlight? I feel like I’m a bit justified here. I mean the whole counter to flashlights is not looking.
---
lmao these are both good ideas and they are down voted to oblivion. do all these forum lurkers enjoy wow or something? 
---
EXKS
---
DEE
---
There was no wiggling out. It would just stop me in place. I've 'repaired' the game, and I still have a button that's 'undefined', it does nothing, and I can't pull pallets down.
---
Not a bad idea.
---
I think it would come down to the numbers how many blood points would it shave off.
---
If I remember correctly it takes something like 1.5mil blood points to get to level 50 and you have to do that 4 times then to get all the teachable for each killer is like another 500k. I could be wrong but grind as it stands now sucks
---
I hate it so much. 
---
yeah that would be really something good
---
I really want to see this game at it's fullest potential and that would be a huge step in the right direction
---
It's a weird bug rn. Any DC negative pips will revert the moment you restart your client. I'm using it to DC any games I'm gonna negative pip as a way to increase rank. 
---
But she won’t be getting anymore. The red forest is for huntress so all future red forest maps are gonna be hers only. Clown might be on one of them but I’m guaranteeing that Plague will have no future content.
---
No because it almost seems like the last line of defense. It's the fact of getting blinded at over half of them.
---
Nothing makes me angrier than dying to a killer who lives across the fucking globe. I want to play against a killer from North America, so I don't get teleported around the fucking map every survivor round.
---
As Doc I'd say forget about Madness till you've got at least one guy hooked. Use treatment to find first dude, and perhaps deny vault/ pallet with the shock if you wanna be a god tier doc.
---
Doctor's passive ability I've found is to be the killer that's easiest to 5 gen loop, cause they insist on getting you to madness 3 before bringing the hammer down, giving you enough time to figure out their basic behaviour and find good tile setups without wasting any pallets for a good 30 seconds.
---
Idc about karma i just say what i mean
---
Hiding is a very fun thing people should try it anyway. Chases should last anywhere from 45-60 seconds
---
Nea should have better falling than crouch.. who even crouches in 2019?
---
I ruin people's day whenever I use Freddy. He may not be good, but damn, it's like nobody knows how to counter him.
---
It's funny because killer mains used to say "The entitlement of survivor mains is insane."  
---
Ditch the tribalism, we're all people here.
---
Well theres not an exact number of how much it would shave, but obviously if you mostly buy higher rarity stuff you will see a pretty big difference as the prices go fron 3000-7000
---
I 5 gen run the killer, so after 20 seconds i need to stop running and let him knock me? Oh, ok 
---
So is 3rd person view from survivors, get rid of that and its fine.
---
Remember when flashlights used to instant blind tho? 
---
I mean, he needed to get at least one kill I guess. He's probably a noob if he's playing Hillbilly.
---
They should add that. Killers could easily camp the hook anyway
---
dafuq do you mean he has solid points
---
I mean a ton not a load. Literally over 60% of games or something
---
For every second you are healing so yeah. Faster healing means reduced effectiveness. It is to prevent instant Exhaustion recovery by using Instaheals therefore I used the time you heal not progress based.
---
Let's make the most fun part of the game the shortest, lmao
---
Leatherface is the least fun killer to go against for me. I'd legitimately rather play against Frank's Mix tape.
---
If you name yourself geniffer and not jeniffer, you deserve to get taken by the entity
---
Never have I needed something so badly and not known until it was brought up.
---
You deserved it 
---
I'M A NOOBY RANK 19 KILLER AND IT'S MY LITERAL SECOND GAME AS THE PLAGUE, WHY AM I GETTING MATCHED WITH RED RANK SHIRTLESS DAVIDS WITH FLASHLIGHTS EVERY FUCKING GAME.
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT PS4 KILLERS HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED ANYONE BESIDE MYERS? I AM GETTING SO FUCKING SICK OF HIM, I DONT MIND FACING A UNIQUE SET LIKE SCRATCHED MIRRIOR MYERS OR TOMBSTONE BUT NO, EVERYONE PLAY HIM THE SAME WAY WITH THE SAME COOKIE CUTTER PERKS, STALK UNTIL EV 3 AND START ATTACKING AND ITS NOT EVEN INFINITE EV 3. 
---
I JUST WANT SOME VARIETY DAMMIT. 
---
Pharmacy!
---
Why is sprint burst there?
---
I think this would get rid of most of the P3 claudies but its just going to add to the grind of getting all characters as now theres a reason to have all of them with all the perks.
---
Have you ever heard of a map?
---
I used to let them go, but the new pip system made me greedy.
---
This happens to me on a daily basis
---
Wait people complain about BBQ? I fucking love the perk, it promotes healthy gameplay. (Not tunneling/camping)
---
fair enough but I've had a lot of fun with stealth recently
---
Hillbilly is better.
---
Thanks, I just want to see some of the grind removed but also give prestige a real purpose.
---
It’s an interesting idea, but I think all the values are too good and that this would swing in the favour of survivors, perhaps if they also had a downside or if the values were lower
---
they will probably sneak that in for the easter

---
Because little kids can't handle losing. Survivors and killers that disconnect are usually around 12 years old.
---
I feel as if most people already have a decent set up on most survivors, also it'd make playing survivor off the start more interesting not just 
---
1 pick claudetee
---
2 get self care
---
3 pick nea or david
---
4 get BL or DH
---
5 choose someone you like
---
6 grind someone you like
---
7 play the game
---
I really dont see anything wrong with it tho
---
I HATE CAPS
---
It's a game within a bug. What's new?
---
When you luckily use your bp build
---
fair enough both options work for me
---
and I feel as if killers are in a really good spot right now
---
^ killer main
---
Thing is if you are hooked near a hatch and you use deliverance you are facing a standoff, and we all love those don't we?
---
you don't find it boring when all survivors are literally the exact same end game?
---
Oh and forgot remove perk tiers. All perks basically do the same thing anyway so this would remove the grind massively
---
If they want to release some new legacy for people who are p350 already cool. But right now it would take over 50 levels to get every perkeven once.
---
at least they're doing a good job so far 
---
Going to start trying this kind of thing, always good to make someones day just a bit better.
---
*cleanses* Fuck! It wasn't the Ruin!
---
thank god someone else remembers this, I thought everyone had forgot.
---
Wrong. Micheal has the thickest.
---
Length isn’t everything.
---
Not really. They release licensed DLC to fund themselves so they can fix bugs and balancing issues.
---
When I let them do all the gens so they think Im bad
---
Dying light, Rancor, NOED. 
---
All killers have to agree to the arbitrary made up, change from day to day rules that only benefit the survivor. You can't actually play to win. Your goal is to let the survivors crush you so they feel good, but you can't crush one of them without being toxic. It's the name of the game.
---
maybe a new legacy and rework
---
oh wait... it's be
---
Good killers shouldn't respect pallets either way. Whether I have Spirit Fury on or not I still swing through pallets. Once survivors know you have it they typically just throw down the pallet a little early so it won't activate. Bamboozle isn't that bad as it cuts off loops and forces the survivor to make another play. Also *cough* Clow main here. Bamboozle is a fine perk on him. Yes, his power is anti looping, that doesn't mean you shouldn't enhance his power. That's like saying not to run Monitor on Myers. There's nothing wrong with enhancing something that's already strong, it, you know...plays to the killers strengths.
---
Okay, everything here makes perfect sense except...
---
You think Adrenaline is OP?
---
They’re trying, dude, even if it doesn’t look like it to you. Doesn’t really help that they’re mocked on a daily basis. 
---
I wish they wpuld do away with ranks and just mix us all up. Maybe it would help with matchmaking instead of splitting the player base up and it searching for matches per rank that never works right half the time. 
---
Put him on the horse as his power, allowing you to see through your horses eyes, power lasts 10-15 seconds based on balancing. If you manage to run them over with the horse, (who will handle like shit) they’re trampled, causing them to instantly go down and make loud grunts of pain until they’re healed (pairing with strider lets you track them down by sound alone). If you hit them with the axe on horseback, its like a regular hit, and their aura is revealed to you for 5-7 seconds when you get off the horses back. 
---
Or just let the entity see through his chest or some shit.
---
Shes mid tier probably highmid tier at that. Shes guranteed to hit you with her sickness and her corrupt purge can destroy whole teams. 
---
She can also run behind someone and vomit on them lile before yiy jyst can run around ready to do so.
---
Lastly shes 115 movespeed with a decent ability that already puts her abpve most other 115 killers
---
Unfortunately, this would make people playing the same top tier survivors over and over again. I'm always getting people playing different survivors and it keeps the game fresh. Making some survivors better than others = see those survivors in most of your games
---
An m1 killer 115 who only has to hit you once is pretty devastating plus this strat only works if the whole team doesnt heal
---
Nah. But if I placed NOED alone, would probably been shit on. So I put its surv equivalent. Balance :D
---
After a few more matches against her I'm starting to agree with you a bit more now. Though against high level killers it's still an extremely risky play.
---
Sprint burst LUL
---
And also, provide some more rewards. Like, maybe scrap your idea and try this: If a character is at Prestige 1, they gain 33% more bloodpoints. *Period.* At Prestige 2, they gain 66% more bloodpoints. And at Prestige 3, 100% more bloodpoints. Maybe add bloodpoint gains to the bloody prestige outfits. 
---
* Bloody Torso/Pants: Additional 33% Bloodpoints. (Stackable)
---
* Bloody Body/Head: Additional 33% Bloodpoints. (Stackable)
---
* Bloody Weapon: Additional 33% Bloodpoints. (Stackable)
---
Myers would beat freddy, nurse and wraith. If nurse can't take him down in one slash then daddy myers is stabbing her in the throat while she's having an asthma attack. You can interact with freddy in the game at all times, so even while in the dream state myers can kill him. Besides, Freddy has no more range than myers and is stuck with slashing with his small finger knives, thus would easily go down from an agressive lunge from myers. Now wraith, if myers can stalk an immersed Claudette then he can see lunbering shimmer thudding towards him. And, wraith is vunerable while decloaking.
---
They're doing better than most.
---
Seriously its funny at this point, DS is beyond dead. Also sprint burst and adrenaline are strong perks like ruin and bbq they arent broken like mixtape or unfun lile legion
---
I never got people from NA or Asia in my lobbies 2 days ago.
---
Yesterday there were tons of people from NA in my lobbies.
---
The same goes for survivor perks. Everyone needs a extra hand sometimes. A killer wont run a perk to entertain you they are going to use something that will help them out where they are lacking. 
---
Anyone called geniffer 100% did not name themselves they were cursed by their parents. 
---
Add a "(console)" in the title, people are getting mislead.
---
Oh lol, I wantes to write "their kid"
---
BBQ by itself is a nice perk just due to those aura reading capabilities. But you *can't* resist that extra BP. I don't even know why it has additional BP bonuses, but hey, I'm not complaining. I imagine this is why it's so popular. 
---
To someone as inept as you, I'm okay with your thinking that. You have my permission.
---
That’s a pretty bad killer.
---
I didn't notice that B and thought they were handing out LOOD
---
I'm listening....whats your secret?0.0
---
I mean, I celebrate when that happens. It's early, if the killer wasn't already coming at me they def won't get me before HG runs out. I killed their perk super early in the game. whats not to cheer?
---
always cleanse, it's better than allowing a killer to keep all 4 of their perks. 
---
Thank u 
---
Don't tell me there isn't enough paid content in this game... "The game is cheap". Yeah and the cosmetics are ridiculously expensive there are plenty of DLCs and the grind is huge. 
---
Thanks, I guess he's still okay in lower ranks ?
---
Yeah that’s true, I don’t know that the pickup times are really an issue rn though. That’s the main point I’m unsure on and don’t really agree with. 
---
Personally, I really admire the team's commitment to the game as a whole. They strive for constant improvement &amp; growth, which requires risks to be taken that many other developers wouldn't even attempt. 
---
DBD is one of the few games that get me giddy and excited by just seeing an update notification. Thank you to all that help in the development of many people's favorite game

BEHAVIOUR CHANGED IT BACK TO THE OLD MATCHMAKING AND PS4 QUEUES ARE BACK TO SHIT. I HOPE BEHAVIOUR FIXES THIS SOON, I BELIEVE IN THEM.
---
No, killers absolutely bank more on a linear play-style when they have Spirit Fury. And I'm not talking respecting pallets. You shouldn't. But a lot of killers that don't have Spirit Fury need to fake going around while actually going for a swing while hiding their red light, or moonwalking, or going into Crouch mode as a bluff if you play Pig for example. All that goes out the window with Spirit Fury. It's just pallet dive, pallet dive, pallet dive.
---
You aren't enhancing shit by running Bamboozle on Clown. His power already shuts down windows entirely due to running slower and never getting a fast vault. You are 100% hindering Clown by running that in lieu of something else.
---
And as I said, there's nothing wrong with running Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, or Hex: Ruin from an efficiency standpoint.
---
Nurse could blink but it would still be a battle. Is freddy going to loop her and have her blink him? Freddy is quick in fvj and slashes jason up and a blink is a momentary thing. He also gets decapitated and still doesn't die. I think we could find ways and scenarios to make any killer loose to another. 
---
Legion walks around like a Scooby Doo villain and I love it.
---
Ngl I think it syncs up well to the older soundtrack for the show, just a bit.
---
As a serious response? Spirit as a whole along with her phase effects, Doc in punishment, Hag's spooky hobbling, Mikey in tier 3 walking around, and Leatherface's tantrum are some of my favorites.
---
I run agitation on a lot of my killers because I think the speed is hilarious. 
---
Sometimes I'll pick up the farmed survivor and then chase the other guy down while holding them, the amount of times they notice and don't struggle so I can get them is even funnier. 
---
We must join forces to bring down the farmers!
---
Really don't know how people are having so much trouble grasping the fact that I SAID THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH RUNNING THESE PERKS. Run whatever you fucking want. These all just make the game toxic or boring. That's all I said.
---
1. Whether or not Freddy gets a rework (I sincerely hope not), this tier list reflects him as he is now.
---
2. You underrate Freddy too much. (And now I know who you are. Hi, guy from YouTube who convinced me that Mint Rag is alright!)
---
3. Spirit with MD Ring and Prayer Beads is better than Hag, true, but not better than omegablinks Nurse. Beads Spirit is insane because of the free gen grabs alongside her already good power, but Nurse's power is already insane without addons. Omegablinks removes all counterplay *and* gives her map pressure to rival Billy, with the only difference being that she doesn't need a clear line to chainsaw through.
---
3. If killers ran their absolute best addons, my tier list would change quite a bit. I could post that in a separate one, just for kicks. I disagree that Huntress is better than Billy even with Iri Head, although it's close - Billy still has an instadown, but he also has insane mobility, which Huntress does not. Phuck Frank's Mixtape.
---
4. I also use browns and yellows in my tier list, occasionally greens if we're to assume the player is a one-trick with addon numbers in the hundreds. 
---
Survivor in particular is getting stale. Flashlight saves are fun counterplay. Maybe not old speeds but a medium between the two
---
 thats speculation! 
---
I dunno what you're going in about to say sprint burst isn't good 
---
We gonna Thanos the DBD community? [Oh baby](https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/safenetwork/original/3X/6/5/65085fe5d8ebaa4e9671d5c2e59d98e2044b469e.gif)
---
We didn't even get finger guns for Ace
---
You can stun invisible freddy and wraith so they could be stabbed. Freddy can't be seen though and could easily get myers. 
---
Tbh, I would've killed the guy in the locker and not the guy who ratted him out. Hatch campers and idle teammates just are so irritating, just waiting for you to die so they get hatch. 
---
Or don't rely on BBQ.
---
You have eyes and ears, use them. The amount of people who accuse me of hacking because I find them by sight and sound rather than BBQ is absurd. I'm starting to think that either I have super senses or everyone else is blind and deaf.
---
It's bad for you but some people prefer that they reverted it.
---
DMAN FREDDY
---
Call me a survivor main or whatever (even though 90% of my time's on killer and have nearly every killer is prestieged) but  if you're running franklins mixtape and cold dirt with Leigon, expect DC's which isn't their fault. 
---
Leigon is not fun at all playing against and requires no counter play. Honestly if you can't deal with a survivor bringing stuff like Self care, Sprint Burst and flashlights (I don't get why people think it's so powerful, just look at a wall or press R and they have 0% chance of saves.)
---
You can change it from a free for all to a 1 vs 1 you make freddy lose. 
---
Kind of to be expected when you make a meme like this.
---
I don't like that idea because it almost forces you to wear the bloody stuff and why would I ever then buy cosmetics? I'd have 0 desire to wear anything else. Also if a prestige character gets bonus points then I'd also almost be forced to play just that character to farm the others up that seems boring. 
---
I like my idea you bank a mil points prestige and possibly get a viable build so you can keep playing that character. As it stands now prestige feels more like a penalty.
---
I'm thankful for the game itself. It has some bugs and balance issues. But overall it's really fun for me. I've met some good friends while playing the game. I like how many builds you can try out. And how the devs try to fix issues (for real). The comminity is a bit...special but that's okay.
---
I did this with Laurie when I switched to PC from PS4, I prestiged 3 her first before getting anyone else's teachable.
---
It wasn't so bad, pre nerf DS helped a lot and I discovered love for the generic survivor perks (Hope is Dope)
---
Even if he see the transition its purely chance of who gets the first blow. Its a 50/50 battle at that point. 
---
Jesus christ this is the worst one yet. Thank god you aren’t a developr lmfao
---
'Just want to enjoy a survivor round'
---
'NOED, 3 blink Nurse, Frank's mixtape Legion, iridescent head + infantry belt Huntress, insta-chainsaw Billy' 
---
But make it like struggling, where if you don't press m1 you die. Though I suppose you're just going to get face camped by the killer
---
Well that doesn't have to be. Iv seen plenty of doctors never leave a specific part of the game map just so they could 3 gen.
---
Holy shit YESS
---
Sounds cringy
---
Interesting idea but all the high ranking survivors would be playing meg because of her superior stats. 
---
30% vaulting speed is op. A Medium vault would go from taking o.9 seconds to taking 0.63 seconds which is about the same speed as a fast vault (0.5 seconds). Fast vault would become 0.35 seconds as opposed to 0.5. Survivors would be almost untouchable for the killer with these vaulting speeds.
---
Even with altered, more balanced stats, Having each survivor with a unique trait would push people away from using survivors that they think looks nice but instead would encourage them to use survivors that give them an advantage during play. 
---
Would also result in some survivors being rendered useless. For example, as a killer all you would see are Megs with no Quentins.
---
The ability to get teachables that are specific to each character I think provides enough viability to give survivors the freedom of choice of splicing their builds on to their favourite skin.
---
Interesting Idea but I feel it would create a survivor tier list which reduces survivor diversity while also forcing BHVR to make more cosmetics for the survivor that is used most by the player base.
---
I do this every time lol. Running 15 feet, turning around, and watching the killer head in that direction in the distance is so satisfying. 
---
Ikr! some time ago I also wrote in a thread what we're missing far as classic horror trope settings go. 
---
We still need a large graveyard, Victorian mansion (an indoor map please), something underground, and several others. 
---
Interesting! Thanks for the explanation.
---
I mean, this is still absolute fucking garbage, but at least they cut out the South Americans from their latest abortion of an attempt.
---
Just give us a goddamn "max ping" option and we'll be golden, cos that'll get rid of the players from japan and shit in our lobbies and vice versa.
---
That's a bit dramatic 
---
Lets crunch the numbers for this guy. 
---
Assuming a survivor where to all spawn on separate gens at the beginning then join together for the last 2 gens with ruin on throughout the match, the fastest time the survivors can finish gens is; 
---
80 *4 = 320 Seconds
---
44 * 2 = 88 seconds
---
320 + 88 Seconds = 408 seconds. 
---
This is if the survivors were to just teleport to the next gen &amp; hit greats for all their skill checks with ruin. Without ruin then its RNG if the great shows up which would remove 1.6 seconds per hit. 
---
If a killer were to constantly finish a chase every 20 seconds then,
---
To down a survivor after finding them 3 times it would take 60 seconds. 
---
To down all survivors with his logic, 3 times would take 240 seconds of chasing. 
---
If it took 400 odd seconds with ruin to complete gens at maximum, unreal efficiency as this does not consider running to the gens, this guy wants to win the game before 2 gens are finished. He has an extra 200 seconds to find each survivor to initiate his mad chase idea. 
---
I agree that the game progressed to fast for killers without gen regressing perks but it's not the survivor's fault. Its the lack of attraction to do anything else for survivors that cause this issue. 
---
Reducing the time for chases to occur does not fix this issue but instead just buffs killers when the real balancing is needed for survivor objectives.
---
The nurse came with Asylum, another variant of Crotus Prenn. Look at it like this, they're both from the same city but live in different neighbourhoods. pretty simple, dont understand why it's hard to comprehend. Clown came with a map. There is literally a travelling circus section of the map, how much more do you need? 
---
I won't, because I don't have issues with these perks, though I find them to be very boring and non-conducive to a player learning the multiple ways there are to handle certain tiles and obstacles. If you have a problem with NOED and you're using that as a projection onto me, that's cute. We don't all have the same trivial issues as you though.
---
I don't know if you talk to yourself, but if you do, then yes, you would be talking to an idiot. If you're referring to me, no. I'm much smarter than you, trust me.
---
All those perks are bad because they make for boring gameplay in my opinion, as I stipulated over and over and over again. You must really have a problem with people that don't agree with you. You should fix that.
---
Wow really... I can just imagine 10 people sat round a table frustrated that they can't figure out a solution to having a head and body piece that are meant to be connected....
---
But then they smash out the new pip system fine without hesitation... "alright guys back to the important stuff, what if we were to make the hood a different colour?"
---
Playing a strong character/build makes me a naturally angry person with the tendency to perspirate? 
---
Okay then. 
---
Leave the whales be, they are just out to stomp everyone that disagrees under their boots.
---
I'm glad my lobbies aren't instantly getting filled with people from Europe/Asia, but now I'm constantly playing against people in rank 15+.  These poor bastards should not be matched up with me.
---
Yes. Yes it does make them cancer. Because it creates a linear experience that is completely boring.
---
I'm well aware that Spirit Fury isn't always active. Don't know how many times I have to repeat myself here, but I never said any of these perks are a problem in terms of balance. This reddit needs better reading comprehension.
---
No, you literally aren't enhancing it. There is no window in this game that Bamboozle is necessary when you also have Clown's power. Throw your gas at the window so they medium vault, and throw gas a them after if it's a large window to loop like Suffocation Pit or something of the sort. If you do that, they're so slowed from both lower movement speed and the medium vault that they cannot access that same window multiple times, which is the SAME thing Bamboozle does. So, ergo, you don't need the god damn perk because your power does that as is. And on top of that, for window loops that aren't as huge, like shack, Bamboozle forces you to vault the window, so you're stuck doing that animation. Gas canisters do not, while still restricting options.
---
Clown does not at all need Bamboozle, and it does not enhance his ability to shut down loops in any instance. Period. You won't change my mind.
---
This used to be how it be, way back when. Just meant a lot of waiting around if the last person wanted the extra survival points.
---
Good bot
---
It’s not hard to comprehend because that’s not the situation this is. This is the Nurses map from the Nurses lore. I don’t know if you read the Clowns lore but he travels a lot. His Circus is gonna make several more appearances on different realms. When he appears on Ormond that’s not gonna make it his map. In lore he was never there. He never went to Ormond just as he’s never gone to Fathers Campbell. It isn’t his map. He just hijacks a spot on it. Which again, I have no problem with because it makes sense in the lore. The Plague highjacking a spot on a map doesn’t make sense since she had a large as temple.
---
hey... sleepy boi should at least be higher
---
I mean he would actually be the Headless Horseless Horseman, put a pumpkin on his head and there you have it
---
Thanks for making the queue back to longer waiting time, BHVR! 
---
Imo it’s better to die quickly and move on to get more points from a new game
---
Please counter with an argument
---
I've read his lore. He has currently settled upon the Chapel in the Crotus Prenn Asylum realm. Whereas the Nurse is from the disturbed ward.  Where are you getting Ormond from? What do you mean hes never gone to Father Campbells? The lore literally says "Now the Chapel has been joined by a strange companion: a carny's caravan, pulled by shadowy horse."
---
Myers wins by far since he has the best feats. He can survive gun shots getting stabbed etc. And is strong enough to crush a human skull.
---
You have to actually be braindead to complain about BBQ
---
64 hours to p3? Are you using WGLF as survivor or BBQ as killer? 
---

---
They clearly didn't update the auras on that map when they made them brighter in general.
---
Is this your tier list mister reddit poster? If so I’d like to debate a couple perks
---
Link is in this comment thread 👍
---
Yeah I honestly use it for the BP like OP said any decent survivor can mind game BBQ (hide behind a gen so the gen aura blocks you, change direction as OP says, two that come to mind)
---
The internet is the fourth k
---
He is likely going to take up a spot in every single realm. He didn’t “settle” for Fathers Campbell.  He is going to highjack a spot on every map variation (except licensed). One of those “oh we’ll just throw this in with this variation of Ormond. 
---
I think getting a perk at level 3 right away instead of having to buy level 1 2 and then 3 is a pretty good reward. I don't think a p3 character should have some sort of ability or power that affects actual gameplay however.
---
relatable.
---
I am speed.
---
Just put a pumpkin on his head
---
You’ve killed enough and deserve a new one! There’s far too many characters for the current progression system.
---
YES. Whispers, Sloppy butcher, Nurse's calling and BBQ is what I use. (: Ruin gets *ruined* too fast, whispers helps me find survivors faster who are working on gens or in the area. 
---
Off topic, but that image looks awesome.
---
[I feel this game somewhat demonstrates the issue with generator repair speed.](https://youtu.be/IqeyBnBPNf4) The Pig had her first down in roughly 60 seconds after the game started, and initiated a chase with another survivor pretty much instantly after hooking the first as can be seen by the fact that she injures another one fairly short after the first hook. All 5 generators were still done in 3m45s. So even though she pressured a survivor instantly as the game started, and another one after the first hook, there was pretty much nothing she could do to actually win. This goes to show why the Nurse is so common, and why Ruin is pretty much used by everyone.
---
Yup, dude the frost idea is genius. 
---
Well we’ve got hallowed eyes to go with our fancy bright legacy so we should have some fancy blue legacy to match with our cute frost eyes!
---
Not gameplay no but while getting tier 3 right away would be nice it still wouldn't beat just already having the perk and not spending the bloodpoints at all. There needs to be an incentive to take the plunge in the first place such as the devs saying you'll have better drop rates (even though you don't). I think discounts of 5%/10%/15% (maybe higher) would be good because then a level 50 P3 will make back the grind spent getting there by everything being cheaper.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks their walk is wonderful.
---
&gt; I don't have anything to say other than some rasict shit
---
Then just don't say anything...
---
&gt;80 *4 = 320 Seconds
---
Bruh, if they are all doing them at once, that means the 4 gens are done in 80 seconds plus 20 means 100 seconds for all gens to be done in that theoretical situation. Your math game is off point.
---
Who ya callin pinhead?
---
walk speed of 20?
---
I fully know my options, so I don't need advice about what to do against Spirit Fury. Someone who doesn't know that Clown doesn't need Bamboozle could definitely use some advice though so you should be wary.
---
I didn't gloss over anything. I just responded to the parts that were worthwhile. A lot of what you say isn't unfortunately.
---
And no, I'm not upset, promise. Though it is disheartening that you're addressing me as though we're equals. I'm better than you and you should really take that into consideration when you address me.
---
I might have to make that a thing now 
---
&gt;  the New Blood guys! They've got some pretty awesome games that I really like. I really hope they got some good PR there.
---
Dusk is dope!
---
Ash vs. Evil Dead is the shit and I feel like anyone who says otherwise didn’t actually watch the show (not that I necessarily blame them since it was on STARZ). 
---
It took the best elements of Ash and blended them into a perfectly balanced mixture of silliness and seriousness. I love that he’s still a total sleazeball and not toned down at all like you’d expect him to be in recent times. 
---
Honestly, if I could have any version of Ash in a video game, I’d want AvED Ash. 
---
Some people couldn't play with the old system.

Well people are gonna whine anyway, so fuck 'em.
---
Both the chainsaw bois, T3 Myers, Spirit and Clown as a whole, aaaand Doc with his animations.
---
or maybe we like to hook you right next to it. 
---
so close... yet so far.
---
It works in lower ranks, yes, but in higher ranks killers are not dumb and they often realise someone is doing this trick. Especially when its Billy on a farm, you are screwed over. 
---
And I will never forget when i hid in a locker and another survivor baited the killer to me and pointed at my locker. I can live with noed, i can destroy the totem and survive, but once the killer has bbq and gets an early hook, then catches another survivor in a minute it can be game-changing. Usually it ends with constant rehooks. Fuck bbq. At least they should buff distortion, the amount of tokens is laughable.
---
Not everyone buys the DLCs, so these offerings are like a trial run, if you will.

*my user flair*

From the looks of that little booth title thingy, I think they're work ***way*** closer with the licence holders rather than just asking what they can and can't do.
---
*If we get the actual face of Bruce Campbell, we have won*
---
I always found that such dumb advice.
---
If you are doing a gen and the killer has BBQ even if you run away for 4 seconds the killer will still know which gen is being worked on right now. Also, it is mostly a "problem" on killers like Billy and Nurse who can often reach you before the 4 seconds are even over.
---
That said, I think it is mostly fine now after the locker changes but imo it still is one of the strongest killer perks. Even if it didn't have the BP bonus.

You know hiding is kinda boring when you have more than 1k hours.  Nothing against it but its just boring way to play the game for some people
---
Jeff. Can relate to him a lot.
---
I FEEL BAD NOT REALLY BUT I AM A RED RANK DOCTOR GETTING GREEN AND YELLOW RANK SURVIVORS. I STARTED PLAYING FREDDY AND STILL DESTROY ASS. MATCHMAKING SUCKS NOT REALLY.
---
The man is right. you kinda jumped the gun and made an assumption. There's different people working on DLC's, cosmetics, bug fixes, etc.
---
He sure doesnt have any!
---
Play to win if that makes your boat float, nothing wrong with it. 
---
People who camp &amp; tunnel are lazy and/or bad killers. It isn't even optimal play and personally i find it boring. I don't need to tunnel or camp to win, what's your excuse?
---
...I didn’t realize that was exploit, I feel bad for using that as a counter. I thought people were just doing bad flashlight saves so I dropped them to chase them instead. Explains why it stopped working, figured people were just doing better saves than others. Apologies to anyone hit with that. 
---
I don't see how that argues my point, I said it should be near impossible for everyone to get out, you said they shot for 2 people getting out and 2 peopld dying. Also, look at the games you have played, unless you derabk yourself, how often is it that everyone escapes, especially when they don't sweat. I've seen it a handfull of times, at best. I only have about 300 hours on the game tho, so someone with more hours might've seen more.

Many depictions of the headless horseman have him wearing/carrying a pumpkin. Problem solved.

Sure Purgation and Campbell’s were on pre existing maps, but mind you last year we got The Game, Ormond and Yamaoka, so it’s not too bad.
---
Plus if you get to the end game and you're uninjured and not in a chase, you literally get nothing, and the exhaustion you get from it popping is actually a detriment at that point.
---
Adrenaline is a strong perk, but FAR from OP.
---
This may sound ignorant, but don't you get a bonus as a killer when people DC anyway..? (I pretty much only play survivor and Freddy so nobody DCs lol)
---
Why this called Burger King Myers ?
---
good luck getting a 4k if all you do is camp and tunnel. optimal play is pressuring gens which means not camping. sure if you're bad camping will be easier
---
&gt;if they'd go there and publicly announced that we won't have a new chapter but will get a shitton of cosmetics because devs are busy with fixing the game, do you really think anyone in the community would be pissed and not happy that devs actually think of us?
---
Yeah, I would be annoyed. They still deliver bug fixes every patch and new content every 3 months. I would like them to keep this up.  Not getting content in 3 months but instead a bug fix patch would be annoying to me. 
---
Also I doubt their teams are split in "cosmetics" and "content". There are likely multiple teams. Do you have a source?
---
Lol apparently not
---
I've never lost it, never will.
---
You've my permission to be a fan.
---
If you are that experienced in the game of course its boring. But many people with lower hours play more immersed which is completely fine if thats how they enjoy to play
---
Guess I should have put DC issue instead.
---
Well those arent tools anymore, and have simple counters 
---
This was true a few patches ago, not anymore. 
---
Love this post but the "nerf Adrenaline" is bothering me a lot.
---
I mean, those 3 gens are always going to be there. If you're against a LEGITIMATE hostage doc (as in, one who just wants to be an asshole) then they'll pick 3 close gens and hold the game hostage from there.
---
Luckily, ACTUAL hostage docs are super rare.
---
Leatherface is like the price of lunch, people are so cheap seriously. 
---
They're far from losing players...
---
It's nice to have but I'm really not surprised it hasn't been done yet. Their animators likely have higher priority stuff.
---

---
Do players not understand that lockers exist or?
---
Are you saying BBQ is OP? Because it's really not
---
It's awful right now
---
They are tools. Just because they're more balanced now doesn't mean they're useless.
---
If only if it was possible to not just interact with this community cause the only thing other than shitposts here are post talking about how OP noed is
---
FUCK YOU MYERS LAGSWITCHER FROM LAST NIGHT! 3 GENS DONE AND ONLY 2 HOOKS SO FAR, THERE IS THIS MASSIVE, OUT OF NOWHERE, IMMENSE LAG WHO STOPPED US FROM DOING ANYTHING UNTIL WE ALL JUST QUIT! I REPORTED THE FUCKER, BUT I DONT THINK ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN
---
I mean for the game I guess. They haven't done anything impressively good, they just do their work and screw up and fix it. 
---
They haven't done anything for the playerbase to enjoy more their game, they also haven't done anything that makes the game not fun. They move on a straight line.
---
There are things they could do but they don't, like ease the grind as the content grows, because it was one thing having all the perks when there where 4 killers around, but now at almost 20 you need more than 8 million BP to get almost all the perks in one character if you refuse to prestige at all. They use the grind as a main reason for people to keep playing and thats a really bad idea. Also Devotion is literally useless and I'm not gonna even talk about ranks.
---
Something in those areas would make me grateful for their attitude, but as of now I'm neutral. I guess I like the fact that is not a P2W game and the only thing you can buy with money are cosmetics.
---
I would also be grateful about them finally getting to the console optimization, but the road that lead to where we are today in that area is pretty ugly, including blatant lying, so I'm torn on that one.
---
EDIT: Also the fact that they have accepted as normal Voicecom SWF that play it like Competitive Overwatch like it isn't an issue with the concept of the game itself its a bit underwhelming.
---
The developers have done little to earn my respect and thanks.
---
Yes. Or Voicecoms, but thats more of a Killer only issue.
---
Yeah. You do
---
Gonna stop right here and say that I said it should be nearly impossible for EVERYONE to get out, there are 4 survivors for that reason, animals who are at a higher risk of dying at a young age tend to give birth to more young, same thing here.
---
Also, in most of my experiences, 2 or 3 survivors escape, maybe 1, and maybe none, depending on the intelligence of my teamates and I and the skill of the killer.
---
And as a killer if you are getting 4ks all the time, change your killer. I pretty much always kill everyone as Hillbilly, so I decided to work on Nurse, Trapper, Huntress, etc. Then you won't kill people as easy as you did with your main.
---
I'll never forget cleansing the first 4 dull totems on shelter woods,I start on the last one and just as the last gen pops I get 1000 points for cleansing it...that my friends was the most satisfying moment ever.
---
I see posts like this one in every subreddit but the problem is that news are RARE. If you take away those things from the subreddit then what's left? 1 news every month or 2, gameplay clips where only 1 or 2 are actually worth whatching, rants and the occasional art and cosplay. Shitposts can be annoying to some people, but without them this subreddit would be at least 90% rants. The reason why you often don't see them is becouse they get drowned in all the shitposts.
---
I love this. I wish there were more skins that are similar normal clothes. I love Jane because her outfits are actually things a lot of people IRL wear. A lot of the goofy or stylized skins are fun, but I don't find myself using them often.
---
Ever thought that maybe the killer would like to have fun, too? Or is that only allowed for survivors?
---
I'll love Chunky! Maybe his human form can be the killer with a power that involves the doll. Human Tiffany as a survivor would be amazing.

well then i guess you prefer new toys to actually enjoying game with old ones. cause i really don't enjoy the game right now as an audio based killer with the yet again fucked sounds. they fixed it a month and a half(!) after Darkness Among Us(alongside with fucked Sloppy on Wraith instead of making a hotfix) and i'll assume they will do the same this time so for 1.5 months i'm basically unable to enjoy the game. because not only it's unpleasant, it also literally triggers me migraine. 
---
man... designers can't be devs. what source do you need? i don't have a source, i just know how videogame industry works. 
---
Isn't that Laurie? Tell her to stop crouching and get on a generator.
---
The match is 4 survivors VS 1 killer, 1 survivor going 100% is only 1/4 of the total survivor power, while best items for killer equals him 100% 1/1, so no it's not fair
---
Well Wraith could and probably would do the same thing and Freddy would pull him to the Dreamworld as the massacre happened. Imo with Entity Dreamworld Freddy gets killed just cause the club is way longer and Freddy was never a good fighter in his movies while people like Myers and others in dbd are much better.
---
don't forget that there are killers and perks that need nerfs/buffs/reworks. it's not like you won't have any changes and possibly additions to the game like it was with Trapper add-ons or full Hag rework. 
---
the shit got fucked when they changed the engine. they announced dedicated servers in half of a year. yet instead of working on a poor state of the game right now they apparently buying license for new chapter. so imagine how the whole thing is gonna be done. as in how good the servers will be if they can't even optimize the game for a new engine. 
---
what you're saying about teams has nothing to do with the conversation tbh since it doesn't add or contradict with what i said. besides, maps also need fixing(Ormond is completely fucked) so yeah these "teams" have work to do as well. 
---
you do realize that what we have right now is basically a house that gets new rooms when the basement is moldy and the attic is leaking? i seriously prefer shit fixed before getting new rooms since they apparently can't do the fix and add at the same time. 
---
Just make them separate pieces, purchased as one (unable to purchase separately) like a full outfit, and code it so when one is equipped the other is force equipped and unequipping one unequips the other. 
---
Here’s the thing. Everyone starts their free for all and let’s Nurse comes out heavily injured. Wraith is jacking off in his ethereal plane and Freddy in the Dreamworld. That isn’t a fair fight. It’s bullshit. You’re trying to get Freddy to win. I’m not trying to make him lose at all. Like Wraith and Freddy have to fight otherwise the winner would be Wraith just cause he’s a pussy. 
---
would you rather have one just hide in a corner?
---
This argument makes no sense whatsoever. Why would you punish the other survivors for one guy dcing. They are already at a major disadvantage
---
Great frames on PS4

Harder? Nah, it's just lazy. And vs good survivors you'll just lose.

Well, besides the 3 man lobby issues I am having a good time with the game right now, personally. So I don't want to go for half a year without new stuff because my basement is not moldy.
---
Well Myers would win if all the killers had a predation phase. I’m assuming the Entity threw them in an arena and shit hit the fan. If we had a preparation phase Trapper would be way higher and so would Hag. Remember this. It’s pretty clear that Jason Voorhees would kill Myers in a fight and since Trapper is basically Jason Trapper would kill Myers before he stalked with his normal swing because it’s a longer weapon. How the fuck can Myers stalk LIGHT? If you didn’t know Wraith crosses a dimension with his bell but the light form that dimension bleeds into ours. The only way I see this being possible is by using Thorn Cult Myers but we can’t do that otherwise he’d be immortal.
---
What if they made private game exclusives?
---
All the killers are immortal in the Entity’s world. This fight suggest the Entity stopped that and that Thorn Cult Myers never happened so he isn’t immortal and Freddy’s Demon thing doesn’t grant immortality.
---
And his power could be other pumpkins around the map that he could activate and use as “security cameras” of sorts, survivors would be able to de-activate these (think trapper) and they might take up a larger portion of the screen, but if he was running 4 or 5 of these? Pretty good awareness of where the survivors are and what they’re doing.
---
DC’ing for any reason is the bitchiest, scummiest thing anyone can do in this game.
---
Claudette? Check.
---
Flashlight? Check, but needs to be brighter.
---
Has the word "toxic" in hoodie? Just like those PS3 Claudettes.
---
Oof, good thing you marked this NSFW or else  my boss would have seen me looking at it!
---
Kinda sounds like you're mad you can't derank, you shouldn't be dcing from games
---
Hey I think your wrong because I have a different opinion I will go into no farther detail of why I disagree other than insults.
---
And Leatherface
---
if you want to be asshole for survivors sure why not
---
I have agree with you, they haven't done much to make the game more fun at all, in fact, I would say they have gone the other direction. The grind gets worst with each chapter release and there is zero reward for devotion is literally worthless.
---
All of which I think are pretty neat and unique maps
---
bReaK tHe ToTEmS. No. It just never works like that. If I run noed I actually get surprised when it doesn’t proc. Like I freak out and realized that this was the 3rd time this happened to me. Breaking totems is inefficient and wastes your time. My last round where noed got cleanse I was playing Doc (I’m dogshit with him so that’s why I used noed on him.) and when by the time they cleansed all the totems there were 2 dead. They wasted so much time I killed the 3rd and spared the 4th. 
---
I was thinking along the same lines. I’m glad someone threw it out there. This is actually a great idea, hopefully they can implement it in some kind of way.
---
Sounds like this guy just wants us to stop using ruin cuz he can't hit it. Nice try bud
---
Probably because they were rated as such for including decapitation. Dead By Daylight did not have decapitation upon launch and therefor was rated accordingly. Even though decapitation wouldn’t change it’s rating (since it’s already M) it wasn’t originally rated with the inclusion of decapitation in game. If the game says rated M for sexual violence then the devs update it to include intense violence the rating would be deemed pointless because of its inaccuracy .
---
Well. If it's Ash vs Evil Dead inspired. He HAS to have his chainsaw hand right? 
---
How the hell is he going to repair generators? Lol.
---
Whispers helps. Outside of that, hatch stand-offs are just another scenario where survivors hold a little too much power 
---
Firstly activate Windows, my friend
---
Daddy Myers was all "I'm sick of your shit."
---
BbQ AnD ChiLlI iS oP
---
Meanwhile it has like a ton of counters
---
I’m experiencing this with every killer tbh. 
---
To play vs rank 2 killer is better than rank 20 killer they camp and you lose pipe or when you escape and you still lose piepe wtf
---
*placement. Turns out I don't know how to edit the title. 
---
TRUE. I'm taking a break for a while until Freddy's rework, infinite loading screens get fixed or the dedicated servers get released. When I try to play killer the waiting times are atrocious and when I play survivor I have to deal with bullshit killers and NOED every other game. I used to play killer when waiting times were decent and I never played in the unfun way everyone else seems to play. I didn't tunnel, camp, run NOED or just play as an absolute dick but that seems to be the norm these days (even though killer is easier than it's ever been and survivors physically can't be GOOD toxic unless they're in a SWF group). 
---
I used to care about this as a killer. I couldn't care less anymore. Who cares if the last survivor gets hatch? Also there is no counterplay from the survivor PoV against slugging for the 4k. The only options they have are die, or wait out the bleed timer. Super boring for everyone if they take the later option. 
---
I just get to a locker once someone is picked up
---
When the entire player base is having issues, every week... it means zero testing is happening. 
---
I can't wait for his prestige head cosmetic.

Doll tiffany would be even greater! Lmao!
---
It's probably because someone had an ultra rare addon so they gave you a killer with an ur too
---
Self care, decisive and sprint burst as "best stuff".   
---
Excuse me, are we on 2016?
---
I’m a Laurie main. I was rank 4-5 but I took a break when legion dropped. This is definitely gonna bring me back!
---
this meme really does not work since the devs have no plan on ever deleting him 
---
Honestly there is a lot they could do other than dark woods
---
Victorian mansion. Abandoned desert town. Foggy lush island. Graveyard. Ghost ship. Motel. Church complex. Aztec ruins. Go real different and have a castle for evil dead
---
[removed]
---
His vision comes from his horse.
---
True, just wanted to be dramatic
---
Heh, you may think that's bad but consider this.. we still don't have rewards for those who reach rank 1. And to be fair, the moris was good at release.. because all of them were bad. 
---
I agree. Theres no point caring about rank anymore, which means even less reason to care about losing pips.
---
Yeah fam sorry I can’t see claudettes invisible ass hiding in the corner of Macamillian.
---
To be honest I think legion and spirit. They have walking animations that you wouldn’t expect. 
---
Exactly the response I was waiting for
---
Hope should definitely be at least a medium tier perk, it definitely doesn't belong in the low tier
---
Can confirm, my laptop kept switching between  3 Wi-Fi devices every few seconds. and it made everything terrible. Like when I played overwatch every 20 seconds my ping would shoot up to 1200 for 10 seconds. And discord always said high packet loss and terrible ping when I was in voice chat
---
It's not hard to see when someone is aching for some good o'l fashioned rant and/or argument. This person is the kind to put words in someone's mouth to start shit.
---
Hey as long as you don't use NOED I'm fine with it. Lemme add you
---
I use balanced landing cuz I can't stop sprinting but in some maps it's pretty much useless.I'd rather use Lithe if I had it
---
i'm thankful that the game exists it gave birth to some of my best memories with my friends
---
Right? I got a message from a SWF group complaining about camping.
---
If the idiots didn't keep unhooking their friends the second I start to walk away I wouldn't keep killing them. 
---
Unsafe hook + no borrowed time = camping killer lol
---
it's basically 1 guaranteed dead hard that you can use only once and if you heal there is a huge negative to it.
---
Not to mention. Hillbilly, Trapper, Huntress, Leatherface, Legion and Plague can bypass it since they can all damage you without the use of M1 attacks(theoretically Michael can to with tombstone), which is required to get the necessary 3 stacks to even activate the perk
---
sounds like the spirit 
---
Don't try and say this sub is "x" biased to strengthen points or make yourself appear better please. This sub has vocal minorities that are easily upset and start shit, doesn't mean this his sub is mainly comprised of people that are biased towards that side, also you are just fueling the fire.
---
No. The point is make you feel alone while playing it 
---
I will say it's kinda shitty when they immediately down you after the 4% chance. I dont expect killers to respect it, but atleast give me a good few seconds to make it FEEL like I have even a small chance
---
Geez don't exploit dude. 
---
I agree
---
Chowdah 
---
It isn't an exploit. It's a mechanic that killers forget about bc they think they're good enough to dodge flashlights 
---
Oh yeah
---
Trapper does not possess the same strenght as Jason. Jason can punch a mans head off clean, rip people in two. Punch through metal doors, lift vehicles and has insane regeneration.
---
Yeah same here my NAT settings are weird and I don’t have a LAN cable either but at first I was like why did they disconnect and we didn’t get any BP. But I messaged the guy and asked him why he D/C and he said he didn’t everyone lagged. He was doing his daily as well and lost out on it. But there was a span of games it didn’t happen like maybe about six or seven and then the problem occurred again.
---
AITA = Am I the Asshole
---
There's a few maps you can do this on vs a good killer too.
---
Adiris/Plague\*
---
Cursed image
---
Julie is better imo
---
Couldn't fit all that thicc on the list.
---
The irony of this being a shitpost in itself. This subreddit really is the best this toxic community has to offer. And it feels like home.
---
There’s a problem with Ormond? 
---
i like legion, nurse and hag.
---
idk why, i just like :D
---
Nah not at all. I’m a survivor main and some people do mess around to much and just are dinks. Especially if they are taking their time it’s annoying. But I wouldn’t say you’re the ass for it. 
---
Sexual violence? Myers is already in the game, though. 
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Na I mean if the game is over and they are farting around, it’s their own fault. It’s the risk they take by not leaving the game. 
---
It still is their fault if they DC
---
That sounds badass but Infectious Fright would be downright disgusting in his rider mode. 
---
Instead of the gates you have to open at the end you need to run across the bridge to get away
---
I'd love if I could do like jason as killer in dbd, just yell "yeet" everytime I hit someone
---
Nah. Gonna be the headless horseless horseman.
---
Alright. That sounds actually very good. Thanks! :De
---
No
---
The biggest reason for not DCing before was not getting matched with crouching Neas. There is no reward and your games will be more difficult. 
---
Since the new matchmaking and ranking system will make sure to match you with crouching Neas anyways, who the fuck cares anymore?
---
No. The game is built around random survivors having the "disadvantage" of not being able to communicate. You have to completely rely on what you see, hear and your perks. I personally think it makes the game more thrilling and I tend be alot more on edge than if I'm communicating with my friends.
---
The little piggy that went to the market. 😂🤣
---
Did you perhaps run into someone while playing killer named gennifer genny and geneviene 
---
Ah so I see you’ve never heard of Bubba’s basement my dude ez 4ks 
---
The only reason I occasionally run NOED is to punish one of the people going out of their way to BM me when everyone can get out. Very satisfying to get the guy spamming flashlight clicks when he miscalculated how close to the exit he was
---
Momo is a pure girl. Make her a survivor.
---
VERY TRUE BUT FOR A COMPANY LIKE BHVR TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD TAKE A ACT OF CONGRESS AND YOU KNOW WOULD COME WITH A SHITLOAD OF BUGS! 
---
I had someone kobe in front of me as killer the other day as the last one left. I knew they didn't know where hatch was and they'd annoyed me all game but so I didn't wanna fully respect it but I gave them a 10 second head start lmao
---
Just posted on the official Goodsmile page.
---
I'm beyond excited. This is... amazing!
---
The safe bet is to assume it comes later for the mid chapter patch. But at the same time hype makes me want it now.
---
As apposed to following a formula? (Milking each loop until just below its maximum safe threshhold? More if you throw in a juke or missed attack?)
---
The TV show honestly felt just like the second one. It's actually a pretty great show. 
---
I respect the 4%... in KYF lobbies with people that are significantly worse at the game. 
---
Hope is fucking god tier.. counters the speed NOED gives, makes you be able to loop for longer, just in general have so much more room for mistakes. Hope is a perk that saves me so much, especially with Adrenaline
---
I know you pain but to be honest they are the exact same but very similar colour to point it feels impossible to tell them apart
---
Feel like a lot of people are going to mention it but...
---
Adred isn't OP, but the thing is that its inherent design is unfun for a Killer to play against. I think the fact that it gives you both a speed boost and an instaheal are unfair, and that those aspects could use a change.  
---
I think Adred could be nerfed to give you a 50%/75%/100% faster self-healing speed (for Self Care - also it would let you Self Care without having Self Care?) and also make you move 5%/10%/15% faster for a bit without causing Exhaustion. Have both these effects active for about 5 seconds. To balance this out the perk would activate when any gen is done, as opposed to when the last gen is done. One of the biggest reasons I personally don't run Adred is because my allies are fucking worthless potatoes who can't do a single gen yet alone all 5. The other reason is because often the last gen is done when you're doing fuck all and then Adred pops and you go "guess I don't have Sprint Burst now."  
---
Will admit I'm not a game designer and I also literally just woke up so I'm just throwing ideas into a box. I'd put Adred at a B tier of priority: it could use a rework for the general health of the game but it's not ruining the game like other mechanics.
---
As for Legion... *sigh* I've made my rant about them several times.
---
"but better..."
---
I don't know how you can compare a broken build like Frank's Mixtape to a nerfed Self-Care, a nerfed Sprint Burst, a nerfed DS, a nerfed flashlight, and Adrenaline, which only works endgame. Legion with the mixtape has absolutely no counter and is not enjoyable to play against. It's like the infinites back in the day for survivors. I don't know why some killer mains, and I say **some**, are turning a blind eye to this. 
---

I'm in class rn (great student over here). Is this real or a fan edit? 
---
It’s real 
---
Except i am only willing to spend money on things i would enjoy and i despise leatherface so I'd frankly go without bbq forever than waste 5 dollars and thousands of bp for anything that involves LF.
---
Agreed, even without the hook and weapons the basis of the game is still getting chased by a killer.. changing some animations still wouldn’t make this game appropriate for young kids.. go play Hello neighbor or something..
---
Tbh if I had to put up with that all game (With how many tines you can do it with that toolbox) I would likely DC too. Especially as wraith
---
\[Me right now... I'm so shocked and excited guys!\]([https://tenor.com/view/friends-phoebe-gif-3518115](https://tenor.com/view/friends-phoebe-gif-3518115))
---
"Eat that pallet you miserable screwhead."
---
I think Jane says “oh dammit” when she’s hit and bill says “why” when he’s on the hook, they walked so ash could run 
---
*Shocked face*
---
We all knew the character was coming wtf that’s So crazy they got his likeness and voice !!! So hyped for this. Watching the show and movies in preparation 😄
---
He will scream and grunt. That's all he gonna do.
---
Who saw that coming... But seriously that's cool tho. 
---
It's probably due to that type of violence not being present at initial release (dismemberment). Given that this product is reviewed by multiple international ratings boards I imagine there's extra barriers we wouldn't be aware of outside the industry.
---
It's possible some ratings boards draw the line at dismemberment, maybe BHVR has to pay to re-rate the game and it's not worth it. Hard to say though
---
[Me right now... I'm so shocked and excited guys!](https://tenor.com/view/friends-phoebe-gif-3518115)
---
So we have a killer who guts you like a fish (Legion), a killer who almost splits your skull in two and bashes your torso in (Huntress), a killer who literally rips your organs out and eat them (Hag) and to top it all off, hooking survivors and leaving them to hang like fresh meat is a constant thing that’s happening.....BUT A HEADLESS KILLER IS TOO MUCH OH MY GOD THE GORE THINK OF THE CHILDREN REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!1!1!!!1
---
But seriously, they said they wouldn’t do a Clown killer, they’ve done it, they said they wouldn’t do a religious killer, they’ve done it. Give us a killer that is either headless or plays with the idea of decapitation dammit. 
---
I teach preschool and Fortnite is like a good game I guess due to the vibrant colors and fun style of it? I don’t know but dead by daylight is too much for kids imo. Play colorful games or something with them. Play dead by daylight when you’re alone. 
---

In what universe was that event great?
---
Please be able to talk, please be able to talk, please be able to talk!!!

If people fall for this they they have less than 3 braincells 
---
Imo Leatherface is a fun addition and his perks are some of the best ones for farming. Of course you should buy him to support the game if you are enjoying it. It's a win/win! He's actually one of my main killers because he's so easy to play compared to some of the other killers. If I ever feel like relaxing as a killer, he's my go-to.
---
Im pretty new too and id love people to play with! https://steamcommunity.com/id/tymanboygenius
---
Do you have a discord?
---
I was thinking that, and the grunts. Might make it dramatic though like feng does with simply doing a totem 😂
---
Don’t call me stupid. Don’t play this game then. Literally find another one, but I didn’t say anything wrong to you and that was uncalled for. 
---
Does he come with the demon horse?
---
Was so hoping for an entire chapter for Evil Dead as it’s one of my favorite horror movies of all time but at least we get something from the franchise which I’m for sure happy about. Definitely my new main :) 
---
I don't want to play hello naber it's too scary for my children, my 5 year old is scared because the man looks like her dad (who was an alcoholic absuove man)
---
As a preschool teacher, lemme tell you this wouldn’t be the first time I’ve heard stuff like this lmao. But yeah they are probs a troll. 
---
So, survivor DLC only? I'm not mad, his perks are actually good.
---
I just wish they added wiggle points.
---
This is so gay and I love it
---
At least it actually looks like him this time, poor quentin and Laurie got the shallow end of the appearance pool
---
I'm inlove 
---
A licensed survivor that actually looks like them finally.
---
I find most wraiths camp too, as if they don’t have an ability that makes them move faster. That said if I’m facing a co-ordinated group, I will absolutely tunnel the ‘distractor/looper’ of them off the hook to remove that threat without any remorse. Or ignore them if they’re straight up better than me
---
I think many wraiths feel the character is underpowered so they get frustrated, and it comes out in toxicity. For the same reason I rarely see merciful Freddies. Obviously this is a generalisation but this is mainly from what I’ve seen
---
There is a god!!!!! After this update all other survivors WILL NOT EXIST TO ME. 
---
Unsurprising or not, this is so great.
---
The hit game Dead by Daylight
---
Always wondered why that number was so low. Never thought to look at the list. Ye gods, that list is anemic. You can basically get survived and maybe five ticks of anything else in any game. Definitely a place where the devs can shore up point gains. 
---
Instead of a it ringing, blood curdling scream. 
---
Coldwind really sucks (especially the Torment Creek and Rancid Abattoir variation because of LOS), but usually what I do is never respect any pallet in the see through tiles. Usually at red ranks most survivors know to loop forever until they get hit and never drop the pallet at healthy state. I just chase in circles (almost never switching direction cuz you lose space that way) until I can m1 them and force them to drop the pallet to eliminate the loop.
---
I know that breaking chase sucks but chasing down the 'easier' survivors does help because a lot cuz I find that the good loopers aren't always the best when it comes to unhooking situations, so I just take advantage of them then :D or just get rid of everyone else and tunnel the last survivor till they find the hatch and say 'ez' anyways, just the life of a huntress
---
Him saying anything would make the killer hear it. So there's that.
---
Practising his bell-ringing skills for the Killer Rock Band actually

If you look at op's past comments, it's obvious *HE* isn't a *SHE* or a parent to kids.

RIGHT?! THE OTHER SURVIVORS ARE DEAD TO ME!!!!!! LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!!
---
This is probably just for use with different cosmetics.
---
Especially when EVERYONE is punished under the new system, pip wise
---
That will give me motion sickness 
---
Yea I see that now
---
Awesome thank you.
---
Glad this happened. Right after the matchmaking update, anytime I wanted to play Survivor it seemed like over half the lobbies had absolutely horrendous ping from the killer. Turns out half the player pool I was playing with had suddenly become South American players, so the latency was...not great. 
---
still here bitch boy
---
I’m thankful for the game. It’s really fun. It has its problems like all games but in the end it’s a great game!
---
I’m currently rank 13 because all I’ve been doing since the new ranking system is derank. The highest I’ve been is rank 6, so I don’t mind too much when I get a rank 1-4 killer... But with actual rank 13-16 survivors it’s a struggle when they kill themselves on the first hook, etc.
---
I think the idea is, if you stream you have to be nice to everyone one and let them win.
---
Legion main here (I know terrible) Legion is not b tier. He is definitely A tier. His add-ons can make him S tier but we don't talk about some of those.
---
I've never been a fan of it, never will be and I hate seeing it
---
...but mainly... IT DISABLES DELIVERANCE. 
---
I never understood the mechanic of it anyway. Its like - yeah everyone can struggle at mess around trying to escape as much as possible. Except that last guy left. Fuck him. Play seriously and stop wasting time, "Last guy".
---
Yea, you are missing some braincells. Pretty sure most people pay more attention to the NOED part. OP himself even said he only put it there because killer mains would shit on him for saying Nerf NOED alone.
---
Whoa this totally caught me by surprise who would've thought?! But in all seriousness I'm hyped and need 1mil bloodpoints.
---
If playing Legion alone is toxic, then playing Claudette is toxic too. It’s not toxic to play something intended in the game just because you don’t like it.
---
It’s a tough life. Those tiles with the walls you can see through have no mind games. Thanks for the reply. Looking forward to the next rendition!
---
It'd be great if he took the time to hit on the other survivors in true Ash fashion. 
---
Yeah this. The last thing we need is a reason for team mates to play solo.
---
Everyone has this I believe. Didn't they say something about everyone having a naked model so they could make any cosmetic piece they like? If you find anymore of these please show me.
---
I'm not a sprint burst gamer but its strength comes from getting you away from dead zones. You can be in an unsafe area but you won't get punished because Sprint burst. Its also good for getting you the fuck away from the hook. 
---
No evil dead killer to go with it? What a disappointment. 
---
Are we getting a new chapter already again? Or only the survivor?
---
-16% in last 30 days on steam is not losing players?
---
Not me, him.I love using the chainsaw and I use the hammer when is needed.
---
Oh my god. So fucking cute.
---
I hope they make ALL the killers and survivors. 
---
I mean if I die on the floor after 1 down I’m gonna be pissed, but if you do end up hooking me in a timely manner idc about slugging
---
I'm suprised anyone in the comment section the video thinks its an april fools joke
---
This better not be an April fools joke
---
the newly introduced [falling grasp]
---
If killers had to respect my "4%" I'd get a free escape every time: slippery meat and up the ante
---
The reason why I didnt put Wraith in with Trapper is because Wraith can be extremely difficult to play against if the player is good. If your playing against a good Trapper, it's nearly the same as playing against an ok Trapper.
---
The quotes at the bottom of each perk made it all the more amazing
---
I am really disappointed by Temple of Purgation, because I was anticipating an ancient, Babylonian-themed, arid map.   
---
It also constantly throws me off by resembling normal Red Forest so much, and also because it's fuck huge and thus bad for the actual killer it came bundled with. 
---
At least the devs wrote some lore explaining how the Entity didn't know what to do with Plague's memories of the temple, so it just plopped it down in the middle of a familiar forest. 
---
then i get 600 points for every totem cleansed there literally is no need to just sit on gens and do nothing else, if you have a decent team it is enough if 2 are doing gens 1 loops/wastes time for the killer and 1 doing totems, you can get rid of the totems extremly fast, i dont why poeple complain about others cleansing totems and not doing gens for like 16 sec jesus 
---
Oh, well then I respect that decision. 
---
Ichabod Crane as the survivor would be epic. 
---
Yeah wasnt evil dead a shitty comedy? Why they got to ruin good horror movies and try to make them funny. Pass from me.
---
Since we're on the subject of voice lines has anyone else noticed the survivors actually say words since Plague dropped? I've at least heard them say variations of 'woaaah' 'oaaahh' when dropping like they are surprised/scared. Also I'm pretty sure Jane mumbles things. I'm glad the survivors seem to be getting more personality now.
---
This sub is the biggest producer of drag race memes behind the RPDR sub itself 😂
---
they didn't dish out the dosh.
---
It’s 95% but I still agree with your stance on slugging
---
Not sure why you're downvoted, it's literally the theme of Red Forest. Unless people want a "cabin" that's somehow large enough to be chased around in?
---
*I disagree with this person, so I better personally insult him to show how much smarter and better I am.*
---
I bet you're real fun at parties 
---
Never watched burn notice?
---
Puta spoiler flare, says EXACTLY what it is in title.. good one
---
Comming
---
That defeats the purpose of deliverance you need it situation ally. And if there is no reason to be aggressive, or if you have not been hooked - then there's no point just wasting it for the sake of it. Might as well take a different perk.
---
Sorry but if the killer has hooked the last person alive and it is the first time they have been hooked - then they don't deserve a fast-track to the end. It's not as if every other aspect of the game isn't open to time-sinking.
---
I bet you missed the other 3/4s of my comment
---
The 4% is never to be respected because in 99% of the situations in which people try to free themselves from a hook, are also the situations in which you shouldn't. You should wait for your team, otherwise you're doing anyone (but the killer, of course) a disfavor. Nobody likes survivors who purposely do that. And in that 1% of situations in which you've already lost the game like in, say, everyone is downed and you get hooked first, obviously the killer is going to make sure you don't kobe, but can you blame them? At that point it's better to accept defeat rather than prolonging the game for really no reason. So yeah, not only 4$ is not to be respected, it's usually a reason why I focus on you even more for being a detriment to your team or wanting to waste everyone's time.
---
Thank you, I really appreciate it! &lt;3
---
and encourage non-teamplay
---
The game is worth a try.. but, dont expect it to be any better since when you left it
---
They make noises when falling but its similar to the grunting/pain sounds. No actual words.
---
It wasn’t a comedy at all. It has cult comedy status because it’s an 80’s horror movie and had cheesy effects just like the rest of them. The 2013 certainly wasn’t a comedy and as far as the Tv show goes I doubt that is either.
---
You know, I really wish the devs had the Scream license earlier, so they could add it/them with Legion's power. That way, Legion's cool aesthetic could've been better used towards a more interesting killer.
---
Given the April 2nd announcement, I’m gonna go ahead my guarantees aren’t worth a damn lol. It’s likely going in as is since it’s a not a chapter release with a PTB. Id guess the perks were probably tested for feedback by the group of streamers they brought out there.
---
I think this is the purpose of deliverance and generally what people will do. But sometimes the killer will tunnel regardless of what you do.
---
Shut up and take my money (if I have)
---
Never watched the film/series this guy is from, so no hype from me, his perks are amazing though. 
---
Said no one. 
---
As killer I'm far more concerned about the queue times than I am the regions. It's not worth waiting 10 minutes for a game just to not get any chinese players.
---
I understand it's inconvenient for survivors to have to dodge 3-4 times to find a decent ping lobby, but since survivor queue is practically instant, it's better than 10 minute wait times.
---
Especially if I'll just end up getting rank 15 players anyway.
---
Billy, I wanna go fast.
---
Ok good, just making sure. I just now found out about him...even though I'm sure I've seen it being discussed on here before. I'm late to the party. 
---
Sorry, but what " respect the pallet" means?
---
You are hopeless man.
---
Just because something aged and doesn't hold up in your eyes doesn't suddenly mean that it's not iconic. You don't get to decide that.
---
The fact that Evil Dead spawned a franchise with a trilogy, a TV show, a remake, a horror actor icon, a director who later went on to direct the most recognizable Marvel superhero's first 3 live action films ever, ETC.
---
The Evil Dead's iconic legacy is undeniable and I'm sorry you can't see that. It's not just nostalgia blinders.
---
If anyone has blinders on? It's you.
---
And to think this game was dead to me
---
Didn't realise i did that was still tired when I made this post. Glad to keep you from getting in trouble with the boss.
---
Haha yeah
---
I’m in China atm on a trip so looks like I’ll be late to the gameplay party 
---
Already missed plague so far.. now ash
---
I thought about this for a good while. My natural instinct was to say Myers, because you can get more powerful just by people watching. However, it occurs to me, how often would that be useful? I'm not exactly getting into fights a lot.
---
So, the most useful in my every day life would either be Hag, Wraith, or Freddy. I thought about how cool it would be to put people to sleep on a whim, but then I realized part of Freddy's power is he's invisible till someone is asleep and I feel like that would be exhausting. 
---
I like the Hags traps for the ability to fast travel to somewhere provided you've been there before. However, without addons, you'd have to wait for someone to trigger it. And, if you laid down multiples, you'd never know where you were going.
---
Wraith, it is then. Transparency after ringing a bell, and complete invisibility while standing still. Bonus fast movement speed while cloaked. I would skip out on every meal in every restaurant.
---
‘looks worse’ So all of this complaining when you haven’t even seen it lol
---
Yeah I would be okay with the discounts as well because also getting addons offerings and items would be cheaper overall going forward.
---
Lery’s but with wood. 
---
Find a different game then dude. 
---
Did I miss something, isn't he African?
---
People like you make me seem even nicer as killer. I almost always give hatch. Unless you clicky clicky that flashlight, you can have it. Former DS wasn’t allowed hatch, but I don’t mind anymore. Play to have fun, if cruel is fun then more power to you! 
---
You forgot the killer mains who'd come after him too 
---
Quick, act surprised! 
---
Laurie looks like Jamie Lee, not sure where you are coming from there. Quentin is a hopeless cause...Detective Tapp doesn’t look like Glover at all
---
I'm a legion main. 
---
Balanced landing is great, I love using it. However, there's also many times where it's downright useless. It's map dependent, and even though Devs are trying to put a drop in every map, many OG maps don't have drops besides hills, which are great if you can get there first/ in time but it's not optimal. It's situationally useful.
---
Dead hard is my favorite perk to use, but I won't lie, it has issues.
---
- good killers can bait it out easily
---
- "Exhaustion" bug, where you USE it, but it doesn't register due to you being hit at the same time.
---
- One hit killers/perks voids it
---
- Latency issues make it less reliable
---
- over all, doesn't cover as much distance as sprint burst does. Sometimes negating a hit in an open fields leads you no where. Yes sometimes you may get that pallet/window and continue to live, but all to often it doesn't work.
---
Lithe is great too, biggest contender of sprint burst imo and really underrated, but it suffers the same problem as Balanced landing; it's situational. HOWEVER, ever since they removed the 'chase' requirement I gotta say it's actually fucking good.
---
But Sprint Burst is still very very potent; you can avoid that first hit, and first stealth hit by many stealth killers, and you can force killers to miss and waste time because your hitbox is 'catching up', meaning they'll 'hit' you but it won't register because you're not close enough.
---
This happens a lot with chainsaws, and in general just lunges.
---
That should be how he starts all matches ''A-ding-ding. Meeting has come to order!"
---
People have been using cross hairs since she came out. I don't get the big deal about it personally. 
---
I'm a die hard fan of the original series of movies and I loved the TV show. If you enjoy gory slapstick comedy horror and cheesy one-liners then you'll probably have fun with it. The characters are fun and Bruce Campbell is a blast to watch.
---
Well if you haven't heard already, April 2nd.
---
You could also mute the sound before playing the video. Food for thought.
---
Ahhh. Makes sense. 
---
Just Ash: https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1111279993886310400
---
Ah I see there are movies before the series?
---
Or. OR. A legit three-story indoors map. Think of the possibilities! Do not think about Balanced Landing.
---
&gt;1000x better than Shaun of the Dead
---
Now I know u lyin
---
I... think that's Shenpai. She's a streamer but posts montages and stuff like that to YouTube. 
---
Who is he ? Why does he have a robot hand ?
---
Well, it's sold more than 5 Million copies, so I'd consider that a big hit.
---
If we get Nendoroids for the other killers and the survivors, I might go broke
---
You forgot the mask. FIX IT
---
We are all united in our hatred of Legion.
---
&gt;I think the developers should add a mode where the hooks are replaced with something else
---
Ya know what? I completely agree. Let's change a hook into.....a noose! 
---
Listen here you little shit, either your parents are paying good money to send you to college, the tax payers are, or you are. So you fucking *should* be paying attention to microbiology because not many people can go to college. So stop browsing a video game subreddit and focus on your school work.
---
[THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/XWZi4377aAp7a/giphy.gif)
---
I need the Doctor nendoroid
---
I just like the way he said it. Gave me a chuckle. 
---
Nothing needs nerfing at this point...Adrenaline is a perfectly fine perk same with NOED.
---
Behaviour is just messing with the gays at this point. 
---
untill the 1st is over ima say APRIL FOOLS !!! 
---
I didn't think that Sloppy Butcher slows down Mending because in the game Mending is not considered Healing. Nurses Calling and other perks that work with Healing don't activate while Mending, I may be wrong though.
---
just wear bloody face, best heads in the game for most characters and you get the added p3 F L E X
---
Are they all connected or is the series separate from the films ?
---
I would absolutely say Wraith. His power grants near total invisibility. You have no idea how often that would help me get out of situations. 
---
Poor guy doesn't have a wiener.
---
Windstorm, baby. Hear that tap tap tap. 
---
Is this an april fools?
---
Wraith for sure
---
Same here, I'm just tight on money at the moment, but with Ash coming into the game, I'm definitely gonna have to buy him. I'm just really curious to see what they're gonna do about his chainsaw &amp; boomstick seeing as he's a survivor &amp; all. 
---
Never watched the TV show, but the series is good, if a bit unbalanced. The first one is a campy old horror, the second one is a horror comedy, the third one is a comedy with a bit of horror elements, and the remake is straight up horror again. 2 is the best according to basically everyone, including myself.
---
Believe he'll be paid. Devs don't give out free DLC anymore, since they have the store, shards, and auric cells. Sucks for broke players, though, since they'll likely never put his perks on the Shrine, either. 
---
"You are a horrible person for having an opinion that doesn't only agree with the killer side"
---
Jokes on you. Im the distraction 
---
I was just making a joke that it's a "sweaty" build. Honestly I do it too sometimes but it's not fun going against it.
---
He is. Ojomo is Nigerian. 
---
We have it so easy now. If they change the blood webs I don't think there needs to be a new legacy 
---
I just realized he also voiced in the raimi spiderman games.
---
I am very happy.
---
It's taken from [this animation](https://youtu.be/arEkqdiMKNI?t=133).
---
One gen was completed ;(
---
Some of the perk descriptions have foul language in them, but that's about it. For example, Hope has a quote saying "Buckle up, fuckos!"
---
From the looks of the trailer 
---
His boomstick is missing and his hand is a metal hand
---
True, I’ve just recently watched the Saw for the first time and I must say Tapp in dbd doesn’t look like him.
---
Laurie looks terrifying what are you talking about? 😂😂
---
The original movies were from the 1980s, long before Shaun of the Dead was even dreamed of. Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. The show is much better, but context is important.
---
Wonder if there’s any chance we could get some themed cosmetics with it like PC got with Bill
---
Definitely the spirit. I love her creepy movement!
---
Hah, welp
---
I use it as a form of BM 
---
Might actually dip my feet into survivor because of him.
---
All I see it a potato covered in potato.
---
Why would say that is likely? You really think  they're going to edit Father Campbells map, and take out the travelling circus stuff then add it to every other map? You meant realm variation right? I find that rather unlikely. 
---
Evil Dead is your typical 70's campy horror, it takes itself a little more seriously than the remaining films but I still love it.
---
Evil Dead 2 is when the series finds its groove and hits a sweet spot. Ash really starts blooming as a character here.
---
Amy of Darkness is the movie where it basically throws seriousness out the window and just goes "Fuck it, we'll do things our way". It's one of my all time favorite movies and has some of the most quotable lines.
---
So he’s a comedy character? That’s a slide considering the tone of the game. 
---
Okay, this is epic
---
"My name is Ash and I am a slave. As far as I can tell, the year is 1300 A.D and I'm being dragged to my death. It wasn't always like this. I had a normal life once. I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda. Together we drove to a small cabin in the mountains. It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place to translate and study his latest find: Necronomicon ex Mortis, The Book of the Dead. Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this ancient Sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites, funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages. It was never meant for the world of the living. The book awoke something dark in the woods. It took Linda, and then it came for me. It got into my hand and it went bad, so I lopped it off at the wrist. But that didn't stop it, so it came back. Big time. 
---
He has a map, but he doesn't have a realm. Crotus Prenn was designed as Nurses realm as it came out with her. Clowns map does not have a new tileset.
---
Ahhh gotcha. I'm gonna have to look up this trailer real quick lol
---
How much do they usually cost?
---
Bruh, this whole video was about him talking, so watching it without sound would be pointless. 
---
I didn’t know this, thanks, when ever I use Franklin’s I’ll remember this. 
---
This would definitely be my new main killer.  
---
And he actually would look really scary unlike most other killers.
---
I’m as stealthy and immersed as a survivor one could get most of the time
---
But...
---
Feng min is bae and her red dress is too lovely not to wear...  so if it means my stealth getting blown more often, so be it god damnit ! 
---
Yeah trappers walk scares me the most. But it's not too unique.
---
Evening you cheeky chap!
---
&gt;You could use your argument towards ALL licensed stuff.
---
&gt;"I guess the Halloween/Saw/Nightmare on Elm Street chapter and Leatherface paragraph was exclusively made for people that somehow watched these movies? Veey niche specific DLC. It's a pity BHVR wasted resources and money on this."
---
Apart from Amanda (but people still know SAW), all these movies are worldwide known. Even if people never watched the movies, they know the characters with Freddy being the most famous of them.
---
I asked many people about "Evil Dead" and none of them ever heard of this title let alone its characters. 
---
Perhaps my approach was wrong and this is a famous show on Murica so it makes sense.
---
i have a 3.7 GPA but ok. lighten up kiddo it's not that serious 
---
I'd want the mori to be getting sucked into necronomicon
---
So where am I wrong in saying he has a map?
---
Take my damn money! 
---
The killers do tend to go for the people they have already hooked. Meaning that the survivors left at the end are most likely to have more hooks left in them. So yeahhh any survivor player will know this does happen - and even in the current pip meta with people being super altruistic to get as many points as possible.
---
I mean you act like you are not meant to hide from the game. I am distinguishing someone participating in the game, with someone hiding the whole game 'licking walls'.
---
It's hardly a get out of jail free card. it is a nice option to have. At the end of the day, you can only use it on your first hooking. This is the hooking that you are most likely to be saved from and have the most time to be saved. It also gives you broken status for a while.
---
It is situational to how you and your team want to play - but it is not a overpowered perk by any means. It is actually pretty useless if you are not playing with friends (no communication) and you have a good team, because they will be all trying to save you, therefore not leading the killer away.
---
They tried to give us Bill on console but stupid ass Valve wouldn’t allow it
---
OP's become the very thing he's sworn to destroy.
---
Self care, DS and SB are not even good anymore. We are not in 2017 sir
---
Ash is a stockboy who works in S-Mart (Shop Smart, Shop S-Mart!) and he and some friends went to a cabin in the woods. There they stumbled upon an ancient book which was bound in human flesh and inked in human blood, the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, Book of the Dead. Certain passages were recited and it awoke something in the woods. Something dark... evil. It possessed Ash's friends and his girlfriend, Linda. It got into his hand and it went bad, so he lopped it off at the wrist. He was the only one to escape and for thirty years he was hiding out, but because he read from the book one lousy time the evil found him and he had to pick up the boomstick and the chainsaw one last time to fight back. Now he's here, in the realm of the Entity, and there's no beer.
---
I respect 4% for fun, but if it happened when everybody are still alive, I'll be still coming for dat booty later
---
Name checks out
---
Sorry,  haven’t been playing super long. BM?
---
Yeah they had someone dc so i let them farm, one dropped thier medkit and i just threw up on it and was like hmmm, thats pretty good
---
Yeah but you can only teleport ahead of you. It's cool though
---
Usually $40-$50 i think. 
---
Good point 🤔
---
I'd start with the Evil Dead movies, then move on to the series on Netflix. 
---
On PS4?
---
Well slugging for hatch sucks. But I kinda understand (though don't practice it myself) when killers do this because hatch standoff sucks either
---
Not sure how to feel. Ash is a giant coward...but will also kick the shit out of monsters/demons too...gonna be weird not being able to kill the killers.
---
Check out this primitive screwhead!
---
I just started playing about 4 days ago and started with Min. Her red outfit is awesome but I’m too chicken to wear it! Power to you my friend!
---
Its supposed to be videogame tapp
---
This is hilarious but true.
---
“I DC but it’s okay because it was legion upvotes to the left”
---
Definitely. I'd be cool if they took off making killers/survivors and just made a "map pack" update for a few months.
---
Imagine if you could counter slugging 
---
This post made my the unbreakabill gang 
---
&gt; The pallet stun and flashlight saves changes more then a year ago.
---
"You would make this game bad because of this feature you never brought up that used to be in the game that I am deciding you really want"
---
Fucking listen to yourself mate....
---
It is your reasoning that is wrong and not in line with the game. "If there is a small chance of survival then don't bother". That would make the game boring.
---
Yes it probably was mentioned a lot before deliverance was introduced. Anyone can see it is hardly a waste of time..
---
Yeah I'm not saying avoid that person all game I'm just saying let us have like a 4-5 second headstart. And people of course dont have to respect it but it makes me a lil upset when I'm immediately downed the second I jump off the hook
---
Worth it my fellow Min!
---
Style points over bloodpoints I always say *when I’m crying myself to sleep at night*
---
Seriously though, such a great outfit lol
---
He can say it [in this accent](https://youtu.be/tuwvnbz0rw0?t=18) instead!
---
If I know I'm not getting up, I'll purposely do that to try to deny them hook points 
---
That's part of the charm. A bunch of 20-something friends literally asked their dentist for money to invest in this tiny little indie picture and they made it on a shoestring budget. They slept in the cabin and the adjacent hill, they dealt with vagrants swigging moonshine and stealing their tools, and then Stephen King sees it and it blows up. It looks funny but it's a technically impressive piece of filmmaking and massively influential. 
---
I agree that he looks nothing like Danny Glover, but at least he looks like a human being, and not some kind of lost Who from Who-ville or Smeagol.
---
It just needs a popular streamer to play it, and if people really like it , it would become popular. 
---
Isnt F13 dead game? 
---
yup! das her tyty
---
Hah! Just a random standalone survivor dlc I knew it!
---
Yeah, when you really think about it, it's honestly a very selfless (albeit, I think stupid) act. They're sacrificing all their bp they earned that game, and two pips, just to give the other surv a chance. Not even a guarantee of escape. A *chance* of it.
---
Stupid idea, but imagine a perk that let you like, kill yourself when slugged, that way you don't have to DC and lose points to give the last surv a chance at hatch lmao. That would be wild.
---
They should be focusing on fixing broken and unbalanced things before releasing new content (not that I dislike new stuff)
---
Bad manners, saying that's used in a lot of games(flashlight clicking and tea bagging for example)
---
I didn’t even know Saw had videogames. Damn, I’m out of the loop when it comes to the horror stuff.
---
What if we all pretend this is our first time seeing this so that no one gets fired?
---
&gt;What about new DS? The new DS only triggers after you've been hooked once for a 60 second time limit. If you manage to get downed during that time frame and the killer doesn't have endurance, then you'll escape if you're close to an exit (if it's not a Nurse).
---
Your words. That is what this 'sub discussion' branched off into. Yes it seems you do not know how DS works. And now you are in denial? Or being stubborn? Who knows... 
---
i feel my soul leaving my body here, from both fear and the entity taking it...

&gt;Fucking listen to yourself mate....
---
Take your own advice buddy and don't try to to explain to me how this game works.
---
He was asking if it was real or not. You don't have to listen to the audio to find that out.
---
Not really.  
---
It's actually really easy to do.   
---
All you need to do is get to the 1m cap and then you can easily get it to 0.
---
Coward.
---
Just replace every sound he makes with groovy.
---
Ohhhhh. I don’t play PvP so it makes sense I’ve never heard that term before in regards to games lol. Thanks for clarifying :)
---
The game has it's flaws, but I'm sure they'll fix them in time. I love horror movies and I love Dead by Daylight! I'm so hyped for Ash. 
---
The point is the killer chases the survivor, the killer hits the survivor. You dont have to do anything to "charge it". You're just basically getting an extra health state for free.
---
You say its not good for high ranks, not sure what high rank you have been playing but a lot of survivors don't bother healing because it eats into generator time. Its a popular strategy among the best survivors. Not to mention they can just 99% heal if they choose to,do so, avoid the aura reading until the killer has found them anyway.
---
You say its not its final design etc but when this was discussed before everyone was like "oh its months away it will be changed" and yet its actually very close, and I'd bet money it hasnt changed.
---
A number of high rank killers have said that yes it will be powerful and yes it will probsbly bexome meta among good survivors.  Those who are experienced, can run a killer well and genrush while injured will no doubt take it.
---
Its basically a perk that punishes the killer for doing their job and has no couter play. Its easy to see why people who play killer dont like the sound of it.
---
How bad it is all depends on how it works with non-obsessions.
---
Precisely
---
I was in a game where all the mega got killed, but the janes were spared for being thicc
---
I think like 10 people still play it
---
Dont waste my time on movies that dont hold up. If I cant at least get a laugh out of it then it's not worth watching
---
There is a Pig/Amanda perk on the Shrine right now. DS was on the shrine recently. Both were from licensed/paid DLC, so who knows.
---
The series takes place 30 years after the original movies so you can watch it without seeing them as the exposition Ash gives will fill in most of the gaps but you will miss a lot of fan service and callbacks without it.
---
OK cheers for the advice!
---
Also tip- anything the survivors can interact with can be infected. A n y t h i n g
---
If you jump from top floor to bottom, you get afflicted with Broken for 120 seconds. 
---
Leave my rainbow jacket out of this! I'm trying to get better at looping so having the killer chase me is good practice
---
Yeah, he and Raimi are good friends. Raimi did direct Evil Dead and all
---
People who think all human skulls look the same
---
I'll never get classic Freddy, but at least I got Ash who looks like the man himself. Can't wait. 
---
Probably because of the leak
---
Meanwhile I’m spending all the shards I have to buy the sneakiest outfits I can find and I’m also crying myself to sleep at night. 
---
¯\_(ツ)_//¯
---
Rip Freddy, he deserved it more than anyone.
---
Right, I guess I don't hear the British there either lol, oh well.
---
If there's 4% I leave them until somebody else was hooked (unless they proceed to touch my shit like gens/totems/hooks right under my nose)
---
It's just fun to be a religious killer praising the holy RNG
---
It isn't anymore though. It is slightly different now since a while. It is still similar but you can see a survivor behind a gen now.
---
*snip* byebye ethernet cable
---
You're not wrong, you're just being pedantic.
---
I haven't played in a while and mostly play killer but why jump off in front of a killer?
---
They made perks, a character model and got Bruce Campbell. If the devs did all that for an april fools joke when their game is as broken as it is, people would riot.
---
I’m a male manly mans man. And I’m screaming
---
Groovy!
---
*sighs, unzips and getting the wallet ready all at the same time* 
---
That means official Huntress merch soon. Hopefully. ♡
---
Maybe it's Canon that Billy stole the shotgun 🤷‍♂️
---
Hey this is my meme go make your own!
---
you must’ve not opened the dbd sub when the plague/jane dlc dropped. 
---
If you 5 gen loop a killer they are a bad killer, if the killer is getting looped for that long they need to learn to give up chasing around the strong loop and put pressure elsewhere.
---
Tfw the only good internet in the entire region has data caps and you have to settle with McDonald's ass level bullshit wifi 
---
At one point he loses his hand to Evil and replaces the lost hand with a chainsaw + sawed off shotgun in his left hand. He could easily be a killer or survivor in this game. 
---
Darn
---
I'd consider him a horror comedy character. He definitely has a place in the horror genre. 
---
Maps aren't common at all and you don't magically get told all locations. Rainbow maps start with some objects tracked, but not all if I remember correctly. Even if, they are ultra rare items so not something you'll have even 10% of the time.
---
I'm a huge fan of the original movies and I loved it. Season one is very fun but feels a little directionless until the back half, the CGI blood in places is a bit of a turn-off but stick with it. Season two is my personal favourite and has a solid antagonist and some stand-out episodes with lots of nostalgia factor. Season three feels grand and epic as a finale and, although it's not perfect, it's pretty damn great. I know other fans feel very differently and don't like it at all but for me it hit all the right buttons and I adore it.
---
Are you sure? Because your flair suggests that you *want* to get hooked.
---
Lmao
---
Dont kinkshame me man
---
He probably cut it off tbh
---
Depends on availability. Most of them nowadays run 30-50$
---
Its for players who can loop killers and distract them well, the killers can see them easier so it easy for the to be found but in a good way
---
[Will Somebody End My Misery 1]

Also I dont think you know what cynical actually means, get down from your high horse man.

Nurse and hag seem the most practical. Implying you can also equip that addons that come with their powers, I could place a trap somewhere, have someone purposefully step on it and travel anywhere in the world. Implying you can't choose addons, nurse because she can teleport through walls, and yeah I may be in some pain after but I go 20 meters and am not limited to my physical surrounding so I can go basically anywhere I want/get to places quickly

Quentin and Laurie look like melted wax statues of themselves. 
---
His dick of course 
---
"Somehow"? I have a friend who doesn't like the horror genre at all and he knows who Ash is and knows what The Evil Dead is. Just because don't know doesn't mean it's this obscure thing that they just added in.
---
Yeah I get that. Just being a turd 🙈🙊 I wish I had the courage honestly
---
Haha
---
Exactly, so I say just enjoy the outfits you like and not worry about it
---
I actually haven’t had much of a change in my survival rate... in fact I think I do much better with the outfit. 
---
I chalk it up to the mental game, I love the outfit and think my character looks great, so it mAkes me happier to play and more likely to do better as a result (like I’m more comfortable) 
---
Vs me playing as Claudette (who I think has a weird turtle face) or nea(a true killer) who I don’t really care for at all, usually giving me less of a morale boost. My winrate is in the toilet with them lol
---
God I wish they would add Ghostface 
---
Just know I will look for you, I won't find you but I will try.
---
You don’t know if they don’t hold up if you’ve never see them lol
---
It feels weird playing as Bill and not being able to chuck a molotov at the killers as well
---
You should try more aggressive so then u wont be insanely worried if u get found
---
Lmao sounds a bit like Nightmare’s Critical Edge in Soul Calibur VI 
---
It's a mess of bugs.
---
Worst part is that I dont expect them to fix any of it at this point.
---
You're quite good at putting words in my mouth...
---
You mean a scenario where you "unhook" yourself either by chance or with Deliverance as the last survivor and escape by using DS when the killer smacks your ass on the ground once you unhook yourself, right? This is what you mean right? So you're trying to use recently (I consider Deliverance recently in this context)  added perks like DS and Deliverance into your argumentation in order to justify the idea that the last survivor should get the "attempt to escape" option because of these perks which "could" allow you to escape as the last one left. 
---
I don't even know what I am more surprised about here. The fact that you're so eager to get that escape even though you lost or the fact that you think you somehow deserve that option because you're the last one left. Or maybe it's the fact that you think they devs should chance this because a portion of the community uses these perks, because "muh Deliverance and DS". Either way I am done talking to you, continue having fun replaying to yourself.
---
Sam raimi? Might wanna check your "facts" he hasn't ever directed a marvel movie or even produced one https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/filmotype?ref_=m_nm_flmg
---
And it's so iconic that someone who's in their 20's hasn't ever heard of it? Its nostalgia. Sorry but iconic would be leatherface, scream, freddy and jason or any rob zombie horror film. Sorry I dont see an 80s movie that hasn't aged well as iconic
---
i just found clown's one
---
My favorite spot personally is the basement, no one ever looks there 
---
The show is much better than the movies? I don’t know about that... I think you could make that argument with Army of Darkness (even tho it’s still amazing), but the first two Evil Deads are incredible, extremely iconic movies.
---
I think it’s likely due to needing permission from the actual person to use their person as a model. Bruce looks like he’s the first one directly involved in the process. 
---
Mcote... give explanations!
---
Pretty legit they should’ve added him long ago imo 
---
I feel like people would be able to see your little wiggly lines you leave while moving. I feel like spirit would be better for getting out of situations if that's what youre looking for since theyd just be looking at your clone and youd disappear out of no where
---
No..? They aren’t THAT lazy cmon give them so credit. They’ll obviously lay it out differently. 
---
They had in game chat but people kept asking how to mute other survivors 
---
Oh fucking hell Claudettes face drives me nuts 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m just grinding her right now to unlock her teachable perks.
---
That makes sense to me. I don’t think I’ll ever have the confidence or ability to loop killers and such though lol. 
---
No offense but it sounds like you aren't very good at chases. If you force them to throw pallets down asap then there won't be very many safe areas for survivors to run to. 
---
You not liking something doesn't mean it isn't iconic I hate Ash vs evil dead but I still can't deny this is good for the game 
---
is not for b eing gay, i just found funny seeing clown naked
---
Provided youre allowed to carry a chainsaw everywhere
---
Oh did not know that. 
---
buff Freddy, make him call you a bitch everytime he hits you.
---
so is this really a 100% thing? man I love ashy slashy
---
People can’t talk in the fog
---
Holy shit, I understood why the PUBG guy got a Nendoroid since that game is huge all over Asia, but I never would've expected DbD to ever get one too.
---
Assuming this sells well enough I'm expecting a Meg Nendo since she's probably the most popular out of the starting survivors. Also she has the best potential for figure accessories.
---
SG doesn't cover the whole map, if you want to be sure there are no totems left you have to first check the entire map, even areas of no interest. I rather run Prove Thyself + WGLF and die if I am after BP.
---
Ash is the hottest survivor now. 
---
*finishes searching a chest* Groovy! 
---
April 2nd... I hope people dont take this too seriously.
---
No offensive but this is the same advice people give about lion in rainbow six siege and it's stupid. jUsT StAnD StIlL 
---
Wonder what the likelihood is going to be now that every time I play killer it's going to be nothing but 3 to 4 Ashes from here on out.
---
This just in: killer doesn't want to work for his kills 
---
It simply saying something when get hit, or down a pallet on the killer, or finish a gen
---
I don’t usually do a lot of looping and all that. Like I said, I find the game more fun if I pretend it’s a real horror situation and hide and sneak
---
(Still do objectives, just mean, if possible to avoid the killer, I do) 
---
Evil Dead is well known around the globe and Ash is considered a horror icon along with Freddy, Michael and Jason. Do you live under a fucking rock, or do you just not know anything about horror movies?
---
It's pretty much the only way to get a 4k if you want one, the only other way is to get lucky and find the last survivor before they know where the hatch is. Even then, there's a good chance they'll find it while you're chasing them.
---
Feng is best girl and her Lunar dress makes her look like a queen. I’ve always sucked at stealth so be it.
---
From what I understand from the Evil Dead 2 board game Kickstarter (RIP), Bruce has to sign off anything and everything related to Ash. He gets final say on the character's appearance in artwork and games etc. so he was likely happy to provide his own face.
---
Replace every sound in the game with groovy 
---
What part of her is thicc?
---
No, one or two would likely have way better abilities than other survivors making the other ones redundant. We already see this a little bit with P3 Claudette because she blends in so well. 
---
Now you can simply pick whoever you want without being punished for your choice because your favorite has a bad passiv. 
---
Another point is that 4+ survivors come out every year and you will run out of interesting/good passive abilities eventually.
---
Yes, I couldn’t agree more 
---
Lol u expect client side Technology from bhvr??
---
Apparently you can fix gens, gates and even the matchmaking with it
---
People outwardly went on spreading leaked info that wasn’t supposed to be released and now complain when someone posts about it because it’s “old news.”

Please, Clown, I BEG YOU! 
---
I’ll respect it if you’re the last one and there’s otherwise no comeback that can come from it. 
---
Thanks, that’s useful to know as I struggle a lot with plague :)
---
Yeah this game was built specifically not to have comms. Its supposed to come down to everyone should know their jobs but add that human element. Are you altruistic and help or do you hide and try and get out. It was designed to have that uncertainty and element of human behaviour.
---
Some when frightened may hide, others may be selfish and/or sacrifice those around them to escape and others may help their fellow survivors. 
---
And not that survive with friends who use comms are bad as it can give a killer a whole new type of challenge but its not in the original spirit of the game.
---
There are plenty of places to find groups out there if you get tired of solo surviving. Because honestly half the time when you solo queue it feels like your teammates are almost more dangerous then then killer.
---
Too bad. That game was also fun imo. 
---
When that's your reaction to somebody disagreeing with you about a feature in a video game, it might be time to go outside for a bit, remind yourself of what the sun is like and such. 
---
not my fault they tried to unhook themselves before i left. it's not like i camp or anything, i've had people unhook themselves right after i hook them and expect me to let them go
---
I said I like this game because of it's style can u read 
---
quick, everyone act surprised!
---
Or just, you know, get good?
---
Same here 
---
There is a non-zero chance to mess that up.
---
There's a pallet every ten feet
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guess not buddy. Maybe you should stop trolling 
---
I JUST PLAYED THE WORSE GAME OF MY LIFE, PUNCHED MY DESK CAUSING MY ETHERNET CABLE FALL OUT MAKING THE 15 MINUTES POINTLESS 
---
Dude. He directed the original Spider-Man trilogy. And you can’t be SERIOUS, saying Rob fucking Zombie’s shitty movies are more iconic than Evil Dead. 
---
I have a lot more fun being chased by the killer than trying to hide. I also play a ton of David so it's hard trying to blend when your character is roughly the size of a refrigerator
---
There has been a good amount of balance, it's mostly just that matchmaking is pretty messed up right now
---
I'll usually give the final Survivor the hatch if it's within my power if they escape or don't and haven't been toxic. That said, I **did** Hag Mori a pizza boy Dwight who was crawling about 5 feet from the hatch because I suddenly remembered I'd burned a Cypress Mori at the start of the match. 
---
Obviously it’s working because it angered you enough to make this post
---
Lmao I literally quoted you.
---
&gt;You mean a scenario where you "unhook" yourself either by chance or with Deliverance as the last survivor and escape by using DS when the killer smacks your ass on the ground once you unhook yourself, right? This is what you mean right? So you're trying to use recently (I consider Deliverance recently in this context) added perks like DS and Deliverance into your argumentation in order to justify the idea that the last survivor should get the "attempt to escape" option because of these perks which "could" allow you to escape as the last one left.
---
Ummm No. Not at all..
---
You said that DS would not work in this situation. But it does. I am not saying anything but facts - you are just wrong and keep taking this particular comment back to the original argument. In which I have said in separate comments what I think about that.
---
That is the only reason we are talking about DS. I did not bring it up. Someone else did then you completely ignored it and said it wouldn't work.
---
Separately, yes I think you should get the option to escape, particularly if you have deliverance.You deserve the option because it is your perk and you have activated it. That completely trumps "but I have to wait 30 seconds longer as the killer" in my opinion. Time is just a petty excuse for killers now with these recent perks.
---
&gt;Either way I am done talking to you
---
Everyone can actually see your comment and how you got it wrong, so whatever helps you sleep at night buddy.
---
Seeing this has me bagging the entity to take me...
---
Good enough for me, seems worth the look. Thank you! 
---
Eastern Europe is a shit hole. That's why the pings are all over the place. Canada on the other hand is a good place to be in. 
---
i am a woman(female) and i checked my comment history and there's nothing to say i'm not. i love my kids more than anything actually.
---
Well that's a Calus bod if I've ever seen one.
---
Doesn't Campbell's chapel have that one invisible wall at the Gen window? Or did they fix it?
---
(Not a justification, I just haven't gotten that map in a while and am wondering)
---
Evil possesses his hand so he cuts it off with a chainsaw to prevent the rest of him from becoming a deadite (common term for the demonically possessed). Later on in the movie he mounts a chainsaw on the stump. In the TV show, where this DLC takes place, he's been out of shape for 30 years and interchangeably uses a robotic prosthetic his friends built (as shown in game) and the chainsaw when fighting evil.
---
We all know he is looking for Janes nude model.
---
&gt;Evil Dead is well known around the globe and Ash is considered a horror icon along with Freddy, Michael and Jason. Do you live under a fucking rock, or do you just not know anything about horror movies?
---
I know little about Horror genre in general but even asking others about it didn't give any results. 
---
I asked half a dozen people who play DBD with me and none of them knew about this title. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Doing some research looks like a shitty 80s movie with below average acting so I understand why nobody (close to me) knows about it. 
---
Anti hemorrhagic syringe btw
---
This style of game would be really beneficial to my kids as it teaches them about teamwork and bad people in the world
---
me too! &lt;3
---
The absolute biggest nut. Only thing I want now is Hellraiser. 
---
If he’s our first talking survivor, I wonder if they’d be willing to update other survivors with voice lines. 
---
Ok
---
Nobody’s stoped me yet! Muhahahaha
---
DONT FUCKING SAY THAT LIKE YOU FUCKING KNOW WHAT IVE FUCKING BEEN THROUGH CUNT 😡😡😡
---
I wasnt angry i just asked but now i realize i worded it like a salty bitch
---
But if I have to turn a different direction, that means I can't sit on a generator for 99% of the game.
---
Nurse can’t sing well but they let her try she’s getting better 
---
I don't know what a noose it but it's probably better then a meat hook witch is very violent
---
I'd snatch up a Hag or Clown in a heartbeat, I think.
---
I mean yeah maybe like a year ago but the maps are well balanced and not every tile spawns two pallets anymore. Once a tiles pallet is destroyed it becomes a dead zone for survivors. The more pallets you're breaking,the more dangerous the map becomes for survivors
---
Yeah you can get some unlucky spawns with a pallet near a window but it never feels broken to me. If you notice you're chasing a competent survivor try and break chase for someone else.
---
I'm still waiting for them to say April fools on this or at least the revealed perks.   Survivors have no voice lines, so pretty much anyone can do their grunts.  Paying Bruce Campbell to do the grunts would be throwing money away unless he pretty much did it for free along side the trailer here.
---
But that metal of Man perk... that is fricken OP as hell and will make the old decisive strike look like a joke.  His perks scream 'tunnel me or else'
---
noed bad
---
Ah I see alright
---
what cosmetic are you talking about, thought bill only had default outfit
---
In general try to be greedy against killers unless they display that they dont respect pallets. 
---
They’re really bad don’t worry
---
When you use hillbilly with add ons
---
Act surprised!
---
They need to release him on April 1st, and replace one of his skills with a meme skill that kills the killer, and ends the match with everyone getting 15k BP, a safety pip, and addons refunded.
---
I seriously wasn’t expecting the shitstorm that happened after this comment. Guess not many students in this subreddit, huh. 
---
The wording isn't great but it's pretty obvious that this was a genuine question rather than a salt filled rant. 
---
Didn't even make a Dead by Dawn reference. 
---
I find it so funny when they waste a pallet after camping it and act like theyve made a god play
---
Big ol oof lol 
---
It is my all-time favorite show, watch it and enjoy!
---
Watch Evil Dead 1 and 2, and Army of Darkness if you want the backstory.
---
Evil Dead 1 is a little slow, but the other two are some of the best movies ever made.
---
Wow! I guess DbD just gave me a birthday present :D
---
Play another game. Preferably a relaxing one. DBD was my relax game instead of League of Legends (god this game made me wanna die), but I enjoy CSGO, Minecraft (yeahik) or GTA V (solo or rp, I don’t like tryharding in multiplayer)
---
Then I came back to LoL and it was really enjoyable to rediscover the game
---
(butyoureobviouslyatrollsoyoudontcare)
---
I've flamed bhvr a lot in the past for poor decisions (buff freddy back pls), but you should be aware the game is far better now than it used to be.
---
Play 2016 DBD for a few hours and realize all the good changes that have been made.
---
Shack used to have 2 windows.
---
Infinites.
---
Getting stuck inside hills / trees until the killer downed you, then the killer would get stuck and need to DC.
---
Picking up didn't change wiggle bar, so killers could pick people up / drop them until the survivor DC'd.
---
Trapping under hooks.
---
Game originally didn't have SWF
---
You used to be able to use We'll Make It and heal yourself faster than the killer, effectively trapping them in corners or rooms.
---
I'll take long matchmaking and the occasional crash / infinite loading screen over all the bullshit we used to deal with. This game is far from disgustingly broken consider how far it has come. Bhvr needs to fix the crashing and lobby issues - but when people only have a few complaints, it shows the game is in a pretty good state right now.
---
bro are u a walking copy pasta LMFAO
---
u need to reevaluate your life, man.
---
Or because it's the focus of their PAX East booth.
---
personally I think we're gonna get trapper wraith billy nurse and huntress (huntress because she's become a classic)
---
If you throw a pallet down and the killer goes around instead of breaking the pallet, don’t jump over the pallet, run away in the other direction, this dude is trying to mindgame you. (Only applies to when you’re in wallhigh walls)
---
The only time I t-bag is if they deserve it and I only to it at the end. But if I'm killer and I have a toxic ass wipe that is just t-bagging for the hell of it I'mma throw away all my beliefs and tunnel/camp them to teach em a lesson regardless if it's my only kill. 
---
I swear if this is some sick April fools joke 
---
TBH I feel like pointing is funny lol. Anytime I see a survivor point at the killer I laugh, same as if a survivor points at me. Idk y tho, it just makes me smile xD
---
Joke. 
---
*finds a purple flashlight* “groovy”
---
Another question about future updates, when do the new skins usually drop for the new chapter?
---
I’m not sure how it would work and there’s already a clown so it’ll never happen but I’d love Pennywise as a killer. I think he’d actually scare me like Michael does. 
---
No killer ? 
---
why would i care it was worse?
---
Bill looks *kinda* fine tho
---
*You* should probably pay attention in English.
---
I'm personally having more trouble hearing with all characters lately including spirit. I thought it was just me however as my hearing isn't great and my headset is shit.
---
I did however since last update encounter 2 spirits running the amulet to make the phase silent but didn't know they ran it until post game screen because their phase was normal.
---
Also the chase music does seem to be a bit louder.
---
I don't blame you for not realizing such subtle details. It does seem very strange having "Language" as a reason for the game's M rating when none of the characters have any dialogue, and the only one that can speak is only able to speak a dead language.
---
Wish they would change his gender and name him nancy 😂
---
Yea, I'm not buying that it's common for everybody to stay injured the entire game especially if the killer is actually good themselves. I'm aware of staying injured and prioritize gens or just bust out the last one for the adrenaline heal, but you're telling me that if someone gets injured at the start of the match they will choose to stay injured the ENTIRE match all the way to the end. Since we are talking high ranks, you're telling me someone is going to choose to stay injured with 4-5 gens still up against a red rank spirit or nurse(ironically 2 of the killers that will definitely trigger this perk the most with only having M1 attacks), and if they do 99 heal then assumedly choose to heal when the killer comes then the 16m+ aura reading goes off.
---
It will be a strong end game perk IF you can save it until then and would be super detrimental in some way or another if you trigger it early game. I didn't say it's not good for high ranks, I just said it is basically going to be a double-edged sword, will there be playstyles and builds around it, sure, I can already see styptics and dead hard working really well with it, and other perks like OoO or solve survivor countering it's downside in some way. Inversely killers will be able to play around it as well with certain tracking perks or just take advantage of the perk basically being a pseudo no mither once spent when people want to avoid healing.
---
It is something killers are going to have to take into account when playing true, but you can say that about dozens of perks on both sides so I don't see an issue there. Unbreakable, borrowed time, dead hard, BBQ, nurse's, discordance, whispers, etc. etc. the list goes on.
---
Lol the disrespect. I play the very neon rainbow Meg. And the thing is, I might get spotted easily but I can be a great distraction. Other than that I've been doing pretty well. I win a lot of games as her and I don't feel like bright clothes do THAT much damage
---
I don't buy cosmetics myself, but if they dropped a paid mori dlc I'd buy that.
---
The game should be balanced around the best players.
---
I understand solo survivor sucks right now when you get garbage teammates, but it's still extremely easy to shit on a killer if you have a good team.
---
Play a SWF on Haddonfield all using Balanced Landing and toolboxes. Tell me how many downs the killer gets before you finish all generators in 3 minutes.
---
Without capitalizing the F it looks like you're talking about two men. One named Bruce and one named Campbell XD
---
are u one of those people that really get mad over how people spell shit on the internet?
---
It might not need a nerf, but it could use some adressing. Now that decisive strike has a rework, adrenaline is the most irritating perk to go against as a killer. I can't count the games where I had 3 people injured, one guy on hook. Chasing an injured survivor and suddenly last generator done. Everyone goes into healthy state, survivor I was chasing gets away, I make my way back to the hook, guy gets off, adrenaline activates so no one injured and since I eon't use NOED the match is over. It might not be OP, but it sure as hell doesn't feel that way when you play killer. And it is OP against freddy. Sprint boost, health state AND waking up? I can't believe it still wakes you up
---
He’s a comedic hero in a Horror universe.
---
Personally I would’ve liked something from the reboot.
---
Join the killers club and play Myers. 
---
Do you think that's where pig gets the bear traps to make her traps... and trapper just keeps getting mad his traps are disappearing.
---
So no Evil Ash for killer. I like this, but I want more from Evil Dead :) 
---
Haha same thats why sometimes I'll do it during a chase. Its kind of silly, but I'll legit say in my head like "No! You stop it!" While I'm pointing at them after a pallet throw. That's why I'm glad no one takes it as being toxic, because I'm legit just being goofy and having fun with it.
---
not sure what the down-votes are for, that's literally how you counter spirit fury but whatever
---
yeah tell me about it. A lot of the time the stuff that gets thrust into shitstorms is the seemingly innocuous stuff. 
---
Original comment will be: "Oh jeez I am so excited for the chapter!" 
---
55 comments later: "I have never said I was a communist but I do think socialism could fit well into some aspects of society." 
---
He does but the other survivors got cosmetics based on other L4D characters
---
Sweet. More bugs. Can't wait.
---
Wow, going to have to. Seems to be really popular!
---
At first I was like, "Ah Netflix shamelessly promoting some new content". Glad to hear it is a classic in its own right.
---
Any specific tiles you have trouble looping? Or just looking for general tips? 
---
Where did you get the April 2nd release date from?
---
They could always update the characters like they do in league, with just vocal updates. I think it would work, I'm sure some people would hate certain characters being vocal, but maybe they dont all have to be!  
---
Yeah and somebody puts a farm offering or some other shit Myers map. I'll just close the application at that point. 
---
what are his perks? how much money?
---
HOW CAN I SPEED UP TIME?!?!
---
Yeah, bot only did he not know that the killer always sees entity spikes at the gates, but he didnt know what the perk icon looked like, and was of the opinion that it was just a crutch perk for extending the game.
---
You: "lots of people main Legion"
---
Me: "yeah... Lots of cunts".
---
Will this cost anything?
---
Ow my feelings 
---
If a survivor is a good looper and is running you too long abandon the chase and go apply pressure elsewhere. Its rare to see a team where all 4 are good runners. Find the weak link and play of their confidence and altruism.
---
A killer who doesn't know when to break a chase and cut the loss just isn't a good killer.
---
We already have the horse, the one that scares me more than a T1 daddy myers
---
What mask? 
---
The perks can eventually be gotten with Shards, as can non-licensed DLC, but licensed characters won't be able to be paid for with Shards IIRC.
---
Groovy
---
Snif snif is this survivor entitlement i'm smelling here?
---
Learn to loop jungle gyms (usually two L or T walls with windows on each), and also recognize which way the killer is running.  If the killer runs along the outside of the jungle gyms, he's doing it wrong, all you have to do is go to the other L/T wall and hop through the window or run around it, honestly if the killer runs it wrong you have plenty of options.  If he runs it correctly, meaning he runs along the inside of the jungle gym then you continue to run to the other window.  The killer running the right way does not shut down most jungle gyms, but it greatly shortens the usage of the jungle gym.
---
Also loop as tightly as possible, as sweaty as it sounds, especially around walls, you can gain distance meaning the difference wether you get hit or not, and you can sometimes dodge killer hitboxes.
---
Tiers based on default killer with no addons.

S: Nurse

He needs an unhooking/wiggle perk, something which makes use of his hand
---
Just wait till you see his boomstick. I'll see myself out.
---
Adrenaline and noed are counterparts to each other, both are very strong endgame perks and should stay the way they are. To have that strength, the killer/survivor gives up a perk slot for the whole game to get an endgame boost. 
---
Adrenaline is perfect as is because it gives a very strong boost to a survivor who specifically is in a Chase when the last gen pops. It also gives a boost to injured/hooked survivors. The strict activation, and requirements to give a noticeable boost, are enough to keep it balanced.
---
Noed is frustrating, but the killer has a huge endgame strength perk in exchange for it being counterable, unlike adrenaline which can't be countered. The killer's he perk should be able to give a big advantage as killers are in the power role. 4 adrenalines going off are just as frustrating as noed
---
Groovy baby
---
Its pretty bad right now. I'm having to switch over to killer just so people can get a game 
---
Yeah they used a legal workaround that I think is called "small penis defense" were you make a description or likeness with a undiserable feature so that no one would want to claim the likeness. Had they made him attractive even if it doesnt look like him he could still try to claim it. 
---
Guys you don’t need a cross hair... Do yourself a favor and practice without it. It becomes muscle memory and you will be able to make insanely accurate throws eventually.
---
When about to throw, look at the bottom of the handle on your screen. About 2-3 inches to the right and very slightly downwards is the crosshair. It’s vague but she always throws from the same spot.
---
Can finally chainsaw the Killer back 10/10
---
Literally the same person 
---
Nope, I was actually building up on your joke. Like saying Shirtless Clown &gt; Jane
---
I think that’s because he cusses at the end of the video
---
So whos the villian evil Ash?
---
Shut up
---
Might be sarcasm, but in case it isn't:
---
Yeah sure, don't commit to any chases, just protect the gens. Don't bother hooking people because they could do gens.
---
Also obviously can't protect gens after they are all done... I mean I can, but thats not smart at all
---
No need
---
Centred around one specific perk. yes if you have earned a free escape, why not use it. Struggling was removed for 'time-wasting' before deliverance came out. It just makes sense.The likelyhood is in this scenario you will still get caught - but this game is all about the small chances of pulling off something great. You don't deserve an extra chance to escape - you should have it by default- that is the perk. It does not say "unless you are the last one left".
---
As for DS - again, I didn't bring it up and am not using it in my argument, I was just saying it would still apply. Someone basically countered your argument of "but the killer will just kill you anyway so you are wrong". It is not a reason to be able to escape. It is a reason that you have a chance of surviving if you were to escape.
---
Immune to flashlights. And power is summon up a horse run around the map and jump pallets. No good with windows. Can attack on horse. Done.
---
Print it.  I approve
---
Username doesn’t check out?
---
Haha then the joke went over my head. Which just makes it even more funny. Well played.
---
Honestly I read your comment as you pointing out what the post was about.
---
Think its time for a nap haha.
---
Not really :/ I said I know killers wont always respect it but it's nice when they give you a headstart at the least but I mean take it as you will
---
I didnt watch the movie and i dont understand lol , guess im staying in my locker then 
---
Make your own game with a similar gameplay but different aesthetics and lore. There are countless FPS games why can’t there be more hide and seek/escape games?
---
I usually give the hatch to the last survivor but I always try to carry them to a hook and smack it first. 
---
It really gets across the message:
---
"Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not anymore."
---
I don't even like Saw. It's more of a "ESTABLISH DOMINANCE" thing.
---
They already have it. Skill checks.
---
I doubt you went around and asked 60 people that question and even if you did far more people want Ash add then people who don't 60 people isn't anywhere near the majority 
---
I’ve been seeing all these posts about matchmaking issues but I haven’t had any issues as killer 
---
I do think Adrenaline is a stupid perk - OP or not is harder to say. "Hey look, it's a close game! The killer's applying so much pressure, but that last gen's gonna pop any second. Both sides must be sweating over this one, folks - it's going to come down to the wire! Who knows how many of the survivors are making it out ali- and now they're all healed. Huh. Well, I thought this was going to be an exciting endgame, but turns out it was a great big fucking nothing. Silly me."
---
It would make a hell of a lot more sense if the killer's pressure (or lack thereof) persisted into the endgame, so that the killer was rewarded (or punished) for how well they were playing in the late midgame. But adrenaline lets survivors negate a killer's successful momentum and NOED lets the killer negate their own stalled momentum. They're like the blue shells of DBD.
---
And I *do* think NOED deserves to stay if adrenaline does (even if I'll never run it because fuck that perk). They're both endgame "fuck you's" to the other side. Add a totem counter and increase the BP reward for cleansing dull totems so solo survivors don't have such a difficult time with it and call it a day.
---
Ash is known for having a chainsaw arm and a shotgun as Evil Dead is more of an action genre than a horror genre.
---
To be honest, no matter the reason for licensed DLC, it's nice to be able to play as what might be your favourite character from a movie. Ash is from a cult classic movie, so there's gonna be alot of people excited about this.
---
To me, I'm just happy that we get a nice little addition to the survivor roster, that being someone who's such an icon in 80's horror. (And for once, not a killer themselves)
---
Indeed. 
---
Groovy.
---
It's all about intent
---
no problem! i watch her from time to time, and follow her art a bit too!
---
I Have a DaILy! Shiiiiit-runs-
---
Cant wait to see his perks! 
---
Thats nice if he has a shotgun and chainsaw in game tho 
---
I WANT A SPIRIT AND WRAITH ONES!
---
Same. I mean...I will hoard for Ash. But I was two seconds away from P3ing Jane as well!
---
"Goodluck everyone else" clenses knowing its haunted grounds
---
&gt;What does a Killer do?
---
Lose.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
That’s a separate department of people. There is no “they” in what you’re talking about. 
---
It's a mix of shitty teammates and aids killers.
---
Fault... Vault... Vaulting Killers! So it's still the Legion's fault.
---
Yep, I even gave up my 4th BBQ stack to let them hatch my last game. Figured I never found them all game...they earned it. Of course, they could have spent all game in a locker for all I know and didn't earn shit!
---
On the other hand, I don't ever expect it when I'm last survivor alive.  Especially with the new ranking system, if they actually want to rank up, they probably need to kill me. I'm usually just happy to get a complete game without some DCs or dying too fast.
---
And here we go with this ''just a game'' shit. I'm not salty, i just informed you it's our (the killers) job to kill you, not play tag with you, because you seem surprised why we won't let you escape.
---
He has a shotgun holster, which is more than I expected. 
---
There’s a disconnect sound?
---
I don't think the exit lever can be infected.
---
I was going to reply the same thing but was trying to wait til I had more time to find good sources to share; usually people will try to argue with me when I explain that 
---
Identity V is exactly what you're describing, but good luck getting phones that can play it.
---
I think you should invest in therapy asap, whether or not you're trolling. You're leaving spaghetti all over the place.
---
D.va
---
Ew
---
Perfect for Lery's /s
---
Fuck if I know, I didn’t add it. As soon as it was posted it showed up.
---
The link he posted.
---
The main house on Ormond has a big problem, occasionally when a survivor loops it and hug the walls very tightly, the survivor will be stuck on the killers screen just standing there looking at a wall
---
Just be a Bloodlust Gamer, 4head. 
---
Yeah, it’s a licensed character so it will definitely cost money. Especially because now (as of the most recent time my friend looked and told me, which was about a week ago) you can no longer buy licensed characters with the shards, and you have to buy them with accuric cells or with a direct money payment.
---
They probably never played killer to see what it looks like. 
---
Same, i just enjoy being a fast stabby boi
---
First Kate was quaking and now Jane is
---
Ok maybe not the best for all maps... 
---
but still fast as fuck boi
---
So would vomiting and Franklin's be a good combo then?
---
That'd certainly be interesting. Not that i've seen the movies or show that Ash is from.
---
No one likes immersed survivors. It's a synonym for shitty player.
---
The fuck is a nendroid? 
---
I’d rather be cute too tbh. I’m not into immersion at all (unless we are talking literally immersing myself in the long grass). I’m just a stealth player so I don’t wear the cute outfits :( 
---
hard choice between susie and amanda
---
I'd say it would be a good combo as survivors 99% of the time go back to find their item
---
This is so dumb but I really like it.
---
I like the new rank system and seem to just hover around 6-8. I like giving the hatch. No reason to rank up for me. 
---
That would fall under the “mocking/devaluing” part of the definition in regards to people posting “old news.” I’m using it correctly.
---
I think they said that was a bug and will be fixed.
---
if Ash doesn’t have his boom stick im throwin a fit.
---
There is no Killer coming with Ash: https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1111279993886310400
---
Penis
---
Sometimes people don’t understand what an entire company of people is like and confuse departments wholly unrelated to one another with each other. The funniest is people who complain about gameplay bugs when we get new cosmetics. “Why are they focusing on this?” Like.....the art team doesn’t know how to fix the games spaghetti code, 4head. 
---
Even if you're seconds away from the struggle you're taking away a good chunk of that phase by doing that and leaving your teammates even less time. I've died plenty of times with another survivor just a few meters away from me because I was stupid enough to try to go for the 4% in that situation. Whatever the case is, why should the killer take responsibility for that? This is how BHVR desgined the game, by not letting survivors know what the others are doing. Sometimes you expect a teammate to go for the save, sometimes you go for it. Sometimes it's an incredible waste of time because all of you go for it and no one does gens, sometimes nobody does... yadda yadda yadda. You have to understand that most of the time people don't do that out of malice, they're just random players trying to play the game. If you want a SWAT team then SWF, if you solo queue then don't bitch when random things happen because most likely the other survivors will have the same map information as you, which is next to nothing. But yeah, like I said, the killer shouldn't take responsibility. After all, they're playing to win, not to babysit you when you get "bad" teammates.
---
I mean... If you wanna think that people let you die on the hook on purpose and that the whole playerbase is just there to fuck with you then by all means, do that. But most people are just casual players playing a game to have fun. Maybe actually take a break and play some Civ... you know.
---
Fix this bugged out mess of a game or don't expect my money!
---
Nice.
---
He’s already pretty fast though. I mean I don’t see anything wrong with this but I think if you made it go even faster you might go so fast that you won’t be able to see survivors that you run past 
---
I wish we could interact with the horse though
---
The lockers were recently changed, Distortion is the from second most recent DLC, and your disdain for survivors has nothing to do with how this perk functions.
---
BUT REDDIT TOLD ME TO BREAK CHASE AND HIDE
---
\*pterodactyl screeching\*
---
i'm sure this post will be drowned out by the people excited about ash 
---
All according to plan-Behvr
---
Looping isn't hard to learn the basics.  Honestly every survivor needs to learn how to handle themselves in a chase otherwise it's kind of like playing a 3 man 5 gen game everytime for the other survivors.
---
Yeah... but fast as fuck boi Billy &gt; The Flash
---
Or maybe they made the dlc to fund them while they keep working on the problem. Just a thought. 
---
main house has an interior problem, I think some of the hitboxes on newer objects bugged. Occasionally when a survivor loops it and hugs certain walls/objects very tightly, the survivor will appear stuck on everyone but the survivors screen
---
I cant imagine unironically playing like that. It’d have to be so boring.
---
Mean spirited but admirable. 
---
damn i was ready to call you out on that but you did it yourself. 
---
i like your name though
---
This becomes an issue if you play on a television set and you play on a screen that is more than 3-5 feet. You can’t expect everyone to get a feel especially when the screen is huge and you need to needle thread especially when it’s corn and you can’t see anything.
---
I haven’t been paying attention to the leaks so I don’t .. think.. so...But every chapters had that so far so maybe? I think he’s more a stand alone with the “entity” as the villain but who knows that’s just pure speculation on my part. It would seem premature after the plagues release to drop another killer but god only knows.
---
Yeah like I said, it's super rare, but some people are just sociopaths I guess
---
Last night I was only able to find 2 games in an hour after waiting in queue.  It got so bad after this update.
---
You never could buy them with shards
---
Thanks man &lt;3
---
I dont understand people like you who ABHOR this game but continue to play and and keep up to date. There's a difference between constructive criticism and just being a asshole and hating/ripping on the devs decision to make ash a survivor.
---
I swear to god if this is an April fools prank...
---
I mean, it's pretty different from the asylum. It feels distinct. And I don't really mind that they put some in the same realm. There's like, 5 coldwind farms and 5 autohave wreckers, don't see why we can't fill out some of the newer realms so that we get more variety than 50% Coldwind.
---
it was fun but even more broken and unbalanced than dbd 
---
Making DBD a free to play game could solve this problem. The profit for Behaviour would come by DLCs and cosmetics (auric cells).
---
After the rank change people just stopped giving a shit. Everybody knows it's almost impossible to get banned and the unreal pip requirements dont really help.
---
60 children who don't watch classic horror obviously aren't going to know Jack about anything, even if they did actually respond (which I bet most didn't).
---
Oh, okay. Thank you for correcting me, I was just under that assumption. I’ve just always bought the characters with money, and I haven’t messed with the in-game currency to do so.
---
Ash is so OP he blinds me before he's released.
---
Same I just the shards for cosmetics and I buy dlc when it is on sale on steam
---
*You dont get stunned when bumping in objects.
---
* Tremendrously increase the chainsaw cooldown.
---
God damnit. Is this legit? Do I have to reinstall to suffer again? 
---
How is a explanation hate? 
---
This would be dope in any form. You have my vote
---
No, they said there's a new system where you get matched with people from your region
---
While that'd be great for a couple of games, it'd get old real fast. I can't imagine BHVR would record very many, and hearing the same 5 lines over, and over would get grating.
---
xD xD XD XDDDDDDDDDDD
---
April fools?
---
When
---
I get a little frustrated with slugging if it’s done early on in the game. Not because it makes the killer win, but because staying on the floor isn’t really the most fun you can have in this game.
---
I personally slug when I play killer but only during the critical times where there’s two or one gen(s) left.
---
Bullshit DLC. Ash is literally a boss killer and he will be in a game where all he does is running and escaping someone that he will DESTROY otherwise.
---
Paragraph. Just a Survivor I think. Too early of a release for both a Killer and a Survivor.
---
Video does not have a date.
---
make him the actual horseman from the sleepy hollow series. flashlights incapacitate him because light is a weakness to him so flash light saving is very easy against him. but he has an extremely strong area of effect power
---
I agree; I don’t think Laurie looks that bad, all things considered. Quentin is a fucking monstrosity though.
---
How does no one realize this is ironic. 
---
Another survivor can ruin your game absolutely. I just finished a game and another survivor was mad at me for pointing at him, I was just trying to ask him for a heal, and he spent the rest of the game following me and blocking me all because I pointed at him. It was literally the worst game I had ever played.
---
Killers aren’t the problem, it’s toxic, self absorbed Survivors that are the problem.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/54397/matchmaking-update/p1?new=1
---
PLEASE u/Korbrm at least tell me Ash says "Groovy!" FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
---
We going the PAYDAY route bois
---
Lol amen dude. I’m fairly new to the game, maybe a month in and have been trying both sides. One thing I’ve noticed playing Killer is that survivors seem to have these strange rules that they made up and you have abide by or they freak the fuck out after the game. This hook thing for example or having to give the last survivor the hatch... Uh those aren’t real and the whole point of Killer is to kill you????????? 
---
Well pig is human, and cannot be done cause she's a licensed killer from SAW
---
Oh god this is actually good 
---
looks like it's kind of like a Funko Pop figure.
---
then it only gets disconnected for a few seconds so you get called a lagswitcher. ez
---
Since the recent emblem change, SURVIVORS are the best killers in the game. Even if everyone isnt stealthing around, most of them in purple ranks are so goddamn greedy for altruism they just camp hooks and zero gens are getting done. Next, you get unhooked in front of the killer and tunneled lol
---
Kind of disappointed that you're the only one who can read post tags. Disappointed, but not surprised.
---
honestly op is gonna get banned for exploiting just for presenting an idea. unlucky
---
serious talk now, i like the idea but as other people have suggested, discounts and other gimmicks would be nice
---
Imagine if you healed faster while downed than anyone else would while injured  
---
this post was made by unbreakable tenacious dead harders
---
Will his map be Jacksonville Florida?
---
It is abysmal. The worst, absolute fucking WORST. Is the fucking arbitrary timer to find a fucking game. Just fuck off with that shit. Give me my instant killer lobbies and 20 seconds to find a game. They just fixed it, and now it's back to shit. Fucking tiring as fuck.
---
Basically my team every time i play solo survivor.
---
Tea Time!
---
*tea bags furiously*
---
&gt;2 
---
i want updated character models and VO's with emotes to say come, go, this way and hide' or something
---
Last thing first, Distortion doesn't need a buff and it is laughable to hear you say it does. There are plenty of ways to hide your aura so you don't use a token. I play survivor (only) at high ranks and you can still mind game the killer. Quit being so predictable with your gameplay and the killer won't be any wiser. 
---
P.S. Survivors working with the killer should serve some amount of time banned from the game but I can guarantee survivors don't give others away in red ranks unless you sandbag them first
---
Whe should have a crosshair as default on Huntress, Clown and Nurse.
---
I wonder if the blue blindness means something? 
---
Become a Wraith or Myers main and i can be your guide. Not trying to recruit or anything 
---
Tbh I wouldn't even get mad at that :D I'd just be hoping to run into four toxic Ashs all the time. 
---
I guess I’m just extra queazy. When it happened to me, I was hoping for a lantern bash, but she just puked all over my character and directly in the mouth that I just immediately gagged while watching it
---
Wait now. If i queue as a killer the lobby doesn't pop up instantly like it should? Or did i understand this wrong
---
Honestly with how big a grind this game has any change would be nice.
---
I actually really enjoy playing michael lol I love michael so much honestly he’s my baby but I also love my spirit I’ll never main the wraith Or even think of touching him but if you wanna help with perks for michael go ahead I’m all ears. 
---
Ah, the dreaded neutral pip. 
---
Same, I’m finding games surprisingly fast with 3-man swf
---
I can’t wait to go.  My shift needs to end now.
---
How about some after-game voice lines? A few recorded lines about him surviving the trial, or getting killed and being sent back to the campfire? 
---
I mean, I’m only 17 and I absolutely adore The Evil Dead franchise and Bruce.
---
Such innocence.. It has been almost 3 years and there's still NO REWARDS for reaching the high ranks. Even when it was asked for shortly after release, when people got there. 
---
The developers have been called "Gods of Band-aids" because their preferred "fixing" strategy is to put a plaster on a large crack. 
---
Go do a different gen and quit rushing things, seriously. If you think the killer is going to know which gen you're on after his bbq is gone, go somewhere else. Maybe wait til the killer checks your gen and go back after. I said 'switch directions' not 'be a bot'
---
I see you've remembered to include the Lord of THICCness, Chorizos and Nutella into your post.. very good. 
---
I’ve had way too many camp killers that I’m too scared to get chased 
---
Lol. that kickstarter was a long shitshow x3
---
Glad I didn't pull that trigger and back it. 
---
Like Leatherface and Bill, Ash will be coming to DbD alone.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/s5SHioa](https://imgur.com/a/s5SHioa)  couldn't help but see the similarities with another clown...
---
I don’t understand this (as a survivor main) it just increases my chance of being caught if I stay there 
---
I’ve been waiting five minutes at times to make a lobby
---
Awesome... getting it day 1
---
1) any news who the killer counterpart is?
---
2) will it come out on xbox same day?
---
IMO it should just be based on connection instead of region. I loved facing people from NA because some of them would still have decent ping and it was more variety. Separation by ping instead of just by geolocation would IMO make the experience a lot better.
---
Then again I assume that isn't as easy to make as it sounds. 
---
Can someone explain why this is every other post now?
---
That's what we said about Freddy 😔
---
Most survivors are hypocritical shits, mainly.
---
Myself included.
---
dude the plague just came out
---
Region locked games only benefit Americans it fucks everyone else. 
---
Well, if you aren't playing now, and you're just here because you don't like how this character is being handled, then I'd say he's right to think you're overreacting.
---
Ashley just might replace my flair.
---
She’ll probably coby and escape. 
---
At lower ranks people straight up DC when they find out it’s Legion, yet people are fine with nurse because she takes skill. I don’t mind others but find the difference in community feelings strange
---
I know it makes me super basic, but I love non-prestiged Default Dwight the best. 
---
Occasionally I'll swap out his head for the bruised one from the Leatherface DLC (I *always* have that head cosmetic equipped if I run No Mither on Dwight), but otherwise I usually just play Default Dwight.
---
Yes. The leaks came from ps4 kyf
---
That’s why I call it a 1v4 as in one survivor vs a killer and 3 survivors. Your goal is to survive. It’s why I leave other survivors when it puts me at risk.
---
If anyone jumps off in front of me you have 2 seconds to live because of the invisibility. 
---
Hahahaha a person who doesnt the play fhe game wants it shut down but doesnt even know what it is liketo play....makes a lot of sense. play the game first before u give criticism...do you give a product a rating before you condemn it? No you play/use it before giving it rating
---
What’s an aids killer? Sounds insensitive AF. 
---
Forever bitter about classic Freddy (and Nancy)
---
I'm still on the fence about Plague. I want to like her but I got mine to level 50 and I've been bullied by survivors in almost every game I've played with her so far.
---
Is it gonna be like Bill or a new dlc
---
Okay so how do I go from a 15 second wait time max and get all rank 17 to 14 then they do the update to match making and everything goes to hell.  It was fine until the update 
---
I'm just confused as to why they didn't grab Evil Dead Ash, and give him his Evil Dead 2 look, minus the missing hand.
---
Either way, cool IP to score, and he's got some neat perks.
---
That's a funny way to spell "birdbox challenge"
---
Dweard. Dweard is the one and only head. Other than that I like the pizza delivery guy or the store manager outfit. The Hallowed Dwight is also really awesome. 
---
So you despise bbq and chili? It’s not like you have to play a single game as lf to unlock the teachable.
---
Happy early birthday
---
Just Ash
---
Thanks! :)
---
Tbh the last person you should be asking for is a psychologist in DBD, Herman isn’t the most stable of people..
---
Like Leatherface no map probably

They probably don’t even have a script, all the other characters were voiced by the devs themselves
---
Action? nah man. evil dead and the remake are pretty clear cut horror films, evil dead 2 is horror comedy, same with army of darkness, although that one probably has more actiony shit.
---
It's funny how devs are saying it's all about the mindgames yet we have those walls in the game
---
That’s a bit different since he’s not based on a real person as far as I know. Then again I always forget Bill exists because I play on PS4.
---
Helmet, Bahroo shirt, shorts is a very special outfit 
---
But that mention of “Language” could refer to the survivor quotes you see on the bottom of perks, or anything like that. Do any of those have suggestive language? Like “ass” or whatever
---

---
In all seriousness the main reason matchmaking is horrible is that there are few R1 survivors - it’s almost impossible under the mew system without way too much time and luck 
---
I'm a brutal and unforgiving killer.... I have a hard enough time killing people without giving them an extra chance. I love when you can sense the survivors salt, when they sit there tea bagging like they're trying to tell you something. I find it funny especially if they like to run distraction on you than expect mercy(welcome to the hook hahaha) I get an extra kick out of killing a survivor who's been smacking me with pallets and/or tryin to shine flashlights in my face. Like if they want to trade places on the hook with their noob buddy at the end of the match I am more than happy to accomodate. 
---
That being said I have fun as the killer. It's all about a good attitude and killing at your own pace. I don't care who gets away I just try to kill at least one but usually end up with more. I had a whole lobby escape me last night that even broke my totems for NOEA and I was honestly more impressed than anything. 
---
Not really, it looks even more like Glover than it does game Tapp lol
---
Maps a permanent dodge / DC for me because BBQ basically isnt a perk and generators arent real.
---
While the game was alive, it worked for Gun Media and Friday the 13th as well. The game has had problems since day 1, become an absolute mess, and while DBD isn't nearly as messed up, new content seems to have everyone bending over for the devs and forgetting all the issues. Guarantee a week or so after his release everybody will going back to wanting to hunt down BHVR. 
---
I REALLY HATE THE WAY RUIN IS BASICALLY REQUIRED TO BE A SUCCESSFUL KILLER IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHEESE LIKE A POTATO BUT AT THE SAME TIME SURVIVORS HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT IN LIKE 90% OF MATCHES.
---
IT SUCKS GOING BOTH WAYS, THAT'S FOR SURE
---
Who the fuck wants to just look behind rocks and trees whole game, lol
---
Freddy was a pretty good fighter though.
---
OG was able to beat Jason pretty bad, it took a home town advantage AND the teens intervening constantly for Jason to get the upper hand, and even then it was close.
---
In the remake, Freddy beat the **** out of Quentin and almost killed him had it not been for Nancy surprising him
---
Honestly it's hit or miss when the other survivor is injured. When the other survivor is on hook, or downed and you stand beside/on-top of them it's a guaranteed stack. But when you try to take a hit, unless you're touching them it's all luck tbh
---
idk  forum killers  i guess? 
---
I was actually curious to see the new scratch marks after the patch, then this happens
---
Damn. My sympathies.
---
 VERY TRUE! HOPEFULLY IT WILL GET BETTER NOT GIVING UP YET! ALSO WHERE ARE YOUR CAPS LOCK MOTHER FUCKER! LOL
---
Put a pumpkin on his head, problem solved. 
---
If you play on console they're already in the game lol
---
I don't think he'll be available for shards anyways, since he's licensed. Just grind up them bp's and 7(?) bucks and you're good to go
---
Should’ve put Quentin in the van 
---
Also sound is fucked and so are scratch marks.
---
It was a glitch, you could even equip killer perks on survivors
---
Plague
---
It can't be worse than inside the house on Yamaoka, right?
---
That's sad
---
Sorry, I meant shards to buy teachables from the shrine for more BP lol. I hoard hard for new content. 
---
He is basically the main hero of horror. He has been in 3 movies a show. He has aslo been various comics where he fights horror monsters such as jason, freddy and marvel zombies.
---
Came here to say this lol
---
Its like inside the house but for the entire map
---
Its getting tough tbh I played 5 games today and 2 of them the killer quit in the beginning and on other 2 a survivor killed himself on the first hook. Its a pain in the ass
---
Strong sexual noises while rubbing a totem! 
---
I was hoping more people had watched the show
---
Sorry I thought you were in the "survivors have too much power" camp and didn't really read your other comment thoroughly when i wrote
---
Yeah i agree; don't waste your time chasing survivors on nasty tiles
---
I mean the perk literally does nothing, it should at least give the damn stacks.
---
Ayyyyy
---
Yeah I knida wish the game was more like the Friday the thirteenth game where you could actually fight back and even kill jason if you where coordinated enough.
---
&gt; because not only did the devs say we would no longer be getting licensed killers
---
Can you get a source for that? I don't recall them saying something to that extent, though I *do* recall them saying we wouldn't receive one for a while.
---
The last licensed chapter was over a year ago, it's not a big deal.
---
and technically, we aren't getting a licensed killer, we're getting a licensed survivor :).
---
I just re-watched them with my kid in preparation for watching the show. They're dated, show's better. Not that the movies are bad, just the show is better. Better graphics in particular.
---
Yeah and the cabin in the woods as a map
---
i cant get out of rank 13 even know ive hit one easily because everyone dcs i get a 3 man where people kill themselfs instantly its a pian
---
Imo, it should be changed to "gain a 25% bonus for any altruistic action" this way there's less hook farmers. Encourages healing and other less selfish play 
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS NOT JUST FUCKING ESCAPE, WHY DO I HAVE TO CHASE THEM OUT OF THE GATE WHEN THE GAME IS ALREADY OVER AND THEY'VE WON
---
It looks really good, I'd love me a hag one. It's a shame they'll probably be very expensive (and I've got no money)
---
Racist 
---
Yes
---
The city so nice they named it... Jacksonville!
---
Last I checked, you don't announce April Fools jokes days beforehand.
---
You excited to play on 15 fps and PS2 graphics?
---
Exactly. 
---
I mean, the players have a pattern of slugging in my experience, so it's kind of deserved on the killer's end. 
---
*ridiculous
---
I’ve heard it from multiple sources, specifically from people who stream or record their own gameplay. I didn’t start following the Devs on anything except YouTube because I didn’t know what it was, so my information is not directly coming from them. However I guess I made a false assumption of that is the case, as I figured I could trust the people who play the game for a living. But if I’m wrong I’m wrong 🤷‍♀️
---
Nurse is basically part of the og killers huntress less so
---
I CAN STOP WRITTING IN CAPS ? IT'S ALREADY THURSDAY.
---
"welcome to my world bitch", after a D strike Lol. 
---
Exploiting a game design is, first offense is 24 hour ban
---
You're actually not too far off! For effort sounds, scripts usually look something like:  
---
&gt;5 jumping sounds  
---
9 screams like you're being stabbed through the chest  
---
10 screams like you're falling   
---
13 screams like you're getting stabbed in the dick
---
etc
---
Survivors are why I play killer. I solo que alot because I rotate killer and survivor. And it can be ridiculous. If you really want a show, run bond. While your doing a gen youll see them crouching around hiding behind rocks and trees while the killer is off chasing someone across the map. 
---
I feel like a single mother and legit only getting cauggt out by killer because no one else is doing gens. The one game that pissed me off the most was where I did 4/5gens that game. I even FINISHED the last gen. The killer found me and I looped him around the entire map. He wasnt hard to loop but eventually I ran out of pallets and was able to check both gates more than once and moved him away from gate so other person could open them. The other person never opened a gate. They waited on hatch long enough to get crows.
---
They'd have to do something from tracking for both killer and survivor as the dolls in a cornfield would be a goddamn nightmare.
---
Why not just tape a cheerio to the screen? I think that works the best
---
I need one of every killer since I play them all
---
Doesn't seem like a lot of people are thinking that this could be an April Fool's joke given the timing. Would be cool if it isn't but still the date is pretty suspect  along with the fact that there are no voice lines in game.
---
It was someone’s job to model this...
---
I know we don’t really get survivor lore, but I like the idea of Ash hanging out with Laurie. Ash also goes from flight to fight like Laurie does when she gets old. 
---
It’s four friends who called their “gang” the legion. 
---
If the new Ash survivor doesn't have some snappy one-liners, I'm having a hard time seeing the point of all this.
---

LOL Jane already talk. Sometimes, when she gets injured, she says : "Oh, dammit".
---
4K's are ez to get tho
---
Insert “JokeOverYourHeaf.meme”
---
False, they choose not to talk.
---
Imagine, "THIS is my boomstick!"
---
After finding a purple flashlight
---
I thought they didn’t talk because the entity suppressed them.

---
The Entity adjusted Freddy's powers, a killer who's prwtty much a literal god in the films. I'm sure it'll have no problem taking a chainsaw and a gun from an older, kinda chubby human. 
---
ahh Whoosh
---
I play with two friends so there are 3 of us and the other night we waited over 2 fucking hours for a lobby only for the killer to see us all pop up together then ditch. We got off after that.
---
Would've been cool
---
In my experience, i don’t spend 90% of a nurse game healing/mending myself or others. Most legion games i max altruism after like 1 gen is done. The ruin/sloppy butcher/thanatophobia/nurse’s build is a bloodbath where you can’t do gens and almost every legion runs it. 
---

On PS4, killer lobbies feel fine. 
---
Don't see what's so difficult about it. Make the hood part of the body; a chest piece. And the head will just be the hair like for everything else. Hoods are a part of jackets and therefore would be part of the chest piece. 
---
*stuns killer* groovy~
---
Hey now, he's got *SOME* nice qualities.
---
I use monitor, Ruin, bbq, and nurses on her.
---
When he gets hooked "what the fuck?"
---
Your comment also didn't add much, all that got added was a downvote, but even then, it replaced the upvote the post had before so I wouldn't count it at adding.

They literally blocked the door so no one can walk in to go for the save.
---
Rank reset is the funniest times with killer. -downs someone. About 10ft behind me I hear the godpallet drop..... - um.. okay? Wasnt even near you, but thanks
---
Staple association with the game due to wild popularity and longevity and an interesting design. Spirit is new but if she maintains the popularity she seems to have she could be, much like huntress who after almost 2 years is pretty popular and loved:) 
---
It's like a post thing because any noise could alert the killer.
---
I feel like survivors should do at least the equivalent of 2 gens before hatch opens if they're last survivor.like put in the work instead of hiding the whole game and getting hatch 
---
EMEA = Europe, the Middle East and Africa
---
APAC = Asia-Pacific
---
Is it confirmed April 2 ?
---
The points u gain or lose on rank system
---
I gotta get this one and I want one for Doctor
---
There are times as killer that I just dont even know what just happened. I spawn in.. and its just a slew of bodies and im like... I didnt even do anything to deserve this. Why yall just throwing yourselves at me, you okay?
---
Lol. If you don't know what the region abbreviation stands for then you likely aren't a part of it so it literally doesn't matter to you.
---
Tfw memes are accurate, matchmaking and ranking is so monumentally fucked up on PS4 right now
---
Can we talk about how it was made by a woman with the last name "Yamaoka"
---
Is it like a funkopop, but movable? 
---
But actually nobody's know what it is anymore, it's a legend to pip nowadays (in red ranks)
---
Mine will remain loyal to the best killer
---
Jane will distract me
---
Yeah I’ve been using ruin nurses monitor and haunted, i don’t have bbq yet ☹️
---
Artists last name is Yamaoka
---
Will he have an offensive weapon?
---
Vault and Lunge should be switched.
---
Most of the licensed characters come from series that could be argued to have become comedies at this point.  I can't think of one that didn't have at least one funny movie, whether intentional or not.
---
I'm on xbox and yeah. Either as survivor or killer I wait like 5 mins minimum. 
---
looking at that gauntlet if his, I assume he will xD
---
Red Dwight hat, red pizza shirt, watermelon pants. That’s what I use anyway
---
But this isn't chess.  It's supposed to be four players working together against one player who is meant to stop them.  If you break that you're breaking the core gameplay.
---
exactly can devs please fix it
---
n o
---
I care about camping especially when they just stand there and smack you over n over again it’s a pos thing to do. But I do agree that was ridiculous and far worse than normal camping.. with camping you can at least bait a hit then save and trade places with the hooked person but she was giving you no chance to even get down there. That’s sad.
---
They hated him because he told the truth
---
Exactly! Just the other day I was searching for a survivor near a wall by the L-wall things and I kid you not, the injured Kate who'd gotten unhooked all the way on the other side of the map had come to my area, come near the wall where I was, and literally ran face first into me. Like... what is going on, survivors, lol.
---
well i hope you find jane afterwards I need to see it
---
Ash main forever
---
I had a similar situation where a hillbilly with enduring AND spirit fury facecamped everybody, and claimed we were all exploiters because we looped him, and he said he camps every looper he downs. Funny because even as one of the strongest killers in the game, with insta saw and optimal ad ons, and even one person on the team just sabo-ing hooks the whole game and not doing gens, one guy still got away, and we very nearly got away. Most pathetic killer I've ever seen. (Rank 1 killer btw)
---
Let's hope. I wish offensive weapons were in the game, tbh.
---
No, because Ben Shapiro is full of shit and is reliably wrong on nearly every political and economic issue, and the guy getting downvote is correct. 
---
Is this some sort of pc joke that Im just to console to understand? 
---
-insert meme-
---
Not as much as these reposts. 
---
...that just ain't right
---
They aren't mocking the news, they're mocking the company for not acknowledging that everyone already knew. 
---
It’s probably just a survivor not a whole chapter 
---
Before any of that shit happens Amanda needs to say Game Over.
---
blessed image
---
For everything, so yes.
---
I'm hoping those icons mean we are getting four more killers and I am VERY much hoping at least one of them will be The Doctor. I always said his design is super apt for a statue like this. 
---
the cosmetics are the best part of this game especially freddy dwight 😔
---
ok thank u b
---
I damn near lost my shit when I saw this on discord. But I was too exhausted from moving to make a sound... BUT I AM HYPE ASF ON THE INSIDE BABY! WOOOOO! 
---
Pleaaaaaaaaaassssssssse let this man speak! It isn't Ash without his quips and sensual voice of a god. Shop smart... Shop s-mart. 
---
Ahaha, did you find that or did you make it!? I love it.  =D
---
Excellent shit post taste. Lol. 
---
don't bring politics into this.
---
He's from Evil Dead, definitely recommend if you like comedy/action/horror.  There probably won't be a villain since Ash isn't known for having one "villain".
---
Last one alive so no chance.
---
Working on a gen and in the distance you [hear this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUGUk2xzIo)
---
Technically if im trying to make him win you are trying to make him loose. A free for all or 1v1 doesnt matter the winner would probably never be the same twice. 
---
The evil dead cabin. 
---
Funny. I was wearing the Claudette mask in this game too just like your avatar or flair what ever the fuck that thing is called
---
Wow. I feel like they lowered the chances of getting out of those. 25% chance? Yeah right.
---
I got like 150k haha pretty damn nice, sry for late reply
---
im scared to find out what will be the better angle.
---
Oh u brutal 
---
You're welcome. I hope this pleases you
---
Ahaha, yes, that twinkle in his eyes as he puts you on on a meat hook. Nothing like it.  😅
---
That would have been typical
---
God that falling noise for Bill is so annoying.
---
I drop like 2 feet and you just hear **OOOooOoAauuAAuUuhhh!!!**
---
Lol
---
Correct, they said we wouldn't be getting a licensed dlc because they want to focus on original content/killers, then followed that up by saying that if they were approached and they felt the character would fit, then they wouldn't say no to licensed content.
---
You’re a fucking idiot
---
Adrenaline and sprint burst are pretty meta at the moment. 
---
Would have been expected with those servers tbh
---
Jokes on you. Survivor mains don’t learn lessons 
---
That would be a big deal but how often do you interupt people ? F you don't want to wait so long use add ons you can get it down to 3 I think. Either way freddy isn't hard to get 4k with just play him and get good with him. 
---
thank you for this information 😔
---
Yeah those moments are rememberable
---
Please don’t, save your money. They don’t deserve more sales anyway rn
---
MoM only triggers once, but a perk like Dead Hard can be used a number of times to extend chases. Maybe people don't like it because it triggers automatically instead of requiring skill to use?
---
Ofcourse
---
Ahh yes, shrink your game window as small as possible, that way the whole game fits in the center of your monitor, now you'll land every hatchet. 
---
I didn't actually expect him to actually have the Likeness, nor have the original actor lend his voice!  That's pretty groovy, and I guess I'll be a Survivor Main come April 2nd.
---
Oh didnt think of that
---
I am. 
---
bill is a license 
---
Hahah
---
What does that have to do with it possibly being an April Fool's joke though? 
---
I would have cried
---
Thats even rarer
---
But if they make it they would probably make it a perk 
---
Okay. What about balanced landing? Better that sprint burst?
---
deleting legion would mean they would have to delete jeff and i dont want my dad out of th game
---
You can't just make an April Fools joke using a licensed character, that can get you in legal shit.
---
Yeah I was really hoping to see Evil Ash or Henrietta as a Killer. With taunts at each other on the loading screen.
---
You can actually use his perks right now on Xbox &amp; PS4 right now play SWF.
---
Omg dude. I was in a game with 4 streamer survivors. Everyone of them live(watched the vods post game because narcissistic.) Anyways they called me every insult to killers in the book even claimed I lagswitched when none of them had lag... Only times there was lag and they couldnt throw down a pallet or jump a window was um.... after they got shocked &gt;.&gt;
---
And the guy who claimed I was tunneling him legit after being unhooked, stayed to be healed then sabo the hook. Giving me plenty of time to get back to him after HOOKING his teammate somewhere else. And watching the vods he was staying in my tr all game. I mean it was the game map as doctor but still I wasnt running tr extendors so he chose to stick around.
---
But the cherry on the cake.. they said I was tunneling streamers unironically.. um... how do I not if you all streaming? 
---
Lol what the hell is this comment
---
To be honest, was thinking more of a horse noise that would be creepy, not unlike they did in [LOTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L0A2D7zV7A)
---
Oh we can disagree but when you type out in all caps and ignore what I'm saying I'm going to call you a idiot because you are one. I'm not afraid of any perks but people like you will whine until everything is nerfed just shut the fuck up. 
---
You can actually use his perks right now on Xbox &amp; PS4 right now playing kill your friends.
---
yeahh i know im on ps4 aha
---
They also paired with steam that's why it was free. Bruce Campbell is not a partner of steam and neither is his show. So it might be like leatherface and be like five bucks at most
---
Are you saying this is a repost cause if so I would love to see who I took this from cause I definitely just took that picture
---
Same. It was the first time it was that bad for me.
---
Because I love looking fabulous 
---
Okay this is epic
---
Butterknife? Now how do you know the thickness and integrity of freddies blades? He been in your dreams?
---
I'm never satisfied if i won't get a 4k. I've always had a winning mentality since i was a kid. About that t-bagging flashlight clicking type of player. I had a match an hour ago where a Claudette ruined everyone else's game by throwing pallets on purpose and lifting in front of my face. Do you want me to tell you about the time we spent in the basement together with that person in question? I think not. Still ended up with a 4K and 3 gens left to fix. Dude was rank 7
---
r/softwaregore
---
You can use his perks right now on both PS4 &amp; XBOX in kill your friends.
---
This is Claudette where talking about 
---
someone really tried to convince me that bbq was a tunnel perk LMAO
---
I play killer 95% of the time but this survivor looks so badass imma have to buy him
---
If this game is so dogshit, why not bugger off?
---
Upvoted. You made me LOL at work.
---
*When you don't even edit the image to make it DBD related*
---
Hide behind generators, go into a locker, double back, get in the 40 m range
---
Entitled much
---
BBQ, Surveillance, Nurse’s, and Ruin/Make Your Choice. 
---
#DUMMY THICC
---
Exactly
---
quentin but im into daddies more so david or jeff. female wise meg or kate 😔
---
Knowing BHVR, even that won't come out as smoothly as you might think tbh
---
RIP this game, region separation in this kinda games never work well.
---
Yeah sure , if you just spend them without thinking.
---
But if you plan ahead then it's a very small chance.
---
I'm pretty sure it's harder to get a "666" bloodpoints that I had once than a 0.
---
We need a Huntress one!!!
---
This is a fair and good assessment, I’d say. 
---
I kind of dig the idea of an MVP label. Maybe it could reward just a raw 5000 BP post-game bonus? The only problem I foresee is assessing who that person is if people escape at various times and it could lead to people hanging around a match longer than needed (or maybe even leaving prematurely to secure an MVP). 
---
B A Z I N G A
---
I can't wait! 
---
Just put it where his head would be and make it invisible 
---
I just mean that freddy slashes, which isn't a deep wound. Nasty, but for someone as beefy as myers it wouldn't be immediately life threatening.
---
One basic thing that a game must have is for you to know the trajectory of your throwables. Think of a game like Apex, you can see the trajectory of where your grenade will go before you use it. That's why I mentioned the clown, thinking his bottle like a grenade. The nurse, what I meant to say was to make that add on, plaid flannel, a standard in her power.
---
Lol that doesn’t change anything in regards to how I was using the word, or the fact that it’s stupid to assume because people noticed they would all of a sudden change their release schedule and admit to anything prematurely, or being told I wasn’t using it correctly when I was, more so by someone who was acting the part of the definition in “defence” of me using it incorrectly.. which I wasn’t, with saying “they’re joking”... which no fucking shit they were, and because they’re trying to be pessimistically cynical towards already obvious knowledge.. made me use the word choice I did. Not to mention having it called a “fancy” word is crazy, sorry to say not everyone speaks at an 8th grade level and some of us actually use language like this in everyday life. Unlike other people I don’t downvote comments purely because I have such a huge ego that I assume the person choosing specific wording is wrong simply because I can’t grasp what they were meaning by it. 
---
Now if only Ash in the game would do fingerguns like Bruce did in the video. I feel like they had him do that shit to torture us. 
---
I dont get tilted by it. But I sure as hell not giving them hatch. 
---
There was a game I was doing a daily on a killer im bad with. Played normally, no camping tunneling barely hooked people. Then this lil shit kept tbagging me all game even at exit. I mean clearly I was struggling.
---
So I asked them about it and they apologized saying they had a bad day and it wasnt directed at me. 
---
&gt;Are you saying this is a repost cause if so I would love to see who I took this from cause I definitely just took that picture

Oh that’s smart
---
I saw a clip awhile back tru3 was being excessively teabagged. Guy lost his shit though talking about "STOP FUCKING TEABAGGING!" then separately he was like..."you get the camels hands"
---
On top of that they are actually trying things and not just making false promises.
---
Kudos BHVR, we all love you, even if some of us are rude from time to time.
---
Im keeping my expectation as low as possible haha
---
Pretty sure it has to be unlocked to all 4 of  my favourite killers after i have bought the teachable on LF at lvl
---
 30+ and i just spent 5 dollars on my least favourite killer? No thanks im good.
---
It would be cool if it was added as a core mechanic, maybe the killer and survivor can each have a perk to affect it, adding or subtracting the number of random offerings
---
Tbh i prefer Balanced Landing, but Sprint Burst is way more versatile. Balanced landing is still good for falls either way
---
Surveillance or Discordance is great on her because of her mobility. 
---
I also like Whispers as a personal preference. With Whispers and Surveillance (I certainly notice the sound buff it offers) you can whiz around the map and create a pretty tight gen loop, knowing exactly when to stop and search and when to move on.
---
To add to this, if a survivor is infected and they get into a locker they infect the locker, giving them away. 
---
It also works the other way. If a survivor is in a locker and you infect it, if its still infected when they leave they will get infected as well. 
---
Wow that’s cool!
---
In my experience though, the strange thing with DBD is that it was the most fun while I had *no* idea what was going on *whatsoever*, and it actually was scary with that certain mystery to it. When the horror aspect was not just the crumbling paint job of a game about optimizing your pathing and otherwise holding mouse 1 for extended periods of time while something pressing space.
---
I don't believe console has the playerbase necessary for this to be an overall benefit to the health of the game. I'm fine with having less red ping lobbies, but I'm not fine with waiting 10 minutes (or as the reality often is, more) for a game that's going to likely be one-sided anyway. I'd take a few questionable hits over long wait times any day.
---
Ok. So you don’t want to spend 5 bucks on bbq. Got it. 
---
The whole argument that you despise lf sooooo much that you don’t want to touch him even if it means you go forever with bbq still seems silly to be because the only interaction you’d have is dealing with his bloodweb.
---
I hadn't even thought about Surveillance. Top Kek 
---
I heard it from most of the content creators for the game(ex. Streamers, youtubers, you know), which is where a lot of my information about the game came from (except for the official YouTube) as I was unaware I could get direct information so often.
---
But if that information is incorrect it’s incorrect.
---
(I also posted another comment, but it wasn’t fully registering as a reply so I deleted it, sorry,, this is a dumber version because I am lazy)
---
He's a paragraph, and not close to being recent.
---
Oh god why would you do this to my poor face eyes
---
Ya man it’s really good
---
thats not a repost then that implies i literally found one of these posts took the picture off and "reposted" it. its a post of the same kind but that picture is still my own. 
---
Anyone find any signs of the Chainsaw and Boomstick? Or him talking?
---
I have enough to buy 2 perks from Shrine, which one would you recommend? Doc and Claudette main.   
---
\- Save The Best For Last (STBFL): Not sure  
---
\- Surveillance: Looks really helpful perk for killers
---
it's ok Jane, you'll still be my #1 forever 
---
Yeah that would be dope too. Both of them would be awesome ([like the horse and laugh at 10:30 in this video](https://youtu.be/QEsknxufIlI?t=624)) 
---
Your lobby also instantly fills up when it is created. It is a necessary evil, to wait 5 minutes at a time
---
lmao wtf
---
NOED doesn't need nerfing. It's a Hex perk, they're supposed to be strong.
---
Or when the game just started and two Fengs are running around like chickens with their heads cut off for no reason. And then they DC when they get found and downed in 2 minutes. Fockin ell.
---
*Man
---
Plus, they actually have to PAY for the license. So it's also actually kind of a fanservice.
---
I'd have to play him and spend money on him, a perfectly reasonable thing not to want to do, now any more dumb points you would like to try and make?
---
Don't worry about rank. Don't worry about pips. Your experience on DBD will improve drastically. 
---
I've explained here about how her ability is bad, and you cant run behind people and vomit that well. Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Oof. Did the killer let you farm BP at least? 
---
Hell no. Put me on hook and started vomiting on me haha. 
---
As far as I know no video of gameplay with audio has been leaked. I presume no skin will have his chainsaw or else he couldn't open chests, work on gens, unhook, or heal without the animations looking nonsensical. 
---
A fun build I use is No Mither, Resiliance, Urban, and dead hard. Gotta play stealthy though.
---
I think his laughter whenever pulling someone into the dream is a good compromise. But he should probably say something when he gets stunned or grabs someone, that'd be good.
---
aww thank you! im actually a Laurie main too xD 
---
But that isn't a 4% is it. The idea is you respect the 4% if they didn't have any luck offerings or additional chances.
---
I want a video of him doing that meme. "Attention DBD gamers. Michael Meyers is trying to get the survivors, but he needs your credit card number, the expiration date, and the three numbers on the back."
---
Ugh I LOVE this but I can't no way afford Gecco prices 🤔🤨😪😥
---
Its all good now it had to download my profile so it is cool now
---
Nice. See you in the fog
---
OP is honestly right. Like you might as well run the trial with only three perks. If you can win a match with Ruin destroyed in the first 30 seconds, imagine what you could do with a fourth perk that actively plays in your favor the whole match.

I'll never understand hexes tbh. I never run them.
---
So you're catering to the slowflakes, cool man.
---
They're nothing like Pops
---
Hmmm, i think you made her a bit 2 small
---
I would pay top dollar for this to be a thing. 
---
How dare Myers be that low
---
Why do they happen to move smoother sometimes then?
---
Bring a coin offering too and share the love with your less fortunate teammates.
---
Wow! *Incredible!* 
---
It'll still need to be negotiated with each individual license holder unfortunately. This does prove that it's possible though.
---
Man I’m excited to try these builds when I get the perks
---
Spirit is Wraith's child confirmed. Yes, I *am* going to ignore basic genetics to believe this. 
---
Yeah! Very dope
---
Haha, unless you have a 4 man SWF team that all are strong to the core, then dont. Rank 1 is the worst rank possible. its insanely toxic and honestly impossible for a solo/duo to survive in
---
I'd rather bring Stridor or Remember Me rather than Bloodhound and Sloppy Butcher. That's just me though.
---
Experiencing this exact problem. I have good internet connection but I always play with people way far from me(typically Japanese) and it's pretty much impossible to get good connection games both as killer and survivor. Rarely ever get people with - 100 ping and the fact that I play on console adds frame drops which creates a very fun time 
---
My biggest tip is to just never drop the pallet.
---
Seriously. Never drop it. At the start anyways. Obviously some killers don't respect pallets but in general you should always start off just never dropping the pallet. 
---
Then as the game progresses, you can decide if you need to or want to drop the pallet based on the killer's behavior thus far.
---
This is also good because it mega conserves pallets.
---
Also a neat trick that works on killers that heavy respect pallets: walk past the pallet while looping. Just for like a second. Slow down and just walk by it. The killer will typically believe you're trying to bait them into a stun and then back up, giving you a lot more distance.
---
Also also never drop shack pallet unless you will die (as in you're dead on hook) if you don't, or if you're pallet saving someone. That pallet's sheer presence really fucks with some killers that don't know how to run shack properly.
---
Now tell that to self-carer please.
---
Oh, at which part are you referring to?
---
it’s not reportable
---
Make all the killers! Then I can have them all fight eachother and pretend I'm the entity! 
---
I searched for Identity V it looks great thx!! I will use it instead of dead by daylight and also thanks for ur concern but I cant afford therapy 
---
If you point at it it kind of looks like petting the top of it's head. I usually spend the first minute of a match on that map petting the horse.
---
Doesn't make sense if they then proceed to bitch about the 4% rule.
---
Sure, take care.
---
I didn't graduated high school so I'm not a woman?? what kind of logic is that 
---
&gt;holy crap the ego on some people
---
Lol, ego.  It was more that I couldn't parse out what you were trying to say since you seem to think that a comma serves the same purpose as a period or line break.  Please explain how it's ego to confuse someone's grammar? 
---
Pathetic
---
When lurker op finally posts. 100 upvotes. 
---
When lurker op finally comments. 150 downvotes. 
---
Lol. 
---
But for real, I put the game back on download hoping for patch fixes with ash. 
---
Killer plays a killer on the roster.
---
*Oh god a fucking KILLER PLAYER*
---
yeah hold on let me just look at all the perks this survivor has
---
THICCER!! 
---
Lmao, nah you made her massive, not like thats a bad thing though LMAO. Ever thought of doing nea?
---
Because you thought the statement was directed at you like I pointed out in my last comment. Is that a simpler explanation for you?
---
So which part is the April fools joke? The release date or the dlc lol
---
Sure it does, if I jumped off of a cliff and landed on a pile of money, only to realize the pile of money was on fire and I was stuck on top of it, I'd be kind of perturbed.
---
My favorite female killer! Anna is just amazing, I love her design and skills. Hopefully you would like my Anna fan art. Please visit my art page if you have interest in art commission. [https://www.patreon.com/posts/23120428](https://www.patreon.com/posts/23120428) Thanks! 
---
Make her bigger! BIGGER!!!
---
Never seen any movie, welp ok
---
Is that perk still prevalent? I don't feel like I've seen it for a long while
---
Spoken like a future Looper. so proud 
---
to be fair Jane was only liked due to her thickness...and potential hotness. all that is overwhelmed by the level of coolness ash williams aka the Cambells soup of extra chunky.
---
I think ever survivor jumps off knowing there's a pile of money at the bottom, and hoping they'll fall in it. It's not like they go in "knowing" they'll die.
---
RANCOR WAS INTRODUCED AS AN ANTI-DS PERK. 
---
DS IS NOW SHIT
---
RANCOR IS OP
---
STOP MAKING ME THE OBSESSION, I DONT RUN OBSESSION PERKS
---
Wow- I know were only getting Ash as a survivor, but seeing this makes me realize how badly I want the Evil Dead cabin as a map.
---
Side note, I think Clown might have the best Addons. 
---
Doctor: He's a Doctor, give him case files and a chess piece. 
---
Trapper: He's a Trapper, give him machine parts and a whetstone. 
---
Leatherface: He's a Cannibal, give him chainsaw parts and chili. 
---
Clown: ***Give him VHS Porn, anesthetics, and severed fingers.***
---
Or, y'know, sometimes you're just shit outta luck.
---
Same ruin really isn’t that good. when I swf me and my friends are like “ yay more blood points” and just work separate
---
Which I explained was because your sentence structure is abysmal.  How is misreading something "ego"?  
---
I personally think someone with an "ego" problem would go around accusing everyone who disagrees with them of having an ego problem, kind of you've done twice now.
---
I agree with Meg. I've been beaten many times by Killers without the use of Ruin. Map &amp; Chase Pressure is all they need.
---
But seriously, me and three rank 8's got stuck against a rank 3 wraith that played with his best addons and it was insane.
---
I am starting to see some looping symptoms lately... 
---
I got 16k bp in just under 3 minutes. So you know I ain’t mad about it lmfao.
---
*cough DM me*
---
Please be a troll.
---
You should upload this to pornhub
---
Lol Jason will never be sucked into this realm since the Entity gave him his own game!  
---
Idk man. Freddy has stabbed jason in the eyes with bladed gloves. They can stab. People have even used cheap replicias to stab people to death with them. Its crazy I think im going to drop 65 dollars on the custom freddy bladed glove and run some tests. 
---
Lol sure, if you found me saying a broad statement like wow people on here have a big ego as a DIRECT comment about just you and you alone. So aside from that when have I insulted you lmao, or are you just feeling insulted.. like someone with a large ego would feel? I’m well aware of the ego I have for using words correctly in a sea of ever growing stupid people. Are you aware of yours?
---
Lmfao! Again a broad statement you took personally. It’s not my problem you get easily insulted, that’s yours alone.
---
nea_is_killer_meme.jpeg/png
---
"Respect the 4%" is hilarious to me. What exactly should I respect about it? There's literally zero skill involved in getting off a hook. I should just look the other way when you get off the hook and kick some gens?
---
The DBD survivor community reminds me of the kids who used to make up rules in tag and hide and seek when things didn't go their way.
---
Uhh... I never watched the remake but that would mean that Freddy is weaker so my point would be strengthened.
---
HAHAHA he really thinks he can report that ? Wow.
---
I agree with that 100%. Personally I dont like Ruin just becouse usually totem is destroyed after minute MAYBE max 2 minutes with decent luck so i need to play basically with only 3 perks. Its just overrated perk and if you rely on it you're just not good at map pressure. I'd use it maybe only on Trapper, Michael or Hag  just becouse trapper and hag needs time to set up traps and Michael to get out of tier 1 
---
Yes after all this equals porn
---
who is controlling this camera that theyre pointing at the players?
---
They designed that fucking door/entrance. Its more like clever usage of game design.
---
I think when one disconnects the rest feel cheated and they quit too. I can sympathize. It sucks for everyone. Unless they were swf and it was all agreed upon.
---
Trapper too. Who disconnects against a level 10 trapper?
---
where the fuck is naked doctor
---
Eh, but you left your buddy “/
---
&gt; , if you found me saying a broad statement like wow people on here have a big ego 
---
That was actually an implied insult to the other guy you were taking to, since contextually it was in reference to the fact that he corrected you.  Pretty intellectually dishonest of you to claim otherwise.
---
&gt; I’m well aware of the ego I have for using words correctly in a sea of ever growing stupid people. Are you aware of yours?
---
The discussion is more about your assumption of everyone else's "ego problem" more so than if if I actually have one.  Any assumption can be true, but that doesn't mean you aren't kind of a dick for making them.
---
The only sad part is that he didnt realize you are the only person left and hooked you right next to the other person
---
The video is from the Dead by Daylight Instagram account (So probably Mathieu AKA pretty good job so far) :) 
---
no new killer tho?
---
 
---
silent doc is one of my favorite builds! its surprisingly effective and one of the best builds in the game if you know what you’re doing 
---
Holy fuck I though it was just me. I literally uninstalled and reinstalled to make sure it wasn't my side.
---
Well in no way am I saying Freddy wouldn’t win. I’m saying that people say Freddy would win no question. The point of the post was to prove my point that it wouldn’t be a clear winner and close(ish) 2nds with the “Ethereal Plane” killers.
---
How do you think I got caught in the trap in the first place? NOED was active and I tried to go searching for the totem before he ended up closing in on me.
---
&gt;It’s not my problem you get easily insulted
---
You literally went off on a multi paragraph tirade on me because I explained a joke to you, so clearly getting offended is *not* my problem alone lmao.
---
The link to the imgur page isn't working. 
---
Monitor over distressing all the way, sometimes it'll let you get close enough for a free hit.
---
I also like stridor on her because she relies on sound so much, but it's mostly a flex pick.
---
The worst thing about dcing is that there is no penalty, so if one dced and you didnt put any good offerings in you might aswell disconnect since it aint gonna harm you, and it really sucks
---
thats kinda unfunny.... like my life
---
That’s the issue. If you use his best addon combo to have half of your nap time be removed that means he is heavily addon reliant and using that combo every game is not only impossible cause it costs 13k BP to have implying your bloodwebs produces an UR and VR addon every time/multiple times but also not using any other combo is evidence his kit is weak. 
---
Also no one said Freddy can’t do well. Hell he was my first p3 killer and I love him, but my point is that all the time I put into him to learn how to mindgame his dream transition, sleep trap people and endgame hostage whole teams is about 60% more effort than playing anyone else who I can still 4K with and not have to deal with Freddy’s annoying kit. 
---
Premonition and empathy are must haves for me.  
---
 Other than that, I cycle between urban evasion/sprint burst/ lithe / self care. 
---
And then resilience/bond/prove thyself/leader.
---
You have not sinned. Fuck survivor mains, the real fun is playing both sides!
---
Yea but its dumb thats its just there empty
---
I don't think it's "Trying to get one to win". More "These are the characters, these are their abilities, this is what they CAN and HAVE done. Knowing that, and letting them USE their powers, who would win?"  
---
"Wraith would win because he doesn't need to show himself"   
---
Isn't that a point for, sadly, Freddy? I mean, his power would find wraith invisible or not?  
---
Or how about legion? One deep wound off on the pig, and then he sees a corner just throbbing with triangles. 
---
The bug was the plague being able to infect the switch by hitting the door
---
I thought you were going back to your dinner, yet you continue to carry multiple conversations with me. Hey, I bet it takes just as long to find those emojis as it does to quote your text. You really *do* care!

Please let him say groovy everytime he pops a gen
---
Ooh, I think you can flash blind other survivors now, because that's just what we needed.
---
Hail to the king, baby.
---
Even though I know very little about Ash, I'm excited to have him in the game. I mean, we finally get someone who sounds confident voicing a character!
---
I haven’t been paying attention to any updates on this game for a while, what is the issue here? I’m not seeing it (and yeah, I get that’s the point)
---
Thanks, now I will no longer be productive on that map. 
---
Gates open "Arbitrary survivor rules out the window*
---
My man.  
---
That made your point have so much less value.  
---
"I never watched this but it sounds like im right"  
---
Freddy was a HUGE threat in that movie, and had the upper hand throughout the film. He was stabbed in the leg at one point and bitchslapped the person who did it.   
---
Remake was a legitimate threat, regardless of if you watched him or not. 
---
So buying this.
---
If the killer wants to they can respect the 4% but if i kobe in myers face i shouldn't expect not to get stabbed
---
I don't get what the problem is.
---
Horror is my favorite movie genre, and getting killers/survivors from them is the coolest thing to me.
---
I know I'm not the only one.
---
Good stun at 1:45. Admirably on-point. 
---
Yeah I don’t get the “All is lost” mentality that some players seem to have when they got found first, hooked immediately, etc. To me, one of the coolest things about the game is how the winds can change in an instant. As someone who’s started many a game out thinking I was toast but ended up surviving (or at least racking up a lot of bp’s trying), my advice to them would be to suck it up and play the game out like a good soldier because they’ll probably be glad they did. Also not shooting their team in the foot is a plus.
---
Nope, confirmed survivor only
---
When I first saw Corrupt Intervention my first thought was that what's the point if you're going to have a perk for only the first two minutes. My friend responded that Ruin hardly ever lasts longer than that 😅
---
I thought you meant an actual cannon lol.  Yeah that would be cool.
---
But Freddy has powers beyond the entity.   
---
Even without the entity's help, he is still immortal.   
---
He has to wait til they sleep, of course, but he is still 100% unkillable... Spoiler 
---
When you are in a chase but the claude who thinks there a god wasted every pallet in 2 gens
---
My favourite is when you bring a Green Mori in game, and 2-3 people quit after the first kill, because they thought you brought a Pink one.
---
Bamboozled.
---
Or maybe something like
---
“Alright, listen you primitive pricks, if we don’t get these generators done we ain’t gettin outa here unless we do you hear?”
---
Its business. I think more people enjoy dlc than announced bug fixes. Besides, when Ash comes out, look at the patch notes. Below the announcement for him will probably be a long list of bug fixes.
---
Behavior is doing their best, but it takes time.
---
I don’t know... Laurie is pretty good.
---
This is brilliant. I wasn't expecting anything outside of his standard outfit / prestige variant, but this is perfect
---
bunny feng
---
Well, easter is coming, so maybe...
---
No, It takes time and effort to test bugs, because bugs don't happen that often, these are a small team of people who are trying to fix their game and it will take time to test, code, test again, and then code more.
---
I mean overwatch does run a lot smoother 
---
It is on certain killers. Billy can snowball very quickly, Spirit and Nurse can find others easily. The rest of the killers can’t, and therefore can have longer periods of downing someone. The other killers need ruin so that they don’t have to worry about being gen rushed. Without it they’ll be in a bad spot. 
---
That’s like literally what I said we couldn’t do. Myers is also immortal because of the Thorn Cult. I’ve basically switched these off for the sake of the fight. What’s the point of a brawl if they can’t die?
---
[This video didn't have to look this way.](https://youtu.be/f2picMQC-9E)
---
What’s with the Claudette hate? I’m not up to date on the meta so I’m just curious
---
One can only fucking hope. Let’s hope the alternate reality that happens in is OURS.
---
I know that the majority of people complain about BHVR's rash decisions, but imho it's better if the developer keeps making rash decisions rather than putting the game on hold completely, killing any sort of movement in it's history. 
---
What is this fanfiction
---
well i was playing at the same time and still trying to survive so I just wanted to capture it real quick
---
So now, everyone is mortal.
---
But even then, Freddy has dream powers, so he could avoid anything with his "demon stuff", and could only hurt you in dream. 
---
That said, he still has his abilities, right? Other than Immortality? +
---
If Freddy couldn’t kill some fucking teenager how can he compete against anyone? Like sure Myers couldn’t kill Laurie but that was only because he was ambushed by Loomis. Of course he was a threat in the movie. It’s against a bunch of teenagers with no outside help. (Loomis) 
---
i like the video you linked though 😂⚰️
---
FUCK PEOPLE WHO D.C., CAMP, AND FUCK PEOPLE WHO ARE RANK 5 AND LITERALLY MESSAGE RANK 15 PLAYERS BULLSHIT AFTER ONE PERSON DCED. CONGRATS ON BEATING A HANDICAPPED TEAM TEN RANKS BELOW YOU. I HOPE IT GIVES YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO GO THROUGH YOUR DAY AND THE REALIZATION OF HOW UTTERLY PATHETIC IT IS NEVER SETS IN. 
---
I'm pissed. The old system worked fine, what is this horseshit? 
---
I HAD THIS HAPPEN 3 TIMES TODAY. FUCKING BULLSHIT
---
He locked the other guy who was only on his second hook. In the basement. There was no way for us to get him. Even though we we’re prepared to try. I’m also a killer main soooo 👌🏼
---
I think the first 3 should be reversed and put bubba in there.
---
ok, but the question is - is this available somewhere outside of PAX? :) 
---
Well we are using Entity rules for this fight. This means that Freddy has a converted Dreamworld. He can’t create or shape stuff. I’m guessing because of Auric Cells or something like that. If you meant avoid as like only hit him in the Dreamworld world, no. Survivors can stun Freddy when awake so Doc and Plague can still make him insane or sick and of course everyone can still use their basic attacks and powers against him. He’s just invisible. 
---
And Bill
---
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.
---
this is a BAD idea, Us Australian players won't get ANY matches!!
---
Hopefully he has some rotating voice lines while waiting for the game to start and maybe a few catch phrases when he is escaping. I can totally understand not wanting them in-game but some quick jabs before and after could be great.
---
i'm in Russia. 70% of time i get EU zone people and UK but 30% is Korean and Japanese swfs. sometimes when playing survivor i get Chinese killers(why are they all playing Trapper?).
---
and gotta say playing against rank 1 Japanese swfs is my best experience in the game. they are really skilled, no one bms, i don't have to ignore farming and disrespect because there's simply none. they play skilled and smart and not scammy. i wish all survivors were like Japanese swfs. even when i lose i feel satisfied cause the game was good. 
---
But Myers was a force of nature, thats how the Director wanted him to be. "Not quite human, more force" . Of course he was a threat.
---
But my point is, FREDDY IS TOO. Freddy murdered countless teens in his movie, and ONLY lost because of a low blow while his back was turned. Even then, he *spoiler* didn't lose. 
---
Freddy would easily rip apart some of the fighters, and I truly believe he is a bigger threat than you want to give him credit for. 
---
GUYS WHEN I CAN STOP USING CAPS ?
---
Considering nothing is legible, how the hell should I know?
---
&gt;FIX THE GAME
---
what people want, but will never get
---
&gt;USELESS COSTMETIC + UNEXPECTED SURVIVOR DLC
---
what we get, but don't want
---
Not to mention, the teens worked together, had a legitimate plan, and went in READY to fight. 
---
Laurie found a clothes hanger. 
---
The boost will be active and going down before you hit the ground
---
Geronimo!!
---
That’s what I was trying to say. Technically Wraith and Freddy could just wait it out. Collectively kill the last killer and fight each other. Good question. I have no idea but since Wraith crosses to another dimension with his bell I can assume it’s different from the Dreamworld. 
---
Ah okay. Thanks! 
---
1. sure its easy for him to put them back to sleep, assuming they are close by and he can find them. On everything but the smallest maps this can be a huge problem. sure you can juggle, but there are easier, and better killers to learn. You do you, but you gotta admit playing freddy is a labor of love. The mere fact self care can ruin freddy is a negative, and while i agree self care isn't *as* common, it is still is common.
---
8.2 Sure the mind game is harder. But you can do it more often and it has better rewards. Not to mention the added mobility of it.
---
1. You lose time. and time is the most important thing. And its not always as cut and dry as "just walk foward". I'm agreeing with you that Hag is good. She just has some issues and jank.
---
Sure the could get complacent, I've seen it happen. or they could be emboldened and end the game quick. I see that more often. even if they are complacent it often doesn't matter. All the time I play freddy and i see survivors playing stupid and the worst thing i can do to punish them is put them to sleep. 
---
Hillbilly, Myers, Leatherface, Huntress, Spirit, Trapper, Wraith, Doctor, Legion and Plague have some sort of mindgame they can pull to drop pallets early. In addition to having a better power. Freddy gains no time at pallets.
---
You're right, I needed to update! Thanks guy!
---
Ok that changes literally nothing, it's not bannable just like facecamping was never bannable, blocking you off from being able to unhook them IS. NOT. BANNABLE.
---
Just get over it your report will do literally and I can't express this enough LITERALLY nothing.
---
Well if he's allowed to use flashlight light I'm allowed to used NOED.  These are the unspoken rules.. or something.
---
Ok thanks for that information. Now I’m not sure if I want to get up there now
---
Games that have a bad start can find themselves to be the most tense/fun/best games you can end up having.
---
But lets just throw that away because you didn't get your way in the first minute.
---
Weird mentality. I don't get it. Just stay in the game.
---
Exactly. Freddy is powerful in his movie because he can’t be killed without being “put to rest.” In this fight immortality is out.
---
Holy shit he has.. a lot. That’s awesome! I’m hoping for an Army of Darkness outfit. 
---
Fair, but other than the doctor and legion, who would find him?
---
Plus, I imagine that invisibility will be more than enough to just hide for a bit and watch doc, and legion, and plague, be hands on with trapper, billy boy, and pig
---
Preach.
---
Probably not, they'd need licensing rights for 3 extra characters amd they'd start losing out on their investment
---
Thats not why he can't be killed in the remake. 
---
I get this a lot.. are you on console by any chance?
---
Well anyone. The grass splits under his feet so perceptive killers like Myers and Wraith could very easily track and ambush Freddy.
---
Pretty sure you can get it from blizzards website
---
Then what is? I really stopped watching after WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH. Never really needed to see more ya know?
---
A very similar situation happened to me earlier except I was the survivor. If that darn Feng had died just a second earlier I could’ve made it out. Instead I got hooked right in front of it and watched my precious hatch slip away as I floated into the sky. 
---
Mass DCs for no reason is a bug. It happens all the time in current patch.
---
I always thought wraith just pulled a spy from Team Fortress. I never really considered it as another dimension. 
---
That said, if we follow that pattern, now it's just Wraith and Freddy 
---
Which, to me, is a total 40/60. Advantage wraith with his axe, but Freddy got the speed and agility, plus strength, to fight off a bit
---
And that, kids, is why we do it.
---
wowza
---
Y E S!
---
LICENSED COSMETICS! Hopefully he'll also have the Asylum Ashy Slashy outfit, and a hawaiian shirt!
---
Or this is just a teaser for bunny Feng
---
The shotgun is on his back ?
---
Yes Freddy would definitely win in a fight against a few of the killers like Hag, probably Doc and a few others but the point of the post was to put an end to people saying that Freddy was a clear winner.
---
I clenched my cheeks so hard, that was more so luck with the latency than pure skill lmao
---
nothing in life has made me happier than i am right now...
---
At least i didnt depip lmao
---
Same for killers... 
---
The 80's is also considered a golden age of horror regardless of how long ago it was. 
---
There’s another post on this sub that has his Hawaiian shirt, someone playing the game is running around with it on
---
Yeah, but without Ruin you kinda just have to babysit gens to keep survivors off them, I'd rather just have some fun and commit to a chase than have the game end after a few decent chases.
---
Not true at all. if ruin stays up for only a minute, it was still impactful because it slowed repairs for that entire 60 seconds. If youre hooking your first person right as ruin is destroyed, it has served its purpose. Especially in this new ranking system when curb-stomping a team of survivors is rewarded much more than killing 2 or 3. 
---
Fantastic. I wonder how we earn them or if we just get them all when we buy Ash. 
---
That... Is a specific picture well done OP
---
Is this sans!Undertale?
---
If your totem was destroyed in the first minute, that's at least one survivor who had to sacrifice a minute of productivity. If it wasn't your Ruin that popped, than it would have been a generator. 
---
- You are wrong. If the game is Killer sided for 99.9% of players and Survivor sided for 0.1% of players, it is completely nonsensical to say it is Survivor sided as opposed to Killer sided.
---
-Every data ever shown from every year has shown it is Killer sided. The fact that it might be Survivor sided for 0.1% means nothing in comparison to the remaining 99.9%.
---
-No data ever shown from Behavior indicates it is well balanced now. It has always been Killer sided and Killers keep getting buffs.
---
I sort of though it was the cannibal who was supposed to eat others, not the another way around
---
No I think he just wants the massive edge over killers again
---
What the fuck, the game doesnt reward toxic behavior? Wild. 
---
im literally shakign and cryign that game is so frickin good
---
totally not groovy
---
Yes they do, and no you haven’t. I’m not digging through three months is comments just to prove you wrong because you’re already a waste of time. 
---
This would be the most elaborate April Fools by a video game company ever...
---
Even hiring Bruce Campbell and making an in game model and perks? That's dedication :)
---
"Just a meme"
---
Would be great if Sans can join in DBD game 
---
Who needs accuracy in melee? If you’ve ever watched a real sword fight (which you should) a simple good cut  in a body part could very easily disable your opponent. Say Freddy is fighting Billy. Freddy rushes in to stab Billy’s eyes out. Billy obviously can’t pull his chainsaw out in time so he swings in defense. Let’s say the hammer hits the swingin’ arm. The hammer would easily crush Freddy’s bones and deflect the hit and with the recoil Billy could follow up with more hits winning the fight. I mean if Freddy pulls everyone in the Dreamworld hides out and ambushes for a backstab Billy would definitely be dead before he could do anything.
---
Can’t you just break the pallet?
---
I have all Killers on P3, going for the fullbuild Plague atm.
---
I commited to something stupid, I have to admit.
---
There are so many amazing skins out there... if u never started the prestige thing, u should never go for it.
---
Better bloodwebs, welp I've been playing this game for over 3k hours (nearly 3 years), I feel no difference.
---
What hurts the most: fucking losing everything.
---
Getting that prestige in, doesn't feel good most of the time... I've never seen a game, where you kinda get punished for grinding like a mad man... 
---
I think...
---
* u should keep all items.
---
* all 4 perk slots.
---
* for real get better bloodwebs... does this shit look good to u: https://imgur.com/a/44cPBi8 .... at high rank I need most of the time green or higher stuff, with few exceptions brown and yellow stuff.
---
When a new chapter comes out, we should instantly get the weekend double bloodpoint events and maybe 2-3 weeks later for people who missed the opportunity.
---
a way to sell ur shit addons and offerings for 50% would be freaking great.
---
How is it an infinite? I haven't seen it, but most killers move significantly faster than survivors.
---
Well, I guess one of these is the default power glove and the Prestige one as well... but there's STILL one I can't account for. I'm going with Army of Darkness. Anyone else have any guesses?
---
Bruh it doesn’t even help us it only made queues shot in both ends instead of just survivor
---
No killer, they confirmed it’s survivor only
---
How did that postgame chat go? 
---
If Goodsmiles got the rights to DbD now, that means we could possibly some day get DbD figmas??
---
I would prefer NECA so it’d fit with my other horror figures but I’d definitely buy a figma 
---
I'll make it rain for you Bruce!
---
Everyone when perks of his were leaked
---
DEAR GOD, YES! I want it as hard as I want the Cabin in the Woods map for L4D
---
It also gives you far more distance than dead hard ever would but yeah basically that's the point - it's unavoidable and has no counter play unless you're using someone like Billy. Which is the irony in that a stronger killer can be immune to this perk but all the weak killers who can't end chases as fast as billy will be the ones affected by it.
---
But that isn't nea you dummy
---
OMG! It is! This is going to be fucking awesome. 
---
Could replace bing bong with wailing.
---
On the bright side that means a killer only dlc is probably right around the corner 
---
The head is attached with the body
---
Those are some I M M E R S E D gamers
---
Now I'm trying to think of what classic horror skins you could give the various killers...
---
Not at all, chief. The Evil Dead franchise, Ash as a character and Bruce Campbell as an actor are three of the most refreshing and interesting additions to the horror genre... well, ever.
---
Yeah I enjoy them, I understand they can be toxic. Never used Franks on him and don’t try hard tunnel. I enjoy a lot of things about them and enjoy it. I understand why it’s toxic and agree the devs can do a lot to improve the experience both as and against them. But yeah, I enjoy ‘em.
---
A lot like Hillbilly it seems.
---
The Legion goes first on the fade out!
---
Haha, that's understandable. I just have a habit linking that video every time I see VVS in action. ;*
---
Great skillchecks are easy to hit. 
---
SO MUCH WAIT TIME TO GET AN ACTUAL LOBBY WITH PLAYERS. THEN 75% GAME WONT START CUZ OF D/C.
---
MATCHMAKING IS SUPER RANDOM AND REALLY BREAKS THE EXPERIENCE.
---
Got the same. Took me a while to realize it was MY ass blocking my screen (yes I mean it was Meg's but still). Was very confusing game and how it probably would look after some drugs...
---
Ya but it would still be cool af
---
THERE'S ONE ON PC TOO AND IT'S EXISTENCE BAFFLES ME BUT AT LEAST IT'S EASY TO AVOID WITH A KEYBOARD
---
They don't need to stay injured the entire match though.
---
This is how the game normally plays out...
---
\- Hit once by killer (injured), hit again by killer (down)
---
\- Hooked, unhooked, healed
---
\- Hit once by killer (perk activates, go to injured), hit again by killer (perk gives invincibility), hit again by killer (down)
---
\- Hooked, unhooked
---
Now you can see that the survivor will be on their death hook by this point. It's only that last hook they don't need to heal for. Unless they were first out or tunneled down it's likely this would be late game anyway.
---
Sure sometimes you can take a hit from a killer and they walk away to chase others or you lose them but generally it works like the above.
---
It's insane to me how many survivors don't use the pre-match chat to coordinate roles. How about designating a totem hunter? Communicating with each other who is good at which roles? Who sucks at chases and wants to stay on gens? 9/10 of my chats when I play survivor are completely dead, there's no gameplanning or anything. 
---
Ohmwrecker always calls him Gollum. It kills me every time. 
---
Don't know if anyone else has responded to this yet, but played him at PAX and despite having the best "falling" scream he doesn't have bonus lines :(
---
16m terror radius works like a charm on Spirit, it gives you more time before the survivors know you are right next to them.
---
So if you play a standard competitive game, say Starcraft, and you tell me "Protoss is OP" because you're silver tier and bad, does that make Protoss actually OP?
---
If silvers in CS:GO say that the M4A4 is OP because it's more accurate than the AK and pro players laugh at them, are the silvers actually correct?
---
No. That's just an excuse for the 99.9% of the community to continue being bad. Git gud and you won't need to say it.
---
As a killer main I don't understand why killers have such a hard time with loops. Most killers' abilities are enough to counter loops. Some killers are harder to do this with than others. Nothing like faking a Spirit phase-walk to psych-out loopers.
---
Anything is possible. It just depends on how much money your willing to spend. 
---
Honestly just don’t run Franks and people are surprisingly nice. I had a nice grind of a few days of no one being salty, all ranging from 0-4ks and was kinda eerie how no one was mad but reddit loses it.
---
And yet again this has NOTHING to do with strenght. or feats He was inspired by him and thats it nothing else. Trapper is his own thing and was only INSPIRED by Jason. Trapper has never done anything remotely Close to what Jason can do.
---
Not hard to maintain red rank as a killer when the game keeps matching you with survivors 12 ranks lower than you.
---
Ah I see. Didn’t know about the toxic part but I do notice that I have more success hiding in plain sight with Claud than anyone else. 
---
Dear Killer mains, just look harder next time it’s not that hard 🤷🏼‍♂️.
---
he's gonna get cosmetics? hmmm
---
+ P3 Claudette, you are not even a player, yiu are part of the map, of the shadows...
---
WHY DID THEY DROP THE TIME ON DS SO NOW ENDURING BREAKS IT ENTIRELY?! ITS NOT WORKING AS ANTI TUNNELING IF THEY CAN JUST TURN AROUND AND SMACK YOU AFTER YOU DS! I'VE USED IT ONCE AND GOT SCREWED!
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS GARBAGE ASS FUCKING SHITTY ASS DUMBASS STUPID ASS FUCKING RANKING SYSTEM IT SUCKS COCK
---
Killers who's HIV has advanced to the terminal stage.
---
fuck me then, I guess. I main survivor because I enjoy the game but suck at being a killer.
---
Well, I'd rather have this that at rank 10 than matching all the time against rank 17 or something killers.
---
They're not hardline rules, nobody is going to DC if the guy running Small Game to look for Ruin went in for a save. It's better to have some idea of what your teammates plan on doing during the match and what they're good at and equipped for. Most pre-game chats are dead though. 
---
I wouldn't call them garbage but I agree that their content is getting really repetitive and boring. Really love No0b3s streams on Twitch tho (besides the chat)
---
If there is a new killer I bet it’s the RAPE TREE ;)
---
Monto does build vids, the others don't. Not only that, he does interesting/unique builds.
---
He also does not rely on ear rape and obnoxious noises.
---
Yeah not enough people playing so when you do find someone they’re on the other side of the US or In Canada so you end up with laggy killers
---
Red rank NOED plague player shittalks brown ranks, seems like a normal post-game lobby to me.
---
Flash lights would be useless lol
---
I agree with the sentiment but still, in reality plans fall through and things are unpredictable
---
The new ranking system really doesn't help with teamwork
---
HybridPanda is entertaining to watch though :)
---
In dbd though it would be the headless manman unless they just use his horse like Billy’s chainsaw 
---
You'll start preciating that after trying to play against 1000 ping
---
Just making assumptions because we currently have two paragraphs, survivor or killer only DLCs, so the ocd in me wants them to balance it out 
---
they have yellow ping in my lobbies(though i'm in Moscow) and don't experience any major lag in game. 
---
it highly depends on your internet connection. sometimes green ping makes the game fucked but sometimes stable red ping is very much playable. 
---
Nah your good. I'm talking like those who complain about everything that is wrong with a killer but don't take the time to actually try to play as the killer, like how everyone complained about Legion but half of those were just survivor mains who didn't even try to play as them.
---
DADDY ***Y E S***
---
Continue dreaming, my boy!
---
He is one of the creators I really like. He seems a lot more positive and level headed compared to the rest of the community
---
The best way I could describe it is that Tapp looks like Glover from a distance but Quentin and Laurie have to be facing and the other way and for some reason Laurie has a dry and dirty mop on her head.
---
I guess killers won't complain about Claudettes anymore, since everyone and their mothers are becoming Ash mains. Ashes vs. Evil Killers.
---
I'm great with freddy. I'm told if I switched to better killers id be better I just haven't done it yet
---
This... Is so unbelievably idiotic. How at all is adding this characters ruining them? It in fact did the opposite for me and gave me even more respect for these horror classics. I can kinda understand being disappointed Ash is just a weak survivor, but this isn't Ash's world to kick ass in, he's playing by the entity's rules. He still looks badass though 
---
Because once you have BL the loop becomes infinite due to the stun reduction.
---
I don’t see this as a problem. This is like seeing 4 Pizza Dwight’s pop into the lobby.
---
After the leaks about Ash's perks.
---
Tumblr said so
---
I played against a killer who ran Third Seal last night, my first time facing that perk, and it was awful... 
---
I think the Legion perk might just become the new meta.
---
Can we also have a perk that just instantly sacrifices survivors who break your totem in the first 20 seconds of the match pls? 
---
Think if we include that we might have the complete list for the new anti-toxic chapter release.
---
ASHY SLASHY!!
---
You basically used three posts to say "Well you can't always be prepared for everything" and then when I continued to express frustration, you called me entitled and childish. I don't want to be held captive in a game when I could just get hooked and go into another game. It is a waste of my time. 
---
Not a problem at all, I love it. Dare I say, it's...groovy, baby.
---
So...I'm supposed to take Unbreakable every game on the off-chance i get slugged? If you want to argue that the game has counters, but then you go and say that you can't prepare for everything so why mention counters? Slugging is frustrating as a survivor. Not even trying to sound entitled, but it essentially removes you from doing anything but bleed out or crawl and hope a teammate comes to get you, but if the killer slugs everyone then guess what no ones coming.
---
I dont believe people should DC cause of anything except someone picking Legion cause fuck that poorly designed garbage, but slugging is frustrating and i think thats what /u/tommagramagram was trying to say, not that oh theyre slugging we should DC. But that even with unbreakable in the game you cannot guarantee the killer is going to slug, and if they do and you dont have unbreakable it just feels bad.
---
Imagining only being able to heal yourself at 50% speed.
---
*this post made by Pharmacy gang*
---
That's what I said in the comment of the video is that adding them to a game where players can play as them and learn about them is actually EXPOSING the character to possibly new fans who would go check out their movies!
---
Yooo, this is so cool, do you think there is any way i could use this for my twitch?
---
Yeah I think this bug was there since legion came out? I might be wrong 
---
Hell I have 2 PlayStations and 2 laptops.. do I need to start new accounts dl the game and play all 4 at the same time? Cuz I sure as fuck will if there’s only 7 people playing killer lol
---
The only good Claudette is a dead Claudette
---
r/raimimemes
---
Feel free! Just toss up a little credit to my reddit here if you can and you're golden :D thanks for asking!
---
Im getting so triggered honestly
---
- I would pay top dollar
---
You mean, like, the lowest tier amount of auric cell packs you can buy?
---
Just spend 5 minutes playing where's waldo while everyone else finishes the gens 4Head 
---
No, I'm sorry I have my own plans for it! But I may open commissions soon;)
---
But what if it played out like in Freddy v Jason? 
---
I think the hole thing is heavily debatable and that if anyone won if wouldnt be because of any abilities they all can mostly be countered one way or another. 
---
To make this story have a happy ending, after those 35 mins i gave up played the killer and guess what I got this SWF group that teabagged and flashlight me the whole game. FeelsGreatMan
---
Toolshed
---
Susies skirt
---
Pretty good job so far :)
---
It was unfair of me to bring up Monto. He's one of the better ones. I just couldn't think of anyone else at the time.
---
True, but I thought that was just because the entity made it so. I imagine with other killers it would be like a survivor, the only reason pallets were immune to that was because entity needed a show
---
what did they promise to add?
---
Hmm, that's odd, I heard it during a lore stream way back in the day. I wouldn't put it past BHVR to forget their own lore.
---
Yeah right secret bhvr dev, I know a leaked cosmetic when I see one.
---
Imagine having ***Bruce Campbell*** at your complete and utter disposal and using him for a silent character. What a waste of potential that would be. 
---
You realize russia isn’t in the middle east right? 
---
But the thing is that you don't want that, *and* you don't want to use the tools available to counter that. I'm just saying that you're not being "held hostage" if you had the tools available to you, but you deferred them because you'd rather specialize in something else. Hell, I do the same; I run gen rush builds. It sucks when I get slugged but at least I have a chance to be healed instead of immediately hooked, and I know that it was my choice to plan for this circumstance. 
---
Got me!
---
Inb4 survivors claim BM if you hit them while they pet the horse
---
I don’t blame you, I feel like I’m hogging all the survivors playing at this point because nobody else is getting any games ☹️. All jokes aside I’ve legitimately considered setting up both of my PS’s for this reason alone. I could probably do more good being a shitty player on 2 games than dicking around on just one at a time lol, I’m gonna start testing my surv wait times again see if I’m having the same issue cuz I wasn’t earlier.
---
C... Can we get a Kandarian Deaddite Killer?
---
Too much?
---
I don't like TydeTime because it feels like he's constantly complaining about one thing after another and it gets in the way of what he's trying to talk about. I should have clarified that better.
---
I don't mind Monto as much as the other ones and am editing him out.
---
I don't care for tru3. He's always come off as a lad, but also a bit big for his britches. Maybe it's just me though.
---
Gotta love that they had to make the date April 2nd so people don't think it's a prank.
---
I have had a Michael see that I was doing and walk on by. 
---
Why would you want to change Bruce Campbell's beautiful face?
---
The Doctor is the reason I bought this game! :D The community hates everything, at this point I just tune them all out. 
---
Trappers best resource is resetting traps. 5/10 times it works everytime 
---
"The real ash packs a much bigger boomstick!" - Charles Darwin, probably.
---
It's weird seeing someone trying to act like such a hardass coming off as a petulant whiny bitch.
---
Now you can wait 20-30 minutes in swf but as Bruce Campbell. Groovy huh. 
---
Who's the killer going to be or no killer? Gotta be bad ash from army of darkness or deadite ash from evil dead 2. 
---
Ruin is a gamble perk. If it takes 2 minites to find the gen the gives me two minites to find you with no gens getting done. Bonus points if i find you trying to cleanse it
---
haha ofc man, thank you so much! keep up the great work! &lt;3
---
No shit, this is pretty epic.
---
&gt; So...I'm supposed to take Unbreakable every game on the off-chance i get slugged?
---
Uh....that's your decision. You can just just suck it up and acknowledge that it doesn't happen often enough to justify preparing for it, *or* you can run it if you're so concerned about it. What you're doing right now is complaining that you can't be prepared for every killer loadout, playstyle, and circumstance. That's entitlement. 
---
Survivors concerned about tracking perks use Distortion, without knowing if the killer is even running them. Small Game on the chance they're running totems. Etc. These tools are available so that if something is so damn annoying to you, you're able to deal. You cannot have a loadout that counters everything dude, sometimes you're going to have made the wrong decisions with your loadout and strategy. 
---
Cool character, garbage perks.
---
Pfft i don't know what you're talki--- LOOK SHIRTLESS MYERS OVER THERE! 🏃
---
this is all true for me except franks + dirt 
---
WHY THE FUCK AM I BEING MATCHED UP WITH RANK 1 AND 2 KILLERS IM A SHITTY BABY SURVIVOR AND ITS PISSING ME OFF. ITS EVERY GAME AT THIS POINT. 
---
Bubba
---
Is
---
*Herobrine*
---
This is literally releasing on my birthday 
---
they will kill the game slowly. it's insane what they are doing.
---
That is absolute perfection in a meme. 11/10.
---
sadly this is relatable
---
She has a fully modelled face below the Mask. They could if they'd just ask the licence holders.
---
i will only use them for bloodpoints i swear ill let everyone go after i get my bbq stacks
---
okay maybe ill two hook them BUT ILL LET THEM ALL LIVE OKAY I JUT NEED BLOODPOINTS TO LEVEL OTHER KILLERS AND I THINK LEGION IS GOOD FOR THAT DONT LYNCH ME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
What's the point if we cannot get into games? Who will pay for Ash in these conditions? Guys, vote with your wallet.
---
Is that the part you wanted to take from the two paragraphs? Despite me agreeing with you and saying there are counters and that you can't prepare for everything. This wasn't me complaining that slugging had no counters. I stated that slugging in itself is frustrating, even if i bring unbreakable, if i go down again i cant use it again.
---
I don't care if the killer kills me, i don't care if it isn't a game of tag or if i get tunneled. But fuck if I cant move on to the next game without DCing or letting the killer get bored and finally hook me.
---
You expected it to stop? Lmfao.
---
Same@you, btw. Stop trying to be like me. 
---
10 mins? That's it?! Ha try 30mins just to get dodged and then another 30!
---
We all just wanna play as Sam Axe
---
Jesus your not having any luck whatsoever 
---
Yeah it's straight up garbage now.
---
Wait 3 mins for a lobby
---
Killer disconnects
---
Wait 3 mins for another lobby
---
Face camped on first hook
---
Infinite load screen
---
Killer dodges
---
Survivor suicides/disconnects on first hook
---
The game is an absolute pile of shit for survivor right now. The devs are such stupid cunts. You can argue solo survivor sucks play swf, but then it's queing ages for each lobby only to have the killer dodge it because they don't like swf.
---
I can only play killer now. I feel like I've got half a game. The developers deserve every bit of criticism they're getting for this.
---
Haha ur just a libtard 😎😎😎😎😎😎
---
Well, I'm a scrub who doesn't own hag. I can't run Ruin to slow down the game, so I just run NOED instead. Same thing, right?
---
Flashlight clicking, moonwalking, spinning in circles by a window, and generally just over the top bm
---
I don't want anything on this list nerfed at all so keep flaunting that illiteracy. Lmao Considering I said that in the first post and many since. 
---
Also, I'll type however I want. When you're right, you can do that. You're being held in contempt until otherwise stated. 
---
Bond vs Empathy vs Aftercare ? 
---
I find Empathy being the best, Aftercare being the second and Bond being the worst.
---
GODAMNIT YOURE RIGHT HIS FUCKING SUCKS
---
Don't use Freddy as an excuse. He's much stronger than what the average DbD player believes him to be and Survivors suck versing him, because they've forgotten how to play against him with how rarely he's played.
---
I can see your point with TydeTyme. My opinion of him went sour when I saw how he defended his tier list on killers. Seems to be very headstrong with his opinions but I respect him for his experience in the game &amp; the guide to toolkits. 
---
I quite like Monto. Was one of the reasons I came into dbd because of his perk builds. Its what I like about dbd. Perk diversity which changes the way you play. My only issue with the game is that perks are beginning to feel mandatory if you want to play very well rather than supplementing gameplay.
---
Definitely, see your point on tru3. I respect him for how good he is at the game &amp; his Britishness considering I'm also a Brit. Do feel though that he is a bit macho with some very high confidence in himself. I suppose people like that about him. He's like the inspiration of David King in the game. 
---
Fungoose is becoming my favourite creator. He's excellent at the game &amp; is very enthusiastic with teaching people how to play the game more efficiently. The issue is that his accent &amp; his enthusiasm can be a bit overbearing at times similar to HybridPanda. Still enjoy him as a content creator. 
---
Quentin luv Nancy tho
---
They hated ~~Jesus~~ Johansen because he told them the truth.
---
I used  ds balances Landing no mither and saboteur
---
still doesn't look like her since they couldn't get her likeness.
---
i hope you don't mind my asking for some clarification. 
---
what the fuck is flashlight clicking? i can't even get the killer to drop a survivor.
---
moonwalking... what does this accomplish? i've not seen this yet so it just makes me laugh imagining a survivor pulling a michael jackson.
---
spinning in circles in front of a window... what does this do for a survivor? 
---
thanks for being patient with me on this. cheers!
---
Also I have the big gay, don't forget that
---
And my wife isn't even a doctor
---
There is no way he's not gonna have any lines. It's such a waste. I mean look at the recording studio he's in. It seems high end.
---
Most of the VAs in this game are just developers though o-o
---
Can we turn every flashlight Ash holds into a boomstick? 
---
Just have him blast the killer back 16 m &amp; stun them.
---
What happened?
---
I'm partial to Marth.  No goofy sfx in any of his vids, just playing the damn game. 
---
I had a feeling but I will not stand for this tragedy, I will only stalk for it
---
You can word it however you want, but it's still frustrating because when I run unbreakable, I don't get slugged. When I don't, I do.
---
All that you're saying is "You should plan better" and all I'm saying is "There's no hard counter that is no-fail to slugging and it can happen at any time and that takes the fun out of the game. Just hook me rather than slugging everyone and then leaving us on the floor to bleed out."
---
Haha all g! Thanks for considering it, I’ll be keen to see what you have for commission! &lt;3
---
I didn't see you agreeing with me maybe I misread, in fact my whole point is that yes, people concerned with getting slugged should run anti-slugging perks, obviously with the tradeoff of whatever they could have used in that place. Balance couldn't work if each survivor knows what they're going to encounter before each match. I know it's frustrating to run Small Game when the killer doesn't use totems, or to be slugged when you didn't take Unbreakable, but in a 4vs1, these kinds of rock-paper-scissors dynamics are necessary. 
---
In regards to your second paragraph that I didn't address earlier, I'm not really sure what to say. Yeah losing a match to slugging is frustrating. I don't disagree. 
---
Don't get me wrong, ash may become my surv main, but wasnt the idea that all the survs are people you could see in a cafe?
---
I too want the Claudette mask for my Bubba. I &lt;3 the only killer with built in (free) vosmetics!
---
Eh depends on rank I think. Ruin is better lower rank because most high rank survivors will do gens through ruin and just hit greats. Personally I think a slowing down healing build is better or I like running devour over ruin because it catches survivors by surprise 
---
👀👀👀👀
---
*DC against legion* GROOVY
---
Survivor mains think that if they juke a killer once they are an uncatchable God, therefore they must have been robbed of a free 5 gen run and escape if they get downed.
---
What ever happened to dying with dignity? 
---
Not if you play as spirit and run trill of the hunt as well
---
An exhaustion perk is always a good idea - sprint burst is versatile but other exhaustion perks are better in different situations. Balanced landing is good even if you’re exhausted because of faster fall recovery, but some maps don’t have falls. Adrenaline is a very niche but strong end-game perk. 
---
Ally aura reading like empathy/bond/aftercare each have their own advantages and are good in general. 
---
Pharmacy/self-care/botany knowledge are for healing, though self-care is very slow and botany can be sort of niche. Pharmacy requires you to search through a chest. Sloppy butcher also slows down healing even more. 
---
Other perks are dependent on your build: urban evasion/iron will/distortion are good for sneaking around. Iron will and UE are good in general, too. Poised/dance with me/quick and quiet can help you lose killers. Premonition/alert/spine chill help locate the killer. Borrowed time/we’ll make it/deliverance is good when unhooking teammates. Just keep in mind that some perks are weak if they don’t match your build; if you gen rush, dance with me isn’t good.   
---
Barely
---
FPS.
---
People dont normally DC against Legion unless you use his strongest add-on, Franks Mixtape. 
---
Otherwise I would only recommend Legion if you are interested in his perks or like his aesthetic. 
---
Without Add-ons I would consider Legion to be one of the weakest killers in the game. This is due to his power not doing much to kill survivors &amp; his 110% base movement speed. 
---
He is getting a rework so this might all change but for now, I would consider it if you are interested in the aesthetic or perks.
---
Idk when it came out but you can't fast vault it at all. Medium vaults are fine I believe
---
Controversial thought: make DS part of the basic survivor kit to prevent hard tunneling.
---
The way DS is now it would be fair Imo. Good killers can win without tunneling and camping. 
---
Crossing fingers that means we also gonna get more cosmetics for him in the future
---
Still no reason to make Quentin look like a gremlin.
---
I’m pretty sure they modeled Laurie after her comic book counterpart.
---
Thanks man. Im sorry if i sounded aggressive, but we're all just trying to enjoy the game and when you get intentionally made to be unable to do it it sucks. I dont want to counter everything i fuckin love the way the game works with perks. I just wish slugging wasnt rewarded because its frustrating in solo queue to hope someone runs over and risk their own neck to save you.
---
I haven't heard of fungoose until today but watching his latest video, he does sound pretty passionate. I tried not to bring up smaller creators because I feel like they make higher quality content, comparitively.
---
Dam ty for this shareeee
---
That could potentially be covered by the sandbagging one. Just use the perk to pause, turn into Stone Cold, and beat their ass
---
This is high art.
---
Should have included in the lore that Frank has a serious case of Asthma. 
---
Instead of looking at his hands he takes out his inhaler every time he fatigues.
---
I really don't care about any of that, but not leaving after the exit gates are powered when you're the only survivor on the map.  Always a claudette.  That's the only behavior that I truely feel is toxic.
---
There’s no way he will
---
instead of "NERF SURVIVORS" put in "TUNNEL/CAMP SURVIVOR AND CALL THEM SALTY TRASH IN CHAT"
---
Someone bring holy water 
---
Ok... But do we ship Ash &amp; Lisa since they both have weird hands? Or do we ship Ash &amp; Billy since they both one hand chainsaws?
---
I like most of the killers. I play a solid 3-4 on rotation. Freddy just has that charm of satisfaction. 
---
But... Panda....
---
the glass in her shoulder used to reflect the campfire, it doesn't any more. lol its not really a big deal, just proves that the textures got nut punched to oblivion.

that's why i have a master plan, A COMPLETELY FLAWLESS PLAN
---
basically ill get the bbq teachable because i got leatherface today, then i will grind up ONE MILLION bloodpoints, then i will spend them on legion and HOPE LIKE HELL i get it. i already leveled up Legion quite a lot so it shouldn't take too many bloodpoints to get BBQ, once i get Tier 3 of that perk on Legion, i will spend the leftover bloodpoints elsewhere. then i will stab stab stab, level level level, stab stab stab, level level level UNTIL EVERYONE IS LEVELED UP
---
you can take my master plan and use it for yourself if you desire to do so
---
Or, ya know, lay off and go look for someone else. It’s really hard to feel bad for killers who can’t find Claudette when all the other odds are stacked in their favor ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Especially since I easily strolled my way to killer rank 5 with no Claudette issues. Meanwhile, if I play survivor and get a pig/doctor/nurse/Meyers, I’m expecting to depip.
---
Love you too.
---
Ohh I see, damn feels bad
---
Because the devs are a set of incompetent cunts
---
what about using evil within 3 on a injured survivor with noed active?
---
Best part is i haven't played AGAINST Plagg once. Also never thought i would have to say this, but... thank you for telling people how to counter you so the surv mains don't pull a freddy &amp; say your way to strong before they learn to play against her
---
But all it did was cause more people to have much longer matchmaking
---
I fucking love it when i play with americans because they are funny af lol
---
They're about the spiderman trilogy 
---
JUST WAITED 10 MINUTES  TO GET INTO A GAME TO GET A BUG WHERE I COULDNT RUN EASILY CAUSE I HAD THE WIGGLE ANIMATION UP THE ENTIRE TIME. NOT EVEN AFTER I GOT PICKED UP IT STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MATCH. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THIS GAME? I JUST WANTED TO PLAY AND INSTEAD I LOST A CAKE, BRAND NEW PART, AND 20 MINUTES OF MY LIFE FOR NO REASON
---
why is there sasha ?
---
it be like that sometimes
---
except sometimes is all the time ever since they brought back this matchmaking 
---
b-but at least the killers are having fun stomping everyone, right?
---
He won't talk - no one talks in this game to keep it international without the use of subtitles. 
---
Last patch made it so you can't see auras while being in a locker anymore, so maybe you should actually come out of the locker and be useful. 
---
&gt; one dropped thier medkit and i just threw up on it
---
The logical thing to do once you see someone drop an item
---
Of course he does. Game is an absolute shitshow but gonna grab that cash!
---
YOU WANNA HAVE A BAD TIME 
---
Same thing happened to me earlier on PS4, a Rank 2 killer against a bunch of Rank 14 survivors, we got absolutely destroyed. One guy literally had like 304 points when he died lol
---
True says monitor and abuse. I like spirit fury and brutal strength, her power can't down til it's corrupt so I try to work around being looped.
---
Bruce Campbell, the actor of Ash, is in all three Sam Raimi Spider-Man films.
---
Welp. Gonna be the first time I spend money on cosmetics I guess lol
---
last game with myers: killer used a black ward, i said fuck. working on shack gen with a p3 claudette. i turn away from the door for 1 seconds &amp; then big daddy just appears. i fucking bolt. myers gets EW2, everyone now knows its a myers that used a black ward. me and another claudette fed him EW. he then got EW3 when chasing a dwight. everyone else accepted their fate &amp; halfway through our chases we just run towards him. turns out we helped him get the chieve. we also had some post game chat about daddy myers destroying us ;)
---
Yea one of our guys ended up lagging out, and the other guy was a low rank and died almost instantly. So there was no chance at winning
---
&gt; not leaving after the exit gates are powered when you're the only survivor
---
i'll admit, i've done this before, but it wasn't nefarious in nature. i legit felt bad for the killer (being an awful killer, myself), so i went back and let them sacrifice me. 
---
Is this better or worse than just one-sided circlejerking
---
Y'know, you're a genuinely positive person, and I hope you have a good day
---
well... i mean freddy just wears a glove tho... although... i guess Hag's hand is still her original hand... hmmmmm.... maybe...
---
This is totally dependant on rank (that is, until the recent update). 
---
But at the end of the day I think ruin is a lot like self-care - totally unnessecary but it makes the player feel better.
---
I need whatever you're smoking
---
were you and the other rank 12 a duo ?
---
Yeah, killers like Trapper naturally don't chase as much when they are effective with their traps. They need to adress this and adjust the chaser category to chasing/catching or whatever.
---
You also shouldn't get punished for using devour hope etc. to kill.
---
In Soviet Russia, Killer hunts Entity.
---
Yeah

---
knew it because i saw the other post earlier
---
True.
---
That's slander!
---
Oh? You want to see your hooked friends? You want to use Object Of Obsession? Well guess what? TTHHIIIRRRDDDD SSEEAAALLLL!!
---
Yeah, I mean the rank 2 killer is kind of annoying, but to set us up with WAY lower ranks then us, that’s just a fucking slap in the face.
---
i think you mean wonderful
---
They region locked matchmaking because people bitched about pings. Now we have 10 min queues on NA. Super...
---
We made it lads. Welcome to weeb town.
---
I believe you typed out the lyrics to Disturbed's "Down with the sickness".
---
Probably did it because of how few people there might be in red ranks now
---
Spawned into the game with the wiggle prompts already on screen. this rendered me completely unable to interact with anything in the game, including gens. whenever I would move and would press A and D to turn directions, the game thought I was trying to wiggle... had to leave the game unfortunately, as I couldn’t interact with anything and I could barely move most of the time :\ 
---
Thanks :)
---
Every trapper resets a trap at shack window...everytime
---
HDR update
---
?! Did they release the model yet?
---
why is meg giving this presentation to other survivors? as if they could use it to begin with
---
lmfao this shit is gold!
---
Dont forget how terrible the pipping system is now too. I wait forever to play, and even if I do two gens, two unhooks, win a chase and escape....i dont freaking pip.
---
The game is pointless to play right now. It's literally just wasting my time. 20 minutes of waiting around for less than 10 minutes of gameplay lately.
---
And the devs dared to fucking bring back this shitty match making. I shouldn't have ever bought this game during the winter Steam sale.
---
Ill make sure to spend my weekend on devs who actually want me to play their game...without willfully breaking it.
---
Daddy Myers love u to
---
Yeah the new pip system is really brutal imo.
---
How is DS good luck?
---
Well, fuck. Now I want a cape for Legion.
---
Damn, I got her perks pretty quickly. Now Nea? Yeah I’m never getting her teachables at this point
---
*silent screaming* well... at least the console players MIGHT know how we've felt since bill came out
---
Hey, it's working for me, giving my time to actually do other things that I *should* be doing during the load times and since I can't get into a game anyway, that just means *more* load times for me to actually achieve things.
---
Don't think my room has been this clean or my homework done this early in *years*. 
---
STBFL is good. I tried Surveillance last night and it's useful. Tenacity is ok if you pair it with Unbreakable, but it's two perk slots. Streetwise is a Nea perk, base game, so I wouldn't waste shards on it. If you want usefulness, get STBFL and Surveillance. 
---
I've said this before, but I think another major issue is a lack of a serious competitive mode. They have to balance this one game mode around their *entire* player base, so anyone from someone just playing a match before work to the basement dwelling (heh heh) pro gamer. So if we WERE to get placement matches, there's a whole issue in and of itself, in that, you needing to rely on randoms of ALL skill levels to get matched with randoms of YOUR skill level is difficult.. I'd say maybe figure out a way to balance that, but I really love the idea of your system. Rewarding players for participating to escaping rather than meeting objective quota for the sake of objective quota is a *really* good idea. Good job! :)
---
Probably basic recolours like everyone has for, usually, their default outfits.
---
Waiiiiit... Ashy Slashy is in the game?!
---
Head cosmetics wouldn't mean changing the face. See the various hair styles, hats and whatnot.
---
No he does not. He hates me. No obsession perks but he has Dying Light, so of course he waits till he finds me to tier up and stab my soul and hope away. 
---
I fucking hate Myers, and I know he hates me to.
---
The same experience. Unfortunately to me they have gone a bit cash hungry latley. With all the cosmetics and auric cells people are purchasing you would think they would put money back into bug fixing process.
---
Instead it seems they are releasing dlc fpr more a money grab. Without patching any previous  content. 
---
To me this is a disgusting habit of the gaming industry that i avoid. This is really the only game ive come across this broken. With a purchase system. 
---
Most other games that did this prviously have failed.
---
Time will tell.
---
OKAY FOLKS ITS TIME FOR A TRIP TO UNCLE KENNYS NAKED PUZZLE BASEMENT, YOU WONT WEAR A SHIRT AND YOU’LL CRY.
---
JUST USED A PINK ADDON + BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS JUST TO GET FROZEN IN 5SEC AFTER THE GAME STARTED
---
Absolutely fucking not.
---
Cant use the left or right on the LS use the RS to turn. I had it and survived, just dont expect to make those plays.
---
I had thought about it. Seeing ash running from a killer like susie just seems stupid.
---
Talking to my publisher now about my DBD erotic novel. 😂
---
You don't know how to play if you can't do greats. Learn your great skill checks and ruin isn't a problem.
---
I'm legit going to be watching the movies and then likely the TV show for the very first time thanks to him coming to DbD as it's got me interested to see what the character is like.
---
yes, they showed in-game footage in the "trailer" 
---
I don't get it, whats wrong? 
---
I’ve been playing both killer nd survivor nd I haven’t lagged out or anything once
---
That'd be wicked! I forget which weapon (?) the horseless headless horseman uses, but just the camera shot I'm imagining of the weapon arcing towards the survivor's neck is awesome. 
---
Ayy look at me lol (I actually like legion but wouldn’t mind if they changed it (tho don’t make it too weak))
---
Could just be a AoD inspired glove, though, which is just a metal knight's hand, there's nothing unique about it really at all.
---
Why not just Work through the ruin?
---
If we can have Billy and LF then why not?
---
BHVR dev Dave Richard said on Twitter that the other costumes will be on the store. Check out @DeviusQC’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1111382591075049475?s=09
---
If Ruin stays up for 1-2 hooks, it has done its job and is worth the perk slot.
---
I would like to have sex woth this post
---
I never said anything of the sort. But it is obvious you didn't graduate high school.
---
Cause it’s a very interactive perk. By doing absolutely nothing, u get more visible auras from failing skill checks, people not doing gens looking for totems, and by the time they cleanse the totem, u hooked everyone to near death
---
For some reason when I started I thought Jake was cool so Prestiged him a couple of times
---
Did they think it was a dbd reference?
---
But was there any specific reason for having Bruce appear in all 3 Spider-Man films? Is it his director trademark? Is Bruce just a fan of Spiderman? Does he make other references to other films if his?
---
You had one iridescent emblem why you crying 
---
Good keep it there 
---
i f\*\*\*\*\*\* love legion its so irritating that everyone hates him 
---
Honestly I've stopped caring about pips all together, I know some people it's all they care about but dang its helped me feel better about playing with what's been going on lately. Now all I care about is not getting rank 1-2 killers even though I'm sitting at around 14-15.
---
Cause eventually the killer will find u or if someone joins ur gen and they can't hit great skill checks ur gen just regresses back. It's annoying.
---
i agree with that 
---
Yes, but only if you also take in an infection on objects time extender add-on as well. That way they have to wait 40-50 seconds to get their item back without getting sick. I usually will use puke to break a survivor, smack em, hook em, and then puke on the item they dropped. Typically right after the unhook they prioritize the fountain cleanse before getting their item, so they get sick again for getting their precious item back.
---
I know BHVR has made some bad choices before but even they wouldn't put something like that in the game.
---
Ideally you shouldn't be working on the same gen as everyone else. Sloppy only adds 6 seconds onto healing which is laughable. 
---
Thanataphobia is alright now but doesn't stop 3 gens from popping at the start of the match 
---
 Thanks for the reply, could you tell me with what are you "agree" exactly ?
---
“This Gen”
---
“NOT THIS GEN”
---
Sam Raimi and Bruce are good friends because of Evil Dead. When Sam Raimi was made to direct Spider-Man he said: “hell ya, i’m gonna put my buddy as a cameo because i fuck with him”. Simple as that. 
---
That’s a good point, though I imagine he’d be much too expensive. 
---
wait what what does the puppet look like
---
How do you not? It’s all in the pants
---
i think this game need some udapte i agree with all you're propositions i hope dbd developers can see it 
---
SHUT. BUBBA IS BETTER I DONT WANNA HEAR IT 
---
RIP Wallet
