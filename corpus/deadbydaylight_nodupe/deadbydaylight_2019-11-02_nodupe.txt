People have been complaining about her for about a year.
---

---
She has no counterplay, just coin-flips. If her phase sound became directional again, I think she'd be much more balanced.
---
literally anything would show you have far someone is this is just plain laziness
---
Ok, thats good to know.
---
Props for actually blurring there names, no one else dous. So basically this was the best possible game it found, its this or no game at all.
---
Looking at your downvotes it's more than just a him thing.
---
I see my post is getting disliked. the difference is that I prefer not playing with immature people. the difference is that I prefer not drinking in front of kids.

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.) 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.**
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule.

I wanted the extra space In case someone tried to save her so I could run them down. I didn’t realise she was on death hook.
---
I normally play hag when i play killer. I dont enjoy killer because its so easy. Hag is the only one I have lvl 50 and i just recently started leveling freddy and cannibal. Im at rank 7 right now with killer. Killers are overpowered in my opinion so....
---
I think they did a pretty good job!
---
Steeve
---
She should either have more of a penalty for not cleansing or have a way to get a shorter corrupt purge without addons
---
I mean the game is rated M for Mature for a reason
---
I was talking about killers who dont span games out and ruthlessly go for kills and dont gain any pips or anything at high ranks....
---
no
---
Exactly what I meant...So basically no point to this post
---
The game had 3 survivors and 2 killers. OP was one of the two killers
---
lol gg man i woulda lost it if Laurie didnt make it out cuz you took it b4 her tho
---
I think so too. It's quite a catchy chorus.
---
It’s cannon now that the entity’s realm is just a government simulation to create the perfect slasher movie
---
I would've killed to see post-game chat
---
He knows to blur names but doesn't know that it's oversaturated content.
---
I thought exactly the same! It turned out to be pretty cool!
---
Grim from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
---
it's a repost... seen this here a million times
---
It's just showing off an odd glitch, I'm curious if anyone else has had this issue.
---
Not every post is meant to be really meaningful, relax.
---
It was a broken match. Why play it? OP did nothing wrong by leaving. The other players probably did the same after realizing it was a two killer glitch.
---
Did anyone save it?
---
Then understand that Survivors are *supposed* to be disadvantaged. The Killer is the power role.
---
Knowing when she phases isn't random, the glass shards glow when she does it.
---
It’s a motherfucking cloaker!!
---
I agree. There is no “economy” in this game.
---
I understand but you're judging before you even know them. I think that's what upsets others
---
You're not going to get a ban. Disconnecting from matches that are broken won't get you in any trouble. There's a difference between unplayable and a rage quit.
---
Ya I don't really care what people say lol. Thank you for the support fellow rational human.
---
Why don't you just... Not answer

Anyone trying to catch some games on Xbox?
---
Nea the killer
---
Because I just want to try and make them not toxic
---
Personally my fav Spirit build is a Hexroulette build using:
---
-Devour Hope
---
-Haunted Ground
---
-Thrill of the Hunt
---
- BBQ (For points finding Survivors after hooking)
---
It's not her strongest but when it works ohhhh it's fun to get 3 or 5 stacks on Devour Hope
---
Well you could've put that in the caption (asking if anyone had this issue.)
---
but its not fun when so many killers are being rude for no reason and not going for longer matches trying to hostage a game or get 4ks ads quick as possible its a waste of time for everyone. if the killers actually had to try it would be more fun but they dont.
---
I didn't know
---
Never works just ignore it
---
No, and the haste effect showed up for me as well . I'll try to replicate it sometime but it's not that big of a deal.
---
Ok I’ll try
---
Yeah tbh for demo just use a more powerful perk for the mid game so noed doesn’t waste a spot for you

 Instead of doing the hag thing, What I do usually is to fake that im going to trap so they leave and I get a free hit/down.I never thought about trapping on tall grass the way You said, its a really smart idea :D
---
No-one cared who she was until she put on the mask
---
ya he has it selected it bugged for me one time as well and my other friend but not 3 times in a row lol
---
I just prestiged him so I don't have many unlocked yet, trying to prestige 3 Nancy, Steve and demogorgon so even with double bloodpoints it's a bit of a grind.

This is very true the grind is real good luck!
---
You should take a photo of you cloaked.
---
10/10 cosplay!
---
Look out! It’s Phillip Ojomo!
---
Yeah idk.. they feel like it's fun to ruin it which start a toxic cycle
---
They abuse haddonfield infinite with an offering and BL then that killer will use Mori and the best add ons and the cycle continue
---
It's a known thing. It will probably be fixed in a few weeks. Or months god forbid. But seeing as it may cut into sales because people won't buy it if they don't get there cells back I can see them fixing this quickly.
---
Are you ever gonna stop bitching though? Because you *still* don't have to buy the rift. Just wondering if you're aware of that or still denying it.
---
...what? Literally anything in the entire universe can be a metaphor. It's clear there isn't much point in trying to reason with you if you don't even understand basic language skills..
---
1. Even if you can see that she is phasing, the random guess coinflip thing is about the fact that you have to commit to one side of a pallet or window, hoping that she won't end up reappearing on that same side. Running or walking away are not a viable option in the majority of these situations, especially against Spirits that actually know how to listen to the game, use short-burst Phases, or abuse collision.
---
2. My main problem with that is Stridor. That makes Spirit rather oppressive, since with it she can reliably audio-track all the time, even against healthy survivors and Iron Will. But yes, since Spirit is supposed to be about predicting and guessing, the fact that you can simply hear survivors defeats that aspect of her gameplay in a lot of scenarios. Maybe she should hear the phasing audio herself, at a lowered volume, obscuring more nuanced survivor noises. And maybe Stridor shouldn't counter Iron Will, or at least make that interaction about the frequency of cries of pain, rather than volume.
---
3. There are a ton of scenarios where you can (ab)use collision intentionally, such as checking which side of a pallet or window a survivor is at after vaulting. This regularly happens so fast that the survivor can't get away from the pallet or window even if they are good enough to play around collision. And the times where you accidentally benefit from collision are arguably even worse. There's really no reason it should be in the game.
---
4. Freddy is pretty strong now, and from a public games perspective, indeed kinda overtuned. His snares are very strong chase tools, since he can spam multiple of them without slowing down. You basically cannot loop pallets against a Freddy that knows how to use snares, and if the pallet is not a very safe pallet, you can't even play it once it is down against snares, which sucks because killers can force survivors to stay at pallets, and also have Bloodlust. Fake pallets are also kinda BS, since they are often a random luck aspect. And then he can teleport to generators, which is all the more disruptive with Weasel, his lullaby and Dream World visuals make it very hard to make out where he is, and he has the undetectable status for free, hard-countering Borrowed Time. I don't think he needs to be nerfed, apart from maybe putting a 5-or-so-second cooldown on setting snares, but it's not like that killrate is coming out of nowhere.
---
If you have 5 players of equal experience and skill and with comparable loadouts and comparable levels of actually trying to win on a server, then yes, the game is usually more-so in the favour of survivors (though not nearly as much as people make it out to be either, all the less so given certain maps, killer characters and add-ons/offerings). But in public play, the game is killer sided, since the 4 survivors are only very very rarely actually all good. Again, the global statistics show that even the weakest killer characters have average kill rates of 60+%, and good killer players have no issues keeping kill rates of 80+%. Some killer characters can very well do with buffs, but others certainly need some rebalancing, as do some add-ons and Moris. Spirit is definitely the prime candidate for adjustments, and she will still be strong enough to win the majority of games in the hand of a competent player - again, even a killer like Legion is capable of that.
---
I like it. Honestly tho I'm tired of licensed killers and survivors, give me something original that I earn instead of pay for.
---
I would be fine with a collision to survivors while phasing chase but there definitely should be something else, Maybe once she emerges from her phasing session she isn't able to see scratch marks for 5 seconds? Because she can see them while we run, in a chase you'll never be far enough to escape her pursuit and if you run she will just pursue you. With the delay on scratch marks once she exits phasing survivors could use that time to make a run for it to break LOS quicker and at a distance where you're not totally fucked
---
how am I judging? I don't want to influence kids that are underage to drink.
---
Welp, after seeing people abusing haddonfield infinite, using every single thing to make sure you won't kill anyone by any means. Even sabotaging event hooks just to be an ass.. yeah, I'm gonna try my best to ruin anyone's game
---
Hmm strange. Didn’t get the impression op was trying to make you laugh.
---
That's just Franklin's Demise IV: All survivors lose their items, regardless of the outcome of the trial
---
I never denied that
---
Again with the strawman. God damn, your argument still shit huh
---
Holy shit. I've been having my fair share of bugs but that takes the cake. To be fair they did warn us it would be buggy, and when BHVR tells you something will be buggy it's gonna be a bug with a game hidden in it lol.

I can’t speak for other people. But you’re probably right, some people do use the term to rub it in. But that’s a problem with their attitude and has nothing to do with you, how you played or anything else.

---
2 months ago
---
let me make a list based on what I know (i don't know all of them)
---
Trapper: Bloody Coil, Any trap bag, Fast trap setting (but only the higher tiers of it)
---
Wraith: His Ultra-rare addons are the best 2 he has
---
Hillbilly: Carburetor tuning guide, Primer Bulb (or sparkplug but less so)
---
Nurse: idk man, i never played her, plus she just got changes
---
Huntress: Iridescent Head, Infantry Belt (toxic tho)
---
Myers: Tombstone, fragrent tuft of hair
---
Leatherface: Same as Hillbilly
---
Ghostface: Power recovery, just stack them (chewed pen, address book, matchbook)
---
Freddy: ???
---
Plague: ??? I think the apples might be good since people don't cleanse much
---
Legion: ???
---
Doctor: Iridescent King
---
Hag: ???
---
Clown: redhead's finger
---
Spirit: I haven't played as her, but I'm pretty sure Prayer Beads &amp; her ultra-rares are the best (based on the hate for them)
---
Demogorgon: ???
---
I mean isn't Ghostface litteraly an edgy teen too?
---
You literally compared survivors to terrorists. That's childish, the fact you don't think it is proves you're even more childish than i thought before.
---
We need another, kind sir. Token Expired :(
---
yeah I think so too but the devs seem to really like "exceptions" and try to keep things consistent
---
Might help if you actually, dunno, posted the sign......?
---
No, I'm Jeff Johansen!
---
I wonder how quick Otz will finish this one
---
Quick, buy everything! It's all free!
---
Its happened for the third consecutive time. I didnt bother recording it. Seems consistent. Ch3ck your BP after the match and see if it matches.
---
Mask says julie but the hair says susie. Am confused
---
I'm outta here
---
When I play survivor I almost always run Spine Chill
---
to be fair it's been outdated for a long time I suppose. never worked on T1 myers despite that being a stealth "ability"
---
imo it should be the only aura reading that works on undetectable but maybe that's difficult for them to do
---
I'll take it, I didn't even notice it was stripes...
---
Developer mode?
---
It also wears down your keys/buttons
---
and dc does count so if they do dc your not fucked
---
The killer mustve been Amanda
---
That’s nice , thx
---
It's worth noting that when I entered a game, I spawned on Red Forest and it said Lampkin Lane, Haddonfield
---
Upon entering the archives after that game it put me in level 4 of the tome.
---
Entity pleased
---
Being Otz is a prerequisite for this challenge
---
Then I guess you're just arguing for no reason.
---
No, you're Jeff Johansen
---
This dude sounds like he wants to hate himself, and this is coming from a Trapper main
---
What if we fall into both of the bottom? I've played probably four or five games as a survivor, spent probably 10 minutes setting on the 'searching for match' screen when I tried playing killer a few times now.
---
Jake here to say dont be toxic play the game and be respectful to your team and to the killer, they try their hardest to make the game fun (most of the time)
---
You don’t need it anymore, but keep in mind undetectable also makes T1 Myers vulnerable to Spine Chill now, so Spine Chill counters Mirror Myers pretty hard
---
&gt;He has no ability to shut down a chase.
---
And legion does? lol Again you're missing my point. Legion doesn't do anything objectively better than wraith to make them a better killer overall. All legion is better as is having survivors stay injured. Which he can't follow-up on to end faster anymore so its pointless.
---
whats not clicking whats not clicking invalidation
---
Making it ultra rare and some kind of debuff would be sufficient, could replace fathers glasses.
---
Sorry, I replied to your main post above. But this.. this was genuinely hilarious
---
the serum is tied to the rift, not the halloween event itself, you can earn serum until the rift closes.
---
They change everything its almost a new killer
---
I thought your arm was deformed in the weirdest way and then realised it was just her hair covering a bit 🤦‍♀️
---
If herobrine became a killer I would instantly die irl
---
how are they not overpowered its rare that a group of survivors are coordinated when youre playing solo all of these excuses are like perfect game scenarios my only point was that there should be a cap to tuft of hair and you still got butthurt make it make sense
---
Yes, its very old
---
I just started playing her and holy shit the fatigue gives me a headache, i am surprised no one complains about it. I'm sure there is a better way to visualize it without making you feel dizzy for a whole match. But she is super fun when you manage to pull off a blink attack! super hard indeed. You have to get a feel for the blink charge to know where you end up. One question tho, is the fatigue longer after double blinking/blink attacking?
---
Well they’ll just mori you if they want you dead. This is just a worse version
---
It penalizes points on the Chaser emblem. Makes sense because camping is the opposite of chasing.

This reminds of a game from last week. We were playing against a plague and it was just me and a Meg left. I'm being chased for a solid five minutes when I finally lose her. 
---
Then I try looking for the hatch since our team did a bad job of doing gens. 
---
After a few minutes of no hatch and no team mate, I finally figured it out. She was waiting for my death.
---
I heard the birds and headed to the closest locker and there she was, but she wouldn't come out. I kept doing the " come here" hand animation and she just refused. So, since I heard the killer coming, I started pointing at the locker. Plague kept looking back and forth between the locker and me and to my great surprise, took the Meg and hooked her. I ran the other direction and was able to escape!
---
Five clowns, players that DC when the killer doesn’t want to farm
---
What kind of fuckin spaghetti code. . .
---
Blinding the killer whilst picking them up doesn’t mean get a flashlight save. You can blind them 100% of the time when picking up a survivor if you do it early.
---
 Link should be updated. :)
---
Have a good one. 👍🏼
---
Not that hard, just takes a few games and smart traps. Just go auto haven and place he invisible traps
---
Majority of Wraiths always use add ons that make the bell silent, making it silent by default would not only buff him but allow more variation in play. This probably wouldn't be enough, but its a start.
---
Don’t you end up getting like 15-20k blood points for bringing a mori and killing everyone with it isn’t it better to just play the game normally
---
Yes
---
You’re doing god’s work
---
almost certain he uploaded it himself/through an agency. i agree you shouldn't put things on the internet you wouldn't want your family to see, but at the same time we don't know his situation. might've needed the money.
---
Whoever took the pic is a survivor behind Laurie. Laurie got in front of the 3rd person camera and pointed for the selfie effect
---
Unfair are the keys you only have to do bones
---
*gurgles in hag*
---
I'd make it so his shimmer is not visible across the map (make it only visible inside 32 or 24 m) and maybe increase his movement speed when invisible a bit to make it an actual map pressure tool
---
He needs a buff for sure, I would like to see yellow windstorm as basekit since he is really slow without any windstorms while beeing clocked, I cant even play without it anymore. Your idea also sounds interesting but it might be to easy to get hits then afterwards coz the survivor is slow downed and you also get your sprint boost for uncloaking.
---
Attention that they never received at a young age.
---
you can also just look down, you can still navigate and not get blinded. This clip is recovered from an old hard drive so its 9 or so months old lol, i was far from being the average scrub back then but i have still learned a lot since then.
---
Yeah, default shock distance is 25% more, because its basically nothing now.
---
Also, switching between shock and hit should either be instant or constant.
---
Otherwise, I see no issues with him.
---
Yeah I get that I like original chapters too
---
It’s the hill
---
24
---
Thanks for the effort. Some of them seem impossible to finish. I guess by that time players will farm with each other for the challenges extensively.
---
Ignore the trash ones
---
I've lost items and even pips before after the killer DC's. Probably why you lost the medkit
---
How many challenges have you done
---
My bad fellas, didn't know this was well known already. Took down the post!
---
I think I have about 8 left
---

---
Oof. Really wish i could have seen it.
---
Very cool!
---
I think he only meant the stagger reduction not the speed boost
---
I have 12 left and I'm tier 13 how do you level up so fast?
---
Here's a straw poll just for fun:
---
https://strawpoll.com/6g25hgf9
---
How did you level up so fast
---
&gt;don't get your feelings hurt over things that don't matter
---
Says the guy who feels the need to call out an adult, for wanting to play with other adults
---
By leveling up I think, I’ve been playing a lot because of the event
---
You can get enough stuff for 2 full outfits so you could get 1 killer and 1 survivor
---
The free like 9 or so tiers anf i finished all the challenges
---
I'll add you when my power is back on, my steam is julesJerm and I'm rank 4 solo
---
It always appears as a teachable as soon as you become the rank for it. If you don't grab it it reenters the loot pool of perks that randomly show up.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Make his belly jiggle around more
---
GG is good though if they add EZ to it then it's toxic. It just means they're saying it was an easy game and that the killer was shit which obviously doesn't feel that good
---
Bumper billy intensifies
---
Do you think it’s ok to message someone only to be negative ?
---
I’ve been playing with no problems for weeks. Just played 5 or 6 games in a row last night in a full squad with no issues.
---
The entities always blocked windows.
---
Normally I get pissed when a player tbags another survivor, but that nea deserved it
---
if they say ez its just toxic just like when killers do it
---
exactly what i think! i always say gg to a killer, even a gg wp if i had a fun fair game.
---
That didn't happen on Haddonfield. I don't mean spamming the vault button.
---
yeah, straight up, i’ve had it both ways
---
I'm at 12 or 11
---
Did you buy the wrong dlc?
---
Bro stop with the Ricardo memes, they aren't funny anymore
---
definitely not, i really wanted to see what the community had to say about it, i’ve never said gg ez, i have joked about it before though lol
---
Didnt know david was free?
---
I don't have to restart. If I get the host unreachable error or whatever but its still trying to connect I can open bloodweb and then the store. Once the store opens I can go back with b to try again. I also get errors that take me back to main dbd menu alot.
---
2 by default and smaller spawn between them, some dead zone spawns are not ever worth going to get.
---
Windows always get blocked after being vaulted 3 times in a chase
---
Nice job,  good to see toxic players get what they deserve.
---
And it’s a invite so more ppl are acting like dicks just saw a killer carry a survivor half way across the map to the hatch just to close it when the survivor got close to it. And seen survivors teabagging for no reason at all it’s sad
---
Yeah
---
Still waiting for noob3 foot reveal
---
I would call ghostface by his real name if he was the one from the movie Scream. The original character is cool, but I don't like the name.
---
Another example of an Adam Francis player being a bro for his teammates
---
I don’t see why he wasn’t just downloaded like everyone else
---
Legend says there is still a secret group of players who all together just don't bitch about everything but the legend also reads that they may have gone extinct in reasons years
---
he was horrible for new players to face, everyone else figured out the counter is the same as it is now, spread out and it was BAU gen rushing. He could also spam his power on the same person without it breaking.
---
Just checked, Tru3 has a devotion of 9. This is OP’s screenshot
---
He recored it with an organization called jock butt or something like that, nowadays he lives somewhere out of brazil with his 13-15 yo son he knows about the video, the meme and all that stuff, but he does not like it as he said in an email
---
1)How do you know devs are unaware?
---
2) this is *not* "BHVR Official". This flair is misleading.
---
Why?
---
I'm tier 8 right now still have some survivor challenges to do which will bump me up a bit but currently I'm tired from 6 hours of DbD. The plus side is there's so much time.
---
Was there a recent buff or is this referring to his older buff?
---
Nea is fucking killing me
---
17
---
That’s your opinion, these sorts of hatchet hits have existed in the game for a long time and are very well known.

Mouse works fine in other games and during general use. It's also less than two months old.
---
He posted a pic of him at twitchcon with him wearing slippers
---
You're pressing LB right? I kept on hitting rb when I first started because I was used to having to hold down rb and then lb to do gems and stuff.
---
That’s like saying, why don’t your just unhook yourself after I’ve hooked you.
---
So very cool and good 👍👍👍
---
Yes whispers works on spirit.
---
You mean freddy? I enjoyed the first version of him more, now its just spam snares/pallets and hope the survivors run into it, but I like his mobility via the gen teleport. He was fun for me at first but after a while it got boring. 
---
But I have to say aswell I get bored of the same killer when I play them more then twice in a row thats why I always rotate through all the killers when I play killer.
---
Huntress would be also a good choice, you can have fun with across the map hatchets, its always satisfying to hit them.
---
I just played a game where I had a lvl 14 and 20 Ashs, a lvl 9 nancy, the killer was lvl 12, and I was lvl 8
---
Try chasing that survivor again I dare you.
---
I want  a massage....
---
I personally use BBQ, Thrilling Tremors and Pop. Thr other slot gets changed out based on what I'm facing, I use haunted grounds against maps and devour hope when there's not map or nurses
---
Ngl doe, little kids are half the DBD fanbase
---
Idk why but I wanna see it
---
Your comparison is nowhere near the same thing as being blinded and not looking up because of a lack of brain cells.
---
Wrong, because IM the worst artist in the world!
---
Woah thats actually weird, do you live in the U.S? I live in one of the most populated areas in the US and still manage to have major issues in this game. I feel liike its an issue related to Xbox Live AND Dead by Daylight.
---
Yeah. Infectious Fright is great and so is the gen blocking perk(i don’t remember the name). Other one isn’t as good though as it’s super situational.
---
The trick is to smile big, and laugh often
---
Oof. I had a game where it was me, at rank 12, nancy, at rank 15, meg, at level 20, bill, at rank. Fucking, one. And Claudette at rank 12. Like wtf behavior.
---
About to be 26
---
I main killer. Flashlights are not toxic.
---
I'll bring it if I have a quest, or the previous match was toxic.
---
I live in the Western US, and the issues are probably more Xbox related than dbd related. Tons of my friends have been having general Xbox issues.
---
They posted on Twitter today about a different more non-game-breaking issue, which means they are putting effort into fixing that instead of these more important errors. I honestly think they have no clue because they don't play it on Xbox. Its official that they are unaware.
---
Noob3?
---
I mean im not disagreeing with you, but thats if your assuming that Nea did sometibg that game and if OP is salty. Im going based off of the fact that the killer picked up that on the fact that the Nea wasn't doing anything due to her not being hooked any other time.
---
I think it's interesting how people attribute certain characteristics to a corresponding character model when in reality all characters have the characteristics. There's no evidence that a certain type of people with a certain type of personality choose a particular survivor, and when you throw in the fact that many people switch survivors frequently, it just shows how bullshit the whole theory is. I think it's an interesting look on human behavior
---
That’s not toxic that’s you not looking up lol
---
I didn't get credit for the first match that I played after activating, 25,000+ BPs. Then my next three matches were against camper/tunnelers, less than 15,000 BPs in those matches combined.  Ultimately took me eight matches.
---
Wait, what does it mean when people say free tiers? How do you get them?
---
May have something to do with being the last to leave
---
If you want it to look like crap maybe. Besides all the materials were bought in bulk. If you divide the materials by cost individually I think it was liks... $15? I plan on making more.
---
Calm down Candyman
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I will see everyone ready'd up, but some of them might not actually be in the lobby. Sometimes we will all be Ready'd up, but then ONE of us gets put in the killer lobby. Its just a mess, generally only fixable by restarting.
---
Looks like they were just scared to take you off. What rank are you if ya dont mind me asking
---
But I good legion 😔
---
There already is camp penalties.
---
Yeah but we're talking about their ability to receive a bat to the head here. Not their lifting ability.
---
You did all the challenges?
---
Plus it's hard to be a master of your own dreams so you could hit freddy.
---
Blue hair nea
---
Keep in mind that not everyone plays SWF and that with killer tactics such as tunneling and camping insta healing is sometimes the only counter to prolong a game for yourself. 
---
Also insta heal just means you have to hit someone an extra time. Big deal. Killers have plenty of perks to buy time and counter this. Specifically hex ruin to slow gen progression and NOED to one hit survivors once gates are powered. 
---
Imo I agree with you that insta heals don’t need to exist BUT with the overflow of Moris ALL THE TIME. It’s problematic and you can only go on the hook once and then if you’re tunneled you’re fucked. 
---
Sorry but just because there are 4 survivors doesn’t mean the killer should be able to get rid of survivor perks to help counter and survivor for themselves when the killer is already inherently faster, stronger, and has a shit ton of perks to counter survivor perks. 
---
Again just get rid of Moris. They’re problematic as fuck.
---
I'm tier 43. No idea why or how. Started at level 25 and didn't buy any tiers.
---
I'm going on the fact that OP refuses to show the scoreboard, OP's other comments, and the fact that the clip is cut to the exact point that shows exactly what OP wants us to see.
---
IF OP has this video, and screenshots of post-chat, they should certainly be able to show the scoreboard. Instead, they deflect and ignore and avoid any question relating to proof regarding Nea doing nothing all game.
---
OP has no proof. OP is full of it until proven otherwise. Burden of proof is on OP to back up his claim. Until then, he's the asshole who's working with the killer.
---
Also - I've gone many games not being hooked, doesn't mean I wasn't doing anything.
---
Reported, hue hue hue
---
# probably didn’t show up and he thought it didn’t work.
---
Yea i had a purple styptic which does the same thing really except you have to mend afterwards. But the syringe which i haven't used yet just seems like a waste at this point. and no lmao if they nerf keys im retiring.
---
Yessir!
---
Well keys are a free escape lol
---
Oh, you started at 25. I only started at 7. It's a bug that happened due to the PTB progression carrying over and the devs just said everyone can keep their progression.
---
I really love the human element of killers. One of the reasons I love this game.
---
Ive already seen that like i said its situational not good unless your on demogorgon or maybe even freddy butt only if theres a gen near the basement
---
They are still really good
---
Hol' up, he has 5 other names?
---
Am I missing something here?
---
for sure 💗
---
Right on!
---
It's moments like this that make this game so special  to me. I'm glad he didn't DC before he could get his full serving of justice!
---
Entity: places Ashley Williams, Bill overbeck, Laurie Strode and John Wick against a killer.
---
Also entity: how could those survivors do this to my boy
---
 How survivors look throwing down pallets against Legion in Feral Frenzy: 🤡
---
I just kinda threw out a number but yeah they basically call him by a different name every movie lol
---
Ye I just played an iridescent head belt huntress mori with ruin noed and nurses and she got like 15k bps and we all escaped with 1 dc and all of got like 25k so I’m assuming the people who bring the most toxic stuff usually aren’t the best
---
Coffs in Clown?
---
"Do you know what t**ime it is?**"
---
Could you play that backwards? I think I heard the voice of Satan in there...
---
Killers need more BP because they lose add-ons every match.  They also earn more because they're always the last person in the match.
---
Survivors did receive a slight buff with the last patch.  Wiggle points, pallets in chase, DCs, ect.
---
We also have Archives giving a little boost.
---
With that being said, I think survivors could use a slight BP buff.
---
Hey guys what's your thoughts on Quentin mains like are they good, helpful, nice or are they dickheads?    P.S. I'm a Quentin main
---
Nurse can teleport lmao, you ain't touching her
---
My favorite thing is when the survivors invite me to xbox party and we legit just talk about what we're doing and stuff. Makes the game a really cool and fun experience.
---
Yeah if you camp you'll lose against any half-decent team.
---
Since when?
---
I like how everything he points at is garbage, really accurate
---
If I got the Clown I would also get Freddy and Legion because Freddy with ruin and pgtw is God tier and bamboozle Legion isn't broken at all
---
It's great they can still joke around after people just constantly freaking out about everything all the time at them. I'd be drinking all day every day.  
---
Props to the dev team.
---
He sounds like the author of that book in rick and morty
---
Imagine waking up late at night to the sound of thunder. You go downstairs and find someone broke your totem. You search and search for whoever did it, armed with a bat, but you eventually give up because you couldn't find anyone. Tired, you go back to bed.
---
Then you hear a buncha loud crows perched on your wardrobe.
---
thats funny bc i also went against iri head huntress with her meta perks, no mori but she did camp. we were all about to escape when she dced, a rank 2 killer too 😂
---
Killer loses Chaser Emblem for staying near the hook when it isn't necessary.
---
If Survivors are smart they can complete 3 gens before the hooked Survivor dies which makes them get less Bloodpoints and makes getting a good Gatekeeper, Devout, and Malicious much more difficult.
---
Sadly console doesn’t have game chat lol
---
Anyone who calls the clown Kenneth cannot be trusted
---
Secret offering. The only secret offering are Shrouds, Memento Mori's and Splinters.
---
Does it feel good to always have to down someone? Just because its reddit doesn't mean you have to be a rude entitled douche.
---
Did you play any custom games that day?
---
Can we talk about how the last tome level is literally impossible
---
Sorry for going too gast over them, bur I can only record this with the Xbox "record what happened" feature which only records for a few seconds. 
---
I really hope they change the challenges because a lot seem pretty hard and "Last minute hero" &amp; "No one escapes the endgame" seem pretty much impossible.
---
Nice new Clown cosmetic! 👍
---
Yeah but she's also hanging there and I have a bat so she'll give me pinata smashing energy
---
lol but she has by far the most adorable voice
---
They are only easy since it is rift level 1. I have completed all of the level 1 challenges so it shows me the level 4 challenges for some reason, and they are MUCH harder. 
---
Some include "Blind the killer while they are carrying a survivor 2 times in a single trial.", "Sacrifice 3 survivors to the entity during the endgame collapse while using NOED.", "Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement in a single trial.", and "Safely unhook 3 survivors during the endgame collapse in a single trial." 
---
The rest besides those aren't too hard but these ones are pretty crazy.
---
It really is bullshit. Seems that these hits favour the killer, even though there are servers. Some of this coding must be client side, as in the killer has shit ping, but because it apparently hit on his end it goes through. Total dog shit game at this point.
---
but what was your team doing?
---
They should just get rid of the turn when traps activate, its super annoying.
---
Did you buy chance by ruin at some point in the past from the shrine? That would explain the lack of it being teachable
---
@David the loudboi
---
I mean, this is technically reportable (working with the killer)  
---
HOWEVER  
---
I'd do it. Just letting someone die on hook, or worse, bleed out, is lame af
---
Its also a lot easier to play survivors bc your goal is a lot simpler. Survive. As killers we have to play on your time and play around you. An instaheal could change the game dramatically from 1 play. Moris require you to get hooked and downed again. If you go down twice you deserved to die. Plus ebony moris are pretty rare. I got 1 in ever 20 ish levels
---
I did but I still don't see the appeal. Do you still have the concept?
---
Nope
---
Looks like Vigo get drug addicted🤔
---
so what you’re telling me is “just counterplay a killer that has very little counterplay” 
---
lol ok
---
I think mine was rank 3 or 4
---
11
---
"complete this challenge in a single trial" means you must do the objective listed in one trial.
---
Cannon is too confusing for me
---
I think it’s pretty biased to say it’s easier to play survivor. Both survivor and killer have difficulties. It’s not easier to be one. I think it’s pretty ignorant of you to claim that insta healing once could dramatically change the game while getting to kill someone after a first hook doesn’t dramatically change the game?? Lol. If it benefits the killer it’s not gamechanging I guess. 
---
Moris are more common than you think.
---
Have you bought hags other teachables? If not, you could get them and see if it makes a difference
---
I’m convinced anybody that defends insta heals has never consistently played killer at red ranks
---
*Lucid dreaming has entered the chat*
---
There's no transfer available.
---
There will always be a bigger bat.
---
I know this is a repost, but this is still funny
---
No not Spirit she’s my main :(
---
What am I looking at exactly?
---
Yeah the higher the reward the harder the challenge. They shouldn't all be gimmies IMO.
---
Insta-heals are an extra hit, which isn't a problem at all.
---
4x Insta-heals, 4x Decisive Strikes, 4x Exhaustion Perks, 4x Adrenalines, and an occasional Borrowed Time is way too much to deal with for a vast majority of killers. It's the reason why you see mostly Nurses and Spirits in top levels, because very few other Killers can catch up to Survivors a potential 8+ times each.
---
Even two Insta-heals was enough to completely kill any momentum the Killer had gotten up to that point, and one Syringe could drastically change the game if used at the right moment.
---
Insta-heals are not comparable to Moris. Insta-heals are basically the equivalent of letting the Killer just randomly decide to stop for a second to make you Exposed without any sort of prior build up or work put into it.
---
“I know what killer we’re playing against!”
---
“Who?”
---
“This one” *trips bear trap*
---
“Goddamnit Jim every fucking time”
---
yeah, sometimes i’ve met pretty cool survivors, didn’t realize i had a four man once and i just invited them to party and said as soon as i got into the match it didn’t really feel like playing so they could just do whatever they want ahahah

Since it takes 2 minutes to die on hook snd only 1minute and 20 seconds to do a gen. 3 people in separate gens finish 3 gens before the person is even dead. Then they can focus on unhookinh

Perks get reworked all the time. So maybe skip the useless ones untill you've got most the ones you want. And then come back and buy those teachables. Who knows maybe they get reworked to something awesome one day.

---
If both sides are farming and the killer doesn't stop you from popping the event gens its common courtesy to return the favor and not sabo his hooks.
---
honestly out of all of the licensed killers people have talked about the only one I actually want is the xenomorph
---
Nancy is a pretty funny way to spell Steve.
---
Oh. I thought since they were all in the same leak, they would come out at the same time as the Myers cosmetic for example.
---
It's a good combo. Pop is one of Freddy's best perks. On top of that he's just an extremely high tier killer
---
IMO, low tire killers are generally bad at the game, but so are top tier
---
Saying EZ is pretty much always toxic, I can't see how anyone would think otherwise? It's obviously shit talking your opponent.
---
It's rank 1 noed not sure if that is involved or not. Anyways wasn't trying to spark a shit storm. Just telling people about a bug I encountered.
---
You better not see your putrid semen, it's No Nut November
---
Nerf keys as well then sure
---
for real
---
While I get what you are trying to say, I will have to disagree and say it always depends on the player. Some are carried by the character’s strength for sure, while others can even amplify it to become more than just a monster
---
It says Type2 but I don’t really know what that means.
---
HERE COMES THE TRAPPER! 🎶
---
I think they should have a 5 or so second channel, but I’m not focused on keys rn
---
Oh i thought that was a dietary thing :(
---
Comes out the 6th of November.
---
Hmmm, so there probably isn't an actual issue with your Nat type. Weird...
---
It's more of a last resort
---
Most people aren't but it's because they "don't like the building" and typically got bodied by a more skilled player. They added skill based matchmaking, and added bots to new/bad players games to help them get better and since the game is so wildly popular Youtube has tons of tutorials on building. I really enjoy Fortnite, it's the most mechanical shooter on the market (even popular FPS player Shroud says so) with a healthy competitive community.
---
Need instadown add-ons as well then sure.
---
great, now just wait until everyone around you is dead so you can use it
---
A finite amount of corrupt puke would be a better answer. Wont have to worry about time, and will require a little more skill to make sure they arent wasted.
---
But not everyone’s a blendette lol.  I mean they’ll leave the injured person JUST to tunnel me.  that’s the levels of stupid it’s at
---
Ebonies cost a fuck ton of blood points and hooking a red rank Survivor twice is nigh impossible most games
---
Just fucking remove ebonies. Stop putting them in bloodwebs, do the same for keys and Instaheals. Then this debate FINALLY dies
---
Not quite, there are a few things you can't do until you turn 21, adoption is one of these things.
---
Yeah, killers would complain that it works too well
---
I never really counted perks that are god tier on some killers but trash tier on other. When I think situational I think”it’s completely out of your hand if it will be good or not”
---
FUCK YES.

Imagine we had a map that featured a long ass spiral staircase.

Lmao, this actually comes from a German rapper who used to dress up as Spongebob, mostly making fun of other rappers (making parodies an such).

He was called SpongeBozz with his partner being called Patrick Bang (a homage to Farid Bang).

High tier killers also count as high skilled players so I laugh WITH YOU HAHA!

I dunno, it just doesn't... *sound* right. It's Bubba Sawyer, y'know? Then you got names like *Jedidiah* or *Thomas Hewitt.* They just aren't right. Bubba is... Bubba. Gotta go with the original.

your bar is upside down homie

If I was about that life, nothing would stop me either.
---
Keep on keeping on my guy.
---
No, that's a moral statement from you. Not a fact one
---
Both activate when the gens are done. **doesn't matter** if you did good or not, they activate at that time. You might have done fuck all and still get adrenaline mid chase when your team mates were doing gens. Same thing
---
Both grants an extra health state change and speed boost. One temporary the other 'permanent'
---
Adrenaline cannot be denied. Noed can be denied before it's activation or after that, being an hex
---
Adrenaline can be used by all 4 survivors, granting 4 health states if they were previously injured, by just having it. To use noed you still have to go through chase and hit the survivor
---
All these reasons make noed not a good perk and as proof of that, people at red ranks don't use it. For **adrenaline** quite the opposite, it's used **especially** in red ranks
---
You think that  
---
Elsa Jean, Chloe Foster, Karma RX, Dakota Skye, Holly Hendrix, Jade Baker and Riley Reid **aren't** a threat?!

Why did this avoid the link-train? :(

You did 62 levels???

I don't disagree however. It's very light. Like people need to have some thiccer skin and not let douche bags ruin their day
---
I think I'd rather see a Predator than a Xenomorph in the game personally. I think it would be interesting to see a technologically advanced killer for once. I'd love having them both though.

Cmon now. I play survivor and killer and playing survivor is 100x more relaxing than playing killer. If you make one misstep as killer the entire team will take advantage of you. Most of the top streamers who play both say the same thing too
---
God candy man would make such a good killer

When you hit the survivor but auto-aim snaps you to where they were instead
---
This wins the dead by daylight reddit
---
Not saying that you aren’t but tbh you really sound like you have never been higher than rank 10 if you think that killers don’t slug often in lower ranks and that it’s a waste of time. It’s very beneficial to players who actually know how to apply pressure. Don’t get me wrong. It’s not always the best move but it definitely isn’t a waste of time or as useless as you make it out to be
---
13th I think, but either way it's in the early teens of November. 
---
The exact dates for II, III and IV are in the news post regarding the Archives. I just remember IV is on December 18th, I think III was around the 27th of November.

Oh yeah, it's gamer time.

I was low-key expecting an "ahaha" 😔

Yes. They (along with keys and pre-nerf insta heals) are REALLY unfun to play against. I wouldn't shed a single tear if they were all nerfed.
---
Highjacking top comment:
---
OP has dodged every question relating to proving the Nea did nothing all game.
---
OP has this video, after-game chat with both Nea AND the killer, but no scoreboard? Suspect.
---
On top of that, Killer chat shows that Killer purposely helped OP to kill the Nea because "Nea was teabagging all game." Which means Nea *was* doing something if they were chased by killer enough to piss the killer off.
---
[Chat in Question](https://imgur.com/gallery/LPgq6RS)  (If OP deletes these images, we know 100% he's full of it)
---
OP's claim that Nea did nothing all game is bogus without proof. Nea sees the last survivor drop and be slugged. Against a Hag, that's obvious bait. And since we see 1 Gen left, it could be plausible that Nea already had eyes on the Hatch and was waiting for that. Most any survivor would know to lay low and hope for hatch instead of trying to get halfway across the map against Hag Traps and turn a 3k into a 4k. 
---
Don't believe OP and his lies.
---
I did, and I repaired the gens with the jack o lanterns on them. Still no bp
---
Thank you for enlightening me
---
I guess because it's new? I honestly don't know. Maybe a lot of the people who bought scoops are also the kind of people who tbag and act toxic so they got associated. 
---
The other theory is that killers are evil bastards who target the new cosmetic because they assume it's a new player, but I'd prefer not to think that.
---
Thank you good sir
---
I hardly see how that's any of your business!
---
There’s a difference between difficult and impossible. Some of these can’t be done even if everything you do goes right because they rely way too much in other players actions.
---
Yeah I can’t help there, I main killer so I don’t know which is which to survivors
---
Easy, easy. Go easy there fella.
---
I like the Jacket idea, although his perk deck isn't the most viable.
---
Yeah that’s the primary use.
---
I doubt that highly.
---
Dude this is some sherlock holmes level shit
---
Sorry, it was a joke
---
No one ever talks about whether a killer is “bad” or “good” because they got all 4 or didnt. Because most of the time they get all 4. It takes no skill to play as a killer no matter what rank you’re at because most killers that play are toxic. Add one or not
---
I would check to make sure you don’t already have it and just forgot, teachables usually persist in your bloodwebs until you buy them, I’ve never heard of one not showing up at it’s intended level
---
Oh I was just curious, it is NNN after all
---
I hope so too. I've never experienced it but I hope they do something about it.
---
the more you’re in a game the more xp you get. Even with most gens done you can still pip and get iridescent in all other badges. Longer games = more damaged gens, destroyed pallets, hooked survivors
---
The stats are closer to 50/50 if you do some research.  They keep track of escapes on each platform and its actually quite balanced as far as escapes go. Not a part of the argument but how long have you been playing for?
---
Hatch was right next to me actually
---
If spine chill is a sniper rifle, DS is a nuke
---
It worked like that before the update too.
---
As long as you have enough of a charge to use the medkit for a second without depleting it immediately, you could get your insta heal off.
---
Right on, thanks.
---
No comment people learn at different paces and I’m pretty decent considering the short amount of time I’m playing. It’s just an objective observation without bias. There shouldn’t be killers with insta downs and unlimited exposed addons and then survivors items getting nerfed because it annoys killers. 
---
Maybe killers stuff annoys survivors and it’s not being validated or addressed. It’s ignored and invalidated which just frustrates people.
---
I think you didn't get the post. The challenge is still locked, even though I completed the one before it
---
Sure. But you also sound like someone that doesn't understand just how strong healing is currently. More so at higher ranks. Slugging still works, but it's so much less effective now due to all the healing. But slugging is still overall a loss in time you could be focusing on other people.
---
I never paid for bbq fwiw
---
Ah, you're right.
---
Thats not how that works the bonus bp from WGLF and streamers happens after the match so you can can get 8k points in game then say if you have steamers you will get 16k total after the game
---
That all depends on each player in the trial. What I'm saying is that extending the match isnt getting you anything. A 10 minute game doesn't automatically net you more BP compared to a 5 minute game. As a survivor you want to escape and as a killer you want to kill all 4. The quickest way from a to b gets you the match and into another. The time wasted staying in a trial trying to farm could be put into another match getting even more BP. This argument is stupid.
---
Idfk, kids man
---
I disagree, but we can agree to disagree.
---
Wish they made his legs bigger
---
They do it while drinking root beer and pretending its her gamer water
---
No because every time I play killer even if 3 escape and the game is long and I get one kill I still net more bp as a killer than if I played survivor. All of you saying killers aren’t op are just intolerant and stubborn 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
it slows the game down, and survivors have to spend time running around looking for the totem and some survivors just give up on doing gens entirely, it prevents you, the killer, from chasing one survivor for 3 gens and help w having a better game
---
You get fragments for just playing the game and more challenges come out every 2 weeks (IIRC) you aren't a very bright individual.
---
Never gonna happen
---
They should delete deep wounds. It's a garbage status and Legion was only created to buff Borrowed Time.
---
If they add hero brine they will have officially jumped the shark and may as well start adding non horror killers regularly.
---
I do everytime, love that bitch doing ahegao
---
Where did this image originate from?
---
The hero we need, but don't deserve.
---
90% if you're in SWF
---
And it doesn't matter because a couple of months means you aren't that experienced yet. People with 1000 plus hours still don't have it down. It's not an insult, this game just takes forever to get down and understand.
---
Uh, the latest dev stream. It's on youtube i think.
---
I see you like scrawny pencil ladies.
---
Please keep doing this. I love it
---
I can send you several clips of recent games that streamers have gotten into and myself have gotten into where I should’ve wiggled out and I got vacuumed onto a hook and a killer stepped into one of his own traps when it was in the other side of the pallet that a survivor slammed down as he stepped in it and then after the animation of the trapper stepping in his own trap went away it teleported back to the other side of the pallet.
---
States in the game itself that rift fragments come from completing challenges and earning xp - so from that information how is someone supposed to know it comes from ordinary gameplay with no missions included?
---
At end game collapse, you get killers camping though, it will be very difficult to get a safe unhook.
---
So very cool and great 👍👍👍👍
---
If your the first person to get to that part of the archive, miniscule without farming. Theres barely 2 hooked people post endgame, let alone 3. Once everyone needs this mission, either impossible because they all will be fighting for the unhooks making everyone get 2 each at best or reasonably plausible because people will be getting downed often while fighting for the unhooks and you just get there first without going down.
---
4 of you distracting with borrowed time. I think its at least 55% chance to succeed
---
I believe the misconception here is that your hit box is crouching with you as you are on the gen but it is really as if you are standing straight up. Same if you are healing/being healed... your hit box is if you are standing despite being hunched over.
---
Not sure why it's like that but it is :/
---
Apparently based on responses so far it works counter to what is written within the game itself.
---
Changes. Not nerf. Nerfs are only for pig players, remember?
---
I feel like I’m just caught in a loop with everyone on this post. The devs should fix it instead of it taking forever to get down and understand. Stop releasing cosmetics and fix you’re game...
---
"I must go, my people need me." - this Meg probably.
---
I'm glad we are all in agreement, then.
---
Nerf the stupid op shit both sides have.
---
Honestly, I shouldn’t be at that part. For some reason it skipped to “Level 4” which is coming soon. 
---
I think when the level 2 comes out, It will take me back. 
---
I’m not sure why it’s showing me the level 4 lol.
---
Cant beleive this clip is full of lies smh.
---
No, if you're unhooking a survivor and the killer isn't standing right on top of you, unless you're playing against like legion or something, you should heal that person. You shouldn't just run off to do a generator. Maybe run with that person to a generator to heal, but even at higher ranks people will focus heal. Because the less other survivors are healed, since it takes far less time to heal than finish a generator, it gives you more buffer time to complete the generator if the killer comes back around. Can't tell how many times I've gotten more 3-4 kill games purely because survivors don't bother to heal each other.
---
No terror radius, no red stain, can't read killer aura. That's it.
---
It’s the level 4 anyways, it will be a while before everyone access it. 
---
I don’t know why it’s showing me level 4 before level 2.
---
u forgot the hitting a survivor and only then using the phasewalk, sprinkle in some stridor ofc.
---
The killer is fucking Chuckles, thank you.
---
 [You right now](https://imgur.com/sAI0kJn)

Yeah me too. Join the club
---
Aight 18k pre double, so thats 36102 post double leaving you 24k exactly to be achieved.
---
This is achievable by 4 pumpkin gens, which is 4+ pestula flowers brought as long as you brought one of them, making it an exact 12kx2 for 24k
---
They're fixing their game just not what you want.  I'm sorry but killers aren't too powerful and survivors aren't too weak. #1 killer was nerfed, insta heals nerfed, mori will be dealt with. Balance  will always shift with an ever evolving game.
---
But have a good night. I'm out.
---
aright man :D
---
I play both sides, but killers shouldn’t be faster than survivors. They’re so op they can just use their abilities. Also, flashlights shouldn’t need to be timed. It’s so unfair.
---
It would make hag to useless but it’s frustrating when hag just spams traps and you can’t get away because it constantly turning your head
---
Don’t believe so. She mostly calls him by his name.
---
I heard it's a glitch but hey maybe yall can practice or something. But uhh good luck random internet frendo. Get those tiers!
---
paulie posted it on twitter, idk the OP
---
I agree that he was wiping the knife but they buried this detail in the recent patch notes - even if you try to jump thru the hatch and the killer also hits close, the servers will prioritize the killers interaction over survivors. Super lame.
---
You don't know of any timestamp or anything?
---
I think so
---
Level 4 is a known glitch that has been posted so many times your late by at least 3 days. Once u complete it defaults you to the fourth page instead of the first.
---
It says pretty plainly that you get fragments from xp.....which is what you earn at the end of every match....
---
It wouldn't make her useless. I would rather be slowed down a small bit compared to having my body turned around. Just my opinion though.
---
happened to me i just hard reset my xbox and they were there

They are fixing bugs ?
---
I would love a killer that could grab and drag survivors at a distance and down them unless another one helped free them. Smoker could work well, but i don't think this games tech would allow it. It'd be too buggy with walls and stuff as he drags survivors too him. That said he could latch onto them at a distance and it effectively roots them in place and downs them after x seconds rather than dragging them to him.
---
TVs around the place, she makes you shit yourself as you run a way.

Here’s the end game score, nea is green rank since apparently you are really trying to make it seem like I’m hiding the score https://imgur.com/gallery/DXt0p6Q

This is the ONLY way in which this dead ass meme is funny. 
---
Well done.
---
Even better: "Hey guys, the killer is **Slasher Character 01**.
---
Yeah it sucks to play him how your suppose to play killer. If you try and play fair like the devs want you get destroyed by baby Dwights. Idk what would even help him. Maybe remove his movement penalty while revving his chainsaw so he can just run around fully revved at all times like a crazy man.
---
How do you know they were teaming? What went down?
---
I guess it would be his rework?
---
"BOOP DA SNOOT!!! 1!1! XXDDXDDDD" comes so much closer to being cringeworthy than simply "anything". Try again.
---
That’s I didn’t realize that part lol.
---
That trapper belongs in halo.
---
You wanna talk about it?
---
You were hiding the score.
---
Nea is the Green Rank? So this proves that Nea did something during the game. 
---
That you're full of shit.
---
And this whole post is just you being a salty, toxic survivor bitching because someone didn't play the way you expected them to.
---
Nea did nothing wrong. You should be banned for working with the killer.
---
The fact that you were even willing to put this picture forward, despite how damning it is, is baffling.
---
Yeah most people are just having fun and fucking around.
---
So the keg kept running to me and my friend player 3 as well I would assume and wraith would not hit her but us take us to a hook down we go and wraith downs and mories. Then we all die and I spectate the go around get pallet stubs then meg hatch escapes
---
[*Fraaaanciiisss*](https://youtu.be/91Xmna5kJWU)
---
Idk but i iust really want the dark sense one to be changed
---
Yep, it’s the Entity
---
Well my main “fact” would be NOED rewards you for playing because because you didn’t stop the generators for being completed or kill the survivors which is the killer’s objective. That’s not a “feeling” its a “fact.” Adrenaline rewards you for playing good because you managed to stay alive and most likely completed generators etc. You staying alive is also a “fact”. 
---
My argument isn’t that NOED is necessarily a good perk, it’s that it rewards you for playing bad.
---
Also, you mentioned how “Adrenaline can’t be denied”. Now I don’t know if you are joking or you actually believe this, but Adrenaline can 100% be denied and I think you already know that. (By not letting them repair gens which is your objective) (also a “fact” btw)
---
You also mentioned how “survivors get a health state just by having the perk”, yeah... you’re right... AFTER they do all 5 generators which is their objective (which means they get rewarded for doing the objective) (also a “fact” btw)  
---
But like I said, we can agree to disagree. I can tell you’re not open to other ideas and you’re also very stubborn, that’s why I didn’t want to explain to you why I disagree. 
---
Also, I don’t understand why you used the words “moral statement”. Do you know what moral means? What does me giving my opinion have to do with morals? I think you just used a random word that you thought would make you sound smart but it actually did the opposite.
---
i thought everyone was memeing LMFAO this is so funny
---
Keys dont bug me much. Mori animation's are a big part of this game, maybe just make then only available after 2 hooks. Just to make it a little shorter then having to hook them on death.
---
I found the Nea main. /s
---
Eight clowns. Players afk "hiding" not doing gens while you're giving the killer a private tour around the map for about.....the time they add Jason.

Even though I’ve see this many many times it always puts a smile on my face

thats okay, but check the right top corner.

I hate SWF. It has no place in the game and it wasnt designed for it. Yes it saved the game. Whatever. But when I play killer and it's just me playing against 4 people all talking on mic telling eachother wherever the fuck I am, where they saw my totem, what perks they've figured out I have and they're all using "crutch perks" and items. Yeah. I cant beat that.. and I'm a rank fucking 4. And then, they're all 99ing gens so they all pop at once and they stand by the gate which they've also 99ed and teabag until I walk over just close enough for one of them to slap the switch and all of them escape. 
---
I'm not looking for a 4k every time. But jesus christ like.. give me a fucking chance.
---
This may be a joke, but it's legit why I barely play anymore. I love the game, I enjoy the good parts of the community, but I just can't enjoy playing it anymore. Especially because SWF is just straight broken to play against, and not playing with it is a detriment to yourself as a survivor.

I really do hope the leak is wrong xD

not gonna lie, she’s lookin hella cute right here
---
Are you mad because you were the killer and got outed?
---
I've always heard the P3 Claudette outfit was the best but I never knew why.
---
It was originally a joke about the Clown's mori (the finger licking); but it then became an Actual Thing due to the influx of new players and the rank reset when the DLC dropped.
---
I think their like auric cells but you can only buy a orange jumpsuit outfit with them
---

---
Autodidact contradicts most of these
---
Dies in Claudette
---
In my experience, console players are on average more toxic than pc players when they're toxic. Mostly because they have to go out of their way to actually message a player as opposed to just using in game/post game chat.
---
I already said. SKILLCHECKS on moris. If the killer messes one up the survivor escapes with some animation. At least there is some skill to it since there is no way to counter it.

You say that like it's a bad thing.

---
It's so hard to see. I can't tell you how many times killers have literally bumped into me and not seen me. It's an ongoing joke with my friends as I usually am the last one alive in swf. I just troll the killers and run around then sit still while they run past me! There are certain areas of certain maps which shall remain nameless where p3 claudette will blend into a wall and be invisible.
---
Should be saying that to OP, shouldn't you? People like OP spread their toxicity, come online to post that same toxicity and spread it even further, and you're here telling me to chill out when I call him out of his lies?
---
Like, what are you actually trying to defend?
---
That’s not what you said tho
---
And isn’t healing speed capped at 100% or something? I tried doing a Jesus Jeff build one time with all of the above and didn’t notice any difference even once I managed to get five stacks of autodidact.
---
Negan? Is that you?
---
I didn't exactly forget. But yeah that's how it goes. Hit phase hit phase phase hit tunnel hook phase. It's fucking stupidly broken. Besides the nurse, spirit is the only one that can catch up to a survivor immediately after hitting a survivor which completely negates the short boost a survivor is supposed to have to get away from the killer. But hey, spirit needs more buffs right. These people need to get real. Meanwhile, the nerf legion got was so far out of line it's unreal. I've alwayshated legion but man I do feel bad for those that use him regularly.  The struggle must be insane for them. Miss a swing? Gotta wait to recharge. Nurse has to wait to recharge her shit now too. Spirit, nah no penalty or recharge mechanics in place to keep her balanced. Gotta end chases in 1.5 seconds and scream back to the hook the millisecond someone gets taken off of it. The recharge time for her is stupidly short even without addons. 
---
I've literally used spirit 1 time the day she was released and that was it up until recently when everyone is talking shit about her so I'm like I gotta see what's up from the spirits perspective cause it has to he harder than it sounds.... right? Nope. She's so fucking broken that I'm ending matches in a matter of minutes and I only have a very vague idea on how to use her based off of what I see when I'm playing against her. The highest scoring person in any of my match using her so far still has gotten less than 10k points. I'm a red rank killer as well as red rank survivor with many thousands of hours put into this game. So it's not like I don't understand how to play the game or how the mechanics work. I also play with a 200+ dollar headset. You're not getting away from me and idc if you've got iron will tier 20. I can hear your ass with base tier stridor and even without stridor. If they haven't been hit yet I just stand still till they come to me or they abandon the loop and I phase to them instantly and if they double back I'm gonna bump into them. Either way it's a free hit. 
---
The scrubs on this sub are gonna defend that shit to the death because when they play other killers they get absolutely smashed. They're carried by how broken spirit is since she is a brain dead killer to use. 
---
"Mind games" are completely 1 sided and she has collision while phasing which means she can body block both sides of a window and pallet at most loops with her phase as well as her husk. You don't need to know where anyone is at during a chase because all you have to do is bump into them when you are phasing and phasing sound emissions are removed if you're in her terror radius and she has built in stridor since all sounds in the game are muted except for breathing, injuredsurvivorsand footsteps and her weapons hitbox range is longer than t3 Myers or Freddy. She's busted as fuck from all sides of the spectrum with no counter play.
---
they dont add kid survivors/killers
---
Yup.
---
What? You said it would make her useless so I gave it another idea as well...? What are you on about.
---
Hitting great skill checks with ruin on isn’t hard
---
I've run into dumb shit regardless. When I was newer and had few perks I'd tend to be more tunnely and more campy, but after getting more perks I stopped. But now I'll have trouble finding people, except the one dude that runs around like a moron. I've had to run around maps looking for people cause they apparently just crouch walk everywhere, and the one that doesn't just runs out in the open with DS like a moron. I just get irritated because the people with DS I go again almost always seem to throw themselves in front of someone that hasn't been hooked because they know it'll let that person get more distance, and I can't fucking do anything to them.
---
And yeah, it's better to divide your attention unless you work great as a team.
---
Imagine blaming the consumer for not receiving part of a product they purchased.
---
If Jeff’s a satanists and then he’s a Jesus isn’t that a bit contradicting lol.
---
Oh shit your right. I forgot it’s without medkit
---
I would 100 percent rather just get rid of the turn but people would cry so they would have to do something else.
---
Yes but I play on xbox and I'm bad at the game.
---
Just that you were implying on your previous statement
---
Xenomorph is a bit more horror though but I def wouldn’t mind a predator too
---
I have an all white outfit I like to wear on special occasions. The cute white skinny jeans and the white top. ♥️
---
Pretty sure that isn’t true, the devs do not have access to Steam messages to verify that and a chat can very easily be faked.  All that it takes is video evidence of the survivor working with the killer, even though the devs rarely follow through with reports.
---
Plus David has a reason to be shirtless, he fights a lot. If we got shirtless Ace, for instance, that would be really out of place.
---
Practice and and you’ll be a god at hitting great skill checks with ease :)
---
Baby wraith
---
Check to see if your tv has a game mode input. Sometimes there's a small delay between your button input and things showing on the screen.
---
Thank you good person of reddit :)
---
I totally believe this! I get by with her brown skinny jeans and her brown collared shirt constantly so I can only imagine what her p3 outfit is like. ♥️
---
No matter what, I can give a bit of respect for the fix. Adjusted my comments. You did not try to delete the pictures.
---
Though they are still pretty damning against you, no? You at 26k includes at least a 6k Escape score. So that means you had 20k during the game. Nea being 5k under you means she wasn't doing "nothing"
---
Add the fact that it's a Rank 9 Nea compared to your Rank 3, and the other survivor's Rank 4s.... And there should be an obvious skill gap between Rank 9 and Rank 3, yeah?
---
Looking at it that way kind of shows you as the asshole here.
---
Even I wouldn't go all the way across the map, into who knows how many Hag Traps, to *maybe*, **possibly** pick someone up and alert the Hag of where both of us were. It's a sad state, sure... But I don't think Nea was wrong to say "He's down, he's being used as bait, and I'm not giving the killer 2 free kills when I might still get away."
---
Cause while the Hatch was next to you, as you say, Nea may not know that. She may be banking on hearing the hatch after you die, or starting on a door when the Hag closes the hatch and hope the Hag is far enough away to complete the open.
---
All told, you look pretty bad here from an outside perspective.
---
I would to but feel like it would make her under par with other killers more so than she already is
---
It wasnt that great of a nerf after people figured out how to abuse it. Most times I run into DS users it's always to bully, not play. 
---
Arguably, yes the killer should be smarter than to grab a little ass hole out of a locker 6 seconds after they're unhooked. 
---
But that's my job as a killer. Why wouldnt I tunnel? If you were hunting a deer and wounded it, but there were 3 healthy deer around wouldnt you go for the wounded one? 
---
People who complain about tunneling need to grow up. Its 100% a play style, and no; I dont tunnel unless you're being toxic. Do you think I like being flashlight blinded by 3 survivors all wearing mics? No. Do you think I like being body blocked to oblivion when trying to carry someone to the basement? No. Do you think I want to be stabbed in the shoulder everytime I pick a fucking Meg up out of a locker? HELL THE FUCK NO.
---
Do I get pissy and message them after the game because I'm a little cry baby bitch who cant lose? Also no. Because it's a game meant to be played how you want to play it. The difference between killers and survivors is that survivors cry to the point that they've actually created a whole set of rules that killers are expected to follow for no reason or benefit to the killer. 
---
Were expected to just let you unhook your friends and then chase the person who I havent downed once. I can't stand by the hook and protect my kill, I cant use NOED, nurses calling, mori's  or insta downs. I'm not aloud to patrol gens, bring prayer beads, or tunnel. I'm also only supposed to slug instead of hooking someone I tunneled, even if they're being toxic. 
---
But let's just all wear mics and bring awful "crutch perks" and items and body block me so i cant move and block the hook so your friends escape, teabag me at the gate, strobe me (though that may have been taken out of the game? Please let me know), and bring an insta heal (thank fucking god those are gone).
---
Let me end on this;
---
Theres one killer and 4 survivors. I am already at a great disadvantage. You better BELIEVE I'm gonna sit there and watch your toxic, bodyblocking cry baby ass die on the hook after you've pallet blinded me and tea bagged the whole fucking game. 
---
But fuck me as a killer for bringing NOED and a Mori.
---
Spine Chill is so much more than a scaredy cat perk like most call it. Really gives you an edge during chases, when you know if the killer is mindgaming you or lost where you are. And that slight action speed can make a big difference in some moments. Run Iron Will with it and you're godly.
---
I'm currently a P1 Claudette with the knitted hat, bloody shirt, and producer jeans and whenever I try blending in I always get seen so I'm guessing I need P3 Claudette to blend in
---
*shrugs* You can't win with this game sometimes. I enjoy it, and it's so fucking satisfying when you dunk on people that are queued up together. Nothing feels better than that.
---
I'm sorry what
---
I would place the [Demogorgon](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rVRuNcP5ml0) a little lower on this list.
---
On switch actions speak louder than words.
---
This makes me uncomfortable
---
I don't know why but I thought of David taking a bat to one of the Legions head and I heard the Mortal Kombat 10 X-ray bone smashing noise
---
Don't have screen capture recording software readily available on my computer. I did report him for holding the game hostage for 40 minutes. he slugged another player and left him there too. The Steve was able to crawl in just enough to get healed but kept getting slugged until he died from it. Honestly people like him make the game less appealing to play when I already don't have a lot of game time per week /:
---
Why are we still making the same unfunny joke after 2 years.
---
There is no punchline to shirtless Myers. Please for the love of god just stop
---
Does this happen to everyone or did you just lucky?
---
1. If you’re constantly getting bmed and harassed by an ass I won’t look down if you camp him.
---
Beyond lol, especially since she starts teabagging. Absolutely deserved to be tombstoned 👌
---
My swf group is pretty bad, I get to red ranks guickly when I'm solo, but go back down to purple every time I play with my friends, and half the time postgame the killer boasts because thinks he's the hottest shit since he 4k'd us even though we are all on eachothers friendlist lmao
---
cant wait for this 2 be downvoted bc its something you enjoy doing and someone doesnt like that
---
I assume it's quite rare. I've seen other people reporting accidentally breaking into level 4 of the tome, but nothing about all these text errors.
---
Yup, I love this game but, I strongly dislike the community
---
But winning is fun and that's what you do when you play vs legion...
---
I do this all the time, feel like every time I stick my neck out for someone I get betrayed and it is not a nice feeling. I get where you are coming from though.
---
You sound like a 13 year old in the post-game chat.
---
Or we can have Sidney Prescott from Scream as a survivor
---
I truly understand everything you’re pointing out and saying yes. I wanted to post the whole game with certain clips of her but with me being on PS4 and just having my mobile device I really don’t have no clue on how to do any of that. 
---
The rank 4 with the least amount of points dead 7 minutes before from where my clip started (looking at the game now) with 7 minutes out of the game with the nea still alive you would think her score would be much higher. 
---
The 4 rank that came second died 2 mins later. Now you seem to have more of idea of how much points you get from so and so, I give you that.
---
From watching the saved clip, nea did not complete any gens, did not save anyone from any hooks. The only interaction she did towards me was her running towards me to heal me as my teammate was healing me as she was already half way done before nea arrived. 
---
Now the whole rank and skill gap thing eh, I seen plenty of people in low ranks play better than higher ranks. Me personally compared to others I don’t care really about piping and etc so I don’t know how I’m in red ranks but I am.
---
Yeah I felt he same..
---
Passive phasing is one piece of the anti skill puzzle that is spirit
---
I demand blunts for all the Survivors &amp; Killers.
---
&gt; Game might of doubled your 12k for the post screen but chose not to in the BP count.
---
it's literally just a guy in glasses
---
Change 'nurse is op' to spirit
---
Personally I like his cousin, the crapper.
---
Safe assumption 99% of the time that a) they're just trying to distract you or b) their buddy is waiting in the locker with Head-On.  You start waving your hands at me I have no idea wtf you want but I'm going to kill you anyway, so moot point.
---
Careful im on negative 15 karma for talking like that lol
---
Now that’s an edgy teen if I’ve ever seen one
---
You miss spelled steve
---
w/e. 
---
Even if i explain people like you will throw shit anyway so.. hf
---
Never fapped to her once i tried but i just switched to leatherman in the locker rooms instead
---
I’m aware
---
This looks stupid.
---
Unless you're openly farming with a friendly killer you'll never get it.
---
They need to change this.
---
Yeah, i feel it man.. it sucks
---
I don’t think he did
---
Thanks for explaining it nicely
---
that one midsommar scene at the end
---
Not even SWF. It'd have to be farming with friendly killer.
---
It kind of does matter, doesn't it?
---
OP worked with the killer to get another survivor killed. This is ban-worthy per BHVR.
---
OP then came on here, posted an edited video showing this and claiming "justice" or that the other survivor deserved it. OP lied to do so.
---
What are you defending? Lying to promote toxicity? We're already know as a toxic community. Even this subreddit is incredibly toxic.
---
And you're telling us to not police ourselves? To not call bullshit out when it's shoved under our faces? To just accept the lies and toxic bullshit fed to us?
---
Man... Your apathy is showing. Try to be a better human, yeah?
---
It doesn't take you any time. My so-called "police investigation" (Which is really just me being active in the thread and putting 2 and 2 together) doesn't hurt you. So why did you spend the time to try and dissuade me from doing it?
---
What's your gain?  Even if you're gonna be apathetic, trying to call out the person pointing out lies instead of the liar is real low.
---
Man, remember the days when Trapper would put bear traps under your hook, 100% of the time?
---
Fuck those guys. Lol.
---
If it was real that you had to fight all of them, clown would be easiest because he’s in his late 80s

Just use his name found in the files

Also, swf groups only ever play against slugging nurses and spirits.

It's probably set up that way to make it harder to complete the entire thing. Meaning you don't get all of your auric cells back and have to buy more for the next one.

Literally would have no reason to lie, I even had to make a fucking imgur account just to post the messages because I knew people would ask for them lol I took me about 30-45 mins to even figure out how to post the clip without showing the nea’s name.
---
I will burn the offering and immediately get tunnelled to death before touching one of the event gens or any gen for that matter
---
Why was Billy going so fast backwards?
---
Lmao the “oh god not again” is perfect
---
Activision says "Hi".
---
I'm not saying Nea was carrying the game or anything... But a 15k score compared to the rest of the survivors (accounting for OP's escape points), shows that she wasn't "choosing to not help the team" as OP frames it.
---
Maybe Nea isn't playing optimally, or up to the standard OP expects, but neither of those things are damning. Especially considering the rank difference.
---
Leveling up my p3 character just to use pedals takes more blood points than I care to spend just to get it
---
A close 3rd has to be Bethesda and their dumpster fire of a Fallout game
---
I got a good amount of bloodpoints that game and I was reluctant to DC because of some asshole
---
This is completely true. High tier killers like Billy and Nurse actually take some skill, but Spirit doesn't. She's easy to play and the 2nd or 1st best killer in the game. My friend who just started playing even encounters grey rank Spirits and they always demolish grey rank survivors. She's a noob friendly killer. It takes like three games to pick up how to play her.
---
Gen tap. With the way that grabbing people is broken if you gen tap it's really hard to grab you. Also run spine chill. With spine chill it completely nullifies prayer beads. And if you aren't already run with a team on voice coms so you can work together to take out totems and keep track of where she is. It's not perfect but it does make prayer bead spirit alot easier.
---
I don't know why but she looks like Billie eilish
---
Man I kinda adore your passion for this honestly
---
“Hello slave, I have brought you a gift, one dead lizard”
---
Congrats of having low standards but I'll wait for classic coke thanks
---
He forgot David was free
---
Like I said I understand but how many bloodpoints did you lose by sitting in a game that long? In 40 minutes you could have played several games and since you don't have much time to play it doesn't seem wise to spend your time in a corner being bullied.
---
In a cesspool of idiots, negativity and entitled people. 
---
It was nice to see a positive thing. Lol
---
I would have loved to reply to this if half of the things you said made sense. You also called me a “dumbass” and “low rank survivor” because I told you my opinion. Did I ever insult you in my response? No, because i am not stubborn and in denial like you. You went from being all “facts are important” to mostly talking about your opinion. (Which is fine)
---
“You got hit by NOED because you didn’t cleanse, that’s a fact” 
---
Yeah, after the killer played bad and needed a crutch perk to get a kill.
---
“Your feeling argument is based on "noed bad because we did gens". So bloodwarden?” 
---
Yeah, bloodwarden actually rewards you for hooking someone, unlike NOED, you actually have to do something to activate it. 
---
“To noed be even active, you need at least one totem up and chase survivors too. So if we're gonna talk about rewards, it reward the killer to win the chase.”
---
In this paragraph you said it “rewards the killer to win the chase.” You know that to be rewarded you have to do something good right? Failing at doing your objective isn’t something “rewardable”.
---
“Because your points are filled with this entitlement. "Rewards killer for doing bad" no. Punish you to not doing bones”
---
You didn’t explain why you used the words “moral statement”, being entitled has nothing to do with the definition of something “moral”.  Also, you say it “punishes you for not doing bones”, I agree with this. But it also highly rewards the killer for playing bad. (Failing his objective). 
---
“Yeah. Because you think that holding one button is so difficult and isn't fair be "punished" for doing the objective. When the killer job is to kill you.. plus you have to lose the chase in the first place to be hit by noed and again not have done bones. So you lost 2 chances” 
---
Yeah.. i never even said it is difficult. You just made that up.  Also, you keep bringing up how It punishes survivors for not doing bones, no, it punishes them for doing the objective and rewards the killer for failing his objective. I don’t understand why you think survivors have to destroy every single totem every match when that doesn’t help with objective. 
---
“I'm stubborn because you feel entitled of doing just gens and be fine”
---
I don’t even know how to respond to this. When did I ever say I am entitled to be fine after doing gens? Lol. You are just making up random statements that I never even mentioned. Also I wanted to ask, is English your first language? Some of the stuff you said I really struggled to read.

Cheers but my TV has seen the 90's

---
I'm not referring to downing people who are injured so much as the Spirits who immediately return to the hook no matter what they're doing specifically to chase the recently unhooked person (because spirits go from having to mindgame for hits to having the exact location of a survivor at all times the moment they're injured). That sort of damn near personal vendetta against whoever was hooked is what I consider tunneling. Just happening upon the same person over and over is just bad luck on their end. Literally stopping in the middle of a chase you're about to win just to go bully someone who got off the hook though, that's tunneling.

The one thing that worries me about having made this thread is the inevitability that since in the animation he wore a cloak and looked like a normal survivor we might get people suggesting that his "normal" form tries to blend in with survivors, like almost every killer suggestion on this sub lol

You clearly have little to no Clown experience. If you let go of the bottle right away, there's no slowdown. And that's why you're supposed to do. And even just throwing them and pallets and windows helps a ton. Don't try to justify Clown being the worst killer in the game. It's simply untrue.

---
Challenges are permanent and not tied at all to gaining the auric cells from the rift. All it does is give extra rift fragments to make progress faster.
---
The mori is when you play the game normally and get OOO haddonfield survivors who aren't playing for fun or to do the rift. I'll run a mori afterward to feel a bit better. If its a string of bad games in a row I'll just iri huntress ebony or ebony nurse ruin.
---
Prayer beads spirit is for when I suspect the game is going to be a tryhard swf.
---
Your welcome, wasn't hard to find lol.

I'm surprised Legion, Ghostface and Pig are so low considering that it's way harder to get a good shot in with a bat than it is with a knife. Not to mention both Ghostface and Pig are trained in well...Murdering and/or kidnapping people.

---
Imagine being a console killer main and going against a pc swf group. Yeah no thanks unless it's ps4 and Xbox cross play.
---
Best post in a long time
---
That will literally never happen if the Killer isn’t farming.
---
First, all 4 Survivors need to still be alive when EGC starts (At least 1 will probably be dead by then, if all goes according to plan for the Killer, with another two on death hook). 
---
Then, the remaining Survivors need to not be on death hook, and if there isn’t at least 1 dead, they’re on death hook. No unhook possible meaning “lol get fucked- The Entity”.
---
Next, you need the killer to not tightly patrol the hook once EGC begins. There’s really no reason that they wouldn’t attempt to secure a kill in that situation, so odds of this happening are borderline 0.
---
Then, YOU need to unhook them, meaning that either you go for the cast iron testes save, which will probably go down poorly, or some other chump will. 
---
All of this is assuming that no one decides to GTFO as soon as the gates are open. 
---
Whom’st’ve’st the fuck thought this challenge was a good idea? This is more horrible than the Malfeasance questline in Destiny 2, and that thing fucking blows. At least Zero Hour and The Whisper reward strong/fun guns.
---
Myers for the sole fact you can be Pantless Myers tombstoning Survivors with your big thick pipe
---
Evan knows something his father doesn't know... and he feels empowered.
---
Oh my god this. Ffs, statistics lie a lot but everyone promising to dc (and actually dcing) or killing themselves when against a spirit makes it so that she is so “God tier”
---
It takes practice knowing how to counter her, like a good nurse before the nerf, but it is not impossible by any means. I am a potato survivor and I still hold my own against her, it just takes more than running around a wall for a while to get her off your case.
---
But it also takes practice how to get good with her, people assume having headphones makes you a great spirit. Bullshit
---
Her prayer beads need a nerf though, 100%, makes no sense, like the nurse’s millionth blink add on. And it is way too easy for her to tunnel (I’m learning to main her, and tracking the injured one is always easier) so maybe a small rework to give a survivor an automatic BT like effect when unhooked against her should be implemented.
---
Her collision is not entirely broken but bodyblocking as her should not be possible. Maybe a small window of time, show contact for the killer but not trapping the survivor in place.
---
But that’s it. People inflate things way too much and also parrot streamers and each other way too much too. This community creates such an echo chamber that when I got to red ranks (survivor) and kept encountering doctors and leatherfaces I thought I was going insane. Weren’t they all supposed to be nurses and spirits? With the occasional Billy/huntress?
---
Sorry for the wall of text. This community tests me lmao
---
How?

I dont think splinter is secret
---
Yeah if you have pop don’t bother with clown which you didn’t but I want to stroke myself on my knowledge.

Hex: Termination By Sniper Fire
---
I really hope they change up some of the longterm goals down the line. They are ***brutal***. My tome glitched and I got to see the 4th, and one of them was for you to *safely unhook 3 survivors after the EGC has begun- in a single match.* I just can't even fathom how in the world you are supposed to get this one
---
I hate this mentality. Wahhh life is hard grow a thicker skin X(
---
How about just don’t be an asshole to people? Have some basic decency. Half the things people say they would never get away with because in meat space someone would kick the shit out of you for being such a dick. The only reason people get away with it is that they’re not looking the other person in the eye in the real world. Yes GG EZ is not the worst thing you can say to someone but come on, stop excusing bad behavior.
---
Maybe its just Nurse? I was able to do my Legion challenge, and I had a tome challenge active when I did that one
---
My favorite part of rank reset is being able to play Legion until I get to purple ranks again
---
It would be better if people were just reasonable, with some degree of tolerance, and even a minor grasp of understanding of how game development actually works
---
Boop the snoot
---
That's a fair point. Probably too much to ask to use a lower level character, too, if you're at high rank, but surely you use bloodpoints on SOMEbody, maybe something can be worked out. I don't know everybody's situations.
---
You poor soul, good luck with legion
---
I'm pretty sure that's a graphical bug. It comes and goes just like how her idle animation used to reset when she entered phase. It's more then likely gonna be patched sooner or later.
---
Myers is Jeff confirmed
---
Every challenge rewards 60K BP and must be done in single match. If you're like me and don't enjoy playing trapper much... Better get used to him
---
My experience the lower my rank in survivor gets is the less likely I am to see NOED at all because there are way better perks to run. I never run it as Killer because I have much better choices than that.
---
Okay, fair enough. I suppose that if looping is your main strat that could be true. Gotta be a nightmare for survivors I imagine though, with how hated oneshot stuff is.
---
I see it all the time. I saw it today. I mean yeah, itll regress if I kick it.. but after I've smacked a bitch and she taps that briefly before a chase ensues it's not regressing.
---
Yeah this sub, all the comments were asking where they got the pic from

Devs: Did SOMEONE say Pantsless Meyers?
---
Players: Nobody!
---
Devs: Well, since you all asked!
---
I managed to get killere to farm with me.
---
They needed to get the two bear traps done, most of us had survivor challenges, so we just knocked them out.
---
Maybe his movement speed but I’m quite sure that his vault speed is increased from the times I’ve played him.
---
Yes.
---
Must have been deleted or something I guess?
---
Blending is for nerds wear bright clothing! (This post definitely not made by killer gang)
---
There's definitely less toxicity in games where everyone is queueing solo, from both sides. I certainly agree on that.
---
I dunno
---
No
---
Micheal is the embodiment of evil which is unkillable
---
Ik which is kinda poopoo tbh I thought they were fine and I play killer and survivor
---
Yes I’m on Xbox. I’m a chill player.
---
Used flashlight on the generator to help my teammate see what he's doing.
---
Its not bad tbh, its p easy actually. The reason why many (and i) hate exposed is bc its tunnel heavy and surprise factor, but thats mostly just bc i hate NOED, i dont have an issue with insta down chainsaws or shit like that
---
That fucking hurts man, i loved the Evan story so far, guess i'll have to google it when someone completes it
---
Fair enough.
---
I only had the issue with Nurse, pretty sure I banged out another challenge in the meantime. Tbh I just assumed I had a trash game as Nurse.
---
I don’t know if we watched the same movies, but they literally killed him multiple times and then retconned it later because they wanted more money.
---
Evil spireh was my name for a good month or 2 haha
---
The outfit choices I'm looking at for Claudette are black and violet so they're not that bright. But it's the fact of do I spend $10 getting an outfit or do I grind
---
That would be really nice if killers did that. 
---
For my trapper challenge, I found an AFK guy, trapped him twice, then let him and his team go.
---
Makes a lot of sense
---
&gt; Mending will never be fun.
---
Neither will DS...
---
Jokes aside I would say grind but if you really like the cosmetics might as well spend the cash while ya got it right?
---
Yeah. And the legion members are all around 18 years old and it’s not like they’re not athletic (well maybe Susie but that’s it). I would get the shit beat out of me
---
Yeah, it's kinda sad ghosty didnt came with a survivor, is not the ghostface from the movies tho, he's an original character based on the mask
---
It could be an interesting concept for the alchemist to be both a survivor AND a killer. His killer form could be him when he’s on serum and powered up. Although I’m just baselessly speculating.
---

How 2 duo as Killer
---
The reason I'm thinking of grinding for P3 Claudette is because I've heard the bloodied clothing is really good for blending in but I'm not a big fan of it that's why I'm thinking of cashing in
---
When I see it in manga, it's fine. But if you see it in real life, it's fucking disgusting
---
it's even easier if you use your power. legions one of the easiest adepts to acquire imo. got it first try at rank 1 on 2 accounts so I would know.
---
Mikey's foot is shaped like his knife
---
Bro Belle Delphine looks like 15 so I’m actually concerned
---
It’s not a joke I legit think he’s hot.
---
Oh yeah it’s hard to spot but you’re going to be legging it for the most part in this game I’d say cash in and flex on the broke boys yeah?
---
And they can also be easy but take long to do due to shit teammates
---
I don't know myself
---
Ok thanks
---
One of them he faked it and some others sure it looked like he died but he always returned all healthy and ready again he never died just went into a slumber to recharge
---
You can’t just see him there is an actual amount of him you have to be looking at. I just watched a YouTube video on it today.
---
I’d also say that his T3 is more surprising like the person above said, but with Plague you have to position yourself better just in case she comes your way. Perks like DH, SB, etc. really help with getting to a safe spot. Things like Billy’s chainsaw or Bubba is counterable if you’re smart about it.
---
This is why i hate blendettes
---
Big boi chainsaw
---
No, because then you've probably got a situation where only one person, or not even one, is working on a gen, which is really really bad. Even if the progress is minimal, a gen that has progress is far better than one without.
---
Of course, if you're in a 4 man swf, then you can have one person search for the totem which is generally fine. Will likely leave 2 people on gens assuming one is being chased.
---
I love the idea of his power too. You are not like the other killers. You don't have Cool Powers, like going invisable, you aren't Swole as heck, you don't TP, you are not 3000 years old.
---
Frank, Julie, Susy, and Joey are just like the other survivors. Only they killed someone, and had to admit to what they had become, and The Entity decided to lure them into its world. Letting you run like a survivor is a brilliant idea, and the fact that from a distance (minus the red mist) you look just like one of the survivors is amazing.
---
Instead it takes him 3 hits to down someone...
---
I know you’ve already decided who to buy, but I thought I’d leave my opinion.
---
The clown costs 9k iridescent shards which you can earn playing the game. 
---
Save up 9k and get clown.
---
Micheal is a licensed killer, therefore you can’t buy him for shards. 
---
It was the correct decision buying Myers, he’s lots of fun. Not the best of perks, but has different play styles.
---
\*shrugs\* I won't ever claim that I'm not toxic. I'll throw out the occasional GGEZ for LULs, even when I kill 0 people, and then everyone gets all bent out of shape.

Unfortunately, this is less often used to actually escape as it is to bully in this exact situation. Between this and BT...
---
Well he is a fat drunk asshole did you expect something else?
---
Right now it's a double bloodpoints event, new content (the archives) has just come out, *and* it's the weekend.
---
All that adds up to a shit ton of players queueing, and if you assuming 30-50% of players are killers, that's gonna make it a much bigger wait time for Killer than Survivor.
---
I had this a few games ago, one survivor that each damn chase he would bring the killer to other survivors, when I had a chance I body block him to get caught, more chances of survival with him dead, he didn't even let us finish gens because yeah, here he comes with the damn killer behind him
---
&gt;Why is it not only do they not get any punishment but they may also stay in chat and harass me? BHVR what the hell
---
Unless this is console (which I don't know it works), people do get punished for chat harassment as long as people report them. As for DCing, they need to do it multiple times in a short period (aka deranking). DCing once in a while isn't bannable (yet).
---
I always see it as just running no mither, if you can loop the killer while being a one hit down, then you can deny the plague of her power :) I only cleanse if the gates are open and I know I can get out safely
---
Aw come on, Danny's a good name
---
The Chad Legion mains vs The virgin spirit main
---
Odd, can't remember the last time I've ever seen a killer play without Ruin or BBQ for starters, and we see killers post on here every day about how Ruin is mandatory (definition of a crutch) because they don't know how to apply pressure on gens.
---
What a pathetic life
---
it’s almost 3 weeks into the current season so most survivors are around ranks 1-10 by now. Additionally, there’s not that many new players so those queues are usually slow,
---
July 7th. But I thought bill was already in the game by then.
---
*Mr. Macmillian
---
Uhh not necessarily. If a character gets buffed in a way that currently addresses the meta they can pretty much instantly eclipse the tier 1 character.
---
Like if clown got a huge buff for his power that gave him a strength equal to nurse blink or spirit power he could easily shift the meta. Legion with heavy buffs could warp the meta around them too, Infact I see them after buffs becoming the next spirit, since by default they can vault pallets.
---
Sauce?

haven't played this game in a year, the devs mentioned something about dedicated servers coming summer 2019, is that already out?

Need I remind you that I, as a killer, am running against 4 survivors 16 perks 4 items and 8 addons and this entire team is likely a SWF all wearing mics. Of fucking course survivors need nerfed. 
---
I play both. Maybe even survivor more than killer. And I see SO MUCH toxicity on survivor side it actually makes me feel bad for the killer. These things have been nerfed and deleted because they were used to be toxic, not play.

Thank you for your service. Fuck u/CaddyLac_

What about the lobby issues?

I'm hoping this was sarcastic.. because it truly did make me laugh lol :)

I think he was as well, confused.
---
Wooow totally worth making your killer suck once again
---
No, I get that. Yesterday during twitch rivals, they were all meming (OhTofu, Puppers, EdarAllenBro, Pug,and some other streamer) for Twitch rivals and apparently there were many dbd fans and maybe devs who thought it made the game look bad. They weren’t playing serious or anything, but I heard a lot of people were upset by it. That said, I haven’t found anything in the forums or on the subreddit so I was hoping one of yall knew exactly what was going on

Pretty sure exp is the only way until the other chapters unlock

Bragging rights
---
Sadly only 14. I wish I had played more recently, apparently everyone's EXP was passively contributing towards the Rift since it was originally supposed to release. So that's why a bunch of people had free levels when it actually came out.
---
Holding a map
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Killers are completely allowed to disconnect from the match at any point and ruin it for everybody still alive. It’s happened to me more than enough times
---
While also escaping as Legion*
---
Keep playing normally. Every 800 XP you get 1 Rift Fragment. 
---
Also, they will add more Tomes on November 13th and 27th.
---
Being one hit is kinda a meme to good survivors who can loop. Really isn't a big deal at all.
---
No problem. I’d like to see what other ppl say, cause it honestly would suck to have it locked to exp
---
I call him Barbeque buddy sometimes.

No what’s pathetic is how you hold ones value to something as stupid as how they play a video game lol

This game get better and better everyday
---
I'm fully aware of the solutions. Never said I wasn't. That, however, is absolutely horseshit and only prevents the most nonsense of the add-ons uses: Gen grabbing. It still prevents knowing when she's using it, and forcing gen tapping instead of working on it normally is a HUGE benefit for already landing completely unteleprompted hits.
---
I should not have to run a perk to counter an add-on, and if you think that's okay, you're mentally diseased.
---
Bro can you even reach the Wraith's head in a timely manner? Dude is tall.
---
Pretty sure she’s way bigger than 6’6 tbh
---
That was some crazy mental gymnastics that you whipped out to justify that slippery slope fallacy. Congrats dude.
---
I was in a game as a killer the other day where when we got to the ETG one of the survivors ran and hid ,he let himself die to the EGC and said it was for the rift...does it work if you sacrifice yourself as a survivor ? Has anyone tried and can confirm ? Or do we all just need to go NOED, camp and be toxic ??
---
This makes me happy

Amazing costumes, but I have to say, your girlfriend could totally pull of an Arya Stark.  She looks just like Massie Williams.
---
Consoles have *auto-aim*? WTF?
---
They HAVE to die to the EGC. It makes the Killer look extremely toxic but sadly that's how it is right now. If the killer had the challenge available, it would be completed.
---
I had this with streamers. It was a Freddy running the ultimate slow the game down build. We were in the for half an hour.
---
Moris in general should be at least 2nd hook. but there is a lot more, People argue that IRI heads are ok bc they take skill... when they dont. Then insta saw, and tombstone just 2 name a few
---
It’s nit surprising they know it better
---
Yea. The Jeff body blocked long enough for us to get the quad. It still pissed me off that she was tryna get healed knowing how close the killer was
---
I love a happy ending
---
I'm honestly curious what they would call Pennywise. "The Pennywise"? That's not a thing. "The It"? Nope. I know we already have two inbred cannibals wielding chainsaws and hammers, so I'm not against the inclusion of a second clown (especially since the current Clown is nothing like Pennywise aside from them both being clowns) but every single killer so far has fit into the "The _______" naming scheme so I have no clue what they would call him.
---
Yay I was your 1000 upvote :)
---
I totally agree. Did Bhvr say anything about when pt 2 will be unlocked?
---
In short, what is The Archives? I dont have time to play until monday, but im so curious!!!
---
And is it fun?
---
well yeah it's not meant to be something cool. it's some sort of sense of progression.
---
Makes sense he did a good job in Until Dawn.
---
I have only been playing for a few weeks, so I don't know BHVR that well, so I can't really predict what they would want but I can give what I think should change.
---
I would change the deep wounds bullshit. Requiring Legion to hit people three times instead of twice is (IMHO) is the worst mechanic in the game by miles.
---
**The Killer shouldn't be punished for playing the game.** Simply putting survivors into a bleeding state from one hit, then dying in the next hit while in Frenzy would make Legion so much better and finally make them mid tier.
---
Things I would actually change: I like the idea of prolonging the ability by hitting different survivors, give more frenzy charge for hitting people while not in frenzy. End Frenzy if you put a survivor into the dying state when you M1 them (Allows survivors to get downed from DW while in Frenzy). Allow Legion to end Frenzy prematurely, and not have it all drain away. Only get fatigued post Frenzy if you hit the same survivor twice in a row, you let yourself run out of Frenzy or get Pallet Stunned. Put a small timer between ending Frenzy and swinging to make sure Legion can not circumvent the fatigue.
---
Some dumb things that they could do that might make legion fun but probably worse? Make them even more survivor like.
---
Make frenzy last a very long time and allow Legion to activate it at any point of its charge, remove the red mist while not in frenzy and drop the terror radius when not in frenzy by a large portion, and make them move at 56.5%
---
% movement speed. Now they look like a survivor, and walk at the same speed as one. Let them sprint at 100% movement speed just like a survivor by holding shift. Then they go into frenzy and move at 125% like they already do, maybe a bit more to compensate for the loss of speed. When not in frenzy you could look like different player to other survivors (ie the Meg looking at you would never see herself but could see you as her allied Dwight, safety vest and all), pushing the illusion that you are, like them, trying to escape The Entity not working for it.
---
Because theres 4 of them and one killer. 
---
I need to make it abundantly clear that I'm not at all against survivors or killers.  I'm simply saying that 4 against 1 with meta who all abuse body blocking and perks that literally make it impossible to get a single kill is unfair and needs some serious work. The thing I hate most about the game is SWF. That's honestly 90% of the problem. The ability to communicate with your entire team AND run meta is way too much. I dont care if the whole team runs meta as long as they arent all using mics and totally abusing the gameplay.
---
I don’t think they’re meant to be funny, I think they’re meant to be relatable (which they are) and we just find them funny
---
We try to do generators but one of us goes down so one of us goes to save, heal, another one goes down and so on. Also we are never able to find ruin totems so we end up dying with 4 gens left most of the time and very few points so it doesn't seem too worth it to play more lol What strats do you mean?
---
*disagreeing breathing*
---
no they go at the same time I'm pretty sure because the tome affects the rift with rift fragments
---
im currently rank 1 on both sides, but i main survivor. Survivor games are more chill bc not everything is on you, you have teamates to help you.
---
yes gen speed is annoying, but i would argue that gen slow down meta is even more annoying.
---
Scp 106 has breached containment
---
Lol GG EZ baby killer
---
Let me explain
---
A killer who requires a perk to play doesn't make his player bad, it is the killer who is... Trash
---
Survivor/killers always get carried by one perk for a match, not helped tough, like, if they did go perkless they would be useless
---
Key players spawn at higher tiers, like 1/2/3, and is not so uncommon to see them
---
The hatch is like an escape a survivor doesn't deserve, they could have played like a griefer the whole match, and by luck, get the hatch
---
Im not great, this is what the twitch streamer zeb89 says, he is tier 1, he plays both survivors and killers
---
For me, is alright to have an hatch, but found a better way for it
---
For example, spawn 3 keys that the killer can see on the map, the last survivor need to find one of those keys who are pretty visible and go for the hatch if not having a key
---
Just, make it a little harder for them
---
Well that's disappointing, I've been tempted to check it out.
---
The individuals who keep saying that everyone who has complained are being entitled are not addressing the actual criticisms of BHVR. They have consistently screwed many things up &amp; instead of perfecting their game have prioritized cosmetics.
---
The survivor perk meta and killer perk meta has been the same for months if not years yet every update has a few perks get buffed. This buffed perks still rarely get seen. This playerbase is terrible at trying new stuff because they are too stuck to the old stuff. 
---
Anyone that plays this game knows the meta hasn’t changed in a long ass time.
---
Also, spine chill and NOT RUNNING is the counter to spirit 🙄 but I'm sure people will bitch enough for a rework so shes totally unusable.
---
I mean I think it still delivers on the core gameplay of Until Dawn, but the characters just are nowhere near as good or as realistic as Until Dawn and they're harder to care about imo
---
Why did you bring up Ricardo.  I guess this year is a *bust*
---
The level 12 died first
---
Mostly because Shroud of Separation is actively detrimental to the killer.
---
Dude, I completely agree that games innately favor survivor. That's why I run aforementioned builds. 
---
I mean, the way to deal with body blocking is simple - don't walk through them, hit them immediately. If a hook is close, not even 3 body blockers can prevent the hook if you just hit them immediately. I've been there.
---
While I agree that only being able to play 4-5 killers at high ranks is dumb... that's the state of the game, and why you have to run meta slave builds, too. No one likes running builds like that all the time, but that is really the only counter. You still lose sometimes, against the cream of the crop - but you win, too. This game will always favor survivors, because of swf + 4v1.

You're never going to find me supporting a Spirit nerf. Killers need good options other than Nurse and William, especially since all killers are always beatable, even Nurse.

Here it is.
---
what about the issue that u cant use half the killers in the game without getting an aneurism because of not being able to pressure gens enough because of maps sizes
---
i think it is a memory leak restart the game
---
Right. That’s why if you hit a survivor when they’re dying on hook and being taken upwards, your screen flicks up really fast.
---
also is the 5% the only complaint u have or do u disagree with the other 2 points
---
The main menu makes my base PS4 sound like it's working double time.
---
The frame rates in the game itself are miles better than when I played more than a year ago, returned this week for some Halloween feels.
---
I literally just said I can't believe I'm gonna complain about it, take a chill pill
---
Ah yes, another bearer of the fifth perk, "Ultra Sneak", I salute you, comrade
---
It’s the condoleré opsosite for me.
---
When we are outside of the actual game our Community is just so great. I just LOVE such Cosplay Videos replaying ingame behaviour
---
The thing about Micheal is that you can hit him all you want, but it’s not like he’ll feel it
---
I personally think you're taking the wrong approach. I know it gets more attention to go: "don't believe OP and his lies" but it feels more like you're doing it for the likes/awards more than "telling the truth", which, in my humble oppinion makes you quite the cunt.
---
      
---
        -trully, some random guy on the interweb
---
If you're running thanato/sloppy (like most would if this was added) healing times would be insanely slow (add in legions dirty blades to make it worse).  This isn't healthy for the game, and isnt fun for survivors.  
---
  
---
(I think gen progress should drop at .5 survivor speed) 2 is lesser so.  Especially if gens are closer together it would make some games impossible for survivors, especially if killer had surveillance on.  I wouldnt mind an overcharge-like effect though.
---
As much as I don't like playing Trapper, doing that, or leaving a pallet up and chasing people towards said pallet, and watching them turn to vault it, only to die because of it is beautiful.
---
Just like any other battlepass, this is basically like a project. Something, that requires a lot more time finish like 2 months.
---
I hate it when i get spoilered
---
please, please tell us you actually got sacrificied that game. It was fortold after all.
---
Because a good plague well destroy you with it. It's an AOE ranged attack.
---
No wonder I can’t find the damn thing.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
It is really hard to start playing this game. You’re definitely gonna lose a lot of games at the start, there isn’t any way around that. Try and learn to run the killer around, it takes a lot of practice but the longer you can kept the killer on you, the better it is for the rest of your team. Also try playing custom matches with your friends, there fun and you can get practice without affecting your rank.
---
but Trapper and Wraith are free.
---
Jusie or Sulie

Omfg wasn't Spirit Truetalent ?!

It seems people do not agree.

Yeah no. Thats actually just busted. I think it requiring attempts is a nice idea. IIRC its like a 1/4 chance.
---
It's Herman!
---
Just let them have their fun, don't be a douchebag. They're cute videos.
---
They're mad at me for telling them the truth
---
It is, yet I got downvoted lol
---
You're not only wasting the killers time, but more importantly your own, though.
---
this seems like it's gonna turn out more like BO4 if you understand anything about that. obviously it takes 2 months, but I did the math for it because I don't have every day to play. some people have lives outside of video games.
---
BEEP BEEP RICHIE
---
There is an ebony mori and a Latina mori
---
We call him Papa Trap.
---
Yeah, since the patch the frame rate when you're in a game lobby is in the single digits. It's bizarre.
---
Ahh I guess I am not as committed to grinding this game to be able to have fun with it, as other games are easier to enjoy when playing with friends. Thank you for your input, it makes a lot of sense.
---
We did try the KYF thing but it wasn't as fun as we were all in voice chat and you can't really communicate too effectively or joke around :p
---
As much as I love my boi legion. He trash, I like his power concept of being able to jump over pallets and hop windows faster but the execution is so poor. But the devs have gotten a grip on making killer better with reworks, (Freddy and Nurse) and all of the new killers this year are pretty okay. I hope after the doctor gets his stuff handled they take care of the angry group of teenagers.
---
*Stunning killers drops 10/15/20 seconds away from exhaustion.
---
The odds of increase for an Ultra Rare in the bloodweb is around 2% from the tests Ive seen.  
---
That said, Ive prestiged a bit.  Just save up a bunch of bp and get that sweet new cosmetic.  My Meg is p3 (and has almost every perk), and my Pig is on her way.  
---
If you save up 1 million bp (easy with current event) you can get to around lvl 30 with it, so your killer wont "suck again".
---
I believe you also get serum as you level up(your overall level and not matchmaking level) from playing the game.
---
Alright, but there is no real point to 99ing gens like there used to be. It used to be a big deal because gens were the main way for killers to catch survivors off guard back when there was no exhaustion, no bloodlust and every leg up in chases. Survivors would 99 gens in order to waste a killer's time by having them still check on ones that were essentially already done and prevent getting 3 genned. Now there is really no point to it.
---
How does that absolve you of being a piss baby, exactly?
---
Basically. Thing is, it's amazing how everyone says every developer is terrible. Go to any community and, frankly, it's the same arguments
---
"Oh this dev is dumb. No other studio is this bad"
---
Like.. I really think that's the exception not the rule
---
Tbh, I believe this is just trial and error. Maybe the next rift won’t be as grindy.
---
What in saying is don't sit there and stare at her when she starts phasing, try to do something she won't expect.
---
I just was playing killer and farming I think I just got the flashlight one for someone I was playing with .. feels good :)
---
I know for a fact that survivors are more toxic than killers, because not only they can be douches to the killer they are also assholes to their own team
---
did you forget? night is when all the good players are around
---
And even then she can counter that with Strider
---
low rank killers get punished for being low, until you get swfs then you get punished for being new!
---
Typing this while i wait for a killer lobby :(
---
I honestly think the nurse changes were (while needed) pretty poor. Ever since the change I am having issues of not blinking where I think I should be blinking. Even with a Flannel to see where I am going to go, if you charge the blink to 100% but you would land in a wall, you instead go 1 meter forward and lose a charge. As far as I can tell its when you would land inside of something.
---
brother we are on reddit, not in English class. i dont agree with OP but
---
If it's a skinny stair case with randomly windows It... who's crying  now?
---
A survivor has a small percentage of a chance of unhooking themselves that will lead to their demise. Simply looking away from a flashlight survivor is simple and straightforward. I don't get your logic here.
---
I lol'd
---
i think adding a semi weaker overcharge to base kit would make things more fair
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't call him Bubba until the second movie yeah?
---
I was just honestly confused.  Like why soell literally every other word out except those? Like go ahead and spell wrong idrc, I just thought it was odd
---
we need more objectives, we also need to buff lower tier killers and make them less annoying, i would say billy is the model killer but i have had a lot of people disagree
---
Game: "I heard that you whould like to see how Eyeballs look from the inside, so here you go!"

I'm almost 100% sure that it's because of the fire effects happening in the background.

why the fuck are you so toxic? go take a piss on someone else's thread you degen

Small, indoor maps are probably going to be your best bet and as far as perks go, you’ll definitely need game delaying perks like ruin, dying light, pop goes the weasel, etc

Sorry that I spammed it. How do I remove it
---
actually i dont care, i mean, if the game end. i will quit and going next match. either being survivor or killer. btw im not camper, tunneler, or whatever kind style that ruin fun of other player
---
So anyway, I started spamming xD
---
ohh okay cause i was very confused when i saw this guy running around super fast cause i thought u couldnt speed hack on console lmao
---
I love everything about this, the small Smile of Leatherface got me especially.
---
Sorry that I spammed. I thought it wasn't posting and kept pressing post. How can I delete it
---
This and wiggle spamming are some of the worst aspects of the game I'd say. I have nothing against the idea of the mechanic, but mindless spam adds nothing. I'd rather just have to do skill checks in second stage with a failure meaning you die or something.
---
Clown has 0 gen pressure
---
So is the weird Final Fantasy almost naked dude you posted.
---
Criticise, prepare for people to do it right back.
---
I agree, I don't use them quite often unless I feel a need to (for example rifts or rituals... sometimes I also use them when I get rematched against the same swf that taunt)
---
I also mostly use green or yellow ones. I've only used ebony once and it was because I wanted to kill one person only.
---
I’m sorry for having a job and not being able to spend 6 hours a day only on Dead by Daylight, i guess.
---
The next section will unlock soon with new challenges which award rift fragments. I am not sure what the schedule is anymore, since the Archives were delayed.
---
You can still get Rift fragments with XP in the meantime. Yes, It'll be a bit slower going, but you'll still be making progress.
---
Battlepa$$ is such a grind.

You might want to mark it as a spoiler or data leak

I would totally get away with screaming "Daddy Myers UwU" every time he was in my match.
---
Dude, this is not fb or instagram. Why do you post an update after every adept?
---
Jeff though
---
I'm a killer main and tunneling is toxic as hell, especially when you squeeze in some survivor play and experience it for yourself.
---
People who are invested and really care about the game usually make nice posts like these. It's always a nice little refresher to see this kinda stuff.
---
It’s Friday night I’m hanging out with my best friends on PS4 I just finished all my test today at school with shitty grades. What better could I ask for?
---
No one fact checks these days, we’re all sitting here ready with our pitchforks. I’m not saying who is right or wrong but good on you for looking at both sides
---
I understand what you mean, I play tons of killer and I kid you not, 1/5 scoops steve are actually cool. They are associated with toxicity, but I still love them and play like it's a regular game. All I can say is, hang in there because some killer out there will love you!
---
had two similar situations earlier. one a guy was around the pillar and i downed him near the exit line and the other was trying to be cocky but i managed to chase him out of the exit and he died from end game collapse
---
you gain nothing intrinsically other than bragging rights
---
The power gauge honestly just takes a bit of getting used to, but I find that I can still perform well with her even with the nerfs. However I find that the nerf itself was implemented poorly as sometimes my blinks will bug out animation wise and/or I can’t blink even when I have an extra charge. As far as her add ons go, the majority of them are super gimmicky and not really worth running, which is kind of a bummer.
---
Krampus is just Germany's evil Santa. They don't even need a license for that.
---
This is the survivor swf when they genrush you and get a 3 out of 4 escape because you decided to camp like a dumbass
---
But who cares. It’s just a game.
---
People play to have fun and you're just a dick
---
I knew the point he was getting at, I was just making a joke.
---
You do the two Tutorials and know everything to play the game ^^^/^^^s

But seriously we need ACTUAL tutorials instead of "do that, do this, okay you're ready" and get thrown into matches.

Usually the other one is a visual glitch that is actually splinters. I have this on my doctor. Try equipping one and if it’s the glitched one, it will be a blank brown offering.

---
There's a shit ton to learn in this game. Watch some youtube videos for tips and good gameplay ideas. I've learnt a pile from truetalent and monto. You will get better - it just takes some time. Don't focus on escaping - just get stuff done. Work on gens/heal people/do totems/unhook - don't be afraid to run around. Good beginner perks are Spine Chill and Bond. Small game to help find ruin which is a game killer for new players. gl - it gets better!

That's good, currently waiting for my friends to get on. Hope you get better grades.
---
Having your first chase that took you a good full minute to complete get completely invalidated by some dumbass running up and bringing them up with a syringe was horseshit, and happened far more often than people like to admit. Losing that pressure early on can be the thing that makes you lose the round.
---
Probably the rework, but he recently got the ability to make survivors oblivious when sleeping.
---
even though the rift fragments affect the rift..? that's cool
---
"I think we did a pretty good job so far"😎
---
It’s embarrassing how far that guy went to try and make you into a toxic prick. He probably plays exactly like that Nea and doesn’t like you’re calling it out. Good on you for giving her what she deserved.
---
Survivors also have the glitch where they open thwir eyes wide open when doing gens and getting healed.
---
There are a lot of Moris because of the kill 4 survivors in a single trial
---
To be fair none of that is canon, that’s like using smash as an example of character strength. No pichu is not canonically as strong as the likes of bayonetta (as much as I wish it was)
---
well obviously there will be new rifts, but it just seems like it would give new players a huge advantage to clear the old challenges in the next rift without waiting for the next parts of the tome
---
Yeah instead I will let you get un hooked, Down you because you played like an idiot, run across the map and down your friend then come pick you up and still get hit with DS.
---
DS is a shit perk for shit players. The only justification that shitty survivors have for it is 'It is to prevent tunneling' when really its a crutch because your bad at the game.
---
Yeah I saw the 4th page (it looks like a big eye) and some of those challenges are just... bruh please bhvr why
---
Billeh
---
I feel like this kind of messing around occurs most frequently between friends and it adds to the game rather than takes away from it. I've swapped to Nancy just to agitate a killer, then run them to my friend who mains Nancy because we both find it hilarious. The killer will often stop and try to ascertain which Nancy is innocent and which is toxic and they'll often make me pay for my shenanigans.
---
Or when you end up in a corridor
---
I had the same problem yesterday on PS4 with Spirit for one round and the “Ruthless killer” in the top left corner was annoying as hell.
---
Thank youuu!!! Saw this few month ago in this sub, but couldnt find it again, but here it is!
---
Its not intentionally and will be back in the next Patch
---
What do you mean
---
Thanks, I love it.
---
Id run spine chill regardless its a really nice perk its like having a third eye
---
Better than waiting another 30 mins for a game
---
So what you’re saying is, you’re a Dwight camping at the hatch until the rest of the world dies.
---
Killer is earning like 4x more BP than survivor for me, plus it’s bloodhunt so I guess everyone plays killer. That’s why I wait like 10 minutes with surv, killer like 30 seconds. PS4 btw.
---
I think its fine how it is. Just change some numbers and it good
---
Resilience worked out far better than I expected it to. I didn't realize how big 30% would be (given you have to be injured for it, I didn't see it as a worthy perk til now)
---
After digging around, I think I know what's going on now.
---
The image is from an Instagram story posted by Natalia's friend. A fan account who follows said friend posted the picture (which I guess was meant to be private) on twitter without asking for permission. They didn't expect for it to blow up in the DBD community and now they're asking for it to be taken down because they don't want to get in trouble.
---
That looks like me when I get out of bed.
---
I said NOED beacuse that increases the chance of there being 3 people on hook during the end game collapse. Without NOED the killer will probably not even be able to get 3 hooks during the end game collapse.
---
I would ask one of the tech or pc building subreddits on here. They're very smart over there!
---
You might be right, but there is nowhere said Rin actually died. It's only said she was dying. Same situation with Bill.
---
Deadicated server 😎
---
It just means a 4k. I got it with 3 sacrifices and one guy DCing while already hooked for 3rd time (but there was DC icon instead of sacrifice).
---
She's a spirit....
---
Non-stop nuttin november is as good a reason as any
---
Why is autodidact so BAD, jesus bhvr, everything has to have an unnecessary downside
---
I prefer calling Adiris  Vommy Mommy
---
Thanks, I love you &lt;3
---
Yeah but now what? Theres no nearby hooks for them...
---
Nah. My Nurse games were all good, one was even a 4k and I caught some salt from the survivors that couldn't stop going down lol
---
Yeah, I refuse to play ghostface without cooldown addons, a lot of his addons are dogshit
---
The servers just suck, they are not killer dependent
---
Nancy has been chosen by (a number) players in her first 48 hours
---
The game is really tough at start, but the fact is that DBD doesn't have an insane number of new players abd most are people that play for a long time, so if you just started the game and you're rank 20, you will often face experienced killers that are rank 20 for different reasons, they don't play a lot, they play tons of survivor and kinda 0 killer so they're alteady good at the game etc.
---
And allow the survivor to go for risky plays because they're invincible? If they spare the ds until endgame then they will escape no matter what you do and they can afford taking hits for their teammates to make sure they escape too.
---
Probably The Shapeshifter
---
Honestly, watching what a survivor does for ten seconds of the match gives you a much better idea of their skill level than the rank ever did.
---
Stake out
---
Styptic Agent

Deliverance

The problem with him as a killer is, that you couldn't distinguish him from the survivors. I think this is the reason why every killer either wears a mask or has really distinguishing features. Also, it wouldn't feel like an unwinnable battle if there are 4 survivors versus one human with a bat (never watches twd, just googled the character, sorry if I'm wrong).
---
Cool thanks
---
Do you only play Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly? Because those are the only killers that has the potential to do consistently well without perks
---
F U C K   Y O U !
---
Agitation and Iron Grasp, on a small-ish map, most likely
---
Awesome. Dbd has a great community
---
Again, if a killer require a perk to be played then... Is weak, perks should only help a player, not carry him
---
fucking love this post, was funny, did laugh
---
Julie mask*
---
Couldn't trapper just place a trap on the key and demo place a portal on it?
---
What's that even from?
---
Still, theres 2 others to find
---
Oh how kind, the bht my sleep paralyze Monster in game!
---
Olaf new killer confirmed
---
Atleast he is honest
---
Good Luck with that I recently got 4 of my killers P3 with all perks Tier 3 (except Discordance coz well that works better at T1). 
---
And let me tell you brother it has been a toll, despite having two Double BP events so close.
---
What's going on is that the streamer called Hexy couldn't partecipate the event because he got banned recently for mori spamming(holding m1 and not completeling the mori action) and that's fine..but then someones DC's in the event, just to give the other survivor the hatch(which is considered exploiting), without getting punished by who organized the tournament or devs at all, it's like they forgot about it.
---
They were having fun but at the same time They basically gave the message that disconnecting from games is totally ok to do.
---
So surprisingly as discovering that water is indeed wet!
---
A new meaning to 'baby killers'
---
Sidney would be nice, no doubt about that. Still, I really like the design and lore of DbD ghostface
---
A glitch that looks like this.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=59&amp;v=dfZTMaW6VyM .. video not mine..
---
This comic is about solo players (should have writted it). You can be carried to rank 1 if you play with good SWF all the time, but reaching rank 1 solo every month... at the very least you know how to play to do that.
---
Well, we have an indefinite amount of time to complete them. 
---
The Tome challenges never go away. They're basically new Achievements/Trophies that actually provide in-game bonuses.
---
It's on par to achievements like *Where Did They Go!?* and other such difficult achievements.
---
If we only had a limited amount of time to complete them, I'd agree, but we don't.
---
no mans land?
---
The clown is Kenneth Chase, Jeffrey hawk is his pseudonym
---
Man I knew billy was a little OP but they didn't have to nerf his legs that's messed up
---
They do when provided with a proper report with proof.
---
That actually doesn't prove your point because there is more good players in rank 1 than there is in rank 15. Because yes there is people who don't play much and derank but there is also rank 15 people who are generally rank 15. So no your point isn't proven.
---
Hey this was literally a game i played vs a Trapper, Meg was just going from locker to locker so I had to do all the gens when everyone died. The Trapper rigged the exit gate but I still made it out. Baby Dwight lives!
---
diguise yourself as one of them, infiltrate their ranks
---
Not to mention that no one has to have ~~disconnected~~ died before the EGC , and guy 1 you have saved should not go save guy 3.
---
Ace is looking... Pretty fly these days, actually
---
Also it's so easy to rank up, players that have trouble doing that..probably dont have any other experience in any other pvp game
---
Yeah he has bags to hold 1/2/3 more traps.
---
I think he should start with all of his traps but can only hold one like yeah he would be over his carry limit at the start but when i play trapper i feel like i waste to much time walking over to the other side of the map to grab a trap to trap a pallet
---
He was barely in the first movie tbh
---
The number is either ~2,000 or ~7,000, and seems to be referencing the number of DLC purchases / plays in that timeframe
---
If you're not at least decent, you don't get to rank 1 playing solo. The last pips are the harder to get btw; maybe you get to purple ranks, but not rank 1.
---
Me when I get a 4 man swf and they all have flashlights.
---
I had a similar one where this Meg decided she'd hide in a locker and let me do all the work vs a Trapper. Well I did do all the work but then I myself hid near the gate, so he found her on the other one and I was the sole survivor. I was a Dwight btw.
---
"A collection of petals won't give your character perks ..." What is that about?
---
Refusing to act is trolling tho. They trolled and OP griefed
---
The fact that so many conditions have to occur for you to even *try* to have a shot at the challenge is crazy. 
---
I don´t mind hard stuff, but this seems a bit too restricting.
---
You right.
---
Good kids: awesome Susie, love the mask.
---
Toxic kids: why did you dress up as a NOED-using, tunneling camper?
---
Even is crossplay was only available in custom matches that would be great because I would love to play with my friends on different consoles even if I couldn’t play ranked matches.
---
YER GOIN IN THE BASEMENT, BITCH
---
-Freddy, 2019
---
Doubt you'll get banned. It's being spammed on this sub relentlessly so id say everyone is getting the same thing happen.
---
I mean that when you use the petal offerings, you may get a lot of bloodpoints to level up characters with, thereby getting new perks fur them, in contrast of forgetting you had them/ hoarding them on one character. That part's not necessarily fur people who don't have any 😅
---
Pig? In fair fight? We all know Amanda won't play faif
---
Ah a fellow ghostface main
---
For what reason except turning you on?
---
Well I’m green rank haven’t noticed much of a difference
---
Yeah but according to OP (and yeah i saw top comment, but im going off the assumption she didnt cooperate) she didnt do much at all.
---
I dont think anyone should be punished there, not even the Hag. Its those immersion breaking moments that make the game so memorable
---
If it takes 20 games to level up once in the rift, I need to play 620 more games (after completing ALL lvl 1 challenges) to get all the serum for this event. There’s no way people are going to be able to finish this event.
---
We are on the internet. Unless the devs decide to literally gift you free money, someone would always find a reason to complain. Hell, some fucker would probably still find something to complain about if they sent you that money.
---
Within the group I usually play with, a loud bloodcurdling scream is used to tell everyone that Mike is about, we never mention him by name, just incoherent sobs and gibberish whilst fleeing from the gen.
---
Hmm guess it’s just a consistent string of bad luck for me then, but at least I get BP to eventually get a decent perk loadout quicker than before.
---
wOW I loVe ThiS GAme
---
Ahh what? Yes it does it’s just additive not multiplicative...
---
Didnt Last Year The Nightmare get the rights to him?
---
Did he have bond
---
Sure, you can down then but they could have unbreakable or they'll get picked up by a teammate in 2 sec. And if they save it for end game, how is that my fault? There's nothing I can do about it.
---
So, this sub basically
---
That's what "not stacking" means. Of course it's additive. What else is supposed to happen with the bloodpoints you get from the offering??
---
Thats kinda meh pig cant get more traps so she cant stay in the trapping game as long as trapper plus she could run into his traps but if she couldnt set of his traps she could then chase people into his traps but demo would probably be better at that
---
Demo and trapper have many traps and portals
---
Didn't say it was any good. Just thematic and fun.
---
So you have to do this challenges with a 4 man SWF at best, but who on this subreddit actually has friends ._.
---
There is a separate one for killing all survivors by your own hand
---
Well almost every killer is weak.
---
I guess
---
you don’t have to mash it like your life depends on it, you have about 0.3 seconds from each button press or you die. i recommend binding it to the left or right d-pad on console. it makes less noise and your right thumb is free to use the camera
---
I actually agree tbh. Killers dodge when I'm solo even because they think we're all swf and it's aids.
---
Faster than a bastard manic, more powerful than a loco madman, it’s super Freddy!!!!
---
Is like working on a gen, but instantly
---
Plot twist when a player is toxic as a survivor and a killer
---
Everything got nerfed moron, but suvovirs getting nerfed with a wet tissue, meanwhile doing the killers "job" is borderline nerfed so hard that you have to be an abuse toy boy for coxky disgusting overpowered 4 POWERROLEW, go and play, not like people you have as a SUVIVOR, go and actually play killer once..
---
I never understood why people bother doing shit like this? What's the point of buying a game and waste your time doing this? How horrible must your life be that this is entertaining to someone? The mindset these people have is something I will never understand.
---
Yeah, and the guy is cute as heck. What are you gonna do about it?
---
That's when its solo que. In a swf where they have borrowed time, ds and adrenaline its a huge struggle where you cant afford to make a single mistake
---
The guilt these challenges are causing during an event is too much! Just got done messaging a sweet Baby Feng who totally understood but the sweatiness required to complete these is bringing me down!
---
Matchmakings just booty
---
People think that it's one of those useless perks that only Blendettes run but it's quite good, I don't get why you would want to be caused by the killer tho, even if I hate to say it because not finding anyone is frustrating, hide as much as you can
---
I belive you pal. Since the killer did say that their motive for making sure nea wss killed was cuase they were tea bagging at pallets something people who try to run a killer around would do yes its toxic but its a good plan and they did have a good amount of points so the were doing things probably cleansing totems and running the killer around
---
Step Brothers is a masterpiece
---
And you win your team 60 seconds of time which us enough to do a gen or 2 with toolboxes and prove thyself...
---
I only Dodge if I see more than 2 toolboxes, or 4 Claudettes/neas because I hate survivors that play  hiding all game.
---
That perk is trash right? Is it actually viable?
---
Yeah for real I was excited to get back into this game and now I’m sitting here for now 15 min for just one match... I mean cmon
---
I'm on tier 26, every tier ask you the same amount?  I didn't check
---
It only gets worse. I'm killer rank 6 and only get queued up with 2's and 1's. Like ALL THE TIME.
---
That’s genuinely really adorable. 
---
Now I want to see a picture of Bruce Campbell hugging a similar pillow.
---
I enjoy my time with Quentin thank you very much
---
Rude.
---
I'm not a Quentin main but I'm playing him cause I has 50 offerings from leveling him last year.
---
Idk why, but Russian survivors arent altruistic and a lot of Russian killers play like scumbags Camping with 5 gens and using op addons :(
---
Well as a killer i just wanna play a chill game and have fun but almost every game i play against is against a toxic swf with multiple toolboxes, flashlights or keys and im definitely dodging that. Even with ruin on, the game is going stupidly fast especially when u play against swf, u down 1 survivor and 2 gens are done already. It's just so stupid to play against swf man they just don't care, they want to end the game as quick as possible doing gens insanely fast. Now people will probably say "ooh no you are just a bad killer just split pressure maaan it's eaassy ehehehe" but hey, no its not easy at all. You down one survivor other 2 are doing gens and only 1 survivor will came to the save no mather what because they're communicating. The game is stupidly unbalanced especially against swf so killers will keep dodging lobbys no mather what.
---
Theres not really a difference between those ranks
---
I genuinely think we could be getting a Doctor Sleep chapter- adult Danny Torrance as the survivor, Rose the Hat as the killer and the decrepit Overlook as the map. I think it could work.
---
I noticed something similar...Perma Kindred status even if the one with that perk is dead
---
Nice, that was a pretty original idea
---
I like it. It has shades of Bane from Batman with Venom injections.
---
Leatherfaces respect nothing and no one
---
You can get to Tier 2 without it but can’t unlock all the lore/bloodpoints/fragments
---
Someone give this an award
---
Thank you so much &lt;3 
---
It means a lot that someone liked it :)
---
Averaging a level per day isn't that hard at all. Sure people have work/school/etc, and can't necessarily play every day, but it shouldn't be hard at all to get 7 levels a week. I mean I'm already at rank 20 and it's been like 3 days.
---
We don't need Pennywise, we need an original killer.
---
Can you actually do these in KYF?
---
do we get different challenges ? because i didn't get this one
---
This is my experience as well. You hardly have to learn anything as survivor until you hit rank 8 or so. Now I find it hard to rank up because I haven't really figured out how to properly run the killer.
---
Problem is that 1) status effects like blindness are hardly an issue unless you're using specific, usually non-meta perks, mangled can slow the game down a little, and hemorrhaging makes survivors easier to track, mostly useless unless you have bloodhound though. 2) it really only does things against killers usually specific add-ons because perks that inflict status effects tend to not have a duration and 3) the only status effects that are really dangerous is exposed and hindered, a good survivor can last with mangled, hemorrhaging, and blindness. Vigil doesnt effect exposed and add-ons that use hindered are rare. Clown is the only one who really utilizes hindered, but I don't think vigil helps against his gas.
---
A perk that seems like a jack of all trades really just isn't, it's very niche, and barely gets use in a majority of matches. And even when it does, it's only small reduction to timers, nothing too game changing.
---
Its trash
---
True, but if NOED is in play getting those unhooks will be even harder for you, with the killer moving faster as well as you being 1-shot (not to mention being strained by the time limit)
---
It´s just a bit too much IMO. I don´t have an issue with most T4 challenges but some are not well thought-out.
---
I can hear the “What now” when Ash faces the Trapper from here
---
I'm pretty new, wouldn't separating help prevent gen rushing in the early game?
---
It's about the crows we met along the way.
---
Idk, that's not that good because you still have a loading screen to deal with. I think it should take place in the lobby once it is full, along with what you suggested. That feels fair to me

It is so rare to see a post on this subreddit that is actually funny. Nice job op.
---
I dont wait long for survivor games though. Are people experiencing this? I usually have to wait 5 minutes minimum for a killer game, and I feel like I'm seeing way more swf teams than I used to. Makes me wonder if the game is dying off or something.
---
So was Billy on LF but they still got the license and made LF a thing!
---
Someone DC'd early in the game while I was doing this challenge. I felt bad the whole time I killed everyone else.
---
Hannah from Until Dawn.
---
No, by getting in their heads I mean getting in their heads. Are they at the pallet? Have they run away? Are they walking in a straight line, or are they making a huge circle? Are they to my left or to my right? THAT's what I love about Spirit, getting into people's heads and messing with them.
---
Damn, synchronised. I'm a killer main and that was still impressive haha.
---
From where I was hanging on the hook it seemed like an 18 carat run of bad luck

Yes, hence why he said it was detrimental to the killer. Technically it can be useful if the team has something like Prove Thyself since it will increase the time it takes for them to bunch up, but in most situations working on multiple gens at the same time gives more overall progress. Even then the shroud will only place them so far apart due to the limits on the actual map, and a Shroud of Union/Binding will trump a Shroud of Separation.
---
It's one of those offerings you use because you have it and why not, but it's almost NEVER going to be more useful than a BP booster or Mori.
---
What to choose: ghost myers or shirtless myers?
---
Devs: both
---
What about instead of ruin maybe thanatophobia?
---
Chibi minis, yes!

Wow thanks that's very helpful!
---
Funny you mentioned being “entitled to a win” since this is what your post is about. If 2 gens need to be done, then get ready for trying to find the last survivor for 20 min because you’ll never find them. Or, the “toxic Ace” will take the game hostage. In a 1v1, a survivor simply can’t do gens by himself, why is this so hard to get?
---
Imagine being such an awful killer that your primary contribution to the game is a buff to one of the most powerful survivor perks.
---
Thank you for Huntress meme. It's the little things while all my fav killers get tiered into the ground. /f to hum respects.
---
Thats the game at anytime of day
---
/s?
---
Probably good if you don’t want them to heal, but it won’t slow down gen progress like Ruin would. 
---
Imo Thana works better when survivors refuse to heal, so Legion, Plague, Pig, Myers and, to some degree, M1 killers in general. But Coulro is not so good on them.
---
Sorry I didn't see those posts
---
Entity blocker has been a thing for a while.
---
What? No, what are you talking about?
---
But ruin is pointless if the survivors can hit skill checks
---
Holy shit you just straight up killed him
---
And that’s why I specified green ranks! That’s where Ruin is most effective, usually. With Thana they can still hit great skillchecks and benefit even more from those than with Ruin still on.
---
So does Legion and perhaps Ghostface too? Or maybe my internet just had a blooper whilst playing with/against him
---
Most edges on the hill (if done proper) won't do that even when sprinting. We sweaty boys know how to abuse 😎
---
Rank 17? Noob! Rank 4 here.
---
That’s genius
---
Lol. There's plenty of counter play to spirit. You just suck.
---
There's no incentive to play against full groups. It's not balanced for that and though most are normal/average, the ones that aren't make it super unfun.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is not to give a free escape for the 4th survivor even though it works that way.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is a way for the killer not to be held hostage by that survivor because he got mad for being destroyed and decided to hide.
---
Yeah, Russian players at large are pretty unpleasant. Absolutely not all of them, there's a few really chill streamers I've vs'd before, too, but on average it's really bad.
---
Queue times are fine for me at red. If you don't enjoy playing killer, don't play it until MM changes(again.) Knowing bhvr, it wont be changed. I'm not your buddy, typical passive aggressive reddit response
---
Respects him because vIdEo GaMeS eNcOuRaGe ViOlEnCe.
---
But for red ranks would thana be more viable
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor and playing solo most of the time. Normally I got mostly red ranks in my team but the last couple of days I got every rank from 1-20. Usually it matches me with rank 7-9.
---
When I play with my two friends which are rank 6 and rank 8, we also always get rank 7-9 even though with the new ranking it should be people from my rank.
---
I think something in the matchmaking is broken again
---
That was some *Ghostbusters* type shit. I love it.
---
I'll prolly save blood points then switch to killer and give it a go but it's prolly gonna be a stiff learning curve.
---
Where did he go
---
Just like who ?
---
I get an Ash voice line whenever I press a button whether Killer or Survivor amd Ash sometimes isn't at the campfire or in the match
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqg5bd/tier_4_archive_challenges/
---
&gt; Am I missing some way to get these, or is it really just like that?
---
You are missing the fact that Serum will remain in the Rift until it ends, in 67 days. The Serum is not related to the Blight Event.
---
The Serum expires 2 Werks alter the rift closes. It basically has nothing to do with the event. You'll still get it after the event and you can use ist then.
---
When doors  are open, you have no idea where the survivors are most of the times. If you leave the hook, someone will unhook the survivor and bodyblock for the injured survivor. So unless you play a killer that one shots or Huntress, there's nothing you can do. That's why IF you want to secure that kill you have to camp.
---
True I got a map found a feng who ran for a second then let me down them I picked them up and D.C., but it was rank 16 and I play like rank 10.
---
please use the search function before posting. this got posted really often.
---
even 7000 is not that high tho
---
"Had to"
---
He didn't even seem too fussed when he lossed some fingers
---
Hehe
---
Typical killer Main thing to say. You probably can't win a single round without a mori
---
Killers who DC when the exit gates are powered, Survivors who DC when they get downed, Killers who facecamp early game, Survivors who tbag at the exit gate, etc
---
Huh. Well, good to know
---
I think everybody in this game is very quick to assume toxicity; you or your teammates might have just done something the killer assumed to be toxic so he decided to fuck with you for it. 
---
It’s shitty, but so is every other explanation. What’s also shitty is survivors teabagging at the exit gate instead of just ending the match; but nobody asks why they do that. 
---
People are assholes; for a lot of people, if they get 12 survivors in a row who teabag at the gates, they’ll take it out on the 13th even if it’s a completely different match and player. You’re the only one who can decide whether you actually did anything that could reasonably be seen to provoke their behavior, *and* whether you care about trying to avoid it in future.
---
What are you talking about? Pebble is the best perk in the game. Almost all survivors that use pebble against me get out alive. Especially when I see them throwing it. Must follow shiny rock
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Survivors who dc when they get find first
---
I agree. I honestly lost passion to even try the rift because I know I won’t be able to finish it. :/ same with the battle pass. It’s just so Grindy and less rewardy.
---
Just let them do 1 gen with no problem
---
I cannot believe the ppl in here saying it’s fucking toxic to run from the killer....now I know why I always get face camped and tunneled...you’re all fucking stupid
---
Wow, those masks look fantastic!
---
How did you make them? They don’t like like just paper, I’m curious
---
*stares in Mikey*
---
I just focus gens and if I stumble across the totem while goimg to another gen or being chased I cleanse it.
---
Bbq can be countered by hiding in a locker and noed can be cleansed before and after it has activated. The survivor ones grant immunity and allows them to bodyblock. I think noed is bullshit but ds in a swf is even worse
---
The fragments expire before the new rift opens, that time’s fragments only work with the current rift
---
It's fun.. yeah, the first two are okay, but when you get to tome 3 it gets hilarious and in tome 4, there are some nearly impossible quests that suck pretty hard.
---
I have only 3 quests left in the first tome and one of them is "kill all 4 survivors in a single trail"
---
So I have to bring a pink mori, hope no one DC's, hope no one kills himself and I need to worry about the hatch -,-
---
Decent off pick if you can secure a one hit down like Leatherface or quick one two punch like huntress. Fun w Make Your Choice on Demogorgon.
---
I used mori, I dced because I had to... And idk how but it somehow counted as 4K and got the challange
---
Why is this sub upvoting a standard blendette? I thought this archetype was hated by the community.
---
Yes!
---
I once saw a video of a quadruple blind. It was insane
---
If you can cheese your way up to rank 1 by playing with friends, said rank does not have a value anymore
---
thats him, there \^\^\^
---
Rin Yamaoka is here
---
I agree with him
---
I don't think he does
---
Removed for spam
---
I use it in a basement build with the huntress. I usually get 3-4k. It's strong in a build revolving around the basement, if you are not into that don't bother using it.
---
You should get it without the tome, if you play ~1 hour a day.
---
For 2 days I got to ~16 rift-level, although I've completed the entire page, which should give around 10-ish levels, not more
---
Can i say how much i love this? growing up watching the super mario show makes me feel nostalgic looking at this. if you ever make an actual animated series out of these i would literally scream with happiness.
---
Ack, brainfart. Thanks for letting me know
---
LOL
---
Don't worry it will get worse
---
Last one I have an idea do swf get 3 to distract killer you do gens
---
Yeah? And then? 4 more to go? Farming is just really boring and i dont like it
---
True, true...
---
\^This. All these "It's trash" comments...
---
No it's not trash. It's just a perk for a specific playstyle. It isn't meta or a good allrounder, but it's not "trash".
---
I appreciate that, and I will do that instead. I jumped right into the paid battle pass too thinking it would speed me up since I can’t play much, and it doesn’t, and I’d have to pay to jump a single level. 
---
But I will play at least an hour a day, thank you!
---
Please leave this poor guy alone... He's not that good...
---
Trapper mains rise up
---
 Freddy is now one of the best killers in the game now! As long as people are asleep, you can completely counter loops with his snares. Honestly, I prefer dream snares over dream pallets because they work on any loop. Along with that, pop goes the weasel is brutal on him, especially because he can teleport to gens. Overall, he is a very effective killer.
---
Lmfaooooooo
---
'You must down with a basic attack' is a drawback? In what universe? I'd also argue the 40s cooldown isn't a massive obstacle considering it's pretty rare you'll down two survivors within 40s of each other.
---
Its about having some humor and not being a try hard.
---
Dc also counts as a kill. Saw it myself when I was going for this challenge.
---
It's a perk only good for camping basement or can be useful for when survivors go to find the chest. I've been caught by it a few times it's not the worst perk ingame
---
i give quentin's special treatment when i pmay for some reason(letting them get hatch if they're alive, taking hits, giving items, if they're opening a chest i pretend i dont see them, etc.) i feel bad for them 😔
---
It’s out now.  Archives, Rift, 2x event, blighted event are all live.
---
A survivor (me) who loops them the entire game. I enjoy teabagging them, pointing at them, etc. Generally I am toxic and it's really fun!
---
Appreciate the feedback. I was thinking something along the lines of Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and BBQ&amp;C. Being able to end chases quick seems really good on him.
---
Very very nice.. get these DC's is easy now days
---
Having survivors group up can be very good for the killer. You can get multiple easy hits and pressure them away from the gen they’re on, plus it’s more efficient in terms of time for survivors to do separate gens.
---
Losing one generator early to three survivors grouped up is far less painful than losing three gens early because the survivors all split up.
---
I have a friend who just switched from console to PC and they’ve been using pebble since they have nothing else good on their Adam. It can surprisingly come in clutch and distract a killer who’s chasing someone.
---
I wouldn’t run it normally, but it has its uses.
---
no, one of the 3D modelers just modeled him in their free time
---
Hes basically the lady from the scream tv series in terms of backstory so theres that going for him
---
I’m not invested enough in the game to do that, just thought you guys would’ve enjoyed this little leak
---
So unique, and even greater than that because it's not Legion.
---
Still people be like “BiT RaNk DoESn’T MaeTtER”
---
did you forget the /s?
---
Not on Switch. No archives, no rift, no blighted event, ONLY bloodhunt.
---
nope
---
Yes, you are not the first one to see them and someone posted all of them. 
---
I hope most of those get changed to remove “in a single match” because they all look pretty much impossible (especially when you have to select them).
---
I wish i was good enough for that but i have only been playing for like a week or two haha. I’m r4 somehow though. I think the ranking system is a bit fucked. Definitely gonna try and practice a bit so i can do Toxic Nea some justice!
---
Definitely a massive difference n even more so if you’re red ranks within the first weeks of reset
---
“Dedicated servers look to be up and well. I’d say we’ve done a... pretty good job so far”
---
Seems to strong.
---

Probably either black friday or xmas
---
Yeah like with apex legends, smite, fortnite you get through the battle pass much faster if you pay, plus you gain additional exp towards it if you play with friends who also paid. I don’t know why they didn’t implement that here. I would say if you love DBD, don’t buy the battle pass until the last day (if you complete it). The cosmetics really aren’t that exciting... and I know it’s hard to say what else they could have offered besides cosmetics, but this game has like a million paid cosmetics, and it’s getting annoying at this point. (For me anyway)
---
Idk if you really need SF and enduring, if you get that first hit, you can end chases shortly after. (Or unless they are asleep already) I might run brutal strength because smart survivors are going to drop pallets early or run away from the loop when you’re setting up snares. EDIT: BBQ and POP are a great combo on Freddy.
---
what is it then
---
That's when you slap on Franklin's.
---
They’re scared.  I was terrified of the basement when I first started.
---
Not even a little bit.
---
"He runs fast, jumps at you, bleeds you out over the course of the game".
---
It's strong enough that it might be usable at red ranks, roughly the power level of Billy.
---
That's not "overkill", that's what the target power level should be.
---
Damn, that was some fancy footwork! Nice job!
---
Why the fuck should his m1 be non lethal that’s just so fkn dumb what is this Freddy v2
---
Where’s his salt?
---
Killers who run to their ruin totem at the start of the match then dc after they walk away from it after hearing the explosion.
---
This is just Legion with a more complicated DW system, a leap mechanic, and is only able to down survivors with feral frenzy.
---
He wasn’t ready
---
Sweet Home Alabama!
---
I cleanse against plague, Always
---
If your whole team does it you're fine
---
People just never tried to learn how to outplay the red vomit so somehow as a community they decided not cleansing is best
---
I disagree, I will always cleanse in every game against her and never be broken. 
---
You will go down in one hit and I'll call you dumb for not cleansing
---
Makes you wonder why they (and I don't just mean BHVR) treat us like children on console. Fine, we can't upgrade the hardware, but why is it that we don't even have the option to fiddle with some graphics settings if a particular game isn't running well? Not even a simple high-mid-low preset option? It's one of the reasons I made the jump to PC.
---
In my experience Matchmaking between 17-20 takes a bit longer because there are less people in that rank range.
---
I had that issue when I came back after a couple resets.  Bahroo has the same issue.
---
This is why I’m trying to unlock borrowed time. I try to get people off the hook bc I know how it feels to be left in the basement to die.
---
Can't imagine how obnoxious that must be.
---
I appreciate these
---
So true haha 😂
---
...because he moves at 125% speed.
---
We've already seen with old Legion that you can't balance high speed M1's that are lethal. 4 hits or more for a down is garbage but annoying, and 3 hits is flat out broken. 
---
He has a secondary attack that can deal lethal damage at the cost of being less reliable.
---
Literally same!
---
It's more likely that it's the bloodhunt than archives
---
From what I read, in a week or two 
---
Something like that
---
Well I'm not ganna explain it if you dont even understand english that well
---
Humour part yeah i understand, like i said i would've most likely let the Ace go. But there's nothing try hard in what OP did? If a survivor gets themselves in such a position *(mind you he could've stopped looting when he heard the heartbeat and run)*, why wouldn't the killer use that situation to their advantage?
---
I don't understand what the problem is though? It's just a picture of an actress (someone we've seen *many* times before) holding memorabilia of her character in a game? I really don't get why they would be mad that the DbD community loves the photo, aha...
---
Who eats a hot dog with a fork?
---
Are you for real? Or is this sarcasm?
---
I do this too, but it also weirds me out a little because several of the killers share first names with some of my cousins. So when people are talking about killers and using their first names, I sometimes feel like I’m at a family gathering and my aunt is yelling at my cousins for not helping to clear the table.
---
Thought that too but it started happening the day archives was released, before the bloodhunt started.
---
Just use those games to rank up, i haven't seen any boosters at around rank 5
---
It is, Aiming over gens has always been a thing
---
Why would I be being sarcastic?
---

I have been on this sub for one week and I know that it must be.
---
I was playing at rank 8 last night.  Almost everyone was a higher rank. 2/3 red ranks per lobby.
---
Survivor games will take me anywhere from 10-25 minutes to find a lobby.
---
Killer will take me 3 minutes max.
---
you aren't forced to finish missions to progress in the battlepass. Just playing gives you xp.
---
Because you blame it in the archives... And that doesn't make any sense. It is because there is 2x BP.

High Rank play is just boring when you think about it. You pretty much NEED to be playing the game smart and to 100% maximum effiency to maintain and win any games/to pip.
---
It's great. Gets me more kills than I thought too, survivors get very confused.
---
Ring-a-ding-ding
---
Maybe the killer equipped the perk "No Sight"? Seems like it...
---
“If they bleed out all the way, they will become broken and will instantly be claimed by the entity the next time they are put into the dying state”
---
I agree that Legion needs a rework/buff but going back to what they were and adding instagibs like this is pretty bad.
---
A lot of the nerfs/changes made to Legion were often contradictory in purpose and really harshly punished them for problems one fix would have solved.
---
Legion essentially just needs a majority of these changes removed, built-in Bamboozle and insta-breaking pallets they vault, and a complete rework of Deep Wounds to something that is a BIT below “The survivor gets mori’d for free”
---
Same here, played about 50 games after archives released and not one farming killer or people that want to farm as survivor.
---
So you want him to give up his kill in order to hit people who are standing right next to the exit and give them a \*speed boost\* in order to get out?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Look, Camping is a dick move in 90% of gameplay scenarios, but once the generators are powered the doors only take 20 seconds to open and then people are out of there. There's not much you can do as a killer in that situation other than hope they come for the one guy who you know where they are.

Hag is one of the best imo
---
This changes the difficulty a little bit.. I still hate these Challanges
---
Y can't we just say gg :(
---
Hag is no where near the bottom. One of strongest killers. Legion is still shit
---
Wtf? What are you on about?
---
Legion is kinda the same In The “is that a surv-OH SHIT ITS NOT” aspect
---
Playing survivor is difficult when you first start out.  You need to learn the maps/spawns.  This game is about time management.  Not wasting time hiding when the killer isn’t around and wasting the killers time with loops.
---
I’d recommend watching a YouTube video on structure spawns and looping.  Play matches when your buddies aren’t on. Go in with the intent of being chased.  Practice running the killer.  Practice hugging close to the loop with out running into it.  When all else fails try some different moves/360s when you’re about to get hit.
---
If you die it doesn’t matter.  It’s practice.  On to the next match.
---
Playing low ranks has other hazards built in.  Fellow new survivors are bad with time management.  There are high rank survivors who only play killer for dailies.  They’re low rank at killer but understand the game at a high level.  A lot of the time you may be facing under ranked killers.  Your friends higher rank also pulls you toward higher ranked matchmaking.
---
Farming wouldn’t help the challenges. Like who needs help hitting 3 skill checks with a perk. It’s because bloodhunt

Considering how strong SWFs can be, I doubt it. 
---
I'm not taking guff from a SWF that thinks they're hot shit because they bullied the shit out of a baby Wraith or something.  
---
Don't go pulling the moral high ground on me either, pal.  A lot of SWFs think they can be Ochido 2.0 and behave similarly to him.
---
Why do people thing doc is bottom tier, his shock can cancel actions and prevent them for a sec or so after shock, he can slow down the game with tier 3 madness, and has the best track potential in the game...
---
In addition to it lasting 70 days, you also get new tomes every 2 weeks (I think).
---
I mean he does take pictures with his Mori
---
The last number isn't a zero, and I don't think they're going to write a data so specific up to the ones digits. From what I can see, the last character is a 'K', and writing something like '200K players' make much more sense and significant enough to be worth reporting to the actress.
---
Justice was served
---
It's the opposite for me. I usually wait like maybe 5 min for a survivor game and killer games takes more than 10 min to find :/
---
You need to balance around all ranks not just high rank.
---
Hag is super high tier wtf?
---
the killer is joe.
---
Youthful energy is basically what feral frenzy is because if that's what his normal movement speed should be, that's a bit much. I am summarizing what said different system is, which is basically a more complicated DW. And what the fuck I mean by "Can only down with feral frenzy", You explicitly stated that normal attacks can only injure but not kill, which would lead me to believe that the only way for you to down a person it to use his ability, so unless this Legion is able to down people without his ability, then he becomes both useless, and just an even more annoying killer.
---
So I have a question for you. If Frenzy isn't here, then what is? The lunge? And what do you mean it "Goes through pallets"? Does he just dive through the fuckers, because that would be terrifying to see.
---
Well yeah but for killer challenges there's "hook 8 survivors" and "sacrifice 5 survivors"
---
Haven't seen any farmers on my end, but like others have answered it is not the archives but the bloodhunt, as for the unnecessary reports don't bother, the devs have nothing against farming
---
Being able to sprint across the map at blazing high speeds is fun and extremely useful in certain scenarios (start of the game, patroling far off gens) when you are on some maps however, cutting chase times in possibly less than half of how they usually last is much more impactful. :)
---
rank 10s
---
I did most of the Gens and then I was tryna open the other exit but he came towards me so I looped him and he went for my teammate and tryna all escaped  and I tryed to escape  when he hit me but I got lucky and was able to escape
---
Huntress is pretty high tier though. High enough that it's rank 1 material, probably the 5th best killer in the game. Not high enough that this sub grabs their pitchforks and cries for nerfs like nurse or spirit. Best be thankful.
---
I feel like Medic from TF2 could fit really well if the devs wanted something else from valve, after all he is insane
---
Rank 1 been playing with rank 15 teammates here.
---
1. There is *no* active frenzy.
---
2. 125% is his base speed. 
---
3. OG DW is a short term bleedout that blocks healing and leads to a down if untreated, and is treated with a simple healing action. This DW is a long term bleedout that leads to what is effectively a mori if untreated, is seperate from Health state, and is treated by changing your playstyle to one that has running as a last resort. It doesn't matter if it's complicated, it isn't  an unbalanceable mess like the old DW, which had its functionality flat out removed for that exact reason.
---
4. Yes , you can only down with his active ability. His active ability is not a Frenzy. If anything, that would juat be his passive state, but even that's not totally comparable. His active ability is his pounce.
---
5. Instead of Frenzy, he has passively  improved speed and a pounce.
---
6. Not through, over. He jumps. Think Demo shred with about half the range, but he goes straight over pallets instead of crashing into them.
---
Whyd thia guy get downvoted? He's... you know... right? Or is it because he refuses to participate in the "Devs bad" circle jerk?
---
Get the clothes you want.  I was a P3 blendette at launch.  Now I never use her bloody outfit.
---
How would anyone know without you providing all the specs of the laptop and what sort of internet you have? And did you check to see whether or not those specs meet the minimum requirements for the game?
---
I agree, an xenomoroh would be too ridiculous for this game. Also an OG killer would be better.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
I bought it on a third party site for cheaper than the sale. If you know where to look it's cheap still ;)
---
Meh, I could really see the headless horseless horseman or whatever his name is. Ik he’s more of a comedic character but he’s one of the only tf2 characters that fit the role.
---
No thanks, id rather have fun than to play against sweaty people
---
It's like a slot machine, if you get 777 you finish the rift automatically
---
We had a good match but I'm still gonna be toxic after when you let me win
---
If anyone has played The Evil Within, they'll know that The Keeper or Laura are some of the scariest killers/monsters in the game they'll be awesome addition to DBD.  Then we need Sebastian Castellanos and Joseph Oda as survivors.
---
[Image Source](https://twitter.com/threadbare30s/status/1190011308545937408)
---
So you can only down people with his pounce and the small chance somebody won't mend?
---
No thats how the perk works.
---
DBD devs are french so sometimes they don't write very clear instructions in English and after watching a lot of their streams I have realized M. Cote is cheeky that way. Sometimes they just leave the confusing description as is to mess with players.
---
That'd be awesome !

Get rid of NOED, don't profane my girl &gt;.&lt; She is already pretty strong.
---
For addons I recommend charge and speed (perfectly Bloody Hair brooch and Dirty Uwabaki/Yakuyoke Amulet).
---
The spirit also deserves to have the fifth perk:"Maximum Tunnel Vision".
---
I'd totally pay for this. Would really like an Evil Within chapter or a Silent Hill one.
---
Unless you're in indoor maps like Hawkins 😢
---
Only pounce.
---
Them not mending and bleeding out doesn't make them go down.
---
It just makes them die the next time they go down.
---
But there's nothing wrong with him
---
Oh no! It's Greg the Demogorgon!
---
Looks nice, but I wouldn't want to run into you at night.
---
Not the point. And I don't go to parties, hate dancing. Prefer relaxing at home or calling a few friends over.
---

He's high reward, low skill.
---
Alright, this is gunna be long
---
1. Buy a brown paper mask online (the one I got was shaped like a human face and was about $5 without shipping. It should be made of a payer of black plastic and brown paper covering each side.)
---
2. Cut off the nose, eyebrows, and a bit of the chin. Try to make it as flat as possible.
---
3. Use tin foil to make it flat but still rounded slightly. Use duct tape to hold it down. You can fold up pieces of the foil and duct tape over them to fix any flat spots.
---
4. Use a cork screw to make eye holes big enough to fit scissors inside and widen to the point where you can see.
---
5. Cover the mask in two layers of newspaper dipped in white glue. Try to keep it as flat as possible.
---
6. Paint the mask.
---
7.  Drill small holes in the side, and attach a ribber band around the back to hold it to your face.
---
8. Put up your hood and stab some survivors!
---
I tried to play this game and waited for a match for about 15 minutes as both killer and survivor and was never placed before I gave up.  Is this normal or do I have a firewall problem?  The game gives no feedback when looking for a match
---
isn't ghostface's name is Jed Olsen or somethng?
---
Wait... the point of Borrowed Time isn't to farm hook saves??
---
/s
---
Ummmm no killer is 20mins surv is 10mins
---
I cant see how they could have intentionally designed it to be disadvantageous to rank up. Are you positive that it isn't a bug? With the misleading description combined with the deleterious effects, it seems like a bit much. Even if one could be described as poor localization, stacked together it strikes me the wrong way
---
Trapper is fine, only thing I'd add is the ability to rearm traps. Plague needs a rework but nothing major, just an incentive for survivors to cleanse and a nerf to corrupt. Clown just needs a buff.
---
The only reason I can think of is that the basement is a lot more dangerous than most other hooks, as if they save you, there's a chance the killer will be able to block them from leaving and then get two kills
---
Blendett at her finest
---
I can’t say that because the person I play with is named Evan
---
I agree, he has no downsides. He should have  110% move speed and like 80% ms while revving.
---
Most people arent even aware they are reposting.

I haven't seen much toxicity yet, only from a duo where one went to unhook his buddy in front of me...without borrowed time....and after I hooked his buddy again....he tried to do it again...Lmao
---
Pennywise is a mimic tbf everyone seem to be missing that point.
---
Or you know, understand what good sportsmanship is.
---
I don't know how but somehow I got into level 4 in The Archives after switching from the Collection menu back into Challanges. Was able to replicate it once by just pressing a bunch of the lore stuff in there and switching back and forth. Not sure what triggered it though. Wasn't able to click level 2 or level 3 from the level 4 menu but I was able to go back into level 1. I also wasn't able to select any of the challanges.
---
Challanges seems to be a bit tougher and with greater rewards. 60.000 Bloodpoints for each challange completed.  
---
All 3 of the master challanges in the center unlocks the "Revelations" lore so I guess we have to wait until level 4 is out before we'll see what's in there.
---
Running no one escapes death. Imma leave real quick
---
I once said to my friend the killer is Danny (ghostface)
---
Facts.
---
Charms are just cosmetic. Instaheals got changed with the most recent patch and yes it was needed
---
I messaged the support team and they said they don't like it to happen I had the mail somewhere :c
---
You did what devs could not do
---
If any of the legion cosplayers are like me, we do it because it’s cheap, our favorite killer, and there are so many variations that we could never be copying each other. The highest cost thing I bought was a 20 dollar mask
---
Why does her TR disappear at 11 seconds in?
---
Well you killed him, that's good :) else it'd be pretty depressing
---

---
Needed from a killer’s pov ? Can you elaborate why from an objective pov ?
---
I play survivor main and from mine, this is nothing but completely shitting on a very useful add on. Then again, this is a survivor talking 100% so im biased.
---
This post is obviously satire
---
When someone is that much better than me i just go find someone else lol
---
PD: Plus rank reset shouldn't be a thing.
---
[wow what a spoiler](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqiubq/this_is_the_level_4_challanges_in_the_archives/f64lxif/)
---
Just kill them all, close the hatch and finish off the last guy who desperately tries to open the gate and even kneels before you, begging for mercy :)
---
Yes it's needed from a killer pov. Survivors already have multiple second chances through perks so having even more through add ons is just stupid and makes it easy to bully the killer
---
We. Know.
---
the rift will close after 70 days(currently 67 days left I believe),and a new one will come later on but the archives and tomes will stay there forever.
---
Everyone is jeff
---
This actually makes a lot more sense, 2000 seemed really small.
---
Yeah this should get us some "Killer mains, I'm sorry" posts or "So I finally played killer because of those challenges...."
---
Ohhhh great point!!
---
It was needed in general. I’m a survivor main and I still say it was needed, and even with the heal over time? Incredibly useful still.
---
If a way to counter a killer is using a perk or buying headphones the killer is unbalanced.
---
And walking back or being unpredictable doesn't always work.
---
I definitely think you should try drawing them in fun poses and adding some personality to them. Ex. The Claudette charm in game.
---
Toolboxes = Franklin's  
---
Flashlights = Lightborn  
---
Medkits = Nurse's

ay finally something different than myers, ghostface or legion lol.
---
Aw shit, ive been doing it wrong.I do think that BT gives you enough chance for a life. Maybe ill start protecting if they dont have DS
---
That reflects nothing on billy though, thats like saying "ban cars from the roads of all countries because a person got hit by a car earlier" deslits that one person stepping out in front of the car on a freeway.
---
They got sawed because theyre bad, not because youre billy.
---
I love running it on nurse, I dont think it's a good perk but it's far from trash in my opinion
---
And my axe!
---
wtf just happened...
---
Crow me, crow my! That's unlucky!
---
Can really go either way, her movement speed is a joke and czn be looked 4 times per loops ez pz.
---
But when the traps are popping shes insane, sometimes it just go to be  like the way when it good, and sometimes bad.
---
Really? You really think those are counters? You can do/use everything you said and still get hit.
---
A good spirit with stridor, good add-ons and good headphones (specially if you're already injured), yeah, good luck.
---
dude this is awesome!
---
I say buy the outfits you want. P3 might make you blend in more but if you just wanna have fun dress how you want

If you want funny posts sort the sub by the meme flair or whatever. This is a discussion forum at it's core, not just "look i did funny".

Orbital Laser straight to the eyes!

Even in KYF?

If you are good this is enough to survive against the spirit. If you are bad, nothing will help you
---
although if he just looked down he might have prevented the flashlight save
---
It’s been happening nonstop for me
---
Honestly basically this. I had a discussion with some friends recently about people who find Legion "unfun" because "they force me to hold Mouse 1!"
---
You know who else forces you to hold Mouse 1?
---
* Doctor
---
* Pig
---
* Trapper
---
* Plague
---
* Demogorgon
---
* Freddy
---
* *Literally fucking generators, your core fucking objective as Survivor.*
---
Half the game as Survivor is holding down Mouse 1; I don't understand how Legion's bad because they make you hold down Mouse 1 a little more. Yes the mechanic isn't fun, but you aren't supposed to be rewarded for being hit as Survivor. (Important thing to note for anyone who complains about Self Care taking too long.) Legion's literal entire power is based on punishing people who they can hit in close proximity, and considering how piss poor they are otherwise I'll take an extra 3 seconds of "healing but not really."
---
Potentially, if that's a question. As far as I've heard, because of dedicated servers theyre trying to monitor if anyone is still doing the glitch.
---
Didn't know about the shards thing, will keep my eyes open from now on
---
Bathwater ringing any bells? No? Well, good for you.
---
Chase pressure, docs power reveals when hes occupied and where he is, as survicor3you see the shock bubble over yonder and so can tri gen and get 3 gens done in the space of one decent chase.
---
Give her the same injured animation and I'm in lmao
---
But then what’s the point of ranks.
---
Thank god i'm not the only one!
---
Can someone do this meme but with Bubba the true Basement king
---
*Peeks in Ghost Face*
---
No, using perks is alright, but they are supposed to help you, not carrying you for all the match
---
Her shards glows??? I never knew
---
We don’t need that cross over. No one knows them really.
---
Was good, but ppl abused the bleed out bug. Instead of fixing that one bug, BHVR nuked Legion, and now its shit.
---
If you can’t use the perks to counter killers....what’s even the point? Having headphones doesn’t exclusively help against the spirit either
---
I was joking about headphones. 
---
Iron will is not the only way of counterplaying spirit. I listed another ways to outplay her, but you seem to prefer staying in 1 loop till you get hit.
---
I do enjoy a large killer
---
That's just it. They can say what ever about their games and once you buy it and play it you find out it was all a big lie. I still believe that what the anthem devs did should be considered a scam
---
the funny thing is people don't realize that swf groups are rarely people with tons of hours. when I play swf my group is yellow rank and I'm purple. we never bully the killer, hold the game hostage by hiding or act toxic (teabag, etc.) we just want to play the game together. the killer gets a 3-4k against our group over 50% of the time too, so it just makes me giggle when a killer dodges our lobby. especially when we don't have toolboxes or flashlights.
---
Yes, slightly, but you will notice that if she tries to mindfuck you in a loop
---
I love Heartless Doctor.
---
Oh please no....
---
**Players:** "We want more pink offerings!"  
---
**Devs:** "How about we just split up your stacks?"
---
**Players:** How about: "No..."
---
God I wish they didn’t have that 18+ rule so Finn Wolfhard could voice young Richie and say “Look at this motherfucker! He’s leaking hamburger helper!” When he heals a teammate
---
for me this goes to those two assholes in my last Freddy game the first DCed when I found her first about a minute into the match and then the second right after
---
however I played nice with the two who stayed and we farmed and had a little fun
---
That’s quite obvious you’re rank 7.
---
I don’t get why everyone hates legion, in my opinion, he is a very fun killer to play and to play against, I like the way he is right now, even if he is weak, if they rework him is prob just gunna make it worse
---
You haven't even tried) 
---
How many spirits running stridor have you seen? Most of them run default bbq&amp;ruin&amp;spiritfury combo/Slowdown combo/Totem combo. Stridor is rarely used because survivors rarely run Iron will. 
---
Stridor also makes locating survivors difficult, as you hear them much louder and can incorrectly estimate distance.
---
28 STAB WOUNDS
---
NOOOOOO BABY DWIGHT HOW COULD YOU?
---
You shouldn't have to play with a perk to counter a single killer. I don't want to start playing full meta just because one killer doesn't have counterplays if I don't have this perk. And even if you do she can run Stridor and you're fuck either way.  
---
Decent Spirits aren't fun to play against, it's a single player mode, no skill involved in the survivor's part.
---
I know, people here prefer to cry instead of trying.
---
I agree, if you are a red rank "whatever", you know a lot of info. that will help with any killer, just not enough to compete in red ranks. Anyway you would rank up pretty fast, it wouldn't be a "big deal" imo. 
---
You would get from 20 to 10 pretty fast, but perhaps if you are rank 1 with anyone, the rest of your killers could start at least at rank 15.
---
How tall are you?
---
Deerstalker: am I a joke to you?
---
Doctor main rise up !
---
Is Julie’s mask the one with the X mouth?
---
Always break distance is what evrybody does but if she is phashing she will catch up with walking she can see the grass move if your walking on grass or she will hear you.
---
And seeing her phase is really dificult it becomes more easy the longer she phases but its usually already to late and not evryone has amazing eye sight.
---
This happens anyway each month with rank reset. Red rank killers piss on casual survivors while ranking up.
---
My point would be to get rid of the reset, once you know how to play a killer, you face more experimented survivors.
---
Demogorgan as Yoshi (I think), instead of those cute noises it’s growling and demonic screeching
---
dailies for mories give you 60k
---
Bill’s canonically dead tho, and Adam/Jane certainly should’ve been dead unless the Entity snatched them 1 millisecond before they died.
---
I figured it out lol, i feel really stupid now
---
We know  :)
---
He's actually got problems that keep him from working normally, so if anything they should fix ghosting
---
Dude one of my first ever games on survivor we had a Plague do this. She was AFK in the corner so a bunch of people were T bagging and taunting her. The fucking second the last gen popped she started moving. 
---
She single handedly wrecked my rank 18 ass with Noed. My Jimmies were thoroughly rustled.
---
I do just want to say. I feel like OP knows this is a meme but like some people really give the devs no credit. There are a ton of balance changes coming out and this stuff takes time. Some people in this community really try to crucify the devs like nothing has happened.
---
Not really. At high ranks you rarely hit chainsaws. At that point he's an m1 killer.
---
Oh bitch please these are all of them, what about the nurse? Legion became garbage? And all the other fucking perk killer got nerfed? Stfu and piss off. Most killers now are borderline garbage and toys for suvivors!! OH you no you can't heal yourself anymore, it not like there are 3 other in the match that can and if all of you have adrenaline, literally any exhausted perk, ds and unbreakable, borrow time, prove thyself? Pathetic. 
---
Ds wasn't nerfed only reworked, that you cling to think it was a nerf shows how mindless you are.
---
I see mostly leather face
---
I got this achievement with a dumb hex build I run with devour hope. It was actually a really good match
---
There was this poor feng who was hiding around a corner or otherwise witnessed me eat all 3 of her friends before she fell
---
Translating captain obvious to English:
---
&gt;Wow is that a meme about cosmetics and visual updates being added before bug fixes? Don't you know they're different teams? The people who make cosmetics don't also fix bugs LOL
---
Every time someone makes a meme about unnecessary visual updates or new cosmetics being added there's always this guy in the comments. People don't seem to realize the unique concept that *it's a joke.*
---
Or the fact that it's still the job of upper management to choose where resources are prioritized, but that's another discussion entirely.

---
Steam, Thraxster, i'm game for anything. I'd like to do some archive work but serious play or just screwing around is fine fun.

Oh yeah! I need this!

yeah you get to see it as often as you like once you beat all the level 1 challenges

---
Playing against Legion in a nutshell.
---
I’m guessing it’s super common bc I had this happened to me to lol
---
Did you guys miss the part where they delayed the patch to fix bugs and balance the game?
---
I can consistently do this as Laurie and not get caught, my loud bright ass being lowkey
---
No offense but I have to ask. Are you actually so tiny or is it just the camera angle?
---
Generalist perks that work in most of the situations will always get used more.There's no changing that.Devs make good perks but add dumbass requirements for them and that makes these perks bad.
---
Like fixated doesn't make you move faster when injured,why?Or second wind needing to do 16 seconds of healing instead of healing someone for 1 health state,if someone helps you during the heal you need someone else to heal too,or the perk doesn't work.Same with corrupt intervention,sure it blocks 3 gens completely but survivors can just run for a while and find another one 20 seconds later,with no skillcheck penalties while ruin instantly has a map wide effect and requires way more time to get found and cleansed than running for awhile AND requires hitting great skillchecks.
---
TLDR: Devs add stupid requirements for new perks and that makes them inferior to ye olde perks
---
Do gens, run perks like borrowed time so you can do saves with a campy killer. Even if you don't survive going out of your way to do hook saves and such will net you plenty of points to pip
---
No it's the same as Frank's but it has blood on it, the one with the X is a cosmetic you can buy
---
I'm a bit out of the loop, what happened to instaheals?
---
I think this one is my favorite
---
I love this
---
I believe his family just calls him Leatherface, yes, but I think that Bubba is somehow mentioned in that movie. As far as I'm aware, although it wasn't said in the movie, his name was Bubba "Junior" Sawyer. Could totally be wrong though.
---
First of all. Wow, you have issues. Take it down a level. My comment was pretty chill, I acknowledged that there's a lot of killer nerfs. Maybe you should take a break and learn how to be a decent person. They put Freddy in a great spot. The nurse change had to happen, and they literally already confirmed that they are looking at Doc, Legion, and Leatherface. I want killer buffs too my man, just acknowledge that they aren't doing nothing. 
---
Oh and don't throw a tantrum from a chill comment my dude.
---
It’s always Leatherfaces for me. I honestly think it’s hilarious when they camp me so I don’t even get mad at them
---
Actually, huntress can be even better in borrowed time scenarios because she can get consecutive hits and shut down window escapes.
---
Bless you. 
---
Not too many people out there who will stay for a save after the gates are open.
---
::Blasting ‘I Need  Hero’ While Watching::
---
Half of the Spirits I go up against run Stridor because at least half the Survivors I play with run Iron Will. I want to know what games you get into where Survivors are “rarely” using Iron Will considering it’s meta and Spirits of all Killers are using SF/Enduring when that is one of the worst perks combos on her.
---
Wait you’re saying that I actually have to *try*? Shut up you entitled killer main, you’re what’s wrong with this game /s
---
HAH,
---
YOU HAVE ACHIEVED COMEDY
---
DBD is not about rushing ranks or find "decent" killer at higer rank. If the killer camps he looses points directly by reducing hook number on that surv also being near hooked surv reduces points. 
---
Your job as survivor is escape, but if you want to tank up you have to repair, unhook surv and heal them, escape from killer. All of that makes you rank up at least to rank 8 even if you dir every game making the rest of your job properly.
---
If you are not climbing you have to improve and learn what actually contribuite to ranking, you can check it at the end of the game (4 medals for different stuff, just mouseover each)
---
Aaaand don't rush ranks cause killers are not "nice"  there, they know what to do and don't gonna camp but they gonna beat the sh*t out of you.
---
I love that this is a challange. I was in a survivor game last night and just saw from a distance a plauge running around swipping at the crows. every once in a while in the distance I'd hear "IYEEA" with a sound of crows mixed in.
---
I'm putting points in bill atm for bt can you pip by playing sort of immersed
---
“Mom. Mom! Look!”
---
“What am I looking at?”
---
“It’s Legion!”
---
What did this guy say
---
I'm at rank 6 so I'm definitely jealous of your queue times haha
---
Have you never heard of an anti-gay preacher getting caught with a male prostitute or something? Yes gay people can be homophobic just like people can be racist against their own race.
---
Iron will can be countered by stridor
---
I think he was saying that Scooby wouldn’t be the killer, if I recall correctly. Lol.
---
You can try him if you get a black splinter offering in a killer bloodweb. From playing him like this my self my experience is he is one of the most fun licensed killers. I think he is mid to higher tier and his perks are decent but not meta level (all obsession based).
---
Yes, it is.
---
Bubbas are true bros at red ranks. I always wait for the meme to happen and it never does
---
Cause sometimes people just want to be assholes
---
Hello, 911? Yes, I'd like to report a murder.
---
*Wheeze*
---
I’m so confused why is that even an offering I just looked it up lol. Thanks for the advice I’ll probably buy him then I have a $20 E-shop gift card just sitting around and have had nothing to buy with it
---
I don't know.  Ibhate when I stun a killer with a pallet only to teleport beside the killer, or when the killer is stunned and still melees me through the stun.
---
When I'm playung killer on the other hand, it's clearly working as intended 😝
---
Kinda.  I mean, he's basically just another M1 killer with a gimmick, and you're going to get looped and pallet stunned and flashlighted and teabagged just like anyone else, but on rare occasions when you do everything right and the stars align, getting your stalks and chasing them down can be rather satisfying.
---
Wait, does different characters take different amount of queue times?
---
Let me rephrase what you are saying: Spirit cannot be palletlooped and thus she is unfun to go against. 
---
As I said earlier, Iron will is not the only way of countering her. If you learn to counter her, you will have more chances. 
---
Simple algorithm:
---
1) See spirit standing still
---
2) Immediately **walk** away in a random direction, even in hears, if you are sure there is a window/pallet nearby that can save you ass.
---
3) If that worked once, you do not try that twice, do some other thing, before doing that juke again. 
---
4) Here are some other things you can try:
---
* Walking to the nearest corner and crouching there, most spirits do not expect this
---
* Walk in a grass and instantly go in the other direction. This is risky and you can get hit, but if you succeed, she will miss a hit and you will win some time
---
* Run to the pallet and drop it. Not a surefire way, but you have a strong chance to stun her.
---
* Run in some random direction for a second and walk in another. Spirit is very likely to follow your tracks.
---
Do not forget that being unpredictable means you do not do 1-2 tricks, until spirit gets used to that. 
---
Do not forget this is not a 100% way of countering her. Spirit is that type of killer, whose personal skill matter more than survivor's skill, so eventually she is going to predict what are doing and hit you.
---
Camera angle, lol. 
---
I'm 6'2
---
But when the killer disconnects you don’t get the escape with Claudette challenge... tf
---
Brag
---
6'2
---
Can't wait for the devs nerfing Spirit and Killers who play on console literally having 0 top tier killers. 
---
I think the only thing that needs to be changed is Spirit being able to bump into survivors while phase walking.
---
14 clowns. You forgot the people who DC against Spirit
---
Can I upvote something twice?
---
I’m a Nea main and I don’t run urban evasion on my build. 😂
---
**Im also not even remotely toxic.**
---
But different strokes for different folks, I guess.
---
Don't like it fuck off and leave, take your own advice proxy moron. You don't know me, I am already a decent person you false assuming scunt.  But well can't expect anything else from this community welp. The devs are incompetent in the balanced department and suvivors who benefit from it sure don't complain about it.
---
Yeah, sorry for bothering you, let me go to the nearest pallet and get stunned to compensate yours moral damage
---
Currently I’m only rank 14 and a lot of the players I go against are pretty bad so I think it’ll work out
---
Yes.  I’d prioritize Leatherface for BBQ.  Otherwise Myers and Freddy are fun and strong.
---
Thats wayyy too good.
---
We dont need to be in the world of multiple exhaustion perks in a chase again
---
I just wanna get to green ranks at least so the survivors at least know how to time a 🔦 save
---
Alot of people in this community genuinely get angry when a new outfit drops but a bug isnt fixed. Not all those garbage posts are "jokes".
---
That's the opposite of tiny though.
---
Yeah I play on switch so no Leatherface or Freddy ;(
---
Yeah sometimes farming and messing around can be really fun, the best way to have this happen is when the game starts find a survivor on a gen and start hitting the gen most ppl know what you mean and you can farm.
---
Stop crying for 5 minutes typical main survivor
---
How is the left side being held up?
---
Give that lady some shoes, for Jane Romero's butt's sake
---
Yeah, sometimes shit like this happens, everyone gets good BP and everything is nice. That's DbD in a nutshell I'd say.
---
This is on the devs’ roadmap
---
Play as killer to know how to think as a killer when you play survivor. You start at level one and you have to get a character up to level 15 to have all four perk slots. Once you get there, it’ll be a little easier and a little more fun.
---
I was hoping for dr reid from vampyr lol.  Although I suppose he would be a killer due to being a vampire and all.
---
Ok
---
Huntress could also use touch ups true
---
“You could crack a walnut in my ass!”
---
- Selina Meyer, *Veep*
---
Wraith is also called Banshee
---
Michael is The Stalker/Boogeyman
---
Hag is the Witch
---
Doctor is Mu Yi
---
Huntress is the Bear
---
Freddy is the Sandman
---
Clown is the Medicine Man
---
Demo is the Monster/Beast
---
Yeah the archives are awful. 
---
IIRC devs said they didn't want to implement any secondary objectives during this year's withering blight event like the serum collecting one so the playerbase won't be split and so it won't affect the gameplay in a bad way BUT it was only for the duration of the event... 
---
But they did exactly that with these stupid archives. 
---
Now instead of playing the game normally every player will try to do their own challenge. 
---
"Screw normal gameplay, I have to kick this gen 20 times in a single match!", "screw normal gameplay, I have to run around and disturb 50 crows in a single match!", "screw normal gameplay, I have to cleanse all 5 totems and loot 5 chests on my own in a single match!" 
---
And then imagine two or more different people are trying to do the same objective and getting in each other's way and then blaming each other in post-game chat. Toxicity will skyrocket! 
---
Withering blight at least was a timed event and then it's back to normal. 
---
Archives are here FOREVER. 
---
This update will ruin the whole game in the long run, mark my words.
---
The only thing that makes spirit OP is having no counter to prayer beads. Passive phasing is super strong but it's meant to be. Just re work prayer beads to do something else and shes fine.
---
Something like that, yeah. But people still would cry, because they can't run and circles and call that skill
---
I don’t really know if this would work or not, but I don’t think that example is very good. For most killers, this is true, but a handful are too mechanically different than the standard killers for it to apply, Nurse being one of them.
---
Also the devs are already planning on instituting individual killer ranking
---
They will keep tweaking them.
---
I didn't know about the shards. She like twitches in a certain way when she's entering phase so it's always been obvious to me. (Especially because i play her frequently)
---
Omg... 💀
---
Ok, but did BHVR just run out of ideas on what to put in the pass? Because they reused the same charm **FIVE** times with just different colors. I genuinely hope that they won't do this in the next rift, because this just feels lazy.
---
We found the child.
---
Do you have the link?
---
Yeah it was nerfed hard but it is still incredibly useful.
---
Actually you kind of proved OP right by saying that. You admitted your ranking would be different
---
Precisely. It's trash if you just throw it on, but if you plan to use it and adapt how you play around it it can be good.
---
When everyone ask how is the community but no one ask whats the community
---
Hopefully we'll get a leather outfit for Myers soon so we'll settle it in the ring
---
Yeah, but they are not the most op addon for spirit.
---
Ahhh,
---
You got gamer'd
---
Actually, when you get camped, you normally also get tunneled, so it‘s worse
---
People might say get better, but honestly camping is a real problem down there.  Killers don’t know how to play yet so they camp.  Survivors don’t know how to counter that and barely do gens.
---
Get left behind and get ready to find the hatch.  In green and purple ranks I recommend playing aggressive, but down there it’s one hook dead.  It doesn’t matter if you loop the killer for “5 gens” because there will still be 5 gens left.
---
Something like left behind, premonition III/spinechill, fixated/urban evasion, borrowed time and a brown med kit.
---
Get free points doing totems/chest at the beginning.  Let someone else be the first to be found.
---
Hag is **at worst** B tier
---
The game is also ever evolving with new perks and new killers/powers.  Balance will ALWAYS be shifting and having to be tweaked. That being said, people complaining about cosmetics being added instead of bug fixes are useless comments.
---
N A M E  O F  T H I N G
---
Did you not see the /s...?
---
Prayer Beads are 100 percent the most powerful addon she has.
---
Because the range is useless and its effects are buggy and unreliable and is otherwise a standard, easily loopable killer
---
Most of that doesn’t bother decent survivors
---
aw babby's first time at rank 4. I'm currently at rank 14, haven't played in months but I've also been rank 1 many a time. 
---
See how stupid you sound when you start flexing ranks? Nobody enjoys that
---
Its pretty much a 'Try before you buy' thing, nice thing to do since most devs just charge you for a character before you can even play it
---
Right? At first I was happy with Ash, but then I saw Feng hair and was like "nope, this is perfection in art."
---
This is how I Imagine Quentin when hes talking to other survivors
---
*Laughs in Saya and one kilometre lunge attack*
---
And stridor is a shitty perk slot that has to replace 10 other different slow down the game perks.
---
I don’t care whether she is op or not she’s just annoying af with her WAHHH 
---
Like shutup girl 😂
---
Free girlfriend perk.
---
see, I find it the opposite. at least with tunneling the killers actually doing something to progress the game and it gives extra incentive to not get caught, and possibly loop the killer more and waist more time and gain some more points. verses, just sitting on a hook looking at their stupid face waiting for me to die. wasting my time and theirs.
---
Yes, but you need to use fast stalk add-ons. Otherwise your T3 is gonna take forever to get. When you have those you'll be able get T3 over and over. One T3 proc can end a game if used wisely. Slugging with T3 is really effective too. 
---
Using M&amp;A on him is also really good since your terror radius will be so small, if they don't have line of sight it's usually a free hit.
---
I played yesterday and about 8/10 killers brought a mori :( or pink addons :(
---
Ruin is necessary to counter gen rush you dumbass.
---
I really feel you my man. Gotta take the good with the bad in this community, but I kind of love it. 
---
Good luck out there in the fog.
---
I play rank 1 Legion. I will not say it's ez, but you can sure do it with training.
---
I got an idea too. Make it to where you automatically get 32k points. Has to be fair right? Would reduce the grind.
---
No there is no cross platform to prevent unfair advantages
---
Pantry also has a crow bomb
---
You look like the Deer Knight spell in Wizard101
---
Traps can be placed very quickly during loops but She is slow and playing her it feels even slower.
---
How many hours?
---
Spinechill is also a good choice, breaks stealth killers too so I just tend to ALWAYS run it
---
Same!
---
When you go into the archives you can see a man sitting with his back to the screen, you see his upper head which looks a lot like the guy I posted a picture of.
---
At this point every killer the doesn’t spare the last survivor is a clown.
---
There's some decent ones on the pass it's like anything though it's your first taste is free content with the option to get additional cosmetics if your willing to spend the 1000 auric cells at least you can earn back the cells if your hardcore into the game.
---
Lol your saying to listen to her footsteps?
---
Yeah sorry cant really hear that mid chase with the GAY ASS CHASE MUSIC
---
You too, go farm those BP fam.
---
I love this with a passion that I probably shouldn’t
---
"Face the wall, and place your survivor on your head"
---
Yeah, I'm almost done with all the survivor challenges but haven't done a single killer one because I give up after 15 minutes of looking for lobbies :/
---
Myers is the most balanced killer in the game.
---
He can be INCREDIBLY strong, or he can be just ok. All depends on the perks and add-ons you use with him and your own player skill.
---
No I mean we are both PC Gamers. He has the xBox Game Pass for PC and can play it on PC\^\^
---
What if she uses that new skin that is basically neon orange
---
It's also common of this community to downvote randomly apparently
---
I don't think the stranger things dlc is worth it, buy it now
---
nice to see a post not related to toxicity
---
Anyone can have any perks equipped and still be a potato
---
I have to wait at least 15 minutes to find one and then I get gen rushed and it takes longer to find a game than play one :(
---
Why the downvotes? Lol
---
I have ASCENDED
---
how is the edition 40 when the dlc is 12. shouldnt it be 30? i suggest to buy the game and then get the dlc if you like this game.
---
Nice to talk to people who aren't toxic once in a while too.
---
Is there a certain playstyle you want as a killer? I can help you choose one if there is a certain playstyle you want.
---
I would buy the cheaper one now and see how you like it cause this game has a huge learning curve and grind in my opinion and some people dont have the commitment and time to do it.
---
TBH I don´t think the Stranger Things chapter is worth it without discount. Sure, Demo is quite fun, but overall the perks are not great and IMO you can buy 2 chapters for the same price as ST, that is worth more. 
---
Wait for the Black Friday sale, DLCs should be on sale again and then you can shop away. Who knows, maybe we will even see a slight discount on Stranger Things when the new chapter is announced.
---
Example: me :DDD
---
I work 40 hours a week. Health care admin.
---
Yes, very slooowwly. But they are. :)
---
But he’s not unfair in any way
---
What rectum are you pulling these from?
---
*Never* cross the streams...
---
Yep I’m the child not the people screaming and crying over every little thing about the rift.
---
This would suck the fun out of the game. It would be plain stupid if you worked so hard to unlock a perk, just to not be able to use it.
---
I'm usually the one getting chased tho I'm not great at it I can last maybe 20 25 seconds if I have a 🔦 I'm gonna start doing gens I think and totems
---
Hag is the 4th best killer
---
Perkless Nurse, Hillbilly and Spirit slaughters newbie potatoes, more news at 11.
---
Blessed
---
😂😂
---
You forgot to add "Spine chill".
---
I'm new to the game, what happens with you jump through that window?
---
Ask your friend with that skin to test that in KYF. I'm pretty sure her glass shards still glow
---
I got a few different ideas. Kinda combining the posts so far.
---
In terms of raw power: spirit and nurse. 
---
In terms of synergy, plague and huntress
---
In terms of stalling: doctor and legion
---
In terms of scare: myers and ghostface
---
In terms of meme builds: legion and plague(cleanse to heal mend); trapper and pig(team ITS A TRAP); bubba and billy(saw siblings); wraith and hag(no flashlights plz); clown and freddy(30% slowdown); demo and hag(teleports behind you)
---
Any more I missed?
---
PC have a sensitivity advantage when playing Nurse and their fps doesn't drop when they blink
---
Yeah they should give Michael some buffs to make him more threatening in Tier 3
---
What are the best add-ons?
---
Not to mention just how loud survivor footsteps actually are, peeps be having tap shoes on. Even with the survivor doing everything they can to mask themselves from her you can’t stop those and they’re one of the most consistently loud things about survivors. It’s why Scott’s pro spirit guide is just buying a pair of headphones on amazon. 
---
Not saying I want her bottom tier- I actually think she’s got a cool design. But I definitely agree it’s lame asking everyone to wear a particular perk to not make games against x killer snoozefests (even with that perk they still are in her case). It’s restrictive to fun perk builds then you get people complaining about survivors wearing the same handful of 8 perks.
---
Not impossible if you slug and open the exit gate yourself before putting them on hooks. Especially if you use a Mori and Remember me to slow down exit gate opening by survivors until you have all your slugs...
---
Oh who am I kidding. This is going to be a nightmare.
---
The hitbox favours a lot killers, at least with dedicated servers. I get hit when i'm mid falling through a second floor window or when i already passed it completely. It feels rigged (imo).
---
As someone who unlocked all Survivor teachables before choosing and leveling my Survivor main, I have to say it was a big headache waiting to get what I actually wanted, especially since I am a perfectionist and wanted that P3 as well lol. The grind is easier now of course but it took me so long and so much grinding before the web changes. 
---
However, with my killers, I went the other route and unlocked teachables 2-3 at a time before leveling my main, and rinsing and repeating. I got the build I wanted much quicker, and then casually unlocked all the killer perks at my leisure. I suffered much less RNG frustration. 
---
It’s entirely up to you and honestly, with the new web changes, it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be if you want to just unlock and then level. Only the RNG gods know if you will get your favorite perks quick or not, but it can be nice to unlock/level/repeat as I did with killers in order to have the most control over what you get.
---
Spireh, ded’ard.
---
It says you are rewarded 1000 when going in to purchase it. I'm waiting to see how far I make it before buying it.
---
If this is true it probably wont even matter, I can see them nerfing spirits base kit just like they did to nurse.
---
You don't keep anything if you DC.
---
I love your ghostface outfit!
---
Leave my fucking Legion alone.
---
I literally meant to put aren't.  Lol, I imagine those upvotes instantly go to -27 LUL
---
Trapper would also be vastly improved if he could carry two traps without needing an add-on.
---
You see I have Xbox but I just never seem to find these people
---
Oh I didn’t but I was having a good time no one was toxic or anything then I can’t across a hen rushing tea bagging swf and lost the will to play. Granted I wasn’t playing the greatest killer but I was just trying to have fun.
---
I guess that's just me being optimistic. Still, 4 minutes is extra time given to your team. also i would feel bad just giving up without at least giving them some time. unless they farm me, then I'm done. and don't get me started on dc's that just ruins the game for everyone.
---
I started off at tier 11 and it’s been the school holidays so me and my friends have just been playing DBD. I haven’t slept in 2 days.
---
HELL to the YEAH
---
Base trapper could definitely need improving but the only issue I really have with one trap trapper is that I can't reset traps, two traps can also work for him however, its a small buff I don't think he needs a rework of any kind.
---
it gets even more credible when I tell you that that's actually a pucture book and she's drinking vodka from a cup
---
Yeah I unterstand why PC gamers have advantage, but we are both PC gamers and just want to play with each other on different launchers :D (Steam and xBox Beta App for PC)
---
It would be hard to balance an asymmetric game. But the first thing I would do is remove noed and adrenaline beside it.
---
This is doable. NOED, Bloodwarden, Slug builds with Deerstalker etc. Will probably take a few games but quite doable. 
---
Worse one is the survivor challenge which required 3 unhooks during endgame collapse in a single game.
---
Battery and Grip
---
First match today, I got hooked inside a jungle gym. Bill unhooks me right in front of the killer. I figured he had borrowed. He runs to the outside, I run the other way. I start to loop at the jungle gym because that gen is done. Bill is on the other side of the pallet and throws it down in front of me. I get hit, he doesn’t have borrowed. I ended up getting saved and I survived. 
---
End game chat he say he had to throw it down because the killer was coming. He didn’t have borrowed because he swapped it for self care.
---
Since your playing on console and get doc for free, I’d recommend you try to get monitor and abuse on hag. It’s so good on her
---
That’s why I recommend playing stealth.  Do totems at the beginning when the killer is checking gens for his first chase.  Get your safe saves.  Do gens.  
---
That’s if you want to rank up.  I made it to rank 1 like that when I was terrible at running the killer.  I didn’t use urban though.  I became one with the bushes.
---
Imo they should just add a speed boost when moving towards someone hooked.
---
When they get find first 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
It gives back all 1000 if you complete it.
---
I meant in console players and PC players playing together if you're both running the game on the PC there shouldn't be a difference. I don't think the launcher matters but I don't have the PC version so I don't know for sure
---
Even after the nerf?
---
I'm actually looking at the fact two of us died by Mori...with the killer having no perks and offerings
---
Yeah the third and fourth tips are stupid but i have to agree with the others
---
That's a good way to make sure you get it all back.
---
Lol
---
It's one of those perks that is pretty much universal and works with almost every killer
---
You're right, already wondered if I should address this. I don't know what to think about legion. I like the design, the trailer was cool, if misleading, but its just a teenager with a knife. Nothing special or interesting about this. But the mori is great. I think the legion stabs exactly like their first murder where every one of the 4 stabbed once. This gives the impression that the 4 might share the body
---
Sorry but that’s just a bad idea coming from a r1 with all killers p3lvl50. Some killers are skilless and will result in me steamrolling rank 20s. The queues would be unbearable and people would only queue as survivor for easy to beat killers. It would result in a broken game. Sorry dude
---
Billy is fine where he is
---
*stands up and claps*
---
Sad it'll be drowned out by people with bad teammates, and lazy looping and typical tactics VS Lower Tier Killers. Prayer Beads is the only thing in practice that's BS, I LOVE the idea of it...but it is a bit too strong...but of course Spirit Basekit will get smacked around by BHVR because so many complain about her...even had someone comlain about Plague on the forums....eventually every Killer is gonna get smacked around...
---
No the game punishes killers for camping and survivors for being stealthy.  The game is designed to force you to do objectives, get chased by the killer and unhook teammates.  Hiding all game will make you de pip even if you did a lot of gens
---
On all platforms they're hard to find it seems. But that just makes it sweeter when you do find em
---
In my dreams..
---
Provided the next pass is 1000 auric cells too should be able to continue onto the next one and so on so would end up being several cosmetics for the price of one regular one
---
He's using a killer chainsaw instead of his own probably.
---
*So anyways I started blasting*
---
Damn, then feng mins are out here just dc’ing
---
and lightweight and quick and quiet
---
Who plays this game without headphones?  Sound is the biggest aspect to this game...you're only asking for trouble to play this game without some sort of headphone ....
---
Ascended, I have
---
Fixated
---
Wounded Healer trophy is still unobtainable, has been since May.
---
I think its 1st = nurse, 2nd = spirit, 3rd = billy, 4th = freddy,  but alright you think hag is better than billy or freddy.
---
TBH though i think GF is #1, ghost face is life, lots of mechanics to work with and super fun
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Billy
---
3. Spirit 
---
4. Hag
---
5. Freddy
---
So he's rapping about his name?
---
dude i brought a mori for the 4k and as soon as they see me kill 1 they all disconnected, if it isn't my lucky day.
---
Fuckin toxic blendettes /s
---
but even the devs said they gave us pantless meyers since they couldnt do shirtless. they also thirst 👀💦
---
Lmao
---
This lady has a very punchable face I tell ya!
---
Meme is alright tho
---
People who cant afford headphones
---
thats more like deathgarden killer
---
Yes let me turn up my headphones so my ears are bleeding just so i can hear some quiet footsteps.
---
As a legion main I can confirm
---
This has been posted so many times already, dang
---
YESS, MY MAN
---
It's happened to literally everyone. Any moment u/DocteuR will paste all the other posts about it
---
*Cries in solo que*
---
Did this man just say the grip is one of the best add-ons?
---
Is the pipe a bug?
---
Ah it is the actor Peter Stormare who has been doing a lot of roles since the early 90's 
---
He has a bit of an accent on him which forgive me but ai forget from where.
---
He was in Until Dawn as a creepy doctor/psychiatrist and the setting was very much like the archives.
---
In that picture he is acting as "The Replacer" in the Call of Duty Black Ops series, a man who will fill in for any job.
---
He always pops up in the most random places for roles, wonder if he is going to be in DBD as well.
---
This is why you bring lightborn. I immediately equip it if i see more than 1 flashlight, otherwise it's just asking for a lazer eye surgery.
---
Edit: Better analogy
---
can you please delete this photo it’s not yours to post the owner of this picture was a private account and didn’t want it posted. natalia is a very private person and may feel very uncomfortable that you’re spreading this picture when she posed in this for her friend, not for you and your dbd friends. so please delete this photo
---
This is me but with prayer beads spirit
---
G r O o V y
---
I thought u were the hunter from Deathgarden with all those tangles
---
I want to say “How do people never see Claudette?” But I’ve had games as killer where I barely could find 2 people.
---
Wait no, 
---
Freddy Fazbear
---
If its so shitty then why do 50% of spirits I face run it? I'm not calling her op, she isn't other than with prayer beads. I'm just stating that stridor counters iron will.
---
It makes me wanna play Friday the 13th.
---
All outfits are 1,080 Auric Cells or 21,600 Iridescent Shards.
---
Platform PS4
---
I am having problems with not getting the Blood points for the halloween event. I will burn the offering and get nothing. And finding a game is painful right now
---
Dude, why the fuck does it take soooo long to make a match?
---
(curently waiting 34min for match a survivor)
---
Hey hey now! The spirit is taking up all the rework action!No need to attack the edge Boi's(and girls)
---
kill survivors i presume
---
edit: i was just kidding, I've got no clue what to do for a potential power lol
---
Shore. The only Paulie that truly matters
---
Doctor and legion: deep wound+madness 3 would be disgusting, you can't mend while mad !
---
Ahh yes, a steaming hot cup of vodka
---
Last night the face camping and tunneling was strong with the hookers
---
She is OP. End off
---
I work an average 44 hours a week because i often can’t take my breaks and work on holidays. Nurse.
---
Strength in player skill and strength in no information on moving around as nurse 2.0 is not the same thing. Prayer beads may not be the strongest in all scenarios, but it sure is annoying as all fuck
---
Well, you're one of them. You tell us what happened.
---
no no... that's just fumes of a lemon dissolving in the Vodka because it's so strong
---
Yeah like different coloured arcade cabinet charms would be cute but really the leaf?
---
Equipping Stridor is better so you can hear around you while blinded and even before. Infectious Fright is also an easy counter. Or just looking at a tree, baiting the pickup. I love SwFs that always have to go for flashlight saves, my Infectious Fright Billy w insta saw (I use goose addons versus SwFs only) or IF Plague loves it. People cry about it being toxic, no, it benefits you because then they’re just chasing you not getting any work done in return for a hook
---
Claudette and the terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad Spirit.
---
I don't personally care about prayer beads since I don't play spirit. But if your solution to mori offerings is to make them two hook only like I keep seeing in the whine posts then just delete the fucking things. The whole point of a mori is a power spike that ends the game quickly. If you have to hook someone twice then they're pointless. Remove ebony mori's if you must but adding a second hook requirement is completely stupid.
---
And yes I play both sides. I've been tunneled, I've been camped, I've been mori'd. It's a game. This community needs to learn how to lose gracefully without screeching all the fucking time.
---
Idk. With the amount of lumens this man is receiving I'm pretty sure he could close his eyes and still get blinded through his eyelids.
---
🤣
---
when they get **FOUND**\*\*\*  
---
Cease boomer  
---
Well my comment was just what I’d assume them to do, but Stanley is part of the losers club so I don’t see why he wouldn’t be a part of it.
---
I've seen a number of games where the survivors were 4-5 ranks higher than the killer. Also had a weird lobby where the lowest survivor was 13 and highest was 4.
---
Also, I hit rank 10 for the first time recently and my queues have been much slower, they were near instant prior. Anyone else have that problem?
---
Yikes. You're comparing killing one Survivor to instantly getting all four Survivors out before gens are finished, instantly escaping the Killer's grasp, stunning the killer repeatedly, instantly healing, sprinting so fast the Killer can't even tell you were there, etc etc
---
Really, we shouldn't rely on anything. That was my point. Neither side should have to have specific items to fill a meta, just perks (which aren't single use), but the best we can do is get rid of the worst offenders and get the Mori vs Key debate to end
---
Longleg myers tho👀💦
---
yes i press enter to fast
---
Someone dced from the loading screen and I didn't get a match but it counted for the challenge somehow.
---
I've been feeling the same way. I like that they've added something to spice up gameplay and to flesh out the lore, but they've seriously messed it up imo. I'd never be running plunderer's, empathy or this is not happening if it weren't for Archives, but now i kinda have to put myself at a disadvantage to complete them. Like a lot of this they really need to rework the challenges so players are actually still playing the game
---
Congratulations, you’re an asshole!
---
I’m struggling to get any lobbies at all on either side.
---
No wait time for either lucky me
---
Nope. Only survivors are allowed to have fun. Didn't you know?
---
I'm disappointed in the lack of nea cosmetics also gf cosmetics
---
1k for the gen being finished. 3k if it’s finished and you put an offering up.
---
As it should be. It’s supposed to last 70 days.
---
Oh shit wheres my award
---
Loved that they made all outfits available for shards
---
this is a consent issue. natalia did not want that picture posted. the reddit account who posted this photo first deleted it, and paulie deleted it. so right now this is the main source. and it’s not fair to natalia to keep this up.
---
Nearing 25min wait time at Rank 9 fun :]
---
That’s my question too
---
Im not sure with the rankings anyway, just surprised for someone to say billy is better than spirit. Although i guess the argument is that you can do something against a good billy, but you cant do anything against a good spirit even with all the said tricks in the book on how to counter spirit
---
Me too, man, but I just wish they would decrease his normal cooldown and rework the pen and shit so we can vary a bit. The outdoor camera has really grown on me, it's like a pocket BBQ
---
I wish i could send this to the survivor in my billy game a few days ago. I had billy on LERY'S no less. I some how managed to get a chainsaw on a claudette. IMMEDIATELY dc's.  Then I find a shirtless david, had to m1 him since he was running windows like crazy. Then he dc's!. at this point 4 gens are left with only 2 survivors left. That's serious bullshit for both sides. They really need to have a penalty for dcing too much.
---
Who else thinks stepping on legos doesn't hurt? (not even a little bit)
---
Spirit is more unfair but billy is better imo
---
Oh my, that's fucking awesome!
---
It's not a dedicated server joke it's a  
---
"That trap is obvious, I won't step." Then they vault and step on a trap.   
---
I explain comedy cause I'm am extremely HILARIOUS

Gonna try whole spirit nd hag

It’s so fitting for cap’n Ace to get a map- a shame his greedy plunders could not save him
---
When I play on PC, survivor queues take like 2 minutes, killer queues take 15. When I play on console (PS4), survivor queues take 15+ and killer queues are like 2-3 minutes.

Wat, this aint real

I like that Kayako is just 'The Grudge'.

Michael: "AAAAUGHH!"

Myers can’t be edgy because to be edgy you have to say annoying dark shit lol he just breathes
---
hag and jake :)
---
Thanks for clearing that up for me
---
I had to leave the last guy to bleed out as he was the last one to die and I hadn’t hooked him yet and apparently the whole teamed reported me yet it counted towards the kill count
---
Ever heard of Straisand Effect?
---
I said I like it. Oh well
---
1. Not everyone has Iron Will unlocked nor, could they predict that they would need Iron Will prior to the trial starting (because survivor's don't know which killer they are facing).
---
2. Spirits usually have good headphones and can hear footsteps especially when you are stepping on grass or indoor areas.
---
3. I assume by unpredictable you mean run unpredictably (run in circles, zig-zag, etc), but then again Spirits can hear footsteps, see scratch marks and myself personally I have found this to work until you bump into the spirit while she is phasing (which is a guaranteed hit if you bump into her).
---
4. Yes break the distance is important, but sometimes when you do that you take yourself out of a safe position. For example, you try to get some distance from the spirit as she is following your trail, but you just managed to take yourself out of the good loops and into an open area.
---
5. Yes you can hear the footsteps (assuming you can drown out the loud chase music), but this requires you to stand still for the most part and doing so will just allow the spirit to unphase and just use her giant lunge attack to get to you since you hardly move out of position when she started to phase.
---
6. Cool, her shards glow. But does this work when she is from a good distance? Does her shard glow for certain cosmetic sets? Do the shards glow in all graphics settings?
---
These are just my concerns I have when facing the spirit. Yes I disagree with people that say she has no counterplay, but you do have to agree that facing against her is not as easy as you think. I'm not sure why you said it was easy to counter spirit, but I would like to assume that the spirits your facing are the ones from rank 1. Because I am rank 1 and I face spirits daily, more than 10 if I get a good lengthy DBD session. I have been consistently getting rank 1 in every season and I have almost 2K hours in the game and I can tell you that I still have trouble facing against the spirit so it hurts me to see this post saying that Spirit is easy to play against.
---
For instance, i bought piggy and her chapter even if shes been nerfed
---
I see this too, and not just camping ghostfaces, it seems like every other game is a ghostface, am I the only one who notices this? Not complaining btw I just think he’s annoying to play against with the broken reveal and all that
---
Seems like a No One Left Behind buff to me lmao

NOLB

Borrowed Time

DS (for when you get farmed)
---
Empathy (to see teammates getting in chased and make it there ahead of time?)
---
Yeah, that is what i dont get. the amount of gap between 16 sec and insta-heal is equal to earth from the sun. 16 sec is fucking a lot in this game.

I don't play Claudette or Jake, and I already have the chest and head of Dwight's Blight outfit and the pants are really not worth it at all so I'm going all killer this year.

Though scratched mirror is really fun too
---
You can definitely pip playing immersed if you don't just hide in the corner of the map all game. I wouldn't recommend playing immersed tho because some killers despise people that hide whenever they hear a heartbeat and therefore will sometimes tunnel you
---
Distressing is good, you want to have a large TR.
---
they’re are adding the feature for crossplay accross xbox and steam launcher in the next few weeks. I saw them post about it on Twitter.
---
Dumbass killer mains won’t even farm with more than double BPS double bp why would they help us now
---
*two

We asked for shirtless Myers, we got pantless Myers
---
I know he's a merciless killer but that's honestly too cruel.
---
I had this happen to me and was pretty happy since I tend to be excessively merciful.
---
If killers can't bring No One Escapes Death then survivors can't bring Adrenaline. If killers can't bring Hex: Ruin then survivors can't bring Decisive Strike. If killers can't bring A Nurse's Calling, Barbaque &amp; Chili, and Bitter Murmur then survivors can't bring Dark Sense, Alert, and Object of Obsession. If killers can't bring slug builds then survivors can't bring sabotage builds. If killers can't bring high rarity add-ons then survivors can't bring high rarity items and add-ons. And if killers can't bring Moris then survivors can't bring their friends. If you don't think any of this is fair, then you have no room to complain about what the opposite team brings because you're just as bad.
---
We don't need no stupid rules disallowing things added in the game with the intent to be used because that'll ultimate make the game more bland. Yes the other extreme is higher amonts toxicity, but there is no certified way to keep that in check because at the end of the day, toxicity finds a way. Plus it's subjective anyhow, and usually in context of "they can't do this to me, but I can do this to them", which is a self centered ideal, everyone has their own definition of what is and isn't toxic, often based SOLELY on just what prevents them from just winning every single game of their life. Just play the game as presented to you or don't play it at all, that's the only "rule" that really matters.
---
In fact why does me mentioning someone mentioning someone get ME downvoted, this community is seriously the biggest fucking cesspool of entitled little fucking degenerates.

“Just don’t get injured” best advice.

Almost as good as “try to be unpredictable”. Like wtf

Description:  some times when I try to play survivor or killer, after being stuck for  a good while in loading screen I get this error message
---
&gt;unable  to reach the game host. Please check your network setting (NAT type).  if the problem presisits, please attempt to join a different session.
---
I have only been able to play a few times ( even as a survivor ) these past few days, 30 minutes or more only searching for matches only to get this error.
---
Dope, wasn't expecting these until Wednesday next week!
---
I dont think any perks are grossly op but if they wanted to add some they could have a point system where you get 4 points for perks, all current perks are worth 1 each and then the op perks could be worth 2 or 3 points so that way if you wanted to run the op perk you would be sacrificing a perk slot or 2. But again idt this is necessary with the current perks in the game
---
but does he boop the snoot?
---
Well, Halloween Kills and Ends are both scheduled for a 2020 and 2021 release.
---
Ah, Miguel Myers, the infamous mexican cousin of Michael Myers
---
I just want to know if its a dlc worth buying because they are all on sale
---
Looks like the wendigo
---
Your friend is Gerard Way?
---
Had a game where I had already started running away from the window and still got hit. Feelsgood man
---
That’s an actual challenge? Huge yikes
---
If he’s playing in the best way, you shouldn’t even look at him to reveal anyway.  He won’t be stalking you, only using it to chase
---
Huh!
---
I think the new Myers cosmetic is cool and unique, but is anyone else disappointed that they didn't change animations and sounds when he uses the lead pipe?
---
Currently doing the same thing. Holy shit is it a commitment. Got about 7 of them rn. Idek if it’s worth it anymore
---
It's a miner trapper skin, I'm not saying it should be in the game but it's a potential killer none the less
---
Nope .. 3 kills 1 DC .. still dont get it
---
Monday
---
definitely the whole clown he has the coolest skin imo, whole jake and probably spirits head. 
---
there are some other skins that came out recently that drawn my attention to them. like the myers and laurie skins, so that the hallowed catalyst collection kinda got boring at this point.
---
I feel bad for him
---
really? out of the 9 matches i played last night only one wasnt a farming killer.. and it annoys the hell out of me, i just wanna play normal, fun games vs people who try at least a bit. and ok during double bps everybody should chill a bit and give eachother the chance to get some extra points but thats about it
---
2 days if you hover over your blood point count in the game lobby it'll let you know
---
It be like that
---
Thank you!
---
I mean spirit has really strong perks  
---
and Adam has pebble  
---
So I'd say go for it. But imo the other licensed DLCs are all worth getting it before that one.
---
this comment is underrated
---
In my 450 hours I've never noticed this. Ive noticed Russians playing like scumbags both killer and survivor but I've never been tunnelled down for not having Russian in my name.
---
Certain people will always feel "out charactered" so I don't buy this argument. If I olay Nurse? "Its your blinks, you're not outplaying me. Blink OP." Ignoring the time I put into the character, ignoring the fact that I predicted their moves. It's my character. And this is post rework. People are still bitching.
---
 If I play Huntress? Same shit. "Hatchets OP". Not even using iridescents. 
---
Ghostface? "Stealth OP". So I'm gonna have to ask you to miss me with this excuse. Reddit survivors won't be happy until they get easy games but can pretend they're skilled. Just like reddit killer mains. This subreddit is a joke.
---
I know we both watched that same Otz video...
---
To be honest, I just bought the battle pass for the Jake cosmetic set and Blight Nurse set. I would say both those sets would net me $15-$20 in the cosmetic store so I got my value there. The rest I just see as extra stuff so I don't feel as cheated when I see the same recolor charms. In fact, I am not much of a fan of the charms because you can barely see them on your body and most of them I can't use because they clip through the character or I am running a stealth build.
---
I dont mind the FNAF franchise as a whole, I think the lore has gotten  too cluttered and confusing as of recently, other then that I think it's fine. The thing I'm worried about is the franchise, with 90% of it being very very young kids (surprisingly, FNAF has a very large toddler/ young children following. I'm not making fun of them I mean literal toddlers and small children).
---
I was hoping that IF he did get added there would be countless cosmetics to be added, they can just be called the animatronics and have freddy as base, with the too many others for cosmetics.
---
Yeah im aware of that but since i am at work i couldnt really check atm haha
---
Sounds like a trilogy then
---
I'm just saying that it looks almost exactly like the Trapper skin, so they probavly won't add it, is all.
---
Looks really great! Did you make the mask yourself?
---
spirit sword and head. Jake head. Thats all so far, dont know if im gonna get anything else.
---
I dont have problems in play againts a spirit for my is fun but billy he is a problem
---
OP's at work tho.
---
&gt;Killers who DC when the exit gates are powered
---
I don't condone this. But they're probably dreading the fact that they're going to have to endure the entire 2 minutes of endgame collapse because survivors never leave unless they get chased out, and 50% of them teabag the killer before they leave.
---
I take it the killer would rather benefit from 1. Starting the next game asap, 2. Not have to read chat, and 3. Get to depip twice to face easier survivors.
---
They were survivors before the in game generation of survivors in the game's lore. Benjamin was a reporter who actually was investigating Evan(The Trapper)'s case of mass murders.
---
Vigo was an inventor who is credited for creating the escape hatch in the realm.
---
Their stories match a lot with the observer and The alchemist introduced with archives.
---
This has been bugging me too
---
Can confirm as a David king main only at the exit
---
And I've already run into killers that have circumvented both quite easily. 
---
Insta heals were super trolly. But they tipped way too far imo. 
---
Especially in a game where killers can still mori.
---
Seriously, I can't remember the last time I got face camped lol. How long did this collage take to assemble?
---
wow thank you for the information i had no idea about any of that 😂
---
You're welcome.
---
Clown and plague full bodies.
---
Oh yeah I find that annoying, if the exit gates are open I just leave unless there is a chance I could save someone
---
Since the update you dont really need moniter and abuse since t1 myers is undetectable but i can see other perks being more useful for Myers.
---
It's a bit of a meme,  but it can allow a killer who's fallen behind to a Gen rush to catch back up and have a shot at getting an extra kill or 2. Survivors hate it since it comes in clutch and rewards bad play (but completely ignore the fact that many of their own meta perks do the same)
---
These are the type of videos I like to see.
---
I was going to make a joke but my game loaded in
---
It's really unfair when you get face camped and there's 5 gens left to do.
---
I think the hook progress should be paused when the killer stays close at 5 gens and delayed at 4 or even 3 gens left.
---
Jesus christ.
---
I know that's why I said the answer too just wasn't sure if he knew generally how to check for future reference
---
I've been playing for a week and have only had it used once against me. When I play as killer, I don't use it either since it feels pretty cheap.
---
*Spirit
---
Why is this so accurate?
---
Man I bet the thing would be broken af lol
---
[link to the forums that are about the cosmetics of the characters that show their age](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/35300/the-legion-ages)
---
It's justified critique, you know the sort of stuff you don't hear on the official forums because there fascism has completely taken hold? While the Devs are giggling like stoned apes making jokes on YouTube streams pretending it doesn't exist?
---
If you can tell me beyond reasonable doubt that you think it's okay that consoles still got issues that bump FPS back to 10-20FPS every time a Survivor 360° a killer or uses Dead Hard directly in front of them... then I'm all ears. Otherwise shush your piehole!
---
- Btw, I payed for this game, your going to tell me I can't voice concern if it runs like a Autist with Scoliosis?
---
does just putting them on the hook and sacrificing them in endgame count?
---
- Bloodweb glitch where you randomly can't click anything on the bloodweb and most of the UI is unclickable. Fixable by using the onscreen arrow keys near top right to switch characters but the glitch comes back after every unlock on the bloodweb
---
- Nurse ritual to blink and hit survivors doesn't work whatsoever.
---
I am in the same boat as you... I tried to restart PS4 and game to see if it would solve anything, but now I can't even get past the first screen, it says the servers are down
---
Everyone plays like shit sometimes. There's no way to pip to rank 1 unless you are doing well in most of your matches. The minimum pip requirements at red ranks is 12 emblem points, or in other words all gold emblems (or some silvers and iridescents totaling the same value). That means that in the majority of their games they must be doing gens and lasting more than 2 seconds in a chase.  
---
With 4 people in a match, you are likely to have a least one person who has a bad game. That's not to say that all players at red ranks are equal, but I think people tend to overestimate the number of potatoes at red ranks because of this. Sometimes you just have a shit connection, or bad luck and you run to map tiles that have already been used.
---
You can't be serious right? You don't see perks and offerings until EVERYBODY is dead or escaped. aka the game being over.
---
O yes choose one of the worst killers that nobody plays
---
And at this point I assume it always will be sadly.
---
loop his ass and play regularly? how does a killer be toxic to someone not participating? i dont think farming is bannable
---
The extra bloodpoints are from completing the objectives. You need to find the gens that have the pumpkins on them as a survivor, and as the killer, you'll need to find the hooks with the pumpkins.
---
I don’t know what that means but I’ll ask my friend!  
---
Question: Do asshats disconnect as soon as they get hooked?  I’ve been noticing a lot of that. I play a fair game. I don’t want to take people out ridiculously early. I don’t camp and if I look like I’m camping, I just don’t really know where I am. Why do they even play?  What good is disconnect?  Just die and it will be over.
---
Entirely speculation, and the devs have already flat out stated that all characters are 18+. Spirit is another great example, people often try to say she's 17ish, but her bio specifically mentions university. People are just weird and gross and keep trying to pretend these characters are kids for some reason
---
Lol yeah... It's always something with DbD. Loving this game is game as well... I sure love having Double BP and can't even play during this time...
---
I do complete the objectives though
---
Restart your game every 2 games or so, it works.
---
Some toxic people dc yeah
---
Stridor only partially counters iron will, 50% quieter pain sounds still messes with you.
---
Stridor removes Iron Will and 75% of Spirits use it to become even more sweaty, Prayer Beads, Fathers Glasses and Bloodhound, Early game advantage. Need I say more?
---
I had 6 different matches where people DC’d in ebony Mori’s that I was saving and it didn’t count, so I had to just do a slug game and let people bleed out on the floor. Do you know how painful it is to get an entire lobby of slugs in a rank 1 game? It was a 42 minute match with 2 gens done before I finally got all 4 down at the same time, then one just unbreakabled back up at a bad time or I wouldn’t have gotten it
---
would get the original game only first and complete the characters, find the playstyle that suits you the best and archive the perks for that. after getting used to everything get one by one the dlcs you like the most. if the sale is still up, maybe buy some dlcs too, they are a lot cheaper on halloween.
---
Yeah, I seem to be having problems too.
---
Thanks i hate it
---
And this, kiddo's is why you look up when dodging the flashlight beam
---
That’s the joke
---
He has perfected the injured run, love it lmao
---
You have to get all 4 in the same match
---
I was thinking T2 cause it's only 8M while not in a chase, also I use Infectious fright with M&amp;A so when I hit someone with T3 I see everyone within 40M range. Perfect for slugging. 
---
But yeah there's tons of good builds. I just think the classic spirit fury, enduring build is kinda boring ya'know. Hope you enjoy him :)
---
The devs did mention that this is coming (it was in the Year 3 Livestream, I believe).
---
This is exactly my point 💕 
---
These people want killers to play nice. My job is in the name- Killer. Not "leter-goer"
---
Indeed it is. I live in South America, so the traffic is never heavy.
---
I’m getting Joe’s
---
It cracked me up lmao you got my upvote
---
What do you mean lol? Your reply confuses me. Like she said or he said they were 6 ft 2 and that answers your question.
---
Let’s see they found me first and couldn’t catch me for 4 gens then I was camped for the for the last one and no one tried to save
---
Second, stuck at "Syncing Friends List".
---
Trap the killer shack I find that is the easiest place to catch them naughty survivors in a chase
---
This happened to me last night, I was running ghostface with rancor, Dh and a ebony and someone disconnects while loading and I get it. I was so happy
---
Ive used the infectious fright slugging with bubba works too well for me that i gave up monitor
---
Usually the higher your rank the less likely the killer is to chase the unhooked person anyway
---
New killer?
---
PC
---
- Nurse ‘blink and hit’ ritual not counting
---
- Decisive Strike indicator stays onscreen all game after being stunned by it
---
- The Prove Thyself hud icon appears greyed out when I’m alone (the one that lights up when someone running it is near, I’m not running it myself)
---
I think Imhotep from the mummy movies would be a good option. 
---
He could start the match drained and emaciated and draw life essence from survivors when hitting them, becoming more whole.
---
Are you serious? no killer runs this because it's not all that useful at all. no one goes in expecting a basement game besides i guess those who insidious camp in the basement(which is stupid and i don't see anyone doing really anymore). I really don't think it needs a nerf, more along the lines of a rework. like make it give more points if you manage hook in the basement. or it guarantee's survivors only get 2 hooks in basement(maybe a little op, but I'm just spitballing.)
---
It's called a rework, which means you rework mechanics so it could work. I have watched videos of old Legion. I know how it was op. But they can balance them around that rather than making them one of if not the worst killer in the game by punishing them for using their power.
---
Oh no! No free escape!? How awful. If you're the last survivor and you don't find the hatch first, the killer should be getting you. You're not entitled to escape just because you waited for your last teammate to be sacrificed so you can get the hatch. If you're really struggling that much, when you're the last survivor, try heading to the exit gate instead of looking for the hatch. Wait for the killer to find the hatch then immediately start opening the gate. If the hatch is far enough away you'll get your free escape.
---
Predator or xenomorph would be cool af. Idk if they want to put in another teleporting killer with the ring chick, but if they do I’m totally down for it. Tvs or wells across the map that she can crawl out of would be terrifying
---
 Failure to Create Party when trying to play survivor and No Network Connection when waiting for Killer to queue up. Not happening to everyone but enough people... DbD is basically down for some of us
---
Ok ill try

Very true. David does not need to flex during the game, as it is obvious to anyone that he is the real master.
---
I would DC too, clown is already unfun to go against in general, especially with that addon... then you went ahead and added the mori on top of it all, it’s all just a little overboard. Not saying you shouldn’t play it, but you shouldn’t be mad either if the survivors DC.
---
my sister said she wishes for a "im not the entity" charm or shirt in the season pass so i can put it on nea
---
I'm hoping shed be like a mix of the demogorgon and the doctor. Being able to mesmerise survivors and get them to stop running, having hallucinations and put a timer on the survivors similar to the 7 days thing
---
That dude is not Vigo.
---
I have two main problems with Spirit. First, she's basically impossible to play against unless you are already running Iron Will and Spine Chill. Dedicating two perk slots just to be able to play against one killer ridiculous when there are already 17 killers, and that number is going to increase over time.  
---
Second, it's not fun to play against. While there has always been an element of prediction in the game, most of the time you are making a read based on the other players movements. When you are playing Spirit it feels like you are making a read on the survivor, but when you are playing survivor it doesn't feel like you are making a read on her. There just isn't enough information to feel like your decisions are really influencing the outcome of the exchange.  
---
She is in a tier of killers balanced for high rank SWF opponents, where the game balance is fucked anyways. There is nothing fair about that killer in a solo queue match. Since I play most of my matches in solo queue red ranks, you could probably imagine that I don't like playing against Spirit.
---
I say plague because her power is really fun to use, but coming from a plague main this is biased lol
---
Cool. If you are dumb enough as the unhooked player to chill near the hook or take the hit for the unhooker it's your fault not the killers.
---
It doesnt change that I can slug the dumbass who got off hook who's playing cocky, then go chase, slug and hook his friend and come back to him and get hit with DS.
---
Been playing mostly survivor. I have less issues during overnight eastern time when less demand on servers.
---
that would then probably make endgame collapse a lot more difficult for lower tier killers. basing the game on a certain killers map pressure wouldn’t be smart
---
i cant tell if this is a joke or not
---
Never heard of it, honestly I'd just much rather a mummy killer though tbh
---
I’m having the exact same problem and I thought it was me all along. Hopefully it’ll get fixed soon
---
I'm continually getting "Party creation failed" on PS4 when trying to play as a survivor. Killer seems to be the only one that queues for me. Restarted the game and PS but no effect
---
Yea the new update is creating crazy lag. Also does anyone else’s ps4 sound like an airplane taking off when they have dbd open??
---
The devs had said regarding exit gate spawning it amounts to nothing more then you win some you lose some.
---
Gonna be honest, after no lifing the game last 2 days Ive yet to have a toxic post game lobby. It might just be luck but I think just copy and pasting gg at the end of every game curbs a lot of the toxicity.
---
You've never heard of The Mummy movies with Brendan Fraser?
---
Came to report this - same issue here.
---
When you ask for Downvotes people ignore your opinion because they can tell that your just here to provoke. I’m going to provide my points on why Spirit has barely or little counterplay. First of all, Survivors are completely defenceless when a Spirit runs Stridor, Once injured it removes the primary counterplay that the Spirit mains always tell you to use only to run stridor 100% of the time. Another point I have heard is “Be unpredictable and Juke her, If you can’t do that then you suck at survivor!1!1!1!” I play both sides and the point of being unpredictable is waaaaay fo broad to even suggest it as a point. Becoming unpredictable has a certain limit depending on the area/map. However its to broad to define unpredictable because eventually you can’t define it ans anything you can do that is “unpredictable” becomes predictable. A point you suggested is “Just mindgame her” Its almost the same as be unpredictable which is way to broad and adaptable once you’ve lost a spirit with a certain tactic. Mindgames also depend on the loop and if I were to stand still while Spirit is phasing then that make her lose some leverage and guess incorrectly but it still puts me in a horrible spot. Its worse if Im injured as well. A common point I hear is “Adapt to the spirit” That in itself is hard to do because she is invisible and she has multi directional phasing and Prayer beads destroys that warning the phasing doesn’t even provide in the first place. When you play Spirit the world is yours because the Survivors hate you with a burning passion and are prone to more mistakes along with the Overall advantage you gain with the lowest skill ceiling of High tier killers to ever exist. At least billy takes skill and practice, Same with Nurse, Demo, Ghostface and Freddy to be effective. Spirit is just way to easy to claim she has counterplay if A decent player can pick her up and Rob survivors of any tools they have to counter them.
---
Wow, someone who understands that a killer deserves as much chance at a 4k than the last guy escaping.
---
No, I started off by doing just the survivor track and had no problem doing this specific challenge, it must be a bug
---
I mean, what'd be the point? It's already everywhere else, not much use to delete it now.

Uh,  rank doesnt mean anything. I have a group of friends that are all new to the game and don't even know the basics of looping and they are red ranks solo queuing.

Gotta get that multi chainsaw down
---
My friend also has this and told me some more:
---
- Open both gates and get hatch
---
- Using NOED kill 3 people during EGC
---
I had exact the same 24/25 and then I played on auto heaven as killer and NOT A SINGLE CROWN SPAWNED .. had to play a 3rd match.. bullshit game
---
Same. I just posted about it right before I saw your post lol.
---
The only time I would run it were if I had no better perks and were soloing
---
I just want me bloodpoints lad
---
Haha I can already see potential people complaining about another timer, but I think it sounds dope. What do you think about the grudge? Instead of a heartbeat would she just make that crazy sound?
---
I burned mori (0K/hook) had to DC, came back some time later and ice collected the reward
---
Stuff the crows and set them around the map.
---
Same here, waited forever in the killer lobby once I fixed my issue with my profile not going online. Hopefully they extend the blood point event and withering blight event due to this.
---
I still don't understand the point of killer cosmetics. I mean sure, they are nice to look at during the lobby screen, but other than that what is the use? Do you buy the skins for others enjoyment? Its a first person POV so its not like you are going to see that beautiful ass in-game. Same as Myer's skin, great outfit, but you won't really see it in-game.
---
Me personally, I just focus on the weapon cosmetics only, just because this is what I will be seeing in the lobby and in-game. If I have leftover currency then maybe I will buy an outfit. Of course, this is just my opinion and I would love to hear what you guys think about this.
---
and can you find this post on instagram? no you can not because this picture was posted on a PRIVATE ACCOUNT
---
We have displeased the entity.
---
I cant even find a killer lobby on ps4 either, and if I try to play survivor I get an error 'failed to create party'
---
I’m in now!
---
Did you forget that you typed those exact lines? It’s non-advice and doesn’t do anything to help.
---
They will never do so seeing as every bloodhunt, something goes wrong. What they should do is make the damn pustula petals actually do something.
---
It's been a LONG time since I played. Last time was probably around when Huntress first dropped and my god have survivor DCs gone up (or so it seems)
---
More than half the time I play now one survivor usually DC's within the first minute or 2 after being struck once and then shortly after another will dc as soon as they are picked up.
---
This is not fun for anyone, why is there no real punishment for this. DCing survivors and killers should be sent to play in their own world with others who DC. Keep them from ruining the fun of both survivors and killers, I'll proudly take my wiggle and struggle BP's, I can't imagine how boring it must be for frequent killers to constantly only have 2 survivors to play against.
---
Even if they nerfed her (and personally I think they wouldn't nuke her out of playability), she can be fun and she has really good teachables. The survivor in that chapter has 1-2 good teachables as well.

And it will be some time until they nerf her, so you can play her anyway if you buy her now.
---
I’m sure people will disagree but my personal opinions on them are: 
---
Plague
---
Viability 2/3 - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Legion
---
Viability 1/3 - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Pig
---
Viability 1/3 - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Clown
---
Of course every game is different and there are so many factors (perks, SWF, add-ons, maps, etc) so you may be successful or unsuccessful with any of them. 
---
Power-wise, I’d say Clown and Plague have the most potential. Pig’s power needs some help and Legion is... well, Legion. 
---
If you’re looking for gen control perks, consider Pig, Clown, or Legion, though PGTW is the favorite of mine with high-mobility killers. Otherwise, I tend to like Surveillance since it allows a tighter and more efficient gen-patrol-loop. 
---
If you want a killer that people hate going against for some reason, Legion and Plague are probably your best bets.
---
If you want a drawn-out game, a good pressuring Plague with Thanatophobia and Ruin can really stomp gen progress, and will force survivors to consider cleansing. Just don’t be surprised if you see DCs.
---
You don’t see a lot of clowns out there but I personally find him quite fun to play as and against and I wish we would see more in the Fog. 
---
Another thing to consider... if you’re buying with real money, think about Pig, as the others can be earned with in-game currency with enough playtime. She is also my personal favorite so minor bias there. (:
---
Just had a Quainton toxic af lmao
---
She’s 18 like the actresses playing highschool students in most movies.  We see those crows feet setting in.
---
Who said it was my first time at rank 4?
---
Ninja throwing stars confirmed.
---
It’s pretty obvious that they’re joking....
---
I just tried killer and same thing
---
As survivor I get the friend's party error.  As killer I just search for a long forever...
---
Ugh!    Finally a double bloodpoints weekend I'm not working and this happens🤬
---
What are you playing on? I play on pc and every time a patch comes out I have some kind of error. Usually verifying the game files fixes it even though I've never touched them
---
the promo art looked smexy! i was like...legion is gonna give spirit a run for her yen
---
Ah, great! Thanks so much for the quick and detailed response! 
---
It’s nice to see that we still get some event BP as we’re starting and grinding for the offerings. I don’t think that was the case before.
---
I generally fail when I try to do this or it becomes a trade off and the other guy gets away, and I die. Good on you for sticking with it!
---
I hope not, I was just about to get online lol
---
Yeah man same I was in a killer queue for 15min and then I got an error saying I wasnt connected to the internet... lmao hopefully they fix this soon
---
Bieve Overton
---
but im just glad they did the smart thing and allowed them to be buyable without money. i picked up the female legion body
---
Hook camping all 6 matchs smh lol
---
Platform PC
---
Since the mid chapter update when I'm the killer I just disconnect from the server and get the D/C penalty. Computer and internet are fine, not sure why this is happening. Anyone else having similar issues?
---
5*
---
So its not only me then.
---
Get stuck on syncing with friends list with my ps4 sounding like its about to take off.
---
Then I get in the game and can't play survivor cause of a "failed to connect to party" error.
---
Or try killer and get no lobbies...
---
Wtf Behaviour
---
Activate windows.
---
Devs have never stated that the characters are over 18 they have stated that all the survivors are international adults that is the only age confirmation they have ever given
---
A Dwight of culture
---
It is 5 plants
---
Iron Will= Still can hear and see your steps
---
Walking: The Spirit stops phasing
---
Try to be unpredictable= Walking= The Spirit stops phasing
---
Always break the distance (????)
---
If you hear her footsteps you're gonna get hit since she's right next to you
---
they barely glow besides you will get hit anyways...
---
Enjoy the game and ignore the mean messages.  You can’t make everyone happy.  Though it seems you did make that rank 18 happy with the loop.
---
If you message back just say gg, gg sry or gf sry I’m new.
---
That's never gonna be possible
---
Ah did not know that
---
*laughs in trapper*
---
Same issue. Trying to play as a survivor comes up with Failed to create a party. Then if I try to play as a killer, I'm just stuck loading. I've been having issues connecting to survivor matches for about two weeks now, but it completely broke this afternoon
---
Is there a way to report this to behavior?
---
But the whole survivor thing wouldn’t work against swf which is half the survivors playing, it’s an interesting idea for a rework but would have to be balanced for swf etc
---
YES! you're absolutely right. huntress is possible because shes faster than nurse and has projectiles, but shes not fun, unless u aim for a survivors head when theyre at a pallet (aim high so the axe doesnt just hit the pallet). but yes, i always believed that bhvr needs nurse to be DIFFERENT between the pc and console versions. if they ever did crossplay, pc nurses would be killing console survivors. the easy answer is...allow the turn sensitivity to be boosted higher than the current max, OR...simply give nurse a higher default turn speed on console. this is not so much a killer change as an input change for console folks.
---
Everyone always forgets the tethered from the 2019 film *Us*. Solid killer, original weapon, plus could easily have an interesting power
---
Me too!
---
Some people are reporting this bug. Sadly you have to wait for a fix
---
😂😂😂
---
Wait till you see Hagrid
---
I am sad for the absence of Velociraptor
---
Why do pc players have to pay for doctor and hag?
---
Dude, I was making a joke, who stepped on your toes this morning?
---
It's just good to build the reflex of looking up instead of turning around, no memorisation needed, except for muscle memory.
---
But all the others in the list are licensed, and he is from his games, not from that terrible movie
---
So you can stare at something while you wait for the 2 hour killer queues
---
Some recents ones that happened to my friends and I.
---
&gt;Pig that camped me in the basement because I “gave her a shit chase”
---
&gt;Huntress that camped a friend because he got glitched into a wall in Yamaoka after she hit him. Eventually we somehow managed to get him unstuck by healing him a couple of times, she picked him up, took him to the basement and facecamped him, then said that he intentionally abused an exploit and that it was a “big no-no” despite it being unintentional
---
&gt;Another friend got facecamped by a Nurse because he didn’t loop her even though he hadn’t run into her for nearly the entire game
---
These were all at Red ranks.
---
Dont forget Jaws he was close on my list
---
Why does nobody think that they'll rework a weak killer first?
---
Like if they're trying to balance the game alternating between the bottom of the barrel and the top would make the most sense.
---
Yeah.. I couldn't click on the search for a survivor party and then I restarted the game and my ps4 crashed.
---
Now I just see an infiinite loading screen when I load into the game, it gets stuck on "Syncing Friends List".
---
I just wanted to have them double bp :(
---
So for the vast majority of us who don't try and be toxic... or bully or any of that stuff who are just out here playing and having fun minding our own business along come rank reset... and bam we can't run our favorite builds because they have 1 or 2 perks that someone somewhere deemed meta or OP... 
---
if I wanna lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet, and iron will behind a rock and watch a killer spin in circles in a tile confused as I giggle that's my business I'm not being toxic or bullying I'm just playing how I like to play and have fun.
---
Poor guy
---
Whole clown and whole Jake.
---
&gt;!But like all I wanted was a Legion cosmetic but the Plague somehow got it first!&lt;
---
i dont know anything about her except that her show is about joy and cleaning up things. Thats all the information you are given which speaks positivity. Shes pretty enough. If punchable is the first thought that comes in to your mind, that begs the question.. who hurt you for you to project your negativity even unto the exact opposite
---
Man that sounds familiar
---
Same, restarting caused my ps4 to crash though and now it gets stuck on the loading screen
---
Putting survs in Basement as Huntress typically isn’t the best idea, as it gets rid of your ability to cross-map with hatchets + BBQ after hooking. It’s extremely rare to see basement hooks against a Huntress in red ranks (although I’ve personally been hooked by OhTofu’s Huntress in the basement) since most of the people maining her up there can and want to BBQ snipe.
---
I’d say definitely green ranks, maaaybe up to rank 6. If I were to do this, though, I don’t know what perks I’d use, although I could see Iron Maiden being potentially useful if they wanted to hop in lockers.. Oak Haft for an add on would be a must imo.
---
Yeah. Chasing people all game, when other people run in front I smack them and then they disappear, but the guy I was chasing is still visible, so the only option is to keep chasing: get called a tunneler and a camper 
---
Leave the unhooked surv alone, unhooked surv walks into my line of sight, so I hit and down them anyway: get called a camper
---
some people should realize that I'm not gonna just ignore them because they have been hooked already. If you are in front of me, and I'm not closer to someone else, I'm gonna smack you
---
Does it not? Guess I didnt get it then LMAO
---
Edit: No, it certainly does count. I'm on PS4, if it matters, but I just checked my trophies and I have it
---
Ruin, thrilling tremor, pop goes the weasel, discordances that’s what I would eventually go for as hillbilly.
---
Yeah pretty much for others enjoyment mostly. I was never interested until I got pretty good with huntress and saw the bear skin which is badass. It might be silly but i feel different in a good way when wearing that badass skin. I feel like I stand out and terrify others more. It’s also just nice seeing it in the menu. The pig has a leather jacket that might serve as better como so that might be another reason for those type of skins. But really, It’s not the best way to spend ones money.  XD
---
They are on sale though.
---
25% off but I guess that's only if you purchase it all together.
---
It's working for me now again
---
Damn that’s pretty lit not gonna lie
---
Those feet tho 😏
---
No I meant about you
---
Wtf is wrong with running bbq and chili during double bloodpoint.
---
Is he though? It was just from a photoshop competition and everything about the character was developed by fans of the character. I dont think the guy who made the image cares that much over copyright and hasnt licensed it or anything.
---
In the miniature looks like she is running in a thong.
---
Medic too, all I need for Platinum...
---
Dbd literally destroys the PS4. The archives have made it really laggy and the matches that I do play dont last long and are disappointing to play. Waiting all that time for a game that lasts 5 minutes.
---
pillowcases were always the best candy bags because they hold so much 😁 aww good times..

Tbh ive met so many people who hate legion, just because no0b 3 does
---
youre an awesome parent!! they look adorable and the costumes are well done.
---
I can find lobbies but every now and again I get a timed out error, or internet required type of error...
---
My favorite today though is survivors crashing out of the lobby... mid run or action they stop repeat the action for a few seconds and blink out of existence... no body no nothing just gone...
---
My internet is fine 1GB up and down... hard wired ethernet cable and one of this happened before the update.
---
I don't have any of those
---
Freddy fazbear pls YES LETS GET THOSE KIDS ONTO HERE
---
well, he's using the actual numbers for the perk. so, I don't think he's joking. I think?? I'm autistic man. I can't tell half the time if people are serious or not. [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Monstrous\_Shrine](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Monstrous_Shrine)
---
I love your user flair.
---
It was an AaronPlays video I think, it was probably in the thumbnail/title
---
For you survivors out there being farmed
---
I will literally ignore you and go after the guy that farmed you. If you walk in front of me, i cant help but hit you...but then ill just leave your body there for someone to heal.
---
Im a survivor sometimes. Nows my chance to kill the idiots, lol
---
The day we get freddy is the day this games fanbase ecomes fortnite
---
But....it is though...better to get off before second state with bt instead of hanging around on the hook as the killer chases the survivor with bt away.
---
Even if you get hit right away, you got a speed boost and the killer has to pause. Literally a mini adrenaline. Plus killer risks  smacking you before you get fully unhooked so bt doesn’t even proc, and most killers go for the rescuer anyway because they expect them to have bt.
---
No dude, he has original games, "The eight pages" and "Slenderman: The Arrival" are original games, not made by fans, Go look a little bit, you will see
---
If you have borrowed time it is not farming, change my mind
---
I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but I think camping is a perfectly valid strategy. It doesn't unfairly exploit any bugs or anything so what's the big deal?
---
it's more the aura reading combined with the other perks
---
WORTH IT WOO
---
Its supposed to be a last resort. Not your go to.
---
I had games 6 games trying to go for the 4k that didn't count because of a DC, I wonder if this was shadow patched in or if it is just a bit buggy
---
just in time too!
---
And predator since the f13 studio is making its own game about em
---
Just want to add don't be a dick who acts like he wants to farm just get a kill or slug everyone...
---
Never trust a farming leather face... hahahah
---
How the hell did she not see you? They looked right at you
---
Long queue times and dead by daylight on ps4. Name a better duo. 10-15 minutes to find games for the longest time
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Joke aside, as a 50/50 main, I actually somewhat agree. But it'd have to be very carefully done, because sometimes you end up chasing someone around the hook, so what I think would be best is if the killer's stain stays on the hook for more than three seconds, the hook progress stops (with exceptions for Spirit's false stain when she phase shifts, Hag's fake stains for her clones, etc). This wouldn't help camping that's between proxy and face (proxy being the "acceptable" kind where they're hovering but still giving you a chance to be unhooked without immediately being downed and face being the really obvious "I'm not moving until you die" kind), where you can rescue but you'll probably still get downed, but it would definitely stop literal face-camping. And let's be honest, literal face-camping is one of the scummiest possible things a Killer can do, so punishing it with the hook progress stopping is fair.
---
what about the killer from i know what you did last summer.. what was he a sailor right?
---
Didn't they like soft reboot into a new story with the VR game?
---
This is how useless Blendettes are born.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just a joke he committed to hard. Don’t worry about it, it’s hard to tell over text lol
---
Clown: Am I a joke to you?
---
Not for me sadly
---
I don’t think she twitches in any other way than she would standing still
---
Yeah i thought about it, i play killer so its not that bad because survivors find match very quickly so i am mostly screwing myself. Might do it if the 13th comes close and i am too high of a rank. Do you get the same rank after the reset or just a bit behind it?
---
Every emblem pretty much has to be irridescant
---
r/suspiciouslyspecific
---
My plan is to eventually do that, also letting people pick cosmetics and add-ons and stuff. Thanks for the advice!
---
Agh, goddammit! Son of a bitch!
---
Her killer name could be “The Voiceless” or “The mimic”
---
A. stop worrying about rank.
---
B. try to learn from your failures. when you take a hit, think about why. e.g. tried to fast vault/pallet drop with killer in range, should have baited instead; panic sprinted when killer might not actually have seen you; didn’t use time effectively, stuff like that. if you need more ideas of common mistakes people make, there’s lots of great youtubers/streamers, some of whom review gameplay footage
---
Yeah i just wanted to say that people who dc are dickheads and BHVR need to do something
---
Lol I don't know if your asking was I in that game and you are the quentin if so I was the nea
---
I believe it is 2 iridescent and 2 gold.
---
Franshish
---
Yes that is really cool awesome idea!
---
A good LF can make Hillbilly look like the Nurse
---
It's hard to explain but it's very obvious (at least to me and my friends) when she phases
---
What are you, 10 years old?
---
SHIT, that would be perfect knew I was forgetting something lol.
---
Well... I'm pretty sure that's not a priority since ya know... People can't even get into the game. Mods already said it was a PSN issue so us who are waiting to play have to keep waiting. As for your issue... You should report that under the bug thread
---
Oh, no. I thought he was serious. But after thinking about it, I'm pretty sure now he was joking. I'm autistic, and over text its hard to tell sarcasm.
---
Did this get changed against recently? I used to get them with 3 golds and 1 silver a month or two ago. It’s because I’m such a low rank of 18 that it’s easier to achieve it.
---
Oh restarting the ps4 works? I restarted the game a few times with no success. So I'll try that next. Thanks
---
The 'easiest' way is to kick a ton of gens, hook everyone 3 times and keep as many gens alive as possible
---
Why a flashlight? They fucking suck! Seriously mine keep toggling and the killers are never blinded when I shine it right in his face. They get me killefer every time
---
Oh ok I will sorry
---
...you’re stuck at r16 and *you* know how to do flashlight saves???
---
Oh sorry if I offended you. Didn't know that
---
We got a pant-less myers.
---
Platform?
---
I thought thos were black forces ( stay away from him)
---
I'm 80% sure they didnt change it
---
Oh no it's *SBEVE*
---
Steam, sorry forgot to add that on there my bad
---
I’m assuming you’re on x-box
---
Yeah, but if you go by theory, Final Girls/Boys get supernatural strength and abilities when they are the last one.
---
If they don't make the meme themselves, then yes, they are.
---
I just matched with a p3 quentin, he was a pretty cool dude
---
This is basically me, yeah, except I made my own mask
---
You mean this might be an upcoming cosmetic or this was the original pre-release banner?
---
I've fought *two* iridescent head and infantry belts at yellow ranks since this event started.
---
I hooked every survivor three times except 1, which I only hooked once in endgame. I closed the hatch. They only repaired 1 generator.
---
Thank tou my friend
---
I heard the next tome will come out in like 2 weeks. I don’t know if that’s true or not.
---
Yeah. If BBQ didn’t have double BP its like B tier at best. Worse version of Thrilling Tremors.
---
I mist just have shit for luck! Lol
---
Oh, I wasn't that toxic player. I don't remember having Nea's, sorry that you had to suffer through a toxic player.
---
Quentin mains rise up!
---
Probably because they're like me in every time they try to use a flashlight they end up getting killed because they don't seem to actually work the way they're supposed to half the time.
---
 Seriously I try my best to not get flashlights and if I do I take them in just to give them somebody else because I can never use them effectively the killer always goes without being blind with its me or worse they keep fucking toggling every time I vault over something then they don't want to work when I try to actually use them
---
Obviously a witch
---
Oh, I'm not offended. I don't take offence to much of anything anymore. At least not since.....the war.
---
What’s your steam ID? I could add you later and maybe do something sometime :)
---
OK Boomer
---
As a huntress main. Iridescent heads, and infantry belt. Brutal combo
---
ZephTheJay, I'd like that thanks!
---
The big deal is people are spending 15 to 20 minutes WAITING to play the game. You're ruining the game the other person you're staring at on the hook who just had their time wasted for nothing and are effectively unable to play a game they paid for just so you can be a lame piece of shit. This isn't COD or battlefield where people are going to just repeatedly respawn throughout the match. They have only 1 life in a match that you ruined for them. 
---
That's what the big deal is.
---
I did look, that’s what it says on true achievements. How dumb is that. I know people complain how hard they are, but like...The survivors only repaired 1 generator.
---
Running Left Behind and shit.
---
I played five matches this morning and didn’t have an issue with survivor wait times. Killer wait times were awful though.
---
Upcoming cosmetic.
---
Yeah man my streaming groups deals with the same waiting times. It’s sometimes frustrating to deal with, but there’s nothing we can do.
---
Omg wow lololol. I’ve been trying random killers for fun and I’m surprised no one has commented on how trash I am, especially as the huntress. 
---
Aside: you finding queue times are ridiculous?
---
Clearly blood point tax went up
---
Yeah I saw that, insane lol
---
Im not worried about it I just want to stop facing level 20 killers cause its just so boring I watch true and noob3 true got me to rank 13 killer until I got bored I watch noob just because its hilarious  
---
Just sick of camping wraiths every game Wasing my cakes and shit
---
Dude I am not an asshole who will care about outer beauty.
---
Its her body language and misdemeanor which screams **I am faking it**
---
Whatever is her profession, thats one thing but how she is selling it is just fucking pretentious.
---
Meanwhile I’m sitting here, proud of myself for hitting red rank as a killer who never played spirit.
---
Ehmmm, do admins actually delete downvoted comments? Fun...
---
I agree that having killers be at different ranks would be nice for people that are still attempting to learn another killer but having it be completely independent from each other would lead to easy smurfing. 
---
Maybe having killers rank independently but having the lowest rank possible be 3-5 less than your top killer's rank would work.
---
&gt;!I'm a rank 7 Legion that doesn't know how to play anybody else effectively, help me!&lt;
---
These used to be the best add-ons when insta flashlights were a thing
---
It’s amazing how dumb survivors will play assuming you are bad for playing bubba. So much fun sometimes
---
it freaking hurts, my sister even once step on a needle....
---
Lol its cool none of us escaped which was a shame after all that teabagging quentin done
---
It was never on time though? It's vaulting the same window 3 times in a chase blocks it. It has been like this for as long as I've even played the game

That’s a lotta shards but it’s nice you can earn the skins. So that’s about 7000 per piece?

yeah i’d say just use pustules since they’ll expire soon, play stealthy gen jockey, don’t go for dumb saves since dumb teammates will go for them anyway and you’ll need someone on gens. sounds like you’re trying to improve your looping but if that’s your goal you just need to accept your rank til you improve. working gens is how you punish campers, so work gens if rank up is your priority.
---
It's a lot of shards indeed. I believe it's 7200 per piece

You cannot blame the survivor for the killer being a skilled camping bitch.

I would hardly call the console community casual. Most people take it very, very seriously. Low rank yes but mid high isn't.

You really don't understand how the internet works, do you?

Bull fucking shit Steve doesn’t teabag, especially with the scoops ahoy skin
---
After the first hit I realized I should have just given up so I did. :\ Knowing his connection if I went to vault the window or try to locker juke him he'd hit me from far away.

I totally understand your view and you don’t deserve down votes, I on the other hand like skins for supporting the devs/art team, let survivors have something more interesting to look at while a try to spill their guts and because as someone said already something to look at while waiting for 2hr killer ques
---
yeah, I think you just need to focus on the base game, you’re trying to play too high level for where you are. just focus gens and get a safe save when you can or when it’s kind of down to you. learn to gauge when that is.
---
Just check Hag’s bio, it’ll tell you if you have it unlocked

Youtube I think

---
Jesus that’s actually pretty funny, I was wondering about the cereal too!
---
and the dbd account this post got it from deleted the picture.
---
Yeah, I can imagine how much it sucks when people assume cosmetics = toxic, because of the people that play with them. 
---
I play in a P3 outfit, which killers use as an invitation to tunnel.
---
There's two ways  this can go.
---
Three of them are in Dead by Daylight, one is not.
---
Three of them are in a movie, one is not.
---
Grudge can work, maybe not instead of a heartbeat though, it would be a lullaby similar to freddy and huntress or just a sound the killer makes. Personally I think grudge works better especially due to how the ring does not run and her power would be confusing
---
yeah, on hook too. donno why her tits have jigglebones but other fems dont
---
Hey man. I'm in the same boat, what did you end up doing?
---
Big F for us cosmetic players
---
First of all: Thank you &lt;3
---
I really would like to try and animate this, I've been working on a potential story that could fit and it could be very funny but i'm way too slow, it took me one week to do these. Maybe someone more talented will be inspired and have the courage to animate this baby
---
Pls don't burn me
---
BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Ruin, PGTW. Combo it with slowdown add-ons. Gens will never get finished, you will become the slowdown god
---
I'm quite sure there's still several pages out there that have it up fam.
---

---
Where do you live where legos are needles?
---
#dedicated servers everyone

*EBONY MEMENTO MORIS*
---
New cosmetics on a Saturday?! They are going mad for sure.
---
Did you leave all of the hooked survivors alone or where you in the close vacinety of the hook?
---
Usually up until around 1 1/2 weeks until rank reset red ranks are safe from most face campers. Speaking solely from close to 1800 hours experience of playing on Steam.
---
When I play with my friends who are either more casual than me or not as good at the game, I get face camped a ton. Not cause I’m “toxic” or anything like that, I’m not teabagging at every pallet or some stupid shit. I’ve been playing a lot of Steve since he came out and I guess for some reason people just *really* don’t like him?
---
But I have seen just about every reason under the sun for camping, including my friend being told it was because she’s female. Like what the actual *fuck*?
---
It's the way the game works
---
I’m not complaining ;P
---
Level II: November 13th.
---
Level III: November 27th.
---
Level IV: December 18th.
---
These release dates are subject to change.
---
Some combos that I can recommend are:
---
Spoopy Doctor:
---
- Haunted, Pop, Monitor, Sloppy 
---
(Be a threat anytime with instadowns, exposed status and a reduced terror radius) 
---
 
---
Gen Doctor:
---
- Overcharge, Thrilling, Pop, Sloppy
---
(Generators are your enemy and you smack them good)
---
Sneaky Doctor:
---
- Monitor + Calm addons
---
(Reduce your terror radius to 8m or less, appearing out of nowhere) 
---
Basic Build:
---
- Enduring, Distressing, Sloppy, Pop
---
(Nothing wrong with a little classic)
---
No shit, but you put it as a suggestion. So I'm telling you it's already a thing.
---
I really was hating on myself while drawing it but I wanted this scene to be the exact replica from the show :p
---
Discordance, PGTW, sloppy and BBQ is what I've run so far and haven't lost when I do decide to play as him.
---
Art is my man, I’ve watched that way movie too many times just for him
---
My best creation &lt;3
---
you don’t really understand how privacy works, do you? posting a private picture without natalia’s consent is messed up. the picture was private for a reason as she didn’t want you dbd stans to have the photo? all of natalia’s stans deleted the photo no problem so why can’t you???? it’s not that hard. most of you call her “natalie dyer” when that’s not her name, so why is it so hard for you to let go of this picture you weren’t allowed to post in the first place?
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Oof
---
Thanks for the suggestion dude, i think i will use the Spoopy Doctor
---
Yeah but that goes against what you said. You said ranks for each killer. Yet experience carries over from killer to killer its just different abilities and slight tricks. This would just be new players getting shat on.
---
So anyway, we started blasting.
---
If it's a private photo, it shouldn't have been uploaded to the internet.
---
Just saying, no offence obvs. Some of these are only recognisable, Hannibal for instance, but really isn’t that unique for a game like this. How u gonna put the blind man in when he’s basically just a creep with a gun? The tethered are actually unique, I can agree that someone like Jason or the candy man are probably better options, but having a normal psychopathic man isn’t an interesting killer. Idk, nothing against it I just find the logic of saying the tethered aren’t creative enough a bit ironic when u have Norman bates and others in there. All love no hate though :)
---
I am having the same issues on PC
---
cabin in the woods.
---
Lemme fix your list there.  Why survivors teabag.  
---
1) They all do it, and it's because they're assholes.
---
2) there is no number 2
---
Idk man if you did buy some auric cells I would probably go on bvhr site and tell them you haven’t gotten your bought auric cells. 
---
But first try and uh look to see if it’s in download area and just reload the game, maybe reload your Xbox. If that doesn’t work contact bvhr.
---
Discordance is awesome on him. Enduring/spirit fury is good on him. Save The Best For Last is okay and I’m All Ears is okay too
---
Thrilling tremors is meta? I hardly ever see it.
---
Sloppy is a good time waster, but on killers with insta downs it is almost useless.
---
Corrupt intervention would make more sense in this list imo.
---
Very common one's would be STBFL and nurse's (which is great in combination with sloppy)
---
Add ons?
---
That word isn’t allowed for jokes anymore.
---
I completely agree with you. Thing is the community, devs, and pretty much everyone’s grandma hates Legion. You’re not going to find anyone who is willing to agree.
---
Hard to make distance when she moves at the speed of light when phasing and hard to break it when a phase can be faked.  
---
I can't see the shards glow when I'm a good distance away, and If im not running Iron will and not next to a pallet or window, I might as well give up.   
---
Even when im walking, she can still bump into me lol
---
Shirtless Michael Myers. Duh.
---
^^^^.
---
^^^^It's ^^^^Frank, ^^^^from ^^^^The ^^^^Legion.
---
I'm not the one who posted it. Either way if you dint want something on the internet maybe dont post it on the internet
---
OH YEAH
---
I remember back in the instablind days, there was an old clip of 72hrs bullying AdmiralBahroo with 3 other survivors by chain blinding him with flashlights, and Bahroo started spinning around to stop it. I wish I could find the clip.
---
It's on the rift I was able to buy them just fine I just have not gotten the cells from the rift
---
It's still a 'devs are bad give me upvotes'-post so idc if it's a shitpost.
---
I'd love to but the new David outfit with his suit and the mechanic head on is too good.
---
#NUT#
---
Yeah I know and contact bvhr since you didn’t get them...
---
Yeah at that point in the game you are absolutely *NOT* supposed to have a fair shot. You failed to complete the gens, and you failed to locate the hatch. At that point you should just be grateful they even give you another chance, regardless of how slim that chance is. How hard does a killer have to cripple your team before you think they’re allowed to have an advantage?
---
See my problem there with it simply not working remains if I try to save someone it just doesn't blind them or they look away
---
It's 2019 and people still usin gay as an insult
---
I said I’m aware because a storm of other people have told me, some nicer than others. Thanks for adding to the 5 other explanations.
---
BBQ and Ruin are pretty much staples for killer.  Get BBQ ASAP.
---
To end this debate a spirit player with good headphones and no stridor should play against a survivor with iron will. The determining factor is that survivor must survive for (insert time) or less. Video evidence too.
---
thank you for proving my point. natalia never posted this picture. this account got ahold of a picture they weren’t allowed to post. that is why they are disrespecting natalia’s privacy. she didn’t want anyone having this picture which is why she never posted it anywhere, and continuing to have this picture up is going against natalia’s wishes.
---
seems acReate to me
---
If killer.connectionStatus == "Manual-disconnection" :
---
    for survivor in match.survivorList:
---
        survivor.returnOffering()

XBOX
---
The Rift
---
Im not able to get the auric cells from the rift even though ive reached the appropriate tier
---
So I just checked the wiki and it says exactly this
---
&gt;Danny Johnson, known as Jed Olsen by some,
---
so both are true?
---
This is almost never true. There are very few scenarios where it’s not worth it healing under hook
---
natalia never posted this picture anywhere therefore this account is not in the right to be spreading this picture around.
---
It's not about the Meta perks/add-ons/offerings. Choose what you like and enjoy playing with.
---
I find it less frustrating to be farmed them to get 2nd stage on first hook personally.
---
Well tecnically yeah, but they just now started making the other 3 movies and there is a recap in the begining of the 2018 one, so you can say watching only those would make a standalone trilogy
---
Pipping is way too easy. Just do a little on everything and you’ll get at least one no problem
---
Yeah, yeah, yeah, behaviour have already publicly stated they know of the glitch and are working towards a patch. Hold your horses.
---
&gt;Start walking when she’s phasing?
---
yeah I don't know why people think walking is some sort of GOD counterplay against her. She moves at 176% the speed of survivors *running* while phasing. She can just go to where she last saw you and you haven't enough time to make any meaningful distance
---
I mean she is.
---
yes, always
---
No.
---
Help our PSN brothers and sisters
---
Just got the game a week ago, already level 50 Cannibal thanks to bloodhunt
---
Makes sense. The second one just feels so different lol.
---
If Spirit get a remarkable nerf everyone is going to move to Freddy, remember this.
---
Because being gay is an insult
---
I always have a ping of 30-40 and I can consistently get hits and get hit through pallets and I've never on P2P gotten hits through pallets nor been hit through dropping a pallet on a solid ping
---
I don’t believe there’s a site but if you watch YouTube videos you’ll get a good idea. 
---
Fungoose on twitch has killer builds and he likes to help others by explaining anything. Just pop by his twitch and ask him a question. 
---
He also has chat command for killers like for example you could do !nurse and it would give you the killer build.
---
I mean the devs said she is "over-performing" which is the same thing as saying she's overpowered, is it not?
---
Add deliverance
---
play with friends, its a struggle but it helps. If one person is being camped, focus on those objectives. Dont let it be in vein
---
I agree people only started hating her after nurse nerf shes fine outside some addons, she is far from my best killer and people just DC, so wild... just like people who said 2 blink nurse is fine but dced perios
---
ikr, being extremely hilarious is a curse u.u
---
Honestly until they get right just stick to P2P
---
So me complaining about a  developer pooping out skins every week but to lazy to fix issues... is out of place in a topic where again more skins are added to the pile?
---
Well, I guess this shows I can live with out of place! No?
---
- Not to mention getting downvote on this subreddit actually means your striking a nerve, if you want upvotes here just post dank memes that all it takes... tells you just about how much this playerbase is worth right? Suvivors crying about Killers, Killer whining about survivors and dipsticks throwing cash at a game the devs are to lazy to fix becasue: "We didn't actually give you a date?" Best. Dodge. Ever!
---
Btw, is there anything actually false about anything I have said here? If so, point it out please...
---
rest assured my friend the important thing is to show the art
---
My guess is they were just going for the gender neutral term, so yes.
---
You’re literally fighting on me about this and for what?. Where did I even say exact ages?????  I said you had to USE YOUR BRAIN to know they’re above 18.  Not Meg is 20 and a Claudette is 19.   Lol the fuck
---
About the Distressing, How can i use it? I know that it is for a larger terror radius, but i don't really know how this perk can help me.
---
If it does its certainly not intentional, expect a fix soon
---
it’s a generic tip, so it’s using ‘they’ as a neutral pronoun, so i’d say so.
---
Omg i want to try this perk build now LOL
---
Yeah, so I that case it should be (killers’) 
---
Edit oh never mind, I’m confused
---
:(((((((((((
---
If 19 out of 20 games the killer "camps", then you and your definition of camping is the problem sorry
---
Why? Genuinely curious, as English isn’t my primary language.
---
i had everything i needed and r3 on bubba and prestiging was the worst decision ever
---
the best time to prestige would be when you have everything unlocked and you're not actively playing the killer you want to prestige
---
Always aim for any perks first, second comes Bloodpoint offerings (flowers, wreaths, Escape Cake, Pudding, Party Streamers). After that, I generally aim for any brown items because they're cheaper and therefore cost less to level up the web.
---
I don’t understand what advice you’re looking for, either you get a bad spirit that is easy to mind game or a really good one that will completely destroy you.
---
Pretty sure it was the 4%
---
***HONK HONK***
---
Springyboi would be good but I feel like non fnaf fans are less aware of him, so a worse choice as far as marketing goes.
---
* *Platform:* PC
---
* *Type of Bug: Force reboot*
---
* *Description:* 3 times in a row, my PC gives a little sound and reboots even while I'm still in the menu looking for a match. The third time I got to loading screen before it crashed. I've had force shutdowns before with multiples games, DbD more than others, but never this consistent to the point I can't play the game.
---
That happened to me yesterday.
---
Once again you're bringing up survivors.
---
The point was around The Legion's ages
---
As you stated you said that they have said that everyone was over 18 which is technically not true as they said every Survivor is 21 and over.
---
I was never commenting on survivors so the fact you brought up adding Mike or eleven is irrelevant.
---
Hell in the Stream where they discussed this they even brought up the reason why because you can't have have young kids being brutally killed because it would hike up the age rating.
---
They used “they” because they are talking about all the killers, not one.
---
Okay? Still on her for sending it to anyone to begin with. Again, you don't want anyone to see it? Don't post it. Even if it's in DMs, you run that risk of them publicizing it. People on the internet have NO obligation to respect your privacy if you post something.
---
I have a lot of fun with Pig. She’s not top tier by any means, but she’s fun to play as (and against, imo). Make Your Choice is good, surveillance is okay, hangman’s trick is meh.
---
My second would be Plague. I’m not a high rank killer at all, but I have good luck playing as her. Most low rank survivors will cleanse, which makes the games pretty easy. Corrupt intervention is her best perk, infectious fright is useful but only okay, dark devotion isn’t very useful at all.
---
Probably the lack of weaponry has something to do with it
---
Google "singular they". Was quite enlightening to me as I'm not a native speaker myself.
---
damm that’s crazy you really just got absolutely outskilled bro
---
I don't know. I do kind of Miss old Freddy. But new Freddy is so good after the rework. I wouldn't mind Legion getting that sort of treatment. Right now the only people seem to play him are the most toxic and scummy on the game.
---
Most people who are complaining about him being too weak right now are the ones who only play Legion as killer and don't like missing out on a basically free win. 
---
Mending will never be fun. That's why most people hate him. Most people don't like how he always knows where you are. And a lot of people don't like the fact that Legion can still tunnel better than most killers.
---
Maybe because the other female survivors are flat as hell.
---
all good :)
---
"Desincentived". Lmao
---
what did you use to make the skull?
---
New survivor perk: "building block."
---
After staying in the killer's terror radius for 45 seconds you can drop a Lego. If the killer steps on the lego they are slowed by 0% but let out an audible "ouchie."
---
I disagree with this tier list because dwight needs to be higher because of all the toxic pizza dwights
---
Sometimes you just gotta style on some survivor punks
---
You didn’t
---
I just checked, I don't see any DLCs on sale?
---
I agree, but how can we define what skill actually is and find 2 players with same skill on different roles?
---
whats your deal
---
I’m playing my 2nd game in a row against the same spirit that uses the same add-ons right now. Just got face camped Becuase I sent him a hate message
---
jesus what is with some of you male gamers... just delete the picture.
---
Legion doesn't require skill. That's why most the scummy brain dead people play him. He will never be fun to play against. Sure he's an easy Escape but mending is annoying and most of the people who play him tend to Tunnel or be obnoxious.
---
I mostly play skill Reliant Killers like nurse or Huntress
---
Legion needs a complete power overhaul. Delete what we have now and rework him from the ground up like Freddy. Then maybe people will like him. Until then I'm going to block every lead main I encounter
---
And I'm sure most people do, myself included. I'm just a little suspicious of the curbstomp ggs, because if you're sporting, why did you curbstomp them, and if you curbstomped them, how is it a "good" game?
---
She is a real person lol
---
i loved him in Phantom Menace 😏😏
---
This is pretty toxic, but if a survivor is farming his teammates, I make sure to go for the people getting farmed, just to prove to whoever has Borrowed Time that it's not going to result in a free save and maybe they should stop doing it. I understand the usual process is to take the mean person out of the game, but really, you're the killer, why not be devious with it.
---
Extra points because I play Pig and she can literally just crouch walk towards the ticking down-bomb.
---
Ok I’m just talking about survivors.  Did you have to argue or are your keyboard fingers feeling feisty??? But even if you read the lores of each killer, you can put two and two together and realize they’re not 16 years old???? 
---
Plus, again, while using your brain... having child survivors is much more fucked up than the killers. Survivors are DYING.  And they make it known Spirit is in University.  I believe everyone are 18+
---
Thrill of the Hunt buff lookin' good.
---
I agree. Legion is underrated af. But that’s probably due to the moonwalkers.
---
Good, Freddy can be OP with the right build, but at least it's kinda enjoyable to play against him, even if the new oblivious dream world buff can sometimes be frustrating.
---
Spirit is just BS.
---
good luck, that's gonna take a while to read.
---
Whatever people's opinions on the rift are, it's damn great to finally have *something* new to do after years. Lol
---
Same as you. Lol. 
---
Ok will teach you what i know, using an example 
---
If I say “the boy’s toys” that’s correct, but if they are a bunch of boys, and because there isn’t a plural form of the word boys, then it becomes”the boys’ toys”.
---
 So if there is plural form of the word, like, man, men, then it’s (man’s) or (men’s)
---
I don't know, what's so complicated to understand that maybe you shouldn't send things you want kept private to random people on the internet?
---
One or two killers will always be over-perfoming. After spirit it would be billy and freddy and hag, then ghostface and demogorgon etc. I don't think that nerfing killers one by one is a good idea.
---
Wtf I have 450 and only 3 to 40 (okay I got nearly all survs to 40 but yeah...)
---
Nah man you’re the only one
---
Oh damn
---
It's a joke because some of the level 4 tome challenges are brutally difficult.
---
Pretty long waits as surv, very long as killer
---
I’d take Freddy over Spirit any day personally
---
Yeah, about 100 other threads.  
---
There's even a folk hero dumping a stack of links everytime someone posts this.
---
That’s the thing, people that tunnel with legion are sped, u shouldn’t tunnel, u shoul instead concentrate on map pressure
---
I mean I got a couple of broken game mechanics. 
---
Endgame,
---
Camping,
---
Disconnects,
---
Infinites,
---
Latency,
---
Queue times,
---
Hit detection,
---
Hook placement,
---
Gen placement,
---
Pallet placement,
---
Etc.
---
A werewolf skull decoration I found at Kroger and antlers I got at a halloween store.
---
I glued the antlers to the skull, they look made for each other
---
Yes I'll need the whole day
---
&gt;One or two killers will always be over-perfoming
---
why do you think that? To say that one or two killers will always be the "best" is one thing, but saying they are over-performing is completely different.
---
Ah. Thanks for letting me know
---
Best legion costume I've seen so far
---
Is this a teaser for new burger king builds for killers?
---
Do you are have stupid
---
Ok, allow me to blow your mind.
---
First, and most importantly, the static range that you produce on treatment mode is EXACTLY the same as your terror radius.
---
This means that if you have a bigger terror radius, you cover a bigger area in which all survivors gain madness.
---
Secondly, but also pretty important, it gives you extra meters from your Calm addons.
---
If I remember correctly, purple Calm addon gives you +8 meters when in treatment mode.
---
32m from your basic radius + 8 from Calm means that you produce static in a 40m range.
---
BUT, Distressing applies on top of that.
---
So, if Distressing gives you +20 something% extra, that would mean that your terror radius is actually around 48 meters.
---
All survivors in almost 50 meters around you will gain madness when in treatment mode with Distressing and the purple Calm addon.
---
That's why Doctor benefits from that perk the most.
---
God I hope this is ironic
---
I don't know man, from here it looks like it says 'You tool'! 
---
😂 JK, but it's always nice to find fellow players who enjoy a well-played GG!
---
People constantly tell me she is a perfectly balanced killer. She is literally ruining this game for me. I would rather get faced camped in the basement by bubba than play against spirit. Every spirit tunnels the living shit out of me too
---
Stfu you sweat
---
Oh dang that's a lot
---
"when a phase can be faked." her shards start shining a bit when she starts phasing. A little detail, but if you pay attention to it, you'll have more info
---
I used to do that whenever I got stomped, back in my TF2 days.
---
Fair enough!
---
Yeah they were when the update came out with archives  and then yeah day after i guess they went back
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqof4c/just_another_bug_thanks_bhvr/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Fake as in fake in their attitude, pretentious. She is making a killing manipulating feelings of others personal life.

It seems like freddy got another buff

You said and I quote " I'm aware" , but then you claimed to have said "  I’m aware because a storm of other people have told me, some nicer than others. Thanks for adding to the 5 other explanations. ", dementia is serious, please check out  18001 0300 222 1122 helpline as soon as possible. My thoughts and prayers are with you
---
Well, they did their best to discourage friendly interaction between teams. It's just war now.
---
No you weren't just talking about the survivors because you tried to correct someone who was mentioning that Julie could potentially be 17.
---
Which you said that everybody in the game is over 18. I corrected you and stated that they only said this when addressing survivors and it was about being over 21
---
Deduction on the Legion ages I have given you was based on me reading the lore and putting two and two together.
---
Because all their backstory states is that they are younger than Frank who's 19. Whilst their cosmetic descriptions give more insights on what age they probably might be.
---
Also thank you for reiterating the point I already made it clearly shows that you haven't read a single thing I put down. If you look back at my previous comment you can clearly see see that I say having kids killed will hike up the age rating. If you can put two and two together and realise I was talking about kids dying then maybe you need to use your brain
---
This is the update we need.
---
Killer was meant to be singular in this case because they’re talking about the general idea of it, if that makes sense.
---
Dude, you’re just bad
---
I agree. I completed every challenge so far.
---
No it’s battery than filament
---
Killer leveling is just way more efficient. I play both sides, but when I'm playing purely for BP I only play killer because when you control the match you also control the bloodpoints.
---
Had a Freddy facecamp the entire team last night. Despite the first person having Kindred, the other two teammates didn't really do anything with the time.
---
Infinite Tier 3 actually has a huge drawback though.
---
c'mon man. its november.
---
He’s shooting at them behind the walls., he just needs you to get them to fly away
---
If predator was added as a killer, we could have Dutch as a survivor. 
---
If The Terminator was added as a killer later, we could have Arnold killing Arnold.
---
And once again, she is a fictional character with a grown adult body that developers have stated  is not underage.
---
Why do you keep wanting to see a problem there?
---
lmao sure you have sunshine ;)
---
Grabbin' pills.
---
You basically have to throw. Lol. Of course you can still pip if you play it right but you won't get a 4k unless you find hatch before securing your 3k. I got it the other night and slugged one guy and let 2 escape.
---
Ok that wasn't cool.
---
The game runs considerably better on the PC actually. But most of the bugs and problems can be found in any platform.
---
How are my Survivor games instant solo, 15 minutes with one friend, and not relatably 25?
---
But my Killer waits ARE eternal...
---
Well
---
#P I L L S H E R E #
---
You NEVER cleanse. Cleansing just makes her 10 times stronger whole you get infected within 1 minute anyway. Anyone who cleanses is killing the team and basically is teaming with killer lol
---
Pallets are total invincibility in so many cases that it becomes instinct.
---
She and the Plague need boobs physics.
---
nice earmuffs potter. did your mum make them for you?
---
Okay you care too much about ages (which is creepy if you’re cool with Susie being 16 etc) so I’m gonna end this ridiculous conversation here.  But hey, thanks for that link! I enjoyed reading it!   Toodles Mr. Know It All!
---
Why do you use the prerelease meme just screen cap it now
---
This is a joke my dude
---
Challenges are MUCH better as active sets, rather than individual picks. For a team that hates farming, BHVR really seems to be forcing people to collaborate.
---
I thought the same but ew3 with the pipe is soooo funny and brutal
---
It's only supposed to work once.
---
What do y’all think about the possibilities of a Evil Within survivor or killer? Sebastian seems a bit too similar to Ash, but the Executioner, Stefano or even a Harbringer would be interesting
---
Seriously. Apart from the ptb I don’t think I’ve had a Steve that didn’t teabag
---
Maybe I should try that. This is getting rough
---
Edit: Didn't try that still rough.
---
Needs a Legion player, then this meme will be complete.
---
Well they got the exit gates open, so they probably played poorly.
---
You have the dumb
---
I did that one, bring plunders instinct and run around
---
You’ll get your update when you fix this damn door!
---
Oh.  
---
My condolences my console friend. I'm not familiar with xbox sales.
---
They are. 
---
They've already stated that after Nurse the Doctor is going to get looked at, forget who they said after him though.
---
What do you mean? Survivors get their BP when the killer DCs, or am I missing something?
---
Your going to be in the same spot everytime, on the window or pallet, so its an easy hit. It takes a bit to jump over something, its the delay of the killer that gives you the head start.
---
I only used to watch that one guy TydeTime or something like that but I feel like after all this time there has to be a better consensus on who to watch, any recommendations?
---
Just bring a purple coin. If multiple people are doing it, they probably bought one too
---
I have no idea and honestly I don't care
---
i wrote it in an another post
---
those idiotic challenges will ruin the game for survivors
---
i had idiots players not doing anything else in the whole game but searching for chests,totems or wait just to unhook someone
---
Since the 3.3.0 update? Switch still hasn’t gotten it and it might not come out for awhile soo.. ;(

IMO the only nerf to her that needs to happen is addons of course, but also make the crys of pain be less direct when phasing, like make it fill 1/8th of a compass direction ie: from north to north-east. Still gives a good indication of where they are, but gives them slightly more wiggle room to trick you.
---
Clear how? I don't think I understand. You think that these killers will suddenly begin "over-performing" when more people play them?
---
Got the Jane one and first match was someone using the Frank one on Lerys. His skin was glowing in the dark and looked awesome on Lerys.
---
It's amazing with open handed and a map.  
---
*I can see everything.*
---
Same
---
I think it's actually listed that scratch marks stay visible for 10 seconds but after 7 seconds they are so faint they can not really be seen, so that's why a lot of forums say lightweight will bring it down to 4 seconds. Mixed with Lithe and Dance with me though that is def a hard build to chase.
---
No. If the killer disconnects while the game is still going, survivors lose all their bloodpoints. I sent in a bug report already about it since I sure fucking hope it isn’t supposed to be like that, but it’s happened a handful of times to us just this event alone.
---
They were utter bullshit with some survivors (lookin at you Claudette).
---
ps4?
---
Went in with plunderers and the fucking killer used a cut coin.
---
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÆAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH**
---
When I use bt nobody body blocks so I farm myself
---
I guess but noed activates in endgame regardless of how many survivors are left. Even one.
---
Let's actually test it and settle this once and for all
---
Pretty sure this the movie costume.
---
If im in the vicinity somewhat am I a camper?
---
Its fine, it just felt a little lackluster, considering this is one of the few survivng scary games and yet didnt get jack shit for sales. But we got Rage 2 for half off! woo!/s
---
Saying damn I got gamered on when you lose.
---
Dbd wiki
---
That's why they're testing them lmao.
---
PC im waiting 45 min to get into a game as killer.
---
Run a basement build and get super fucking lucky
---
judith also decreases movement speed
---
All licensed Killers you don't own, but the splinters are kind of obnoxiously high rarity, and you play as the character without even their 3 base perks.
---
For Killer, yes. For Survivor, only in SWFs.
---
Like nurse is weak lol
---
you can escape by learning to not rely on perks.
---
Got it!  Thank you!  Wasn't sure if it would automatically move me up to Tier 2 with new challenges, etc
---
Isn’t t(e recap literally a few paragraphs of dialogue?
---
Every skull is the same when in reality...
---
they make discounts all the time
---
just before 1 week ps plus had a huge discount of - 60% to all the dlcs
---
i advise you NOT to but any dlc but if u still want to to buy just wait few weeks i am sure there will be in discount again
---
this apply to all plattforms,they do discounts to all from time to time just wait
---
If you're spending money, get Pig because the others you can get with shards.
---
Oh so a you could through over 100 blood webs rare or not that rare?
---
I like her wave hair better than the center-part, makes her look cuter
---
You say you "know" she wasn't a baby because she had the blight cosmetic? You realize anyone could just start up the game and buy those right?
---
I haven’t noticed a difference at all. I had a match where multiple survivors had a chest search challenge and it was a totally normal game. And people should be doing totems anyway.
---
I swear, you all complaining are complaining about the exact same things you have been complaining about for years regarding survivor but now it’s magically because of the rift. It’s ridiculous
---
If they can’t loop a billy for more than 30 seconds, they’re having issues, same with the other two. But especially billy.

---
It's hard to track bones/how many bones are done if playing solo, idk if I'd call not doing them "playing poorly". Also, its not like survivors know killer has noed or not, so suevivors always doing bones is more often than not a waste. 
---
Tldr LUL at thinking noed activating is survivors playing poorly.
---
Otzdarva (YouTube name: not otzdarva) is the one of the best if you want to play killer better. However you can learn some survivor tricks along the way.
---
Tru3ta1ent is a lot more serious when it comes to dbd, but is a pro for both killer and survivor. 
---
These are my opinions and I'm sure you will find other people to watch as well!
---
Not the point of the paragraph but alright
---
Those "fragmented sentences" are just for dramatic effect. Get over it.
---
I think it’s tinkerer. When a gen hits 85% done, the killer gets a notif and their terror radius goes to 0 for 12 seconds
---
Gay
---
This is gonna be very hard but I think I'm gonna try Hillbilly or Spirit with Iron grasp and Agitation and bring the survivors to the basement on their last hook
---
Cosplay: 100
---
whoa, this is very amazing do you plan on making more of different killers?  Would love to see more of them from you UwU
---
how a game is totally normal when all survivors looking for chests or totems
---
Holy shit, this has been posted a billion times already.
---
Experiencing this all morning on ps4. When I have been getting games they’re laggy af.
---
Is that for higher ranks? Im having pretty quick queues from rank 15, killer queue at rank 20 tho takes half an hour.
---
Nope PC
---
The entity has deemed you unworthy
---
The haloween sale on xbox was trash to be fair. dollar off the cheapest DLC already? yay, lets drop the total price from 113 to 110.
---
I understand the pricing, just dissapointed at the sheer amount of cash it costs to buy stuff.
---
Well, if you're missing all 3 of one of your choices' perks, I'd say buy Pig and save up for that one, just going by efficiency.
---
What's the deal with the bloodhunt why are people like this on double bp
---
For the PS4 users they claim it's the PlayStation network (even in countries not affected), if PC has the same issues I guess they're bullshitting again...
---
I think the worst is when it’s a Trapper without Ruin... you know 3/4 gens are gonna get done then it’s all gonna go pear shaped real quick.
---
Nurse is still S tier
---
That's the issue, though. I don't mind challenges if they help the game along, but actively making survivors not do the objective in a game where every second counts and doing the objective should your main priority? I mean cmon. It leads to those of us who join a game, try to get three chests, and if you dont, you basically just give up because you've already wasted too much time to escape. Depending on the killer of course, and how good your teammates do while you're fucking about opening chests
---
Yeah its pretty stupid.
---
Let me give you the abridged version:
---
If the Survivors wouldn't benefit from it, it's against the rules.
---
So just use the bright settings and manually darken the game?
---
Yeah, i run Leader, Open Handed, Detective's Hunch, and Better Together.  
---
Open Handed stacks with BT and they can see your Gen from farther away. OH also really helps with DH. Add in a map, and you'll know where every totem is every match!
---
I got lucky getting this on the first try last night
---
Yeah, this is the issue. If the master challenges weren't "you have to do this all in one trial" then I think we wouldn't focus on it as much.
---
Have you played on dedicated servers as SURVIVOR? Cuz pretty much everytthing that balanced the game for survivors is now useless and you just die
---
6'2 and dressed in that? I wouldve shit my pants seeing you in the dark
---
It cannot be Tinkerer, the TR disappears at 0:12 and you can hear it again at 0:17
---
It's barely 5 seconds
---
Does this mean that generic perks are all teachables from people not in the game for us?
---
I think they're going for fragmented sentences on purpose. We're reading the Observers notes, so it makes sense to be fragmented. I don't mind it.
---
What does bother me is when the notes conflict for the sake of sounding cool, or when they repeat the same point. It's annoying, and bad writing. It bothers me when they repeat the same point, it's annoying, and bad writing.

Hunger 1: "He caused a lot of suffering, but he doesn't feel remorse. He doesn't know if he should feel remorse. He doesn't feel anything other than an ache in the pit of his stomach for power."
---
Hunger 2: "He doesn't want to be snatched up for another trial. To suffer or cause of suffering. And to what end? The great horrible mystery of it all. He wants to understand it. He does." *(I thought he didn't feel remorse,  I thought he only wanted power, now he wants to preserve himself, and NOT cause suffering, and to understand the point of the trials?)*
---
"He doesn't want to be pulled into another trial. He wants to go home." *(he said said this already)*
---
Fuck yeah, I would LOVE to see candyman in this.
---
Tell the truth I have no idea. It brings out the worst in killers for some reason. On top of that you can add archives to being a big reason. And that goes for survivors and killers. Every match as soon as someone is down everyone flocks to get their safe unhook points +and challenges they may have. It will pass when the 2Xp goes away
---
Try Hybridpanda hes got a weekly video called shrine watch that explains the perks on the shine of secrets, he then plays a game as survivor and killer using those perks.
---
Doesn't help me if those people *don't* bring a purple coin, which 90% of the ones  I've been matched up with haven't. Everybody loots the chest immediately by their spawn, and then there arent enough for me to do my "3 in one trial" one.
---
No word.
---
I feel called out
---
I’ve never had a problem with the current system honestly, but everyone wanted dedi servs so here they are.
---
Playing lower tier killers usually means being an m1 killer with powers that don't help in chase, so playing them usually correlates with getting better at chasing without any power, (doesnt always happen, some players dont learn) and learning to chase effectively without any power helps you while playing any killer.
---
So basically, playing bad killers can potentially correlate to being a better killer, but it's not a guarantee.
---
Source: me playing old pre buff freddy a lot
---
The flashlight is an incredibly useless item if the killer plays around it correctly. To an extent where good killers *like* to see flashlights in their lobbies because they can use survivors trying to get flashlight saves to get easier wins, with those survivors often trailing chases being useless not doing gens, and then either having no chance to get the save because the killer simply looks at a wall or into a different direction, failing the save even if they get an opportunity to make it happen because most survivors are not good, or getting snowballed because they die trying to make saves happen.
---
The only real use flashlights have these days against competent killers is blinding them while they are locked into animations, to try and lose them for a moment for more distance or to lose them entirely. And not even that is reliable enough to be "incredible", because killers can track you with sound.
---
Well, that, and destroying Hag traps.
---
The flashlight is not a bad item per se, but it is incredibly limited in utility these days, and that people still use "purple flashlight" as the go-to "toxic!" survivor thing is pretty funny. What's more "funny" is that the Ebony here is stronger than everything else in this graphic combined. Dead Hard is kinda dead on dedicated servers. Decisive Strike is completely useless against an Ebony. Adrenalines will rarely proc in an Ebony game.
---
Literally not helpful at all. The challenge MAKES you use Plunderers. Using Plunderers does not make other survivors not grab chests for their challenge too.
---

---
Will we even get extra rift time?
---
Having played my fair share of clown, I'd say viability 1/3. Without Ruin, you will get stomped if survivors know how to loop. The gas just doesn't do enough unless you're using the insta down down
---
I'd rank him 1.5/3 for perks: Pop is one of the best out there and Bamboozle is at least useful (Coulrophobia is trash though)
---
Dude must of been under a rock all his life
---
Oh boi,i love it. Now i need to belive.
---
Probably. I'm sure they'll do something for the delay.
---
cool, I guess
---
Fair point, the challenge is bs but it's just about racing other survs to the chests. It's a crappy challenge tbh.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
A shark? How would a shark work?
---
just don’t lose 4head
---
Wish that game wasnt dead man :( I actually enjoyed it alot. Refreshing when you keep getting spirits every game and needed a break.
---
Just keep at it. I got it done on my first try. Or just wait some days. There's like 60 days left to get it done
---
https://twitter.com/leaksbydaylight/status/1190314792847892480?s=19
---
No, I have never before the Rift seen a game where survivors actively ignore gens to get chests, and when they finish the challenge or there aren't enough chests, they quit or let themselves die.
---
Yes, obviously some people are the exception. Just because you haven't seen this happen, doesn't mean it isn't a thing.
---
Level 2 comes out on ~~Wednesday~~ Tuesday!
---
Maybe they’d be the minimum rank for whatever their rank color was. So like if you were rank 1 demo, you’d be a rank 4 nurse. Or rank 10 bubba, rank 12 billy.
---
Damn, hope so. BHVR not talking about it anywhere makes it worse
---
I think it’s cause OP was considered to be in a chase though when the Spirit came to the gen. 5 seconds is like half the time of Tinkerer so it could be that she spent the first half of it traveling to the gen. Idk what else could abruptly get rid of her TR, plus the gen was almost complete so it fits
---
Experience doesn't equal skill. Just what are you smoking?  
---
Look at any multiplayer competitive videogame ever. You've got people sinking thousands of hours into the game while only playing the game casually. Without actually putting effort into getting better &amp; learning the game, playtime means jackshit.
---
Just a little bit about XP though, it’s not based on how well you do, it’s based on how long the game is, on both sides. After a certain amount of time (I think it’s 9 minutes) you stop earning XP in that game, no matter if you’re playing Survivor and just Urban Evaded around the map all game or if you’ve done 3 gens and 3 unhooks, you’ll still get the same amount if you’re in game for the same amount of time.

Make it so you can spend 400+ iridescent shards to buy perks that can appear on the bloodweb of that character.

Charms are the DBD equivalent to the throwable stickers Fortnite uses in their battlepass. Just filler
---
hyperbole
---
When your character kinda stutters and suddenly you're speed walking. Lol

Are you factoring in daily exp? Because that's actually a pretty massive contributor.
---
Have you seen the new Julie cosmetics?She is looking THICC
---
Well, they did give an update a few days ago during the live stream.  
---
I get how frustrating it is though.
---
And this is why we wait to buy a battle pass until we figure out the grind. I expected it to be a little better than this.
---
***You Have Alerted The Horde***
---
It’s not just killers it’s everybody. I’ve never had so many mean messages on Xbox as I did yesterday. I don’t camp or tunnel or bad behavior people so I don’t get a lot of toxicity generally. Yesterday it was all day bad messages though. :(
---
This is completely untrue
---
Very important, 5 sets of memento mori !
---
Yeah chill 🤣
---
Yeah but still like they haven’t said anything after that
---
Laughs in chainsaw.
---
You're applying spine chill to a chase situation. It doesn't help much in a chase bud. If you're having this much trouble you need to run spine chill / premonition so you can AVOID spirit
---
Nurse nerfs needed to happen, shes still the best killer in the game shes just got some more counterplay now and limitations on her power
---
I too,when i swing a knife at my target and miss,throw a tantrum.
---
I did this first game, but to be sure I kept running against other crowds and kept counting till I reached something like 28
---
For a build slightly more suited for survivor, swap out Open Handed for an exhaustion perk or Borrowed or Adrenaline and then swap Better Together/Leader with Inner Strength. 
---
I run Iron Will, Detecive's and Inner Strength on my Jane and love. I can be flexible on the fourth depending on how bad I want to survive.
---
I have seen killers levitate a lot on PC but if the game is able to run better on PC than console man would I wish for them to optimize Xbox/PS4 whenever those 3 core problems pop up it really takes me out of the game.
---
I'll even buy auric cells and killers if BHVR rolls out optimization improvements on console.
---
Exactly. People keep saying "yOu AlL aRe jUsT CoMpLaInInG aBoUt tHe saMe tHiNgs sInCe DaY oNe" but in reality the quest just sucks and there are better ones they could have thought of.
---
Cool, again, no one on the internet owes you shit. You post something even in the most private conversations and it gets leaked, it's still 100% on you for posting it on the first place. World doesn't revolve around you or anyone else, sweetheart.
---
It can help in a chase. Besides they are bitching about prayer beads which doesn't help in a chase.  Spirit can't mind game you at loops near as well when you are running spine chill bud.
---
Yeah sure, just give me a few thousand hours and it'll be a piece of cake!
---
op killers? i think you mean strong killers with addons that push them to being broken.
---
Yeah! It's held with a thin steel wire (the thickest I had available actually 😅)
---
Oh my god he played an actual lore leatherface &lt;3
---
I have to do this one day. Leatherface is one of my favorite Slashers and it makes sense lorewise to protect the basement. 
---
Unless you get “blanking on name” with the house towards the bottom of the map.
---
Oh, did they change it?  I thought it was supposed to be the 5th, maybe I looked at an old date.
---
The killer loadout counter every perk from the survivors in the image.
---
Don’t mess with the sawyers mate.
---
God help survivors the first week tome 4 is out its gunna be basement bubbas and noed every match
---
What a strangely paranoid theory
---
Yeah me and some other guy did, and the other guy got hooked right away so I was able to take the chests I needed and then go help him. 
---
If there isn't something horribly wrong with what I just said, you probably won't ever understand why the rift is terrible in some ways.
---
Nurse is actually still really good
---
So long as you know the basics, you'll only get cucked by the classic 4 man swfs who sweat their balls off, other than that you'll be fine
---
Play loads.
---
It’s cool on a few, but nearly every single one gets annoying
---
Well I'm glad you got it done. But I was saying you got time because any time a game introduce a challenge like these, people flock to them at the start and sometimes the end. So waiting it out a few days makes it much less painful.
---
It tells you if she is coming for you with prayer beads. Use iron will  and spine chill for an anti spirit build. Maybe add in quick and quiet and dance with me to really screw her over when phasing. Your injured noises are quiet, you know when she's looking at you, you can silently vault and don't leave scratch marks for 3 seconds after vaulting.
---
I just was in a game with 3 players using self care, at rank 2, against legion. The game lasted like 15 minutes and three gens got done, because my teammates spent 2/3 of the game self caring in a corner. We could have gotten 8 gens done in the time that they healed themself.
---
Only one mistake the hannibal this game needs is the hannibal of hannibal, mads mikkelsen would be much better option  than anthony hopkins
---
If they fuck around trying to bully her and its a very good nurse she can but if they just play optimally theres no chance
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
everyday is leg day, monday, tuesday wednesday !
---
Its just bullshit that stridor counters iron will when iron will literally only has one purpose while if it worked the other way around stridor would still get value unless all 4 had iron. Also the things you say ab knowing when shes phasing and hearing her footsteps, yea knowing her location doesnt mean dick if shes just gonna walk at you anyway because ur loud af. 1) Stridor definitely should not counter iron will 2) she shouldnt be able to hear survivors. If these changes are ever made i say let her keep beads
---
Okay.  I see it now!  Kinda.  🧐
---
Hope y'all had a good time and you weren't teabagged too badly.  Did you make a bear trap too or is that for next year?
---
They made Julie THICC in her new outfit. They really gave her curves lol the dev team is nasty for that one lmao.
---
BT is extremely strong, DS is just a really good way to not get tunneled. One’s power level isn’t dependent on the other’s.
---
ok boomer. you’re a male gamer and that’s way worse as you’re disrespecting a young woman’s privacy. you have no right to have this photo and you clearly don’t give a shit about natalia because she didn’t want it posted and you spreading it around is fucked up. this picture wasn’t for you. i’m very concerned about natalia’s safety and the fact that you’re keeping it up is a very asshole move. old ass gamer dudes are trash.

After her childhood? It’s what she deserves.

Its bad i just stopped playing.

does it count if you close the hatch after the last guy's hooked but not dead? I felt so bad for the kate and it didn't even count ;;
---
I love ghost face so much!! Thank you for this amazing art!!

Thats The Spirit
---
Wdym? You really tellin me that the killer being able to hit me with their weapon isn't a broken mechanic????
---
Whatever man, you do you.
---
Just for reference, a demo portal is 8.9 meters, so you can see how much extra distance Open Handed is giving you.
---
Make me 👀
---
The shrine is a waste IMO, except for Licensed perks, and I already have BBQ. I want a Killer because I want something that significantly alters gameplay.
---
The base Survivors have a lot of good perks, anyway. I don't want DS.

This guy doesn’t know what Freddy does when his back is turned
---
Where... Where does it start?
---
He’s there but always in the deep wound status
---
That's the problem of the Iron Will and Stridor, not Spirit's. Once again, she can be defeated, but it takes more skill and coordination, unless she uses op addons
---
At least they made Julie THICC, they increased her boob size and her butt size. Looks like Susie has some competition now lol.
---
Her addons needed reworking for sure, but the cooldown seems a bit excessive if it still recharged while charging a blink I wouldn't have too much on an issue with it, but having to wait 3 seconds between blink cycles without charging is massive.
---
i never posted it, this account did. this is natalia’s privacy and i asked nicely for them to delete the photo. now they’re spreading it, and without natalia’s consent. that’s really fucked up and you clearly don’t give a shit about young women

Groovy
---
My gf had that idea to make a trap but time wasn't by my side, all I can is that it was the creepiest costume of the party every one said 😜
---
Next year I'll take that to the next level 👍
---
BT turns being farmed into a normal chase, unless the Killer is accounting for it, or Freddy, or just slow enough to run out the 15s by chance. It only really counters greed or incompetence from the user, and the deep wound status still wastes time.
---
It's Nov 5...
---
Just here to say, Hex:Ruin really isn't sweaty. I used to not use it because I felt the same but after enough rank 1 games of survivors with toolboxes, BNPs and insta heals I went back to using ruin in a lot of my builds. In the games where it doesn't get found instantly, it does just enough to slow gens a little bit more and relieve some of the pressure you're under as killer. The only killer perks that I consider sweaty/toxic at all are NOED, Rancor, Insidious and to an extent Make Your Choice and Thrill of the Hunt. Perks like Ruin and PGTW are necessities to slow the game.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yes. Exactly this. That’s my problem. There’s no emphasis or pausing for dramatic effect. Did anyone give him direction?
---
Funny enough I actually play better with new nurse. Before I was just blinking non stop. Now I make sure to make my blinks count. Monitor and abuse and them get close enough to a gen to blink to it and it's almost always a hit or gen grab.
---
I don't think he does.
---
I’d rather have good taste and be a good human being, respectable and shit than to have a sense of humor that degraded a group of people that didn’t chose to be the way they are. It’s not funny to use it as an insult. Because it’s nothing to be insulted about
---
Ive played ALOT of console nurse and ive gotta say the thing that made me hang up my blink is just how often you get cucked by dead zones and shit auto aim. Imo thats way worse than the sensitivity issue but its also probably a harder fix.
---
Yeah. This would be helpful if idk... A Reddit post didn't catch the attention and the people on Reddit didn't say anything. But it did. And the issue is cleared up. You'll get them next time.
---
You guys look great! Hope you had a fun Halloween. :)
---
Not on dedicated servers, but it's good to know the game is apparently balanced around lag.
---
I would recommend hag, not for her perks but for her. She's probably the best of that lot besides Spirit and has add ons that you can switch around her play style with, keeping he fresh. She can be especially devastating in claustrophobic maps like the game, lerys and Hawkins. Clown would be my next choice, he's fun and effective. He will still get  run around by good groups but in this list he's one of the best and pop goes the weasel is probably the best perk available from this list. Spirit is still 2 tiers above hag though. Even when she is nerfed, if it is anything like the nurse nerf, she will still be top tier. I don't play her because I hate playing against her. She's not unbeatable, but counterplay to her is pretty much either stealth gen rushing which is extremely hard without comms or taking lots of  good guesses in chase which is pretty shitty design in practice, especially with prayer beads.
---
At red ranks most of the people dont run self care anyways but second chance perks and do gens fast, healing with others. Self care is on almost 100% of survivors in purple ranks and below tho
---
Only way you can level up the Rift is playing, because there aren't any challenges

I love how killing everyone by skill nets you little to no pips but camping nets you pips easily.

All of those are countered by Stridor, and headphones, anyway. A spirit faking her phase is super uncommon outside of meming, so good luck.
---
As someone who is a trash tier huntress player but just played iri head &amp; infantry belt for the first time (ps4 btw) that combo is a god damn joke, talk about ezzz mode
---
get some leaks ;)
---
love bugs !
---
Or the fact that DEFINITELY DOUBLE PTSD Bill doesnt have any weapons on him? What did he have to go through customs to get to this abandoned meat packing facility or something? lol fuck outta here Bills got more weapons on him than nipples.
---
Costume looks dope! Whats dangling around you looks like weird burnt dolls?
---
Why PWYF?
---
I'm wondering if single blinking is better to move around now, just so you always have that second blink charge ready.
---
Yikes, if they do I’m sure gonna fight for a refund
---
Hope &gt; Adrenaline
---
7% speed  boost for 120 seconds or 50% for 5 seconds? I won’t factor in health state heal since noed exists.
---
I mean, people here bitch about everything. Legion is a pretty good killer, and no where near as bad as they make it out be.  
---
In the end, get whatever you think you'll enjoy. There's really no need for the opinion of others.
---
I was 10 in killer and survivor. But i haven't been playing so rank 16 in both. But i have never had to wait this long.
---
Imagine thinking a joke makes you a bad human being
---
It's the actual banner for the cosmetic coming out.
---
lmao the fact that you just called her “female” just proves you’re the most stereotypical old male gamer out there. SHES A HUMAN BEING. she doesn’t deserve to have her privacy violated. she’s a very private and shy person and this would really upset her knowing you people are spreading private photos of her around
---
Well, I never intended to sweatlord with Prayer Beads. Those were poorly designed anyway, since all they do is remove a balance mechanic. If I knew exactly what their plans for Spirit were, I could make the decision right now.
---
Doctor was actually the original character I was looking at before hearing he was awful, but he's apparently also a bastion of sadism and I'm not sure I want to risk making the game even more toxic. Again, I wish I knew WHAT was planned for him. If he got Sniper implicitly, I'd be all over him.
---
I'm surprised at how many people are fond of Legion. Maybe the next 9000 I gather, they'll have been buffed or reworked by and I can consider them, but they look frustrating to play currently and I haven't heard anything about an incoming buff.
---
Thanks for your input. BTW, can you get event items for characters you don't own? I want that Clown face, but I can wait on having the actual Clown.
---
They really need to give an addition shard per challenge as the level increases since the difficulty of each challenge increases.
---
Jane does, so why not them?
---
HAYATO
---
Just dodge and do literally anything else while waiting
---
Nurse isn’t top killer anymore.
---
Use Iron Will so you have counterplay against her when injured.  Replace that trash ass Self Care with it lol.  You'll be better against Spirits and a better teammate in general.
---
Yeah but I only have the weekends to really play this. I work all the time during the week. So I have to play when I can.
---
I'm not aware of a daily XP bonus, any info you can provide? how much of a bonus is that?
---
edit: maybe i can figure out what the daily bonus is tomorrow assuming there is one, didn't see anything the last few days.
---
So many people did not get the joke...
---
Noo, then the entity wins! I've had some crappy killers this blood hunt but there are some good ones prowling around right now too. Survivors too but they have a harder time ruining your game, besides just escaping and spamming crouch.
---
This is surprisingly true
---
They're dolls that I burned
---
This is me
---
Granted, but i've seen posts on some horror pages i follow on face book and saw a post I thought would fit here. All I got was hate from people cause they had seen it before. Now i think people should leave credit for OP, but nonetheless its a harmless mistake.
---
Woohoo, I'm more than halfway done!  
---
It really just depends on how much time you devote to DbD, play a lot? You'll get a lot of progress. Play every now and then? You probably won't finish.
---
That was one of the funner challenges.
---

[I think you're right.](https://twitter.com/leaksbydaylight/status/1185304097387438080/photo/1), but the 5th is tuesday.
---
&gt;LUUUUUUUUWIS!!!!!
---
FTFY
---
Okay what is up with ya all the spirit? Leave my girl alone. I dont even get preayer beads that often nor do i use them that often. She is no nurse snd Billy/Myers are still better than her. Y'all just getting.mind gamed.
---
I think they should make it so you can complete any rift challenge at any time instead of one challenge per game. Since it makes people tunnel on whatever challenge they are on and not actually play the game.
---
Replace the flashlight with a key and it'd be more accurate to my last 5 killer games tbh.
---
Miss me with that homophobia bruh
---
Leave it to this community to get butthurt over that lmao. Shitty killers and shitty survivors with such heartfelt opinions
---
that system sounds even worse especially with a max amount of time per game. If there is really a max then the best way would be to play survivor (shorter queue) and just let yourself get caught after the max time... Maybe it's not as bad then but I don't really want to minmax my time playing the game just to be able to complete the battle pass. With the really low XP we currently get I'd have to do that though...
---
I like the flavor of the perk, it makes me feel cool but it's admittedly not very good so you should probably replace it with something else
---
Any ideas as to what else?
---
The writing is cheesy but the voice actor made it worse. He's not bad, just needs to use context for emphasis and better cadence. It was like he read the lines for the first time for these recordings.
---
what a cool idea loll
---
Stares deeply at all the spirit hate on this shh reddit
---
Except for event items.
---
It's not a bad perk, due to still being able to be used it for distance, which is indeed very effective, but it has also lost a good chunk of its utility, since the more fancy things you can do with it are highly unreliable now, when they already weren't very reliable on P2P. I hope this will be remedied with changes to hit authority in the future...
---
For the time being however, I have a hard time justifying using Dead Hard over much of any other Exhaustion perk.
---
And you have 60+ days. Plenty people have your schedule or busier and still finish games.
---
Fun fact: teabagging can also mean thank you.
---
Nurse's Calling hard counters healing period. I'd rather get caught Self-Healing than have myself AND another survivor get caught.
---
Soooo, how'd it goooo? 😅
---
Autodidact doesn’t allow medkits because all aspects of the perk are more effective the slower you heal, the more seconds it takes the more chance for skill checks and the more time each skill check saves, autodidact is more of an anti-debuff perk compared to botany knowledge for example. Using a medkit with autodidact would make the perk less useful.
---
Pathetic infant killers on PS4 can force close the app from the dashboard and steal everything from survivors.  Had it happened 3 times in one session couple days back.  DC's are a massive issue for both sides but this is the grossest version of it since nobody gets anything and all items and addons are lost.
---
You're correct!  Not sure why I thought it was Wednesday, lol...either way, definitely looking forward to new levels to unlock, although I hope they change some of the Tier 4 challenges cuz yikes.
---
You forgot José, Jesús, Antonio, Pedro, Carlos, and Juan.
---
I'm not butthurt, that just a silly thing to say. Playing this game, you will get hooked and camped on occasion and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
NOED doesn't need explaining. It lets a killer win without actually being any good at the game. 
---
Rancor is just a NOED without any counter but only has 1 use. It means you can ignore your obsession all game because you can just instantly kill them at the end of the game. It's just cheap. I can understand using it if you have a mori daily, but it's not like moris are hard to come by on the bloodweb, though I suppose survivors are less likely to DC early if you use rancor instead of a Mori.
---
Insidious is generally only used for camping. Occasionally someone might use it for jumpscares but 99% of the time it's a camping perk.
---
Make Your Choice and Thrill of the Hunt aren't as bad, but still kind of lame imo. Make Your Choice gives killers an excuse to always go back to the hook after an unhook, which means there's a pretty good chance that the unhooked survivor who hasn't been healed yet will be found, because they're making grunts of pain. Constantly going back to the hook to either down an exposed survivor or a recently unhooked survivor is not skilful play and isn't fun either. 
---
Thrill of the Hunt isn't that bad really, and I use it when I'm doing a full totem build. I mostly have a gripe against it because I play only solo survivor and even at rank one it feels like 50% of my teammates won't just power through Ruin and will go look for the totem. Then they won't even give up on the totem when they see the killer has TOTH and gens don't get done because they're trying to cleanse a totem that alerts the killer. It's just a perk that makes me hate other survivors even more.
---
You can get the event items for characters you don't own, and they'll be usable when you acquire them. 
---
Understand that no matter what you play, survivors will think it's toxic. And the main goal is for you to have fun, not them. So play what makes you happy. And I do say this as a guy who plays both sides. 
---
I doubt BHVR will buff/rework Legion anytime soon... He was a nightmare on release, and I'm sure they don't want to relive it ever again. That's why they gutted him so hard. He's still fun though, and not half bad. Just run a regular M1 killer build and he's not *as* frustrating.
---
I know, just sad. If you have to explain the joke, it sucks, so i guess it's my fault.
---
You hardly ever see it because most people run BBQ for the bloodpoints. A lot of people also underestimate Thrilling Tremors because they mistakenly think it’s a stall perk.  If you don’t need/want the extra BP Thrilling Tremors is better than BBQ. Corrupt isn’t there because I put Ruin and you generally don’t need to run both. And yes, I know sloppy isn’t great on killers with insta downs, which is why I said it’s hard to give a definitive meta build for all killers because all killers are unique and have their own meta build. But if I were to give a 4 perk build that can be effective on basically every killer, it would be the one I posted.
---
I'm at tier 20 as of the moment, I would've played more during the PTB if I knew the progress was going to transfer over to the live build. I usually have enough time to play every day for a few hours, so I might be able to max out before it closes. I just want that sweet huntress axe.
---
Hence my advice 🧐 lol I didn't mean you just came back to see I'm getting downvoted. Like ok... Dead ass being good at this game means it takes a lot to hook you. By all means take it how you want. If means don't get in chases and not saving people. Sure, if it'll stop you from leaving a match salty
---
I actually LOL'd at the bunnies antics! XD
---
Had a game today with both david and Jane teabagging at the gate

There's is bug going on where it can show the wrong rank

The problem I have with Fnaf is that to me personally, the games have never really been a pillar of horror. FNaF didn't revitalize the genre of Horror Games, Amnesia did, and FNaF has always been a "Do you get stressed? Then spooks!" type deal rather than true scares.
---
I mean, I wouldn't be adverse to a FNAF DLC, but I also wouldn't look forward to a fnAf DLC either. I'd probably still buy it if the perks were good though.
---
Ebony Mori could be second hook but then it makes no sense for it to be ultra rare. It needs more restrictions, point blank.
---
Iri heads need to only one-shot when landing from over a set distance. No point-blank hatchet should ever one-shot, nor does it take much skill to land generally speaking.
---
jesus
---
this game is actually garbage
---
Wait what lol
---
This has been in the game for a long time to be fair still not fixed :/
---
I have tested this as have a number of youtubers in the community, the other guy is right though it’s a rather minuscule difference.
---
Don't run monitor and abuse BHVR just made it that tier 1 myres already has no terror radius
---
Michael Myers, on the main stage you... had a leg up on the competition, but your Jumpsuit Jumpscare runway was... shapeless... You're safe
---
low amp is actually better than yellow battery if you want more saves ;)
---
Trade self care for Iron will
---
Well,yes,  thats right,  but i still don't see how would someone hit the Nurse objectively Speaking,  Legión its a bunch of edgy Teens, so that with a bat (a larger weapon than the knife they use) it would be kind of easy, Freddy as long as you're not asleep or you dont fear him ( if i remember the movies well) he can barely touch you, Amanda its just a human with a shorter weapon than Legion, the only way i see that someone can beat the nurse would be when in his stunt after a failed Blink , i Said that The Huntress would be a Fair Fight more in the matter that Would be  Human Vs Human and not Human Vs Ghost or supernatural Being
---
Plague and doc are cool if you’re into them.
---
You could pull the wild card and save 10k and 1 mil BP for the next chapter and insta level 50 them.
---
Springtrap's design matches perfectly with DbD already. I don't know what his power or perks would be, but aesthetically he's the best choice out of the franchise.
---
They were opening hatch for teammate if it was a swf
---
Friendship with Susie ended now Julie is my best friend.
---
Yeah, NOED is just a crutch. I guess I don't consider something officially "sweaty" unless it's an aggressive act instead of a fallback, though.
---
I certainly want Rancor for the Mori dailies. For someone like Wraith, who I've barely levelled, I could run out of offerings before I manage a kill. But I seem to draw supernaturally toxic people when I play Wraith.
---
Camping is a BAD play, though. Can you be sweaty while also doing something stupid? That's sort of the same question I have around NOED, which is an empty perk slot until you've almost lost.
---
Make Your Choice is pretty free, but it's hardly different from something like DS. Plus or minus a hit to get someone on hook. A coordinated team probably won't be threatened by Make your Choice or require BT often, though.
---
Unfortunately, a few perks just turn Survivors against one another. I haven't heard anyone talk about it recently, but Franklin's Demise is similar. Solo life is rough.
---
Ran skill check doctor with iridescent king, brought a mori along as to ensure I got it in one game. All 4 disconnected and I still completed it. Thanks BHVR for realising that people suck and will try anything to prevent others from completing challenges. Just hope that those who disconnect during Tome 4 will count towards basement sacrifices.
---
Hey not bad for off brand! They look awesome!
---
Don't run M&amp;A
---
I haven’t had any, instead its PB spirit every second match lmao
---
Isn’t the rift based on xp which is based on time played?  I’m getting all these things confused.
---
God, i hate having Blendettes as teammates. It's annoying when they get downed first and DC.
---
Looked like a salty dc to me
---
I don’t think he understands what over performing means in this context
---
lego bricks as a usable item would actually be kinda cool. like, you get four usages, you drop it on the ground and whoever walks after you gets stunned for a short while and their speed is reduced for a couple seconds
---
Thinking of doing the Halloween cosmetic?  If you're a fan of the Doctor as well do that one instead because jeebus that's a scary mofo.  😱
---
The only thing i think needs fixing is hit detections. So many times where I'm already on the other side of the window and the killer still hits me :(
---
The more challenges and BP the better
---
*Object of Obsession intensifies*
---
Ok boomer
---
You definitely get better at both roles by playing the other, just by virtue of having a better understanding of what the other side is focusing on.
---
I’m a survivor main, and at first I always trashed killer daily rituals.  Eventually I started switching to killer, completing the rituals, then going back to survivor (rather than trashing them).  Even with only playing killer with specific goals in mind (and not spending any BP to level them up since I’m still working on my survivor levels), I’ve had a massive improvement in both sides of the game since doing this.
---
You get a better sense of map awareness because it’s easier to predict what killers are doing, you get better at hiking and escaping chases because you’re familiar with the killer’s FoV/range/scratch marks/audio cues/priorities.  Often “knowing” how something works doesn’t help with “understanding” what it’s actually like on the other side of the fence.
---
I 100% agree with this. If someones farms their teammate Imma kill them first.
---
Thx for the back upp bro 😘
---
There's no particular reason for choosing Legion over any of the killers you mentioned. In fact, they're just objectively so much better than him. Most people (including me) play them because they like their edgy theme and their cosmetics are fire. Also, nothing compares to chaining 4 stabs and spreading deep wounds on the entire survivor team.
---
I haven't played Plague, but as far as I'm aware, she's just pretty underpowered.
---
I had a group bring in 3 purple coins.  I let them do their thing, but was insidious camping the basement with Santa clown.  They never came down to play. :(
---
* Screenshots highlighting common UI bugs and/or glitches, e.g. bugged Devotion EXP gain, massive amount of negative bloodpoints, not being able to escape, ... .

So a total of 15k max if everyone puts a offering then? How about for hooks?

natalia sweetie i am so sorry. i'm so sorry that a ugly ass bitch like this would even post one of your private pictures 😩 why can't y'all just post more videos of steve getting fucked by the demogorgon or whatever it is y'all do to teenaged characters in your little video game. stop harassing natalia and delete this
---
Yas Gia, you ARE the boom boom gun
---
Probably.
---
Like I said, I don't remember who else they were going to look at, I just knew that the Doctor was one of them.
---
Not every game I have has featured toxic nonsense just more than usual. I’ve had a number of good games too.
---
It’s dead already? Isn’t it like.... just a few months old?
---
Scream used a “jagged” edge, like around the feet
---
*heavy breathing intensifies*
---
Next stop: Fully Nude Myers!
---
Most of the top streams are good.  If you’re looking for killer knowledge, fungoose.
---
I feel like people still getting flashbacks even tho if she gets nerfed to the ground by now
---
Same with legion and Freddy for me just annoying 😅
---
I run scratched mirror for jump scare Myers with a boyfriends memo  and I run monitor with it
---
Then you just put them down and kill away

People don't mind being Broken all match vs. Plague?

Oh wow that's pretty lame, I guess I had just assumed that they would be on sale for the same price as the psn store.
---
My bad for not reading properly haha
---
She is
---
OP doesnt get the "Escaped" prompt at any point in this video so hes never on chase.
---
Also AFAIK you dont even hear the heartbeat while being chased with an active tinkerer
---
I'm guessing since no one has said it, no one has noticed it.
---
He's stabbed a GhostFace face into the guy's chest.
---
Why does everybody who calculates this always leave out the over 50 fragments you can get from getting your daily bonus xp? I mean to get the full amount you'd be cutting it pretty close, but it's not an insignificant amount.
---
It depends on what you want:
---
You could use tracking perks, such as Whispers or Discordance. 
---
Spirit Fury I like since Myers is essentially an M1 killer on Tier 2 &amp; 3. You could also remove M&amp;A and use Enduring with Spirit Fury if you just really fucking hate pallets. Bamboozle is also a perk worth running.
---
Well Jumpscare Myers is dependent on a purple add on so you’re not gonna be able to run it every game unless you never take off BBQ and also dump all your BP into Myers. Even then you might not be able to afford it. If you want to play Jumpscare Myers every game just play Ghost Face and ignore the stalking mechanic. 
---
A great build for Myers when you don’t have a Scratched Mirror to play Jumpscare is 
---
Infectious Fright / Monitor and Abuse / Hex: Ruin / Bamboozle
---
You can’t put someone down while pulling out of a locker.
---
Is chasing the survivor for 15+ seconds to potentially slug them the better play?
---
Specifically used for infinite tier 3 tombstone build, as you build up meter you lose chases alot so you can zoom around the map at 130% movement speed in no time and the tombstone makes you not lose stacks.
---
I think that's the problem. You just turn into a Bubba with permanent NOED. Nobody actually cleanses in high rank. So you're just tremendously easy to loop, unlike Doctor/Clown who actually have tools to help shortening thme.
---
Oh ok
---
No, Spirit is.
---
It's just easier to recognize russians/ukrainians/belarushians/bulgarian etc because of the alphabet but there's a lot of countries they come from, it's not only Russia. Toxic players are everywhere.
---
I believe it’s the same the only difference is each event hook can only provide points on it once.
---
the last tome has 5-8 shards per challenge i think
---
Pretty much.  As killer I want to see 4 Self Cares in every lobby.  It's my 5th killer perk for free gen pressure.  God awful perk.  But in my survivor lobbies I dread seeing it on the randoms.  It just means I'm in store for another Iridescent Lightbringer AND Evader game since all they're good for is hiding and hook saves.  Fun little mini game is to count the amount of self cares that were in your lobby when the killer wins on the post game screen.  Seriously guys this perk is putrid.  Stop running it lol!
---
There is no better way to punish a noed killer than to rob them of a single one hit down :)
---
Not a huge deal on flashlights but on med kits, it made a huge difference with syringes and so on.
---
Actually as Jane I typically t-bag my teammates because *thic*
---
Hour and a half here still not in a game. RIP enjoying the event.
---
That's slightly above normal.
---
YES the killer's d is bigger than the survivors'!
---
no, you won't be banned for it
---
i don't know how you were getting as low as 20 fps
---
I got Pig because I'm a fan of the Saw franchise. I do find her to be fun though. Combining her stealth and Surveillance will easily allow you to surprise survivors at generators. If you down the game to 2 survivors, you can very easily predict which generator the rest will be easily with Surveillance. The survivors will be at your mercy at that point.
---
I'm not a fan of Make Your Choice since it encourages camping. The perk only triggers if you're close to the hook unless I'm understanding the description wrong.
---
Her dash attack is good as well once you get used to it.
---
Reverse bear trap stalls the survivors. The trap also has a ticking sound as it gets close to expiration which can help you locate the survivor.
---
Overall, Pig is a fun character IMO.
---
No, they got the gens powered. No one mentions how Adrenaline, DH, and DS all exhaustion perks reward survivors for fucking up and making mistakes. Heaven forbid the killer has a perk that helps him out when Ruin goes down in 2 seconds and 40 pallets spawn on the map.
---
It’s pretty irrelevant for Myers since he is only Undetectable in tier 1 and when you play as Myers you want to be out of tier 1 ASAP. 
---
The only thing that really changed is that you don’t need monitor if you plan to use Scratched Mirror.
---
It is generally faster to hit someone who is injured after waiting out BT than chasing and hitting a full health survivor twice, especially if the one who got saved is overly altruistic and attempts to bodyblock with BT.
---
On the official forum I read they are aware and fixing this issue. Auric cells won't be lost.
---
No it wouldn't. It's rewards for playing the game, and if they wanted to sell more, they'd be wise to let more people complete it so it feels satisfying to buy, rather than punishing people who have jobs and school.
---
Dude, you need a hug
---
Thank you. But it won't matter, top streamers agree she busted. BHVR has the numbers proving these claims. Yet on Reddit, there's this vocal minority who swear everyone else is just ass at the game and counterplay.
---
If it was that simple, someone would've made a comprehensive guide on how to beat her that tips the scales in the survivors' favor (assuming 4 survivors are armed with that knowledge) and no one would be complaining nearly as much. Such thing doesn't exist because it's impossible with the way this game is designed and how Spirit works.
---
It's like trying to make on guide on how to mind game Nurse consistently. There are a finite amount of structures that a map can produce, many any player can memorize them all more or less and that is why Nurse and Spirit are top 2. Once they know what these structures are, they win 99% of the time. Because a survivor only has a finite amount of options and most of the time they're not enough to juke these killers.
---
Really only Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, Iron Will and something like Lithe or BL really helps be on less predictable but again, still map dependent and good killers know what those options are.
---
No survivor is stealthily walking away from a Spirit with Iron Will more than once on anything other than Lery's or Game. For one, blood trails, for two walk speed and map layout let's players predict where other players are. It's like a survivor taking in account bloodlust. Sure you won't have exact numbers or distance, but do it enough times and you'll get the hang of it.
---
Sure, a mediocre Spirit without powerful add-ons isn't a 4k against optimal SWF or even solo players focused on OBJ. But the second they past mediocrity the game is basically a matter of how fast is she going to 4k. That's not fun and it's not because losing isn't fun. 
---
It's the robbing of game design (Nurse and loops) and information (Spirit by just existing) that makes these killers DC worthy. 
---
Que times are long enough as is. I'm not spending even 1 minute playing against broken shit, so a first hook death is how I go against a Spirit (Nurse isn't really seen on console).
---
You just need sharp metal and a high pain tolerance
---
If BHVR don’t make them all individual killers, skins would be nice. The Strangers could be skins for Legion/GhostFace, Xenomorph for DemoGorgon etc...
---
I don't think my team appreciated me taking them to Springwood just so I could harass birds instead of working on gens.
---
I used that challenge as an excuse to run some endgame perks that I normally don't touch, like Freddy's lineup and NOED.  Then you just have to be a bit lazy about patrolling gens, or hope (ha) that you get a good enough SWF to actually open a gate.
---
If im dying your dying with me
---
The first thing Myers should be doing if he’s not using Scratched Mirror is trying to get out of tier 1 ASAP. You can still use monitor if you aren’t playing Jumpscare Myers
---
Holy shit, 2 post 20 seconds apart. 
---
Add them to the pile!
---
I thought about that after the fact but didn't check yet. Thanks for clearing it up.
---
I understand it's a grind but shouldn't the grind be a little more reachable by most of the player base? It doesn't feel very good paying for the pass and the end goal being 3+ hours of gameplay per day and not achieving the goal.
---
Dude why did you mot just dc, I mean don't get me wrong you are completly on the right but damn that ain't worth it.
---
I don;t get it, they made sounds for Pig's trill but they didn;t do anything to make the pipe sound more realistic. I was kinda disappointed when I heard it.
---
Doctor would be a great support for anyone, but particularly Michael. Michael could use the Fragrant tuft and use the bought time to get his permanent T3, then slug Survs for Doctor to carry off.
---
Very nice! Plays like this is why I love the game.
---
Over 70 days it's 42,000 xp, or 52.5 shards. 
---
Also if you're only playing 2-3 games an hour you're either dragging matches out too much or sitting in queues for 30 minutes.
---
This is bull shit.
---
No. :)
---
Farming games are kind of more fun than actual matches a lot of the time.

The “Gimme BBQ and Ruin” button.

Lol @ all the downvotes, acting all high and mighty as if you wouldn't fuck her. You might not like her style or whatever but she's easily good looking at the very least.

Cut your neighbor's lawn and save up to get a PS4 and the game and all the dlcs, it will probably take all of next summer but you will still que up before the lobby you are waiting in on pc. 😁

Eta: killer main on PS4 because of survivor que times. If and when I get it for PC, I'll definitely switch my main role.
---
Bruh, this was posted the other day. Wtf are you doing!?

I wasn’t denying that those perks are good or they didn’t reward the survivors for fucking up, but DS is to counter tunneling, so if you have a problem with it then, maybe you should try to not chase the same survivor off hook, and count in your head. Dead hard is just really good, but counter-able, in most cases. NOED literally helps you, because you fucked up, they shouldn’t have powered them anyways, if you’re good enough.
---
Lmao belle delphine isn’t attractive in the slightest

yes, the black people

Basement trapper might also work.

Doctor and Pig if you could apply those annoying Doctor skill checks to the Jigsaw puzzle skill checks.

I usually never got this bug but it seems its been happening a lot more after this patch. I've had it happen too me as a survivor and a killer. In the past 20 games id say it happened around 4 times.
---
It looks like it happens with Borrowed time because each time the glitch started was after being hit with the endurance status effect on.
---
I got called out for face camping a guy when I had no kills and the exit gates were open. I think it’s pretty fair to get the one kill.
---
PS4
---
Getting shorted 5-7k bloodpoints when I play killer. Haven’t noticed it on survivor yet.
---
Imagine worrying about pips. I celebrate every time I lose pips because there is nothing special about red ranks. You only get longer queue times.

Ok let me stop you there entitled killer main. Let me go into more detail since you missed some big points.
---
1. Endgame is broken because in most cases exit gates are too close to one another which killers are guaranteed to camp both gates until timer runs out.
---
2. You are wrong about safe pallets. Look at the pallets in Badham preschool, Temple, Lery's memorial and Hawkins Lab. These are just a few maps that have ridiculous unsafe pallets that require survivors to consistently drop it to stun killers because if they don't the killer can just go around it easily or bloodlust you. I mean its so unsafe that if you miss the timing on the drop pallet, your character will be stuck in the dropped animation while the killer goes around for the lunge attack.
---
3. By hook placement, I meant that there are too many hooks that it makes it virtually impossible to wiggle out without getting two teammates to take hits for you while you are struggling (that's if you are lucky to have some distance first).
---
4. I would like to know the strategies you have for face camping especially when you face insta down hatchets, chainsaw attacks (LF especially), crouching Pig with RBT, etc.
---
5. Hawkins Lab and Haddonfield have true infinites (yes even with Bloodlust tier 3) if you equip balanced landing. You can get true infinites on 2/3 of the killer cast.
---
I'm not asking for a free escape in every trial. All I did was mention some game mechanics that need to be worked on. So please before you reply put some thought into it next time.
---
Hybrid panda is really fun to watch. He's a character himself and tries ballsy plays which he often fails but when he pulls them off it's great.
---
Thank you for bringing this up, because that’s another problem with the system. There’s literally no incentive at all to be high ranks. It’s fucking stupid
---
calling women “females” is typically used as a sexist pejorative, of which you seem ignorant. your friend shouldn’t have posted this photo to begin with. i wouldn’t be here if your friend didn’t post it. natalia didn’t even post this picture anywhere lol
---
A map with a center basement spawn would definitely make it easier. Such as Mount Ormond.
---
Susie said gay rights! Love the costume.

Lol, I didn't notice but he carved his "face" on the chest of that dude.

I don't have the killers for Infectious Fright and bamboozle if they ever come up on shrine I'll buy it but do you have another build for me I only bought Myers and since I'm on ps4 I think I have 2 dlc that pc players don't have unless they buy it which is doctor and I forgot the other one.
---
I just went 42 levels while leveling up my Spirit without getting it, feelsBadMan
---
It was 20 when running as survivor/playing as killer and 62 when doing generator
---
there is a middle ground obviously
---
Nah just a blendette in a bush
---
I actually do this for fun. Only basement hooks.
---
I use Iron grasp, Agitation, Mad grit, and Monstrous shrine. You can replace monstrous shrine of course, but I think it’s funny.
---
You play normal, but try to lead them near the basement. You can usually get at least half way across the map with this build
---
The Entity Education series by int3r4ct is excellent to learn about each killer in depth.
---
Eta: Otz, Tru3 and Panda as others have mentioned are all top notch. Monto and Noob3 are also very good and play more to entertain than anything. I recommend Paulie Esther tok who covers news and streams also, similar to Hybrid Panda.
---
I wish you best of your luck,may you be able to find it soon enough!
---
Oof i didn’t know
---
If you're a new player, don't be afriad to disconnect if you aren't having fun, its not against the rules :) Good luck!
---
Bamboozle on legion is rly fun. You vault rly fast and anyone trying to juke gets fucked so quick. Something like STBFL or PWYF is fun aswell for extremely efective frenzy.
---
Edit:Typo's
---
Endgame has been broken since the start
---
I will even though I don’t want to
---
There has been 100 posts of this, so yours will probably be removed shortly. Just a heads up.
---
I did that challenge and only got 1 great skillcheck while injured, got the other 2 while healthy and it still was completed. Seems just having the perk equipped is enough.
---
It was introduced to prevent game from being hold hostage. The last survivor can just hide in lockers for 2 hours and without hatch spawning there's nothing a killer can do about it.
---
Itd be a clicking sound, in the movies there’s always some type of clicking when she’s around

I wasn’t salty at all. And maybe he shouldn’t use words like “kiddo” if he wants to make a joke. Or, you know, since this is the internet, maybe make it a little bit more obvious. We have ways of doing that. Using “kiddo” made him look a little bit condescending.
---
I think there should be at least shards in the free rift. There’s a lot of empty spaces shards, or even blood points could go.
---
I cant c ur pic
---
I never thought of that before now and I'm upset.
---
He kind of looks like The Alchemist's animatic but blue
---
The Entity makes all the killers supernautrally powerful. Have you ever tried to shatter a wooden pallet with 2 kicks? It's impossible.
---
I am usually around Rank 7-3 (depending on what killers I main currently, some go better, some worse). I suck dicks at sniping with huntress (tho my precision is pretty good on medium range). I usually rush my first downed to the basement and then rush outside until I am far enough for imperative to trigger. Since people normally don't expect the perk they aren't quick enough with un-hook &amp; leaving the basement before I get there.
---
Most of the time I get 1 downed for the basement and another one hit (if they fuck up or the map is lucky, sometimes both downed). After that it's mostly repeat. By the time the survivor adapted to it I usually have around 5-6 hooks. This probably won't work very well against the top ranks but for me it's enough and I like the different playstyle from time to time.
---
Success is heavily map and basement spawn dependant.
---
Best basement would be killer shack with the door facing the stairs having a mostly free path leading to it (really rare tho, but that is just the best possible spawn).
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Ah ok thx

Really wish bill could just beat the shit out of plague randomly while screaming BOOMER!!!

Did anyone else get the inner eye charm before they completed the final mission?
---
I got really good bloodpoints this game (~70k with offering and bloodhunt) and I didn't want to sacrifice that because of some asshole. I played Minecraft on top of it to kill the time because I was going to be as stubborn as much as he was an asshole.
---
If you’re a fan then respect her privacy and delete the photo. Every other Natalia fan deleted the photo, so you not deleting it means you’re not actually a fan nor do you care about her at all.
---
Like the knife
---
They are totems, they are killer perks you can destroy, this are the 3 most common you'll face:
---
1.- Ruin. if when working on a generator you get shortcircuits when you get a good skill check and a symbol on the right it means there is one of this, look for the lit totem and destroy it.
---
2.- Haunted ground: it is a trap totem, when you cleanse it everyone gets exposed (One hit and you go down even if at full health)
---
3.- No one escapes death (or NOED as usually known) this one appears when the doors are powered either by doing all the gens or when the hatch gets closed. this is a very strong perk that a lot of survivors hate, but as I said it only appears until the end, the way to avoid it is to destroy all the unlit skull plants.
---
Actually if it was also uninjured active, It would be okay against all those ruins
---
Don't buy it, if you don't it.
---
I hope I helped.
---
ok now delete the picture
---
Ah, well stereotyping "old males who play video games" isn't exactly much better fam. Maybe pull your head out of your ass and stop acting high and mighty. Not even my friend either, I don't even know the person who posted it, I'm just telling you how it is and how you're wrong if you think they're in the wrong for sharing the image and keeping it up. And again, if she didn't want it out there, she shouldn't have took the photo at all. It's a risk you knowingly take. And if she didn't want the photo taken, then maybe she needs to surround herself with some better people.
---
I never thought of that, that's ckever
---
He didn‘t changed something, he‘s just saying that it needs a rework
---
That makes no sense
---
Since I main huntress, when I go against one as survivor I usually force them to M1 me down, unless it's asylum. Then you are just fucked.
---
Wow it’s almost like everyone has different opinions whaaaat, attraction is subjective and varies per person? Whaaaaat who would hav thought
---
Fair and balanced add-ons
---
I'm going to get trapper, the Jake head, the spirit sword and something else
---
You have to sweat equally as hard.
---
I'm sorry but there's really no other way.
---
Make the bloodpoint multiplier it’s entire own perk and make the hook-walls mechanic it’s entire own perk.
---
BBQ is clearly overpowered and is fact. If you played DBD you’d realize it’s the most used perk in the entire game
---
I would suggest then docta body
---
I want scissor man and Jennifer from clock tower.
---
Cringe.
---
Yes very true
---
Yea, but male your choice triggers when your atkeast 28 meters away from the hook.
---
I know everyone brings up the height as an issue, but I would love Chucky or Leprechaun. They’re just two of my favorite villains ever.
---
A Nerf to keys only allowing one person to escape before the last gen is completed would be nice. It's pretty bull that killers can just lose the game with one gen left and one person dead and the 3 remaining survivors can just escape through hatch under your nose from a key that was plundered or brought it. How is that balanced?
---
Im going clown and trapper
---
Aaah good to see a felow basment Trapper!
---
Would you like to speak here or since you’ve already sent me a chat request typing your displeasure over my comment calling me a troll maybe you’d prefer there.
---
Fuck you.
---
It's alphabetical code names for the patches, not clues about the killer.  The last two patches were Rawanda and Qatar for the Stranger Things chapter and the Nurse update, so next patch will be Thailand or something starting with a T.
---
Just bring an offering for a really big map. I find Autohaven works best if you get the really long map with three gens on each side (don't remember name). Play Trapper, trap the shit out of one side of the map and play normally.
---
I already got doctor sooo

What movie
---
People DC against Pinky Finger? Every time I went against this add-on the Clown wasted so much time trying to hit me with a bottle he could've easily downed me with 2 hits.
---
why would i want to ignore it
---
The top one I want to see is the mercenaries from You're Next. Underrated and extremely good home invasion horror movie with some pretty interesting concepts.
---
When else? One dead survivor takes the pressure out of the game.
---
natalia once again didn’t post the photo... it was a private account that posted it meaning they didn’t want anyone to see it? I’m trying to protect natalia’s privacy and it’s really not that hard to delete the photo 😭 just because you hate young women who are celebrities or whatever and you want to teach them a lesson not to take pictures of themselves doesn’t mean you should still have the picture up. if the account cared about natalia at all they’d delete the photo. the other reddit account, paulie, and natalia stans had no problem deleting it
---
What does it do? Also which killer has it
---
It counts if you close hatch before the final one dies, even if they’re hooked during hatch close, that’s how I got it.

If I could just remove one part of her nerf it would be that cooldown. It just doesnt feel fun to be limited in the sense of her only form of mobility. In the end this game is a casual game. No way you could turn this into a competitive game like overwatch or siege etc.

---
I think killers break pallets so the survivors can't use them again. If the killer just lifted up the pallet then what's stopping the survivors from just dropping it again?
---
Nobody uses it because theyd rather use BBQ for the bloodpoints. and most people underrate it or think it’s a stall perk.
---
Tremors triggers once every 45 seconds. The time in takes to counter BBQ is at least 16 seconds if you’re going into a locker. Hiding behind gens only barely works.

Freddy is a far worse threat than Michael tbh, like in the dream world Freddy literally warps reality. Ash also beat Jason Voorhees too, who's basically Michael x 1000
---
This is me. I always hate the moment of realization
---
I totally agree with you, but unfortunately not so many people play DBD(just 10000-50000), so if you make Match making so complicated, you will have to wait for match forever. If game would have 100 000 - 250 000 players, it would be a great idea.
---
Imagine they swallowed a radioactive substance that bonded to their bones and that's basically the skins
---
Okay cool, so I can wreck rank 20s with my trapper, then be restricted to wrecking the same ranks because I enjoy specific killers? 
---
*that sounds fun* /s
---
a glitch
---
You also forgot to account the 'first match of the day' bonus for both killer and survivor which gives you on average like 900 exp
---
"rewarded for failing your objective" -survivors that complain about Noed, using keys to escape without completing the objective.
---
sksksk
---
TBH as a killer I would rather have a perk that is active the entire match and helps me people down BEFORE the exit gates are open (like Make your Choice for example) than try to rely on a wildcard that might get countered.
---
NOED is all right but I just don´t run it on any of my killers because it´s not fun and it sucks playing 90 percent of the game with 3 perks.
---
Sounds like you’re projecting a lot of stuff onto random people you don’t know.
---
She’s very easy to pick up and use and also very good. And the devs said recently said that she was “over performing” so she will get looked at at some point. But doctor will be getting his add ons and maybe base (not 100% sure on that) reworked before her, and knowing behaviour and their timekeeping, as well as how much they have on their plate at the moment, I’d be amazed if spirit gets changed at all by summer 2020. Realistically you’re looking at about this time next year imo. So you’ll still have a lot of time to play as her as she currently is.
---
I just think it was too casual for people to enjoy. It was pretty heavily scavenger sided when it first came out and they took too long to fix it.
---
Negan from The Walking Dead?
---
Constant confusion or not noticing you’re being flirted with.  
---
Or think you’re being flirted with to only make yourself look stupid. Lol
---
Yeah,and then nobody would use it because it's basically a pudding offering every game and has a nice side benefit too.Do you see how many people run WGLF?If anything WGLF needs a buff tbh
---
And I don't know if you checked the stats they posted some months ago,ruin is the most used perk across all ranks

Jason is stuck in legal hell. But trapper is basically DBD’s version of him.

---
are you able to keep medkit after that like 1+ charges left? or does it deplete whole medkit
---
The fact that I can effortlessly move it again I would say lol. I understand it's just a game mechanic I'm just saying by comparison it's a pretty dumb one. Why not just have us shooting spitballs and everytime you land a hit the killer has to stop and wipe himself off because he's a germaphobe and hates bodily fluids? It's just silly is all I'm saying.
---
But like how? I see no problem with it for either side
---
60 seconds actually. Tremors has its downsides but I would still rate it above BBQ if we’re talking strictly how impactful it is during a match.
---
You'll find escaping chases easier. Being virtually silent is a big deal, especially against spirit. Won't waste time healing while perks like sloppy, thanataphobia, and nurses calling exist.
---
Ill dc if killer slugs for 4k
---
Her anal beads are too iconic to be nerfed
---
I haven't seen one survivor say they liked dedicated servers. 
---
Only killers and of course they like it since the amount of BS hits increased exponentially with dedicated servers.
---
I accidentally hit the wrong flair, it was supposed to be Dan content
---
I was doing the ‘succeed in 20 skillchecks’ mission and got 15 done the first game and only needed 5 to finish it. Easy to do in one game, probably one gen even. I did 2 gens all the way by myself and healed one other survivor and got none through all of that. Luckily I worked on one more gen and got all 5 within a minute but even then I was concerned I wouldn’t get them before someone else finished the last gen
---
The entity hinders the ability to fight back.
---
So far
---
I also had mostly good survivors. I met a few gen rushers that bullied me when I tried out Plague the first time, but most of the time people were friendly. 
---
I try to make fun games, don´t tunnel, don´t camp people, give hatches and switch targets often to give them a fair game. If I get a 3+K it´s nice, if not, whatever. I don´t want to rank up to reds anyway, so I am fine with not pipping as long as I get enough bloodpoints for the rest of the game. That in return usually gives me fun games from the survivor side.
---
The killers I played against were so much worse and I get why survivors are often complaining about Bloodhunts.
---
I regret buying that skin so much because David's pasty ass is clear as day

---
Lol good things there's a literally deity in the game to explain all these holes away.
---
I dream of possibly a Bates Motel version of Norman with his power maybe being turning into “mother,” and Emma or Dylan as the survivor
---
Honestly I could not take getting slapped around by a bear animatronic seriously lol
---
What holes? The entity has always been in the game and it always had very clear set of rules. They never changed them.
---
The Grudge, Samara, Blind Man, Norman, Jack and Pyramid Head would be sooooo coooool omg! i think if they're going to collab with steven king, it will probs be Jack, i doubt they want another clown AND doctor sleep has just come out too
---
I've seen this one too.
---
Same here! Tunneling no fun and giving them a fair shot is nice. Besides at the end of it it usually doesn’t matter how many survivors I sacced cause bbq is still gonna give me more bloodpoints than any of them.

 They're not in the regular world, if that wasn't perfectly clear

I just dc to let the other guy have it lol

Thats the joke. The devs said its okay to dc. Instead of dealing with the issue.
---
Against Plague it doesn't feel unfair
---
People have been working it out based on the amount of Rift Fragments available in Tome 1 and the leaked Tome 4. If you manage to get all the Fragments from the Tome challenges you’d still need to play, on average, 9-10 games a day to earn enough XP for all the levels.
---
pair it with No Mither and it always works. EZ OP build.
---
Kinda looks like SCP-1471.
---
They never bothered me honestly
---
when you unhook someone you get exposed for a set period of time. it's one of pig's perks
---
OMG YESS 😂
---
Boosters seem very lame the way they look. Plus if you even dare to buy all tiers then it's gonna be a huge amount of cash to be spent on... May I remind you that you pay 10$ for the paywall to get additional skins and combined like this, this doesn't sound legit.
---
In the PTB it was after each day so they could test more, these levels are supposed to last til the rift ends so it’ll be I believe a couple weeks in between.
---
🤮🤮🤮🤮
---
Why is that? I would think he would since he can reveal survivors for billy slow survivors for huntress chase survivors to loops while throwing bottles at them but i dont think hed be good for nurse or spirit
---
Freddy's actually good now. nurse is kind way too different for the people that got used to her, (including me). nobody really likes legion for some reason
---
Feel free to check out my latest post on calculating the amount of time it would probably take to max out the rift if you didn’t do tome challenges.
---
Nerve: struck
---
Okay buddy, I said “I’m aware” and that’s all I said, then I proceeded to explain why I was aware with the fact a storm of other people told me. I’m not saying I said “I’m aware because...” I simply explained why I was aware.
---
ALL OF THE UPVOTES!!
---
I'm more annoyed at the 3 second recharge per blink
---
Ok good, because as much as I love playing this game, I have things I need to do.... such as homework. Nahhh, I’ll just do that in school
---
Basically it's the same way that fornite does it.
---
They create all the challenges before the season starts but don't release them all at once.
---
This allows them to edit some if their is backlash and also incentivieses players to play later in the season instead of grinding the pass out at the start.
---
He has a reasonably high skill floor. Takes a decent amount of practice
---
I thought I was the only one. If I see someone else walking across legos they look like they're in a bunch of pain. If I walk across them I look like how I normally do, like a bitch.
---
I dont think we can nail skill with pinpoint accuracy, but we could generally tell who's skilled and not skilled. If spirit is overwhelmingly stronger then she'll probably win 90% of the time, if she isnt then it'll be more of a 50/50. After all, mindgames are really heavily dependent on probability. Just a sample size of maybe 30 games would be good enough to tell.
---
they're fun because they're rare
---
I kinda get what they're doing with the, bronze, silver, gold, and red, I guess? But it's a real lack of creativity to make them all separate unlockable charms. They should instead make ONE leaf charm and have there unlockable styles as you progress in xp or rift shards (e.g bronze, silver, gold, red) to make room for some better, more creative charms.
---
So Frank on a good day?
---
But like why DC against Clown.
---
Pig and it "exposed" the survivor who unhook someone when you are at least 40m away from the hook. It means you can one shot him
---
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
---
Frank on the best day.
---
Lmfao okay
---
As killer, it's fun when I go around to intercept and the survivor ends up right in front of me.
---
As survivor, I scream when I try go around like that and the killer just appears out of the corner.
---
I had to let two survivors finish the last two gens by making sure they stay away from the hatch. Then when they were completed, hit one with NoED. Mission accomplished.
---
Of course not, why do you think you can buy ranks...
---
It takes 800xp to get a point and you need 10 points to go up a tier so
---
800xp x 10 points x 70 levels = 560.000xp
---
If we take killer as measuring stick (since they get the full amount of xp every game, where survivors can get less for dying early) we can take about 500xp per game.
---
560.000 / 500 = 1120 games to play in order to level up by games alone.
---
This can be diminished by 3 or 5 points (2400xp or 4000xp per quest) for completing the quests from the archive, but they only come out every 2 weeks and you need to chose which one you want to complete each time you can't double dip adding to games you need to play (not by definition a bad thing), all the quests have been leaked already and the consensus is if you don't team up with the killer lvl. 3 and 4 are all but almost impossible to do.
---
Again taking Lvl. 1 as mesure you can get 83 points (so 8,3 tiers) as bonus.
---
83 points = 66.400xp x 4 levels = 265.600xp560.000 - 265.600 = 294.400xp to go (if you complete every single quest) this is an estimate since I don't know what quests will be 3 points or 5 points for lvl. 2 and 3.294.400xp to go / 500xp per game = 589 games to play
---
So 589 games to go / 70 days = 9-ish games a day to get to tier 70. (Again if you complete all quests)
---
So, better start the grind you got 70 days and god knows you're going to need 'em if you don't want to cough up cash!
---
**Best thing to do is wait until the last day and then decide is you think it's worth the $10 it costs to get the stuff you can.**
---
Me but with ace lmao, he's sooo loud
---
I got wraiths weapon.
---
Platform: PS4
---
Takes me 10-20 minutes to look for a match only to get an error about my connection. Been happening to me since the update. I’m lucky when I actually get into a game.
---
Only 15? I went through 165 levels on Freddy before getting BBQ
---
If you want me to retype it, I meant the following: I said “I’m aware” because a storm of other people have told me, some nicer than others... ...5 other explanations. I however did not say: I said “I’m aware because... ...5 other explanations”
---
Over in America they're pretty instantaneous so I would assume that EU would be relatively similar.
---
Longest wait I have had all day was around 3 minutes and that was an outlier compared to other rounds.
---
The shortest ques usually happen around 4P.M. to 9P.M. from my experience.
---
Just checked it out and yeah, it would sound fair if you'd spend lots of time for this. But I'm actually concerned and having a fear that I won't manage to get most of these due to how matchmaking is broken and it's current ranking pools being out of limits. If they would actually dare to fix this issue then it wouldn't be a big matter of a problem. Be advised if someone even disconnects while loading into a match from a long lobby queue, it takes even additional time for finding one. Won't be surprising you spent half an hour to find a lobby to get something?
---
Haha I thought about that for the tome challenge. I used no mither once for the adept David trophy. Never again. I tip my hat to the people who regularly use that perk... unless they insta die.

If you don’t feel like you can finish the path and don’t feel like what you are able to get in the time you can is worth it, then don’t do it next time. Doesn’t sound legit? Fuck off lol

That's really cool.

Doesnt hurt to see the first posts in the sub, there's literally one every 5 post or so

A lot of people started way ahead on the Rift. Some people started at tier 20+. 
---
I started on Tier 16.
---
You can loose items sometimes, and sometimes you won't get escape BP.
---
Ok I'm speechless now,is it because you've unlocked too many perks with other killers or is it because you aren't getting the perks to level 3 so they always re-appear?I'm afraid that the second option would be the main issue
---
i'm saying i'm more ugly than Quentin because Quentin is gorgeous, only true Quentin mains understand the beauty of Quentin
---
btw i said Quentin 5 times including this one
---
Didn't realize I wanted that
---
He probably facecamps
---
Monstrous shrine stands as quite possibly the most useless perk, it's even an actual detriment to the only niche build it could go in.
---
 With basement builds you want more time down there for the rest to come and try to save. Them dying early throws that out the window, hindering them.
---
you gonna keep crying?
---
I'm at 17
---
The store banners don't get enough credit for how creative and cool they are. I wish there was a gallery where we could look at them all in-game.
---
Shirtless clown pls
---
I know right! Especially as survivor, if I don’t crash from waiting in a queue then it can easily be a 3-7 minute wait, and if I don’t crash getting into a lobby in then I’ll get put with a killer from Europe, and if I don’t crash loading into a match then I get to finally do my challenges
---
Then sell pantless myers
---
Your video doesn't work, and letting you bleed out to die is not holding a game hostage. Holding a game hostage is a never ending state where the only way out is to disconnect from the game forfeiting your points.
---
I do know that if you died during the Endgame Collapse, he was most likely trying to accomplish one of the Archive missions, which is to kill 1 survivor via the EGC. I felt slimy having to do it myself.
---
16, probably going to level a lot slower once double bp ends and with it most of my desire to play.
---
I actually dont know about the mask, I bought the entire outfit
---
But I use Joey's skull mask and his Karambit with the glowy body. Really looks sick as hell
---
Flag in the background is fine!
---
Doesn't matter whether or not she thought it'd be shared, taking the photo period is risking it getting shared, she should know better at that age. And that's a real shame fam, cause it doesn't seem like the post's going anywhere. Guess she'll just have to suck it up and move on like a normal person.
---
I started at 14, I think I'm around 25 now with the first tome almost finished.
---
 I was just searching a chest and THREE survivors were doing the gen right next to me yet the wraith chose to chase me.. wtf man!
---
If serious killer mains where invited then why wasnt hexy B)
---
but for real who even watches that guy he is toxic as shit and no one has said anything about it
---
^shirtless ^frank
---
Its fine six hours per week is not so much
---
Im torn bettween shirtless frank and julies booty
---
He trapped me in a corner and the other survivor completed all gens and started the end game calapase
---
Personally I don't condone deranking but that is usually because people will do it right before BP weekends so they can farm newer players. Best I can advise is just dont rank, I have been in the same boat as you and at this point I just get everyone to last hook, then "do" the gens and "escape" with them. Then bring a green mori for that one arse who decides he has to flashlight blind you and tea bag you every five seconds once he realizes you are being nice. Usually I dont pip when I do this, occasionally will de pip if they rush too fast
---
Quentin is always the bottom in SFWs, and a fuckin brat. Does easy but will t-bag a ton.
---
  I've never seen a Dwight t-bag nicely tbh. If they t-bag at all it's to be a dick.
---
 And Steve running normal clothes? Yeah. Scoops Ahoy? On the level of Neas
---
I did post a vid but its my first time uploading a video so maybe it didn't work, also my first time recording a video too, I just wanna know how can I report it
---
Shirtless Frank Reynolds
---
Made this challenge today and I also didn't noticed any difference
---
Two guys do the math you need six hours per week
---
I didn't "bleed out" I wasn't even downed
---
I want chucky. killing survivors at a foot tall.
---
If you’re on Xbox, this is a known issue and they’re working on it
---
The key problem is its mentioned that it's this much grinding if it's perfect games. So you could easily double that playtime to account for most games you dont get a perfect score.
---
What reason is there to quit? Ive had games where ive been hooked twice and still managed to get out at the end anyways. Im still pretty new to this game so i definetely dont understand all the ins and outs of the ranking mechanic.
---
I can understand camping if there’s only 1 gen left and all survivors are still alive, but why camp first hook with no gens done?? :(
---
Good, they're all swarming you trying to get a sick flashlight save. Trust me, maybe they'll be annoying as fuck but you'll win anyways because nobody is doing gens.
---
True
---
Thats literally my steam name
---
No need to be ashamed of saying devs aren't perfect on timing things. Plus, just to recap I calculated. 70 tiers will cost you 7000 Auric Cells, basically almost a 50$ value of wasting on these... mostly skins and 50% of them being charms.
---
Look, don't get me wrong if I say this. But this just sounds like a scam IF and I mean IF you don't even manage getting everything as you paid 10$ for getting additional things. And boosters only exist if you are well, I don't know? Rich and don't have time for this? But that's about it for the booster option and nothing else.
---
Nice, you must almost have enough shards for a skin.
---
We need more ppl like you sir, your Country thanks you for your Sacrifice 🙌🏾
---
Here's the thing, if they do that. They should make it so it can't be opened once it's closed.
---
 Most of the time it ain't a full team getting out there. It's two people.
---
Video seems to work just fine
---
Prayer beads doesnt remove TR, Im 99% sure of that.

&gt;Yes it does and the video is working
---
No it doesn't... Holding the game hostage is when you have no ways to end the match for indefinite amount of time. Waiting 2 minutes to die is far from it. Same for being slugged to death.
---
They said not to report people for DCing.

"Disconnects (leaving the match before killed or sacrificed) - DO NOT REPORT "
---
You'd think he would create improvised weapons and kill the killers.
---
Watch the video before making yourself look like a dumbass
---
But NOED bad.
---
BHVR just gets tired of Killers' issues with Survivors spawning 5 feet from the totem haha.

Game ended so he didn’t hold it hostage.

Use his real body, Make chucky like jigsaw make him a doll who controls his human body even tho jigsaw is just a doll
---
Does he move slower on the stub?
---
they arent, if im not mistaken im pretty sure you need 2 survivors to die before hatch spawns?
---
I have a similar issue, when they first came out I did the first survivor challenge and went to claim it, it glitched out and since then I haven't been able to claim it or move on to the rest of the survivor challenges.  I can select and deselect the first killer one without issue, but can't do anything with the survivor challenges.
---

You can do that until you get to level 4 of the tome, where you have to sacrifice 3 survs in EGC using NOED in a single match.
---
i have yet to even encounter someone escaping with a key, you act like this is an everyday occurrence while playing killer
---
No?
---
I swear I saw a post similar to this a few months back. Used a different template though

Yeah cos hes an easy win for double blood points

I had a lisp for a week and kept saying.

its impossible to get all /four/ survivors out without all the gens being complete

I'm honestly okay with the nurse having such a big hitbox because of how difficult she can be, but I've never had issues with GF

That's what I thought.  Just double checking.
---
You actually forgot jeepers creepers :D
---
wouldnt they not read 65 pages though?
---
&gt;No?
---
Well, then your footage is useless unfortunately. Without an in-game report it will be immediately discarded. 
---
Next time report them in-game and only then you can send the footage to the support team at: https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests
---
I’ve never had an issue against ghostfaces swings. The only main swings that are always broke are Freddy’s. Idk what the devs did but Freddy can always hit you from a mile away
---
hope is underrated af, i think its fine as it is. But it could use a slight buff with the amount of time it last or some sort of 2nd ability
---
Blind as fuk: your FOV is reduced by 100% andyou are literally blind. You must track by sound alone. 100× blood points in all categories.
---
I think the main reason people dislike spirit isn't because she doesn't have counter play, but mostly because she is particularly unfun to vs.
---
I am mostly of the opinion that the counterplay for her isn't substantial, but it does exist. It's just typically ineffective.
---
They might not, but some people have asked me to see it
---
thats why u need deerstalker and dont hook when its down to 2 survivors. down them both before hooking one and using deerstalker to find the other before it finds the hatch
---
as a David and Jane main can confirm
---
Around 2,000 people every time he streams.  Who do you watch besides otz?
---
What part of add ons has the flashlight???
---
I personally use battery MUCH better than the other add ons
---
He looks like a sexy nurse trying to seduce you
---
I dont know any personally, the mediocre killers arent heavily played by people that create content, I'm sure theres some good Legion players out there but how many of them create videos or stream is unknown to me
---
and some of the more popular perks like ds and unbreakable are only one use per match
---
Same lol
---
&gt;Watch the video
---
There wasn't a video when I said that. He edited OP or it took a while to load his media. 
---
Even after watching it, devs often ask for a 10 minutes footage to be considered holding the game hostage. Since luckily for that killer, the other survivor opened an exit gate, OP died before that time.
---
Goddammit I am seriously FUBAR!
---
I'm stuck at T1 put on a scratched mirror
---
My games already finished because I got face camped, good times
---
Except things like the wayback machine exist. The photos out there. It's not going anywhere, stop trying to white knight for the pretty celebrity.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqrhsb/confusing_archives/
---
Holding one survivor (you) stuck in a corner while another survivor (your teammate) gets everything done is not holding the game hostage. One of the survivors is still capable of progressing the game and is unheeded in doing so. Just because you are incapable of doing anything does not mean the game is held hostage.
---
Well, its iz now and its over 10 minutes and I dont know how long before the video starts, so yeah...Held game hostage
---
Flashlight firing squad
---
Funny jojoke, laughed
---
Trash
---
why do you assume i watch otz? i dont really watch much twitch, but i have played against and with hexy. The dude legit reports every billy he goes against.
---
His chat is so dumb and they suck his dick almost as hard as pugs.
---
White knight a bit harder maybe then she'll sleep with you.
---
were you able to play with 5 survivors or did it just disconnect?
---
Duuude I got the glitch where I could see level 4. Jesus christ most of that shit seems impossible. Catch 4 different survivors in beartraps? Complete 4 gens with dark sense? Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement? Easy. But in a **single** game?! Hell no
---
I had fun with it. I agree that it could use a buff though. There are lots of perks which can. Vigil, We're Gonna Live Forever, Poised and a bunch of others could be great, mainstream perks if they had some buffs/added effects
---
It disconnected.
---
Master of the challenges, teach me how to complete the sacrifice in EGC. It's my last challenge and I feel so scummy trying to complete it :(
---
m1 seems to not register some times. Makes it very hard to play as killer. This only happens in dbd played wow for 5hrs and m1 worked with no problems.

ifunny.co
---
Yeah dude I was just doing the plunderer challenge and minding my own business opening chests while all my teammates do gens and the killer goes for me. Like bruhhhh
---
&gt;Well, its iz now and its over 10 minutes and I dont know how long before the video starts, so yeah...Held game hostage
---
The video doesn't show 10 minutes and OP didn't even report in-game which makes his footage useless. 
---
People are downvoting me but I am merely repeating the devs words on the matter.
---
Idk what you’re talking about. I managed to complete the challenge in the first 3 minutes as a survivor, and it was not on one of the swamp maps
---
Combine the two with a tombstone and it has the potential to make people fail no nut november
---
Jason can’t come to Dead by daylight cause of the lawsuit and cause he already has a game. I like pinhead, miner, the thing, and candy man and penny wise to be added
---
and any decent killer can dodge flashlight stuns, and its fairly easy to mind game people with flashlights trying to get a flashlight save, and theres nothing wrong with sprint burst and insta heals which people barely bring anyways, atleast for me
---
3. I didn't play much at all before the events official launch, I was playing other games Halloween events instead.
---
It's actually replaced with a heely.
---
&lt;3
---
Lmao, nice
---
Only people saying spirit isn't op are spirit mains
---
Just do it whilst queueing as killer plenty of time
---
It's a known issue on Xbox.
---
Bruh ready up
---
That’s like saying that no mither is better than unbreakable because you can get up more than once with no mither, but you won’t factor in the broken status effect because why not
---
Then why would they not allow it lol? That's not why, its because medkits have addons that allow you to increase the frequency of skillchecks
---
Where
---
this happens on live and one time ot happened at the exit gated so I lost what would've been a kill I was so tilted
---
&gt;He didn’t exactly hold the game hostage, just you. Still annoying though.
---
The offense is "holding the game hostage" not "the match". For that one survivor, his game is being held hostage and that is more than enough to get people banned.
---
That’s a good point but I think these two ideas compliment each other rather then conflict.
---
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN thanks for correcting/making this clear to him.
---
I'm ghostface main, and I still believe she isn't OP. She is strong and sometimes unfair, but she better remain as she is, except stridor nerf, because if devs decide to nerf her, she's going to get legion treatment which basically means they are going to kill her.
---
Consider the possibility that those survivors are sick of relying on teammates who don't know wtf they're doing.
---
I've been having weird issues for a while where it things like daily ritual progress disappears or a daily is switched to something else after a game, bloodwebs regressing. It's like the player profile does not always upload to the server or a previous version replaces it at times. Nothing huge or crippling yet, fingers crossed.
---
&gt;Holding one survivor (you) stuck in a corner while another survivor (your teammate) gets everything done is not holding the game hostage. One of the survivors is still capable of progressing the game and is unheeded in doing so. Just because you are incapable of doing anything does not mean the game is held hostage.
---
Technically if the other survivors don't do generators which wouldn't trigger EGC and the killer still refuses to move from that position, it would be considered holding the game hostage. 
---
That survivor has no way to play the game and the killer has no intent of letting him go or hitting him.
---
Sacrificing all survivors in the basement isn't that hard. Just copy a basement build from Monto and you'll get there. I particularly like Basement Trapper basement Freddy on haddonfield (so you can teleport to the generator above the basement)
---
Thats not a hole 4head
---
I'm slowly edging towards red ranks currently rank 6. How difficult is it?
---
Yeah, but the DCing makes it a hard one
---
you know what's unfair? gen rushing, teabagging, running object of obsession, being cocky, repeatedly going after a totem, etc.. 
---
you bet your ass i'm gonna camp you if you do any of these
---
Tbh the one on the right looks scarier/creepier
---
Okay. What is fun? Do you think perks like D-Strike or rushing gens are "fun" for killers?
---
Most would argue not, but that does not mean they are unbalanced or need to be changed. This is an assymetrical PvP game about killing people, not everything is going to be "fun" to play against.
---
Yeah its kinda crazy that they accept it, since they said it was bannable, but they had Fog Whisperers like JenDenise dc all the time to derank to bully killers. Pretty sad they allow it to happen.
---
"jUsT cLeANs tOTEMs" and then in the same breath "nERF sWF". Its amazing
---
“Always break the distance” LOL. Ez counter for spirit; just get away from her. Awesome advice. Never gonna get injured now.
---
Could you elaborate why you would running TT over BBQ? 
---
I feel BBQ would be a top tier perk even without the BP boost
---
If your on console there's a known exploit killers can do to make the game think the survivors left rather than the kill
---
EDIT: didnt look at the post, its not this case
---
Ghostface is probably the only time I'll write gf
---
This subreddit posts this same exact thing pretty much every 2 minutes
---
how i did it was hook someone twice and when/ if they finish all the gens down that last hook survivor and open the gate yourself to trigger the egc and hook them, it doesent have to be by the entity after the timer runs out, just a sacrifice during the collapse
---
I agree. All killers should be around Freddy and Billy's level. Not better than Billy and not worse than Freddy.
---
Except you can actually dodge hatchets and you can still see Ghostface.
---
What if as a secondary ability it ate off some of your exausted timer, like 15-20-25% each time a gen is completed
---
Can people seriously stop posting these, it’s already been leaked days ago.
---
I'm still going to report it because when the video first starts as you can see I have crows so that proves I'd been trapped over there for a good while
---
They're the chosen ones, don't you knew it?
---
i was thinking that, but killers fucking hate exhaust so it will be nerfed or just a useless amount
---
The end game what?
---
It wasn't edited if you were wondering, it seems weird tho, aint got any ideas how it happened. Maybe because of the new charms cosmetics and the hook preview but it says legion and it doesnt seem right
---
That's theoretical, though, and from further comments not what happened in this player's case.
---
You’re a wizard, Harry
---
D strike exists to deny people from denying your fun by tunneling off hook. But yes your point still stands.
---
They always take it so seriously.. like mate, I was kidding around! No need to be mad
---
&gt; What is fun?
---
The other things you mentioned have answers an individual player can do. Pressure gens more, use Ruin, slug the survivors etcetera etcetera.
---
I play solo. When I'm on survivor I do all totems I come across but it's no guarantee that all of them will get done. And when even one totem stays up, at the end of the game one survivor will get fucked over through sheer bad luck of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
---
There has to be a better, more interesting way of doing this perk imo.
---
I can lift a pallet, but it would probably take me alot more than 2 kicks to break it fully. Not only that, but killers effortlessly pick up people, and is almost entirely unhindered by their weight. It seems fair to assume the entity is granting then extra strength.
---
I agree, but holding the game hostage is not allowing it to end.
---
Yes, that is the point. Sometimes "unfun" perks are needed in the game because they serve a purpose. Same with NOED.
---
If only que times weren’t so bad, I wouldn’t have been here and given a upvote haha
---
Ignore the flag? Why would we do that??
---
What type of kick do you normally use maybe that's the problem?
---
I had no crows on big boat or the rest of the map. Was weird.
---
That information was wrong. Its pass exclusive for a few months first.
---
Me, playing Ghostface for the first time: Heck yeah, I'm just gonna hook them once for the BBQ stacks then follow them around teabagging and let them escape, because I want everyone to get a bunch of BP!
---
Survivors: 3 dc's after first down/hook
---
(If you're in solo queue) They should give you bonus bloodpoints for everyone that escapes if you spectate to the end of a game.
---
Yeah my game doesn’t define everyone’s. Maybe I just got really lucky.
---
So true, my killer games are instant but my survivor queues take +5 minutes.
---
Are you mocking Jesus
---
I came into the match gay so I don't care
---
known glitch on xbox they know about it and are fixing it
---
Too fucking true.
---
Omg!
---
I want the thing as a shapeshifting killer XD
---
&gt;flashbacks of last bloodhunt
---
Not in this case as the other guy escapes
---
I main killer and Quentins are my favorite survs. I like to imagine them like chilly cool dudes
---
That is literally her only nerf. Overall, her add on rework was good because nobody likes omega blink or 5 blink nurses, and all her addons are unique and viable now, so I wouldn’t call it a nerf, and that’s the only thing changed about her.
---
Drank too much Slurm
---
How’d you get a girlfriend?
---
I don't have any of these cosmetics and actually really look forward to unlocking them lol
---
The Demogorgon basement on Gas Heaven, yeah haha. I laughed so hard at that one.
---
Thanks Satan :)
---
And people who troll their own teammates. Had a Claudette who did nothing whole game and even ran to her teammates and pointed at the locker they were in so I would kill them.
---
I hooked the Claudette and grabbed the other survivor and let them do the gens and get hatch.
---
Hate trolls who screw over teammates.
---
Then you go to heal him up, then pukes in you afterwards, now you’re sick
---
Nah 8 years
---
Yea, you can down someone twice and if they dc when ur 2 meters from a hook it dousnt count, thats so bs. But I kinda dislike the ranking system beyond that, you could destroy the enemy team getting a quick 4k, but if they gen rush and pop a gen or two you wont get max points, like fuck that.
---
Butt hurt survivor main right here
---
They'd have to also make killer ranks degrade much less. Rank reset would only happen every 3 months and take you down 1-2 ranks.
---
The Steves from my games would like to disagree with you
---
I ended up getting to it by doing the one behind it. So you might have to progress through the killer one until you can make it to the one that is bugged.
---
I show the route I took to unlock the bugged one here, its the green line
---

---
You might have to do the same!
---
1987 (Colourised)
---
Curious around what level on the actual rift are you on? Did it unlock a decent amount of tiers when you were done with the challenges?
---
Detective's Hunch, easy 5k bold points
---
Same. Did everything in the first day and I thought my game was bugged because I couldn't get to the other levels lol
---
That’s the problem though, why would I do something non objective related just for the small chance the killer is running NOED? Not to mention how long it takes to find all 5 totems.
---
The nurse outfit tho
---
Nah, I was a Kate on Badham. Crazy to see that that many red rank players self care against legion though.
---
NOED isn’t a good perk, however, it rewards killers that play bad.
---
The sequel was pretty meh, though.
---
But have you SEEN it in game? The glow is so sexy and neon.
---
Personally I think Nurse is great, the Wraith is pretty cool (finally no chicken legs) and I really like the Hag too. Billy and Trapper are meh.
---
I am not a fan of survivors because it is just regular clothing or glasses or whatever, and it´s kinda boring. 
---
Overall I think you cannot expect much crazy stuff for 10 dollars, but I do think the quality could be improved a bit in the next one. It is obvious that they struggled to fill the pass though, especially since they don´t even have 100 levels and they are already doing recolors.
---
same
---
Yeah,because Adrenaline is super fun to play against...I dont even use NOED but come on,its almost every match there is people with Adrenaline which is the "noed for survivor",its not fun at all people injured in a chase and get full health plus sprint burst lol.At least for NOED you can cleanse totems.
---
swap self care for iron will, you already have bond to find others to heal you
---
Did you really had to revive the aurthers fist meme only for it to burn and be forgotten
---
Survivor mains here? Because killers get short queue times in my opinion.
---
Here's a prayer beads change. Make it iridescent level. Remove fathers gladness
---
I actually have no problem doing dull totems. On the off-chance that there's NOED I'm actually helping out, and it gives a good chunk of points too. And it only takes 15 seconds anyway.
---
The problem is that you can't realistically expect one survivor to get all five totems. Even with Small Game that's not realistic.
---
Why? You don't want to accept that you got fucked up, and not let the killer get 4K?
---
Wraith: Faster movemed speed while cloaked in exchange for being slower while uncloaking
---
Hillbilly: Faster movemed speed while using the chainsaw in exchange of a longer charge
---
Nurse: Longer range in exchange of a longer charge
---
Spirit: 7:18
---
Really, why killer's addons after Pig have no downside except the pink ones? I can understand weaker killers, but Spirit? She can be faster with a longer duration and with a shorter cooldown, even with only an add-on.
---
yeah its broken right now.
---
No literally the person who mentions it is in a different reply thread. Your response doesn't show up.
---
I feel the pain but if gens gets done to fast im doing it
---
on a switch? you mad lad
---
😑 Yes.
---
Thank you! I'm two matches in and survived one and died one.
---
We'll make it
---
But the perks required to counter her aren't part of the meta build.  And that means they can't mimic their favourite toxic streamer.
---
It's rough ngl
---
Sure she might be hard to master but she's easy to pick up and get pretty good results with.
---
Some people hear it, some people fear it ... some people just won’t go near it.
---
Iri heads are also ultrarare and they are busted. Changing them to a higher rarity does nothing.
---
A forceful one.
---
Yes, I noticed that the sounds were unchanged and was disappoint.  The pipe, at least, would be easy -- just swap in the sound of The Doctor's baseball bat.
---
Making broken addons ultra rare doesn't make them balanced.
---
You can't depip at rank 19, I think depips start at 16?
---
Anyone having an idea when this might get released? Am reeeaaally looking forward to it!
---
The plague should get a spitter skin
---
They have a big drawback though. Prayer beads dont
---
Any word on it?
---
The Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth. I don't think it killed anyone though.
---
while doing the objectives I found a fun build
---
quick n quite, lithe, spine chill and iron will.
---
really having fun. I tried this after completing this is not happening challenge.
---
ngl I just did that 2 games ago.
---
4 gens done and people started stepping on every trap.
---
I just want a pair of shorts for David so he can wear the least clothes possible
---
A drawback that can be half removed by using a belt.
---
I belive thats called the Wendigo
---
Console ps4
---
I know. But i cant think of a proper good rework without thinking of a drawback. Maybe make it so she shimmers like wraith
---
Yeah man I feel exactly the same.  Appreciate the response considering the -6 downvotes lmao.
---
Cuz survivors didnt lears yet she has a cooldown on her ability and that she cant phase right after u drop a pallet on hrr if she just showed up...
---
If you don't want to be camped try not using those hair, some ppl assume you are toxic only by using it so there's bigger chance of you getting camp
---
I'm getting +5 minute survivor queues at rank 7, PS4, Ireland. 
---
My killer queues at rank 4 are instant and fill up quickly. This has always been the case regardless of rank.
---
Which is another add on that is needed separately. Prayer beads can have that plus mother-daughter ring
---
I think you’re on to something
---
i’m talking about the 5 sacrifice quest...
---
Sorry, but I just rushed through it because I was dying for something new to do. I have almost 2k hours in the game and 90% of the time I sit at the red ranks for both killer and survivor so its hard for me to take things slow and casually. Besides, at this point idc about winning or losing in the trial because ik one way or another I am stuck in the red ranks. So these missions just gave me something to do and made me forget the staleness of the red ranks.
---
Definitely we'll make it.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dqskaz/we_all_know_that_things_need_balance_changes_in/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Well she doesn't actually know about that part yet.
---
Really? I always thought auto was superior since it came out.
---
you mean like "kill all survivors in one trial by any means" (tombstone or Ebony Memento Mori)?
---
Thank you for your input. Ill switch to we'll make it then
---
From my experience, not at purple/red ranks.
---
Any survivor rank 1-10 knows that at this point...
---
I‘m red ranks on PS4 and it takes about 20 minutes
---
Imma just say this, I did the crow challenge in a single match. I spent a good half the game doing absolutely nothing but fucking with the only area I could find crows. I did one Maybe two gens in total and felt bad becuase I was assuming I was useless to my team, 3 iri and top of the bp board... 
---
You may be wondering if there's a lesson in all this? Well yes, fucking with crows is the best way to farm bp /s
---
But they still fall for it... i dunno man, seems fishy
---
Devour hope? Sure when you run around the map without tryinf to cleanse shit, than yeah it's aids
---
The problem is rather that nothing should be countered by perks only..
---
The best thing about this is the exponentially decreasing amount of upvotes as I scroll down
---
GRABBIN' BILLS
---
I like how everyone is talking about the other guys change lol
---
if u have unlocked stbfl, get legion
---
