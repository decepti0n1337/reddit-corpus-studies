---
Well, that's clever
---
Me as well man.
---
Because you are in the minority of opinions.
---
Yeah but you’d still be able to use it even if you don’t get to use it a lot, missing out on an entire perk slot just because you weren’t lucky enough to get the right map sounds like a terrible idea
---
I don’t see the DC?
---
I’ll only expect this if the noise it makes is the Transformers noise from the original cartoon 
---

---
Generators survivors in disguise
---
Your welcome
---
same im a killer main i said lets do a survivor match for a change nearly shat myself
---
Exactly that’s why I should have the daily ritual completed
---
This is a terrible perk idea, why should a survivor have to miss out on having a fourth perk just because they weren’t lucky
---
I'm not the only one? O.O
---
Removed for name shaming please edit names
---
Thank youuuuu :D
---
This upcoming mid-chapter patch.
---
We already have that it’s called lag
---
Thanks, when is the mid chapter coming out?
---
He truly is a mom. Best of all, he’s our mom
---
Ultimately the only thing that matters is did you do enough to at least black pip, thinking they have to escape to win is insane.  Escaping is on the team, your score is on you.
---
I wish more people had that mentality, would be way less toxic :(
---
And you're a Jake main right?
---
She's absolutely terrifying, I'm gonna have a heartattack when she jumps on me from the ground.
---
There is no "data" to collect in the first place. There are only bugs to fix which everyone can see withing 1 hour playtime.
---
You trippin frank is the bomb
---
[removed]
---
This is incorrect. Luck offerings or perks do not increase chances of escaping. RBTs are fixed. As soon as its placed on you it is set to a specific box to get it off. Luck doesn't change that.
---
belong on a hook*
---
Just play Claudette she basically has this at all times
---
This is probably one of the best things I've ever seen on here. Lol.
---
I don't believe they ever said that. One of the devs tweeted to Quentins actor (whose name I can't remember right now) stating that they should work together. But nothing real has came since then
---
Horror movie fan?
---
Not enough info to solve
---
Yes.. telling people that they belong on a cross for t-bagging is okay, but saying people who react like that are overreacting is edgy
---
Everybody spread out on gens. He won’t be able to stop all of them
---
I really like your art style. Looks great!
---
Thanks :D ❤️
---
Soon.
---
Just dont add the ez lmao
---
Most players dont play enough to get 2000 iri shards in a couple days. A week is fine
---
i get 49-52 ping in lobby but seriously some hits in the game are extremely questionable and i really wanna throw my keyboard from a window as a survivor....is there any ping indicator to tell me how stable is my ping to the servers? i dont wanna blame the servers if my internet is the one doin hiccups...u know ;)
---
welcome to hell
---
If he did he would get gen rushed and t bagged before it pops
---
Well i havent owned one, can you explain how those fans work?
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of bug: Trophy
---
Description: The Wounded Healer trophy on PS4 has been bugged since the May update so that you're not able to get it. It's been 5 months when are you guys going to fix it?!
---
I managed to get into a game against my friend as survivor when he was killer last weekend during the double bloodpoints just by chance. Was definitely the easiest 32k game I've ever gotten.
---
I think its happening to multiple people. Every single daily i've gotten since the last patch or two changes when i go to check it again, i had one for sabotaging 2 hooks but then it changed into chainsawing 3 people, and when you trash one it either changes back (minus the option to trash a perk again) or changes  into something else when you try to do it
---
Spine chill against ghosty assuming the reveal works would bully him :(
---
Aww someone wants to derank to bully survivors/killers? They changed it, it's not a bug
---
They like horror movies...
---
It's been 5 months why the hell have they not fixed it yet
---
Drop self care. Run bond. You can see teammates running towards you and if theyre not being chased you can heal eachother faster
---
Coool
---
idc
---
not at all lol. i agree that disconnecting needs a penalty and i didn’t get the depip. i don’t think that should be changed cause everyone’s gonna dc on their first down again
---
Plague: Iron Will, Spine Chill, Sprint Burst, Distortion
---
Object of Obsession counters him too.
---
Sometimes the devs don’t understand how to play their game because they’re busy making it. More people need to understand this.
---
Should I get a pound of beef or a pork roast tonight
---
F
---
I know. I was trying to be sarcastic because of how the user I replied to was acting like prayer beads are justified because of “jump scares”
---
Really cool, I love all the added stitching detail in the sweatshirt and the mask is spot on! Cool you got the pics professionally taken too :)
---
It is actually random, ive seen youtubers get trapoed 2 times and get it off their heads at the same box both times
---
When I play at night at around 10 PM and beyond, I get games instantly but during the day like afternoon, only survivors games so basically who I main is time related. You may have to do so as well
---
didn’t feel like going against a laggy iri huntress and dc’d by the way. but assume i did it to derank and bully killers lmfao i hate this sub
---
I bet Feng would be the angriest at Pig and Ghost Face than any other killer since they could teabag her and nobody likes teabagging
---
Why not both?
---
2 killers + 8 survivors WEN
---
Object of Obsession against any stealth killer.
---
Every damn time I play Ghost Face there's a random Laurie with OoO pointing at me, if they're in a SWF I just can't use my power until they're dead.
---
bloodthirsty with legion would make him scary 10 percent incrased speed if played right
---
You right
---
Don't give the devs ideas.
---
is crouching always considered a bad thing? whenever I get a bro killer we'll have a little standoff and I'll crouch (slowly) a couple times to let him know I'm chill and it works out. or when they've been nice and helped us farm points and survive the trial I'll drop my item for him, crouch a few times and motion him towards me as we leave. 
---
I could see it being very bm if you spam crouch to be a dbag though
---
##Repair
---
I keep posting and asking about it wherever/whenever I can. Can't get an answer.
---
Wait if I can play that one girl from split I will be happy. Idk man I just think she’s super fuckin pretty.
---
I don’t trust words from satanists like you!
---
It isnt but I'm being amicable cause killers dont like tbagging do I'm kinda meeting in the middle idk.
---
Except now with dedicated servers that (in theory) determine hits based on what the server says is the location of the Killer, rather than the Killer's own client, any hits you *do* take that look that shouldn't have connected are because of your own latency (your current position on your screen hasn't been correctly updated).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
40 ping from the lobby =/= 40 ping in game.
---
Same I realized self-care didn't really help me much once I hit green ranks so I swapped it for kindred or iron will. But yeah I've died on first hooks because nobody came for me and the killer wasn't even camping or near me and they are usually crouching somewhere.
---
Petition To go by this mans unwritten rule
---
That’s fine but can you tell me what a satanist is?
---
Iron will to spirit, spine chill to any of the stealth killers, dead hard to any killer,borrowed time to bubba
---
I’m wrong? Since when were you the person to decide who I main?
---
I don’t know!
---
Please say that is an ash bowl and not mold lol
---
Ight then. I mean hitting on the hook is bming but bodding isnt really too serious. I'm glad u weren't tbagging tho. Usually people post stuff like this and claim one side was bming and leave out the rest of the story.
---
Nerf Ruin? Already is by being a hex. 
---
And it’s not game breaking or stupidly op either.
---
*perhaps*
---
Sure why not it sounds ok
---
It can only be placed while you're not exhausted
---
Sounds p cool
---
When he released, in a four man we’d all bring OoO. Fair to say, we didn’t get to actually play many. The DC was real.
---
Just a rebel group that doesn’t believe in religions or any god especially when they act so wrong. Like Catholics and kids lol. 
---
We are atheists really lol.
---
Keep up the logical fallacies sophist
---
Iron will doesn't make sense, something you said
---
Distortion for the auras when puking?
---
Can’t wait for the Quentin nerf. Maybe I’ll be able to look at him during a chase.
---
Just because you don't like getting mori'd doesn't mean it's a bad mechanic.
---
Amazing work. YOU. LOOK. AWESOME!!
---
Question, how’d you make the mask? What’s it made of??
---
Looks amazing! Would love to see more!
---
Permission received. Go for it bro.
---
I didn’t say it was. I’m just saying devs aren’t always right.
---
Nah he’s just a punk kid
---
I’ve sat on it and this is the only way killing the killer would be fair 
---
Throughout the game you cannot open chests when all gens are done gain the ability to open chests in one chest a gun will spawn once you get the gun ( if survivors searched all other chests they cannot open the last one with the gun)
---
Once end game collapse starts you gain the ability to shoot the gun at the killer (must hit killer in the face) once killed you screen will be filled with an ungodly amount of MLH Mountain Dew 420 and Doritos 
---
Once this seizure inducing light show ends the entity will fuck cast down and rip you into the sky instead of escape points you will gain killer points
---
Same could be said about balanced landing.
---
Or adrenaline if not all the gens get done.
---
Or pharmacy if no chest is opened.
---
Ect.
---
What do you mean cool animation? Is it different when you Mori them in different states?
---
Conditional probability.
---
Some now
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I don't know man, this version very closely resembles the new Freddy. You'd probably be surprised how closely they could match original Freddy.
---
Nerf ruin because it seems like a lot of killers rely on it to regress the game, and a good proportion of killers use it.
---
Maybe it doesn't need a nerf, but way too many killers use it.
---
Um
---
We got an optimisation patch and the game runs between 40-60 fps for me
---
Xbox
---
Hm didn’t know that
---
No. Just that you get to see the mori animation at all.
---
Mmm true true. But honestly I think they should focus on making other perks better and other killers better then nerfing anything.
---
With that play style you would thrive with Q&amp;Q! Wp!
---
POG
---
People who run pharmacy have the intention of looting a chest and are given the opportunity, people with adrenaline are probably good enough to survive until endgame and it can happen on any map, balanced landing can be used on any map too, this tree hugging perk can’t, you’d HAVE to get a map with trees which can’t always happen like how the requirement for the other perks can
---
Yeah man, spirit got all the attention but this one is equally as good
---
Console
---
I just think ruin needs a nerf in general. It doesn’t do what it says it does. When you miss a great skill check with ruin, the gen gets a regression penalty but also you can’t make any repair progress for three seconds. I think this is because when you blow up a gen the same thing happens and they’re just reusing it. Still it should just regress the gen and you can keep working on it.
---
Why nerf ruin? I would say instead of adding time to gens just make it “Ruin” instead of “Hex Ruin”
---
Fair enough, because lets look at other generator-regressing perks like thanatophobia or huntress lullaby. They're not as effective in doing their jobs as ruin is (lullaby does better as the game progresses but it's a hex), and Thanatophobia just increases the time needed for a gen to be completed, which to some extent hinders survivors but not to an alarming degree. 
---
maybe either of those needs a buff? i'm not sure
---
For killer: Spirit Fury &amp; Enduring
---
For survivor: Head on &amp; Quick and Quiet
---
Monitor with infectious fright on Michael is a godsend combo
---
dude you are never going to be able to control what people say lmao so why waste your time on it?
---
No BNP, at least, not like it was before. There is no gen rushing, it's literally doing the objective. You just don't put enough pressure on survivors.
---
True, I just had a game in which a bill used his dead heard and on my screen he went to the right and disappeared and reappeared on the left.
---
nerf totem locations
---
What's cringe about it. She begged for mercy so I let her have hatch. Won't be happening anytime soon again I assure, but I felt a little merciful since she dropped that medkit. Without doing that I would have ended her like I ended her friends. I play to win, not kiss babies. And winning to me means a 3k-4k as fast and dominant as possible, not that silly ass pip system.
---
I played the game with my friend for the first time. I usually do killer but I kinda get how to play survivor. And I was giving him a bunch of advice on how to play the game an then the fucking nurse teleported into us and I just screeched "forget everything I just said and run."
---
The one that counters bt is more annoying imo
---
Definitely
---
Pop is amazing but it’s very skill dependent and thats why others don’t run it lol. 
---
Thanat was amazing on its first buff but then they nerfed it, but at least it’s still better then what it’s used to be. 
---
I just feel if they make perks better it may be interesting because of new builds and some peeks may be better then what we have now.
---
[deleted]
---
If you're good you can break away from them even if they are.
---
A good proportion? Like 80% of them use it on ps4... i use small game just because of this.
---
Thank you! I was thinking of Unnerving, oops.
---
Iron will
---
the issue with increasing generator time is doing gens is boring. no survivor wants to be doing gens for any longer then they need too.
---
survivors need a second objective, like finding fuel cans or something.
---
I mean, a killer only gets hit by it if they tunnel so it’s a fair perk
---
Im getting steve to p3 just so i can pair the bloody face with the scoops outfit to look like he did at the end of season 3
---
It's freaking hilarious and I'm in agreement. If there was no possibility of the timer going and no way to get out without disconnecting then this would be a shitty thing. But they happened to corner two survivors in a small spot with the timer going. There is absolutely no reason for them to just let them go. 
---
Is it a cheap tactic? Yeah, but the killer isn't wrong for doing it.
---
Why are you brigading me?
---
This has been happening to me too! I'm glad someone else is talking about this!
---
To be fair you also get punished for landing it since 4 seconds is an absolutely ridiculous amount of time to stare at your hands.
---
I don't there's a single killer perk that is used and is so necessary on killers as Ruin. And it's ridiculous because Ruin is also a shit perk. I think one of the biggest issues in this game is the speed at which games can go, and it would be an overall better experience if the game was slowed down and balanced appropriately. It honestly says a lot about the state of the game when such a terrible perk is a requirement for some killers, especially slow ones or ones that require setup. Huntress, Trapper, Hag, M1 killers. Imagine if you freed that one perk slot up, imagine how much more variety in perks the game could have if some perks were simply..built into survivors and killers.
---
I'm an xbox player -_-
---
And I simple stated my experience, my game runs smoothly
---
Fine, it works on walls too.
---
Happy?
---
What?
---
Get leatherface. Its only like 3 or 4 dollars since its just a killer and bbq n chili will help with future bloodpoint grind.
---
That was.. I suppose ok so long as it was that person's first time doing that in a while. There's just nothing in for a killer giving hatch. We lose points and might even lose a pip. Blame the devs for that backwards ass pip system. There should be a "surrender" option where a killer isn't punished if he gives hatch..
---
The same with deliverance, if you get hooked first. Then the perk becomes useless
---
How long is a normal hit stun time?
---
Mending goes way too fast and takes too long to apply. They're already done by the time Legion moves their slow ass to the next survivor. It doesn't slow the game down if you spend just as much time doing nothing as the survivors.
---
It would be Pop if people where skilled enough.
---
Pop the weasel is amazing but it's good for killers with good map presence as it's good for damaging one generator at a time. By the time you've finished chasing a survivor and have damaged the gen, there are other survivors at the same repair progress that would most likely finish befor you get to them.
---
We're Gonna Life Forever and We'll Make It with an altruistic offering
---
Like 2.5 maybe 3. It changes with add ons.
---
Lithe and balanced landing are situational but they give you more control of when you can use them. Sprint burst should only be used if you have nothing else. Dead hard is phenomonal if you can use it right
---
I've had only good games do this for me.. it really sucks that it happens at all
---
Just admit you didn’t think this perk through lmao
---
Do you play killer? place one of this in a good window and gg. Im a killer main and my survivor rank is higher because of how hard it is to play a normal killer
---
How is it even remotely skill dependent when you literally hook someone and kick a gen? People don't run it because it forces a playstyle where you have to kick a gen, but sometimes the one you need to kick is far away and you waste a ton of time going to it. Sometimes you go to a gen to kick it and you find a survivor, and you'll lose map pressure because you decided to kick the gen instead of chasing the survivor. None of which justifies the regression. It's a good perk on paper, it's just shit in a lot of ways in practice, none of which has anything to do with "skill"
---
Unless you get unhooked, the difference between this perk and “tree hugger” is that deliverance can be used every match but OPs perk can only be used if you get a map with trees which isn’t always guaranteed
---
He looks kinda hot this way honestly.
---
Yes but if you are good you can do more dmg then Ruin has ever done lol. 
---
Sure there’s instances where ruins never found but that rarely happens. With skill pop can be used longer and do oh so much more then Ruin ever could. 
---
It was also buffed to 60 seconds so it’s manageable.
---
You don’t need to have good map presence with 60 seconds lol wtf. You just need to be a good killer in general.
---
Less than 4 seconds with no black screen or loud yelling to cover a survivors escape. You can also see blood and scratch marks on a normal hit.
---
Absolutely not. The game already has enough time spent holding m1.
---
????  She has both her toes.
---
Yep no worries. I wasn't being a dick I was just trying to let you know. Lol
---
Gotta respect that ghostbob and Sam Loomis
---
Iron Will &amp; Lightweight. Good for chases.
---
And that’s why Steve is the best babysitter ever!
---
I mainly meant the perk will deactivate if shes phasing to you , since the husk doesnt activate spine chill as far as i know. Like those spirit pallet mindgames where you dont know if shes pretending to phase, youll know that shes pretending because spine chill deactivates. 
---
The change you suggest sounds like a good change
---
Ur hot
---
The short hair? Yes. The Outfit? no thank you.

All those Survivors without it must be very confused why I wait until I’m breathing on their neck to take a swing
---
You shoudve seen Ghostface on the PTB when he was bugged and survivors could break him out instantly and when he made a sound while stalking. Literally the only way to use his power was to hide around a corner after a hook.
---
Like an hour after I made this post, I tried to compensate for the ds skill check latency...and missed because it was super responsive.
---
It isn’t, check out their other perk “ideas” for yourself, they’re all just as bad
---
They should increase the options in the Shrine of Secrets. Since they keep adding new Perks with new killers and survivors, the grind is becoming unbearably long even if you do have enough Shards: It could take months to eventually get the perk you want.
---
Press Spacebar to hit the skillcheck.

From one of the links you posted.
---
I dont play killer.
---
And as survivor, this is my experience
---
I love playing against Billy on Coldwind. If you can’t beat me with him on his best map, it’s time to find a new killer to main. If you’re up against Billy use jungle gyms, windows and T/L walls against him. His saw is deadly in open space or if you block yourself into a corner.
---
Lol wtf when this dude gonna leave the sub
---
So dont be surprised when people have different experiences.
---
I mean holy fucking shit she now uses a sword lol. 
---
I think it looks awesome but damn that’s sword lol.
---
legit cant wait to get my hands on this. First of the skins ill get for sure
---
Hag: No one will ever unhook you with this trap!
---
Steve: (laughs from above you)
---
For other perks you have to get the right conditions. Not always gonna happen. But I also think this perk would cause alot of new bugs.
---
Its 4m and has always been that way afaik.
---
Edit: just looked at wiki, it says reduces tier 2 by 4m but increases tier 3 by 8m. That might be where you got 8m from.
---
She didn’t rage she disconnected. She was in the middle of a vault animation when it happened
---
Part of making a suggestion is accepting others people's input. You made realize wall climb is a good addition.
---
If the killer is intent on tunnelling you and wants you dead, you are dead unless he is a potato. It has very little to do with skill. At low ranks everyone is "skilled" to some extent just from having played the game to get to that level.
---
Because they are too shy.
---
Mmm childish humor towards Slashers I think not.
---
I main nurse and find it too easy to win. And no, placing it in a window isn't the end of the world.
---
if you are hit, the period of speed you can run through
---
What map doesn't? They all do.
---
You are quite right lol.  I cut a plastic sword from the halloween store and some velcrow on a wrist band.  Definitely gonna improve that one in time.

This is the best reply in the history of replies, possibly ever.
---
on the one hand some games shes no trouble but on the other hand i have a bear trap on my head the whole game and just cant seem too get it off my head no matter what. so not great but suuuuppper annoying at times
---
Oh don’t I mean I think it looks even more fucking awesome. Lol.
---
Whatever ill just delete everything fuck this game
---
Yeah, something that requires more effort than spawning on a map in direct view of a clear as day lite totem is far too much work apparently. Gotta keep those totem cleanses as low skilled as possible. Three years in and survivor mains are still acting like the devs haven't made finding and cleansing them so easy that a 5 year old could do it.
---
For me it’s the spirits that camp. They usually stand far enough away where their heartbeat is gone but the second you are unhooked phase back and down you straight away.
---
Swiggity swooty 🐷
---
Yeah they’ve all got walls but what about the doctors map? No wall high enough to hide on, the idea of it is just bad
---
so friendly and sarcastic?
---
But those other conditions can be met on any map, for this perk it can only be met on some maps
---
I have no idea but they just won’t learn that they don’t have good perk ideas
---
Same here :-/
---
That would be his mori
---
lmao
---
Looks like a sarcastic person.
---
And like I said sometimes it wouldn't be useful
---
Not a shitpost? 
---
Eh horrible suggestion. Now a ogre or swamp monster sure but shrek no.
---
Perk: Swamp Scare, if a survivor is hit, this perk causes the survivor to suffer from the Mangled status effect. This also applies the Exhaustion status
---
No the guy this happened to said that the pig kept them there for an entire gen and waited for the exit gates to get opened. They were being an asshole, not desperate for some kills.
---
Why is so much of your recent post history posting ridiculously stupid perk ideas? You’re the guy who had the post about a perk to kill killers lmao. You also have one where a survivor turns fucking invisible, teleports, or *transforms into a fucking generator*. 
---
This perk idea is beyond fucking broken and stupid. Imagine running this perk as Legion? You would literally completely shut down the game. Any survivor that encounters a Legion would immediately leave. If someone runs No Mither, the rest of the team is no handicapped with a useless player. If someone runs Resilience, the perk is now useless. Plague? Now god tier killer.
---
This perk idea is fucking broken, and stupid.
---
freak lol she’s a video game character
---
I put shitpost flair idk why it changed, but shrek would be a lovely killer
---
Bruh moment
---
In the center area, the only place balanced landing can be used, there are walls high enough.
---
Pokemon trainers be like
---
Ah well this changes everything doesn’t it lol.
---
That would just make sloppy butcher obsolete
---
I also have my LPT that got me 4 k upvotes and two silvers.
---
Discordance and Surveillance on Freddy. Yes, feed me free information as to where I should teleport to.
---
Nothing compares to 4 insta heals. Most balanced thing in the game.
---
Yeah true, I just threw this together honestly
---
One of the top 3 wastes of the god pallet I have seen, good show
---
Since I have good posts, perhaps it's not that these suggestion posts are bad, but that other users are wrong when they think they're bad.
---
Oh believe me, I agree 100% but it was just an idea for whatever mom is now lmao
---
You basically always want to cater to the killer being spirit mainly because a spirit counter build works with other killers but if you dont have a spirit counter buiod against a spirit youre totally fucked.
---
How are you?
---
I don't believe you are really laughing your fucking ass off
---
Nice seeing you again buddy! I’ve kept my user name from there too. And yikes, are features still reposts from r/dankmemes ?
---
Ok you’re at a 7, I’m gonna have to ask you to take it down to at least a 3.5
---
*Cries in rank 15*. I'm a much higher rank on xbl but some reason on steam I'm a potato
---
Expect this game is super broken and is almost impossible to “put enough pressure” with every killer that isn’t spirit or nurse in red ranks. How in the hell should I stop a sweaty swf with toolboxes and brand new parts with pig? Seriously all these down voters and I bet my ass that not a single one of them as ever player killer in red ranks.
---
What a world... Survivors not playing against killers with broken addons are toxic, survivor playing with their best addons and items are also toxic

That is the most garbage take I’ve heard all week lol. You just used a post that got awards as an example of you having good posts, but that’s in a completely different sub. Completely different topic. It’s a LPT. 
---
Maybe in other subs you make good posts, but all your ideas on DBD are fucking moronic. And then you really convince yourself everyone is wrong when you consistently get downvoted with this stupid shit. Please stop posting this garbage, your ideas are so blatantly fucking terrible it’s insane.
---
Try getting Myers achievement where you need to tombstone all 4.
---
That barber from child’s play 3 got to him
---
For me ghostfaces are just assholes not campers tho
---
I never knew features were stolen off of Reddit so I don’t know
---
I always have tenacity and killers would always have the fear of DS. Not always but at higher ranks the more fearful of DS. Also being a slug with tenacity is super fun, the speed of crouch the visibility of a sloppy floormat.
---
We all start somewhere do we not
---
New idea for the devs (not gonna happen, lol) : have a fifth perk slot that is auto-filled in fonction of which killer is against you. 
---
Or/and
---
Have only three selectable perks as killer and four perk levels depending on the survivors team (example : full Dwight will be "countered" by Iron maiden if unlocked or by the crow perk, at level 3 with crows alerting you when they are two on a survivor for the last and a reveal when they are in the locker for the former)
---
It was at rank 4 :(
---
Yeah I don't have the same luck as you. Regardless if I am obsession or not, I get picked up immediately.

---
This right here is such a meta build on the Plague. You should replace NOED with Devour. At least you can use your insta downs after 3 hooks instead of wasting time for Make your choice to come off cool down.
---
Theres a ping reader in the game, youre one of "those people" that this sub makes fun of for getting so tilted from their own mistakes that they send direct messages and texts to express themselves.
---
I agree on you on this one. This game is really broken and that bring frustrations to both parts that become toxic behavior (such as dcing) as result, at least in my opinion.
---
interesting buff to Object of Obsession &gt;.&lt;
---
Fair point actually. That LPT post did get me banned... so I don't actually have any ground to stand on here.
---
False. They both camp equally.
---
I get picked up a lot! Its just feels good when I dont
---
It’s just a matter of applying pressure properly. If you notice your gens are getting smashed out, you need to focus on patrolling 3-4 of them in the end game in order to maintain control.
---
Never call a game early, a win or loss is never secured, ive been fooled and ive pulled games from the mud as both survivor and killer.
---
What
---
They have to make it so people get tired of waiting so they spend more money.
---
So don't apply arbitrary rules to yourself based on some dumb sense of honor.
---
By arbitrary, I mean *very* arbitrary, by the way. The same people that flame "tunnelers" have a chance of flaming you for just using ruin.
---
I think there should be a gen speed decrease based on how many people you que up with. Not like 2x as long but maybe like 133.3% longer with one person and for every person it increases it 33.3%
---
He lookin kinda fresh do not gonna lie
---
Yeah it does feel good unless you don't get picked up because your team is getting slaughtered in seconds right next to you. D:
---
You only got 3 kills against a good swf? That’s still pretty good. You can’t get a 4K every game, sometimes they are just better
---
Bond is evetything you need as a solo. 50% faster gens and hralijg, security, possibility of pallet saves.
---
Killers rely on it because most can’t move around the map fast enough to apply pressure. Some killer powers restrict you to 115% the entire game.
---
D:
---
Ok. Then it doesn’t matter if anyone Lewds her because she is fictional. Thanks!
---
So you lied about there being walls that weren't high enough in certain maps.
---
Facing a legion with sloppy, thanatophobia, and filthy blade is literally the worst killer to play against. His power needs a rework
---
From the looks of it is in your muscle memory and you are quick to do it. Explains the selfish care as well.
---
Camping is a good strat depending on the situation
---
Unbreakable and tenacity, when it works it works
---
Teleport and invis exhaustion perks lololol
---
I was gonna say...
---
Not that your complaints are unreasonable or unfounded, but I gotta say nice job! I’m lucky to get one kill against SWF. I’m dreadful. XD
---
Are you a killer main? Could you explain why you think so?
---
y'all keep acting like bugs that have existed since the start of this game, are caused by the dedicated servers.
---
The person said their character looked totally fine to them. Nurse didn’t see it either. Just me.
---
Some context: Game started 3v1, played for a good 5-7 minutes and while I was looping the huntress, the hillbilly appeared out of thin air. Also the Huntress didn't sing her lullaby at anytime. And the game crashed after I died.
---
Actually never saw this before so thanks! Also nice avengers meme
---
And then you proceed to see none of them until it goes away.
---
It's a lot more fun than an instadown from across the map.
---
It would be cool if it gave you a movement speed buff but i know that's kind of overpowered
---
Maybe but I feel that might be a worse version of vigil and vigil is pretty mediocre
---
Ohhhh yes
---
My boyfriend and I always joke about Spirit’s animation in post-game as it looks like she farts and runs. 
---
Also, we firmly believe that the Clown uses bottled farts so there’s a silver lining there, I guess.
---
Myers, sure.
---
Trapper, maybe. 
---
Clown, though? He's kinda terrible. 
---
There are only, like, five killers that are definitely worse than Pig.
---
* Clown 
---
* Wraith
---
* Legion
---
* Bubba
---
* Doctor 
---
Pig can mindgame short loops, buy time, and sneak up on people.
---
#giveAshbackhisboomstick
---
Sometimes you don’t because you’ll be staying in one area forever and waste time. Sometimes it’s better to move on the get stuck in 1 area for too long.
---
I ran this with an ebony mori to get the achievement. Good sports, not a single disconnect.
---
My friends and I say this too 💀💀
---
A survivor can't block a killer in a way they can't get out though. You just have to hit them. From a survivor bodyblocking is pretty intentional to prevent them getting to a hook or catching someone injured they are chasing. It isn't really the same thing at all.
---
edit: I just realized you meant other survivors sandbagging you to get you killed. I don't think that needs to be changed, it is already considered a reportable offense to block in your teammates intentionally.
---
I'm so happy this has been turned into a DBD meme
---
Context: As soon as the EGC hit us, Legion started securing kills by tunneling us individually. I was her second target. With most pallets being gone, she eventually caught up to me. What I didn’t expect was Mxvell, a random teammate, to go all Batman and attempt to rescue me TWICE and then tanking a hit for me too. The EGC Timer was running out too, so I wasn’t being too optimistic. Honestly, I don’t even know if I would’ve come back, but he did. He didn’t even escape when he got hit the first time when most would’ve just bailed (I didn’t know he was coming back, I considered myself dead and didn’t bother to recover). And it worked out. Thank you, Mxvell. &lt;3
---
If you know how to use it, you'd be suprised.
---
It really is muscle memory and I'm trying not to do it as often, but it's difficult. I use self-care because i don't like having to rely on teammates and it's a perk so might as well. Think what you want im not the best team player but im trying.
---
;)
---
Nothing apart from the characters base perks basically
---
Well Michael Myers is a character in the game so yeah it does have a place in the dbd sub
---
buddy you can’t control peoples mean thoughts and what they say, and you’ll never be able to. it’s not cynical it’s just reality lol
---
Looks like someone’s been shittin in the tall grass
---
Except for baby dweets
---
So now you’ve changed it to “get on top of things” you really are just winging it at this point, throwing out the simplest of concepts and then just adding onto it once you realize it isn’t a well thought out perk, you do realize that climbing a tree, climbing to the top of a wall, and getting on top of supply box things doesn’t fit with the rest of the game right? There are already lockers to hide in and corners to hide behind, there’s no reason to add all of this random stuff within one perk or even at all for that matter
---
Yet a bunch of people bitch in post game chat. "Why didn't you just give me hatch?" No one gives a fuck it you feel condescended, they are doing you a favor. They're taking points away from themselves and giving it to you. You don't have to thank anyone, but don't be pissed AND take the points anyway.
---
If it bothers you so much, don't jump down the hatch. But if you're going to do it and be like "bg I don't need to be saved" then you're just an ass on all fronts.
---
What is broken? The game is in the best state i've ever seen. looks like newb laggy killers cant kill anymore kek
---
Ohhh ok that sucks I was saving all my new parts and tool boxes and stuff but I guess I'll just use them.
---
They’re all so bad and make no sense but he seems to stick by them, I hope this guys a troll because he just refuses to see reason or how ridiculous his perk ideas are
---
Thank you for the info! I guess I just gotta git gud :)
---
/r/confusedboner/
---
Thank you for telling me! I haven’t watched the movies yet, I may eventually though. However I can get a bit squeamish… :|
---
So does my group lmao.
---
Looks just like the in game susie. Probs as harmless too
---
I just played my first game as her for a daily and didn't know her walking sounded so moist. Can survivors also hear the *plap plap plap* like she's slapping a handful of spaghetti against the ground? Cause hearing that getting closer is probably more terrifying than the traps.
---
I like seeing the absolute downvote storm on his comments trying to make them sound good I must admit
---
**Platform: PS4**
---
**Ingame:**
---
- While playing against The Doctor, Survivors will be unable to perform the Snap Out Of It action. Pressing the button does nothing (the progress bar flashes and then stops, offering no progress). This results in being unable to do anything for the entire match. 
---
**Menu:**
---
- When searching for a match, multiple error messages appear (ex. Host Unreachable, Join Game Failure, Disconnected from party, etc.) but you are unable to cancel searching or back out of the lobby searching screen to the main menu. Game has to be restarted in order to search again. This bug is extremely time consuming and is happening to me constantly when trying to find Survivor games specifically.
---
The killer is friends with the Meg and the Meg is just giving him locations of all his teammates. 100% griefers/exploiters.
---
Survivor refusing hatch now that brings a tear to my killers eye
---
I like Nancy more tbh she cute
---
It’s very goreporn so idk man maybe wait or watch at your own risk lol. 
---
If you want to see a guy do killcounts and explain movies look up deadmeat.
---
Well, you (the killer) lose out on potential Bloodpoints for using the Mori too early, and you cut a Survivor's gaming experience into nothing. Down, Hooked, Camped, Downed, Mori'd is not a fun concept but it is a harsh reality.
---
*disgusting.*  
---
***breathtaking.***
---
This and the Clown are tops for me, can’t wait to get them.
---
Perhaps your right and you should cling to the wall. That sounds better, thanks.

Nothing against this beautiful character but he looks like he's made out of wax or clay
---
Yep, if you intend to prestige a character step one is cleaning out their inventory of everything you "saved for later" or planned on using
---
it's just you chief
---
I would argue that maybe this game could need a new objective for survivors. There's a reason you see very little variety of killers and their perks in high ranks, depending on the killer it's not so easy to just apply pressure. I like to play the pig, but it's so unfun past the green ranks.
---
I'ma have to disagree with that cuz oversaturated content is frowned upon and rather than adds to the quality of the sub, it detracts from the sub if anything.
---
The more I read about the stuff you post the more I’m convinced you’re an internet troll, there’s no way someone is this ignorant about how the game they play feels and it’s overall mood
---
Stealing stuff?
---
I honestly couldn't care less about your fake points
---
I love this

Idk about the internet issues but I can confirm the dead hard bug is back
---
You're welcome
---
“wow! Is that Michael Myers!? He’s so friendly. He’s just watching me.” 
---
*panic ensues*
---
I don't have Steve so i don't have bond but when i do ill try it out
---
Bond is a Dwight perk
---
You can walk incredibly slowly and nothing else for 4 full seconds.
---
If they could just tweek or rework clown, legion, doc and wraith I’d be happy tbh. Pig is still a solid killer despite her nerfs and is still a threat. The others are just so lacklustre
---
gonna be real, theres probably no switch players on this reddit and this is standard for people new to the game. No chat either so gl informing them lol
---
I fully disagree. I understand why you think that, but I disagree.
---
They are legit strats. Not effective, but legit nonetheless.

Platform: PC

Type of bug: menu
---
description: my new daily ritual resets after every game so I can't complete it. 
---
steps: not entirely sure, it just seems to be after I deleted an old ritual I couldn't complete, the new one keeps changing after a queue or a game. 
---
expected result: I get a new ritual for the day until it's complete. 
---
actual result: ritual continously changes and isn't consistent. 
---
reproduction: about 75% of the time it changes
---
specs: not at pc currently, will update
---
The game was just garbage in general. Walk around chasing the monster for 1 fight
---
Still better than the bowl cut
---
So good, I love when people put this much effort and thought into a chapter, not often chapters seem really well balanced all around
---
Stop making extra hit perks 2. Build up shouldn’t do anything towards generator speed, we have enough things in general to do that.
---
Being sacrificed shouldn’t reward you in general you died.
---
Lights out is actually not that bad of an idea I like this one. Maybe just have it to where if you hook someone instead of sacrificing in basement. Sacrifice in basement means this perk will never be ran really. Also not reset progress just take back progress by 10% at max.
---
Chilling gut should be a hex for starters 2. It supports Noed which is horrible.
---
Yeah, bhvr needs to update the tutorial or something. They finally fixed ranking on switch so I'm just hoping to outrank the new players. Maybe get back to red ranks like I am on Xbox
---
Legion is just a pain to play against just like doc. I’d buff mad grit and iron maiden but the concept behind them is cool. Discordance is probably one of the best perks in the game imo
---
ah
---
A killer very avid on staring at me for the whole time when i’m hooked.
---
It has too few of a content and little to no variance in gameplay. Also playing as a monster feels so bad, imagine a game where everyone always have instaheal. I left when the infinite orbital laser hack wasnt fixed for a month or so. 
---
On the other hand. Dbds perks and grinding is a big reason for keeping it alive.
---
holy fuck that quality tho
---
Hit him so hard you disconnected everyone
---
at this early your just fucking yourself by going that high lmao, gonna be long ass queues.
---
wait we have nice survivors? well thats new
---
Wow. I ask your for your reasoning and being civil instead; I get downvoted. You gotta love the Internet.
---
True. I guess in that scenario camping could work.
---
Hehe of course 😏
---
That happens all the time.. kinda basic video
---
Nope! It was the studio setting :D Really happy with how it turned out. Also because I'm a disaster at photoshop haha :')
---
Okay papi - when ;)
---
Wow you predicted this a long time ago damn
---
Perfect! Twins!
---
Thanks!
---
I could imagine Steve falling down and yelling Henderson!
---
Only prestige on your favourite killers/survivors, I wouldn't say it's worth it, but you do get achievements, so it's up to you
---
I mean if the survivors are playing like idiots (unhooking in my face w/o BT), then they’re gonna get tunneled. I’m not going to reward you for playing bad.
---
Give her a smoochums for me
---
Well I was specifically talking about teabagging and purposely bm-ing . Specifically when a survivor does it to a killer . No need for it
---
I don’t tbag in any “competitive” game or online game
---
* Clown can force pallet drops quickly, but has no tool to play dropped pallets. Pig is the opposite; she can't force out pallets, but she can play dropped ones.
---
* Doc is terrible. Madness is a joke, and not only is shock therapy buggy, but it isn't even that good when it works. Shock Therapy guarantees a hit if you land it when a survivor is approaching an area where their only option is "vault". If "run around the loop" is an option, you also don't get a hit.
---
* You're overrating Thanataphobia just a little bit. Even if it's active at full potency for the entire match, it only increases the amount of work that needs to be done on gens from 400 seconds to 464. Assuming RBT's work as intended, and assuming it takes 30 seconds to travel between and search each RBT. According to [this graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jjijr87wbd), each time you force a survivor off the gens for 75 seconds you increase the time it takes the others to complete the gens by 18.75 seconds. Since you have four traps, that's an average increase of 75 seconds if all your traps are applied and taken off before endgame. That said, even though this is the best case scenario for Thanataphobia and just the average for RBT's, it's still super sad that Pig only barely edges it out. In any case, this doesn't make Legion better than Pig. Pig's dash is only situationally useful, true, but at least it isn't categorically useless for the entire second half of the chase, and she has stealth.
---
The Dark Knight theme started playing in my head.
---
And the nation of the cry babys attack
---
I mean anything sounds shitty when you talk like that. Is it really so hard to just contribute to a conversation in a positive way? Idk how to respond to this. Like, why be this way. Fuck man
---
Thanks for the constructive output. I hesitated to put only Altruist actions for Build-up, seemed not enough for me. 
---
And removing the self-rewarding for A new light is logical, although kinda sad considering the fact you're helping the rest by being sacrified and "occupying" the killer like that (doesn't activate when being mori/bled out). 
---
Noted for Lights out, but would tend towards 30% of current progress then. 
---
Chilling gut being a hex counters it's utility... There's only 5 totems in the map, and you're unlocking the full power only at 5 non-hex totems cleansed. And "supporting NOED", how ? Noed can only activate if there's still one totem up when exit gates are powered, and this perk is not efficient at all with Exposed effects, and full power means there's no Noed.
---
I would say its 50/50 actually just because of population differences. But because of how many more survivors you see it seems that the "toxic survivor main" mentality is more apparent when it does surface.  Sometimes a killer isn't trying to be toxic, maybe they're trying a new killer, new to the game, or are just having a bad day and want one hook/sacrifice and are perceived as a toxic asshat. But on the flip side a lot of killers are goaded into "being toxic" with t-bagging at pallets, flashlight clicking ~~i do hate when they bind it to scroll wheel~~ and dragging out the EGC when everyone is at the gate for a chance to t-bag, so when the killer acts toxic the survivors get mad and act toxic as well.  Its a two sided issue and neither side is at fault and simultaneously they are at fault for fostering the attitudes
---
It's a game, I have an objective as killer same as when I play survivor.  Its just some things that killers  and survivors do are hated by either side and since the game isnt going to change much neither is the "toxic attitudes". Shame really.
---
Had a match that was just that (told everyone multiple times no ruin… and the person popped the HG… their excuse, they thought it was ruin)
---
Exactly full power no Noed. Or other way around not full power and you still get Noed it’s almost a win win with having exposed 100% lol
---
dont know why you got downvoted when it is kinda true.
---
lol I love deadharding at the gate. Its probably the most useful time to use it.
---
It was fun until the killer ragedquit. I don't blame him. LOL.
---
Our savior
---
The biggest wtf part of it: the one who lived was nice. It was one of the dead calling himself op.
---
I agree it is crazy you lose your power for one missed hit. I think the lose it if you hit someone twice is fine though it should at least decrease the meter some to prevent survivors body blocking to knock your power out.
---
Were you there Friday? I think you're the Legion I saw and complimented in passing. I was Nero from Dmc5.
---
Nice job.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddxo45/three_sneaky_boys_vs_one_camouflage_girl_there/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I’m a rank 8 and I still get rank 20 teammates...
---
How do yo expect to lose in this game? Is the only acceptable death 4 people all in death hooks?
---
 I want to be killer main yet im rank 3 survivor and 6 as killer, due to how easy it is once you learn to loop combining pallets + windows. Tunneling and camping are options but doesn't always work. It feels like poop when im facecamped. But i try my best to be a Pallet City tour guide whem im tunneled
---
Oh my bad. This sound should be there. I thought you talked about the sound of a triggered trap.
---
I was over by that booth like 30 times on Friday. Didn't know they were giving out free pins! Bummer -_-
---
Build up is far too OP. 12% haste??? Good luck for the killer to catch you...
---
This is **THE** best cosplay I have seen for a while now.
---
Dang. You must have needed a crowbar to unclench your cheeks after that.
---
Sounds like good times
---
Good I guess I mean idk if that matters but congrats on rank 4!
---
In the a last halloween I bought the skin of the doctor and I never touch him again I dont go to make the mistake of buy a skin of a bad killer
---
lmao i will always think of clown gas as farts now thanks
---
Too bad... *distant heart beating noises*
---
It really makes me happy to read that..! I don't really know what to say eheh. Thank you so much❤️❤️
---
That isnt brigading, what? And it isn't targeted harassment, that makes no sense
---
That’s literally what the game was I don’t know why you think I’m being an asshole. You dropped into the map and then you followed the tracks of the monster quite possible going in circles the entire game. If you didn’t catch up to him in time they were too strong to beat. The overall pacing was just way too slow and don’t even let me get started on the balancing issues that plagued the game. Some monsters were just borderline broken. The concept of the game was interesting but they executed it so poorly
---
The kids dubbed it the Demogorgon after Eleven used a D&amp;D Demogorgon figurine to represent it during an explanation scene.
---
Tunneling means 3 other people are doing gens.
---
It's funny how I said this exact thing not even what like 4 days ago now? Something like that, and got downvoted for it. Lol.
---
The people in this sub are ridiculous.
---
Edit: 7 days ago to be exact.
---
thank you , i get gold evader most games unless i get tunneled , when i escape i usually get iridescent evader
---
but i lack at the objective (gold-sliver)  sometimes  due to hex ruin , i try to hit hex skill checks as much as i can but sometimes i can't risk cause i may click too early and bringing the killer to me ,  any advice?
---
How’d you get up there? Lol
---
No, that's not the case. Maybe if it only last like 30 seconds than sure. but it last 1 entire minute. I could down the rescuer with make your choice, and if I decide to chase the person with DS after, I get punished for it. It's really not fair in situations like that. I should get a free hook if the survivor runs away poorly, not stabbed.
---
Wow i thought this was a drawing
---
Man i wished they changed some of the killer add-ons like they did with BNP.... *TWICE*
---
This dude could teabag me any day.
---
Late reply but I haven't seen this before so thanks :)
---
This looks Awesome! I Love the blade!
---
Well if you play pc there’s a skill check simulator you can play if you want to get better obviously it will be boring. 
---
You can keep trying to go for greats maybe it’ll help you get better that way. Only problem is killers will probably find you. 
---
Or lastly just don’t hit greats and accept the regression. It makes the game longer obviously but at least someone’s doing a gen lol.
---
Salty survs downvoting*
---
I used one of the fingers as a base and just colored it in/added lines for detail.
---
Best personal bloodpoint offering, bloody party streamers gives everyone in the game a 100% boost to bloodpoints, so equal for you but also gives everyone else a boost,
---
Say sike right now
---
I never thought of it that way, now it makes sense
---
Thing is, you must get those cleansing yourself. Not that evident getting full power. Either 3 hex totems **or** 2 hex and 2 non-hex **or** 1 hex and 4 non-hex. So kinda balanced overall.
---
Ghostfaces always seem to have NOED or Rancor for me too, which seems pretty redundant...
---
It’s so Trippy from Micheals perspective, I had it happen and was like “What”
---
Hehe thanks c:
---
It's not like every DBD player is on this subreddit, fuck I've been playing for over a year and I only found this sub like a month ago. The memes... the beautiful beautiful memes.
---
Already did, they look nice, I've done some drawing too in the past, of Jason for instance, just haven't gotten in the mood to do a DbD related one
---
Better yet, shine a flashlight from above. Killer looks straight up to avoid the flashlight. Realizes they've made a terrible mistake.
---
Disconnect
---
Underrated post.
---
I love duping killers with this or Urban Evasion instead of Lightweight, it’s the most fun way to be immersed
---
High tier shitpost. Medium effort, and clever.
---
I hit 2 out of 3 hex skill check and then in like halfway through the gen the killer is on me 
---
Though toolboxes helps alot although i need a med kit
---
I thought about using technician for sometime after rank reset so I can train on hitting great skill checks even if I tap early it will get supprsed but o think it waste of perk slot
---
Stake out is great but doesn't help much
---
I imagine that'd be like a wild card of sorts.
---
No.
---
The condition of activation is an exhausted target that isn't affected by exposed. And it make a Deep Wound, it's not an immediate down. Noed is by itself OP, I just tried to give an alternative to salty killers that don't stop getting their Noed not proc.
---
Explanation would be appreciated.
---
Your opinion sucks.
---
No dbd cosplay sadly as I was repping my boy Nero from DMC5 (Devil Breaker is hooked on the side of my belt like in-game, just didn't show up well in the pic) for when I got to meet Johhny Yong Bosch.
---
But still wanted to sit around the campfire. Sadly none of my friends I was with played DBD so no SWF group photo for me. Just solo que :/
---
No matter how many hours I get into this game, Wraith still freaks me out every time. That stompity stomp bing bong boi always manages to get the drop on me.
---
Unlucky
---
I tend to save those when I play with friends since other survivors can be dicks honestly
---
yep its there. i get swamp a lot, with boat. i actually think it never lacks the  boat?
---
Who says you have to pick up the hooked survivor first?
---
I'd pay bigger money to see a corrupted grave robber be a killer
---
Either corrupted by the crimson court or the color of madness
---
Her blight darts would be interesting 
---
Pickaxe weapon, daggers that inflict mend, she could be stealthy, or have a pig style dash, plenty of things to pull from
---
What? How is that my opinion that’s literally why the game died at lunch lmao. Search up any review about the game and they’ll all be similar. Clearly you loved the game a bit too much and can’t look at stuff without being biased
---
I found it was better on the game map
---
Matchmaking  B  R  O  K  E
---
Not only are you creative but wise as well. Thanks for the comforting perspective 😁
---
A lot of dbd players are entitled.  It isn’t at all just survivors.
---
My personal opinion is that DBD is the best game in it's genre and most certainly worth the purchace, but ultimately that's your call.
---
The examples he listed is exactly why it flopped my man.
---
It was a great concept with the worst execution.
---
I could understand a different yet equally punishing thing like "each missed attack slows you down for x seconds"
---
Oh stop it you, haha! 😊♥️
---
As do I
---
Why he look like he got a big head
---
Then cleanse against her. It's not fair that an entire aspect of her power is shut down bc there's no reason to save yourself from the aspect she starts with. 
---
You shouldn't have the luxury to choose to cleanse. You should have to make a hard decision. Play a war of attrition, or make her stronger. The killer is the power role, not the Surviviors.
---
Wicked save!
---
You'll pick up most things as you go along tbh but if you plan to play survivor don't just hide the entire game cos it won't work out well since you won't be doing generators meaning the killer has loads of time to find you, yes it is with new chapters every few months usually, at higher ranks sometimes but starting off you won't notice that much I imagine and yes it's worth over F13 since you can pick if you wanna be killer or survivor and you can't kill the killer and the killer can't just instakill straight off the bat
---
I took the photo weird... I can not describe how mad I am
---
Or u can get gud and rank up to get better players?
---
I do this and survivors still treat me like shit.
---
Gee that's helpful.
---
Perfection
---
Camping is appropriate if its end game, if there's only 2 survivors left and one is on the hook, or if the team is HEAVILY altruistic and you know someone is going to go for the immediate unhook. That being said, it's an easy way to win, and a more talented Killer can get a 4k without camping.
---
Finally, that shit was rank
---
This is probably the best one I’ve seen, you even went as far as taking the photo in the middle of a vault, looks incredible
---
I didn’t say I “take the points anyway”. Fuck them and fuck the power dynamic; because they’re in a position to give something because of the built-in dynamic of the game doesn’t mean that giving it is a favor. I don’t want any part in their pissy popularity contest, and survivors shouldn’t ask for it or feel cheated if killers don’t hand them that. They aren’t doing me or anyone favors and no one needs their opinion, but they’re keen to give it as though it mattered
---
Killers: shut the fuck up and play the game. You’re not cool, you’re not like a good guy. Keep your social capital and your points
---
Which is why, I said, I wish bhvr world but the rights. They clearly have a better idea of how a game killer this should go. I didn't say evolve wasn't poorly made, I didn't say it didn't have huge glaring issues, all I said was that I miss the game. That's it
---
But everyone is such a fucking critic no one can stand liking something. Thanks dbd community, you continue to show why you're so great.
---
That’s the point. Inner strength rewards for cleansing, so it’s kind of warning killers to finish what they started
---
THAT is some Batman-level shit right there.
---
Toxic survivors, especially those ones who tbag after dropping any pallet whether it stuns or not. But oh how I love it when they get altruistic and try to body block me when I'm tier 3 myers
---
I like to use my decisive before I DC
---
Getting 3/4 and 9 hooks is a win in my opinion. You did well
---
Thanks so much!! c: Was actually a pain in the ass to keep the pose like that. Still want to redo it in a forest setting somewhere to get a better picture :&gt;
---
He looks like a qt tbh
---
Honestly, all devs had to do was rework Cold Dirt and Frank's Mixtape, then change deep wounds to terror radius affected. Legion would then be pretty fun as killer. I have no clue on how to get a fun Legion as a survivor though.
---
Yeah I guess so 😞
---
It has problems for sure man. Sometimes connection problems. 
---
Always check ping of lobbies and don’t be afraid to leave. 
---
It’s not very new player friendly either. If you are competitive then it could be good or bad. Bad in if you don’t care to learn to get better and good if you care to learn to get better. 
---
Playing killer can be the worst experience since it requires more skill and you get harassed a lot. 
---
Dbd community can be extremely toxic. 
---
It’s a good game for sure even with its problems but make sure you are fine with dying a lot and learning. If you get frustrated at death don’t play this game or any Darksouls games lol.
---
This game is way better then Friday the 13th. You actually can pick if you want to play killer lol. 
---
Friday the 13th is also as far as I know a dead game due to legal problems. 
---
Watch HybridPanda on YouTube he’s alright at the game he can hit rank 1 for sure but his personality is a good one. 
---
Always watching footage of games helps me decide if I want it.
---
When the bones do YOU
---
I play both sides, toxic killers piss me off more to be honest because most of the people who teabag I can manage to kill, although a full team of good swf teabagging and using really strong loops is probably the most frustrating situation for either side. I just really hate when killers slug during end game instead of hooking which is why that pisses me off more.
---
It just sucks that BHVR isn't gonna buff her.
---
I'm rank 10 with 56 hours so that's pretty good
---
Deliverance failed to deliver
---
Hey don’t be sad you look like a qt too
---
Man, just give it up. This dude is a moron lmao.
---
You too man.... you too
---
Love it, so wholesome. I had a poor ace, one person (highest rank by the way. Two higher than me) DC'd after I smacked him twice with Billy no less! Then when I downed the ace, a Meg runs up and gets my attention, I humor her and chase after and down her. Then out of the corner of my eye I see, what else but the other Meg. Who is injured, I smack her downing her quickly and hook both. Go back to the ace and pick him up to wait for the wimps to die. Drop him on the hatch and, lo and behold, he had the most bloodpoints
---
Sad thing is I suck as Billy and they only got two generators done. I actually felt kinda bad
---
This happens to me sometimes it happens and I’m never happy about it
---
This right here is why I rebound skill checks to M4. That and so I can have a hand free when I do gens.
---
I honestly don't think she needs any major buffs. Having all the survivors constantly be broken is actually incredibly strong. Especially if you use infectious fright on her, she is incredibly good at snowballing. Having a slowdown effect on sick survivors would make her a pain in the ass to deal with and just really boring frankly. I think a better option to buff her would be to make her apple add-on baseline. That way she always has at least 1 pool corrupted at the start of the game in case the survivors choose to stay broken instead of cleansing.
---
i think the same thing
---
I've noticed NOED proccing more often actually. Seems like people save totems to use inner strength rather than cleansing on sight.
---
I’m literally a killer main, and I understand that it’s not fun to play against an Ebony mori and die after your first hook. I believe it’s better to use it when the survivor would die anyway, but adding a cool cinematic :)
---
I agreed with you?  But okay.
---
Hope your weekend gets better.
---
Thank you for pointing out it was him so I could remove my upvote
---
Well that's the great thing about haunted grounds and ruin. They have to either 1) deal with ruin which sucks (at least in my rank) 
---
Or 
---
2)  risk destroying a hunted grounds totem and get downed fast.
---
She's well designed, watch fungoose he mains Plague. Its just hard to play as killer in general.
---
I'd rather go against survivors who teabag at every pallet than a prayer beads spirit with an ebony
---
That’s unfortunate, friend. Eventually survivors will return the favor for you being nice, I promise. :)
---
I haven’t caught very much of stranger things but didn’t the newest season have something to do with a D&amp;D Mind Flayer?
---
K sure bye!
---
That's so annoying. That usually happens when I've gotten 2 kills. The last 2 will do nothing but hide. Ive had that last 20 minutes.
---
Lord farquaad would be the new blendette due to height. Wouldn't even have to crouch
---
I’m not sure I think Mind Flayer May be mythological.

Me too, friend. Or a Spirit in general. Nothing against Spirit players. Just don't like facing her as a survivor.
---
Lol I need to get it for my last survivor achievement.
---
Actually that’s a lie I have to get the one where all 4 get out of hatch at once
---
If they ever add a voice chat, I’m going to run a 0 terror radius Myers build, purposefully derank, sneak up on Rank 20 Survivors, and start reading the Cock And Ball Torture Wikipedia article at point blank range. Will I win? No. Will I make them shit themselves? Yes. And bloodpoints can’t buy that satisfaction.
---
"GIMME BACK MY 11K BLOODPOINTS DANG IT!"
---
Whats an RBT? Really Borrowed Time?
---
It’s because T-Posing asserts your dominance over all other fully animated plebians.
---
I had an Adam yesterday who pointed at me after every pallet he dropped even though not one hit me and was actually a 360ing god on console. It was so satisfying to kill him. I didn't tunnel him or anything, but his teammates were 3 Claudettes so it was hard to find someone other than him.
---
My friend had the same thing happen. Must be a bug
---
It’s stupid to think that hiding in a locker to hide from the killer in a situation like this isn’t smart. In this case meg wasn’t even taking agro, she straight up pointed to the locker while OP was trying to hide. Immersion has its ups and downs.
---
Troll.
---
^^^ tea bagging when they don't even stun is very annoying
---
Swings at what?
---
both piss me off the same amount
---
I just had a Jake who was doing pretty well all game. He opened an exit gate, and I hooked his last teammate in the basement.
---
As I went to the gate I saw him going back for the person, he dropped a pallet, teabagged, ran square into a Hag trap in the middle of nowhere and died.
---
Then you feel bad knocking them down again. I literally drag them to hooks, and shake a no half the time.
---
effectively having noed for most of the trial is pretty strong. what could be interesting is the plague gets stronger the more she sickens people. survivors could also undo her powers by wasting time (maybe by cleansing?) 
---
the problem, as you probably know, is that she is so strong after cleansing its not even worth it. the punishment for cleansing should be lessened so that its actually worth it to go out of your way and waste time cleansing instead of just genrushing.
---
Improve skill against an ebony? Moris literally take no skill.
---
Off a tangent here, but it seems to me like everyone who says “reported” is straight up stupid considering the action has no value on console...
---
Troll
---
It's a shit idea when the devs promotes swfs
---
:(
---
It would only work on Survivors who camp generators and so long as they just ditch it and run it should be fine though I think only having a range of 20 or 18 is good enough
---
I found this on twitter
---
The first one would make it nearly impossible when you get down to the last gen
---
I talk to myself a lot during solo play so when I capture videos and get another surv teabagging in them you can usually hear me say "oh, that's so rude" to no one at all.
---
Yeah I know it’s just sometimes survivors don’t have time to run away or they don’t know where killers at so they hide until killer runs away from there gen. 
---
But it would make no sense to have a cooldown lol. Maybe it’s good. I mean killers always need some good perks.
---
In order for something like this to work it needs a secondary ability that helps in either of the 2 main things that can determine if a killer is good. Chase power and/or map pressure. A killer who’s power is just disguise as survivor and get a hit is garbage on its own and would be no different to a normal stealth killer like pig or ghost face.
---
Keep in mind, not always the killer d/c, I have video clips of people d/c ING during mori, and messaging me about how I am trash for disconnecting...
---
Its important to establish what a slug is by the way.
---
Slugging is **not**:
---
- Leaving 2nd last on the ground to find the 4th and secure a 4k.
---
- leaving 1 person on the ground 
---
- leaving 2 people on the ground
---
Slugging is and is only this:
---
Attempting to have survivors in dying state before hooking.
---
Thankfully mine doesnt change after every game, but it does change.
---
It's out of dumb ideas that DBD went to be succesful, so...
---
It's their realisation that is important
---
We need some anti chase perks as we don't have many and we need new killers with strong Chase potential.
---
Clown was clearly meant to be good at chases but he sucks at that role.
---
Thats not slugging, dont worry what survivors say.
---
nice ds
---
Yeah this is a pretty good summarisation of what is toxic on both sides.
---
Its basic, but accurate.
---
Most survivors at high rank are unlikely to get trapped by the 3 gen Strategy and even if they do they'll just have a teammate who's good a looping distract the killer so they can finish the gen
---
You have AT MOST 4 seconds of stun, and in exchange you get 5 fucking blinks. You then can use your power straight away.
---
Legion ALWAYS has 4 seconds of stun and in exchange has a worthless power. They then cannot use their power for 20 seconds. So in reality my friend, it is YOU who has nothing on fatigue times and missing.
---
Shouldn’t the text boxes be flipped?
---
Well he’s good at chases if you use him right but he doesn’t have good map pressure.
---
We just need good killers and old killers buffed same with perks on both sides.
---
You yourself spam meme "perk idea" posts. Take your own advice.
---
but still though
---
this was already posted days ago
---
Same only been getting killer challenges. Every time a survivor challenge loads up and I go and complete that challenge it bugs out and almost always changes to a killer challenge. I've also experienced survior challenge bugging to another survivor challenge like "--- secs of co op action" to "Escape with Nea"
---
honestly been really annoyed about it that I stopped doing challenges since they keep bugging out
---
On reddit?
---
You seem like a fun person.
---
Yeah
---
lol start bringing Haddonfield offerings in as survivor and see how many killers don't magically ~crash~ everytime.
---
Sure, "overwhelming majority." I'm sure you also have the stats to back that up? And no, a bunch of comments saying they didn't like the servers is not evidence. It's been shown multiple times that reddit is a clear minority in the overall communities of things.
---
Also, everyone who played on the servers that had a great or just a decent experience with them probably wouldn't be vocal about anything. You're much more likely to make a comment saying "This shit sucks!" rather than "Hey, that was alright." And that's fine. They probably DID have a shit experience on the servers, and BHVR would need to know so they can fix it.
---
I'm guessing a lot of people had very mixed experiences but are just remembering the moments they got hit through pallets and windows rather than the times they didn't. I played a lot of both killer and survivor, and had games that were great and games that weren't so great, where I got hit through every pallet or hit everyone through every pallet. But overall, the majority of my games felt fine. Like I was saying, I know my experience doesn't reflect what everyone experienced, but that's just how I felt about the servers. They obviously need improvement still.
---
People in general are acting like such shitters about this, whining to no end. They did a test, like they said they would. The test is over. They got the data they needed, and now they'll (hopefully) improve the servers more.
---
How dare Behaviour to make a good killer
---
I'm leaving 100%
---
Instant dc

Boomer from Left 4 Dead
---
"I accuse others of being killer mains because they disagree with me then I get downvotes for being a prick, what a weird place the internet"
---
Yep..
---
I have noticed it proccing less when its equipped yeah.
---
Your legs are killin it!
---
Nobody. But what about the other 45 seconds on their timer? If you’re playing Hag, a chase involving MYC tends to not last that long.
---
The thing is survivors suicide on hooks and always end up with 2 deads and 1 slugged. But still the idea of giving Freddy oblivious buff shouldn't be a thing coz he already is strong with the rework.
---
And there it is a rank 15 that can't loop
---
I don’t get it. Is he not liked I take it?
---
I agree she needs a buff though I don't agree with the way you want to buff her. Maybe have infected/broken survivors build her corrupt purge up over time. The more infected the faster the power builds. They can cleanse and she can gain it from fountains as well. Make the naturally gained corrupt be shorter duration than that gained from fountains. Also give her the ability to corrupt her own fountains. Have it so she can vile purge a fountain and then after 60-90 seconds it makes the fountain corrupt. Still allow survivors to cleanse at it in the mean time but it won't heal them fully in the mean time just remove the infection. Limit it to 2 max at a time and she can't corrupt the last fountain or while she has corrupt  purge up. Also show the fountain's aura in yellow to survivors while it is corrupting if they are infected
---
I'm just spit balling ideas and will admit I am not a great plague player. So maybe something here wouldn't work. I just feel the hindered effect to infected survivors could be snowballed with perks to basically stall all progress and the aura perk would be like having an always up BBQ. Now I know cleansing would stop those but I feel it's a little too much of a buff. I think the answer is with giving her a way to get her corrupt purge naturally without forcing survivors to use the fountains
---
You know, when a character T pose because of a bug in a serious game, it really cracks me up. Though when there is an intended way to T pose, like an emote, I find it dull and unfunny.
---
It's like, the humour comes from the glitch being unexpected and out of place. So I get what you're saying, this trend to force the T pose, to force the unexpected, is not clicking for me either.
---
When you know you're doomed. 
---
At least 2 or all 3 of your team mates will just play hide and seek while you're getting endlessly chased and tunnelled.
---
Horrible and brain dead teammates are way more annoying than toxic killers
---
He doesn't make the memes, he takes them then watermarks them
---
You have a valid point, but it’s the fact that both me and my friend are both disconnecting at the same time and are both having the same problem. I just think it’s less likely that it’s the game rather than the killer themselves. Plus it doesn’t happen like every game it’s just here and there which makes me think it’s the killer rather than a network thing.
---
Spooky
---
Happened to me but as Bill. Definitely a bug because I've done it multiple times with items and offerings.
---
I wanna say it's the killer unplugging his ethernet cord at the last moment.
---
This woulda been great with Shirtless Clown imo
---
WE have to put in work to make the game better?  Good Lord, please post that about an EA game and see how that goes.
---
I know a glitch t pose sure sometimes its funny.
---
But this shit. Its not funny especially when a person really does it
---
I played both but i get a diffrent feeling when playing dbd so i would say dbd is better
---
I completely agree. I had a teammate who only went for hook saves. Never did a gen or took aggro. The one time the killer found them, they managed to urban evade into the sunset. I looped and distracted the killer for 3 gens and got tunneled to death. My friend got out and she did too. Even though she hid and never even touched an exit gate or a gen.
---
I wouldnt leave because there is always a chance i can outplay a 4 man swf and get better as killer in the process.
---
I had a Ghostface hook me and constantly tea bag while camping me. Later got unhooked and other teammates were killed and I was the last one left. He left me to bleed out on the ground, the entire time just tea bagging away.
---
Feels bad man. Feels real bad.
---
Wait what there was a killer? Only saw 2 other survs :(
---
I'm  a girl and I'm pretty sensitive so it hurts my feelings when I'm playing killer and being fair and there's people being toxic for no reason.
---
She's already decent.
---
They need to work on making lower tier killers more viable instead
---
"A tinge of satisfaction from my black heart moved me"
---
Was the kinda cringe part
---
I see it as the survivor using what they have. Which is two health states, items and perks. The killer could have just picked you up at that. I find a killer who won't go ten feet from a hook more toxic than a survivor doing everything they can to stop a stronger opponent
---
If something is able to make Gandalf revert back to being Grey, then you should probably run as well.
---
Um depends. 
---
You mean looks? Just draw it and take a picture of it or describe the character in good detail. 
---
If you mean perk ideas or anything else just post what you think.
---
Congrats
---
Btw, is console really comfortable to play? Or you just don't like PC
---
1.4k player here and I really don’t understand how someone’s kiddish behavior can insult me. I mean, c'mon, should I really become angry or insulted just because some stupid kid is behaves like an idiot in a computer game? I never understood why people are so fond of raging because of such stupidity. I think community should cares more about bugs, instead of "oh no! This killer is stands and bang his head near me" or "Jesus Christ, this dude with flashlight clicks his mouse so fast that I need a theraphist now!".
---
It would be cool but swf :’(
---
As far as M1 killers go Plague is probably one of the strongest ones - you basically have permanent NOED, or supercharged hatchets if the survivors are cleansing. You just need to be patient and play around spreading the infection. 
---
Generally what you want to do is:
---
- Take Corrupt Intervention.
---
- Infect the open generators, then patrol around trying to find survivors looking to find generators.
---
- Focus on applying infection to as many survivors as possible (just tap the puke on them and then leave to find others)
---
Then enjoy having free NOED.
---
Best on Hawkins imo
---
Susie is 16 fyi
---
It's not about rage. It's that toxicity ruins the fun of the game.
---
Forget Franklin's, my goose can steal your key for good. And honk to make you blow up a gen on command.
---
It usually results in a teabag, but it’s a thank you tea bag. Which I appreciate
---
Me too me too!
---
**Survivors**:
---
&gt;Insta heals
---
&gt;Swf communication knowing where the killer is the whole time
---
&gt;infinities abuse by using balance landing in certain maps
---
&gt;have way more useful perks than killers
---
&gt;can finish gens in 3.10minutes and have no cool down like killers that after every hit/hook/ or action whatsoever needs to wait few seconds
---
&gt;Have a third person camera
---
&gt;One person can handle a killer for at least 30s per hit just by throwing pallets without playing them first
---
&gt;can be invulnerable using a perk
---
&gt;can be faster than the killer with several perks
---
&gt;can find/not lose any item when they survive
---
&gt;escape using the key
---
&gt;have total control of the game timer
---
&gt;can deny perks by Cleansing totems
---
I have more memes like these but would be boring 😊 I just tried to match your numbers
---
Add more pressure to map, and don't be afraid to rehook the injured guy. Its not your fault he ran back into you
---
They announced that they shut them down on Twitter
---
I wonder if this is on Console too!?
---
Ohhh thanks!
---
Yep, the 2nd and 3rd season did
---
Late to the post but, wow, seriously. Top comment said it best, I thought this was a painting or rendering of some sort. Great job!
---
Also you didn't get 9 stacks of dying light.....it tops out at 5 bro
---
Console has frame drops, but other than that, its not bad. Its definitely playable and fun. Also, the autoaim really screws with killer, but thats my only complaints.
---
Same here, the hands and killer utensil are what revealed the truth to me.
---
They smell like funnel cake and pickled sausage. Don't ask how I know.
---
He's right, though.  I've had this happen more since the last patch, and the game disconnects every survivor and the killer all at the same time.  
---
I had this happen last night and tried to call the killer out.  I thought he had rage quit because there was 1 gen left and he had no kills.  But we shared screenshots and his screen showed that all the survivors had DC'd.
---
Oh, okay. I still prefer PC over it, bc I'm more used to keyboard &amp;mouse
---
Are you on console ? Also I went Friday !
---
Ya that's fair, I mean in the sense they down you and dont hook you just to be a dick
---
Echolocation is a cool name for it.
---
I think it should be about 20 to 24 because as you said it wouldn't be as useful on big maps
---
I think Black Incense to be Base kit would be enough. She already is pretty strong.
---
I get this often on ps4 as well.
---
Yeah broken should be on all screen (plague) except when someone’s running no mother. 
---
Deep wound should stay on bt
---
Ya for what I'm referring to I just mean when you're the only one and they dont hook you just to be a dick, if they have a reason of course then its different
---
It really does just come down to personal preference. Although there isnt nearly as many frame drops on pc.
---
Hag doesn't have an anal sphincter, it was stripped with the rest of her skin when she was flayed. She does fart it just comes out like a deep forced exhale and you barely hear it, same as Quentin.
---
Yea i'm on ps4. And nice, I was there Friday as well. Did you cosplay?
---
Two of jakes best cosmetics have glasses!
---
PS4. If I enter without an item but escape with an item, the new item doresn't get added to your stock.
---
Working as intended I see
---
The mods love throwing the unrelated rule around. 
---
Unrelated. But here are 50 other subreddits about the game that you can post this in!
---
I think the servers are getting deleted... but slowly
---
Well if you’re talking about people with half a brain then yeah lol. 
---
Otherwise it wouldn’t work lol. 
---
Also you know people would say, hey are you approaching me man. 
---
Everyone else: Naw 
---
Guy: okay killers on me. 
---
Also don’t forget about the terror radius
---
I agree that The Doctor is weak right now, but I would be more in favor of the Devs just out right buffing his power.
---
Also, the original version of Deep Wound (The Bleeding Out Health State) didn't pause when within the Killers Terror Radius. Deep Wound doesn't actually do anything on BT anyways, and if the Devs removed it, then they could even buff it by giving it much shorter time (Ex: 10 seconds or 5 seconds). The main reason (I think) the Devs give Deep Wound such a long bleed out timer is because of edge situations like Snap Out Of It.
---
Anyways my point is in the long run, the Deep Wound would actually benefit from just being a effect from Feral Frenzy and not being an actual Status Effect.
---
I’m 99% sure it’s a no. Those cosmetics are staying exclusives to the 2018 Lunar event.
---
New to this subreddit and I read that he steals memes and watermark them. Pls drop the ban hammer reeeeee
---
There are many things survivors can do to bully killers. They will spam flash lights, body block hooks, tea bag every chance they get.
---
I mean it was supposed to be apart of just feral.  
---
And bt used to have just a timer lol. 
---
Also every killer besides the top 3/4 need a buff and all bad/unusable perks need a buff.
---
Honestly it's so good I thought it was a drawing.

KEKW is this exact guy as a twitch emote, he recently became a super popular emote. People use it more than LUL or OMEGALUL which were originally used for when survivors or the streamer fuck something up so bad it's hilarious.
---
I won’t tunnel, but if your still at the hook when I come back...
---
Not for me good luck with the channel though.
---
Still possible to stun demo out of that lunge, but the time is even more tight than stunning a billy mid chainsaw
---
Yes?

Praise the Entity.

Power is too weak. 80% mms is worse then the nurse.

Perk 2: not a bad idea 
---
Perk 3: almost useless 
---
Perk 1: I’m confused.
---
Survivor 
---
Perk 1: too strong
---
Perk 2: sure it doesn’t do much and it’s for endgame
---
Perk 3: Too fucking strong especially with Swf toolboxes and leader.

Thank you!

Remember when legion based on his trailer looked like that?

description of bug + how to replicate: when the legion applies the deep wound status effect on a survivor, the deep wound status effect will appear to not drain at the bottom left of the screen
---
It still wouldn't be worth an add-on slot IMO. Even if it was Common.
---
Applying Borrowed Time isn't that useful ability for Huntress' Hatchets. 
---
Sure they waste a little time Mending if you lose them, but for that means you're running this add-on hoping that you'll lose the Survivor you hit with your Hatchet or that a Survivor you hit with one of these Hatchets will have Adrenaline and use it up healing the Deep Wound instead of becoming Healthy so that your application of Borrowed Time can be meaningful in any way.
---
Now, if the Hatchets were like Legion and provided some other effect and applied Deep Wounds instead of damaging as a drawback for this other effect, maybe the add-on could be useful. But that depends on whatever that other effect is.
---
&gt;so you just learn to deal eventually
---
Hopefully I will. I started one month ago an I'm currently in rank 15.
---
It was a test. They never meant for them to stay on in the first place, unless servers miraculously *were* perfect. I think they knew it wasn't ready, though. They probably wanted data to confirm the projectile bugs were fixed, and probably also gathering server load data.
---
Feedback from the survey was probably irrelevant to the decision to keep the servers on or not (unless it was 99% positive or something). Peanits, a BHVR employee, said in a streamer's chat that this test was to gather data, and the servers would stay on "indefinitely" until they had the data they needed.
---
I appreciate the attention to detail on the weapon. Super impressive all around!
---
Cause minecraft references arent overused right? Pffft
---
I'm almost certain someone posted this months ago
---
Killers are generally very weak compared to Survivors, and Survivors will frequently disrespect them as a result. This isn't a horror game.
---
You’ve still got a long journey ahead. My advice is don’t stick to just one role. The only way to truly understand the reasoning behind the actions of survivors and killers is to play both roles extensively
---
Camping is never a good strategy. Good strategies don’t rely on your opponents making mistakes.
---
OMG, I laughed so hard to this, lol.
---
Nice! :)
---
It's the ONLY game in its genre. If we're counting dead games you'd need 4 friends to play, White Noise 2 is better, but I'm going to assume we're not.
---
These just got progressively worse oml
---
I am a legion main, and if you are complaining about missing attacks it's probably because you suck at hitting people.
---
your not wrong
---
They would definitely have to rework the game to allow slow killers like this to be viable, or just add a passive "gens take longer to complete" to their power.
---
&gt;I don't understand the relevance of "not a status effect"...
---
It means that you can still suffer the effect, but it won't appear as a Status Effect, but as its own unique thing. Status Effects are meant to be simple and versatile. The Status Effects I removed were either not versatile (Madness and Deep Wound) or just irrelevant (Hemorrhage and Vision).
---
&gt;Haemorrhage should be deleted and more frequent bleeding should become part of mangled... Blindness should also hide the red stain...
---
These are actually really cool ideas.
---
I faced against a scratched mirror Myers during the bloodhunt....nobody burned a map offering and the map was Coldwind. Really caught me off guard when I checked the killer's loadout at the end. I guess he decided to let RNG take the wheel for map selection.
---
Shh just go with it
---
The community is monstrously toxic on average, the developers are still developing content, but are generally flippant about game balance (which is heavily Survivor-sided at higher ranks, despite the large Killer advantage at Rank 20), it's pseudo-competitive while F13 is much more of a joking around game, but there is currently no other competition that's really a SLASHER game.
---
If you were on Steam, I'd suggest trying Deceit for free, or Identity V on mobile, but on console...you may have no other options, even if this one is painful to play Killer in much of the time.
---
Oh, it's also very grindy to start. The perks available to you are random, and many meta perks can only be gained with DLC or a lot of grinding and luck through the shrine, so you're at an objective disadvantage for a long time.
---
Probably not. Older event cosmetics seem to be staying exclusive to those specific events.
---
Amazing cosplay!
---
It’s not even a matter of subjectivity. It’s a matter of you failing to take into account a whole lot of factors when thinking of perk ideas. I personally think your perk ideas are interesting, however if they were to be put into the actual game exactly as you say... well, balancing issues would be prevalent.
---
For example: your skill check = downed one.
---
Alone, it’s an interesting enough perk, perhaps extremely punishing to new players, but let’s put that aside for now. If it we’re to be combined with other perks that make skill checks harder, it becomes a lot more powerful. I’ll be generous and say it *borderlines* being too powerful. Then combine that with the doctor, who’s base kit makes skill checks harder when you’re affected by madness, and you have a definitely too powerful perk.
---
Yes, gen tapping would counter it, however, forcing gen tapping would be... less than ideal, as nobody would want to play against this perk at all, and we’d end up with a way bigger DC issue than we currently have.
---
This is why we take account a lot of factors when thinking of perk ideas
---
Make the survivors change form randomly throughout the match.  Let the killer switch places with any survivor.  SWF would say "Killer switched with me" but it would put them super close anyway.  The way to counter it would be to split up, where you'd have to have MAJOR good communication to tell who is who.
---
Welp I guess I gotta keep trying
---
Sounds like the job so far is more pretty good than ever before.
---
Ok since you're too dense, I would say, implied. Is that better? At the end it's the same thing just in a  more sneaky way
---
You should also learn how to listen since you just took it like "you're always right as long you don't care what other people say". I understood you perfectly
---
Buy it, right now, don't wait another second. I'm an older guy and haven't had this much fun playing a game in well over a decade on console. People talk about players being toxic but that seems to only be the case on PC as I haven't run into anything but one nasty message on PS4 in the month that I have been playing. I'm definitely not someone who's into multiplayer games but this one has me absolutely hooked. I can only imagine it would be twice as fun if I had a partner sitting next to me to play with so you should have an absolute blast. Besides it only costs twenty bucks so why not?
---
The killer is the *power role*. That means they dictate the match, not the Surviviors. A coordinated group of Surviviors is meant to be a killers equal, not their superior. 
---
And Surviviors have been nerfed enough as is. 
---
There is counterplay to these changes and it's to cleanse when you get infected and avoid her when she has corrupt. Or suffer through the action speed penalty
---
Mori him
---
She's not decent. She's only good when Surviviors cleanse and barely any Surviviors cleanse.
---
Imagine getting salty over people being nice. People like you are literally the reason why this world is full of misery and despair.
---
Actually I chainsawed several of them
---
no worries just wanted to make sure they could find it since its such an awesome channel! james is the best
---
I mean, I’m a switch player.
---
Wdym
---
More gen time as a flat nerf would be painful. Add secondary objectives and/or make toolboxes not boost gen speed (no other item gets dual uses like that), but allow gen progression after failed Ruin checks (but not pops, with or without, and more checks may be triggered still).
---
I don’t see the issue here... They turned their camera to hit you with the lunge.
---
Slasher content is TRAGICALLY scarce, to the point where it's surreal. Although survival horror is certainly abundant, just without licensed characters.
---
Oh fuck yeah man. One of the best kill counters because he actually explains the movie and that’s one of the reason why I love him. Been watching him for about i think 2 years if he hit 2 years, I’ve seen all kill counts and love them. 
---
Even if I’ve watched the movie before which is about 90% of the time. I just love deadmeat lol.
---
If you want to "eliminate a survivor out of the game ASAP" there are ways to do that earlier without tunneling all match. You can use a Green Mori, allowing you to mori any survivor after their 1st hook. It's a strategy I use a lot against SWF as it greatly cripples then.
---
You should honestly never tunnel solo players as you're just ruining someone's game or even day because you want the match to be easier. I think tunneling and camping is only warranted when the survivors are all SWF. As a really good SWF will never die or give a killer an ounce of leeway.
---
All in all, just play the game for fun. Rank literally means nothing and being at high ranks is over rated. The only thing I prefer high ranks for is playing with players that challenge me. I like the aspect of learning new ways to mind game and play loops, so I dont get hung up on that 0 kill game where I honestly couldn't have played any better without tunneling or camping to guarantee a kill. 
---
Until separate modes come out for casual and ranked one day, you shouldn't really take the game all too seriously. It becomes so much more rewarding to pull off that stupid build that you thought of rather than running full anal beads spirit with an ebony mori, killing all 4 survivors before the 2nd gen is done.
---
it should be a stacking move speed to the survivior.
---
Just pump up your sneakers like Dave Chapelle in Robin Hood Men In Tights.
---
'scuse me honkies, I am running out of air! gotta get pumped!'
---
Then just sprint burst away.

Can't wait to see temp bans for that sht

---
The Entity must've really hated that chase in particular, then.
---
Ouch, scathing. They can “deem” it whatever they like, it doesn’t matter. Just because someone does something for you that they consider a favor doesn’t mean it needs to be reciprocated or appreciated, here or in our daily lives. That’s some nice guy bullshit abusive people spout when they’re bitter about being friendzoned, like “I did something nice for you and you should appreciate it”. Shut the fuck up. That’s the killers choice, not something survivors should ask for, and not something that I have to appreciate. I’d rather be hooked and lose than have some dweeb think I was a noble player or some dorky shit like that and bless me with his approval. “As a killer, I have the power to let you go. You’ve earned freedom” ya’ll are fucking nerds and full of yourselves
---
It’s seemingly offensive to the mind, like “How dare you not appreciate that I chose you?!” Don’t need you, don’t need your approval, you’re a self-flattering dork and the meme, at the end of it, is about how good it feels when someone validates you for doing something which you wanted to do for them because they behaved properly according to your values
---
Maybe make it so the perk inflicts the exposed status effect after a set amount of t-bags.
---
What? He's quoting the video...
---
Nothing but delusion on this sub from the OP to your comment
---
Why do you care, did you have fun? Quit looking for validation from strangers on the internet.
---
Toxic survivors with the exception of this one Legion I played against. He kept picking up and dropping the second-last Survivor to farm, Mori'd them, then faked giving the hatch.
---
I'm jaded to how awful sweaty Survs are, but that was a new wound.
---
Did you not see all of the lag, and the fact that I was on the hook sideways
---
and im just sitting here wondering where this meme sprung from, and how to send it back.
---
Lmao 😂 The bubbuhs like 🤔
---
I still think the issue is how BAD the window block is. Make it activate after 2 vaults and linger a bit if a chase ends and Bloodlust may not even need to kick in sooner.
---
I see someone forgot the shitpost tag again
---
Is his head big, or is his arm just too smol
---
If you speak their names you summon them you fool! Look at this comments section!
---
&gt;The only way to truly understand the reasoning behind the actions of survivors and killers is to play both roles extensively
---
Hm seems reasonable. Sure. Will do.
---
You wanted the salt/rant tag.

I literally will do this to a killer every round lol this is how I win games
---
well yeah but leatherface is also really bad, at least his power does something useful if it hits
---
On the way to that
---
I’m being salty over killers patting themselves on the back for believing they’re using some sort of power for the sake of good or something haha like, your opinion means nothing, fuck your rules, nobody needs your self-gratifying, false expressions of altruism. You’re not some arbiter of best practices, stop stroking your ego
---
Also, the entire world is full of people who believe they deserve gratitude for their own choices. You’re offended by the idea that someone wouldn’t owe you something because you did what you believe is a “nice” thing. I’m totally down for you guys to stay miserable forever haha nobody owes you fucking anything
---
Cry more
---
You did an amazing job on this cosplay!!I honestly couldn't believe you were cosplaying while looking at it!
---
lol?  this game is all about being efficient and healing when the killer can insta down you is the most useless thing ever.  I win games as killer because of this and lose games as survivor because my teammates prioritize healing when noed is up instead of finding the totem
---
Seems like he stopped selling it :(
---
considering small map i would give it a solid 8 or 12 meters but with each rank it increase the duration of the aura reading
---
Son, let me tell you a little story about SMITE.
---
See, SMITE has these "season passes" that let you grind out Limited Edition skins with gameplay, but if you buy them near the end of the season...you can't. The amounts are physically impossible to reach.
---
Naive as I was, I went on the forums to suggest that maybe the income rate should increase. The seething hatred that frothed from the fans' gibbering maws will haunt me for the rest of my days.
---
What I'm saying is, it can be really, REALLY important to people -especially toxic people in online games- to have things that other people cannot. So I'm afraid you're very correct and this isn't going away.
---
Explain to me why healing vs insta down anything is smart.  Enlighten me please
---
Yeah killers that pretend they'll give hatch are pretty shady.
---
They should be healing so it's less easy to find them 🤷‍♂️

Description: When in a SWF group, some members of a party join a lobby while the rest of the group is still searching. The ones that do join a lobby get teammates that aren't in the SWF group and have to back out.
---
Reproduction rate: happened 2 out of 4 games we tried joining tonight. Happens more often when we have to wait a while for lobbies at high ranks.
---
Specs: i7, GTX 1070, although i dont think this is PC wise as everyone in the group experiences it.
---
Cmon. You cant make the argument that something is bad by just saying it sucks. Look, it has potential and it doesn't just have to be the illusion ability. Maybe the killer can finally run as fast as the survivor for a limited time or they can have the spirit lunge ability after they reveal themselves. There is potential in this to make it fun and viable. Also, not everyone shares your toughness. Sure, the game might not be scary for you, but it could be scary for someone else. Don't believe me? Search YT and watch some clips of people encountering certain killers for the first time or in special situations. I for one dont find this scary like you do, but I do jump a little when I get jumped by Myers, Pig, Spirit and Ghostface and that one moment makes it worth while.
---
Fair enough
---
Shoot him a message.  He might be able to hook you up.
---
That reminds me, why does everyone put up with the crippling BP caps?
---
Because this build can't pass 32k. Nothing can but BBQ. That'll go up to 64k, no matter how much you actually earned.
---
Pretty much yeah clown has no map pressure and having no mobility options means he's slow as shit.
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
Copy pasta material
---
Locker steves gonnah get what they're gonnah get
---
FYI you can TECHNICALLY get Merciless with a 3k, I once got it after giving a Dwight hatch as demo
---
Them people dc and say I'm toxic
---
Yeah the people that get scared daily are the rare 1%ers man. 
---
Killers can run faster then survivors in general. Lol are you telling me you think survivors are faster then killers? Really? 
---
Also you know people on YouTube mainly youtubers fake scare so they can get mainly youngins to watch there content.
---
Dark ritual madness
---
I mean yeah a killer can be strong, but there are some things that some killers have that literally just make a match not only boring, but in many cases just painful to try to play. 
---
Examples of painful builds: a true anal beads spirit, omega blink nurse (an actual good nurse player behind the build), 5 blink nurse (any child could play this build and win), Iridescent head huntress, and any plague match where a survivor cleanses.
---
Examples of boring/annoying builds: Sloppy Thano legion, Exaustion addons huntress, Exaustion addons Clown (not that annoying to play against, but it really should be a direct hit), and more I can't think of. 
---
Now this is all coming from the perspective of a huntress main who loves using iridescent heads with an ebony mori when I see a SWF that bullied me last match. But even I can agree that some killers have builds that just make playing survivor a painful experience.
---
Note: This doesn't mean these builds should be removed, at the most things like anal beads spirit should be reworked a bit to maybe add a very very slight visual distortion of the air, much less than wraith. Wouldn't hurt her too much since if you have the tremendously increase speed add-on, the odds of you as a survivor reacting in time is slim.
---
\*laughs in ps4\*
---
Why are you downvoting him? Seems like a pretty obvious /s to me
---
Here come the killers 'survivors do it too so therefore it's ok'
---
No it's not ok, whether survivor or killer, don't be a baby and finish the match. Take your losses with some dignity.
---
Survivor toxicity doesn’t bother me too much because I can kill a toxic survivor. Can’t do much to a toxic killer though.
---
All Survivors really have is dropping the "lunchbox" for Killers.
---
Tunneling = objective rushing
---
Yeah but you could run pwyf not saying it’s a good option it’s really only good for leatherface.
---
I think the better idea would be to disguise Survivors as Killers. 
---
So survivors see other survs as the killer and have red stain on them/heartbeat
---
Introducing new killer:
---
Vulpes Inculta
---
New survivor:
---
Courier 6
---
New Map:
---
The Fort
---
I haven’t noticed any difference, but then very few people in my games are running Inner Strength regardless of which side I’m playing.
---
Happened to me last match on Xbox
---
for the sensitive killers who can't understand sarcasm.  
---
It was a joke.
---
They didn't say it was smart.
---
Lol
---
Need one for Clown and Wraith.
---
Self? Are you Arc Warden
---

Something else I noticed about clowns power is he moves slower when throwing them which kinda defeats the whole purpose of them.

One more question, how much was the price?

Seriously? This is copy pasta material?
---
Yeah prayer beads spirit is stressful and unfun for the most part, but I'm referring to how people complain just because a killer is good/valid. Spirit doesn't need a nerf just because she is strong, maybe prayer beads could use one though.
---
Well archives are coming, so eventually we can work towards that. Before than you can try to get enough iridescent shards to buy outfits.
---
Toxic survivors, but toxic killers are still annoying. Toxic survivors want to act all high and mighty while usually toxic killers just get me out if the game in 4 minutes flat. Also survivors will win or lose bitch at you in some way.
---
they didnt burn him no they did much worse
---
they melted peporoni and chesse on his face
---
Well it says Processing.... but if it’s the actual predator then it makes no sense because they don’t just kill random innocent civilians that aren’t worthy to a trial of combat.
---
Eh just run brutal strength like most m1 killers.
---
This belongs r/DBDGoneWild
---
My build is BBQ, M&amp;A, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Ruin. The numbers on Thanatophobia are just too low imo.
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, …).
---
Huntress hatchets damage survivors clowns bottles don't so that's a bad comparison as huntress needs to move slow due to being able to potentially 1 hit kill survivors with them clown doesn't have thst benefit since he still needs to catch survivors even with the ebony add on that gives the exposed status.
---
You talk about the general survivor population and yet you forget most survivors get head starts, have distance after pallets and vaults and have speed boost perks and lets not forget that survivors run 6 m/s after being hit. So yeah, survivors do run faster than killers. Also, I dont know what fake videos you are watching, but most of them are genuine and the reason I know that is because you can't plan or script what happens in DBD. That is the main selling point and what makes DBD fresh and fun because everytime you load into a game, it will play differently every time regardless if you load in with the same people and in the same map.
---
screw your fun, I got tunnelled last game so i must now pass on my frustration by playing toxic against you now /s
---
DC when you fucking die wtf?
---
Sounds like another company I know. Starts with a B
---
Thank god, I'd have 40 ping in lobby but it felt like 400 in game.
---
It’s only acceptable to DC when the game is being held hostage and/or your opponent is cheating. Anything else is just a circumstance in the game that you need to deal with
---
What do add ons do?
---
You should never dc if you really must quit just go  afk/kill yourself  when you do this it doesn’t hurt the killer and can help your teammates a bit by at least buying time . If you dc on a regular basis your awful and need to get better at the game
---
Are you fucking stupid lol. It does matter if you are trying to put up a concept really to be implemented into the game because your concept makes no fucking sense due to the lore of the predator discussion done.

Well pallets get dropped a lot man. And it’s up to you if you want to run it or not. Believe it or not but Beutal strength is a perk that’s run on a lot of m1 killers.

Thats ok i didnt want to argue either, perhaps your right, i didnt feel 100% commenting, but i've seen this sub and the games community at its worst, and with the influx of new people its better to nip poor sportsmanship in the bud.

Sorry for the way i spoke.
---
It’s not Steve *Im batman*
---
&gt; cannot put injured survivors into the dying state
---
The perk can't. If a survivor is healthy when they cleanse a hex, they get injured, if a survivor is injured when they cleanse a hex, they do not get downed. Same as the Trapper's Bloody Coil.
---
Wow. Survivor, I'm guessing? There's an XP dropoff after about 9 minutes so you're either crushing it as Killer or running Survivor mostly, right?

---
Sadly I'm not aware of one. The reason for the title is also because I've never ever seen anyone using this build. Probably because many people underestimate the Overcharge/Unnerving comb and cause many people see Dead Rabbit as a upside/downside add-on even tho it can actually give you advantages in both, EW 2 and 3.

BUT, Monto might have something similar. It's been a pretty long time ago since I've watched any of his videos (as I've played lots of his builds myself already). Atleast he's the only "big" DbD CC that I can think of who might've done that.
---
oh no
---
I get his point but it’s fucking stupid lol. 
---
Camping although legit strategy ruins someone’s experience. 
---
Doing gens doesn’t really ruin someone’s experience. 
---
I get where he’s going but it’s fucking different lol. Only someone with half a brain would think he makes sense which is sad.
---
Yup, just too much value in one Perk because they apparently haven't found any appealing way to fix the actuall reason why Ruin is that overused.
---
Might be the server crashing or something along those lines. Happened to me once before as survivor and after like 5 minutes of waiting, I was returned to the title screen with "an error has occured".
---
51+38+4-4=89 
---
The gap is 11% missed.
---
Same as the demogorgan. The mindflayer in stranger things is not what the actual mindflayer in d&amp;d is. The kids basically use both as a metaphor, since that is the big bad monster they are fighting in their d&amp;d game. 
---
A mindflayer in real d&amp;d is a made up creature by the creators of d&amp;d. It is a Cthulhu-esque monster that literally eats people's brains. One of the most iconic monsters.
---
What about if you could put down a puddle of mud that when walked thru will slow you and speed up the mud timer whilst in it?
---
It fits perfectly with tbe quirkiness of his character from Stranger Things.
---
No I actually like the perks and the power I just think the power is a bit weak and really I don’t say this often most the time perks suck and power fucking sucks or is stupid. But this man this isn’t a bad idea. 
---
I genuinely really like this killer and the perks I think you did an excellent job man.
---
Do I look like fucking spider man. And you're probably going to reply with "ad hominem, BeCaUsE yOu AtTaCkEd Me AnD nOt My ArGuMeNt"
---
Yup
---
I would like this version in the game for some killer
---
Is he bad or something? Why does he need a perk rework?
---
:o I had to make an account for this lmao
---
So like a trap. So like a mixture of Freddy and plague. Hmm that actually might be pretty good. 
---
Yeah that’s not that bad. It also can help with chases.
---
Thank you! It’s taken me almost a week of brainstorming to create this killer
---
I heard my name
---
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking
---
Yeah the guy on the left is complaining about us doing our only objective where what he's doing ruins the fun in the game
---
Who? Killer or survivor
---
Wrong, you said you were a killer main when you had the idea to kill the killer, so you're just a troll that makes up stuff to go with you're dumbass arguments. Reply with "ad hominem"
---
Also, just thought of this now. What if she left a trail of mud that disappears after 2 seconds that has the same effect as the puddles?
---
Are you a Nazi?
---
By making this question I'm not implying I have pre conceptions of you based on X Y Z, regardless if this X Y Z is right or wrong. I'm just asking a question, not accusing you or implying anything
---
You realize how stupid you sound making that argument?
---
If a coordinated group of survivors is only supposed to be on equal terms with a killer, how do you expect solos to ever survive?
---
Then why are you making survivors worse by making Plague better than Nurse.
---
Telling a survivor that they either have to waste time cleansing or do nothing and then telling then that cleansing also means you have to do nothing (by hiding) isn't counterplay. It's boring.
---
50% = nothing meaningful. That's 160 seconds to complete a gen without ruin. Over 2 and a half minutes, and you think that's okay when it's insanely easy to get someone sick.
---
I would like to state this man's ping was so bad at one point I was able to walk in and out of the exit gates with no gens having been done (and yes u/r-n-man is my friend in the screenshot)
---
Dude, you comment this on any argument you can't refute. It's the only smart thing you know to say, so I speak for most of this community when I say piss off
---
Well it won’t work all the time but when it work it works lol. I like it and it kind of adds to to her lore and that’s a nice touch.
---
You can't past tier I but when you stalk you see survivors behind walls etc. Within 32 meters
---
**Iridescent Head** should be changed from insta-down to inflicting *Deep Wounds* with a 10 second timer imo.
---
*basement bubba would like to know your location*
---
Agitation does the same, but also makes you spend less time walking to the hook.
---
Who even argues about that?
---
&gt;By making this question I'm not implying I have pre conceptions of you based on X Y Z, regardless if this X Y Z is right or wrong. I'm just asking a question, not accusing you or implying anything
---
If anything, you should have said I was making assumptions. Not accusations for fucks sake.  Because in your original comment, you said...
---
&gt;"I accuse others of being killer mains because they disagree with me then I get downvotes for being a prick, what a weird place the internet"
---
For fucks sake. Stay on topic. You accused me of making accusation against the OC which I have not. Yes. I can say I may have made an assumption but not A FUCKING ACCUSATION.
---
I swear. You probably forgot what we were arguing about weren't you? This was about whether I was accusing the guy of being a killer main or not.
---
By asking someone if they are a Nazi, that isn't an accusation since you can't fucking make claims when making questions. 
---
Once again, I'll drop the meaning off accusation: 
---
*Claim that (someone) has done something wrong.*
---
Wait. You probably don't know what claim means. 
---
Claim: state or assert that something is the case, typically without providing evidence or proof.
---
Yep. Statements can now be questions huh? Dear lord. Go learn what accusations are. And also learn how to stay on topic. You can't make an accusation by questioning. 
---
&gt;You realize how stupid you sound making that argument?
---
The irony man. The irony.
---
I think the matchmaking is broken again.... smh
---
Love it. I plan on making the blue hair Susie as my Halloween costume. Your cosplay is great inspo
---
Spine chill isnt aura reading. You dont see the killers aura it just gives you an idea where the killer is coming from so no.
---
Get this through your thick skull. Accusations can not be given out in the form of a question! 
---
You can't not make claims in the form of a question. 
---
"Are you gay?" This doesn't  equate to this "You are Gay!" Yes, I'm making an assumption, but not a FUCKING ACCUSATION! 
---
Fuck. This shit is starting to piss me off.
---
Ah-ha, or if you pipped with that character, they are saved in a slot and can be used again and again but if you depip that character is permanently lost to the Entity.
---
Laughs in the fact that u probably can’t hit and down them if they are all at the gate
---
I love Leatherface but he's definitely a bitch to play at higher ranks.
---
Hello there!

Nice
---
Yep his perks aren’t bad if you ask me it’s just power that drags me down.
---
Saturday nights means no school lol.
---
Im rank 1 and get matched with rank 20s sometimes as well. wE fIxEd MaTcHmAkInG
---
The chances of this happening are about the same as Chucky getting added
---
Yep i really didnt know, i just know them as party hats or pig trap
---
When I’m playing survivor, there’s nothing a killer can do to annoy me. I don’t mind playing against anything, don’t mind being tunneled nor camped.
---
The only thing that can annoy me are other survivors or just survivors when I play killer
---
Certain killer mains in this game think that not standing still and giving them free kills is being toxic. You'll see them on this sub too. Don't take them seriously
---
Is this sponsored by Pepsi?
---
Plenty of reasons not to... All of them blood points, you DC, you get none and the killer gets a bonus off of you being a baby
---
Demogorgon isn't underpowered at all. But with the rank system bugg and shit like this it's most likely to get low ass killers in every game who doesn't know how to play. Demo doggy is a good killer his charge is absolutely nice and breaks pallets and if u lay down portals activate them and then use you're m2 u can see people who run over those portals. It's a nice mechanic nobody seems to use. All in all I like him and I think he's totally fine.

This was over the moment you got unhooked tbh. You had DS up, she either takes the DS or you crawl out.
---
That legion should have been facecamping at that point to be honest lol.
---
Such perfection.
---
That is true, the amount of servers is too low and their placing is questionable. I live in the middle of Russia, closest servers are in Singapore and Frankfurt, both being about 6000 (six fucking thousands) kilometers away! That's ridiculous.
---
That’s what I was thinking. People just need to adapt, and in the near future he will be harder to play against. Thanks for your input to the discussion.
---
Again you leakingpickle. Isn't the first time you had dumb takes but even making shit up to say even more dumb sht is hilarious
---
Welp, you always defend people who DC like a white knight.. can't wait to see temp bans who do so, like in any other online game.
---
Survivors get less bp because they keep the items when they survive or even take new ones from the trial. Killers lose add ons regardless.. my bad, I shouldn't use logic with you.. you showed several times how dumb you are
---
If they lessened his chainsaw charge time without the need of add ons, he'd be so much better. Also, if they made the time penalty for bumping into objects not so bad. His perks are really good so he has a lot of potential.
---
On pc: 
---
Open xbox DVR
---
Copy link to post
---
Done.
---
Well not alot of people know how to use him effectively. If someone plays him they usually use the lunge terribly or portals incorrectly. He's the most mediorce killer and kinda complicated to play.(P3 demogorgon main btw)
---
Her hearing injured people removes everything she is about and turn her power into “simply down the closest injured person”
---
Make her no longer hear grunts of pain when phasing and I’ll be fine. 
---
I love mindgames and stuff. I just hate that after getting hit I’m only prolonging the inevitable and might as well stand afk
---
SUPA KILLA
---
Yes, I know, but Mvxwell didn’t know I had DS. I‘m highlighting his actions and not my escape. :) We always complain about bad survivors, apply labels, etc. that we hardly praise good-willed survivors like him.
---
I believe this may be the case as well.
---
People complain because they're frustrated. Maybe she's not overpowered (debatable) but she's unstoppable in certain situations, which often leads to survivors going down in a way that feels unsatisfactory. Sure, there are 3 survivors outside of a chase with her and sure killers are supposed to be the strong one, but against a good spirit player often there is just nothing you can do. The inevitability removes any agency that one has and makes you wonder, whats the point of playing? If you don't have iron will, you haven't got a shot.   
---
Spirits running Dying Light, Ruin(especially with the new spawns) and Thanatophobia have just taken the fun out of the game for me.
---
he'll probably use his 10 seconds of superhuman running speed to get away
---
It would be too consistent. It should give you stacks per health state lost (chainsaw gives 2 stacks when downs you from healthy) and require 5 stacks
---
Then counter play it. Gen rush whilst being camped. Killer can only do one thing at a time. Messaging someone, moaning about things the Devs have put in place is just toxic. 
---
That killer won't climb past rank 17-16 if he's camping. At my rank you'd never see a killer camp, it gives up too much map pressure.
---
The black text boxes (survivor), messaging like that is just pure toxic.
---
At least they made him fatter, right?
---
It’s all about in-jokes the popular kids use. Nothing new, except that it’s all cyberized.
---
This happened to me once, Just as I hit a survivor with an M1 too. I them just as they vaulted the shack window and the game just ended. Survivors asked why did the killer dc in the post game chat and I was there and was able to tell them I didn't. Weird.
---
I have that perk that lets me get better stuff from the chests and usually find purple and pink keys too bad I’m ass and just die anyways lmao
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv
---
Read this before ever talking about hitboxes again. Thank you.
---
Big oof
---
Use this next time. You are right but at least this link would save you time
---
Now this is quality.
---
I honestly hate watching twitch killers camping hooks or “proxy camping” as some like to say. Play the fair and you don’t spread toxicity. You can play killer extremely well and not camp or tunnel. Like I love watching puppers play survivor, he’s not toxic and plays extremely well, but damn when he plays killer it’s a camp fest and annoys the fuck out of me. Just one example.
---
My LPT wasnt a troll.
---
“It’S A lEgiT stRaTegY!”
---
Yeah, but it doesn’t make you any less of a dick 🙄
---
Tbh the vanity mirror (tier2 less aura distance) with nurses and sloppy butcher work better for me. Especially with spirit fury or fired up. Monitor and abuse if you’re feeling spicy
---
I usually drop them if they wiggle and shake my head "no" at them. If they don't figure it out, they get a hook. Lol
---
You can't. Just let them wiggle off.
---
hit stuff if they dosent stop wiggling just sacrfice you dont want to waste another 3 min of your life
---
He keeps commenting to my old posts/comments everywhere.
---
Some other guys spammed like 12 messages calling me a troll, though that guy has been blocked.
---
Hit a hook then shake your head no. If they keep wiggling then hook them.
---
I usually walk directly in front of a hook and shake my head no. If they keep going i'll swing at a rock. If they wiggle off just stick that piece of unholy metal in their spinal cord.
---
Try hitting an item with your weapon? Like a generator or a tree while carrying them. Usually that's what I do and it works 70% of the time. If they keep wiggling, try and let them find the hatch themselves? Idk. Survivers are hard to communicate with.
---
Isn't an hitbox issue. Learn the difference
---
There is no need for this, killer is easy to play as it is.
---
This isn't related to this post at all.
---
Ad hominem.
---
So you admit it.
---
&gt; The killer could have just picked you up at that.
---
Nah, soon as she was unhooked she was free since she had DS. Killer had to facecamp her, idk why she was even at the exit.
---
Forever jelly I'll never get that David King jacket.
---
Get out of rank 20 or play something that isn't competitive (any pvp game)
---
Tbh. If it’s a rank one game just stay. It’ll last about the same amount of time lmao
---
I main both.
---
You're right, thank you.
---
Incorrect. Ping doesn't suck for everyone. For me only about 1/10 lobbies show red ping. And if it doesn't go down I usually find another lobby. Why should I suffer for someone elses bad connection?
---
Hag is the scariest for me. I just dont expect jump scares in the games damn it. Also when your destroying demogorgons portal and he pops through. Heart racing moments
---
4 blink nurse is easy to beat, insta down hatchet huntress is justifiable 4 man dc
---
lol that's the build I use along with the legion pin
---
Another thing worth noting is some people care about achievements. I'm not sure what platform your on but that might also play into it as you can only use the 3 demo perks and it's pretty difficult to get tbh.
---
One got a killer who messaged us before hand asking to farm, we said no because we don't do that sorta thing and he went full sweat and hooked us all in around 2 minutes. Turns out he was rank 5 vs all of us rank 16 - 20's. So high ranks always do this?
---
Hahahhahah poor ghost face it was a great match
---
Honestly just first hand witnessed this I wanted to freak out about it
---
if you read carefully, you would have understood that i said it's caused by connection+hitboxes combined.
---
I don’t think he’s a dick, just shit my pants when I got this close and saw the kori happening lol
---
Most Scary: Probably Myers and GhostFace
---
Theres just something about working on a gen and seeing someone starting at you and hearing tier up music or exposed sound.
---
Least Scary: Nurse, as im on console and most nurses are bad.
---
Most Fun, Freddy, keeps me on my toes and makes me have to loop differently.
---
Least Fun: Hag, i hate the traps that make me look at them, as well as the insane 1 for 1 potential, especially with make your choice.
---
I should probably mention, I'm Aussie. That definitely doesn't help. :P Also, Someone else's bad connection is less of a factor now that Dedi servers are a thing. Definitely not perfect, But not great either.
---
He got Brutal Killer, not Entity Displeased.
---
And well, all 4 survivors decided to rage quit so like Professor Hulk would say: "I see this as an absolute win!"
---
those survivor perks sound broken and abusable
---
I dont mind typing a bunch of text out, I type quick
---
Yup, I agree. But since this was a non-SWF lobby, I didn’t know he was just standing behind a corner, waiting for his next victim. The second I unhooked her, he marked me and I got down. His play style allowed two other survivors to power up all gens. It’s just not fun because you’re not even given a chance. Marked and down.
---
&gt;Ping sucks for everyone, so deal with it.
---
No it doesn't. Sometimes I can have 100 and a friend will have 300+
---
Dedicated servers are not a thing anymore, they have been turned off again.
---
Oh, i forget about this perk, thank you
---
I thought doctor was high mid tier wtf?
---
Yeah I hope they never completely bust her with nerfs, I’d like some small changes but I don’t quite know what they would be yet. 
---
Really, I just want to be able to enjoy games against her, and I don’t mean enjoy in a loop for days ez game, more like games where escapes or deaths feel satisfactory, as in I died because i was outplayed, not because “There’s only unsafe pallets in this area and she’s already behind you 4head”
---
i would not really call it petty you as the killer is securing your last kill it would be dumb to leave the hooked survivor when gates are open this is coming from someone who mostly plays survivor but I do play as killer sometimes and can see both sides. also if multiple ppl are around the hook waiting to save the person and honestly that is being dumb the killer should capitalize it and hit as many of them as he can. as a survivor, you should be smart and wait for the killer to leave before getting ready for the unhook. if they are not doing gens why would he leave knowing all 3 was right there waiting
---
K, I main killer and ngl I'd say I'm fairly decent, but I've had the game for around 3/4 Years and I never bothered to play survivor, I only started around a month ago and I'm not the worst at it, but definitely not the best.
---
No problem! Usually you can see on the bp symbol if there's a double bp event, it looks a bit different and should say if you hover above it 😊
---
Gl hf with your games!
---
You literally assumed the killer was being toxic because he wrote LOL XD in your own message?
---
You can literally see the mouse in op’s picture
---
Dog. Monitor and abuse and PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD. Slightly slower walking speed???? Nah.
---
Imagine taking screenshots
---
Yeah, I rarely use ghostface ability even though I should, I always use it if the survivors are tagging me at the exit gates tho cause I laugh my ass off when they get insta downed and hooked when they just wanted to take a hit lol.
---
I was teaching my friend some DBD skills and then he says very audibly, ''WHO'S THE CUNT IN THE WHITE MASK?''
---
I screamed ''RUN, BITCH, RUN!'' He was at 99% and completely destroyed me, hooked, tunnelled, dead.
---
Now you know why I can't get past rank 12
---
This is the content I like to see
---
I type on a keyboard, trying to type on a phone that has shitty auto correct is like YouTube trying to artificially create subtitles. 10% of the time the actual word you want gets through.
---
Holy shit I totally forgot about that. I'm so excited now, fuck.
---
Well, instead of posting it here (where you can get banned for abusing a glitch), you should send the report to the game devs...
---
I'm more impressed by the drawing, how do you even shade that!? (also, these are the rivals to the cool killers club)
---
Wait.. you had the game for 3 years and at the same time started a month ago? This is some Schrodinger sht
---
I’d say they can see states for the same reason that survivors can see the number of generators remaining
---
It’s a way of tracking your objectives
---
Sick 👍🏻
---
No, I played killer all the time and couldn't be bothered or rarely bothered to play survivor, it's only a month ago when I started playing survivor and it's pretty fun apart from the killers who camp ect.
---
Yeah haha I have 3 keyboards too on the phone so gets even more complicated (each per language)

Word
---
Ngl I hope leatherface rework removes his ability to 100% secure kills
---
To make it easy I suggest dance with me and lithe. Vault a pallet/window when you can easily lose sight by doing so, then hide. He will lose you, no scatchmarks, no sounds (unless injured) and since you used lithe you could be literally anywhere in a 20~mt range
---
Also make the killer lose you with the use of a flashlight and quick and quiet to hide in a locker but that's risky due to scratch marks.
---
Iron will is a must if you wanna go full metal gear (stealth). Also try to play with your scratch marks, since you played killer for pretty long you can already imagine them when you run. Manipulate them to throw the killer off.
---
Personally I use the first one if I wanna go stealth, it's more reliable
---
I want to know what was the "interesting incident".
---
This looks amazing, I love it
---
Moist
---
good meme
---
Camping and Tunneling are strats. Slugging the hooked guy creates a lot of pressure, and if you know someone is near the hooked person then stay and look for them. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean they aren't strats.
---
Yep i have multiple recordings off this happening. Sended in reports but devs still haven’t fixed it.
---
It actually is broken I have escapes with tokens and I either get no multiplier or not the full multiplier
---
I wouldn't mind a few deep wounds from you. Great cosplay. :p
---
Go die
---
That game is about chasing. Killet is forced to catch them not keep them.
---
Yes but one of the most interesting base kits so I'm not complaining
---
*Susie mains are degenerated scum* 
---
Jk
---
It is getting a little old how all new killers get add on tracks where you can't tell the difference between having brown add ons or green ones on.
---
Sounds lovely! Nice :)
---
also unrelated but I like your bracelets
---
Pretty much
---
Op pls share notes + chords
---
No, remove collision.
---
If you didn't bring a mori it's not a realistic cosplay.Jk nice cosplay,I hope that you'll be able to improve it even further!
---
True, but with T1 people are not having the red spot, so they can fool people a lot more. Besides Vanity has that pesky "Slightly decreases move speed" debuff, so... Yeah.
---
Good work on getting out with this mess as an opponent lol.
---
Still, I feel like with players like this GF it stings more for them, when you don't teabag back and ignore them in the post-game chat and just talk to your teammates.
---
The killers are like, "Where's my salt? Wah."
---
After a certain amount of loops of sayibg the same thing i just stoped responding. He can be a moron by himself
---
This is how I feel about killer dailies with the recent bug going around. Everytime I get a survivor daily it rerolls to a killer one.
---
Nope. I want like a witch/vodoo type killer.
---
Robot is actually the least appealing idea to me personally.
---
If the kits fun I'd play it anyway though.
---
This meme is inaccurate, The Legion isn’t hot.

i would go for a five night design they are geniuly scary espicaly if the bots are from that 3d game where you could move the design wouldnt be half bad and the devolper seem pretty cool
---
honestly my best robot is glados but i can only think of her as the same level of entity not a measly killer she wouldnt to dirty her hands
---
like hag?
---
Five night at Freddy’s.... really.
---
You know what it’s late for shits and giggles can we have bender from futurama that’s the robot I want.
---
There are so many surv perks that are shit but also boring.
---
I know killers too have a ton of shit perks but you can mess around with most of them and they can be fun in memey builds.
---
Surv just have a lot of straight dogshit ones.
---
Yes, but usually it can be helped, here we couldn’t do anything for 35% of the match because of a design flaw.
---
I can't be bothered with toxic survivors, if they prove to be good at looping I'll switch targets to someone easier to kill them later.
---
Toxic killers though, can't do shit about those when they go out of their way to ruin your experience with incessant tunneling for their pity kill.
---
Those still always have an effect
---
Map offerings that had "slightly increased chance to get to X" straight up felt like they are doing nothing, as they didn't work most of the time they were used
---
Huntress goose mask when
---
Goose as the new killer and the boy with the airplane toy as the survivor
---
mindgame 100
---
Your right, he’s ice cold.
---
Great job on the knife!
---
I've had that happen to me as killer and yeah while it's annoying I wouldn't call it toxic cos its just a smart play tbh
---
Legion cosplay is so low effort and boring. Don’t see what’s so impressive.
---
Get a cheap mask or even a plate, draw the face and wear a hoodie. Such cosplay
---
Wtf are you playing? Lol
---
Was straight up playing the game as normal as possible and the spirit just got mad that one guy managed to loop her for 2 gens and decided to take it out on us xd
---
Man I live in the middle east and the lowest ping for me was 100MS and if the killer has a lower ping, which is almost all the time, he will be faster than normal, hits through windows and pallets from miles away. Man its 100MS but the hits feel like 170MS with the host system.
---
Hag is actually one of my main killers but I feel like they could pull it off with a drastically different power.
---
Teleporting is cool and everything but she just slaps them.
---
I really enjoy plague also but it's not the same theme x)
---
As much as I agree that you should always play the game out no matter what, iri hatchets are an actual problem
---
If it was done to try and “troll” them (which it sure as hell doesn’t sound like it) then it woulda been, but in a normal escape circumstance it isn’t in any way. They were just upset about the outcome and happened to be a sore looser.
---
True 😂
---
Well it’s fucking rude and can be considered toxic because it’s like taunting the killer because he can never get you. 
---
It’s like someone putting a 100 dollar infront of your face and when you go to grab it he pulls it back. The usual analogy is a baby with candy but eh. 
---
The killer doesn’t even get much points for the considered time your friend wasted.
---
Just fyi the meme is done with random capitalization not every other letter.
---
Hey you silly goose that's Ghostface not Demogorgon! Hahaa
---
Chest guardian bubba
---
I recommend Michael, Ghost face ( not for everyone, but hes my favorite ) and leather face if you don't have BBQ. If you do have BBQ, then I would go for Freddy.
---
Do you have a brain? No
---
Still mixing up hitbox and connection so..
---
I just hate the left and right bumping that's happening when survivors wiggle
---
Yeah but the question is how do you know in that situation, you’re going to think the guys just being an asshole really because that’s all the information you have got, I personally never dc lol.
---
How about whenever a survivor throws down a pallet, they get mori’d instantly. That is fair
---
I still love the game despite the flaws. Also this isn't true. Just making a funny.
---
Wow, you must be the only one then..
---
Well because a lot of that would be based on the actions during the actual match. If everyone played normally all game and then this were to happen to me, I’d know I made an obvious misread about the situation and I fucked up. If the players had been attempting to be toxic during the game, and then this happened, then it would sorta come off as being toxic.. but regardless a situation I still put myself into. I don’t DC from matches killer or survivor. The people who do are just easily frustrated whether there’s been toxicity or not (typically.) He threw away any work he did to earn BP and de-pip’d because of their own anger. If I thought someone else was an asshole in that situation for escaping the only way they could.. I’d be the asshole. Js.
---
Will it be called “the bend &amp; snap”
---
That and my own experiences from a few weeks ago when I tried to play huntress with only pop and iri heads when I was trying to show my friend how good pop can be when you finish chase really quickly
---
He had us three survivors tbagging him. He knew he lost. At least he was funny about it. But there’s no way he wasn’t at least a tiny bit salty. I know I would’ve been.
---
You only get one chance to use strike after you use it its done for the game
---
Killer is supposed to be as strong as all 4 survivors combined.  There are a number of addons for killer that break what balance the game has (which is iffy already) like omegablink, 3+ blink Nurse, Prayer Beads, etc., and have a far greater impact on the game than a survivor using DS or a flashlight.
---
If you’re in a game and you don’t want to play because you’re playing against something with no rational basis being in the game, the “leave” button was designed into the game for you to be able to leave matches.
---
Just don’t make it a habit.
---
Yep that's how the perks works
---
DBD teams weakness is for sure creating and balancing perks. All these years there has been 3-4 really good perks that everyone uses and the rest arent necessary.
---
Everyone runs the same build, this game has zero variety. They keep making new perks as well that are also useless and that means its much more that they have to rework or balance. 90% of perks are terrible right now. Im surprised they havent hired someone who can balance better after all this time.
---
Well yeah, but most people I play with on dbd don’t have it on (I message them for props on certain things btw, not to complain about how they played). The fact is that if their is another way to message, then they should just give us the easier way to message.
---
Ds baiting is kinda toxic, everything else no.
---
Thank you so much hehe :3
---
You can jump gaps on the game map as demogorgon.
---
So many people in this game think everyone owes everyone else their time and effort. Inconvenience four people? Tough shit, its their game, their time, so deal with it.
---
Lucky you. For me both queues are bit longer. Survivor takes about 3 mins which is acceptable, but killer games take 10 mins approx which is sad
---
Quality shitpost
---
Owww thanks a lot my friend :&gt; ♥️♥️
---
Id take jack over pennywise any day
---
Hahahaha :') Nice x)
---
High ranks do what? Farm or win against low ranks? And its not sweat my dude, you just lost.
---
Feng's Bulgie Wulgie uwu
---
I made everything myself. And the mask was actually quite difficult to create. I get where you're coming from tho, and I totally understand your statement. But, some things might not seem as easy as they look :)
---
There's always a meta but man surv perks are just BORING.
---
Like why would anyone buy ash or quentin if they didn't want the characters, the perks are not only weak but they're also boring.
---
I think prayer beads spirit and nurse omega/3+ blink are almost Impossible and uncounterable. Only counter for gen grabber spirit is gen tapping which significantly slowest gen speed, and iron will (a lot of spirits in high rank run strider now) so little to no counter. Then nurse omega/multiple blink. Don’t get me started. The most stupid add ons of any killer. It’s okay if the nurse is kinda bad. But the second you get a nurse who knows what she’s doing but using these addons. It’s no longer a fun game. Only counter for multiple blink is trying to make distance everytime she missed a blink but still hard considering the amount of chances she has. And omega blink.. I have no idea how to counter that against a good nurse. Edit: I’m not saying Dcing is okay against this. I’m just saying I don’t blame them. It’s not fun to verse. Especially if they use a mori. It’s like extreme ez mode when a killer uses this.
---
Hahaha thanks :D
---
Thanks a lot :D ♥️♥️
---
Awww made me smile c: Thank you ❤️
---
Hahahaha x)
---
_Sadly I'm not, sorry_
---
well as always the biggest effect won't work with SWF BUT!!! for most games this would be really cool, what it sounds like, the effected player would look like the normal killer player, with the animations and terror radius (which should be the same size as the killers) this would make other survivors run away from the player and may give you a different way to tracking them.  
---
i have to say i love this.
---
The holes are carved out of the foam. I honestly can't see a lot haha! But it's sufficient to not walk into a wall c:
---
I don't give a shit if it's connection or hitbox and how they interact. im just a dbd player, nothing more.
---
i know that dedicated servers didn't help a thing and made it all worse. I just wanna play dbd and not get hit 5m away from the killer. I don't care how the devs fix it. but i am hopeful they will fix it some day.
---
Just the DS was unnecessary, but I guess it’s points (if killer doesn’t DC)
---
Aww thanks so much! I've put quite some time in it, so I'm extremely happy you're saying this❤️
---
Awww thank youuuuu!!! :D ♥️♥️
---
He's beautiful
---
_Sadly I'll have to disappoint you_ :')
---
Ooohh! I'm curious! Show me when you're done! :D
---
Hue c: Thank you
---
I beg to differ! I think it would still work against SWF but in a much more limited sense. If you see a doc across the map you need to take the 5-10 seconds to communicate with your team to affirm that it was you, and there's very little way to affirm if you're in t3 madness unless you go to the corner to get the meter done. It is obviously worse against SWF but still good, I think. If you hear a terror radius coming towards you, you don't have much time to be like "shit is that you?? are you by...that one pallet??"
---
No u ❤️ Thank you
---
&gt;tredemously
---
?
---
Quentin honestly looks like Steve after doing 10 years of hard drugs and getting less than 4 hours of sleep each night
---
Yall trippin' if you think I ain't pickin' Nancy😍
---
Thanks a lot c:
---
Bhvr isn't bad and I don't hate them, but it really can be frustrating when the game doesn't work properly still. It takes me 10 mins to get into a killer game which is sad cos I spend 10 mins waiting for about 10 mins of fun. For survivor most of my experiences have been good with dedicated servers, but I've had a confusing game against a myers who had tier 2 instantly got tier 3 music and I had the exposed icon which never went away. I played that entire game not knowing if he was t3 or t2, or whether I was exposed which meant I didn't have any information regarding what would be the best play. Also matchmaking seems to be broken. I'm rank 7 survivor and I've been matched against many rank 20 newbies
---
That I have no control over. Everyone is different. I know that when I play survivor that every time I play against Huntress I turn into an even bigger potato than I already am even without Iri head.
---
Thankssss ❤️
---
Best way to lose the killer is try doing it before you're wounded, after your wounded just loop.
---
Its as simple as "fake right go left" and perks like lightweight, urban, and the new walking speed perk are great for this.
---
When you do it more you will plan your fake outs seconds prior rather than improvise, doing this is stuff like faking right and going left because right is the corner of the map and therefore no cover or pallet/window, if you loop a bit then try to lose them know that the killer will assume you've run to the next loop which will be obvioys to both of you before you get there, so abuse that.
---
_That sounds like a very interesting turn of events_ HMMMMM....
---
Inktober is another thing I'd love to do and always forget
---
Thankyouuuu :D
---
*hello there*
---
Against a good Nurse, you can juke 2 blinks, not 3 or 4. There's not enough distance. With omegablink you can barely juke the 2nd one (depends on distance). I think Nurse shouldn't have extra blinks and the range, while very satisfying to use, is unnecessary.
---
Twitch culture is usually a detriment to gaming communities but a benefit to the devs.
---
Hehe. Thanks so much ❤️ But take care, you never know where I'm coming from ;)
---
This meme has done a 360 numerous times now.
---
This is the Demogorgan
---
Abusing the survivors altruism is necessary in the higher ranks.
---
B-But I like stabbing :c ... Hue, thanks a lot ♥️
---
Vinc3ntVega facecamping is one of the most entertaining things to see tbh
---
Merci!! ♥️
---
Yo man I found the killer that dc'd against you
---
also could I ask you what's that knife?is it a new knife for legion?I haven't played in a while,it sort of looks weird
---
Fucking owned, fuck ghostfaces.
---
Goals:(
---
How about look away and stop standing still at the pallet
---
I dont think so lol. But there's a pair of compasses (calipers? Not sure what the correct word is) taped on it. This might do the cut.. Hmm
---
contradiction galore.
---
"he never camps unless blablabla......then he camps" --&gt; camping.
---
Thanks so muuuuch!! It's really me ;) ❤️
---
Ye, I dislike a lot of his gameplay in theory but his personality just makes it so funny.
---
Worth noting to OP that not everyone watchs certain streamers for gameplay alone, A lot of it is personality.
---
Imagine not knowing the meaning of the word "unless"
---
That's amazing, I thought that was an artists rendition of Susie but that's just a Cosplay.. great job!
---
Killing people early makes the game a lot easier for killers. Assuming you run some sort of tracking on your perks killing a survivor on their 2nd hook gives you a big advantage most of the time as often they'll have 3 or 4 gens left and you now have less people working on gens. If you're chasing a guy now only 2 people are working on gens instead of 3, and if a guy gets hooked now only 1 guy can be working on gens. I personally use ebony moris when I want a pip. It's really nice for the pig
---
Yes, I was very confused at first as well. Turns out that Susie actually uses a ruler as a weapon. It's a plain ruler with a pair of compasses (calipers?) taped on it. And some weird shards of glass or something. She weird. :D
---
Great meme, thanks
---
Thank you so much♥️ means a lot to me c:
---
Tunnel when necessary, never gets far from the hook
---
Really hope you will make more! Just followed your profile. :)
---
For real tho
---
The plural of anecdote is data.
---
Still sounds like this kid is a liar though.
---
Hhmm I'm getting nostalgic,guess that I'll start playing again
---
Aww thank you c: I'm currently working on quite some various other cosplays! I'll queue up another DbD one after a while. Maybe it'll get priority if they come up with something amazing c:
---
i'm pretty much 100% killer biased but i dont like spirit honestly.  
---
Her design (visually) is top tier and i'm happy for a killer to be as strong as she is - but she's just so unfun to play against. The fact that survivors being chased by her have so little information just makes playing her feel like a coinflip , being able to stand still and 'mindgame' people as to whether you're using your power is bs
---
I'd say if it was a clear out, you were there at the gates and could've gotten away without doing all that, then yeah it's toxic. It's just kinda rude and mean spirited to do that, knowing the killer lost, and still antagonizing them just because you can. If you were using the tools to actually get away, that's fine, but like... just don't be an ass about it
---
U never do thar, baby dwights are the priority, every human needs to see a happy baby dwight
---
Idk why you are thanking me you put in the effort you deserve the praise, it's when a cosplay like this comes together so well, it makes me want to try it. All in All, you did a great job and I wish you the best in any future Cosplays you may or may not do :D
---
Is that a Power Glove on Ash? I love it.
---
Realtalk, this is one of the better cosplays I've seen in a damn long time. Good work. You look great!
---
It's a scumbag move but I agree with you, just capitalizing.
---
I’ve only DC’ed twice in the last few months. Once was a game where two teammates DC’ed after under a minute and I just didn’t want to be in it and gave my teammate a chance to just get hatch. I don’t see a problem in doing this. 
---
The other time was when a random and I got slugged for like 5 minutes so I DC’ed when I knew he was on hatch. This might have been a bit toxic but honestly, no one wants to bleed on the ground for minutes on end
---
Only reason it's not fun is the survivors who get morid lost. As a survivor if I get morid I very rarely feel like it was unfair. I can always guess when they have a mori and play a bit more cautious than normal. And when I use one rarely do people even complain and those who do also complain about noed ruin and anything that helps a killer win games cos they're upset they can't just breeze through the game so they can teabag
---
Why would you like if you aren't using BBQ then the quickest way to find other survivors is to cut them off as they come back
---
Exactly!
---
Lmao
---
Good but then don't be bothered when people try to correct your statement.
---
Also what I linked explains why the dedicated servers are not perfect and why they are running several tests for it
---
But he is telling the truth,if you miss his attack you suck and should really l2p.
---
Yes it is harsh but that's life. Just keep practicing and one day you wont suck anymore.
---
Edit.  I just remembered myself this clip [https://youtu.be/DN43sCyEanA](https://youtu.be/DN43sCyEanA)
---
It reminds me of a Toad from Mario
---
Faith in humanity. Restored.
---
Same with toolboxes, 80 sec for a solo gen is already way to fast, they people get to speed it up too.
---
Aww.. That makes me happy, thanks a lot ❤️
---
Still legal in many European countries
---
I run Brutal Strenght on my clown
---
Iron will &amp; urban evasion for disappearing from under the killers nose.
---
_Do it. Do it._
---
I like it, but people already DC against him, this would send this into overdrive.
---
Insane, well done.
---
I will never DC first but I’ll be sure to follow because no one wants to play a 3v1 against an unfair build
---
Aww.. Stop making me blush x)! I'm gonna try my best for every single one of them! I always like taking my time to fix the details and try out different ways, so I'll be fine c: Thank you kind person :&gt;
---
100% would watch
---
Probably not whats makes me sad
---
Thanks a lot! :3
---
Kill them if they’re trying, meme back if they’re memeing
---
Totally unnecessary and very toxic, sounds like you could get away but chose not to. That said you're well within your rights to play as you wish as long as you realise that sometimes killers are just gonna DC to shitty behaviour like this.
---
Now kitth
---
We might be hooked on the brothers but something tells me that it would be a sore subject for the survivors lol
---
you can see that he isnt standing still and isnt being blinded repeatedly.
---
of course they should.
---
Meme not acurate, forgot dying light
---
Ds is already one of the most powerful and well designed survivor perks in the game. Buffing it is unnecessary.
---
But killers can still just leave a tunneled survivor on the ground for one minute and camp it to just wait for da to run out
---
You're most welcome. &lt;3 I'll take off spine chill just this once so you can catch me off guard entirely. Though I make no promises that I won't get a little ds happy.~
---
He keeps swinging and hitting a pallet repeatedly
---
Haha, what idiot got Myers into tier 3 already?
---
Action is coming
---
Will work for serotonin.
---
Why yes, Chief, I believe that was it.
---
I think that is hilarious, dude just got outplayed and couldn't handle it.
---
Entity means that person is the obsession,match making is kinda bad rn so you'll have some unfair matches and items disappear if you use them or die holding them,only way to keep them is to escape while having then in your hand.
---
Look out, it's a FUPA!
---
Isnt it the point though
---
Taking the game hostage is when the survivors cannot end the game without a dc or vice versa for the killer. Not the same as making the survivor have no way to win the game. In this case survivors aren't stuck in this game for an unlimited amount of time the game will eventually end which is why egc was added in the first place. If this happened before egc came out then the survivors cannot leave the game at all due to the pigs actions. By your definition hooking people is taking people hostage as you're preventing survivors from escaping. It's definitely not the most fun tactic but a killer isn't there to make the game fun for you they play the killer to try kill as many by any means
---
What the fuck is that logic? Why should the Killer not take advantage of misplays? He isn't there to be nice to survivors you know? But then he is a prick if he does what he is supposes to do? Classic survivor logic.. if we misplay and the Killer punishes us for it he is the prick :( and im not a Killermain just triggered by this kind of bslogic
---
you can hear him walking and eventually make it to a wall of the map
---
This is my first time :p more of a digital guy
---
By which time a teammate can just pick you up off the ground. If a survivor perks is forcing a killer to waste 60 seconds of his time (which a good survivor team will do three gens in) then then it is an extremely inefficient use of the killers time.
---
Also, just jump into a locker, it forces the killer to
---
pick you straight up.
---
People out here still using self care while this exists.
---
Those entity things are telling you someone's the obession and they move when someone's getting chased,for perks they just have better stuff simple as that they're more leveled, add-ons disappear without a certain offer that spares them and keys too get taken unless you have 1 or 2 specific add-ons to keep them after death or unlocking the hatch
---
My friend was still downed when the killer came back and trapped us there, though, I was still in the process of healing her. 
---
I was injured, if I remember correctly, so I would have gotten downed immediately as well, but the killer decided instead to just trap us there, let us heal and then never get out.
---
It bothers me how hypocritical people are here. Survivors bodyblocking a hook is wrong, but a killer blocking us in a small space where we couldn’t do anything for 35% of the match WHEN he could have gotten us both easily, is just a smart play from the killer? 
---
I don’t get this whole taking sides thing that’s going on here, killer mains vs survivor mains. It’s just nonsense and toxic.
---
Once and for all, my issue wasn’t with the killer, it was with the obvious design flaw of the game (the killer being able to trap you in a small space with no way of escaping).
---
Do I think he was a bit of a prick to do that? Yes. But was it entirely his fault? No.
---
Shhhh.....
---
Yeah, but if you want to rank up while soloqueueing as survivor and you're playing with potatoes those 60 seconds don't matter
---
IDK why people don't just suicide on hook. I make sure to collect my 500 bp for tapping that generator
---
Its even worse when he's your favorite killer -\_-
---
Just because you have 40 ping doesn't mean the killer has 250 ping. The magic of Dedicated Servers.
---
Then get to a higher rank. At red ranks, I can assure you that my team are far from potatoes. Even at purple ranks, teammates know that gens win games. If you’re green ranks or lower, the killer will most likely not even think about ds, and pick you up straight away.
---
the number of times ive run into self care in purple ranks is unreal. Ive even been getting paired with red-ranks sometimes, and I'm still seeing it on them for some reason.
---
actually good
---
This is a pretty stupid question. Why would it make sense for a killer not to know this stuff. It’s like taking away the generator count for survivor. It’s stupid.
---
Will do as soon as its free later this month
---
There are two kinds of instaheals, the purple one heals one health state, the pink one heals for two
---
Perhaps I never seen a killer just do that. New advanced facecamp I guess that gets 2 people instead of 1. Really shocking that both sides. Complain about the other. Seen killers complain about loops new ds borrowed time even self care, and seen survivors always complain about Ruin, noed and anything the killer takes and does to try win a game (not camping and tunneling). Sucks that survivor body blocking to try get someone off is added to that list of stuff people complained about
---
It's have already been done for a few years
---
This is weird yet really funny
---
I can’t unhear this xD
---
You have to be braindead to condemn camping. As a survivor main it's a badge of honor knowing the killer is so rustled he is willing to throw the match.
---
It would actually make a good killer mask
---
I'm going to be sincere... 
---
# THIS IS AWESOME.
---
I legit had like 5 games in a row today where all I could do is be stealthy and get safe hook rescues because after I finished the first gen and got hooked once, I realised none of my teammates were doing gens. They saw there was Ruin and immediately decided their playstyle would be "crouch in a corner until we all die".
---
I mean he is right, you are wrong. I actually think you are dumber then wall. Wall can t talk, while you can, it would be better If you couldn t talk
---
He hardly defends hooks?? He loses a lot because he doesnt pressure hooks. Most of his wins come from slugging as a way to spread pressure.
---
Regardless the man plays without ruin and jank perks all the time, he is a saint.
---
the most relatable meme I have ever seen in my life and it will always be that
---
Groovy
---
He totally deserved that. I thought at first that he was just playing around decisive and that's why he was waiting to pick you up, but then I saw that he really never picked you up and was just being straight toxic.
---
Nicely played by the Nancy and the insta heal, as well as you with the borrowed.
---
It's always satisfying to see toxic players, both killer and survivor, to get what they deserve.
---
Change Nurse's and STBFL to Coulrophobia + Distressing combo
---
Yeah buffs should definitely be prioritized first
---
I love getting hit with DS when I "tunnel" a survivor after chasing, downing and hooking a completely different survivor before finding the DSer again on the other side of the map fully healed.
---
Ohhhh, I feel sorry for you. At least there is next year. I think.
---
I tried a similar build with those two and overwhelming presence along with the iris button addo  and it worked fine but I've had a lot more winning games with this build
---
Yeah definitely, I am glad you did that because he was really pathetic when he downed you.
---
I never saw a good Pig tunneling survivors  for no reason. And she is already weak unless you know how to use her pretty damn well. She is like 2 nerfs away from becoming as bad as a Legion or Bubba
---
Unbreakable users: Virgins
---
No Mither users: Chads

No Mither + Selfcare users: Omnipotent beings
---
K. Guess I am just a bad Killer player who is okay with farming with people once one of them disconnects and makes everyone miserable, just so that I could put smiles back on people's faces. But I'm a moron, because that is boring. So don't do that.
---
I play on both console and PC. I mainly play the console version though. There is a slightly longer wait time on Console but you can usually get into a lobby within 5 minutes tops unless there is a bloodhunt going on. We get all the updates at the exact same time as the PC players, but we dont get the PTBs. There is a slightly different meta with console due to the FPS so Spirit and Billy are the top 2 killers in our meta since Nurse and Huntress dont have the accuracy that they do on PC. Id say go for it and get the deluxe edition for Hag and Feng Min.
---
Not to mention how it fucks you over in the endgame. I had a game as a lvl 1 doctor where I hooked a Kate and the exit gate was powered. A teammate unhooked Kate without BT, I downed her and then got DSd so she could Tbag at the gate and escape. Fuck me for wanting one kill, I guess.
---
Such a good point. It would make more sense for Pennywise to BE the Entity than working for it.
---
100%, if a minor change occurred which allowed someone to dress up a character in a game, which in no way impact or harms the people who already have that hat, and in no way decreases a monetary value as they cannot be sold, there would be mass outcry about how human rights were violated and the world is no longer a safe place.
---
He has add ons that make evil within 3 infinite, he also has an instant morie item?
---
What about no, DCs are the worst in this game. 
---
You can throw anything you want at me but DCs are fking cancer. 
---
Just because they want to farm doesn’t mean you have to do it, slug el and move on.
---
That means 80% of people using sc wouldn't waste their time analysing something that is unimportant and also realize that anybody attempting to give an educated answer to something so unimportant is a teir 3 virgin
---
My god that survivor set a pitfall trap
---
Yeah that just reinforces my point. It's unnecessary and only really used for bullying one survivor. Sure the other 3 will probably live, but why reward talentless tunnelers with an easy kill?
---
I thought that was a drawing at first! That Cosplay is insanely good
---
Any killer can tunnel its not difficult. Its the player not the killer.
---
Thank you so much ❤️❤️
---
How is that supposed to be a funny meme/shitpost
---
ZULUL
---
*The Emojiman*
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring is a thing
---
No, Disagree. What you just said is "I know she sucks but lets make her worse."
---
Bodyblocking a trap-removal spot is worse than just hook camping, there is no guarantee that's the correct one, It's not a good strat and if shes bodyblocking it she can probably just kill you anyway.
---
Tunneling 1 guy with an active bomb on his head is a waste of time also since hes not doing generators anyway.
---
-----
---
There is only 1 case where this really happens - Inactive bomb/gens not being done.
---
If you are trying to remove an inactive bomb and people aren't doing generators, It makes sense to stop you from removing it, especially if your whole team is playing immersed and refusing to get into a chase - Which is what is happening more often than not.
---
If your the only one popping up on my BBQ, sorry but I'm coming for you.
---
Bad,bad ghost face go to your room
---
Of course I am not there to be nice to survivors. But if you tunnel the guy who was just unhooked by a shitty teammate you activly encourage that kind of playstyle, because that guy will most likely get away with his sweet unhooking blood points, and the other guy is just shit outta luck. I am a Killer main so that survivor logic doesnt pull, I just want to have someone a bit competent for the 20 games per season that I need to rely on my teammates to not completly suck in order to have a fun game.
---
Also people who unhook like that usually suck so its literally a 30 second chase tops in order to punish someone who pissed me off and most likely pissed off his team as well, so even if its one of the few people that know how to kite me its worth it ;).
---
I don't get it.
---
Imagine this being a gen grab killer lmao, pretend to do the gen with your teammate then suddenly get up and grab him/her 🤣
---
Rigggght I apologise... I've got a lot of hours in this game I guess I just expect the worst add ons for every killer... No offense or toxicity intended
---
Is that a super mario reference?
---
My friend teabags at pallets and then complains when he gets camped/tunnelled. I tell him every time that he deserves it, and that I’m not going to leave the gen to save him because he’s being punished for acting like a toxic little shit.
---
Everyone thinks your suggestion is dogshit and braindead, so no what I said definitely ain’t wrong buddy. Your replies to everyone disagreeing with you is pure cringe and it shows that you know nothing about this game and balancing it.
---
Its all good my fellow gamer
---
Idk where you live my friend, but here on Earth 4-5 people who respectfully disagree (and you) is not "Everyone"
---
When I see survivors tbag killer at every pallet and window, I always sandbag them and when the killer downs them, I tbag at them (downed survivor, not killer). Then when killer hooks them I run to the hook and tbag and spam emotes to piss them off. After match I absorb the incredible amounts of salt coming from the post game chat
---
Rank 20 Baby Neas be like:
---
That baskidi do da... i really felt that 😔
---
I did also respectfully disagree, but you literally just said I was wrong and didn’t even explain why. Talk about being a hypocrite.
---
You don't automatically get 100% and have it ratio things around mid game. You start at 0% and gain/lose the percentage due to in game actions. Hence why that gap doesn't look 4%. It's actually an 11% gap
---
jeff?
---
😎
---
Also I’m talking about everyone who commented, you dumb or something?
---
Cringe
---
No, it's the survivors decision to go to the nearest box.
---
If you are not sure if the pig is distracted (seeing the obsession chased, or someone else getting hit) then go to a box far away.
---
Her being able to see the boxes is part of her pressure which she needs at this point of time.
---
Who are you saying this to? The title from OP is simply suggesting an outfit for Kate. For you to jump right in and say things like this says more about what came to your mind more than what is actually being said...
---
I don’t have  this problem
---
When you try to take a photo but an earthquake, tsunami, tornado, and volcano eruption are in your house at the same time
---
This has tricked me so many times.  Even after I learned about it lol.
---
And its Trapper
---
😂😂😂 omg 🤣🤣 who 👌👌👌 *points to a dead claudette* 🤛🤛👍🤣 DiD. tHiS 👊👊💯💯😂 i cant breathe 😂😂😂 (neither can she (cause she dead 😂😂😂))
---
Oh damn, nice catch! I didn't see that. Now I totally agree, could've literally highlighted the area to screenshot and posted. Why the hell did he choose to take a picture of the computer?
---
Nail on the head!
---
The need to say Non Swf makes me think totally SWF
---
Fr
---
Thankyouuuu
---
Actually I had once a plague with two of these perks
---
That's easily counterable and leads to a hit. Trap-removals are literally impossible to counter (early game at least) and lead to death
---
If you call people snowflakes you're probably the snowflake
---
No. This is a terrible suggestion.
---
Let's see, last match you were against the Pig. Making no effort to be stealthy or pay attention to what she was doing, you ran straight at a Jigsaw box and died because she came to it? That's on you.
---
A killer's power is MEANT to benefit them. Knowing where survivors might be is an aspect of her power that gives her information and it's your job to think about your actions rather than assuming going down in one chase gives you a free pass for the rest of the match.
---
It isn't automatically "tunnelling" to chase anybody who has a trap on. They are stalled, they aren't dead, and a dead survivor is always better than one that isn't doing anything *for now.*
---
Since she got ridiculously nerfed and her traps do nothing in the end game now, it's also quite simple to get all 4 traps on at once. (Or situations like 2 survivors left both trapped) So what then? I'm supposed to just scratch my balls until I stumble upon someone in the middle of nowhere as punishment for an efficient early game?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
TL;DR: Having a RBT on your head doesn't make you immune to being hit. Play better.
---
Before I noticed it was supposed to be a Mario style I said to myself "Dwight looks like Luigi!"
---
&gt; I'm not talking about fixing matchmaking I'm talking about removing an unnecessary feature.
---
??
---
I'm not talking about matchmaking, not sure where you got that from.
---
&gt;There are often lockers near boxes anyway
---
Great then get in one and she won't know where you are.
---
&gt;and a Pig with any experience will know this and target you regardless. 
---
Nope and even if she does it doesn't matter because that makes her bad.
---
Much like facecamping - It's only viable to win with it if survs are total dogshit.
---
&gt;But you seem to be arguing that the aura isn't necessary, therefore you'd have no problem with it being removed, right?
---
I don't see it as necessary but I see it as a problem even less. So....
---
&gt;Also I'm a rank 1 killer main.
---
I find that very difficult to believe considering your main issue right now is pig tunneling, not spirit, nurse, billy, freddy, demo or any of the other killers who can tunnel far easier.
---
It stops rewarding bad killers with an easy tunnel to ruin a survivors game for an undeserved reason
---
Unless it's an swf team that's sandbagging and bullying the one survivor then it's okay to DC and watch them suffer.
---
Thanks, very appreciated.
---
Also, yeah, I need to change that)
---
Laughs in Inner Strength. Not that I heal against Legion to begin with but when the time for heal is needed, 8s is enough.
---
This build is practically perkless apart from STBFL. Sloppy Butcher doesn't do anything if you don't heal and with Inner Strength you don't even suffer from the slower healing. Nurse's Calling also doesn't do anything for the same reasons and healing in a locker negates it completely. Thanatophobia barely adds any time, the main effect is turning the bar red.
---
I mean facecamping is still a thing....?
---
Tunneling is also far easier on many other killers.
---
I understand how strong the mori is. I was just saying what use an ebony mori might have if you restricted yourself to death hook only.
---
If you say so!
---
Distressing for her terrible deviousness points and MAYBE Sloppy Butcher for more bleeding points and better blood trails. If you're getting mileage out of the other two you're either doing something very wrong, or slugging way too much.
---
Hell no, dbd fucking sucks if you aren't on green ping. I'd rather back out and wait another minute or two to get another lobby thsm stay in one where it wont be enjoyable and I'll die within 2 minutes.
---
I understand the context now, I just didn't understand initially why that would be suspicious coming from a Michael? You'd expect it no?
---
Awesome work. Nice to see some Legion cosplay with some effort put in. Behaviour could use this as actual marketing material.
---
Sorry for trying to share an opinion. I often forget Redditors like to ignore logic and cannot bear to be wrong
---
Hehe thanks, trying my best♥️ And omg that would be awesome haha!
---
Unpopular opinion: I couldn't tell the difference between P2P and servers
---
He meant there is no killer XD
---
Legion needs a freddy style rework cause their power is so pointless, you cant even down survivors with it just midly annoy them
---
I had the same problem few months ago for Decisive Strike.
---
I sent a message to the DBD Support team and the very next day they solved the problem.
---
Yeah, I am a good guy.
---
So is Billy, Leatherface, Myers and Ghost Face.
---
She’d probs kill me.  No thanks 😁
---
i also post my art to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/outcaststars/)
---
Hardcore DnD fans must be pissed about this the same as OP about his cousin.
---
Did I mention it *stacks?*
---
What is a coslpay
---
bell with hope: literally the same speed as 110% killers
---
or when i use Deliverance
---
found first. EVERY. FUCKING. TIME!
---
I kind of like it, sounds like an actual slasher movie scream. Much prefer it over Jane and Steve’s luscious moans when they’re impaled by the entity.
---
If by everyone, you mean everyone without a brain then yes.
---
Noticed his nipples are so close together xD it looks so weird!
---
He is our cutie
---
I think, maybe cause he got red emblems on legion, who knows
---
So true, you can have that😂
---
That won’t work killers like him who have no chase potential he needs 115 base
---
I’ve done this - had to literally apologize after for concussing a David.
---
Even against doctor there's Restraint which is one of his best add-ons.
---
Most Scary : Between tier 1 myers because Spine Chill doesn't work, or the Hag's traps that ALWAYS get me off guard.
---
Least Scary : A lot of them actually, Doctor, Legion, Bubba... They aren't scary to play against and most of the time aren't the best.
---
Most Fun : Would pick Plague or Billy. Both are one-shot killers in their own way, Plague is a rush to play as safe as possible, and Billy is Using Windows 101, and it always feels good to avoid their Puke/Chainsaw at the last second. Baby Nurse is also high in that ranking.
---
Most Annoying : Probably a good Nurse, or a Spirit, both are pretty unfun to play against.
---
&gt;Sorry for trying to share an **opinion.** I often forget Redditors like to ignore **logic**
---
Lul, anyway I'm done with this conversation.
---
Goodluck getting pig nerfed.
---
Considering how close Netflix were involved with BHVR with the ST chapter, I think it’s very likely Steve, Nancy and Demogorgon will get cosmetics further down the road. Like, I’m pretty certain they will.
---
Lol the fuckin irony of this horseshit is palpable, literally every update is a killer nerf of some sort (Nurse again btw) cause entitled survivors like yourself cant tolerate the slightest bit of challenge which is why you all derank &amp; or use a low rank survivor to get brand new players who just started playing to bully like the weak sociopathic egotists you are, ill be more than happy for players like you to just fuck off &amp; stop playing
---
It's "a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character." That, according to Google haha. Hope you understand now c:
---
i legit once thought that this dwight in a corner was a totem and i went to him trying to cleanse lmao.
---
Actually it was nurses and sloppy
---
LOOK AT FENG WHAT LMAO
---
Cool
---
Look you seem like the type of person that feels some type of way about literally anything, and no one here is going to convince you otherwise.
---
So go ahead and enjoy your negativity, wallow in it, because the rest of us will either enjoy taking or giving this lighthearted gesture, and you can sit there and throw a tantrum everytime your abusive ex possess's the killer and "DeEmS YoU WoRThy Of THe HAtcH"
---
Some people
---
Play better
---
Yeah DS is still pretty broken if it activities in the endgame.
---
60 seconds is a loooooooong time when the gates are opened.
---
What a fucking hero!
---
Do you run any of the following perks?
---
-Self-care
---
-Dead Hard/Sprint burst/Balanced Landing/Lithe
---
-Urban Evasion
---
-Borrowed Time
---
-Adrenaline
---
-Decisive strike
---
If the answer is yes, then you have no right to complain.
---
Sincerely, fellow survivor main :)
---
Please... no more of this suggestion. I can feel myself dying more and more every time I see it.
---
Kool Killers Klub or the pg version Cool Cillers Club
---
Ignore that killer that was very well played by her. If anyone says doing your best to complete your objectives and goals is toxic they're just bad and sore losers. Goes for both survivors and killers
---
well then to make it intresting, lets add something else to that part, two words **phantom hits**, what these will be are hits that come from being too close to these disguised players, all things that happen when you get hit happen, the player is not notified if they get hit by a phantom hit.Should they get hit twice they go down, each state will heal itself after say 30 seconds, same time in the dying state and they are healed back to full, this will make them question if they got hit by the killer and they are a survivor with more mistakes happening.
---
honestly since freddy is fake pallet king now, i want this effect on doctor to replace the pallet add-on.
---
Hag and trapper I really hate to go against, I'm constantly looking in the grass for the trapper traps, and I'm constantly crouching in case of a hag trap
---
I read the title in Mario's voice XD
---
I saw this before, don't even act
---
Ah I didn’t know you meant it like that, my bad
---
Touch my butthole
---
Lol calling people rednecks randomly, at least I attack your stupidity not where you live or your appearance, Chad.
---
I guess you wanna keep abusing the system plus even you don't know that so what? God damn, you really love to be a coward dcing huh
---
I get them really quickly for survivor at rank 13 but you might have a more difficult time if you are a higher rank (I also play in Australia).
---
I cant recall the last time I saw an iri hatchet user. It's got to be at least a year. Huntress seems incredibly rare in general these days.
---
I was wondering why i couldn't see the left bottom then i looked closer XD
---
I actually really like using Pill Bottle. People never really expect and you can easily sneak up on people with it.
---
Yeah, most of the new maps are generally really bad for her. Huntress mains are dying out
---
The ranking system is warped, the 8K cap per category is bad and the most engaging part of the gameplay ends up with being the least engaging(From running around to being tunneled or camped) with far too little point gain and no way to pip on it
---
Actually i dont, dwight main here i run 
---
Prove thyself
---
Bond
---
No one left behind
---

---
i wonder why you would want this?
---
Oh hey, someone with 100% instead of bragging about the console platinum for doing like 25% of achievements.
---
Great job!
---
For real!
---
How is this a shitpost? I fucking love it!
---
He defend people who DC for whatever reason like a white knight, what do you expect
---
Moose would like to know your location
---
Yep. This map is good even for normal Myers, easiest spots for stalks.
---
The entity icon is just an icon and some perks have to do something with the obsession (entity icon survivor)
---
And the item thing is just that you used up all of the item, most people keep a little bit so you may have it back if you survive
---
Ohhhh yeah
---
This is very clearly an alt account owned by op cause they are disputing the argument no one made and only existing for an hour
---
Ruin? Sure. Barbecue? 8 out of 10 matches. NOED is not a good perk if you know how to play so you rarely see it as you rank up. Overcharge I never see.
---
Yo tf did you do
---
I do the same!!
---
I think killers could get some cool emotes too
---
I don’t understand how this connection was made and I appreciate it regardless.
---
How the f....literally go to a loop is the counter. 105 MS and looping  is a bad time as killer
---
I can't remember the name of the streamer, but he made a good point after having 4 survivors bag him at the gates before escaping. It was "wanna teabag for me a bit? And you guys wonder why you keep getting nurses and spirits"
---
It's unfortunate that more people aren't playing characters that they're having fun with, but nowadays you gotta do what you gotta do as killer. If they're playing nurse and spirit with strong add ons, they likely just ended a match with some toxic survivors and are letting off some steam. 
---
The only thing I can say is just finish off the match with them and try not to be disgusting. They'll most likely go back to their original character after some time. It also doesn't help that I've encountered a new lithe glitch that makes the survivors impossibly fast. I'd say the only way to get past it is nurse but I don't know since I think the glitch is fairly new, since it was the first time I encountered it. I just left the match, because I honestly didn't wanna put up with it. 
---
I lost sympathy for survivors. There have been games that had me drop leatherface or demogorgon so I could pull out my super powerful silent trap hag build for the next unfortunate batch of survivors. The only survivors I go easy on are default dwights. I don't care about anyone else's fun otherwise. I wish there was a sort of reputation system that let you rate others, so anyone else can see how they've been rated in the past, and if it's a low score, you'll know whether you want to try hard or not.
---
Can we have it on Jane Romero instead?
---
People jumping in lockers wen i have the infinite tombstone build as myers, preventing me from getting the evil incarnate achiev.
---
For those who can’t tell, depicted in this pic is Dwight and the (Dragon) Trapper.
---
Basically I tried to do a little challenge where I drew some of the killerd as dragons, trying to incorporate their designs and traits as much as possible (i.e the hooks and metal shards, metal plates, the sword-tail, etc). I kinda lost inspiration though, but I have another one I did of the Huntress if anyone’s interested.
---
Even his hair has given up
---
I wish I knew
---
Laughs in inner strength
---
Can someone explain why Lerys is ideal for scratched mirror?
---
And squirrel?
---
But when you bodyblock the killer, the killer can just slash them to down them?
---
Am I the only one to scream in pain even if I have Iron will ?
---
Edit : I'm on pc
---
Sorry man, you lost me there...
---
I like dying light. Good perk. Obviously people in higher ranks are gonna say thats not a good set up. Just had another game playing against ghostface (prestige 2) we escaped. But two survivors disconnected towards the end of the game. When the game finished, he was running bbq and chilli, noed and ruin. its not a coincidence, its common.
---
Edit: i took a screenshot if anybody wants me to prove it.
---
All of the Halloween skins this year have been leaked, and none of them are for Steve. I personally was hoping for a Halloween 2018 Myers outfit too, so I guess both of us are disappointed. However, the skins that ARE coming out are badass. I LOVE Clown’s- it’s terrifyingly beautiful.
---
im new to the game guys, and i like the golden feng min one.. is it still available somewhere? or is it some magical super rare stuff???
---
This legion is a disgrace to us 7 legion mains
---
true but the legion pin helps counter that since you're broken for a minute
---
They're called beavers
---
If i am nurse, spirit, hag its a sign i am winning
---
For survivor its when i am hooked once and i see people on gens and only 1 person going for the save
---
Good for you.
---
But i do get the reference
---
Good Gen grab Spirits will often counter spine chill by looking behind them while they approach the gen, making the perk almost entirely useless.
---
Sexy time has begun
---
I like how you're getting downvoted for asking everyone to stick through the game since dcing doesn't help, and they're just lose points. At this point survivor mains deserve to get nurses and spirits.
---
Then the other three dc and he’s left alone as he deserves
---
No ones even remotely triggered though. No one cares about this but you think it’s such a massive deal to make 2 alt accounts to make it seem like at least 1 person agrees with you
---
Dedicated servers don’t make the money BHVR needs to pay employees to help make dedicated servers. Also, companies can dedicate their resources to multiple tasks simultaneously.
---
Dedicated servers are in development right now. Personally, i’d much rather watch the PTB shitfest and enjoy steady improvement of said servers than have them release servers that make P2P look like a dream to the main game.
---
Yellow = Maximum intensity
---
Orange = Fading Out
---
I'm more proud of you for bloodborne tbh...you're a human of culture
---
ok but she do be lookin kinda quirky and fresh doe
---
do it
---
I know! It's a pretty open map as well so I couldn't even sneak up on them. Think they just got overconfident.
---
This is actually the exact build I might start using regularly on Legion once they buff the pins, though I might switch out STBFL for M&amp;A to capitalize on survivors being injured for so long and sneak up on them.
---
He's basic yellow and brown addons are boring af, but red and purple is good and maybe a little bit broken in right combination, and he don't need addons btw, since he one if the best M1 in the game.
---
Problem with no mither is it advertises the fact you can pick yourself up, so no one will ever slug.
---
I know you're joking but still
---
Dope meme
---
I feel like it could go the other way around aswell. All the times I've been called toxic, genrushing idiot or tryhard cause killer couldn't get their 4k.
---
Best part is when you're 4 solo survivors and the killer accusses you of being SWF cause you did well.
---
Okay, yeah, but that build is so stupid fun
---
It is. I see many survivors saying "sweaty killers" all the time, but if someone uses a fun/troll build they shame you out for not running meta perks. It's hilarious
---
Nice attempt to save a teammate...
---
Camping killer?
---
So what could i have done to better earn that emblem? 3 iridescents, 12 hooks, no gates powered, no camping, and the killers power used to absolute efficiency. Let them heal and M1 them more? when i come up to a survivor in a trap i suppose i could wait for them to struggle free so a chase can begin then M1 them afterwards.
---
I have it just cause i have all the perks i can unlock on my nea
---
Always funny when a level 12 player tells you about the meta...
---
Actually if you watch you see i was making the run to go save them but they suicided so...
---
You are a claudette its very probably that you deserve it
---
Where did it specifically said he is camping?
---
I agree completely with you. I dc'ed two days ago intentional. For the second time in three years. I have a full-time job and a family, so my gaming time with friends is very limited. We played against iri head huntress which tunneled me straight off the hook. I don't mind games that aren't going well but that was utterly bullshit. So we both disconnected to have a fun game
---
At least put this on the clown. Then I’ll approve :)
---
It is funny. Your teammates are boring. It's like some people resent having fun in this game.

she straight vibin fr fr
---
well, Bubbas are famous for facecamping, this one wasn't and exception
---
Yeah i understand plagues pain too, vomiting on them then going to vomit on the next nearby person means you just lost chase with the first person.
---
But im not tho, im not telling people how to play or what to pick or what not to pick. Im just pointing it out its very common those 3 perks. Noed, ruin and bbq. I guess your gonna say because im rank 10 im trash?
---
Hexy tunneling/camping 90% of the times, i still enjoy watching him lol
---
I'm play Pig as main killer at this moment. Best tip i can give is do not finish gens if someone has a trap on they head. Main point of Pig is when someone activate trap, that survivor stop working on gens and start search on Jigsaw box, so it is become 3x1 or even 2x1, 1x1. In that case survivors most likely are screwed, because they will be unable to escape anyways since they have traps and death timer are on. Pig traps ale limited, and when survivors drop out most of the Pig traps, it is very easy to finish gens and escape in my opinion. You can finish gens when there is only one survivor has a trap, but when there is 2 or more, finish the gens is not a good idea in my opinion. Most of my games where i got 4k and control over the game happens when 2 or more survivors have activated traps on them.
---
- Description: Could not heal teammate as well as other teammate could not heal them either. They did not have any statuses that would cause this. 
---
- Reproduction rate: happened only once
---
What suprised me is that Nancy and Steve's faces are great, but their voice actors sound NOTHING like them at all.
---
Scorpionz is calling her "a swamp noodle"
---
Cheers for the help
---
Right? Elle is awesome! I'd love for this to be a skin
---
I always take kindred. Expect to be camped by whoever the killer is, never expect anythin else
---
I understand, but brown mist offerings straight up feel like they are doing nothing, because they are.
---
Still around. You've just got trash luck.
---
Farming blood points was we? Haha
---
\#letquentinbeugly
---
- Description: Could not drop pallet. (Happened in the same game where I died on 2nd hook because the sruggling did not register). I was against a doctor and I was in tier 3, but I was not shocked recently, and I was standing at the pallet for more than a second and it did not prompt the drop pallet interaction.
---
3 MINUTES OF PLAYTIME
---
Ok, hear me out, she just needs something to help her out in a chase. Maybe like giving hindered to people you use vile purge on.
---
Jane sounds great!
---
Inner strengh intensifies
---
Hag is the most scary(I just can't stand her jumping out of nothing on me, it gets me every time), least scary Cannibal(almost any killer is scary right now but lets say Canibal is the least), most fun Billy(he's intimidating, not so easy to beat but not extremely hard too), most annoying Trapper(I just step into every trp, I hate Trapper).
---
A benefit for some low level influencers as well
---
what do you mean coming back? arent they still here on live
---
No, they're not.
---
Literally everyone says this and I have the exact opposite experience on ps4. Survivor wait times (red/purple rank) are like 5+ mins constantly. Sometimes 10 or 15. 
---
Killer ques for me (rank 1-2) are consistently under 30 seconds. Very rarely it will take around 90 seconds tops.
---
Well I’m sure Quentin has been getting less than 4 hours of sleep every night
---
Monika &lt;3
---
***god dammit***
---
Have you ever been grabbed by Pig?
---
It was supposed to be left behind but they saw how broken it was so they didnt add it
---
No, why...
---
Slight effect is still better than a slight chance for a giant effect
---
Legion with Sloppy against people who self care every time they get hit is S tier.
---
Ok dude keep acting like you are smart, mb one day you will be smarter then wall. I suggest that you learn to admit your mistakes.
---
Lots of line-of-sight blockers. If you’re in a chase and they try to abuse a strong loop, you just leave and watch them with your addon. As soon as they leave, jumpscare! 
---
You can also cut people off quite easily.
---
The map is kinda big for 105 but you can use Ruin (to slow the game down, just a little bit) and devour hope or make your choice to make it easier to get downs. Obv you have monitor and abuse. Last perk could be discordance, BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, play with your food, etc.
---
Escreveu não leu, o pau comeu!
---
I’ll have to try Hawkins with Meyers. I hate it as Legion and Spirit but had fun as Trapper with the map.
---
Min and Doctor
---
Kate and Clown
---
Dwight and Trapper
---
Ash and Crippling alcholism
---
You seem to think that the game is 1v1 times 4. It's not, it's 1v4. It's 1 killer vs 4 survivors as a team.
---
If 1 player gets face camped, then other 3 can gen rush and grab a free win. If 1 player gets face camped and 1-3 of the other survivors take the killer's bait, then it's on those survivors for taking that risk.
---
They won’t heal normally and glow green.
---
You don’t need them to bleed more because of the glow and the increase in healing time will never have an effect
---
I didn't know that but thanks for bringing it to my attention.
---
All main attacks trigger sloppy butcher, as long as it injures a survivor, a special attack will as well.
---
It's a way to generate map pressure. He does well consistently on worse killers cos of it. It means less people on gems and plus you can affect the emotional state of the survivors like people will panic if they see 2 team mates slugged and make bad decisions like suicide rescues etc
---
Twitch streamers have some of the worst egos in gaming and it is completely disheartening to see. A very large chunk of them will use their followers/viewers to gang up on anyone who challenges them. It's toxic behaviour, but unfortunately that's just Twitch culture.
---
Oh wow! I need to attempt this even though i barely play killer, I’m sure i could see some crazy stuff even at rank 18 killer, but I’d feel bad for the people I’m killing, but who’s to say they’re not like me in the opposite way by just barely playing survivor.. still gonna try this. Thanks!
---
Normally I’m against tea bagging survivors but in this instance that mofo deserved it.
---
They took them out for now
---
Because it doesn’t matter. Just quit whining and ignore them. Seriously. Who gives a shit what someone says to you online in a game? Just go to the next game.
---
They gathered data and will work on them a bit more
---
The release time is set to “this fall”. There might be another test soon tho
---
Dude. This is so freaking good
---
Nancy’s face is great?
---
Do we see different models or something?
---
Personally I’d take Nancy over Jane any day.
---
Hes the sexiest male surv
---
*ahegao intensifies*
---
I'm actually using the Ohmwrecker mask and sometimes the Halloween set but I saw that mask and I loved a lot
---
I hope she made A lots of  L Ö Ö P
---
Most scary: Michael (my heart falls out of my ass when I see him suddenly standing right behind me) or Hag (I start panicking when I step in every fucking trap). Least scary Huntress. Shes good and all but I don't freak out when I see her. Most fun to go against would be either Nurse (I love seeing her blink everywhere) or Plague (I just love Plague). Least fun to go against is a 3 way tie between Legion (Im going to spend the whole damn game mending), Ghostface (I'm going to get camped on the hook), or Piggy (shes going to tunnel me to death)
---
And you're complaining about a build that is basicly like playing the purist challenge
---
Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes the smallest details can ruin things. It's all up to opinions though :)
---
Or the guy is toxic or you provoked him which is ussualy the reason.
---
The hardest counter to Pig and Ghostface tbh. When I realize someone has spine chill I just start crab walking towards gens to avoid setting it off.
---
Love the art, but I gotta spread my propoganda here.
---
The best combo for Ash is Pablo's Handiwork, The Wastelander, and Savior's Slacks. Fight me.
---
Holy frick luigi is like 6'4
---
I was actually thinking a Telltale Walking Dead chapter would be cool. Like have Lee or Clementine as a survivor and maybe a zombie as a killer.
---
Fuck you too :)
---
Finally, some good fucking OC.
---
that was the last one I did as well  
---
somehow it's bugged... can't wrap my finger around how though.
---
Sometimes I didn't even close the hatch or the last survivor found it first and I still got +1 achievement progress... one game I got +2 because three survivors had a key and went through it, I closed it immediately, it opened again and closed it again (closed it twice that match). 
---
It's super bugged, you'll get it by finishing killer matches pretty much haha
---
I understand that the Demogorgon is a monster from another dimension, but you didn’t need too shatter his entire skeletal structure when Spidey kicked him.
---
Idk I feel like Meg’s screams, at least when she’s hooked, sound pretty good. Her screams when she gets downed, not so much (it sounds like she tripped or something).
---
Hey Genrushers! It’s the Super Survivor Super Show! 
---
We’re the Toxic Genrushers and Loopin’s our game,
---
We’re not like the Youtubers who get all the fame
---
If your rank is in trouble, you can call us on the double
---
We’re more altruistic than the others, you’ll be hooked on the survivors!
---
This is why I most of the Times use Left Behind. I expect to lose the Round due to Shitty Teammates, because doing 5 Gens alone with Ruin just doesn't work most of the times, so I gotta look for the Hatch. If the others aren't ready to try to Survive then I gotta look to Survive myself.
---
I don't understand some GFs. I had one where it was all normal, then he hooks me as you do, and he decides to go into stealth right in front of me in the open. 
---
I think he wanted me to not reveal him, which is silly, so I reveal him then he just starts nodding and T-bagging me all the way from first hook to dead. I did nothing to him up until that point really, fun guy.
---
Hand free... ;D
---
i once closed it and it didnt count i refreshed it and all that but never became part of my progress
---
Haha brilliant.
---
such a description for a dream I'd like to see all of that in a rework for him
---
This is amazing
---
I can just so vividly remember what happened in the dream, the Legion had a new mask on him too. It was Joey’s skin and the mask was similar to Wrench’s mask in Watch Dogs 2 which lighted up and also spoke in distortion while in game: it was so weird.
---
It’s for all those random itches that only seem to happen when you’re working on a gen and need to focus.
---
yup, happened to me too  
---
I wasn't mad about that though since I got progress for other matches for it being bugged so it kinda balanced itself out
---
having the ability to morph into a survivor could be some potentially scary stuff
---
/r/killthecameraman
---
A "zero-gennys fix" win should be an achievement, not a playstyle.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
Probably an add-on, to change up his power ability a bit. Like a Bubba except, it’s quite bloodier.
---
If an Infinite Tombstone Myers actually manages to stalk enough people to get to Tier 3, he deserves to get those moris.
---
Only way hes good lol.
---
It's totally pointless to use Sloppy on her. And thanataphobia
---
ive got 10/30 lets hope i will get it next week
---
Well you’re supposed to sacrifice them. Sometimes when I hook someone I see and idiot trying to bait me while I also see another guy try to sneak up. I’m not dumb so I’ll just proxy until they get downed or learn that what they do is soooo obvious
---
Love seeing cute games like this lol. Hope everyone got mad points too
---
Yes. Fear it.
---
An Outlast chapter for dbd has always been on my wishlist... I don't think it'd be a bad move at all for Red Barrels to get a little more out of Outlast.
---
killers can play fair and make a 4k, they will choose to be sweaty and tunnel or prox camp If they are losing, and that's fair since killers are in control, survivors can't play fair since they don't make choices there, they either do gen fast or stay at killer control. That's why survivors bitch so much, they want to be the strong side, meanwhile that's why killers bitch when they don't get 4-3k every match, they want to always be the power role.
---
Evolve was a great game but, well we all know what the publisher did to that
---
Depends on what perks you really want, if there’s something you’re waiting for in the shrine it’d be best to wait or save 11k shards in order to have enough for a shrine perk.
---
9k shards for Corrupt Intervention, Dark Devotion, and Infectious Fright along with a killer is a good deal though, plague can be very fun.
---
He is not joking? So he seriously, unsarcastically thinks running no mither and self care together is smart? I dont believe you.
---
Like did you reply to the wrong person? Did you read what I replied to? Are you trolling me right now?
---
Me with Second Wind and Deliverance. Every time I'm running them, I'm the first one to get hooked. I finally take it off, and all of a sudden I'm getting safe hook saves left and right.
---
I already got Infectious from the shrine a week or two back but yeah I thought it would be a decent deal, thanks for the reply :)
---
I'm not in your time zone, sorry. Just curiosity.
---
Ohhhh, you got meeee! aren't you a smart one...Dumb as fuck XD Actually I look at this DBD reddit regularly without an account for all the shit posts and memes because I am a regular player with my husband but I saw this and saw all of you getting triggered while saying you are not just made me laugh so fucking hard. Why is how old my account is relevant to this post or the comment I made? I don't even care, This is so funny and the triggering is still happening apparently.. it's called a trigger for a reason... the OP triggered you to waste your valuable time commenting on a post that literally everyone will forget about in a few hours... Hell even I was triggered.. here I am typing XD I honestly see everyone doing shit like this all the time on here triggering people and it is just as funny as the memes.. so go ahead, please, think I am OP it is only more funny for everyone and OP probably .. that's why it was posted.. DUH.. the amount of drama this post has stirred alone is extremely amusing.. honestly though why would OP make another account just to say it's a joke XD there's nothing clear about your statement.. gawd
---
As for Vital IT, I did not really know how to make a perk centered around objective, but not be absolutely useless (as most of perks of those kinds are). So, I made it so. 
---
I am not sure if it is absolutely broken, as the bonus is not that great, plus there will always be opportunity cost — in this case, not picking extra chase perk. 
---
Legacy of Unbreakable — the idea is to give survivors tool to combat insta-downs in a way. However, I am not sure how to fix.... I will edit it. Furthermore, it will be very useless if you go against against a killer without this capability.
---
Hunter’s tools is very similar to flare gun in Indentity.. The difference is that this requires you to burn very rare item, one perk slot, and you cannot use it in chase. So, I am fairly certain that one-time hit or miss stun is OK as it is.
---
No. But NOED you won't see much in higher ranks and especially not Overcharge. That's 50% of your 4 "meta perks" not being meta perks meaning your statement is lackluster and your rank/experience doesn't exactly give you authority or integrity.
---
Hit the red ranks, play for a few seasons, then come back and educate others about the game's meta.
---
Hey buddy, you ah just blow in from stupid town
---
New Killer: The Living Fear
---
I'm a killer main, I don't run that set up. NOED is for scrubs and Overcharge at red ranks is useless. Hell, even Ruin is useless. I don't know if everyone suddenly is god-like at hitting Great Skill Checks or skill checks never pop up. That and 95% of the time, Ruin spawns next to a survivor. The other 5%, next to a generator.
---
Ah kos, or some say kosm...
---
Killing all 4 survivors usually result in a Entity Displeased so its a Lose/Lose
---
He also has one that essentially gives him wallhacks
---
Shrine is good but depending on your free time you can make up enough for 1 or 2 perks by next week. 
---
 
---
Why would you consider spending iri shards on a cosmetic over a character when a character can do oh so much more. 
---
A Character can do so much more then a outfit can. Oh you look fancy neat. 
---
A character gives you a whole character to play. It also comes along with perks to help make more build. 
---
But i guess it’s your choice, hopefully the fashion police don’t come arrest me lol.
---
Thanks, I’ll probably level up leatherface. I’m just seeing what others have to say and if there was a better killer to level up before leatherface. :)
---
This is awesome. I would totally watch this show!
---
I really want more of this
---
I thought it was obvious, but as I see that there are some people that don't understand the sarcasm, then I need to declare that it was indeed, a sarcastic comment which was made to make you loudly exhale air through your nose, and it didnt described my actual opinion on perks known as: "Unbreakable", "No Mither" and "Selfcare" in indie assymetrical multiplayer horror game known as "Dead by Daylight" developed and published by Behaviour Interactive
---
I agree and disagree.
---
The first part I agree with, but I also think not every killer camps and salty killer mains only make up 40% of the subreddit, then 30% regular killer mains and 30% survivor mains. But really this “us vs them” mentality should end.
---
Never once did i say “meta perks” just that its common to see those 3 perks, and im allowed just like everyone else to to say somthin if i want to, its probably not seen in red ranks, I wont know. just because my rank/experience doesnt give me authority or integrity as you say doesnt mean im not allowed to point somthin out because YOU SAY SO.
---
Give him a chainsaw while they’re at it, maybe a few nurse blinks for good measure.
---
Edit: I made a joke but OP wants legitimate discussion, no need to be hateful or downvote him to hell because you disagree
---
Ya name is mama? MAMA DWIGHT?!
---
Yeah I would never have thought in a thousand years the grim reaper would clone himself...
---
If anything I would have his power tie in dealing with the soul. 
---
But is the grim reaper evil? He’s just a buddy that guides you to eternal damnation, the last good guy you get to see.
---
Just going by category he has more lmao
---
Dream pallets

Did I miss any?
---
Sorry but his hand is so small I just picture it’s chuckys hand lol.
---
The entitlement is insane.
---
Yep, very frustrating when they take out their frustration on you for no reason. It’s like I triggered something in him. Or maybe one of the random survivors on my team did something. Still not an excuse to take it out on me. Then make the person who BM’d you your target If you decide to give up on the match anyway and to BM.
---
a good killer can if it's solo or swf. it's like day night difference.
---
He's also a boring edgy teenager with the most poorly thought power in the game.
---
I DC’d 2 times. Once after my whole team disconnected and the Killer wouldn’t leave me alone for one second (I regret doing that)and another time when this Nea was unhooking everyone in the middle of a chase (she probably wanted the hatch or something) and the Freddy played like a tool and put us all back on the hook every time.
---
So we all got hooked and when this one person unhooked herself the nea started healing her and kept failing on purpose,only to abandon her and run to the hatch after she died.I don’t even know why,my whole team just lost all of their add-ons and it almost felt like she wanted that to happen.
---
The fan base is trash and the games are severely over saturated at this point, but FNAF really isn’t a bad premise for a solo-developer indie horror game. The dev had inspiration beyond wanting to build upon the late 2000’s success of the Slender games, and if the community hadn’t trashed it as they did it would probably be a memorable, positively looked upon game. You’d think a game built around jump scares would get boring pretty quick, but playing the first one I could tell the developer made good use of visuals, sound, and mechanics to create an eery ambiance as well as to build tension which made jump scares all the more effective. Can’t say anything about the other 30 or so games since I haven’t played them.
---
The decayed bunny thing fits in nicely with the aesthetic and character design of DBD, and after being able to get the rights to Stranger Things an indie game like FNAF would be a piece of cake. Only real hurdles would be creating new animations to make the killer seem doll-like; there would probably be some backlash from the community due to the game’s infamy as well, sadly.
---
Officer leathercock reporting for duty!
---
Ok, got the wrong room. And I've done the hatch but didn't get the achievement/trophy. That was like a year and a half ago. Still angers me to this day. It's so hard for me because i don't play SWF. That day, the stars aligned, we did all 5 gens, the hatch spawned on the road in Haddonfield, someone brought a key, we all escaped. Didn't get it 😭
---
WAHOO DAVID
---
No, I use the official editing app called ShareFactory on PlayStation to export clips and edit them, and for some reason, even after I untick every box, the PS4 logo always plays at the end.
---
That's another point, we have WAY too many Spirit and Nurse, survivor are already full of shit because you barely have counter to those killer, so when people face a unexperienced Spirit/nurse they go full shit
---
The whole concept behind Legion, from the way he looks to the way he works is F tier at best though.
---
He's not fun to play as and not fun to play against either, that's how bad he really is.
---
I love it
---
I don't need Deliverance for that
---
Its not like we glorify getting flashlights in our faces either,we DC when someone is using a clearly unfair build with no chance for anyone.
---
I could easily leave and play against a good player.
---
Hahahahaha. Thanks for the laugh. :D Random Meg wasn’t useless. I know, what a shocker. Lol Gotta break the labels!
---
haha reminds me of that one time when I did it with friends and everyone got it except for the last person to jump in.  
---
that was almost a year ago though, I'm pretty sure they fixed it now.
---
I wish I would've gotten DBD sooner so that I could've gotten those goodies. When's the next year of the dog?
---
Jesus, that’s ridiculous. Range should be a MINIMUM of 20 meters, without any addons.
---
Nancy and Steve are just awesome, it's only Quentin and Laurie that look questionable.
---
When you try push your opinion as a fact and get mad at people for disagreeing with you then guess what? People will give you shit. 
---
You're idea is terrible. 
---
Tunnelers will tunnel, but pig doesn't need nerfs just cause a few might tunnel with them.
---
I mean, many of the killers in this game arent technically "evil" the ones that wouldnt kill for sport willingly, were bent to the entity's will to do so.
---
I love playing against the Pig. She is actually an interactive killer, you gotta search for the boxes and stay alert for her ambush. I guess Spirit and Nurse are more fun to play against
---
nea
---
It's always been like this, it always will be like this, and everyone will still complain about it when even BHVR tells them why.
---
That would not help against a SWF group. It would not significantly buff the killer up to anywhere near Nurse, Billy, or Spirit. That is the goal: have more higher Tier killers so there is more variety’. More traps, or all traps, at the start would be an improvement, but it wouldn’t move him out of the lowest Tiers. 
---
Disarming a bear trap should make you vulnerable. That means if someone is going around just disarming your traps, they can be punished for it. It makes a survivor really have to think about if they should disarm or just avoid the trap. It is like the decision to Clense against the Plague.
---
No, this is Spider-Man
---
Dwight's Spirit cowboy impression is so offensive that Ash's Mettle of Man practically explodes and he is unable to ask  Dwight to stop being so fucking toxic.
---
The flair is "Discussion". 
---
It's just an opinion. Give us something else instead of being aggressive towards someone's opinion.
---
Should've been fixed back then. I hate it, it haunts me.
---
It's about as nonsensical as most of meme culture. Just something we all decided was funny.
---
A hunter is a hunter, even in a dreeeam.
---
The only one that I’m not sure isn’t evil is the plague.
---
Take this upvote and get this bullshit out of my sight
---
No god no I play trapper and I don’t  want that and nobody else does you might but just give him his traps base kit, make him be able to replace them without having to pick them up
---
And your eight? Ahahahaah 
---
That’s actually the best birthday cake I’ve ever seen
---
Like when my mom used to care about my birthdays 
---
Just go to a random store and get it 
---
And it’s always like super small or smth weird
---
It's not even when I'm playing spirit, it's when I play anyone. There should honestly be more spirits or nurses nowadays because at this point survivors are doing their best to piss me off and ruin my game. I'm doing my best not to be toxic to these little shits but the still want to go out of their way to be little dick heads.
---
Facts
---
He did. He got flashbacks of legion 1.0 that he gave you exactly how it felt to him.
---
Laughs in ash main
---
Oh well I guess you're fucked then
---
So let me get this right you bring up flair and then is  like this is discussion not for aggressive comments...... I then tell you what it sounds like, then explain it and instead of discussing how I'm wrong or  whatever.... You just say okay?
---
I only bring self care when I'm bringing a medkit, and a "getting chased" build, since I plan to make the killer give up on me
---
True.
---
Also, if Grim Reaper helps souls to go to the underworld... the survivors are pretty much in a Purgatory so it would be cool to have someone that helps survivors but they also don't want that help because they think they are still alive and want to escape
---
Steve _The Hair_ Harrington and Quentin _The Heroin_ Smith.
---
I mean in-chase counterplay. Playing immersed isn’t fun for anyone, and DBD is all about learning from your opponent to outwit them. If you can’t see what they’re doing, how can you do that?
---
The classic Demogorgon looks so good.
---
A tentacle 2-Headed Baboon.
---
Wow.
---
I don’t get it , I’m not a PS4 owner
---
They're fantastic!  Another asked for a selfie with us!
---
They wouldn’t and that’s also my experience. But if you stop, and I stop, then we won’t have clips like this in the future anymore. So even if it costs us our lives sometimes, we gotta try. But we also need to make sure to take care of ourselves and to not be reckless. 
---
NOED? Carefully check known Totem spots. If unsuccessful, leave. 
---
Killer is camping? Carefully evaluate the situation. Wait for an opening. If there’s absolutely nothing you can do, leave. 
---
My point is: If we don’t try, who else will?
---
I think the lore says he gets 0 hours of sleep thanks to his diet of pills and caffine
---
When you’re shaking in place, and she pukes in your face, that’s a mori!
---
Starting with all the traps and allowing them to refresh like Hag traps would definitely be an improvement, but I don’t think the devs would ever do that. They would have to program something for when the trap to disappear back into inventory is being actively disarmed. 
---
Also, it would be even more powerful than bloody coil. It allows for nearly completely shutting down someone in the basement. You get someone in the basement (or anywhere for that matter) and then lay down all 10 traps. Survivors will practically never be able to unhook. Trapper would be the new Bubba. The DC’s would be worse than Legion’s were. 
---
Bloody coil drastically increases Trapper lethality, makes him higher Tier, but also allows for counterplay. Good survivors don’t heal against Plague and they can still win. It creates a slowdown if survivors want to heal, or they can risk being 1 shot. They also have to weigh disarming traps when a killer is around.
---
I'm sure that a year ago it never took so long and I never played vs that ranks when I am 6 or 7 ranks lowers
---
Got all the achievements for the base game, pretty much
---
The sooner you get on that gen , the better. 2 people on a gen is faster than 1 person, that 32 seconds you spent healing is literally more than half a gen if you account for the other person.
---
If you feel unsafe, that other person healing you is still more efficient time wise, if you want to just heal yourself, then use a med kit which is literally the same but 2x faster at least.
---
Nice man but you guys did have great cosplays I'm sure loads of people would want selfies with you
---
I see many clips get posted on this subreddit with people then leaving comments like, “Of course SWF! Toxic!”
---
I wanted to eliminate those comments and people from my post from the get-go. I’m a 100% solo survivor. That’s why I put it in the title.
---
Wtf how many hours do you have in this game? You mad man
---
This reminds back of the old day where I watched Super Mario
---
Lmao what the actual fuck
---
The maze from the movie would be a cool jungle gym to add.
---
“He is too dangerous to be kept alive”
---
yea, but bans for that are automated. You get banned the moment the match ends
---
Thanks so much man!!  We got pics with some Legion cosplayers, The Plague, Huntress, Feng Min, Freddy, and Michael!
---
It makes sense... its the fear of dying or dead people but entity takes the body away
---
r/legoyodaketamine
---
I wonder who’s older , ash or ghost face lol
---
Super cute video
---
Plague has the worst emblems in the entire game. Survivors control her emblems by not chasing, which is complete bs. 
---
But if you use your ability well as Trapper, Billy, Leatherface or Ghostface you get punished as well\~
---
Plague cosplay? Man that must of had some work put into it
---
Trap boy definitely needs buffs, but making it so that touching his traps guarantees an injury isn’t very fun and will promote the use of toolboxes that can make traps unusable for an extended amount of time.
---
Assuming this is added and he becomes high-tier, the same sweaty SWF teams that have someone disarm every trap he sets will bring a toolbox user with iron will that can just sneak around while injured and sabo traps the exact same way, at a larger detriment to the killer. Sure he’s injured and trapper can patrol around your traps looking for the saboteur, but gens are gonna be flying and traps will be getting broken the entire time. 
---
I personally don’t know how to make trapper high-tier, aside from the fact that he clearly needs to start with either all or most of his traps. It can be appreciated that you’re trying to propose changes and spark discussion, even if what you’re proposing is controversial.
---
It was absolutely incredible, complete with the lamp!
---
The lamp?
---
I was thinking about that. I am not sure it is needed though. Look at how people play against the Plague. They don’t heal against her and they can still win. An entire Team can be injured and they will just chunk out gens. Here, only 1 or 2 people would be in an injured state.
---
Wtf is „Burro”?
---
This is what happens when you get reported ! 
---
😜
---
No slugging is an issue too? So I should just waste my time picking you up when I know your shithead teammate is just gonna flashlight me with absolutely nothing I can do about it, or spend time taking you to a hook when I can just chase your teammates off a gen nearby because it's almost done.
---
OP said "Survs are surprised that we tunnel them when we go back to the hook and there is scratchmarks."
---
Well, if there wasn't scratchmarks they would have still been at the hook and thus still tunneled, so it's not because they left scratchmarks. He was returning to the hook anyway.
---
Ah. Guess it’s the usual “you can have this software for free. yes zero bucks. we’ll just put an ad at the end of every video you’re ever gonna do in this program. no no it’s free trust us!”
---
You can just say DC, everyones thinking it.
---
Lol you say you admit when you are wrong, but in this case you can t admit you are wrong. You probably have tumor or something. Srsly seek help.
---
I feel like they were fine in EU
---
The idiots that dc think DCing is funny till dedicated servers come and they can track the bitches that dc every game, then provide temporary bans to them.
---
I feel old for watching the show as a kid and can't stop laughing because this is completely accurate and Feng would be Toad.
---
I love it when i see someone running for the unhook from a mile away and then they call me a facecamper for grabbing them.
---
Make bag add-ons base, not bloody coil. It helps mitigate the amount of time he spends prepping in the early game, which is his biggest weakness
---
Thanks! The comments here are so kind you’d think I made like 10 alts
---
I can't track hours but it's a lot lol
---
"Mend" is not a heal and is not affected by heal increases or decreases
---
What?  I love playing immersed. I know many people who do. 
---
That’s the issue here though, like it or not, you just have to play a different style against different killers. That’s the game.  Beads spirit is about stealth, preventing the chase and mindgames...
---
More so mind games if you have iron will (which is good for anyone... any killer I’ve played as I find survivors all the time because I hear their moans)
---
I have to agree with that last statement.
---
New chapter,2 survivors and 2 good perks with 1 meh perk.
---
The killer?
---
Convenience store bamboozle,meh/garbage overcharge ripoff and that last perk that is only slightly usable with Myers.
---
So all perks apart from 3 ended up in the landfill like usual.
---
Like what were they even thinking with camaraderie,it’s just a killer perk disguised as a survivor perk.
---
Love your idea! People would also have to be more coordinated. Also it would stop all the gens from getting done in the first 5 minutes.
---
加油 you can do this!
---
I feel so ashamed. I have like 3k hours, but I'm missing 3 achievements, 2 adept killer achievements (Plague and Demo). The hatch-closing-thing comes after a while, but i absolutely HATE playing these two killers. :'(
---
Indeed such a responsability to take care of these 4 kids
---
You got this brother ✊🏿
---
Flip-Flop is great.
---
His face makes his “Pharmacy” perk have more sense though.
---
Spirit is also absolutely not evil. Leatherface and Pig also killed only for specific reasons.
---
I just played my p3 doc on console yesterday! He actually doesn’t do too bad at red ranks half the time, but even if I don’t do amazing with him, i still love him, so I play him a lot.
---
Just came back after not playing for a year. Wasnt always like this.
---
Right about that
---
It’s been shit trying to find a game as killer or survivor this morning, I’m in the southeast USA and every Sunday morning for some reason this game goes to complete shit on trying to find any lobbies. It’s something with BhVR and their shitty game, wish those noobs would fix it already! PS4, wired 100mb connection. Survivor lobbies last night were 10-15mins and killer lobbies were instant but like normal every Sunday morning it all goes to shit until around 12pm est....
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Yes he has one add-on that makes is tier 3 infinite but it increases the amount of stalk required tremendously. Same goes for his other item, which doesn't make his EW III infinite but makes him able to instantly kill healthy and injured survivors.
---
I haven't played it docked yet, but in handheld mode, the game runs great as survivor. As killer though, the performance varies on the different maps. On some maps it's good while on others there can be noticable fps drops.
---
I love this so much lmfao im dying
---
I ripped your butthole sorry
---
Trapper should shit out traps in the same vein as Freddy's blood pools. The biggest counter to Trapper is survivors watching him place them. If the Trapper could spawn them without telegraphing the placement the traps would be much more effective.
---
Survivor or killer?
---
I like to use inner strength, you either get hit with ds or watch me heal
---
Its funny how salty yall get lol. A killer main cant even joke with survivors without a ton of hate. Imma rank 3 survivor an know yall pain. I don't tunnel but I will chase you down an smack you back to slug land after stabbing me.
---
This is the content I like to see and also why I love playing this game

I got it! A while ago but I forgot I posted.

They are quite important for me but not as important is worth a perk slot.
---
However it counter one of the best perks in the game - Infectious Fright.
---
I wanna see the survivor PoV
---
least scary: honestly, the trapper. i don't really get scared because of him, since he's a mediocre killer (imo)  
---
most scary: the goodest boi demogorgon. seeing him coming behind you really makes you jump.  
---
most annoying: the hag, i feel like it's self-explanatory why i think she's annoying.  
---
most fun: myers for me too, i still laugh when i see him just standing there, stalking me.
---
That makes me sad, you all can petted the horse but papa ghost face can't. At least he can be proud of how he raised his children
---
Feng looking like a snack
---
I’ll also share my personal survivor build, which I find to be an extremely good anti tunnel build. 
---
1) DS. The best anti tunnel perk in the game 
---
2) Second wind. This perk has mad synergy with ds. After being unhooked with second wind, jump into a locker. When the killer opens the locker, use DS, and then afterward, second wind will activate, making you full hp.
---
3) Well make it. Makes second wind more consistent. That’s all. 
---
4) Head on or dead hard 
---
Head on has more synergy with the build 
---
Dead hard is overall a better perk. 
---
I go which one i feel like.
---
Is he in transition from Gollum to Sméagol?
---
Drugs
---
just add the deep wounds timer to all survs to tilt more people
---
Yup!
---
I second this, but also I wouldn’t mind if they both had one!
---
The incense lamp she carries around and smacks you with!
---
Oh that lol I've never called it a lamp i just thoght of it as a candle holder
---
Rank 16 killer here I got matched with a purple ranks SWF.
---
Legion trailer please,  and bhvr said they're never doing it...
---
Personally I use shards for bloodpoints (save some for when new characters release so you can rank them up fast).
---
I enjoy supporting the devs by purchasing characters and cosmetics with real money.  I'd like to see this game supported for years to come.
---
With that being said, if money is tight then I'd use your shards on a killer.
---
I only played against one Leatherface and he was amazing.
---
He played like a trapper without traps and never stood infront of a hook for more than 5 seconds.
---
Of course someone called him a facecampee but that’s just the standard reaction towards any bubba player now
---
Haha wrecked
---
Another idea which will make red ranks trials unplayable for survivors
---
His face still isn’t that great. At least they got the voice actor though.
---
I mean you're salty about this and you got away, so I believe it
---
I could be wrong in calling it a lamp tbh hahahaha
---
Hook someone. Place all 10 traps around them. Rinse and repeat. 
---
That is what will happen if he gets 5 or 6 traps at one time. 
---
Time wasted disarming is time not in a gen. It works better as not every killer will be trapper
---
Depends on how much teachables you have. If you have like 20 it takes a while - I had breakdown but it took 40 levels to get there
---
Oh  ok thx
---
I have played with several swf groups and in no way do I keep asking, "hey is this you" every time I see them and even then if this power would be implemented there would be no terror radius and even if you did ask that question it would probably be too late.
---
Meg had some big balls and played it perfectly post-unhook, but Legion playing sloppy was the only reason it worked at all. Should've been no chance of Meg getting the unhook without going down herself.
---
Paid off though.
---
Fuck it give him a 45 caliber too just in case
---
i signed up for 3 college campus trips at my cc, i hope they make me feel more at ease about transferring
---
Are you chasing them or using the mirror for what it’s meant for?
---
Not every killer needs to be S tier, trapper only needs a minor buff, and being able to transport multiple traps as base trapper is a substantial buff
---
No he doesn't use 4 puffs of fair faucet spray
---
Getting grabbed automatically puts you into the downed state.  Likely what's causing that.
---
Really? Thats so stupid! It also doesnt show the deep wound status effect draining as a survivor so maybe thats a Visual bug? Thanks for informing me however!
---
I think really is wayyyyyy too easy to Pip. Especially as Survivor. I'm in the red ranks constantly getting matched with people way better than me, but I'm not going to depip intentionally.
---
25% increase action when someone dies is op. devs can you nerf this perk that isnt accesible unless you hack please.
---
I think you misunderstood. What I'm saying is that after healing one full health state, but before being put on the hook, getting grabbed will remove Second Wind.
---
I don’t understand why so many are like this. I was playing against one recently and used deliverance to get off the hook and he just straight up dc’d.
---
Those last teabags were him trying to play it off. Dude was mad hurt
---
If teammates just stopped letting themselves get pushed out then this wouldn't be such a rare situation. Good on Mxvell tho
---
That’s what I thought, like I’ll see streamers at rank 2/1 who are way better than me but we’re the same rank - I mean as long as you do a gen, get a rescue and heal plus a chase, you’ll pip
---
Not when they just accuse you, when they say something like "SWF is broken af" then leave instantly so you can't even say anything in response
---
Why would you want to rank up?
---
Give the killer emotes!!
---
Second wind has a lot of strange limitations, especially when compared to inner strength. I guess it’s because having someone Instaheal when you’re trying to chase them because of a perk is pretty annoying, but 15-30 seconds after being unhooked tends to be a result of tunneling or survivor incompetence. Compared to inner strength, a perk that activates when you cleanse a dull totem, has no time limit and doesn’t deactivate unless you either heal or die, second wind is terrible. Activates only upon healing someone else (an action that can’t be completed until later in the game, whereas you can cleanse a dull totem sometimes the moment you spawn), deactivates if the player is downed before it can be triggered, and doesn’t work with perks you’d think it has natural synergy with i.e. deliverance. Personally, I’d be fine with it if you could at least use it successfully along with perks like deliverance.
---
Well, your connection is therefore "worse".  Read the parentheticals as and/or statements instead of just and.
---
why do people keep making memes like this when thantaphobia does make sense? thanaphobia is the fear of dying. when you are injured, downed, hooked. you are obviously scared because you are closer to death. but it doesnt have anything to do with actually being dead. how should you fear death when you are dead?
---
Its good, you get a lot of content and it runs well in handheld. Docked mode is about the same as console
---
Default button is spacebar I'm pretty sure
---
Thank you so much
---
That's all well and good, but what I'm saying is that after healing one full health state, but before being put on the hook, getting grabbed will remove Second Wind, which seems more like a glitch than anything else.
---
Its not ok for a Nurse to run Omega blink but its A-Ok to Run Insta heals and Keys, Survivor logic...
---
Because people can't intentionally drank to 20 any more.  Wait til the next free weekend and then jump back in to catch up if you want to skip queues.
---
I hope

---
You technically enter the dying state upon being grabbed, out of a locker or from anything else, and so it's just part of Second Wind's usual limitation.
---
SW used to actually not deactivate in this scenario, but that was fixed recently. It was possible to be abused with Decisive Strike, where you would be able to jump into a locker to be able to DS and still get SW's heal.
---
Edit: Ah, I see what you mean. Well, that really must be a bug introduced by the recent fix.
---
I feel like dbd engine isn't made to make good faces
---
“Its a stone, Adam. You didn’t make it!”
---
“It’s a pebble! I chiseled it”
---
Because killers can't enjoy the game - but when survivors bring 4 instaheals nobody gives a shit
---
Old meme
---
I'm against legion buffs simply because I don't want to play against him more. Mending over and over and having teammates self-caring in a corner of the map is not fun. Plus, baiting legion into a miss during his power is pretty much the only counterplay to it, other than not being in range to begin with.
---
That said, the killer definitely could use a rework.
---
y'all lucky
---
I think a better solution is to suspend BP earnings. Obviously they miss the points from that game but I think it should prevent gaining BP for the next 2 games. Sad if someone dc's because of an emergency etc but I would rather that than no punishment
---
So, you're saying that it's intentional to lose your Second Wind before the timer has even started? If so, bloody hell, that's ridiculous.
---
This image gives me anxiety
---
Wow you’re really good
---
It looks like a thing out of a movie
---
That would be why it's called "cheating"
---
I got those exclusives and then when I logged on yesterday I checked David and It removed his jacket from my cosmetics, same with the huntress mask
---
But shitty perks I miss the old MoM that poor perk, it was op but now is useless same story as legion
---
so you plan on a 3 gen when the game starts? not saying it can't work, it usually does especially when killer doesn't run ruin and gens go by too fast, but it's just boring dragging games out with impossible to do gens, especially when survivors decide to loot chests and get lucky enough to get a key
---
Why shouldn’t every killer be very strong. Wouldn’t that allow better balancing? 
---
Too many traps on hand is worse than bloody coil. You can spam traps around a hook. 5 is enough to nearly Stop all unhooks that are in gyms or ensure that the unhooked person or unhookee does not get away.
---
But a movespeed drawback
---
Honestly sounds like way too much. I think survivors should just have to go to shrine thingies scattered around the map to get the power to repair gens, and maybe have survivors automatically receive it if they get hooked or unhook someone.
---
I'd suggest wraith. Hes easy to play and has a lot of tracking perks that can help you learn what to look for when searching for survivors.
---
You must be new to online games if you expect that.
---
I would actually recommend Myers or Demo, Myers has a really fun power once you understand it. The Demogorgon can end chases faster with shred, and puts map pressure on the survivors with the portals.
---
why would you censor their name?
---
I do this with hag and trapper, because I usually only play them for dailies. So I just drop traps in nonsensical places.  It's legit hilarious when you get dudes playing under their rank because they expect traps to be in logical places and wind up getting snapped next to a tree in a random corner of the map with nothing around.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the suggestion!
---
the Depip squad used no perks, no items and no comms and still managed to dumpster the world's best killer players over and over again regardless of the killer and perk build.
---
I was P3 Dwight, the other 2 were Nancy and Meg in Ormond against a Spirit. Any of that ringing a bell?
---
So I like the legion a lot. I'd reccomended looking at this channel.
---
They have vids on each killer and go over their different strengths vs weaknesses. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSCEP1vkux09RE1BpIPwBKM18Q9Ed1RJ5
---
1 more trap is not enough to do anything significant. 
---
It does not slow down how fast traps are disarmed, it doesn’t penalize disarming as the trapper is not fast enough to get to a survivor after a disarming notification. (It is hard enough getting to a trapped person before they escape). 
---
1 more trap doesn’t help at higher or even mid tiers
---
I found the b*tch
---
I was most likely the Nancy since that’s who I was playing all of yesterday
---
Wraiths are always the friendliest idk why
---
Then trapper needs a bowser cosmetic.
---
Thats just a guy trying to play with friends,that is completely fine and I never leave.
---
So you’re saying that I’m not a decent human being by not letting some absolute lobotomite blink into my face without using any skill at all?
---
Your argument here is just “Its in the game,so it’s fair”.
---
If I don’t want to waste my time with some blink spammer I don’t.
---
But like most of meme culture. It's not nor has it ever been funny
---
I do when I’m killer don’t act like I don’t play both sides
---
If you're going to pick a DLC killer I'd say your first one should be one that has a playstyle you're drawn towards. You'll get way more value out of it.
---
Yeah it doesnt work but thats cause its designed around m1 killers.
---
oh shiiiiit, i didn't know that!
---
If you were Nancy then you were the one who flamed me :D
---
It's an offering that doubles the blood points given within a match (Bloody Party Streamers) you'll see them when you progress through either a survivor or killer blood web
---
Took me a while before I even saw it
---
Well then I probably wasn’t the one in your game lol, I just remember someone using that build
---
The inexperience thing is important.  He has a similar issue as Billy and nurse when being played by newer killers, they just don't have the control and presence to use fast/unsteerable attacks well.
---
what can i say its a shitty game but the lore is just honestly pretty good vengful children souls seeking revenge after posseing the closest thing to them a children entertatiment robot and hunting the night guard because they think he is the one he killed them? its a good pass for a killer and survivor lore no?
---
ok as a wraith main lemme just say, you meme when you play wraith, if you're tryharding you gotta expect losses and not let it get to you. Bing bong through the pain. Which of course is why i'm a firm believer in devour hope on wraith. When it works it *r e a l l y* works.
---
I was so confused when i walked by
---
Np
---
Ah i see. I dont recall seeing them and i have a level 50 pig, and level 27 wraith. Are they super super rare?
---
A: what you’ve just described is face camping with extra steps.
---
B: High A-low B tier is the range killers should be at imo. Powerful and viable, but not broken. I think the absolute strongest a killer should be is current Spirit. That’s the level of power BHVR should aim for when tweaking killers. Making bags base kit would put trapper roughly around Mid to High B I’d say, which is a fine place for him, making Bloody Coil base kit is seriously toeing the line, it’s ultra rare for a reason
---
Why are you looting while ghostface exposed you
---
They aren't super rare, just uncommon. It's a green offering that looks like streamers
---
I can imagine. How did he or she even do that?! I need to know so I can do it too 🤣
---
At that point it’s pretty much just camping. Hag can also place 10 traps around a hook but that takes significantly more time than it’s worth. Should hag not start with all of her runes to prevent this? No, of course not, because placing every single trap around one hooked survivor is inefficient, ineffective, and time-wasting. Besides that, placing all of your traps around someone you hook means putting down little to no traps at the start of the match, when it’s by far the most important to be placing them. A trap would need to be disarmed before unhooking, yes, but the amount of time between a disarm alert, the unhook, and running out of the trap circle isn’t long enough for trapper to guarantee anything unless he’s straight up proxy camping. Even on the off chance he got a built-in bloody coil, injuring one survivor when they go to unhook, it still would not warrant giving up all of your map pressure and chase-ending ability to injure a single person going for a single unhook. If a killer wants to injure people going for the unhook so badly that’d they’d waste all 10 of their traps on it, that player might as well use MYC Hag. 
---
Assuming trapper is high-tier with this, and even a built in UR addon won’t make him come close to spirit, nurse, or even an optimal Freddy, but just assuming he would be played more at red-ranks, it really isn’t that costly to run iron will with a yellow toolbox. Toolboxes are useful and iron will already counters the two best characters in the game, if you’re gonna run a keys or anti-hemo syringes why not IW+Toolbox to shut down trapper? And, if you want traps to slow the game down, why not just use Freddy, whose addons give you some of the best slowdown in the game for no additional effort or wasted time?
---
Because bloody coil is so OP?
---
That is like saying the Plague is OP because people don’t heal and stay injured. 
---
BC would add another layer to playing as and against trapper. You get additional slowdown as trapper due to disarming, sabotaging, and healing. As survivor, you actually have to change play styles. Disarming a trap near the killer is no longer safe. You need to play smarter.
---
What a salty b*tch
---
We just discussed about that, thought Clown would fit best :3
---
And without lube, apparently
---
Hm, ill try to see if i have them. Thanks for the help.
---
No problem
---
Didn’t know this existed lmao ideas are 10/10
---
He was hooked and his body was like 20 feet in the air but I could still save. I guess he landed on the hook
---
Only explanation is that devs only watched season 1 of stranger things and decided to shaft Steve when it came to perks
---
^^/s
---
Iron Will and Urban Evasion are perfect in Coldwind farm
---
yeah i think the ones when markus got thrown in the solid waste landfill are pretty scary but you know none of them even killed and all of em are pretty innocent
---
Is it confirmed we won’t be getting an IT chapter??
---
Alright.
---
that's called legion's ability and that's why he's the worst killer in the game
---
some more context? Sounds like Borrowed Time
---
Yes this is legions power
---
So Legion's attacks don't actually down survivors if frenzied?
---
Leave laurie alone!
---
A sheild over their health bar?
---
Also frenzy was "reworked" you get one stab, and you have to make it count or you have to recharge your power all over again.
---
I don't get it
---
I disagree. 
---
A) yes. Trapper could “face camp” from across the map due to being able to place layers of traps. 
---
B) Nearly every trapper already runs bags. It doesn’t help that much. It isn’t enough.
---
Yes, you're right.  I had the time line messed up in my head.  Sounds like a bug, for sure, and a fairly ugly one.  Suppose it could be intentional for some reason, but seems unlikely.
---
its never meant to be used on all killers tho its more for bubba and plauge hell even trapper and hag can make a smart use of it
---
I didn't think about that. Guess trapper can be donkey kong
---
This is fire. Props to the artist
---
Nope. You'll have to leave frenzy to down survivors.
---
it applies an effect called "deep wound" (not a shield) and therefore will not down a survivor. If they dont mend and that timer runs out (which almost never happens), then they will go into the dying state.
---
YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE
---
They want to it's just a matter of whether the license will let them.
---
Wraith and trappers moris are worse animated then others but they do the job fine. I'm sure at one point they make additional moris as things to buy which will give them different moris.
---
Well done
---
What I am talking about is, I will be in Frenzy and get two hits in the same Frenzy but they will boost away at lightning speed and their health bar at the bottom under their name gets a yellow film over it. When I hit them after that, I get points but they do not go down.
---
Don't get what? Hitting someone when I frenzy gives them an effect called deep wound where of they don't mebd within time (the timer only goes down whne they're out of your terror radius) they get downed but you can't down them in frenzy. This is why Legion is so bad because mending is so easy to do
---
If you can dodge two you can dodge two again
---
Thank you for explaining
---
Who knows? 🤔
---
of course and if you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer them
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
Yeah it definitely won't work every time but it's not like you have a lot of options and people often don't think about the grab animation.
---
Here is the creature the kids named the monster after from DnD
---
 [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demogorgon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demogorgon)
---
*Laughs in Trapper main*
---
Shroud of separation would like to have a word with you
---
Yeah but you don't need to put another addon to increase how many traps he can carry. Without the problem of having to put a bag addon, you can put something else instead.
---
Maybe buffing some of his stats wouldn't be a bad idea, but I personally think that letting him carry more traps without addons is a good idea.
---
Wow... I spent 1600 Auric Cells on cosmetics for Legion because I thought it would be great
---
I appreciate that very much, thank you :)
---
Hag gets like a quarter-second screen freeze every time you put down a trap now. It doesn't sound too bad but it's disorienting when placing traps and trying to turn after.
---
Yea! The Frenzy gives them the "Deep Wound" status effect. You wanna apply damage evenly to every survivor so if you play legion well you should hit one then look around for the others and it them. 1 hit per survivor.
---
Hoping it will come in the shop soon cause I'm broke
---
Dont talk about your mother and grandmother  like that
---
A: If he’s not close enough to capitalize on the traps, they’re wasted anyways, meaning he’d have to proxy camp, sacrificing map pressure
---
B: Everyone runs bags because he’s severely neutered without them. Making them base opens up an add-on slot that is usually reserved exclusively for the obligatory bag.
---
Your first hit while frenzied applies deep wounds to the survivor. You can tag all 4 survivors but you cannot down them while you’re in feral frenzy. If you ARENT frenzied and you hit them they will go down if they are injured.
---
a BPS is an offering you can burn that doubles the amount of bloodpoints earned in a match for everyone, and it will stack with each one played so up to 200%,300%,400%,500%,600% depending on how many players burn one
---
Dont tunnel
---
Legion's power never could down survivors by itself.
---
I'm sure eventually his model is gonna get reworked. I just hope that he still looks dead and tired after they are done.
---
They also thought instant fast vaults, 80% speed self care, we’ll make it + self care and double pallets at every loop was fair.
---
Old, scrapped version of Left Behind
---
If you can dodge a Blink you can dodge a Ball
---
The size for my phone screen is 1125 x 2436, and thanks for reaching out.
---
I'd say Doc goes up a tier as well for his console skill checks. At rank 1 I constantly see failed checks.
---
Killers can burn it too, right?
---
I just count to a hundred if a guy is hounding me after getting off the hook letting me know he's trying to stab me because I count to fast to try to count to 60 LOL
---
you could do them when the rank resets, usually makes things easier  
---
also, I actually grew to like demogorgon because I forced myself to play him for the achievement, needless to say it took a while lmao  
---
you're so close, go get 'em!
---
If you can dodge a blink you can dodge a lobby
---
But B*tch isn’t plural
---
Yeah that works I gues
---
You can't down survivors with the power, you need to down them as usual, I think they go down eventually if they don't patch themselves? Don't quote me on it, I don't play legion
---
Another vote for Wraith! He also recently got some bad ass cosmetics lol so if you want to look good and learn the game, go for bingbong boi.
---
Both sound really fun, thanks for the suggestion!
---
Such a shame.. What a weird way to work it
---
This is my first time playing as Legion
---
Wow thanks for the link. I’ll definitely check it out!
---
And that's always better than getting slugged
---
yessir it just depends on finding it in the bloodweb
---
Eventually you reach a certain point in life where you gotta decide how badly you want something and what kind of risk you’re willing to take to get it.
---
No seriously?! I legitimately thought this was professionally made. :0
---
Plat on Bloodborne?? I see your a man of
---
Culture as well
---
Thank you!!
---
You're fine! It's all about learning. I hope you have better matches in the future! Good luck in the fog.
---
:D nice
---
Spirit Mindgames = Standing still, that's not skill, that's just a chance game which is unfun to go against
---
Bruh you gotta grind up to get the tier 4
---
It lasts up to an hour
---
And yet it applies to both of them
---
I'd watch it
---
Gold!
---
This makes you unslugable, as the killer has no option to just rip you out of it and leave you on the floor
---
I was looting a chest and spirit ran up and hit me, I immediately went back to looting the chest with her right there and she let me get my item before downing and hooking me.
---
mindflayers are from DnD and originate there as well I believe. They are creatures that live deep below the surface and have octopus shaped heads. They are normally called Illithids, but are often referred to as mindflayers because they manipulate people's minds with magic then eat eat their brains.
---
First perk is a Claudette's worst nightmare
---
Hag is slow. Triggering her traps don’t even guarantee a hit, much less a down like trappers. You can bait and trigger Hag traps without tripping them, even around corners safely. You can also crouch and completely negate them. If multiple Hag traps go off at once, Hag can not control which one she goes to, unlike trapper where it does not matter. If she placed a bunch of traps near a hook, 1 person can easily disarm all her traps by running through them, taking a hit, then escaping with Dead hard and the hit animation. That completely stops that tactic from the Hag. Hag is completely different. 
---
BC allows for higher map pressure and slowdown. That is a fact. That is something needed for higher tier killers. It may not make him S Tier, but it would put him in rotation at higher levels, which adds variety. By your own admission, if it does not make him even at Freddy level with BC, what is the problem? You are admitting that BC would not be OP on him and at best would make him high mid tier. That is a good thing.
---
In your opinion. Plenty of people, myself included, do find it funny. If they didn't, it wouldn't be popular.
---
that's for what I bought this game for!
---
No, they have expressed interest in trying again, but judging by the fact that they shut fortnite down, it's not likely. The reasoning being that a fortnite event would have made them at least a few thousand, they must really have to like dbd, because a dbd chapter would make alot less money than thousands of children with their parent's visa. (But money is not everything, it is still very possible.)
---
.. who hurt you?
---
Punishing people for DC is in any online pvp game with a soft ban starting from 5min and for every consecutive DC you have to wait longer
---
Are you ok?
---
I disagree, skillchecks on console really aren’t hard, I don’t know why they get that reputation, back when I first started playing after like a week I was hitting great skill checks 9/10 times
---
It would be better than playing against Legion or Plague, and people still do fine against them. 
---
It would not be unfun, it would just add more tension. You would not be healing all the time, you would just need to make assessments of when to heal, when to leave a trap, and when to just do gens.
---
So about 25FPS on average, it seems.
---
I butt dance for the butt rubs.
---
Otz doesn't camp AT ALL. He slugs a lot, but with the intention of coming back. That's just prioritization.
---
Who do you play as killer most of I can ask? 
---
I gotta agree here and say Leatherface is definitely worth leveling for BBQ. The BP bonus is huge and it’s a meta perk even on its own. LF can get bullied pretty hard depending on the ranks and map so I recommend playing whoever you like and just using the BP to level him. 
---
Other than that, I would definitely level Hag as well.
---
No, DC because you can't take a loss
---
Like in every online pvp game. Take any, it would punish you with a soft ban of few minutes and you'll be forced to wait more and more if you keep dcing.
---
It's not hard to understand, but I guess you people love to abuse this system if you're butthurt when losing
---
You place them in front of you. Ideally you want to place them under windows and loops you think the survivors will try to take advantage of.
---
it's a green offering that looks like some bacon strips and doubles the bloodpoints every player gets in that game.
---
hmmm
---
I know this isn't the answer you're probably looking for, but if you don't want to wait till the next Steam sale, CD Keys had DBD for pretty cheap. My friend got it on there the other day for £5.59 for the same reason.

Unrealistic. You're never getting to the phase where they admit it's not okay to win every game.
---
Oh I agree with that!!!
---
One of my favourite things to do is to jump in a locker without even having DS (Only where I would go down otherwise)
---
BIG BRAIN MINDGAMES
---
For real damn that’s cool
---
A: he absolutely cannot traverse the map in the time it takes to disarm a trap or two and unhook
---
B: quick and easy doesn’t equal good. Trapper currently resides in high-C tier. Most regard him as the baseline for an average killer, taking bloody cool and making it base shoots him way up that list. His power becomes a lose-lose for the survivors. Either disarm and waste precious time healing while alerting the killer to your position, or leave the trap and risk it fucking you over later. It’s like plague with extra steps, except it’s ok for plague because if survivors choose not to cleanse, she still has to work through chases to capitalize on the survivors being broken. She can still be looped, there’s counter play. Bloody coil trapper doesn’t have that. You’ve not only got survivors that are likely gonna be injured more often than not, you’ve got a power that hard stops loops, with no safe way to work around. All of that bullshittery is well and good for an ultra rare add-on, not for a base kit buff
---
Yeah dude definitely camps/tunnels when it's the right play. It's the only way to win at high ranks though. And it takes a certain amount of skill/knowledge to know when is the correct time to slug/camp/tunnel/etc. which lower rank players do not have.
---
Yeah, Switch doesn’t support DbD’s P2P system
---
Lol never seen a white knight for men
---
Dude. Stop doing drugs.. I don't know you and have no idea what are you talking about, get help
---
Why do you think there are so many Spirits and Nurses? Take an honest guess. I think there's a valid reason.
---
Dc
---
How is that abusable? All it would do is show how many people rate the match they had with them as a good, fun match.
---
nobody tells me nothing
---
I just love this game y'all :) Excited to play some Hag games today!
---
Also he has this addon which allows you to creat fake pallets. Combine that with the blue dress. And you habe something I call The Whilesome Freddy build. (perks I usually run. BBQ. infectious Fright. Ruin. Lastone is your choice)
---
Dude, I'm on your side. I can't watch you keep dying out here. It's embarrassing.
---
Hawkins
---
Crazy how biased a community is someone can come on a post blatantly disrespect a person then get defended cuz yall dont like a play style. Clowns all in this community
---
That’s rough, I play on an original PS4, never had something like that
---
Thank you for your positivity
---
Its not at all, a 5 blink nurse will still lose to a well coordinated SWF taking powerful items in and Moris are a non factor, they aren't used in matches that often and if they are then its the survivors fault for going down twice
---
That's...not the issue. Good luck figuring things out.
---
Yes one day
---
God damnit now im gonna get hungry every time I see them

Power and perks NOWWWW

*screen does that little shaky thing*
---
Incredibly well made. Just so random lmao.
---
The longest I've had to wait was 10 minutes, but that was only once. Other than that, it usually takes around 3 to 5 minutes to find a match.
---
There’s also the Friday the 13th game, but I don’t think that one is as popular lol
---
You act like the major of killer mains here would call this toxic which is completely untrue. This sub does not favor killers any more than is fair.
---
Thats hot... thats hot
---
By 1.10 i assume you mean 110% of Survivor movement speed? Also known as 4.4m/s.
---
Did you order the trapper mask?
---
It's something you never give to others, especially when people ask for it.
---
What? I love how people read till some point and stop and misunderstand everything, I said that since there's a lot of Spirit and nurses, people call every bad player shit, idk what your statemant have to do with what I said
---
Nice account you made ;)
---
I'd honestly try playing on lower graphics settings. Sounds counterintuitive, but for me at least, it helps with things like the cornfield.
---
Killer lobby isnt broken its just the fact that there are lots more killers that survivors at the moment. Beings not as many people play switch as they do on console or pc. Itll take awhile to get a match playing as killer when everyone is playing killer. Id say play survivor for a good 2 weeks til switch players figure out if they main killer or survivor and in the mean time save your bloodpoints. And spend them to level up the killer you like :) when 2 weeks pass. Youll be ready to slay!
---
Oh
---
Her incense burner looks awesome

This is so cute, i love it

you probably also t-bagged him and didnt show that part lol

Ordered a hoodie in the first week of the shop.

Arrived within a week

Those are some hot plays! Great job!
---
No way to tell on ps4.
---
Hehe thank you so much :D
---
Doc gives everyone a migraine, take off his zapping sound and maybe we can talk
---
Hahahaha they're quite old tho, I don't think they'll keep going much longer :'( Need to get a new pair
---
The gang's all here!
---
haha
---
I’m not saying a majority of killer mains would call this toxic, just saying the majority of people on the sub are killer mains, and I’ve seen a lot of bias (on both sides to be fair).
---
All me ;) hehe
---
I didn't know survivors actually have different heights, that's kinda cool. I noticed it when you and Nea were at the board with holes for your faces in it.
---
I bring Selfcare not to full heal myself from scratch (unless we are in a situation where we are pressuring a 3 gen killer who isn't going outside of those gens area) but to ensure I can heal myself from a partial heal that got interrupted.  I also always pair it up with either a medkit set to have 1-2 full heal states.  Also add in Botany Knowledge often enough (12 second normal heal, 24 second full heal).
---
It's janked. Jason is horribly OP because they balanced him to face sweaty teams, and the voice chat makes it more like a weird version of VRchat than anything competitive in contrast to that. Plus, the lawsuit prevents any more content from being made for it.
---
I'd still play it if you could CHOOSE to be Jason, though.
---
Deal. Sound rework for sniper shot.
---
The min. is 8 pallets in any map except reworked Badham and Hawkins. Any map except those two have a pallet at least 16m away from one another. The exceptions have a pallet at 8m from one another but the majority (especially in Hawkins) are unsafe and you can just avoid them. 
---
It's hard to tell which one has more pallets because it also depends of how many tiles a map has but players criticize mostly Thompson House and Blood Lodge because of the amount of safe pallets there are.
---
The amount of open spaces makes it pretty hard to even get a hit on them, even harder to down them when they got so many pallets to run to
---
If you really are defending  me thanks.but also you dont have to man, I feel embarrassment in the real world. In the gaming community  I just try to enjoy my time
---
They get two headshakes.  If they keep wiggling, they get a hook.
---
Try not to let the pressure get to you. Remember, it's not about killing everyone every time. As for survivor: if you're on PC, I'd recommend lvling up Bill first. He's got perks that will give you a strong start once you move on to leveling other survivors as well.
---
Thanks so much! Aye it was a quite professional studio. Not top notch, but they know what they're doing for sure. Actually, there is one person I know working with them, and she is a fan of dbd as well, so she was hyped to see me haha. All the others were just staring like "this is fine." :')
---
it's literally a you vs them game, if you don't want to have to get competitive and sweat to win go play something else
---
Lmao I know right, I had 100% across all DLCs (ps4) until Ghostface came out. I did adept Ghostface and Bill and then couldn’t be arsed to get the other trophies for them. Now I can’t play for 5 months so I’m missing Stranger Things and the next chapter as well. I’ll get the 100% back one day lol

Please Note: I've seen this meme done before but not using this format. I forgot the user that made the original meme's username.
---
There's a better version of Quinten?
---
hey paisanos
---
Edit: what would king koopa be. Trapper? my money would be on trapper
---
Actually Self-care was nerfed into the ground.
---
Original SC healed at 80% speed and doubled the charges of a medkit.
---
1.0.2 SC healed at 50% speed and *STILL* doubled medkit charges.
---
1.7.0 is when we got the Self-care we have now. Healing at 50% speed with 20% medkit charge efficiency. This was the same patch that healing was increased from 12 to 16 seconds and Self-care was increased from 24 to 32 seconds.
---
*Self-care was never nerfed.* Man you missed out on the early days of DBD. Nearly impossible to die as a survivor.
---
THAT'S ADORABLE!
---
Why is it obvious higher ranks would think this isn't a good setup?
---
Am red rank and confus
---
They have self care so it isn’t the best build
---
You’re both toxic lmfao
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Console peasants have enough self-awareness to know where they stand in the hierarchy of gaming. And if they don’t the Master Race will remind them.
---
Not yet, the other character is Steve from stranger things. But supposedly they are reworking Quinten’s face in the near future!
---
That was fucking slick
---
If Trapper traps a lot of good loops and vaults, you have no choice but to disarm some. Now you’re left injured because otherwise that spot would be useless. So again, either you spend the whole game healing, or you’re on one hit. 
---
The add on is strong, there’s a reason it’s pink. Making it in his base kit is not the solution. It would very much be unfun. People do fine against Legion, and he is unfun too. That’s like the biggest complaint about the character, you spend the whole game mending or healing and it’s boring. I don’t want to spend the whole game healing because I disarmed a trap, which is proper counter play. I don’t know the solution to make Trapper stronger, but Bloody Coil is not it.
---
Same
---
The builds are in the game for a reason. Not every game is going to be fair and it's intended to be like that.
---
I know I do 🤙😳
---
(Those were ironic emoji please dont kill me)
---
*gets onehooked*
---
play better
---
Which nightmare in elm street movie is this one? I havent seen it
---
If they played well then I'll try to give them the hatch if they wiggle off then I'm throwing them on the hook. Only time I dont is when they run a toolbox cause if you want out faster then fine I'll run a mori
---
Not yet, the other character is Steve from stranger things. Supposedly they are reworking Quinten’s face in the near future!
---
The Grim Reaper is not an evil being. It is morally ambiguous. The Reaper does not care if you are Malala Yousafzai or Jeff Bezos, your time will come, and it will be there as a guiding hand. Having it as a killer is not an idea I'm on board with.

I've seen some pretty cool spine chill plays
---
Gameplay wise it makes sense. Killing a survivor is a permanent slow down already, I don't think you need another slow down on top of that.
---
This subbreddit's rules requires it.
---
What the fuck do you mean by fortnite? You want to see people playing with tomato heads in a horror game?
---
That's the idea with clone following you... he comes for you.
---
Also, there are Killers that aren't evil, just a pact with thr Entity. Know your facts though...
---
It is done
---
Wow, what a bunch of garbage people making fun of survivors, like playing a survivor isn't hard enough without idiots thinking its funny when survivors can't win. You all are a bunch of emo children trying to take out your anger about how useless you are in real life. Grow up scum.
---
if only console had these achievements...
---
A: No, I said multiple traps won’t make this unstoppable hook defense you keep trying to insist would work. Intelligent trap placement, on the other hand, is what makes trapper viable at higher ranks. Making bags base decreases his downtime in the early game, as well as freeing up an add-on slot, and perhaps a perk slot as well (many see corrupt as a must on trapper to mitigate early game loss) 
---
B: The 25% chance sounds incredibly more reasonable than making BC base, but it would also make his power reliant on chance. It’s a buff that would only work 1 out of every 4 disarms on average, hardly enough to even justify being a mechanic. Overall bag would be more efficient than this by a long shot, although it would provide the opportunity to add a new add-on lone that gradually increase the odds, up to BC being a 100% chance
---
When they inevitably add the dc punishments then we will talk fuckboi, now go be pathetic somewhere else
---
owners of characters are usually pretty worried about making sure their character remains true and thematic. maybe they don't want their character in a cartoony battle Royale, but would be willing to allow him into an asymmetrical horror game. just something to consider.
---
Personally I think bill is identical but his voice actor in DBD is ass
---
Dman they gave ghostface nurses blink
---
Survivors are supposed to go down in two hits, how is it fair to use insta-heal and or ds etc
---
I'd suggest to watch not notzawa to figure out some builds. Also in this sub you can find several guides to master the basics
---
Except that, pick whoever you want. That's not important
---
I’d rather get a punishment than play against some fucking spamlord who doesn’t even have fun himself
---
* Screenshots highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
For u/B1G_Boss
---
First, you need to relax. Second, yes, you are right, some killers are not evil (Wraith and Spirit come to mind). I'm still against it being a killer.
---
You seem to have missed the point I was trying to make with hag; it wasn’t some sort of comparison, I’m saying that the potential to place 10 traps around a hook if he’s given most of them at the start is such a non-issue because of how much it would hamper his ability to succeed using traps. By the fact that you didn’t disagree or attempt to offer a counterpoint there, I assume we can agree on that.
---
Traps do not slow down the game. They don’t slow the game down enough now, and they won’t slow the game down enough to be effective if a healthy survivor gets injured for disarming them. What do you mean by higher levels, anyway? Red ranks? Purple ranks? You should probably clarify that sooner or later, since I had been assuming you thought BC would make him viable at ranks 1-4.
---
Please do not try and assume what I am “admitting”, it is entirely incorrect and is a massive reach. YOU are saying that BC would give him game slowdown and map pressure to put him at a “higher tier”, though you chose not to define “high tier”. Anyone would guess that you mean A tier or higher, like Freddy. I am saying that BC would not give him game slowdown even remotely equivalent to characters with actual well-designed slowdown, e.g. Freddy.
---
Built in BC makes people maybe, possibly get injured disarming a trap, so long as they’re not smart enough to just have an already injured survivor do it, or to sabotage the trap and cancel trapper’s ability until it resets. It is not by any means a fact that he would get enough map pressure or game slowdown to warrant giving him inherent BC, and just saying so will not magically will it into existence. Just because he isn’t A tier with it doesn’t mean it should be added, and nobody is saying that except you, apparently.
---
Pretty much nobody has agreed that this is a good nor necessary change that would put him at high tiers, so I’m assuming you either weren’t clear enough or have adjusted your argument to say you still want it in order to put him at “High mid tier”.
---
Otz is great, cheers mate
---
Nice stolen post
---
Hahahah, this is way better then I expected.
---
The remake?
---
I am relaxed. I wouldn't open a Discussion Thread if I wasn't.
---
The concept of Grim Reaper seems nice. He is the death that takes your soul. We have a clown as a Killer but we won't have the mighty Grim Reaper? Hmm...ok?
---
Wait that's illegal...
---
bruh she's funny  
---
I don't support her de-ranking, but she's funny to watch.
---
I will admit that the first time I faced plague was just recently(console is secluded to like 5 killers for the most part) and I cleansed. Every. Damn. Time. I'm a purple rank which makes it worse.
---
Damn, nice that you resized it for just one dude. Cool edit.
---
I have gotten agreement that a 25% chance is a good change
---
to be honest the perk is pretty useless and hard to activate
---
Too soon... Too soon...
---
thanks 😊
---
Enough enough
---
well if everyone had instaheal syringes like that nancy did, i could see the reason why.
---
😂
---
If you're bringing SC and botany, that only leaves 2 perk slots for productivity, evasion, and information. Inner strength fully heals you in 8 seconds, takes 1 perk slot, and also promotes doing totems which is a good thing for everyone, not everyone should run it obviously.
---
People out here bringing self care still fully heal themselves without a medkit even when killer has sloppy butcher and thanataphobia....
---
Being hurt isn't that big of a deal. Especially if you're running iron will, and when plenty of killers can down you instantly anyway, or even see your aura as you are healing with nurses calling.
---
Your mind🤤🥰
---
Only time I give the hatch is if a survivor AFK'd or DC'd super early on. But if you teabagged me or wiggle you get the hook.
---
I Think i just deleted our Servers.
---
I'm Sorry.
---
what?
---
You said they are ironic, let it be known that we dont take kindly to those “emoticons” in these parts. Let it be known that you are off the hook this time partner but if i see it happen again, i will not take so kindly.
---
I have yet to play against Plague!
---
Steve’s scream is on another level

10/10 would definitely watch
---
Assassins creed in a nutshell
---
I reckon preschool isn’t too bad for them and for stealth killers try hospital.
---
I have no idea what they are! I’m sorry, This song I taught myself how to play, if I get a better camera and piano I will for sure make a video on how to play it!
---
Meg really came through. Kudos.
---
Oh I just listed the most used survivor perks, I think SC is shit
---
Just cause there's a lot of killers doesn't mean there's a killer bias. Ever consider that the majority of killer mains here are actually unbiased?
---
I really hope they do go through with the face rework. the difference is insane.
---
I SEE VOICECOM IN TOP LEFT
---
Yep, it's OP, they just need one dead or escaped survivor to be faster than any killer, so I can't imagine how it's like after 3.
---
All survivors have a base speed of 100 and killers basically all have 115% (except Nurse but fuck her, she teleport) so after just one they're already at 125%... Meaning that the last one has a speed of 175%... Fucking hell...
---
Do you happen to have video footage of this ? I need to see that shit in action.
---
Thank you haha, ones a compass other is just a bracelet
---
Oh my god. Someone needs to tell the person on that gen that the new killer is nearby staring. They're gonna hit tier 3 in no time
---
wait hol' up  
---
feng's toad.  
---
# feng is a fucking toad
---
Nurses addons are getting reworked yeah?
---
Go get it its gonna be yours!!
---
Unfortunately, rank is very intertwined with how Dead by Daylight gets played. Your best bet if you want to have more fun matches is to look for a discord group so you can group up for a Kill Your Friends match. Less tryhards but still not a straight "here, take the win" kind of game either.
---
I've seen quite a few killers (and survivors) do the de-pip on purpose thing, where they go in match and just stand there doing absolutely nothing else. More likely to derank that way and get back to a more comfortable playing level.
---
Sometimes It better to just give up then carry on with pointless arguments. I tried to explain that I didn't accuse the OC (original commenter) of being a killer main but rather assume. I wasn't too sure if he was one or not. If I was sure, then I would've accused him of it by being direct about it as if it was a statement by saying, "you're a killer main!" Or "you must be a killer main."
---
That was this argument was about then he starts changing that he said to "implied" and now he is saying it has previous bias. (Which it probably does since I assumed he was a killer main based on his original comment) But no. This argument which I have to once again repeat myself was about whether I accused the OC of being a Killer main or not.
---
I love how he changes the topic of general argument to avoid defeat. 
---
Oh well. You can't win everytime.
---
See that above I said not all killers are toxic, and that there’s bias on both sides, you’re just not reading. It’s simply inevitable that with a larger population, there’ll be a larger amount of biased players
---
What is it ?
---
damn I’m a bit more generous but it’s annoying when they don’t take the hint
---
Wow, no way!
---
I've read to stop chasing someone if you feel you cannot catch them within 35 second, but of course use your own judgment for your own play style. Some people are very skilled in evasion and will run you around the map while everyone pumps through generators. 
---
One time as Killer, a Meg in a red tracksuit kept running out whenever I'd find a different survivor. I finally decided to chase her since she kept appearing, but LORT did she run me around forever. I finally caught on that it was her plan to keep me distracted lol.
---
Thrilling tremors is kind of like that
---
finally got to Rank 5 on survivor lol
---
Gumba is my favourite Super Mario
---
Dude. Don't argue with this is guy it's pointless.
---
Infrectious
---

---
*ahaaghiaaah*
---
I usually think the head shake is like a "no you're not getting out"
---
Why not just pull them out and hold them for a bit and drop them to where they are vertical? Or is their standing/dying state based on wiggle bar and not time held for manual drops?
---
Bill, Ash and Steve look the best
---
Works other way round as well.
---
It can work nice in the right circumstance buts it’s like.. baby sitter. Very rare it will see it’s use consistently
---
"Yeah this sub really is a killer main circlejerk sometimes"
---
You singled out killers in your OP and said "this sub" instead of saying certain players or something like that. So no, I actually read perfectly fine, you just worded your post poorly. I'm not even a killer main, I play killer/survivor the same way you do.
---
**ACTION** speed, not everything period my guy. Vaulting windows/lockers yes, running is not an action. Unless im misremembering
---
Unfortunately, it's a baby killer, all the survivors just tbagged at the exit gate.
---
Why is there so much hate for legion now? I don't mind going against him since they changed that one exploit with the blades.
---
The art style looks like the Super Mario Bros Super Show!
---
They don't have the rights. Just because the actor said in a tweet that he is ok does not mean they have it. There is a lot of legal stuff needed to be sorted out first. All we know is that Quentin's actor said he'd be okay with it, which would start the process of getting the likeness rights, and that MCote tweeted back at him to say "okay, lets do this", which means they are most likely on their way. But we don't know for sure if they are still in the process of getting it or if they acquired it yet.
---
WHO THE FUCK IS THAT TROLL
---
best thign to do in that situation is to make them use inner strength, then take them out of the locker anyways.
---
They waste inner strength because now they're injured, and no longer have DS. Win win
---
Yeah sorry about that lol
---
yeah, sometimes you get it instantly after doing said action and sometimes multiple minutes after matches. I refresh my achievements like a maniac. it's weird!
---
I singled out killer bias because it’s prevalent on the sub.
---
Just because I don’t like the mentality doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
---
Lmao Feng is the fucking Toad. Great drawing dude.
---
You know, I'll side with you in this one against the comments. A sixty second max time for DS still gives you time to chase the unhooker (or other nearby survivor) down them and hook them, then also go for said unhooked survivor and still get hit by it. I've seen it happen countless times where the killer wasn't even tunneling they were just good enough to get someone else down fast, or perhaps the unhooked person got healed up fast and looked exactly like the other three megs, so the killer got all turned around and DS was used against them.
---
There really isn't a counter, since you can't prove that every survivor has it. If you know you aren't running an obsession perk but there is still an obsession then that tells you a survivor has it, just not which one (because it almost is never the person actually labeled as obsession). Best bet is to just slug everyone and let them all bleed out on the floor, at least then you'll be able to enjoy a margarita with all that post game salt.
---
Almost reminds me of the characters from Stardew Valley. Good job, OP!
---
But all the sweaty meta survivors are fine? I really dont understand this community.
---
He’s still not fun imo
---
Sometimes when people suggest gameplay changes they basically whine about the game cause they just lost and didnt want too. I think those are fair to troll. If your gonna make suggestions to gameplay changes it should be unbiased and straight forward, not mentioning that the game is broken without this change, or that the other side has it so easy, etc;
---
Noob3 lying about why he got banned and sending his fans to harass BHVR comes to mind.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
“I’m not paying for these”
---
Yes, thank you! If you're up to red ranks and decent at playing killer, it is entirely possible to down whoever unhooked and hook them and still get hit by someone's DS because the timer is a minute long. It's not tunneling if you hook someone else entirely in the interim but everyone else in this comment thread sure seems to be ignoring how long that timer can get.
---
Not really, maybe on the higher ranks.
---
I would watch this.
---
I don't get why people diss how Quentin looks. He's supposed to look like that. He has to stay awake to avoid Freddy in nightmares. He looks like that due to lack of sleep.
---
It only works sometimes, early game when they are doing well they’ll probably just eat the DS so I won’t try. If I looped them well before getting hooked and they are tunnelling off hook, they often won’t want to grab you out off a locker for more than a minute which either saves you from a hook or saves your team a lot of time to do the objective
---
imagine not playing zombie jeff
---
definitely starting a witch hunt, no I literally was just thinking well what are mods gunna do without a name.
---
Your ego has went through the roof
---
&gt; self care encourages splitting up, which is more efficient than having multiple survivors in the same area.
---
False. Being split up only give time to the killer to interrupt everyone action : fixing gen, healing
---
Going 10% faster by all doing one separate thing is very stupid compared to confirming one action in team. Like being 2 or 3 healing one guy or being 2 or 3 on the same gen.
---
Selfcaring instead of fixing a gen while being hurt until you met one or two other survivor to heal you is what allows the killer to snowball specially with perks like Sloppy and Nurse's which are frequently used.
---
Your power as a survivor is the pressure you put on the killer by doing the objective. If you give him too much breath it can cost the game to the whole survivor team. And the only way to pressurize him is to complete gens.
---
good to know
---
Hag is pretty fun and also gives you Hex: Ruin, one of the best perks in the game (if it can stay active) and is also generally easy to play, but difficult to master. Although, in my personal opinion, buy the hag with shards and get leatherface first. You can’t beat the bloodpoints and tracking abilities BBQ and Chili gives you
---
There are perks for slugging. Slugging is meant to be in the game and the killers are encouraged to use it.
---
You are actively punished for dcing and it's bannable.
---
verbal agreement has some legal validity (at least where I live). maybe not enough for a license but hey, we're getting there.
---
Its beautiful.. I loved the Mario Super Show.
---
Leatherface for sure. I love BBQ.
---
Sooo accurate! Lol
---
It wasn’t a full day obviously but I don’t get home on Saturday until 3:00 and I get off for dinner (I ate late) at 7:30 wit my sister and then I get back on after dinner and my levels were gone
---
get hag with shards freddy with money because freddy is fun to play
---
I never said it doesn't exist on an individual level nor did I say you do or do not like the mentality.
---
Hopefully.

But actually going up against a good nurse will be bit of a shock lol
---
yeah he does that when he gets destroyed and hooks someone in the end game. good thing i stopped watching him ever since
---
Ghostface just stalking him makes it even better
---
I was gonna make that joke!
---
What I was saying was, just because I don’t like it, doesn’t mean my “true colors show” by pointing it out
---
Oh there's definitely a lot of garbage and a lot of ideas that are both repetitive and that experienced players know aren't viable, but like saying "Play better" is garbage, attacking someone because of their skill at a video game is garbage, suggestions or reasons why it's a bad idea are not garbage
---
It is very easy to reach rank one, be it survivor or killer.
---
If they're bad, they had may as well not exist. 
---
Dream pallets are straight downgrade.
---
Dresses are nearly worthless. 
---
Blocks are *actually* worthless. 
---
Ropes are the only full line of add-ons that are good in theory, but its not super easy to see them working their magic. 
---
Paint Brush and Box are OK, but ultra rare and not all that good.
---
Class photo isn't terrible, but in my experience being able to cancel your power is better than being mildly spooky. A net zero or slight downgrade. 
---
Pill Bottle is his best add on.
---
DC'ing was like bad sportsmanship according to the devs. Not bannable for sure, cuz the game is so buggy that it would be hard to find the actual DCs and not the game crashes. But a jerk move in my book, for sure.
---
puppers has a tendency to bm at pallets and tries to tease killers when they're far from him on purpose, he also whines about hitboxes almost every time he gets hit
---
His camping is quite different. He doesnt simply hang around the victim but rather he predicts others are gonna come for unhook and strikes at that moment which of course can be seen as camping but it is not his fault for playing smart
---
I mean it's Unreal, which Absolver, Borderlands, Arkham(Asylum, City, Knight, and Origins), Days Gone, and what all Gears games used, so it's really the modeling they're doing.
---
Well for starters make the leave button give you a ban. You can still pull the cable, alt+f4 or kill yourself in the hook, but at least it'll make people realize of what's comming and that they shouldn't be disconnecting systematically.
---
no, they didn't
---
No0b3:
---
thats unlikely though. there are two types of people in Hollywood - those that care deeply about their creations, and those that want to make as much money as possible. i think its safe to assume that most Hollywood people will want to make as much money as possible.
---
i dont think its entirely unlikely though. Stephen King seems like he cares enough about his creations to also care about what collaborations he will do. i think its possible he'd prefer a game that suits Pennywise more.
---
but as a general thing, nah, its unlikely. people just want money, man :/
---
Wholesome
---
Haha
---
Play better vs Omega Blink nurse with Infectious Fright? Ok...
---
I know :(
---
I still dont see how its better than Lery's though. Its got so many walls and shit
---
Nope
---
I'll only do this when the killer is slugging me for a 4k, I've got better things to do than be left on the floor for 4 minutes because of someone's fragile ego. I DC, they get the hatch and we both get in a new game instead of me just watching my character bleed out for 4 minutes. 
---
And for the record, I'm not talking about when someone gets downed and you can see the last person with them. I'm talking about killers that have no idea where they are but are happy to waste 4 minutes of your time where you can't do nothing but leave a bloody slug trail...fun. 
---
"It's only 4 minutes", not when it happens so frequently it's not. I especially don't understand it when there's 4-5 gens left, you're probably going to find the hatch before they do anyways since you can walk around freely.
---
Edit: I actually did this to a spirit when I was solo and there was 5 gens left...the hatch appeared right next to the other person. Good ol' karma especially considering if she'd had just hooked me, she have probably found the hatch first since she can cover so much distance so quickly.
---
Why are you critiquing a perk that is not even intended for use. Obviously the hackers used it because it is OP and they want to gain the upper hand, not because they intend to play fair.
---
Fuck that perk is so frustratingly bad! Even if everyone injured it still only adds 10secs to the time it takes to complete a gen. Fuck two missed ruin checks gives about that much. And you don't need to have 4 survivors injured
---
I agree, I think people should just ignore the posts if anything but they're really is a lot of complaning that goes around in this subredddit and a lot are hidden as game change ideas and a lot of people can tell. I'll have to look for the post you were talking about and see
---
Yea! Play better. If you can't, then practice. It's how you get better.
---
I think you did a pretty good  J O B
---
*Blendette would like to know your location*
---
I mean, why not critique it? Not doing any harm anyways.
---
This subreddit is not for reporting people. You have to report the person in game and then file for a support ticket on the Dead by Daylight website.
---
For me it's Freddy, pig and doc, but that's personal choice. Freddy is by far the most fun to play, pig is great if you like it stealthy, and doc, well doc is just a bastard. 
---
That said BBQ is worth its weight in gold, so leatherface is one you may want to get.
---
Freddy, Demogorgon, Hag and Ghostface don’t benefit a lot from add-ons (unless you’re doing a specific meme build).
---
lmao...killers like this...pfff
---
More cant be bothered to deal with toxic bullshit when they dont get their way
---
I was literally just imitating what you said about my "true colors showing" because it seemed like you were implying I was a killer main? Who even knows. It didn't make any sense
---
Whats wrong with neas eyes
---
Entity displeased
---
I was literally just thinking about this, i remembered there was an iri king, but what about the queen
---
...yes they did. Bruce Campbell voices Ash in DBD
---
My friend is unknowingly bug-eyed a lot of the time, just how he is hahaha
---
Huh? Ash’s voice is Bruce Campbell in game.
---
was thinking of demogorgon cuz you can place a portal next to it and easily teleport to it once you hook the last survivor
---
Amazing to watch, RIP to my Piggy tho😭😭😭
---
Lol fuck you kid survivors fucking t-bag 24-7 but when killers can to you fucking complain on reddit?  R u gonna  beg the devs now to nurf him cuz u don’t like him t-bagging back😂😂😂
---
If it scared test audiences, shouldn't that have been a GOOD thing? Jesus. This sounds like a decision made by a bunch of out of touch boomers on a board of directors.
---
He is cosplaying as the entity
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/de6ulf/hey_guys_whats_your_thought_about_demogorgon/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Words are hard at 5 AM :(
---
Two randoms did this to me as killer.
---
__*"SWING YOUR HANDS, FROM SIDE-TO-SIDE!"*__
---
Yeah that's exactly what I was saying. Maybe we shouldn't call it camping. Or if you do call it camping it's not the bad kind of camping.
---
But there's a lot of killers (Tru3 for example) who get called toxic for doing the same thing. On the extreme case, there's some streamers who legit toxic camp and their viewers don't think it's bad. OP was just pointing out the hypocrisy that's out there.
---
Abso-fucking-lutely. 
---
DS isn't an anti-tunneling perk or else it would deactivate when you don't tunnel. All it is is another crutch/anti-hook/anti-don't kill-survivors-too-fast-please perk designed by the devs to placate low skilled survivor mains. They even nerfed Enduring then lied to us that it was "better now" just to make DS have no counter.
---
If DS was truly anti-tunneling then it would deactivate immediately when you hooked another survivor, and would also deactivate if the previously hooked survivor purposely tried to take a protection hit since that survivor would then be purposely trying to put his/herself in harms way to taunt you.
---
But the devs are spineless about addressing this and will wholeheartedly lie about this perk just being anti-tunnelling. And survivor mains will continue to parade their propoganda about it being anti-tunneling also. But anyone with logic knows the truth.
---
And that's why killers should never respect DS. Don't fuck over yourself to appease the devs or survivors. What takes longer: waiting out a minute or taking a 5 second DS then chasing and downing that survivor again? If you are a good killer no chase should take over 40 seconds so it makes more sense time-wise to take the ds then immediately down that survivor unless there is another survivor around you that you feel you down sooner.
---
The &lt;only&gt; time you should wait out a DS timer is if that's the last remaining survivor and you haven't found/closed the hatch yet. Other than that, fuck DS.
---
The last one should say: "At least I don't scream like a bitch"
---
Plague is so fun
---
your friends talkin shit
---
Hatch Time
---
sorry my bad got Ace and Ash mixed up
---
Shouldve been Quentin hahaha
---
I hate when people dc. I waited 29 minutes for a match just for everybody to dc. I literally loaded in as leather face and then came across one player for them one by one to dc.
---
To be honest I wanted him to be Quentin originally for the memes but Nea is his main LOL
---
There’s never just one killer
---
guess i need to try it again next season... after a week or two so i really have chance hahaha :D
---
I broke his brain boys
---
That's exactly what most killers do. Survivors will still complain about it every time.
---
Indeed
---
r/corn
---
It's a start. The Trapper should have it when he's placing down his traps as well.
---
Otzdarva would like to know your location.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight... tunneling into your heart, one sacrifice at a time!
---
Custom games are unplayable ever since the ST release, and BHVR still haven’t fixed it.
---
You underestimate the bloodpoints BBQ gives.
---
It could be... but as survivor, the deep wound timer also does not go down unless outside of the Legion’s terror radius. Maybe this is what you were experiencing.
---
What perks you running? What's your play style? You like to get gens? Help out your team? Able to distract and run the killer round? What rank you playing at?
---
Maybe you're running around too much, like after you miss a skill check or getting a survivor off the hook, and you're leaving scratch marks all over the place.
---
Faced this an hour ago. Straight up did not have a good time.
---
I was able to play 3-4 games but then it stopped working
---
Someone said to me on PS4 messages "it's always the Bills" 😂
---
That sucks mate, can't believe he didn't take a hit for you and then just throws the pallet down on ya...yeesh.
---
dude. how? the adept killer achievements are so fricking hard :c
---
I was definitely out of his terror radius and it still didnt go down.. probs a visual glitch
---
Ah I see your a man of culture as well.
---
Then you should! :D
---
I love it so idk
---
Ah ok.
---
Its unavoidable. You get more points than you used to. Run anti tunnel perks
---
I love finding the hatch as soon as the last survivor finds it. We just look at each other and they surrender
---
I'm starting to notice (on killer and survivor side) that Bill's are either godlike or absolute mops, there's no in between.
---
So Jonathan Byers then.
---
Flair checks out
---
They are done testing it so they turned it off
---
I’m a pig main and cannibal main. People hate me,
---
[play this and then look at the picture](https://youtu.be/TaVJaF2Mt7c)
---
same but it’s definitely cursed
---
Lol.. make the leave button give you a ban.. if it's there it's there for a reason. Imagine banning people for using a button in the game, however if they don't want people to use it they could remove it.
---
Needs Clown's perk and distressing for peak meme performance.
---
Me and my friend tried to start a custom match so we could look around Hawkins Lab. Every-time I joined my friend said I wasn’t even in the match even though I could see him. Trying to start the match simply said “Could not connect to host” even for the host themselves.
---
Thanks, was thinking that but on the off chance I was exceptional at the game I had to know before I started bragging to my friends
---
For sure I agree
---
I even think 35 seconds is too long. If I can't get a hit in 20ish seconds, I leave them. If they run to where no gens are, I leave them. If they are way better at looping than I am at chasing or they bring me to pallet town, I leave them. 
---
If I waste more than 30 seconds chasing someone with nothing to show for it, that's almost half a generator if one person is working on it. If the three other survivors are all working on different gens, that's 3 gens that are almost half done, and it's very possible I just lost the game.
---
it's only 10% if it's 2 survivors, the penalty gets worse with each survivor working at the same gen.
---
also it's not stupid at all, if the killer finds the gen you were working on (and chances are high since even with 3 people it still takes plenty of time)  he will then be pressuring multiple people at the same time.
---
looping gets harder with people around, people will camp the gen doing nothing until the killer leaves and some killers like the plague and legion can easily deal damage to multiple survivors at once.
---
also how does the killer snowball if everyone but the person being chased is in a different area?
---
i will always repair with someone else when there are like 2 gens left or when i have the chance to quickly finish a tricky gen before the killer comes back but there's no way i'm staying close to anyone else at the start of a game.
---
and ruin alone is quite a big reason
---
All I get most of the Times are either rank 20 or people trying to kill me :/
---
sexy time has BEGUN
---
Hmm very interesting
---
How come?
---
All that means is the actor says it's ok. Very highly likely that he has 0 control over the access to his likeness as Quentin.
---
Ah shit, going to edit it. STBFL is one of the best killer perks period. I knew something slipped my mind.
---
ok? he can play for fun but if hes gonna play for fun why the fuck is he bitching about losing?
---
Yes.
---
Yeah but someone spent at least 2 minutes on this post op gosh/s
---
I’ll stop struggling and sacrifice myself on a hook if they find hatch, but dc? Nope. That’s crummy.
---
I mean, speaking as a new player, I regularly keep getting 4 SWF teams who pack instaheal, flashlights, or keys, or some variation of the three. Didn’t even know what those were till I watched some guides.
---
The toxic tree grows in both directions, my man (even though I personally refuse to play nurse or billy because I love Doc and Mikey too much).
---
He did "cosplay" him once in-game... like no mither cause "gumbas are insta-downs" and always crouching around &gt;.&lt;
---
He’s always good for a few jump scares, but he’s much more fun to play as than against
---
Depends on what they run
---
I find dodging against a corrupted vomit easier to dodge a m1 when on a loop with high wall. And at lower ranks it takes longer for a plague to give up on vomit and going to m1, so you save more time
---
fucking sue him
---
I’m a simple man, I see All Might, I give an updoot
---
Look who's talling in the shit grass
---
It's bait
---
Woah! Very cool!
---
I meant "waste more time" instead of save
---
As a Ghostface main, I spit at the idea of someone running NOED. He's not an M1 killer. As for the DC, blame the survivor because they also just ruined any chance I had at getting points into We're Gonna Live Forever when I'm the one on their team. DCing is stupid if you haven't even gotten hooked yet, and NOED is stupid if you're not an M1 killer.
---
Fucks like this deserve to be bullied every game :) 
---
Kinda makes me wish the bane of this community would be unbanned for a bit. Just so he could fuck these little shits up
---
I *love* playing against pigs because I legitimately get scared when they pop up out of nowhere. Stealth killers = extra spoopage.
---
I’ve run into these folks a few times. It’s always been in the game, but it seems a bit more prevalent now. I guess the logic is to get the killer to chase someone else in order to escape. Dick move, idk if it’s bannable or reportable (maybe unsportsmanlike behavior)
---
Now i want a chefs knife for my kitchen that has Myers reflection laser etched in it
---
Someone put him through FaceApp to make him look younger, and it worked. It made him actually look 16-20ish, while also sleep deprived. Even if the Kyle Gallner thing doesn't work out, it would be relatively easy to make him look better.
---
i have ds brah don't worry
---
You're right I didn't think about that. She shouldn't have been that far in the exit for sure
---
Clem would be my new main.
---
Sounds like a dick move if they are purposely running the killer towards someone else in the hopes the killer goes for them instead.
---
One think I will say is if I'm repairing a gen or something and see an injured survivor being chased quite often I'll run out and try to take a hit, if I'm healthy, to buy them more time but they definitely shouldn't be trying to lead a killer to someone else. Sometimes it can't be helped and happens by mistake though.
---
My own viewers will shit talk me for that
---
You’re fine I responded in a way that made your comment seem way worse
---
Like what?
---
Definitely Freddy, he's a lot of fun now that they reworked him.
---
One time I was against a 4 blink nurse. She downed us within the first minute of the game and left us as slugs and I have NEVER DCd before but each and every one of us DCd after that lol it was just impassible.
---
There really isn’t a killer I play most of the time. I’m levelling them up not only to get all the perks but to know how to play each killer. That’s why I play the killer I level up because once I’m done, I’ll decide on which killer I’ll main. 
---
For who I’ll level up after leatherface it seems to me it will either be hag or Michael. More of a chance it would be Michael since he is already level 23.
---
You say that if this game has a practice mode or if everyone has a group of friends to test certain builds in KYF.
---
I love playing with him on the team lol. Really boosts my morale to hear that classic "GROOVY!".
---
Infinite tier 3 Myers is not fun to play against. I'd rather lick acid rain from an umbrella than deal with that.
---
It's so frustrating to have someone disconnect 2 minutes into the game, when when they haven't been hooked!
---
I kinda feel bad for being able to read that
---
Freddy is considered a higher tier killer, and ghostface is more fun imo.
---
Both are great, you can't go wrong with either.
---
I’m gonna put some dirt in your eye
---
Servers
---
Thank
---
Ghost face is more fun imo.
---
Freddy's fake pallets give survivors anxiety and can be devastating against even skilled survivors.
---
I mean, don't you want to teabag the survivor who teabags after throwing their first pallet?
---
I've been running plunderers+ace in the hole lately. It's pretty fun not knowing what you'll have for a match, and to give your teammates nice gifts (usually flashlights, i suck with them)
---
Extra portals are actually really good on demo
---
U didn't jump off the roof?
---
I hear you. I find Premonition works pretty good against the Pig, although it’s annoying to have to equip a specific perk on the chance that the killer *might* be her.
---
My friends and I always do. Starts healing "Oh yeah. Just like that. The good touch."
---
Thanks !
---
Hey, I'm rank 12 Billy and this still applies to me
---
Not gonna lie............ As a new DBD player, I thought Quentin was Jonathan from Stranger Things
---
Oh yeah Pig definitely needs a huge buff to be honest. She's very underpowered so I agree. I don't really think we need new objective, but the problem is that the game becomes incredibly unbalanced against 4 survivors, true.
---
Honey. Notice how you’re the one getting downvoted and not me? May I suggest you take a look at your attitude?
---
.....is ace a licensed character?
---
Reason I heard was so people won't just DC to give swf groups bonus points. Whether that is true or not I don't know
---
The game implies that the devs thought anyone would cleanse against Plague, which tricks a lot of new players into not realizing that's a reportable offense.
---
Edit: /s jesus why must I do this?
---
I guess it’s because sometimes in Swf survivors will dc on purpose to make sure their friend gets the hatch or something like that.  So they don’t reward them for something that was specifically done for them
---
No, I don’t use inner strength. I didn’t like it as much as I was hoping. I run second wind, head on, DS and we’ll make it. Works a treat
---
good idea they should make it 25 percent for 1 empty slot 50 for 2 empty slots 100 for 3 empty slots and 200 for 4 empty slots events bp events would be the least toxic experiance for both sides then but with that i think they would have to make a p4 a p5 and stuff like that or at least make teachable harder
---
At least TrU3Ta1ent seems to be on the up-and-up. - he’s been an immense source of info for me as a baby killer.
---
Then again I only just started playing, so who knows, maybe he does camp and I haven’t seen it yet.  I hope not though.
---
Ah yes, my neighbour [Tuturu!](https://youtu.be/ImhfIv5NSqY)
---
The data was taken over like 6 days in May ages ago when the game was starting to die down a little and didn't even include the ptb, I would like to know what rank you are at because if you got to red ranks with killer I think you'd start to notice a pattern
---
New killer: Gage Creed
---
it's fun having dbd portable though.
---
kbm is much easier for me at least, but for survivor the controls are fine. Killer is hard tho.
---
Lol classic can’t come up with an actual argument so u just insult me instead of proving me wrong
---
Thats the only way to kill with the Legion. Theres nothing else Legion mains can do. If they go for everyone in the map, it’ll cost them the game unless the team is a potato
---
Watch some videos on YT. Plenty of tips and tricks. And you WILL have toxic survivors t bag you and message you but you will also get survivors that are cool. Good luck out there.
---
camping and tunneling are also possible for the killer to do, doesn't make it any less sweaty or toxic.
---
Then they bring Head On, and they stun after they are healed. Lose lose for the killer
---
Couldnt have said it better maself
---
I wait for the day there’s a god who reaches rank 1 as only LeatherFace
---
If you were playing killer, this would've been a safety pip at most
---
Ok, will do when I next enter "The Game"!
---
Patience and YT. I recommend Otzdarva or Oh tofu, you learn a lot. Int3r4ct has more in depth videos called "entity education" series, about 40 min long.
---
Just focus on getting bloodpoints and learning. Don't let 4 man escapes discourage you, since you'll get a lot of them.
---
What really helped me starting off in the game was watching big YouTubers play killer and learn from their strategies. Playing survivor also kinda helps because you learn from what the killers too. For YouTube, I’d recommend dudes like monto, pain reliever, truetalent, and ohtofu. They all give tips while they play and run creative builds that usually give you a new perspective on certain things in the game :)
---
Watch videos on YouTube.  If you come into this game blind you’ll get bullied every game.  With basic knowledge of “mind games” and the game in general you’ll climb ranks
---
You got this
---
This loool. I try not to dc. But if I have like 8+ bad games and then I get a prayer beads spirit game, I think the fuck not I’m staying
---
So a killer using an intended strategy is sweaty, but circumventing the game mechanics and leaving the game is perfectly fine? I can't wait for the husk when survivors leave.
---
Its situational, but far less than unbreakable. What's more likely, that your team will do all the gens or that the killer will leave slug you? Naturally its the former.
---
Also, keep in mind, even if you aren't injured, you still get a speed boost once the gens are done. Not to mention, no one runs it because they know they will need it, they run it in case the need it. Its the definition of a crutch perk that the killer has no way of overcoming.
---
Slugging is actively encouraged with perks such as "deer stalker" "knockout" and "infectious fright"
---
Camping is something a killer can do, but it's not bannable. It's also actively punished, but only if uneeded.
---
Tunneling is discouraged by some survivor perks, but not punished by the game because it's just the killer doing his job.
---
Dcing is punished, discouraged by the devs and game, and is bannable.
---
Pretty big leap.
---
You should look up some more things that were removed from horror movies for being "too scary", I bet you'd find it very frustrating! I did Haha. I don't understand why they'd remove it if it did what they wanted. I love when I can leave a scary movie and feel scared when I get home!
---
What the person before me said, just be patient. Watching youtube videos and what not on how to play killer qnd run certain map tiles is also really beneficial for beginners. Perks also help a ton so either level up certain killers for them or if you dont have them then you just have to wait for them to appear in the shrine of secrets. Don't camp the people that you hook, once you hook someone move on to the next target. Obviously if you see someone running straight for the hook go for said person. If they do unhook the person go for the uninjured survivor as a lot of people run a perk called borrowed time. Patrolling gens is usually a good way to find survivors. Dont get sucked into one chase forever. If the survivor your chasing is experienced and you cant seem to catch them just leave the chase and find someone else. That's about all I can think of right now, I'm sure some other/better people will give you some other tips.
---
Done 🐷👍
---
Hi everyone! Thanks for the support and the notes i really appreciate it. Another thing im thinking about is buying other killers but it seems really expensive what do you guys think
---
You can't expect to go into a game, especially one out for 4+ years and expect to do well right off the bat.
---
Why put so much pressure on yourself to be good off the bat?
---
Play, practice, learn.
---
Steve Harrington sounds like a hentai girl when they get nutted on
---
Pallets respawning or am I getting whooshed?
---
Spoiler alert but nea kills him
---
Camping is actively encouraged by Insidious.
---
None the less all three are toxic, boring, and worth DCing on so that you don't have to wait around for the killer to get his sweaty 4k.
---
SpIdER-mAn nEedS tO be NerFeD!!!!
---
what  excuse me
---
same goes to survivors!
---
People forget that female characters don't have to fit their beauty standard I guess she looks fine to me too
---
pig is the best
---
Even if you don't play leatherface, BBQ and chili is pivotal. You need those BP to level and make your other killers stronger.
---
Dcing because you dont like how the other side plays makes you a bitch. It doesnt matter what they do that you dont like, you are still a bitch.
---
Camping, tunneling, slugging, teabagging, killling yourself are all aspects of the game, things the entity allows in its realm. DCing is a 4th wall break that is more of an exploit then a game mechanic. Even if there is a button for it it’s not supposed to be used as a system control like settings not a legit strategy.
---
Sad part is that Kyle Gallner, the original actor/likeness of Quentin wants them to make him a pretty boi too. 
---
His tweet: https://twitter.com/kylegallner/status/1169396227902824448?s=21
---
(Now if only Jaime Lee Curtis or whomever owns Halloween would let them fix Laurie’s face)
---
You have no idea what you are talking about
---
They would either be survivor or killer biased.
---
So do a lot of other players who get accused of camping/tunneling.
---
Zoom bitch!!
---
Yeah!! Like any game, DBD requires practice and persistence. Take your time and have fun learning your strengths.
---
Easy, might have some bad games on the road but majority of games you’d pip. Ranking up is just too easy
---
No problem bhy easy mistake on this place
---
Claudette, Kate, and Jake sound the best to me. Rip as a Feng main though
---
It's overheating. Have you hard reset your console? Could help.
---
Most of the time those ideas are unbalanced and stupid, due to salt.
---
And that is that. I've seen this community encourage most of the time good, balanced ideas.
---
The build i use on billy is BBQ, Discordance, Ruin, And enduring.
---
i mean id buy the hell out of that.

He’s supposed to look like a tired Kyle Gallner, who isn’t that hideous. He even wants them to fix the mess that they made out of Quentin’s face.
---
If only you were swf she could stay up there as a scout
---
Slugging for a 4k because you cant stand losing one person makes you a sweat lord, it doesn't matter how good of a killer you think you are, you are a still a sweet lord.
---
Once you hit rank 6-8 killer if you don’t play top tiers you tend to get destroyed pretty hard.... there’s a reason why 90% of red ranks are Spirits and Nurses now
---
Even Tapp tbh. He looks good as a model but it looks nothing like Danny Glover
---
Not that I know....
---
https://twitter.com/kylegallner/status/1169396227902824448?s=21
---
Yes he did. Here it is.
---
Droppes?
---
I do it when I know another person hasn’t been hooked and I’m on death hook :3c
---
I mailed Freddy before his rework and I was decent at him and then after the rework I continued playing him and people constantly bitched about me playing an OP killer.
---
Thing is, enough potato survivors up there to help you pip along the way. I rotate between killers every time and I’m not struggling with maintaining rank 1. Not denying Leatherface is the worst killer in the game though
---
Can you expand on the Dead Space 2 bit? I remember they looked at car crash victims for inspiration in making the necromorphs.
---
That's a valid theory my dude. Though there's no backing it up, I always kinda got more of a midwesterner vibe (Minnesota, maybe?) from Dwight.
---
When is this starting?
---
I guess given the last event was survivors getting the cankers and then giving up made them change it
---
People yell at me for having a bad Doc build, I just like playing him.
---
I’d say freddy
---
I mean the actor for Jonathan was caught with cocaine at an airport so...
---
"You want to win a competitive game. That makes you a bad person".
---
Or wiggled??
---
Im a Survivor main and the only killer i play is Huntress. I'm getting better and better over time at landing hatchets so i definetly agree with you. This is really wholesome
---
Just point at each other until the killer shows up and decides your fate
---
Then pallet land will become real.
---
Good thing I still have about 11 of these from last year
---
Dont stress the idea that if you dont 4k you wont have fun.
---
This game has a steep learning curve but after some time in you'll get the hang of it all.
---
Some of my favorite moments are in the chases/jump scares. I personally could care less if I let all survivors escape or 4k. I've had such a better time with this game once I just enjoyed it for its entirety rather than a win or lose aspect. Especially in the beginning.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/Provengeance_ - playing rank 1 no add-ons no perks Leatherface right now. Games: 30; 4ks: 23.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz - a Pig main that consistently goes without Ruin, often without add-ons, seldomly camps or tunnels, yet consistently 3-4ks at rank 1.
---
These are just two random examples out of hundreds of killers that 3-4k most of their matches day in and day out, and again, these two are even examples of killers that do so without camping/tunnelling/slugging hard.
---
It is not hard to win the majority of your matches as any killer at any rank, if you are a good or even just a decent player. It just really is not, and &lt;500 hour reddit killer mains are simply bad players.
---
One of the killers I like to play against the most, unless they play scummy. Playing as him is alright
---
Top two by a mile: BBQ and chili / Hex Ruin. You should prioritise getting those two.
---
Enduring / Spirit Fury / Save the best for last / Brutal Strength / Make your choice / Pop goes the weasel / Discordance / Nurses Calling / Sloppy Butcher... Would come as next one's to get.
---
This is general, not focused on those two killers.
---
Of the said above, Make your Choice, STBFL and PGTW are extremely strong on the demogorgon.
---
I think Nea looks worse than Laurie
---
What's that scary instrument at the start? It gave me chills!
---
&gt;Adrenaline rewards survivors for playing well. Noed rewards killers for playing badly.
---
First off, NOED counters gen rushing, so if we're being accurate, its more akin to the new Decisive Strike, which was designed to counter tunneling. Besides adrenaline is far better than NOED could be, so they're not even comparable. 
---
Secondly, no Adrenaline does not reward survivors for playing well. Firstly, it rewards you regardless of what you do. You could have been afk the entire time and adrenaline will still pop. And secondly, it rewards you with an insta-heal (even off hook) and a speed boost for doing the bare minimum, at best. If you're unhooked with adrenaline, congrats, you've just escaped because there's nothing the killer can do at that point. 
---
Killers have no way to counter Adrenaline whereas survivors can easily counter NOED.
---
Pallets respawning every match
---
no
---
Agree on the pallets.
---
Dresses are meh, but not useless.
---
The blocks are pretty fun if you stack 2 of them, just saying.
---
Ropes are amazing
---
Paint brush is VERY strong with purple/green rope
---
The box basically makes you obsession insanely easy to take down/keep track of, quite strong but should be purple imo.
---
Class photo is amazing. As soon as they realize you have it they will ditch every gen every time you use your power. You just have to change the way you use it (no more fakes) and be more confident with it.
---
Pill bottle is decent but not his best or even second best imo. That would be the paint brush and purple rope (swing chains?) As they can quite seriously slow a game down.
---
lol
---
The dev maps are biased already lol.
---
Why not both /s
---
This legion let you live btw, if he didn’t want you to get out then you wouldn’t have
---
Yeah , we need pennywise or that middle head is a lie
---
Tbh I can really see that as well, it reflects in his cosmetics and backstory. Honestly I'm incredibly excited for the archives next month so we get to learn more about the characters
---
I haven't heard that Spiderman song in so long, nice to know it's still so good
---
Yep. I prefer being at low ranks. I don't bully the killers there, it's just so much more chill and fun. More killer/perk variance and less sweat. I can actually have fun and games don't all feel the same.
---
Same thing on killer side. Due to sweatiness and meta whoring, playing at high ranks just isn't fun for either party, and there's no incentive to rank up at all. It's pointless and really unfun.
---
NYEEEHHHH!!!!!
---
i bet itd be ok on legion if you just stab the shit out of everyone cus then mend goes slower too
---
Did you do it?
---
Lockers. Lockers everywhere.
---
yeah, i was surprised that they didnt get rid of him after than smuggling drugs in the airport its no joke.
---
Nancy’s Jaw line is probably the most unique jaw shape I’ve ever seen on somebody. Even before the the character model’s were revealed I knew Nancy’s face would be a tough task. I’m surprised (imo) that the art team did as good as they did comparing them to their past work aka Quinten, Ash, and Laurie. 
---
Quinten looks like a meth head from skid row. 
---
Ash looks like somebody’s grandma who is cosplaying ash. 
---
Laurie looks like a crossdresser with her hay like stiff hair, making it look like she’s wearing a wig.
---
Is the ranking system broken in this game? I got the game on Monday last week and I am already ranked 7 with 45 hours of play. I definitely had baby Dwight moments and still can't loop properly, but if I go for saves and repairs I usually get at least one tick per match
---
I've been playing non stop for a week and have greatly improved. It was discouraging to recieve a few messages taunting me for being a baby killer, but here I am now lol.
---
It’s like wine, you get better over time. Keep practicing, and you’ll be Rank 1 Eventually.
---
if you define "good" as relatively as possible, sure
---
Plague gets boring really fast, I personally like the clown
---
So yeah. Nothing new.
---
This is like one of the easiest ways to get banned in this game. Only quicker way I know of is to blatantly hack legacy on a brand new account. 
---
I'd say just remove the perk from the game files entirely, but as long as it keeps getting people nuked from orbit for cheating I guess it serves a purpose.
---
just in case, i know that the servers are bugued af for the killer and that's why they removed it again
---
I have been watching a lot of videos. Otherwise, you will learn through practice and continued play. It can really hurt when all of the survivors quickly accumulate those gens, but you'll learn your own style and be able to feel out where they may run to next or be hiding.
---
wtf i have never seen this in a game before
---
Tbf that’s three perks for a combo that only works once. Not that it’s not annoying if everyone brings it but anything is annoying when a swf multiplies it by four.
---
I enjoy bubba just cuz some guys would hide in a corner and id just trap them in it and then jus saw them up
---
United States of Stab
---
As someone who often runs anti-heal Legion, I can safely tell you that it's not worth a perk slot. Its effects are so minuscule, you don't notice any difference when equipping it.  
---
You're better off with almost any other perk. Thanatophobia needs a buff or a rework.
---
do yourself a favor and don't watch it
---
I’m a killer main and there’s only two things that scare me: 4 man red rank Claudette SWF teams, and zombie Jeffs
---
Clowns like you can't be reasoned with, you just go out looking for arguments to add some excitement to your sad little circus life
---
You'll really notice it when you try to crouch behind something as Adam
---
Meta build for a survivor has not changed much.
---
Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time and Dead Hard are still the best build possible.
---
Another strong options are balanced landing, iron will (invaluable against spirit), bond, lithe... 
---
A perk that was meta and now is not (though a lot of ppl still use it) is self care. It simply wastes too much time. 
---
Among the survivor perks released since old freddy, I'd rate Deliverance, Dance with me, Head On and Inner Strength as the best ones.
---
Edit: I take it you're asking for survivor advice.
---
I just want more urban/interior maps and less Slenderman: The Game™-like ones, I don't care if its made by the devs or by the community if they ever release a map tool. We have enough forest maps already.
---
Give us more urban streets (like Haddonfield ~~but better looking now that they have experience~~), interiors (a big ass house, a factory, an indoor parking lot, a **high school**, a **mall**...), actual map design things that make em look like they belong to slasher/horror films. It's too easy to go the cheap way and make a forest full of trees with 3/4 decorations like a broken ship or an abandoned fuel station thrown in there and call it a map.
---
Why is this so wholesome?! DDD:&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
I’ve heard of doing that, but what does that do?
---
While I do disagree with you when talking about self-care, you have a point here. One that I kinda disagree too, but a better point. The problem is that, when you split up, everything is done slower, but if you gang up, everything is done faster but is risky.
---
But we shouldn't discuss about whether to work together *all the time* or not work together *at all*. The best way to survive by far is to have two groups of people running together, and you are right, there are hard counters for this, but it's precisely because if Survivors play this way the game is highly favorable to them.
---
The problem is not that you should all split up every game because the Killer most surely has Ruin, is that the Killer will more often than not use Ruin because they don't want Survivors to run around in groups.
---
The best way to play is to run in groups of two whenever possible, then if needed split up. Each group goes to different sides of the map, so if hell breaks loose in one side, at least one Survivor can go to the other side to help or get healed *if* the Killer hard counters groups, like Legion. If not, just wait by the generator and wait for the other to be hooked or to come back for the heal.
---
New dlc character, I dont think it will for a while
---
Nah. You overthinking it way too much.
---
Just loose a few times until you are rank 15, or get better
---
Cool.
---
Just DC every match.  But expect hate mail.  Or stand where you spawn and wait the game out.
---
GGEZ
---
It is, unless you have you know 5000 hours.  Most people don’t have the time to do this, but props to them.  Still very strange cause tons of popular streamers have difficulty getting wins at high ranks with bad killers even with best perks and add ons.
---
New hunter: James J. Jameson

New survivor: Peter Man

New Map: NY

They certainly didn’t try to let me live. They were sloppy, cocky and assumed the kill was secured. I know this because of the message they sent me afterwards. He also tried to pick me up and couldn’t because Meg was blocking the way. Their only chance, after picking me up, was to hope I’d fail the skill check on DS. But again, I wasn’t trying to highlight my escape or the killer’s mistakes, but the fact a random player, who could’ve left at any time to secure their 5000 points, stayed behind and risked it all.
---
They can make a limited number of lockers and pallets. Like, implement something that makes a map unable to be shared or played in if there's more or less than X pallets/lockers/generators.
---
I think there is to much blood tbh
---
But what about moris? Entity doesn’t take them away
---
You hate her enough to let another guy fuck her ?
---
I finally got to rank 2 today only by playing anti-heal Legion
---
I had some bad games down the road but I think I had much more good than bad games
---
I'm Rank 4 Bubba main rn. The dream's still real
---
I am subscribed  to you . For when you will do this again ;)
---
We get free ones?
---
Give Quentin a scoops ahoy outfit
---
The guy is a joke. “optimal survivors” in his videos often run self-care, can’t loop for days and just do gens because tru3 can’t apply enough pressure as he’s keen on tunneling one survivor at a strong loop. MiNdGaMeS: survivors make a mistake and suddenly he mindgames them. Bans people from his chat who don’t agree with his bs opinions. Not very healthy for the game and the community
---
All this is more noticable on his Twitch than on his youtube (of course).
---

I'd love to make a MacMillian mansion map. It would be an interior/exterior hybrid. I'd give it a lot of verticality, something the game is really lacking. I'd be a nice experimental map.
---
Thank you, it’s for Halloween and I wanted it to stand out, not that a lot of people go as the huntress for Halloween anyways 🤷‍♀️
---
How do you deal with cocky assholes? Ignore them? And what changes? Nothing. A taste of one’s medicine is usually helpful and makes them contemplate their actions sometimes.
---
maybe its a p3 head? i havent seen it on huntress though so idk if thats close or not
---
i hear it but i doubt theres a connection, especially in a movie trailer
---
No Boyfriend's Memo SMH
---
sorry no advice but your mom is awesome and that looks dope!!
---
I played a game as The Wraith on another account that's low rank and ran into a baby Dwight and I just ended up watching him for like 3 minutes slowly crouching across the map while I walked slowly in invisibility behind him, it was so cute
---
Nothing in this world is cuter than a baby Dweet. Puppies and kittens have nothing on him.
---
No idea. Literally just picked the first picture
---
I would play with you, just I have a PS4. Sorry, but if I had this on my Windows PC, I would definitely play.
---
Thank you! We worked really hard on it. I’m glad you like it ♥️
---
2Fort themes map when?
---
You're probably right but it's still a really strange coincidence.
---
We know. And if you check the replies, you can see that Mathieu actually told him to contact them via DM so they can work together to fix the character, but who knows if Kyle Gallner actually contacted the team or not. All we can do is wait...
---
For Laurie, even if the owners of the franchise wanted them to, it would still not be enough since we're talking about representing an actual person. Those individuals own their image, and since Jamie already told them that they didn't have permission to replicate her image, Laurie will stay like that forever. Sadly...)
---
Laughs in ebony moris 5 blink gen grabber insta saw killer
---
Or run head on

Thank you so much c: ❤️
---
My actual fetish. Nurse is best girl
---
What the fuck is the point of critiquing a perk that was never implemented into the game ? There is a reason it wasn't, no need to "critique" it.
---
Did he delete all his comments? Lol.
---
Tru3? No. WAAAAAY better killers out there. Sae thing For survivor. Otz? Great guy, explains a lot of different perks in his perk builds but isn’t highly skilled either. I like watching Otz though
---
stop playing legion you edgy csgo player
---
That dog tho
---
If you want to become a good killer, my advice is to start playing as Survivor.  You will learn the basic mechanics of the game as well as how survivors think.  It is invaluable to play both sides of the spectrum.  I learned how different killers, maps, and perks worked before I ever touched a killer.
---
I was intimidated starting as killer too, but because of what I learned as survivor, I got a 4K my first 3 games.  Ranked up like crazy.  And playing killer also taught me how to be a better survivor.
---
It’s not a real perk. They hacked it in from the game files.
---
If you're always scared, you'll never kill people. Wow that's a weird sentence out of context
---
I know most of you know but I figured the tweet itself would be helpful just in case anyone doesn’t know. I really hope they do fix Quentin though. 
---
With Laurie, I heard a rumor that Jaime Lee would’ve charged them a fortune for her likeness. So I doubt it’ll happen. The owners of Halloween let them put her and Michael in the game so they must be somewhat on board. Considering, Jaime Lee is still making Halloween films, you’d think they’d be more willing since the franchise is ongoing but I guess not. I was hoping for at least some Halloween (2019) skins but I won’t get my hopes up either.
---
Using your logic going back for the save when 3 could leave is sweaty doesn't matter how good of a survivor you are
---
Real gamers run insidious and protect the basement chest
---
This data, like all data, is an estimation of the reality, I don't expect it to be 100% accurate and representative of the game at all times, but it has way more value than your or my personal experiences anyway. Because we're drops in the ocean. I don't deny that maybe you had a very bad time recently, but if your 60% would be true, it's a statistical outlier, not representative of everyone's else experience.
---
You don't go from 6% to 60%. Maybe today it's more close to 12% full SWF at red ranks, maybe it's only 3%, we can't know for sure, but 60 is more than improbable.
---
Annoying, yes. Toxic, no. That guy was just being salty.
---
I showed you my knife plz respond.
---
they’re op bro of course people are going to abuse that
---
What does it matter when you can change your name on PC, honestly asking?
---
have you seen fungoose play as leatherface? he employs PWYF near perfectly and consistently does well
---
Ik but like it’s not even fun to play this game anymore
---
All the downvoted are legion mains
---
Its funny you say that because I find the most toxic survivors are actually killer mains lol. Oh, I just had a game with a hard patrolling and tunneling billy? Look who is in my next game as a fellow survivor...running DS (pre-nerf), adrenaline, and dead hard with a purple flashlight teabagging the killer all game...
---
That has happened on more than one occasion too lol. Its mind boggling but it makes you question which side of the fence is actually more inherently toxic.
---
Sweet Lord Jesus, this is a dumpster fire.
---
You mean remove him from the show? Idk you’d think he’d serve some jail time since it’s one of the medium-harder drugs. It’s certainly not as tame as weed.
---
What’s the record?
---
Literally the perfect video for it lmao
---
Don’t DC, that’ll ruin other people’s games. Just play as a killer you suck with for a few games. Let players farm if you find yourself still winning.
---
Ok so I’m scrolling through new subreddits THATS JOE KERRY AhaAg
---
Looks good! I would also say too much blood but fuck it, just go full P3.
---
Depends on what play style you like.  If stealth is your preference, Ghostface is a lot of fun to play as.  Pig might be the best stealth killer overall.  Myers is great as well, he’s like a freight train gaining speed over time.  You cannot go wrong with Freddy, he is very efficient and I win every game I play as him.  If you want a top tier killer, get Spirit, but she can take some time to learn.
---
Laughs in basement bubba
---
Simply bad survivors. You aren't winning against decent survivors with no perks or add ons as leatherface.
---
Thats why ds is a neccesity anymore if youre not doing Swf and/or youre in any other rank except white and red ranks
---
What does ggwp mean?
---
Killer main here, just gonna throw down some things that may or may not apply. I really hate playing spirit and nurse because I just feel bad doing it. I love playing weaker killers and that’s why I’ve dedicated hundreds of hours to piggy and wraith. If you want to not play against spirits and nurse, there’s really only one solution. It suck to say but - kill your friends. Try to find a good friend group (or if you know people) and coordinate a fun kyf session. Try out different things and hopefully it will get you back into the fun survivor groove.
---
Ah I see you also like having to run Iron Will every game too.
---
playing killer is very hard early on, the best tip I can give you is to not Rage/get tilted. If one survivors is tbagging or trying to get you to chase them I don't recommend chasing them. If they're trying to be chased they know how to loop.
---
also, you can record your gameplay and watch over it to check "what could i have done better" or have someone watch over to give you constructive criticism.
---
Yeah don't waste the perk slot on self care when you could use the perk slot for pharmacy and then search for a chest to heal, smh
---
I doubt they’ll be “free”. It’s most likely gonna be another event where you have to farm some special objective.
---
My pleasure mate.
---
I never watched the old ones but I personally enjoyed the ‘remake’. Don’t know if is any good compared to the old ones.
---
Make sure the game is on your internal hard drive as it runs better first of all.
---
Now just hold your power button down for 10 seconds or so until it shuts down. Then pull the plug to make sure there is no charge left in the machine. 
---
Then start it up again. That's all you can do to make sure this works.
---
I gotta try this
---
Maybe these shrines could be like libraries or books? The survivors learning how to repair generators would be pretty cool.
---
How the f*** do you manage to NOT look hideous after not sleeping for days?! 
---
Lmao this is a horror game
---
Killers not really op, the only thing that killers have higher ground on are the damn hit boxes but other than that it's pretty balanced like i say and a few youtubers too, you pipping is up to you (however i wish it was more setup to play smarter than to get rescues), but your survival is based off your team
---
I would honestly play less optimal killers if I didnt get dumpstered and taunted everytime I tried something new. This community needs to learn that it can't complain about facing nurse and spirit while bullying every wraith, trapper and clown they play against. Nothing wrong with winning. But that's not a license to be a cunt.
---
No Perks or Add Ons Wraith, stand in front of a gate, open gate when all gens are finished, repeat.
---
heres an update. tried adept Spirit. was 600 BP away from 2 pips. great
---
Enjoy being a sheep. And don’t call me honey, it’s disgusting.
---
Dbd is supposed to be a horror game after all, so I thought that if this was in the game, I'd be fucking terrified every time I get chased by a legion with that cosmetic
---
There are certainly more than two types of people in Hollywood. Simplifying things like that doesn't help to explain anything.
---
He’s supposed to look like Kyle Gallner full stop lmao and if I stay up for 24 hours, I don’t look like I’ve smoked heroin for 10 years. I may have some serious bags under my eyes but that’s why I said tired Kyle Gallner, who is relatively good looking despite movie makeup.
---
The same thing can be applied to survivors who have a bad solo game and then decide to do a four stack with their friends and body a wraith.
---
I remember when this game was fun. Now it's just a pissing contest between entitled twats.
---
Adam's height plus his fucking flat top make him stick out like a scarecrow straight outta rotten fields.
---
Yes, earned by competing a side objective during regular games
---
Last Year survivors had to interact with large tumor like growths in the ground that were for all intents and purposes just big totems
---
And Killers had to hook survivors on certain hooks
---
Looks great! I'd say it's too clean and bright of a white for the Huntress. Try and add imperfections in the white or give the appearance of the blood drying into the mask and staining it by making the blood darker and a bit more brownish.
---
Hopefully we'll get them back soon
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I currently play with my friends rank 3,12,16 I’m rank 5 so the killer we play automatically go to 2-3 since the update. We don’t have the motivation to play anymore because of this. Before the update they’d put a killer in the middle like around 7-9 but after this it’s only red ranks which is very boring.
---
and unrelenting + STBFL stacking, and that facecamping (like actual facecamping so you couldn't even physically unhook another survivor), or placing traps under hooks, and a bing bongless Wraith was ok too.
---
early DBD was a crazy time
---
Ash with the powerglove lol If they ever make an evil dead thing ever again, that needs to be a thing
---
It sucks for all sides. I do my best to be a fair killer, 99.99999% of the time I dont purposely camp or tunnel. I hate killers who do this.
---
oWo
---
The paint and fake blood was still drying at the time, once it’s dry I’ll show you it ok.
---
Depends on your play style.  Ghostface is an excellent stealth killer and a lot of fun to play as and against.  You can only stalk one at a time unlike Myers but the ability to go stealth at the drop of a hat is invaluable.
---
Freddy overall is a better killer if winning is your priority.  Still fun to play as, but he has little to no stealth.  His map control, pressure, and agility make him a fierce killer.
---
Sure
---
24 hours isn't anything. In the movie he went 3 days without sleep. So yeah, don't expect him to look drop dead gorgeous. This is Dead by Daylight, not a fashion show.
---
Ok good.
---
Same here buddy. Been sitting at 100% for 2 years. Getting new achievements on the chapter release feel like a dealer giving you another batch.
---
That being said, archives are coming in the next mid chapter patch, roughly in a month, so we will have new challenges to look forward to.
---
Original image?
---
What I meant is if they wiggle when they're the last one left, and they have no hope of actually escaping. Not gonna search for the hatch when you're making me stumble around.
---
i love nurses calling. so theres your answer :)
---
One of the few exceptions that would suck.  Luckily I've been playing since launch on console and we never had Legacy skins.  GG EZ
---
Not if the killer baits that too
---
Good game well played.
---
You would start asking that after they realize who the killer is like 20 seconds into the match, its not that youre just constantly asking who it is no matter who the killer is. You could easily just set up a system within your swf to point/wave if its you too. Plus Spine chill and Premonition would fuck them over hard
---
Perfect example is Angry Pug.
---
Thank u for your knowledge
---
Then mori offerings are never going away. Because if the devs removed everything you asked for the game would be dead, because the survivors would leave. Survivors like their crutches, even though they flame killers for them. I don't see "broken add ons" on killers going away either. Those are the only things that remind survivors who the power role is. Because these days survivors control the game unless you're playing Nurse/Spirit.
---
Anyways. I hope they would leave in cypress moris if this asinine idea of yours actually happened though. Since otherwise those animations they made were for nothing.
---
Yess please i need it aswell
---
Whoever asks what it says, don't tell. ;)

Of course it isn’t but as a normal human that’s about how long I’ve gone without sleep. The thing is, people with insomnia still don’t look like the love child of Freddy himself and the demogorgan. So my point still stands. I don’t expect him to look like a model, I expect him to look like a 16 year old version of Kyle Gallner when he was in the film. Perhaps a little more tired version. Cause what we have now looks like a dude who took a cheese grater to his face.

Yes, but it's easier now than it was earlier to get perks that you want
---
It's the fear or not being able to give their fallen comrade a proper burial but their corpse is still there so it's all good
---
the legion is pure cringe (fite me) from their backstory to their design to how they sound like they’re taking a massive shit when they leave feral frenzy, instead of a 2 player killer they gave us this lame Ghostface rip off, I would say they’re edgy and their parents think that it’s just a phase (and it is)
---
edgy
---
Other killers don't have .so pressuring abilities so they don't stand a chance at high ranks
---
Or just... yunno... their face modeling skills.
---
Don't ever feel bad for playing Doc! I got to red ranks as him awhile ago. Definitely one of my favorite killers.
---
DS post rework is not toxic and is easy to avoid its juet angry killers complaining
---
I got to red ranks as survivor!
---
YOU GOT THIS, JUST DO IT
---
Well I play like 5-6 games a day tops and most if not all of them are against Optimal SWF, I would unironically rather get mori'd then be genrushed because as a killer you pretty much have to commit to one chase and your punished for dropping chases
---
This has to be the worst recording I’ve ever seen. How hard is it just to use shadowplay or something?
---
something here doesn't look right to me, if that's correct you will need 15 medal points to get 2 pips which means 3 iridescent and 1 gold, but if I wanna double pip i need 16 medal points. Am i missing something here?
---
Could you please, pleeeeease do a full set of the patch stitched icons? or provide me with the files to do them all myself? &lt;3
---
Omfg this made my day
---
Asking for a source cause there are a lot of people who just spew out stuff they've heard. Especially when it comes to custom icons and bans caused by them.
---
This is the type of content I like to see
---
I'm not sure about this Viral marketing campaign for Halloween Kills.
---
I tried playing nurse on console and I’m trash. I don’t even know how I got adept nurse :(
---
If you experienced the DS you were already tunneling to begin with. Just sayin
---
I love the dying light rework. It applies over time and stops the obsession from being funneled into oblivion
---
Was watching tru3ta1ent today and i love the guy, one of my favorites, but he was playing a game of GF where someone was on the hook and every time he saw someone else go for the save he would turn back to try to get a free hit on the rescuer (nothing inherently wrong with this btw). But eventually it came to a point where he gave up an injured survivor right in front of him to run all the way back to the hook to get the free hit on the rescuer. He even still went after the person who was just unhooked and slugged them and *then* finally resumed other chases. A couple games later as survivor, a Demogorgon did almost the same thing to him, and he said he was a bad killer because he shouldn’t need to resort to hanging around the hook and slugging the guy off the unhook for an easy game.
---
I've been running a support build. I take we'll make it, prove thyself, borrowed time, and dead hard.
---
Your point doesn't stand! Because Quentin doesn't have insomnia! LMAO
---
That’s hilarious tbh, why would you open a random usb anyway it could be a virus lmao
---
But I'm pretty sure Aaron is in a 4 man swf, no0b3 only had vooshy with him.
---
I see the real ghostface back there corn stalking
---
All I'm going to say is that a quick google search of "Dead by daylight banned for custom icons" or "Dead by Daylight Custom icons ban" doesn't show me anything about huge drama or people being banned at all. It's the opposite.
---
Omg when I was 1 pip from rank 1, it took two days to get that one pip. Unpip, pip, unpip, pip, black pip, repeat over a billion matches wtf
---
Once I got rank 1, I didn't lose a single pip for like 20 games after that, not sure what changed
---
Full disclosure: I suck lmao. Much more comfortable around rank 10
---
The fact that Dwight is getting carried is so beautiful
---
I'm only 11 hours in to this game and still trying to get better at Daddy Myers. 
---
I appreciate all you friendly survivors I've encountered.
---
It gives you invulnerability for 60 seconds which is really strong, and can be super annoying for the killer under certain circumstances. It’s not toxic to use it though.
---
Pre-rework Freddy
---
It's the fuckin best when you get a killer that's real nice and chill in game and in the chat afterwards, makes my day
---
Amazon
---
Someone did an Oopsi.
---
It's just a couple Kyle's and Karen's that's all
---
Never said it was your responsibility, bud. No need to get defensive. All I did was ask for a source.
---
My guy, insomniacs stay up days at a time and they don’t look like DBD version of Quentin. Neither do people with narcolepsy. Doesn’t matter if he does or doesn’t, he’s staying up just as long as those people. Besides Nightmare on Elm St. is and has never been grounded in reality. It’s literally, horror movie logic. So I don’t see how saying Quentin doesn’t have insomnia but stays up just as long makes him look like an ogre makes any sense? He should look like Kyle Gallner, teenagers don’t look like how they made him look. It’s not even a close comparison, at least Laurie Strode looks like a normal human that could sorta look like Jaime Lee Curtis.

Yoinked that boi

---
That's some quality gameplay right there.
---
No, changing your icons and getting banned for it is about as unlikely as your plane crashing or having your kidneys stolen whilst you're sleeping.
---
Pretty much how it work lol
---
Depends on the region. Someone like Zubat in NA will tell you it's actually less than once in 100 games that he faces a group of 4 survivors good enough to only leave him with 1-2 kills (and in those cases he will just play even "dirtier", equip strong add-ons, let alone Moris or play Nurse, and still 4k with relative ease). Koreans and Russians on the other hand play pretty hard and thus face better survivors on average, but Russians are mixed in with the general European crowd, so Russian killers are actually particularly notorious for winning most of their matches (though they do camp/tunnel/slug hard, using strong add-ons and Moris, abusing the latency advantage). Strong Korean killers also win the majority of their matches, and that's despite the average Korean survivor they face being better and playing harder to win (if not significantly better in chases on average, at least less altruistic, more gen-focused, most of always using meta perks (4 DS is and always has been a common occurrence there)).
---
Again, there are numerous streams that showcase all this, with years of footage of regularly, sometimes daily, killer play, 3-4king at red ranks hours upon hours on end.
---
If not at least 3 survivors in a given match are good at the game, these killers will most likely win, even regardless of their character and loadout. And even against groups of 4 good survivors, things are not nearly as hopeless as people make them out to be, at all. Killers have strong stuff too, and good killer players will always be competitive. I'm currently watching a Russian tournament where some really good and even some of the best players are facing off, playing hard to get as many people out as possible, and even in the early stages of the tournament where killers are limited to characters like Clown and Wraith, games are not blow-outs by much of any stretch. 1ks are guaranteed, 2ks regular, and even 3-4ks not awfully seldom. There have been numerous of these tournaments in the past as well, with similar results. Survivors there do have some perk and item restrictions, but killers also some perk combo and add-on restrictions.
---
You could run Thana, Dying Light, Sloppy, and Nurses or BBQ for quite a bit of slowdown. This build really complements Plague or Legion. Either stab everyone in Frenzy or infect everyone with Plague and once you start getting Dying Light stacks gens won't get done ever.
---
Its really just a few dudes and dudettes trying to look hard
---
No, you can and should hit the guy that is 1 hit if they unhooked him right next to you. But still leave him on the ground and pursue the unhooker
---
Yeah that would really give you an unfair advantage and would kinda be p2w
---
55 seconds isn't very long. So yes or just wait a little to pick them up just to be sure?
---
Jup, with the next midchapter patch they are gonna add a battlepass called 'the rift'
---
Thank you, internet explorer
---
I just hate seeing People who think they are smart, when its clear that they are wrong here. Even 9 yo could tell what you meant. Also i like how he deleted comment :D
---
This man has transcended our mortal plane
---
Shitpost? This is art
---
no i just think she deserves a really good guy
---
They didn't. They baited the killer into grabbing them to use Decisive Strike.
---
I doubt anybody would buy it without the other benefits since most people already bought their cosmetics from the ingamestore
---
second wind instead of inner strength? mad man
---
Iridescent	Remove all 4 survivors from the game AND hook survivors more than 9 times
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8bvz68/emblems_explained_the_eli5_version/
---
Sounds like better pop goes the weasel. Probably a little to strong seeing as it makes 3 gen strats both easier to pull off and more punishing. I’m all for killers having more options to stall than ruin, but I don’t think this is it
---
ah, i see you are a man of culture aswell
---
Lol this is so cringey. The literal objective is to look for survivors how do you "pretend". you're conflating playing the game right and proxy camping.
---
Congrats on being a total dick?
---
He used deliverance you dope
---
How was I a dick? For trying to escape him? I didn’t even do anything in this clip that could be considered “toxic”
---
Wait wut? Since when?
---
Yeah.... I felt this on a spiritual level... I got bullied by a tryhard Nea and Quentin last night 😭 and basically every game I get bullied
---
Pretty good Job so far.
---
"You wanna help someone else on your team win a competitive game. that makes you a bad preson"
---
You get 10 points for hooking everyone at least once, you get 20 points for each sacrifice/mori, and you get 10 points for 9 hook actions. Medal is based on points, which you can see on the tracker.
---
"Bullying Baby Billy".....................
---
Nice.
---
It’s also called retaliation. I already was the bigger person for not messaging him afterwards. If you hit someone random in the streets, chances are high, they’ll hit you back. If a country attacks another country, guess what, they retaliate too. I’m not a toxic survivor, but I don’t mind returning the favor if someone tries to start shit with me first and especially for no reason. I’m not an idiot. At the end of the day, I’m a human being too and I’m allowed to react. If he was frustrated, sure, understandable. But I don’t play and exist just to be their personal punching bag. Especially not since I don’t BM.
---
GF has 0 movement ability while Gorgon can teleport around. The Gorgon is hurting himself by camping while gf is struggling to win and has to camp
---
He should get a small buff really.
---
Sure, and it's a good time to experience the game in a new way, regardless of whether it's extremely one sided. Use it as a chance to hone your skills and try to make it out against all odds. Attempt an all or nothing rescue. Die a glorious death and laugh it off. This is just as much a part of the game as more meta builds. You are not supposed to win every game and should welcome the occasional challenge.
---
You need to remember that when you make the decision to join a game in DBD, you might get one of those insanely hard games. And when you make the unilateral decision to DC, you ruin everyone else's chances at having fun.
---
Lmao when all of your comments are negative points 😂
---
The 16th iirc, according to datamining.
---
You sure it's not the 10000+ "how cool would a disguise killer" be posts? Because this is just a shitpost, hun.
---
*WUT IN SECRET GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTATION?!*

I just appreciate quality Memes bro, this could've been a good one but you screwed it up mate. Better luck next time.
---
Did “Play With Your Food” get a buff?
---
epic bruh moment
---
ok...?
---
Maybe Quentin's look is the side effect of all that zonorol (fictional drug in the movie he was perscribed for his insomnia) he'd been having with redbull. Also the adrenaline he injected into himself. That's a lot of drugs to have in kne night.
---
There is no winning with these people, I made it in about 20 seconds, next time read the caption for the joke and don't take it like it's a piece of art because memes aren't unless your some kind of edgy 14 year old.
---
At least those posts, while *very unoriginal and repetitive*, still relate to the game y'know? At this point I could make shitposts about the Thankskilling Turkey and get away with it. It's kinda bonkers.
---
&gt; my logic is god created
---
Wasn’t really supposed to be funny, just a clip from a game I had today. Unfortunately people are getting butthurt
---
I’ve got a few left but I’m working on them.
---
Self Unhooking, Hatch Closing and Gen Grabs seem simple enough.
---
Gotta grind to get the addons for Evil Incarnate.
---
Skilled Huntress is gonna be really hard considering my aim.
---
Still have no clue how Taking One for the Team works or how I have 162 points in it.
---
Had a random David DC for me one time when it was me and him left and we found hatch. I felt very conflicted in that situation
---
But the thing is there's an air of hype around pennywise being in the game right now, so it's relevant.
---
I believe it is from Norway, we have it as a tradition.
---
Did you even watch the video? He dc’d at the end, which is why I’m calling him a baby. I understand some people aren’t good, but that’s no excuse to dc.
---
Bill looks pretty good imo
---
Edgy but I like the idea and the story
---
Wait are you implying that Claudette heals faster than other survivors?
---
This is the exact opposite of what I would want from a battle pass.
---
The moment they start providing non-cosmetic benefits (bloodpoints, EXP, iridescent shards,etc) is the moment they start gutting normal rewards to compensate. 
---
It happens like clockwork. 
---
&gt; "With this new battlepass, you'll be earning 2x BP while it's active! To account for this sudden influx of bloodpoints across the playerbase, we've preemptively 'adjusted' BP gains for all actions in the game to make sure the Bloodpoint Economy stays healthy"
---
you just unhook people (preferably with borrowed time) and take a hit for them near the hook
---
Looks like one of the dinner time masks from House of 1000 Corpses. Looks great!
---
Right after you saw them, they knew they were done...
---
Lol budster why are you saying this for any other reason then to make fun of me for defeanding killers, im trying to reason and defeander my point but all people are doing is downvoting or making fun of me with no real argument
---
Legion after they run for 9 seconds.
---
I don't think they could do that since source is pretty old and unreal has different graphics
---
also the dbd bill has a larger beard I think
---
addons give you dream pallets but they are inexpensive in the bloodweb
---
Thanks! I’ve been told it’s to bloody but I worked really hard on it. Glad you like it
---
Would you please present to me a source from which I can come to understand this apparently humourous statement
---
Alright thanks are they common enough to where you can use them every game because it looks like the more interesting version to me
---
Aw, the classic League of Legends excuse. "I would be diamond if it weren't for my teammates keeping me in bronze 4."
---
I'm referring to when killers stay by the hook and continually loop around the area. Nothing wrong with checking the area when you suspect survivors are near. I'm making fun of people who stay close to the hook and wait for someone to go for the save.
---
Upvote for the stalky boi in the background
---
They could have been better killers if they stopped doing this
---
Looks fine to me!
---
This is why I hate DS/Borrowed. Not for their effects but because they encourage people to do dumb suicidal plays.
---
Snares are better in my opinion, but yes, it's incredibly easy to get dream pallets.
---
I wouldn't call double bp bonus beneficial, I guess it'll make you more likely to get the perks you want over someone who doesn't have it but  eh, doesn't really give you an actual edge over someone
---
Thanks
---
All i get are shirtless davids and the one meg who i never see finishing 4 gens in the span of 50 nanoseconds
---
Just finished a game as Myers with no add ons and got told kys cause I got 4k without camping or tunneling 🤷
---
Step 1) Grab the armpits  
---
Step 2) Butt rubs  
---
Step 3) Don't catch Plag dude.
---
relatable
---
Good, it’s for Halloween so it’s going to be darker, but I’m going to a costume party and wanted to stand out.
---
Double bp bonus will probably just be an archives thing
---
You know what’s also not fun to play against? 4 man swf with insta-heals/flashlights with Balanced Landing and other meta perks on Haddonfield. 
---
Whenever I play as someone other than Spirit, I get these tryhard teams that T-Bag and click their flashlights at me. If I don’t use Spirit, I stand virtually no chance at beating them
---
Maybe if people weren’t so sweaty at red ranks I would play as someone else
---
The screen jerk when you were unhooking shows how good they were
---
That’s why my dad never took us?! I always thought he wasn’t a real father. Now i know.
---
Yeah everyone forgets Bill is a licensed character too. He looks practically identical, except maybe the beard. 
---
He sounds like a sexual grandpa though.
---
Wait, so should I not cleanse at all or only cleanse when I’m broken?
---
You can't really aim Demogorgon's power well anyways, so no. He's fine on console.
---
Oh i knew about that but didn’t realize it was a battle pass. Unfortunate
---
witchhunting
---
I'm guessing it was your alt that made the original comment, cause damn, you are losing your shit entirely further down the comment chain here, ain't ya? *laughs*
---
First game I played as him, I got bullied by survivors flashlight clicking, teabagging, and rushing the gen I was literally 5 feet away from.  Couldn’t catch any of them.  Haven’t played him since.
---
However when I go up against Demogorgons, I always get stomped.  I think he’s a solid killer, perhaps a level below Freddy but higher than most others.  Definitely not the best though.  I think you have to invest the time to learn his abilities to the fullest an determine which perks he’s best with, then he can be lethal.
---
Myers ninja kicking the fuck out a generator.jpg
---
This made me laugh too hard. Lmao
---
His voice actor didn't die before Bill was put into the game. It was probably just a choice by BHVR to not get his original voice actor.
---
It's called get good.
---
I'm on xbox so i guess it really varies. Some days I will get fast ques but tyipcally i can expect a long wait
---
Well actually, if I were as sad as you that I needed an alt acc to defend pointless karma, I wouldn't waste time on you, I'd just spam *owo daddy myers, fuck my incel ass* on this sub for upvotes since it apparently pertains to the sub.
---
I'm pretty sure that's me actually :P
---
Add some hair on him and you basically have Quentin
---
"Lol I start every comment with Lol to hide the fact that I'm mad af"
---
Maybe if you didn't start your first comment with "Lol fuck you kid" people wouldn't be treating you like the circus act you are.
---
I play on console and use demogorgon often. I think that he is like huntress in the fact that you need to be able to aim and predict movements. Unlike huntress, I think he is decent (maybe even good) on console.  You have to get used to predicting movements in a chase to hit the attack and should know how long to charge it. You should patrol gens and as you go place your portals. Most survivors won’t seal portals as they see it as waste of time and it gives them the oblivious status effect for a while. It also alerts you to where they are.
---
They're not just bitching about losing. They're bitching about losing because they're forced to play with people they don't wanna play with. People who take this game way too seriously. All just because they happen to have enough matches where they do well.
---
Tru doesn't camp though. He'll occasionally patrol, but why wouldn't he? That's a fair strategy.
---
I can understand having a leave button and using it. Abusing it it's difference. If you disconnect 1/100 games, ok whatever, but if you're disconnecting in over 10% of your games...
---
Snares are superior, you can easily lock down the exit gates by placing a snare at each lever.  Stand an even distance between the two gates, and wait for it to trigger.  Make sure you place it perfectly or they’ll slip away.
---
Don't
---
Sorry I was a dick before, have a great rest of your day.
---
Should I Look back at them and point too?
---
No dude you get asthma
---
Insult Palpatine like this once again and I will cut a bitch
---
Lol fuck you kid that’s no excuse get a fucking argument u uncultured swine
---
Or you could cleanse totems. Just saying.
---
Adept Plague is the worst killer adept one I think. People DC like crazy against her, and it seems like she doesnt get many points in general. I had 5 games in a row with at least 1 DC; in one game 3 people DC'd within a minute.
---
Thanks! Now I don’t feel weird like I am a crazy hypersexual
---
Well the demogorgon imo is a mediorce killer in matches because his lunge is very effective if the survivors get stuck in non wide areas often or if they're going to a pallet,saving etc. for the portals you need the survivors to not hear them and find them and you need to manage them so you don't place them in soon to be dead zones neglected areas etc. He isn't bad it's just he's very odd I guess.
---
I wouldn't say any specific builds are good, but rather that different perks are different tools that all work to varying degrees on him
---
Make Your Choice is an obvious one, but SO good. It'll mean you'll be proxy-camping the hook with your tunnels, but good killers shouldn't worry about complaints anyways
---
Save The Best For Last is great on him - not only does it really help him, as an M1 killer, end chases faster, but he has the ability to attack the obsesion (via Shred) without losing stacks. I wouldn't pass up easy M1s on the obsession, but when you have the option, shredding them and keeping all your stacks is wonderful
---
Surveillance is fantastic. Sure, opened portals next to generators gives you a similar effect, but when you have someone lure you away from a generator only for their buddy to swoop in behind you and try to finish it, Surveillance catches them completely off guard
---
Part of the beauty of playing Demogorgon is how much your portals slow down the game. Freddy can force survivors to take the time to wake up, but that's pretty RNG-based and you have no control over when they fall asleep. Pig can force a survivor to completely ignore gens for a little while, but she only gets a few of this particular power, and it's once again RNG-based. Demogorgon, however, can force survivors to cleanse open portals that are near generators, or force them to always be sensed \*and\* give the killer a way to pop right up behind them. This cleansing takes time away from the survivor's objective, \*and\* can be repeated infinitely. Because of how much time this eats up, it can be really strong to add hex perks on the Demogorgon on top of that, just to give survivors \*another\* thing that they'll have to spend time on. So, long story short, any of the strong hex perks (Ruin, Devour Hope, Huntress' Lullaby, Haunted Grounds) take on additional strength when used by Demogorgon
---
These are some of the strongest perks specifically for Demogorgon, in my opinion, but any perks that are strong in general (Nurse's Calling, Whispers, BBQ, Rancor, and so on) are strong on Demogorgon
---
Just got the game today, played a few as survivor then one as killer. After a long no kill game one of the survivors messaged me gg, and gave me a few tips. They even went as far as to say that I did well and with a few improvements should be great. It felt good.
---
Dimmadoggon
---
Insidious wraith is best wraith
---
I gave a baby Dwight the hatch today!
---
Generally don't cleanse at all.
---
Coolest has to be Ghostface, with his floating robes.  He is such a chad.
---
Scariest is Demogorgon and his stressful as hell chase music.
---
Sure, I like pigs. I have ten little piggies at the bottom of my legs.
---
Ghost Face
---
Sneaky Killer AND Great Father. You can do both.

That’s the Myers house!

Who hurt you
---
Everyone complains about everything in this game. Don’t assume something is toxic just because someone says it is. They’re just being salty most of the time.
---
How does someone rank up
---
Lmaooo 'uncultured swine', am I back in 2012? If you were literate, you'd know that your 'argument' was already invalid. We were talking about killers who T-bag non-toxic survivors. 
---
Now, don't you have an actual audience to entertain?
---
Discordance is a perk that tells you when two or more people are working on a gen.
---
Every X amount of seconds, you get a notification that tells you they are working on that generator. At Tier 1, you get a notification every 8 seconds, at Tier 2 it’s every 10 seconds, and at Tier 3 it’s every 12 seconds.
---
Many people prefer to keep Discordance at Tier 1 since they get notifications more often, and thus are more accurate.
---
However, OP thinks that Discordance 2 is better than 1. I personally disagree
---
Can’t you be banned for using them though? I’m sure someone at bhvr said that
---
Edit: ok apparently I’m wrong
---
Dancing at the exit gates is always a joy at the end of a match I got smashed in haha!
---
I want the uncensored pic.
---
Exactly! Remember, NEVER cleanse! Thats just what she wants!
---
 ^(\*snickers in plague\*)
---
It’s so annoying
---
As a standalone movie, it’s okay, if you watch with the mentality “omg the original was better” then it’ll be tiresome to watch.  Of course a reboot’s not better than the original.
---
Yeah, that was new to me. I havent been playing her for a while, and then people are like "THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR PLAYING SPIRIT!"
---
when did this start? lol
---
Myers has had it for a long time, just not in his desc
---
So is urs 😂😂
---
Have fun! I have great respect for Hag players, as I find her extremely difficult to use.
---
This doesn’t even make sense. OP is implying someone got farmed and tunneled. Nobody said anything about suicidal plays but you.
---

He tunneled me ... and other survivors
---
Waait ... what? So you're saying he ignored everyone except you, but also ignored you and go for anyone else? ... 
---
What even is tunneling at this point
---
Like, i get it. You get unhooked, he finds you and choses to go after the injured one instead of the healthy one. Sure, i get it, "tunneling injured survivors, baaaaad killer" ... But like, ... what else? How can he tunnel on everyone? Lol
---
The thing is that Spirit is already very powerful without add-ons. So Prayer Beads seems like overkill to me.
---
I only use them when I’m going against SWF with insta-heals/flashlights
---
did you wait for it finish saving? sometime happen to me too
---
I reached rank 1 with plague. Was super fun
---
I mean, with RE being a massive mainstream name, now more than ever with the god damn masterpiece that was RE2 Remake, I feel like this new game has the potential to be a competitor in the genre

We sat in a lobby for about half an hour before closing the game.
---
Will check for that next time.
---
r/dbdgonewild is beginning the invasion
---
Lol fuck you kid. How about nobody T-bags and ya'll just enjoy the game how it's meant to be played, without acting like a labotomite? What you gonna cry on reddit till the devs remove crouching for survivors? 😂😂😂
---
Already in rising
---
If you like sneaking around, try running dark sense, empathy, or poised. I find these perks are underrated and can fit very well in a build.
---
Try dark sense and poised, with unbreakable and decisive so you can sneak but also survive when caught
---
Not with ten downvotes combined from the comments.
---
Thats why you always lunge
---
Whilst Universal were confused at first, after a bit of convincing by David Gordon Green they immediately tripled the exportation of Myers nudes.
---
You should try adding like a dark veil to the back to cover the rest of your head, might make it more spoopy!
---
As a spirit main, I think they're strong, but most killers have strong add ons. Mostly to counter the really strong stuff survivors have. In an ideal world where the killers didnt have or need add ons to beat the stuff survivors have and vice versa, I would completley agree.
---

Do they expect people to be that annoyed by notification spam? I remember they changed spies from the shadows for a similar reason.
---
Thats it, thats literally it when youre not running StBfL
---
Most cringy line in that movie imo but makes great meme material.
---
I’m personally not bothered by them. Especially since you want to interrupt them from finishing the gen
---
Yeah!
---
Oh! That’s part of the full costume, you should be able to find it if you go onto my account and look for it in the posts section. Thanks for the suggestion tho.
---
&gt;The only mori I trully hate is the tombstone.  Every time I run into a player using it I have not even been downed or hooked once before I am instantly dead.
---
Not necessarily. Perk builds and addons are so random in this game that you can literally encounter anything, especially with the skewered ranking system. You won't always encounter a sweaty five blink Nurse with BBQ and Ruin or an easy-mode baby Hag with Distressing.
---
Great. You get 1.25 totems to heal off of because each survivor brought in Inner Strength thinking the exact same thing you thought.
---
Now what?
---
N U T R I T I O N
---
A better question is why do you lose anything for your teammates or the killer DCing if you brought something in and someone DCs you shouldn't lose a pip or an item IMO
---
You get 1.25 heals because each survivor brought Inner Strength.
---
Buddy I don’t care if survivors t-bagged I just commented on a guy who called ghost face users cunts for t-bagging back, my argument is not at all aimed towards telling survivors to stop t-bagging I literally am just trying to say he’s being stupid because survivors t-bag all the time, none of you have a real argument against me, I commented on a guy crying on reddit about killers t-bagging and obviously u side with him so no i am not the one crying on reddit about t-bagging and I don’t want it taken out that would be very obvious if you looked at my previous comments and had a brain
---
Downvote doesn't mean angry.
---
I know there have been a lot of missteps with the franchise, and the term “C-Team” doesn’t exactly instill hope, but after RE2 exceeded my expectations, I’m hopeful for the franchise at the moment, and asymmetrical horror is a genre I’d love to see them tackle now
---
Level up new characters that you don’t usually play and master them, try new builds that are out of the meta and just make it fun
---
What perks and addons have you been running on him? I personally have found a lot of success pairing Thana, Sloppy, Dying Light, and Nurses, Ruin, or Pop Goes the Weasel in final slot.

Survivors t-bag on non toxic,non facecamping, non proxy camping, non exploit using, non ruin using, no iridescent head, not using any semi decent character  killer who didn’t do anything wrong, your just being a hypocrite(sry that was a lot of “non”’s but u survivor mains have a lot of rules for killers to follow)
---
after you hook the survivor and you know no one is there just leave the hook and go to a gen to find another survivor
---
Otzdarva has a really good video up showing the strengths of old Freddy and why with the right build and play style, he worked at high ranks.
---
I was hoping you would have the name of that old game Vanoss made which had a similar concept but nope. Pretty sure no one even remembers the name of that oldie.
---
this is the best post on this subreddit, shut it down
---
Okay maybe that was unnecessary
---
You can change the key bind. I see a lot of people change it to the scroll wheel, just scroll down the whole time
---
Least you still got the hook
---
There’s never been a single point within the lifespan of this game where Legion has existed as a healthy balanced killer. Please god BHVR give him the Freddy treatment
---
This hasn’t hit closer (piggy and wraith main)
---
Just bought him yeasterday and Have been playing him mostly, and except the first few Gen Rushs I have to say it very much is fun. A balanced Killer
---
Hah. I recognize the floor
---
Legion needs some serious buffs. Maybe an entire rework as his current kit just sucks balls.
---
Sometimes my friends and I like to go around 99ing hooks and sabotaging them when they killer is about to hook a survivor.
---
Borrowed Time, We’ll Make It, WGLF, Mettle of Man
---
And it would be way more fun if you ask me
---
What does Bone Clapper do again? I completely forget and can’t check rn.
---
Well no one asked
---
Also if you all wear identical outfits and either try to chase the killer or stand and stare at the killer, it can be pretty entertaining. It's just fun to try to scare the killer.
---
New skin BHVR. I’m waiting...
---
Sad thing u can’t do everything with him, with those billion teeth he has
---
literally exposing himself with T3 evil
---

---
So you want basically bare bones. No add ons. No perks. Just items and skill/luck.
---
I say we paint the town ~~red~~  some colourblind friendly colour with this message until they add modes for us.

If I was the doctor I would eat the ds
---
Lol tbh ur the only one being an unreasonable clown here 🤡 😂🤗😂🤣
---
“*Let me heal you, PLEASE!!!* **AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!**”
---
Now you just make me want a survivor susie(even if it’s just a reskin of another survivor as a cosmetic).
---
Removes the distance/directional cue of the bell
---
Ah, perfection.
---
I don't get it, how is it a bait? Unless using the perks above requires you to use left behind and do hack magic I don't see it.
---
I mean cleansing is a good option on certain maps but in general not really
---
Bubba really needs it.
---
Jojo
---
Ah. Forgot about that one. Would probably boost him to low-mid high tier(not quite nurse/spirit but not quite Doctor/Hag).
---
Camping is the right play if you can see scratches or another survivor around the hook or if all the gens are done. If you’re not in these scenarios it’ll actually be detrimental to camp. After a hook it’s best to try to find and down another survivor as fast as possible as that gives you hella pressure (one on hook, one down and 1 going for an unhook) which can win you the game. Perks like BBQ and Chill and Whispers can aid in finding another survivor quick.
---
What a gift to relish; a victim that can't perish
---
That just gave me a idea if for the perk: If a survivor gets moried the effect should still persist
---
Which sauce do you want, Mr.Dwight?
---
Id like the Kate/Plague video plz
---
Took the pic at Five Guys lol
---
Ghostface is too cute to be that scary like Mikel is. And badass? Hmm, I think clown because he is just evil and his laughing is just by far the best.
---
Ghostface. Stealth killers are great for making them scatter/scaring them. If you get demogorgon (I would for the perks if nothing else) he can get add ons that drop his terror radius when he teleports.
---
Losing connection always treats it like a DC, it pisses me off since I get de pip a lot because my game is glitched
---
What is gohan lol
---
sigh im new to reddit i couldnt do it put it there or something anyway pretty sure you will find the scene there
---
I could say the same about you making this comment.
---
I’m useless as Spirit, but I’ve 4ked with Beads and Mother Daughter ring. Literally feels like playing the tutorial.
---
Bumper billy is always just a fun time, it’s a great way to announce your presence!
---
When Hallowed Blight starts, there's gonna be so many Spirit's because of the skin she's getting. RIP
---
Nurse*
---
Yeah. I think it would be great personally. Not to replace the regular mode but definitely want it as like a second mode.
---
Prerework Legion hitting the air: Amateurs.
---
I play at around rank 4-6 and I have seen 2 nurses in about a month, idk if i'm getting lucky or something but it's majority spirit in my games
---
I mean, mori kinda
---
If it reaches that point, you’re not supposed to have a fair shot at escape, you had your fair chances, those are gone.
---
I can dig it.
---
So you're telling me that instead of 9/10 games being unfun spirit games it's going to be 10/10 unfun spirit games?
---
*Aai imma just end it now*
---
So you want to just play against Billy, nurse, and spirit and no one else. Okay, not me thank you.
---
Trapper keeps both sides of his weapon clean... right?
---
someone posted an idea earlier that i greatly liked its giving pepole stackable bloodpoint boost for leaving a perk or add on slot empty
---
Did they change her screams on the PTB?
---
i think you mean ‘rage quit’ - quitting a game because you’re angry/frustrated about it
---
Yes a fair shot when you’re being chased while your team opens the gate and leaves. Definitely fair. Oh yeah and when you can still loop em but they just wait for the timer to run out. “Fair chances”.
---
He meant rage quit. Just a typo
---
Darius mains weird champ
---
Bill's real easy since he's from another game.  That's right, he's a game character, they don't have any likeness bullshit to worry about.  Fuck, they coulda just ripped his model from Left 4 Dead if they wanted to.
---
How is this fair? they all 4 DC and he can barely safety pip if he were to hook them he wouldve gotten at least 2 pips
---
Please don't dc unless the killer is lag switching. It isn't fun for your teammates and you won't learn anything by doing that.
---
Not even that, Decisive Strike literally just says you can't be tunneled so the killer is just salty about not being able to tunnel the dude.
---
Those 4 are regretting failing P.E
---
Pig is one of the killers I have most fun playing as or against, however she's been nerfed too many times so if you're inexperienced with her past green ranks you're probably not gonna have fun. Freddy and Ghostface are other fun killers and are stronger than Pig and others. Demo and Leatherface are weaker killers, but you should get Leatherface for BBQ.  In the 2+ years since he's been released, it's only been in the shrine once.
---
I usually die even if I don’t cleanse cuz I can’t see shit with all the green puke on me 😞
---
That would be an interesting idea that I would definitely get behind
---
That’s your team fucking you. You stuck your neck out to loop the killer so they could open the gates and they abandoned you. You gave up your fair chance with the expectation that your team would return the favor, they didn’t. Don’t challenge the killer if you’re not prepared to lose, you can’t always rely on others
---
Thank you. I’m in public right now and can’t watch the video but i’ll see it once i’m home. At least i know what the issue is now.
---
For your first point, noed is not toxic at all. All the survivors have to do is break some dull totems. Furthermore, noed isn’t even a good perk in the long run. It doesn’t have the potential as some other perks such as ruin or nurses calling that can impact the game the entire game. As for your second question, if you hook a survivor, hen it’s generally a good idea to leave the area and apply pressure on another survivor or gen. If you know there is a survivor nearby after you hook, it is not toxic to search the area around it, just don’t stay for too long such as for the entire duration of first hook. Additionally, if you see that the team is generally altruistic (going for saves right after you hook them), it might be a good idea to stay there for a little bit. And for your last question generally do not go for the survivor who just got off hook, if you see 2 people, go for the one who unhooked and leave the injured on alone, however, if you only see the injured survivor, it is ok to kill them again, however be weary of decisive strike because literally everyone runs it these days, so it isn’t technically tunneling if you do it once or twice within one match (against different survivors). One tip I will give you is that do not face camp ever because that will make the toxic survivors even more toxic. Play nice and have fun because that is what DBD is about. Lastly, if you see a survivor constantly flashlight spamming and teabagging you in a game, MORI THAT BITCH, FACE CAMP THEM, SHOW ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING REMORSE TOWARDS THEM. Then once they die you can go on with your day.
---
Reminder: don’t make your post too long because most people don’t have the patience to read your entire post like me.
---
Have fun in your next games!!!
---
It's also perfect top prolong a chase, giving your team the time they need to complete generators.
---
Great.
---
Nurse’s Calling sees you all healing, and since you’re with your teammates Legion re-wounds you all before chasing one of you down.
---
What part of the combo did you cancel out?
---
Trying isn’t cool.
---
“Wait, who are you?”
---
“I’m you but with less psychotic tendencies.”
---
Bubba.  Leatherface should be one of the scariest killers in the game...afterall that's likely where the meat hook idea came from.
---
Clown needs to be deleted and replaced by Pennywise.
---
Overall I think the licensed killers should all be relevant.  They bring new players in.
---
Present yourself as less of a target. Position yourself near stronger loops, put others between you and the killer. Avoid detection all together. At the end of the day, if you got caught out, there is no one to blame but yourself., and if this is a common issue you have, you need to work on avoiding detection
---
It's actually hjőnk
---
It's worse when most people don't cleanse but there's one person who does and so they all get fucked
---
Edgy in the sense they’re fucking idiot teens. Badass in the fact they took down grown ass men and women as teens.
---
No. He only keeps left side of weapon clean (the side that is facing his other arm)
---
Oh yeah lol
---
Well you can’t spell nutrition without *NUT*
---
You’re not understanding the situation here bud... no matter the loop, all the killer has to do is match my movement so I can no longer go to a next spot unless the said killer breaks the pallet which they never do. So it just becomes a game of let’s play copy cat until the timer runs out.
---
nah he doesn't
---
Yea, I know the post the is long and not everyone will read, but that is alright.  The answers posted here were kind of what I was hoping to see.  I just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing thing wrongs.  I am not a toxic person in the slightest, but you can't escape it these days, so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't adding to it.
---
I'm tempted to say nurse keeps both sides clean since she wipes it as if you were swiping a credit card
---
Remember my face camping technique, if they are a scumbag DEMOLISH THEM
---
Lol same for me here except the getting stuck part happened at rank 4
---
*walking
---
You're assuming most of the community are sore losers. Well, I don't have much faith in survivors anymore, so maybe you're right. You've essentially set me up for a double win. On one hand, I am right, and the idea wouldn't work because most survivors I meet are shitheads, but on the other hand, I'd still be right, and that system being implemented would help people understand who they're going to be going up against, and they can shift their style from a fun game, to pulling prayer bead spirit.
---
Nah, I was Dwight. I don't remember anything else, as this happened at least a year ago
---
Drives me crazy, dude. I hate the posts that only relate to DbD because of the title. Those posts that you could crosspost to *several* other subreddits. Like, if the only thing relating it to DbD is the title, does it really belong on this sub?
---
Overcharge
---
For real, that's a big ol' dangly dong. I wanna know if it's a real dick
---
Ghost face is much scarier than he has any right to be. He’s from a comedy horror, for God’s sake! He always terrifies me when I’m survivor against him. Same with the Demo... but he just... everyone dies.
---
And if the timer is paused in this situation, guess what? I turns into Hatch Standoff v2, the very thing EGC was made to remove. And again, Avoid. Detection. You can’t be trapped if he doesn’t find you. Make someone else stick out their necks to open that gate if you’re so sick of losing endgame
---
Waaaah!
---
Keep it the same as it is for other killers (in terms of being inside survivors). Does nothing. You can phase into survivors as ghostface and myers when stalking, and then come out of stalking and be inside them. Doesn't really do much
---
What would be the point? Killer can only drag it out for 2 minutes.
---
Um, wrong Mikey perk my dood. Your thinking StBfL
---
True
---
👀
---
Oh, I hear you there... 
---
I currently have all teachables for killers already so I just have to get them all on my other killers since only my Pig and Spirit have them all purchased. Same thing for Survivor, only my Feng and Nea have everything. 
---
The grind’s always there.
---
It’s not much but it’s honest work. :P
---
What does this perk do?
---
gonna be a gen rush event lmao
---
He didn't walk in of his own accord. He died in another game series and the entity picked his soul. He's a guest character.
---
The sexiest one
---
Calm down dude. I just said that it probably doesn't need a nerf in retrospect. 
---
Can you at least be civil like the others?
---
I actually don't have this problem.
---
I said WAKE up of his own accord becuase he clearly takes his time getting up
---
I'm still sorta new so someone else please correct me if I'm wrong but I think 3 gen means you did every gen but 3, and those 3 are all close together which makes it really hard for you to complete the last gen.
---
is that a compliment cuz i deepfried it 3 times
---
Can't believe people want to pip.
---
What am I looking at?
---
Quentin doesn't have insomnia or narcolepsy. 
---
So he would look tired like his character in DBD if he hasn't slept in days. Relatives of mine with insomnia look fine because they take sleeping pills to ensure they get the required sleep. So saying people with insomnia don't look like Quentin isn't much of an argument. They get treatment for insomnia..
---
That's still better than a lot of players, at least you're trying to always do something
---
Rip Gennys
---
1 - NOED is a complicated perk. It rewards the Killer even if they do nothing. That being said, if you're having trouble, do bring it. I personally avoid using it as much as possible so I can improve. The other day I used it when playing Huntress because I can't aim at all lol. Use it all you want, but once you get better perks then replace it.
---
Also Legion is perfectly fine. They're one of the worst Killers at higher ranks (1-10) but besides that they're totally ok. Don't feel bad for playing a specific Killer
---
2 - That's perfectly ok! It can actually give you a lot of pressure on the Survivors. It's the Survivor's fault if you find them. I mean, you *are* supposed to kill them and stall them, so what gives? Only do it if you're sure there's a Survivor nearby, and don't waste too much time too
---
3 - Going after the unhooked person is usually seen as rude, and it makes sense. They're not being given the chance of playing the game! Imagine, you get hooked, wait one minute to get rescued, get saved, and 30 seconds later you're hooked again and have to wait another minute. ***However,*** if you see *both* Survivors (both the unhooked and the unhooker) make sure to go for the unhooker. You can also down the unhooked person, leave them on the ground and go chase after the other one. It gives you a lot of pressure and gets more kills!
---
There's no "wrong" way to play this game. There are a few broken perk combos and addon choices, but they're only on the killers Spirit, Nurse, Hillbilly and Huntress, which are all top tier.
---
Have fun, and sorry for the wall of text ❤
---
Also the walking is for the asking
---
Fucking every time man
---
This should’ve been the title
---
You try getting hooks when every survivor is running long life flashlights and disgusting knowledge of every loop and pallet on every map. We're expected, and forced to deal with that shit, you can deal with 3 more blinks.
---
wtf...
---
It’s when you have three gens close together making it easy for the killer to patrol them
---
There's a trap in the grass I think. I don't think it's that strong though because it's hugging a wall and survs could probably run past it
---
“What do you mean, I should get off this gen?”
---
I just want Laurie to look like Laurie :(
---
It's not like the killer knows where the hatch is either, you lost the draw.  Seem unfair, just remember that before, the hatch would only spawn if you as a team had managed to complete 2 gens.  Now you get your free chance of escape despite not having to do anything collectively as a team.  But sure, you need ANOTHER chance to escape, because god forbid the killer ever catches you in a bad position.
---
I am not big brain today
---
Are you new? There would be no standoff because killer can close the hatch.
---
Not big brain oof
---
Same, rank 2 and I’ve seen nurse 3 times in the 2 months I’ve been back.
---
I usually see spirit, billy or Freddy
---
Let’s say for a minute that the timer gets paused. I’m going to assume you’re injured or exposed because otherwise you can take your sprint burst and get away before EGC is relevant. You’re still at the pallet, getting tier 3 bloodlusted. You’re still going to lose that.
---
Can someone explain what Hallowed/Withered Blight is?  I’m new as of a couple months

You're always big brain in my eyes.
---
i was gonna say lithe + dance w me, those are my must haves! ive been using we'll make it + borrowed time lately too, to be extra efficient :)
---
Thank you person with big brain
---
I am not assuming anything. There are a ton of toxic players both Killers and survivors. I personally see more toxic killers than survivors although there plenty of toxic people on both ends.  You are more set up for a double fail than anything. That idea is ridiculous and the fact you can't see how it would be abused makes my point how you fail.
---
There's a reason so many killers run Ruin. Against a savvy team of survivors, it's the only thing that slows them down enough to get anything done.
---
Ask em anyway
---
This screenshot confuses me greatly and I don't like it
---
shes getting a buff soon, theyre giving her undetectable
---
Flip-Flop is pretty good, but situational.
---
That's right. That's me, baby.
---
Hatch Standoff in a metaphorical sense dude. Instead of the old days when you’d both stand on the hatch until someone moved first, you’d get trapped at a loop, same as before, and instead of waiting out the timer with you trapped at the loop, he’ll just wait until you give up, and god knows how long that’ll take. Hatch standoffs used to last for 10, 20 minutes sometimes, it was awful. Why bring that back when EGC fixes it? Just take your loss for getting caught out and move on
---
I don’t have a lot of perks on Ghostface so I can’t give you a 100% tested build but Shadowborn is useful since it gives more FOV so you can stalk survivors longer since they stay on your screen longer. Surge is good for stealth killers but that’s more hearsay. I personally like Surveillance on stealth killers because once you see a gen get touched you can just sneak back up to them. Depending on map, Surge and Surveillance work pretty well together. So I’d say for Ghostface go: Surveillance, Surge, Shadowborn, and Ruin. Ruin is good for just about any killer but it’s especially nice on Ghostface because he doesn’t have much map pressure so he’ll need help slowing down the gens.
---
I thought something cool was going to happen. He didn't even really have a chance... Not sure why you posted this tbh
---
To me, all male and all female voices sound the same to me. Jeff is an exception to that
---
Oh muh gerd  just kill em!!
---
There is a huge patch of land you can do that with near main building
---
Ace must loot everything even the basement before he leaves.
---
I believe there's a theory that states that the reason the gates get powered is because the generators produce light when they finish, and this light makes the entity's grasp on the trial weaker, allowing for escape (the entity is shown to be weaker to light, I believe one example of it is the fact that killers get stunned by flashlights so badly.) Idk but that could explain it.
---
I like this
---
To me they're all drastically different. The human mind is crazy, isn't it.
---
and a premise that writes itself and allows for lazy writing when it comes to lore and game mechanics!
---
Im still new to Demo but I've been placing them next to gens. It kinda sucks that you can't get rid of portals so I think next to generators makes the most since. Sometimes I'll put on in the middle of the map too for travel purposes
---
Fuck my hole
---
Umbra on Twitch does these kind of shots all the time.
---
Damn dude, so we need a team of flashlights and I think we can just win
---
I am by no means a master at this game and I'm usually around a t11 killer. What I've been doing is setting them near the first gen I come to but in an innocuous place. Then place the next one around the same placement and warp back to the first. Check that one then go the opposite direction. And place them Inbetween Ect.
---
No, the person who farmed you is a prick. If the killer sees a full up person and an injured person why would he they hinder their own game to reward a bad play?
---
Don’t know why but those little sound bytes he adds always get me laughing
---
What? I wasn’t talking to you I liked the vid the killer main who was being toxic in the comments is who I was talking to his name was al-names taken or something like that.
---
Thank you all so much for the support! It really meant a lot to me that so many people were rooting for me! I’m happy to say that I have hit Rank 1!

---
Thank you so much, that's so sweet ❤️❤️
---
It depends on how you want to play demo. 
---
You can place them in the open, hoping survivors take bait and want to close them, taking time off gens (less reliable).
---
You can place them next to gens, specifically ones with progress, regress them, then monitor if anyone is on them (if the placement is good, they might be forced to deal with no terror radius too) (id say the most reliable, consistent tactic)
---
You can place them out of plain sight, using your portals to get the jump on survs repairing generators, you might even manage to get a pull if you're really lucky (kinda reliable? Not sure)
---
Also generally speaking, put one next to your totems to protect them well.
---
Good job, fellow red ranker, good luck with your future matches
---
Hahaha thanks so much 😂❤️
---
I know right ;)
---
Like a lot of people said, start monitoring gens. I don't play killer, but I watch a lot of YouTube videos to try and learn and every good killer monitors gens.
---
He probably plays both sides so he understands when situations suck. Not everybody is one sided
---
Honestly enjoy playing legion and don’t mind playing against him/her
---
Can you explain the no terror radius?
---
“Since she heals faster” what did you mean by that part? You can’t be talking about self care, because self care is the slowest heal in the game, and many regard it as a detrimental perk
---
Maybe 4 odd bulbs can trump the entity if shined in the correct place.
---
Exactly. Natalia Dyer has a really awesome unique look, modeling her would be REALLY hard for anyone, I think they did an amazing job, but to each their own :)
---
yeah that was my plan but the survivors spawned on my ruin that match and thx for some advice.
---
Because it should never be this easy to win a gate standoff. Besides, I don't want to exploit the game for a cheap win. I wanna work for it.
---
That is the dumbest thing I have ever read. Good strategies can absolutely including adapting to and  maximizing on other people's mistakes.
---
Just play how you want. Use noed if you want to, because being nice in this game gets you nowhere. When I play the nice killer and not tunnel, people teabag me at the gates when I could easily have gotten 4K with injured survivors running into me straight off the hook. I used to make it a point that if injured survivor runs away and healthy survivor runs toward me I just hit the healthy one, but nowadays if I see P3 claudettes with flashlights teabagging or flashlight clicking at pallets, I just tunnel survivors and usually get to EGC with 1 or 2 left then get them with noed. I mean, if you play toxic, why complain?
---
Save that for r/dbdgonewild
---
Sacrifice the Dwight to reveal the entity, then shine bright like a diamond, or in this case an odd bulb?
---
But that’s just a theory, a theory theory
---
because some People see the whole game
---
Just happened to me like 30mins ago
---
I notice it for like 3 seconds at the start of a match but then instantly forget about it
---
It's a fully programmed perk that's in the game files, but can only be accessed by hacking. So if they have any record of a player using it (which they have the capability to do, they've shown perk usage stats), it's a no-questions way of knowing the player has hacked their game, which is an easy ban.
---
Edit: I said Left Behind, rather than Last Standing. Now I understand the confusion
---
It sucks
---
People will say many things are unfair. But generally, and realistically:
---
1. All perks are fair game. Some are annoying to play against, but you are not at obligation to avoid them.
---
2. ‘Camping’ (when you guard a hooked survivor) whether or not you have insidious, is a fair strat, but is actually not optimal if you’re trying to get more points. You’ll miss out on chase points while puppy guarding your pray, generators will get done because you aren’t applying pressure, and other things. You sacrifice both fun and points to do this.
---
3. ‘Tunneling’ (when you target a single survivor over and over again, until they die, refusing to change target) is a fair strat but honestly kills the fun for the survivor. It also isn’t really optimal for you, because you’d be ignoring the benefit of chasing the saviour rather than the unhooked survivor; the unhooked survivor will go try and get healed, stopping them from doing gens, and possibly busying another survivor. If you tunnel, you may get a kill faster, but the rest of the team will get the objective done without any pressure. That’s essentially what you pay for that strat. (Side note: if you want to punish someone for unhooking in your face, you can always hit the unhooked person, and chase the rescuer. This will cause the rest of the team to spend time saving them, and get you brutality points.)
---
3. ‘OP Builds’ (combo of perks and add ons that are crazy powerful) nothing is perfectly balanced. If you’re Huntress, and you have a oneshotting axe add on (iridescent head), thats fair game. That add on is very rare. People may call you toxic for using certain builds, and some of these are very brutal against survivors, and not much fun. But it’s your choice how you want to play. If you agree the build you use is too powerful, you can always change it.
---
Looking for someone isn’t camping, but you won’t be able to lure out a saviour if you stick too close.
---
I’m not a rank 1 killer or anything, but these are my views.
---
Well no one survivor is the best, everyone has their own opinion ror what is the best
---
Jeff and his man-a-licious beard
---
Dont think so. Everything in the trail is the entity. So even the gates powering is just done by the entities choice
---
When a survivor is standing over an active demogorgon portal, they suffer the "oblivious" status effect. This effect makes it to where they hear no terror radius and don't go under the effect of terror radius perks like overwhelming presence.
---
Additionally, when demogorgon uses a portal and crawls out of the portal, demogorgon gets the "undetectable" status effect for a short time, which suppresses the terror radius, hides the red stain, and makes them immune to aura detecting abilities like dark sense and object of obsession.
---
kate has the most smexy
---
Flashlights are so easy to deal with. If you’re still getting hit with a flashlight while picking up a survivor you’re just not very good at killer 😂
---
Apart from the better medkit healing speed, healing your self using self-care is faster when being a claudette rather than another survivor am I right? PS, sorry for the shit post I was clearly high when typing the thing out
---
Well, you're fun, killed the mood
---
I need said slugging but DC means disconnect it’s just the abbreviation for what people call it in game.
---
I play both sides too. The last Survivor would also not mind if the gates are really far away from each other. That's just RNG. Sometimes you will get favorable gates and sometimes you have no chance to kill the last survivor or escape as a survivor.
---
Sometimes you're just unlucky, yeah. Goodluck on your next trials though!
---
I would try to recreate Left 4 Dead maps in DbD if a mapping tool was added.
---
I’m looking for straight opinions here, I’m interested in what people think about it, also happy cake day!!! :D
---
Now I must say he does have a very CHONKY beard
---
Thanks! Wow I've been playing Demo and had no idea. That is very helpful. I still have yet to play against him so I'm not sure how survivors see him
---
I’m a micheal main and this is 101% accurate it’s sad
---
But what about Jane
---
No, self care is the same speed for everyone. It’s painfully slow and you’re better off not running it and finding a teammate to heal you or using a medkit. There is absolutely no difference between any survivors stat-wise, they’re just skins
---
Not chunky T H I C C
---
Well my opinion is ace since he is as you said quiet and his skills let him help his teamates
---
Anyone know the clip where this is originally from? Im guessing a stranger things livestream but I'd like a timestamp if possible
---
insta billy chainsaw addon? maybe
---
4... Frank Morrison/Julie/Susie/Joey 
---
also Legion was first
---
Sad thing is almost no-one mains Jeff 😪
---
There is no person that wouldn’t run it
---
Some people speculate vigo and Benedict baker (more so vigo) somehow managed to cheat the system in some way, being able to create things in the entity's realm like the hatch, if that was true, then it would explain the exit gates as well. It also explains why vigos jar of salty lips somehow controls "luck"
---
Yeah but then again his face is pretty horrific up close
---
Aye it’s a sad and lonely life once I found out I might be the only P350 Jeff in the universe
---
But then youd be down a man and you couldn't use 4 odd bulbs
---
You could actually do that. It was a glitch and it was pretty broken and BS. No fun for the killer.
---
We all know that, but you asked him why would he care if he was killer.
---
Left 4 dead Bill is much thinner than DBD Bill, they CHONKED him
---
I got stuck levelling up detective tapp somehow, wish I could have the man himself as my main
---
oh wow I didnt know that, so every survivors three perks are the same like base, for every survivor. Thanksss matteee and sorry for shit post 😂
---
I think I'd still prefer lithe or balanced landing. Imo
---
Freddy and pig are strong killers. Ghostface is if you practice with him. Bubba is one of the weaker killers, so he’ll be harder to get kills with.
---
For each survivor injured, downed or hooked, every survivors get a 4% action speed decrease for Healing, Repairing and Sabotaging.
---
Thanks, good to know. Was this all on killer? I play both and my main concern was hearing that skill checks were laggy while docked, and that would probably throw me off going between PC and Switch
---
It’s all good guy. Just remember that once you unlock all the teachables, every survivor has the same stats, so it makes no difference who you play as long as you have perks you want
---
Also the longer you charge "of the abyss" the bigger your pounce is. If you press it and then use it immediately after, your pounce will be shorter. If you charge it for a tiny bit (id say somewhere around the duration of demogorgons hisss) it'll be  bigger. I didn't know that first playing demo, so maybe they'll help too.
---
Itd be completely busted.
---
yeah why would he if the RNG was in his favor? I agree that those gates are kinda bad. The devs should work on the overall RNG of the game or get rid of it.
---
The clap of her ass keeps alearting the killer
---
Couldn’t tell you. One sentence
---
“—PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR-“
---
Look up dbd survivor strat roulette. If you don't know what that is it'll give you random ways to play a match eg. All survivors must travel in a line and cannot leave
---
Yea you’re right! It’s especially tough on maps like Azarov’s Resting Place and Suffocation Pit.  So a good strategy is to space out the gens you work on.
---
A new challenger approaches
---
But killers are more likely to let a Jane live
---
Not gonna lie that was funny as fuck to watch. That would frustrate the crap out of me though. Killer probably has bad connection.
---
Needs more blood
---
Oh! It could also be because your PC doesn’t meet the minimum specs. But you would probs be having crashes too if that were the case
---
Because hes allowed to care if he wants to
---
Infinite T3 and NOED, why? x)
---
basically nothing
---
He's prett, i dont know what you mean.
---
Is it that guy from dbdgonewild? :p
---
AARGHHH
---
I still barely understand how she works. I just know to not cleanse or else she is more op than normal.
---
I’m currently rank 16 killer on the switch and rank 17 survivor so I’ve played both 
---
While docked the skill checks have some input lag, however it’s very easy to account for it. I’m also sure it’ll be fixed in the next path on switch. I usually play killer docked, so haven’t really noticed other than a couple of games just to complete any survivor rituals I receive
---
Hope this helps, it is 100% worth it
---
Something about his eyes..... I don’t know but it cares me
---
I posted it because he would’ve insta downed me
---
i tried that but my wheel doesnt unlock and stops the second i stop moving it and i die
---
FF duration is 10 seconds
---
get rid of noed... seriously...
---
and with that add on you dont need Save the best for Last.
---
For a second there it looked like the Trapper was jumping though the hatch like "Bye bitch"
---
K got it, my mom said tomorrow after school we can out some red paint on it.
---
It's just frustrating. At this point nothing is scary it's just a fun game why do we have to do stuff for immersion?
---
Monto when he hits someone as killer:
---
My internet seems to cut out if they slug me for the 4K and the other survivor is on the hatch. :/
---
Crossplay between Consoles, not pc, they can stay in their own realm
---
Oh yeah. Mine unlocks and can scroll for a while but I still haven't tried it
---
Actually i'd have to completely disagree. The amount of hate killers get because we're pulling a certain perk or build someone doesn't like is astounding. I've had survivors DC and shit talk me for using Ivory Moris. I played doc once, first time playing him expecting to lose, the 4 stack DCs the second they see who I am. I've had survivors bitch and moan because I let a default Dwight have hatch, or because a chase lasted slightly longer than usual. Survivors love pulling out the "camp and tunnel" Cards when they lose. I've had a rank 9 say I only won because a face camped them, even though I never camped anyone, since I was running a BBQ and Devour build, and it would be fucking stupid for me to waste those perks by camping. Survivors aren't just toxic to killers, they're toxic to each other. I saw a clip where survivors were streaming, got out up against a bigger streamer who played nurse, and lost. He plays survivor, gets put with them, and they body block and refuse to unhook him, laughing the entire time because "oh, he camped and tunneled us last game chat." despite him having streamed that game. I'm slowly losing faith that any survivor is worth sending a legitimate GG. When I first bought the game, I did it because I wanted to play as Leatherface, since I love the first few movies. My friend literally told me not to main killer because playing against survivors wasn't fair. 
---
In any case, either I'm right, because most everyone is fun hating toxic little shits who'd abuse a system that only shows what other people have rated them by giving them a reputation level, or I'm right that the system would help us assess how hard we need to try so we don't go fucking dummy on people who are all around decent and just want to have fun.
---
Imagine getting downvoted for telling the truth.
---
Yeah but how fun is it to yoink people off a gen.
---
(Of course its hella unfair)
---
So you not going to mention how fucking chubby in the face Ash looks?
---
Replace the legion pin with iri pin and swap stbfl with that one clown perk that slows healing and you’re having fun
---
The fucking Claudette main in the corner
---
Noed is a weak perk you should find an alternative for, and you don’t really need STBFL considering your add-ons
---
Noed is only good in the jumpscare build. (scratched mirror and boyfriend memo)
---
Save the best for last and play with your food don't work well together.
---
If you are looking for a tier 3 build you should try to get bamboozle / fire on, monitor and abuse and infectious fright.
---
here are my galaxy offerings! please let me know if i made a mistake in the rarities of the offerings so i can fix it immediately! enjoy &lt;3

---
Why don't they work together?
---
If you want I'll upload a pic of it to show you the paintwork and stuff. Making this stuff isn't easy :)
---
Edit: I replied to the wrong comment....
---
I laughed sooooo hard
---
you 36 seconds on a gen will get more gen progress than you with someone else on a gen for 18 seconds. 
---
The smartest thing to do, numbers wise, is to self-care yourself while your healthy teammate is on the gen. If you dont heal, sure you get faster gen speed, but then youll go down in 20 seconds and your teammates only got 20%. If you had self-cared, you could have gotten 50 seconds out of the chase and your teammates would have gotten 30 more seconds on their gens. So by self-caring for 36 seconds you essentially got 90 seconds out of it
---
The totem idea is fricking incredible. No more Ruin popped at the beginning of the game when it shouldn't be that way anyway 😍
---
Well Perma-T3 is obviously powerful, and it is typically smart to stack it with an add-on that increases stalk, but it’s not something you’ll be able to use often for obvious reasons
---
So cute , great art!
---
Does it stack? If a person gets hurt and then gets hooked is there an 8 percent decrease
---
Its still in the game files though, so hackers that hack their perks could actually have it. This could be real and recent.
---
So honest question, why do people hope in lockers for DS, it that just to help them hit the skill check, or just put the killer in a longer animation, or is it something else
---
I'd get rid of save the best for last  and noed with the tuft of hair.  People are already going down with one hit here, so its not like you need the recovery that much.  Really what we need to see are your perk options. Ruin would be a big help as gens are going to fly with no early pressure.
---
Alternatively,  get rid of the tuft of hair (its not sustainable over multiple dozen games) and swap out play with your food for something like dead rabit and nurses calling.  In this case you could keep the noed (even on myers) so that when 1 gen is left you 99% ew3 to use when you have someone hooked and noed is broken before the save.
---
I didn't get your first suggestion. All killers should be able to teleport like Freddy is?
---
I liked your way to counter 20s destroyed ruin every game lol. Also I think 1 totem is too less to destroy such an easy countrred perk at high ranks but so powerful for killers. There's should be like 2 totems connected to ruin and both should be destroyed.
---
If you want I can upload a picture of mine as well as my legion mask to show you the paintwork and stuff, making this stuff isn't easy :)
---
I'll link my available perks thanks
---
Just blind the next nea you get in your match and see what happens
---
Wake me up inside
---
I'd say swap PWYF for Ruin if you have it unless you plan to swap the memorial out for a tombstone (and even then that makes all the other perks you have worthless since you won't be hooking anyone or hitting anyone). Also, I'm assuming you're running NOED for the extra speed since with infinite tier 3 the exposed effect is worthless. Either keep it for the speed or maybe switch it out for something like Enduring? I wanna avoid just recommending the standard m1 killer build but in my experience it works alright with infinite tier 3. STBFL is just a timesaver when you have a permanent instadown, you could maybe try Insidious camping if you're feeling extra scummy. My normal build is Ruin, BBQ, Thrilling Tremors and Enduring (formerly Iron Grasp). Good for swinging through pallets in tier 3 and getting a little extra information every so often.
---
I saw someone suggest something similar. Each of the 4 members would have a unique attribute that was enhanced, and you use a locker of something to change mid match which legion member you are
---
Some things you can do
---
Perk wheels: find an app for either killer or survivor and play the character you have the most perks on. Spin the wheel/click a button, and it'll tell you 4 perks to run at random. Equip those perks. You can get stuck with something like no mither, self care, deja vu and this is not happening, or you can get a full on meta build. It's fun to test your luck!
---
Change your builds: why always go meta?  Like you said. Test yourself, test new builds, might find a new favorite perk, maybe a new build even. 
---
For killer, play different killers. Play someone you may not always play, you might find your next main. 
---
Meme. If you're in a 4 man swf, might as well meme. Cult of dwights is fun. Maybe have a basement party even.
---
Grind. And I don't mean by farming your teammates off the hook. I mean just grind. Some people really like seeing their bloodpoints rack up.
---
I would love that actually! I love seeing other people’s work, and I like to take the ideas and try and improve my mask, and or costume.
---
Nothin, just hanging out
---
Thats not how any perk that buffs speed works. Action speed such as repairing healing sabotageing, mending, mabey vault speed, but definitely NOT movement speed.
---

---
To me I think they both look soooo much better on hooks!
---
That is so cool
---
Did you know? The original micheal myers mask from the original halloween movie was actually a 1967 star trek mask of captain kirk? All they did was paint it white lol
---
Yeah I get you man but giving up is akin to acceptance for me, even if it’s a 0.001% chance of them listening to community feedback it’s still a chance to me :D
---
Just chainsaw everywhere?
---
Are YOU new? Killer couldn't close the hatch before and thats why it would be standoff 2.0
---
Have you seen tournaments in the past? It would always be nurses and P3 Claudettes. That mode would die in new
---
I don't have many perks so I'll try to get something like ruin or monitor and abuse. I just feel like these are the best perks I have atm to use. I linked all my perks for myers if you wanna take a look.
---
Lol yeah it’s such a waste of a perk slot. I get it’s powerful but I’ve had survivor games I e literally spawned next to the totem, Like where’s the fairness in that?
---
Claudette. Pretty average grunts and groans but her invisibility is unmatched by any other counter. She's also the third smallest I believe.
---
The other day I slugged for a 4K on Yamaoka (I only slug if I really want a merciless or if they're toxic don't @ me) and I kid you not; she revived them three times and it took me 20 minutes just to spot that one bloody Claudette. Her green shirt probably helped the map too lol
---
Yeah, I've got time.
---
Get outplayed
---
Freddy's swing is just as normal as everyone else. His claws are so small it just looks like he has longswords on his fingers.
---
I became a trusted forum user and learned how to flashlight save (I've always been so scared to try XD)
---
Horrible ideas. I swear this sub is filled with killer mains who want spoon fed 4K’s every game.
---
Please don't nerf my spirit.
---
Try to work for it at coldwin farm against 4 rank 1 survivors infinite jungle gyms, safe pallets and loops. Yea I'm seeing survivor giving up and let you win bc that map is just broken and they feel bad for You. NOT
---
I've been countering that by putting on Haunted in hopes that they pop that first and delays my Ruin getting popped because let's be honest, who actually has the balls to pop a Hex whilst exposed?
---
Yes! Gen teleporting for most killers would remove some of the limitations placed upon them and see a wider range of killers used at high ranks imo. 
---
Thanks man :D it’s not a perfect fix but it’s a start, being able to rebound a hex to dull totems is another idea I’d say, but countered by simply following the killer hence why I went with the timer :P
---
I’m on Xbox as well. I’m just sayin I saw a streamer close hatch at the same time as the survivor jumping in and they escaped but it still closed
---
Yeah! I’ve seen pictures of some unpainted and it’s even creepier lmao
---
Plague has her standard green vomit (vile purge). When that gets on you (being vomited on, touching infected items (pallets, windows, gens) or unhooking infected survivors) after a period of time of being infected you will enter the broken state and be able to be downed next hit.
---
Around the map are cleansing altars, cleansing removes infection but currupts the pool. When the plague drinks from that the vile purge becomes corrupt purge for a period of time. Instead of infecting people the purge now hits people, like an attack would. It can put people in the dying state. Corrupt purge is red. You will know a fountain is corrupt because it too will be filled with red liquid.
---
The plague does have add ons that allow the game to begin with a corrupted fountain and an iridescent add on that corrupts a fountain after each gen is complete. Other than those add ons if you don't cleanse you won't corrupt
---
Would monitor and abuse be a good alternative?
---
This is so true that it makes me sick.
---
It should be changed to the ultra rare and father's glasses should take purple.
---
