I waited cause he know we were all down there. I knew as soon as he grabbed someone else I would get a free escape and it would've been my first hook so I was willing to take one for the team.

Oh god that end scene made me not want to sleep. The music + atmosphere was eery as shit

Oh my god, that is awesome! Did you make it out of paper mache? It looks like that
---
Bro that shits huge
---
&gt; Doing the gens in the middle first, so you aren‚Äôt stuck with them when there are fewest survivors.
---

---
Pretty sure anyone past rank 15~ does this. They may still 3 gen themselves, but the middle one is usually done in the first 3 gens.

Thanks alot, I'll probably grind this game till I get 9000 shards and I'll get either Ruin or Monitor and Abuse.
---
What? The voices are NOTHING alike.
---
Accurate
---
on xbox im rank 5 and have only played against 1 spirit, is that normal until i hit red ranks or maybe its not so bad on console? idk
---
nvm just got a spirit game F i cursed myself
---
You seriously need anger management before you hurt someone else this shit is not normal yo.
---
Who needs iron will when you‚Äôre jesus? Also i‚Äôm not an immersed noob so idc
---
Isn't that a fan art?dude that's awesome
---
Slippery Meat too.
---
Trapper is the only killer where ruin is not a crutch perk PogChamp
---
I'm not saying you don't have a point there. I just can't stand that everyone is taking theirs hats at your post etc but no one gives a damn to that super unbalanced map. A good rank 1 survivor can loop you literally for the whole game, swinging from pallet to pallet, jungle gym to safe loop etc even if your trying your best and do not make 1 single mistake. And if you say something about it, your just a loser and an Ez Baby killer blaming the map. At least you made something, there, you killed the other 3 survivors, they were the ones who failed. If they managed to do all the gens, maybe they could get away.
---
Only use instasaw
---
Someday I'll get to green, maybe purple ranks as a huntress main on console
---
I don't expect to get higher than that, but I really wanna get there
---
Also If I have 2 obsession perks will 1 survivor be the obsession?
---
Yup my first rank 1 was a year ago with Doc. Games changed a lot since though.
---
U forgot , DO DAMN THE GENERATORS, AND STOP LOOKING FOR RUIN. IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO HIT A GREAT SKILL CHECK. 
---
Even if u don't get a great skill check, Get off the gen for 2 seconds when there's a spark. You still trigger more skill checks while not making progress.
---
(Best done if you do it alone, then with someone messing up)
---
Okay that makes a bit more sense. Still seems super broken.
---
Honestly the two switches should never be visible at the same time. I can live with that distance with patrolling still able to make it but visibility is dumb same thing with the spawning same wall on lampkin lane.
---
I put one on my ruin and thrill, one in killer shack and/or basement, and one in the main building of whatever map

From the void she kills is one of those achievments that if you are trying to get it on purpose you basically need to be farming with survivors and have them sit on a gen while you blink around them

Incoming "you've been playing for x hours and you just now hit rank one?" But forreal though congrats man.
---
congratulations!
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and this is probably why but i‚Äôm rank 5 and the red ranks on ps4 are absolute SHIT players. They play worse than green and yellow ranks imo and they are just overall potatoes.

People make memes about this but my friend asked my why the vomit was hurting him instead of getting him sick and he was cleansing the minute he touched anything green. God bless his heart but it was a tough game with her always having corrupt purge and him and my other friend filling the fountains up so much that she'd get corrupt just from all being full.
---
Only between consoles. Im not going up against pc people on xbox, if i wanted that id play siege
---
Nancy cause her perks are awesome
---
Depends on how you wanna play. If you wanna stay in tier one and be super sneaky the whole game, then dont get into chases. Just jump out, hit, run away, repeat. If you wanna stalk as fast as possible and get to tier 3 as fast as possible, then stalk from a distance so the survivors dont notice you. Once youre in tier 3, go all out aggressive on their asses. If you can, dont go into tier 3 until you know you can get a hit off
---
I'll get youuu my pretties!
---
lmao
---
how do I unsubscribe from a blog
---
edit: I honestly don't think I should even grace you with a proper reply but against my better judgment; you're honestly delusional if you think killers aren't the side that determine the pace of the game
---
yeah go ahead and call me a survivor main next, I have all killers in the game at lv.50+ and will happily teach your scrub ass how to play any of them, literally dm me or call me out and I'll show you how it's done live
---
Hold up did U happen to play on the game?
---
New skin incoming?
---
I dont wanna go against pc nurses. Im ok with having nurse a potatoe on console lol
---
At the start of a match focus on only stalking to get out of tier one asap so you can actually chase people and have a lunge with proper distance. If they drop a pallet and it doesn't stun you then get some stalking in but not loads and then keep chasing. Never go straight to tier 3, wait until you can guarantee a hit on them(when they're healthy unless you're going after multiple people in one tier 3 usage) or when you know you can get multiple people. In tier 3 his vault speed is way fast so don't be afraid to vault instead of always just going around if you're chasing in tier 3.
---
Im all for crossplay between consoles but pc never mixes right tbh
---
What exactly does it too now?
---
It really doesnt
---
Between consoles I'd love it,pc would have. A it if an unfair advantage with better aiming etc. Basically all my friends play it on xbox and I'm stuck on ps4 :(
---
A skill gap. You hit the nail on the head. You want a skill GAP. Survivors should be able to bully killers, placing them on even pegging removes this ‚Äúgap‚Äù.
---
Actually it‚Äôs the strong killers who already have a fast travel mechanic: Blink, Chainsaw sprint, gen teleport and haunting. This would just boost all the weaker ones and offer more killer variation at high ranks. 
---
I agree, it‚Äôs luck of the draw how long Ruin lasts, by introducing a minute long buffer all you do is ensure SOME use out of it before the killer is handicapped to 3 perks. It may get insta cleansed after, it may last all game. The only difference now is an assured benefit. What‚Äôs the problem? It is a PERK after all.
---
I'm pretty sure they recorded 90% of Steve's voice with a male voice actor and then the voice actor called in sick so they had to do his hook scream with a female voice actor.
---
It really is though! Haha. I just thought that was a cool tidbit and wanted to share since it was relevant.
---
It lets a person see the recovery rate of a dying person via colored aura
---
Its a good idea for consoles lesser for pc because console killers would just get bullied for playing console
---
Not my pc bud
---
Console killers and survivors will just get shit on and shit talked
---
nah, cause Basic Skills like looping, mindgames, map knowledge would fuck with beginners

I think my current build is A Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Save The Best For Last, Thrilling Tremors, and Whispers. Whispers helps me find people early, TT is good for information (though I sometimes use Discordance instead), I just love STBFL for chases and slugging when necessary, and Nurse‚Äôs is really really good on GF, especially on more enclosed maps.
---
What about shared across all survivors
---
I really wish they were. Nothing makes me cringe harder as a rank 5 Killer than when the Survivors all gen rush the crap out of me and then I'm left with 3 - 4 gens in one corner of the map where the random Meg broke every pallet and teabagged me all match.

Ill actually stop playing for good. I get shit talked enough on ps4 i dont need pc dickheads too
---
The tbag is well deserved
---
Simple tip, if you stop stalking right before hitting tier 3 you can save that until you are right next to someone and instantly down them and have a full EW3 to carry them to a hook and/or hunt the others down
---
I play 1-2 and i get nurses multiple times a day lol
---
I may just have bad luck.
---
I'd take a spirt over a nurse any day though
---
Frick you!
---
I stopped playing around june but kept up to date with everything. I had to stop, it was getting to me really bad mentally. I haven't touched it since and feel better for it
---
Holy shit that's perfect. After going down for the first time, either after being unhooked or picked off the ground, you remain broken for the duration of the trial and can revive yourself. Ideally without the killer's knowledge.
---
Survivors going on an open field in the first minute against Bubba though.
---
I think it's going to be way harder now that you can't reliably boost friends.
---
Yeah i get it. I havent stopped but its not the only thing i play so i guess that helps
---
Same here brother, enjoy it
---
it started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
---
Because that's what heroes do
---
Provengence camps and tunnel all the time. He‚Äôs literally the worse exemple you could give.
---
Yes, he wins but he plays like a d*ck. I don‚Äôt know anyone who faced him that had fun.
---
I‚Äôm a red rank trapper myself and I manage to win without being a d*ck to the survivor I face.
---
Nothing more terrifying than seeing the random Claudette or Meg leave the gen just to turn around and see Myers staring at you.
---
Alternatively nothing more hilarious than leaving the gen when Spine Chill lights up and then watching Ghostface or Wraith yeet the random Claudette / Meg.
---
Nice
---
Imo he is equally as fun and the most fun killer to play against. Hes the only one who is consistently scary but I dont face many no terror radius killers as much as him
---
I play mk11 and red dead 2 on the side its much more peaceful especially when i dont have play online mode
---
Theoretically it is possible trials were different prior to gates being a thing in the entity's realm. It's possible the entity saw what vigo was doing and took the idea from them, and adjusted accordingly with the gates. After all, why would the black lock be restricted to only one survivor being left? What mechanism could vigo have put in without the aid of the entity for the hatch to open when there's one left?
---
Lmao I'm on PS4 too so there will be less Billy's and more Spirit's.
---
The ultimate situational dilemma!
---
Just tip I guess as a fellow animator, face moves wayyy to fast, also you could slow down how fast he's coming towards the camera but a lot too
---
Yeah offline games are definitely more peaceful and fun. Not to shit om dbd but its fan base can be horrid sometimes for no reason
---
Most of teammates I get are brain dead
---
I must get monitor and abuse... already I‚Äôm getting a first hit every match at EWI. It‚Äôs so fun.
---
When f13 added the offline bots it was a step in right direction just sucks nothing new will come for the game.
---
What do you mean? He does a bit when people do things that he finds toxic which is mainly blinding at pallets. He does it to whoever and whenever lol
---
I mainly play as survivor as I always receive salty messages whenever I have good game as a killer. I wish I can ignore them easily.
---

Well I don't think that there will be many of them bullying their little friends.

I certainly won't at least.

Please leave

Unsurprisingly it was no-ed too.....

We actually managed to save the guy. But lost my friend as a trade of...
---
Yeah, those silly plagues will never use thanatophobia, tinkerers, bamboozle, or use a blessed apple offering or worse hehehe. 20's chases here we come.
---
Its also not difficult to go uber stealth for like, 30 seconds.
---
So just play killer without a power?
---
She‚Äôs honestly a VERY underrated killer in my opinion, if your facing a plague that knows how to play it can be the most headache of a game. Although I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs broken because if your a good enough survivor you can win even tho your all a 1 hit
---
Its not, dont worry, when you play against her at least once you will have a slightly better understanding of whats "broken" and whats not.

---
Save the best for last encourages you not to chase your obsession, because you lose stacks, while play with your food encourages you to chase your obsession.
---
They aren't completely against each other as PWYF doesn't require to hit, but it's utility is niche at best.
---
Freddy is pretty fun to play in general.  Just get bbq and chili for him and you're set.
---
*Hitboxes exist*

[deleted]
---
The thing is dbd is meant to bring the primal urge of survival its meant to be a horror game. Does it feel like one no. Does it play like one? Not really. Tbh I would love to see a first person mode for survivors. That would make me come back to the game in a heartbeat
---
Yeah even as a killer this is dumb shit, plus when you hook you either have 2 gates nearby or none.
---
I'd say that Michael's animation is more like he's fascinated by the blood and gore on his weapon, not that he doesn't know what the Knife is lol.
---
PS4 nurse main I shall show you hehe
---
Because its a game, and some of us like it when its well designed and fun for everyone, not just "my side". Dont worry when you're here long enough you'll learn there isnt sides.
---
We can only fix the imbalances one by one, right mate? :)
---
This may be the funniest thing I've seen in my entire 20 years of being on this fucking planet
---
Probably the reason games don't go well for you with huntress after rank 10 is cause you don't have ruin.
---
Huntress is good at downing survivors relatively fast (depending on the map layout and if there aren't too many long-wall loops), but due to her slower movement speed she has no map control.
---
Or ... the generators produce enough power for the gates to work. Just a thought.
---
The game was scary back in the day but now its a joke. If i see a killer i should be scared not be like hey its a huntress i can loop her for years. If the devs could stop listening to entitled survivor mains then maybe the game would be scary again
---
True enough - I don't actually watch his streams and had just recently played against him, and now caught him do this "Iron LF" thing, skipped through some VODs and stuck around for a bit. He did not tunnel when we played, and from some of his comments during this stream I gathered he usually does not like to play how he this time around indeed however did. Very possible he usually plays like this as well though. In either case, I should have kept that comment more strictly limited to Scorpionz, who I did actually watch a handful of times, and who I know for a fact to an extent even goes out of his way not to camp or tunnel, usually.
---
With that said, camping, tunnelling and slugging are all existing tactics that killers can and do employ as much as they like, and so they are of course very much part of the discussion. We can't buff killers to be able to win when hooking one survivor after the next, everyone 3 times, alternating targets every time, as long as the fact exists that you can simply go after one survivor 3 times in a row, or camp them to kill them after 2 or even just 1 hook, or that you can slug and kill multiple survivors on first hook (or just bleed them out if you are fun like that).
---
Personally I don't mind tunnelling as long as it is not farming someone off the hook without them being able to secure a fair chase, and it's something I would give as advice to any killer struggling to kill: go back to the hook when someone is unhooked and chase that unhooked survivor, try to get at least the first survivor out of the game as soon as possible by tunnelling them. It's not a necessity to win, and against the average survivors you'll meet not at all, but if you are struggling, try at least that. Might give someone another outlook on the game.
---
~~As a clown main~~
---
As **THE** clown main, I'm afraid :(
---
Healing a survivor from injured to dying while the killer is within 20 meters grants that Survivior the "endurance" status. 
---
Has a 60 second cooldown and does not work if you use an instaheal.
---
What a surprise, the killer mains down vote your topic into oblivion. Can't have anything that would stop them from getting their sweet 4k every game, or else 'survivors OP'.
---
[And you decide to take the hit and finish it.](https://imgur.com/gallery/TIcT3Ef)
---
And then theres the survivors guide to playing killer. Oh boo fucking hoo i smacked you down get on a hook and complain to someone who cares.
---

---
That's why when there's only one gen left I just wait at an exit gate. 
---
Like nah fam imma just skedaddle the fuck on outta here.
---
That's why I hate perks like NOED, undeserved easy sacrifices (coming from a killer main).
---
A) why doesn't it work like the post says 
---
And
---
B) how are all the gens connected to both doors? There aren't exactly wires to connect them really anywhere. 
---
There's definitely some entity magic at work
---
I always try to shake my head no at the random fucker who comes over to my strategically 99'd gen. Immersed Nancy's will come out of the gutters to pop my gen, forcing a 3 gen :(
---
A decent amount of people don't know how to effectively play killer. They run the same set of perks that they see everyone else run, even if it doesn't fit with the character they're using.
---
yes
---
Are you suggesting the Russian roulette build?
---
Is that what it‚Äôs called?
---
Pretty much. Adds another hex perk and prayer beads
---
Either way works
---
Ah, i see
---
Robbie is a kid(Axe Boy).
---
Exactly. All you hear about here or on Steam Discussions is how survivors 'always DC'. Apparently killers are little angels that can do no wrong.
---
But yeah, if you dare to cleanse their totem (so toxic right?) they often DC. I also notice a lot of killers face camp after being led on a long chase. The survivor isn't teabagging or flashlight clicking at every pallet, they're just trying to survive. Apparently that's toxic as well.
---
The problem with that is, not only can good survivors work through Ruin, but survivors also expect HG on spirit, meaning it‚Äôll only really work on potatoes who can‚Äôt help but touch the shiny totem
---
Separate survivor ranks wouldn't make sense as survivors are just skins.
---
And separate killer ranks would be bad too because then you could be someone with 5k hours as killer but you never play wraith or freddy so you'd be playing against rank 20 survivors even though you have a lot of experience in the game and would easily destroy them.
---
New No Mither buff idea:
---
When within **1/2/3** meter(s) of another survivor, you gain the ability to **hit another survivor with a bat, resulting in that survivor being put into the Broken state.** Using this ability will result in you becoming **exhausted** for **60/50/40 seconds.**
---
I think it's ***GREAT***
---
The last survivor isn't entitled to the hatch. It's up to the killer's good grace to give it to you, or find it before he does.
---
Either Ace for the quiet groans or claudette for invisiblity cloak. Or baby dwight to mindgame and/or get shown mercy
---
I made it in green ranks for the first time!! Currently at 11!
---
That was sarcasm. Because I have seen people say they'd report for cleansing against Plague. I was joking. I thought it was obvious, sorry.
---
You‚Äôre SOL there guy. Can‚Äôt imagine why you wouldn‚Äôt like wearing headphones tho, it‚Äôs infinitely easier to track with headphones as opposed to speakers
---
Ofcs there are better Killers, but for learning these 2 are the best. Simple as that.
---
Nah, you're fine. It's just difficult to tell if people are joking on this sub.
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/EnthusiasticRelentlessCrowKevinTurtle](https://clips.twitch.tv/EnthusiasticRelentlessCrowKevinTurtle)   
---
This also happened :)
---
Yeah, exactly. The killer mains who say "just do totems" have obviously never played solo survivor. SWF is OP, sure. But solo survivor, you don't have the luxury to waddle around the map doing nothing except hunt for totems. By the time you've got them all, your team is dead. So NOED is another bad perk.
---
I don't have a problem with killers using these perks if they have stomped us all game, getting hooks left and right. But if they haven't even got a single down, they sure as hell don't deserve it at the end.
---
You just gotta work around their stupidity
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXa86jrYwG0&amp;t=10m28s I'm just the messenger, obviously only a complete idiot would sincerely try to report someone for that.

I get that, but there have been countless times that I caught a glimpse of someone, only for them to lose me by LOS on a piece of cover and when I continue to search for them get called for proxy

Discordance one is better

I love how you're getting downvoted for speaking the truth. Salty killer mains everywhere on this sub. They won't be satisfied until survivors spawn on the hook.

I hate having to run certain *meta* perks just to have fun... it's the whole reason for the loadout I run on her.

Every time legion hits me with frenzy, he/she *runs away from me*.  I seriously don't get it, but whatever I guess.

I always just go mend and get back on a gen..

This is actually a pretty good idea.
---
Maybe its just the players in my region but I‚Äôm rank 4 and people just immediately do the one in the corner we spawn in every time.
---
PS4 here I see usually ghostface and legion that's about it
---
I also see self care relatively often either in place of BT or Adrenaline
---
Congrats! I got mine late August I think, the Nurse trophies hurt my soul
---
I didn‚Äôt read what the list was for and was very confused. It makes sense.
---
If we HAVE to take extremes, it's better to balance a game around the top tier than the bottom, but I would aim for upper-middle, personally. So Purple ranks, where it's still a bad time for those jobbers.
---
Bubba has a lot of potential in a situation that almost never comes up without camping. If he had a mini-lunge in each saw swing, though, he could really be something special.
---
Wraith can just keep up with good addons, but on his own he's really sad, and he has that skill ceiling that most Killers share which leaves him as ultimately just being reactive.
---
Pennywise isn't ABOUT being a clown, though. He just looks like a clown while he does shapeshifting murder. What Clown needs is an addon that lets direct bottle hits deal damage and to not slow down when charging throws.
---
&gt;Repair generators whenever possible. It's the only game-progressing objective there is. Foreign concept to many survivors...
---
You must get 3 genned a lot
---
I sent a dm
---
Wasnt your original point "camping and tunneling are also possible for the killer to do, doesn't make it any less sweaty or toxic." and yet dcing so someone can escape isnt "sweaty" and beyond toxic? You arent the brightest are you?

Spiderman new survivor
---
Huntress is WAY different than any other killer for several reasons. First, she doesn't deal with pallets and windows the same. 
---
Consider every single pallet as a mindgame, especially at high ranks. 
---
Also, all the chases aren't equal. You need to remember that, since there is ONE KIND OF CHASE you don't want to be involved into as Huntress. I mean the "long range" chases. For example, if you see someone pretty afar (more than 20 meters), already starting to run away from you (especially with SB), it's usually not a good chase to pick because, by the time you catch up to be decently effecient (unless the survivor stops and make that mistake), you'll waste quite a lot of time and won't be able to use mindgames properly as they will always be one step ahead of you, staying SAFE.
---
Totems, and also, CAMPING, is more beneficial with Huntress more than any other killer. The main reason being her ability to be ULTRA punishing and throwing a LOT OF HITS in short succession, making even BT not a decent alternative to escape from her.
---
Basically, what you don't want is playing a game, running after each survivors individually, from a decent distance (15-20 meters), trying to get some hatchets to hit (which may work at time, but will be unnefficient most of the time). What you want is getting close of your targets asap, obviously, because getting close and applying the proper mindgame is just a GARANTEED HIT with her, since there is NO WAY a survivor can dodge.
---
If you feel comfortable enough with your chases, don't forget you're not forced to camp, and to add some mindgames in your play. But overall, just remember you don't want to take the baits of "faraway chases", and most survivors will just show themselves around a hooked person, trying to bait you away from a "safe distance", sprint bursting away to safe spots as you get closer. Don't get caught into these chases, and pick the survivors putting themselves in unsafe spots. Don't stress out the multiple catches unless you are very behind in your round. Then you may consider leaving the hook and try to down multiple person to catch up.

When looking for survivors, use Whispers effectively, and if possible, try to run in straight line, as fast as possible, toward a gen with very few hiding spots. Don't forget you are HUMMING constantly, which makes the kind of move like "I'll come from behind that gen to surprise them" totally unneffective. Just go STRAIGHTFORWARD not to allow survivors to reach a good hiding spot/catch them in the open.
---
Don't throw hatchets too quick, especially on survivors in the open. Survivors can easily predict the timing of the throw if you do so. Also, the charged hatchet at mid-range is nearly impossible to dodge if properly thrown, especially if you make its timing unpredictable. You probably noticed that a lot of survivors, when caught in the open against Huntress, will just run in circles trying to dodge, not getting to safe places anymore. Exploit that to eventually come closer or fully charge and throw it when they don't expect it.
---
Also, don't WASTE HATCHETS. And by saying this, I mean, don't throw "random hatchets that may or may not hit". We all do that at times, but trying these unprobable hatchets can actually be gamechanging, mostly because, against good survivors, not having hatchets = never catching them.
---
Which leads to my last advice : Don't chase without hatchets in a pallet heavy area. For obvious reasons. Just give up the chase, and get back to a closet. Instantly. It's NOT worth your time. You want your chase to be 30s max as Huntress.
---
Perks Loadout :
---
Ruin : Just mandatory. You need to slow down these gens. Totems are also easier to protect as Huntress even if you're slow, because of your ranged attacks. Also, one of your main strategy to get an easy 4k at high rank will just be to hook someone next to your Hexed totem as it's spotted, and just punish any bold attemps while disabling nearby gens. Most survivors will be entitled either to go for the save or to destroy that totem, and usually it will happen until they die, and will very effectively remove all pallets from a whole area of a map.
---
BBQ &amp; Chili : Also mandatory, both for the BP and the Intel. Knowing where your opponents are during a match as Huntress is great. Mostly to know if it's safe to camp or not, and because of the fact that, supposedly, the only thing that actually stops you from catching people in a matter of seconds is STEALTH, as she's a rather quick downing killer.
---
Whispers : Really good to make sure some survivors are around you at all times. She TRULY NEEDS that perk. Mostly for one thing : you need to know, while getting closer of a gen, if someone is working on it or not. Try to learn the "32 meters" distance, so you can actually know if there's someone working on that gen while getting close of it, and if it's worth searching the area.
---
About the last perk slot, it's a matter of preference/add-ons.
---
I tend to use Brutal Strength, mostly because I value pallet breaking speed, as it's the only "chasing perk" that is consistent in the game, allowing you to catch up rather quickly and may end up gamechanging by transforming a miss into a hit just by allowing you to get closer, faster.
---
Nurse's calling is also a great alternative, especially if you use your slow-healing add-ons. It's very effective on Huntress because people have hard time to tell what distance you're at, because her terror radius is rather small. Might catch people off-guard.
---
Some people will tell you to get Thrill of the Hunt. I wouldn't consider that. Protecting RUIN is your main concern, and since you don't know which totem is which, it makes TOTH rather unneffective, or even counter-productive in some matches if they spawn apart, since you might simply chose to protect the... Wrong totem while your ruin is being destroyed at the opposite of the map.
---
Overcharge is pretty decent, but I don't think it has enough benefits overall on Huntress, even tho her lategame is usually rather strong. I tried it tho, and it worked rather decently. It's just a matter of personnal preference.
---
Deerstalker/Knock out can eventually be good, since you tend to down a lot of people in succession, as Huntress.
---
About add-ons :
---
Nearly everything is viable. I like "Preparing time reduced" the most. But movement speed is good, cooldown is nice, and the debuffs are pretty much effective when it comes to 
---
slow healing/slowing down movement. Just pick what you like.
---
Rip piggy oink in peace
---
Why should they address something that isn't a problem?
---
Interfering in another survivor's chase is only one of the more direct ways of "taking the heat", though. It starts with simple things such as not hiding from BBQ and simply giving killers a chase, a reason not to go back to the hook and camp/tunnel by not making them have to search for you (or even intentionally making them aware of your location), and goes to throwing yourself at hooks when a player is being camped to trade places before the next hook stage.
---
Being tunnelled is not bad if you want to actually be chased, which I find a player in this game should, because it's the most interactive, skill-based part of the game - it's one of the main actual "playing" parts of it, and one should seek out chase play, practice and enjoy it. Either way, you also have perks to help others and yourself, and by taking the heat you enable those perks to see use, as well. Pressuring a camped hook to get someone rescued before they enter struggle stage or die for instance can often be beneficial due to perks like Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, or items like insta-heals or flashlights they can use to make something happen being put back into play.
---
Keep working! I believe in you!
---
When I use to stream dbd and play myers, I use to say shit like " Daddy mikie thinks you've been bad. Time for a spanking!" It would kill! My point is, this made me laugh for five minutes!
---
I just get *a lot* of survivors that do not repair generators with much of any dilligence. And then lose. Pikachu face.
---
Identifying which gens to repair in order not to leave 3 close together somewhere does not require much time, if you're insinuating that that is why so many survivors are so slow to pop gens.
---
Can‚Äôt recall. I think you keep your bloodpoints earned but you stay the same pip(?)
---
No, he's supposed to look like Kyle Gallner. Who had a full, round face without heavy wrinkles in the movie, not looking older than Ace or Bill
---
I think a bit after legion came out
---
That moment as killer when you see it happening and go did they just do that?????
---
Make that 6. *Wink*
---
the depip squad was mostly killer mains who wanted to prove that at the *very* top level the game was heavily survivor favored.  They never got 4k'ed in over a hundred matches, only got 3ked twice. They also didn't use perks or add-ons, and later on in the challenge, they stopped using comms too.
---
I like self care
---
There hasn't been much in the way of balance changes besides the DS nerf since the depip squad finished their experiment.
---
They really need to rework either totem positions or totems themselves. There is some guy who posted on this sub where he had a file filled with bullshit totems next to gens in plain sight.
---
How as a map designer do you take important things like totems, in maps that could fit hundreds of them without them being visable, but you put them directly next to generators for survivors to easily see them. 
---
The best totem spots in the game at the moment is Swamp in some cases, the preschool rework maps, and there was a spot on the asylum chapel map I liked.
---
I always thought Nea looks like 40 üòÇ
---
Perhaps if you're just looking for killer salt, but tbh I'd rather play the game than dying on my first hook, no matter how much bubba honors me with his facecamp I'll still take the normal game over that situation
---
Kinda surprised Freddy was so high and Hillbilly and the demogorgon so low (I know it ain't representing the community fully but still, I also find it accurate though as I don't get a lot of them.) Also found it interesting from what I saw in the thread the demogorgon is only that high because of people making multiple killers and mentioning him(from just glancing at it)
---
Meh, gates can spawn on the opposite side of the map too, I can't feel too bad for them
---
Not right!
---
Seriously they do need to rework the spots for totems. My least favorite thing is to end up on Coldwind or the Asylum and have them literally out in the open.
---
there are 7 gens total per map. 
---
sometimes when there‚Äôs 1 gen left to open gates, aka 3 gens undone, they‚Äôre very close together in that the killer can patrol one small area and watch over all 3 gens. 
---
basically as a survivor try to do gens on different sides of the map and if at least 2 gens are closely together make sure to do at least 1 of them.
---
I'm so glad I finally understand where this meme comes from.
---
You know what they say, you become what you eat.
---
I got the game on Monday and made it to rank 6 today as adrenaline saved me from a what was a 2 man on hook, one d/c and me down with a pig trap on. Killer closed hatch, I ran to gate opened and got away! Wonder if there is any point to keep trying to reach 1 though
---
Thanks
---
What is this, fucking Garry‚Äôs Mod?
---
Slugging - when the killer only downs, but does not hook the survivors so that a sole remaining survivor can not find the hatch and escape. Attempting to get 4k (or four kills.)
---
DC - Disconnect from the game.
---
every night i pray to got "dear got, please make the camping killers go away. i seem to get them every game. and one more thing got, can you maybe buff leatherface so maybe he wont feel like he needs to face camp me. thank you for watching down on my from havin', amen"
---
I could see it could work as long there is rank splash caps to a point. As for an example, if the cap is 10; get myers you get Myers to rank 1, the others will be at 10.
---
Survivors after they land the perfect pallet drop.
---
Ugh, you don't even get to see her curves.
---
The ones of her weird bulbous tumours and cysts, now THAT is hot!
---
Personally I have a lot of fun with Dance With Me, Head On, Babysitter, Self Care
---
Yeah I find it weird I never see Nurses despite her being the best killer. I always play as Nurse as Killer but haven't been against her in over a year.
---
removing collision would be fine. They're purple not IRID and they are soo powerful.
---
edit: spirit main btw
---
The Pallet Face.
---
I have almost 300 hours in this game, yet I still suck as killer or survivor. No amount of playing or Tutorial watching has made me better. Highest rank I've gotten was 14 I think
---
I think setting them down at the start is the best way to play him. Too bad it makes him less viable. I do it too but I think you need corrupt on him for it. Plus ruin. Takes time to set up your map pressure.
---
It's Thursday, I'm in love!
---
I had all 8,000 but one was at 7,900 lmao I was sad
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if you got a merciless for a quick 4K and not the arbitrary scoring system. You could move up ranks fast enough that it wouldn‚Äôt matter. They would have to stop or pace out the rank resets.
---
I've played l4d2 recently and I'd say its still thriving, you can find 8 player versus matches very quickly. Although there are still some difficulties finding certain modes like realism versus or scavenge.
---
AAAAAGHHHH MY ARTHRITIS
---
That add on is useless
---
I like to think Demo is just insulting the survivor in his language
---
when you forget how freaking laggy cod was and how people lag switched it to death.....
---
This pin is rad, can they sell these please?! I need one!
---
I would replace spine chill with premonition. Thats just me tho. Pretty similar perks
---
Cant use addons?
---
I actually stayed back and let the Entity kill me during EGC. I'm not sure if that's a lot of points, but it's the thought that counts?
---
OOF
---
Burning inscence and one that decreases the cooldown
---
0/10, hat doesnt extend beyond the frame
---
Well... That sounds like one mighty glitch
---
No, I can use them, but I have not found a single combo of add-ons for Plague to help with adept. As gens go really fast or people dc/kill themselves before 3rd hook.
---
I like second wind
---
Have you tried it before? Because even with the purple effectiveness add-on I can't get people off gens.
---
Just press alt tab right before you get hooked then go back on it once you're hooked. It stops the scream sound cue from activating on your end.
---
You can stalk more than one person at a time.. I've exposed 2 people simultaneously multiple times.
---
I figured out an easier way. I now press escape before the hook and it mutes the sound to bearable levels.
---
Decisive Strike
---
Borrowed Time
---
Dead Hard/Balanced Landing
---
Iron Will
---
Honestly I feel like Adrenaline is too niche to be superior to Iron Will in most situations. Then again whenever I do have it on it feels useless and whenever I don't it feels necessary lol.
---
I would replace it with second wind
---
No
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
this is everything i wanted
---
By the gods that's so much worse.
---
because doctor‚Äôs halloween skin last year is amazing and free if u grinded for it. i‚Äôm p3 doc but i use halloween skin :)
---
It's mostly because killers like Huntress and Nurse are pretty challenging on their own but factor in console and it's even harder.
---
The legion seem more terrifying now. Megs back story was good. And Anna closing the hatch was icing on the cake.
---
There‚Äôs an issue with not all friends making it to the lobby. Getting into a group with friends is finicky sometimes but even once it all works out, 1 or more of the teammates often get stuck behind the others when Connecting, requiring him/her to sit out and wait or everyone to back out and start over.
---
Replace it with Resilience or We'll Make it
---
The devs mentioned a few months back that they were thinking of implementing that for Killers. Would definitely be interesting and would help increase killer variety in red ranks at the very least. Though at same time, there‚Äôs a reason you only see a handful of killers at red ranks lol.
---
nah nah nah nah nah here's what you do, you grab Distressing and Whispers, Distressing on Spirit makes her terror radius something like 31 meters, then Whispers is like 32 meters detection range, you walk straight towards a generator, then if Whispers goes off that means a survivor is (probably) on that generator, taking a step or two forward puts them barely in your terror radius which means they won't hear your woosh noises when you pop up behind them to eat their asshole. Toss on Save the Best for Last if you just wanna be *brutal* about it, Spies From the Shadows if you're fucking blind like me, Iron Grasp and/or Agitation for easier hookage. BBQ &amp; Chilli is another popular option of course.
---
OMG THANK YOU!!!!
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
If you are swf the matches go by the highest rank survivor now.
---
Console still goes off off averages, it should be fixed when the update comes
---
Well if you‚Äôre not having the issue, then I‚Äôm happy for you. It‚Äôs quite a pain. 
---
And if you‚Äôre just a punky killer main who hates SWF, well, agree to disagree, friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Or lowest whatever terminology you use. That match was valid.
---
plunderers is godly for finding keys :&gt; makes EGC a lot more fun, just follow the killer till the close it and leave haha
---
he could have just stood there forcing a door open or death, (shitty options but still options).
---
no, not at all. But you shouldn‚Äôt go into a game knowing you‚Äôre gonna have bad connection.
---
I had to remove all add ons to get adept.
---
ffffffffive I think, also getting that reset instantly gives her Corruption without her needing to even touch a fountain (though she only gets the one charge instead of one for each fountain so pros and cons on that one) so you won't be able to get a full team cleanse unless everyone cleanses, then someone gets sick again and cleanses
---
My advice to you is simple: Don't follow a survivor's made up rules (and they have many made-up rules). Their made-up rules are said to get them to win more, get you to LOSE more, and get them to have more fun than you will. 
---
If you were playing Mortal Kombat and someone messaged you to ask if you could stop blocking their hits so much and let them hit you more, you'd laugh them off the fucking chat wouldn't you? This is the same shit. Only in this game does nonsense like that gets debated. It's an utterly ridiculous notion by survivors.
---
Their made-up rules are only in their heads, and they spew it to you in post game chats to get you to conform to their whims. Their made-up rules make you a WEAKER killer, take away from your OWN fun, your OWN points, and your OWN rank.
---
You are not in the game to be a friend to survivors. You are there to kill them, and to have fun killing them. Period. There is nothing else to it.
---
If you obey made-up survivor rules you are not only a pushover and will come to regret it, but you'll have less fun in this game overall. You will not find much sympathy from them if they curb stomp you in match, I assure you. They'll make fun of you during the match with t-bags and other bully tactics, and they'll make fun of you after the match is over. They'll use their best perks, and they'll never apologize to you for using them either. Why would you apologize for using your best perks?  
---
If this is your idea of a fun time.. by all means, give them the hatch when they kobe. And let them escape if they've been a good sport. And never ever kill a hooked survivor "too fast" (i.e. what they call "tunneling"). And don't bring in NOED even though it's an easily counterable perk. Appease them in all the ways you'd like, and for every 1 of them that thanks you, 2 will give you a "gg ez win" and "lol baby killer" in the post game chat.
---
I don't know about you, but when someone figuratively spits in my face, I won't say "thank you". I'll knock them out so that they'll never dare do it again. You are there to kill. Relish it. Enjoy it. There is nothing wrong with it. I find playing survivor to be boring and uninteresting. I want the challenge of the hunt. I like the thrill of chasing. I want the decisive victory. I want to win. There is nothing a survivor can say to me to get me to purposely handicap my own success to appease them. 
---
In the end, you or someone who cares for you paid a lot of money for this game. And the devs have not made it easy on killers. Half the killers in this game are still shit, and for the ones that you are good with you have to find enjoyment with them any way you can. Do not let made-up rules get in the way of you having fun. Play the style you find most enjoyable. Put your own happiness and fun first.
---
Man, you asking that on DBD Reddit, here even breathing or existing in this Universe is toxic.
---
How do I know?
---
Spine chill is good for knowing when a killer is coming toward you as opposed to just where they are (they have to be looking in your direction for spine chill). That gives you a lot of information. If you have a good understanding of where you are and where a killer can be approaching, Premonition is not needed. I have found premonition only to be superior in the middle of a field, which is. It the best place to be overall. Premonition also has a cooldown where spine chill does not. 
---
Both are decent, but Spine chill can tell you when Spirit or Nurse are using their power, or when you juked a killer and they are walking in the opposite direction, Premonition can‚Äôt. Premonition can make you think it is not safe to be on a gen, when they are just walking by and not toward you.
---
Lmfao
---
Spies From the Shadows good perk.
---
Ping indicator. Little bar on the bottom right that goes red yellow or green
---
This is amazing. Absolutely incredible. Just astounding. Congrajashins on Rank 1! Wow!!!!!
---
No actually, for it to be sweaty, you would have to care about your own score, if you dc to give someone the hatch it is the opposite of sweaty. Also it sure is a sign of intelligence and a good argument when you resort to name calling but then again that's just my opinion and I'm "not the brightest"
---
Use that camaraderie as a test slot. Try some of them and see what works. There isn‚Äôt a great amount of pets that you have unlocked right now.  It can be fun to try new ones.
---
If you're on PC, sometimes the ping in pre-game lobbies are a bit of a liar. If you just type anything and hit enter, from the moment you hit enter until you see the chat submit is your delay.
---
But a lot of the time you really do have no way of knowing unfortunately, regardless of this method.
---
It's fine there's time to run, ... But damn I like to pop it in their faces...
---
You should be able to know when they‚Äôre actually coming for you based off the heartbeat and the situation. Premonition lets you know where so you can know your best route of escape. I used to have both in my build and find premonition to be far more useful. Just based off my experience tho
---
must...complete... final...gen...
---
*get's hit once*
---
ARRGGHHHHHHHHHH
---
*last gen pops*
---
*get's downed*
---
worth it.
---
Aren't you that guy who used Adrenaline once in 2017? Yeah fuck off your opinion has no validity here.
---
Im not going to ask because i feel like i already know..
---
nooooooooo dwight
---
Billelis' works always reminded me of the plague, [especially this one](https://twitter.com/billelis/status/1180561126502928384)
---
Bro wait until rank reset. You need all iridescent for a Merciless Killer and it's just too hard to do that with meta perks, let alone adept. Waiting until reset then only needing 2 gold and 2 iridescents in green ranks (I think) is definitely worth the wait
---
i wanna make a meme like this but instead it‚Äôs talking about survivors dcing after going down, it represents me to the fullest
---
Well you shouldn't have too, as you can use them for adept. I have done it many times for every killer except Plague and Ghostface. I just want get Plague done, so I can learn some more Ghostface as I think he looks pretty fun to play.
---
Ghostface is more B, while hag is def A
---
&gt;He starts going after Nancy while slugging me. To me, that IS tunneling as he could‚Äôve hooked me first.
---
That's... not tunelling. Why let an injured survivor get away when you can get two hooks for the price of one?
---
Oh yeah, its all coming together.
---
Painted my kids room yesterday
---
Shit, beat me, and by a mere 5 hours.
---
Aren't they cool??
---
Doctor in the same group as huntress and hag O.O
---
I wasnt mistaken when i said it was the sexy side ;)
---
I have to cite the fact that this is a copypasta every time I post it, because the one time I don't cite that it's a copypasta I get downvoted to shit.
---
This was a Reddit comment some asshole posted on a meme I made awhile back. I showed it to a few of my friends and we all laughed at it, and now it has sort of become a running gag among us.
---
For the record said asshole also spammed my private messages, Steam comments, and various Subreddits I moderate telling me to kill myself about 20+ times. Out of curiosity I checked his Reddit profile and amazingly he's still not banned, and still posts on this sub.
---
Almost all his posts have 10 downvotes or more. In particular I saw one with about 50 downvotes where he was telling someone to hang themselves because they made a meme about Survivor mains getting mad when Killers use NOED.
---
Thanks regal
---
Because he‚Äôs not even giving her a chance to escape. I understand your logic, but going right after the unhooked person, while camping and neglecting their secondary objective, which are generators, is tunneling and not a fun experience for anyone. It‚Äôs simply cheap, even if it‚Äôs a tactic and legit and justified among killers. Then killers complain about being gen rushed. SMH.
---
Ah yes, a few points i forgot to consider, well its a strategy nonetheless lol. Thanks btw.
---
Why does everyone rank the clown so low? I'm still new and maybe he just fits my playstyle but I find him really strong
---
Nurse should be in a tier of her own, Spirit and Billy are good enough to be above A tier, but Nurse is a step above them
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a butch to keep em off, try to also use an offering for a small map like lerys or something like that.
---
Thats cool dont give money to reddit because you were entertained by someone else :) treat someone close to a $5 treat instead or donate ;) i dont need awards.
---
I think each salty lips is +3%, so assuming what he said is accurate (I've never heard about a luck cap before) that sticks you at 4% + 3% + 3% for 10%, and you get 3 chances to kobi. However, there's other Luck boosting stats in the game,  [https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1473095331495650429/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1473095331495650429/)   
---
here's a full breakdown someone did that gives you over 85% chance to kobi.
---
Playing the long con on that one
---
Not off by heart but with up the ante and slippery meat it's somewhere in the I think late 80s low 90s % wise.
---
baby dweets are so pure
---
Oh no! You just cyberbullied and harass me! I'm gonna create about 20 threads on Reddit about how unsafe this subreddit is! Dear Behaviour, PLEASE NERF REDDIT COMMENTS, it's too unsafe and toxic.
---
Cuz no ded ard
---
That hand offering with no items makes me very sad
---
man guarantees an easy 4k after being the last one up and showing the Trapper where he is.
---
At ranks where nobody has all the perks they want unlocked because they just started playing the game, it is an extreme advantage.
---
Lol damn the roast 
---
https://youtu.be/131n9JUuLsM
---
Yes pls
---
Yes, just invest those into someone else, but make sure you come back to it later because why not.
---
I think the default break animation should be a ninja kick for all killers
---
Is it just me or does ruin get harder to hit with more people on the gens? I seem to get the great skill checks when I‚Äôm alone but when someone comes, I ended missing them more often
---
I agree, except i think Freddie is b tier, and bubba would be B tier.
---
Closing the hatch has priority
---
Ok thx
---
This weekend was NYCC and my roommate and I spent a bunch of time at BHVR's booth. We got to play the mobile game, meet the devs and talk with a bunch of other fans. The devs were so happy and passionate about the game and the fans, and all the other players we met were really nice and excited to share their love and strats and mains. Online gaming can be so toxic and discouraging sometimes, but this weekend really boosted my spirits and reminded me why I love this game.
---
When I‚Äôm visiting my grandparent‚Äôs cottage in the summer I always see a mosquito on my bunk bed
---
Same as slugging me for four minutes trying to find my teammate.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 16 (highest I‚Äôve ever been) and I play with my red rank friend and we always play with other red ranks and we always play against spirit
---
He got gen rushed. How was that smart to camp 30+ seconds, neglecting gens and two healthy survivors and only focusing on me and tunneling another one? Nothing about that was smart. What was smart was how the survivors realized what was up and focused on gens.
---
Premo is not f tier. Either way, neither perk is really necessary if you have any idea what youre doing. Unless your going against spirit or nurse. Then all rules are abandoned
---
This would be a solid theory if the Entity didn't place those gens there for the survivors to do. Remember, the Entity doesn't just feed off of fear, but also hope. Whether the killer kills everykne or the survivors all escape , the Entity is the real winner
---
Here's the perks for The Sabotager
---
Perk 1
---
When picking up or hooking a survivor that survivors aura is hidden for 25/30/45 seconds.
---
Survivor pick up drop and hook speed are also slightly increased.
---
Perk 2
---
When damaging a generator that generator Cannot Be Repaired for 20/30/45 seconds and the locations of survivors within a 20 meter range are revealed to you for 5 seconds.
---
Perk 3
---
Survivors within your Tr suffer a slightly/Moderately/Considerably reduced Repair speed.
---
Increase your Tr by 8 meters.
---
**THE TREES**
---
The hair line is a little wild on this one. I think you should take the hair and glue it down a little further, I‚Äôve seen someone do it here: https://youtu.be/4oeWE0ODOXI I think it makes a huge improvement
---
Bill is my main because I love L4D, he does bad on maps with trees tho.
---
ill give it a try, thanks!
---
I mean I think you could use it on the hag but really it would suck if you get it for all killers, like imagine the first ~15 lvls of a killer are easy to rank up but if you keep getting Hex: TTS it would be annoying and BP waste
---
Been having this issue since the update was released tbh. Never had these issues prior. 
---
Your description is what I‚Äôm experiencing to a T.
---
cool thanks.
---
I don't think I'm taking it to the extremes.  I'd bet that if we saw the stats the game is pretty well balanced.  Last time they showed, it was a 2K average at every rank, which it should be.
---
I find every killer viable through purple ranks with the exception of clown.  Most red rank players I face are actually bad loopers.  They're a little more sneaky and focused on the objective.  They have a general idea to run towards loops, but they aren't good loopers.  They don't understand spacing.  They understand what mind games are, but aren't great at mind games.
---
Survivors complain that Nurse, Spirit and Billy are OP.  Killers complain that survivors are OP.  I think the fact that both sides are complaining is a good indicator that the game is actually somewhat balanced.  
---
I agree that the bottom three killers could use a buff or rework, but not a universal buff.

In regards to clown/pennywise, I don't have a problem with two clowns in the game.  I really just think the clown is bad and I don't see how they will rework him to be decent without making him annoying to play against.  I'd much rather the Devs focus reworks on a number of other killers and general balancing before giving clown a rework.
---
I enjoyed the original IT but haven't seen the new ones.  I'd gladly welcome Pennywise to the game.  He's one of the few iconic licensed killers remaining.
---
 You know what? Nerf the word "nerf", this word is so toxic and also too OP.
---
No but if your ping is above 200 personally i find a new game it works 99% of the time on pc
---
I can't believe you would gen rush him. I think that's lame and deprives killers of their fun.

That‚Äôs one of the parts I wanted to fix most but wasn‚Äôt sure how, you‚Äôre awesome thank u for ur critique and help!!
---
Me neither
---
This is why I'm scared for pennywise to be in the game
---
I thought it was low tier till I saw that video and gave it a shot. Used premonition before that, myself. At least for my play style, Spine chill is better. 
---
It can also help when you are healing someone or being healed. If SC goes active and stays active while healing, the killer has Nurses Calling. You know to run. If it stays blank or only temporarily turns on (the killer is looking around), you know it is safe to heal, even if you are in the terror radius. 
---
With the new status of Undetectable, I am not sure it it works with pig or wraith since the new patch. It used to.

?? how so

Maybe cuz he has all the items idk
---
Wait no its his perks look at his perks
---

---
It's about as much as one hook. It's more the thought. I'm nice everytime I'm winning too hard. Call me puzsy but I feel bad. When people say thank you or do that, its heart warming. When they dont, you slowly get over doing it with people.
---
Both end in odd numbers :(

As for the Mori The Sabotage grabs the Survivor by the neck before snapping their neck then dropping them.
---
The Sabotager is basically a No Nonsense type of killer wanting the survivors dead asap and doesn't waste time killing them like other killers
---
Except the ones I don‚Äôt own, my brain farted
---
Hahaha, sadly legion cannot
---
Run pwyf and then try
---
The demo is an animal, a roar is a roar I think
---
Some would say that's a trick, but for me it's a treat.
---
Rank 12-20: I can't wait to do two gens, run/stun and lose the killer twice, get three saves and then die my first hook while no one is on a gen.
---
Rank 1-8: I hope the killer doesn't decide to tunnel me.
---
There's always that one guy that follows you and tries to heal you not realizing you have the broken effect
---
hey if you provide a name to someone trolling we can deal with that

No, this is the original Kate voice. She had a completely different voice when she and the clown were first released on the PTB, but they redid all of it because people complained about how loud it was (and some said she didn't actually sound like she had the voice of a singer).
---
Play killer, for two hits and a hook you get 1110 points. poor survivors
---
Well, what else do you want survivors to do if they know the killer camps / tunnels? No matter where you go, everyone will advice you on this subreddit to do gens IF the killer camps or tunnels. Why give the killer a free 4K for using a cheap tactic? He got gen rushed as it‚Äôs a counter play to camping and tunneling.
---
20/30/45 seconds is a long time id say like 15/20/25 it seems like an interesting idea but essentially is he all about just slowing things down

---
Wait what changed?
---
I personally really like the Houdini build. Lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet, and lightweight. Once I get it I'm gonna try and swap out lightweight for fixated.
---
I love this idea SO MUCH. sacrificing gen speed to awareness makes so much sense. It would also add another objective instead of every survivor just sitting on a gen waiting to spot the killer. I &lt;3 you for coming up with this!
---
RIP Hillbilly
---
Bad. This concept shows up every once in awhile, and every time I say: By giving the characters separate abilities then you take away choice because everyone is going to be pressured to pick the 'best' characters. And then all you'll see is a bunch of red ranks using the same exact survivors, like Squadettes but worse. Or like red rank killers always choosing Billy/Nurse. Don't take away choice. Leave the survivors how they are.
---
In that case, the perk part of the build seems fine.   I just wouldn't use tuft with noed.  
---
Personally I'd swap out play with your food for unrelenting or better yet, spys from the shadows.   But I suppose you could use PWYF as a sort of anti-bullying perk so the obsession cant body block for his friends and players while your save the best for last isnt up to max rank.  Most low hour killers have problems dealing with 360's and just timing swings in general which would make Unrelenting look like a viable option.  
---
If you really want to use the tuft,  just swap Noed out for one of the two above perks.  PWYF is fine with Tuft to speed up your stalking.  Ideally you would swap it out with ruin so the gens aren't done before you pop ew3, but thats not an option yet it seems.  
---
I'd also suggest saving the memorial addon for use to combo with tombstones unless you have an abundance of them.  purple tombstones love the jmyers memorial, even more then tuft. (and maybe dont use STBFL with tombstone)
---
He played against an omega blink Nurse and got the 4 man escape, I doubt anything can stop him other than prayer beads or a red mori.
---
Hey there fictional guy haha
---
It doesnt say that in the wiki, im not doubting but ive never heard of it until now.
---
This shit has happened to me 2 times today
---
I do not like this picture, its smug aura mocks me
---
Yup. Killers need to not get mad at survivors doing the literal objective either.
---
Tell me this isn't real
---
I was saying 60 as a general idea not a fact. Even 70 is shit.
---
Why be mean to the killers man? They just want to enjoy the game.
---
It's not in the wiki? Odd, but I can say from experience that is the case.
---
I have taken all of this advice and it has significantly bettered by playing as the killer thank you all
---
I think this becomes especially bad when you go up against a competent hillbilly.
---
Small area to patrol + high mobility with insta down capabilities = kiss your *ss goodbye.
---
Nice!
---
Among us more experienced with the game, there's a sort of respect for newer (seeming) players, particularly ones that play as Dwight with the original outfit (the one you're wearing). These newer players are lovingly referred to as Baby Dwights (or, less commonly, Default Dwights), and, while some killers get off on bullying new players, a lot of killers will cut Baby Dwights a break
---
If you stick around in the game long enough to start encountering Baby Dwights of your own, don't forget to pay it forward and give them just a bit of leniency when you can
---
Speaking of Billy, I was hoping Billy (Stranger Things) would be a killer, but he was technically possessed and didn‚Äôt stand much chance against Demogorgon
---
What?
---
you do know ppl can lag switch on console right?
---
Imo it's mostly just the lack of facial expressions, I feel like if they changed with context they'd look a lot better
---
Quentin would still be a crack goblin but he'd look better
---
Cannibal is easily sitting right next to Legion. His power is extremely situational, and hardly ever works against anybody who has played the game for more than ten minutes.
---
Giving survivors abilities would make them too strong unless those abilities all sucked.
---
The reason identity v is so unbalanced is because survivors have abilities.
---
I also like seeing more than one survivor every game.
---
You misunderstand me. I had no intention of being mean to the Wraith, but I felt that entering a chase with one extra generator completed was more valuable to my team than entering a chase with full health and Dead Hard (I'm no No0b3).
---
The fact that the killer disconnected was (I felt) because I'd outplayed him, not because I was harassing him
---

---
I had people getting pissy with me for playing Clown/Pig in red ranks because of M E T A, that I purposely derank nowadays.
---
The beauty of teachable perks and base survivors is that you can create a build on whatever character you want without missing out on something like a special ability. I think by having a special passive it would make survivors overpowered, not to mention less fun and less customizable.
---
I would put billy in A considering you can loop him pretty damn good and spirit you cant so it seems weird to put them in the same spot
---
Skillchecks have no correlation with connection- though if you are staring towards the center of many maps you do get a laggier skillcheck.
---
Look straight away from it or straight up if you want
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
We salute this fellow Ash who uses flip flop to see Ash's face. Much respect.
---
Thats fair, but all you really have to do is get up behind, rev chainsaw, predict the jukes. I can see what you mean though.
---
From level 0 - it is roughly 44 levels (keep in mind u make more per level at level 25)
---
They take forever to me too, the other day i had to wait between 30 to 45 min while watching a show, finished it without finding a game. Survivors are like 1 min wait or so... Im in Alaska idk if it has something to do with it
---
Quentin is in a constant state of depression
---
I've never experienced lag switching. I've experienced ping drops and interruptions. I find console lag switching very uncommon. People also assume its something out of their control after their angry.

Killer: Negan

---
That's if they were doing a TWD DLC which I can't see happening tbh.
---
Better I suppose thank you.
---
The math on why camping ***can*** be bad is when someone is just trying to kill someone off.
---
The point is that camping becomes a good strategy when survivors play poorly (i.e. 1-3 survivors are literally are obviously roaming around the hook). Potxtoe's post literally says that "camping is a good strat ***depending on the situation***\*."\* In that case, camping becomes a good strat. Thus your response that "camping is never a good strategy" is absolutely nonsensical.
---
And there was no misunderstanding here. The post I responded to clearly stated: "camping is **never** a good strategy."
---
Yeah but imagine how disappointing it would be to have Negan...but not as a killer. Come on, they could even use his whistle as a lullaby like Huntress.
---
Coolest has always been for me Myers just because the way he shows no emotion in his body language is kinda like one of those things where if I saw him irl I'd be like fuck that
---
Scariest clown. Definitely clown. Hes spooky. He a clown. And he C O U G H.
---
I feel like that would be pretty OP. As it stands, trapper feels balanced to me. He's a lot easier for me to 4k with than nurse at purple ranks. But I know at red ranks as killer, most killers are obsolete so I can see where you're coming from. Maybe it could be an ultra rare add on or something.
---
I always want to do that one gen that‚Äôs the farthest away at the Stranger Things place, but then remember that it could be key late game.
---
I swear I've seen their whole thing in a movie but I cant remember what movie so if anybody knows where the inspiration of the legion group comes from lmk.
---
Oh no welp guess next season I'm sticking to rank 5 to 8
---
Nah Negan is the killer lol
---
Have you been watching the show? Currently? To the current season?
---
Has Spirit overtaken nurse as best killer now? Haven't played in a bit
---
Yes. I know he's not the guy he used to be but adding Negan as a survivor is dumb. So many other characters to choose from.
---
Dimma delete this
---
Once you start getting up in rank, you may notice a few survivors doing gens that are closer to the middle first instead of later in the game. Most gens in the middle are closer to each other, and when you get to the point when there are 3 gens left, some killers may have an advantage if the last 3 gens are close to each other. Some gens at Auto Haven are the best example of this.
---
I know. That could actually present a challenge for the people that work on the characters. But there must be a way to make her playable without her wearing the mask.
---
Many many others, yes. Daryl or Michonne would be awesome, personally
---
But Michael. 
---
Michael Myers.
---
Just beatin' that meat. 
---
I think he might transcend genre.
---
Well we know he's not using Dead Hard.
---
The Whisperers would be the killer, wearing a mask made from zombie flesh.
---
Hehehe

Precision!

New killer: The Librarian

Weapon: A hardback Stephen King book
---
How long ago did they promise dedicated servers, again?
---
I cry whenever we get Azarov's Resting Place cuz one person not knowing how this map works can fuck everyone over.
---
I can't even count the amount of games where we were a 3 man swf and the random still fucked us over cuz "oh, this gen is on the other side of the map, lemme fix it!"
---
Not to mention the fact that a smart hag player will never leave one side of the map, because Hag can't play on large maps unless she shrinks them by ignoring a part of it and this one divides itself.
---
"I have an idea for a map. Just make two boxes connected by a straight line. 3 gens in both boxes and one in the middle! This will be fun for both sides!" \~Someone at BHVR when the game was coming out.
---
There's a limit to that and you'll be stuck with the same build forever
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a hit that downs you isn‚Äôt considered a protection hit, it would be more of a sacrifice or suicide hit.
---
I think the Mind Flayer might have intelligence beyond a human, as it was pretty much controlling multiple at every time. But I don‚Äôt think Dart understood English, just sounds. Kinda like how dogs don‚Äôt understand English, but can understand commands, or sounds. Anyways, even if an animal is intelligent, it still has primal instincts, such as screaming after a hit to intimidate their prey (or something). Maybe it‚Äôs just being intelligent as you said, screaming in hopes that another demogorgon will hear it, and crawl out of one of the portals it has placed, because it is saying ‚Äúhey the prey is weak, let‚Äôs eat‚Äù
---
Its the metal pin.
---
congrats! :)
---
Ignoring how defensive you sound, when a Survivor DCs, they totally dick over their team. When a Killer DCs, the game is over and you can move on.
---
Though the devs did an awful job of managing totem spawns. Sometimes Ruin spawns right next to a Survivor and that's a 3 perk game gg.

Technically Freddy could be cleaning his weapon by flicking the blood off of this glove thingy, and staring at it for a couple of seconds to make sure it‚Äôs clean
---
There's 7 gens in each map, you need to complete 5 to power the gates and leave.
---
The gens are spaced roughly equally, but if you're not careful you can end up with the 3 final gens located in a triangle shape. If this happens, the killer can patrol them really easily, preventing you from getting much done.
---
To help prevent this, always try to do the gen in the center of the map first.
---
Edit: As u/BobTheBox *helpfully* pointed out, any 3 objects will form a triangle. That was helpful and not at all pedantic.
---
What I endeavored to communicate, is that the terminal power generating apparatus, of which there can be a trio of contenders, may possibly come to be adjacent to each other, making it trivial for the Killer to circumnavigate them within an unreasonably brief span of time.
---
Built-in smurfing, just alternate killers any time you want to stomp some rank 20s
---
Is this in r/madlads
---
5 is base without any stalking addons
---
I never understand why the hag is a killer of 110% movement speed she can be so fun if they make that small buff to her
---
Six or seven times I believe if Myers max stalkes every survivor.
---
Nurse is still the most powerful killer, it's just Spirit is a lot easier to play so she's a lot more common than nurse at high ranks
---
Once on the hook, press the action button to seduce the killer into taking you off the hook in order to suck your dick.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't count.
---
Last time i had someone get sour at me for 2nd to last slugging, i just told them not to get caught next time. They really liked that.

It's a fake article

Idk about Spirit, but i've had a hellava lot of Huntress' recently. And then I die trying to be altruistic, as it usually goes.

Its OK. If it takes no skill to play Doc, then that means it takes skill to win as a survivor against Doc. üòâ

Weird, why would hetero people like seeing porn of two people of the opposite sex over same sex?

Why the extra step, get them to suck you off right on the hook. Not only do you get head, but you also die: a two for one deal!
---
I am pretty sure Stephen King had a short story about an overdue library book and spiders.

firstly the gen speed is absolutely in favor of survivor seeing how no matter how fast u down survivors the gens can still be done in 4ms flat. due to this unbalanced objective killers use perks to slow gen speed down to have a fair chance at winning.

I haven't see anyone post it so I'm gonna assume it's not on the internet, big rips in chat

Demogorgon needs his own tier for REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Freddy is better than Michael and Ghostface, for sure. He's definitely in at least the top 5 killers.

---
I mean, it also has Barb's glasses, and the rat stuff from Season 3
---
You gotta get some Dark Sense up in this bitch! 
---
But seriously I always run dark sense, especially now that they buffed it. Spine chill tends to make me worse at evading the killer cus I can‚Äôt help but dart my eyes towards it when I see it activate. I end up focusing on whether it‚Äôs activating instead of looking at my surroundings for any signs of a stealth killer.
---
Male masturbating porn is gay/straight depending on who watches it
---
They already have different abilities, like Ace and Tapp the most silent survivors, Feng Min And Nancy has the smallest models which helps em to hide, Jeff the loudest and biggest survivor which made him "hardcore mode" survivor etc. And also we have  lot of Claudettes, yes, you know why.
---
I wouldn't call her fat because she doesn't look like she is an unhealthy weight, but she is not skinny.
---
&gt; think he might transcend genre
---
Myers is both comedy and horror
---
Even if they suspect there is someone there, after a decent amount of time without finding anything, if they keep looking by the hook it becomes camping regardless of intention. And if they do keep looking after not finding anything, it is the meme.

I like this, take my upvote good sir

Risky though he still might slug
---
We can always hope. There‚Äôs always time for things to turn around and make happen. But I really like the perk ideas. Wish it was a thing, because I would love to test them out.
---
Honestly though, I alternatively have games where the doors are so *far* from each other its a cake walk. This is better left alone
---
I get that sometimes, but more often for me it just deletes the daily altogether. Really annoying as i lost already 300k bloodpoints at least from that.
---
I think the idea of him being added in the game fits more of a killer role but his overall power and leadership could be better paired with skills of a survivor
---
I just got my first prayer beads at level 39 on spirit. Definitely not common for me
---
Before most of my games the gens got done, but killers mostly were able to get 2 kills. Sometimes more sometimes not. I disagree with your assessment that, no matter how fast you down survivors gens will still be done, or that the situation was somehow unbalanced. 
---
My shitpost is more my frustration that my last 20 games or so are 90% spirit and 100% are now using ruin/Dying Light (sometimes thana as well). Spending a lot of time just sitting there holding m1 on a generator, isn‚Äôt fun. you don‚Äôt actually get anything done because you got ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù by a killer using 3 slowdown perks.
---
That‚Äôs just brown rank mindset. Your basically risking getting you or your teammates down just to not be 1 shot...you should cleanse and loop the killer it‚Äôs a better strat than the killer having an AK-47 in her mouth
---
That's a bug which is going on for the last 2 patches... I dont know if they addressed yet, but I'm pretty sure they're aware of it. Happened many times to some streamers. I guess they're gonna fix it for the next patch

I line the edge of the map near gens usually. If you want a really powerful set up put two near each other. When you see one get destroyed you can travel by it and get the jump on a survivor or two

Newer consoles it‚Äôs realllllly rare that you find anyone with a lag switch  it‚Äôs harder to do on console

Spirit needs a headset and functioning ears to be one of the best killers in the gamez
---
Wish I were this good but it‚Äôs harder on console.

HEX: GAY III 
---
OKAY
---
Killer still has those three perks. You don‚Äôt get another Inner Strength effect since every survivor brought Inner Strength and there are no totems left.
---
Now, if you say ‚ÄúNot all the survivors brought Inner Strength! Consider only one did!‚Äù Okay, then the build is effective against 3 of the 4 survivors and is doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do.
---
Inner Strength doesn‚Äôt counter this build, it just delays the full strength of the build 5 times across all survivors with Inner Strength. It just negates 5 hits.
---
Doesn‚Äôt he already have addons that put survivors into injured state after escaping a trap
---
Mine have been everyday, it's hella annoying
---
I disagree but I guess that‚Äôs what makes us human eh
---
I was away for a weekend then all of a sudden all of my dailies were huntress related
---
Does not stack. Being injured, hooked or downed is a health state that affect Thanatophobia in the moment. So a survivor will always give no more than 4% decrease unless he's healthy or dead.
---
Nooch would beg to differ
---
photography tip: don't cut the obejct at their joints

You shouldnt need to heal yourself more than 1-2 times a match.

sure but pretty sure she uses a crosshair.

It's funny cuz I literally just had this ~~shouting match~~ discussion with someone like last week. 
---
I'd much rather have everyone able to take 2 shots than to be walking around exposed for the whole match. Just seems like common sense to me. 
---
My team recently cleansed against plague. She got 2 kills üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è as opposed to the whole team getting hooked after a single hit and she gets a 4k.

Does anyone else think the sound the wraith makes is satisfying?
---
They should stack... I mean it doesn't say they shouldn't do I would assume so.
---
I think the set up thing needs changing. All survivors have to do to "set up" is hop on a gen, which they can literally spawn next to. Setting up for killers varies for each killer, which may need no time to a ton of time to accomplish according to each killer's needs.
---
Ya know what sucks?
---
I‚Äôm a Myers main
---
Myers only has the prestige skin, which each part comes separately. You have to get to level 50 3 times to get the full skin. AND ALL IT FUCKING IS IS A BLOODY VERSION

*Each time you hook a Survivor, gain a token. While in a chase, press the Action Button to expose your genitals/breasts. Survivors Camera‚Äôs will be forced to stare at them for 10 seconds.*
---
*When this action is completed, lose 1 token.*
---
does anyone know how complicating fixing rng mechanics are? its a waste of time and resources when there are so much other things that I'd rather see given attention. As close as they can spawn and make it near impossible for the survivor they can also spawn on complete opposite sides and make it near impossible for the killer. Regardless though, I don't know how many people work at bvhr, but I'd rather see a long list of other things from both survivor and killers addressed off the top of my head.
---
I don't care how much I get down voted, this "issue" is piddly and insignificant to me.
---
Idk why it is the most common idea, but "killer that pretends to be a survivor" is by far the most suggested killer idea, and every time it's brought up it's immediately shut down since SWF groups would instantly destroy the ability and turn the killer into an M1
---
I mean it's a parody of a picture from an actual porn scene, so i guess it comes down to what youre into
---
*i showed u my Evil Within 4 pls reply*
---
Not trying to brag or talk shit but me and my friends never cleanse and MAX 2 people die
---
Kinda looks like he was seeing if he was gonna try to wiggle or not, after he didn't he's like "ight, I'ma let him go"
---
They are the biggest pussies. Had one myself a few days ago even though I was a survivor,like him. But that is sadly dbd, the game where some people have ego"s as big as skyscrapers
---
I always tea bag as GF.  I hope the survivors don't actually think I'm being toxic?  I mean I for sure don't play like that though.  Maybe I'm just not a high enough rank to understand the toxic yet.
---
so u teabag survivors who outplay you. cool
---
I'm not complaining about the gates when they spawn on complete opposite sides. This game is just as much about luck as it is about skill and strategy. cannibal can literally camp a hook with a 1hko, now THATS unfair
---
Holy shit, it's perfect
---
Why do so many porn artists inflate the size of breasts/ass x100?
---
Is that just monkey-brain *hurrrhurrrr bigger boob is hotter boob ooh ooh aah aah* or am I missing something? Why not just draw them naked **accurate** to the character?
---
Sorry I didnt back in the day just a few years ago even on this gen. It's definitely harder, but I've dealt with my fair share of em on current gen.
---
Braindead devs
---
And the mask he had down in upside down :o
---
You do you, we do what we want! If you want to waste time waiting for a locker to open that's on you
---
Negan easily works better as killer. He has an obvious weapon (Lucille) and a just as obvious mori (from his first meeting with the main characters). I'm not exactly sure what his power could be. 
---
It'd only really be perfect though if Jeffrey Dean Morgan were on board with it like Bruce Campbell, with the face modelling and the voice lines. Icing on the cake is if he had personalized insults for each survivor after hitting them
---
Currently Rank 2 if you‚Äôre asking, perhaps we just play against a different caliber of killers.
---
I guess that's true, they're only 1250!
---
That's what I always try to do, and I also always try to make sure that at least one gen is fixed on each side, but sometimes you can't have 160 seconds for yourself to do it. Sometimes you're the one getting chased or, even worse, you get downed and see 3 people doing different gens on the same side of the map

I mean, no. That‚Äôs literally incorrect.

Everybody knows that you get a +25% bonus to luck and Pallet loops while injured.
---
I don't know why I love this so much.
---
Translation: BEBE DWEEEET
---
You know what's funny? Every time I play a baby dweet I get tunneled and destroyed. Every time.
---
Especially if you‚Äôre playing Jane
---
Depends on your playstyle. If you want to be efficient but boring, Ruin and Sloppy and that stuff. I personally love to snipe from a distance and use Shadowborn (not essential, just personal preference) - BBQ - Nurses - Bitter Murmur (that one is not fixed, occasionally I take Surveillance, I‚Äòm All Ears could be good as well but I don‚Äôt have that).
---
Other popular perks used by experienced Huntress players are Whispers and Deerstalker. 
---
Enjoy Huntress.
---
But that's the thing, deadites can do that, and walk on walls , and lunge, and teleport, mutate into other things (one of them that is on the show and is huge would give the opportunity of getting pieces of survivers you kill around your body). It's such a varied enemy they could really just make up whatever and it would be believable, with almost any appearance, I just like the camo idea, but the same way freddy as blood or pallets maybe a choice on the type of power would be nice. It was just a wasted opportunity
---
As a survivor who‚Äôs actually been against a Freddy, would you say he needs a buff, nerf, or neither? As a Freddy main I feel like he needs a bit of a buff, but that‚Äôs just me.
---
*Oruumaitoo*
---
Survivors insane queue times? I've been readied as michael for over an hour and after watching some videos i forgot i was searching.
---
Negating 5 hits against some killers is strong, I‚Äôll give you that. But this is a Legion build. Looping is tough against his power and Legion is built to maximize putting you from Healthy to Wounded over and over.
---
Negating just 5 hits isn‚Äôt going to do much, sadly.
---
Honest question: Was there something said about walking dead?
---
Thank you lol. I honestly think it's a very underated perk
---
The fact that almost all of them have ‚Äúhad to do it to em‚Äù poses seems fitting
---
Best compliment I got today, thank you!
---
Everytime I play Plague and people don't cleanse, I wipe the floor with them. It's so easy when everyone's coughing and vomiting you can hear them a mile away and they're instadown. 
---
Corrupt is not as bad as people make it out to be. Yeah, it's an easy hit, but it's also on a timer, so you can drastically reduce it's effectiveness by just hiding. And I know people are gonna say that's stupid and being immersed is a horrible strategy but is that not what many already do against Mikey tier 3? Only difference between plague and Myers is that plague has to ***go*** and ***retrieve*** her power, so by the time she even gets to your gen that's 15-20 lost and you just have to wait out some 40 seconds. Less even because even with corrupt, downing more than one guy is tough if the first guy is even moderately effective at breaking LOS and taking cover.
---
I take it you have no clue how much exactly a deadite can do... Or else that wouldn't even be in question. It's like a skin, but that wouldn't even be close to a power. Also I play killer and survivor and I can't recall last time I played against a team of 4
---
All they did was start following them on twitter but people still made posts ‚ÄúNeGaN nEW sUrVivOr?!?‚Äù Or shit about a zombie killer
---
Lol so what difference does it make then? 2 people die either way so what you're telling me actually supports the argument of cleansing.
---
Bloody shape mains unite!
---
Meg by far. Don't need healing, DS, bond, or lockers if nothing can ever catch you
---
Lol who hurt you?
---
It also says they are 36 in another post so.
---
Thank you! I have been using 
---
Ruin / Rancor / corrupt intervention / sloppy butcher 
---
Corrupt has been helpful as I learn to play her since it pauses the game for 80 seconds for me.
---
Yeah exactly. Like if I were a plague main I would literally LOVE it if everyone walked around broken and coughing n shit.
---
What is this, do explain
---
 T H I C C
---
You're not missing anything it's exactly that.
---
I‚Äôve considered getting ghosty, I main Myers so should I?
---
As a flair man myself imma say yea.
---
If you get hooked twice and lose the killer at least once you need 3 totems. But that does not happen every match, though. Still, the more uncleansed totems you have available to you on the map, the shorter the time you spend looking for them.
---
He could use a small buff but I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôd go about it..  Though borrowed time now not working in dream state is something he definitely needed.
---
Just keep practising, he‚Äôs fairly solid at shutting down loops with either pallets or snares.  Your biggest issue will be SWF calling out your traps and teleports.  Check out some of the red rank streamers using Freddy, you might be able to pick up a few extra strategies.
---
You mean the three best perks in the game? Ace Mains rise up
---
I don't know what logic people used to say "Don't cleanse and stay no mither"
---
But it doesn't work out, just like no mither
---
I finally saw a couple teams play against tru3talent and 100% cleanse and they SHIT on him, he finally the said words that I believe to be true. "Maybe cleansing is the best play"
---
But it's true, only if your WHOLE TEAM cleanses. 
---
If you got people playing no cleanse and you cleanse they're fucked, but you're fine. 
---
So fuck you guys I'm drinking that water while you play no mither thinking that shit you saw a streamer/team do is a solid strat
---
Lol killers have and still are complaining about teabagging.
---
That was actually a developers response. Gates coming down to RNG is what they described as balanced. Some games the gates will be next door, in favor of the killer, some games they'll be in different Zip codes, in favor of the survivor.
---
I never did watch any of the movie I did read the comic with Ash vs Freddy vs Jason but even let‚Äôs say they let him walk on walls or turn into other things what about the corn map? Wall walking useless and what would they turn into? Other killers I do think if let‚Äôs say doctor had a change where his power can make hallucinations of other killers would be cool
---
I got rank 1 with Ghostface 2 months ago
---
Just gets annoying seeing this same idea every day with zero ways to implement
---
and if you also have head on you can force it down their throat when you're finished which stuns them for 5 seconds
---
Fair enough, legions deep wound can really be a bitch especially with the broken addon. Still against other killers inner strength rocks
---
Well, you're just a ray of sunshine!
---
Because of variety for survivors. Survivors are just skins right now since they have no unique trait. Just thinking about squadettes and red ranks is a poor way to think about it since the majority of players aren't up there, hell I dont even think they even care about going to red rank. Once you've been there once it's pointless.
---
Yes I am a freaking beam of joy, thank you very much, if you don't want perk that arnt good to show up in the bloodweb, don't lvl to the teachable.
---
Ah hello Legion
---
Sounds like goosebumps to me
---
Aa a Killer main I would prefer being teabagged all day rather than people DCing.
---
Teabegging is toxic but it doesn't really hurt me in any way and I have a strange satisfaction in hooking teabaggers.
---
DCing on the other hand most importantly ruins my enjoyment of the game and secondly it gives me no chances to have a good score... 
---
I'm seeing a lot of people here complaining about slugging and facecamping and they are not even in the same league as DCing. I never facecamp, not even the most toxic players, cuz I dont enjoy playing like that but it's way better than DCing
---
Wait, so what‚Äôs with the spook skins?
---
Lol thats why i dont wait at pallets, unless its Clown
---
I'm totally fine with ds post rework. Before it felt too cheap, I refused to use it for how easy and broken it was
---
Now it's fine, if the killer make the wrong choice you get an easy stun. Same thing if you get it's attention in the right way, he was just salty I guess
---
DS is fine even if sometimes actually hit when you are trying to go for fresh hooks
---
You don't get it. With passives THERE IS NO VARIETY. Because people will only want to use the 'meta' survivors. With the way it is now, people are allowed to play as whichever character they want without being pressured to play the 'better' one. The day people start getting shamed for not picking the strongest survivor is the day MANY people will run from this game.
---
Shut up and let him do what he wants
---
Is this a serious question?
---
Things we need to know!!
---
Meyers is S tier for weapon staring
---
I love running dream pallets against pallet spammers. So satisfying. I do wish some of his add one had different effects though, since some of the dream pallet ones are semi useless. Like the one that reveals the aura of whoever dropped the pallet for 4 seconds, just why?
---
Who stacks pallets like that? And why? Is this New Dehli Jenga?
---
You deserve your shit you get fucked if you run ruin dude
---
not a leatherface one ? cuz if they do, I'll pay you to send it to me lmao
---
Freddy is at least A tier
---
Pig is at least C tier
---
Trapper is C tier
---
Leatherface is lower than legion
---
People making fun of you and mocking you in your Steam Profile does not deserve to stay there because it's not representative of how you play in the game and whether you were fair etc. 
---
But they will do it and some survivors (Who I've personally fucked while playing akin to their "rulebook") love to recomment that I played really really scummy and that's just not what my gameplay is, ever, they just really hated I out-mindgamed them at tons of loops and shit. The salt is real with survivors almost 24/7 because they feel they are never in the wrong and can never do wrong, I'll copy paste what I said to someone the other day who was looking to have fun on Killer while not being mocked/teabagged by Survivors:
---
"If "we" win the Killer is OP, the Killers Perks are OP, the Killers addons are OP, the Killer Camped, the Killer Tunnelled or the Killer Exploited. Never down to their own (failing) skill. Ours. Every fucking day.
---
If the Killer loses, we're a baby, a noob, an ez clap, survivor perks are not OP, survivor items are not OP and survivor addons are not OP.
---
It's all down to us, the Killers, it's our fault, everything.
---
Apparently."
---
Had that happen to me. Played against Hag, cleansed two hex totems at the cost of being hooked. Neither of them was Ruin.
---
Honestly all you can do is laugh when their bodies do full flips from hatchets.
---
It's honestly a joke, i only wish i had that luck as a survivor
---
Of course it can all the devs have to do is port dead by daylight to the Soulja Boy Console.
---
I get that it is but I mean even on a lesser extent of this clip, the tea bagging without the context of being tunneled earlier.  I get t-bagged by survivors on other side of a pallet and it doesn't make me mad.  Just kinda laugh and say well now I'm going to kill ya for sure lol.  Like I said I think when I hit rank 7 and below I'll start understanding real toxicness and frustration maybe.  Right now for me it's usually easy 4ks with 1/4 games being completely destroyed.  I think it's the games with SWF or one really good looper.  Also just started survivor games and it's tougher than killer for sure.  At least imo.
---
Somehow this reminds me of most of Monto's "blah, blah, blah, "only" games.
---
You gotta HAND it to them for their determination though.
---
Loved the way he looked down and thought about the little baby dweet
---
Happened to me yesterday. I left a Dwight to slug almost all the bar to chase his friend. During they chase I've seen the hatch but he decided to wiggle off my arms. I closed the hatch :P
---
You a hoe.
---
Maybe give him two powers to choose from like freddy and them it would be a gamble. Billie's chainsaw can get pretty useless depending on the map, and don't get me started on Freddy's puddle power, it's an obvious trap that doesn't trap. The idea would be the skin to mimic other survivers, but that couldn't be the whole power obviously, it's jist interesting. (Now I did love the idea of Doctor playing mind trucks like that. But someone said that power would be cool if they added Pennywise (something about showing a different killer to cause misinformation between swf  and get survivors confused on strategy)
---
So we are furrying/scalifying(?) the forest woman. Question is, why?
---
The Pig and Ghostface definitely have O.C.D. tendencies.
---
They multiply through division.
---
In your example you're saying Squadette is the best and there is no variety... so if there is a unique passive to a survivor... there would be variety...
---
I actually felt proud haha been working hard at studying my Japanese
---
For killers, yeah
---
For survivors. Not really, no. They all play the same, the difference is how many perks you have in each character. That's it
---
The funny thing about this post is: Even the devs will see it (and hopefully chuckle). All the big streamers. The uptight people. The insecure people who will feel offended by it. We truly are a weird subreddit. I love it. &lt;3

Buy a very cheap second hand pc or laptop and plug it in if you're curious

If an addon doesn't stack it'll say "doesn't stack" in it's icon. Goes for all addons.

huh

Posted the exact same thing and got 20 upvotes. I guess I gotta learn how to writer proper descriptions.
---
That first one... I must have

I mean based on all the posts I think either would be weird
---
That‚Äôs just killer disconnecting immediately lol.
---
Nice bias. Yes keep telling yourself killers are angels. When a killer DCs it's just as annoying, no matter what you tell yourself. Stop acting like they can do no wrong.

The correct answer is ‚ÄúFloating Judo Kicking Myers‚Äù

Dead Hard, Iron Will, and Decisive are basically required perks at red ranks

Yes daddy

It‚Äôs like seeing a unicorn
---
What rank are you?  Just curious.
---
So true.... happened to many times, when i outsmart them or dominate the game as killer i get attacked with messages almost every time.... i feel like most survivors are 12 yr old spoiled brat's.... i love dead by daylight, but the people that play it not so much...
---
For me it‚Äôs literally no mither and object of obsession. The game is adamant on me playing hard mode.

Honestly I feel that way with iridescent head

Pretty sure it was a glitch. But yeah it's real.

Nancy's face looks like a meth addict, which makes her super shippable with Quentin.
---
These aren't veteran players lol
---
I've heard that they're going to nerf some of her addons.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the down votes. 
---
I‚Äôm at 160hrs, and I feel like I‚Äôve gotten better but definitely not good. I can‚Äôt loop or chase to save my life, I usually end up 3rd in points on my team, and I have to play specific killers with specific perks to get 2+ Kills.
---
I honestly think I probably switch up too often. I don‚Äôt stick with survivor or killer and I mess around with different killers. That being said I just enjoy the game, and don‚Äôt worry about ranks... wish I could work back down to 15ish on survivor. I think that‚Äôs where I had the most fun.
---
But imagine it could have anything inside and you would never know.
---
For some reason, this is me now since I've ranked up. Low ranks, I was suuuuper cautious about pallets and always respected them. Now that I'm mid-rank, I'm eating them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
---
Caught up in the kill.
---
i think they are neat
---
Wazaaaa?
---
Legion is fun tho. FF may not be a great power, but its fun
---
Agreed
---
What are we meant to be looking at?
---
Nah I've had games where I died and the other survivors were in the game and that still happened. In fact every game is like that.
---
Yup.. too bad most of the time they are nearby. If not, easy escape. Shouldn't be a problem
---
But the zombies r weak af tho
---
i meant by veteran as they unlocked most teachable perks maybe i should have used old players? not sure what term to call them tbh
---
From what I know, umbra at least used to use tape but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case anymore, either software or something with her monitor‚Äôs settings most likely now.  For Zubat and Scott it‚Äôs software afaik.
---
I can‚Äôt say with certainty, I just know they all use them.
---
That perk actually sounds really cool- They ought to take it out of the game though so they can't hack it anymore
---
Yep same I get dailies deleted what the hell
---
Discord for dbd
---
Queue times are horrendous, lobby dodging is at an all-time high, the Spirit is slowly starting to overtake the Nurse, and the nurse is getting her addons nerfed and allegedly a slight nerf to her base kit (which will almost certainly put the Spirit at #1)
---
The most badass is Ghostface, he's got style. Maybe it's because the designers are improving with each new killer, but his animations are full of character.
---
The scariest looking is the one that started it all, the Trapper. I'd say Clown, but I imagine he'd be easier to outrun.
---
I play quite a bit of solo as well, but I do certainly see your point. 
---
And you know, come to think of it... I do run Bond every game so it‚Äôs entirely possible that I am just hyper-aware of it because I often see it happen before my eyes without a doubt, which somehow makes it worse. 
---
I usually try to give the benefit of the doubt to flee-the-sceners but I definitely groan a bit when 5-6 minutes passes without a gen pop or a dead Ruin.
---
You gotta realize.. some people are just brain dead. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúfarming‚Äù before.. brought people to gens.. gates.. teammates etc, and still had someone try and brag about ‚Äúwinning.‚Äù Luckily most of the time the rest of them have brains and laugh at them for being so clueless. It‚Äôs an ego boost for people to believe they‚Äôre amazing. They could have crouched around the map all game never touched a gen and they‚Äôd still ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù in post game chat. Not everyone who plays this game has a head on their shoulders.
---
I heard rank will finally mean something once the archive content goes live.
---
You are doing it right! Keep at it
---
The guy on the left is me when I‚Äôm playing halo jenga tower.
---
so honestly, the ends to which legions power affects a survivor is similar to a couple other ones. after getting affected by the power, the survivor has to take some sort of action that takes time to complete. (bear traps, RBTS, madness tiers, waking up, cleansing if you're BOOSTED) 
---
the issue with legions is that its pretty terrible. 
---
whereas other killers have these effects and more, this is all legion has. and frankly (pun intended), if they did have additional abilities, they would probably be very much on the strong side. as it stands now, legion is a group destroying ultra perk reliant m1 killer that has a normal TR and very little to compensate for it. 
---
still better then bubba tho. also, if you haven't tried it, try the dark devotion franks stabby build. you will lose, but it is hilarious to kill at least one person with it.
---
I think if someone made an app for stuff like this. A DBD wiki app or something of the sort. I have one for games like D2, NMS, SoT, etc. Would make things a lot easier than constantly having to type it all out.
---
Legion should be in D tier at least IMO
---
As a person who plays some Plague every now and then, I must say that their perma-injured status is a gift and a curse at the same time. They are one shot, BUT they don't need to waste time healing, ever, which makes them spend all their time on gen. I mean, even if you are playing someone with instant downs in base kit, like Billy, Bubba, Michael or Ghostface, they still spend their time healing after unhook.
---
I found a clown
---
It‚Äôs a lose/lose for him in that situation when he stands there. Unless he drops it perfectly at the last second on you, stunning you but not breaking it. He either takes the hit, instantly destroys a pallet, occasionally both, or runs away when you lunge but you‚Äôve already gained the distance on him by that point
---
Uncannily like the Plague. I'd be surprised if one design was not inspired by the other...
---
Well, the most important thing a Killer can have is their fundementals; that is time management, looping, slugging. 
---
Doesn't really matter if the rank 1 Ghostface main can't hit a chainsaw with Hillbilly. They'll still destroy the baby survs. Especially when rank 20 survs are to afraid to touch a gen.
---
Get a burner laptop not connected to the internet

Being a coward is helpful because hey if they can't find ya they'll go somewhere else and chase them allowing you to do generators etc etc, to counter camping,slugging etc use unbreakable to pick yourself off the ground,  camaraderie so it completely stops the struggle timer, DS obviously and good ol adrenaline for getting a health state. That's all I got for going against megamind killers but for specific ones I would be able to help alot more.
---
Firmly grasp it.
---
It does sometimes end immediately even if the killer hasn‚Äôt left the lobby yet. Also on ps4 after almost every game it looks like the killer left the lobby immediately after the game ended although they didn‚Äôt
---
He wasn't in a locker for once?!
---
I am that one. Lol.
---
That would be 20x worse
---
But if the entity want to feed on survivors emotions they could do that by torturing them without allowing escape. Theoretically vigo figured out how to manipulate the entity's realm and poked holes into it to create hope for survivors and to buy time so that he could figure how to escape for good. That's my head canon
---
I got a skill check as soon as someone went down and surge popped the gen. I literally got a forced skillcheck fail lmao.
---
Wouldn't Spirit's cool down be considered a trick since she makes her weapon disappear?
---
So DS, Adrenaline and Dead hard is considered bullying?
---
That's like red rank surv meta. even 4 solo queuers will likely have that. I don't see how that's bullying?
---
Changing last second was obviously to avoid franklins - Side note, kinda weird the killer gets to see your items before picking their perks and addons.
---
----
---
Afterlobby they was all being toxic, killer was no exception there. Dare I say she even started it.
---
thank you, I love you!!
---
How fucking dare you
---
Anyone could say the same to you by just looking at your profile for 0.5s
---
What would this look like for killers?
---
Trappers start with two gens already completed
---
Wraiths automatically disconnect after 5 minutes
---
Hillbillys force the map to spawn with 5 fewer pallets; also auto-dc on Lery's and Hawkins
---
Nurse's terror radius is expanded to the entire size of the map
---
Myers no longer has a terror radius... so no big change there
---
Leatherface gets 3x bloodpoints (because there needs to be SOME reason to play him)
---
Legion disables healing
---
First thing I do when zoning in is a quick look around to see if I spawned next to ruin lol
---
Would not be allowed in China so doubtful
---
Eventually you grow numb to just torture, but throw hope in the mix and it lasts for much longer.
---
I usually let the last person go/get the Hatch anyways. As of lately, since the new SWF Lobbies, people have been WAY more toxic and cocky about getting the Hatch. (In my experience, at least.)
---
When iam rank 10 and a bunch of rank 20s enter my lobby and cleanse when mildly sick
---
Never said any of that. Thanks for proving my point. Stay mad.

Ace is the one true survivor
---
Ad hominem typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument
---
I‚Äôve been grinding out Myers this past week. That bloody mask is sexy. The bloody body suit looks like he covered himself in shit though.
---
I don't understand your question
---
Caffeinated-double speed games
---
The gangs all here-8 survivors, 2 killers, 12 gens
---
mirror mode- survivors and killers swap models
---
There's my ride-gens move on there own
---
The last game you'll ever play -the game map, but like 4 times bigger,
---
For my next trick-jumping in lockers teleports you to another locker (killers can do this too)
---
What the hex?- 15 hex totems on map, all random, (stats altered obviously)
---
Beach day- dbd volleyball game mode
---
Perk roulette- 2 random perks change every 30 seconds
---
Wrong way- 8 exit gates, only 1 is an actual escape, wrong gates throw you to the basement.
---
Maize maze- giant corn maze to exits, but killer is twice the size
---
No pressure- 3 gens to do, twice as many skill checks, failed checks injure you
---
I disagree that those perks are bullying, my point was more how they acted postgame.
---
My walls looks exactly the same. Are you Meyers?
---
Use iron maiden, infantry belt and a windup or cooldown time add on and just let em rip. Often, when a survivor doesn't think you'll hit a long shot they will stand there and bait giving you a second chance. After a while, making adjustments becomes second nature. Don't be afraid to throw, that's key. Hitting trees counts for intimidation too üòÅ
---
Just make them not be rank 20 for obvious reasons.
---
If you reach rank one (or red ranks) with one killer for example, every killer will start off at rank 15-12~
---
Easy
---
You're the one who pmed me like a survivor main tho..
---
You become the very thing you swore to destroy
---
Claudette OP XD
---
You know how people have u/(insert name here.) then a killers name like legion or ghostface highlighted in blue
---
Or just separate it so that everyone can enjoy what they want
---
Theres a 0% chance that is 100% not the case.
---
What??? Theres been survivor nerfs in every patch since The Pig.
---
Yes, which is what the meme is about; the Nvidia control panel
---
The secret is to run Enduring and never respect pallets. What stun?
---
Nah, cause swf would just tell you if they're getting chased or not. So your teammates can look directly at the gen and gen rush with toolboxes and prove thyself.
---
nothing like that refreshing wholesomeness in this community. thanks OP (:
---
I wanna play against more Nurses. If that means getting stomped by PC ones sign me up.
---
YES
---
There's no need for that, since you may as well just delete them if that were the case. If you dedicate an entire perk slot to lessen the chance to be ambushed, instead of a meta perk, that could actually work to the killers favor in the long run.
---
Also they aren't like Object of Obsession, which gives free infinite wallhacks on their exact position and actions at all times; they indicate the general direction of the killer within a certain distance, but everything else is up to the player's interpretation.
---
You got the answer in a diff post, so I wont go there. But wanted to say, you've probably seen it happening. Ever feel like a killer is guarding a particular gen you are trying to work on ? There is a chance he's 3 gen blocking. Some killers will guard 3 gens close together from the start.
---
YoU aRe ToXiC rAnK 1 oNe ScUm FoR sLuGiNg

This is the only meme on here that‚Äôs actually made me laugh. Thanks

Oh so that's why I'm a pussy...
---
I feel like you are specifically talking about  Apparitia  for some reason.
---
Delicious, finally some good fucking shitposts
---
&gt; or Freddy
---
you mean forever freddy.
---
That's exactly what I do. I'm giving them a second chance out of empathy or mercy, and they're trying to escape from me even when I made it clear I wasn't going to kill them? No way.
---
Yeah I wish they could make it more visually clear. 
---
Maybe make his claw extend like it did sometimes in the movies? When he swings he gets claws like the [the blind guy from Resident Evil 4.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UCpSAF7nBeQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

No matter killer or survivor, if you salt DC you are a fucking bitch.

It isnt

#deletespirit2019
---
Okay, I wanna see what happens if all 4 plus killer does it would be cool
---
It does! I'm not sure if it does 4x the fog, but it may double up.
---
And sadly I will be joining the trends of being a Spirit main. Thirty levels into P3 on her and she be rocking the cancerous perks already.
---
**YOU ROCK**:
---
**YOU SUCK**:  ~~IIII~~ I
---
Some of her add ons are getting changes to make them less overtuned.
---
You can read about it in a dev blog post, over [here.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/) This link will lead you there. Not all of the changes had been revealed yet but that is an example.
---
Doesn't the pig just retract her arm blade? I'd argue she's below Myers. She literally gets blood in all the mechanisms she uses to operate her weapon. She doesn't clean it, she makes it *worse*.
---
Also, I'm pretty sure Doc's "trick" is just slapping the owie stick on his hand. I demand he receive his own "that's a paddlin'" tier.
---
Seriously though, great stuff. Very important tier list, have another orange slice for your efforts.
---
On ice?
---
Oh finally. Thanks bro
---
Just puke calcium, or gold
---
There was an old ultra rare offering called New Moon Bouquet. If everyone brought the offering, the map would be pitch black. They removed it from the game for obvious reasons. I don't for sure if the reagents to thicken the mist are stackable, but apparently yes.
---
I would love this and whenever I play survivor I'll never use perks again
---
Even more if all 4 survivors are checking each spot!
---
Use windstorm green and purple on wraith, you run so fast survivors dont believe it's actually you
---
For Nurse you need to have a basic idea of what you are doing.
---
For Spirit you need a somewhat decent headset and you are good to go. You can outplay everyone with the fun and interactive stand still "mindgame".
---
Like he said in the video they can still find ways to leave the match within 2 minutes. How are they going to validate people killing themselfs on the hook?
---
Find a locker after unhook if they chase u again. U gonna be live longer
---
So does this mean Spine Chill/Premonition/ObjectOfObsession/etc no longer work on Pig while crouched?
---
I haven‚Äôt researched much on what the new Undetectable state does.
---
Just don't level up ace *taps head*
---
Sounds legit
---
Don‚Äôt downvote this man, otzdarva has a video on this, he‚Äôs literally right
---
It's so damn bad as I've had moments where I've sat on a hill on Autohavens to watch both gates for the last survivor.
---
You okay mate?
---
No fucking shit
---
Plus, at red ranks survivors have all the same build, i guess killer mains are also tired, but hey, if you say something against survs you get blasted nowadays so idk
---
Would be great wallpaper for wallpaper engine
---
it was a perk that lots of u killer mains cried about instead of working around it....u r all a joke lmao
---
great idea
---
Iron Will and Balanced are Meta 100%, plus Lithe its better than sprint burst and Resilince should be ther.
---
Troglodyte, spilled my tea reading that! Yeah, I am!
---
You right i shouldnt care. but if you play killer and you gain hate from the survivors over and over again It somehow still triggers you. Gotta love dbd
---
I did this the other day, it was great until I got tunneled and died ;(
---
Doesn't his knife have a blade on one side?
---
Guess it got your attention, huh?
---
Why do you need validation from strangers online? Who cares lol
---
Not at all. Two exit gates being split apart is not a stand off at all. It's killer making a choice and hoping it's the right one. It's risk that comes with being able to close the hatch.
---
wow wow will chucky be the next killer?
---
Not a big surprise tbh
---
New Killer: The Pallet, able to slam victims face into its own wood, knocks them down instantly.
---
oh hey, I still remember your clip of this lol
---
Only time I've used beads was for finishing the silent approach achievement and a couple days ago when I really needed a double pip to get my rank 5 achievement.
---
This is OP on Freddy
---
You can interrupt certain survivor actions, such as doing gens or cleansing your thrill of the hunt. Press the attack button to grab them.
---
I think that's the red rank killer defense mechanism. If you play Spirit, more often than not you won't be dropping any games if you're halfway decent. 
---
I switch to Spirit the minute I see a SWF 4 stack. Just in case. If you don't play it safe you'll find yourself on the end of ridicule, tbagging, clicking flashlights and spam party invites. 
---
Don't blame killers for literally only playing Nurse and Spirit after a certain point. Blame Toxic SWF for forcing their hands. Some killers are just unplayable against a toxic SWF even if you're good and if you want to guarantee the victory well, you know what to do.
---
Remember that Otzdarva video where he went against a toxic SWF and he said "and you wonder why you only play against Nurses and Spirits" well, now you know.
---
I know what you mean. When I started out I was under the impression I am "playing the game wrong" and only learned over time that most of them are just toxic entitled cunts that would say anything to shift the blame on you for their own failures.
---
9/10 times, survivors die because they made bad decisions. And they don't cope well with that.
---
Literally nothing, she is just slowed down for a second.
---
What map is this?
---
You‚Äôre just too fuckin‚Äô immature to grasp the concept of being the better person.
---
If someone has bad manners the worst thing you can do is to mock him by being just as low as he/she is.
---
Are you still living in the medieval times where God was the answer to everything and the law was basically eye for an eye which roughly translates to your ‚Äútaste of his own medicine‚Äù nonsense.

Thought that was Dwight for some reason calling to let her know he just finished painting the lockers.

So humiliated. How am I gonna go on?

Yes.

u wanna talk about broken? hmmm nurses addons...thats 3 plus years right? lmao
---
I so wanted Sydney Prescott as a survivor. Not only that, I wish they modeled Laurie after Jamie Lee Curtis and Freddie after Robert Englund, the same treatment they gave to the Stranger Things chapter with Nancy and Steve.
---
One idea I have for a Sidney perk is to make the pallet stun on the killer last a little longer. It's funny when you think about how the idea of throwing objects to stall the killer probably came from the Scream movies.
---
This is a really cool idea. It's different than typical balancing of just changing numbers, plays into the psychology of the game.
---
sure buds...:)
---
But a big part of them is the ability to blend in. I don't really want it as a power but as more of a fun thing on the side.one way to implement easily is becoming the person you just killed on hook, doesn't really make a difference gameplay wise. It's just a different dynamic
---
No mither is supposed to only be good when used with self care and inner strength.
---
I think they just let it happen occasionally
---
Give credit at least
---
Or a Leatherface that doesn‚Äôt camp
---
What is a pallet spammer? Just someone who uses pallets? Why does that have a name
---
Wanna talk about infinities that still in the game? :D come on lil survivor main, don't make me laugh
---
At least I recognize the flaw of both sides, you play only one which is even more sad
---
Edit: u/leakingpickle glad you keep chasing me with that fake account ^^
---
I've had it happen for nea
---
He must be confident in his gloves
---
Well, I was. Usually I get new Killer to 40 then give them straight to Billy. I had a fresh bloodweb on him so I guess I assumed he had them. I refeshed the web and low and behold Demi's perks show up. I get two of them then the perks page went to 5 pages. I have a lot of hours and Demi's perks arent so awesome that I even wanted them on Billy so I assumed something was wrong. When I read you question I thought it was absurd but had enough doubt to check so thanks for that moment. I am, however, 100% certain the Propain Hammer is not there which I supose Im more upset about. Thank you again for suggestion. I am fool
---
Does Spirit Fury without Enduring ever work out in a down for you? Honest question, I've never tried it without Enduring before.
---
Oh, certainly agree with you. Inner Strength deserves its spot more times than not. This just happens to be one of those rare situations that doesn‚Äôt really care that you get an 8 second heal because it‚Äôs looking to wound you so many times you don‚Äôt know what to do with yourself.
---
The thickest mist that you can get is by stacking a Murky Reagent and a Faint Reagent. Stacking more than that would just mean a waste since the max fog thickness value is capped.
---
this is pretty funny. is this even real? cause that Peepee looks photoshopped.
---
I like stabbing people.
---
Oh didn't notice. Hi u/leakingpickle . again with that account?
---
Woodup?!
---
It stacks with the survivor equivalent, eg -4 stacks with +1
---
I think its RNG so that sometimes it's on the killers side or the survivors side. That's fair I guess. If they did it so that it only helped survivors that would be alienating like half of the player base. Vice Versa.
---
What's that?
---
You did nothing wrong and they are just being intitled survivor mains.      They wont be happy til they win every match without much effort.      There is a reason that killer queue times are terrible but survivor times are pretty good.   Its cause there are 10 times more survivor mains than killer mains since at lower ranks survivors win most times unless going against nurse or spirit which is needed to fight people like them if they were decent.
---
Let me nope, the fuck out of here!

---
No you dumb bitch you missed my point. Completly.

My point was, this time read slowly:

You have been downvoted on your older posts, it could probably be because you act like a cunt
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Thank you!!
---
New skin?
---
EW1 has 2 downsides: small lunge and less movement speed (105% instead of 115% in EW2/EW3)
---
Noed is waste of perk slot but when a survivor use all meta perk in swf then im really sorry for not doing red huntress addon noed and bloodwarden because thats what these fks deserve. If i see solo survivor left behind i let them go if i know they wont go back for him. If i stomp survivors then i let one of them go.
---
Nah, make that the brutal animation.
---
(idk having brutal strength in 100% of games kinda sounds interesting to me)
---
It slows the game down somewhat
---
The difference between one new moon bouquet and 4 doesn‚Äôt exist because it simply sets the map to the darkest light.
---
However thickest mist and new moon was the shit lmao
---
You don‚Äôt chase as Hag,
---
I didn't know who this belongs to
---
Killer queues are longer, yup. Nothing we can do about it.
---
Either play both sides, which is beneficial or suck up the queue times.
---
Cheers
---
You cant Change the que time :/ its just how it is and i Hope bhvr is finding a solution.
---
Nurse, spirit, billy, huntress are all fine. If you‚Äôre really good, you can probably get away with other characters. Seen good killer streamers get 4ks with speed limiter bubba at red rank ffs, lol.
---
They need to make it so if you disconnect multiple times a week (or certain time period), you have to wait longer and longer to join lobbies. Say, after your 2nd or 3rd, you have a 30 min penalty before you can join a game. If you disconnect 5 times within a certain time period, you have to wait 12 hours, or a day or two?
---
No they were dumb and trying to take advantage of a made up player-honor code.
---
I've had people insta unhook infront of my face and downed them for them to call me a camper. I haven't even moved from the fucking hook and your trying to unhook, are you serious?
---
"I'll try my hardest"
---
*presses esc and the disconnect button*
---
damn. that was a lot of effort on both you and the killers part
---
Still. They ended up at red ranks anyway and 4 swf is just way stronger than 2 swf. Isn't comparable
---
PS4 or Xbox?
---
Because I think we played the same Doc, though mine was days ago. He did the exact same thing to me and my friends.
---
Detroit become pallet
---
That‚Äôs all it took? Damn that guy ain‚Äôt gonna make it in high ranks lmao
---
PS4 but mine was just a few hours ago
---
He da MVP
---
On the flip side, if a killer got absolutely zero kills before NOED, this might indicate bullying
---
Pallet eat you
---
It's good advice, thank you! But I think you may have misread. I was more curious about que times. I have no problem getting stomped, I only have a problem with the fact getting stomped takes less time than finding another match after.
---
Now that's a bigass blade !

---
Legion isn't a trashcan
---
I rate your stuff 2/10
---
fix it and you'll get 11/10
---
I do play both sides, of course! I just want something a little less intense than the pure adrenaline that is being new to survivor. It was mainly a bummer that in an hour I'd do 4 or so matches.
---
replace perk icon files
---
Aww, understood. Thanks!
---
Wazzzzzzaaaaaah fuck that hurt
---
replace camaraderie by Borrow time and replace spine chill by adreline and you got yourself a good build
---
Also can we somehow take away or change the music when in the broken state?
---
This game should not have tournament play its ridiculous to balance around that. its a casual game
---
Same bud, though people ussualy say gg ez for me, and most of the time I'm going against swf these days.
---
You can also escape and not get a pip
---
You can also die and 2 pip
---
and on the other side
---
You can also kill all 4 survivors and depip
---
And when farming, you can not kill anyone and almost 2pip
---
it does( im the op from another account)
---
Demo is humanoid tho
---
A big one ive seen developing lately is people being so scared to "farm" you they just let your die or go struggle state, even if im instadowned again it wastes some time
---
When I'm playing as Claudette (she's my main) my build is:
---
**Inner Strenght (Nancy only)** - If you cleanse a totem and get inside a locker, you can heal yourself after 10/9/8 seconds. **Small Game (free for everyone)** - Very useful to locate totems to heal yourself with Inner Strenght, cleanse hexes or just avoid NOED. **We're Gonna Live Forever (David only)** - Essencial to farm bloodpoints but you have to be careful when being altruistic as that can cost your teammates lives or your own. It's best when used with Borrowed Time. **Borrowed Time (Bill only)** - Will give campers a hard time. If being fully altruistic is your gameplay style, you need this perk more than anything.
---
When I'm playing as a Dwight, a Meg, a David or a Jake I usually run these perks:
---
**Self-care (Claudette only)** - Use it wiselly as you can waste a lot of time by healing yourself with this perk. If I get hooked or lost the killer and there are 5 or 4 gens left, I prefer to do gens instead of healing myself. If there's 1 gen left and you have Adrenaline do not bother to heal and wait till the last gen pop up. **Iron Will (Jake only)** - It can make all the difference when being chased by the killer or just hidding from sight. It won't work everytime, specially against experienced killers, but it's worth trying. **Borrowed Time (already explained)**. **Adrenaline (Meg only)** - It gives you a speed boost and heal one state of health. So, when the perk is active, if you're lying on the ground, you instantly get up.
---
When I'm playing Ace:
---
**Self-care (already explained)**. **Plunderer's Instinct (unlocked for everyone)** - If the hatch spawned with more than one survivor still alive, or of you are the last survivor and the killer found it and closed it, you can try to retrieve a key from one of the chests and open/reopen the hatch. This strategy has worked for me a few times, but it's relatively rare to find a key inside a chest. Also, keep in mind that if the other survivors open the chests it will make this perk useless. **Borrowed Time and Adrenaline**. 
---
When I'm playing as Detective Tapp I use the same meta perks that I mentioned before (Self-care, Borrowed Time and Adrenaline) and **Unbreakable (Bill only)** thrown into the mix - When and if the killer downs you and leaves you on the ground (called slugging), you can recover from the dying state faster and get up by yourself.
---
When I'm playing as Bill: 
---
Same thing as everyone else, same meta perks. But I like to add **Left Behind (Bill only)** - If you're the last remaining survivor, you can see the aura of the hatch at a certain distance. I didn't really had the chance to use this perk efficiently, but it's a very situational perk.
---
I don't like to play with the other survivors.
---
Killer queue times are always significantly longer. Given its 4 survivors for every 1 killer
---
juuuuuuuuust a lil bit
---
Since the servers are enabled I get in as killer in like,10 seconds?While as survivor I have to wait like 10 mins at least(both red ranks)
---
I mean hag naturally camps, thats what her power is. You cant really avoid it, shes probably one of the best at defending hooks
---
MW2 mlg throwing knife montage
---
sure, let's not play on survivors' weaknesses, and stop putting trap when you realize they are jackshit at avoiding them. Sounds like a good game plan.
---
He played on the team weaknesses. I'm pretty sure he might have played differently if they had been crouching through the traps, just sayin'...
---
Terrifiying = annoying ?
---
Finally some good fucking food
---
I've been waiting for a good suggestion for years now
---
Hag is S tier
---
Don't be toxic with perks designed to counter killer toxicity.
---
Aka, Don't spam lockers trying to DS bait, Don't unhook instantly after the killer hooks because you have borrowed.
---
terrifying
---
if the killer is camping you, please dont attempt escape or die on purporse.
---
And when you pallet stun him he grows stronger
---
No. please. recovering exhaustion while running is pure cancer. even if you are 1shot.
---
survivors gets no bloodpoints does is the killer,
---
survivors depip, so does the killer,
---
Survivors doing their job at surviving is bullying? See that's the problem with this community. Perceiving survivors as toxic no matter what they do. Looping and outplaying is not bullying.
---
If there‚Äôs more than one of you on a gen and the killer chases you and not the other person, lead the killer away from said gen so it can be finished.
---
All gens completed and just stood by the hook
---
That's exceptionally creepy, well done.
---
*The Pallet Face's power is called Pallet Shroud.
---
This power will activate automatically and ONLY after being hit with pallets at least 3 times.
---
While Pallet Shroud is active, The Pallet Face transforms into a fake Pallet that can do literally nothing other than stay on the same spot, letting the survivors finish the generators, come at him to give him some enjoyable buttdancing and then proceed to escape while remembering The Pallet Face how much he sucks and deserves it for letting the survivors vault and pallet hit him for the entire match.*
---
No.. when I said "balance towards the best" I meant players. Are you that dense?
---
Any competitive game, which means PVP, should be balanced like that
---
It's a casual game, yes, but also competitive since you don't play against AI, do you? If you can't understand that I won't spend 20min explaining to you the basics of any pvp game
---
Wife of the flashing Myers USB guy
---
I disagree with you. balance in this games case should be around the majority
---
Shirtless FemMyers now
---
What do you mean what's with them? They're Halloween skins from last year that you can still buy in the shop, which is also why they're not at all better than the exclusive legacy skins, someone just doesn't like that they can't get them lol
---
Gives me hope! I don't think I'll be ranking up too fast - I play for fun and often am letting people go if something seems unfair. But I am excited to see this problem lessened. Thanks for the hopeful advice.
---
It makes sense, no doubt! Especially if it's even 2 killer players to every one survivor. It's just odd how drastic a difference it is. 10 seconds vs 6 minutes is wild.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, PC is a whole different game. However, it‚Äôs not a bad thing. This is made to play on the go, and with that in mind it‚Äôs a great game.
---
I would be higher ranked on switch, however they had a bug where ranks would reset every time you started the game and that was patched within a couple of days
---
Is this question to the question serious?
---
Oof true, I‚Äôm only rank 15 and already half of them are spirits, not only that, about 70% of those spirits are major d*ckheads 
---
Maybe I‚Äôll stop trying to climb the ranks from here
---
Running just bbq chilli on killer nearly triple bp‚Äôs üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
---
I feel the eyelashes make it more creepy
---
Happened to me the other day. Sabotage hooks turned into hitting intoxicated survivors as Clown.
---
Whispers should have a counter. It's a meta perk and it's almost infallible. For the survivors, there's no way around it. If you stay hidden in the same place, the killer will find you. If you move away from the killer, he/she will spot you. Last match I played that someone had Whispers, it was a Hillbilly that slugged my friend on the other side of the map and came straight for me (I was inside a locker and he found me).
---
YES OH MY GOD YES GIVE ME IT
---
You must of had a raging boner after that play
---
Awesome and also showing dominance by standing on pallets lol :D
---
Maybe you have some ports blocked or something like that. This is my weakest part of computer engineering tho so I need someone else to confirm it.
---
Hag is just a hydrohomie
---
u got the game the right price
---
doesnt worth it if it isnt free
---
Ha flip flop
---
People are always complaining about everything in the game. Or play "scummy" ways (teabag or being unfair toward second chances the game is giving you). Community is salty in general.
---
I have legacy on the Nurse and Wraith but I don't play any of these killers. If I will, I'd do it badly too.
---
You can set them up while chasing too
---
Hilarious, you're exactly the type of killer main I'm talking about. Not "playing fair"? Gen rush? What do you expect them to do, wait until you say it's ok to start working on gens? Lmao.
---
Use both effectiveness addons and spray them down right in front of ur face.
---
I usually do totems and then gens asap against those people (or DC if I faced multiple friendlies in a row)
---
I want to play the actual game I enjoy. Stop wasting my time.
---
No but that takes away its synergy with perks like dead hard, resilience, and this is not happening
---
Oh that would really be cool! Agreed.
---
Lol! Yeah dude I know. I use to do that till someone on reddit complained about tapping. Telling me to hit great skill checks or even good checks, but not to tap. That guy really taught me a lot.
---
This made me chuckle
---
What makes u say that lol
---
I teabag as a way of asking for a heal or telling the wounded player I can heal them, dunno if they see it as toxic. I feel like it's just easier for them to see and take note than waving/pointing at them esp if they are running
---
The meaning of the toxic community is, there are 4 players per game, and if you go in along and the other 3 are in a team playing together, more often than not you will be forgotten and left hooked, especially if it's when a gate is open, but if you have a good team, or you go in with a friend or two you will be fine
---
It‚Äôs not as toxic as MW2 ‚Äò09 days so you‚Äôll be fine
---
I‚Äôm leaning towards a port issue as u/Oicmorez suggested. If I had to take a guess either your router or your ISP is blocking traffic. The VPN circumvents those systems naturally so it‚Äôs the most logical anyways. I would check your ISP supplied router first to see if there is a restriction put in place or else the issue is with something else you have tied in between your main connection and computer (a second router.)
---
Lol, so Killer should just grab the Survivor and take the DS then ?
---
As a rank 11ish player I find bubba to be a great killer so the most I would do is move him down one spot or keep him at B tier.
---
Toxic survivors bullying the lower tier killers, that‚Äôs what creates Spirit, nurse mains etc
---
The killers they've added are quite fun (**Ghost Face's** detection sometimes refuses to work tho)
---
They reworked **Badham Preschool** map into a pallet heaven with many semi-safe pallets that are play-able but the map gets ruined by **Bloodlust** being a thing. Killers will stay on pallets for a while to play them and when the survivor plays them perfectly they would never get caught, but **Bloodlust** makes it so they will eventually go down. Many killer mains asked for an option to disable **Bloodlust** for yourself because this map could be very fun.
---
the newest DLC was HUGE
---
Dedicated servers are on their way. They were supposed to be there already, but there were problems, especially with **Huntress**, so they got delayed
---
I found the rank 18
---
YES PLEASE, Ghostface gonna be fun af.
---
You don't need a counter for every killer perk. You know it's supposed to be a 4v1 right? Imagine if every single perk had the same amount of counters of BBQ.. 
---
You're against 16 perks as killer, none of them can be denied, buuut as killer every hex perk can be totally denied just by spending 15s holding 1 button
---
It's good there's some decent perks like whispers that cannot be countered at all. Ask for it just show how little you know about the game. Especially the last part of your comment.. 
---
Killer can hear you inside a locker, especially if injured just saying
---
Bruh watch fungoose's games as leatherface he is amazing with Leatherface. lol
---
Loool literally. Thanks haha üòÇ
---
When I used to play hag \`i used both ruin and devour of hope hoping that they only cleanse ruin and then they forget about devour of hope especially in the higher ranks since last ruin doesn't really affect them that much
---
"To defeat an enemy, you must first become your enemy." -Sun Tzu
---
Snitch: You tell the killer the location of other survivors then gain the "invincible" effect
---
Agreed. If everyone stays infected it's fucking hell as plague. You solidify your m1 killer status even further despite them being 1 hit. They still loop you through certain unfair map layouts or as you said, just genrush cuz they literally can't heal anyways.
---
The windows block for a reason
---
Yes, this question is a serious question in response to the question if this is serious
---
If you can go a whole game without getting hit once then damn you don't even need perks lol.
---
Its ok i completely forgot how to play as spirit after prestieging the demogorgon 3 times.
---
Wazup (pls don't hurt me, i'm just testing user flair)
---
Spine Chill doesn‚Äôt work on T1 Myers. Also I heard they‚Äôre going to be updating spine chill to not work on any stealth killers but not 100% sure on that.
---
Not complaining just saying survivors are bitching when a killer can crouch back
---
Me injured:
---
‚ÄúHey you at that tree over there, come rub my ass‚Äù
---
You can run whatever build you're feeling at the moment, it's your game, your rules. Just don't expect people to save you from hairy situations. You are compromising the whole team and decreasing their chances of survival. It does not come as a surprise that they will be upset.
---
When he is picked up the auras of all gens being completed are revealed
---
**Survivor SWF** matchmaking now works basing on **the highest survivor rank in the group**, not by **the rank of the group master** (ranks 2, 4, 18, 20 will look for a rank 2 killer)
---
**Freddy** got reworked into a beast, sitting in the top 6 (? or 7, I'm not sure where the newest killer is on the list) Do you want a detailed comment on that how I did with Legion?
---
We have a **friend-list** in game and the group **stays grouped** after the match
---
**Huntress' Humming** is no longer directional
---
**End Game Collapse** is a thing. I'll make a detailed comment on that
---
For me it's because of the "value" of the chase.  
---
If I am playing survivor, I'll be most likely kiting arround the killer for 30-60seconds, get hit, and continue kiting him for another 30-60 seconds until I go down.  
---
Fucking up once doesn't matter that much. I might fuck up (he gets a quick hit), then I'll kite him arround and eventually I escape or he downs me.  
---
Or I kite him for quite a while, then he gets a hit off, and if I fuck up then it doesn't matter that much because I allready got my team some time.  
---
If I am at a healthy state however and the killer is chasing me with the exposed debuff on me, a slight fuck up will directly down me, cost our team time and pressure us.  
---
That's why there is a difference. Atleast for me.

Maybe I remember talks about a new swamp map wayyy before leather face came out. It's true, dead lake is an early version of grim pantry. There's a video of it online
---
Totem spawn went from TERRIBLE to TERRIBLE MOST OF THE TIME and GODLIKE SOME OF THE TIME
---
sadly i see PLENTY of spirits running noed on rank 1.
---
Why can't I get gifts like this
---
Did you get the term "kiting" from zombies? I've never heard it used in DbD before
---
Dont forget the lunge
---
I got it from MMO's such as WoW. It's also used in MOBAs.  
---
I think it's just a gaming term, but I don't know to be honest.
---
As a rank 7 spirit main I was today years old when I learned phasing emits a sound
---
As a Bing Bong main, can confirm.
---
infinites were nerfed when u lil killers got bloodlust 1-3.... lmao...keep the stupidity of urs coming kid
---
r u confused? again?
---
Yeah I saw that one. Odd to change the map name, but still doesn't explain why we have a structure that isn't being used hah. A new Swamp map would add a bit more variety to the table with these older assets.
---
wtf are you actually saying billy requires less skill than spirit? have you guys ever played killer? dafuq
---
Are you *really* though?
---
Too OP. Please Nerf.
---
I agree with you. But I think they should make it a bit harder to get them rid of ruin. Like 2 hex totems and the killer can't see where they are or so... Some guy suggested that the hex can't be visible to anyone unt 1 minute have pass. After, both killers and survivors would be able to see the hex.
---
BP isn't about objectives but varying up your gameplay far as I've seen, you do a combination of actions not just the obj and you get more points, same for killer.
---
Facts it‚Äôs really the only person I‚Äôve ever ran into that‚Äôs fine it
---
The "stacks" specification is pretty messy in general. Some add-ons say they stack, others don't, and yet the latter often do stack and in some cases the former don't, or didn't. And then there's stuff like Murky Reagant, which specifies that it stacks, but a single Reagant already causes the maximum amount of fog.
---
10 percent is only 8 seconds it wouldn't stop anyone
---
I was playing a match last night I was in a chase, and JUST as I get hit someone cleaned haunted grounds big oofs (he then killed my entire team in 10 damn seconds)
---
Do ruin gens ALONE! unless it's the last gen
---
You could try Doctor, he has a series of add ons called "Discipline" that cause the survivors to see the red stain on themselves as soon as you enter a chase, but you can see it too.
---
What that means is that as soon as you're considered in a chase with them, they basically have a big red spotlight over them that makes hiding impossible.
---
Plague is also great, as once a survivor is sick they get a green cloud around them which extends over most low obstacles and is visible from a long distance. They also cough and vomit which is VERY loud and not made quieter by stealth perks, it makes finding people very easy.
---
Dude from one killer main to another: You're talking bs.  
---
If a killer fails to get one person, it's a good indication for him performing poorly, the survivors doing good, and the killer having bad luck (with the map for example) - or all of the three above.  
---
There is toxic behavior like t-bagging, verbal abuse in post game chat, bodyblocking, holding the game hostage.  
---
And there is behavior which is completely fine aswell but is condemned as toxic by this community such as: Camping, Tunneling, Gen-Rushing, using certain perks (DS, NOED, Adrenaline), using certain offerings, using certain items.  
---
There isn't 'unfair behavior'.
---
I'll give you some examples.  
---
\- A killer might say rushing through gens isn't fair.  
---
Wrong. It's badly balanced that games sometimes only take 4 minutes, but the survivors are just following their objective.  
---
Why should they wait and give the killer an advantage?
---
\- A survivor might say using NOED isn't fair.  
---
That's wrong aswell. If a perk makes you win, why should you not use it?
---
\- A killer might say SWFs communicating via discord isn't fair.  
---
I agree that it completely breaks the balance of the game and makes it 0% unfun if the squad tryhards/brute forces a win with their advantages. But if Bhrv is fine with it, it shouldn't be seen as unfair.  
---
And now I'll hit you guys with the hard to swallow pills, which will get me downvoted.
---
\- A survivor might say camping and tunneling isn't fair and is toxic.  
---
Nope, it's not. It's a tool given to the killer which will be used to follow his objective of winning the game.  
---
Tunneling a player might result into getting a quick kill which slows down the game.
---
Camping a hooked survivor will punish heavy altruistic teams and might give you a win aswell.
---
All of these examples are usually seen as 'unfair' or 'toxic' behavior, while in fact those are tools given by the devs to play and win these games.  
---
Usually people justify their argument of it being unfair/toxic with: "But it's not enjoyable for the other side" (to get camped; to play against a gen-rushing team etc) ...
---
but tbh, this is a pvp game. If you lose because of a 'stupid' tactic it doesn't make it toxic or unfair.
---
People need to get this, or they will complain about things which will never get changed.
---
Yeah this games only lasted 2 months the humanity
---
"It's good there's some decent perks like whispers that cannot be countered at all." 
---
                                                                                             
---
No, it's not. You sound like a salty killer main. This game is already unbalaced for both sides, nobody needs another OP perk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
---
                                                                                            "Ask for it just show how little you know about the game. Especially the last part of your comment.."
---
Why are you making assumptions out of nowhere? You know literally nothing about me. I have over 3k hours into the game. I play as both, killer and survivor but manly as a survivor. The killer left my friend bleeding out on the ground and came straight to where I was - on the other side of the map. He had Whispers and said that he was "patrolling". Which is bullshit anyway.            
---
                                                                                          
---
"Killer can hear you inside a locker, especially if injured just saying"                                                                     
---
Oh, really? Thanks, you really made my day. *irony mode on* 
---
I was just going to suggest lockers as counters to Whispers.
---
Damn, this sounds great. I love this man.
---
I do agree with that, but my point is that you don't stop in the middle of a chase in favour of resetting traps if you have already landed a hit.  That just completely takes the pressure off.
---
If you abandon a good chase just so that you can set up more traps in the basement shack, you're not even trying to down the injured survivor.  You're 100% focusing on denying the unhook, which is textbook camping.
---
Sure buddy, keep telling yourself that these people are just happy-go friendly people, what a f@g.
---
Sounds like trash survivors being trash survivors
---
Am i the only that's upset that you completely ignored the hook on your right?
---
Pass
---
I love how everyone's shitting on Spirit, not realizing that the actual issue is too many other killers being not really viable in high rank SWF games, being ripped apart, bullied even.
---
The problem isn't Spirit, the problem are too many weak killers being neglected.
---
Why üò≠
---
Keys and Mouse don‚Äôt really give any advantage in this game. Killer vs Survivor situation... In a FPS it would have a huge advantage tho. 
---
Only advantage you‚Äôd have with a mouse is ranking up to your true rank quicker, where you would then once again be challenged by others of your own skill level no matter what they are using to control.
---
You mean he may need a new face right?
---
What about the hillbilly? My boy is being rejected again :(
---
One some killers it doesnt, but on killers such as huntress and nurse it provides a very distinct advantage
---
I love using pop or ruin, for trapper it gives you extra time to set up traps, for trapper that would've been 3 or 4 gens for a good team, I like to play a simple game, create an area, wait for them to finish their side of generators, push them one by one in your area, trap them in the center or the heart of your area, or the normal basement trapper if you see them disabling traps, a good thing to do would be to hook a survivor, place a trap, if he gets unhooked and the trap is touched, you know that it's a team, then you use the basement, most of the time the basement guy dies or kills himself because nobody gives two fucks, pop is very efficient if the map is small or closely populated with gens, you can hook a guy and then fuck their whole progress forcing their game to be slowed and giving you more time to set up traps.Ruin gives you 2-3 mins in my experience, red ranks is hell for totems.
---
The simple fact is that playing killer is super stressful at high ranks. I love playing killer but I can only play so many games before I get sick of it and switch to survivor for a bit. Nurse and spirit, once you learn them, take a lot of that stress off because it becomes an even match to all of the swf and insta heals and toxic clickers. 
---
I used to be a wraith main when I started this game, now I'm a P3 spirit main and I hardly drop a game. Every now and then I get a really chill swf that just dicks around and it kinda let's me chill out a bit and not try so hard. But that's only every 1/10 games if that.
---
I don‚Äôt need to see any more god damn Kardashians in my life
---
Gimme dat spooky dick
---
Honestly just play the way you want to play and don't worry about what other people say. There's so many toxic people in this game it can ruin the fun sometimes but you gotta have thick skin
---
Oh yes
---
I feel that. I actually really like Legion and Trapper but until Rank reset I kind of have to play Spirit. I've switched to survivor recently to mitigate the stress of it.
---
Windstorm green and purple + full stacks PWYF
---
HAHAHAHA. My first 10-15 games against Spirit (dirty survivor main here), they had prayer beads. I also didn't know about the sound, so I just thought she was basically an OP version of Wraith.
---
From a killer main that loves using Spirit with prayer beads:  
---
It's just really fun AND viable to use.  
---
There isn't much you can do when you face red-rank-swf-squads that tryhard and bully you arround.  
---
Spirit allways was my main, but usually I like to mix things up.  
---
So I'll play Clown.  
---
Oh, great. 4 Claudettes. SWF. 2+ Instaheal syringes. All with 4 meta perks.  
---
How about some Wrath? I love Wrath. I'd love to mix things up and use some of the new perks.  
---
Oh, a squad with 2+ insta heals again. This time 2 of them run OoO and start t-bagging me right when the game starts ... and ... there is nothing I can do against it.  
---
Game turns out to be stressful as fuck and it will end in them insulting me if I achieve some kills.  
---
After a bunch of these games I'll just say: Fuck it. Time for some Spirit with prayer beads.  
---
Suddenly the game is fun (Jumpscare moments) and I'll crush these teams, which try to spit in my face.
---
It's pretty depressing but I still have a lot of fun with the game and playing with friends and such. I don't think we'll ever reach a state of perfect balance with this game but tbh it's not terrible right now, it certainly used to be worse. That being said there's still a lot of work the devs have to do lol
---
Damn, i hope they fix it
---
I think in general the pallet hitbox detection is janky but you may be right, I've been stunned at much further ranges before than I am on Meyers at this point
---
Where do you feel he needs the buff? 
---
For me, he's comfortably in the top four - his traps shut down loops, Borrowed Time doesn't exist against him, you can mindgame with the gen teleport, and if you run Make Your Choice then you just need to hook someone near an unfinished gen to proxy camp for instadowns on two survivors at a time. Oh, and he racks up Bloodpoints just by existing.
---
Personally I'm having a lot of fun with him, because there's actual interaction with survivors. I feel it's a very different experience to playing Nurse, Spirit, or Billy.
---
I know. Thats the part that I hate.
---
I couldnt give this a positive because its rare you see people not getting unhooked anymore, unless youre in white ranks and your teamates have no idea how to play to the best and or is scared to go near the hook, otherwise its hard not to see people rescue, but its hard to see them do it intelligently
---
The longer you wait, the wider the matchmaking net gets. This is not an error, this is common practice in pretty much any game. The huge problem before, was you had rank 1 players tagging along with their swf squads, and fighting like rank 16 killers.
---
I‚Äôm confused, what am I missing
---
^(A h o y    G a m e r s)
---
That‚Äôs scary as fuk lol
---
They just used 2 exhaustion perks, you're not catching a hacker
---
It's not the keyboard and mouse that would give the advantage but the frames per second and being able to adjust the quality of the graphics.
---
I mean if I was you I would just use it as a learning experience and move on. The more you play you‚Äôre going to realize that green ranks really aren‚Äôt that hard to get to, and that playing against better players actually makes you better too.
---
No balanced landing stopped the stun
---
When Feng gets hooked:EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I think that any and all games im killer hex spawns either next to a survivor or out in open... but if im survivor its the most hidden thing in the world
---
I would wait until rank reset the so it‚Äôd be easier to get merciless
---
I use it quite often as well but it is pretty powerful because it completely nullifies every stealth killers power besides tier 1 Myers.
---
That was a pretty good play, though crouching then was a bit risky imo.
---
Dito
---
the said it will be a limit 6 ranks up or down
---
the other 3 games i got worst matchmaking than this but i didnt took a photo
---
I kinda like being toxic in games, so just curious is  all lol
---
You know the matchmaking is due to the amount of players right? If there isn‚Äôt a lot of players playing within your rank, it starts looking for other ranks to queue you up with so in reality crossplay between all systems would improve matchmaking and queue times.
---
Yea Umbra is good and all, but my boi Scott is the real sniper.
---
When you commit to a gen and it‚Äôs the last one but the killer has NOED: üôÉ
---
I p3'ed the Nea
---
Has something happen where my computer bar at the end of the game broke and was shooting back and forth from the negative billions to positive billions
---
i play the game from day 1 on ps4 man
---
doesnt matter if i get the kills its a scam 
---
the point of the ranks is to machtmaking in the SAME almost rank
---
or else remove the ranking system completely
---
You would be better off buying their chapter
---
Yes of course
---
Pallettes, slowdowns, &amp; a whole lotta trash
---
Same.
---
So you‚Äôve been playing since day 1 and you‚Äôre a rank 19 killer? I don‚Äôt mean to sound like an inconsiderate asshole here, but you shouldn‚Äôt be as upset as you are at the matchmaking for this.
---
Actually sounds pretty cool.
---
The blur is still high enough pixels to where you can make out with the cock.
---
It was so toxic that I would party up with 5 other friends and every time there was another party we would immediately talk trash and scream out clan battle, our clan went 300-0 but of course we didn‚Äôt count the losses
---
Eye lashes on fleek
---
you idiot the ranks reset every month
---
get lost
---
block
---
I had a swf a year ago that spammed my steam comments calling me trash and to kys and other unsavoury things because they lost....like spammed 30 messeges i just blocked and reported on steam and deleted the messeges.....then they either got friends or got on a alt account and repeat this about 2 more times
---
360s can be countered by not lunging?
---
And don‚Äôt forget, no Ed and tier 3 bloodlust

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/deijhz/michael/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Exactly, even if people aren‚Äôt team players it‚Äôs still in their best interest to try and save people as it‚Äôs more likely to get the win
---
Recover exhaustion while still running? are you nuts? you know that was in the game before and they took it out because the killer would get close to the survivor and boom sprint burst activates.
---
You had the right idea but you fucked it up at the end
---
I somehow always survive and get like 2 endgame hook rescues when I'm rancored
---
It's like when 1 guy DC's against a (crappy) 3 blink nurse so you go super saiyan out of spite
---
Except the box, paint brush, pill bottle and class photo. Cuz those are all quite strong and not direct slowdowns
---
&gt; *it's true, only if your WHOLE TEAM cleanses.*
---
That's the part most people don't seem to realise.
---
If one survivor cleanses then they're throwing the rest of the team under the bus. If everyone cleanses then she's just Huntress++, and that's far easier to handle.
---
There's nothing worse then seeing survivors cleanse at the furthest edges of the map, get infected again, and realise that to cleanse again they have to get closer to where the Plague is patrolling because she has no interest in using remote Fountains. It's right up there with watching a 3-gen happen.
---
*pallet this you fucking casual*
---
Patched - it's not possible to 360 as easily anymore.
---
I play on both ps4 and pc, and it's 100% the same
---
I figured I was far enough to safely do that, given he‚Äôd given up chase at that point and I had enough time left
---
You are rank 19, this late on rank reset it is very unlikely that you will always find 4 survivors rank 14 max. 
---
The SWF algorithm is working perfectly, playing we my friends we rarely go against a killer that isn't within 6 ranks from the highest survivor on our group. It won't always be able to find this match-up  and like others said, it will expand the search.
---
You are complaining about "unfair" matchmaking but if devs make it even more stricter, other people will complain they can't play.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/deiken/anyone_else_has_this_daily_ritual_issueglitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Maybe! I personally thought it's a neat perk, but perhaps. Could also make it limited to one use per game or some such thing :)
---
Yes I am the idiot and you are the person crying because the game you‚Äôve been playing for 3 years now placed you with intermediate players.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Everyone is dead and the game isn‚Äôt ending
---
Of course I know that. I've played this game since launch. It was in the game for a long time before it was ever deemed too strong. I think being able to recover during running at the cost of being insta-down all match by M1 is an interesting discussion.
---
He also camps. I watched a game the other day where he was getting destroyed pretty badly. He was huntress and literally stood on a hill about 10m from a hooked survivor and just waited. Even his chat had people calling out the camp.
---
You can argue that he had to do it in that situation, and he did end up "winning", but it was definitely a camp. True's problem is that he views anything less than a 4k as a loss, and he gets seriously butt hurt when he loses. He also constantly talks like playing killer is the hardest thing in the world when you have people like zubat, scorpionz, and Marth who can win consistently with off-meta killers without using shitty tactics.
---
u r lucky. i get neither. i usually get worst like dark sense or left behind
---
As a killer main, If a freindly surv tea bags arounf me I think you have an ego and are not a teamplayer.
---
Basically when I've already rerolled the daily ritual, and close the screen, it will change again once on its own. This has happened every single time:( Anyone have a solution?
---
I don't see how there is a big difference between PC and Consol when it comes to a game like this
---
No the person is still on the hook. You have to wait until their body is fully sacrificed for it to end.
---
So good! Really creepy.
---
As if average stats mean anything when talking about balance. Show me stats of red rank games with Spirit. You don't balance a game for R20s who run into walls. There's a reason tier lists are based on stats and winrates of competitive play.
---
The survivor perk would be more balanced if you got louder with more pieces in general(breathing, footsteps, gen repairing, etc) and had to collect more(maybe.4 or 5 since it could make triple or more loops when placed correctly).
---
I read that other comment thread and I gotta say
---
I side with everyone but OP.
---
Stu and Billy didn't have a problem with that and they weren't even wearing that super thick leather
---
Trust me it sucks I‚Äôd be the solo player but the highest rank at the same time and get an low rank killer who‚Äôs gonna chase you during 5 gens is really boring since he‚Äôs most likely to camp you endgame, that‚Äôs if your team do gens while you are being chase. I feel really bad when I see the post game lobby cause I shouldn‚Äôt be in that game in the first time.
---
I say the opposite cuz a good killer can still track
---
We need more tier lists like this
---
I propose Demo gets his own tier that is just
---
***A M G E R Y***
---
I mean it's like 6 days before reset so ur gonna have those games at rank 20
---
Lmao at op
---
Roughly same here. Nothing changed until I started watching streamers, and suddenly another 500 hours later I still feel like I only know barebones
---
It is a general term. I've heard it in everything from Left 4 Dead, MMOs, RPGs, to even FPS.
---
The worst part of those insults was when you actually were playing spec ops and they just happened to guess that right. Makes you feel predictable by mere strangers.

Excactly, people can't blame Spirit Players if almost more than half of the Killer roster is nearly..."Useless" , in Red ranks against the tryhard SWF's.
---
I still think they need to make low- and mid-tier Killers more appealing, Nurse, Spirit and Billy are just much too dominant.

Question

How difficult do you think it is for a Kardashian to shit when constipated? ‚ÄúGet me raisins I‚Äôm begging you!‚Äù Difficult perhaps? Only asking because they have so little flesh left to contain a bloated stomach that it would logically fire out like a grenade.

Update log
---
-	Pallet face can no longer attack
---
-	Fixed issue where pallet face could only be stunned by pallets within his hit box any pallet dropped on the map will stun him
---
-	fixed issue where pig could use her power
---
-	fixed issue where legions feral frenzy did something 
---
-	gave extended lunge to spirit
---
-	made the following addons base kit for hillbilly (primer bulb, cerburator tuning guide)
---
-	made nurse give survivors permanent exposed status effect
---
Always one guy who nitpicks the meme
---
It was always described as "addon changes, possibly with some slight changes to base kit." People did what people do, and immediately started screaming "nurse is getting nerfed"
---
Not exactly. Here‚Äôs what they said:
---
‚ÄúIf a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
*New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule* in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.‚Äù
---
So while your matchmaking here isn‚Äôt ideal, it‚Äôs either that or wait half an hour for a match.
---
I am the 1%!
---
Steve has 1 good perk which is second wind. He also has scoops ahoy which is great. I main Steve I almost have him to P3
---
Patch notes unclear. Nerf Pig again.
---
A cynic would say it's easier for someone to escape when they've guaranteed that their three buddies are going down in 60s or less.
---
It's a kind of prisoner's dilemma situation. If they all work together then they all *might* get out, but if one of them throws their friends under a bus then that person *will* get out.
---
*Unless you're the kind of Plague that likes to find That One Survivor who screwed their whole team...* üòä
---
You can always catch poor players with meme builds, doesn't make the meme build good though.
---
I think Im going to buy Plaque next... I have Nightmare right now. Need some variety.
---
Teach us your wise words, oh powerful one
---
This post XD
---
How is this not on r/dbdgonegay
---
Me and my survive with friends group are idiots.
---
I would agree with the grunts of pain... 
---
And the ability to get up if downed... 
---
But recovering exhaustion would be to op.
---
Stalk off! Ready.... Never mind, you win. Don't unleash tier 4. ;-; 
---
In all seriousness this is legit creepy as fuck! You plan on scaring some folks shitless this Halloween? (Or shirtless if we go with auto-correct.)
---
What killer would be a better option than? I think doc is pretty good, it would be a pretty unique experience to find him in a handful of nurses and spirits.
---
They could still do another Evol Dead chapter/killer - nothing is impossible.
---
Doing so also bypasses borrowed time, and immediately puts them on your shoulder. You can also interrupt vaults, but the survivor must be injured.
---
Guys it‚Äôs the fact that the camera is above the basement
---
Good job compiling that, it is neat to see a 24 hr sample size.
---
I did this with Wraith the other day. It was a really intense match but in the end it was worth it!
---
a gen on each corner of the map is still adjacent relative to each other
---
Just saying "close" is fine
---
There is an actual problem with the current system, but its not whats listed here, and it is better than what was happening before. The issue now is low rank newbies, being dragged by their friends into high rank games. I'm rank 5 currently, and pretty regularly, my game is filled with red ranks, thats fine and expected. The issue is, every now and then, one of these veteran players, is dragging in a random rank 18, who is now paired with survivors way ahead of their skill level, and a killer that they really couldnt hope to escape.
---
Imo freddy is up there too.
---
I keep him in rotation at rank 1-2 and never have a problem. Just dont ever use dream pallets
---
Used to play the game a lot and just got back in it never made it to a super high rank but I hope I can get there to feel your pain
---
This sounds pretty good!
---
and just like every other licensed killer things have and will be changed to fit their narrative. pennywise can and will work in this game
---
Can't you find the sound file on pc and replace it with a file with the same filename or am I too old and tech has increased in twenty years....
---
Also make it a baby laugh.
---
Nonono. You run No mither. (Joke, but it does force the killer to hook you, or you'll just pick yourself up.)
---
That‚Äôd probably get me banned
---
Really? Is it cheating??
---
I don‚Äôt know. A lot of games flag any modifications to in game files.
---
Potatoes is why.
---
What are the chances of his perks being buffed or have the devs said anything? And how strong do you think they will be a post buff?
---
I had a similar idea a while back but forgot to post about it, thank you so much for this. :D Upvote and full support!
---
He used to be and technically he still is... However the past season or 2 have altered many character dynamics and relationships and the new season last night is now out right, verbally, questioning when are you the good guy and when are you the bad guy and that no matter what, you are the bad guy to the other guy. 
---
It seems a little on the nose. I was taught in writing class that the most effective antagonist is one who's the hero to their own story. Negan was writing to reflect this more than the Governor or previous antagonists. The writers and showrunners for the show have proudly pointed this out about Negan if you watch the behind the scenes stuff or even Talking Dead. 
---
The course they are currently on dealing with The Whisperers is almost forcing Negan to play ball with Rick's group while also allowing for new character growth we wouldn't have seen previously (or at least mildly hinted at in scenes with Carl).
---
I'm trying to avoid spoilers for anyone who cares about that.
---
That's siiccc
---
Is this ecen good? Sure hooks are closer but... if the amount of hooks is the same doesnt that mean some map zones have no hooks?
---
I heard McLean talk about this on his stream last night. They need to get approval from the rights holders for any officially licenced characters like Myers before they can add new skins.
---
damn i was hesitant to spam multiple image posts all the while i could have done this instead .. ill post multi image renders in future in this format.
---
it's on both ends my guy. Both ends of the spectrum see the other side as inherently toxic.
---
Sounds like a buff to me! Hardly any good can come from the post-game chat.
---
He is just being a protective brother
---
Honestly not sure,  I don‚Äôt think the devs said anything about buffing Steve. But if they do buff him idk if they‚Äôd make them that strong. Hopefully they buff his perks tho
---
Can someone tell me what Legacy items are?
---
Quick question, why doesn't BHVR implement coms in their game? The only reason I can think of is because it would diminish aura perks...
---
I would also love cosmetics where the survivors wear the killer's masks or dress in bootleg costumes resembling the killers.
---
Ok
---
I had a round where a huntress had 2 near misses against me, and I (wisely) decided to run after both of em.
---
You can get a crosshair using Nvidia Geforce
---
I don't get it, what happened?
---
0 BP
---
So? Every time you save 1.000.000 shards, you can go down to 0 BP. Every time.
---
i never save BPs or anything like that, i spend the  after each game because i‚Äôm too impatient
---
It was created to make a "hard mode" for survivors, similar to obsession perks for killers. The problem is that, for some reason, Devs decided to make the broken icon visible for killers too, making the only positive characteristic completely useless. The 50% quieter moans is outshined by iron will and the fact that you don't leave blood pools is stupid, because I just rather play healed.
---
Just getting to P3 is fairly quick. The real grind is getting all the perks afterwards.
---
You won. Congrats.
---
Only if Ruin was changed, it'd buff it.
---
The wiki is imperfect - some parts are updated more regularly than others.
---
You will *generally* find a more reliable guide in u/int3r4ct's Entity Education series, and the Plague video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOxpBwyhz-w).
---
It *does* mention that Corrupt Purge is lost on pallet stun, and if you check the Patch Notes that you'll see that *not* losing Corrupt Purge on pallet stun was actually considered a bug.
---
Courtesy tag for u/BobWashere_1s_h3r3.
---
Let me win!
---
I hate how they changed her sound from stereo to mono. She always jumps me from behind now. :(
---
I got Steve because, if you think about it, all characters play the same. It's the perks that makes the difference. So, if I'm dropping money on a character, I got to like them.
---
So, in your case, if you like Steve, buy him. Just use other perks.
---
I suppose I count as a semi pallet slammah, because I do stop at pallets, but if I feel like I'm using too many (around 3 is my limit, but this doesn't apply when I'm the last one left), I will stop using them, and I'm able to run a loop if I need to.
---
It cancels out sadness and makes a day. Just a day.
---
Just don't get caught then! /s

Ahh, I love it when that happens. As a killer at least

You're unironically advocating for perks that are stronger or as strong than the killers perks for survivors.. I can't talk with someone that makes that argument in a 4v1 game..
---
You absolute legend
---
The real counter to NOED is leaving totems next to unfinished gens, near gates, or really easy to spot locations up, and delete the hidden ones.
---
I've walked out the exit gates immediately in lobbies where everyone cleansed totems I've spotted in prime "please leave me up" locations after it's revealed killer is using NOED.
---
It's the equivalent to 3 genning yourself. Don't do totems.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/debqfx/i_know_being_exposed_isnt_exactly_a_state_dont/f2vinco/
---
Spooky.
---
Definitely there should be a surrender button for killers and survivors, but definitely don‚Äôt have it safety pip them, either 1 or 2 pip down.
---
1. Safety pip is kinda rewarding them for not wanting to play against whatever they are going against since they would probably lose and depip anyway.
---
And 2. Being at a high rank itself is a terrible experience so the lower people get the better, at least until they making getting to red ranks not an absolutely terrible experience.
---
u/leakingpickle sure, just tell me when you switch back to your original account instead of creating one just to reply to me in such a way ;)
---
I'll nitpick your life
---
Don't forget that there are always exceptions to a rule.
---
For example, a survivor built to be the dedicated interference runner on a team where the other three are going hell for leather on gens - the runner doesn't need to worry about pallet use, the runner only needs to worry about running for 5 gens.
---
Further, you can be a bit more liberal with pallets when you're in areas where all the gens have been completed - you're rarely going to be moving through those areas again later in the game.
---
u/leakingpickle still trying to go on with this? Ok..
---
Imagine calling a killer/addon a crutch.  
---
I could see how your 50 IQ Pepega brain would think that I've said that.
---
But I didn't.  
---
Here, have a smiley face
---
:)
---
I love you split mouth
---
Hmm. A promising start, but you went wrong when suggesting a survivor perk could be buffed...
---
Thankfully they fixed that issue in 3.2.2, but yeah it caught me completely off guard the first time I died to it
---
How else am I gonna find my key and escape?
---
Yeah, but you can¬¥t complain, you won that match :)
---
Yes but not all survs teabag.
---
You right...
---
&gt;mirror mode - survivors and killers swap models
---
I didn‚Äôt realise I needed to see a Meg chasing a Huntress and Myers until right now. This needs to happen.
---
I just think against experienced survivors it‚Äôs a bit too easy to escape the dream realm. Might be wrong though
---
If you did they should be killer specific so it isn‚Äôt too spread out and lacking as we both know for now the story is almost non existent but the killers all have backstory to work with. Plus it makes sense with retro comics and how they focus on singular heroes and villains.
---
Yeah official stats would be better but if we assume this player has average skill against all killers(unreasonable but the best we have right now) then the stats would be accurate.
---
It'll always be hag for me she's just so startling
---
Put them in the vicinity of gens, just behind a wall woth easy access to the gen but still out of sight, you can probably get at least one gen grab a game or so this way.
---
It's actually faster to break it manually unless you are already lunging when it drops
---
Looking forward to Clown's comic.
---
I'd could take him. and I don't mean fight
---
Quality meme
---
for a second i thought there was a beer can in his mouth
---
I only play two killers. N U T R I T I O N
---
Canonically, the clothes are either scrounged up by the survivors themselves or gifted by the entity to remind them of past experiences.
---
Yeah totally! Would be rad to illustrate some of the stories like the wraith and the nurse. Got a lot of personal love for the original first few would love to shine some light on them again.
---
It's not letting me upvote you for this wonderful piece of art. Fuck Reddit - this deserves to be rewarded.
---
Me too tbh
---
Killer  main  confirmed. Do  you  even  know  how  to  read?  The  only  thing  I  said  about  survivors  is  that  the  game  is  broken  in  it's  current  state  and  unbalanced  for  both  sides. I  know that  survivors  can  be  overpowered  too  but  not  as  much  as  the  killers  in  this  game.  There's  SWF  with  Dead  Hard  (which  is  counterable  by  the  way),  DS,  Borrowed  Time,  Adrenaline,  purple  flashlights,  instaheals,  keys. Having  said  that,  I'm  ending  this  discussion  on  my  part.  I'm  not  going  to  reply  to  you  anymore  because  instead  of  keeping  a  healthy  discussion  with  other  people,  you  make  assumptions  based  on  nothing  at  all.
---
So if he doesn't have all survivors at P3, it definitely going to take more than 5K hours? üòÆ
---
You know they changed it so it doesn't change the actual number of hooks but the distance between them right?
---
great answer. thank you for showing me the errors of my ways
---
holy fuck this is actually amazing!
---
I must CONSUME MORE!
---
People don't like that they look like legacy skins because they had to grind for them before they Were removed and now people can buy hallowed blight skins that look just like legacy skins
---
You don't gain bloodlust cloaked
---
Awwww xD :3
---
Hail Sithis!
---
This would only widen the gap between solo and swf.
---
I mean your not even bringing any form of argument or discussion to the table. Im just here calling you out on how you used the clown emoji. No need to be aggressive. However I will actually bring something to the table. Both sides can be toxic. Survivors are more common but Killers become toxic because of how much survivors wanna make your day worse. Then those killers end up like the Ghostface in OP‚Äôs video.
---
10% is too low
---
Not a bad thought, however in the end this only really hurts solo survivors which aren‚Äôt the problem.
---
SWF will be generally unaffected by this as they are on comms.
---
At first glance a good idea but overall I‚Äôm gonna say no.
---
This is amazing!
---
Nobody cares
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a shitpost and obviously just on a different platform
---
Not all killers even have the ability to t-bag
---
a 4% decrease in healing, repairing, and sabotaging speed for every injured, downed, or hooked survivor. Sacrificed and dead survivors do not cause this penalty. This penalty can stack up to 4 times for a total of 16%.
---
I mean, open handed can be alright
---
He needs a partner he needs to lie down after that pallet
---
Nice. You do commissions perchance?
---
NiceciN
---
Big brain nurse main: Why don't you patrol that gen literally on the opposite side of the map instead of camping/tunneling me here, by these 3 close gens and my derpy teammate?
---
10 more seconds of generator repairs is 10 seconds longer that the killer has to kill you all.
---
Go back to your pebble farm Adam /s
---
So what? Enjoy your next game
---
Probably you
---
does looking upwards give you more distance on the lunge?
---
This could be a good idea, I‚Äôm a bit nervous to see how this would work now with killers running both ruin and Dying light now
---
Hey there friends. Hows it going?

Almost there. Rank 4.

Just sharing i never had 4 dcs ,and also to see others people experiences

I care :) congratulations

r/ihavesex
---
ranks reset every month u idiot
---
I don't have a problem with it. To me it's no different than Leatherface or Billy being able to break pallets.
---
Hope the killer hits you on the hook, it‚Äôs what I do as a killer to deal with the scream. The hit cancels the scream with a pain grunt
---
Found the bubba
---
As someone who's played Billy and Spirit, this. Spirit requires literally just a good headset, Billy takes a lot more. Don't just blindly trust the DbD difficulty rating.
---
She doesn't clean her weapon if she hits someone after blinking, right? She goes automatically in the fatigue animation.
---
AFAIK, no. It's just a habit that's makes me feel like I'm going farther, like lunging irl when I lunge  in a chase
---
No but it‚Äôs flagged as such
---
i agree
---
the game is almost dead on consoles
---
Reddit gives, reddit takes ! I submit myself to the karma god.
---
More like when there is 3 people on a gen with ruin it‚Äôs 99% then all of a sudden 2 skill checks fail
---
Wow thats a fantastic drawing 10/10
---
Spread awareness on this to BHVR. Too good to let it go to waste
---
Edit: writting is hard
---
I am so fucking hype for the Bubba one and how that'll turn out
---
how the fuck can someone miss the new ds skill check, its like super easy to do...
---
So a Pennywise DLC is kind of confirmed? Or is he just trolling?
---
I used to do this but for some reason I‚Äôm only hitting the pole now.
---
I‚Äôd say The Dancing Clown because that‚Äôs sorta his sub-title in the movie, but that‚Äôs just clown with extra words
---
It is Unbreakable's little brother.
---
I had to check it on the wiki as well because I wasn‚Äôt sure
---
Freddy seems to be kind of a sleeper pick for me, he seems really good as his stall is more consistent than doctor's, while the slow is great tool for more or less free hit.
---
But in the end I very rarely play as or against Freddy. With certain loadout I can imagine him working in red ranks pretty decent.
---
Lol. Can‚Äôt mindlessly loop = broken? 
---
Cry about it
---
running level 1 ruin, bbq, nurses calling lvl 1, and stridor. and I'm using spirit and still lose
---
"Please don't make this game pay to win" 
---
..as if shattered bloodlines free or some shit?
---
As a Pig main I also endorse this (and just as a DBD player in general, this is a great idea).
---
Lol... you flair totally got me!  
---
I was.... wtf are wrong with ppl, -99 points por a simple opinion with nothing bad? Time to upvote this poor soul!  
---
I feel like an idiot now :P
---
YES we were looking for a spot to take photos and saw these in a garbage area in the corner. It was perfect!
---
I would call Unbreakable "Brilliant but lazy", since you can only pick yourself up once a match with it.
---
I'm playing spiritüò≠
---
Must be your play style.
---
I play mostly killer. I made this meme after a specific situation where a legion stayed near the hook pretending to look for players until someone was forced to save in front of them.
---
Instead of making this base to the game, make that a passive in hex: ruin, so even if the totem is destroyed you still will have it, so the killer sacrifice 1 perk slot and can't have ruin+this the whole match
---
I dunno. I'm a console player. I don't really know how Steam works with names. I think it is because for the off chance they don't change their name that they might get harassed for what they're in the screenshot for.
---
The Deadlights?
---
Needs more cheekbone
---
The game is designed around pallets and windows, that's the core of the chase and the chase is the core of the game. If you're so against them why are you playing this game?
---
There's two killers who ignore them and, surprise surprise, they're the strongest killers in the game. 
---
Who knew?
---
Yeah, you're right. And even then I guess OP didnt go far enough, because if Im playing with a repair speed debuff for the first minute and I see its a Trapper I dont need to constantly check the corners, I can focus on the gen since I'll only need his TR to alert me. Besides I will probably be running some tracking perk like Alert, Empathy or Dark Sense, all of them with Bond because I play solo.
---
The Fear
---
... you eat cats?
---
&gt; I know that majority of bad survivors think that NOED is this one crutch perk that will make you 4K and double pip
---
NOED is weak, it's just fucking stupid to the survivor who gets caught with it sometimes. Gives the killer a way to "bully back" having done nothing but admit that they suck by equipping the perk and expecting to lose the match.
---
If and when you do huntress that's gonna be my wallpaper forever, holy shit.
---
Not with that attitude
---
but I wanna play plague or someone fun that I dont have to sweat with I got the game a month ago and got boosted up to meta builds I cant compete against, any recommendations for fun killers that can actually function at high rank
---
Camping and tunneling (early) prevent someone from being able to play the game at all. Slugging does not.
---
Exactly.  
---
And even if you would be up against a stealthy killer, as soon as someone is in a chase (which could last 1-2 minutes depending on the survivors skill, pallets and tiles arround) you'd still just focus and rush down gens.
---
OPs idea is a step into the right direction, but I don't think that it would fully fix the problem of some games being over within 3-4 minutes.
---
*laughs in the last breath chapter and laurie strode*
---
This goes both ways it‚Äôs not just survivors sending salty messages
---
No, it's NEVER EVER okay to camp at a pallet. You should be looping it. When you camp a pallet you are just wasting it. When you have distance between the killer and yourself, either run to a farther pallet if you can make that, or run halfway into the loop, so you can loop for the longest time.
---
back to back all 4 escapes double de-pips I wanted to play Michael but not anymore
---
Consoles don't want to go up against PC, it wouldn't be fair.
---
These stats are from 250+ days ago? How relevant are they now? 
---
You don‚Äôt have information on Plague, Ghostface Demogorgan, not to mention how much people have improved skill wise using spirit, or how perks like Mom, or anything introduced recently has changed the game.
---
I had these issuea before the update but havent experienced them since, but i do believe you. The game still isnt in a great state
---
Love it
---
I laughed so fucking hard thank you
---
LMFAOOOO
---
The Spider
---
I want to see ghost face cause I‚Äôm a main, this is great
---
I like it but the victim's wrinkles on his hand are confusingly in-line with the side of his head, so it almost looks like they are joined. Different flesh tones or maybe more hair behind the hand might help.
---
The post was made last year, how relevant are those stats now?
---
The Horror
---
Last Breath was free, but I feel ya.
---
If spirit see no scratchy scratchy, she know exactly where you is, at the end of the fucking marks, a slight bit of disorientation is nothing compared to the distance she just made on you, a good spirit gains the advantage on you wether you outsmart her or not, *which is a bad thing*
---
the clown but spookier
---
Unfortunately I work on Halloween, but I'll be taking her to conventions and unnerving the holy hell out of people! And thank you so much!! üíñ
---
Why wouldn't it be fair
---
Passive phasing, when she goes all blinky in and out of reality visually
---
The Shining would make for a better Stephen King killer
---
Here‚Äôs the thing; IT is just an extremely-powerful creature in our realm. The Entity is an even more powerful Entity, in its realm and ours. Also, if IT was as powerful as you make it out to be, then it would just consume the entirety or the world. But why doesn‚Äôt it? Because it doesn‚Äôt have the same power in universes alien to its own. Simple.
---
Haha don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll try take it one at a time, that‚Äôs usually my downfall. 
---
Recommend bioshock if you get a chance to play it though, very atmospheric spooky vibes with incredibly rich world.
---
Well when u hit someone out of ur sprit walk it‚Äôs literally called grudge so probably
---
at times, she will appear to stay in place for like a second or less. this can confuse survivors greatly because after this small time has passed she will appear in a different area
---
New trapper buff he can trow his traps
---
To me freddy is better than Billy. 
---
He has similar map pressure, as long as there is a gen near by he can get there quick. And if there isnt a gen near why even go there? In fact I almost dare say freddy's pressure is better becuase he can fake it and make the survivors run right into his arms.
---
Freddy is better at countering loops. Billy can use his chainsaw to shred pallets or on some small loops by curving, but as long as they are asleep freddy can shut a loop down pretty hard.
---
Freddy is pretty strong on any map, where Billy suffers severely on inside maps or maps with a very strong building.
---
Freddy can slow the game down with his addons and just by putting people to sleep so they run across the map to get a clock and wake up. 
---
Literally the only thing Billy has on freddy (although i admit it's a big one) is one hit downs
---
Wow, seems fair
---
Thank you so much!! I really put a lot into this so I appreciate it. Amanda was my favorite character in the Saw franchise, her being in the game is actually what made me pick it up. I wanted to do both Pig and my decade long giant crush on Amanda/Shawnee Smith justice.
---
PC players play on a much higher framerate. PC players play at much better ping due to not being on wireless. PC killers play with mouse and keyboard. 
---
Console players are at a disadvantage just due to the hardware.
---
Yeah very valid point I did think about that. I‚Äôll make sure to keep different parts separate in future pieces :) thanks for the input
---
Does anyone else want to commit suicide with me?
---
The funniest thing is I went down in my dark basement alone to take these, staring into a strobe light, and I was legit terrified and scared cause my basement is scary as fuck, but looking at the pictures and vids I got I think whatever might have been down there with me would be more scared of me LMAO
---
Oh she‚Äôll be coming in soon don‚Äôt worry üëå
---
This would be an awesome poster! Please make more!
---
Love that user btw, "urban is a bad perk"
---
And the skillchecks affect your repair speed... If the survivors miss 4 skillchecks, which is not much, your ruin has done more work than thanatophobia would do for the whole game. If they look for the totem, they propably use more than 20 secs for it...
---
When she‚Äôs moving around she‚Äôll go through this weird phasing animation from time to time which makes it harder to tell which direction she‚Äôs looking in. You can increase the frequency of it happening and how long it‚Äôll last. (It usually lasts about 2 seconds or so.)
---
Dude I have been looking for someone who would make a comic of the Hillbilly. I can just imagine it in this style. I would pay money for you to make one. 
---
I'm for real.
---
Hell yeah, love the art style so much btw, you got yourself an ig follow
---
She has a private snapchat, but you'll have to get past the 208576463527 snaps of her staring at the camera breathing to get to the shirtless ones üòî
---
Grrr anti-tunneling perks, why can't the devs just let me camp and tunnel all game.
---
But why did you have to do it at all? What purpose did it serve, just to be toxic?
---
TOXIC
---
Yo! That would be awesome! Shoot me over a dm
---
Ohhhhh damn. That looks sick man! Awesome job!
---
Killers on this sub call survivor perks and items crutches all the time, but when a survivor calls out a killer addon or perk for being bs all hell breaks loose lol
---
Ehh sounds a little too close to The Shape
---
The floater /s
---
You could have taken away the "Nobody:" and nothing would have changed
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used it myself but I see a lot of nurses run it
---
The The.
---
Yes I'm standing by this stupide name.
---
I guess you could use a more aggressive version of OPs idea but locking it just for SWF or increase it a bit with every Rank and tie it with the future Reward system.
---
I usually hate such posts but judging by your username, I can see you are already a man of culture, even with very low playtime. Congrats!
---
Honestly what you do is have a good game hook everyone twice and then let them all escape so you don‚Äôt rank up, I enjoy killer but in the first week I go to red ranks and then I don‚Äôt touch it for three weeks cause it‚Äôs so hard to have a fun match without sweating and when they escape I get toxic messages even when I did nothing wrong
---
The allusion
---
Spitting facts
---
Well spirits one of my mains and I still lose all the time so don‚Äôt feel bad. Try using nice addons like hair brooch and the amulet and don‚Äôt be afraid to tunnel lol. Or try using other killers, maybe a 115% speed killer? Plague‚Äôs a good one against red ranks, or maybe Michael? Trapper‚Äôs good if you use darkened traps. Experiment around, but use ruin and bbq still
---
Thank you! There will be more...
---
Would love it. TEW is one of the most underrated game out there. Maybe they can even add that box head guy (forgot his name) as a killer.
---
While Injured you have Dead Hard, being Exposed while healthy it's just bye bye.
---
ok. thank you
---
Mamma mia, I shit myself every time for ONE trap. This is a nightmare!
---
All great ideas, any bloodpoint boost is welcome I reckon, and this is a good way to go about it
---
There will be more soon!
---
Don‚Äôt go to red ranks, you‚Äôll hate it. I‚Äôve made the mistake more than once thinking I‚Äôm ready but every time I suffer.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Jane and plague???
---
Well, then I have been sorely underutilizing my corrupt purge... I tried it a time or 2 and didn‚Äôt see the contaminated status (whatever it is) pop up, so I figured it didn‚Äôt let you infect things.
---
People do this so often against spirit
---
I love the message saying "Nice tunnel" like just dont present you ass to me and I wont hit it after you get unhooked
---
I‚Äôm devotion 5 on ps4, just switched to steam on my shitty laptop because I don‚Äôt have my ps4 for now. I can just about run it. Should still kinda be an achievement but even with the shitty perks I had to run, all solo queue, I got there nearly without ever depipping. Basically just to show how easy it is
---
I am a fool.
---
I just farm as nurse or huntress
---
I play 90% of my games at rank 1 lol. Just switched to steam
---
Estimating for the 17thü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I wouldn‚Äôt know but others might. Not trying to argue for using outdated data but you work with what you have.
---
We know this story is about the smaller girl sleeping with the taller girls man.  
---
Question is....who's the man?
---
They are both S tier
---
Hell yeaüòÇüòÇ
---
I know right, like I‚Äôm gonna go for who I see, if you just got unhooked I‚Äôm not gonna ignore you cause you were just hooked just don‚Äôt show yourself to me and I won‚Äôt go after you
---
I mean fun is subjective but I doubt you will have much fun at high ranks if you don't play nurse or spirit.
---
I certainly don't. So now I'm playing no ruin huntress, whom I've never played before, to practice hatchets. I get genrushed everygame but it's funny.
---
As for fun killers, It's obviously down to personal prefrence. Plague is really fun, I personally like pig and ghostface too but I wouldn't play them in red ranks unless your a sucker for punishment.
---
Hag can be fun too, though I guess you own her because getting to rank 6 without ruin is stupidly hard.
---
who do you main as killer?
---
This was a glitch for a while, you could hit survivors over and over again and they wouldn't fall out of the trap.  Once that was fixed it didn't take long for it to be impossible to pick up survivors from traps half of the time
---
Don't get me wrong tho
---
He might not be strong, but he's still fun to play as, especially with STBFL and a pin add-on that makes hitting Deep-Wounded survivors with Feral Frenzy put them into the Broken status.
---
You can basicly get free STBFL stacks from everyone by hitting them another time and once fully stacked go on a rampage. He also still slows the game down (thanks to both mending and Thanato) which makes it easier to go on said rampage.
---
The game starts with 5 survivors and twice the amount of gens spawn / required to be completed... enough time for someone to do some work on a gen.  The killer shoukd get like .33% gen repair speed so its really hard to determine if the guy helping you is only getting close to you.... to build the madness.
---
God no, We don't need more obnoxious endgame surv perks.
---
I enjoy playing spirit plague billy huntress and ghostface, sometimes nurse but I play Xbox so it‚Äôs a bit harder for me to play nurse
---
I sent you my exposed status .. Pls reply..
---
I'm not  a survivor main. Are nurse and hillbilly dead now?
---
Why not just It.  Upper case I and lower case t.
---
Oh and another fun thing to try with spirit is using devour hope and haunted ground without ruin. Half the time it doesn‚Äôt work at all and you get shit on but when it works, it really works :D
---
Glad Im not alone in thinking this
---
I just only played hag ro get ruin cause I heard it was good and then bought bbq with shards shes fun but i think I'd rather sweat blood with plague than losing with a killer who's good, which demozializes me even more
---
Im sorry. Remember rank doesnt matter at the moment. Fun does. Try to stay in lower ranks and have fun dude
---
Now I want Dead by Daylight comics to be a thing.
---
Doc is still viable (though heavily dependent on perks). I got from purple ranks to rank 1 as doctor last reset all thanks to coulrophobia + distressing.
---
Or higher ranks, whichever you say
---
No shapeshifting
---
So he would be called shapeshifter but not shapeshift?
---
^
---
You can do that without putting pressure on the blade
---
If it‚Äôs killer let me know and I‚Äôll make one for every killer lmao
---
Surge causes the failed skill check animation if a survivor is on the generator when it occurs.
---
So you gotta let me know
---
Its the value related to the distance between hooks, he never said it made or subtracted hooks you freakin potato XD
---
I always get ace and laurie perks mixed in with de ja vu and dark sense
---
Glad i found someone like-minded
---
Yes, just like how the shape isn‚Äôt literally a 2 dimensional trapezoid following you around the map.
---
Didn‚Äôt know about closing chests, thank you
---
Big fan of meme builds. Thanks!
---
The way he just turns around after you make it to the gate is priceless 
---
He can't quite comprehend how he fucked up that much
---
She's my main. Not gonna lie, part of the reason she became my main is because of her awesome outfit
---
Ummm, gotta use some med kit, oh, well, I have broken. I think this killer would be very funny to play and play against
---
Myers
---
She's just cute factor 100
---
I'm a killer main, so shoot your shot. I eagerly await your post lol
---
Love you too üôè
---
That's sick my man
---
Thanks! No mither is always fun.
---
Well, sweaty Survivor mains have been whining about her a lot. The only Killer who can be active, rather than reactive, really tilts some of the worst people off of their bullying game.
---
And BHVR does seem to cater to the worst and whiniest sometimes.
---
Holy shit I can't wait dor crossplay. Most people I know have the game on console because cause it's free there, those cheap fucks
---
Myers is fun! And if you do the math it's not that bad. Let's say you level up five times every match you play which is fair enough. That's 60 matches. Yeah, I know that it's like 30 hours of playtime but you can go for other achievements while playing him. If you do not enjoy playing Myers it must suck though.
---
Username doesnt check out.
---
Adrenaline pops when Noed pops. 
---
Noed beats Adrenaline.
---
This popping would make endgame saves so easy, Everyone has 3 health states and borrowed time- Busted as fuck.
---
It's already ridiculously easy to save endgame.
---
That's interesting, though I'm not sure I agree - it gets increasingly difficult to Wake Up as the game goes on, and one hit from Fred puts you right back into the dream.
---
For me, the dream is roughly analogous to Pig's traps - it's something to slow the game a little, give the survivors something else to do.
---
making a whole new account just to harass me is way more disturbing than replying to people and arguing with their ideas.
---
Yes it is. but a perk that only activates during endgame should have bigger effects.
---
It's up to 100% with performance. Sure, you could optimally farm by using BBQ and nothing else, but that's playing 1 perk games for up to 175% bonus BP. Up to.
---
Swf affects the match a lot and needs to be addressed as it‚Äôs own issue. I think telling the killer who‚Äôs in a party on the in match ui helps a lot. As for call outs I‚Äôm hesitant to say give swf straight numbers nerfs cause that feels like shit for them, but maybe having a friend in a chase prevents this buff?
---
shouldn't it be the other way around?
---
A lil teabag never hurt nobody
---
Even in her prime she was at best the bottom of b tier or mid c tier... Her strong end game was her only redeeming quality, and she was pretty powerless against a swf or just a team that understands the cues of how to change your approach while someone is trapped. Now shes got nothing, and honestly, even though i freakin adore piggy, she is the single worst character in the game. Underpowered, negligible abilities, extremely slow, just... all around terrible... They have killers that can phase through structures and insta down survivors without addons/perks, and here we have someone who is too slow to even set up.
---
Ruin ResidentSleeper
---
I mean those used to be the exact numbers if all 4 of survivors and the killer used these sooo maybe using metres would have helped?
---
It does, and that's the side facing away from him. Where his fingers wrap around.
---
Fat shaming clown I see, we live in a society :(
---
all it means is somebody dc‚Äôd before the game started.
---
I beleve around 115 percent movement speed
---
Sexy legs
---
I'm not going to run a perk to counter one killer I might get. You can't know what killer you're going against so running iron will every game is ridiculous. If you walk, she catches you with collision, if you walk in a less predictable direction she hears you or sees the grass shake. "Position correctly" is so vague and useless that I don't even know how to go about debunking it. And that doesn't even talk about her "mindgame"
---
why the trapper looking happy
---
The word and the concept of a battle pass is just so cringe, I really hope they rethink it cause it reeeeeaaally doesn't fit the style of the game.
---
Hag B tier? She should be S, I think
---
girl i dont even know u. u r keep spamming PMs and comments constantly and involving me in ur pickle romance...wtf
---
At least they put a date on it. I wouldn't trust "Soon(tm)" for a second.
---
That would be INFINITELY worse. Even +30% speed but no exposed is a waking nightmare
---
Well, I can't really pay for something like that right now, I do have bills I need to pay. I get paid on Friday, if you could wait till then we could discuss this then.
---
Did you get the bear trap on a chain from the old killer prototypes the devs showed off once?
---
Do you smell it too?

In all honesty, who TF plays no mither unless you're memeing
---
Its so sad that killers get bbq&amp;chilli with a strong effect. and then survivors get WGLF.... great..
---
Time for reparations Nea
---
I mean the problem isn't that they're bad perks, the problem is that compared to shit like DS or balanced landing in high ranks they really won't make the cut. Same things happens to killer, have fun trying hangman's trick or coulrophobia or something at high ranks.
---
Amazing work dude would love to see more
---
Don‚Äôt dump it before.  Event webs are usually better.

I‚Äôd go with Trapper or Freddy.  Doc is for meme builds only.

That's amazing!

wow this is really well done. congrats to you
---
Im hoping for the event
---
Honestly lol I play spirit a lot and there is a HUGE difference between survivors that know how to face her and those who just dub her OP and run straight lines dropping pallets randomly as they go.
---
Never run a straight line for a long period of time. 
---
Double back as much as possible (just be careful not to run into the phasing spirit) 
---
Walk when appropriate. 
---
Bring iron will
---
Vaults can work, pallets are a waste (when shes phasing) 
---
If she stands still run AWAY never ever ever toward her
---
Follow these rules and you will last a lot longer against spirit. She is still strong, but there IS counter play
---
Top tier design choice there. The fact that the lore descriptions really help give a feeling to the motivation for each killer should really help you bring out their uniqueness.
---
Have you ever played spirit? Scratch marks don't just end where the survivor is, they fade in slowly. Meaning if a survivor is running the end of the trail will be a little bit before where the survivor is. Using this info when you're running from a spirit is really helpful because you can use it on them if you know they will end their power right where they think you'll be. It's all about the mind game and out playing the other person, again *which is a good thing* sure you can argue that ultimately they gain distance on you. But that's what killers are supposed to do, gain distance on you. By your logic that makes wraith op, or maybe idk, nurse. If you want to keep complaining then go ahead but at this rate you might as well not play the game because every single killers base movement is faster than a survivors. Or maybe you get the point now? Or you can be stubborn and keep complaining about something that is completely balanced. It's not a bad thing that there are some strong killers.
---
I wouldn't get my hopes up too high. I'd say it'd start around like the 15th and would last until early November.
---
This is soo sick! Definitely my new wallpaper.
---
I say just remove NOED and Adrenaline. Both are obnoxious to play against and aren‚Äôt necessary for the game. I get that adrenaline is a meg perk so maybe just rework that to something along the lines of. ‚ÄúWhen you finish a generator, gain a 150% speed boost for 3 seconds without exhausting yourself‚Äù. Not too OP but still potential for builds with perks like poised.
---
Basically a m1 killer with 32m tr. The biggest problem in high ranks is time. Survivors are repairing gens so quick these days even with ruin. A viable killer in high ranks in my opinion is a killer that you can start right away the game from the beginning and/or has a power that helps end chases as quick as possible. That's why spirit and nurse can be considered top tier followed by Freddy, hag.
---
Demogorgon is basically an m1 killer which requires a lot of time to set their portals well and activate them and it doesn't reduces the time to end chases. He's  an much worst Freddy. He's probably slightly above wraith or clown. But he's worst than pig, myeres, plague, huntress, ghostface.
---
But, also in my opinion, every killer can be usable in high ranks. But only some of them can preform well against a well coordenated team rank 1 in a tough map. Demogorgon against 4 rank 1 in coldwin farm is totally owned lol
---
Which she did. He wasted way too much time and allowed other survivors to finish generators.
---
I dunno about you, but I play videogames for my own enjoyment  not for others.
---
...just as i thought...delusional!
---
If you want to have fun, try to let your team escape, even if u die. Usually this is ok at ranks 6-12 since they have some sense of the game. At lower ranks (13+), people just don't know what they're doing and you end up feeling frustrated.  
---
At higher ranks (5-), you don't need this build any more unless you just want to do it.  
---
But here's the build:  
---
Ace in the hole, Plunderer's Instint, X, X  
---
X = any perk you want (usually I go Deliverance and Dead Hard/Decisive Strike).
---
I love this! Love the old vintage style that's reminiscent of the EC comics.
---
Just one thing, Dwight's looking a little... old. He's pretty young. That's my only constructive critique :)
---
In terms of skill to use
---
These are just killers with little on them due to prestige or low playtime, and there's no event specific add ons to miss out on for them so they're the best ones to build up now before Blight kicks off and bonus BP is all over the place.
---
Why are we here, just to suffer.
---
This is absolutely awesome
---
seems like a killer that the entity might enjoy seeing how he fairs actually running around being scared shittless for the rest of his life
---
**Angried Noises**
---
You do realize that slashers die all the time, right?
---
I had my Auto Adjust checked to on for Resolution and that was about it. My Quality setting is set to low and Resolution is 100%
---
Switch has garbage hardware and DBD is garbage at optimisation, that's a hard no chief.
---
While yes PC can get higher frames by turning off vsync, but it's not even a setting to turn off in game, because all they're going for is the 60 fps and nothing more.
---
This is amazing, and because i fear missing these if you do more, i‚Äôm gonna do it, i‚Äôm gonna follow you on reddit
---
Yeah, that's what I was doing, just a general example that was coincidentally the old values.
---
 My power was out which is why I hadn't responded to anything
---
YES!!! I would love to see a Hag one ngl!!!
---
I want to see you do one with Claudette, this Lois amazing!
---
I always go to save, but no lie I rarely get as angry as I do when I save someones ass only to have them run straight out the exit as I get downed.
---
To me, the funny thing about this here is how totally not-true it is if you watched the latest Halloween movie. The Shape doesn't give a damn about Laurie Strode in that movie, the only reason he wound up near her is because he was following other prey. The reality in that movie is that Laurie was obsessed with him, not the other way around.
---
Can you do the hag? That would look cool. It's just her eating Meg's hand
---
&gt; Switch has garbage hardware
---
LOL
---
Just saying, wouldn't Nurse and Nea make more sense? Nea is supposed to be Nurse's Survivor.
---
Unless you intend to make her the killer in a future comic, which by all means please do.
---
It‚Äôs fucking awesome. You hit the nail on the coffin. My only criticism if any is that Dwight looks more like a older Japanese CEO than Dwight. Still recognizable though.
---
Pretty dope
---
So if Pennywise does actually get added, I wonder what his attacks would be like.
---
I mean, in the movies he never uses a weapon per se, so I m wondering if he will transform his arm to slash you or do a bite rush at you while shape shifting.
---
The It
---
because everyone wants to play killer so there are longer queue times
---
The simple fact is at red ranks you need a tool for extra mobility, and a tool to help with loops.
---
That simply deletes every killer as a possibility besides nurse, spirit, Billy and freddy.
---
Mayyyyybe hag or demo if you are feeling confident. Or huntress if you are a literal trained sniper assassin.
---
But even if we count those extra 3 (most people dont. Some dont even count freddy) that's 7 killers that are even potentially usable out of 17! Not even half the roster
---
Well, this is a backend update. So my first guess would be that's its just something for the server.
---
Thank you lmao. I've honestly given up with these people. Most of them are just stubborn and don't want to take advice or help.
---
Here is the thing; It wasn't the bullying that destroyed Pennywise, it was the Fact that they weren't scared of him and used it against him.
---
I dont play a whole lot of killer but a lot of killers have been using it with thano. One was a freddy with both, ruin and pgtw and they made doing gens really hard
---
If the killer is face camping then the survivor isn‚Äôt getting points anyway since they‚Äôll probably die on first hook. Might as well dc and start a new match with a different killer.
---
Right, so all the survivors that dislike prayer beads and omegablink and insta saw billy and moris are all just full of shit.
---
Everything killers have in their disposal is perfectly balanced and fair, but survivors? they need to get gutted. 
---
Thanks for proving how biased killer mains are lmao
---
No ones saying survivours can't be toxic, this sub is full of killer mains complaining about toxic survivours. Saying that 'survivours are just toxic' and then turning around and saying 'but killers are only toxic because survivours made them that way' is just stupid. 
---
Like both mine and OP's posts were saying, we've both had toxic ghost faces (like the one in the video) behave like cunts for no reason. From a survivours perspective, it's the killers who act like this that make survivours toxic. It's not just t-bagging for us, it's tunnelling and face camping and people 'baiting' you with the hatch/exit (pretending to let you go but then downing you). 
---
Yeah sure, survivours can be toxic too, but christ, the second someone says 'toxic killer,' all the killer mains get defensive as hell.
---
Finally, a killer that's weak to butt dances.
---
yush
---
This game is great.  Ignore whiners.  I recommend checking out a few streams or YouTube beginner tips.
---
Ooh good point. Tbh I just have a soft spot for Claudette she‚Äôs like the only survivor I properly played over the years haha
---
I know it's fucking pathetic
---
Crossplay between consoles? Sure.
---
Between consoles and Pc? No thanks, MnK allows for people to follow loops more tightly, not to mention console killers would just get bullied more with how bad our framerates and overall hardware are.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm looking forward to doing the hag!
---
You pulled it off because there was a pallet right there. It‚Äôs not hard to avoid The Cannibal‚Äôs chainsaw attack when you‚Äôre hiding on the other side of a pallet.
---
Why not just dodge the hits as much as you can?
---
Exactly. I feel like the only person left who actually enjoys playing against spirit.
---
I would rather face her than nurse or Billy that's for sure
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs true, shot myself in the foot picking a really weird angle to draw.
---
Nobody cares that you think nobody cares. Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Hah, fair enough. Also I'm really excited to see what Leigon will look like in the future. I think I'm already in love with your style. Keep up the good work!

New Survivor: The Nurse
---
When you're working on a gen, vomiting, and someone cleanses themselves next to you and then work on your gen...
---
Nurse and billy are really boring to play against. It's the same thing over and over. With spirit it's at least a little bit spicy
---
Look man there‚Äôs no grey area with these people killer=bad   Survivor=can do whatever the fuck they want and still somehow be in the right
---
What do you mean there is only nurse and spirit.
---
Pull up twitch or play on your phone during ques.  You also have time to set up perks and do the bloodweb.
---
Ho yes sorry i'm dumb ^^'
---
This comment made me laugh aloud that‚Äôs a very valid point he really does. It‚Äôs my bad for picking a strange angle.
---
I'm talking about the fact that all the survivors except me, the 12, we're low rank with good perks. Also the level 20 hag destroyed us pretty quick. A few games before this I matched up with 2 8's and a 10, we played against a level 19 spirit with only one yellow perk that downed us all in the first 2 minutes of the game. Is this just people who haven't played in a while coming back to the game? Or was wondering if it's some kind of glitch that doesn't show the correct rank on PS4.
---
Really? To me it seemed like Myers was actively hunting Laurie down in the newer one as well. The H20 movies focus on the Laurie Myers sibling relationship which I found forced and quite frankly awkward. 
---
The latest Halloween franchise seems to focus on a Laurie vs Myers dynamic as rivals. An unstoppable force versus an impenetrable wall. While Myers does leave a trail of bodies towards Laurie, it seems like he was targeting his favorite prey the entire time. Just my opinion though.
---
Good idea, hopelessly terrible execution
---
I loved the old EC comics when I was a kid and this is on point. I love it.
---
I feel the solution to this is to make other killers viable at higher ranks instead of the opinion I see which is nerf the strongest killers. You want diversity in the killers you see? How about make it so someone other than Spirit, Nurse and Billy feel good to play when it is Rank 1 vs 4 Rank 1 survivors? I love Bing-Bong Boy, Myers and Clown. I got P3 on them and have every perk. I can only play them and have fun if I am running a Mori and use it ASAP due to the immense time pressure I feel compared to any of the Killer Trinity.
---
I feel sorry for that rank 19 with 4 popular perks and red key with 2 addons. Guy mustve watched tons of yt videos and know all the theory of the game but have zero practice skill
---
Dew it, I‚Äôd love a ghost face/myers cover for a screensaver because this is so fucking cool
---
15cent? Bargain
---
*F i n a l l y,   m o r e   A c e   m a i n s.*
---
Honestly if the killer is camping while you're on the ground then I'd be ok with people disconnecting because that's just not ok but if you're on the hook then you can just die and start a match and get at least some points.
---
Definitely! Would love to do some short comics in the same style with the different killers backstories. Feel like they would really suit it.
---
Oh my god, you are fucking stupid, every other chase power killer has some kind of punishment for not succeeding, spirit doesn‚Äôt, she has no stun, her power is omni-directional, and doing what you say you should do gives you like, what, 2mm on her, which is, again, *a bad thing* but I wouldn‚Äôt expect that someone who genuinely thinks a killer with a singular, inconsistent, counter strategy is healthy for the game to understand something this simple.
---
Yea ik it just gets to especially since currently it seems to take forever to get into lobbies as a killer.
---
I run it in my freddy build along with save the best for last.
---
wow 
---
BHVR hire them now 
---
plz and ty
---
These votes should be flipped. Not only is the main comment a massive woosh, the "No." response was also a joke.
---
I‚Äôll make sure one in future fits phone screens better üëå
---
cross-platform
---
Buddy in the earlier comments people said ghostface t-bagging was toxic for teabagging and then they had the fucking gull to say most survivors don‚Äôt t-bagüòÇ u got it flipped Man U people outnumber us 4:1
---
that'd be dope
---
Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôll be like 30 min lobby times. Everyone will play survivor. 
---
As a low tier garbage killer, I don‚Äôt run spirit. So at least one person won‚Äôt. But see first statement.
---
Get this on Redbubble! I need this as a phone case, an art print, a cushion and on a t shirt
---
my apologies, i will redesign.
---
Demogordanramsey
---
I guess, but why does it matter if the survivor gets their extra 190 points or not. A DC is a lot faster and they‚Äôll get a ton more points spending time in matches where the killer plays properly.
---
Indeed.
---
Yeah but wouldn't he have had to played enough to unlock all those perks and gotten some experience?
---
Ok u/leakingpickle . Whatever you say
---
Would love to see this as actual comic containing lore, beautiful job, hyped for your next one!
---
Sadly it‚Äôs illegal to sell fan art for personal profit but I‚Äôll definitely get some art up there. Been on my to-do list for quite a while.
---
Yeah the fuck happened here?
---
Awesome job. Please, please, please do one with The Legion? Loved the colors, they really add up to it.
---
It'll would stop wait times but people throw a tantrum when someone talk about PC Switch PS4 XBOX cross- platform for dead by daylight.
---
I am constantly slugging.  Let me explain why unbreakable isn't that useful for most sluggers. Very rarely I slug to slug the whole team.  Most of the time I slug to immediately initiate another chase.  I have zero intention of coming back for the slug, I expect them to get up with the help of their teammates (but I use knockout to make it that much harder to find them)  I would say that it's simply not good enough at countering what it's meant to counter.
---
r/videosthatendtooearly
---
‚ÄúHow dare you run a weaker killer? What fuckery is this.
---
What about some short stories? Would be really cool!!!
---
Myers is definitely happening. Halloween is one of my all time favourite horror films so it‚Äôll be there!
---
The hatch is in shack while the basement is also there.
---
Which is why I usually hate text especially in an environment like the internet but at least that misunderstanding got corrected :)
---
Hopefully this fixes the issue I've been having with DBD ever since the Dedicated Servers were disabled. 
---
Every game I get booted out for "No Network Connection" despite the fact I'm very much connected.
---
Haven't been able to play a full game since, so I've just been playing TF2 and SAR.
---
Maybe but then there's still a wait period of no points. And any points is a help if you're leveling up killers or survivors. Plus camping isn't not playing properly as devs made insidious a perk and haven't stopped the bandwagon on camping.
---
You can escape a camper but it takes more effort than just freely getting rescued off a hook. Spoken as a killer and survivor
---
Depending of the map the Demo can have huge map pressure, with him it's better to set up one or 2 portals and then start looking for survivors rather than setting up 1 or 2 more, his perks are the only bad thing about him since Surge is the only kinda good one but it still doesn't stop him from being a effective killer, the biggest problem with him as of now is the portal setting speed which is quite slow and not worth using addons to increase since he has way better addons, and I don't think comparing him with Freddy is a good way to measure him, their playstyles arent really similar and the way their TP works is different, with Demo being able to choose and hide Portals while Freddy can only go to non active gens
---
From my time playing Demo he is way more of a mid than a low
---
Me too! I‚Äôll try get some little faux comic pages done of backstory for the killers! Thank you for the support!
---
Yep. That pallet fucked me real good (as survivor) in my last game.
---
maybe arent enough rank 19 survivor but for sure there are too many idiots in this game
---
Glad I‚Äôve done them justice! I have a couple but have always loved them
---
&gt;cause tons of popular streamers have difficulty getting wins at high ranks with bad killers even with best perks and add ons.
---
Cause tons of them are dogshit or not sweating
---
You might as well it almost has just as much to do with the job of a killer. Pallets are suddenly good for you and windows will help you more than them.
---
&gt;Prayer beads does nothing inside the terror radius and outside of it, they can be countered by just listening for footsteps and paying attention. Impossible, I know, but the counter does exist.
---
 I do agree. It's hard to counter but still possible.  
---
But this is something like a compromise from my side.  
---
I can see why 99% of players would perceive prayer beads as OP. And if 99% can't deal with it, it might be too strong.  
---
So yes, there is a counter. But not many players are able to use it.  
---
It's similiar with NOED.  
---
Noed is average at best. It's not a good perk. But \~75% of survivors aren't able to counter that perk, which is why they complain.
---
&gt; With OoO 
---
I personally don't have a problem with OoO. It's the OoO-SWF setup which can make this perk ridicolous. Only one guy needs to have the OoO vision on you and via voice coms the whole squad will have 100% map awarness and know where the killer is at all times.  
---
I still don't care about it, since most of the time you'll still be able to deal with it. It's the OoO-Toxic-Teabag-Trys by SWF squads which is bothering me.
---
&gt;  Instaheals, there is no counterplay. 
---
Agree. Insta-Heals are in my opinion the most overpowered thing on paper, next to SWF Shenanigans.  
---
Killers are allready pressured by having not enough time to act.  
---
Adding a "second life" is just bullshit.  
---
Some might say that a red mori is stronger, and I would partly agree. But even though red moris will make you kill all survivors and cut the game in half, they still make you depip (or black pip) in most of the cases (in red ranks).  
---
So if you use them, you kill, but you'll still lose.  
---
That can't be said about insta heals.
---
Not sure why, maybe they didn‚Äôt like the killer you were playing as?
---
What research did he do to locate Laurie? Did the journalists mention Laurie to him? I don't think they did. He got his mask, his implements, and went to work in town. He had no idea that she was there. It had been so very long since he was locked away there was every chance she was gone or died, and that wouldn't have changed anything about the movie until the granddaughter went to the new Strode home, Shape in tow. The only reason the Shape went after the granddaughter was his forever-unchanging modus operandi of victim search and murder. Laurie was the one that ruined marriages and created a deathtrap because of her trauma. I saw it as a reversal, and that makes it a better movie to me. I could be wrong. Really glad they made it at any rate.
---
Sorry, forgot about from a survivor POV too
---
Luckily I never ran into killers who messaged me angrily, or at all to be exact, unless it was a compliment.
---
So Myers
---
Ayyy there's the toxic asshole I know and love. Listen I'm not going to try to explain this to you much more. Go play spirit, learn for yourself. If she's as op as you think then you should be able to win every game and make it to rank 1 in no time at all. In fact why stop there? Go pro, theres a few decent tournaments with good prize pools. Actually you know what scratch that, I think with how intelligent you are world domination is the way to go. Yep, see you on the news in a few weeks Overlord jojofan69420
---
Don‚Äôt selfcare/medkit right as I get you off the hook. I need all the alruism I can get damnit!
---
Yeah, but he's less humanoid than pennywise
---
I dont really get it.. such coincidence that the last guy has key..
---
If I recall we used to have a weirdo with a chainsaw and a humming bunny but those were the old days ~ literally every high rank survivor these days
---
The game did its best to match players with a lvl 20 killer.  There isn‚Äôt much of a difference between 16-20 even with perks.  The odds of finding 4 rank 20 survivors all queuing in the same region are minuscule.  I‚Äôm not even sure if rank reset goes as low as 20.
---
I played a somewhat similar scenario two night ago.  I was rank 7 using my lvl one hag with 1 perk and no add ons (daily).  The survivors were ranks 2-2-4-4 with meta perk builds.  I 3 K‚Äôd and let the 4th go.
---
The game is trying to find decent matchups in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Rank itself doesn‚Äôt mean much.  It could have been an alt account, a red rank survivor main doing dailies or possibly someone that hasn‚Äôt played in a long time.
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I think the 10th or somewhere around there? I heard something about an update coming very near..
---
It‚Äôs a good perk now after its rework.
---
But do the feet go Pit-Pat?
---
-They scream after being killed.
---
It should also start when your the last person in the trial to find hatch.
---
Its a part of my main build with Wraith. Its DL, Thanat, Ruin and Nurses. It is quite strong in mid to late game and after you get 4-5 stacks with it, the game is essentially over by that point. It is probably the best build to run with him and it is a fun as hell build to run. I have tried it on other killers and i dont like it but it is still an all around very good perk.
---
awe sweet! what survivor/ killer?
---
Well even if they did DC then they lost 2 pips and their blood points.
---
Of course
---
It's fairly underwhelming. It only really shines when you're already in a situation where you've either won the game, or done so well that you'll get at least a pip in most cases. The numbers on it are pretty mediocre, which unfortunately they have to be given it can be stacked with something like Thana.
---
Best Case scenario with all 4 survivors alive: 8 tokens (Every survivor hooked twice, with the obsession switching via some method during the match) 24% penalty.  At this point the game has dragged on long enough that it should already be over one way or another. 
---
For comparison, old Dying Light gave you a 25% penalty at the cost of tunneling one poor soul down, and utilizing a Mori if you want to ensure quick application of the debuff. All the issues of camping/tunneling aside, even then it was considered a sub-par perk, but absolutely crushing if you got it off early due to the fact there would still probably be ~3 generator left to do. 
---
With the new Dying Light, most of the time it just reads "Turn the action speed bars of the non-obsession survivors Red without really slowing them down a meaningful amount. Until the obsession dies or d/cs)
---
If the penalty functioned like STBFL where any accrued tokens stuck around after the obsession died then I could at least justify running it in a thematic build filled with slow down perks. But right now it doesn't give you enough bang for the perk slot used.
---
Mmm to be honest I can't say much about that. But you must also consider that Billy punishes stealth play much better thanks to his chainsaw. A experienced Billy that gets too close will most likely just one-shot you down. In addition his mobillity is just absurdely time-efficient, even when said efficiency also depends a bit on the map. On Rotten Fields you can literally free roam from almost anywhere, the same doesn't go for in-door maps such as The Game or Hawkins tho.
---
In regards to the loop counter, yes, Freddy is much better at loops than Billy, but that's the main power of the Dream Snares anyway. Similar to Hag, when you're being chased by a Freddy, you shouldn't loop too much but just make one or two rounds, drop the pallet, and head to the next destination. Sacrificing pallet-efficiency is sadly kinda necessary against both of those. Being stationary against those two is a death sentence.
---
theres an unknown update today that doesnt require a download, so it coooould be them turning on the event, because thats all in the game already. But it also could totally not be that.
---
Well you know us killer mains have a blast chatting it up.
---
Omg this is amazing!!! Will there be licensed killer covers as well because if so Myers and Laurie would be amazing!
---
u/Jon-Rob is the original poster and had posted this to reddit last week.
---
They really need to do something. It looks like a shitty ps2 game.
---
The wait period is there whether you dc or die on hook, I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôd be making more points leaving and spending that time in a different match since struggling gives you next to nothing. Insidious is intended to be used for gen camping, not hook camping. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a blood point penalty for killers that camp hooks. If it‚Äôs a face camping leatherface, billy, or 99% Myers your chances of escaping are super low. Spoken as a red rank killer and survivor.
---
Queue times tend to be longer during the day and shorter at night around peak hours (usually like 10pm - 3am EST on a good day).
---
On xbox though, i‚Äôve been noticing that my killer queues are a lot shorter during the day as of recently.
---
i dont think my idea of hope is that strong. i mean the negating hit effect can not even get used sometimes. or maybe it is? im not sure
---
A leak of game files indicated the 9th
---
I have literally no idea how to link things as I use reddit exclusively on mobile, but if someone else doesn‚Äôt link it for you, you can certainly find it on the official forums
---
3.5k hours here and ima drop a fun build for ALOT OF killers (if you want a specific one reply with the killer you want a fun build for and I‚Äôll make one) and a brief description on the build!
---
Trapper (speedy trapper)-
---
||Play with your food||Save the best for last||Whispers||Ruin||||This build is actually pretty good. It relies on saving your obsession and not smacking em. Since trapper is a m1 killer- save the best for last is really effective and those cool downs help. Also by not hitting your obsession you will gain speed from play with your food. Whispers is there to locate and ruin is so u don‚Äôt just get smacked. This is my personal fav build for trapper!||||||||||||||||Hillbilly (surprise mf)- ||speed limiter||noed||||This build relies on an add on and one perk (the other three perks are just your choice. Basically your chainsaw will not be a one shot the whole game thanks to the add on -speed limiter. When the generators finish, it will go back to being a one shot chainsaw and catch everyone off guard! Really not that great but it has its hilarious moments.|||||||||||||||||Wraith (find my ruin I dare you)-||Ruin||devour hope||haunted grounds||thrill of the hunt|| This build relies on the fact that wraith is soo good at getting that first hit. Thrill of the hunt will let you know that a totem is being touched and you zoom over there and smack em. Also all the hex totems are good and if u get 3 stacks of decor hope u basically win!|||||||||||||||||Nurse isn‚Äôt fun don‚Äôt play her if u want fun||||||||||||||||Huntress(crossmaps 360 no scope call of duty professional) ||BBQ and chili||bitter murmor|| nurses calling|| infectious fright|| basically just aura perks so when u see an aura chuck a hatchet at it and bam u got a kill congrats!||||||||||||Hag(body blocker hag)-||waterlogged shoe||scarred hang||Thes two add ons will give your traps collision so u can block people from leaving places and other things. The amount of creative plays you can get with this build is unreal!|||||||||||||Michael (no terror radius)-Just run monitor and abuse and bang! U have 0 terror radius tier one and tiny terror radius tier two! Enjoy this took me a while plz upvote lol
---
Myers definitely!
---
?
---
One thing is for certain, ghost face, myers, and huntress would be the scariest comics whilist being the most intense
---
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the toxic asshole‚Äù like, bruh, you have no right to say that, when you did it first, cunt.
---
And second, I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs easy, she‚Äôs unbalanced, you bloody idiot.
---
What's your killer rank?
---
the negating hit effect only lasts 40 seconds. its not gonna get used most of the time.
---
Finally, The Hag is appreciated.
---
Imagine getting good survivors in your matches at rank 1
---
It‚Äôs PS4, and I didn‚Äôt feel like going through the effort of making a YouTube clip incase it got no views
---
Aw hell yeah. Thanks for the feedback
---
Same man! I look forward to it &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs soooo sucking different. You can describe me as a shape, because I am a shape. You cannot describe me as a shapeshifter, because I cannot shapeshift.
---
This is such a myth Freddy, plague, shape, hag and loads more are all good until rank 3.
---
probably The Demon or some shit
---
Thanks for the quick feedback. I appreciate it.
---
I agree with everything you said lol I think it just comes down to what you value more, the 1 hit downs or the slowdown + loop countering.
---
Either way I'd say freddy and Billy are neck and neck. Same tier for sure. I think most people just favor Billy's 1 hit downs and near non-existent cooldown on his power.
---
Are you sure he had a key? If there were 3 DC‚Äôs the hatch would‚Äôve been open regardless
---
Survivors can hit every great skillcheck against no ruin and you shouldn't be down 2-3 gens after your first down unless you're doing something wrong/ got a shit map
---
Spicy
---
It hasn't been announced yet.
---
What does the withered blight event actually entail apart from cool cosmetics? I only started playing back in August kinda time...
---
Whatever you want. How does 8:00 sound?
---
I thought it was for matchmaking.
---
Did the dedicated servers go offline?  
---
Are we back to P2P?  
---
and on a less importune question, does P2P work in Canada ( I recall that protocol being blocked, country wide )
---
Maybe put a hook somewhere
---
Hey man I didn't call you stupid, you literally started name calling and rude shit first don't try to flip it on me. Why don't you take a walk? Take a load off amigo, don't want your blood pressure to rise up. And when I say try to play spirit I mean that seriously, you clearly don't understand how to play against spirit so go play her, then you'll understand her weaknesses.
---
Plz make more
---
How does everyone feel about Archives being released very soon?
---
Why is it when I play killer it has to "search for a match" for what seems like ages after I tap search for match? And then once one is found, I still have to wait on survivors to join. It used to be if I hit search for match, it would instantly take me to a lobby and wait for survivors. Am I missing something?
---
I thought I had read that the chest only gives notification if they don't finish searching it all the way. Like they start to open it but then stop before it's done.
---
I will!
---
*you mess with crabbo, you get the stabbo*
---
so I don‚Äôt think we know exactly yet but it‚Äôs gonna include the archives and maybe a battle pass type thing? they‚Äôre being very secretive but they say it‚Äôs gonna be a huge update
---
The same way Clown feels slurping on severed fingers.
---
Seriously though.  If it started you off at full health and only showed your broken status once injured to other survivors, it might not be terrible.  It's just horrible when the killer knows you have it immediately and knows you can get back up.  At least this way, he still might not know if you got up with unbreakable, and might let you get yourself up more than once.
---
Been playing for a while now after a long ass time(I think last I played Legion had just been added), got to rank 9 or 8 since I started playing again, which was around 1 week and a half ago
---
Mmm tasty
---
so if a survivor doesnt have an item, the killer becomes an M1?
---
*is using a toolbox that causes the exposed status effect.* *hears heartbeat.* ‚ÄúUh oh.‚Äù *drops toolbox.* ‚Äúokay we‚Äôre good.‚Äù That first teachable perk would be op af
---
So to add context, it was recently revealed that matchmaking will find players who are 6 ranks near you. And this scenario just happens randomly to me (I was rank 9). And the rank 8 and 20 are not SWF, since one joined ages after the other.
---
So how is this fair, I do not know.
---
Yes he has key.. its a rare one..and yes you got a point..
---
Would SO collect...especially if it was done in a style crossed between Heavy Metal and Savage Sword of Conan.
---
This is the best thing ever.
---
they didnt say, they just said it might interfere with matchmaking.
---
What  Archives ?  
---
whats being released?
---
&gt; Koreans and Russians on the other hand play pretty hard and thus face better survivors on average
---
I live in EU. You CANNOT be serious.
---
Man Ghostface took stealth to a whole new level
---
&gt; If I recall we used to have a weirdo with a chainsaw and a humming bunny but those were the old days
---
Ah yes they became spectators.
---
What I like about doc is his constant presense. You can constantly exert some form of pressure even if you're not there thanks to madness. Its not the cleanest perk but for those working with not the best reflexes skill checks can get hurt, and it hurts worse if he's using the red chess piece.
---
According to leaks, the 9th/10th.
---
i dont know, this guy made a post that asks if there is a discord server on a DBD subreddit. i think he/she is asking for a roblox discord server though.
---
Lambs to the slaughter.
---
Not only is this an awesome idea that adds suspense, but it also would make sense that you can focus on the gen or pay attention to the killer, not really both
---
It is a thing coming to DBD that explorers the backstories of the killers and survivors and fleshes out the world a bit more. They also have missions you can complete to gain these back stories and there may be cosmetics.? They have not said a lot of information on it but i am pretty excited
---
I think the last perk is kinda op when combined head on and ds. It would be cool if downed survivors could enter a locker and then this perk activates after x secondsm. No limit as to how many times you do it. Would be good against killers that slug and camp downed survivors.
---
Yes but I feel that survivors tend to have more items than not and it's ment to be a trade off of them having an Item or a status effect
---
He could have easily just stayed in the doorway once you ran back inside.
---
Oh, alright
---
I prefer save the best for last on Bubba personally to each their own. Granted I'm only about a rank 10 killer because I don't play often.
---
Hag main here.
---
If people are stupid enough to set off your traps around hooks even AFTER seeing you place them, I don‚Äôt think they should be crying about ‚Äúcamping‚Äù when they make it easier for you to get back to the hook in a timely fashion. Not to mention they literally swarmed the basement right after the first hook. 
---
Don‚Äôt listen to survivors like that. You weren‚Äôt being toxic nor doing anything wrong.
---
Yeah but it would be another fix for Gen Rushing
---
on survivor i bounce between 8 and 12, just depending on how much i play that month. i have only ever gotten down to rank 7, i don't care about rank too much! :)
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 50/50 on optimization and the fact that you can‚Äôt adapt to it, or you‚Äôre a little overkill on how bad it actually performs. The framerate dips low in certain areas yes. However, it‚Äôs definitely possible to hit them.
---
Im pretty sure it has been leaked on r/leakedbydaylight that it is coming out on October 16th
---
Don't they expand their search parameters if they can't find a match within a certain time frame?
---
It's not a "Myth" at all.
---
There are 17 killers, most are not a good experience in red ranks.
---
Sure you can get away with plague and hag if you are a very good player but good luck playing clown, pig, ghostface, wraith ect.
---
This is incredible, please make this a series of covers
---
It‚Äòs not the exact same clothing, but it‚Äòs a whole body clothing in pink and yellow
---
Freddy is tier S, sadly my beloved huntress has more problems every patch (New maps are horrible with her) now days she is below A tier A i think :(
---
yeah but they can just...drop the item. if you want to actually have some sort of viability with this killer then you have to bring super glue add on to every game. im pretty sure survivors are smart enough to give up items for a killer that doesnt have any sort of ability that helps him in a chase
---
Me and the boys in creative mode
---
I‚Äòts not the exact same clothing, but yellow and pink exists
---
Cool, that'd be nice
---
oh fuck
---
Since when does gen rushing need a fix? Survivors do gens and killers pressure survivors off gens and kill them. Are survivors just supposed to hang out and have tea in the middle of the match?
---
‚ÄúYou want to keep complaining go ahead, but at this rate, you might as well not play the game‚Äù mhmm, sure.
---
Angry much? Says the guy with bad manners and incredibly stupid arguments that simply make no sense at all.
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to be a punching bag for bullies but we are talking about a stupid asymmetrical game, get over the fact some people are douchebags.
---
If you adept your very same logic in real life especially in your workplace then good fuckin‚Äô luck keeping a job longer than a few weeks.
---
Devs have seen it.
---
big brain time
---
I've gotten a lot of survivor suggestions, so some killer ones would be nice :)
---
It's actually implied in the novel that the Deadlights has consumed entire worlds before which is why Pennywise self proclaims himself as the "Eater of Worlds" however in the case of Earth it's stated somewhere that the Losers Club has a deep connection with Maturin and he sort of grants his "protection" in a way, I don't remember how the whole explanation pans out but lets be honest without Maturin's intervention Pennywise would have eventually consumed Earth in the following centuries, his hunger gets more and more immense each time he awakes.
---
&gt;I thought I had read that the chest only gives notification if they don't finish searching it all the way. Like they start to open it but then stop before it's done.
---
"closing" a chest implies that you didn't finish searching it, otherwise it would stay open.
---
We just have a good sense of smell
---
If you do this, eat a bag of sausages.  
---
Sincerely  
---
Everyone who's trying to enjoy the game regardless of killer/perks/addons.
---
Per the [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1180682221453271041), the dedicated server experiment on PC ended a day or two ago and we're back to "normal".
---
Commissions?
---
Take silver, as I don't have enough for gold. Hope to see more from you. My SO and I both love this. For some reason, yelling "DWIGHT FAIRFIELD" has just become a thing in our household, so waking up to this probably annoyed our neighbors.  Me gusta
---
Clown his teachables are really really good except for Colorophobia
---
Leaks indicate 9 or 10 th of october for the start of event
---
Wtf? Is there a source I can read more about this? Sounds like DBD story mode, which sounds fuckin epic
---
You can‚Äôt balance the game based on swf, otherwise nothing will ever change. This is a very strong step in the right direction. Swf needs to be addressed as a separate issue
---
Well bugger that.
---
also thanks.
---
Mikey has a shredded body?
---
I just think that they get done too quickly, and I came up with the name before the effect and I thought that's the only thing that would fit in contex of this Mr. Rogers type killer
---
They havent released a lot of information about it, but r/leakedbydaylight has some data mines about it as well as the stuff that the DBD team has said on their interviews. It is also on the road map and The King just released a new video where they talk about it for a few minutes.
---
What if he can shapeshift into one of the survivors in game? Not just almost the same, but completely identical. Anything less would make it useless at high ranks where people would have learned to tell the difference. 
---
For example doctor illusions at high ranks are just filtered out instantly by the survivors at this point.
---
If this was his only power, it would fuck with survivors at all ranks, but would still be counterable simply by having good game sense.
---
Thats so cool !!
---
Wow that's some sick art ! Love it !
---
This literally gives you more to do on a gen.... old gens you‚Äôre always looking around. This gen, you‚Äôre deciding if you should get the bonus or have the awareness. 
---
In case you‚Äôre still confused, 1 decision is more than 0.
---
&gt;Everything killers have in their disposal is perfectly balanced and fair, but survivors? they need to get gutted.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Thanks for proving how biased killer mains are lmao
---
To be honest you're the one that seems to be the most biased.  
---
A survivor main irrationally attacked me. I called him out and you instantly responded with the whole:
---
&gt;but when a survivor calls out a killer addon or perk for being bs all hell breaks loose lol
---
to defend someone getting called out by a killer.  
---
Now someone argues against killer addons being to strong and you're drawing the "survivor-victim-card" again.
---
 Thanks for proving how biased killer mains are lmao 
---
You shouldn't generalize like that. Especially with the survivor-bias on this subreddit duo to more players playing survivor instead of killer.
---
Both sides got crybabies. I would argue, that survivors got more of them. But that's nothing unusual if there are just more survivor players arround.
---
&gt; Everything killers have in their disposal is perfectly balanced and fair, but survivors? they need to get gutted. 
---
This game has been survivor sided since release when it comes to balance.  
---
This is just a fact, dude.  
---
That doesn't justify killers crying and complaining.  
---
But there are legit moments where killers point at badly balanced things like: Totem spawns, Gen speed, Killer balance issues, SWF and more - and people like you will respond like you just did.  
---
It's okay to point out that survivors are too strong. That won't make your wins less valuable :)
---
Yep okay.
---
Or the fact they didn‚Äôt quickly scan the whole map for the aura of the next survivor
---
Sell these as prints and I'd buy them all.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm so glad you enjoy it!
---
-2.... what the fuck lmao
---
And we will continue to see it posted until the devs capitalize on it! It's fantastic.
---
I mean it's true, if the game makes you this unhappy to non stop complain about a character that clearly isn't broken or op then maybe you shouldn't play it anymore. Doesn't sound like you're having much fun. And I'd like to point out that I didn't call you any names or was assholeish there, it was simply a helpful suggestion. It's your choice to get offended by helpful suggestions. But again, you're the one who started the name calling game. Seriously, go calm down instead of wasting energy on a random guy on the Internet
---
I do do commissions! Shoot me over a dm on here or Instagram @aviaryart.ncl ‚úåÔ∏è

*Parents when the argument isn‚Äôt going the way they want it to* FTFY
---
It takes about 2k hours to get all P3 and possibly could tale less if you do double bp events correctly and only focus on getting P3s. Personally i feel its not worth it but if you want to try for it, go for it
---
They start the tenth im like 99% sure
---
These killers are copyrighted. Just be careful before you profit off of comics using copyrighted characters. It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
---
Well I can tell you it's absolutely on both sides, survivors aren't the only toxic players lol.
---
the archives/ battle pass isn‚Äôt apart of the event- but may be releasing near the time. The event last year  was about harvesting some plants, and then trying to escape with the nectar vial as a survivor. As a killer, I think you had to hook people to get the vial. However this year, it has been leaked that survivors will have to repair cankerous gens to get the nectar. You then can buy the cosmetics with the vials of nectar. Also, there are special items (last year flashlights and medkits) which look cool.
---
Dude this is sick would love to see plague or Freddy next!
---
I never was angry to begin with. Annoyed maybe, but never angry. Go through my comments and you‚Äôll see I never insulted the killer or sought out justice. I called him an asshole because what he did was on a douchebag kinda level. The whole point of this post was to outline the fact that karma will fuck you bad if you don‚Äôt get your shit together. This applies to life in general. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand your argument regarding my workplace. Where the hell do you work that you let yourself get pushed around in the first place? Fast food? Retail? 
---
If someone is a dick to me at work, I will tell them to mellow out. Which hasn‚Äôt happened so far as my work environment is non-hostile and quite professional. So thank you for wishing me luck, but I don‚Äôt think I need it. Please refer from trying to make baseless assumptions and getting all personal. You have issues, not me. Like you said, it is a video game. You‚Äôre taking it out of context now. He tbagged me, slugged me, tunneled me, and was an asshole, we tbagged him back. End of story. 
---
I‚Äôm terribly sorry that the concept of standing up to yourself is alien to you.
---
Yup it is very much illegal to make profit from fan art. I‚Äôm sure the DbD team put a lot more effort into creating this amazing game and great characters than I did in making this over a couple of days!
---
Well some YouTubers have shown us that it is indeed possible. No one expects you to play like them of course, but i like watching them as it reminds me that bad killers arent completely hopeless after all
---
Im 9 and they are 8,11,8,5
---
Trapper is more buff than mike
---
It makes me bored to death if I face a Freddy with ruin, DL, rope and PGTW.
---
Gotcha. I like the overall idea, I think it‚Äôs funny too
---
It's mainly people shit talking after games. Though there's also survivors sandbagging other survivors (purposely trying to get them killed) and killers playing like scum fucks or even targeting the same person in different matches because they're salty and can't let go of a grudge
---
T3 doesn't increase his speed over T2, just his lunge distance and terror radius.
---
Sadly it‚Äôs illegal to sell fan art without permission from the company I‚Äôm afraid.
---
He could have just waited until the timer was gone.
---
The point of the match is to do gens. If you dont want to do at least one of them, then that's on you. You should be a team player by helping out and doing any least something. Even if you touch one for 5 seconds you get a silver emblem.
---
Seems like you just dont want to do gens, which again is your own fault.
---
No, I disagree.
---
The developers of this game need to understand that solo survivors aren‚Äôt strong or broken enough on their own to warrant gen speed being increased.
---
SWF however is busted and a team of 4 even mediocre survivors will generally body a good killer.
---
I‚Äôd take playing with no perks with 4 SWF over playing solo with perks every single time and that‚Äôs the major issue.
---
If you make this change then all you have to do is communicate to your SWF friends that you are being chased and they will all look at the gen and this change will be for nothing.
---
Meanwhile over on the solo survivors side he has no information, so he‚Äôs forced to look around and thus hurting his/her chances of survival even if you are playing well.
---
Im all for balance and I agree survivors tend to be a bit stronger in purple/red ranks, but this is not the way.
---
While I see that as an issue of him getting looped I want killers with flaws, My idea for The Neighbor is a killer that can slow the game down . The power will give survivors reason to not hold onto flash lights, and tool boxes. So he will get looped but perks like brutial strengh, Enduring, and Sprit Fury make them better. I think its a little less of an issue. And again I don't want him to be top teir I just want him to be intesting, and fun for both sides.
---
Every new and exciting character " concept " people on this sub add another ds - get the fuck out with that broken shit
---
why are you going into matches as a wraith expecting to win against a squad that stacks 2+ instaheals? Its like expecting to all 4 escape through the gates against a nurse with 5k hours and an ebony mori. I dont care about matches where people use shit like that because they‚Äôre broken on purpose.
---
The problem with both of these add ons (insta heals, prayer beads, omegablink etc) is that you can use them against a survivor team/killer that isnt using their sides equivalent. These add ons are inherently flawed because you dont know what you‚Äôre going to face. They are purposefully designed to be unfair and to make the other side frustrated. Its such terrible design in a game that BHVR at least pretends to think is ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù. 
---
People play prayer beads spirit/stack multiple instaheals to stomp on people who did nothing to them because they‚Äôre under the illusion that the other side is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and is out to get them.
---
Literally just got called a camper by someone who did this lol.
---
I like the idea. I think the only issue is that this further widens the gap between SWF and soloq.
---
Every fucking time. xD
---
No one stops you to not look around now? 1 decision equals 1 decision, in case you're confused.
---
True but their is more then 2 killers viable and sorry if I came off a bit hostile.
---
Aight, nah it's been glitched since May sadly, the known way to do it is to do 100 heals in a single match.
---
I hate it when that happens. I'm not good on pressure and would do just fine with everyone being quiet, letting me do my thing
---
I live in EU.
---
The Korean and Russian regions bring forth the best players in this game, completely serious. Not that there aren't great players from other parts of the world, of course.
---
I mean, I cant imagine anything will happen. Think about all the people who sell fan art on etsy or who blaintintly steal it for redbubble.
---
Do you have a link to that game? I also don't often see him getting butthurt unless it's SWF, which is understandable. There need to be more penalties for players who SWF to even it out, like slower repair speed.
---
I personally don‚Äôt have issues with swf when I play killer, so I don‚Äôt sympathize. I do get what you‚Äôre saying though, this does inadvertently buff swf. It seems almost impossible to please both sides of this though, and I feel like compared to everything else, this is the best option.
---
play at nighttime.  As a rank 7 killer I find lobbies quicker than I find lobbies as survivor
---
Well, what would you suggest be his last perk?
---
Why do you everyone wants shirtless Myers
---
Since so many people post let‚Äôs plays or their twitch channels why don‚Äôt we have a weekly thread where people can advertise their channels?
---
His power would probably focus on fear vs courage. Basically survivors that don't juke hits/secure pallet stuns/save allies or themselves would be theoretically weaker aganst him.
---
So I'd recommend not taking up the offer for a **paid** comic book of the hillbilly.
---
One time I did this except instead of missing a check I accidentally threw a party cracker... I had a hard time convincing the others that I wasn't a sandbagger after that.
---
Puppers sometimes streams from ps4
---
None the less I have respect for the creators of this game we love and they deserve the credit for it in my opinion.
---
you had one sentence to spellcheck man, come on
---
What do u meen
---
This.
---
DCers don't like the occasional challenge. That or they get overwhelmed by salt. They ruin it for everyone else who is willing to try and defy the odds.
---
The hard limit is 6 ranks above/below your current rank. So in a way Rank 1 will not have this scenario. But they may be matched with rank 13 survivor.
---
Happy to help, works for loads of games when they are playing up.
---
Ah ok thanks:)
---
The old system was biased, and it sounds like you were probably in one of the "better" "areas" - which meant your lobby was always being bumped to the top over people who had spent more time waiting.
---
The new system queues you first (one queue for killer, one for survivor), and then starts creating lobbies. This means that everyone in the queue has a "fair" wait time (in that everyone waits equally), rather than some constantly having short waits and others have absurdly long waits.
---
Bear in mind that you need four survivors for every killer, so if you only ever play killer you're probably going to notice the impact more than you would when playing survivor.
---
Could be smurf accounts. It‚Äôs pretty easy to link a new account to an existing ‚Äúparent‚Äù account on PS4 and you get to use all the DLC you‚Äôve paid for on your main account.
---
Dude that‚Äôs so sick how long did it take to make
---
Bro this sub is like all killer mains, it‚Äôs the other way around
---
Ok nope you‚Äôre clearly confused. With the current system, why wouldn‚Äôt you look around? If you‚Äôre staring at the gem now, you‚Äôre either new or distracted. With this new system, experienced survs would have the decision of looking at the gen for faster speed, or looking around for awareness. 
---
So again, 1 decision vs 0 decisions :)
---
Cannibal is a little high for my liking
---
Idk man, i honestly talked only with people who complained about noed
---
What I mean is you can still buy the "spook skins" and sure they look good (though not just like legacy) but they're not exclusive cosmetics like legacy is
---
I use it as fuel to be more unrelenting as killer lol
---
This is gas heaven right? Isn‚Äòt that the spot right next to the car in front of the main building?
---
*revving chainsaw* oh for fucks sake *pressing escape key on keyboard and dragging mouse to leave match*
---
its shredded not buff im sure micheal have a 6 pack
---
I didn‚Äôt say I would do the comic outright, I encouraged the person asking to message me personally so I could explain why I can‚Äôt do comics of these licensed characters, but I might be able to make something else they might enjoy :)
---
Karma doesn‚Äôt exist and you just posted this because you want Reddit karma.
---
Also calling a person an asshole solely for teabagging you is bullshit in itself.
---
&gt;Where the hell do you work that you let yourself get pushed around in the first place? 
---
You don‚Äôt let yourself get pushed around, you simply don‚Äôt participate in people‚Äôs nonsense and move on.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have been where I am now in my field if I always opened my mouth and ‚Äúgave people a taste of their medicine‚Äù as you called it.
---
This goes for coworkers as well as your bosses.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm terribly sorry that the concept of standing up to yourself is alien to you.
---
You did the very same thing that made you call someone an asshole yet you‚Äôre trying to tell me you‚Äôre standing up to yourself all this time? 
---
No you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre just an even bigger fuckin‚Äô asshole than the person you claim one to be, period.
---
Don‚Äôt reply to this it‚Äôs over my verdict on you is irreversible.
---
Dude of you could like talk to BHVR about actually doin such comics, that would be absolutely awesome. You might combine it with the archives since they bring in some lore as well, once they come out. Id certainly buy those comics if I could.
---
Yeah but does that explain the three rank 19 with mostly high-end perks? Do alt accounts get to use all the unlockables from other PS account?
---
Awww
---
Definetly, depending on what you're capable of abusing to a better extend, they're actually more even than some would anticipate.
---
To be honest I never thought about it, but yeah, Freddy is currently probably the 3rd/4th best Killer, somewhat tied with Billy.
---
I'm actually grateful for the Freddy rework, it shows that Killer designs can be used in the current meta that don't necessarily need to revolve around roaming and chase-capabillity. Even when stalling with Doctor works also pretty well as a alternative. But since Doctor's in-chase capabillities ain't a good as Freddies, whilst also not forcing Survivor into subobjectives, Freddy is definetly better in terms of a stalling Killer since his rework.
---
Ah, thank you I misunderstood.
---
That sounds really dope ngl, i have found so many awesome small streamers through this sub reddit as well as running into them in rank one games. I would be completely cool with a thread like that.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 4 billy and this is still me
---
I would absolutely love to work with BHVR on something like that. Honestly would be a dream come true haha and it would be awesome to know they like it!
---
DC'ers are annoyed by the fact that it's gonna take more effort than running around a pallet for 3mins. Same goes with Spirit. If the killer can down them quick and their DS/DH won't counter any of that, that's a DC right there. 
---
Also, one of the reason to have alert and spine chill. Im out before im seen.  
---
As soon as i see spirit/nurse/Huntress, i prepare mentally for atleast 1 DC.  
---
DC'ers whether it's killer or a survivor should get banned for 1hr by default, and lose a full rank, not just depip once.
---
I am rank 8 billy main and i always get matched up against red ranks in my lobby. Seems there arent enough red rank killers for all the sweaty red rank survivors. Rank 8 killers like me constantly get matched with people far above our level to compensate for all the red rank killers that stop playing the game because of toxic high rank survs. I want to fight back towards red ranks but nurse has such a tough learning curve. Any tips on progressing with nurse without getting my ass kicked the first 50 games?
---
If we were going by buff, huntress would win out
---
For some reason I‚Äôve always loved Legion and would marry you for one of these
---
Maybe about 5 hours total? Something like that. It‚Äôs only the second piece I‚Äôve done in the vintage comic style so still learning how to streamline the process a bit haha
---
Nah fam Wraith can hit you while invisible now BHVR said so
---
Um, he even arrives at her fortified house which seemed to be far from Haddonfield near the climax of the movie.
---
Was the other one the jack Torrence/ shining one cause that one looked awesome as well
---
Oh snap a bp! Time for me to complain endlessly but still buy it anyways
---
Gg Francis
---
That‚Äôs seems about right
---
Hope is already good enough.  Isn‚Äôt this just like adrenaline
---
I think so too. It would cut back on people trying to spam their channels, and it would make finding new content creators way easier.
---
It's not a proper question, more an advice request. Is ruin worth for killers at rank 6? I haven't pop, overcharge is useless. Surveillance is one of my favourite, but him alone can't do a lot. But everytime i use ruin it gets destroyed after 30 seconds, any advice?
---
Tbh I was fully expecting a DC after the knock
---
Some of us from remote areas had the best experience with the game so far due to dedicated servers, i know the issues are concerning for the people who had no problem with ping or queues due to saturatiom of players but some of us play 1 match per hour at best 2,please please let the dedicated servers come sooner as the bad experience on matches i could get was like 1 in 10 or so games, but i was getting matches in less than 5 mins most times 1 min which i know most are used to but it felt good for once.
---
Even though i dont have the switch version, im so happy that it is running well because it means that they finally did a good job with the dedicated servers and i am so happy having watched DBD grow over the years! It is honestly awesome lol
---
Rank 19 with lithe and self care wtf? Lol
---
October 9th start
---
&gt;why are you going into matches as a wraith expecting to win against a squad that stacks 2+ instaheals?
---
I used to be that guy that would rank himself down to green/purp ranks so he could just enjoy meme builds on weaker killers.  
---
Third Seal. Knockout. Blood Warden. Stuff like that on Old Freddy. Wraith. Doc.  
---
But ranking yourself down takes too much time and it even got me suspended once.  
---
So I stopped doing it.  
---
Now I am rank 1 and forced to play against other rank 1's. (Aslong as the broken matchmaking system doesn't fuck my enemys up).  
---
And I almost allways get games like these (against SWFs / players that play optimally).  
---
Only playing Spirit/Nurse isn't fun for me.  
---
And that's why I play this game. For fun.  
---
So I mix things up.  
---
But mixing things up and don't following the meta-train most likely will end up with me being stressed out because I have to min-max every decision as killer, or else I'll lose.  
---
Don't get me wrong. I consider myself to be a good killer.  
---
If I see premades, I'll still be able to win with a bad killer.  
---
If they equip med kits, I don't know if they've got the insta-heal addons, because like you said:  
---
&gt; The problem with both of these add ons (insta heals, prayer beads, omegablink etc) is that you can use them against a survivor team/killer that isnt using their sides equivalent. These add ons are inherently flawed because you dont know what you‚Äôre going to face. They are purposefully designed to be unfair and to make the other side frustrated. Its such terrible design in a game that BHVR at least pretends to think is ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù. 
---
and this is why I often switch to spirit. Or even 'prayer beads' Spirit.  
---
I'll see 4 random players. 2 of them got medkits. I play something random. While playing 1-2 survivors start to t-bag, 2 medkits turn out to have 1 instaheal addon each, and at the end of the game I'll get the confirmation that I just faced against premates.  
---
Then I'll have couple of games like this in a row until I say: Fuck it - and switch to spirit.  
---
As spirit I'll still have to try to win, but picking good decisions feels way more rewarding, because you can actually outplay/mindgame people on a regular basis.  
---
Meanwhile you'll have games as Wraith or Doc where you end up losing and you end up with a: "I couldn't have played that better and I still lost" frustrated feeling.
---
&gt; People play prayer beads spirit/stack multiple instaheals to stomp on people who did nothing to them because they‚Äôre under the illusion that the other side is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and is out to get them. 
---
Yes. I'd sign that.  
---
Because this is what usually happens to me.  
---
I'll have 4 toxic SWF squads in a row that are just out to get me.   
---
And I am that nice guy that usually gifts the hatch to people.  
---
But then in the fifth game I'll say: Fuck it - equip a mori or some iridescent addons as soon as I see SWF lobby number 5.  
---
Then I'll play this game and encounter a super friendly SWF group. 2 redranks playing with their 2 yellow buddies who got like 50 hrs into this game.  
---
And then, suddenly, I'll feel very bad for them.
---
Well he still could be alive because in several other books from king, we get little Easter eggs that mention and or directly reference Peenywise.
---
Get a group of friends to run mock games with you and DONT RUN ANY ADDONS, make sure to blink constantly if you aren't going to hit dont try to swing. Nurses lunge is super long but is only long in one direction if you turn during the lunge it's like a regular M1
---
And people say this community is toxic! Im really loving this game, obsessively so and it sucks because i have so many games on my backlog but i just keep playing this lol. 
---
I hope the community keeps growing and we keep getting matchesüëç
---
Yea that would be sick if they did that to help promote some of the games players and give back more to the community you know? It would just be really nice and a welcome addition in my book!
---
dude... you shall run an horror bussiness
---
This is amazing
---
Especially when it‚Äôs a feng min
---
I enjoy the Gabe running perks to help the others. So I always have kindred and we'll make it. I then throw on an urban evasion and to give myself the chance at the end an adrenaline. 
---
Now you have no healing for yourself and you need others to help you. So your gonna need all your skills and ability to find people and dodge the killer, and if youb make it to end game you get a little boost.
---
To be honest I have other meta perks abs I don't want them, this is a fun way to play.
---
That was simply due to dedicated servers. People who live in over saturated players don't have a problem with this but i hope they bring them back for the sake of the smaller minority
---
OmG I cAn StArE aT ThE gEn or choose to spend even more time pressing m1. How interactive. Its literally taking away from more experienced survivors just because killers can't do enough gen pressure.
---
Fridays he does part of the day PS4 where he plays with subs.
---
Baby dweet wearing a Halloween store Micheal Myers costume running around hiding in lockers sounds amazing
---
How the fuck do people find devour hope the second the fucking match starts
---
its just the mediocre killers on this subreddit who like to delude themselves into thinking they‚Äôre better than they actually are thanks to streamers like tru3 or tydetyme. They are perpetual victims, constantly try to reinforce the us vs them sentiment etc. 
---
‚Äúdude survivor rulebook amirite, I hate when survivors tell me what to do, thats why they shouldnt play with their friends or play blendette or use perks I dont like‚Äù. ‚ÄúI hate instaheal SWF squads!!! Thats why next match Im gonna use prayer bead spirit to show those toxic swfs whats up! Oh whats that? Those were solo survivors? Yeah right, they did a generator....toxic entitled genrushers‚Äù. 
---
they also feel entitled to a 4k no matter what they are using and no matter what the survivors are using and also love mentioning how if you slug all 4 survivors in the first 2 minutes of the game with iri head huntress and ‚Äú4k‚Äù with a total of 4 hooks you dont double pip.
---
That's hawt!
---
its gonna be tomorrow.. just when I have holydays and I cant play... shit.
---
Ruin, like all hexes, is pure luck. Sometimes it'll stand all game and slow gens to a crawl, sometimes it'll be broken because a survivor spawned right next to it. If you want to use it, just pray.
---
I agree! Sure there are quite a few bad apples, but the amount of dope people i have met through this game is awesome! Even though no matter what your stance on Killer or Survivor is, it is a very good and well made game imo with a dev team that genuinely cares. After the ST update, watching all the new players and spike in growth of the game was awesome and i am so glad to be a part if it!
---
Uggggfh this is gooorgeous. PLEASE continue and do one for all killers; seeing ones for Plague, Spirit and Amanda would be so exciting
---
Try with "not another obvious ds copy but with a condition that makes you feel like you are Smart for inventing something "new" " kind of perk
---
The Cooler Clown
---
That's fair.  Maybe donate all the earnings to charity?  Anything for me to slam my credit card into my computer and have all these on my wall.
---
Yeah that was my first go! There‚Äôs a time lapse of my process on my Instagram @aviaryart.ncl
---
Again you‚Äôre still missing the point lmao. You complained how boring this is, and not only did you offer no fix, but you‚Äôre just flat out wrong. All this does is give you more to do while on a gen, it doesn‚Äôt matter how interactive you think it is. This is just flat out more to do?
---
I love demo's smile
---
I think the bulk of streamers that agree with Demo being mid-mid high would beg to differ. He has map travel with his portals (that only take 1 second to place mind you), lunge mindgames that can make survivors get greedy at loops, and he‚Äôs also got no terror radius for a few seconds after teleporting, which, if a portal is hidden near a gen, can guarantee a free hit or a possible grab.
---
Calling him low tier and only ‚Äúslightly better than wraith and clown‚Äù is laughable, literally. Wraith and Clown have ZERO map pressure and no way of traversing the map fast enough to stop gens.
---
Hahah I‚Äôll maybe see about getting in contact with BHVR.
---
Only one thing to say : more.
---
I honestly love that each survivor has their own stereotype. 
---
I just played a match where a Meg sprinted from as far as I could see her to the gen I was working on. She immediately failed a skill check and bailed. I just laughed because it was the most Meg thing ever.
---
I don't want shirtless myers anymore.
---
Great job though!
---
Quiet before they patch it
---
I think Claudette and Wraith are paired up.
---
- They‚Äôre both original characters from the base game.
---
- They can both disappear and go invisible.
---
Good luck raising your children then. I hope they won‚Äôt ever get bullied in school as your advice to them would aggravate their frustration. And karma does exist. The fact you believe otherwise, the fact you‚Äôre justifying it, only goes to show. 
---
And no, I didn‚Äôt post this because I‚Äôm a karma whore. This is a community and I wanted to share with it. I‚Äôm allowed to do so. If it gains attention, good. If not, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm subscribed to this community and I can, just like anyone else, post and share. You‚Äôre not going to dictate what I can‚Äôt and can‚Äôt post. You‚Äôre the asshole for accusing me and for making baseless assumptions, for insulting me and for trying to start shit with me. Look in the mirror before you play Jesus next time. 
---
And if you work in an environment where you constantly have to keep your mouth shut or you‚Äôll get shit, then maybe it‚Äôs not a good work environment. But I‚Äôm not going to compare jobs. I‚Äôm sure you have a good job, but so do I. Only I get to voice critique and dissatisfaction without any repercussions or being afraid of getting fired. You keep bottling it all up. Might explain why you decided to come to this post and attack me. I‚Äôm not your punching bag just because you‚Äôre unhappy with your own life and possibly your own job. If I‚Äôm an asshole, then you‚Äôre an even bigger asshole. You could‚Äôve simply ignored it, but instead you came at me. The hypocrisy is amazing. Get out of my face with this nonsense. 
---
And again: I called him an asshole for slugging me and tbagging me and tunneling for NO REASON. I tbagged him because he gave me A REASON. Action, reaction. Are you that dense? Apples and oranges, my guy, apples and oranges.
---
IMO bubba is the worst killer in the game he is LITERALLY the definition of m1 killer as his power is useless unless survivors are in the open
---
It's not about slugging the whole team.
---
After the recent buff to recovery speed, you are actually able to pick yourself up before the killer downs the guy he started chasing when he slugged you. You can completely reset a chase, and if you are in a good position to continue it you can get a ton of value since you essentially gained a health state.
---
It is good at countering slugging, since you will often slug to put more pressure on the survivors that are still up since they have to drop what they are doing and come pick you up. It's simmilar to deliverance where you undo the pressure by yourself instead of requiring a teammate to help you.
---
Sorry I don't have a link as I was watching it live. I tend to agree on the repair speed thing. Or give killers a percentage BP boost post-game if there were swf players.
---
How exactly did you do the mask? It looks great.
---
It's  a pretty fun game, the parkour mechanics and emphasis on melee combat keeps it fresh and makes it more fun.
---
Keep us updated my dude.  It's great looking.
---
I asked that question a while ago. There's really no answer. You'll just have to learn from PC players. There may be ps4 streamers, but they're mainly unknown/unpopular.
---
Sometimes you just have a bad night lol
---
Take my upvote for that last one
---
Spirit's body has been shredded..
---
How do you learn to "loop"? I am a new player and just can't get to exploit those so called "strong pallets" or loop ocassions, when being chased I just run through the map trying to do what I think will help me escape better, but never get to actually loop a killer many times on the same place.
---
im not talking about the game dude lol
---
Thank you luckily the crusade is over.
---
ps4 streamers? lol
---
game almost dead on consoles
---
It's cause they're bad at the game
---
I had to repost it because it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt relate to the dbd community‚Äù
---
So I slapped the name on the top and reposted it 
---
This felt really stupid to have to do this but oh well
---
Hope is already op it makes looping take soo long at endgame
---
I thought i was the only one getting this shit. Yesterday i was using spirit with usual meta perks and purple addons and i got destroyed by some purple ranks, probably the best survs i ever faced. Today i tried after a long time myers, without ruin or bbq, with common addons, and i 4k'd 4 red ranks. I am rank 9. Idk what is happening lmao
---
&gt;Freddy is a sleeper pick.
---
Intentional?
---
My rule as killer. 
---
If the last two survivors have clearly no hope of escape. I will approach the first one I find and give them an opportunity to prove if their loyalty to their teammate outweighs their survival instinct. If their loyalty prevails I will show them respect and give them a fair shot at survival. 
---
If they sell out their teammate, the rat goes on the hook and the sold out teammate gets an express trip to the hatch.
---
Yeah as someone who just started playing not too long ago watching all of his videos helps when he‚Äôs good and knows how to make it funny.
---
How am I wrong? What part of ''that would be more boring for survivor'' is wrong? Its only more fun for the killers at the expense of survivor fun. You are overestimating how much fun it is to make a decision rather than realize how boring those decisions are.
---
&gt;Imposible
---
PS4 is far from dead
---
You can prestige everyone and still be a bot
---
It's still a proper question.
---
Ruin is definitely worth it, because it buys the killer *time*, and playing killer is all about time management. Perks that buy time are always going to be worth it, so long as you know how to *use* that time.
---
The 30 seconds they spend looking for Ruin is 30 seconds you have to get momentum. Trap killers get time to set up traps, stalk killers get time to build stalk, mobile killers should already be in their first chase.
---
If you're consistently losing Ruin at game start then make it your business to get to the totem first - if you're a mobile killer then you'll likely reach it before they do and therefore get into a chase when they arrive, if you're a trap killer then you can trap the totem and the approaches to it, and if you're a stalk killer then you can lurk near the totem and potentially get yourself an easy grab or down in addition to building stalk.
---
Who are you normally playing as, and what are you doing for those 30 seconds?
---
Definitely do more. Hit us with a plague PLEASE!
---
At red ranks, im still being left on hooks without any camping. Yesterday I stayed in a game that i was face camped and tunneled the entire game. All my team did was unhook me. Ok fine. But i got to a safe pallet and they were all there and hugged the pallet afraid of the killer and let me die. 
---
This is why I play swf only now. 
---
There is no team players left at red ranks. I used to be incredibly altruistic but its not worth it anymore. I get left or used every game.
---
I‚Äôve actually had opposite experiences. You know my troubles with bubba. My main problem was that I kept getting one away from merciless. While I haven‚Äôt done pig yet oh god. I have done ghostface and I did it in one try. Granted I landed into leri‚Äôs but it was still fairly easy.
---
If you're the killer, then it may mean that someone had trouble connecting to you. Check your NAT settings in your network options and try setting it to open if it isn't already.
---
It‚Äôs funny when you get more BP than the survivor that survives via the hatch because you actually saved people, did gens, and cleansed totems rather than hide and try and survive.
---
I main the clown and the hillbilly
---
I had to take breaks to play demodog
---
Definitely do this!!!
---
Love it dude, trapper needs too look a bit more dirty in my opinion but I could live with this.
---
I agree with you man. I main killer (but I'll play survivor with friends) and honestly the sort of thing sucks the fun out of a match. Like I'm not saying their OP or not allowed or anything but it really just makes the game a slog for the survivors. I personally refuse to use it as a killer
---
Alright I‚Äôm very done trying to explain myself to you. Whatever man you win, this idea sucks.
---
Between console versions i think would be fine but i feel it would be best avoided with PC.
---
You either learn by bitter experience or you beat the curve and watch some YouTube videos.
---
The stickied Megathread has a lot of guides, and I'm also a fan of OhTofu's [series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop) on maps, structures, and pallets.
---
The devs are gonna wake up in some abandonned warehouse's bathroom one of these days.
---
No, any respectable spirit will run Stridor.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is god tier on Legion. They have the mobility to make use of it.
---
Other than that honestly just a basic bitch chase build. Brutal Strength, Ruin, and BBQ. People tend to prethrow pallets a lot against Legion I find and I don't really know why. Generally speaking you always want to use your power to get the first stab and then chase them with your power. Duration and recharge time are some of Legion's best addons for that reason, though cool-down is also really good too.
---
*Claps in Prove Thyself*
---
It's not an opinion, it's a fact, devs did not need a lot of time to realize that Demogorgon deserves the ability to shred pallets just like the chainsaw killers do. Billy used to not be able to chainsaw pallets down and he was nowhere near being the third best killer in the game because of that. I don't need any 'ignorant internet culture' to tell you that it makes sense for a 9ft tall otherworldly creature with incredible strength and speed to be able to break down a pallet with its massive lunge, if that kind of description fits your fancy.
---
&gt; */r/deadbydaylight is not a direct line to BHVR*
---
Sorry. Your best bet is to contact them through "official" channels, such as Twitter.
---
Sounds perfect!  
---
See you then boo (ah, I scared myself with that boo üëª)
---
You seem to be part of the problem.  
---
But you seem to side with the survivors.
---
&gt;it's very rare they investigate tickets otherwise.
---
100% true. I know a guy rage hacking for weeks and no ban. He bank on people not knowing this.
---
I cant watch it
---
15 cents?! I'll take 10
---
I thiiiiink this one is perfect.
---
Kinda reminds me of zombies ate me neighbors.
---
I used to play with trapper, but i had to left him. Now i usually play with spirit or myers, but trying to depend less on the infamous spirit. In those 30 seconds i try to reach ruin or the gen the survs spawned, i easily find the first one, and puff, ruin broken. If i protect ruin i usually lose them, and then the hell begins. I'm not even complaining, i'm not a pro or even near, but i feel like totems should be more consistent, given the fact than once they're destroyed they are useless, and you could have another perk instead of them. I guess i should buy pop, or pray it appears on the next market
---
Hope it fixes the buggy servers. Literally every survivor game it‚Äôs super laggy or it just kicks me. Killer perfect though.
---
I always thought the #1 bad thing to do against it was to run in a straight line in a chase.
---
Luckily for you, Spirit obeys the rules of *both* pallets and windows!
---
As a Myers main lower him down, he's not that good. Outisde EW3 he can be looped like any other killer AND has to build his power
---
That mind numbing experience is also the way you escape. 
---
That mind numbing experience is also the way to punish a killer who decides ur friend on the hook would probably be a lot happier staring at him while the spider cthulu claws form around him.
---
No no, chasing a swf of lauries as myers
---
Um hey what does SWF mean ?
---
It's not a bonus if the original speed is nerfed. No thanks. Ruin and pop every game makes for a long gen m1 sim already.
---
It's odd, once i've seen a video where a guy with spirit used both hunted and devour, people did not destroy a totem cuz they knew about hunted grounds. I tried it, 25 seconds and both of them where destroyed, and a team of urban invasion spended the next minute in a bush i guess
---
Rank 1 here. I don't understand how you guys are only facing spirits. I face a variety of killers these days... yesterday I played all day and only faced 2 spirits. Played the same guy 2 games in a row.
---
I personally hate playing vs Billy a lot more than spirit, but that's not an opinion a lot of people seem to share. A good Billy will fuck your world up.
---
this is so sick I love it
---
Oh wow, actually not haha, didn't realise it until now because I didn't knew another term for "hidden strong but underpicked".
---
The killer is zombie. just one, simple zombie
---
Reddit is killer sided. That's why.
---
I wanna see one of ace hiding from the hag if you make that I would be amazed
---
had this happen too many times, now I just tell my friends to do what they want but then thats worse cause they panic more lol
---
I‚Äôve played on and off a long time, survivor with friends but killer when they aren‚Äôt on. What is up with killer que times lately? I play on pc and it takes like 10-15 minutes to find a game. It used to take about 2-3?
---
Huntress should be in shredded; she doesn‚Äôt fist fight moose for a ‚Äúnice body‚Äù
---
The fix is not nerfing gens...again. lol.
---
New Killer: The Batman   
---
Perks: The Symbol, Arkham Knight, and Hex: Parent Issues
---
IMO Corrupt Intervention is better. I‚Äôm sure someone will come along to insist it isn‚Äôt, but I like the setup time it gives Trapper/Hag, and gives three fens to patrol over all of them. Give it a try and see if it works for you. 
---
P.S. if you like Surveillance, it works with surge, that you apply it to any gen hit by surge.
---
I'd love a Ghostface one ;)
---
How can you borrow smth from your bloodweb
---
Michelle Myers?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox.  Game seems to be as healthy as ever.
---
Yeah, that's why he's so picked at higher ranks lol. Just play in the red ranks and see how many demogorgons you'll play against. All the strategies you stated are only doable against low rank survivors.
---
That's what I call her, actually!
---
Cool. New lore.
---
Except for the fact that you have no way of knowing if a window is being vaulted or she's phasing until you've been downed from it. Someone like Trapper has to work with windows and pallets, but if he vaults a window, you have time to react, if he traps a pallet, you have time to react. 
---
Is the spirit vaulting or standing still? Who knows
---
Is the spirit phasing or standing still? Who knows
---
But it's fine, just run 2 specific perks to counter a single killer and it's perfectly balanced and workable .
---
Change prayer beads, add a vaulting animation, and give a tell when phasing. Any person remotely competent at playing spirit would be able to perform just as well with these changes, and it would make it something you could actually attempt to work around.
---
What a terrific idea... That actually sounds really awesome and I want it so much now wow
---
It‚Äôll happen when you play spirit, get used to it as you move up to higher ranks as well
---
The rule for unrelated content says just slapping the name on it isn‚Äôt enough to make it related, so don‚Äôt be surprised if it gets removed again.
---
Survive With Friends
---
What are you even on about? Every moment I'm not in a chase, I do a generator. Every time I am in a chase, I'm in a chase. If all four survivors are alive, the survivor on the hook always gets rescued by the time I could even make it over there because my teammates are usually just waiting for the immediate unhook, rather than doing generators, so I don't bother unless there's a risk said person goes into struggle or dies on hook.
---
The only thing I don't actively do is try to hide from the killer or crouch from one generator to another, because it wastes a ton of time.
---
What I was saying was that the most fun and engaging part of the game is also the least rewarding in the end(Because you get hooked, you cap out chase points fairly fast and there's a much higher risk you don't escape)
---
I am usually always gold or iridescent in gen repair, even when everyone dies, and that's despite also having gold or iridescent in chase most of the time(Or silver, because being downed no matter how long the chase, still rewards less points than even half the time if you manage to escape)
---
Lmao chill, not everything is that serious. Do you also take pointing as toxic?
---
He played that super dumb.  If he had just stayed in the hallway betwen that room where the pallet is and the exit gate area, you would have been screwed.
---
Unfortunately i am a poor ass student so i can't afford all these killers, but thanks for the advice. I guess i should hope the next week pop, make your choice, surge ans corrupt will be in the market üòÇ
---
One good game doesn't mean your experience will be good.
---
You will be bullied and looped constantly on m1 killers.
---
I played ghostface and pig to red ranks, It's not enjoyable at all. Survs just follow you around because they know they can just loop you for ages, esp on safe maps like haddonfield.
---
U need to add smol billy
---
I would bone that.
---
Damn. I liked the extra objective element. Like the lantern thing, it added a way to make games longer.
---
What Nurse nerf/rework are you talking about? Did I missed something?
---
Heavy Panting becomes better while Jenner's was and still is meh. And the Plaid Flannel...Well. We don't talk about that one.
---
If you're actually referring to the Add-On adjustments that is. Besides of that I've not witnessed any announced Nurse changes yet.
---
When your random teammates equip together a flashlight, and you know the killer is going to quit the lobby üòÇ
---
Are there any good streamers that don‚Äôt have their faces or crazy crap on the screen? I‚Äôd just like to watch the gameplay.
---
Yeah, but people on Reddit don't understand jokes.
---
Tbagging is stupid if the killer is good, cuz you'll die, and it's toxic if the killer is not good. Just play the damn game lmao
---
I don't like it.  Bad players just stare at the gen.  Good players are surveying their surroundings.  This would make it so that you would have to play like a bad player to get a repair bonus, which i just am not sure about.
---
No, they pulled it off because the killer followed them away from the exit gate when he should‚Äôve stayed there until the EGC timer ran out.
---
Nancy just wants her totem
---
Clearly you've never played against a spirit above rank 20.
---
You‚Äôre severely overestimating red rank survivors. A good 90% of them are just average at best and any half decent killer can deal with them. The only time demo isn‚Äôt a viable pick is against meta-SWF that don‚Äôt make mistakes. 
---
Besides, resorting to ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you see so many of *x killer* at higher ranks‚Äù sarcastically is so stupid, That can be applied to literally every killer that isn‚Äôt Spirit or Nurse. Hell even BILLY isn‚Äôt as picked anymore so it‚Äôd apply to him too. 
---
The fact of the matter is most people agree demo is mid tier with his base kit and can possibly be mid-high with the right addons, he‚Äôs no way shit tier with clown and wraith.
---
yes sure
---
Damm, I‚Äôm at a 120 and only rank 7!
---
Oh yes, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll never get them 5 minutes back ever again.
---
The white was a visual glitch
---
I know it was a joke dude lol
---
"Licensed Clown"

Imagine having a meme removed, and instead of stopping to think "Hmm, maybe I did something wrong" you instead double down and go "Nope, the people of the internet NEED to see  this masterpiece I put together in MSPaint in 30 seconds."
---
Is it a hat or an elephant inside a snake
---
I mean I understand what you're saying. I just won't agree with you :)
---
DEVS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY WONT ADD A KILLER THAT HIDES ITSELF AS A SURVIVOR
---
Corrupt has appeared on the shrine once and I coulda sworn pop did a few weeks ago. 
---
I‚Äôm waiting for Discordance. :C
---
But it never does, does it...
---
The only time I'm worried about a killer is if they have legacy on
---
Thank you
---
That is a very good question and I am sorry I do not have the answer for.
---
If I‚Äôm running better together, for the love of God, don‚Äôt come over if the killer is chasing you. If a teammate is hooked and the killer is chasing you, lead them away from the killer. And please, if I‚Äôm running kindred and you see the killer is camping, just do gens, homie. I will hit struggle all day so you can get out. On the flip, if they‚Äôre not camping, please save me ;;
---
It would be fine if it worked like fortnite and such.  (Which I haven‚Äôt played that game in a long time so it may have changed) 
---
It‚Äôs cross platform, but only time you‚Äôll get matched with pc on console is if you have joined someone else on pc, like a friend. So you know the risk
---
Can you guys not read? It's an update to their backend,  it has nothing to do with bug fixes or content
---
I don't think pop appeared in recent times, if it happened i'm going to be really sad. Decisive strike happeares twice in 5 months, wtf
---
I wish I could draw like this, I have some ideas for stuff
---
The mods are coming for you Gardant
---
Pray to whatever diety you believe in
---
For 'tis said they be of homosexual proclivity
---
The only problems I've encountered are on some of the maps there's like a purple overlay on some of the textures (temple of purgation and the game). And occasionally while searching for a match (and once while loading into a match, after the offerings) I'll get kicked back to the main screen with a connection error. Over all I haven't really came across any toxicity from either killer or survivors üòé long may it continue.
---
I searched everywhere and no one knows unfortunately... I think she speaks an ancient language so nobody knows specifically what she says. Appreciate it though :)
---
Are the 4 minute queues in higher ranks too?
---
His favorite killer
---
"Sexy legs" i agree.
---
Since I saw a German post in your history I assume German streamers are fine as well ... TwisTonFire (fog whisperer) plays mainly on PC but on consoles as well (killer, solo survivor and SWF with viewers), he played PS4 just this last weekend.
---
Psyk0ra plays survivor on PS4 though I wouldn‚Äôt count her among ‚Äûbest‚Äú or ‚Äûmost popular‚Äú but I occasionally watch simply because I want to know what others are experiencing in my region on my system (= matches that could have happened to me).
---
You pay 10 bucks and you get the chance to get a bunch of useless shit you don't want and 2 good skins.
---
So, you don‚Äôt have a suggestion? That‚Äôs fine. 
---
Until you, or someone else, can come up with a perk that makes sense and fits the character, then I‚Äôll keep Decisive Strike 2.0
---
When you are new to the game, NOED is the most strong perk in the game because:
---
A) You don't know how to loop.
---
B) You don't know totem locations.
---
Once you become experienced enough, NOED is a bad joke because you have more control over it than the killer itself AND he played with 3 perks throughout the entire match (increasing his chance of losing before the match even started). More often than not I single-handedly remove all 5 totems or cleanse the hex totem once its lit instead of sitting at the exit gates while the killer is chasing / hooking someone.
---
Missed opportunity
---
He could be an opposite-Legion. Instead of a power that's more powerful when the survivors are together, it's more powerful when facing solo survivors.
---
Also, you're forgetting that The Entity alters the killers. Do you really think a gang of teenagers or a single average-height and - strength woman would successfully work in the game? Cause they do.
---
Scrolled through here just for this.
---
This gets brought up constantly, and they commented on it not long ago. They arent planning on it.
---
Also makes everything. This game would be dead without swf
---
That was given to everyone who owned the game last year when DBD was showcases at the VGA
---
Bought him the other day and ran him at level 1.
---
Absolute garbage,only redeeming quality was I could say hello to a survivor before they ran off thanks to bbq&amp;chili.
---
Let‚Äôs not talk about that time I got pallet looped to oblivion at level 15 because he was too slow to catch up and by the time the chainsaw was revving up the survivor found another pallet.
---
His m1 is basically saying goodbye to a survivor because good luck catching up.
---

---
Honestly, fixing a bug isn't a nerf.
---
the joke is that I am the one who got myers into tier 3 and im sitting on a gen getting stalked
---
Bummer, I owned the game at that time, but didn't log in. Anyway, will it ever potentially come back?
---
Or one messes up a skill check altogether and then it‚Äôs like a domino effect with everyone else messing up and you‚Äôre back to 70% with the killer approaching. Feels good.
---
Imagine thinking spirit isn‚Äôt broken
---
They can always request it. Valve doesn‚Äôt even sell this.
---
They could find something awesome to do, im sure of it.
---
It's far more difficult than you think.
---
Fucking. Cry. About. It.

Just because she isn‚Äôt as piss weak as Wraith, doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs broken you entitled fuck

Personally I'm glad to hear that port went well and that the framerate is playable. I just can't support the game or recommend it to friends when they charge so much.
---
Leatherface in this style would just be amazing!
---
Keep it up!
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Gen tapping is the worst thing you can do into ruin.
---
Being good at skill checks still slows the game down as you don't get bonus progress.
---
great job
---
/s
---
 Your friends should just deal with it and play with you no matter what. You guys are playing SWF after all. 
---
Every killer main on this sub knows that when you join a SWF lobby, everyone automatically become god tier gen rushing survivor. 
---
It‚Äôs easy. One swing, two swing, hook and done. It‚Äôs a competitive game, so always being the ‚Äúnice killer‚Äù does nothing for you. It‚Äôs not like they are going to spread the word if your good deeds. Are they going to make a statue of me? No? Well okay then, you can die.

Useless perk

Trapper should be with Myers
---
And the right map layout. Or survivors that make mistakes.
---
Progress *should* be held on their servers rather than locally on your machine - I'd suggest contacting their official support for both safety and peace of mind.
---
Bubba at least has to potential to do something big. Legion is just a linear trash can.
---
Now for the new crusade. Only like 3 or 4 more to go i don‚Äôt remember how many there were.
---
Legion hides away it's mask slowly...
---
More like babble.  teehee, see what I did there?
---
What does it do? It seems to interrupt doing a gen with the puking.
---
pointing out that this subreddit has a blatantly obvious killer bias doesnt mean you are ‚Äúsurvivor sided‚Äù.
---
I would bet my money on the opposite :)
---
How long have you been playing this game?
---
&gt; The Korean and Russian regions bring forth the best players in this game, completely serious.

Literally any game that wagers players potentially shit talking in endgame chat it's a russian who won't understand it anyway.
---
Any time someone DC's against a fucking demogorgon or no add-on huntress on a nice map it's a fucking russian name
---
From my personal experience russians are notoriously shit.
---
It's no problem at all, good luck!
---
I see the /s but what you say it true about killer mains
---
I don't feel like it is. If I reveal a ghostface, they will oftentimes teabag me and then sometimes leave if I'm in a super safe area.
---
That never feels toxic, more like swiper being told not to swipe or w/e
---
Dedication can quickly become obsession.

Killer at low ranks: wonder what builds survivors will use.
---
Killer high ranks: wonder how many swf P3 Claudette's with insta heals and BT I'll have to deal with today.
---
I can't figure out what "meta" perk or "meta" build is even supposed to mean. I keep seeing it on here and I keep hearing streamers saying stuff about the "meta" of this game.
---
This. Sub notifications, bits, etc is how the streamer gets paid. So they are going to acknowledge those things.

You are better off liking for YouTube videos.

Good luck brother. Deus vult.

Don't sweat your rank. I've been playing since launch and I'm coming up on 2,000 hours, and I will tell you right now that killer slowly stops being fun the higher you rank up. Rank 10 is pretty close to the sweet spot.
---
Fantastic work, unquestionably. The Bear Trap on a chain is a nice touch, would probably be easier transport overall that way. At the same time, the titles feel real, legitimate, and I frankly want to see what misfortune Dwight finds.
---
The one and only thing I may suggest, with your welcoming of constructive criticism, is a bit of recoloring in the background to stay a little closer to the palette of the MacMillan Estate. But frankly, that's such a minor detail that it's your call.
---
Try other killers, don't stick to chases for too long, try Discordance and Pop goes the weasel, during mid game ignore generators that are isolated or in a bad place. Tunnel if you have to, if they save too quickly
---
absolutely

So that's what he has in the locker

dont you know Micheal is stocking the blood on his knife
---
Meta is a term in many video games. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs an acronym for *M*ost *E*fficient *T*actic *A*vailable
---
It‚Äôs basically perks that work very well in almost every situational and don‚Äôt require complex situations to be useful
---
I really appreciate you writing all this down. Thank you!
---
I can't remember if it interrupts doing a gen or not, but if it does, that still isn't an action speed decrease.
---
being fully sick causes you:
---
* to infect other objects/survivors
---
* be broken/injured
---
and your aura can be seen while puking if the Plague is using an add-on called "black incense"
---
It‚Äôll only give the killer a notification if you sprint away from it as your opening it, if you close it slowly it won‚Äôt.
---
I started playing in like May and I still got it lol
---
Think last time I saw Freddy was over a week ago, and I play the game for atleast 1 hour daily after work and a fair bit on weekend. Im hooked!
---
I think if you halved the regression and maintained it only being killer radius regardless of rank ( or maybe scaling distance ) it could be viable and not too broken 
---
As it stands a Doctor makes this perk S+ tier on smaller maps with a terror radius build
---
They re-enabled Peer to Peer connections, so it could be that you're connecting to laggy Killers when you try playing Survivor.
---
*pressing leave match noises*
---
I can't quote anything or provide a link, but I remember when they said this. It wasn't really in relation to dedicated servers. It was just a general threat that they never actually followed through on, and I kind of doubt they will.
---
Definitely needs a buff, his ability is basically useless.
---
The Entity works in mysterious ways.
---
Thank you!
---
Wut? Just use her ability to slow down the game as it's intended. Not to tunnel a trapped survivor with an ''endgame pig'' . And don't rely on noed. Does not sound like a nerf to me.
---
Oh thats fine then
---
Here comes the trapper
---
I know i missed it the last second, it just happens man.
---
I absolutely notice the difference. When I queue up as survivor i almost instantly get into a lobby almost every time. But with killer, it takes an agonizingly longer amount of time to get into a lobby. Was just confused because it seems like being killer would automatically load you in a lobby since you're the host.
---
Or just look around occasionally instead of swiveling all the time.
---
This is really well done
---
I really like these ideas, with a few things to point out.
---
4 people running One Man's Trash would be an absolute nightmare to play with. Imagine the preschool basement hallway with two pallets. That can be replaced when broken. Giving survivors an option to add pallets would never not be terrible, because you could create an extremely safe loop/structure 4 times over.
---
Pressed Flower and Crinkled Shift Schedule just feel like another Prayer Beads Bracelet, and I don't think that as an addon is one that is enjoyable to go against. 
---
I think these were designed with her power though, and she would be a lot like old Freddy in the fact that you simply cannot injure survivors for 5 seconds after finding them. I don't think she'd be able to play against any decent survivors, because 5 seconds of the transition is more than enough time to get to a safe area.
---
Wallflower is a really nice perk idea, though it should realistically apply to the terror radius as well, because if it is specifically for lullabies, it would be completely useless on all but 3 killers.
---

The Terror

---
um, I dont gave discordance or pop goes the weasel
---
You'll be doing yourself a favor if you do. XD
---
Uh
---
I don't think I ever got to experience dedicated servers. I play on console. Just seems imbalanced how short of a wait I have as survivor to get in a lobby, whereas I'm waiting a long while as killer for the same thing.
---
This is beyond perfect for me . I wish i could do something like this one day .
---
Free Borrowed time anyone ?
---
Ngl I hate playing against spirit too, it‚Äôs extremely unfun.
---
I mean the killer can only chase 1 of you anyway regardless of ruin or not.
---
Ruins purpose is to slow the game down because without it, survs just power through gens in 2mins.
---
It succeeded at that, either by preventing additional progress from good skill checks or making people find the totem.
---
Doc is a really bad killer against survivors that know how to play.
---
He's a really great killer against survivors that don't know how to play as well and prefer to hide. It balances in that way, but I only wish I came across more doctors D:
---
I agree with DCs dicking over the survivor team. For a while, I've had an idea for a fix for that. When a survivor DCs, the number of generators needed to be completed should just decrease by one. Problem solved. Yes, there are nuances that don't make this a perfect fix, but generally speaking this would maintain relative balance.
---
Saw something in German while skimming through your Reddit history so thought you were German. Was just checking if recommending German streamers made sense. Otherwise I‚Äòd only know of Puppers who has already been mentioned.
---
I love playing Doc he‚Äôs by far my favorite but he is kinda difficult in some ways definitely
---
It‚Äôs pretty good if you combo it with other slow down add ons/perks but it‚Äôs pretty underwhelming by itself.
---
Nah comic style skins for everyone one, vintage skins
---
no /thread
---
Yeah, he used to be my favorite, but he lacks any power in a chase which makes him difficult to do super well at. A really strong loop and a pallet can be the end of a doc :'(
---
75% of my games someone dcs soon after the match starts when I run hex ruin. And they are almost always the highest rank amongst the survivors
---
Could of sworn it did...
---
Spooky scary skeletons send shivers down your spine!
---
Thank you!!!
---
He is absolutely useless. His ability is shit.
---
So he dodges all killers that punish bullshit that is OoO LUL
---
I was so excited about most of those builds, but then i had to downvote because you said nurse isnt fun
---
Arent the archives, animations and lore expansion?
---
It‚Äôs a reward for owning both left for dead 2 and dead by daylight. 
---
It‚Äôs there for a reason, to advertise the other game and vice versa
---
Get em, they are Legion and Clown's teachables
---
Yeah and there is a rework planned eventually
---
Someone needs to give this killer an award
---
He does need a buff yes. But get some sleep buddy and start going to class. It's a video game. Failing your classes ain't going to get you fae in life
---
Spirit is best mom
---
And then they pop it with PGTW and you go to tap it to stop the regression but they also have overcharge + Lullaby.
---
You spelled treacherous wrong
---
yeah for sure, and no shame in using one, but it makes it less impressive.
---
0 effort cosplay.  Just make it yourself, thats the whole point
---
Why would a fix to the backend servers have anything to do with cross platform, crossplatform would be something that would take awhile to implement, I feel?
---
Oh leatherface is now trash ? Legion is very underpreforming killer tied with trapper. We BeTtEr nErf PiG
---
My friendly ghost mom build is there to ensure the survivors are safe and get hot cocoa

---
Yeah

---
Gen tapping is awful, never do it. It;s even better if you miss a few skill checks then tap through a gen
---
I had no idea, do the specify as to what they might change?
---
Thank you!!!!!
---
No exhaustion recovery 
---
Start the trial injured, but don't show the killer as such, the killer will see your animation and know, but when the trial starts there is no representation on the HUD
---
What can bubba do that‚Äôs big? Instant down a survivor if there‚Äôs no pallets or windows within 20 meters?
---
He needs to after he beats the kids
---
Alternate universes. King‚Äôs books take place in a multiverse that are all connected by the dark tower. There are many versions of Derry, in some of them Pennywise doesn‚Äôt die
---
Your name is relatable
---
I think one of the most important skills you can learn as killer is knowing what to prioritize and situational awareness. You COULD chase the injured survivor you havnt hooked you see on a gen across the map from the last other 3, or you could keep chasing the healthy one running towards your 3 gen whose also dead on hook. it‚Äôs something I see a lot of killers struggle with. It‚Äôs something you mostly learn from playing, but you can also watch someone like otz to give you that extra edge. also I think a basic tip you should know is, if a survivor wants to be chased / is acting cocky, you really shouldn‚Äôt chase them first. you need to kill the immersed Claudettes doing gens to heavily hinder the toxic Neas with flashlights and object of obsession.
---
Skimming through my posts as in seeing that nearly half a year ago I commented under a German post. Really creepy dude.
---
I play both sides, personally I would never run NoEd as I think it's disgusting and cheap. Exposed effect is fine, come 1 tap me, but the additional speed is just no skill. However I think noed is perfect how it is, it wont help you +1 pip or help you improve your mindgames/chases, it will just get those end petty kills that dont mean much. Plus if you run NoEd you're kinda planning to lose and get to end game, instead of running a confident useful early game build.
---
I have to disagree with the billy part of that statement but I agree he is very strong.
---
I think it comes down to the quality of the average loop, the size of the map and the sight lines. 
---
So Billy feels stronger on more open maps with weak jungle jims and good line of sight like mount ormont, temple of purgation and yamaoka estate, hes also solid on maps where most of the pallets are unsafe like gas heaven. That said he is terrible on maps with multiple window loops/jungle gym chains, poor sight lines or limited ability to chainsaw across the map in which case Billy is obviously worse than Freddy.
---
I do feel that the average map is more beneficial to Billy than Freddy but Freddy is always a solid pick regardless of map whereas billy might just lose because le treatment theatre/game/research facility and he becomes barely better than leatherface
---
Teabagging to fellow survivors = positive thank you. Teabagging killer = toxic taunting equivalent to flashlight clicking them
---
The reason Bill's holster is empty is because Dwight swiped his piece.
---
how much?

Yesss this also makes stealth killers a lot stronger, but also is a nice idea
---
either how their ability works or their add ons. theres a few add-ons that don't even work because they had synergy with the way legions ability used to function but they changed that but didnt change the add-ons so now Legion is slightly cripled.

I am strictly a hag main, I would recommend trying her out and learning her distinct play style. She has a learning curve for high ranks, but once you‚Äôre good with her you‚Äôre unstoppable. Good luck on getting to red ranks (: ! I view it as a fun challenge but honestly it‚Äôs not the best if you‚Äôre quick to rage /:
---
Switch version is an absolute blast! I've been loving every second of it.
---
I hate the hatch changes u can escape with 5 gens left and being afk the whole game ( if m8 are dead ofc)
---
Not if you break chase.
---
I'm just having fun üòÇ it's not the serious I don't really play killer much cause i like playing with friends
---
no mither
---
am i a joke to you?
---
No criticism.  Only praise. You hit that one out if the park.
---
So random question.
---
I play demogorgon(but this applies to every killer) but what should I realistically be doing when the survivors are rushing to get the gens done.  Like I'll be searching and suddenly a gen pops, and then I'll go that way to try and find the survivors and then boom another one is done. 
---
Should I try to abandon destroying the gens to try to kill a survivor? Because in some games the rate of repair is just so quick that it's like there's no reason try and damage gens.
---
I have been looking for some horror canvas/posters. I'd buy the fuck outta these if it was on a aluminium plate or a canvas.
---
Gets boring when everyone DCs.  Sigh.
---
This is awesome. Make them all lol
---
They would have to pay royalties plus it‚Äôs not even that good of a cosmetic also if you want it this badly go on red bubble or something and ask someone to make it
---
The only thing I dislike is the forced TAA, and a little bit on the dc killer.
---
If a killer doesn‚Äôt run ruin you know it‚Äôs gonna be a fast game
---
If its garbage don't play it, not complicated
---
To add to this, When survivors only have one or two gens left, it's pretty common for one to try to distract or lure you away. Prioritizing objectives is important. Even if that survivor is injured or dead on hook, consider the time it's going to take you to make that happen and how quickly the other survivors will finish the remaining gens. Sure you may get that survivor in the end but with three escapes it's less rewarding. Breaking off and doubling back to check on gens, hindering their progress can often cause survivors to make more mistakes.
---
No particular order for the perks, one perk isn‚Äôt above the other in specific tiers.
---
The perks are ranked by how they improve chase time, generator speed, stealth and how situational they are.
---
Urban evasion S? x)
---
Self care and deliverance A.... I'd say lower.
---
Isn't "we'll make it" meta?

I'm totally here for this

---
She's definitely not for everyone! Thank you :) if I were to offer unsolicited hag advice, I'd recommend playing to a 3-gen camp setup as much as possible. Hag is great at controlling a relatively small zone and you can really fuck 'em up that way! In any case, see you in the fog!
---
Killers are already good, if you have ever played against a ruin Freddy with pop gens are already long enough, adding this makes it even longer and more tough to escape, I think instead of buffing all killers we should just buff the ones that are lower tiers, I don‚Äôt mind a buff to lower killers to make them more usable, but there‚Äôs killers like spirit and nurse that already make it extremely hard to escape with. So overall just buff the weaker killers rather then nerf all survivors.
---
Do people use it? No. That's the point, if hope gave double the haste people wouldn't use it yet, my point is that if bhvr buffed such perk and people still wouldn't use, then why keep it there?
---
‚ú®~*explosions of mud and blood*~‚ú®
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Because different perks suit different playstyles and it is fun to have a variety of perks to play around with and have different builds for different things.
---
This is really wonderful!!
---
Ayyy Charlie
---
I had this Dwight outscore me the other day, no one was popping generators for 4-5 minutes while Ruin was up and I was trying to heal them and unhook them.
---
I hop on a generator a couple minutes in (I was first chased/hooked, so) and what is this Dwight doing? 'Moonwalking' like Noob3, walking backwards, wiggling his camera, passes me by and keeps hunting totems.
---
I spectate after he farms me off with Borrowed Time and goes down and the Spirit (of course) tracks me because I'm injured and I go back down anyway, and that's all he's doing all game.
---
I was pretty salty that someone could earn more points by directly sabotaging and trolling their fellow survivors and refusing to do gens.
---
not a dbd streamer but checkout vinesauce, first streamer ive seen that doesn't have any sub alerts or anything, its all just gameplay and commentary
---
bump doctor up a tier tf
---
I legit feel like as Ghostface I can stand what feels to be about a meter away from the pallet before it gets thrown down and yet I still get stunned, but doing the exact same thing as anyone else doesn‚Äôt do that. I tried looking it up and I found nothing, but I swear I‚Äôm not crazy.
---
Dwight is always attractive but he is so sexy in the intro! üòè
---
I love youüíõ
---
It's good but I like Discordance better.
---
Urban Evasion is the best perk for stealth and avoiding the killer along with Iron Will.
---
Deliverance is a free kobe which then allows teammates to spend more time on gens. As much as people like to meme about it, Self-Care isn‚Äôt terrible. Healing yourself without the use of a medkit is still good, teammates can do gens and you can use the open item slot for a toolbox.
---
We‚Äôll Make It is definitely not meta. It‚Äôs still good, but only works with SWF consistently.
---
Ya it‚Äôs normal, it makes a noise when someone cleanses and when the plague picks up a cleanse
---
It's about points per second though.
---
Glad to see im not the only one!

y naht both

haha second chance perks
---
Hahah wait till you get purple/red rank and you leave with 18k after taking all the palletes to the face

If i wasn't competitive i would 100% stay at green and yellow ranks forever, that's the most fun games i get. 
---
Both sides too.

Oh that's so cool dude!

---
ok?

I know. I'm saying I got the surge one alongside another one lmao

oh i was trying to make a joke like "i don't see any totem!"
---
now i feel awkward
---
Check Ardetha's "Bubba Cosplay" video on YT
---
*Loud warning*
---
That's the whole point of the post, Hope don't give you any difference in play style, 7% haste isn't that much, you won't loop better, you won't mind game better, it isn't a game changer such adrenaline or even diversion, it does a small change for a small time, dbd have too many perks which is great, but more than Half of them are useless and only ocupy space in your RAM
---
Ah. Yes. But it‚Äôs okay when you assume shit about my life? Okay. This is when I stopped taking you seriously. It is clear you‚Äôre just a troll trying to get a reaction out of me. What, are you bored?
---
You don't have to do generators to get decent points though, a lot of people are happy to skip out with 20k because they farmed people off the hook with BT, cleansed a bunch of the totems, joined a single generator halfway through to proc Detective's Hunch, use all the pallets and either get hatch after everyone dies, or open a gate when they get carried.
---
They often don't heal people because unhooks are enough points for their altruism, though if they do, it's just to lead the killer back to you again.
---
Imagine bothering to watermark low effort "memes" like these.
---
Let the salt flow through you
---
Eh. Sure he could have waited but that's boring. The killer chose to make the final Chase interesting. It's unfair to call it horrible play when his other choice was to stand completely still.
---
And it looks weird with some of his weapons.
---
Really?
---
You don't say?
---
It's why I asked. It also doesn't happen frequently, but as I stated as I'm looking for a survivor a gen pops, and then I'll try to head in that direction to find survivors and then gen 2 pops. I might find a survivor by that point in time and as I down them gen 3 pops. So now I go to find other survivors/gens to break, and an unhook happens and another gen pops. So yeah. This is the situation I'm just trying to figure out.
---
GG EZ
---
I dont want to be able to team speak. The full idea of dbd is the fact you're in a game and cant communicate properly so have to figure it out together somehow. I would rather they allowed SWF but removed any and all voice chat which I know is hard due to parties but there must be a way
---
Perhaps. 
---
The problem is then it creates another huge advantage to foregoing chat commands in place of voice comms.
---
Never using the commands would make that perk useless and put the soloqueuers at another disadvantage.
---
Well I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been stated anywhere, but I‚Äôm under the assumption that SWF technically isn‚Äôt supposed to be able to communicate the way they can. Lack of information is one of the intended weaknesses of survivors, but there‚Äôs no way to regulate players using other platforms to communicate (PS4 parties, calls, Etc.). I don‚Äôt see them adding communication features for solos because no one was ever supposed to communicate to begin with
---
Got it. Thank you!
---
Who has surveillance?
---
I do though, it's all the same issue when it comes down to things that aren't interactive and essentially "afk gg ez".
---
When Ruin spawns next to a generator and you don't have to work for it, when a Killer is camping you in the basement and you just load up Youtube. When it's a Nurse. When you spawn on maps with an infinite that you can mindlessly run. When you're playing against Demogorgon with two portals at each of the remaining three generators and can't touch them.
---
When the gates spawn too close to ever possibly open no matter what.
---
What‚Äôs the best way to counter plague. It feels like a lose-lose especially when they have thanataphobia.
---
Michael also wears a mask, why isn't he with the others?
---
There isnt. Unless you want BHVR to have access to all the info to your processes, they cant regulate what other programs are running, and they shouldnt, tbh.
---
Love this aesthetic! Please do more!
---
Wut
---
Well there's two different types of fair, an equal chance of two events happening across a large sample size, and something feeling fair on a case-by-case basis...

How did you manage to put urban evasion at s but fixated is b?

Make a Manga cover for the Spirit!

Idk what to tell ya
---
Yeah, like this rank matchmaking too, 2-4 persons must to suffer just to make one person happy.
---
Mask finally came in the mail so i wanted a quick pick of my costume so i just put on the mask and jacket, went to the basement and crouched lol.
---
So, Monto, Ohtofu, and Hybridpanda all do videos on YouTube. Monto has his face on the corner, but beyond that nothing all over the screen.

Now they all talk. You aren‚Äôt going to find videos where people aren‚Äôt running commentary.
---
Dude well played for real thats fuckin cool as, i was even dissapointed because i briefly thought it was real haha, but onestly awesome man would love to see more.
---
Holy shit that art is amazing! You nailed the style to perfection! Great job, please make more! Love love love it!!!
---
Honestly i just watched otzdarva and truetalent play killer alot and now I'm in red ranks (3) as killer. I copy moves i see them do in game. Most importantly for me is to know when to give up a chase and move onto another survivor. I used to spend all game chasing one person. Thats how I'd always lose
---
You‚Äôll be doing yourself a favor if you do. XD
---
Adding to this idea, don't be afraid to leave a gen and turn back around sometimes and just check it for safety. Easy way to catch one of these survivors off guard.
---
I understand the game was balanced with the lack of communication in mind, but BHVR allows friends to queue up together knowing full well they have voice comms.
---
Essencially that argument is now void of any real substence. People play with comms whether we like it or not, BHVR needs to adapt
---
Why is No Mither in D tier? Should be in F tier
---
No, cross play wouldn't take very long. Regardless of which console the server will see them as the same. The only difference is taking away restrictions on which servers they can connect to.
---
That said, I don't anticipate backend fixes to result in a new feature. I've seen some issues like trapper can't walk forward over a trap he just placed since severs came out. Hopefully that's related.
---
I don‚Äôt like the perk either but it‚Äôs undeniable that it improves stealth. Just because you see a bunch of idiots use the perk improperly doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad perk. If we went by that logic then Dead Hard sucks cause a lot of people who use it suck with it too.
---
I would LOVE to have a collage of the killers w/ survivors. And make a large print for a poster in my room. Amazing. Keep it up
---
I'm rank 4 with both killer and survivor. How come when I play survivor I'm always matched with green ranks, yet when I play killer I'm always put with red ranks? This isn't me complaining, I'm just wondering why this is the case. I'm thinking maybe it's that there are more red rank survivors than there are red rank killers. I play on Xbox btw.

Call of duty black ops 2 | zombies

I disagree with the maps. Unless it‚Äôs a very survivor favoured map like haddonfield, Freddy is more consistent regarding maps. There isn‚Äôt really a bad Freddy map, I don‚Äôt think, but there‚Äôs a lot of maps that are good for Freddy and he can adapt to small or large maps due to his teleport. Billy can have some maps that are great for him, but he has a lot of maps he‚Äôs rubbish at. 
---
I also think Freddy‚Äôs power is slightly more powerful than billy. I can make billy miss if I play right, I can juke him and force him to M1. If I don‚Äôt know if the pallet is fake, Freddy won‚Äôt miss me. If he places snares down, I either have to abandon loop and get hit, or run through the snare and get hit. I think Freddy is a much harder killer to deal with, and honestly is the more boring of the two.
---
I wish they would add voice commands, like "killer is on me" or "i'll go for the rescue". But, then again, it would nullify some perks such as Kindred
---
He definitely does

Because why not it a bit hot to be honest üòç

---
Is there a road map somewhere for the games plans?
---
I mean no, the fact it gives stealth is the reason it's so bad.
---
The killer can do 8 hooks without anyone dying. When someone is playing "Muh stealth" build and refusing to be spotted all game, that goes down to 6.
---
Unless the killer is shit and finds absolutley nobody, someone has to be chased. Urban evasion just helps make sure its never you.
---
Yeah, it helps stealth. Best stealth perk in the game by a longshot. But stealth doesn't really help keep the Killer busy or help on generators or help your teammates or anything...
---
Again, it's the best stealth perk, but it's still a stealth perk in the end. Using Dead Hard properly to make a chase go on _much_ longer than usual and keep giving your teammates time to do gens or get saves or work on gates. Using Urban properly makes the Killer not find you sometimes and that's it.

---
Just put automatic quotes like in IdentityV. For example "I'm saving him", "Watch out, the killer is near", "do gens"...
---
That was a mistake it should be at A. The perk doesn‚Äôt hide you so the bonus walking speed is mainly for SB users. Scratch marks help with jukes but I feel it‚Äôs mainly training wheels. Once great survivors use it enough, they‚Äôll eventually learn the in‚Äôs and out‚Äôs of scratch marks and they won‚Äôt need to visually see the marks to make plays.
---
Indeed, there are a number of perks that would need reworking. But that was my point about 'rebalancing' the game around the changes.
---
I think doing nothing just because 'well if youre solo queue just use up a perk slot for info!' is a poor attitude.
---
Not saying thats YOUR attitude at all, dont get me wrong.
---
I actually rank up faster when queuing alone. Swf doesn't have to be an advantage --&gt; many are weaker in the endgame and killers can exploit that.
---
It‚Äôs not my fault I was sneezing
---
A smart player won't crouch around all game. Therefore urban evasion isn't s.
---
I use it on all my killers. I don't care if I'm down a slot. I hate the default FOV.
---
The way he runs down the stairs as the piano comes is hilarious
---
Well shit, the music is the whole point
---
Exactly. So that's why urban evasion is a bad perk. Fixated can allow people to avoid using scratch marks while walking at a faster speed, urban evasion let's you crouch at the same speed of walking.
---
Speed boy Quentin
---
It is the best perk in the entire game.
---
Not from a gameplay perspective, but the bonus bloodpoints plus the very useful aura reading puts it in pretty much every single Killer build by default.
---
Any plans on voice channels? Was it talked about why they don't have them?
---
I mean the one that breaks pallets when u vault them in frenzy saves soooo much time, and it‚Äôs nice to see all survivors if u hit one, but the other one is just bad imo. I‚Äôm not focusing on gens when I‚Äôm in frenzy, Im focusing on survivors.
---
Dude waaaat this is awesome!! The letters the coloring, everything! Would definitely love to see more, you have great talent
---
Lol ShowStopper was annoying but a different ps4 steamer that gets a good amount of views would be Nyla Supreme (her channel used to be called Gia Katya)
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
I notice no new map with cheaper 14. That makes me think it‚Äôs going to be like a Ghostface, a single killer with no new map.
---
Alert, Vigil, Surveillance, Knock Out.  
---
Alert is fun but not really worth it IMO, knockout can be cool with specific builds but I'd pass, and the other two are nothing special.
---
They always update the wiki if you need to check it, shrine will be different tomorrow.

Lmao imagine actually running PWYF

---
Immersion doesn‚Äôt equal stealth. Not being spotted by a patrolling killer is useful if you‚Äôre bad at the chase. It helps lose LOS and agro quicker to save yourself from being hooked.
---
Honestly comms would hilarious but there'd be so much toxicity from it. I mean it wouldn't be as bad as overwatch so i could deal with it easily
---
Maybe its an update that allows killers do gens with swf
---
Ebony mory are so rare that there is no nees to complain in my opinion, add-ons usually are balanced, the clown one is completly nosense in my opinion
---
I totally get your point, and understand your concern for the new player experience. I would argue that the new player experience is ALREADY messed up due to matchmaking / survivors not being harshly punished for purposely de-ranking.
---
But you even mentioned it in your post, youre an advocate for balancing around top-tiered play. So I KNOW you know that making the game fun for newbies and shit for everyone else isnt sustainable for long-term player retention.
---
Look whos shittin in the tall grass
---
Cleanse far away, I like that. Esp near gens that are already done.
---
That's no longer possible, the game boots you to the main lobby if anyone drops out of the game while loading.
---
Especially the pig.
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt matter.  You‚Äôll get to one and wish you were green/purple rank
---
Aftercare and/or Discordance is due up any shrine now, I'm personally pulling for discordance
---
Anyone else all in favor for a Cindy survivor? Only one who seems to survive the killer in every movie that I recall despite being clueless most times.
---
I could see it survivors aren‚Äôt use to dealing with trapper in red ranks just spirit, nurse, and billy
---
Please BHVR, I want that as merch
---
Yeah kinda wish they could buff the luck one a bit
---
A strategy or play style requiring survivors to make mistakes or play poorly result in bad killers.
---
But standing up doesn‚Äôt keep yourself hidden as well as crouching. Fixated is better if you‚Äôre in enclosed maps. But if the area is open (majority of maps) then you‚Äôll need to crouch behind something to stay hidden.
---
This drawing goes with a Legion rework idea I had that involved Th Entity controlling or at least, brainwashing the members of The Legion through the masks they wear. The masks fuse to their skin making taking them off a very painful task. I'll talk more about my rework idea with anyone interested or perhaps in a separate post.
---
the majority of the time u won‚Äôt get a key tho, it‚Äôs extremely unreliable. and if u need a key to escape a game, you already lost it tbh.
---
Theres already nutty toxicity in game, but youre right. It would open up a venue for a whole new level of "wow you guys are trash" "teamwork"
---
Dealing with it would be easy if it meant comms, though.
---
Make a smurf account or you're going to be dragging your friends to games they are unprepared for.  Are you rank 19 friends going to be cool with ruin skill checks every game?  Probably not.  Are they going to be able to loop a killer that understands how the game works?  Again probably not.
---
Think like this maybe? The killer is looking for you, and your hiding behind a tree you can walk fast in a circle around the tree if he's not looking at you then crouch that's way more efficient
---
I dont mean that aspect, i mean the constant disconnecting before game starts.
---
NP, those were just my opinions on the perks.  If you don't have the DLC attached to them and think they'll be fun by all means buy them.
---
You can still flashlight save.  It‚Äôs not meant to be easy, for a reason that they are VERY helpful in saving 1/3 hooks for a survivor.  Time it right as they pick them up, it takes practice.  Aim at the lower head, and find the timing.  It‚Äôs *near* impossible to blind while they are mid carry because they can simply look up or look away.
---
Was thinking the same thing when I saw Tydes video last night.
---
Practice blinding the killer at pallets
---
Yeah I'm an idiot. People constantly use copyrighted art/models from games like WoW to sell porn and t-shirts, people constantly use assets from games like Siege to sell custom made chibi's, necklaces and whatever the fuck else. 
---
No one was ever sued, only cease and desist orders in best cases: and those happened very rarely.
---
I want aftercare so badly. I love its design and it‚Äôs the only Jeff teachable i haven‚Äôt gotten from the shrine yet.
---
Babysitter and Second wind are both decent. You‚Äôre right about Camaraderie. Head-on is good right now because of the whole DS, IS, Head-On build. Also Plunderer‚Äôs is good if you can get a key, but the chance of that happening is slim enough to be low tier.
---
isn't this from Scary Movie? AFAIK that's not even a horror movie it's a comedy.
---
Rank 1 Huntress. I face SWF everyday, and know exactly when im playing against a good swf team or a solo queue team. The difference is staggering. If the SWF team is actually GOOD and not boosted, they will get two out everytime at *least* without question. Unless they make a major fuck up, that is.
---
Accidentally spit some drink out reading this
---
Think about what you would do and where you‚Äôd hide if you were the survivor.
---
Learn spacing.  Know when u can hit someone through a window.
---
Know when to drop a chase.  Certain loops (and loopers) are a huge time sink.
---
Watch streams.
---
Game sense comes with time.
---
Do you get points towards the Altruism medal for ranking up for doing Self Care or medkit healing yourself? I didn't see the wiki mentioning it but I keep seeing points given in the screen afterwards
---
You'll be doing yourself a favor if you do.XD
---
it's so hard to do a flashlight save because doing it successfully makes it take significantly longer to hook a survivor, so high skill and high risk for high reward
---
I asked you if you ever played swf on high ranks while ranking up. You can't with a huntress, you need a survivor to do so.
---
What perks work best on Leatherface for map pressure? Currently I run Ruin/Corrupt Intervention to force early hooks and chases, but it seems to me that this just encourages survivors to look for Ruin early.
---
Who knew hag would be so easy I hate playing against her
---
&gt; Might wanna watch out for the end game timers that aren‚Äôt synced next time though, I‚Äôve been screwed over by that more times than I‚Äôd like to admit 
---
Yep.Totally me. One time everyone escaped and I was waiting at the exit gate just piss off the killer. Just standing around and wasting time. I had a good amount of time left from what the counter shown and just when I start Teabagging, the collapse killed me. Yep. Beware that Timer people.
---
The scratch marks are red aren't they...?
---
*smiles knowing he‚Äôs learning*
---
And then she runs stridor
---
The only people supporting this are PC players who want to bully console players and console players who don't know how big the difference really is lol
---
No, i've never played on a SWF team aside from introducing a couple of friends to the game.

Certainly not high ranked, in anycase.
---
This is so cursed

Damn, that's a nice bunch of info. Thanks!

Oh lmaoo. It would be cool if there was a skin for them without masks but that's their signature thing so I doubt it will happen.

Then try it before spouting it's easy and OP.
---
Don't forget baby Dwights and Lockers
---
This is why I always expose whoever's on the gen and slap then instead of attempting a grab lol.
---
so toxic smh
---
I saw one suggestion yesterday that I really liked. A guy suggested that you reduce survivors repair speeds by 10%, BUT give them a repair speed buff of 10% if they‚Äôre looking directly at the generator. I think suggestions like this that force the survivors to choose between efficiency or awareness are fun as opposed to just a straight up nerf to survivors stats. I think we need more creative ideas like these
---
And I don't think that you literally die after playing this game (thinking emoji).
---
Its nice to be able to break pallets but hard to capitalize on that while in frenzy, since you can't down them and they can likely make it to another loop by the time you break out of frenzy. Seeing all survivors is nice too but you won't make it to the far away ones within the time limit. I find the legion pin and ruler add ons to be a lot more useful.
---
AHH HADDONFIELD, MY FAVORITE MAP
---
Only 15 cents I would pay more than that
---
So down them and wait for DS to run out. Easy counter.
---

Can you do a wraith one! I absolutely main wraith!

Right? I didn't even do anything to him. All I did was flashlight him like twice on a pallet because I couldn't get distance any other way.

That's fair, and thank you for arguing respectfully

Hard to say with such a small part of gameplay.
---
OP could have been following him around the whole game flashlightning him.
---
Personally it's annoying when three gens pop before you can down the first survivor. I know it's partly in being outplayed  by the survivor long enough for that to happen but the other part is even if you're fast that's 3 gens at 75%.
---
Many people are saying ruin is already bad enough but we don't want to run ruin every single game. It's required at higher levels for some, if not all killers. A change to fix that would be nice. Is the change posted here? Probably not, but I would prefer them trying stuff over keeping with the ruin meta.
---
Billy, your argument is "you've never tried it so you cant say its op." That's a tad childish.
---
Everyone knows that a four man SWF with voice comms is objectively more powerful than the same players WITHOUT voice comms. You dont need to be a genius to know that comms are more powerful than lack of information... Im not even sure what to say to you.
---
It looks like youre just against the idea of removing the advantage for SWF?
---
Like whats your point with this? Do you want non-SWF to not have comms? Why?
---
I really dont get it. Even if SWF isnt op, then that still means EVERYONE should have access to it. What point are you trying to argue?
---
Yeah I can agree on that. Im not saying there aren‚Äôt killer mains that aren‚Äôt just assholes in nature but generally, Its a vicious cycle. If one side will be toxic to another then in the end, It will generate double the amount of toxicity in community for both sides
---
Yes of course sorry i was thinking of grandma for hag

"It's the best perk in the game but not from a game play perspective"
---
 Bloodpoints does not affect anyone in the game.

 The aura reading while yes really useful, is extremely easy to counter in multiple ways, and there are far better perks to use rather than that on most killers.

 There is 0 reason to nerf Barbecue, there is nothing too strong about it.

When I‚Äôm playing killer, why is there sometimes an ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù icon on a survivor when I don‚Äôt have any powers dealing with obsessions
---
It took 2 minutes. And I‚Äôm not thinking this is a masterpiece. It‚Äôs just a shit post. I‚Äôm more trying to figure out how the original got taken down over a silly label
---
The general consensus is it would affect killers. So I don't really see the issue there.
---
What's D's?
---
Oh shoot.
---
Puke bone
---
The killer loses out on sacrifice points if you dc and often won't pip with just 1 dc, you get an escape if they dc.
---
2nd gen gets done while he's on the hook and it's a yellow flashlight with a yellow battery. 
---
He wasn't using that flashlight very much and the game wasn't going on very long.
---
This is so awesome!!
---
I saw that post too. Seems like a really cool idea to me! Gives a big buff to M1 stealth killers like piggy, since everyone needs to constantly keep an eye out. 
---
Like I said, I don't have all the answers, but am certainly open to cool stuff like that help killers adapt to these changes to comms in game.
---
Gotta make bubba viable somehow
---
üòÇ I'm just on coffee
---
He only found me once when I was trying to unhook someone (He was camping them but I didn't see him do the bell thing) and he followed me from there on. I would upload the entire gameplay, but I overwrite the old video clip because I don't see the point in keeping the entire thing. I really really hate people who try to get in a chase, especially while flashlight clicking so I can assure you that I don't do that. I do see how it could look that way though.
---
No. Don‚Äôt give me hopes.
---
That's exactly what we were talking about, toxic killers are just as bad a toxic survivours. We weren't trying to imply that survivours can't be toxic too or anything.
---
Yeah, make another account and tell them you'll play at their level. Or wait until rank reset and see if they'd still wanna come play
---
Sucks to have to choose between playing by yourself in low ranks or with friends in high ranks, but you know what to do. They'll appreciate getting to play at the same level &amp; it'll be worth it to start playing with your friends again. No shame
---
This sounds like you want it
---
Most likely a survivor brought in a perk that makes them the obsession or has great chance of making them be the obsession
---
I got 8 and i have a pt2 myers. Nice.
---
Because the survivors are running obsession perks. Probably DS.
---
Yeah but this has more pizazz.
---
I actually appreciate that he's trying to make it interesting and not just camping. +rep
---
Agreed. You can never beat a voice comm system, but quick chat pings would go a long way to closing the gap between solo's and SWF, especially since info in this game is remarkably important.
---
At least you guys bonded? Lmao.
---
This. I'm so tired of running ruin on every build. Gets taken out in the first minute most games anyways. I'd rather they nerf both gen speeds and ruin. Wanna stop using that damn perk.
---
I just hope the devs take notice of posts like these and actually try to implement some of these more creative ideas. The state of high ranks right now is unhealthy at best, miserable at worst, and we need some type of change soon
---
I love the fact that the community has mods who try to shift through the trash, and I‚Äôm not trying to diss them, I just don‚Äôt understand sometimes how they make their decisions.
---
I agree, I‚Äôve just had some games where I feel like the survivors where almost never in the dream realm. And that really screws Freddy over. But with all the responses I‚Äôve been getting, I feel like I can go into the game a better, more terrifying Freddy main. Also, all hail the Best Perk:Blood Warden.
---
Lol. Good catch.
---
Ye. It really depends on what is labelled as toxic however, It would be cool for Bhvr to maybe look at toxicity a bit more but for both sides no matter what, Is going to be an uphill battle. Because anyone could claim that DS with the meta perks is toxic or the Omega blink nurse
---
Also watch this be removed as well
---
And inner strength
---
I hear pig squealing (not *the* pig, just a pig squealing) and an ear raps version of the Halloween theme.
---
DART IS THAT YOU??
---
I'm a red rank Freddy main. Freddy is very good. Definitely Spirit/Billy/Hag tier. He doesn't have the snowball potential of those 3, but he's a jack of all trades. Stealthy due to the lullaby, good chase potential with snares and teleport, good map control with the teleport, and good stall with his add ons. Plus, he shines on the worst killer maps. I rarely have anyone escape on Haddonfield.
---
There are some survivor perks that increase people's chances of being the obsession, most notably Decisive Strike. If there is no obsession in the game, that means that no one is using decisive strike so you can safely pick up people without fear of them escaping you.
---
***hyuk intensifies***

I wouldn't mind a simple option to enable voice comms when in lobby for pc players, similar to what you're describing. Just goes to show BHVR can't expect to balance this game around a lack of comms on ANY platform, eh?

Agreed. I wave to say it is safe to come unhook

How did you make the mask? It's incredibly creepy and very cool, fantastic job!

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that. The default PoV is always kinda giving me headaches. Thanks for writing a comment
---
If you're not the unlucky person who tends to get spotted by the Killer first, it's actually great to rush through Ruin and provide some consistency in terms of gens. No Mither paired with Resillience, This Is Not Happening and a toolbox takes lots of efficiency away from that Ruin aswell. Plus, once it's been destroyed, TINH allows you to hit those GSC's with ease, making each skillcheck on a gen a literall boost of 2% progress / 1.6 seconds. Stacking up with the other action speed amplifiers, this turns out quite handy. 
---
The last perk would be your own choice. Streetwise is recommendable if you go for that fat commodious toolbox. If you prefer additional stealth capabillities since you absolutely dont want to get chased, get Distortion to be capable to ignote BBQ, Lightweight to roam more safely, or maybe even Urban Evasion for obvious reasons.

No plans ever. M. That was intentional fro the start. The Devs don‚Äôt  like them, and lore wise peope can‚Äôt talk on the entity‚Äôs realm (yes I know. Ash, MCotes even says they broke their rule specifically for Ash).
---
It means the survivor is using an obsession granting perk (Decisive strike, Object of Obsession, Mettle of Man, Etc)
---
I don't have much money to spend atm but when I do I'll make sure to buy it
---
I fookin love it
---
Absolutely. I think there's a lot more to be said about addons and killer mechanics that create a circle of toxicity (Nurse being the most problematic imo), Insta-hatchets, insta-heals, BNP's, etc. 
---
But one thing at a time has always been BHVR's style, so I won't get greedy and just hope for /something/.
---
This is the definition of a cursed image
---
So much wrong with this... Dead hard is such a shit perk if the killer knows you have it, How did you put WGLF above all the perks in D tier when it legit does nothing in game, Poised is an amazing perk, Pharmacy is better self care, Iron will Bond and urban are not even close 2 S tier.
---
Yeah it is definitely an issue dude
---
Thanks for that additional input, Freddy seems to have improved an absurd lot huh? I'm quite surprised they managed to give him a more or less perfect spot in terms of the tiers. Not as broken as Nurse, but still as strong as someone who ain't broken can actually be, aka Spirit and Billy.
---
I love how this is worthy of discussion lol.
---
(I'm not judging, far from it.)
---
I'm trying to get you to see that you're making this too easy on yourself. Swf is too OP, gotta rebalance the game. 
---
If four kills is utter destruction and zero kills means the killer lost and you get two kills in swf rounds. Isn't that balanced, then? 
---
Sometimes you may be able to tell that survivors are in a premade group, but certainly not all the times. Maybe good survivors become swf in your mind, because they are just that experienced?
---
I have seen so many killers bitching about the advantages of swf and good perks while ignoring the drawbacks and I have seen so many survivors bitching about the advantages of strategies, add-ons and good perks while ignoring the drawbacks. To me it seems like you are one of those and you don't realize that every strategy, every item, every add-on, and every perk can be countered. That's why I asked you to get some perspective by playing and experiencing what you're talking about.
---
It's not always the game, sometimes it's the players and unrealistic expectations.
---
this looks like that meme with the tall girl picking up the short one
---
unlike the pig, he can keep people away from a door. Hes one of the few killers ive seen actually open a fucking door and not just be fucking dumb about it. Hes not good. God is he awful. Bottom tier just like poor piggy. But if hes standing at a door and has his thing reved, you arent getting around him
---
How would zombie work though? BHVR try to implement each killer characteristics into a game. Admittedly this is one of things they can do well ... Kind of at least ...
---
Would it work like plague? With Virus but instead of just making you sick can kill you and hunt other survivors? Minion killer would be lovely and i fell in love with the idea!
---
what??? The ability to injure potentially everyone is better that nothing. He can still vault pallets and windows. He got nerfed sure, but he is absolutely better than piggy rn
---
I've done that with a swf a few times but other than that I can't see this being a norm. I guess most of the time I see a no mither player they get tunneled and typically camped till struggle
---
Right???
---
bring a insta heal and take a hit, use the insta heal and take another hit, now youve got 2 tokens of mettle of man, go get healed up somewhere and try to take  another body block hit when the time comes.
---
Love it. Hope you do more.

With it being an ultra rare, it would be nice if it extended frenzy time or increased movement speed to make it really useful. 
---
That's the ruler addon that refills the gauge, definitely one of the best. Legion pin cripples a player for a good minute, coupled with sloppy butcher and nurse's calling it is especially groovy.
---
&gt;The difference between you and me is that I can acknowledge that there's bs on both sides.
---
The difference between us is that you're fully on the survivor-bias side while I personally like to criticize both sides.   
---
But, since I know that survivors need more fixes than killers, I like to point at them more.
---
&gt; Both killers and survivors have to deal with unbalanced shit that takes away the fun from the other side.   
---
Yes, there are 2 unbalanced things survivors have to deal with and 10 unbalanced things killers have to deal with. So where's the problem?
---
I never denied that one side is perfect.
---
&gt; You, on the other hand, keep trying to argue that killers can never do anything wrong that makes the survivor feel unfun to play as. 
---
Never said that. But you keep trying to pull this card and force it onto people that argue in favor of killers.  
---
That one dude said that Prayer Beads has counterplay and you went nuts on him.
---
&gt;  It's only the "swf!!!" and "adrenaline and insta heals" that are a problem. 
---
Never said anything about adrenaline but you keep mentioning it. I think you're bringing a fight from the past into this discussion.
---
Yes, SWF break the balance of the game. Do you disagree?
---
Insta-Heals are OP. Do you disagree?  
---
What do you want me to do?  
---
Should I say stuff like: "Insta Heals are OP, BUUUUT Omega-Blink Nurses also break the balance of the game"?  
---
Because I DID SAY THAT.  
---
Stop trying to enforce your: "All people who disagree with me are biased killer crybaby" agenda here.
---
it's an opinion.  there is nothing objective about it.
---
I‚Äôm rank 11 I believe. Most games I‚Äôm against 2-3 red ranks, I just assume it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs the only people playing.
---
Amazing art work! I can feel Susie‚Äôs anger
---
This is so cuteüíìüíìüíì
---
I guess they think I'm either lying, being sarcastic or trying to take the credit from OP.
---
Don't lol at him !!! This sub is 1000000% survivor biased... even though literally all the balance discussion threads that get upvoted are heavily killer favored, and if you say anything that even remotely sounds like a survivor buff you get downvoted to oblivion.
---
But no this is a survivor biased sub.
---
I love this and your srt style
---
Ill have a cookie if youre handing them out.
---
Rank 20 is harder to get that rank 1
---
What r the two perks on left? I know ruin and bbq
---
Paint brush maybe but the others are just gimicky and give no real advantage
---
The clown 2.0 obviously.
---
I find that good Bubba games are just due to good game sense. I got Bubba up to lvl 50 and it seemed that it was more about me being good in chases than using many skills. I just embraced the M1 unless I had a daily.
---
That‚Äôs not  matchmaking tho? That‚Äôs connectivity issues. Looks like you don‚Äôt know your definitions.
---
And the way some people play this game isn't comedic already?
---
I am thou, thou art I
---
OMGGGG I WANT IT NOWWWW
---
I think OP means mori-ing
---
It‚Äôs intended to be a sequel to just the first one. Only the first and 2018 are cannon now.
---
You could report him
---
Legion is more or less a time wasting killer- use your frenzy to injure as many people as possible and then you‚Äôre a 1 shot m1 killer. I‚Äôll drop some Add on and perks below‚Äî-
---
(Add-ons)
---
Frank's Mix Tape = His best add-on since it reduces the 4 Feral Frenzy hits to kill someone to just 3
---
Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape (my favorite add-ons) Reduces the cooldown fatigue of Feral Frenzy to 1 second more or less. With this, you hit someone with Feral Frenzy once, get closer to them while still in Frenzy (you can bodyblock during the cooldown) end it manually and then use a normal M1 attack
---
From personal experience, that combo can kill FASTER than the popular Frank's Mix Tape add-on (sadly it requires 2 add-ons but i insist on how fast you can kill)
---
(Perks)
---
Discordance = gives you precise information by telling you when 2 or more people are doing a gen. Also, it's immune to aura-blocking perks
---
Thanatophobia = Legion is the only killer that can put this perk to use. It doesn't penalize the survivors that much but it won't explode like Hex Ruin. Sadly, even to this day, it doesn't count dead/sacrificed survivors (the day they change this, we may see it more often)
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse* = Having 16M terror radius can help in getting closer for the Frenzy strikes. Works nicely if paired with Discordance. Even with a 16M terror radius, you'll need good FOV blockers... he's no Meyers
---
* = Contrary to what people think, it doesn't add effectiveness to his power (40M aura reading) since you'll never reach more than one competent survivor if they split separate ways (let alone someone at 40M... Legion is not Usain Bolt)
---
Bloodhound = Though commonly used for the "blood sniffing" cheese, Bloodhound works wonderfully for tracking, especially in the dreaded cornfields
---
Sloppy Butcher = Keeps them in the injured state for longer so it's good for everyone. Ultimate tracking if used in tandem with Bloodhound
---
BBQ &amp; Chili = The staple of any killer's arsenal
---
Hex The Third Seal = Giving blindness to everyone can lead to nasty situations. Sadly it's a hex totem and countered by SWF cheating
---
Hex Ruin = Relies heavily on RNG to be of any use but can still be useful. It's up to personal preference so i still mention it
---
Save the Best for Last = Legion would be the best user of this perk if it weren't for his darn 110% speed. Worth to use once in a while (much more if using Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape) just to see what he could've been if he had 115% speed
---
Franklin's Demise = Good for him since he can strike multiple targets, forcing them to do bare-handed jobs
---
Remember Me = Not usually mentioned in Legion's builds but he can get those 6 stacks faster than anyone
---
The Bamboozle + Enduring + Spirit Fury combo = This particular set COULD work but i feel like it would only success with the Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape combo i mentioned at the beginning
---
Nurse's Calling = Not bad since you'll get injured survivors all the time and DESPITE POPULAR BELIEF, people DO heal against Legion. Will be more effective with Legion's upcoming buffs
---
(Perks to avoid)
---
Any perk with the "exposed" effect, so forget about running NOED, Make Your Choice and so on (though NOED at level 3 gives 4% speed boost and puts him 1% speed less than the average killer so it's a 50/50 decision of yours if you wanna use it)
---
Is your switch one of the newer models with the better battery life or the switch lite? On my Switch, I have framerate drops and stutter in docked mode unless I manually change the switch to run at 720p in settings.
---
I've been playing more pig. She's fun, but the genrush anxiety is real. I haven't had Ruin pop up in her bloodweb yet so if gens seem to be going fast, it's pretty much a race to get a helmet on anyone when it matters.
---
The add-ons that decrease the trap timer seem to help a ton though.
---
Hey my brother made it so i had to put it on so no hate
---
Me and other players reported him over 3 times in total. And it did not work
---
This is the best thing I've seen on the sub in a good while
---
Let me guess.
---
He suicided first hook?
---
No ive had my switch for almost a year. I'll be honest though I dont think ive ever played my switch in docked
---
trapper op
---
Wow a nea killer joke in 2019 -____.
---
I mean it takes more than 3 ppl sooner or later he will end up getting banned if enough ppl have reported him just look at the survivors being the game starts so you won‚Äôt go into the same game as him
---
Lol look at this IDIOT, confusing a generator for a totem! /s
---
I dunno I still shit my pants every time ghostface comes around a corner
---
So you're argument is 'you're not looking at the drawbacks', then?
---
You haven't given me any drawbacks to having comms...
---
That's what this whole post is about, giving everyone comms. And like I said, even if SWF isn't op and is EXACTLY balanced (which it isn't, but i'll go with that just to help you out here) that means everyone should have excess to it. You almost sound like you want to argue for its own sake because you're not making any real valid points here.
---
&gt; If four kills is utter destruction and zero kills means the killer lost and you get two kills in swf rounds. Isn't that balanced, then? 
---
No, me getting two kills *at most* against good SWF doesn't mean that voice comms are balanced. It *could* mean that its balanced! It could be that I'm just not good enough, and I definitely could use practice. Or maybe im the best huntress in the world. Or maybe I'm just average, or dogshit. But that's not relevant here because the point of this post isn't that SWF is OP or dog-shit or anything in between, its that, no matter what is it, its *better* than what solo players have and isn't what the game is balanced around. That's the point.
---
(Also, the game is currently balanced around voice comms not existing, so yes, SWF is more powerful a tool than what the game intended to have. I.E., 'over-powered'. Get it? I'm not saying remove it, I'm saying make it a constant variable in the game)
---
&gt; I have seen so many killers bitching about the advantages of swf and good perks while ignoring the drawbacks and I have seen so many survivors bitching about the advantages of strategies, add-ons and good perks while ignoring the drawbacks. To me it seems like you are one of those and you don't realize that every strategy, every item, every add-on, and every perk can be countered. That's why I asked you to get some perspective by playing and experiencing what you're talking about.
---
That attitude is only correct some of the time. Huntress insta hatchets have a crippling drawback of giving you only 1 hatchet without other addons, this does NOT mean they are in anyway balanced or can be countered. 
---
Insta-heals make it next to impossible to heal yourself fully with a medkit, this does NOT mean that they are in anyway balanced. 
---
Nurse moves slower than survivors can, wow! What a drawback! Does this does not mean that she's in anyway balanced? No, not by a fuckin longshot. 
---
Do I need to keep going on this point? This irrelevant point that has nothing to do with me wanting all survivors to be on a level playing field with each other? Do i need to? Can I stop or do you still not get it? You still don't get it?
---
&gt; It's not always the game, sometimes it's the players and unrealistic expectations.
---
Mate your head is so far up your own ass its astounding. No, it is not unrealistic for me to expect BHVR to balance their game around top tier play. It might be unrealistic to assume they'll do it *quickly* but they always come around eventually, and when they do I hope they'll take these kinds of ideas into consideration.
---
Edit: some spelling
---
Yes. Working together as a team playing cat and mouse makes it for me. I certainly dont play the game for any horror. No terror radius Myers and hag are the only things that scare me haha
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of different timelines. The timeline that the 2018 movie is in they‚Äôre not related. In the other timelines they are.
---
I instaque as survivor and killer takes 3-5 mins
---
Most likely not
---
Why‚Äôd you use ping as an excuse? PS4/Xbox players can use a lan cable as well. I do so myself. It looks like you‚Äôre trying to throw in random topics which has nothing to do with pc. Console people like are a big disgrace to console community. Making us look like bitches and crybabies because you don‚Äôt want competition.
---
Haha get it because nea ugly hahahah
---
Thank you! God every time it‚Äôs a trapper I just dc, he‚Äôs so op and I hope they remove him from the game!
---
You must be fun at parties, no one is saying you can just post clips of Halloween but this has michael in it you stale cumsock
---
Only criticism I could possibly have is the bright background doesn‚Äôt really look like dbd, a darker color would probably fit better. Incredible work!
---
I never would chief, if you kill me, gg, I escape, gg we get BP, gg
---
Well then like I said look at players before the match starts then
---
Possibly, I‚Äôm rank 4 killer so maybe most are just higher rank right now since the rest happens next week.
---
How are the players though? Are they good? Is the game still fun or is it easier?
---
Nope, escaped through the hatch after all his teammates died. 
---
He only got hooked once tho.
---
No problem, it‚Äôs too bad stealth is thrown out the window when it comes to discussion. I don‚Äôt personally enjoy it, but I know there are others who do. I‚Äôm probably gonna redo my list and post it again.
---
Thats not how reporting works, at all. Its not some instant magical thing, and it certainly takes more than just that amount.
---
Things and stuff?
---
Looking forward to a Doctor and Feng comic! If what you're doing is matching killers with the survivor they were released with. Either way I'm excited for a doctor one.
---
Pop goes the weasel (far left) and strider
---
Jesus calm down with the insults. What does being at parties have to do with anything? I said "doesn't mean you can post any clip from Halloween just because Michael is in dbd" and I was responded with "that's good enough of a reason"
---
I mean I'm only rank 19 and I have a blast. Usually 2-3 sacrifices consistently as killer and probably 75% escape rate as survivor
---
killers get mad over everything haha. Then again, so do survivors üòÇ
---
&gt; *it seems like being killer would automatically load you in a lobby since you're the host.*
---
Nope, that would just lead to the old problem where fresh "better" lobbies would constantly be chosen over people who've been sitting for a while.
---
Or how about the killers learn how to pressure gens?
---
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
---
Nope, I still don't get it. Please keep going!
---
Lol I still hate my team mates that immediately pull people off hook
---

---
Can‚Äôt wait for Steve and Demo‚Äôs comic
---
That makes sense. Thanks for the info.
---
I for one am a huge addict and I love it &gt;:D
---
I've never said it's a norm, it requieres some balls to play as it obviously ain't a easy handicap. Being involved in a chase or getting punished by stealthing can lead to you being out of the game. Also it kinda focuses on rushing the gens, which isn't the most entertaining thing to do. So it's fun when you succeeded with it like 3 or 4 times, but that's about it. So yes, ofcourse it's not a norm. Many people don't know about the build in the first place, and attempt to use it with some cheesy sabo, unbreakable or flip-flop synergy that doesn't even get a chance to work 95% of the time.
---
There are actually lots of reasons why No Mither ain't popular, not just because of the very obvious reasons, and I never denied that. Just saying that it isn't completely useless and has atleast one more or less consistent niche.
---
Bro stfu I play rank 1 and power through it in every survivor match I play. My point is that id love a game mode that had no perks add ons, or items, but your dim witted ass just immediately jumped to the defence of a perk I was not attacking. Not trying to sound like an ass hole but get out of here with the blind hostility. It's not needed or wanted by anyone.
---
An honest question - do you play survivor much?
---
To be the best killer you can be, you need to think like a survivor does. If a gen has popped, they're not going to be at that gen anymore - they'll be moving to the next one. As a killer your logical move is to look at the gens nearest the one that just popped, and decide which one seems the most likely target for survivors *and/or* is the one you can least afford to lose.
---
For example, maybe one of the gens is central to your endgame 3-gen. Maybe one is nearer to  the finished gen, maybe it's nearer to the gate and they're getting down to the last few gens. The more survivor you play, the easier you can put yourself in the right mindset - and beat survivors to the punch, rather than constantly trailing behind them.
---
Chases, gens, whatever - if you know what they're probably going to do then you have a better chance of punishing them for it.
---
Gens are the time pressure for the killer - kicking them will only buy you time if you can prevent survivors from working on the, and that's why killer needs to be on the offensive and thinking two steps ahead.
---
Demogorgon has limited tracking due to their power, do you have any teachables or any other killers in general? I'm sure there's a way to make this a bit easier for you (in addition to playing survivor a bit).
---
You could see the moment when the survivor shat themselves
---
no killer past rank 19 complains about SWF lmao
---
he didn't like it?
---
For some killers it does (esp nurse, huntress, and clown to a lesser extent). For survivors, it's a mixed bag. KBM has a slightly better flashlight game, controller is better in chase because it is much easier to look behind you while running.
---
It really bothers me when people say with authority that KBM is better in every circumstance when that's just plain not true. I frequently hit rank 1 surv with controller on PC. You either have not actually tried both or you haven't given it any thought at all.
---
nah fam it still spawns on outside. at least on ormond it does that anyways
---
I will always treasure my spirit game where I had devour right next to a gen they finished. They thought it was haunted grounds.
---
its not the best one, thats for sure
---
Always at my favorite Map ;/
---
Wouldn't the fastest game possible be around 12/13 minutes if gens took like 5 minutes?
---
The first 3 popped in 5 minutes, then the next two popped in 5 minutes?
---
If I‚Äôm in a locker while I‚Äôm the obsession do I see the killer‚Äôs aura in the following situations:
---
- I‚Äôm the obsession because of OoO. In this situation, does the killer see my aura? I think it‚Äôs no for both cases but I‚Äôm not sure. 
---
- I‚Äôm the obsession because of Rancor, and the last gen was just made.
---
Depends what kind of people are in the swf group
---
Thanks for helping
---
With 4000hrs of experience in dbd having mostly survivor main friends who also play killer when soloing I can tell you they rarely agree with the suggestions of reddit and steam. 
---
My theory is that killer mains don't really make dbd friends bc their mode is 1 player, so they go on reddit and steam to socialize with other killer mains and thus the forums become more killer bias. 
---
I hope I see you in the fog, object of obsession has been a blast against ghost faces ;)
---
It‚Äôs not a beer gut. It‚Äôs a fuel tank for a sex machine.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/deofn2/freddy_before_the_rework/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Ok chill Mr Minecraft
---
on consoles she is the best killer
---
You realize MnK enables people to turn more sharply, right? A killer on a controller chasing a survivor on MnK is at a disadvantage for the sole fact that the survivor can turn at edges of a loop faster while the killer will do a wider turn because of the joystick, meaning the survivor gets more distance which in turn leads to the survivor being able to milk more runs around a loop then they normally would be able to.
---
There can be literally no arguement against this. The game is fun for killers when survs are obviously not communicating over comms but that isn't what most matches are actually like. It is completely absurd that bhvr continues to pretend their game is something that it's not.
---
I still want BHVR to explain to me why my character moans so loudly when she cleanses a totem. It can‚Äôt be down slightly less... quieter? Does cleansing a totem require a lot of physical strength? Bitch, if I saw a totem like that outside my house, I‚Äôd just stomp on it or, as a Jane, sit on it and break it. Why the fuck does it take me 12 seconds to pull apart a few bones lol. 
---
And yes, I‚Äôm aware they made it so killers could locate us, but it‚Äôs just stupid and makes no sense for my character to moan, as if she‚Äôs about to star in her first porn movie called ‚ÄúShhh. Mom is Asleep‚Äù and practices the sounds.
---
I don't care if I'm being compared to a child, but it is my best try to convince someone to experience what they are talking about. If you are going back to the points you made, you will see assumptions that don't necessarily have to be true and without which your arguments don't hold true.
---
Examples are (not limited to) the game's health not depending on balancing, the nurse being a balanced character, not a skill based one, insta-hatchets being rare (as a factor of balancing), leaving out survivors' higher mental workload because of the processing more information while in high stress situations (I know, sounds kinda technical, but I'm sure you'll understand)...
---
My point is that you seem to only see what you want to see. And noone has to balance a game to accommodate for that.
---
my question is where can i find the uncensored version
---
Backseat gamers
---
I'm sorry but pizza dick is better than frank?
---
It's a joke based on samination's animated dead by daylight parodys. The joke is nea is so ugly she is actually a killer
---
Looking forward to it
---
No, they usually are a young virgin girl, a little boy, or a couple.
---
Yeah but skill checks are a thing. When i started playing it was frustrating  holding a button for so long. Sadly the solution is to get used to it.
---
That's just not what Jason or LF would do imo
---
I don't think that I have seen the fiesta Claudette Pic before. I am Scared.
---
*reverse reverse*
---
If there is one thing I have learned, the killer will always run what is best. Pop has not lessened the use of ruin, they have stacked the two together. Often with dying light AND whatever that entity gen grabbing perk is called. Often on s tier killers. Most NURSES and SPIRITS use ruin and pop bc "I'm not good with them so I'm going to carry my win until I dont need them." 
---
Killers will just stack as much sweaty stuff as they can. It's just how it goes. The devs should manage the game around a shorter gen time than always trying to make the gens themselves longer bc....gens are boring. 
---
Shrinking the maps is a very effective solution imo.
---
yea 'cause flashlights are so Op right now.
---
Just throw a pallet on her and she just crumbles into dust
---
It's actually poor ghost face hidden around the corner trying to sneak up and the light goes through the wall blinding him
---
I still cant figure out how she fits in a locker
---
Even when you're right, I have to be the dick the that corrects you. Healing takes 20 seconds, not 16. Causing SC to take 40 seconds, not 32. In addition to the Mangled debuff (which's been pretty present since the Sloppy buff), SC takes even 48. I don't have to mention how long it takes if a Terror Build with Caulrophobia is involved aswell. Or stalling perks like Thanato and Dying. Something especially Doctors and Legions like to do.
---
Overall, when you want to heal yourself, there are much better options. Go for a Med-Kit and Botany or just for Pharmacy. Sure, SC doesn't have charges, but if you ain't dedicating to some weird Mettle Of Man + Empahty tank build, you most likely won't have to heal more often than 3 or 4 times at maximum in total anyway.
---
*it‚Äôd
---
Literally me and my gurl.
---
I just thought it made sense because they always chase the killers haha
---
How I wish I could read this
---
&gt;Spirit in general
---
Spirit in general isn't unbalanced. She's stronger than every other killer besides nurse, but no. She's not overpowered.  
---
What would make her overpowered? Every streamer, let it be a killer or survivor main, doesn't call her OP.  
---
Prayer Beads makes her really hard to deal with, though.
---
&gt; omegablink nurse
---
Agree.
---
&gt; extra blinks on nurse
---
Isn't overpowered. Players are able to deal with it/counterplay against it.
---
&gt; iridescent head. 
---
Isn't overpowered. Why would it be?
---
&gt; ebony moris 
---
Now this is an interesting one. 
---
Yes, ebony moris are OP if it's about getting 4Ks.  
---
But no, they aren't OP when it comes to making the killer win on higher ranks.  
---
Do you know why? 
---
If you're playing on red ranks mori's will almost allways make you depip or black pip at best.  
---
So even though you might end up killing 4 people and cutting the length of the game in half, you'll still "lose" as killer when it comes to pip progress.
---
&gt; I don't know what level of math you learned in school 
---
HaHaa
---
&gt; but these are more than 2 things and I even left some things out that are arguably unbalanced, these are the ones that you can't say are balanced. 
---
You're probably talking about NOED, Ruin, BBQ and similiar stuff yellow ranked survivors talk about when they think of "OP KILLER STUFF".
---
This is what people with 3-5k hours or commonly accepted youtubers/streamers with a lot of experience agree on:  
---
Omega Nurse is unfair for the survivors.  
---
Prayer Beads Spirit is unfair for the survivors.  
---
Ebony + Green Mori needs a rework, since it's too easy to kill people with, but it still will end up making you depip on red ranks.
---
All of the other stuff you mentioned about Billy, Huntress etc is probably stuff you and your mates aren't able to deal with, but every experienced player won't have an issue with it.
---
  
---
Do you know what needs fixing?  
---
Gens.  
---
They need to take more time to complete. But they also need to be more entertaining. Just the common skill check simulator is boring.
---
Survivors need more variety.  
---
Every survivor is just a reskin. They need to have some individuality. Killers have their movement speeds, terror radiuses and unique powers.  
---
Survivors have nothing. Give them something. Even if it's just a slight passive.  
---
Totem spawns.  
---
3 out of 5 totem spawns are still next to a gen, completely visable, next to survivor spawn points.
---
Pip system. 
---
You'll get 31,700 BP as a killer and black pip on red ranks. Next game you'll hit 12,450 and almost double pip. ?!  
---
Matchmaking system.  
---
I as rank 1 just faced 2 yellow ranks, 1 brown rank and 1 purple rank. That's not okay.  
---
Bandage fix for SWF mode until they work something out so it doesn't break the balance on higher ranks anymore.  
---
Those are the things we need.  
---
Your: "We survivor victims have it so much worse and it's actually the killers who don't get it" won't bring us anywhere.
---
&gt; which is exactly what spirit is, an rng killer. 
---
Oh so you were trolling the whole time. You got me good, dude.
---
Spirit Fury doesn‚Äôt work when you break something with your power. Or does it??
---
Who hurt you?
---
Makes sense, poor ghost face.
---
They also said the hard limit doesn‚Äôt apply to ranks 20-15 I believe
---

That joke doesn't work. 
---
Nea isn't the killer. She's the Entity. 
---
God get it right people
---
Old meme but gold meme
---
Pig is far from worst imo. And I haven't had anything so satisfying in this game as getting a "Game Over" kill with the party hats.
---
Doesn‚Äôt Rancor also show me the killer‚Äôs aura when the 5 gens are completed though? That‚Äôs what I meant! 
---
But either way my questions have been answered. No aura readings on either side while you‚Äôre in a locker! Thank you :)
---
If one of those addons is an insta-down or wallhacks so help me God...
---
Oh yeah, there's that too. Also all nea mains are predisposed to being toxic
---
Make nurse next also this is dope!
---
When you combine aih and plunderers instinct

you could do something like get a mouse with extra bindings and bind a button to toggle it.  could also probably be done with autohotkey.
---
Fucking awesome, this is horror shlock done perfectly!
---
Wait so, should the exit doors just open if I do that?
---
I need a real man like michael
---
Nah.
---
My bumper on my controller is dying and half the time it gives out while repairing which isn't a big deal, just press again. But then I try to do a totem and 20 minutes later I'm still randomly stopping and the Claudette in the bush is just watching me like "wtf?"
---
Sorry I misunderstood, glad you got your answers though. Good luck in future matches
---
Running DS and having a flashlight instantly equals you tbag at a pallet? Also aren't you supposed to use the flashlight at a pallet when you stun the killer? Some people are quick to assume things. (Myself included)
---
FUSION
---
Anybody have a good doctor build?
---
Yeah, I play killer and survivor. I just think it's funny how people automatically assume I was being toxic just because I decided for once to bring a flashlight when I obviously didn't use it that much.
---
I always split up when there's Ruin. Better to split pressure, and I don't have to worry about other people's skill checks.
---
When you play against killers who know what DS is, unbreakable becomes SSS+++ tier so try that.
---
And if you can avoid being a meme with it, urban evasion and spine chill will stop you from getting into chases in the first place so you stop getting shat on.

Thank you; to you too, friend :)
---
I love you because you didnt told us the truth.
---
the truth is: LF is thiccer than billy
---
Green ranks is the elo hell of dbd.  At those ranks you find a ton of people who dc. Once you get to purple/red ranks , i at least, rarely find people who dc. But get ready for the insta heals, ds etc. If you dont get mad about these and realise that both sides want to win, even in red ranks you'll have fun.
---
Yep saddly, but i got weird satisfied feeling with the ideam propably because i play a lot of Dungeons 3 and such heh.
---
Oh really? I didn't know that! Thanks!

Screw Pennywise, give us Captain Spaulding

WHAT ARE YOU? A SURVIVOR SANDWICH!

Am I blind or is there no Ghostface or Pig?

&gt; Healing takes 20 seconds, not 16. Causing SC to take 40 seconds, not 32
---
Where are you getting your healing numbers? [The wiki states that "Healing one Health State takes 16 seconds by default."](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Health_States#Healing) Was there a stealth update I wasn't aware of?
---
Oh, you have, yeah? Can you tell me which cosmetic I posted about then, smarty pants?
---
This just oozes cute energy, I love it! üíó
---
Why does this remind me of the Throwoverwatch shorts on YouTube?
---
Thanks for the comment
---
But since I have time, how about this? 
---
Concentration: Taking your time will save your life. The time to complete skill checks is reduced by 10/20/30%
---
It sounds great but I have a few problems
---
Nestling, Abagail's letter and Faded Sorority Letter
---
-Encourage Obsession Tunneling
---
Mousy Glasses and Bloody Glove
---
-Being invisible and hitting people is too powerful, if it kept her Stain then maybe
---
Slip and Slide
---
-Not useful and makes slow vaulting impossible
---
One Man's Trash
---
-Interesting, but a bit ridiculous
---
Desecration
---
-Nice, but not useful
---
Other than these I love this and though The Banshee wouldn't be a good killer she'd be very fun interesting and unique especially for her stealth
---
She got 1 nerf and suddenly the narrative is that every patch guts her. 
---
Jesus y'all are crybabies
---
I understand why people are assuming I was being that way because a lot of people do that sadly. I'm actually thinking of just not using DS anymore since it doesn't really help that often.
---
That fucking thing goes from 70% to 05 in 2 seconds
---
Well, the games would need to take a tad bit longer since all the teams would be some fraction more efficient on a much more consistent basis, but a lot of people don't like the idea of touching gen speeds which is why I think adding some requirements to getting gates opened in the form of other objectives is a good idea. 
---
I'm not on board with the 5th killer perk idea. I think a re-balancing of perks is a better idea, but it would involve more nerfs than buffs, most likely. I think the way to buff the killers the right way is to make sure they ALL have the same amount of map pressure comparable to Billy or the Demogorgon. 
---
A great example of this in a rework is Freddy and his ability to teleport to gens off cooldown. Just my opinion, maybe there's a lot of people who are up for the hex slot, idk.
---
*Disconnects*
---
Yeah he'll probably get a rework but don't let the game take over your life man.
---
Maybe you're just bad at the game...
---
Downside is 
---
a; less fun to be had (you didn‚Äôt kill them they quit)
---
B; less bp because you could potentially hook them thrice and hit them 6 times
---
C; possibility of dc for hatch (if there is 1 more gen done than the number of survivors left them the hatch spawns, sometimes people will tac-dc so that one or more of their allys can get hatch
---

Was there not time for the other door? Depending on how far, I feel like he could have totally made it if Leatherface stood at the gate.

The most helpful reply you could have made was not to reply.

Id like to see a killer that makes him weaker when survivors t bag near him or point at him for the memes
---
https://youtu.be/KjWLd5D5mqE
---
imo pants doesnt have more braincells.
---
Ok, but where since when did Ghostface turn into fucking spirit?
---
Are the eyes different colours?  Is it a black/white mesh?  Or are those your contacts?
---
This is really cool!
---
Spirit has a shredded body too
---
Does STBFL help with hitting survivors while carrying one?
---
Just to add to what everyone else has already said, Legion CAN see you when you're in a locker when they are in their frenzy.
---
Personally i think hag is mid a tier, but i agree with most of the others, maybe switching the order here or there, but still
---
Imagine critisizing people for puttion on a watermark
---
LOL! I mean, they could.
---
don't we have enough invisible killers?
---
&gt; Oh so you were trolling the whole time. You got me good, dude.
---
To reiterate my point, I'm not saying playing as spirit is like rng, because you actually have things you can react to: such as survivors scratch marks, and the sounds they make which is laughably easy to pick up on any decent headset.
---
Playing AS survivor against spirit though is a completely different story. You have to guess where she will go to try and "juke" her. There is no **reliable** counterplay to spirit, it's only a matter of luck and if she has functioning ears.
---
About your other points, I wasn't gonna try and argue that BBQ is op but there are some things that killers can do that are extremely unfun to go against. Such as: 3 gen doctor and freddy. Just put on 4 regression perks and patrol 3 generators the whole game until the survivors either dc or let you hook them for free just to get out of the match.
---
As someone who mains gf and has been since release i really dont get why he needs a whole new ability along with his regular one. Also i dont get what being invisible well in a chase helps with esp if u cant hit them etc. all in all idgi but maybe im reading it wrong and I‚Äôll end up eating my words...
---
Edit: also the survivors not losing there partial mark status when changing health states isnt fair imo say u stalk someone to 99 down em normally hook em then they get unhooked heal then insta downed right away that sounds really frustrating and unfun tbh.
---
inner strength is crazy and has saved my ass so much lately i actually enjoy playing survivor again because i dont have to worry about finding someone to heal me. dunno about its tier but its S++ for me.
---
Holy shit, that might actually work! That's actually a really good idea dude, well done!
---
Ruin, Play with your Food, Barbecue &amp; Chilli if you need Bloodpoints, and then your chosen flex perk - Franklin's Demise, Bamboozle, Discordance, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel, a carrying perk, whatever floats your boat.
---
Ruin gives you time to find the Obsession, you milk them for Play with your Food, and then you tear around the map at 130% using the saw to instadown people. The snowball potential is *unreal*, and there's nothing survivors can really do about it.
---
If you don't need Bloodpoints then just fill the gap with another flex perk. Discordance is popular because it makes it easier to find your Obsession (two people on a gen, 50% chance of finding your Obsession), Bamboozle means no vault is safe.
---
Basically it makes him like a Myers on crack. As soon as he gets the Play with your Food stacks then it's time to hide or it's your ass. Remember that the saw is a multi-hit attack - it'll disrepect Borrowed Time if they can't get out of range fast enough. It's pretty stressful to deal with, especially if you *never* hook the Obsession - it's a stack every time they try and bait you to chase them, and at 130% even the cockiest survivor is going to struggle to avoid you.

‚ÄúDid you guys load in? Nah I‚Äôm still in the lobby, k back out‚Äù

Please BHVR add a statistic that shows (Time spent in lobby) because the total (Play Time) is inaccurate AF
---
So that hex totems are borderline worthless, I always have someone spawn right on top of my ruin when I use it and I'm on the other side of the map
---
It?
---
Tommy!! What? no big hugs for your old buddy?
---
In my experience- yeah he be like that. Dude's got less and less chill these days and god forbid you call him out on his bullshit, then you're just a hater with a hate-boner and want to tear him down because he stands against toxicity. Dude's got a overinflated sense of self-importance and can't take criticism lol.
---
I guess! Would be cool though yeah
---
Thank you! Then what about the Demogorgon with its add-ons? IIRC there‚Äôs an add-on that lets the Demogorgon see injured survivors‚Äô auras, similar to what Legion sees when they‚Äôre in frenzy
---
Yep, I started last week. as a rank 20 killer I got matched up with like 3 rank 11's and at the end of the game after they all escaped they called me bad and told me to kill my self.
---
Encountered a few of those, as survivor too. it's why I usually hate games like these.
---
yeah just ignore them, that's the best you can do.  you're going to get negativity from this game 100% inevitably, best to learn to ignore it quickly.
---
Considering were gonna live forever doesn't do jack shit outside of the bloodpoints and is basically a wasted perk slot gameplay wise then I would say that yes a perk like bbq that gives double blood points ontop of a very useful in-game perk should at-least be separated into 2 different perks. The whole reason it's in every killers perks is that it it gives them a good ability + double bp, what reason is there not to always run it?
---
What a funny and original comment.
---
Demogorgon wouldn't hook people either so that whole statement doesn't stand in a player-controlled game.
---
It's just annoying to see people assume things based on what perks people are running. Like for using NOED for example.
---
Bubba has those dad bod arms tho
---
Seriously, she has three add-ons that are ok. Not good just ok. Tampered timer, Amanda's letter, and the 2nd rule set. And even then it seems the survivors find the right box first time almost always, it hurts
---
I don't think he knows that legion got reworked, because all his information is based on old legion.
---
report them too
---
It is pretty unfortunate. I got kinda lucky one night, me and my gf like to play on the weekends while drinking but we rotate killer. I‚Äôm a survivor main, so I suck at killer and she just has a hard time with the camera but for her first game, instead of anything toxic, she got a ‚ÄúGG‚Äù message. I replied saying ‚ÄúFirst game, so thanks!‚Äù, and they even replied with a GLHF, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The community caught me off guard that night and made her feel better about playing, so it‚Äôs become a weekly thing for us now.
---
Nothing drives me more crazier than someone using self care while I'm on a hook and getting put in struggle faze bc their only half way done healing...it's the most selfish peak in the game. No, I'm not gonna let two teammates heal me, I have self care bitch...lol
---
It's true though! LOL! Legion is horrible. He's good at running around stabbing people...that's about it. There are many other killers waaaaaaaaaay better than him!
---
Monitor, distressing, pop goes the weasel, and overcharge
---
I mean, i like the third seal, the confusion and discord it causes can sometimes net easy kills for me, although more often than not it gets cleansed before it's of any use
---
Lel imagine being rank 14 and acting like you‚Äôre not bad at the game
---
&gt;extremely unfun to go against
---
Yes, I agree with that. But that's just how it is while playing a PvP game.  
---
Both sides can do plentiful of things which are reaaaally unfun to go against.  
---
Killers can equip NOED, or even Ruin on lower ranks might destroy someones happyness.  
---
Killers can slug. Camp. Tunnel. Or just play some killers which are usually perceived as annoying like old Legion, Doc etc.  
---
Survivors can play in SWF. Use perks like DS, BT. Use lots of items. Flashlights. Keys. BNPs. Insta Heals.  
---
There are countless things both sides can do to kill the fun the enemy team is having.  
---
But that doesn't mean that those things are unbalanced, though.
---
&gt; Playing AS survivor against spirit though is a completely different story. You have to guess where she will go to try and "juke" her. There is no **reliable** counterplay to spirit, it's only a matter of luck and if she has functioning ears. 
---
I mean, somehow good survivors are still able to reliable counterplay against spirit, though.
---
Stop flashlighting at pallets. It's better to just leave as killers can hear where you go. Also it's super annoying as killer. Doesn't warrant a face camp but you're increasing your chance at it. Did he get a 4k?
---
I haven't played him enough to answer that I'm afraid! Hopefully someone else will know.
---
Lol rank 14 isn't even that super good either. That person should stfu.
---
I'm trying to be respectful and it's funny how people are downvoting and commenting because they can't get the "Killer was camping survivor because they were obviously toxic" idea out of their head just because I brought a flashlight and use DS.
---
Correction- it‚Äôs dard
---
Honestly, no offense taken, that‚Äôs your opinion and I respect that, and I won‚Äôt try and change it. Have a nice day.
---
Pop, Ruin, Dying Light, BBQ.
---
Yes, its just less of a stun on a successful hit, so as long as you actually hit them your stacks should still be in effect
---
Yeah, but that's not really the point of this game for licensed killers. 
---
Leatherface has his chainsaw like in the movies, Myers stalks like in the movies, Freddy has dream world like in the movies and etc. 
---
Ghostface isn't literally a ghost in the movies, it's just some horror fan teen that wants revenge for his mom, the power really doesn't fit. 
---
Yeah, the DBD Ghostface is an original character, but it doesn't fit given the lore. 
---
Stalk makes way more sense since in the movies, and this also applies to DBD Ghostface, they (every movie the Ghostface is different) watch their target's routine to calculate a good way to kill them.
---
I guess if you really want a rework (wich he doesn't need), you could buff crouch speed and gain a mori if you stalk someone long enough.
---
He does need a rework and is definitely one of the worst killers, but there are better things you could say dude, ‚ÄúlOl tRaSh KilLeR dOn‚ÄôT uSe‚Äù isn‚Äôt advice, you‚Äôre just making a joke and not really adding anything.
---
ancient meme at this point but hilarious nonetheless
---
Those are licensed
---
I didn't stay to watch. And the reason I did that was because he was breaking the pallets really fast and was constantly on my ass, I needed space.
---
I mean, you deserved that
---
Report them using the in-game tools. BHVR bans for racism, homophobia, and extreme bullying such as telling people to kill themselves.
---
It's unfortunate it happened to you, but people need to start reporting that behavior. BHVR keeps the chat logs for reports and something like that has a zero-tolerance policy.
---
Lmao damn, i read this whole thing. And he thinks legion is a 110 percent movement speed killer
---
I'm wearing a whiteout contact in one eye to show the wound laurie gave Myers in the first movie  the other is just shadowed out!
---
F
---
OHHH GOD NOOOOO. POLNAREFF
---
Yep. I don't deny that. Totally 100% deserved.
---
Oh yeah. Rule specifically says ‚Äúin the title.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to agree with you then, it‚Äôs a stupid hoop to make you jump through.
---
And in mint condition? Absolutely phenomenal.
---
I'll fucking do it again
---
&gt;‚ÄúlOl tRaSh KilLeR dOn‚ÄôT uSe‚Äù
---
That wasn't my quote at all. LOL! If he asked what killer he should run, my answer would have been different. He didn't. He asked "tips for Legion," and I feel I gave him the best one!
---
It's funny I find this discussion now because just yesterday I crunched some numbers trying to find out whether or not it's more efficient to selfcare next to someone doing a gen instead of them healing you.
---
Turns out if you only take into account the basic 16s of them healing you and the basic 32s of selfcaring (tier 3) with no survivor perks/items and killer perks/addons affecting it you save 1.7s.
---
If they heal you and then you do a gen together from start to finish it will take 60.4 seconds (gen speed with two people is 44.44s + healing one health state for 16s), whereas them doing the gen alone while you selfcare and you joining them after 32s will result in everything done after 58.7s.
---
Now mind you that is a very minor difference, one that becomes even less noticeable when you start introducing perks like Thanatophobia. Also you're right, it does use a perk slot but tbh I just use it because I don't want to be dependent on others. It's a team game, yes, but if push comes to shove and no one else is left I'd like to be able to heal myself.
---
There is the option of Nancy's perk (I apologize for my laziness, I don't want to look it up now) or a medkit but I hardly ever use items and if all totems are gone (especially with others using the perk) I'm back to square one being dependent on others.
---
Obviously all of this is very subjective and just my opinion ‚Äî but I thought I'd contribute with the numbers since I calculated it yesterday. :)
---
It does with billy and bubba, i dont see why not iridescent button
---
I read this thinking, "oh wow someone who knows how to play legion." Then i read what you said for save the best for last and realized you probably haven't touched legion since his rework
---
I disagree.
---
Is there a sub that is just janky ass comic book covers?
---
it's gotten to the point where I just straight up leave right after I escape. I don't even check how many BP's I got or if I gained ranks.
---
Treacherous*
---
it spawns outside on a few maps and will always spawn outside on those
---
I'm sure it's on Ormond and on both Crotus Prenn Asylum maps. Don't know if there are others
---
it used to be outside on all the maps tho
---
You have a lot of courage to say that on this sub lol
---
I honestly don't care. :)
---
Right I have posted in-depth notes but I‚Äôll summarise it here.
---
I am currently rank 2 killer and rank 4 surv on pc, and only rank 16 killer and rank 19 surv on switch. I can‚Äôt comment on how high rank switch is as I haven‚Äôt reached that yet, but in low ranks the game has atleast 1 dc I‚Äôve discovered. 
---
I‚Äôm playing killers I‚Äôm not the best with as when I‚Äôm playing killers I know how to play, I‚Äôm constantly sweeping the lobbies and that‚Äôs not something I find fun.
---
Lobbies will be easier in the low ranks especially, as it‚Äôs all people new to the game, either casual switch players or little kids who have got the game. That‚Äôs something you have to realise in low ranks.
---
If you set your switch MTU to 1500 instead of 1400 you have a pretty smooth network experience, better than pc as PC is still P2P and switch is dedicated servers.
---
The game is extremely fun on switch, and it‚Äôs nice to be able to play one of my favourite games if I‚Äôm not home. 
---
Hope this helps, if you have any questions feel free to ask and I‚Äôll try to answer them to best I can
---
Oh wow lol
---
you're right üòÖ missed a letter there
---
If you can draw I'd like to see what the characters would look like too
---
It used to be a bad perk but it got buffed so it's good now.

---
It‚Äôs okay mate, I just like my contractions.
---
&gt; I figured I was far enough to safely do that, given he‚Äôd given up chase at that point and I had enough time left 
---
You're lucky he wasn't a lag switcher.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt, iri button would only activate through ff, and would cancel out furtive chase
---
I mean how would you describe Ash? He is basically comedy horror, and hell even GhostFace is a more satirical take on horror and not just straight up "scary".
---
The most typical build is just the basic BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Some people swap Spirit Fury for another perk like Monitor &amp; Abuse so you have an easier time spotting Survivors at a distance, and less Terror Radius so you can get closer to chainsaw people before they notice you're nearby.
---
i do that to my friends all the time. lol
---
Brother committed suicide, had two friends commit suicide, nephew has tried several times to commit suicide. I'm sorry but if you're gonna brave the big bad world then you need to toughen up, people aren't going to be nice and they certainly aren't going to consider your feelings.
---
Yes it's shitty that someone will tell you to go kill yourself, but if you can't handle that then maybe you shouldn't be online, because there are going to be worse things.
---
Excuse you, Billy is very cute
---
No it was an og.  See my other post
---
Alright then what if he only walked at survivor speed while being a survivor. Also let the survivor aura show him as a survivor. The killer aura perks rarely activates except object of obsession, so that one shouldnt work.
---
"why is it toxic to just be better"
---
now you see the funny thing about that comment is that it sounds *really* toxic. (Not to mention you're complaining about the fact the killer you decked got upset.)
---
I hate you
---
I like how people say this and while it may be the ideal solution. For new people who suck a looping or dodging, doesn't seem so.
---
It does
---
In the sense that you recover faster then yes, *I believe so*, but the survivor's speed boost is going to trump your faster recovery *while carrying* so it's going to be moot either way.
---
I remember seeing some meme builds that were running carry perk(s) (primarily Iron Grasp, some with Agitation too) with Mad Grit and Save the Best for Last, not sure I'd recommend them for general use.
---
‚ÄúBlaaa blab blab blaaaamb‚Äù

I respect your opinion, but I‚Äôm not the one who cares about people telling me that; on the contrary, I‚Äôm emotionally stable and quite happy, but I‚Äôm also an advocate for mental health and it pains me to think that people just accept that saying that to someone is ok.

I'd imagine less than 10% of console owners use a LAN cable. Just because you use one doesn't mean that the killer is using one and until we get dedicated servers, the killer is the host. Peer to peer is already shit without throwing wifi connections into the mix. I've never seen as ping lower than 100ms on console.
---
I dont want competition? Lmao. Bring it on. There's a reason why nurse sucks on console, because killers are stuck at 15fps and a are playing on a controller. You don't even need to 360 killers on console, a quick 90 degree turn will do it. It's embarrassing. 
---
Try bringing that shit against PC players and you'll get destroyed by pc survivors.
---
Making this  game cross platform would be a mistake, even if I would enjoy clowning on some console killers.
---
I dont mind other perks - i am just so against other killer stunning perks after enduring nerfs
---
And the killer instinct would have the the terror raduis of fugitive or buttom ?
---
self care does waste time, and in regards to this meme, self care literally does the same exact thing you described in the 2nd panel, if you heal yourself, then you're cucking someone out of healing you for points and a daily.
---
stop wasting time using self care
---
I‚Äôm Asian and I like math, but I really don‚Äôt wanna feed into the stereotype.
---
If that bug helps the killer perform better then getting rid of that bug makes the killer worse performing.  It‚Äôs just a nerf with extra steps.
---
Oh, it's you! Your videos are great!
---
The M1 build was my goto for a while, but I haven't had great success at higher ranks with it. I've got a lot of different suggestions now, though, so I'll experiment.
---
 "I go and save her we both escape cause I **body blocked** freddy"
---
 "I save her then **body block** the freddy" 
---
Bruh that's kinda ^(toxic)
---
Sorry I don't speak wrong
---
Did....did you think people just get banned moments after being reported???
---
I agree.
---
Is any of that true? I think it would be good if it was, but I've never seen anyone get "silenced" or heard of anyone being banned for harassment reports.
---
Oh man I forgot about that part too
---
People who try no-mither usually use iron will because it's noisy
---
I totally forgot how loud it is with the vomiting, also there's that pink addon that she can run.
---
Good point
---
I guess that‚Äôs fair
---
I feel you man. Once somebody told ne he hoped my family would die of cancer and I actually did lose my mother to cancer and I know it never feels good, even when you know they're just salty.
---
Such a great cosmetic! LOL! Try thrift stores, that's all I can think of.
---
&gt;4 times in a row
---
&gt;moments
---
Pick one
---
Ghostface is their own original character. It‚Äôs just the mask that was licensed. So yes and no.
---
One you can have Sone fun with is Overcharge, Surveillance, plus the beam/distance addons. The addons create a sniper build for hitting people at a distance, the perks tell you when they‚Äôre on a gen, you blast them at gens. Could toss on Tinketer for added warning. 
---
I am a fan of Ninja Doc. Both Calm addons plus M&amp;A. In treatment mode you are everywhere, but in punishment you have no terror radius. So you sneak up on gens for jump scares. 
---
 It the classic asshole build is distressing, Unnerving, Lullaby and Overcharge. 
---
Personally I‚Äôd go Surge, Surveillance, Ruin and Pop. Swap pop for BBQ.
---
I don't see many Trappers myself so when I do play against him I often do forget he has traps initially and just end up walking into one.
---
Do we know when the halloween event is expected to come out?
---
People only mainly play Killer don‚Äôt see the struggle of playing with randoms, you get games like this and it‚Äôs really not fun. I usually duo with a friend, a lot of our matches the randoms have no idea what they are doing.
---
I can understand sometimes you get those games against full SWF who are really good and coordinated, but everybody acts as every SWF is Marth‚Äôs depip squad when most of the time it‚Äôs just friends wanting to play with each other.
---
i made a deafen hotkey specifically for dead teammates that dont know how to stfu in csgo, little did i know it would also be useful in dbd
---
I think years of running Hex: Ruin is starting to slow his brain down, and I quote, ‚ÄúJust a little bit‚Äù.
---
He pretty much proved your point with his respones lmao. Anyone that can't see this sub is heavily killer biased is blind, or biased themselves
---
I would but this was on PS4. :(
---
I accept my humanity, Julie!
---
Hype!
---
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. I hope you‚Äôre ok.
---
I made this post because last night someone sent me vulgar messages that no one loves me and I should kill myself. I brushed it off but my heart sank, thinking of how someone who felt alone might take that message. Sure, trash-talking will always be around but there comes a point where it just turns malicious and evil. I sympathize deeply with anyone who feels the need to say those things to others

---
Yup, my bad, confused some values, apparently a bit too tired.
---
For honor even has a ping system within its quick chat, though that might be too much
---
Does nurse‚Äôs calling reveal inner strength?
---
The night he came home.
---
I'd like to add that, according to the devs, when against Freddy you are always asleep. They called it "micro sleep" and fall deeper into sleep as it progresses. That's how they justify him always being able to hit survivors.
---
Nurse just got fucking yeeted by bhvr. Nice. I like all the changes.
---
Hyuk imma murderer
---
Yeah you are realllllll fun at parties
---
That‚Äôs actually a Lobster.
---
Yeah fucked that up pretty hard. I'm currently just struggling to sleep and a bit too tired haha. Excuse me please.
---
Making sure you have all generators to one side of the map is important anyways
---
what killers and survivors does it come with? are the others available as dlc? (I don't have a switch so I can't really tell)
---
If you listen closely, you can hear hundreds of Nurse mains cry out in horror.
---
I mean, have you ever heard of iridescent *air* before? Didn‚Äôt think so!
---
For real, though, it is weird that killers like Hillbilly and Nurse don‚Äôt have any.
---
I think 8v2 would be too much, a 2v6 would be better imo
---
Actually it is slightly faster to heal yourself and then join someone already on a gen instead of them having to heal you and then you two do the entire gen together.
---
At least without any other perks/items/addons affecting heal/gen speed.
---
To be fair, that girl had psychic powers.
---
You can purchase legion, myers, the pig, demegorgon, and the scream guy. It comes with all others except leatherface and Freddy. Those,2,cant be bought because of some current licensing issues
---
I would assume it's tied to the score check not so much the actual breaking of it so if you get points for breaking it I would assume that it counts
---
It WAS a horrible play, he chose not to take the easy route but that doesn‚Äôt make it a good play.
---
I think we can all appreciate her loose nip nip
---
I don't see the problem I mean they nerfed all her Additional blink add-ons so adding this balances it out
---
[My Reaction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GSMdgoWPY8)
---
These add on changes were waaaaaay overdue. Now all we need to do is alter prayer beads and iridescent head and we're all good on annoying ass add ons.
---
i know this meme is dead but..... 
---
felt cute might infect you later
---
I think its disgusting, I feel bad for children that pick this up.
---
so in other words self care is good if you don't take into all the other stuff that's better than it or makes it inferior, good to know.
---
I think it wants Drift King Billy with a black ward.
---
and his cousin the Crapper!!
---
As a slut for game lore, I am wildly excited for the Archives.
---
Yes this is an old clip. I meant to post it here awhile ago.
---
What's happening with medkits?
---
Speaking of which, is Overcharge + Surge actually a thing?
---
Scroll down, the article is fake
---
I'm a deaf player, so I don't hear people yelling at me. It's always felt peaceful to me until I learned about this now.
---
If one survivor cleanses and the other ones decide not to, then you are screwed. It's either full cleanse, or none at all.
---
Can't forget instaheals which are mega bullshit too and they said there would be a med kit update meaning it's possible all op add-ons get nerfed
---
Wow, would love to see a couple panels of how some of the characters were captured by the entity, could be quite cool
---
Shhhhhhhhh
---
Prepare for a massive boom in Spirit players
---
As a Nurse main with around 800 hours with her. Oh my god please no...
---
A mechanic that prevents her from using her power and forces her to be an M1 killer that moves slower than survivors? What the actual fuck?
---
Nurse never needed add ons but... These are either memes or just hand holding the player. Why would i use an add on to turn Nurse into an M1 killer?
---
Person like that probably takes everything as toxic.  They're the kind of person to face camp the first hook they get with no gens done then message people after the game blaming their camping on the "toxic gen rush."  Can't do anything with those people but laugh and move on.
---
Howdy
---
Hope helps you run the killer around better and it really destroys 110 speed killers along with the fact that its used instead of adrenaline the same reason people use dead hard instead of sprint burst to get a consistent speed boost that help when it needs to then a one of big boost that leaves you vunerable afterward
---
RIP 3 Blink Nurse
---
* "Me and other players reported him over 3 times in total. And it did not work "
---
* "4 times in a row"
---
pick one
---
(everyone saying the same as me anyways)
---
There are other things that could make it superior like you having self care and a medkit when the other survivor has none.
---
I simply said that because I only calculated the values for the basic speed and not every possible scenario.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why Clown isn‚Äôt S tier, at least. He is peak human sex appeal.
---
Yeah, the main point of self-care is just being able to heal in the first place. It's up to you whether you decide having that luxury is worth the perk slot.
---
No, it is a bug. The hillbilly aim BUG is a nerf now? No it isn't, stop crying about not exploiting anymore and propose an actual killer rework/buff.
---
then that means I would say in 2 weeks it may be released in live or since it is already close to October 31 it may come sooner than we think. looking forward to seeing the ptb and can finally see if you buy the pass with shards
---
&gt;#Ultra Rare 
---
&gt;##Torn Bookmark 
---
&gt;* Rarity changed from Common to Ultra Rare. Adds 1 blink charge. **The Nurse can no longer blink to locations not in her line of sight.**
---
kek
---
 Ope. My bet is last two weeks of this October, that‚Äôs what it was last year.
---
No, if we are going to have a survivor from that series of movies its going to be BRENDA.
---
This creeped me out,
---
&gt; Imagine crying about getting punished with a three (3) second cooldown when you miss your blink.
---
For each charge. Awful design. With her movement speed... With a killer that relies solely on the power...
---
Seriously. If I don't put Small Game into my build, I'll get a Hex Ruin that I can never find.
---
Been listening for 20 mins now. Can't get enough.
---
The point is to nerf the extra blinks. Extra blinks take away any skill requirement nurse has, by giving you up to 5 attempts to be accurate.
---
Keys are far worse than instaheals.
---
I'm a crap killer.
---
Love how most of the discussion is based on the title of this post more than anything.
---
[It's a joke guys.](https://youtu.be/1ZEbRgMr4vw?t=21)
---
The most obvious one.
---
I am rank 7 and have gone against multiple rank 18s, and I'm pretty sure they weren't swf
---
That‚Äôs a good way to look at it.  There‚Äôs nothing you can do about them quitting.  It‚Äôs usually an easy 3K if one DCs and you get a quitter bonus.
---
so the console nurse now became even more of a project to use?
---
i got her to level 40 to unlock nurse's calling.  And sure, after a handful of games i was ok with her.  When i run into a group of mediocre survivors, 3/5 times i win.  
---
if i run into a semi decent group, i get wrecked.  MAYBE get 2 hooks total.   
---
i have no issues with them changing add ons.   but now we have to wait for blinks to come back?  i imagine that'll get tweaked in the ptb
---
This will be her only extra blink add on now, the baffling part is adding the LOS blocker making it more of a hindrance

New matchmaking has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below you.

Well RIP Nurse.
---
Excited for Archives tho
---
Oh boy, the reactions to this will be interesting. I don‚Äôt play Nurse and play on console so never really see her, so I‚Äôm just gonna wait and see what the feedback is once the PTB goes live. 
---
Give me those medkit change details though! If they nerf Nurse AND nerf insta heals in the same update I‚Äôm gonna enjoy seeing the salt from both sides.
---
Can't deny he isn't a leader although we seen him be very grisly to his own group
---
Damn so I‚Äôve just been really unlucky?
---
I play killer, and I‚Äôm looking for some variety in gameplay. I‚Äôve played as Plague, Ghostface, Nurse, Hag, Doctor, and Spirit to the point where I can consistently get good games with them. I have (almost) all of their teachable, too. Which killer should I try to level up next? I‚Äôm looking for something challenging but rewarding.
---
Literally nobody uses keys.
---
I'll try to power through if there's all 4 of us, but otherwise me too.
---
I thought he was tortured by his parents into that form?
---
Nope he was born like that and that‚Äôs why his parents locked him away and abused him
---
Pennywise fucking plz
---
This shit has been happening so much for me too!!!!! FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Dude no one feels it worse than I do... I mained her in red ranks for months after the release. She was never great, and the games were always so fucking hard, but I managed. She was playable. The nerfs really make her terrible... And please then, name one killer worse.
---
SWF. 
---
Saving someone feels great.
---
Seeing as she only has one extra blink add on and considering it's an ultra rare having this negative seems like a massive waste
---
Together, we can be one whole crap of the two halves
---
Interesting as fuck actually, TIL about foam latex masks that drag queens apparently use, I‚Äôm actually really glad to hear that the mask was made, it kinda goes with the creation of the original mask, in that it was a plain mask that was painted and cut up to create the Michael mask
---
Literally at the exit gate ready to leave. I love this game, but more then not, I get this disconnect bug.
---
If you have troubles catching survivors on shelter woods you should definitely consider quitting the killer role
---
So you actually think people aren't going to be playing Nurse now that they finally shit on her dumbass multiblink/omegablink addons? Most good ones played without.
---
Currently you can get them for Freddy, Myers, Leatherface and Pig. We used to have them for Doc and Hag as well but they were discontinued. 
---
They are as rare as any other ultra rare item. 
---
Once you buy the respective DLC, you stop getting these offerings. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Offerings#Splinters
---
I saw 6 yesterday in 7 games. They're incredibly common and easily found in chest. At least on PC.
---
oh boy you don't know how wrong you are
---
I mean, she found the survivor
---
Yes I agree.
---
They're kinda rare but not super rare. You can also get them for bubba, pig and freddy. Bear in mind if you use it you won't have any perks or add ons in play
---
My hopes for instaheal nerfs
---
Please at least share the link to the OP
---
Nah, addon that makes it so billy doesn‚Äôt stop if he hits a survivor w chainsaw. 
---
And leatherface could gain like 5 or 7% speed at all times but be unable to M1.
---
not at any decent level of play. The timer shouldnt ever start until theyve checked a few boxes. Like ever. The lack of a way for piggy to start the timer is so bad
---
&gt;Damn so I‚Äôve just been really unlucky?
---
You said 3 or 4 ranks better than you, it goes all the way to 6. You have been lucky.
---
ahhh damn
---
**Similar Poster** [**Got Here!**](https://clickhereifyouneed.auction/Dead-By)
---
I think there are offerings to try out Myers and Pig. I'm sure of those 2, but not sure if there are others. They are pretty rare, from my understanding. I have never had any pop up in my Bloodwebs, but own both of those killers, so that may be why. Hope you get a better answer!
---
PERSONA
---
This is amazing 15/10!!
---
I think I love you man
---
Looks fine to me? According to the new matchmaking of up to 6 ranks above you. 
---
Unless you are actually complimenting it when you say "nice".
---
Damn ok
---
You can‚Äôt? Someone needs to tell the fine people of eBay and Etsy!
---
I‚Äôm sorry
---
I meant that I‚Äôm rank 10 and they all have been around 6 or 7 with a few being red ranks.
---
More so rank 20‚Äôs but I‚Äôm rank 8 and I still don‚Äôt know how to track that well!
---
This is impressive, make more pls.
---
I think you're a veteran of the game and dealing with BHVR's habits, so I'll take your words as likely wisdom.
---
That said, try to understand that I already dont have full faith in the company to act fast, effeciently, or even correctly when it comes to stuff like this, which is why I want to create discussions like this, to put pressure on the devs to act.
---
I get it seems like a small and weak act, but its the best I can do, and Id rather do something than throw up my hands and just be happy with the unbalanced mess that we have, because I love the core game, and want it to succeed long term.
---
Give your life for the glory of Rome, heathen!
---
Well you still killed them ^-^
---
&gt;I meant that I‚Äôm rank 10 and they all have been around 6 or 7 with a few being red ranks.
---
Rank 10 killer can go against rank 16 or rank 4 survivors according to the new matchmaking and it would still be considered balanced.
---
*laughs in P3 ghostface*
---
What does it mean when someone is on a hook, sees another survivor coming to save them, and says "Don't farm me" or "You better not be farming me"? I usually see this happen with streamers who first want someone to save them, then get annoyed when it happens.
---
I really hope they'll nerf spirit and billy too and then buff all weak/mid tier killers
---
I don‚Äôt get it. You got a 4K with nearly perfect bloodpoints.
---
Got this mid blink playing nurse earlier rip
---
I know if I miss a skill check and the other person stays, I do too. If the killer comes, I try and get the killer to chase me. Unless, of course they fail one too, then it‚Äôs every man for themselves.
---
Rule 549 the trapper cannot put trap on the gate. Because its unbalanced and unfair.
---
Buff Wraith, pig, doctor, clown, trapper and pig
---
what‚Äôs that font called?
---
its still 3 attempt. 3rd one was canceled. but he have deliverence tho. why not success on 1st one
---
Is this Meg doing her make-up, or did you mean "pallet?"
---
It looks nice to me
---
It's all personal preference but out of the killers you haven't played, Huntress would fit the "challenging but rewarding" description pretty well. She has possibly the highest skill ceiling in the game so there's always room to improve. HOWEVER her perks are perhaps the weakest out of all of the killers. The Cannibal would be a good pick for perks as BBQ and Franklin's Demise are both pretty useful on any killer.
---
Keys are the survivor equivalent of moris, I really hope that both get removed, changed or nerfed.
---
Is anyone else irritated that he has his switch on top of his PS4
---
Some of these add ons seem really fun to play with, but especially the ultra rare ones are absolute garbage. They're nerfing the Nurse on top of that as well, not a big fan of this change to be honest
---
We don‚Äôt give 2 fucks about the add ons we don‚Äôt run them anyways we care about the base change that fucks her map pressure and chase potential.
---
Nurse is broken strong, and after this change will absolutely still be top tier. It‚Äôs not like this is another pig nerf.
---
it's when you unhook someone at a bad time, like when the killer is chasing you, just so you can get the unhook points
---
I had no idea it was an acronym. That makes sense now
---
Thank god that it died, that shit had no counterplay
---
ok
---
Clown too. Clown actually tears it up on the new map
---
Props to you then
---
the point is you have 1 more blink. but you cannot blink that was not in your line of sight.
---
Farming is when the hook is being camped by the killer or the person coming to save them is being chased by the killer and you get unhooked by them without borrowed time. Basically theyre not actually saving you, theyre just trying to get easy points since you or them are going to go down instantly
---
I don't blame you. After what Bustah Rhymes did to Micheal... Lol he whooped his ass twice man. Then literally and figuratively roasted him. "Looking extra CRISPY Mickey!" I guess that's what happens when you put someone in a movie that has a net worth large enough to dwarf its budget.
---
Shouldnt it be nea and nurse? D: not to be that guy but they came out at the same time
---
I had a lot of fun making last weeks video so I thought I would go again.
---
‚ÄúFarming‚Äù for BP (Bloodpoints) if you‚Äôre a survivor you get bloodpoints when you unhook another survivor. Unhooking survivors also goes to your endgame stats that determines whether you de-pip, Black pip, or pip. However some people don‚Äôt give a damn about whether you survive or not, they just want their BP so they‚Äôll unhook you even if the killer is nearby just to get the extra BP. ‚ÄúYou better not be farming me‚Äù means unless you have borrowed time or gonna take a hit for me, DONT unhook me while the killer is nearby knowing they‚Äôre going to come back and down me again
---
Rip? You can just not run addons and still do just fine. Or run the addon that makes people louder after hitting and they‚Äôre screwed. Stridor as an addon omegalol.
---
Potentially good but his add ons are too weak or don't do enough and although shred can be useful its not very effective since it's too easy to dodge and you can't turn while lunging and it doesn't benefit from FD.
---
Then your skill level is capped and you need to get better lol, red ranks suck anyways
---
Watch out for ants tho they be in the bricks
---
Tru3 gonna be pissed
---
It takes time to remove people from a game. It's not an instant "oh, this guy has multiple reports, guess we'll ban him" they have to assess the reports to make sure they aren't false first before they take any action.
---
I don't think I've seen a red rank nurse play without any addons since like 2017. Maybe zubatlel but that's literally it.
---
Hadn‚Äôt seen the changes and thought they were gonna BHVR it
---
Maybe his teammate did something that got him killed. The only time I work with the killer is when my teammates proposly get me killed
---
Viable? Plenty of killers are viable. Now there‚Äôs only one (pretty much) unbeatable killer
---
pretty damn cool. firecracker powah!
---
Hol up
---
Ok, I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre being so rude, this isn‚Äôt some virtue-signaling bullshit, it‚Äôs something I take very seriously; but just to clarify: My undergrad was in psychology/mental health and my current job title is Advocate.
---
I‚Äôm literally an advocate for mental health.
---
How are you saying old meme if surge came out recently
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
Oh for sure! I tried to document the process as much as possible on my IG (knifeygram) but some pictures slipped my mind as I was doing them! But it's a really rewarding feeling to take risks and create your own OOAK mask essentially from scratch!
---
Since everyone else already answered as to what farming is, I'll just point out that the only time you should unhook another survivor in front of the killer is if A) you have the perk borrowed time, which, when you unhook a survivor while within the killer's terror radius makes any hit that would've downed them within the next 15 seconds instead apply deep wound, or B) if they are about to go to phase 2/die on the hook, because in that case, if you don't save them in the next second or two, they're going to die, and if they're about to be phase 2, if they go down again, and get hooked, it really makes no difference.
---
Spirit is beatable you need to adept and learn how to juke double back and use Windows. I‚Äôll give you that pearl beads are bullshit and need to be nerfed hard.
---
Granted, it could have been better but I appreciate any and all Doctor memes
---
Why not just go with the demogorgon? Pretty challenging but it‚Äôs always a fun game for both the killer and the survivors whenever it‚Äôs the demogorgon!
---
 Imagine getting so annoyed over one part of a meme
---
What‚Äôs the nurse change?
---
so rarely . im so jealous when i found a clip that survivor spawn on a lit totem.
---
‚ÄúPools closed due to aids‚Äù is an old 4chan meme legend
---
Flair checks out
---
And to add to that, mending does not count as a healing action, so if you're playing legion/if someone has borrowed time and they have to mend, nurses won't show that.
---
You don't play killer at rank 1.
---
Maybe not unbeatable. But you know what I‚Äôm saying
---
&gt;ü¶Ä NURSE ü¶Ä
---
&gt;ü¶Ä IS GONE ü¶Ä
---
Holy shit I'm happy that Nurse is finally no longer the "I win by default" Killer but wow these nerfs are so heavy-handed it [costs 2 mana and overloads you by 3.](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Crushing_Hand)
---
Ironically the one change that I was scared of (Plaid Flannel being baseline) is going to make Nurse a lot stronger, but not so much because the addon is overpowered but rather because every other option is pretty much worthless. Excluding the reduced fatigue time and increased blink recharge addons:
---
* **White Nit Comb** and **Dull Bracelet** are farming addons
---
* **Metal Spoon** is actually not that bad for a brown addon. Stridor was already pretty good on Nurse so Stridor as an addon isn't terrible ngl. This does have the same problem that Wraith's Bloodhound addon has though in the sense that "why does a Killer's addon have the same effect as one of their perks?" Likewise something to question in regards to **Bad Man's Keepsake**, which is basically A Nurse's Calling on a stick.
---
* **Anxious Gasp** is a meme.
---
* **Spasmodic Breath**... why? This addon is literally a downgrade 95% of the time. Why would you want to remove your power and become a default Killer? 10/10 meme cause now Bamboozle Nurse can be a genuine thing.
---
* **"Bad Man's" Last Breath** is vaguely interesting. Might have some niche uses particularly with Spasmodic Breath. I'm interested to see what Killers do with this.
---
* **Campbell's Last Breath** is a downgrade 95% of the time since it'll fuck with your muscle memory.
---
* **Jenner's Last Breath** is ~~Tracer from Overwatch~~ a meme.
---
* **Matchbox** is pointless. Why would you want to be Mirror Myers with 1 Nurse blink?
---
* **Torn Bookmark**... hm yes let me remove half my power just for one extra blink.
---
This change is a "rework" in the same sense that the Legion "rework" was a rework. IE it's a hard nerf and Behaviour is only fooling themselves by calling it a rework. I don't even play Nurse but pretty much yeeting the Killer out of the game was not the way to handle her. Now instead of having 3 viable Killers at high ranks we'll have 2. Nurse already wasn't played much at high ranks because she's more mechanically challenging than Billy and Spirit, so now we can have more no-skill Billies and Spirits at red ranks. Yaaaaay.
---
I'll wait to see how Nurse does on PTB but so far she looks impressively worse. Like it's actually impressive how bad they managed to make one of the best Killers in the game.
---
Guess Sally can hang out with Frank and Co and go to Overnerfed Anonymous with them. They can go out for drinks with Amanda afterwards!
---
Perhaps they need more evidence then. I'm not in the gaming industry, but I have worked for companies which take reports against other users. It's possible that if you don't have video and only you and your friends are reporting them, that may not necessarily be enough to ban or take action against someone. It's why people get independent witnesses for car accidents. I don't want a group of people falsely reporting me for cheating (which has happened, btw), and then getting suspended for it when I didn't do anything wrong. Even if this person did do something wrong, where's the proof?

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/
---
The leaks suggest Oct. 9th or 10th, but there's no official date yet.
---
Damn! Thank you for the info!
---
I read the dev update for the Oct 8th PTB...
---
I play majority of Survivor, I'm in red ranks most season.. As Killer, i'm about green ranks. Can't make it any higher.
---
And the ONLY THING... THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDED TO BE NERFED WAS *OMEGA BLINK*
---
That's all i'm gonna say. I don't want to play against Spirit all the time. I can't play Spirit due to hearing loss in my right ear.
---
Now I don't want to play Nurse.
---
I miss being a noob too. Now I'm just overwhelmingly average. One day I'll get better though!
---
Not really, you still have to make a mistake to get mori'd. Keys just negate any mistakes you make like 3 genning yourself. Moris are strong, but I don't know how to make them weaker without making them worthless.
---
No, but i play survivor. More than 2 killers can get the job done
---
No, it must be something good and extra special made just for me, like a new  Mario skin for the trapper. /s
---
But blinks now have a 3 second recharge. So to blink and hit you have to blink all the way around and hope you don't miss or you have to wait 9 seconds before you are recharged to try again. It makes having the 3rd blink worse since you have to go around instead of through.
---
idk i feel like a purple rank killer shouldn't be matched against 4 red rank survivors... it was pretty rough.
---
She has an addon that‚Äôs a free Stridor, a free Nurses Calling and Infectious Fright for passing through them?! I‚Äôm back to being a nurse main! Spirit, Legion, Freddy, take a seat, mama needs to get the nurse back out.
---
Kewl just kewl...
---
I do and I play every killer as well but plz continue
---
Bro I‚Äôm a console nurse, you can‚Äôt do this to me
---
I wish i had money...
---
To add to all the answers here, technically you can have an obsession in the game without anyone using obsession perks because of the new key addon that reveals the obesession's aura.
---
Professionals have *STANDARDS*
---
Now this is an add-on worth running
---
No. That‚Äôs not how it works. The killer itself is not licensed, but the outfit of the killer isn‚Äôt. The killer itself was made by BHVR, while the mask was not.
---
For every Nurse crying, there are 4 survivors celebrating. In the end, DBD / BHVR wins. We'll have to wait for the actual gameplay to see how strong this nerf is but definitely necessary.
---
God same. Extra backstory makes me as happy as a pig in slop.
---
They are but that's a whole item not just add-ons meaning it would require more time to balance them
---
Now it's time for Nurse to be crippled
---
I mean, I would have preferred they nerfed her to D-tier and left her there for a year, but I'll take it.
---
Or just buff weak and mid tier killers and don't touch spirit herself, just mother daughter's ring and the amulet. She's fine as is but those two addons. Billy is just... why would you want to nerf him? He makes noise accross the map whenever he uses his power and yeah he can one shot but if you arent a dumbass and dont move in a straight line he wont do much. Its like saying LF is OP because of the chainsaw, doesn't make him OP. If you got downed its because you fucked up and you deserve to respect their strength
---
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, I‚Äôve lost family to cancer as well. I hope you‚Äôre ok
---
I generally try to be a rational person when talking about balance (and hell, I'll do it here: the add-ons are creative) when it comes to this game but...
---
Fuck you for the base nurse change BHVR.
---
Fuck you.
---
Meh, reddit money is pointless anyway
---
√óMe looking at the vast meme addons the nurse is getting: "well maybe her ultra rares will be good."
---
√ósees the ultra rares literally just nerf her even more
---
I feel you man i hope u are better now, I hope u have a good life u and your family
---
Freddy chose to be evil
---
YES! YES!!!!
---
ALL THE SALT THAT FLOATING POTATO SACK HAS MADE ME AND SURVIVOR-KIND FEEL OVER THE YEARS IS FINALLY BEING RETURNED TO SENDER
---
SUCK IT NURSES MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
---
The original freddy wasnt a pedo in the actual movie release by that logic then, he was supposed to be and then they changed it child murder. Hes only a molester in the reboot
---
Edit: also the Original Halloween, Loomis calls him pure evil as well
---
What if you already got every survivor adept? what do?
---
Bruh moment
---
Same dude , hope u are ok too
---
They killed her, The end. Her addons were fair but they shouldnt have touched her base kit.
---
I mean yeah but he doesn't know how to use a karambit properly for the life of him
---
Me leaving the area after hooking someone.
---
Survivor randomly runs right into me.

Because Nea is the human embodiment of the Entity

I'm rude because you're virtue signalling, I've no doubt you felt that much better after you typed that, but it does nothing, it helps no one, it's just another don't say this because you could hurt someone rather than actually reaching out to someone struggling in this community.
---
I choose not to reach out here, although I would talk through whatever I could if I saw someone struggling, but I reach out in other places. How about you actually advocate mental health as opposed to just going through the motions.
---
mmmm yes I can't read whatever the fuck is written because its in red on white/black with a shit font but I'll assume its matchmaking 
---
so haha matchamking bad upvote
---
A fast nurse dear god
---
Love it!!
---
Just Micheal things.
---
Did I miss something where she's no longer able to blink through walls and ignore pallets and other forms of defense?
---
My stridor is ready as well
---
What &gt;:c
---
Tell that to BHVR, you can‚Äôt buy him with shards. Licensed characters cannot be bought with shards.
---
Depending on how it's implemented she will either be mid-tier or bottom tier after this.
---
If it recharges during the fatigue, she's mid tier. If not she's bottom tier. The fatigue timer after two blinks and a swing is 3 seconds, if it only starts recharging after that then that's enough time for a survivor to be well over 20 meters away (even without the speed burst of being hit it would be enough). Meaning the nurse would have no way of catching up to a survivor after a two blink hit.
---
Possibly, but man he took a weak pallet right in the mask. Bad move.
---
I think that was most likely due to a lot of killers leaving their lobbies because they didn't want to play with ping
---
Delete your whole reddit account please

You ever play against a good billy, or a scratched mirror myers? How about a huntress whos had a lot of practice? Obviously spirit and nurse are a lot better, but if youre telling me that some killers other than those 2 cant have a great game, you‚Äôve been playing a different game than i have
---
Ash being adorable dweebs, they're like Dwights 2.0 but instead of hiding in lockers they somehow manage to corner themselves against Billys or Leatherfaces
---
Im not exagurating  , its literally unplayable for me , if i had a way to Show u i would .. im honestly not getting more than 20 fps no Matter where i am on any map its actually worse when im in a chase as Killer and i swing  .. then it drops to almost approximately 10 FPS  the game is almost freezing at these times
---
The first and third panel of this meme have always bothered me.  
---
What kind of punk *doesn't* rebel? It's the entire fucking point of being punk. Fucking posers, man.  
---
And what kind of person dyes their hair crazy colours and is still able to convince themselves they're not an attention whore? How can someone be that good at lying to themselves?  
---
Also, I'm Adam so I must have Deliverance.
---
For higher rank Leatherface isn't the best choice for Killer, but with your best addons, decent maps, and subpar Survivors (or at least ones that are messing around instead of going hard) you'll probably be able to get some wins. 
---
Honestly your perk choices aren't going to mean all that much, you'll have to get intimately familiar with your Chainsaw charge speeds with your preferred addons, and when you will and won't be able to land chainsaws. High rank LF is a lot more about game knowledge and luck than he is about perks. Like, lots of luck.
---
Also, glad you enjoy the videos :)
---
Or they've come back after being away from the way and you're just collateral damage
---
Are you playing docked? Docked makes the game run much worse.
---
With huntress, if you use sloppy butcher and some add on like venomous concoction, will they be receive both debuffs? Similar question if you use two add ons like venomous concoction and Yew Seed Concoction?
---
CoMe On LaDy DoN't YoU wAnT pOrKiNg
---
She's still going to remain the most powerful killer in game simply because she ignores mechanics. Do you not play on PC or
---
Nope just sick of virtue signalling from people, do something or do nothing, don't just use empty words. 
---
BTW I chat with men going through tough times trying to give them a person to talk to so they don't feel alone. I don't post stuff like this because it does nothing but make the person who posted it feel and look better.
---
One of the only killers where you‚Äôve heard her scream in pain.
---
No, he doesn‚Äôt share the same lore. He legally cannot because they did not obtain the rights to the Scream franchise. Only the mask. That was my whole point. Also, last time I checked, all the Ghostfaces had motives that related to some sort or person, like Sydney or the protagonists of the TV show. Danny Johnson kills because he likes it, and only does it for his sick entertainment and to scare people. BHVR made their own UNIQUE character based on a mask which has, in the past, been used in a well-known slasher series. Danny just so happens to be wearing a mask.
---
Don't be too obvious with it. You can easily mindgame survivors because of how easy Shred is to cancel.
---
Object of obsession, babysitter, kindred, being downed or hooked, aftercare, better together, all show all of the survivors. He would have to shapeshift while extremely close to generators. Try playing survivor and walking everywhere instead of running, that‚Äôs basically what it would feel like to play as him.
---
What kind of advice or suggestions are you looking for?
---
I think it looks awesome. You got a lot of the details of the character, from her cut up limbs to the spooky eyeliner falling down her face, and the details on the uniform.
---
Now that you've finished this one, what else inspires you? Maybe you could draw her doing an action, or interacting with another character, or in a more detailed location.
---
Or you could try practicing how to make her hair and clothes look more flowy, while making the sharp objects more jagged. Or maybe shading?
---
In any case, keep it up!
---
I've been stuck around rank 8 as a survivor the past couple days.  As soon as I rank up, i inevitably get in 4 consecutive matches with face camping tunnelers, usually against a green rank killer.
---
Today I even had the pleasure of playing against a nurse with ruin, noed, and an ebony mori.  Dude literally said after the match that he was trying to be the most toxic nurse possible.
---
Yes, they will receive all of the debuffs. You can't stack things like Mangled however, it's a boolean. They either are or they are not Mangled.
---
So apparently BHVR's answer to Nurse and Spirit being the only consistently viable killers at red ranks is not to buff the other killers, but to nerf them into the ground. Because mark my words, Spirit will be next.
---
All you had to do was get rid of the Nurses broken add-ons, but you still managed to somehow fuck even that up. GG BHVR.
---
I don‚Äôt want to culturally appropriate but I think this is some weird Asian porn
---
My favorite thing about reddit is people deciding that things are garbage before ever playing or seeing them once, lmao. 
---
They sound plenty strong to me, but weaker than omegablink/5 blink, which is the point.
---
There are a few nice ones, too.   
---
All Jeff mains are Fat jesus, and 98% of the time are super chill players.   
---
Adam WILL use deliverance OR worships the pebble.
---
Pig is certainly not the worst, although I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs low c tier at best. Her traps still work as a slow down, her stealth is nice, and her ambush works at loops if the survivor is trapped there or bad. imo she‚Äôs still better than wraith, clown, bubba, and legion. You can still play her at higher ranks, you just need to always run ruin, bbq, and endurafury.
---
All good bro
---
This is some real good stuff, please make more
---
That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs still a licensed killer, since his mask required the license. I‚Äôm saying the character itself, with or without the mask, is original.
---
Im mostly playing handheld but Theres not really that Big of a difference for me . Docked is worse , yes  , but the Problems i stated  are in handheld  as well
---
the new 2018 film retconed all other movies bar the first - to be fair - the whole 'cult of thorn' stuff was all over the show
---
The slow down made me laugh incredibly hard
---
True but they know they're playing against weak opponents so you could at least not use the insane add-ons, I get you can't derank a perk but you could also use weaker, more quirkier/fun builds.
---
and if you do do this you shouldn't make fun of the killer in end game chat for being new.
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs got the spirit
---
If you only edit .png files you are 100% safe, just dont muck with the Unreal Engine files that contain models and textures.

Hey buddy, look at me

*Izanami*
---
Looks like Trapper's superior posterior is raking in the viewers.
---
If someday I find your friend ill give him the hatch, like anyother baby survivors, maybe the dont do anything in the whole match, but they have to learn and in a happy/fun way , so idc loosing 3k bloodpointa for a happy baby survivors that escapes and its greetfull
---
Oh, and I almost forgot! Meg, Claudette, Dwight, and Jake have outfits based on licensed characters from the Left 4 Dead games. Does that mean they‚Äôre licensed to Valve? No. It doesn‚Äôt.
---
The misunderstanding is cleared and that's all that matters, I don't care about the people that downvoted, as long as people are getting correct information.
---
You got to do what you got to do for those bloodpoints
---
I appreciate it, I‚Äôm doing very well, thank you.
---
I've got spine chill on my load out, but maybe that perk they let's you recover dully could help (can't remember name) lol.
---
Then what would be the point of doing it? That'd just be a waste of development time
---
Probably.
---
I have literally always thought this like it makes sense for the totem to make crackling noises but whyyy do the survivors gotta be like üò©üò©üò©

No to be fair spirit and nurse were fairly equally matched. Spirit will for sure take the number 1 spot now. Nurse will probably get over taken by freddie too
---
You guys are actually hopeless if you think she's suddenly F tier because she gets a slap on the wrist now.
---
Same! When I play against Ghost Face, this is how they play. And as a Ghost Face main, I can see why they would do that. Stalking with is a difficult skill. Most of the time I stalk to 99% and let them go because I know I will lose my stealth mode. My favorite part is when I stalk 99% then come back and they think they are safe, then I follow them and when really close I turn stealth mode and stalk and down then. It‚Äôs fun.

And Call of Duty black ops 4 | zombies

I don't even get why The Plague and Spirit are killers it makes no sense!
---
True true except there‚Äôs 2 doors
---
Right lol. It makes no sense.
---
These changes are a longtime coming for the state of the game and I'm more than happy with the changes. Nurse fundamentally remains unchanged and will be punished for missing chain-blinks. She's still strong as ever but it means you have a chance to get away if you manage to juke her. Good nurse players will still go on about their 4k's every game, but as survivor you stand more of a chance in chase. 
---
I'm super excited for the datamined cosmetics coming tomorrow as well!
---
meta add-on right here
---
There's Hillbilly and spirit yet, but I'm pretty sure they'll nerf them too, just like they killed Legion for good.
---
Oh, I forgot to mention poor Bubba too. He was actually the first killer I got to level 40. Anyway, I think I‚Äôll give Huntress another shot. I‚Äôve played her a few times recently, and doing so is starting to convince me that I am a masochist just because of how rough it is. Do you have any tips for playing Huntress?
---
Second wind is his best perk, delete
---
As someone who normally doesn't play as Billybob, I thought this was a great run.
---
Holy fucking eyesore what is this
---
Yea I know, but what I mean is that if it didnt have a downside it would still be a bullshit addon with very little counterplay. Now they made it an interesting perk that changes the playstyle a bit. A lot of her other new ones are the same way which is awesome. Perks should change playstyle more often, instead of minor passive buffs.
---
Honestly I hope that they don‚Äôt remove the collision. Everything else is fine, but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense why she would walk through survivors and not walls.
---
Only letting the user out would be nice for a start. Still hate it, but it'd be more bearable.
---
About time they did something with nurse, While she was tagged as a "hard" character but this is only the case for using her with no addons. I've played a few nurses on Console that I couldn't dodge in most situations because of her multi blink attack and it's stupid. I do think they hit her a bit hard but i dunno how long this has been a thing, maybe it's well deserved
---
Git gud.
---
When spectating if there are people already dead, their name and status won‚Äôt show up. If someone dies while your spectating, their name and status will still show up.
---
If it glows it goes!
---
If she's not then please show me some arguments that counters what I said in my original comment. And I didn't say she's only F tier, she can still be good but it completely depends on the implementation
---
I pip more often from unhooking, cleansing, and dying than i do from surviving.  It's kinda dumb.
---
We're not all sweaty toxic players. Personally I just grad a friend and play casually for fun
---
I think you‚Äôre missing the point of this post entirely. It‚Äôs just a reminder that there are people struggling. Depressive symptoms and tendencies are not things someone can ‚Äútough out‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt work like that.
---
But thank you for reaching out to others in need. I‚Äôm sure you know as well as I do how much of a positive impact that makes
---
They removed extra blinks without giving her a serious penalty for it. Any trained nurse won‚Äôt care about a recharge system for blinks because they don‚Äôt miss blinks first off and second, even if they whiff, most survivors can‚Äôt do gens fast enough anyway. 
---
You‚Äôre cracked if you think Nurse won‚Äôt be in the same spot, just more counterplay friendly.
---
Ok but we‚Äôre still not touching Mori‚Äôs?
---
Was that build inspired by the trapper discussion on whether or not he should have Bloody Coil in his base kit? Both Hangman‚Äôs Trick and starting with more traps were mentioned in the thread.
---
To be honest they did act pathetic. They are acting like it's normal to run into Huntress with iridescent hatchets, but it literally happens so rarely, like seriously guys? Won't you try to win against something like that? You won't even try?  Are you really going to act like crybabies because you didn't get the game you wanted? That's sad. If I were them, I would stick around just to see how long I would last and if I would maybe possibly manage to escape (considering that 3 other survivors wouldn't leave lol). And some still argue that they aren't entitled (not all surv mains, I am talking about these individuals). They are literally acting like a child that lies on the ground and screams because mom didn't buy them a toy. That's trurly what it is. It's just childish. And if anyone is wondering, I'm not maining anyone (which by some is instantly considered being a killer main lol).
---
Bruh this is the most entitled fucking shit. ‚ÄúGod all these matches where killers use their good add ons are SO boring, I wish they‚Äôd just use trash add ons while I use my insta heals and shit.‚Äù
---
Nurse is one of my mains (console), but I don't use add ons, so it's not that big of a deal. If anything, it'll just make my Nurse stronger since the add ons will be usable, and I have so many of them. Especially since some of the common add ons are becoming ultra rare, I should have a good number of ultra rares after the change.
---
We'll see what the recharge rate is like, but I don't think it'll affect my playstyle much. It's only 3 seconds, but I guess it'll depend on when the recharge starts, and if blinks continue recharging while you're blinking.
---
U open steam , and , "oh well well!" U have a new commentary on your profile...
---
Maybe I could have been more clear. That leatherface did NOT play well. I‚Äôm just saying waiting at the gate might not have been enough and he at least gave it his best effort.
---
I think Prayer Beads is actually pretty fun once in a while. Gives lots of spooks. But it's frustrating when it's used too often. 
---
Make it ultra-rare? Idk
---
No they were not and she is not worse than Freddy after this holy fucking shit.
---
&gt; *A) you have the perk borrowed time, which, when you unhook a survivor while within the killer's terror radius makes any hit that would've downed them within the next 15 seconds instead apply deep wound,*
---
Additional note for u/thebratqueen - Borrowed Time won't activate if you're asleep (being more or less the only situation where you'll hear killer noise but it won't actually be a Terror Radius). Other killers are "more obvious" when they're not generating a Terror Radius, since they'll usually be *completely silent*.
---
The nurse isn't prevented from using her power without the add-on. She now has to charge up her next blink after blinking which begins once she enters fatigue. Live fatigue is currently is 2 seconds + .5 seconds for each blink, so unless that changes significantly you'll be able to blink almost immediately after exiting fatigue.
---
and keys
---
I play both sides but mainly survivor, I‚Äôm fine with Insta saws, Omega Blink and prayer beads. Makes the killer stand a strong chance, plus I solo queue a lot and the amount of 3 mans out there is insane. I wouldn‚Äôt wanna go against swf all the time and get slapped. So stop being an entitled ass survivor as you do run flashlights and toolboxes and yes they make a difference even without good add ons, still can get saves and rush gens.
---
The downside is in her base kit now where each blink has a 3 second recharge. Combine it with the LOS requirement and you can just run around a tall rock to cripple her.
---
Alright.
---
My dc is ready.
---
Edit: dammit someone beat me already.
---
I think this is a world record
---
Good talk
---
Maybe people are just tired of playing nurses, spirits or insta saw billys all day.
---
Are you over exaggerating when you say 56? I don‚Äôt ever use those perks so
---
I‚Äôve spawned into a game right next to a killer‚Äôs ruin and only known about it bc of small game
---
Yeah.
---
Dwight is scarier that Susie change my mind
---
You're wrong lmao, they didn't change only her add-ons, they nerfed her into the ground, she fatigues after every blink now
---
No fam don't you get it, she's literally old Freddy tier now
---
I might check out the PTB just to see the archives.
---
Playing survivor,
---
Simply trying to relax,
---
It's a fucking nurse.
---
Base hillbilly is fine and should be untouched. Just the insta saw and no cool down add ons have to be looked at.
---
Ehh Wouldn't the killer notice her/his purple totem vanishing? If it just remains there (visually) being able to stealth an active hex is pretty strong, And with the ability to see the killers aura i would allow the killer to kill that player for the duration it's active
---
They just killed 1 of the 3 top tier killers...
---
You're right though. 
---
Julie and Susies walk animation also looks really weird from a survivor pov. As if they try to look cool and edgy.
---
Dude I‚Äôm in love! 10/10 would buy a print or a sticker of this
---
You have some serious talent, keep up the awesome work.
---
On xbox I regularly join group chats as a killer, the trick for me is to never even plug in your mic, if they have nothing to feed off they burn out pretty wuick saying ‚Äúur trash kys etc‚Äù personally the verbal bullying is funny/motivating for me, but honestly these guys can shoot some straight venom. Last night I had a guy say ‚ÄúI hope you trip on some steps and split your head open‚Äù because I joined his group party mid match and I killed the guy who was talking all the shit because he accidentally told me where he was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go take a hit for that bill so this baby killer won‚Äôt get a 3k‚Äù then I just stopped chasing bill and camped the meg who was coming in for the rescue.
---
For criticism I would say that Dwight's hand and head is a little off, the hand being very wide and the face being a bit too oval shaped as well as wierdly connected to the body.
---
As for praise... THIS IS AMAZING. I never thought the day would come when I could see my favorite horror game mixed with some of the most campy and classic era of horror. This is fantatic!
---
Absolutely, but I was intending to suggest that a tangible benefit is unlikely unless you're fully perked into moving fast while carrying - otherwise the survivor is going to boost into the distance and you'll still lose *some* wiggle time.
---
Well no but actually this comic gave me adhd
---
Yikes
---
My DC is ready
---
Thanks that's actually very helpful. I will try both of these and probably post it in the near future.
---
Fantastic, perspective could use some work. At the least it should be obvious his chin is past his shirt. The hand is also a bit off, but it‚Äôs all still pretty good. Sorry if I‚Äôm not being helpful, not good at that
---
Nah dude, that‚Äôs busted AF. Walking in on someone finishing a cleanse and getting a free Mori? Seeing the killer‚Äôs Aura is so you can force a chase to get the Hex effect to end.
---
I can get that, sometimes you don't want ultra, try-hard competitive games and instead have a more relaxed experience, but that doesn't mean you should take it out on the lower levels, I mean if you don't like that high level meta game stuff don't bring it down to us.
---
Can't wait for Ghostface.
---
Why would they nerf keys and insta heals when killers have moris and pink add ons? Killers rare items are far more game changing and easier than keys and insta heals anyways.
---
For the Spirit, I can see why she‚Äôs a killer. She‚Äôs the embodiment of rage and anger towards her father, so she believes that if she kills all these people, she‚Äôll be able to get revenge on her dad.
---
I have no idea how the Spirit is a killer though. She‚Äôs a devoted priestess. She has no previous records of attacking/killing anyone. She cut off her own toe as a sacrifice to the Gods. If the game was being realistic, she would be sacrificing her self to freeing the survivors from the entity. She is in no way a killer, besides being somewhat intimidating because of her illness and height. 
---
Hopefully the archives provide us with a bit more information on why these two are working with the entity.
---
Link?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been considering him as much as Huntress. Maybe I should give him a try before stepping into the deep end with Huntress.
---
Ah okay I see, thought you were saying he wasn‚Äôt licensed at all. Sorry for misunderstanding
---
Oh yeah piggy 2.0
---
Thank you.
---
A sound nerf? That would basically kill her
---
Wtf is wrong with people who want this??? 
---
Can we not have any viable killers that can handle harsh swf teams? Or does every killer need to have no mobility so everyone can easily spread out and do multiple gens at once 
---
They need to stop... nothing wrong with having strong killers.  Not even ‚Äúop‚Äù, just people who can‚Äôt adapt or change playstyles per killer
---
Need a buff
---
She's 93% movespeed. She literally has to use her entire resource set just to get anywhere close to the survivor, who can then just hold W to escape.
---
Ah, it‚Äôs fine. I often struggle with wording.
---
As if console Nurse players weren't rare enough xD!  I suck with her and jus used her to mess around and/or if I got a daily, but mostly jus reroll the Daily if it's Nurse.
---
It's what she deserves
---
Lmao I hate it when they unhook them right away without borrowed time and call you a camper or a tunneller lol
---
Why would people downvote me complimenting my Asian friend for being good at math.
---
That looks incredible, great job! Thanks for posting it here.
---
The problem I have with Nurse being nerfed so heavily while Spirit receives nothing is that Spirit is completely brain-dead to play.
---
A good Nurse has literally no counters this is true, but the thing is that few players are at the skill level where they can play Nurse well enough for there to be "literally no counters." Spirit meanwhile *has* counters even if they're really good (Iron Will, Spine Chill) but the problem is that a garbage Spirit who only knows the bare basics of the Killer is *only* countered by these mechanics that universally counter Spirit.
---
Basically I don't want to be forced to run Spine Chill and Iron Will every fucking game just because Spirit is way too strong, akin to how Killers were forced to run Enduring every fucking game just because Decisive Strike was too strong.
---
I'd prefer to lose once to "Hex: Tryhard" the Legacy 3 Nurse with BBQ 3, Infectious Fright 3, Whispers 3, and Pop Goes 3 than lose 100 times to "PaulEscabano.16" the default Spirit with Monstrous Shrine 1 and nothing else.
---
&gt;!It also pisses me off how stupidily easy it would be to make Spirit less overpowered (give her the ["Deafened" debuff](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Disfigured_Ear) while phasing and nerf Prayer Beads) but that's another discussion entirely.!&lt;
---
I think he‚Äôs finally going senile...
---
If only civ bots weren't disabled I'd enjoy it a bit more lol
---
Legion is hot though
---
You can ask in the lobby chat.
---
true. Really hope that with the dedicated servers they'll get their own and people in europe with one seperate server. It would make sense to divide these regions due to the distance :)
---
This is what I come to Reddit for
---
The difference between insta heals and the nurse is, that nurse requires skill and was nerfed to the ground while insta heals will probably still be strong lol
---
I dont feel bad. Shes been an auto win mechanic for far too long.
---
I main Nurse (don't tackle me just yet) but I typically only ever run pocket watch and the moderate charge speed (overall difference: slightly faster charge Speedy, moderately reduced fatigue). I'm looking forward to these changes because now I can use any of her addons and actually have self respect by the end of the game. I think the meta on her will probably be double charge cooldown, but we'll see.
---
What are the other killers?
---
My Bugged survivor that makes no grunt sounds even with stridor.
---
Nahhh, Susie is bestest üìèüíÄüíú
---
This guy gets it.
---
There's a big divide between good addons and game breaking bullshit addons. Good addons would be similar to:
---
Hindered status or Exaustion status huntress, it's fair because huntress has to be able to hit her hatchets to apply the effects.
---
Movement speed or movement speed when exiting phase spirit, she has that increased speed for mobility, but still can be countered heavily by scratch mark juking or running iron will
---
Pretty much any addons other than omega blink or 5 blink nurse, nurse has a lot of counter play when the killer isn't all too good. Though if the nurse is good, they could run no addons and still slaughter a team.
---
The issue isn't good addons, the issue is addons that make a killer stupid Over powered. I myself am a huntress main, if I see that swf that bullied me when I was playing trapper. I'm going to throw on iridescent head with an ebony mori. 
---
Guess what happened during those matches, 4k before even 2 gens get done or 3k and someone gets hatch. 
---
It is undeniable that killers have some stupid addons that make them impossible to beat in most cases. Nobody is saying "I WISH KILLERS WOULD NEVER RUN GOOD ADDONS"
---
People are saying "hey these addons not only make killer too strong, but they also ruin the experience of playing the game"
---
The same goes for killers asking for reworks on haddonfield and asylum. Both those maps have disgusting balanced landing infinites with dogshit totem spots that survivors literally spawn on. 
---
The game can be unbalanced in both ways, but we really need to work on finding ways to lessen that unbalanced gameplay so games are still winnable.
---
This isn't entitlement, this is called wanting to play a game and another player deciding that you can't win a match anymore. 
---
TL;DR: You're wrong, this isn't entitlement, both sides have huge imbalances and they need to be reworked or else the game will just continue to lose a community. Also I'm arguably more of a killer player, so I have no bias towards the survivor's side of things.
---
As a meg mainÔºåI honestly cannot hit skillchecküòÇ
---
If you cant move through pallets and walls youre "f" tier smh.
---
If BHVRs balance team that are survivoid mains don't at least give her some decent base MS after this, then they really are clueless. In most scenarios you now will only have 1 blink after fatigue and will be absolutely brain dead slow and useless for 3 seconds..
---
["Reworked."](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/)
---
When playing as the spirit what does ‚Äúpassive phasing‚Äù mean in context of her add ons? I‚Äôve just picked her up today and I‚Äôve got tons of ad ons that effect it but don‚Äôt know what it means lol.
---
No mither: *My day has come*
---
Lol I read "Second Wind is Deliverance" and was reminded of the match I just had. A Steve managed to 4% when everyone else was slugged but since he was broken because of Second Wind the Killer tunnelled him since they thought he had Deliverance.
---
One choice makes it impossible for you to lose (assuming no key/hatch). The other takes control of the game out of your hands, puts it into your opponent's, and makes it easy for him to win. It is absolutely a horrible play in terms of winning tactics. 
---
Hell, even if you don't want to stand still, you could still chase all you want once further from the door, but the *one thing* Leatherface absolutely couldn't do was get stunned.
---
Correction, it's "Dash into a wall/corner"
---
The pocket watch's description is wrong because it affects your blink movement speed and not your charge speed.
---
I mean I've been stuck mid grab cos the guy dced and then they all escaped, that sucked I know what its like :(
---
Wow lets just wait everyone gets nerfed and we only play trapper
---
Agreed about the punks not rebelling being weird thing.
---
But I will say, I once dyed my hair dark blue and it was just because I liked the color blue a lot.
---
There's medkit changes coming with the PTB tomorrow, I'm hoping that instas are at least changed at the very least.
---
Maybe a "Consumes medkit and healths one health state/fully heals over a period of 20-30 seconds" or something like that.
---
What do you mean by everyone helping max out blood points. I‚Äôm new to the game so I‚Äôm still learning.
---
Meanwhile dwight is just watching from inside that locker..
---
Moris and iridescent heads/beads are faarrr more overpowered than a one time insta heal and key that requires surviving through the entire match.
---
&gt;According to good killers
---
You mean according to people who have more 7k hours on the game and spend all their day playing the game, which corresponds to 0.01% of the killer community.
---
Let's wait for the PTB before burying her. We'll see how things play out tomorrow. Nurse is one of the killers I main, and I'm not too worried at this point.
---
Maybe make the handle bloody as well since the hand is covered in blood
---
Yea, I think if you don't use add ons, it won't take much time to adjust.
---
Some of the changes are just head scratching, honestly. Louder survivor sounds for 60 seconds? Really?
---
of course they are, because survivors can bring 4 of them, also killer add-ons are 1 time use without black ward while survivors can use 1 key for eternity.
---
In case anyone hasn't checked the Test notes, this question is in regards to some *potential* upcoming changes.
---
Spasmodic Breath will be an Uncommon that means if Nurse lands a Blink hit then she has 60s without Blink, during which she is able to move at "killer standard" 115% speed.
---
Matchbox will be an Ultra Rare that trades one Blink for permanent T1 Evil Within Myers walking speed, or 105%.
---
Normally Nurse would be eating Fatigue after a hit, which is why Save the Best for Last wouldn't be useful for her, but with improved walking speed you'd be able to run her more like a regular M1 killer, and that naturally means she'd get a big benefit from Save the Best for Last. 
---
*Definitely* under Spasmodic Breath, less so under Matchbox (unless you were putting Play with your Food on top).
---
I wish I could agree with you but the base change change to nurse will hurt her bad when it comes to her map pressure and chase potential
---
Blind faith is a terrifying thing. You show me a person who murders people for money, and a person murdering people because god tells them too, and I would feel safer with the former 100% of the time. Killing because a dark force is telling you to do so isn't any less evil.
---
I'm pretty sure I saw on otzdarva's stream the change to the basekit I just can't remember what it is exactly something to do with having to wait for blinks to recharge after use possibly idk
---
Is it more overpowered than 4 of those things?
---
Anyone with TTV in their name. Only kids do it.
---
A daa mi kaa din gia,
---
asa po meer!
---
killers have to pay for each add-on. also you can just survive without losing anything
---
how is nurse dead
---
I have no problems with the add on changes. They changed her base kit aswell. Read patch notes.
---
Ding Ding the Nurse is Dead!
---
Calm spirit
---
Bro those ultra rares are dog shit
---
Blink k/d 6 seconds.
---
You wait until the new update is out to even bother
---
keys do too then
---
Can't offer you much in the way of that, she's a combo of muscle memory and player reads. There are some perks/tools to help, her ultra rare plaid flannel shows you the landing spot, *stridor, bbq,* and *I'm all ears* are all perks that can help you figure out where to go next/where survs might go. As for the rest, it's just practice.
---
The Deadlight. The Demogorgon is called, well, The Demogorgon instead of something like ‚ÄúThe Monster‚Äù, so it‚Äôs not too far-fetched.
---
Yes, there is a cooldown after fatigue and you have to store your blinks
---
Yeah I know,3 second charge for each. Starting from fatigue which isn‚Äôt that game breaking
---
Ah, a fellow intellectual.
---
More like she has to deal with a brief second after fatigue before she can immediately blink again since the charges recharge once you start fatigue. The only thing she loses is being able to repeatedly use double blinks during chase.
---
Seen the add on and basekit changes yet?
---
I just saw that in the subreddit.
---
Read patch notes.
---
4 insta heals do not equal the power of infinite insta down huntress. Killers use their pink add ons for an entire game. And usually stack a mori on top. You need add ons to reuse a key and those are rare and hard to get bc the surv blood web is infested with a crap ton of garbage items and they make far less points. 
---
Sounds fair to me while moris and pink items are still up. Idk how killers can complain when they have the exact same bs in their blood webs.
---
I was thinking of making this exact thing about a month ago, and you‚Äôve put everything in almost the exact place I was thinking! So thank you!
---
Mine was reasoned as this:
---
1. Freddy because he killed and molested children. That‚Äôs the most evil in my book.
---
2. Ghost Face, Clown and Doctor, because of the torture factor and I believe they‚Äôre intelligent enough to make a choice between good and evil and have chosen evil.
---
3. Legion, because they‚Äôre a mixed bag of personalities, which puts them in the middle.
---
After this it starts to get harder for me, because I believe some of the killers are not intelligent enough or have a mental illness which prohibits them from consciously making the decision to be evil (Even though some of them definitely ARE evil, like Myers, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs actually sane enough to compared to Ghost Face, who acts like a good guy and then enjoys stabbing you in the back. To me, that‚Äôs evil,) and some are victims of environment that are now angry.
---
4. Myers, Pig, Huntress, Trapper, Hillbilly, Demogorgon (see above for why)
---
5. Spirit, Hag, and Wraith are all straight victims to me, while Plague has nothing evil about her in her backstory and Leatherface is just scared and very stupid.
---
Wraith and doctor would be awesome
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
Timer starts with fatigue, so 2 seconds is literally nothing.
---
That was a pretty solid play. I hope they bring back firecrackers soon. I'd like to try them myself.
---
Why would it be tweaked in ptb? She was easily the most powerful killer and the devs made a conscious effort to nerf her power
---
I GOTTA see my boy Herman
---
How do you know? Her clothes are too thick to see any curves whatsoever.
---
Uh yeah? Lol. Infinite use of beads and iri heads against a 4 time use of insta heal? Not to mention moris completely remove players out of the match after 1 hook. 
---
Give me a break. Insta heals do nothing against my spirit. I welcome it. She needs the challenge. Spirit with pop in itself is a pink add on lol.
---
Turns out all is changing in mid-chapter fix.
---
This is so amazing holy shit
---
Console.
---
&gt;You say all this like people were using add-ons on her in the first place.
---
I mean most of the nurses I've seen only played with 3 blinks and range, it isn't exactly uncommon.
---
Most killers are viable at rank 1. People are just entitled and think that rank 1 is just swf insane teams. You are hardly gonna what a 4 man with comms, games not balanced for that. People don‚Äôt actually know what viable means anymore. It‚Äôs a shame how half the community is just a echo of one or two creators screaming other opinions.
---
Spasmodic Breath might be the worst add on in the game - remove her power entirely and make her a 115% pure M1 killer with nothing else going on for 60 seconds - I mean honestly what the fuck is that?
---
mind to tell about key counterplay?
---
Actually with the new nurse update coming, she finally gets some pink ones!
---
Yeah, quite a few really haven‚Äôt been good recently, but:
---
Ghostface had ‚ÄúGhost Face Caught on Tape‚Äù, which is a pretty fun addon to use. Surveillance camera is also pretty decent if you use it correctly. 
---
Freddy‚Äôs reworked Black Box and Red Paint Brush are both good as well, imo.
---
Nurse is overpowered even is she goes naked, no addons and no perks she‚Äôs still incredible, as far as I know they haven‚Äôt touched her base kit, they have also made the addon that shows her blink distance common for training, she‚Äôs been made easier to play as in my eyes.
---
I started playing after he was nerfed, but I have literally never seen legion hit multiple people with frenzy.
---
I have also never seen frenzy actually do anything useful.
---
There is no known hacks on console might be a glitch
---
Sally Smithson

PERKS
---
&gt;**Restoration**
---
&gt;Your work sustains and revitalizes you. While injured, your repair progress on a generator will translate into healing progress for you and any injured allies on the same gen at a conversion rate of 80/90/100%.
---
&gt;**Hippocratic Oath**
---
&gt;First do no harm. While healing another survivor or yourself, great skill check zones are 5/10/15% larger and failed skill checks will not give a visual notification to the killer. 
---
&gt;**Bedside Manner**
---
&gt;Your passion inspires your patients. Following a safe unhook, both you and the unhooked survivor gain a 10% bonus to repair, heal, search, and opening speed for 35/40/45 seconds. Stacks.
---
Almost all killers on pallet stuns lmao, especially huntress
---
do legion
---
You play her without add-ons. Train your muscle memory. Then you learn to predict survivors.
---
I doubt incoming changes will alter this a lot.
---
Yeah I play the game pretty much just in October and come back this year has been brutal.
---
they should at least buff some other killers before nerfing the Nurse. Plus they have touched her base kit.
---
of all the addons that's the one you call shitty? thats one of the few that actually sound like they're maybe useful (for a brown anyway). stuff like disabling blink for higher movement speed or blinking past a survivor makes them scream is what puzzles me. those are GREEN addons, like why would i ever want those lmfao
---
If you were on PC I could give some  advice. Sadly I can't because Nurse with a controller is different than Nurse with MKB. The only thing I can say is the more you look up, the farther you go. If you look down you barely go forward. So try not to look too much forward if someone is right in front of you in a chase unless its one of the harder objects to go through
---
Eh, if you got to a point where all gens got done and everyone is alive then the survivors pretty much won anyway. If it's one guy getting out via key then it's really not as impactful as a syringe would be.
---
Have you tried one blink Nurse at R1? Good luck with that :D
---
Unpopular opinion here. They are So Bad at balancing the game because they constantly look to the community for fixes and changes and the majority of the time the community just complains because they just lost a game, not because its actually a viable issue. Then people like you come along and shit talk the devs.
---
Console in wireless connection but scream fix this broken game. Pffft this is hysterical
---
Nurse used to have it all but now she is nothing but another killer to be forgotten and never played like legion except by the occasional memers
---
For good reason, survivor was favored for too long
---
Entitled? this game has a system to separate new, bad players from the more experienced players, some people abuse this system to put themselves into lower ranks to lord over and ruin the fun for newer players because they can't do it at higher ranks, depiping is bannable because it ruins the game including the games you throw to depip and if all you can say is stop crying when new players come to forums either to just vent or bring up a problem then don't cry when new players stop coming and the game slowly dies
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I was thinking. Killers like Spirit and Hag sound more frustrated than hurt when stunned, though.
---
Probably not hacking, but an exhaustion glitch. Sometimes you'll have 0 exhaustion and be able to use your exhaustion non stop, its a pretty rare glitch
---
I bet almost everyone who says every killer is viable rank 1 is a survivor main, or isn‚Äôt red ranks, it is incredibly impossible for me to win if I‚Äôm not using nurse or spirit in red ranks, I also know a lot of killers use billy in red, I‚Äôm a rank 4 survivor as well and I almost never see anyone but billy, spirit, nurse, or the occasional trapper lol.
---
Lore wise, her faith was so strong that as she was dying, the entity felt her intense belief and pretended to be god so that she would obey. Now she blindly follows the order of the "god" that reached out to her. The entity feeds on strong emotions such as hope, fear and hatred. Intense belief can be described as an emotion as well.
---
so you advice me to play huntress all time? Her 1shot hatchets are bullshit for sure, but there is not much pink add-ons with similar value. I don't mind nerfing bullshit in this game tho
---
PLEASE
---
Cant wait to see what you do with Wraith and Nea üòé great artwork lad!
---
I'd say you as a killer made some mistakes if everybody is still alive at that point.
---
It's not a hack, it's a glitch in the game. I don't think they've fixed it. I've dealt with it twice, but that was a couple months ago. It's like an infinite Sprint Burst right?
---
Ngl üëÄ üí¶
---
K but these actually sound cool. Little OP maybe but still cool.
---
Strider is a godsend. Take it, get it to tier 3, and use it.
---
I don't see what that has to do with the conversation. I get your upset at the changes, but at least read them instead of making shit up to get mad at.
---
Why do you not use items?
---
Actually, 5‚Äô9 is VERY generous. Jackie Earle Haley (the actor) isn‚Äôt even 5‚Äô6, and it really shows in the movie too; he‚Äôs really fucking short.
---
and STBFL possibly
---
&gt; as far as I know they haven‚Äôt touched her base kit
---
"In the process, we‚Äôve also made a few adjustments made to her base power. Previously, the Nurse could double blink, go through fatigue, then immediately double blink again. This did not leave the Survivors with much of an opportunity to break line of sight. A **recharge mechanic for blink charges has been added to limit how quickly she can perform multiple blinks**. Rather than immediately receiving all her blink charges following fatigue, she will instead regain charges one at a time. Each charge takes three seconds starting from the beginning of her fatigue. This time can be reduced through add-ons."
---
You need a 65'' monitor :weSmart:
---
200 bloodpoints that don‚Äôt mean shit as you‚Äôll most likely get 30-32k every game. yet survivors get half lmao
---
You can see who has a key and remove them from the game.
---
But hillbilly has abs though duh
---
Yeah she will be able to, if you got any charges left :)
---
Yeah but in the ‚Äò78 version, Dr. Loomis literally says he is the literal embodiment of evil and devoid of anything that makes someone human.
---
How about actually playing it first before crying unplayable?
---
Dwight‚Äôs head/hand doesn‚Äôt read the best but that‚Äôs the only thing that needs work imho. It‚Äôs amazing dude keep it up!!!
---
Sure bud, because no one dresses up for themselfs, they all do it to get YOUR HOLY ATTENTION. Grow up.
---
Please do !!!
---
Good survivors LOVE going against hillbilly because he's actually what? a balanced killer, unlike nurse and spirit.
---
Looking forward to mike and laurie chode
---
Joe mains represent
---
Exactly, with the first one you just have to not be worth killing. 
---
With the second though... well you better hope you have God's favor [in their mind]
---
Well technically if you are playing as Nurse and the first thing you do is flex 5 blinks, that will either scare or piss off all the survivors. Then when you flip it around and farm (with the 1 survivor left because the other 3 DC'd), the frustration of their team abandoning them and the relief of a peaceful Nurse would equate to strong enough emotions to compensate for the lack of fear and hope.
---
not yet
---
I'm complaining about something that happened at rank 16 and you thought I played a lot? are you dumb? of course I'm new most of the perks i have are rank 1 and of course i don't know every perk and how to counter it I'm new, what did you think I had 1000+ hours in the game and was talking about red ranks? i have limited options in the ways of perks and add ons so of course i get annoyed when people bring rank 3 meta perks, and the point i was making was to not be a toxic asshole maybe you should read my post before you get all defensive about deranking.
---
Huntress lost all human connection as a child forcing her to become wild. So she's got the basic intelligence of a child. Basically just a beast who hunts like any other wild animal
---
ah yes because clearly the fact that huntress has an overpowered ultra rare means every killer ultra rare is overpowered
---
i can't think of any other ultra rare that's stronger than all 4 survivors bringing an insta heal
---
If you survive without losing the key then it sounds to me you didn't get to use the key's effect, it didn't make any difference in the match and you would've survived without it. Strong killer add ons make a huge difference every match and very often carry a bad player to victory.
---
&gt;killers have to pay for each add-on.
---
Killers earn triple of what survivors do almost every match.
---
Imagine the amount of toothpaste the Demogorgon has to go through every day..
---
I mean he was definitely a pedophile in the original. It was just subtext instead of outright stated.
---
Thank god omega blink and 3 blink are dead.
---
As for  the nerf to her power. I'll have to play with it to judge for sure but 3 seconds might be a little harsh, 2 seconds I think may be more fair.
---
Edit: nevermind it starts recharing from the beginning of the fatigue not the end of it. So 3 seconds is fair.
---
You better watchout, people don't read sarcasm well
---
What‚Äôs the commotion about spirit players? Did I miss something other than nurse addon changes?
---
I agree, which is why I'm hoping they're also getting rid of insta-heals and will address gen speed.
---
Fair point, but I would consider those two achievements as outliers compared to the majority of killer related achievements in the game and should be bought in line according...I know its already impossible at this point but eh...
---
They nerfed her base kit and buffed her add ons lmao
---
She abducts little girls to "keep them safe" after raiding villages only to chain them to the wall where they starve to death
---
Edit: one could argue like hillbilly she could be shitty circumstance that led to becoming a simpleton
---
Oh my god, I just looked them up.
---
&gt;*Blinking past a survivor causes them to scream and awards 200 blood points in the devious category for terrifying them.*
---
If that is the actual add on description I'll piss myself. 
---
**"+200 Successful Spook, but do that 25 times again to make up for the bloodpoints you spent on this, lol"**
---
To quote Cleveland Brown: And boom goes the dynamite.
---
Seriously. The developers have taken their game that was intended to be a fun casual experience, essentially a giant party game of slasher cat and mouse and taken everything the community on both sides says at face value and complained about and just run into this ground where it's a competitive shit fest of ''I MUST WIN AT ALL TIMES TO HAVE FUN. I MUST HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL SIDE AND THINGS AT ALL TIMES TO HAVE FUN."
---
The devs just need to stop fucking listening to us when it comes to balance.
---
Because it's reddit
---
Join the group think
---
Join us
---
I‚Äôm a rank 4 survivor and I hate hillbilly lol, almost everyone I know my rank does too.
---
I had this happen once and it lasted the entire match. I was hit as I jumped through the floor with balance landing. Once the last gen was done I lost the speed and took the hook.
---
I know people might not know the answer yet but is the Archives coming with DBD's version of the battle pass system?
---
i dont mean to be a grammer nazi but "didnt told" like cmon lol
---
Killers who complain about add ons are the people who never admit their miss plays as being their fault. Insta heals and prayer beads though need to get removed imo. And Noed too( BHVR please remove this shit perk). Killer main btw
---
Fuck console
---
Nurse is fucking broken on PC and this "nerf" you're talking about which is actually more a BALANCE rework is 100% warranted. So fuck you and your 30 fps
---
No you are for making such a spooky track that has to potential to be added to the game it seems
---
Oh does she really do that? I dont think so.
---
That's some Jedi shit
---
Why are we nerfing medkits btw? Medkit add ons like syringe and styptic? Sure. But medkits in general? How about we don't? 
---
How about we do something about toolboxes instead. Four of those things is far more annoying and game changing than four medkits.
---
June to june ;)
---
Run deliverance on David, they never expect it
---
June to June I‚Äôm pretty sure since the game came out on June.
---
Read her bio
---
I agree.  My real complaint is that sometimes you realize you're the only person doing gens *because* people know they'll get more points for unhooks, chases, and cleanses.
---
Then you do all the gens and don't pip.
---
They need to buff up, not nerf down
---
Well the thing is vanilla killers vs survivors has been tested, and well lets just say survivors win majority of the time. Most killers cant slow down the game, have map pressure or locate survivors... it would be interesting to see who performs the WORST without addons. My beet is Doc
---
Being rank 4 doesn't make you a good survivor.
---
Survivors who urban evade everywhere probably hate billy, but survivors who actually know how to play the game think he's the most fun killer to against.
---
Basically do challenges to unlock rewards such as bloodpoints and lore, similar to dailies but more specific (one shown was trap 3 survivors after they vault a window)
---
**I M J U S T T R Y I N G T O P L A Y B U B B A**
---
Yeah the downside is the second survivors see a mori or an instadown if it's swf (and most of the time even if it isn't) you can expact a 4 man instant disconnect because using a mori and pinks is "toxic."
---
But nobody ever bats an eye at 4 man hatch escapes or BNP stacking with 4 adrenalines and Dead hards. Fact of the matter is people bitch about OP stuff on Killer side but Survivors tend to get away with their perks not really being bitched about all that much (Caveats aside from pre-change Decisive).
---
Call of duty Black ops 2 zombies.
---
Do not all killers have moris and pink add ons?
---
IM GIORNO GIOVANNA, PIANO ROLLA DA!!!
---
As a PS4 nurse main I‚Äôm crying
---
It's 3 seconds that starts when Nurse begins Fatigue animation. Fatigue is currently 2 seconds for 1 blink and 2.5 seconds for 2 blinks. So your next blink is up within a second after you finshing being fatigued. So I don't think the recharge itself will kill her chase potential. 
---
It's going to be effectively losing the 2nd blink since that will require 3-4 seconds to get back.
---
did they cleansed your NOED totem? If yes the perk becomes useless.
---
Wheres the fun if your not taking endgame risks? Lol, I do it because it's more fun than waiting for the next que.
---
Always a wholesome first in any DbD players time with the game, from either perspective
---
Mindbreaker is actually a good perk if you're good a pressuring gens. I would imagine using that with Ruin would be a good combo. Even if you lose the survivor in a chase, they won't be able to recover from exhaustion as fast if they are working on gens. And if they're not, you can get em faster.
---
As a survivor main, I use balance landing and even though most killers don't use Mindbreaker, the ones that do ... are really smart about how they play with it.
---
Edit: For clarification
---
That‚Äôs because the survivors cleansed all the totems on the map, so there was no totems for NOED to activate on
---
Yes I just saw! Pretty cool too, not as strong as I was expecting
---
Exactly. Her second blink is essential for chases. That's the point I'm trying to make. It's possible to be good with just one blink, but it will be *extremely* difficult.
---
That‚Äôs your problem... you think there‚Äôs only 1 way to play this game...
---
And that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt handle nurse or spirit
---
They require a change in play style.  You can‚Äôt mindlessly loop them.  In fact, urban evasion is a good one for them and staying out of sight
---
Such an entitled thing to say, insinuating people who use stealthy perks don‚Äôt know how to play the game... get the fuck outta here with that horseshit
---
Perks honestly don‚Äôt make a huge difference at low ranks, i guarantee you would struggle to even get a hit let alone a down for me to hit DS or injured to use DH. Plus I‚Äôm not defensive I‚Äôm against people that bully new killers, but the way you went about it is lack of knowledge and from a brick wall perspective.  It is not bannable first of all which you avoided 2nd time round,  secondly the whole other reason was you include people who take breaks into ‚Äúderankers‚Äù . Like are they meant to not play the game??? Better to get them out of whatever rank you are.
---
You were being punished for using NOED.
---
Maybe it's not just the generator that goofy wants to fiddle with
---
ah-hyuck
---
I kinda see this as somewhat of an alternate universe where this was a series in the 60s/70s and then Matthieu inherited the idea of turning the comic franchise into a video game.
---
"These are not the survivors you are looking for!"
---
I don‚Äôt know if somebody is running plunderer‚Äôs.  So, why would I wait?
---
Minnie mouse killer would be terrifying.
---
Clown is the sexiest of them all
---
No. She‚Äôs actually 18+. Lore wise she‚Äôs actually 18. Developers said somewhere that all ‚Äúyounger‚Äù outfits relating to ‚Äúyounger‚Äù times are just homages to the past or recreations of their outfits they wore during that time period (ex: Spirit‚Äôs school Uniform)
---
Like for example: Frank is canonically 19.
---
DBD Devs stated they will never and I repeat, will never add anyone that is 17 years or younger. Hence why they didn‚Äôt add very well requested Dustin and Eleven for Stranger things. They are just too young and wouldn‚Äôt fit the theme.
---
Oh my god that‚Äôs amazing
---
In most cases I would say you are better off running a different perk from noed, it is not likely to get you more than one kill and is useless until the end game, at which point there is a good chance it's already been disabled by all the totems being cleansed.
---
You're right. Sadly the game is balanced around green ranks and they keep pushing more and more tools to survivors. And people whine why you only see spirits in red ranks. More buffs are needed for sure but as a killer main i ask for a reworked ruin and please remove Noed and insta heals. These two things ruin the game for both sides.

MY NURSE MAINS, MOVE FORWARD!
---
MY NURSE MAINS, SCREAM OUT! 
---
MY NURSE MAINS, RAAAAAGE!!
---
As a PS4 nurse main I‚Äôm crying over the hundreds of hours I spent mastering her all down the toilet
---
I just started out playing the game, NOED was the only useful perk I had to put in my 4th perk slot.
---
Huntress, Bubba, and Billy share one braincell.
---
Oof
---
This shit was impossible to lose with. Even on PS4 I was unbeatable with omegablink even with no ruin or moris.
---
Fuck EVERYTHING about this.

https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dcugz4/nurse_is_about_to_get_nerfed_hard_tru3talent_was/
---
I TOLD YOU ALL. I warned you! Where are you, all of you said "You're overreacting", "wait and see" "you're being doom and gloom" "Trust BHVR", "You're fear-mongering". 
---
Show yourselves. You all were so cocky and downvoted me and my thread for spitting facts. Tru3 was right on the money - they were nerfing her base and were hiding it from us the whole time. They LIED that it was just a "addon rework". It was bullshit from the start. Never ever trust these devs. ALL they do is double-talk, deflect, and hide their hands.
---
They wanted to nerf the Nurse for YEARS. I don't give a shit about her addons.  A killer's base is what's first, second, and third most important. A killer with a shit base and good addons is STILL a shit killer.
---
Downvote me again for being right. Truth is truth. I was right and you were wrong.
---
BHVR, your rework is just an all around nerf. Six fucking seconds to blink twice is an utter disgrace. Forcing people to use your shitty addons to be viable in high ranks is also an utter disgrace. You gutted her. One of the only viable swf-battled killers and you gutted her.
---
The low skilled survivor mains who begged you to nerf her were the same ones who acted like Legion was better than the Spirit. You know nothing about what it takes to be a great killer in your own game. All of you devs are ranked 15th or worse and couldn't hold a candle to the best killers in this community. Instead of asking THEIR opinions about the Nurse, you listened to the other people who have hated her since the start.
---
You know nothing about the sheer amount of time, patience, and practice that it took to be a great Nurse. The Nurse was never a killer that you picked up and instantly became good at because of bad coding or overpowered mechanics. The Nurse ALWAYS took time and patience and skill to master. She had a high reward because she had a skill cap. But you never wanted that for your game didn't you? Always gotta give the lowest skilled players a "fair chance". 
---
Well devs, a "fair" is a place where they judge pigs. There is NOTHING about life that is *fair*. ONLY your skill should determine whether you do good or bad in ANY video game worth it's salt.
---
Anyone who downvoted my thread and my comments in my thread - shame on all of you for once again falling for the banana in the tale pipe trick. When are you going to learn that you have to read between the lines when these devs say anything. Didn't the Legion teach you anything?
---
What a dark day for viable killers in this game. How safe does any Spirit main feel right now? How safe does any viable killer feel right now?
---
No idea why everyone's losing their shit in here. Good Nurses will still go about their business. They just raised her skill ceiling a bit.
---
Bold of me too assume something on reddit isnt sarcastic i guess
---
we have rights to quentin as a character, and I highly doubt you can just copyright someone's fucking facial structure unless you are the actor I guess
---
ahhh, hahahha. My bad dude, totally misunderstood.
---
I don‚Äôt hide? Lol. I constantly run loops or pump out gens, I hate billy/spirit  more than any killer in this game as a survivor, but as a killer they‚Äôre all that‚Äôs viable
---
Tier for the Demogorgon. HUNGERY
---
Everyone is too busy crying about how Nurse is "trash" now. Huh, I guess every killer that has ever been nerfed is F-tier. 
---
It's not like this is going through a PTB or anything before hitting live servers... /s
---
you didn't. this was a thing back in the day. fun times in deed.
---
Yep from what I can tell it extends quite far though
---
What a well thought out comment I just play Myers in tier 1
---
That's not your average everyday stupid
---
A true friend. It looks really nice
---
Lore wise, I would think that Plague would be under the Corrupted tag, as her blind faith is what set her into the world of the entity, but I can see why you put her under victim
---
It's advanced stupid
---
no one will miss that bullshit woo hoo
---
my ace grunt is ready
---
Ruined by the "Nobody:" and "Parents:". Good idea, butchered.
---
I can‚Äôt afford a good pc :(
---
Honestly
---
This game just got a whole lot more fun.
---
Looks like the endless 1/5 'did you have fun?' ratings by every survivor playing against her rubbed off
---
You say constructive criticism but is there any to give?
---
Meh. Add-ons should change the game and make it less predictable (like pallet freddy, scratched mirror myers), create niche builds, not be "Okay I win this one and fuck you" crutchs like Iri hatchets, Anal Beads or Omega Blink are.
---
It means they got all your totems prior to the last gen popping.
---
I agree killers should have advantage over survive with friends, but it kills solo queuers like me
---
*Michelle Myers*
---
Yeah and it looks really good. I doubt you would have the photoshop skills to do better
---
I thought jokes were supposed to be funny?
---
Thank you :) it took me a long time
---
Why? It doesn't mean they're insanely good, it just means they're part of the insanely old playerbase.
---
I love this. Please keep up the good work! :] I can't wait for the Clown's.
---
Took me a while to figure that one out...
---
I don't know why you got downvoted. Bloodlust was added when survivors could recover exhaustion while running. They can't any more and bloodlust remains. It needs to be seriously looked at AFTER they rework a lot of the maps.

thank you for finally linking it everyone else never said what actually changed

Because 9/10 legacy games end up with that killer being very, very good at it.
---
*The chainsaw is enchanted V too!*
---
Aww i actually felt sorry for leatherface when he stopped and looked away. üò¢ü§ó
---
big F
---
Its an add on rework, not necessarily a nerf... though I would probably agree Spirit should be getting some attention since she seems the most unenjoyable for survivors.
---
Eta: just read notes on the tweaks to the base power. So it is a bit of a nerf but that doesn't mean new add ons won't make up for that change. As she is, the nurse is too one dimensional so I do want to see her get some freshening up.
---
Their add-ons can make them op.
---
Nurse when she blinks
---
"sound nerf"  
---
I mean, just get rid of the injured sound or make it quieter, footsteps are a thing y'know?  
---
ik it, i spirit main uwu
---
I literally only solo queue...
---
It only kills it if you let it... it‚Äôs like people just decide something is broken and accept it as that instead of learning and adapting...
---
It‚Äôs not even an advantage over survivors.  Spirit and nurse are the only comfortable killers at high rank (solo or swf) because they actually have abilities that give them mobility.  So survivors can‚Äôt just mindlessly tap gens from all angles and the killer has to walk all the way between them
---
For example. If I‚Äôm a trapper, and I spend time chasing someone and I finally hook them, then I see 2 people on a gen across the map with bbq. I‚Äôd just give that gen up because I wouldnt be able to make it in time.
---
If I‚Äôm spirit or nurse, I actually have a chance to defend. Go over and chase them
---
Yeah but he doesn't fuck kids for fun
---
Um.. bubba is absolutely underpowered, and he is such a hassle to play. I bet you‚Äôre just a toxic survive with friends player.. take a downvote you toxic trash
---
It kicked me today, mid game. I lost my ultra rare item as well, even had an add on that says to keep it after death. Won't lie, I'm three pieces of salt right now lol.
---
would you rather go against nurse or spirit
---
I mean they are OP. But that's kinda the point isn't it?
---
I have a flashlight and the other guy has a chainsaw.
---
What's your survivor rank? Leatherface is one the weakest killers in DBD.
---
I think more survivor mains would realize this if they played killer too.
---
Yes
---
Is this a troll
---
Rank 7
---
I did this at 3 am
---
im so sorry for your lost.
---
How are these spoilers?
---
Is it only me or the new add-ons are only useful for BP farm? Except the fatigue ones, the only distance one and the ultra, the rest is just "make him scream", "200 more BP", "move faster for 60 seconds"
---
But I'm not saying anything about her viability or tiers, I'm just commenting on one aspect of her that I am happy to see changed.
---
They are powered enough for the game.
---
This is why I sort by hot
---
Holy shit wait open stacks like that?? I always that it was just a flat 8. Wow that perk is not half bad
---
Even though I don't get constant spirits and nurses you dont want my killers either. 
---
My past 4 games were a facecamping leatherface, hag with 4 hex totem perks and ended up getting a devoured 4k because teammates were bots, insta hatchet huntress that facecamped (had a meme username if theyd cobe theyd let them go) and a teabagging ghostface with mori
---
That's acceptable then, I suppose. :)
---
GOAT
---
But what is that? A dog?
---
Her blinks have a 3 second recharge, but you can prep multiple blinks (up to your max).
---
If you have 3 blinks, you can blink three times before fatigue. Then you recharge 3 seconds and get a blink back.
---
Wait another 3 seconds and you get a second blink back. You can now blink twice before fatigue.
---
Wait the last 3 seconds to go back up to your 3 blink cap.
---
Well this will make Nurse even worse than she already is on console, reinforcing the Spirit position as the best killer in the game (on console!).
---
I'm new to reddit and your downvotes are a little concerning to me. This place is definitely closer to a tumblr page than a 4chan board, be that a good or a bad thing.
---
Good on you for having the balls to double down lol
---
That comes with time more than experience. I can throw my head at a wall a thousand times and eventually break it, not because I'm strong, but because I wore it down.
---
Legacy players look cool and yeah, time usually comes with a level of veteran-esque play, but you don't need 3 years to get good at this game, it took me about 2 or 3 months to completely master everything this game has to offer.
---
If I ever faced a legacy player who was *that* good, I might think different, but most if not all are either super rusty because it's been 3 years, or are super cocky because they think they're intimidating me.
---
You don‚Äôt need to play it to know it‚Äôs trash.
---
Shush, give DBD the honour it deserves
---
No, that‚Äôs ridiculous
---
Injured sounds are basically apart of her.  Why would you want that nerf of all things?? Especially if you main her... footsteps are a thing, but what about hiding survivors who barely creep around?  
---
That would be silly. 
---
Spirit is perfectly fine at any rate... even prayer beads are fine, people just can‚Äôt adapt. So if they REALLY must change anything... just change the prayer beads...
---
Have fun playing against only hillbilly
---
Quality meme is quality. Take my upspook.
---
What is the counterplay to bloodlust? 
---
Eventually the guy will be mach 10 after running back and forth around the pallet and will get a hit on you.
---
Why is he staring at the hook ü§î
---
hmm interesting, like I said he is a pretty weak killer.
---
100% agreed.
---
Now play nurse or spirit and be prepared to get more hate than Hitler himself !
---
He‚Äôs side eyeing looking back from the hook cuz she got away
---
Say sike right now
---
Only happens to me on backwater or indoor maps. Will find literally every totem but the only lit one lmao it sucks for ranking unless you do well in chases and altruism
---
Do you understand the comment? Yes you did.
---
Yeah it's already very noticable on the newer maps, Stranger things map and new Badham have very weak loops and bloodlust just doesn't belong there.
---
Let‚Äôs nerf all viable killers.  Then survivors can just be 100% the power role and always bully everyone.  
---
Ruining the game because they can‚Äôt adapt to better killers (all low tier killers should be buffed to nurse/spirit level, not the other way around)
---
I do follow them but still end up with the same issue where if they aren‚Äôt directly in front of me the chase is hopeless for me.
---
This game is asymmetrical and inherently difficult to balance. When every killer has unique attributes and there are so many different perks and maps adding variability to gameplay the fine line gets thinner, considering they give in to the demands of players who don't know a thing about game design as often as they do and have managed to not completely break the game so far deserves praise. Give them some credit, the meme is true. They are doing a pretty good job so far.
---
Thanatophobia, Ruin, BBQ and M&amp;A
---
Oh no now you might have to play a killer that doesn‚Äôt defy all logic of the game like the rest of us :(
---
Survivor main here, don‚Äôt think killers are op
---
Is he??? Hmmmm. Interesting.......
---
How to play nurse after the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù:  wait 6 seconds for the cooldown
---
Jake just breaks every hook on the map
---
This is a joke, you‚Äôre either new to the game and don‚Äôt know how to vault a window or you‚Äôre trolling
---
Put this john on a shirt
---
Gen speed has already been reduced once. PGTW also got a huge buff recently, same with dying light which also slows the game down. It would be a seriously stupid move to increase gen time AGAIN, since holding m1 on a gen for the current time isn't exactly fun. 
---
I feel like perks like Inner Strength are actually a good move toward stealth slow down of the game (encouraging survivors to do totems/ secondary objective). More perks like this would be great or additional objectives, but increased gen times are really not necessary.
---
Does M&amp;A really help? I mean yeah it lowers her terror radius a bit but what else does it bring?
---
Interesting, it's good to hear there's some form of punishment in this game, thank you for sharing.
---
This is why I solo queue
---
Eh. It will be easier for not as skilled players and still doable for veterans. It's a decent add-on. It's more interesting than blink everywhere and hope they guess wrong.
---
Unless you're in an indoor map or one with houses
---
Become a floating shrouded Ghostface for 60 seconds.
---
Question, will you be willing to make some for any licensed killers?
---
Or we can separate solo players from everyone else and not have to worry about it anymore. You're right, killers will never be balanced against teams that can communicate in this game. That was BHVR's first mistake.
---
What I mean is the rare times I do run into legacy my team gets stomped hard
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, getting a gen done in 10 seconds is infinitely more overpowered than any killer add on. Each gen you compete is 20% of the objective done for survivors. Each hook a killer gets us roughly 9% of the objective done for them. It would take theoretically 50 seconds to do all five gens, but let‚Äôs call it 4 minutes, name one killer that can get 12 hooks in four minutes. Survivor is favored much more than killer in this game and that‚Äôs a fact. If the killer and survivor team are on the same level, survivors win 10/10 times. Killers need interesting build like the ones you mentioned
---
Hard in terms of blinks??? Just takes practice, when you get that it‚Äôs easy to apply pressure. Try apply pressure with clown or doc and then see who‚Äôs hard to play well
---
Not even close as powerful as huntress hatchets
---
You can close the distance just as well, 3 blinks is a lot of range.
---
Don't get caught up in the Reddit echo chamber. Nearly all nurses use add-ons.
---
I had prayer beads spirit, left hook immediately, at least 24 m away, hit a gen then saw a survivor running to hook so I phased over and hit her while she was unhooking and got 2 messages for camping. I...
---
Why is everyone blaming Survivor mains for the nerf? All that they wanted was a moderate nerf to her range and blink add-ons, and a justified nerf at that. Not anyones fault the devs went overboard.
---
of course you could use something else but I just love M&amp;A and it helps me a lot. Don't underestimate a lower terror radius. PGTW would be another good option.
---
Wow nurse just went from s tier to legion tier.
---
Cries in leatherface
---
Whos joe?
---
Thank goodness
---
I had a claudette bodyblock me into a wall after we finished a gen today in hawkins.  She just stood there for a good minute teabagging me.  After that, she started following me around...and i couldn't have been happier.
---
I dropped not one, but two pallets on her as she followed behind me.  As she slid over the last one, we could hear the killer coming.  I sprint bursted away and she got hooked.
---
I mean, I understand the nerf to that add-on which added 2 blinks and the range ones, but did her base kit really needed any change?  
---
I guess they really want to increase the number of survivors.
---
Pure muscle memory and predictions on if you should swing after a blink, 3/4 times I land if I swing weapon despite not knowing if my blink will land on them
---
I was rank 10 but once I learned nurse I quickly climbed to rank 3-4. I recommend using spirit instead since they‚Äôre destroying the nurse
---
Thantophobia is good for pressuring them into cleansing but wouldn‚Äôt rely on it as the affect is rather small and sometimes the power through it regardless.
---
Honestly I agree, i honestly didn't want them to touch her base power. Just her Omega blink add ons, and they can leave spirit how she is just remove prayer beads.
---
It literally isnt, at all, but people need to be babies about everything around here.
---
If a Nurse player wanted to play M1 killer, they'd switch to an M1 killer. That add on is just lazy...
---
Yes. And he walked to her house lmao. You can‚Äôt seriously sit here and be genuinely telling me that throughout all of these movies, he somehow wound up near Laurie like he had no idea...
---
So like, nobody knew about his ‚Äúobsession‚Äù like the comment you agreed with stated, yet the doctor drove near Laurie‚Äôs house. Like you‚Äôve just stated. Just out of nowhere, of course. This forced narrative right now... Jesus.
---
He's probably tired from the insane amount of content he puts out :(
---
Link please
---
r/unexpectedbullying
---
Break line of sight, stun him or force to break pallet on safe places. Killer should break safe pallet, because he'll never catch you even with bl3. learn which is safe and use it
---
People downvoting a news thread, lol
---
I'm just saying, I just got merciless killer up at rank 5. 2 red rank survivors were involved, tons of meta perks, 2 instaheal medkits. I was the wraith. I pretty much have garbage perks as the wraith. High ranks are nowhere near as oppressive as some of y'all like to think they are.
---
My only real question is why the hell does she need 3 bonus bloodpoint add ons (White Nit Comb, Dull Bracelet, Anxious Gasp)
---
"*you're not the first nerd ive eaten*"
---
We don't really have the details yet, my bet is that it's gonna be related to syringes and scyptics and maybe buffing the less used add ons like sponge.
---
So it's just a poorly balanced idea? It's more of a wall hack token than something a killer can rely on. A better suggestion would be a perk instead of a status which would apply an effect onto a player that destroyed said hex, If this player is hooked within X amount of time the destroyed hex would be recasted onto a dull totem with the levels determining the time before that effect expires. But for your ideas sake Additionally there's no deactivation time so there's no difference between survivors push through 2-3 gens with the hex or find it within 3 seconds which is pretty stupid. Disabling it after X amount of gens in addition to scraping the aura effect in place of both the survivor and killer seeing each others aura for 1 second would be more balanced. Your ability to balance ideas is equal to your ability to figure out who i main in dbd, Which is poor.
---
She's had 4 nerfs bro. She's had more attention than most other low tier killers.
---
Bud windows are broke right now
---
Wooooo yay now we only get to see Spirit at rank 1 because nobody bothered changing the reason everyone played Nurse in the first place this is exactly what I wanted wooooo
---
I think pressure with clown is quite easy and I do rather good with clown in purple/red ranks. But what concerns me is she wasn‚Äôt friendly to new players who wanted to pick her up, and she‚Äôs definitely not friendly to them now. The nurse has been known since the game launched to be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù killer in the game ONCE you master her. And I feel the survivors are complaining about her being ‚Äúoverpowered‚Äù and they‚Äôre slowly nerfing her down to silence their complaining about everything. It‚Äôs just a nostalgia thing for me ya know?
---
Rare? I get usually one per level past level 35. That's about as rare as chicken laying an egg.
---
I'm assuming this is a troll post? given that bubba is universally considered to be the worst killer in the game.
---
Spirit is the next best killer to current Nurse, so a lot of people think we will see even more spirits after these Nurse changes.
---
Not all of them just the one that came out in 2018. They changed the plot. Go rewatch it and take a closer look. Tell me one thing Myers does that shows he is after Laurie. He doesn‚Äôt try to find her. He goes to random houses in Haddonfield and kills people. 
---
The Sheriff ran him over in The suburbs and then the Dr. drove Michael out to Lauries house. Her house was the only thing around so of course Michael goes there to see if he can kill anyone. Not because Laurie was there.
---
You‚Äôre an actual 3head. Dont say bud, you‚Äôre 12 get a life and get good :)
---
Fair point! I mainly just use it only on stealth/small terror radius killers. PGTW would also be pretty clutch as well. Thanks for the advice!
---
Michael should have his own tier above Freddy. Dude is literally the personification of evil.
---
That may hurt the wait times to find matches though
---
I personally have the idea that they should just nerf swf or buff killer depending on if you‚Äôre facing a full swf or not
---
For example:
---
If you‚Äôre a 2 man swf, it‚Äôs normal 
---
3 man swf, you can only bring 3 perks into the match
---
4 man, only 2 perks 
---
OR
---
2 man swf normal
---
3 man, they have a slight penalty to repair/healing speed
---
4 man, bigger debuff to repair 
---
Something like that... I‚Äôd also suggest buffing killer based on the amount of swf, but that wouldn‚Äôt work for the solo player next to the swf
---
Ah I see
---
There are so many better options than second wind
---
Madness tier 4
---
People focus on the top loopers when discussing killers.  Most survivors are not good at looping.  That includes red rank.
---
Leatherface is very good against average survivors.  Follow the survivor until they make a mistake and it‚Äôs a free down.
---
I... i'm ok now... I just forgot my ritalin...
---
this is really adorable, you dont happen to do digital art of this do you? I'd love it as a lock screen but the lines are so feint
---
Gen speed is fine, I think they are adressing insta heals with the teased medkit changes.
---
Yes survivor Tbag me at the pallet you wasted. It will only make me stronger.
---
I agree we shouldn‚Äôt send feedback to the devs and just accept that the hardest killer to learn was nerfed to legion tier.
---
Hey we're getting a PTB meaning they could revert some thing that community doesn't like so have faith
---
I think he means out of game
---
If its not one thing, its another. Almost makes me regret following this subreddit but sometimes I see things that make it worth it.
---
Until there's multiple walls to break the distance and you gotta wait 9 seconds to 3 blink again.
---
Killers are in a strange spot, some of them are so powerful and oppressive when compared to others.
---
She shouldn‚Äôt be friendly to new players, spirit is friendly to new players and look how that ended up. Clown can‚Äôt apply gen pressure, I‚Äôm sorry but he has literal no gen pressure against average survivors.
---
Man i remember just how DARK the game used to be, the red stain was terrifying in the dark. RIP that for easier time for killers, it's nice but the atmosphere is SO lacking nowadays
---
I saw like ten iridescent head in one year I dont understand why the people cry so much for it
---
Noed op btw, lmao
---
And that is a valid and acceptable question. Its a lot more productive than this barrage of "RIP nurse" posts.
---
YouTube is where I found it.
---
No this was the day the servers went live
---
Woah what a great way to save the community there cocklips

The worst killer is Legion.
---
hahaha stupid meg stabbing herself
---
Question as someone interested in playing:
---
I saw the game on Xbox Game Pass and I remembered trailers including Ghostface and Michael Myers... However when I downloaded it said they were part of DLCs.
---
My question:  Is it possible to unlock DLC characters without spending actual money? (Like using a in-game currency)
---
Hey buddy, look at me again.
---
*Kamui*
---
Alright saggy tits
---
Good
---
3 blink needed to die. There was no skill in playing 3 blink nurse. Better useless than broken.
---
Yeah but that could honestly be kinda useful when trying to find survivors when theyre hiding.
---
You do understand that on console you can have parties on the actual system so regardless people would have been able to communicate.
---
Perhaps for your future installments you could use darker colours, and have a much more overwhelming killer sided presence because that's how the lore works
---
*Dash into a tree and die
---
Lol at all the survivors down voting me tho
---
Bc you missed the point of the post
---
He said something stupid and missed the point of the campaign anonymously and then got mad he got was getting downvotes and made a cringy edit, I dont know if "having balls" is part of it lol.
---
Legion is miles better than bubba. They for sure could use a little love, but they are nowhere near as bad as some folks claim.
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion but I love the idea of there being an addon that weakens a killer's power for higher bloodpoint gains. That said, only about half of them work, in my opinion. 
---
Although while I'm fine with it just weakening the power, I much prefer the addons that change a killer's power while increasing bloodpoint gains at the same time (Mirror Myers, Bodyblocker Hag) rather than the ones that just purely nerf them (Kid's Drawing Freddy, The Beast Wraith).
---
I think the bloodpoint addons they're introducing for Nurse are a start but I'd love for them to be more interesting. I can't really think of any ideas right now, but I will say I think that a similar bloodpoint gain effect should be added to one of her Ultra Rares.
---
I can only hope. But I just dont think I could bother playing this game anymore if they dont revert the base changes or at least give her 105% movement speed or something. It's going to be way to punishing especially on console with the whole 5 frames I get a second
---
Yeah that too. Console nurse players already have it hard enough. I put almost 1000 hours into this game on console before I moved to pc and nurse is a real pain to try to learn due to the low frame rate and the fact you use a controller as opposed to a keyboard
---
Also depends on the situation...
---
Maybe they were just goofing around, maybe they got sidetracked, maybe you got lucky. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying survivors are going to always be dominant, but if they WANT to, they can easily.
---
And I main survivor... even though I usually talk about killer more, tbh I play about 3-5 survivor games per every 1 killer game (so much less stressful being a survivor for me)
---
Wait what
---
I am specifically talking about this add on and how the LOS requirement would make her worse.
---
**DUDE THIS IS FUCKING SICK HOLY SHIT I HAD NO CLUE I WANTED THIS UNTIL NOW**
---
No, licensed characters have to be purchased with paid currency. Any original killers can be earned in game though
---
Yeah I was a bit iffy on that since it's such a small percentage. On the other hand, it's so easy to stack especially if they don't cleanse.
---
You can unlock non-liscenced killers with Iridescent Shards, which you get from leveling up. The liscenced killers (which include ghostface and myers) must be purchased with real money.
---
6second cooldown for 2 blinks.  If that includes her fatigue, it‚Äôs about 4.5 seconds, 1.5 second for her first blink.  You can still blink through walls, and completely don‚Äôt abide by normal game mechanics so..... she‚Äôs not ruined.  Still a top 2 killer in the game.
---
Miles better? How is a free borrowed time better. Oh, and if he misses thats a free decisive strike.
---
Its crazy, people act like killers aside from nurse, spirit, and billy are incapable of functioning at high ranks, which is pretty much just nonsense, and is scaring new players off for no reason.
---
Legion and Piggo need buffo
---
Nurse and Spirit need balanco
---
Mike Myers is perfecto
---
Th,,,,, thamks, dog,,,,,,,
---
Yeah but Loomis is just calling him a psychopath in a dramatic way.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. Thanks for the response tho.
---
Depends on how big the hotbox will be. I think not big enough to justify to be a green add on
---
I love the Matchbox addon but I'd love to see it make her 110% instead of 105%. I'm not sure if that'd be too strong, though.
---
Thank you for the response.
---
Stop over exaggeration.  Still a top 2 killer.
---
Mister ‚ÄúI post in the KSI sub‚Äù get fucked idiot
---
Lobsters are just long crabs. Change my mind.
---
She sure did, a true huntress has the eyes of a hawk
---
Piggo needs buff, Legion needs the Freddy treatment
---
Except its not a 9 second wait because you already have a 4 second fatigue. So if you blink 3 times. You'll come out of the fatigue with 1 blink prepared and another ready in 2 seconds. For the 3rd blink you'll have to wait another 3 seconds, but thats the price you pay for using a method that removes the skill requirement of aiming the blinks.
---
7 mins? try 20-30 boss. Welcome to the wonderful world of killer queue times
---
So basically what you feel when you face nurse is what every other killer in the game feels every game cept spirit?
---
Legion literally just injures people, but bubba can end the entire game in seconds
---
That's a really good point. I still think that it doesn't offer the same bang for your buck when compared to adrenaline.
---
This is the state of the game rn :(
---
Its actually refreshing to see people thinking with some logic today. I'm starting to see people realize just how wild the complaints are getting. I understand people think differently and are very emotionally attached to this game but its getting to a point where I feel hella bad for the devs.
---
Uhh, its not really a free borrowed time, at all? its a free wound on a healthy survivor if you know when to pop it, and, you can now force them to waste time dealing with their deep wounds, while you run off to deal with someone else. I'm by no means saying that legion is high tier, they arent. However a lot of these arguments about them being useless are completely ridiculous.
---
Behavior seem to be impressively bad at even trying to balance their own game. I so desperately want to like this game but they keep pulling shit like this with zero self awareness whatsoever. Literally all they had to do was remove the omega blink and alter the addons slightly but instead they've bodyslammed her potential into the fucking bedrock of the earth. A 92% speed killer who's power she relies on for movement having a power recharge that long is crippling and makes her completely unviable.
---
I think i've gotta say Nurse was less fun. It's the only killer that made teams just give up in high ranks on PC
---
Why you gotta put daddy clown at the bottom
---
i cant tell if this is sarcasm or not.
---
Interesting. How long ago did they tell us? I totally missed it.
---
Just wait until around Halloween, the DLC usually goes on sale around then
---
This looks like it would be the best fifteen cents I would ever spend!
---
Isn't myers literally evil in a human body? I'd call that top tier
---
Requesting a mode that's become an industry standard for almost every MP game is not ridiculous.
---
&gt; Gen speed is fine
---
And I'm saying, I dont think you've been paying much attention to legion mains? Because they do infact exist, and they can be pretty troublesome to deal with if they know what they are doing.
---
Can we get an F for Nurse?
---
deja vu
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/deqwbr/this_has_happened_a_surprising_amount_of_times/
---
If it makes you feel better in the past 6 games I‚Äôve played against the pig i died with 1 box left each time
---
Yeah there's a learning curve on her, although to be honest I got her blink ability down in 4 games (pc) 
---
I will miss those killers trying nurse out for the first time and just not understanding the blink control at all though, that was satisfying.
---
Unbreakable is the anti slugging perk. You stand right up. Bill.
---
Cute ;)
---
"Broken Mori" How about one that allows the killer to kill a survivor if another survivor was sacrificed within X amount of time. (Sorta like a MM Tier 3 effect), Survivors would be notified of its activation
---
It‚Äôs sounds abit like an evil washing machine at the beginning but I love it.
---
Bruh survivors literally can bully killers lol
---
Gen speed is still ridiculously quick. You use a single good toolbox, Prove Thyself and 3 people on a gen and it'll be done in less than 30 seconds.
---
Requesting? Do you think this is a restuarant where you can just request no tomato on your sandwich. I mean, you really are being ridiculous. Having communication with another survivor means absolute shit if the killer is playing the game well.
---
It said the timer starts when fatigue starts
---
Yeah Legion is an absolute meme rn
---
"Didn't make me laugh so it's not funny"
---
Yes, Legion is annoying, but he um isn't underpowered or overpowered
---
I'm just gonna come out and say that this theme of "haha Pig gets nerfed each patch" is getting really old. Stop acting like she's unplayable, her nerfs have been minimal and she's still just as viable as she was before.
---
Also its small but everyone seems to forget the buff that let her crouch and uncrouch smoother and lose less speed because of it
---
Then use a map offering when you use that addon. It's not like youre guranteed to get haddonfield every time you use it.
---
Bubba is a slower character in general. BBQ was designed for him. So he could see where other players were next. 
---
However, it will always depend on the map and luck when attempting to 360 to avoid the chainsaw. IF you're out in the open, chances are he's going to get you. But if your able to get around corners quickly, it can be avoided.
---
now add that every game 4 survivors earns bp and 1 killer earns bp
---
Not again
---
He‚Äôs low tier. No map pressure and a sub par power, he needs a full rework to put him anywhere above the depths of D-Tier rn
---
It's the only possible way you can even see the Claudette, the real time of this is so fast you'd never see it actually happening. I would've posted it as a "did you see it?" but was too lazy to edit it haha
---
nooooooooooooo
---
Spirits are loopable, the add-ons are disgusting tho
---
Most survivors even at red ranks are bad, this means you can regularly 4k with any killer. It's when you face actual good survivors that you need nurse/spirit.
---
Sacrifice each of whichever one you want I believe 25 times
---
Demogorgon is just a victim in his search for beans
---
Kill each of the OG four 25 times.
---
better than the alternative i guess ‚Äî completely ignoring their teammate.  If they go for the save they‚Äôll learn and get better, if they crouch on the edge of the map and sprint burst every time they hear a heartbeat they‚Äôll never improve lol.  but yah that can be annoying
---
Still dies to pallets, the strongest thing for survivors in the game, just like every other killer- oh wait except nurse and spirit the two best killers in the game.
---
Very cool
---
Holy shit the survivor mains are out right now. I guess idiots don‚Äôt understand what an asymmetrical game means. Why the fuck should survivor add ons be as strong as killer‚Äôs when it‚Äôs literally a 4v1. Use your brains.
---
That‚Äôs a pro tip right there.
---
You have to sac meg, dwight, jake, and claudette 25 times as Leatherface to get each of their faces
---
In my experience, people that call others "kids" aren't even old enough to buy alcohol.
---
You have to kill the survivor 25 times with leatherface to get the skin from that specific survivor.
---
Nurse wasnt even op tho, sure OmegaBlink, 3blink+range or 5blinks were op, but base nurse was in a completely fine state, but now 90% of her add ons are memes and her base power got gutted.
---
Gotta incentivize for killers!
---
Bubba should be Naive and Misguided.
---
I mean, yes, they are, but that's kind of the point. Escaping shouldn't be easy 
---
The worst killer, Legion, has a kill rate of 50%
---
Even the worst killer is statistically likely to tie...
---
What movie is this and where can I watch it?
---
You can't equate you not laughing to something not being funny. I don't have a problem with the joke and the fact that it's still getting posted and upvoted means nobody else does either
---
These add-ons are going to be forever maligned if they don't also adjust the BP maximums when you take them. Earning deviousness at a slightly faster rate isn't really going to be worth crippling your power for if you could otherwise max it out anyway. In fact, you should be aiming to max it out anyway, and the add-ons just reward poor play.
---
Basically, hitting the cap usually means you wasted a (4000-5000 BP?) add-on and gave yourself a handicap for almost no reason.
---
Essentially the creator mentioned every film after the first one was just money grabbing. Same with the ‚Äúbrother‚Äù reveal - it was added to the original movie‚Äôs tv release to give it extra runtime.
---
Just realized megface has smeared lipstick...
---
ah yes, not like this change will completely gut her map pressure or patrolling ability, oh wait it does. There was almost never a time you would miss your first two blinks to get a hit (unless you were shit) the only times you would actually consistently use back2back double blinks was to traverse the map...
---
instead of nerfing every single killer into the ground why not re-balance all of them so that any one of them can be viable options for winning? I mean, is it unreasonable to want a balanced roster of killers who's abilities lend themselves to different playstyles all of which can get a 4 kill game, instead of everyone going spirit because that's the only way to win?
---
further more, what was wrong with the nurse before? a slower movement speed, slower than survivors, meant she needed to rely entirely on her power to catch survivors, plus with a slight stun after each blink why do we need to wait for her blinks to recharge too? honestly the usefulness of this killer combined with the skill needed to properly utilize her made her feel pretty balanced to me.
---
If he starts chasing you, take him near a vault, if he revs his chainsaw? vault, literally nothing he can do about it. After negating that power, hes just an m1 killer, with no powers.
---
Undetectable status lasts only 16 seconds tho
---
Not far at all. It was fairly obvious from your reply. gg
---
Leatherface got down and dirty and then cut off her face
---
I'm very glad you didnt hurt yourself during that reach.
---
I think Legion should be broken up, Frank in Psychopaths and everyone else where Legion is now
---
Also the baby demo dog was shown to be able to be friendly with humans for candy
---
Gives an additional blink(s) but greatly increases exhaustion time?
---
You were right!
---
Bro you actually post about KSI, you're 12 get a life :) roflll
---
Whenever the argument isn‚Äôt going the way you want it to***
---
As a survivor, my biggest problem with self-care isn't efficiency, it's when people choose to self-heal in the corner of the map while no gens are getting done.
---
As a killer, my favorite thing about self-care is that people choose to self-heal in the corner of the map while no gens are getting done.
---
The hardest killers would be the lowest tiered ones, wouldn't they? It's harder to win as legion than nurse
---
Looks amazing
---
If we're comparing them at the height of their lore, Myers is objectively more evil than Freddy since he is the literal form of evil and is the only one that can defy the entity. Freddy does more evil things i suppose, but that doesnt knock Myers being evil itself.
---
Also I suppose, but Myers has no qualms killing children, he only spared one baby afaik and it was likely because it wasnt in his way or related to his obsession
---
I find the Torn Bookmarks LOS requirement a severe detriment.
---
Bring it on m8. DAVID KING IS GONNA LIVE FOREVA!
---
I ain't afraid of no floating sushi rolls
---
God I hate that.  I main survivor, and occasionally switch it up to killer to have chill games (i main spirit as killer...yeah, i know).
---
When I do play as spirit, though, I basically judge the way the survivors are playing.  So I have rules:
---
1.  If somebody pulls you off the hook in front of me, they're going down.  I will not ever chase the person pulled off the hook (unless they violated rule 3).
---
2.  If I'm constantly finding you not doing anything, you're going to die.
---
3.  If you teabag/flashlight click, don't be surprised if you get tunneled and camped.
---
That screaming addon honestly sounds trash. What‚Äôs even the point?
---
Common add ons will be like mini perks from now on. Just look at wraith!
---
Giving the nurse Stridor as an add on adds flavor to the teachable. She doesn't need the perk, but she can use and teach it
---
Whats with his facial expressions in general omegalul
---
Send feedback **after** playing the damn thing
---
And you're delusional if she's legion tier now, you're still able to blink over walls and you don't get pallet looped.
---
Susie mains (including me) prefer hot/cute over cool
---
Marlton is Dwight brother (Plot twist)
---
And it's a drag, a good player won't exactly be overwhelming, but can get the whole match mending, and then using self care and only then doing anything useful
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä **NURSE IS DEAD** ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
The post says the recharge starts when the fatigue starts and I would assume it stops when you charge a blink. So essentially if you blink twice, 3 second fatigue, 1 blink ready right off the bat, wait 3 seconds for your second one if you need it.
---
If you only use 1 blink you come out the fatigue 1 second away from getting it back
---
Annnnnndddd disconnect
---
Why are you so good to me?
---
I'm not worthy
---
And with scratched mirror myers you just have to avoid literally ever map except the game, lery's, and hawkins. Its an addon. Use it with a coldwind offering.
---
Isn't it a DBD meme to mori TTV's? You know? Because they are self-advertising??
---
Honestly I wouldn't like these changes at all. The unique thing about Spirit is that you don't know what she's doing at all times. If this part of her was removed, she'd be the most generic killer in the game besides leatherface
---
If you're going to nerf spirit, maybe give her a brief window after exiting haunting where she can't do damage or get grabs, she can still lunge to get the distance but no hitboxes would come out until after that brief window.
---
To be fair I just looked at the comments and saw u lol
---
You can see her legs just fine. Those are thin leggings.
---
doc is the cutest though
---
Why does every new killer power need to have a cooldown? Nurse, spirit, ghostface, demogorgon, legion, clown, Freddy... Next the chainsaw killers will have a gas meter.
---
I dunno he doesnt seem *Aggitated*
---
*Grabs Agarthan Device* |
---
          Dwight: ‚ÄúI wish I was in a locker‚Äù
---
Now, I'm not arguing that the Nurse changes are good, but I wanna address something. 
---
&gt;So apparently BHVR's answer to Nurse and Spirit being the only consistently viable killers at red ranks is not to buff the other killers, but to nerf them into the ground. Because mark my words, Spirit will be next.
---
Yeah, that's how games work dude. If you have one or two overpowered character compared to the other dozen or so, of course you try to nerf the OP ones. Why would you every try to bring every other character up when you can bring two of them down?
---
Again, not saying these are good changes, but it's clear Nurse does need some level of nerf.
---
We don‚Äôt have a dog. I think it was either a blanket or a rob
---
BP doesn't directly relate to rank
---
I have thousands of hours on BO2 and I'm so mad I never saw the resemblance before
---
Yes, corn, every killer's friend
---
You can stun the nurse with a well time pallet drop. And with how strong she was with 5 blinks, or Omega, you needed to high roll that stun to not go down every time.
---
I‚Äôm crying
---
Yet insta's still exist and not nerfed, The removal of 3 blink was far too much, 5 blink completely agree broken, 4 blink yea op as hell but theres still op addons via survivor, 3 blink was like a minor steroid compared to 4-5 blink and now its dead, and before you say thats good and all.......The overwhelming majority of her addons were GUTTED.
---
Gen speed is definitely not fine.
---
Dropping gen speed any more will just make playing survivor unbearable. It's already a massive plod to sit on a gen, if they make it any worse people just won't want to play.
---
That addon will be liked scratched mirror.
---
Except the opposite. You only use it with a coldwind offering instead of using it with a lery's
---
Honest opinion here. 
---
He sort of does have the potential to be a powerful killer at lower ranks but once you hit purples/red, you never see him. He‚Äôs sort of the laughing stock of the bunch now that Freddy‚Äôs viable. 
---
If you ask me, his potential strength lies in purely in Survivor mistakes. He does have opportunity there but survivors that are at least decent at looping and smart enough to not bunch together near a basement are easily able to stomp him. I think the fact that he has a power that is so dependent on survivor skill is a large part of what makes him a low-tier killer.
---
