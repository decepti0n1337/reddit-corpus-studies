Is this why in the patch notes they mentioned survivors now turning their head when you turn the camera? To justify this?

Ghostface hasn't been released. You have copious amounts of evidence it isn't in working order. You absolutely have the right to not immediately vomit money on a product that with ten seconds of research you can see isn't a good product.
---

---
Consumers have a right to a working product, but consumers have an obligation to look into shit before we buy it. Some of us have a hard time working ourselves up into a mad rage over a 10 dollar dlc we aren't going to buy until it looks like something we want.
---
Ghostface isn't a foodstuff that is going to make people sick. Ghostface isn't a piece of machinery that will break and cause harm. Ghostface isn't going to cost people their lives. It will cost people ten or so bucks and not be good.
---
I, and other people, are not giving them a "free pass" because we won't be buying the product and will continue to be wary of future dlcs. We are withholding money due to lack of confidence. A cornerstone of consumer power.
---
We just aren't losing our shit and going off about firing entire teams. 
---
Because it's just a fucking video game.
---
Please stop spamming multiple forums with the same things. We understand that you have strong opinions about this, but your stance is understood at this point.
---
Ey man by the end of next week it will all be over and we wont have to care for a hot minute
---
... Unlicensed merch?
---
I will try that thank you!
---
I love these types of moments
---
Yep I know. Until results day then imma bawl my eyes out
---
I’m scared to see what’s going to be on r/DBDgonewild with ghostface
---
I would Kermit suicide if that thing was coming at me . 🙈
---
Keyboard crash
---
I agree. Too much shirt.
---
[removed]
---
Thick
---
Same tho XDD
---
You'd rather hear an awkward teenager mumble the words?
---
Or we can just make the perk stun reasonable without Enduring and cap it at 3 seconds. It's really not that hard.
---
Also, that is not the only part of DS. You're forgetting about the survivor getting off the killer's shoulder. And like I said earlier, it's not always easy to remember all of that and how much time it's been since someone has been hooked without a timer.
---
Unfortunately the directional indicator is already in the game.  It is annoying that theres another killer that beats out stealth and the expected counterplay is looping... Feels bad man
---
Yeeeeettttt there go my grades. Im signing off dude imma reply when i can
---
I see this brought up a lot, but it just doesn't make sense. The killers are people, humans.
---
Space Coconut - Great Hag, Spirit, and other killer gameplay. I also enjoy his vlogs.  He has a quiet personality, which is kind of nice because Youtubers are usually over the top as af.
---
no0b3 -  Although I like his streams more than his videos, his videos are very funny and entertaining
---
Farmer John - Another funny boi
---
OhTofu - Great tutorials and gameplay reviews.  You'll learn a lot watching him.
---
Paulie Esther - If you don't go to Paulie for your DBD News and speculation you crazayyyyy
---
The King DBD - I like his speculation videos, but he puts out a variety of content as well
---
Hybrid Panda - Puts out a crazy amount of content and enjoyable personality
---
Monto -  Puts out a ton of creative content for both Killer and Survivor.  If you ain't watching Monto you crazy
---
which will in turn give you double blood points for everything in the game.
---
Moments like this is why i keep playing this game.
---
What part of the map did you find this?
---
Same

 It contains benzoweite, sodium and some other shit I can’t remember or pronounce
---
It's *would've my man
---
I thought he was wearing a cloak? I guess I’m stupid or something, I could have sworn it was a hooded cloak.
---
So currently in other languages it's the same as the wraith and the spirit... But with 'Face' on the end? Still seems kinda lame for everybody
---
It's even worse when you're a chase in someone cleanses it.
---
And? I dont  care. I'm trying to make it known thats all.
---
He was called The Ghost Face on ptb and i hope they fix it cause its bothering me. 
---
All killers get fucked by SWF so thats kinda pointless.
---
Potassium
---
Thank you for mentioning the corner. Very useful! Just realized I have problems with sharp corners too when I play as killer. Much appreciated. :)
---
Fred By Daylight
---
I’ll do that. Thanks for sharing your favorite streamers.
---
Can’t wait to t bag survivors
---
I have a joke among my friends where I constantly make cat puns, so I changed my autocorrect to fit it
---
Yeah the game would have to have a significantly slower pace for this kit to ever work.
---
They already are doing something though?
---
Well, when you put it that way, I agree with you. I wasn’t thinking about that past of the game, I’m newer, which you could tell. I know that they’ve tried some shady shit, all devs do but I didn’t know about that flashlight shit. Ghostface is a sad excuse for a killer and he could’ve been a lot better, Legion was completely unacceptable and they should’ve seen that way before the reveal even. I just want to trust that they know what they’re doing because so many dev teams have proven me wrong lmao.
---
Hes not wrong though. They are going to fix him.
---
Aight see you brother
---
Being one-hittable is better than being downed within 5 seconds of the Plague spotting you and vomiting in your general direction.
---
It’s probably because I’m new, but Death Garden is so much more complicated. 
---
Even with good dodging/mindtrick skills, there’s *nothing* I can do with a fucking **firehose** shooting bullets at me. Basically if you aren’t running Active Camo/Heal, you won’t last very long.
---
Oh? You’re approaching me?
---
Mind transcribing or summarizing the suggestion, for those of us who can't use Youtube?
---
And they will fix it before he comes out. They said so. Hes both bugged and they know what the main problems were.
---
I play solo 97% of the time and honestly when there’s 2 gens left, I do a quick run around the map looking for totems. I rarely get smacked with noed. I don’t mind the perk and find it a great counter to gen rushing.
---
I feel like that would be horrible. I'm more worried about my team doing totems than myself. The last thing I want to do is depend on people putting on an already underused perk. Having it baseline would encourage survivors to actually cleansing totems. It would also serve to slow the game down because they still wouldn't know if you have noed or not, so time would be spent looking for the totems. In addition, it would give players more of an incentive to cleanse if they see that only 2 or 3 totems are left. 
---
I don't believe noed should be nerfed, but I would say it is absolutely bloated. It 1) Slows the game down just by merely being a perk. The killer doesn't even have to equip it to benefit from this aspect. 2) Gives an instadown + speed boost 3) Can force survivors out early while securing at least one kill.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think having a totem counter would be fair considering everything, to be honest. Give solos something.
---
If you would like some help DM me, I'm not the OP but I do know how to put spreadsheets together that you can then use in your analyses.
---
You might want to edit the post and blur out the persons name. Pretty sure you are breaking one of the rules.
---
This is cringe at its finest.
---
What?
---
NO THINKING ALLOWED
---
Seeing the no aura thing kinda bummed me out. I'm trying to be open minded but I just really like current Freddy.
---
I don't know if you've noticed, but BHVR has kind of a reputation for taking a long time to fix stuff.
---
Huh? Stop being weird. 
---
OP asked what killer he should play next for teachables. I answered. 
---
If MYC works consistently on your wraith, you’re low rank or you proxy camp the hook outside of 32 meters. 
---
My statement still stands. MYC is not a consistently good perk on 14/15 killers.
---
That’s what I thought but it’s been a minute since I seen that episode! Would love that killer Krusty doll as a killer in DBD!
---
I know lol. It's a joke on the fact Billy's with NOED and Bamboozle are usually running those perks because they're not proficient with their chainsaw so they're effectively an "M1 killer". This subreddit and understanding jokes evidently don't go hand in hand.
---
Run Pharmacy instead.
---
Because congratulations! You are now stalking people.
---
The only way to unfuck us is to fuck the originally fucker that fucked us into this fucking mess so they can fuck off.
---
Alright buddy it’s time for you to join the others
---
It is true. But to that one survivor it seems genuinely unfair. They could be doing phenomenal the entire match, but then the killer got a boost of speed and can instadown them just because the killer sucked
---
Does the crouch movement speed addon increase his speed to 115 instead of 110?
---
It's a videogame mang.... careful not to stalk too many people because of it:p
---
That’s an amazing idea.  I would be down to run that if it were then case.
---
Yo mods, if you’re active on this post, could we maybe ban this psychopath?
---
Has happened to me. Tried healing a Claud and couldn’t, then when I got downed the killer left and she teabagged me cause she thought I was trolling. Shit sucked...
---
why the fuck does everyone complain about hex: ruin?  most the games i play as killer, ruin is either found in the first 30 seconds or the survivors work through it like i'm not even running it.
---
And they said they will do it right away. They also fixed MoM fast
---
If mew are running the same perks on feng min as mew are David king, they will be the same character with a different look. The only semi-arguable difference is some survivors are smaller which is better for immersed players
---
You're one of *those* people, huh?
---
Yeah, you're part of the problem.
---
I mean, it wasn't a very clear joke. It looked like you just thought M1 meant 'bad killer' since Bamboozle doesn't really have anything to do with Billy or being an M1
---
I love this.
---
Don't be salty. Blame steam for making it so incredibly easily to find other players. Just goes to show acting like a fucking idiot and being toxic can sometimes ruin your actual life. I can take your job from you.

So you're a stalker that is gathering purrson information. mew know that is in fact a crime, right? If mew arent already, mew should be a Myers main

I’d just rather not see some Internet tough guy prove to everyone that he has little social interaction in the real world by being a creep. 
---
Get a hobby. Peace.
---
BHVR does understand why it didn't work. It made stealth against Freddy pointless, which is the flip side of Freddy needing to slug Survivors more.
---
Rory you are so crazy talented!!!
---
Oof they called him the ghost face? That's so clunky and awful
---
Doesnt matter who you blame. When mew get arrested for harassment, stalking, and thievery of personal information from a disclosed site, mew wont be as cocky about it
---
Lmao but you wouldnt post yours here right?
---
Not my fault. just because you do it online shouldn't mean you are safe from punishment. Its not wrong, its justice. Talk shit, get fucking hit. Just because your sitting in your moms basement talking down to others shouldn't mean you are safe from repercussions. Lesson learned.
---
Maybe add in a little peach fuzz above those juicy lips. Just to complete it.
---
Not your fault for looking up their personal info and further harassing them?
---
And having it be bass line gives a lot of information for free without any sacrifice.
---
What's the point in using an underused Park when you got free information that just makes people hug a meta even more
---
PainReliver.
---
Honestly that would probably be balanced if it was just gen repair speed
---
Uh I’m not that good at drawing but thanks for the advice :)
---
I sure hope you're already on a list
---
Kobi % increases to 100% when you have a bad team and decide to kill yourself on hook with the killer still right in front of you. Otherwise it legit never happens.
---
No fucking way. I love u and this game
---
i don't see why they have to castrate him
---
No need to be sorry. I just didn't want to be misunderstood and neither did you :)
---
And if you haven't then I suggest you start sating it yourself. It's one of my favourite insults for toxic killers with crutch builds.
---
Honk Honk
---
F
---
Lol if 5 seconds is too devastating for you then get better at the counter play.
---
You're complaining about something that is absolutely completely avoidable. It doesn't need to be changed because it's hard when the killer gets a 5 second stun. That's the point, 5 second stun for the survivor to try to get away. 
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't reasonable.
---
If you run into them again, change to leatherface and show them how camping is really done.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought that pillow stroking was creepy
---
That's because most people are reddit survivor mains who run Sprint Burst and think they're gods. Sprint Burst never let's you use DH or the speed boost from BL. If you never consider Sprint Burst then combining Exhaustion perks is fine.
---
Another Object gamer I see. Truly one of our great members.
---
Console pleb.
---
.... that’s what the heartbeat is for
---
You just sound like a bad teammate
---
Maybe add a straight jacket from the asylum from Until Dawn
---
Hybrid Panda. His personality is refreshing and his legit excitement over new content makes me smile. Plus his gameplay videos helped me become a better survivor when I was starting out.
---
Hes bugged for starters.
---
I try not to insult others unless theyre really mean, but thank you for the advice, I'll give it to my friend who likes to trash talk a lot lol
---
Hah, I think this week I've had that happen twice where I wanted to depip or otherwise wanted out of the match and when I tried to suicide I end up doing a Kobe. 
---
On a side note Deliverance might be a good farming perk because a Kobe gives you 1000 (or was it 1500?) bloodpoints in Survival which usually is a pain to otherwise obtain.
---
We got a winner here, boys.
---
I love how the site you're using also tells you to not use the information for blackmail. Which is essentially what you are doing. 🤔
---
Thats the point entirely. Dont be a cocky asshole, and it wont happen to you :D
---
Ah thanks :) Hopefully I do win and so as the other contestants
---
Bhahahaha, triggered.
---
Dont harrass people in a game thinking you are invincible and you have nothing to worry about. Drop the fucking EGO ;D
---
Of course not then the mean internet people will find him. And that's just not ok. Kappa
---
Survivor has tons of usable perks wym lol, do you seriously think MoM didn't deserve to be nerfed?
---
Am I though? Or am I using it to warn cocky fucking assholes from DBD to not act tough, because in person when found, you are so fucking fragile.

Had a random group gay guy and his friend join a SWF lobby with a regular I used to play with and he constantly talked shit the whole match to the huntress cause he was getting tunneled for being the weak link ( call it like I see it) and legit the middle lady is me, he was still shit talking even in spectator mode lecturing the huntress about how she was getting less points for camping ( I told him she obviously didn’t care cause she was face camping)
---
 He got really triggered and told me I was being negative and I can take it elsewhere lol 
---
He was really triggered he couldn’t message her cause of her settings lecturing her gameplay and I’m just like... yea and you’re dead..
---
Id vote for this if we can have his arms look exactly like that in game
---
It's made worse by the fact that his name was much simpler, cooler, and thematically consistent in the dev build. 
---
The Ghost &gt; The Ghost Face
---
Maybe it's to make his Mori seem less suggestive?
---
Now you're just being an ass throwing insults
---
Happy birthday! I wouldn’t miss it in my dreams! Because i’d be dead!
---
3 take it or leave it
---
True but it’s just a starter concept. I liked the idea of the power for the most part.
---
Why are we shit talking Trapper daddy?
---
The only realistic way to balance the game and merge the gap between swf and solo players, give comms to all survivors every game, then balance the game around that, instead of having to balance things for solos and swfs, make every match a swf round basically, and buff killers accordingly
---
Sure but in general terms if a teammate comes to you for healing and there’s no obvious signs of a killer it’s in you best interest to heal them. Like at the very least just 99 the gen then heal them. 
---
And like it or not altruism is a big part of the game. You’re not going to get very far without it.
---
You should only use 360 as a last ditch effort it’s not a guarantee unless you have a good map and blendette type of survivor skin ie if you’re caught out in the open and have no other choice but if you know you could’ve done a better play just better to rework your tactics then worry about mastering 360
---
This is super great! Good job!
---
For context, he probably spent about a minute carrying me around to find hatch before all this because I never bother struggling when last alive and just let them have me. The entire time I knew he was just going to do that so I didn't struggle all that much, because a lot of killers have done that lately, but he dragged it out so much that I was laughing instead of getting mad. Set a record, honestly. 
---
I'm really not sure what killers want from me anymore, sometimes I just think us aussies are mean. It's ok to just kill me, guys, you win.
---
Do you not see him?
---
Anytime you’re going to a gen, looks for all pallets and good loops on your way. Remember those and then go back that way if the killer chases you.
---
This is a video game, Ghostface should be fun to play lol, he shouldn't be boring. Shit, even if he was a weak kilelr but FUN to play I would like it, right now he is weak and NOT fun to play
---
cool idea but survivors will create a secret code to counter this kind of power like 5-10 fast teabags to know you are the real survivor. would love to experience something like this tho :)
---
Love the Wendigo! Nice job!
---
I'd love frank west. Wouldn't want Rick though.
---
RnG sucks for alot ive trappers ive noticed, hag can SPAM traps and make survivors who even get unhooked have to crouch out of the basement, buying her alot of time to get back whereas a far away trapper has nothing to slow them down if the trap is disarmed
---
I don't trust this window at all for this reason.
---
Agreed. They were at the time already working on the licensing but were pressed to fulfill their self made chapter release deadlines. It’s personally why I hate when developers do dlc release this ways if they had delayed the release and just worked on Plague. They could have said that the chapter they were working on was not meeting their standard for release which they admitted for the most part because a lot of the devs hated Legion from the start. But greed always wins.
---
I wish iron maiden wasn't such a shit perk
---
IIRC = If I Remember Correctly
---
Well, at least when I use it. :p
---
They mentioned it jokingly but never addressed it directly or talked about changing it
---
They could make it the 1st non-power killer, and just give it an all around buff in most other aspects. Fastest non-power move speed, fastest vault/break speeds, heightened visuals on scratch marks/blood, heightened ability to hear sounds and more easily discerning directions of these things. Alternatively they can make that the power, and quickly allow it to ramp up where injuring/downing survivors greatly increases the duration.
---
I get what your saying. I feel like this concept is a good starter or easy concept idea. It would obviously need tweaking and isn’t perfect. (Which is probably why the devs didn’t go this route) To be fair the same thing can technically happen to The Pig sometimes.
---
Yeah it still works.
---
I like good freddy players, but looking at his averages can help determine how good he is. 1 god tier Nurse showing quad iridescent aint proof as to her being "god tier" vs my potato nurse
---
Information for solo players would not balance it out simply because a survive with friends group will always be able to communicate way more efficiently than any solo player can and there is no buff that can ever give solo players that ability.
---
And with communication they like the need for certain perks meaning they have more free time to put more viable perks or meta perks in their build as they don't have to sacrifice any slots.
---
Adding stuff to the baseline kid to try to bridge the gap will not work all it will do is make it even easier to communicate with each other and even harder for Killers as now survivors have a lot more information you bring everybody up but you don't actually close any gap.
---
Solo survivor take a step up with more information.
---
Swf are able to communicate a lot more efficiently as a lot of the knowledge they have to pass on becomes baseline so there's less room for communication error. So they too will step up keeping the gap the same
---
Ideas like this all good on paper but tend to be terrible in execution which is a common theme for dead by daylight.
---
Old surveillance was good on paper and it sounded like I've really unique and fun perk however using it efficiently even as Billy who has the best mobility was downright impossible
---
Another example is Legion the old Legion looks really good on paper these frantic killers with a dangerous flurry of attacks but I think we all know how they performed in execution
---
Reminds me of when Siege changed the Elite Rook's face and people hated it and the exact same issues came up.
---
I think old deja vu is better than this
---
Question, from a survivors pov, when they get stalked and marked, are they notified they are marked? If so, that goes against the entire idea of ghostface being a "jumpscare" killer as the devs put it
---
I guess it might be more efficient (possibly?) but ultimately I don’t think you can avoid any amount of people not liking the outcome. No real benefit to hiring an additional team when they can just keep doing what they’re doing; create concept, test internally/ptb, change over time if needed. 
---
Personally I don’t care too much about new killers flopping since I play both sides and am pretty easy to please gameplay wise (1300ish hours, I like what’s been done so far) so take that into account in my response.
---
Stop camping and tunneling, get good internet and survivors won't DC.
---
The lack of textures I guess
---
Don’t lie
---
That doesn't answer my question tho 🤔
---
I hate killers like that
---
Hadn't played in a while and decided to get back into it yesterday after some of my friends mentioned they'll probably pick it up now that it's on gamepass. For five games straight the killer hooked a survivor and then face camped.
---
I understand that newer players probably want to secure the sacrifice but I feel it just ruins the fun for everyone involved. It also puts you at a huge disadvantage when the other Survivors realize there's no point trying to go for the rescue. Those are just my thoughts though, other people may have their own opinion which is fair enough.
---
If you say so.
---
Big yikes to that guy
---
Actually if I think about it, yea you clearly haven't seen the movie. So I advise you to go watch it then we can talk.
---
Why do people get off on doing things just to upset other people? It's especially bad in this game by both killers and survivors. Like, we get it. You have mild brain damage and lack social awareness but can't you just keep it to yourself?
---
Sorry you had to deal with such a drawn-out end game. I had that happen to me once as killer before EGC came and haven't played killer since. Lol.
---
I disagree, but you are entitled to your opinion. I think this information is enough to help solos while serving as a slight buff to killers who don't even use noed. If survivors are encouraged to cleanse totems in my games (I don't even use noed), that is more time I get to spend applying map pressure without even having to take up another perk slot.  You are giving all these examples about how things don't work out and whatnot, but I would like for them to at least test it. I don't want to put down ideas simply because certain things haven't worked in the past. We cannot move forward that way.
---
Furthermore, I don't think having that information would change swf at all. Cleansing totems would still require you to look for them and depend on random people to actually break them all. The rest of what you wrote I am having trouble understanding to be honest.
---
why would you do this to yourself
---
Bus has been broken for sooooooooo long. When are they going to fix it
---
I dunno, stand still in front of a dropped pallet and some people buy it...
---
I had an idea like this, for a token version of noed, but in my version I didn't it turn it into utter garbage where you had to work for 10 hooks to get the effect we already have
---
GAAAAAH. I just want him to be good. Unlike Hag, his buffs weren't enough.
---
First and 3rd perk is kind of stupid.
---
Disgusted is a strong word. I found it mildly amusing, there is much worse stuff on the internet.
---
The Campers?!
---
add me to that list!
---
Yeah honestly I've been getting it a lot this week, had a Legion refuse to hook me because I wasn't struggling and did the same hatch thing to me, too. I know some killers exist to rile people up for hatemail but I never send salty messages so all they're getting is satisfaction of wasting all of our time? I'm sticking with the theory I get it worse for playing Quentin, seems to be a pattern. 
---
I appreciate the sympathy, sorry it happened to you as well. Never understood drawing it out or getting super smug, about either killing or surviving. Just leave or finish us so we can get to the next match, omg.
---
Its always a leatherface that does this shit isn't it? Lol
---
If they wanted to nerf NOED you'd get no opposition from me. There are other mechanics, powers, and perks for killers that I feel should be priority in terms of buffs. In fact if every killer was made viable then I feel NOED would barely be used and could be deleted from the game all together. I feel Killers use NOED mainly because the killer they are using isn't viable against a good team of survivors.
---
The solution to NOED to me was always to just buff the weak killers to at least Spirit levels, then delete NOED from the game since it won't be needed.
---
Man, you a saint
---
I literally had a survivor refuse the hatch yesterday. Two of his teammates disconnected and his buddy killed himself on the first hook. I knocked him down and carried him past the hatch and decided to be generous so dropped him literally on top of the thing. He just lay there for 30 seconds. I got bored so eventually picked him up and hooked him. You try to be nice to people Haha
---
Getting blood points itself is the fun part, people like to watch numbers go up
---
Pleaaaaaaaase, devs. There's too much investment in this game to not support cross saves.

Because you are just some nobody on reddit, why would I care about you lol? If you want to test it, look up MRBOOMBASTIC on steam, his email is right there. From there, its so easy.

Lobby dodging is in no way shape or form equal to dcing, lobby dodging doesn't ruin a game

Happy cake day
---
He's blocking Dwight at the generator, he just hasn't uncloaked yet.
---
Rude :(
---
Look how they massacred my boi.
---
Yeah, but the average DBD player is a nobody too.
---
In that situation I would have definitely just left and been thankful, that was nice of you to do. 
---
I'm very much used to people taunting me with the hatch with no intention to let me have a chance at it which is why I don't struggle anymore.
---
If I'm powerless I'll at least be able to tbag.
---
The amount of MEW's are cringey. Don't talk shit to strangers expecting zero consequences and you will never have anything to worry about. But just like talking shit IRL and getting your face bashed in, there are severe consequences to talking crap online. Dont talk shit, problem solved. You wouldn't do it to someones face, what makes you think your safe because your online Bwahahah.
---
Clone is good, and killers are slow and can't climb so running up walls helps a bunch too
---
Okay, and thanks! I really like your chibi Nea and spaceman Hillbilly. :D
---
Does drawing Huntress as the lead guitarist of a rock band sound interesting? Her axe would be her axe.
---
If not maybe Hillbilly dressed for a roller derby, Wraith for a ballet performance, or Nea as a Western gunslinger (but with a flashlight) would be fun?
---
Sorry if I'm a $h!t muse. :P
---
mew can say what mew want about them, it's still highly illegal
---
Meh, dont talk shit online and no worries. Pussy ass gamers wouldn't say half the shit they say online to peoples faces. So why should consequences be any different. Talk shit in person, get your ass beat. Talk shit online, get your ass beat. Lesson learned, bite your tongue :D
---
Please no I'm really bad at countering huntress as survivor
---
Yeah, let's completely ignore the fact that IV has a completely different survivor perk and item systems which separate survivors into different roles (i.e. some survivors excel in chases while others have increased healing/repairing speed).  
---
Identity V only made it work cause it restricted the powerful items' usage to certain survivors: sure, anyone can get the football from the chest but only Forward can stun the killer with it.  
---
For the "let's make an item that allows survivors to literally beat the shit outta the killer" concept to be somewhat balanced, you have to build a whole game around it which IV does and DbD does not.
---
Honestly I think this should be bannable. It's considered trolling and it's wrong. Killer like this are abusing the end game collapse and it's not fine at all. And I don't see why anyone would take up for it, I mean yes eventually it ends but that doesn't change the fact that the killer is TROLLING and ABUSING the game.
---
You would face the exact same justice IRL if you talked the same shit to someones face and they didn't like it. Why should you be able to say whatever you want online and not face consequence?
---
Exactly, they wont be missed and the mods/devs wont care. :]

Too bad, so sad. Don't act tough online and you have nothing to worry about :D.
---
Its illogical to argue with me. People who think they wont face consequences because they are hiding behind a PC deserve nothing worse.
---
Why not continue this conversation in the PM I sent you?
---
Pick up phone. Open YouTube. Watch a cool video. Unless they drop you ON the hatch then don’t even move around. Especially makes them upset. These pathetic players that take the game hostage want a reaction.
---
I mean like, that's just your opinion man, but for real, ok? What do you want us to say to this? "You dislike something we like, disgusting, prepare to forfiet your life" no one cares dude

For sure, next time I'm just going to watch youtube. I was already halfhearting it but I shouldn't have given him anything haha, you're absolutely right.

I love using spirits power in chases to end a chase in like 10 seconds
---
This is such a good idea!!
---
Can you also upload the template (red background) standalone?  I like the colour and would like to use it for all my perks.
---
Sorry you even had to endure that, just not fun. It’s only a game.
---
Damn good post, OP. 
---
BHVR, stop acting like your playerbase is full of 10 year olds that constantly need crutches to win games. The average gamer age is 18-36. We're use to playing much higher skilled games. Give us a little more credit, geesh.
---
Looks like the kidnap room from the original movie
---

Please BHVR, next killer be the Wendigo

I got reported by a whole lobby (Xbox) for moring 4 players lol. You're right. Players report you for anything you do, especially Killers.

YOUR THIRD GAME WAS SO RELATABLE FROM START TO FINISH, I LAUGHED OUT LOUD. SORRY FOR YOUR LUCK THOUGH LOL.
---
I tried doing it 2 days ago but it got removed because I didn’t have a flair... so I tried reposting yesterday and it once again got removed because the bot thought that I was reporting a bug. Finally I was able to post it today a couple hours ago.
---
I'm at 3 and they usually cleanse all the time. Some games they even reset the fountains they cleanse so much.
---
Anyways, great minds think alike ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I saw. My bad lol
---
OMG HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
it really seems like the pip system could use some reworking. both sides have to play with their food to get it right. why the fuck is the bronze devout so low on the bar! 4 hooks and you get 2 sections to pip with what in the absolute fuck
---
forget the skin, make this an actual killer! would love to see the abilities and how horrify this would be.
---
Thank you lol my first one.
---
It's less boring when you rev your chainsaw and sing that Tokyo Drift song while cutting some pretty tight corners
---
I don't doubt it.
---
I dont understand how they have a game where 1 1st person camera competes against 4 3rd person cameras, and cant be seen... thats just dumb.
---
No problem it’s a pretty common meme format.
---
Lol, no.
---
Something about this photo is just so calming :) wonderful work!
---
How? The game is ending. They're not abusing anything. Trolling? Maybe. Abusing? No.
---
Honk^honk

&gt;!bitches!&lt;

Good on you mate, that was kind.

That was awesome. That last second death, *ouch*.

I hope its real so bad :(

The feels would hit me if i boot up DbD on the 18th and hear a DbD birthday song lol

"News"
---
You’re right. Ghost Face isn’t Scream. The movie is called Scream, the character is “Ghostface” without a space in the movies.
---
NOED, Ruin, Dying Light, Thanatophobia... Survivors just loooove that combo 😂
---
Edit what comment? The one where he says
---
&gt;As soon as i rebooted my game it dissapeared
---
Also how it probably worked is i used an offering to play as freddie the game never loaded in and threw me back into the main menu as freddie
---
?
---
Run Windows of Opportunity... I’m a fairly new player and it’s my favorite perk. I know it’s far from meta and most long-time players don’t need it, but it’s a huge crutch for me in chases. I feel useless without it.
---
Mayhem meme will never die.
---
wait what about  nea with a dress
---
Can't blame them for suggesting a redesign. Who would have thought that giving a "STEALTH" killer a lot of audio cue for doing "STEALTHY" actions is a good counter play.
---
The game is working for you?
---
Do a 180, hold "W" when your character facing the screen and start to mash A and D in a particular rhythm. 
---
Is hard in the beginning but you can practice like a fighting game.
---
Yes?
---
but thats not what they did
---
I cant stop laughing at this lmaooo
---
RBTs don't activate anymore after the last generator. Traps need to be activated to kill survivors leaving through the exit gates
---
If the'yve a trap on before the last generator is completed,  the trap will activate after its completed.  
---
However any trap placed on someone after the gates are powered (all gens done) will no longer activate, meaning survivors can escape through the gates with un-activated RBTs
---
My friend and I are experiencing an “Initialization Error”
---
Uh nea is the entity and the entity doesn’t need a dress :/
---
Im in tears after watching this gif lol
---
I prefer Rancor. No worrying about the totems which are often gone in 30 seconds of the match starting, survivors won't realize you're running it until it's too late if they don't recognize the aura reveal after every gen, and if worst comes to worst you can just chase the obsession for 5 gens, then as soon as the last gen pops insta-down and Mori.
---
Legit my favorite thing about Rancor is just how much less of a hassle Mori dailies are if you abuse it.
---
Same here, hope it’s fixed soon
---
*they're wearing
---
Thatd be so bloody creepyyyy
---
Same it is so annoying
---
Honestly, only Frank West really fits in with DBD because of all the random Psycho killers in Dead Rising. None of the other ones fit. Rick Grimes is a maybe if you consider Negan, but then it just sort of defeats the point of the respective franchise's core focus: zombies. Same could be said for Dead Rising I guess though.
---
To be honest, I don't really want any of these people in the game.
---
That’s weird. My game is working fine. Maybe there is an update you have to install?
---
Try restarting the game or your Xbox.
---
Both and also your death if 3 injured people are self caring while you’re in a hook
---
I laughed out loud next to my gf while she was reading a book and scared her 😂😭 its too perfect, wtf is this from?
---
Both pig and myers just be like k then
---
Damn i uninstalled cause I kept getting that error message lol :/ can't download it on the store gives me an error
---
Cause they think i'm new and don't understand about keys. Only 2 people gave me a good answer.
---
We do not stan clickbait titles
---
*Getting stuck on trees intensifies*
---
Then it would be broken as shit. You already get bloodlust from maintaining a chase.
---
This is amazing\~ I'd love to have a wendigo killer
---
Where’s the love for my boy PainRelievers?
---
BVHR would just fuck it up.
---
I got it from twitter lol
---
She is a drag queen called Mayhem Miller. She was on a season on RuPaul’s Drag Race. 
---
This is from one of her legendary numbers she has been performing for years at Mickeys Bar in West Hollywood.
---
b u t
---
maybe if they put some effort, maybe not but honestly what they had been doing yea lol
---
Fine if the entity wants a dress the entity can be fancy
---
This is actually a really nice concept :)
---
They've seen it a lot the past 2 days, it's a shame, really.
---
My game is working fine. That’s very weird man. I hope it gets fixed for you.
---
Yup. They want to win every game as if a survivor doesn't have to eacape
---
Lmao this gif is really popular on twitter
---
This was my personal choice and pick out of the ones I’ve seen. Not like it matters anyways

Why petscop?

I hope you win this is the best one I've seen so far!

We most likely won't get the wendigo as a killer...

So basically what we already knew, run tampered timer and jigsaw box. Then play her like any other m1 killer with spirit fury, ruin, enduring and sloppy, apply traps immediately.
---
Yeah, I think you are in the minority here. While some of their changes they do on their own turn out OK like the pop goes the weasel change. Almost every killer in the past year has come out and we knew exactly how to change them to make them good. Except for Legion because his power was so stupid to begin with. This team would be able to tell them that Legion's power would have been broken and unfun, but instead they went with it and now half a year later he is still in a really bad spot.
---
And this. This right here is why I bully killers with absolutely no prejudice. This is why I bring a haddonfield offering, and my entire SWF brings BL, and we all bring commodious boxes, and use pink hair Nea. Basically every game. Not risking having my entire mood ruined
---
True, makes sense.
---
WHEN PLAYING NURSE I JUST WANT TO TURN THE GAME OFF BECAUSE OF THE STRESS IT GIVES ME

I see that XD

This is the better dbd version of this template

The crouching and the response got me and idk why but thank you xD
---
Survivors screaming from a thrown bottle as clown is map-wide if you wanna count that
---
Welllll this one is better.
---
Don’t teabag and I wouldn’t care tbh but thanks
---
I was going to say that
---
Same here
---
None.
---
Time waster.
---
I’d rather have Lee over Rick. It’d be cool to have a one armed survivor

She looks really happy
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
I hate that I get killer missions so much, they just end up being farming matches because even at rank 4-2, I get survivors who play like goblins.
---
There's always a bias. And with the average maturity of this community and the diversity of its opinions, I wouldn't put my trust on a handful of players to decide what should be developed or not.
---
There's a Medusa Hag!?
---
I slugged an Adam today and he crawled all the way to the exit gates during Endgame after I forced the last other person out.  So instead of being a dick, I just let him race against the endgame timer and he won haha crawled out before the Entity got him.

Downvoted for saying some dumb shit
---
I love the JoJo memes on this reddit
---
and on top of that, self care 2 and 3 make you use less of your medkit while healing yourself. it's not that you... run self care to not take a med kit...
---
A fellow Quentin o:
---
Yeah I’ve noticed people sometimes expect you to do this so when I want to give people the gate/hatch I’ll back away so I can’t grab them or chainsaw/teleport away
---
Balanced Landing can create almost infinite loops. I have used it as a survivor &amp; faced it as a killer. Unfortunately, it only works on certain maps. But when it works, IT WORKS.
---
Yes officer, this post right here.
---
This, which is kind of silly now since the killer can just finish the gate themselves.
---
Nah as a Freddy killer main I experience the teabag all the time and I deal with it. this is just his way of teabaging. All in good spirit.
---
What a little bitch. I hate killers like this that like to suck the fun out of everything. Like... get a life? Maybe some friends? Stop being a dick to people you don’t know online??
---
It's weird when survivors are nice.
---
I don't teabag you, Fred. :( That's mean.
---
I just want to live my life.
---
A wendigo is a brilliant idea!
---
dude what...
---
Alien I could ALMOST see because the first film is much more of a horror film than it is action like the other examples you sited. 
---
That said, they prolly don’t belong regardless.
---
This is awesome! 😆 needs for upvotes
---
love to see a p3 billy doing these carefree things
---
I remember when some people used to say “but killers can’t be toxic” and things to that effect.
---
It’s cyclic, if people behave this way then survivors will be toxic back and vice versa. At a certain point people just no longer care about the fun of others.
---
This is the kind of blatant and pure toxic behavior that should honestly be punished. I’m not one to care about tbagging and taunting and flashlights. But this right here is cancer.
---
Watched a video by Monto where he found 3 pink keys and a purple key in a single match.
---
Maybe if gens didn't go at lightning speed and survivors aren't running MOM, DS, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, etc. etc. etc., every game, there'd be more killer variety at high ranks.
---
I thought Plunderer's only gave sight of chests, i'm beyond surprised and thankful for these numbers.
---
Stop no please not in this damn horror game I'd be fine if they just throw in a bio of a new character and add it subtlety but a character that the only thing that makes the character unique is being a drag queen would legit make me grab a knife and gut myself like a fish.
---
This kind of killer suits the thing way better than scream.
---
Is there a single good movie killer who isn’t Meyers? Pig has to be the closest to functional at this point.
---
I mean with the introduction of the archive I can see this happening. 
---
Not that it really matters in the grand scheme of things.
---
I find it comical that you were pretty much the biggest baby on the sub when it came to survivors not leaving immediately and the killer having to take 15 seconds to go the gate and run them out. Yet, this appears to be fine to you. What a hypocrite!! Lol
---
i hope you win
---
Thank you :)
---
DO YOU THINK FREDDY'S BETTER OR GHOSTY'S BETTER?
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOO XDDDDDDDD
---
omg that's a good idea. I just bought the perk, too, so I'm going to run it.
---
To be honest I wish his power was he can randomly call a person and there phone would ring each character having a different like nea could have a touchscreen phone while feng could have a cutesy flip phone with little bunny rabbit charm and if they dont turn off there phone 5 seconds or more they will be revealed 10 seconds or more they will be in the exposed state idk I just thought it be a better power then the one has got
---
This is literally just the normal basement build you can run on anyone so I don’t know what the point of this post was.
---
eh depends if the next couple survivors are non licensed
---
I play on dial up pleb cus I ain't no bitch!
---
after seeing all the comments im beginning to worry about the state of the game (again) so yeah this game sucks complete dick but i keep playing it
---
Agreed. DBD is a horror/slasher game based off of 80's slasher films. It is not a sci-fi film. The problem is that quite a few sci-fi films bleed into the horror genre, so people kind of mix them together.
---
Why is the General Sam from YouTube
---
okay what the fuck did i just read
---
It'll probably happen in the Archives though...
---
I'd be surprised if not a single characters background hints at it. Especially DbD where they try to add a unique type of character every time.
---
What? You’re talking about saminations
---
STOP FUCKING FARMING HOOKS
---
Rick Grimes would be my permanent Main because I've watched TWD since I was 10, Rick is one of my favorite characters from anything and I would definitely try and get every cosmetic for him even if they were all real money.
---
I don't think they'll ever have a Walking Dead Chapter, especially with Rick Grimes in it but if they did it'd be awesome
---
Hey, OP.
---
Did you know you can’t spell?
---
Hey, guys—let’s point at OP and criticize his spelling!
---
I don't really understand why anyone has a negative view of drag queens, but go off I guess. I'm not here to argue. I will say the animosity men face for being feminine baffles me.
---
Where’s the 10fps sticker?
---
no, its annoying. not more, not less.
---
Having that stuff shoved in your face everywhere and forcing it on things just to make it appeal to the general opinion, like Soldier 76 in Overwatch or basically everyone in Harry Potter.
---
I have absolutely nothing against gay or trans People, in fact I couldnt care less what you do with your dick(or whatever) but it gets tiring to have it shoved in your face, and having to treat it like something special
---
Thanks man, I've been facing new grievances since EGC and it's good advice.
---
very rude

&gt;it’s full, duplicitous power

Jake has cirrhosis of the liver.
---
outstanding move.
---
Let me counter: They aren't
---
I like kate's new bloody hair, she look badass.
---
This is spooky as hell and I love it!
---
Botany Knowledge is a better pair for a medkit since it has a better efficiency boost and it also increases the speed at which you heal other Survivors. 
---
It's a somewhat underrated perk IMO and way better than Self-Care.
---
the J in Jake stands for Jaundice
---
r/wholesomesurvivors
---
How often is it shoved in your face in a society where your sexuality is considered the default/norm? Literally 90% of characters in shows, movies, books, and *video games* are heterosexual. Straight realtionships and sexuality is literally portrayed in every form of media, constantly. Throw in one token gay character though and it's just too much though, right?
---
Why does it matter. I can live my whole life without caring wether the character I play as in a video game likes men or not, lol.
---
Well, at least I can play many different games, good exclusives and easy headset set up with friends lol
---
YES! BHVR PLZ!!
---
I love that come back. The made up rules that survivors expect us to follow. SMH.
---
Not unless you try to sell the shirt or claim you made it.
---
How? That is sick tho geeeeez
---
As a Doctor main I envy you. I almost never get that map, Jigsaw Pieces are hella rare on my bloodweb and whenever I burn them another survivor burns a map offering and I end up getting sent there instead.
---
Instead of running away, you're coming right towards me?
---
I have over 500 split up between my survivors. With Jeff having over 150.
---
leatherface or myers
---
I like your totem idea, similar to how thrill of the hunt works. Maybe make it a perk though instead of just the default. Also, when noed becomes active, show it onscreen immediately instead of waiting until someone gets hit.
---
By acting weird what do you mean specifically?
---
I always thought Nurse was the absolute worst but I hear there was a patch during the time I stopped playing that makes her 1 hit everyone?
---
Honestly Spirit, The Hag, and The Trapper, The Clown, Legion, and Michael Myers all feel very OP to me. 
---
I only use Huntress. Kind of boring and not the best killer but not the worst either. Have to actually land the hatchet throws which is admittedly pretty easy when people go for pallets but otherwise the games choppy framerate and twitchy animations makes it tough. Unlike some of the douchy killers I've played against, I like to give survivors a sporting chance most the time since the devs seem to hate survivors.
---
Only exception is when I encounter a team of like 4 Claudettes with toolboxes or some shit like that and then I know I'm in for a bad time. Especially if I get fucking Lampkin Lane. Mightaswell DC there.
---
Gay people CAN'T do what they want. Even in first world countries people still face discrimination. Let alone third world countries or theocracies.
---
I get your argument. It's just a bad one.
---
damn this is way better than mine
---
No, that's exactly how that works otherwise artists themselves wouldn't be allowed to sell their own works because anyone in possession of intellectual property could be accused of violating copyright for no other reason than possessing it.
---
For example, if I buy a Harry Potter book, J.K. Rowling can't come to my house and accuse me of violating copyright law unless I  
---
(1) - Republish the book with my name on it  
---
(2) - Make/Sell the book(s) without paying the copyright holder
---
Among other things, but you get the idea. I can make that shirt and wear it around but a website stocking and selling it without permission from Dead by Daylight / Freddy Krueger copyright holder, ect. would be legally liable.
---
It was really funny. No idea what triggered it. The match was about 3-4 mins old.
---
This happened to me once. Just had to restart the game.
---
That's why my farming build is Self Care, Deliverance, Borrowed Time, and WGLF.
---
 distressing doesn't help you at all, because nurse doesn't benefit from having a larger terror radius. go with noed
---
yes, it could. more details tho?
---
I love this idea. Even just give the overall buff a name and call it a power. Maybe even make it a little like Myers, where you can activate it for intervals.  "Inhuman Ferocity": Your primal rage courses through your veins, toughening your skin and sending power through your body. Upon activation, for 45 seconds, your speed is increased by 5%, stun effects are reduced by an additional 50%, generator and pallet breaking speeds are increased by 75%. Scratch marks are considerably more visible, and last for 3 seconds longer. Survivor audio cues are considerably more noticeable, and all injured survivors' auras are revealed at a distance of 32 meters or greater.
---
Lmao
---
Thanks for the help, just got noed
---
Spirit is super OP. I was thinking of buying her but I dont want people to quit every game. The Pig looks fun. Myers is always fun cuz you have no heartbeat to start and then you just stall people and get like faster attacks and eventually one hit downs.
---
Since both are licensed, don’t you need to pay with them with real money?
---
Sorry I didn't ask this earlier but what is the exposed status
---
Oh wow! That’s me and my boyfriend in that match!
---
Nurse has high skill ceiling. i can't play her for shit. Billy is literally nothing, right now since Legion change easiest to play as killer.
---
I'm all ears gives you a 6-second aura reading for survivors who fast vault/medium vault outside your terror radius with a 40-second cooldown.
---
Survivors will very rarely fast vault outside your terror radius unless they have quick and quiet which is rare. If survivors actually do fast vault then you get a notification already so the aura reading is redundant. 
---
It's a perk that serves no real purpose and is outclassed by every other tracking perk in the game.
---
Yeah I get that one too. Almost never get The Japanese one which is my favorite. Havemt seen The Huntress's map in months. Dont even know what Legions map is unless its the winter map I saw a total of 1 times.
---
Tbh I'm not ganna read this, sorry
---
Downvoting jojo is a sin
---
TL:DR - Fair Use is a thing
---
Good thinking.
---
They are more scared of giving survivors good perks, but I do agree their recent killers (with the exception of the spirit) don’t scare me. Legion is honestly a joke in most cases and the scariest thing about the clown is his base speed
---
If you're the last remaining healthy survivor, open the gate first before you attempt a rescue. If there are other survivors able to assist in rescuing, then 99% the gate so you can work out the game plan with the rest to rescue.
---
Looks like she wants to speak to my manager
---
You on PS4 or PC? I thought Nurse is free, at least on PC she is (Alongside Huntress)
---
Doctor's a great killer to pick up n' play considering he can find survivors super fast and his power can be decent in chases if you can time the zap at vaults or pallets for free hits. He also farms points like crazy and survivors find him very annoying which I like.
---
Just level your trapper to 30 so you can get Unnerving Presence as it greatly enhances Doctor's ability to make the Skill Checks extra frustrating for survivors.
---
My advice would be having them watch content on YouTube. Or, you could not play for a bit after rank reset (a couple days) and you should get less experienced killers. My preference would be youtube.
---
On ps4 if I hear a nurse, it's free bloodpoints. I've never seen a good one and I sure cant play her well.
---
basically wasting everyone's time, dunno why would he do that either way
---
I find spirit more fun to play. And that's what matters, playing boring killers just because they're strong is not for me.
---
Thanatophobia is not a good perk, btw.
---
“It’s my lobby bitch” ahahaha
---
THE HOOKERS.
---
How is his power any worse? Lol like, for real?
---
Where do people get these made up rules from haha
---
It’s entirely up to the killer but to complain saying all last alive get the hatch is comical.
---
I only ever give the hatch to the last if I feel like they’ve either played well and weren’t toxic, or if were let down by their team trying to screw them over by farming them on hooks etc
---
I main michael, and i believe i will always main him, but i have recently like the clown and trapper.
---
Getting yourself down in front of the exit sure fucking feels like a 7 page MUDA
---
Preach !!
---
PC, sorry. Good to know, thank you
---
I always thought Nurse is free on all platforms. So you should buy Spirit. But she's not S-tier, at least on PC. Here S-tier is for one killer only, and it's Nurse
---
Nurse - Blinking through walls and pallets completely negate the looping mechanic designed to waste time. A good nurse can almost always end a game swiftly. PC aiming offers a monumental advantage to joystick aiming.
---
Billy - Speed boost and 1 hit down with his power as well as accelerated pallet breaking.
---
Platforms matter. Not sure how consoles fair but nurse is easily meta tier on PC along with Billy. I'd advise watching gameplay, perhaps on twitch or youtube.
---
&gt; The Pig looks fun. Myers is always fun cuz you have no heartbeat to start and then you just stall people and get like faster attacks and eventually one hit downs.
---
But they're licensed killers and can't be unlocked with shards.
---
Any clip where you get to hear Amanda's stun noise is a happy oink in my book.
---
WELL TBF MOM HAS ITS NERF NOW AND LEGION IS A BIT BETTER THAN BAS M1 KILLERS BUT YEA THEY DROPPED THE BALL
---
This. Billy needs large open spaced maps to do his chainsaw around. He’s good on pretty much all Maps except from the hospital and the meat plant
---
we not gonna point out they have progress on a new ritual...
---
If survivors do all the outer gens one by one, it shrinks the area killer needs to patrol to find survivors on gens. If the only gens remaining are 3 very close to each other, it means survivors have 3 gen'd themselves. It makes it extremely hard to get the remaining gens done without taking hits and potentially dying. So some survivors (I do it too sometimes), keep gens at 99% ready to pop so killer still has to patrol to those gens, do the center gens, once center gens are ready to go, pop it all at once and head for exits. That's usually the use of gen rushing in my opinion.
---
So just a heads up, you can hit reply under a comment so you create a thread instead of making a new comment. Second, I wouldn’t replace any of those with Kindred. They are all better perks. I would honestly recommend trying out what you like and seeing what sticks though. That’s part of the fun when you’re new at the game.
---
Play well and not be a bitch = hatch
---
&gt; Pre-rework freddy was fucking fine
---
This is absolutely untrue.
---
&gt; people just played him like an M1 killer then said he was bad
---
This I agree with (for the most part I think people hugely over exaggerate how weak Freddy is).
---
I'm very scared about the Freddy Rework now too, but you cannot say he was fine before.
---
Adrenaline, skillcheck RNG, and the transition time were all grevious annoyances that plagued Old Freddy. He needed a rework, and I think we should wait for him to actually release before we start calling this a nerf.
---
All that said I understand where you're coming from. 
---
I loved Freddy's old power; he was literally the only Killer in the game who could slow down all Survivor actions with his base kit and playing him was a ton of fun for me once I actually learned how to play him. 
---
I'm honestly really sad to see it go.
---
&gt; Survivors dcing on first down, survivors dcing on 3 mans &amp; bad maps aren't, Killers dcing from being looped, being blinded, whatever, they aren't willing to play the game as it exists.
---
Facecamping exists, it's part of the game. It doesn't matter if you personally like it or not, it's there. So for me DCing against facecamping killer is no different than DCing on first down or after losing Ruin.
---
&gt; Facecamping also...isn't fun. I can't imagine it is.
---
Fun is subjective. I can't imagine playing Clown is fun, but that's just me. And for some people it's not the process of facecamping that's fun, but the thought that they're ruining other's fun.
---
I think we're going in circles here. It's quite clear that our points of view won't change after this discussion. So, have a good day and good luck in the Fog.
---
That's not hostage. Yes the game is being dragged out but it still ends. Hostage is bodyblocking in the basement or reaching an unreachable spot as survivor and refusing to leave, etc. 
---
Hell if a killer slugged everyone and just let them bleed out without hooking anyone that wouldn't be hostage either as the game state still will progress. Hostage is a situation where the only option is for a player to disconnect.
---
Spirit for the mindgames
---
Sounds like you might be VAC banned from this. Might want to fix it.
---
lmao. It would be perfect if you could make that BLOOP! Sound when you turned so the killer could know "Bitch, I see you hoe. I ain't scared"
---
Adrenaline plagues every killer but yes skillcheck RNG is a pain. The 7 seconds just gives mindgame potential IMO. I think freddy now is a fine mid or upper mid killer. This rework will make him much less unique and could just be a nerf.
---
Doesn’t Wraith entering stealth create a wooshing noise that is global.
---
It's not an efficient way to play killer. You get less bloodpoints, and vs smart survivors your Emblem score will suffer. But against weaker survivors it works.
---
They could at least touch up her night out hair.
---
Billy isn't great in the hospital or any building map really. He is good when there is a lot of room to move. Of course, if you master him, then he is pretty viable anywhere. 
---
Assuming you only have the starter killers, I say play Huntress. She is a good killer that isn't considered OP and offers a different play style thanks to her throwing hatchets. If you want something that offers more of a challenge, play Wraith, aka the Bing Bong Boy. He is a (almost) invisible killer that can put pressure on the survivors early on. 
---
If you do have all the killers and want to hate yourself, play the Plague. I love her ability, but it's pretty bad in actual game play. She basically throws up on everything, poisons the survivors and then that's it. She doesn't offer anything that helps in a chase like a lot of other killers do.  
---
As a killer, it's important to learn how to mind game and when to give up on a chase. If gens are popping off and you been chasing the same guy forever, just give up and go after somewhere different. Another useful tip is DO NOT respect pallets. If you think someone is going to smack you with a pallet, then try to lunge through it to get a hit. Don't just sit there and wait for them to throw it down.
---
Not risking your entire mood being ruined so you just ruin other people's moods. Not all killers are the same dude. You're probably the survivor equivlant of the guy in the video.
---
I’d recommend buying the Leatherface DLC as he has three good perks and, contrary to popular belief, isn’t bad.
---
Bond is great. Dead Hard also. You could also use Spine Chill (pretty much a must have).
---
Brown = common
---
yellow = uncommon
---
Green = rare
---
Purple= very rare
---
red = fucking rare
---
No chat, but there is a gamemode called Survive With Friends, which puts you and your friend in survivor matches together and on PS4 at least, needs a party to activate.
---
I think Switch is compatible with PS4 but i don’t know
---
This has happened to me many times since End Game Collapse. Heck, even before that I had a several killers who would taunt me with the hatch despite never tbagging or being toxic during the match. Just goes to show toxicity exists on both sides.
---
You better believe if all killers could teabag, they would do it just as much as survivors to BM.
---
Yeah honestly, this is too cool just to be a skin that I'll never see in game. Give me some more bestial killers! Variety is the spice of life after all.
---
NOED is better, but I wouldn't use it on Nurse, she's strong enough without it.
---
Feng Min looks so much better!
---
That is NOT the rule. Never come to expect a courtesy. That spoils the spirit of the gesture.
---
Right?!
---
The only thing I give the survivor is a shift death
---
Ooh thank you very much for the informative answer 🙇🏻‍♂️ which characters are decisive strike and adrenaline from?
---
Is there also a sequence of characters to rank up first?
---
The __next time you heal back to full health__, your Aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are farther than 12/14/16 metres from the Killer.
---
Mettle of Man will __deactivate the next time you are put into the Dying State__.
---
Im having the same problem, i have rwstarted both my game, and my xbox multiple times and still nothing, im pretty sure its just something wrong with xbox's side and it will fix by tommorow
---
Nea's green hair looked awful before. Nothing like on the render picture and more like a bad wig with a bad hairline.
---
As the others have already said: go after the unhooker, not the unhooked. It is really not difficult. You can completely negate the DS stun.
---
Think of it like this:
---
You are not going after the easier kill, because the player might have DS. The easier kill would therefore be someone else.
---
Maybe they aren't F tier, but they aren't very good either and for me, they are pretty boring.
---
Freddy can kill people in the real world. He just weakens them in dreams.
---
My pleasure! Decisive strike is a Laurie Strode perk, and Adrenaline is a Meg perk. I would recommend leveling David up first because one of his perks gives you bonus blood points if you get saves, and he has dead hard (like I said, an exhaustion perk). No mither is a joke though, so stay away from that one of his. If you don’t like David though, Claudette’s self care is top tier even though she doesn’t have an exhaustion perk.
---
Im just talking about all the little bullshit they constantly do that holds killers back. Hags old add ons, the pig nerf, all of ghostface, Legions old move speed because they said making them full speed would be "too oppressive," stupidly long cooldowns on perks that are already like B tier, the list goes on and on.
---
Nah he has long arms man wym?
---
Take
---
That
---
Stupid
---
Red
---
Light
---
Away
---
Well I'm not very experienced with killer so I can't give you much advice, only thing I noticed is survivors tend to prioritise healing or rescuing over doing gens, so if you know multiple survivors are doing gens together to finish them quicker, just hook 1 and try to at least injure 1 other survivor, so you'll have one person that probably will try to heal, 1 person on hook, and 1 person on the way to rescue and you can either try to hook the injured guy before the hooked person is rescued, or go and find the survivor on the gen and chase him to slow down progress on the gens.
---
Quentin's face.
---
Oh... nothing
---
This is so fun and actually pretty effective if you use an offering for certain maps.
---
When going through the bloodweb, you always want to get a perk as soon as possible. Even if you won't use it. This way you'll spend less bloodpoints on every bloodweb
---
Don't want to be that guy, but a reminder is due that we (unfortunately) got the remake Freddy Krueger, meaning it wasn't Robert Englund.
---
Jackie Earle Haley, the man who played Freddy in the remake, is 58 in a month from now. Hope someone makes another post for that :).
---
&gt; Lol no good killer will just let you destroy the totems.
---
NOED applies to a dull totem at the end of the match. If a killer really invests time to defend his dull totems, the survivors are given plenty of gen-time. And if he defends his NOED at the end of the match, he can't hunt all the survivors down.
---
&gt; Plus the perk rewards bad killers kills for no reason.
---
Not exactly. Yes, a bad killer can profit from NOED. But in that case the survivors didn't cleanse the totem(s) and it's on them. 
---
&gt; No bad killer should be able to get free kills just because the survivors did their job.
---
But they didn't, that's the point. Cleanse the totems if you're afraid of NOED. Or go hunting for it as soon as the exit gates are open. The game isn't finished when all the gens pop, it's only over when it's over.
---
What they said on the anniversary stream sounded amazing.
---
No longer having to wait for survivors to fall asleep,
---
No longer getting tea-bagged by survivors who wake themselves up during the sleep process,
---
Being able to move around the map via generators and push survivors off generators,
---
Survivors automatically falling asleep and having to waste time by waking themselves up,
---
Dream traps to interfere with loops and vaults.
---
Old Freddy sucks. Once in a while he gets that ideal scenario where one or two gens are left and everyone is asleep, but beyond that he's like an M1 killer you have to wait to M1 with. I'm glad you're having fun with him, though.
---
It has. Cleanse the totems or the hex totem when it spawns.
---
And DBD will never be competitive, it doesn't strive to be.
---
Yesssss do my bby justice
---
I would play hag just to use this cosmetic. Well done.
---
I would say for your items/ add ons get which ever you like. Usually try to go for red, purple, green, gold, then grey in that order but I personally suck with flashlights so I don’t trip if I don’t get the good stuff for that while going for better toolboxes if that makes sense. I wouldn’t say you have to buy any DLCs but ash is a good survivor to have, I personally play feng Ming who was a DLC. Hope this helped any!
---
Wow. Edgiest 3 year old? Ok. I just looked through your post history too and only found complaints. It also explains your 6k karma from a full year.
---
Do I NEED to link my YT channel?
---
SO COOL!!
---
Ummm
---
They look amazing!  Would love to see them both in dbd
---
The hatch is earned, not given
---
Nothing better than when someone drops the god pallet early

Yes I am. You "only found complaints" yet a small number of my posts are complaints, while 90% of yours are questions. Karma doesnt matter and I dont post every 5 microseconds, unlike you.
---
Honestly since there are additional skins to get i never prestiged any charakter again. Doesnt worth the 1.5 million bloodpoints to get back to level 50 again in my opinion
---
same person continually drops pallets all gone 2 mins into the match
---
Thought there would be a casting couch....
---
Traps can force survivors away from loops and ob a 115% speed killer can be threatened to be put down to get hits between loops.

That doesn't work as solo survivor tho
---
Beast of prey removes their terror radius and red stain for 30 seconds or something after getting bloodlust tier one
---
a comment then lmao i barely even use reddit (i call everything tweets now for some unknown reason) and i really dont ever remember making that comment
---
I complain when I see fit. For the most part I'm a lurker or only post 1 comment or something. People don't upvote me but I only get downvoted on this sub because its filled with...well, this games playerbase. 
---
&gt; I rarely post anymore. This account is dead 
---
***Posts from 1 and 2 days ago***
---
Nice bait.
---
If you’re injured and can’t find a teammate, start working on a gen. The problem is survivors committing to the idea that they must heal their precious one health state or else they can’t contribute to the team.
---
Selfish-carers always seem to forget the opportunity cost of that comes with waltzing your ass halfway across the map to find a cozy corner to touch theirselves for at least 32 seconds. You know what else is a loss? Committing your 4th perkslot to a perk that has the same efficiency as having a teammate heal you, which doesn’t require any perks. 
---
You can bring an ITEM that will serve the exact same purpose that self-care would provide you but at a much faster rate. 
---
Want to talk about liability? 32 seconds of having your aura be exposed if within Nurse’s Calling range? How much ground do you think a killer can make up during that time and find your aura? There’s a reason I run Sloppy + Nurse’s at lower ranks. There’s a reason I end up taking off those perks when I reach high ranks and most survivors either run we’ll make it or don’t waste time healing.
---
But at least answer me this, Your injured, your deadhook, your being chased, you know you won’t last much longer, but there’s one gen left and you need adrenaline to trigger. Should I do the gen or go self-care in the back corner?
---
It's only while you're in the killers TR though, which means they're probably gonna be on your ass in a sec.
---
The game’s player base is full of edgy underaged kids. You literally describe yourself as the playerbase. Technically you’re right but read the posts. One is just a quick shitpost because me and my friends were for some reason laughing at it, and the other was just me being gay with my friends.
---
Thank you, hope you liked the meme.
---
I really, really, really like this image!
---
&gt;The game’s player base is full of edgy underaged kids. 
---
Not really IMO
---
&gt;You literally describe yourself as the playerbase.
---
You uh, are joking right? Because I know my bio is.
---
&gt;One is just a quick shitpost because me and my friends were for some reason laughing at it, and the other was just me being gay with my friends.
---
Still posts.
---
Honk honk
---
try santa shoots kid in sleep meme lmao
---
Not sure if anything is actually broken. People have played and played against Ghostface already.
---
So it’s really 1 of 2 things. Either everyone is playing the PTB and you just can’t find a game because they are filling up, or there are no games because everyone has already played ghostface.
---
If you are using real money, get Myers. Spirit can be bought with in game currency.
---
I’m too human for this hair 
---
Too human for this shirt
---
Too human it huuuuuurts
---
No seriously it-it hurts
---
Wendigo as killer would be awesome.
---
It's the 1:1 equivalent of teabagging at the gates.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah. I know. I agreed with you. I forgotten about those posts. I still don’t really consider them very involved posts though. Have some self awareness. Your name is the perfect example of the playerbase. X = some sort of ranking/power level or name. I.E. God, general, lord, and almighty. Y = Edgy adjectives. I.E. Raven, the X, Dark, and reaper.
---
Why did my post showing basically the same thing get removed a few days ago yet this one gets to stay up? Not shitting on OP, just the inconsistency in rules
---
I can’t speak for PC, but on PS4 the queue times are the same regardless of rank.
---
I think we have a higher player base though as the game was free about 6 months ago, and the population has noticeably increased.
---
&gt;Yeah. I know. I agreed with you. I forgotten about those posts. I still don’t really consider them very involved posts though. Have some self awareness.
---
It seems like you are trying to downplay the fact that they are posts because you said the account is dead.
---

Oh I'm aware, you just cant change reddit names
---
Yeah, I honestly don't get people's argument here.
---
"It's the PTB it's a test environment! Of course they're going to be badly balanced!"
---
_what were they thinking when they were testing him internally?_ 
---
_How did he get released in such a godawful state if they actually had testing going on?_
---
It's like the devs don't even play their own damned game.
---
Sounds like a lag switch to me
---
I love how you have a pig flair. one of the most insufferable fanbases on this subreddit, but you have the audacity to try and shit on weebs.
---
That’s where the confusion stems from. I was over exaggerating there. The account isn’t dead but I don’t use it often. Your name and how much unnecessary profanity that was in your post made me think you were an edgy 13 year old.
---
I wanna see a Jane one
---
Healing was nerfed in general. The time it takes to heal is 4 seconds longer from 12 seconds to 16 seconds. As Self-Care is half speed, it went from 24 secs to 32 seconds.
---
Botany Knowledge restores the old healing speed back to 12 seconds. Its efficiency to kits takes 12 charges, so a yellow medkit can heal twice.
---
.net
---
That's reassuring thank you.
---
I've been finding games pretty quickly, average like 1-4 minutes. So I can't complain currently.
---
[https://steamcharts.com/app/381210](https://steamcharts.com/app/381210) On PC it seems to be growing as well, which is great because I'm really enjoying the game so far.
---
Oh-ho?! Then COME AS CLOSE AS YOU LIKE!
---
I'm very passionate about the design terrible decisions you could say. The name has changed for a while now though.
---
Myers is pretty fun to use imo.
---
Wow I hope I never get you as a teammate. 
---
If he stopped next you to get healed, he is obviously doing so because
---
A. He wants to contribute more to the team by running four useful perks and is expecting altruistic teammates. (Self-care contributes nothing)
---
B. He wants to lower the risk of losing his position by getting caught out by Nurse’s Calling as a teammate can heal you twice as fast.
---
If he ran to you and brought the killer, that means he’s being *chased*. Maybe be a team player and help him by taking the aggro? You might have to take one hit but if you manage to escape, you can definitely be productive by self-caring for 32 or even 40 seconds and praying your aura isn’t shown to the killer with Nurse’s.
---
Or maybe you’ll get hit once but the killer will go back to the original guy he was chasing. Who is injured, on his death hook, pleading for adrenaline, but you thought self-caring for 32 seconds was a better idea before returning to the gen and seeing him die.
---
Myers is the best killer out of these.
---
Pig is probably more fun and comes with better perks - surveillance mainly.
---
Ghost Face is still in the works so you might want to hold off with him until he gets his buffs.
---
If I see a p3 Claudette I make it my mission to make their life hell. Other than that I don't really punish one survivor over the other, it makes no sense to me. Again, except for p3 Claudettes, but that's because they're subhuman trash
---
Ghostface is awful at the moment, but he isn't released yet, he is only available on the PTB. I suggest you wait until Ghostface is released on June 18th before you make your choice, however, I suggest Myers, he's amazing when you learn how to play him.
---
Pig and Myers are personally my two favourite dlcs, but I think Myers is slightly more fun. It's really a preference thing though, it's hard to say which one is the funnest.
---
Try watching some YouTube videos of them and see which one you like more. Or if you're patient, the game sometimes gives you an item which let you play as a killer you don't own for a match. If you get some of those you can trial them and see which one you like best.
---
No, but you're trying to keep your playstyle exactly the same with no regards if a survivor has DS or not, as many people have already told you.
---
You have two choices:
---
Either down the survivor who you just downed, risking being hit by DS, or go after the other survivor, avoiding being struck by DS.
---
It's that simple.
---
you got lag switched by a survivor dude lol
---
Now the killer can open the door?
---
Okay everyone, stop making your ideas. This guy one it all.
---
Ever since the Endgame Collapse update came into power, yes. If all generators are powered, there is more than 1 survivour (and, therefore, killer hasn't closed the hatch), the killer can walk up to a door, smack it and it'll open.
---
I mean, This is great, but we need shirtless myers.
---
ur right, i didnt think of that
---
Alright that's adorable
---
Dude I play on PS4.. if takes too long (more than 30s) reset your queue and you find matches instantly..
---
r/coolguides
---
I do like me some cuteness and oinks
---
Good meme, but the devs are making him harder to detect.
---
No red stain COULD be Beast Of Prey since he was in a chase?? But the no terror radius is sketch as fuck
---
Grow up, it's all for show.
---
Happy Birthday to our OG boi
---
Hmm I have been leaning towards Myers.
---
As far as I know, unfortunately you can only submit ONE design, but both of these are SICK!!!
---
Not gonna lie, you had us in the first half
---
His mindgame is pretty ass, maybe it gets him a free first hit, but a lot killers can do that already and easier. His stall is insignificant. He can't slug because he has to resleep a survivor every single time they get back up.
---
His tracking is actually really good, but tracking isn't that strong of an ability.
---
I was really wanting Ghostface but I saw bad things about him which made me feel quite disappointed.
---
i would agree my thoughts exactly
---
I forgot the 7 pm, generally the lower your rank the longer it is. I truly pity the rank ones.
---
I assume Ghost Face perks are at G Tier
---
Ahh if she was blonde...
---
Honestly I think a lot of it happens because the killer was bullied in the last game, so he takss it out on the next group of survivors
---
This made me lean more towards Pig. How much is Leatherface?
---
But the devs aren't going to even consider a redesign until people have had a chance to play the fixed version of Ghostface.
---
oo. That makes more sense.
---
I think i'm aiming to achieve rank 1 at the moment, so I'll just have to deal. Don't know if I am good enough but I am still gonna try
---
The best part is considering how weak ghostface’s power apparently is (from what I’ve heard) the meme works both ways. 
---
In your’s he’s huge and thus easy to spot (a testament to how he just needs to be on a survivor’s screen to counter the power)
---
But in my version he’s also made out to be the useless/weak one of the two. 
---
So both are still meta-correct lmao
---
Myers is the best out of these 3.
---
Pig has better perks.
---
Ghost Face is garbage right now, but he might be buffed when he will be released.
---
Both, Myers and Pig are pretty fun and Ghost Face is just a NO NO in terms of game play.
---
Because it's just one hit down instead of 2. You can do many things to counter it
---
1 leave when someone get caught to it
---
2 cleanse totems since from the next match it also gives lightbringer points (which should've been done ages ago)
---
3 play more immersive, find the totem and then save the guy with borrowed
---
4 you can still loop the guy since noed is been used by killers who's learning the killer role/character
---
Noed isn't an issue unless your team is altruistic and apes at the same time going to give free hugs to the noed guy. I found many hillbilly with noed but only between rank 15 to 7 then nobody has ses it, it's a wasted perk slot. Tbh any other late game perk is more useful at that point like bloodwarden
---
Why do people always upload Pig memes/questions/conten when I am asleep?
---
Offering: The Game/Jigsaw pice
---
Add-ons: Rule set No.2 and Face Mask
---
perks: Ruin, Haunted, Thrill and Third Seal.
---
Playstyle: Downpeople, leave them on the ground, hit everyone, let ONE person do a gen and then pick them up and hook them, make sure the gen person has no trap on. 
---
Enjoy seeing 4 afraid survivors running around scared.
---
Not complaining about people complaining, I'm complaining about spam.
---
What perks does Pig have that makes her worth it?
---
God speed my friend
---
Clown will haunt my nightmares and I would pay good money for spirits
---
Ahh puppers, month and noob3 the toxic trio
---
True, one of the funniest dlc is Halloween since I love playing against him. I get scared sometimes and don't give you any sound alert that he's around and when you see him looking at you with his sexy eyes it's scary af
---
I don't like much playing as him but against it's super fun especially if the T1 build where he's super stealthy and yoinks you out of gens. I almost had an heart attack against a good Myers
---
Me: \*removes RBT\* 
---
Myers: \*hits tier 3\*
---
Me: WTF?!
---
*gets hit by hatchet well searching a jigsaw box hmm*
---
Maximum rude
---
I think the question has been answered, but since the person who introduced me to the game told me otherwise a few months ago, I really want to make sure on this specific point. Sorry if it seems unnecessary.
---
* the prestiged character loses their perks and starts at level 1 - yes
---
* those other characters that have unlocked the prestiged character's unlockables keep these unlockables - yes
---
BUT do the prestiged character's unlockables still show up in the Bloodweb of other characters while the prestiged character is levels 1-29?
---
Ya if you be Quentin you get it the worst can we get an f in the chat for Quentin
---
Imagine having minus karma
---
Just stop playing nurse, then you won't constantly reach rank one, which means you'll have less stressful games and can try other killers.
---
I'm usually quentin but also a fan of bill and I don't get that treatment.      I caught a teabagger for his last hook as close as you got with his buddies trying to block and flash me. They should've just left when he teabagged but they couldn't know. Sadly there isn't anything you can do for a morale victory but try to keep your spirits up anyway. I think sometimes we just get a bad run of luck.
---
I. AM. EXHAUSTED.
---
Try your best, die, enjoy your few bloodpoints, move on. It's not that hard to try.
---
Why you gotta disrespect my fat boi like that?
---
Neah looks like she holding in a big fart but trying to play it cool
---
This somehow looks like a good skin.
---
You never played against a good omegablink nurse if you think the spirit break the game's mechanic
---
You know she can't see shit while phasing and the sounds are currently broken right? Ok you can't hear her phasing with HER BEST AND RAREST add on. So what? You have plenty of opportunities to counter her mind games
---
About hooks, maybe wait a lil longer, I come back to the hook too as spirit if I know the survivors I'm facing waits 5nanoseconds before attempting an hook. I never had a problem with spirit since just a few I've faced were actually good
---
wat
---
It really is. 50% is a lot, but you can break out of it incredibly fast.
---
Obviously the survivors aren't going to cooperate with your plan, they're going to try and get back up. And it's pretty hard keep them down, when you have to wait 7 seconds to hit the healer and then another 7 seconds to knock the survivor back down if the healer succeeded.
---
Yeah, that's a power move.  Every time I get pointed at I go hide in a corner until the dominant survivor goes away.
---
I would be down to it IF she could see people in her phasing. Right now she's fine
---
(Sounds still broken playing killer btw)
---
Were you able to place traps and teleport to them as well as chainsaw?
---
....HOW ABOUT GO LOOK WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO FREDDY AND YOU WONT THINK THEY ARE JUST TAKING HIS ONLY TOOL
---
When I know where the hatch is or happen to carry the last survivor past it I always give it unless they were some toxic asshole all game. I don't get being such an asshole for no good reason. Just hook and leave it at that if you don't wanna give the hatch, Jesus.
---
Object's pretty much my one main perk, feels bad.
---
No just chainsaw. But it was op because no one could hear me and I was a hillbilly main back then
---
It's like if killer would be "We need to dc more if there's adrenaline, sprint burst, mettle of man, decisive strike and dead hard to make game more enjoyable. It does not show anything if you get to rank 1 with that."
---
Grow up. I'm a survivor main, but when I see how toxic are some of my teammates, I really can't blame people for bringing the most hardcore killers.
---
BBQ and Chilli shows the aura of survivors more than a certain distance away (can’t remember if it’s 24 or 32m) whenever you hook a survivor. Also for every survivor you hook up to 2/3/4 you get a stackable 25% bloodpoints bonus up to 50/75/100%. Great for grinding bloodpoints. 
---
Franklin’s Demise makes survivors drop any item they’re carrying (med kit, flashlight, toolkit, etc) and loses 10% of its charges whenever you hit them. Screws over that Claudette hiding round the corner waiting for the flashlight save. 
---
Knockout stops survivors seeing the auras of downed survivors after a certain distance. Essential for slug builds.
---
&gt; when you all have active traps on
---
What? All 4 are on and active??? Of all the players, you, a Pig main, should know that that's impossible. RBT stays on survivors for 20 seconds max.
---
My favourite killer is Spirit as well though I feel it's important to add that she requires a fair bit of game sense to use and not end up mindgaming yourself. While using her power you are not able to see survivors as she is in "spirit" realm so is forced to track via scratch marks, noises, rustling of vegetation, and blood (with an add on).
---
Myers is more straightforward. He stalks survivors and tiers up with each tier making him stronger but overall is an m1 killer. Though he is still a lot of fun and had mindgame potential when it comes to his terror radius.
---
Tl:dr Spirit is amazing but takes a fair bit of practice to play well with. Myers can also be and is simpler to get the hang of.
---
Source on the original image?
---
I don't patrol boxes, but you can be sure if I happen to chase someone near you at the box, and you don't flee, you're going down.
---
For real. It’s not a common perk and they just destroyed it, as if one extra hit per game was that oppressive to begin with
---
Not when the rank system places you against 3 rank 20's
---
Yeah I don't blame Pig players at all, it's just a really shitty feeling. I just wanna get my hat off!
---
Yeh, lots of jesus on ps4. Tapp is pretty rare on ps4 too though
---
Why antlers?
---
It's ok, my son. Daddy Myers loves all his children equally, even the rowdy boys and girls with MoM and Adrenaline. If he has to hit you, it's for your own good. To make you stronger.
---
No
---
Survivors has way too much information already tbh. It's annoying to know every single thing with a pop up notification when I play survivor. It just annoying and as killer I don't get that much information (for obvious reasons). J can learn what someone get by looking I don't need more notifications, I know when somebody has noed by seeing him going faster before he hits for example
---
About the cleanse, you're not forced to cleanse before, you can also do it after. Many times I've faced noed, played more immersed, found the totem (which "hiding" locations are a joke) and then save the guy/girl on the hook. No biggie
---
If my team are potatoes I just leave or accept my death, I can't force them to magically obtain a brain. I only play solo and I don't think it's a problem, I can play around it easily by leaving, cleansing or be the distraction. 
---
As killer I stopped playing with noed after 2 months, it's useless. 1 perk slot wasted for the entire game for 1 down before it gets cleansed IF it actually activates. Maybe it's just me but when I play killer the survivors are so efficient that noed is just a wasted slot. If a killer get more than 1 kill with noed (if he gets it) it's the survivors team fault for being apes.. and there are many out there.
---
You talk about detective hunch and other perks like small game, the funny thing is I know already most totem locations, even before unlocking them. Those are useful just to learn where they usually spawn (spoiler: close to gens/hills/loops easily detectable without perks)
---
So in conclusion, no, noed don't need more UI to "help" solo survivors. Since there are other ways to play around it, if people get destroyed by noed they get destroyed by Devour Hope too even if it's pretty weak due to the poor totem "hiding spots". 
---
The problem with it it's survivors altruism that leads them to death, and death isn't an escape

Would you like fries with that? Only 59 cents more to make it a combo and get a drink
---
Hell yea
---
I can't imagine how Alien would fit into this game. The atmosphere is not it at all.
---
Just a little bit
---
Depending on what you're talking about, because lots of those were already adressed in dev's diaries
---
Have you had this experience? Your description is pretty... descriptive =D
---
Addressing your garbage doesnt clean it up
---
Yep, Freddy even reanimates his bones to kill in the real world in Nightmare 3.
---
What's even more problematic is what one sees as a solution might be a disaster waiting to happen for others.
---
k, you're trolling
---
I know that feeling.
---
Still not as dangerous as horny Hag...
---
Holy fuck lmao
---
It would go better with Ash
---
 Uh I can see that in my head but that would make him a creepy old man :P
---
Yeah needless toxicity and bm... woot...
---
Gone sexual!
---
Can you blame him? I didn't see the Claudette at first either, they are both really well hidden!
---
Oh my god, how could he
---
You're absolutely right.  Massive hypocrite.  I've seen him babyrage about the slightest notion of bm towards a killer but this scummy egc bm is totally fine with him since its directed to survivor.
---

It's 2019, dude

I kinda wanna see post game salt now. Love it, especially with face camper

You can say whatever you want but his real power will always be the fat hitboxes of his hand
---
Gone right you mean
---
No it hasn't. Learn to play against her. Watch a tutorial or something about it ffs...
---
Drunk perhaps?
---
I made a post simply stating ‘garlic mike’ when drunk
---
Actual balancing problems exist.  
---
People on the DbD subreddit:  
---
"You know what the real problem is? Bhvr calling the new killer 'The Ghost Face'."
---
Great idea but the power would be useless against survive with friends. Nowadays rank 20 killers are getting bullied by rank 1 survivors with a Smurf account in their group for ggez matches
---
sadly won't happen, or would be restricted to non licensed survivors which kinda breaks it in any case. :&lt;
---
Thanks I can't wait to get into the game and try it out of the videos I've seen I already know what killers I wanna use and i already am a fan of evil dead so when I saw you can get ash as a survivor got me excited haha
---
&gt; Just what have they addressed that's actually been fixed again...? A legion nerf
---
Bruh you are contradicting yourself all over the place. I know the game state is kinda sad at times, but if you actually read dev diaries, you'll know ETA of dedicated servers release for example
---
I'm playing DbD since Nov 2017, and I've seen a huge amount of stuff fixed. It's all in the [patch notes here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patches, you can read it really really long.
---
But honestly, if DbD bring you such frustration that you can't tie your thoughts together, maybe you shouldn't play it then? Matthew even recommended a nice game instead of DbD - Civilization

They're using option to stream on multiple platforms at once and don't bother with cutting those out anymore for some reason

At least someone gets it...
---
Safe unhooks + taking a hit after unhooking + one more of either was way too easy for MoM
---
He should’ve chainsawed the Nea, that’s wher he fucked up. Gg
---
I think you’re eventually going to break and buy all the dlc characters lol. Especially for all perks! Out of licensed, Myers forsure but Pig is so fun!! 
---
Ghost face hasn’t dropped yet, just in the PTB- wait to see what changes are made because currently he’s not good.
---
I have no clue, sorry. Cows doesn't want to get banned probably by spreading glitches.
---
Moments like these makes all the frustrating games worth it
---
No. It doesn’t.
---
Get rekt baby killer
---
I've probably watched Scream 1 over a hundred times. I'm the biggest Scream fan I know. The reason for him tripping and all that is to make him seem more human. Facts.
---
There are people with 2k hrs who just blindly play the game and are still really bad at it. 
---
You can’t really get the perfect council for this game, that’s a pretty utopian attempt.
---
*literally unplayable*
---
You sound just like a DBD dev
---
Honestly that is probably what is going to happen. However, I heard there is a way to buy the dlc characters with in game currency?
---
For me game would have been at the top of
---
This may be silly as I haven't had this specific problem but, what region do you play on? Are you on the PTB? Either of these might be a problem? You could just be playing on a region that doesn't have many players, and ptb's queues have been taking a while.
---
*Wheeeeen the, moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie,*
---
*that's a mori*
---
Nurses, Surveillance and Monitor should be higher. So many perks are misplaced in this tierlist
---
Haddonfield at C tier? That map is so survivor sided lol
---
Bodyblocking is mentioned as a separate bannable example in game, so it's not an example of taking the game hostage
---
Even just The Face would be better.
---
If youre buying it on steam theres already a pack for 2 more euros that comes with pig or mayers.
---
Mayers is a better killer but for me Pig is more fun to play.
---
You forgot to mention the role. 
---
Most maps I love as a survivor, I hate as killer.
---
Is everyone overlooking the fact that we can now hit survivors anytime we want 😆 - i’ll take this over them staying on a gen when i’m literally behind them transitioning them and they don’t give a F 😂
---
Username checks out.
---
And depip!
---
This is a discussion and I've only posted my thoughts here. One tjme. They are just as valid as your opinions. However your suggested solution is not to play a game I care for before it's broken? So trying to voice an opinion and share thoughts on why the game is not enjoyable, and your response is to push players away from the game? You call me contradicting but look at yourself
---
Realistically though how well would that work? Wouldn't work against SWF at all and what survivor do you turn into then? A random one of the four in game? A generic copy of "Base Survivor" outfits? Like, the idea behind it is cute, but the execution would probably be nigh impossible.
---
Is this lag switching? Or just lag?
---
Can Bubba not be slowed while charging chainsaw?
---
Clown one made my skin crawl with that stomach--eugh, trypophobia. Which, I suppose, for a horror game is actually a good thing! They're both wonderfully creepy.
---
*Oinkvote
---
There should be a "Shitpost tier 2" or some shit since honestly it feels wrong to call this a \*Shit\*post
---
in the entity, lettuce eats you!
---
Because tbh it wasn't a discussion, it was more of a frustrated rant, and if the reason for this is the game, I just don't understand why are you killing yourself over it. I kinda don't have to understand it, but, we'll, your opinions are just as valid as mine, as well as mine opinions are just as valid as yours too, so here we are.
---
I just don't understand what's your point. The game is broken? Yeah. But why should they address in this Q&amp;A something that they already addressed before? And what's the point of ranting about something that was already addressed and haven't even meet the deadline yet?
---
it's cause most people on ps4 play survivor
---
which rank are you?
---
Oink
---
That better be a miniskirt
---
Can confirm, every leatherface I've ever played against is a trash person, and a sore loser besides.
---
Dude, I think I just played against this guy aswell!
---
\&gt;Teammates get completely rekt  
---
\&gt;I give up and just walk up to him so he can kill me since I don't believe I can win  
---
\&gt;He instead drags me to the hatch, And then closes it infront of me  
---
\&gt;Takes me to the south gate and downs me right before it happens  
---
\&gt;Drags me to the North gate and actually lets it open  
---
\&gt;I just book towards the exit  
---
\&gt;Guessing the guy wanted to be a complete dick and wanted to kill me JUST before I exited  
---
\&gt;He ***just*** misses me and I escape
---
Fake Friendly Killers are scumbags, Well not always. But when they go this far. They are.
---
They could be a select group of DbD pros the devs could whisper ideas to that devs could clarify foggy ideas with. But what would we call this group?
---
it looks like at around 0:50 someone makes their way onto a gen. but then the other person is just walking circles around them. other survivors that are dumb as bricks are the only thing about this game that get me heated
---
Oh hell yes.
---
You go to that disgusting site? Anyway, enjoy Pornhub and DBD.
---
Dunno why, but they remind me the Monstarz from SpaceJam haha
---
You still can loop her if you hug walls since her projectile won't be able to hit a survivor who's already behind the next wall or object. So any attempt at using her corrupt purge becomes meaningless, she's still forced to use her m1 attack.
---
pretty sure he could stalk better through corn as well
---
Dat ass tho
---
Giggled.
---
I mean, you probably aren't wrong, in as much as it did sound like survivors will constantly be passively falling asleep, presumably even right after waking up, and so I do suppose getting hit by Freddy without being asleep could be explained by saying it happened in a moment of micro-sleep. But this is not an argument about such details - again, it's just funny that going from a design that strictly is about hunting and haunting survivors in their sleep - the "dream world" - to one where you are visually, audibly and even physically manifested in the "real world", was introduced as being more "essentially" Freddy, and more of a "nightmare" fantasy. It just seems like marketing talk that is meant to sound cool in a trailer, when in reality it is definitely less essentially Freddy. When people think of Freddy, they think of someone that plays with and murders people in their dreams, of being trapped in dreams intruded upon and turned into nightmares by this "dream demon". They don't think of getting slashed in micro-naps.
---
To be fair, the ability to create illusionary pallets or set traps for sleeping survivors is more nightmare-like than current dream world, so there's that.
---
When you have a "Camper" in that group, and one other killer main whos playstyle is practically a tunneling/camping guide... And you have some other controversial persons there... I don't know. Not sure if it's a good idea.
---
Well shoot, I guess I am going to end up buying them all anyways!
---
Oh thanks for letting me know. I'm honored :D
---
Such a big improvement! I wish the bangs were a lil fuller but eh I'll still buy it. :)
---
That ultra add-on for Freddy looks overpowered. You can't wake up so you will always have the speed lowered...
---
I play on PS4, I wonder if that pack is available there too 🤔
---
Imagine them putting in a Supermarket, Cheap version of Ghost face.   
---
Just a black dress with no belt, no long things hanging off his arms, cheap flip-flops, completely white mask that's really stiff, plastic lookin' knife and to top it off, No gloves.
---
The ake stands for **A**aaaaa **Kidney** failur**E**

Really? I thought it was really underwhelming... the head looks neat, but the really  cool of the body is so bland... The glowing red veins that run through are just not pleasing to look at at all, in my opinion.
---
It’s especially dumb with GF. They can spot you but you can’t stalk them.
---
It should but it doesn't because fuck killer's fun
---
The pallet at the shack.
---
The reason for the Plunderer's differences is that Plunderer's doesn't actually increase your chance of finding a rarer item, it just has a 50% chance of upgrading the rarity of an item you find. So you'll find more Dull Keys that have been upgraded from Broken Keys, but your base chance of rolling an uncommon (and therefore a possible flashlight) is the same.
---
Well I have a really smart ass, what can I say. And it is much more consistent than some people on reddit too. And so my ass disagrees with your ass

Jojo is not weed shit

Or worse! A Blendette...

oh that happend to me 5 days after i purchased the game, i had myers selected.
---
It's been only a week and I already have deep admiration for the memes. Also I just have to say Dwight is my spirit animal
---
It’s crazy looking at the % if players with whatever trophy in ps4.  Some killer ones are like .2% and it’s not even the hard trophies.  Survivor ones are like 40.0 - 50.0
---
Pig golden shower would be nice
---
It 100% is depressing but that's unfortunately what this community has become, just a wealth of toxicity.

What's up with ghostaface? I'm not really in for now.

I’ve been playing the same way.  As long as you can keep the pressure up and know when to down and hook,  and when to slug if someone gets caught right after hooking someone else, and like you said kick those gens, you will be a nightmare. 
---
Makes me think pop goes the weasel might be decent to use.  Never liked it much on most killers because it’s only 30 seconds but with the increased time in PTB maybe it’s worth it.
---
This right here is the pinnacle of the dbd memes
---
Where I can get it?
---
They should just give him a full rework and maybe give him something cool like teleporting to generators and setting up traps in the dream world that awake survivors can’t see. 
---
If only.....
---
I would main him just for this
---
ok i want it
---
Still a ps4 main tho🤷‍♂️
---
/shrugs, not sure there. Could be a glitch like the rituals that require you to be chased for 2 "seconds" when it should read 2 minutes
---
1. When noed activates, you don’t have time to stalk. When those survivors could be closing in on the gates, every second you spend tying to go t3 is one the other three survivors are GTFOing.
---
2. Not everyone goes t3. I personally prefer an M+A and Dead Rabbit build that stays t2. So for me, the insta-down+enhanced speed combines well with stealth to let me quickly down survivors who barely realized I was there.
---
Is that a fkn JOJO reference?
---
What if they don't BM? Maybe they just chose claudette as their main for any reason that isnt disrespectful, that doesnt mean they should all die because of it. And maybe some p3 clauds do BM, but have gotten over their wrong ways. Do they deserve to be treated the same as the pieces of garbage that do BM? No, I main claud as survivor and even though she's p3, I wear bright clothes, and I dont BM. I just play for fun, not to make a killer want to kill themselves(unless they camp and tunnel). Would you treat me the same as the other clauds that do BM?
---
Sorry I got on a big rant, but I just hate that everyone thinks all p3 clauds are BMers, and it bugs me because I just play for fun, and get camped and tunneled alot for just playing.
---
survivors can't lag switch because the killer is host. they were using hacks. they would have dc'd if they tried to lag switch.
---
Yea because that happens.
---
 That happens often enough for you to feel the need to make this shitty post about your non existent dream situation of having a justification for tunneling.
---
Rename suggesions:  
---
The Wraith ---&gt; The Bing-Bong  
---
The Spirit   ---&gt; The Wah  
---
The Ghost Face ---&gt; The Scream  
---
Freddy ---&gt; The Disconnect
---
Sounds amazing.
---
You're*
---
they fucked nea's hair for sure. i really really liked the waves. that was the only hair i would use on her since they messed up the pixie cut so bad with the engine update
---
Why wouldnt you want to play against ghostface tho? Like its a free win as a survivor, you can literally deactivate his power through a wall
---
Why would a killer do this?  Doesn't this defeat the purpose?
---
Noob killer asking an honest question.
---
If bubba patrols gens in proximity to the basements, it's a free win. If my mate gets put into the basement against him, he's dead. Not to mention that territorial can help too.
---
I'm quite sure he runs the game at a higher resolution. 1440p or higher.
---
almost everything can be bought with aric cells EXCEPT licensed killers/survivors
---
 each killer and survivor is 9000, cells
---
when you buy killers/survivors with cells you do not get the alt outfits(if they have them)
---
Facecamping? Its a shitty player’s way of securing a guaranteed sacrifice. In that case the gates were open and he knew that his chances of securing another down/sacrifice were super low so he decided to camp the one person he HAD downed.
---
You can buy dlc,s with ingame money (sharps)
---
Also skins. You dont have to spend real money. But im not if you can buy every charakter/killer that way. I think every licensed killer/survivor with real money. So i guess you have to pay for ash
---
Christ! He looks great for 72!
---
 with non licensed survivors and killers are bought with iridescent shards but licensed cost around 5 bucks just for them and around 7ish for both S&amp;K. Iridescent shards are used to buy some cosmetics and iridescent shards are earned by player level which goes up the more you play the higher the level the more shards you get. Auric cells are paid currency used to buy exclusive items or items that can only be bought with auric cells.
---
Okay so I will have to buy ash that's alright so if I buy legion with cells I wont get all of them?
---
Am I the only one thinks that the game is to strong for survivors?   I think it's the best map for jukes
---
What! But that's against Survivor Code of Conduct!
---
Ehh remember before the endgame collapse when survivors would take the game hostage
---
Please fix your post: auric cells is a premium currency, basically, money. Iridescent shards is a "playtime" currency
---
I need it.
---
I agree, I was just kind of done at that point. I only struggled initially at the gate to open it. My fault ended up with some unfortunate timing lol.
---
That and (I get a lot of shit for saying this for some reason) he should not have to worry about stepping in his own traps. No other killer is hindered by their own power, so why should he?
---
I really like it but it just doesn't fit the game at all it's too cartoonish and happy while the game is well dark and grim.
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
I like the part where she sqeaks. :)
---
Myers 100%
---
Thank you Haha I will have a great time :)
---
Australian? Not going to name him of course but that's my area haha. Glad you got out either way!
---
That's valid! Although we do have tons of neon skins and joke skins as well...
---
The nerve this guy had to not do something else than staying near the only objective left at that point!
---
Okay thank you so much sounds good
---
If you allow it, I will use one of these faces as a discord profile pic, probably Quentin’s
---
Every month on the 13th or 14th
---
Then you are the rarest of gems and I applaud you. Really tho, never heard of people going easier on us, either they're surprised or they rage and Dwights or Jeffs get mercy. Your post was very wholesome.
---
If youre going to upload a video like this please be kind enough to mute your voice. Thanks.
---
Yeah but those are mostly survivor and Joey's neon outfit is still grim yet bright I recommend making the mask more ripped and worn or just make it more bloody or have some brain on the sleeves.
---
Oh I love this great work
---
That's sweet but no need to!! I have luckily only experienced bullying of this degree this once. I have plenty of fun games with some awesome fun killers.
---
You should start a series on this sub, everyday upload a tip for us plebs to learn
---
Which killer is circumncised and which is not
---
You could potentially make it less saturated and more bloody in the long run. And I think it's fair that killers should have joke/ bright neon cosmetics. Thank you for feedback though!
---
Usually works if the survivors are ultra altruistic, especially if you're in basement. The problem with facecamping is leaving 3 survivors to do gens while you're there, but when all three are trying risky saves, you usually get 2 hooks out of it, when not an entire squad downed.
---
Electricity that he uses could be changed to like dark magic and his illusory pallets when broken would become the swarm of bats.
---
TF are you talking about?? Sit down somewhere 😂😂
---
This should be a common sense thing to do, but it isn't, even at high ranks. If an insta-down killer is on the basement stairs and there are 2 (or more) survs. down there (without BT, DS...) the best option is to get into a locker to let, at least, 1 surv to get the escape.   
---
About 90% of the time one surv. tries to do i don't know what, goes down, and then the other surv. can't do anything.
---
Just turn the video sound off?
---
Extra perk slot would depend on how good those killer perks are. I find perk loadouts one of the most interrsting parts of the game
---
Ahhh, sounds so sweet🦇🦇🦇
---
[Maybe i do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V18-t0lI5EI)
---
Thanks &lt;3 Only just noticed your username lmao.
---
I've definitely had this happen before with Pig but I attributed it to my mouse going out. You're chasing a survivor and it's the time to lunge and you hold left click and nothing...
---
this killer really highlights how easy it is to bully killers as survivors. never has following the killer around been more OP
---
Gas Station is prolly my favorite map, along with Temple, Asylum and Carnival.  
---
Least favorite being Yamaoka, Ormond, Haddonfield and Shelter Woods
---
The fact that they went from "The Ghost" to "The Ghost Face" leads me to believe their licensed made them.
---
Of course it’s a leather face
---
As much as I love this, deep down I want this skin for Susie
---
I actually had a scrapped concept for "Bunny Susie" with bunny mask and a stake in form of a carrot! But her outfit design was too similar to regular one so I decided to go with Frank.
---
I think it used to but I think they swapped the whoosh and the bell making the woosh a proximity thing and the bell mapwide. I'm probably wrong though.
---
Oh no, I had to wait 7 seconds to hit a survivor, a time where like 3 other killers would have gotten a hit in. Also removes his dream Transition mindgames. It is a small buff at best, while removing the rest, really good parts of his kit
---
I have over 7 k hours in this game and 2k of them are playing as nurse lmao. She's fucking broken in the hands of a good player.
---
Sorry if I've made myself sound critical of the rework itself - while I did rather like the original killer design for Freddy and have some doubts about the rework, my post here was really just meant as a little remark about the dev diary statement, with regards to the new sleep mechanics that allow (more or less(?)) awake survivors to become victims, as opposed to the more strictly separated dream realm of the original.
---
Speaking to the actual rework, it indeed remains to be seen. I will say fake pallets and slow-down traps seem underwhelming mechanically and are unoriginal conceptionally, but they might turn out to be fun and effective chase tools, which Freddy certainly needs. The traps will apparently be locked behind an add-on though, or so I've read, which is kinda disappointing. I will miss the aura-reading and the utility and strategies that come with that, as well as the ease of getting early hits in, but being able to teleport to generators at least on paper does sound like it could elevate Freddy far above his (add-on-less) current self. The dream clock stuff as an alternative to missing skill checks in order to wake up is also unoriginal in that it is reminiscent of the M1-timesinks not few killers now have, but maybe being fully asleep will come with other, more interesting afflictions...
---
I don't want them to change Bubba, I like him as is and am doing just fine even in red ranks :(
---
It's so baffling really. Why even bother playing on the PTB if you don't want to play against ghostface?
---
Lullaby and Survience are higher imo. Lullaby is trippy to the survivor while Survalience is a good perk for knowing what the survivors are doing. Nurses also has the ability to be S tier.     
---
As much as I like Corrupt Intervention I don’t think it’s A tier
---
Is it called "*dying noises*?"
---
Yep. It also is the same problem people have with Ghostface right now, survivors decide when to stop the power. Except Freddy can't even decide now when people fall asleep
---
Did you really think people were gonna ignore new content? Is this your first week on the internet
---
that's fucking amazing
---
After seeing this post i'm convinced I should start tea bagging at least twice as much.
---
I did have a typo. With Botany it actually heals in 6.3 seconds. I do notice the difference.
---
In TydeTyme's We'll Make It he showcases a time of Botany and it is confirmed it stacks. The description of WMI is there to basically say WMI doesn't stack with itself.
---
Dying Light disables Furtive Chase. You lose all stacks upon killing your obsession
---
I AM HERE!
---
it does not :( also huntresses lullaby, ruin and unnerving precense don't do anything.
---
Thanks for calling me in.
---
Thank you, my friend!
---
That, and I like how smug Amanda is
---
Killers that facecamp tbaggers are the same people that facecamp good players for no reason. I get facecamped for simply running the killer around for a few mins without BMing or abusing very strong setups or ''infinites" and all they accomplish is just losing the game because "they wanted me dead". Fun game
---
how have you not rated Avarov's Resting Place as F tier?
---
Fuck that killer
---
a fucking straight line, where my randoms always 3-gen us, and where most of the time both gates spawn next to each other
---
He had his gamer carpet laid out.
---
If those are your only two complaints you must be a masochistic. The information comes from a college graduate in computer science 26 years old with 1000 hours in the game, consistent rank 1 player who follows updates and diaries regularly. Who is talking put of there ass?
---
I will never forget the one and only time I face camped a tea bagger because they were being so disrespectful, I was then received a voice message after they died on hook (take note I'm a piggy main so I tea bagging back) which was a 10 year old screaming "You are FakInG PUSSY you are NOOOOB I hate chyouu..." Dickhead. Don't tea bag me then? Lmaoo
---
Why are you so loud
---
DBD has weird af math lmao
---
My favorite was all the killers complaining how they were getting bullied by survivors hiding after the doors were opened and now this happens like every other game during EGC.
---
When playing KYF with my friends, I ran Lithe, Balanced Landing and Dead hard and hit the killer with all 3 of them (in 3 different chases) he was really confused
---
I like to think the teabagger feels worse. I'll throw my game just to sit on them.
---
I dig that shit. Kudos to you, very talented!!
---
I mean at least other killers against swf dont literally have their powers removed from them.
---
Don't forget the nodding where they think they're hot shit for catching you after you ran them for 3 gens.
---
[DBD Forum post link](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/67138/the-hornets-queen-the-hag-by-neko-kashi)
---
“M1 Killer” is a term for killers that are more reliant on just hitting people so any killers described like that are the most valuable.
---
The Trapper is non-dlc and, being the first killer, is designed to be the most basic. His perks are nothing special but his power is fairly passive, easy to manage and definitely effective. If you practice moving around the map (“patrolling”) you’ll naturally be able to collect his traps. Play with him long enough and you’ll end up learning the paths that survivors take just through your trap placement. His traps are a guaranteed pick-up on a survivor if you can catch them before they wriggle out. By getting good with him as a killer you’ll certainly learn  other aspects of playing a killer without even realising. 
---
(Balanced this around PC. Trapper is base game on all platforms.)
---
Well, to be honest, that's kinda what Entity wants...
---
Maybe they just want to have fun and enjoy camping the teabags.   I don't camp until teabagged. Your wholly inaccurate.
---
Doctor should be in the annoying af.
---
They don't know that's the salt we needed to bring it all together.
---
Kate’s p3 hair is too dark :/
---
Windows yeah, but considering his chainsaw destroys pallets not sure that would be an issue.
---
Yes
---
I use my controller on pc too😜
---
Just more comfortable for me
---
So, you're a college graduate in computer science, not a psychologist, right? So cut that crap down about me being masochistic. 
---
And if you're actually follow updates and diaries regularly and are knowledgeable of the game, then stop acting like you don't know shit. So yeah, right now you're the one who is talking put of there ass.
---
If I could upvote this a million times I would. Amazing art, best cosmetic suggestion so far. Legitimately want this in the game now
---
It's Boi*
---
It's a powerplay, gotta show Freddy the dream world is nothing to you.
---
Joke's on you, I run Deliverance, BT and DS. I save the basement guy and we both run up. If he hits the unhooked guy, we're safe. If he hits me, I unhook myself and DS him when he grabs me.
---
Funny you say that, I just started playing her a lot.
---
She certainly requires you pay attention to a lot of stuff at one time, managing who’s sick, what’s infected, what pools are corrupted, etc.
---
Her power’s one of the more complex, surprisingly and certainly requires a lot of knowledge and the right strategy to use well. When used right she’s very effective but can also be brutally inefficient if the match just isnt going her way. 
---
Her perks are also quite gimmicky, though corrupt intervention is a fairly decent slowdown perk if you’re in that market. 
---
I’d say Plague gameplay is pretty different to regular killer gameplay. More than any other killer I’d suggest you leave her until you’re very well versed in the game.
---
It's god pallets because killers must destroy it or they will be looped forever
---
Spirit 😍
---
You can loop the killer way longer in the shack than most other loops.
---
You can run a bunch of loops around it without having to drop it. Which wastes a bunch of the killer's time.
---
That's a blessing
---
Once they fix Ghost Face... you’ll get your revenge hehe
---
I’m not surprised that killers do this now knowing that people like you and your little friends exist
---
Same thing used to happen with the legion, took a while for them to patch it out.  
---
Sorry man, you just gotta wait &lt;3
---
Bro, it's a joke
---
That's the joke
---
That’s not the entire perk
---
They're called splinters, and no. 
---
Only licensed killers have splinters.
---
You really like arguing.. But as I said dead by daylight is a broken game with every opportunity to get  better and the BEHAVIOR of the devs is what hinders this unique game from reaching its potential. The list of bugs and glitches goes far far FAR beyond freddy and legion. It's simple core functioning that even games in 2005 were easily able to provide. Not sure whose suckin your dick to support a development team that literally gives 0 fucks about you, or fixing their game. They care about self preservation and the recognition they feel they deserve. There are some people on the development team that genuinely do good work, but are hindered by terrible management at the higher ranks of the team. It's a disgrace
---
*you're
---
they want that most of the time just saying
---
It's one of the safest pallets for survivors in every map. If a killer doesn't break it, the shack becomes damn near impossible to get a hit on a looping survivor.
---
I was researching it, I guess the placement of the pallet is in a safe position for survivors. Once it’s down you can easily waste the Killers time, and if they break it no amount of bloodlust will help them get to you.
---
Well to be fair, not having Insidious on The Nurse isn’t exactly a Shakespearian tragedy.
---
Ikr? He got bullied the whole game and decided to camp a hooked survivor close to an opened exit gate with all three other survivors running around it.  I mean what kind of killer does that? Only the toxic ones. Real manly killers would’ve went and stared at the wall on the opposite side of the map. Fuck that killer indeed.
---
You haven't found the "exact" chances though, just a value close to it.
---
The clown upon seeing this, "_fuck my drag right?_"
---
Now its the killers because they will ensure a kill no matter what lmao
---
Saw him coming a mile away. Ghostface I mean. Not the artwork
---
Man the Nyakuza Metro chapter looks dope
---
Salty killer main detected pahaha
---
sacrifized*
---
You won’t have that problem on console
---
Yo what the fuck they changed Billy’s chainsaw noise?
---
👌
---
What was the killer supposed to do? There’s three survivors running around a hook next to an opened exit gate. He has literally one objective and it’s standing right in front of him on a hook. Why the hell would he not camp? If he didn’t they would’ve all escaped. Was he supposed to let them all escape?  Also if he wasn’t bullied then how the hell did he not manage to get one kill with the second strongest killer in the game? Use common fucking sense. Seriously look at the other comments. Just because you’re too stupid to understand why he was camping doesn’t mean we’re all salty killer mains.

"Ghostface isn't going to cost people their lives."
---
That's the problem though. Jk, good post.
---
The problem with Plague is that there’s no real pressure to being sick. You can still run and perform actions the same when sick. My suggestion is in addition to being unbroken, fully sick survivors should suffer from the blindness and exhausted status effect as well.
---
Yes, I regretted writing that after posting, but then it was too late. I wanted to convey the idea I had absolute percentages, so I should have used "precise" instead.
---
What's SWF?
---
My uncle bought the game for me! Wasn't expecting much from the game BUT HOLY FUCK
---
I'm so addicted right now!

i'll spend all my fuckin' money on that, tbh
---
Do the killer tutorial.
---
That's fair definitely a preference thing :)
---
They made that you can rotate the characters in the lobby just to look Jane's booty while waiting for the game to start.
---
Let's slap this ultra-rare item on top of the MoM + an Insta-Heal + an Exhastion Perk + Adrenaline, that would make like what, 5 "second" chances? And you can use all those things alone by yourself without any help from other survivors.  
---
Yah, my logic definitely sucks, dud.
---
Remember, this is 2010 Freddy. Microsleeping is based on this:
---
https://youtu.be/mxNAjgovko0
---
I wont camp them because that fucks me up. But trust me I will tunnel the shit out of them. I will check gens really quick come back. They get the unhook an tunnel an kill them asap. Then wait for the messages
---
Maybe the reason he didn’t get a kill with a strong killer is that he isn’t skilled with that killer or at killer in general, he should’ve took the survivor to hook further away from the gate to give him a chance to instadown more than 1 survivor, clearly you are salty as you keep insulting me calling me stupid and brain dead because I insulted a face camping killer.... 
---
It’s a video game meant to be fun, face camping isn’t fun for anyone, so the fact you’re defending it is really weird considering you claim to be a survivor main 🤨
---
Ohh alright i thought the video was implying only one survivor could have the exposed effect at a time even when others were stalked. Thank you :)
---
Knowing this sub exists has made my day 1000% better
---
you need to hit them 3 times before that, so it's kinda a punishment for chasing them earlier
---
That's a skin I can get behind. I'd buy it straight away
---
As killer...
---
aNiMe BaD lul
---
Yeah, Haddonfield is no fun. I usually start planning for a possible 3 gen lockdown right at the start.
---
Makes me feel proud that you asked! Yup indeed I play this game with one less sense than you guys have.  I’ve been playing this game for more than two years now and it took a lot of practice to finally get it. I avoid any perks that rely on audio like nurses stridor and audible perks alike.  I heavily rely on perks that are visual like BBQ and chili, a nurses calling, etc.  deaf people really can play this game but will need some extra time practicing to get as good as you guys.
---
Boy this fan cosmetic idea is the best idea BHVR has ever had.  Between this and wendigo hag take my money!
---
# A true killer
---
Dancing on hook (spamming the unhook button) is for when the killer is near you.
---
Wow! Nightmare fuel HAG
---
And forgot to answer your last question, no. I did it all by myself. No one helped me.
---
As slow as she is, two blinks are fine. No more than that would be perfectly fine.
---
Yeah my issue is I never play p3 as a bragging right I just genuinely like his head cosmetic. Probably sends mixed signals to some so I never ever equip flashlights lol.
---
One blink makes her useless because you need the correction blink after the first one, becomes way too easy to dodge with 1 blink. she does need some changes though, but i think thats way too much, like maybe a shorter lunge after the 1st blink or smth
---
Hahahaha me. I stay atalking shit EVERY TIME I get obliterated.
---
"That was bullshit. Nice internet. Fuck these hitboxes. Leatherface is trash. My team just sucked. THIS LOSS WASNT MY FAULT."
---
When in reality...I got outplayed 😂 big time.
---
That's pretty funny tbh, playing with your food. When survivors bully the killer it's ok but when the killer does it it's not?
---
He’s excellent.
---
Facecamping is pretty common after the last gen is completed. There’s not really a whole lot killers can do unless they are running NOED. Pretty much your only play is to camp a survivor ASAP and hope for altruistic kills.
---
Any other facecamping is pretty much trolling or newb game play.
---
These are not in the highest settings, right? What level is it?
---
What if he just slugs you after hitting you
---
I love the samination nea memes lmao
---
I will admit I often let licensed killers get away with these shenanigans for that reason. Never surprised or complain when Freddy bullies me. ):
---
This has to be a thing. Imagine the ammount of people who would buy this.
---
ahhh I do love the angry squeakers.
---
Aww thank you so much, my dear! You made my day!
---
Thank you!
---
It would be nice for Susie or Julie with Frank and Joey being wolves, but they're *gang members* from the 80's, anime and Japanese fashion wasn't nearly as popular or known about during their time vs how it is now. (This part is purely just from what I think but I don't think behavior has given cosmetics for people that lived in the past a modern costume unless they would have been alive and of similar age. Then again an almost 60 year old Frank would look pretty funny in a costume like that.)
---
Also why are all of these fan cosmetics all high-visability costumes? I really love the race one for Joey, but I would never use bright costumes because I can be seen across the map. That's nothing a darker pallete couldn't fix though. Still, good work though!
---
✨✨✨✨♥️♥️♥️♥️
---
Outside.
---
Thank yooou
---
Fuck don't tell me Ghostface is like Wraith... What's it like running OoO with Ghostface? I play on console so I can't do PTB and I haven't heard much about Ghostface.
---
I never bully anyone or condone bullying either, that's the funny thing. I play for fun, not to be mean spirited.
---
Thank you my dear!
---
Just as points are earned, not given. Outside of extenuating circumstances.
---
tbf, bhvr never really cared about timelines of skins (and the arguement about bright colours - i mean, you *do* have 32 meter radius and a bright red light infront of you), however colours can be changed in the long run, it's merely a concept
---
This feels like a personal attack.
---
Yayyyyy
---
OK, I get it.   So he did a lousy job with the gens, the gate was open and he was trying to make something out of nothing.

A shaved furry basically.
---
If this wins (hahaha as if), colours can be more desatured with blood on the knife/on the jacket
---
Essentially, yeah. Funnily enough without the use of No-One Escapes Death you can usually rescue people from a facecamp at any point in the game with baiting a hit and/or with good teamwork so its never really a “guaranteed” kill.
---
Take my goddamn money.
---
Liking it. I would say get rid of all but 1 extra blink add on and make it an ultra rare to give her one. To replace her 3 missing add-ons they could have a slightly and considerably reduce fatigue duration and one thing for fun would be a common add-on that slows blink charge and move speed but awards more points, nurse version of padded jaws if you will.
---
thats some epic multitasking
---
mew say mew know totem spawns, but they're all changing in the mid chapter update. Also, I dont think you'll be able to cleanse noed of the purrson is hooked eight beside it unless the killer is the worst killer to ever play the game, and this happens more times than I can count. It can force someone who did phenomenal to die first hope just because the killer got bonus speed and an instant down for not doing their job
---
The devs lied to me.
---
Turns out No0b3 was the survivor too...
---
You got me I posted this exact meme a while ago under the tittle "dammit Dwight" or something in that nature
---
I take a couple pallet blows to the head and my memory escapes me sometimes
---
Someone recommended making small game show how many totems are active which I feel like would work for me. It would add a use to the perk
---
Her power MORE than makes up for slower move speed. It's why she is high risk, high reward.
---
We need a gothic skin collection omg
---
You're one of them trying to take away my happiness.
---
Not really, cuz neko is basically human with cat ears and a tail and furry is humanoid animal.
---
Except for.. yknow, when survivor finds the hatch first
---
oh alright, i guess its okay if you forgot? idk
---
YES!!!!!!!
---
Rip classphoto though. I wonder if its gonna be reworked in a good addon cause I have quite a few saved up... im gonna miss that addon :(
---
she needs to be slower than survivors. she used to be 115, that was crazy. she's overpowered and there's no state where her being able to chase you normally AND blink if needed is balanced
---
Yeah, but it's okay tbh, I knew from the start it will most likely never win, it was a fun experience though. I'm glad you enjoy the concept though
---
This looks insane! And not only because the doctor always looks like a fine chap in anything.
---
ok? he is a licensed killer, so will probably cost money. Dont buy him until he is fixed.
---
Yea
---
On a bit of a side note, I’m disappointed that they’re implying they’re happy with Trapper and Wraith. I mean, I don’t play too much Wraith, so I’m not too sure on how to use him at his highest potential, but Trapper is pretty garbage at the higher ranks and I’d really like to see his power reworked in some way
---
*Frenzies on you*
---
*notices your deep wound* OwO what's dis?
---
Ik that, but wut I'm asking is personally targeting someone because of an unjust reason
---
as a killer main i agree with you, hallelujah
---
I appreciate your positivity but I don't it really applies in this situation. I think a lot of people experience toxicity because the majority of the playerbase is toxic, not just a few players.
---
You can snowball 1 hook into more downs pretty easily this way when the survivors have proven themselves to be mindlessly altruistic, especially when they're survive with friends.
---
No idea what this killer thought he was doing though, he'd have been better off just M1'ing people for grabs and easier downs than waiting for the chainsaw to charge.
---
Yeah, let's also add a+, a-, f+, f- and all other sorts of tiers. It will definitely help us with ranking killers.
---
Yes, never has been Seen before
---
In the power descriptions it says that it'll play a soun IN THE AREA, I tought that people inside my terror radius could hear it.
---
Yesss another HappyNorskChinchilla post - your concepts are always amazing and your art is great! The gothic doctor theme is so fucking good - glad it was you who illustrated it!
---
Always happy to see your art :)
---
You did so yourself :P
---
Give my Swedish girl Nea some damn blonde hair! That’d be dope!
---
I don’t think personally targeting someone is any different from normal tunneling so no
---
Yeah that's how it works, the survivors who are nearby you can hear it
---
He said on stream that they are just going to adjust numbers.. so basically nothing.
---
Yes, but a solid googling while distracted did not find me results.
---
Have a shitty one too, m8.
---
Awww thank you, my friend! I’m really glad you liked my post. The Doctor is my fav killer, and I hope he gets a black gothic coat cosmetic someday. Again, thanks for your sweet comment! You made my day, dear!

1. You say the Public *Test* Build isn't a test build. What are you talking about?
---
2. You say the PTB is just an early release, depsite the fact that no progress carries over, no-one has to pay for the DLC to test it and everyone will lose access to it next week.
---
3. You say that they don't play their game, despite the fact that BHVR frequently does internal testing. Hell, several devs frequently stream the game.
---
4. BHVR will be fixing Ghostface for launch. Go watch yesterday's Q&amp;A.
---
So the people inside my terror radius can hear it?
---
That's some high quality, see you on the front page.
---
Like you said, gates were open and all three of the other survivors were right next to the hook. What's he supposed to do, run to the other side of the map, count to ten, and then come back?
---
Camping is a shitty thing to do (both tactically and in terms of etiquette) when gens aren't done, but once the gates are powered (and open, no less) staying close to a hooked survivor to grab people off is basically your only viable tactic, especially if you're a m1 killer and the others are all healed.
---
I also want to add in sometimes our timing is off. I honestly am trying to get you to the hatch/doors you just kept breaking out of my grasp.

I just don't want you walking out on your own two feet. It feels wrong. So I *want* you to get out the front door, I just want you crawling on your stomach while doing it.

The Meg character I had so much trouble with last night seemed to have a distraction role, she just wanted to be chased all over the place.  There was another female character that seemed to want to only fix gens.  Those two were clearly working together.  The other two I can't recall but I did get a four kill game.

Ok, thank you fo3 your insight.

Oooh I might copy this to my notepad and save it for the future

Don't know what you mean by that.

---
I healed to full once against Freddy without a single damn skill check.
---
I repaired a generator once with another player without a single skill check too, but both of these only happened once to me. I don't remember having any luck offerings either at those times.
---
well i think the main issue is that u allow messages from non-friends. not a good idea when playing competitive mp games
---
The sound is not so loud that you can hear it in the complete terror radius. Really only the ones who are really nearby to you hear it.
---
Honestly lore wise, I can’t see how the entity can give a shit as to wether or not its killers are OP as hell. The devs are just too afraid to make another nurse or hillbilly cause people are gonna be screaming OP bullshit
---
It’s been this way for a long time. I used to get downvoted to hell for wanting Thoughtful Thursday to stick around because some morons literally couldn’t wait ONE day to post their shitposts and memes, when they literally had any other day of the week to do it
---
if bugs are flying in and out her skin i will DC 
---
jk but i will probably scream bc  that’s disgusting
---
Isn’t ghost face a franchise character? I’m pretty sure he like Myers or Freddy or the pig won’t have any cosmetics
---
And they called me a dick when I was saying it's actually a Scary Movie chapter all this time...
---
How do you know he was personally targeting you? It sounds like in the first game you had against him he tunneled the crap out of whatever unfortunate person he found first - did he just happen to find you first in the second game?
---
I mean Tru but there's also good ppl out there. I've gotten a few messages where ppl was like "U wanna farm" or "damn, what a good game. Wanna team up" or even compliments from good killers
---
Dang you are such a calm and kind soul

Aww they're so cute &lt;3

K thx

Right :(
---
Oooh hell yes! Wendigo’s are so underused in horror.

Maybe because balanced landing but in escaping very often on this map
---
Nah that would be awful; pig would be mega unfun to play against.

I think both pig and 3rd seal could use a buff but these 2 combined would make pigs power way too dangerous

Uhh, I’m not sure about this one.

---
-_- basically
---
i wanted a survivor trashbag skin for some time now. to immerse on Badham and Haddonfield.
---
I'm glad you do!
---
is awesome
---
They tunneled and camped because they aren't good. The excuse they used was because you escaped. Honestly don't worry about it and move on. On a side note: I play mostly trapper, and since I'm on ps4, rank 10 to 12ish, I play with the same people here and there. I've had SWF that got used to me playing trapper and they will all bring small game to counter me :p it's not all the time bit once and awhile I'll see one or two groups of swfs all run it and I know they know. At least they stopped burning Haddon Field offerings ;) your story reminded me of this so I figured I'd share :)
---
Because all of your methods were things I countered in my actual post. And sorry I made a fucking typo mew asshole. And I explained the mews. I'm starting to believe mew didnt even read the post. And the killer already has more info, such as when skill checks are missed, hooks are sabotaged, when someone performs a quick action. mew can see all the info the survivor has and more yet you're complaining that survivors could see if antotem exists somewhere on the map. 
---
And I'm sorry your only reasoning when you've realized all your points have been countered us to call the other purrson mentally challenged over a typo and a joke
---
That is wrong.  The ppl inside your terror radius can not hear the phasing, this was one of the major buffs she received from her PTB.  This allows for mind games at pallets and loops, they don’t know if you’re phasing or standing still.
---
It's got my support for sure.
---
No, it's called *Watch me kobe*
---
Wow that would actually be great lmao
---
Thought this was a Nea skin
---
god pallet? arent pallets all the same?
---
This is why I haven't changed mine. I had it turned off and a guy friend requested me and said "sorry for the friend request but you are the best and funniest trapper I've seen in awhile and I wanted to say gg". After that I turned them on and I can say I get more positively than negativity :)
---
Lol maybe I've seen u a couple times with my friend. We are usually survivor ranks 8-13. L3gitHyuga1997 is my user tho in case it looks familiar. I'd tell u my friend but I'm not sure she wants me to give hers out
---
Man, I this gif is currently the object of my obsession. I've got my eye on this post.
---
They DO hear it. Otherwise the prayer beads would make no sense. I played recently a game against her and I heard it.
---
Its no worries my dude, some people jusy refuse to see toxicity. Oh and cheers :D
---
"Here comes the trapper, better watch out for his traps!"
---
So Ghost face wont have a survivor?
---
God grammar by OP
---
No, but Ash can be treated like his Survivor in a sense.
---
People inside of your terror radius cannot hear it. However, if they are outside the terror radius of your husk you leave behind, and you are nearby, they can hear the wooshing.
---

---
I can't say anything about legion, missed that part in your post, sorry. But on most killers thana is just not good.
---
Thatd actually be pretty terrible. Whispers already somewhat does that, itd just be an m1 killer with a tracking ability
---
It's all good, I can't recall off the top of my head, but definitely maybe. I'll keep an eye out for you guys :) I usually play nights and weekend cause job things. My username is milkman-4ever so if you spot me bring small game and don't go easy on me, I loove survive with friends :) likewise if you want another survivor to join you guys, friend me! I'm always down to play with people, even thou I'm a killer main, but I'm a much better killer than survivor. I'm even down for some kill your friend if you are already a group of 4
---
Dedicated servers would help this, I'd think. Once they're able keep track them, they could easily add some sort of check to remove the last map(s) of the current players from the next random pool.
---
Why do you feel the Game is so killer sided? It's one of my favourites to play from both sides, but if a survivor runs Balanced Landing, there are usually infinites that spawn that can be taken advantage of.
---
Just call him The Shout instead
---
Exaggeration at it's finest,the game will be fine and it's still growing after 3 years
---
Sure. But when we're talking about a group of people to consult devs on balance/killers/whatever - would you be ok with having such players there?
---
Prayer beads give no phasing sound map wide, meaning outside of her terror radius.  Come on think about how bad she would be if u always knew when she was and wasn’t phasing inside her terror radius.
---
Sounds great to me, we usually play every night til about 10-10:30 sometimes later it depends. We usually play all day on Saturday and Sunday. And for sure, ik there's us and another friend I got who is really nice. So that's 4 ppl right there. Idk about a fifth tho lol
---
What do you mean inside the radius of the husk?cause they can't hear it. But the ones inside of the the radius of the spirit herself can hear it when it's outside the husks radius
---
Your terror radius is centred on your husk.
---
Inside terror radius- can hear terror radius, but not whooshing phasing sound.
---
Outside terror radius- can't hear terror radius, can hear whooshing sound of nearby phasing spirit.
---
Wait, that was toxic?
---
I figure that's just risk/reward shit survivors do lol. 
---
 That dead hard was good, btw.
---
Upvote for me*
---
Exaggerating or not, it doesn't change the fact that 1:3 games there's a tunneler and/or camper. Whether they tunnel/camp a single person or more. And with newer players specifically, it WILL drive them away and ik a couple of players who stopped playing because they got tired of being chased all game, one of which is a good friend of mine for 4yrs
---
wow after playing this game for nearly 2 years i didnt even know that! thanks guys
---
I HAVE PUT OVER A HUNDRED HOURS IN THIS GAME AND I STILL HAVENT FUCKING BLINDED A  SINGLE GOD DAMN KILLER WHY ARE FLASHLIGHTS SO FUCKING HARD TO AIM
---
Ew that's ugly!! Who designs these outfits?
---
What's wrong with that?  It'd free up perks for other uses since he wouldn't need other tracking perks.
---
Not suggesting that, lol. I get it, I play both and understand its inevitable. Doesn’t make me particularly happy to have to go in a stand-off as killer the same way it annoys me to be guarded as the hooked survivor. Its shitty either way you split it but we seem to agree about doing it pre-endgame.
---
That's all fine and great until he just holds his chainsaw when you're both in the locker until End Game Collapse and kills both of you.
---
&gt;It makes it hard to tell if the killer   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;really  
---
&gt; abandoned the chase or is still very nearby.
---
I feel like that's generally only hard to tell if you aren't watching the Killer or paying much attention. In any case, you would always default to continuing to flee/loop simply knowing this perk exists, since there's just extremely little upside to erring on the side that "oh, the Killer must've left, I can do whatever I like now" especially against Ghostface or if you've confirmed this perk is being used.
---
Who gives a fuck? I hadn't seen this before.
---
Failing a skill check in the dream world will wake you up, unless it is a healing skillcheck, which will wake up the person being healed. So the point here is that you hit a great skillcheck which is good normally, but if you're in the dream world you want to fail the skill check so you will wake up.
---
Yes, because they clearly understand the best ways to win at the game, what is fun about it, and how to make it less toxic for survivors and killers both.  This is of course assuming that the people are reasonable and able to empathize with how annoying it is.  
---
That said, as a killer main who literally hates it when survivors bm: They often deserve the camp.
---
Mettle of Man really IS Decisive Strike 2.0 because it’s another useful survivor perk that’s been nerfed into the ground.

Could have been running double dresses. Those are some nasty add-ons. Saw some people repair a gen for a solid minute and neither of them got a skillcheck.
---

---
How do you Win?
---
what's with that attitude
---
I love Diewithlivv lmao
---
Oh now I get it
---
&gt; The Meg character I had so much trouble with last night seemed to have a distraction role, she just wanted to be chased all over the place. 
---
This is normal even in solo q, generators are boring busy work and running from the killer is the actual fun part.
---
The pallet is pretty much impossible to mindgame. You can just sit at it and vault when the killer gets close, because he'll never be able to double back fast enough to hit you if you do it right. Also the shack has a decently strong window, which combined with the pallet makes it an overall strong tile.
---
Because he’d be another killer like the wraith with no way to impact a loop, and no one shot mechanics or end game mechanics to help out with his ability to get looped really hard. Why do u need to know where one person is if he can run from pallet to pallet while his team does 5 gens
---
No time to wank seems too similar to that spine chill perk or whatever, but I love the first and 3rd perks. One is a counter to Franklin's demise, but not too OP, and the other would help camping and tunneling, and would have good cohesion with other perks but doesn't seem too strong
---
&gt; coordinating strategies, where they are, where are the gens, how far have they fixed them, which gate they are heading to, where the killer is, where he is heading to 
---
Lmao you think people take this game wayyyy too seriously.
---
&gt; it becomes a huge advantage. 
---
4-man SWF have a 5% higher survival rate. "Huge advantage" lmao.
---
I really like this skin concept. First, vampires are dope af. Second, I think doctor only has one skin worth getting (the Halloween one just my opinion) so good freakin job making a good doctor skin is way harder then it should be. Would love to see more ❤
---
I truly enjoy this

Honestly an alien dlc would be hot
---
People underestimated his true power 😂
---
Oh man, was he streaming? I wanna see it on his end lol
---
I try to find things i disagree with in this post and i can't. All of it makes sense with his power or doesn't have a reason not to be added. He would be a high risk/high reward kinda like(don't blame me i'm a trash aim)huntress, who is top tier if played by a good player.
---
You are posting it to this sub.
---
Thank you!🦇♥️
---
Ah that explains why we didn’t get the scream version, it was a scary movie ghostface we got lol 😂
---
I'm so fucking mad that the Devs added the most requested killer ever by HIMSELF for our Chapter, but made him dogshit &amp; virtually useless. There is literally no upside, as we get NOTHING else from this DLC. 
---
This anniversary better have some good stuff or they're literally just gonna prove that they don't listen well at ALL.
---
I like them all though I have some criticism. 
---
First perk sounds like a really cool addition but needs some leashing to not be abusive. What is to prevent survivors from just dropping their own items and then picking them up for a boost and doing it over and over again. Maybe add something to only items you didn't bring into the trial. Or limit to once or twice a match. Since his perks seem altruistic in general maybe have it only proc after making a safe hook rescue. A sort of "pop goes the weasel" for survivors   
---
Second perk is too close to another perk. Though I think it is a common perk so i would support this  one replacing it 
---
Third perk I love. Helps in altruistic play and could be combined with borrowed time to be a real counter to basement camping or at least help with it
---
It's not about camping, is about if he gets both of you in there.
---
reddit does host a surprising amount of illegal content so he's technically correct. The best kind of correct.

---
Yes that’s what I mean the radius of the husk.  There is no terror radius of the spirit herself when she is phasing because the husk carries the terror radius.  Guess we misunderstood each other.
---
tbf community wouldnt rate this skin high, it would either be gore or bikini Kate/Jane
---
Thats kinda a waste of the power in the first palce so its stupid to
---
IDK what all these people are saying because I would totally rock this on my Kate.
---
I meant Hag's power is useful to stop loops, but not for chases. I didn't make myself clear, I apologize! Killers like Trapper and Hag can block loops, but once you're down to the actual chase, you just have your attack, nothing more. It's even worse for Hag, since her movespeed is 110%, while Trapper or Wraith are 115%.
---
First thing I thought of too.
---
Myers gives you audio clues when he's in and out of different tiers, exactly how ghost face will. The big difference is that GF is bugged right now so we're hearing the cues way more than intended since he's being taken out of stealth must faster than intended. But by all means, lets keep creating new posts every 10 minutes complaining about the same couple of issues that we already know are going to be fixed before launch. :)
---

We're talking about a video game completely themed around the concept of slasher films, no one is going to use proper grammar.
---
Pretty neat tho
---
It’s just the term ‘patrolling’ that has different meanings to people. 
---
I get you’re talking about checking every gen at the start of the map, it is patrolling the gens. 
---
Most people who have played for a while know patrolling to mean staying just far enough from the hook as to not be ‘camping’ but close enough that you can keep an eye out for people going for the unhook, or to get back there as soon as the unhook sound goes off. 
---
People will ‘patrol’ by walking around checking things within a close enough distance to the hook to use it for catching them as or just after the unhook.
---
Look up what stats and facts are sometime. Your guesses aren't it.
---
That Quentin face
---
Jaws but with legs.
---
Definetely noone else said this already
---
SAME!
---
Um..his power is also passive stealth that he has now, and survivors wont be able to hear him as well then they are asleep. He will also still have some stall and tracking because they have to fail skillchecks to wake them up, which both stalls and reveals them to Freddy. 
---
We also dont know how the fake pallets or traps work. Hags traps are complety useless on their own mind you. 
---
We also dont know how long of a cooldown it will even have. Freddy will not be worse there is no way he can be worse
---
Thank you! Yes, Dr. Herman Dracula Carter is here🦇
---
Nah that's called telling someone to fuck off when they're coming at you with fallacious points for no reason. I'd rather shut down stupid conversations rather than listen to them.
---
Sounds like a worse doc
---
Circumcision rates are pretty high in America, so we can presume most of the American killers are circumcised. That would be the Trapper, Myers, the Doctor, Freddy, Clown, the male members of the Legion, and Ghostface. Billy and Leatherface also are American, but it seems like they may not have been born in a hospital, considering their strange births and how Billy wasn't on any records, so I'm going to guess that their parents did not circumcise them. The Wraith was an immigrant, so it likely depends where he immigrated from. I've heard someone say somewhere in Africa, and if so wikipedia says the rate of circumcision in Africa is 62%, though that varies heavily between countries. SO I'd put the Wraith down as a maybe.
---
You go after survivors who dont have a trap on theiur head. Traps are meant to stall survivors.
---
why are they so strict about little things like hair physics? its still clearly their character, and btw she does not look like the real thing at all her face is completely off :D

Wow! It just looks so good! I loved the cane and the top hat. I would love to see this in the game!

But you should also think about their parents, maybe they didn't want to mutilate their sons. Billy was tortured so maybe their parents circumncised him as a torture method.
---
I am really digging this!
---
Huntress, Trapper, maybe Legion aswell?
---
Wasn’t this posted already this week?
---
2 minutes is not as bad as holding the game hostage for over 20 mintues. Something I once did as a survivor.
---
Dont get mad, get GLAAD MOTHER FUCKER. FUCK THIS SHIT DEVS WHERES MY FUCKING FREDDY REWORK. THIS AINT NO DREAMLAND MF ITS A NIGHTMARE, 1-2 I REALLY HAVE TO POO. 3-4 I THINK AMAZONS AT YOUR DOOR. 5-6 SHOPPING CART WHEELIES ARE PRETTY SICK. 7-8 IM TIRED OF WAITING, GIMMIE A DATE. 9-10 IF YOU THINK THATS HOW OLD I AM, THINK AGAIN. FUCK.
---
Why would he be the ghost?
---
He’s ghostface...as in the killers mask is a ghost face. 
---
Even in the films the killer is normal people in a ghostface mask. 
---
Nothing ghostly about the character.
---
God forbid you make a mental map of where the boxes are, like... It's so hard right?
---
What a dumbass. Good shit on getting out.
---
Very true.
---
Well they need to try again... that outfit doesnt even go together.
---
Thank you🦇♥️
---
This is beautiful please add this!
---
There's a couple of other perks to throw in that grant extra bloodpoints, such as Thrill of the Hunt, to make it even easier
---
PM me a link
---
Get 8k BP in every catagory.
---
EZ 32k bp per game, doesnt use up any perl slots or offerings
---
:o)
---
In my opinion every map if f tier besides lerys and the game
---
Right. But how would one do such a thing?
---
Survivors: Brenda Meeks, Heather Chandler and Sidney Prescott. Killers: Slenderman, Kuchisake-onna, La Llorona
---
Hag with distressing and bbq
---
I’d kill for a Lua cosmetic now. Would be nice if it had bouncy physics too !
---
It looks better than most New outfits so
---
He needs a piece of toast in his mouth
---
I wanna say ive watched her before. I dont use twitch often.
---
God yes I'd switch to pc in a heartbeat
---
Maybe something that looks like the survivor run animation, like with the legion teaser
---
Doctor with distressing and BBQ are usually my farming methods.
---
Legal reasons. Say you make a film and it's very successful, and then we say, "Hey, we'd like to put your character into our game." We would have to agree not to change your character, so we can't just stick a rainbow afro on them and ruin *your* character. Because of that, we have to get any changes approved first (even if they are totally innocent and for the best).
---
I'm just saying many sit on reddit and whine about tbagging, but will turn around and most likely play ghost face and do it... like makeup your mind are you tilted by it or do you like to babyrage?
---
So how far did you read the title?
---
Looks like you are his obsession but in real life.
---
So Legion can mori itself ? Yes please, i would love to be able to mori myself XD
---
NEA has some cute shit, the jogger outfit she just got is adorable, the red leather jacket is cute the plaid skirt, the ripped jeans...
---
Choose a catagory (lets say objective) then keep scoring points in it till the word max comes up on screen. At this point you cannot score any more points in that category. Rinse and repeat with the other 3 categories.
---
I have a secret shortcut technique though where i do boldness, altruism and objective to 8k but leave survival at 3k then i leave the match via an exit gate, securing me 5k additional bp in survival
---
You must taunt the killer a lot then.
---
sounds cool. why not include the source code?
---
alternatively, maybe make it a batch script instead. 
---
anyway, cheers!
---
Just follow the chain man...just follow the chain
---
Alright. Now I'm in business. Thanks!
---
I have been doing this too. She is great to use for farming. You don't even have to kill everyone to get a good amount of points.
---
🦇♥️
---
I dont miss it... such a waste of time... I hate when I watch streamers who run selfcare its 32 seconds of them selfcaring 3 to 4 times a match..
---
YES!!🦇♥️
---
Yees that would be awesome, i don't think they will waste resources/time in the little details like that tho :(
---
I don't use it either. I use botany knowledge instead and bring in a med kit.
---
I need this in my life. I hope you win.
---
This is the best entry I've seen
---
Are we now getting THE BEE
---
PGTW sucks while i use Bond every time
---
Yes, I desperately want beHavior to get a video game crossover for a chapter.
---
Cows and his friends during the multiple killer glitch
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. and not that u asked but i recommend BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is the company still hasnt given us an update that shows the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not yet. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are.
---
I got pgtw because as a survivor i use the one claudette uses to see when smn is hurt
---
Both are good, PGTW on a fast moving killer is nice but I'd choose bond, great survivor perk.
---
I second both of these ideas. The bar changing more clearly when you are good to RRRRRIP would be a fantastic QOL change that also doesn't take away even the small differences between the two chainsaw killers (technically, it adds a small difference.)  Variation between killers is something they have to maintain since many of them start to homogenize into using the same perks over and over. 
---
There's plenty of room for small tweaks or additions so it'll be interesting to compare what BHVR thinks bubba needs vs. the community.
---
Really impressive! I think the Lord Chloroform skin fits the victorian asthetic a bit too much (and between it and the Plague Doctor skin we have a few too many Victorian skins) but I think if they took the goth asthetic further it could be a really awesome skin!
---
for me, change porn to minecraft and now we're talking
---
I haven't played in months but from what I gathered, he has no terror radius while in his shroud as long as people don't see him. But since a survivor is played in 3rd person, it's relatively easy to see him. Even unintentionally by just camera movement.
---
Maybe I could put some blood on him more!
---
The Amnesia Chapter. Killer: The Grunt. Suvivor: Daniel. Map: Castle Brennenberg.
---
Yep, if ruin is up and see person is dropping pallets without looping, you just let the chase go on until ruin is gone, when hook him and everyone else is fucked too.
---
Original comic by [Nerf Now](https://www.nerfnow.com/comic/737)
---
*Laughs in pharmacy*
---
Just imagine the amount of leather noices that one would make
---
Well, maybe you are right but it never failed me yet when I play Leatherface. Just bump into the locker and spam M1.
---
Yeah, I know. I was just talking generally in 1 v 1 situation.
---
This looks like a fetish
---
If they won't add The Bee we'll add them ourselves.
---
Just keep playing.
---
I kinda wonder. What if you both have head on? He eventually has to grab 1 of you out of the locker and when he does that, if timed well can the other person jump out and stun him, saving both of you from the basement.
---
That argument really only works if they are changing something about him.
---
This is fixing something that wasnt intended to happen. Him being licensed shouldnt affect that, they arent adding new animations, they arent changing his appearance. They are fixing his power.
---
They dont need the Licensers permission to fix something that's broken. Just like how they didnt struggle to nerf Freddy in a single week despite being Licensed.
---
As for "dont but it" any console players who dont visit this sub or watch YT videos arent gonna know it's broken. They are gonna buy it because "hey Scream" and theyll be buying a broken product. If it isnt ready it shouldnt make it to live.
---
If you let them all live then why do you run NOED? Legit curious.
---
&gt;Report Image
---
&gt;I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
2 &gt; 1 homie, patience is a virtue. Why pick one out of a locker when you can wait for them to DC, or get out while you stand in the doorway, the other two survivors will just do gens anyway and if they bm you, just wait it out. This situation is in high favor of the killer.
---
Ok.
---
if i were to make a movie id say do whatever you want to the character aslong as its clearly visible where that character originated from. makes more sense to me.
---
Thank you! 🦇♥️
---
This skin is so good I would take a moment to appreciate it while feng hangs from the hook lol.
---
I find it toxic when I play killer tbh, n thanks!
---
Frank West in DBD, I didn't know I needed This! I really like Follow Me and Master of Combos.
---
They definitely could. Nobody is really going to wait for the two people in the locker for twenty minutes especially when they have free reign of chests and an easy 5,000bp escape bonus though.
---
&gt; My suggestion? Fuck you Behavior Interactive
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
then everyone would just play meg. i like that you can play whatever survivor you want however you want
---
My net is a lan 400 mbits connection that works 1A.

Sorry mate, cant resist your mum.
---
Console dead by daylight lmao

---
The Wraith Terror Radius reversed in his different modes
---
Sadly this wont be the case. Im settling to Killing Floor 2.
---
I don't get it, you said we knew where he got his power from but then just included a clip of PTB gameplay. Where did he get his power?
---
Your demeanor makes me glad you are leaving the game lol. I play on xbox aswell. Wonder if ive ever killed you.
---
I love continuously finding Drag content in this subreddit.
---
For context I just realized that I didn't see the whole video. I see that the killer is being an ass.
---
I'm just saying that teasing the hatch and then killing them right after is pretty funny.
---
Not what the Leatherface is doing by actually holding the game hostage. That's different. My bad.
---
My game runs fine, your issue sounds isolated
---
Thank u!
---
I'm getting PTSD flashbacks of Don't Starve Together.
---
Yeah, and the better killer players get, the better survivor players get, and vice versa.
---
At a point, rank 1 nurse is a god, and that will be the pinnacle of balancing rank 1. There can't be an overall balance where rank 1 killers do anything but trounce the top echelon of players with nurse. Survivors have to be ready for it. All other killers will add variance to how well the survivors can do. Unless we make them all strong, then we will have no reason to keep playing. It will not be as big of a deal, and the DbD community will become the yugioh community.
---
Or just admit that you had lost when you were close to victory? At the very end of the game when the final gen is done you really don't want to be seen/caught by the killer. Yeah it sucks, but you can die early on or really late into the game and that's just the reality of DBD.
---
Take the L. Buddy.
---
Oh jez i'm one of the most social people in this fucked up game. 
---
Could be, but i doubt it :P.
---
Prolly a teabagger who complains about perks and “etiquette”
---
Same and I play on Xbox as well
---
Are you submitting this masterpiece to the cosmetic contest?
---
Head On is pretty inconsistent though. Idk if it would work if the killer is not right in front of the locker.
---
I think freddy should have 2 base and with addons the 3. we'll see what they do ...
---
[Again Literally the first result on google.](https://twitter.com/anupatten?lang=en)
---
And for the killer would be better getting one guy quickly and continue the game than giving away all the gens just for the 2k. It's not worthy, but yes, he can do that.
---
I was gonna go with a fan or umbrella but I couldn't come up with anything that worked, sadly.
---
Aw guys this is super sweet! I have like.. 12 more ideas lol
---
hot coldman?
---
No. I am not irritated that there are two words after "The" instead of one word. It seems to me like a waste of energy to be irritated by that.
---
**BUT** I'm irritated AF when people put DLC on their Survivors that look like they're going to fucking prom instead of surviving being murdered in the woods.
---
So to each her own irritation, I guess. I'm sure people think I'm wasting my energy being mad about that.
---
Hag got changed, pig is still fine, GF is getting tuned, legions speed is more oppressive than before, and perk cooldown is being tweaked as we speak.
---
Did you hear about Freddy? He will have an add on that takes away skill check wake up, AND all survivors start asleep. That's bonkers.
---
This is my current Spirit build: Monitor &amp; Abuse, BBQ, Ruin, and Stridor. If your hearing is fine, maybe switch out Stridor with Nurses Calling. Prayer Beads with Monitor = loads of gen grabs lol.
---
I'm with you dude, I love how step one is "buy the game", and that theres a whole step for spawning into the map. Hilarious 10/10 guide
---
Calm down lol it's just an idea
---
Need a hug?
---
Hag = upvote
---
😳😐
---
It’s not so much the game as it is the control scheme on PS4. There are definitely good Nurses at higher ranks, but anything under 13-14 it’s usually a slam dunk against her. Unless you’re playing with idiots or people who are new.
---
Can it be chickens? I don't like fish.
---
Ideas:
---
-the character has to look at him, not the camera
---
-survivors have to point
---
-certain range requirements before spotting him is even possible
---
XD
---
*angrily shocks mother as he tells her it’s not a phase*
---
It's his [strong hand](https://media.giphy.com/media/yv8nHNAF8OKNq/giphy.gif)
---
Relatable lmao. Had a good laugh reading this.
---
Ah yes, I had a run with a silent spirit yesterday, needless to say I would be glad to take an omega nurse over that jumpscary bitch...
---
Imma buy her first chance I get.
---
Ok so the story behind this:
---
Me and a friend were playing a game against a huntress. we managed to loop her for 4 gens before she gave up(idk why she didn't do this earlier). She then proceeds to hit pallets and hooks to signal she wants to farm. We felt bad for her and did so. As soon as the last gen is finished she leads us to a totem(of wich we think is NOED) and lets us cleanse it. She then proceeds to down my friend while NOED was still active(The totem was probably devour hope) and hook him in the basement. Me, still thinking she was farming(not smart, I know), tried to save him in fornt of her. Three seconds later i hung next to him on the hook.
---
Moral of the story: If you have time to farm, you have time to cleanse all totems.
---
I love that you take your time on the drawings or comics hope you win :)
---
If you look at Pig, she oinks.
---
I mean.. I’m always down for chicken strips!
---
i just literally use survivors for rp. no male character of mine has any exhaustion perk apart from DH or Head On. 
---
Adam is stealthy.
---
David in new outfit focuses on gens and chase cause he's a tough guy.
---
Jeff is extra altruistic.
---
Claudette is also altruistic but not as much as Jeff. she just helps out the injured while staying bit away from killer where Jeff will gladly switch places with chased teammates. 
---
Nea doesn't touch gens. she's a toxic shit with OoO. also only survivor i use with no BT. 
---
Jake is my lil sabo boy for when i get sabo daily or feel like being that cunt who breaks hooks in killer's faces.
---
Feng Min is a mix of everything cause she's my main, i do all kinds of builds with her. 
---
Ash is extra cocky and mostly also chills with killers but doesn't hesitate to save a damsel in distress. 
---
Dwighty is a cute lil fella with Prove Thyself and We'll Make It. doesn't like to face killers though.
---
Ace is a gentleman of luck and items. for "escape with an item" dailies.
---
Quentin is... well, he's there alright.
---
I can't believe how bad he is, he's the worst killer he's worse than Legion. The 3rd underwhelming killer now, better fix it
---
Thank you :) 🦇♥️
---
Just a poster I made in SFM
---
Dont be so narrow minded. They clearly aint talking about being a moron and running in to farm someone. They mean when its end game and the killer is refusing to hit you cause they know they can get a free grab. This is a solution to stop face campers. Think next time.
---
You’re welcome :)
---
Yeah. One time I tried to disable a trap that was next to a pallet. Managed to simultaneously suck myself into the pallet, noisily drop it, and get stuck in the trap all at the same time. Obviously got caught. 
---
It was not my finest moment
---
But this would be a buff.
---
It's a wiki, anyone can make an artical.
---
It's broken. It's a bug. The devs have mentioned it several times. It will be fixed before launch.
---
I want this as an ability now. PLS BHVR.
---
Haha get it cuz he's a joke
---
I'm sad too. I've been talking to my friends about how much I wanted Ghostface in the game since it came out, non-stop, to the point that they were probably sick of me talking about how cool Ghostface would be in the game... and BHVR does this. It's not a killer that will be enjoyable to play in his current state and not one I'm willing to spend money on, as much as I love Scream. Group hug.
---
it's fine now, maybe i clicked on the wrong tab or something.
---
SKSKSKS everyone is going crazy overt the gothic doctor but this deserves hella consideration I love it 😍😍😍
---
just wanted to say that i’m obsessed with this and i’ve been waiting for a feng with coat for SO LONG. Love this ❤️
---
We cant see how balanced he is anyway,with how bugged he is
---
I feel like the entity would be female
---
PS4 player myself, not use what console he is playing on so I just guessed.
---
I posted this in another comment in this thread but I'll repost it here too.
---
He actually *was* called "The Ghost" [in the "leaked" dev build](https://i.imgur.com/Isv8cV9.png) (that they accidentally pushed to everybody) and was changed to "The Ghost Face" for the public PTB. So it seems the devs felt the same way as you originally, but I'm guessing the license holders weren't okay with that shortening.
---
I wasn't big on the overall movie, but Freddy's look in New Nightmare was fantastic.
---
Mento mori is a Latin or Roman. (Not sure witch one.) But in one of those culture's it means to remember that you will die. I think it was in the Christian religion, so I think it is roman. So the more you know
---
Why does Frank have a joey style knife
---
Anytime:)
---
r/whoosh
---
Nope, but my perks have saved me many a time so they work just fine for me. :D

Memento - An object that is used to remind someone of something, sort of like a souvenir.
---
Mori - The Japanese word for “Forest” and the Latin word for “Death”. 
---
So a memento mori is an object used to remind people of death... kind of dark.
---
Very cool but why? People bitched and moaned about wanting a plague Dr. So BhVR made the cosmetic for the Dr. and guess what! I haven’t seen anyone with it since it came out or using it and they probably didn’t buy it! Now I’m on PS4 but normally when a new cosmetic drops you see it for the first week here and there. Doesn’t matter what it is, but when that dropped I have never seen anyone using it, just all other types of cosmetics for the Dr.  I would like to see the numbers on that cosmetic for how many they sold on each platform.
---
Mind games son.
---
Thing about plague is that survivors never have to take time to heal, regardless of what strategy they choose to face you with. So regardless of what you do, all that pressure is lost, survivors instantly get in gens at every waking moment. That's why plague is weak.
---
the problem with it is corners though. the red stain is like an early warning that they are turning a corner
---
thats amazing and i love it
---
jim fucking sterling son
---
Jesus Christ, did he hooked Kate by the ass?
---
I did the same thing. I advocated for Ghostface to an annoying degree, and to get this is honestly embarrassing.
---
It is dark, but depending on how you view death, it isn't dark, it's beautiful :)
---
Ghostface with a power, I don't care for survivors, they're just reskins, and adding more shitty perks to the pool is not what I want. Already takes like 172 levels to get all perks on a character without prestiging.
---
I was talking about the scratch marks, but the auras are still shit
---
Best killer 10/10
---
I really do not want to be *that* kind of person but that's kinda hot
---
so no news on fixing bad survivor perks?
---
I’ve always wanted a killer with a gun but idk how that could be implemented into the game without being way overpowered. And yes you can be a killer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
First, you can’t hack at all on ps4, no matter what. It’s absolutely impossible and don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.
---
Second, you probably remembered wrong and made a human error. You can’t have perks with a splinter.
---
Wow, what an original idea...
---
He's a worse doctor at that point
---
True :)
---
Inb4 nerfs
---
i’m a trapper main, and yeah he’s pretty garbage most of the time, but if you place your traps right you can get an easy 4k. no better feeling than chasing a survivor and know they are running right into one of your traps
---
Love your work, do you have Twitter account? I wanna follow you 😆
---
Okay, if you did read it. Explain what it means. becasue you clearly did not read it.
---
Thanks. I hate it
---
I don't get upset when people crouch. If they wanna waste time at a pallet, instead of putting distance between me and them, then I welcome it! Helps me win :) facecamping isn't fun, and I get no points for it :/
---
You’d do better than half the current killers for sure
---
Running BT will reduce the awkwardness of this a bit. IF a LF camps by basement stairs, they can keep going up and you can follow just a bit to force him to chainsaw you. If he hits the guy (borrowed time), he will be out by a speed boost. He has two choices here, to keep chasing the guy out and let both of oyu out or force you back in. In which case, you get back into a locker. 
---
You can extend more time for gens this way if the guy was in struggle state and about to die or something.
---
Thanks I thought it was roman because of the word being Christian
---
Why is shadowborn so high? Sure it may give higher FOV(and I must admit I run it any chance I get) but that's all it really does and I barely see anyone use it.
---
Just wanted to say I was always curious about the game, but never got it. I immediately downloaded it when it came to game pass, and it’s been the only game I’ve played since, and I’m trying my best to master it, be a team player, grind and not be toxic, cause I love the game. So really, I’m just saying I might be a small percentage, but there are some of us out here actually trying :)
---
Was there a skull on the right side of the screen?
---
So...
---
Three Dwights, huh?
---
*wink
---
This debate has been brought up endless times. Maybe in your experiance its not worth it. But theres a reason Ruin is used in 90% of games at high rank, it is simply the most effective perk at slowing the game down. Even when it is destroyed early, it buys the killer time to begin pressure. When you high roll and sticks for awhile, it can win the game by itself. The usage stats dont lie.
---
i think a good leatherface buff would be to either remove his speed penalty when charging up, or just lower it by a certain %, and make his tantrum when bumping into objects much shorter
---
Valar morghulis
---
\**laughs in Brazilian*\*
---
Yeah
---
Thank you for adding fun tips to this. I felt like doing it but it is a beginners guide and I didn't want to drag it out so long.
---
i don’t get it. that seems like a nerf
---
It was PTB Kate. (Oh, God, my ears are bleeding just thinking about that)
---
High? I have it at average. Its a perk that gives the killer a constant benefit, with no downside or activation. It is reguarly used on Nurse builds.
---
When I saw ghostface, I immediately thought of Scary Movie and not Scream. So this puts a smile on my face
---
Lol shadowborn is C, it’s not high up the list.
---
As a nurse main I cannot play without shadowborn
---
Can someone explain to me why you people like Adrenaline and Balanced Landing. I find them both so stupid and situational, making them less reliable, which means they should be played so much less.
---
The art style is pretty cringe. Looks like it came straight from deviantart
---
PGTW might become meta, as slower killers will be able to use it now.
---
Bond is a super solid perk overall.
---
Isn’t Dwight free?
---
NOED in A-Tier? Interesting.
---
I recently played against a splinter killer with perks. I was very confused and assumed the perks work with splinters now. as for him not even having noed in the loadout that's really weird. also that guy saying it's impossible to hack on ps4 no matter what is incorrect. There's hardware that can be used to hack
---
We rather not
---
Also wtf is thar audio quality
---
Sounds like shit
---
This would make me so happy. Finally a good Feng cosmetic!
---
May I say that it literally makes you more vulnerable to flashlights and that is one killer though. I just feel it's bad and I use it every single time.
---
Maybe the Devs should just spawn more totems and make the number of totems variable per game?
---
That is straight up Garbo
---
BBQ on a killer you are good with :)
---
The image has absolutely no correlation with the text
---
No probs, trapper is one of the best killers to start playing the game with and snapping survivors is so satisfying :) also no offense to your post but you should break it up with some paragraphs, text walls hurt some propels eyes, but awesome tips!
---
I dont even play feng but this looks really good
---
PWYF is trash and stridor should be at least a tier higher imo
---
Replaying it through the site, sounds just fine to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Could probably be B Tier, but its effect is very powerful.
---
I guess I'll be buying Leatgerface then! :)
---
It really sucks because I’m 100% sure of what I’ve seen but I didn’t record the match so I have no proof to show :(
---
Well I mean you can only do so much on mobile and my phone is ass cheeks so I tried my best
---
It is, but I've always just cleansed the totems as I've done gens. It's a major gambit.
---
That would make NOED seem more unfair, and make the counterplay harder for NOED, which people already complain that it’s to strong
---
Yeah, easily worth. No one can compete with him in terms of who you should buy first.
---
Also, apart from the extra points, it’s still a great tracking perk :)
---
I reported someone for holding the game hostage for 40 minutes
---
I had video proof and everything and the only thinf I hear from them is "ahh if he repeats this action he will be punished"
---
Dafuq is the point of reporting
---
Would it make a difference if it were "The Ghostface"?
---
I always though it was Ghostface, like The Wu-tang member, and not Ghost face.
---
And what other perk forces you to cleanse dulls to negate its effect?
---
The Disgruntled Employee
---
Suspicious of you to just immediately dismiss his statement. Time to get the reddit police.
---
In the sense it gives no in game advantage, yes. In the sense its the only perk that ups the BP cap above 32k, its very powerful. 
---
Its unfortunate that it can encourage poor survivor gameplay (not unlike self care really). It probably deserves its own * tier.
---
I get what everyone is saying but why is this tagged as "concept"
---
I literally just tested this with Plague and Freddy and I didn't get to use corrupt intervention so wtf
---
Noted, I'll work on it. Maybe next time you can try to be a little nicer and more helpful to a new streamer who is still learning how to do everything instead of being extremely negative. Hope you don't attack every new streamer like this.
---
I really wish they'd make it so that it still applied to all survivors if their friend is deceased. If you think about that also matches the description of the perk and would make it at least a little more viable
---
You've got me fucked up
---
I dont either, but a meme is a meme.
---
I don't think they would appreciate the humor.
---
Narrator Voice: "New Killer /u/Traditional_Virus For his ability he wields a gun."
---
Those days* RIP auto correct
---
These aren't bad. Besides, I mean, these are almost like killer perks. From a philosophical standpoint every person has a beast within...
---
&gt; First, you can’t hack at all on ps4, no matter what. It’s absolutely impossible and don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.
---
It does exist, its just not as widespread or public as PC at all, but there are PS4 hackers, its a small amount of people, but they exist.
---
Heh, I like that. Thanks!
---
It’s big. It’s heavy. It’s wood.
---
When does the fun part start?
---
Better to down the unhooked person (so the unhooker doesn’t get a stack) and then chase the unhooker.
---
Once again, STBFL is completely underrated.
---
The perks are not bad. They all synergise well with each other.
---
Sloppy and Nurses work well together as sloppy makes healing take longer while Nurses allows you to see survivors who are healing. Works well especially if you plan to leave survivors in the dying state to chase other closeby survivors.
---
Thanatophobia is a really weak slow-down perk. At maximum effect it slows everything down by 16% which adds around 12.8 seconds to gens if everyone is injured. Would suggest maybe swapping this perk with something more popular for slowing the game down like Pop Goes the Weasel or Ruin if you have the Hag DLC. Using NOED also works well as it punishes survivors for going through all the gens to fast.
---
Stridor is preference. Its a good tracking perk but it can make injured survivors sound closer than they really are. Many players who choose to play Nurse would use Shadowborn for the extra FOV. YOu could try whispers if you want to experiment with tracking perks though I would suggest only using tier 3 as the lower tiers have too large of a radius to be useful.
---
serious framerate drops while playing as Plague, to the point she's unplayable. especially common during corrupt purge being active, being anywhere near a hooked survivor, even when they just got hooked, and increases in severity as more gens get finished. it's especially severe once all gens are finished, and this was true even before EGC was released. any combination of the above factors causes drops to below 5 fps, not exaggerating.
---
I love spirit so much, but dang is she hard to play. I have trouble finding/seeing survivors enough as it is. Then add in I can’t see them at all while phasing. I’ve been practicing watching the grass wiggle while I’m chasing.
---
True dat,  meme is a meme :)
---
They just need to increase the % slightly, after you get 1 kill its not really needed as the rate gens are finished will drop massively.
---
Wait, is he permabanned?
---
Is this an issue on all platforms? I play on ps4 and I haven’t really played the same map twice in a row that often
---
Wonder if they can make it such that it's a first person shooter style, but no cross hair and no aim down sights, and shooting while moving lower accuracy, and the only weapon you have is a single shot rifle that needs to reload after each shot with the duration of wiping your weapon after hitting someone. Then rifle bash as M1. Hitting survivor in the head instantly puts survivor into dying state, hitting them anywhere else causes injured state. That might work and not be OP.
---
To be fair, guns are pretty sick.
---
To a Mori, lying either on the hatch or in the basement.
---
How is camping "fun" and "less toxic". Thoss don't go together whatsoever lol.
---
I would use the unbowed perk, these are some great concepts of perks for survivors.
---
Pig's don't hack, we play by the rules.
---
Oh, gotcha
---
I need this. I need this to be able to be bought with Iridecent Shards. and I need this. Please. BHVR. Please. I need this. This perfect
---
\*EXTREMLY HAPPY OINKING\*
---
Because the point of her power is to slow the game down, not get killers.
---
Explain to me, why should I let everyone live? I am the killer, it is my job to kill I won't play by these stupid rules.
---
I bought this and the Meters shirt from Teepublic. Both are way better than the official merch.
---
Aka every game that doesnt break connection 5 out of 6 times? Yeah. That must be nearly every game out there.
---
Such a annoying laugh tho
---
No problem, you really are kind though :D
---
Okay but he's ugly.
---
Not just one Killer. Plenty. Nearly everyone today. 5 out of 6 games. This is incredible. 
---
Thats not salt. Thats justified rage.
---
Sorry bb, btw I used this build with spirit and it was well worth the bloodpoints.
---
I got all except third seal on piggy already, so I'll give it a shot.
---
There literally is no objective after the gens are completeted, the only way to get some kills when all gates are open is to camp the last downed person, otherwise you might as well open the browser and watch YouTube. The only reason survs "don't have fun" is that they don't get to have everyone escaped.
---
Always go straight for the perk you want first on every bloodweb. Entity will consume the other available perk right after if any.
---
Wow
---
I sure atacked you calling out on your advertising
---
And dont tell me how to behave lool
---
And you also got youtube tutorials if you dont know what to do, but hey you think you gonna get super famous soo wtv
---
The bp is also a nice bonus, thx :)
---
I love the situations where mad grit works and people are trying to body block
---
Yeah but that's just it. I just don't care about their reaction. They get off on wasting people's time. Forcing them to watch as they are in a position of power over you. I take that away, say gg and go next game.
---
Use that to your advantage, climb the ranks, come across killers who will make you DC.
---
That’s bs, and shall remain BS until you cite your sources
---
Alright man, have a good day :)
---
WGLF def needs a buff, if it can show the aura of the killer for both the unhooker and the unhooked, then it might be as powerful as BBQ but otherwise it's just a waste of perk slot
---
I will
---
Get this self promotion bullshit out of here...
---
It would be a muzzle loader with a 1.5 minute cooldown and skill checks to make sure you don't spill the powder.  Also, it has a 50/50 chance of actually firing.
---
While it does fix one problem it introduces a lot more problems whereby survivors can abuse this, so I'm afraid it won't ever make it into the game. New animations maybe, but not the unhook thing.
---
Yea that’s this game too bc that literally never happens
---
Bond too high, Poised too low.
---
Personally I would move Surveillance to the B tier. Its one of those perks that gets stronger the longer the game goes and really can help against late game SWF groups.  I also feel that corrupt intervention is really a D tier perk, they delay is nothing for most games and just means they spend that time doing totems instead of gens
---
They aren’t defending camping. They’re defending the killers ONLY objective: Kill. You’re running off the assumption that this killer was camping all of his kills, but we don’t know that. If exit gates weren’t open and generators weren’t done, then yes, I would 100 percent say that this behavior is very unsportsmanlike and a load of horse shite. However, that isn’t the case. Also, you tell people not to insult you, and yet here you are insulting others. Hypocritical.
---
That would pretty much just be hatchets that can't arc over walls, I. E. Worse hatchets.  I suppose projectile speed would be different, but honestly, I doubt dbd could even handle a projectile moving that fast.  The whole game would probably freeze for a second whenever you fired!
---
Are you a Killer or a Survivor main?
---
Survival Instinct appears to be pretty strong. The tracking of scratchmarks alone would be amazing, seeing the Killer in addition to it... maybe a bit much.
---
Unbowed seems great!
---
I absolutely love Flight of the Rabbit, buuut again maybe 6 seconds is a bit long. 1/2/3 should be quite fine in addition to the sprint burst; 3 seconds during a chase with sprint burst is quite a long time
---
Anyone (dis)agreeing with me? I'd like to know, since I haven't been playing for too long but am pretty much 50/50 on Survivor/Killer. Let's see how far off I am
---
I honestly don't get why people think this. Once you've killed one survivor, the speed that they can repair generators is significantly reduced. There's no need to make Thanataphobia into Dying Light version 2. The only buff Thanataphobia needs is a slight percentage increase. Perhaps increase the rate gained per injured survivor. 4% action speed reduction for 1 injured survivor, 9% for 2, 15% for 3, 22% for 4.0
---
NICE!  good job
---
They might need some minor number tweaks, but overall nice ideas, that are not overwhelming powerful.
---
It has a 100% win rate out of 16games so far. DO NOT RUIN MY WINRATE!
---
If it was only the stalked Survivor that could break The Ghost out of stealth, it would be better, I think, but I'm curious as to what their solutions might be.
---
I'm really curious as to how the Dream World will work for new Freddy, if it's purely passive now. Honestly, I'm mostly excited for new Freddy than any other content on the way.
---
Also, any and all Bubba buffs are welcome. If his meter worked like the Billy's but he could move at full speed while charging, that'd be great, but I dunno how strong that might be.
---
You have corrupt intervention on Freddy and had it equipped on him before playing the splinter AS the plague?  The order of that is important
---
Take the L I guess
---
A Nurse's Calling, Whispers and Corrupt Intervention should be lower. Surveillance and Pop Goes the Weasel should be higher.
---
I've been seeing a lot of successful 360 survivors get a real hardon and love to tell me im worthless and i should kill myself in the chat if they manage to pull it off on me. And I'm just there jawdropped thinking what kind of person would say that.
---
Yea, it's pretty common for me to, not just heal option. When you play against Freddie you can't snap people out of sleep. All interactions with that person are negated.
---
I'm not saying that. I'm saying the traps are littrely not meant for killers they are meant to slow the game down. That is the entire purpose of the traps. I'm not a survivor main so stop making up bullshit and acaullty read what im saying.
---
Alot of us want to get vored by the hag. Not me tho, im normal i just wana get stabbed by daddy myers.
---
I have only been stunned by head on while searching the locker beside the one they jump out of. 
---
It's harder to hit a killer directly in front, than it is to stun them off to the side. Diagonal hits are the most consistent in my experience so far.
---
That doesn't make him opressive at all.
---
His map presence is strong, yeah. But he can get looped, so you can contain him in one area for a long time. He can only use his chainsaw if you don't know how to loop well.
---
&gt; Yeah but it’s still uncessary taunting and a bit of a dick move.
---
Of course, but not all taunting and dick moves are taking the game hostage. Survivors tbagging at the exit gate are not taking the game hostage with their dick moves because the EGC timer is still running. You're conflating being a dick with taking the game hostage.
---
I do deny that it's unfair, this player had the same opportunity that every other survivor had to escape and they failed. The killer acting like a dick isn't unfair, what does fairness have to do with it?
---
Oh god the accuracy.
---
Petition is in effect
---
Im a fan of surveillance too, especially combined with Brutal Stength. I could see it in B tier, its effect can be very useful. My reasoning ultimately came down to the lack of killers I see using it. 
---
Corrupt Intervention is good on the 110ms killers. Myers especially i think benefits from hearding the survivors closer in the early game.  Its great when using Fragant Tuft of Hair.
---
I see it as a weaker but more consistent Ruin.
---
I read the whole thing expecting a joke or some satire at the end...
---
I love that she is burnt to a crisp.
---
Hmm true, or maybe there is aim down sights but accuracy is decreased based on how "tired" you are? Like if you just got out of a chase or are in a chase, aiming down sights will cause your sights to sway a lot, making it hard to shoot accurately. We'd essentially have a sniper killer I guess? Killers would attempt to find vantage points, shoot to injure and then close in for the kill. Might be interesting. Bullets are a lot faster than hatchets so survivors have to try to bait the shot otherwise they instantly get injured.
---
For once a non blatantly op perk ideas
---
Why would I in the situation where ALL 4 survivors have traps on, not patrol gens? It is 100% stupid to not do it. You are either a stupid or a hardcore survivor main.
---
Flight of the rabbit should be the sprint burst rework in my opinion.
---
https://gbatemp.net/threads/ps4-firmware-collection.447573/
---
I got haddonfield 5 times in a row today. Piggy does not like this.
---
And when it fully releases
---
I had an rewind machine in my house lol
---
No more shocking than the people who straight up camp a person and nod their head at them as if camping is big dick energy. This whole game and community is fucked.
---
Yoiu. Arent. Reading. What. I'm. Saying. You. Blind. Fuck. 
---
I'm saying its a waste to even use all 4 traps on survivors in the first place.
---
I think not using traps is more of a waste than using them, but that is just a fact.
---
That sucks
---
Leatherfaces live a tough life. They live for moments like this unfortunately. I used to be an angry wraith but I don’t think I’d ever take it this far
---
I know what he was trying to say. That's why i said what i said because i liked his comment and upvoted it. What i said was what i did. Upvote him and the topic.
---
[You’re wrong](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/691087-playstation-4/75220881)
---
Because he could have just tainted the hatch and hooked them, instead of making them have to wait the WHOLE timer out? People don’t like holding the game hostage because it’s inconvenient- and a dick move. So before EGC when it was a thing, it fell under dick moves. This also counts as a dick move because the killer is intentionally winding up the survivor who has done nothing (or they probs wouldn’t post this).
---
So I think it is unfair, personally, and I understand why the dude was upset.
---
yes, putting them would make the game more fun imo.
---
&gt;I’m not one to care about tbagging and taunting and flashlights. But this right here is cancer.
---
"I don't care what survivors do, but killer bming is shitty!'
---
I mean, yeah, this LF just got the first 4k of his life and took the bming way too far, but what you said it still dumb.
---
You are. It's level 30.
---
Flight of the rabbit would be ridiculous. All you gotta do is run through the killer after being hit and you’re gone
---
Wow really?
---
You learn something every day
---
I'm done.
---
Thank god, I lost braincells by just reading your comments. Go annoy someone else.
---
Your wording seems to have backfired
---
Just playing the game without participating in the community, you definitely grow more bitter the more you play. I'm glad that I got the idea to look up the Subreddit and some nice streamers; sometimes you just meet so many toxic players that you just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore.
---
Knowing there's people out there who genuinely just want to have a fun time and make the game just as fun for others, win or lose, is very reassuring.
---
I play both Survivor and Killer, and people really need to calm down sometimes.
---
Survivors - even a 4K can be a good game. Your team doesn't win every trial. If you put up a good fight and the Killer was fair, it was a good game. Also, remember that the Killer is a human just like you, and without them you wouldn't be able to play the game at all. So don't be a dick.
---
Killers - you couldn't play without Survivors either, and even if they're fine dying after a good match, they will try their best to avoid that. That's okay. Pallets are there to annoy you, so are flashlights, it's not inherently toxic. Though the lines are blurry sometimes, do what Daenerys couldn't; break the wheel.
---
Yall dont like opinions... fuck all yall down vote this too hahaha.. I give no fucks.
---
chinese meal!
---
MegaMan?
---
That would be awesome if they would do that. Would gladly pay money for that :^)
---
That's not how that works buddy, its either toxic both ways or not!
---
Alright, just changed my perks. Thanks for the help
---
&gt; I bought DBD during this event and I was so thrown off when it defaulted back to the guitar themes
---
get the fuck out of here... that was literally my exact same experience! i was so dismayed when it changed!
---
Here is what I think of your Perk concepts:
---
**Survival Instincts:** On paper, this seems like an actually good Perk that provides tracking advantages for locating Survivors and Killers. What it basically seems to be is a combination of a weaker version of Bond plus a somewhat better version of Buckle Up. But in gameplay perspective, it doesn’t seem that powerful as it should be. 
---
First off, it’s just that: a weaker version of Bond. 
---
Second, even if you do get to see the Killer’s Aura after they smack a Survivor. it itself doesn’t really help you. Because chances are, for more than half of the aura duration, all they’re going to be doing is just sitting on their asses as they go into cool down. And you can also already see them, whether it be direct or because you saw another Survivor running and wriggling in fear as they scream.
---
**Unbowed:** Leaving less than normal amounts of blood as well as it disappearing faster looks good, but I can see it’s problems. 
---
First and most importantly, leaving less blood behind isn’t going to increase your chances of escaping a chase by a long shot, especially since you still groan (Which is why you should run this with Iron Will) and you can still leave Scratch Marks (Either run it with Lightweight or Urban Evasion). 
---
And one thing I’d like to point out, is that when comparing this Perk to my custom Perk, Strong Body, a Perk similar to this, it just seems my Perk covers more than what your Perk can. I don’t know if it’s because my Perk is too strong or not (No pun intended), but here is my Perk Strong Body for you to look at and compare:
---
You are 50% immune to the Mangled status effect.
---
When you get hit by the killer’s basic attack, the cool down their successful attack is increased by 20%/25%/30% for that particular hit. 
---
When in tier 3: Your thick blood coagulates practically instantly. You don’t leave pools of blood. 
---
**Flight of the Rabbit:** Honestly, I think this Perk actually looks good as it increases your getaway duration and also lets you leave no evidence behind on where you’re going next, which can work even better if you’re in indoor maps. Although the one thing I worry is that this Perk doubles your speed boost duration after being hit, and with Perks such as Balanced Landing, Sprint Burst, and Lithe, it would make this chase seem like a lost cause. And one second of a speed boost after being hit is already a big deal, so perhaps maybe nerf the duration just a little (Perhaps  .5 extra seconds?)
---
But still, keep up with the good work!
---
Does he kobe survivors into hooks?
---
I remember it was impossible to get a lobby as killer because Freddy just came out 😂
---
Bloodhound should be C tier imo.  It makes it essentially impossible to lose a survivor in a chase.  Otherwise pretty much my list lol.
---
That’s odd, you and I hang out with the exact same squad but I’ve never seen you before
---
Aside from the laughable Ghostface counter, i dont really understand OoO. If youre good enough to use it, i dont see why you need it.
---
I’ve been practicing hearing better to catch them.
---
wait I didn't know this game had different backgrounds
---
Yeah, someone telling someone they should kill themself over a game is no where near comparable to nodding during a face camp.
---
2 is greater than 1, but is it greater than 3? You're literally throwing away any more gains you might get on emblems for a silver devout with that mentality.
---
yeah it was my favorite part of his power. I worry that they're going to make him bland. It doesnt sound like the dream world is that bad to be in now. You might get hit by a low quality slowdown trap, and might touch a fake pallet? meh. and the terror radius changing to a different sound doesnt really matter.
---
This isn't a licensed idea (or maybe someone can think of a fitting character) but I'd love a feral/beast type killer, like a werewolf.
---
Could operate very different to other killers:
---
Low point of view (on all fours)
---
Slightly faster than 115%
---
Stronger tracking of blood but maybe reduced/no scratch mark tracking.
---
Can't vault windows, break pallets faster.
---
Maybe a lunge ability or something.
---
Maybe some creative interaction/power you can use on downed survivors.
---
I thought my idea couldn't get any better.  I have been proved wrong
---
Made sense to me just Reddit users being themselves.
---
This happens on xbox occasionally too.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty dumb right now. Fix the door spawns for sure and maybe make the animation to close the hatch take I don’t know...6 seconds? Just something to at least give the survivor an opportunity to get away as it’s being closed. Also maybe rework Left Behind to where the hatch can be reopened without a key? Not an instant open, but similar time  to cleansing a totem where the bar resets if you let go. I still don’t know if people would run it but at least the perk wouldn’t be 100% useless trash. Give the killer at least something else to think about besides just patrolling the gates. I don’t know.
---
Fair take
---
It would be OP as hell. Imagine losing a survivor every time you hit them.
---
I hope it runs well for all those Nintendo fans. I've heard a lot of ports to the switch have fps problems :/
---
I’ve heard people saying that you can listen for breathing and footsteps. I can hear the footsteps somewhat, but I’ve never heard the breathing. I am able to hear them in pain better now though.
---
This, of course barring that you can always quick turn and moonwalk to assure you get a chance to tag them if they do it. Most folk usually abandon the pallet when they are in deep wound. If they try to continue to shenanigans, just break the pallet and chase them.
---
I just started having survivors bodyblock me from behind after a pallet stun, and it stops you from kicking the pallet. It's a crazy how this game works sometimes
---
I've had many killers tell me I should kill myself and call me racist and homophobic slurs just because I looped them all game. It goes both ways.
---
No. I had plague. Had splinter for Freddy. Equipped corrupt intervention on Plague. Burned Splinter. Got Freddy with no perks or add ons
---
BHVR really got Ghostface ability on point...
---
Damn he looks thicc
---
You won't lose them for long
---
YES🦇♥️!!!
---
Hmm, Laurie for DS, or you can buy it from the shrine now. 
---
Ash has mettle of map, but is getting changed. I would wait to see what happens on the 18th because it will be either decent or horrible. As of now it is arguably the best perk. 
---
Is bill free? If not, BT is crazy good. I am on console so we get his perk for free
---
Meta for a lot of killers seem to be, bbq, hex ruin, and often times enduring and spirit fury, those these last 2 will alternate depending on preference, and killer, but you could always work towards that first
---
Is hag free? If not, prioritize ruin 
---
Spirit has spirit fury, Great with enduring, meta on most killers)
---
Clown has solid perks, bamboozled, and pop goes the weasel which is getting a buff, so slower killers can use it too. Both of these perks are strong, tho not seen as often, but regardless, they are good. 
---
Legion - discordance is solid, but not a priority. Will prob be nuts with the Freddy rework tho
---
Pig - surveillance, solid as well but not a huge priority. Pig has another perk, I forget the name but you can one hit someone after a rescue, super good on the hag. Apart from that, not a priority
---
Myers - save the best for last, solid on some killers such as legion, but def not a priority 
---
Plague is whatever
---
Can’t think of other killers atm, and what’s free. Hopefully I am not missing much
---
These are bomb as hell! I would love to have these, and the artwork looks great too! Good job.
---
Yeah trust me it’s true especially if you have decent headsets. I have gotten a lot better at hearing survivors during a chase or when they are healing behind cover.
---
yeah it gets fun during some events. the Halloween visuals and theme will always hold a special place in my heart &lt;3
---
I don’t deny that at all. People can be truly vile when it comes to sportsmanship in this game. I’m merely saying that was a poor comparison. What you stated would have been a more appropriate counter argument. Toxicity exists in both roles in this game, it doesn’t excuse such despicable behavior.
---
I had Haddon Field 3 times today. Trapper looves this. I guess it's Haddonfield Friday :)
---
That was my exact thought upon seeing this
---
Bill is a character from Left 4 Dead which is made by Valve who owns steam. Thus Bill will stay on PC.
---
nah
---
The biggest brain play here is for the "Meg" person to have head on, and the "Feng" person to make sure the killer sees them go into their locker so they're more likely to take them. 
---
If they grab Feng and try to bring them to hooks, ohhhh boy yeah
---
It's funny, you say that, but we have the *other* Freddy...
---
Yeah just started last week thanks to GamePass and this game is awesome ! Love playing both survivor and killer. Scary but not too much, and you can tell the 3 years of polish and content made an awesome game down the line, way better than when I tried it on PC on release.
---
If anything, I'd add it so if you hit the hooked person by accident while they are being unhooked, the unhooker takes the damage
---
Someone who credits artist in the title, never thought I’d see the day FeelsGoodMan
---
forever be pc exclusive
---
And blue jeans!!!!
---
I can’t argue with that :)
---
it's not. it would actually weaken him since now it would be harder to get the timing right near obstacles or hooks. so they're nerfing a weak killer again.
---
As a Nurse/Spirit main, Surveillance is probably my favourite perk. I run a gen grab build on Spirit.
---
I've seen a lot of cosmetic ideas that I've absolutely hated so far but this...
---
is the only one i've actually wanted
---
Lol. Theyre the most reliable perks you can have. You just clearly have absolutely no clue how to use them.
---
After reading some comments I decided to redo some of Rick's perks. Hope these are better!
---
Sadly he will never be on console. Wish the devs could work something out and give Xbox and ps4 there own survivor would be cool
---
it is. they're planning to nerf a weak killer again. it would take away the only real strength he has, which is defending a hook by holding the chainsaw charged.
---
I need to say that first two are fuckin awsome dude but that rabbit is average i think (sur. needs to have killer's perks counterplay and these two are that counter)
---
I like the idea of these perks, and I feel like they are strong enough to actually encourage different builds for different playstyles. Also the flavour text on them is great!!
---
Well remember the goal getting 60ffps across platforms and they have been doing a nice job at that but we will see how good FPS really is on chapter 12 what I’m worried is how downgraded they will have to make graphics for the switch cause right now for what we seen it looks pretty bad
---
I saw Surfer, ignored Cafe and was like "thats not surfer attire" xD its really good though.  that no glasses look is really pretty
---
im not a lore expert or anything but we do know that this world with the games and all that is created by the entity. im not sure what happens but its likely the entity would also control what happens to them after they escape - i dont think theyre just allowed to go back to the real world.
---
Depends on what platform. I play PC and I’m a killer main. Sometimes it takes more than just a few minutes. So now real fix other than to just wait.
---
That would look better than any of her current cosmetics to be honest.
---
6 seconds is a long time, especially if you're on a map like The Game
---
The flashlight weakness is gone.
---
I realized this after playing one match of KF2.
---
Back to dbd i went.
---
Yea it usually plays really nice (it can be a bit framey at times tho) and the sense of dread that constantly follows you adds to the tension.
---
I just bring it because I almost always play solo, and every other game I play it seems like other survivors just won't heal you.

Yeah, that is very true. The leatherface one hit close to home. Not a single LF was a nice, good player. I guess I understand.
---
Never really cared for hope. I thought it wasn't bad/good D or C tier at best.  Is it better now that the EGC has been implemented?
---
Okay that makes sense
---
yes
---
Try taking Stridor. It's god tier on spirit.
---
Granted, the ability is bugged massively, but I agree that the downside of having be ability disrupted if you’re looked at is completely unnecessary, and it just makes him a worse Myers.
---
*BEAN HERE ALL ALONG*
---
Ya not a hack but could be a glitch
---
If I held down S would this completely block them from vaulting the pallet until I hit them?
---
This. Regardless or it often being destroyed early, it remains to be a staple
---
I had the same thing happen to me last night. I couldn't heal survivors if we were in contact with a rock.
---
Farmer John posted this yesterday, but it’s still accurate. Can’t wait too try him when he’s buffed.
---
If they release him like that for live server that’s nuts smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I try my best to just be friendly in pre-game and post-game chat. It really helps with making people not be toxic towards you.
---
Positive reinforcement is glorious.
---
Well he’s right and wrong, you can hack the ps4 If on a lower firmware but you can’t access online until you update so you are both semi correct
---
I didn't know :)  that's cool
---
I know it'll delay release but I agree they need to change it some how
---
I haven’t seen the concept or was it just a wendigo from some other media?
---
99% sure it was on purpose because otherwise I would have seen them lagging everywhere. Is lag switching a bannable offense?
---
i love kyf, it's even more fun if you dont mute your friend tho bc u can tell them they just went full potato when they do stuff like that
---
It has to do with valve and tbh and that’s not going to happen he’s PC only for life
---
Hope is great. It gives the survivor an escape option when they need it most, namely at the end of the game when you are likely near death hook and there are necessarily less pallets on the map. Its not as versatile as Adrenaline (tho they are very powerful together) but it differenciates itself by not being an exhaustion perk, and the two minute timer gives it a wider use window. Plus its really fun zipping around the map.
---
Yep.
---
 [It was front-page for a couple of hours last night,](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bxm3zz/my_cosmetic_contest_entry_wendigo_hag/) but it's slipping down.
---
Goddamn the hatch bm is fucking hilarious. Having it done to you and doing it is just funny man. Gotta take the L now and then.
---
Balanced Landing is my favourite perk by far. I think it's probably my flair (on mobile at the moment). I'll do my best to let you know why I find it so strong.
---
After you start running it, you look for opportunities to use it in chases. You run upstairs or up a hill every chance you get. Killers think they have the advantage on a fall, but if you're running BL, you might be good as gone.
---
BL also gives you infinites on certain maps. It buys you time in a chase, and buys your team time if the killer continues to chase you. It lets you mind game someone from a drop. It's good enough that I've run a loop on Ormond while taking time to work on the gen on the second floor before they can catch up. We went around 4 times before they gave up.
---
I've tried using Lithe and when I started used Sprint Burst, and neither of those perks compare when I'm in a chase. (Lithe isn't a bad perk though)
---
I would GLADLY wait if they wanted to rework that shit no rush please don’t push him into game than bandaid do it before release
---
I’ve tried head on once, I jumped out with it primed and thanks to the delay I was grabbed instead of stunning him.
---
You are both semi right. You can hack on ps4 but only on a lower version and of course on a lower version you can’t connect online until you update and that makes you lose the jailbreak. And Sony is very fast to patch exploits. So while it is possible to hack it you won’t be getting online unless some how one person has a 0day and has not showed it to the public and some how Sony has not detected it
---
...
---
...Yeah, I got nothin'.
---
How is the Nurse broken? I only play her when I have a Daily so I’m not sure what you’re referring to...
---
Great work. Love the asthetic but I'm gonna have to vote no on the furry lol
---
This is beautiful.

Can’t get into killer lobbies. I’ve just started playing since game pass and I can only play survivor because I go to killer and it finds a lobby but no survivors. I tried waiting it out but to no avail. I really want to try out killer but this prevents that.
---
Balance fixes would be nice, but here's a hundred shirtless Daddy Myers memes instead
---
You feel me.
---
Me and the boys making the last survivor die by the entity
---
Where do I sign!
---
What the hell is wrong with people?
---
Thats actually low settings 👀 currently on PTB if you play full screen and change your graphics settings, it doesn’t do anything. You have to get off fullscreen, change settings, and put fullscreen back on. There’s a post around here with all the new hair changes at ultra quality though!
---
Which tracking perks would help in a chase when the survivor doesn't leave any blood or scratch marks?
---
Agreed.
---
I feel like aliens fast paced motiffe would work better in deathgarden though. Either way alien dlc for either game would be hype as fuck
---
then why is the temple so low?
---
Woah woah woah, she has way more options than camping and tunneling.
---
Considering his games are available on Xbox I can’t see why the Xbox version can’t have him.
---
And then one day, for no reason at all...
---
Same.  I actually refuse to use nurse due to the fact she is overplayed.  Trapper baby!!
---
It was the Multiple Killer glitch and one that would allow someone in the party to take on a spectator role, in both instances loading into ranked matches via Survive with Friends.
---
Obviously, these two glitches are the definition of balance issues in favor of either side, because you could have someone in the party reporting everything the killer does (which *is* complete bullshit) and having more than one killer in a match with less than four survivors. 
---
His intentions may have been innocent but they could have scary repercussions. The ban is deserved because he shared this with the community and that can give people a few bad ideas.

I'd like to do *something* though to make it more viable. I find that combining it with Sloppy Butcher alone just isn't enough, and it sure as hell doesn't help with generator progress.
---
Yeah I may have purchased a toolkit before starting up the perk web causing it to spawn sooner. I'll avoid that in the future, much appreciated!
---
Usually, I would too, but that just seemed way to suspicious.
---
Knowing how evil the Entity is, I bet they also get to drink some sweet hot chocolate.
---
just increase it a little is all it really needs
---
Now that’s a face I could sit on.
---
Wait, how about this?
---
Say the bonus for the dead survivor were to be half that for what normally causes the perk to activate? You also have to remember that it's also a 9% lower decrease than Dying Light.
---
Rofl that clickbait tumbnail
---
I have met several Wraiths who are godlike in chases simply by cloaking/uncloaking at right time. His skill cap seems quite high.
---
This is great! LOL! Thanks for sharing!
---
Frank be like NYAAA

God tier spirit build - ruin, nurses/franklins, bbq, surveillance/discordance.
---
The entity will usually start by consuming a perk, most times you must go directly for the perk once the entity starts appearing in your web, at some point you will have 2 different perks/teachable per blood web, once you take one the entity will immediatly take the other (to prevent you from taking 2 in one bloodweb). It will also take a perk if you take too long to reach one of them and if it takes both you basically just wasted bloodpoints, so its better to go straight for one perk at the start.
---
If you wise up to this you can also force the entity to take out many items in the bloodweb so you level up faster, search a youtube video with an example so you know what I mean. I.E leaving the entity to take a node with multiple items so it takes them out in one turn making the bloodweb less expensive to move tot he enxt level.
---
I used it before the changes, but now it's just not worth it to me. Ironically, I replaced it with "We'll make it" and mostly just heal other people now while staying injured unless I happen to have a medkit or run into another survivor.
---
Another example of reddit bandwagoning hivemind.
---
Oh this post has negative -1 karma? LET ME JOIN IN, NOT CARING WHAT THE ACTUAL COMMENT'S MEANING IS. IF THEY DOWNVOTED IT, THEN I MUST TOO!
---
I hope it's not delayed, I need my new hairs.
---
Nice!!!!! Thanks! Have you seen when it's coming out for mobile, by chance???
---
Nurse is harder to play, yes, but the fact that one character has higher skill cap still means this character is overpowered.
---
Nah they just need to combine it with No One Left Behind or something to increase altruistic action speed by some amount.
---
But it doesn't happen on my consoles or my phone, so I'm not sure how it could be the connection. I did an internet test and everyone is optimal. Like I said the connection is fine, as I have no problem joining and playing without others. It's just kicking me for some reason 30 sec in. Non steam games are working fine.
---
Yeah I don't see how it's unfair either, this wasn't a 1v1, I see 3 other skulls there so he had 3 other teammates. Why didn't they get the gens done and escape? Would you have said this was unfair for the killer if he had escaped before EGC finished?
---
Sure it's a dick move, dick moves happen. People who disconnect at the start of a match are dicks to.
---
Grandma fashion Kate!
---
Yeah that would be nice to have. I have to level up my nurse first. She’s level 2.. I’m pretty new to the game. My highest is hag at 35, second is pig at 15.
---
The fact that you know 4 languages is incredible. That's extremely rare.
---
Then u down her and she DCs
---
Yeah, a lot of people do. Takes a bit to get used to.
---
These are the cosmetics feng min DESERVES
---
That ban was pretty unfair. He did an exploit that has been in the game for a month now and the devs ban him instead of fixing it. It’s incredibly scummy and it is BS thing too do.
---
Omg same, and thanks lol
---
the scratch mark one is really interesting, while there are other perks which can allow you to detect and notice other survivors, being able to see the path the killer will most likely follow is a huge advantage to oneself.
---
As the other sexy as hell pink ace: I can confirm this story.
---
I think his main power right now is the gen teleport,and the dream world is kind of like a passive ability.Also they mentioned an addon that slows down survivor action speed(not as much as now though)
---
Survival Instincts - Meh, basically a terrible Bond and Alert meshed into one perk.
---
Unbowed - Cool perk. Can finally create the ultimate stealth build without having to use No Mither
---
Flight of the Rabbit - Pretty OP. I would tone down the hidden scratch marks to maybe 3 seconds at max level.
---
They shouldn't have to wait for cosmetics just for when the killer comes out hopefully that'd be super lame
---
dvhr doesnt care about weak killers or strong killers
---
they do whatever swf groups say
---
cannibal upsets those groups because he can camp
---
Oh I know what you meant, just that I can see why people thought you meant something else
---
No mither fuckin sucks and I don’t know why people use it
---
Yeah I got the impression that you were saying it was unfair in the sense that: They deserved to escape, or the odd were improperly stacked against.
---
Survivors who sandbag and sabotage their teammates, or disconnect are the ones that create unfair matches.
---
Well Thanks 🙂
---
Learning Languages are important imo.
---
Belgium has 2 offical Languages Dutch and French
---
We need to learn both, second we get English in school because its a world language.
---
Then Arabic due im Maroccain.
---
Everyone keeps saying Survival instincts is a worse Bond, but thats not its purpose. You can see \*your own\* scratch marks as well, and can see the killer's aura after he hits \*you.\* its designed to help you break chase and more efficiently mindgame -- now you can see the path you're leaving and manipulate that to your advantage. It is niche, yes, but I think it would still be useful.
---
Wait is he actually called “The Ghost Face”
---
My ass forgot to close my phone so I been butting typing lol
---
Ohh no haha my bad
---
well it wasnt a joke...
---
My grammar is bad i guess.
---
I said "Upvote for me" That guy is the 'me' which i upvoted. I agreed with his comment.
---
This would be an insta but as soon as I have the shards for it, I really hope this along with that subtle flower (something like that) Claudette win!
---
Are... are you sure thats tunelling? I see you're saying yes but the votes are saying no.
---
I forgot to close my phone so I was butt typing lol
---
This cosmetic idea is fantastic and now I want it.
---
yes! its not supposed to be used like bond, it lets you see what the killer does. Bond isnt going to tell you 'oh shit there are scratch marks everywhere here I should gtfo of the terror radius' or 'my tracks make it seem like I jumped in the locker, time to urban evasion it outta here.'
---
Yes i see...
---
Wish people would first try to find out what i meant instead of downvoting me. I'll lose Karma even tho i dont know what that is.
---
I would actually buy this
---
Are you perhaps on console? At least on PC it is widely agreed upon that Nurse is the best killer, by a large margin. She's difficult to play sure, but she completely ignores walls and pallets, two of the main mechanics that survivors have to combat the killer. A good Nurse has exceedingly little counterplay. At the highest levels most killers you are going to see are Nurse, Hillbilly and Spirit.
---
tbh idk why Unbowed hasn't been introduced yet, great perk
---
Flight of the Rabbit is also very interesting and I see myself running it if it was ever a thing!
---
I’m not saying I don’t heal I’m just saying it’s annoying af when your teammates expect you to heal them all the time and it’s a waste of time to go around the map looking for someone to heal you. If someone is downed and the killer leaves them would you wanna run up and have to heal them the whole way or have them recovered so it doesn’t take as long? Same logic also applies, get a head start healing and when you find another survivor/they find you then they can finish the rest. Or how about if someone else is healing you and then the killer starts chasing them and you’re on your own?
---
Sacrificed
---
I run BBQ,STBFL, Bamboozle and brutal strength. They destroy pallets pretty well BBQ is for tracking and STBFL is just good. Now with the release of GhostFace when he comes out I can see thrilling tremors become decent on trapper as it shows you where to pressure survivors. Now if you don't have alot of DLC I would run whispers,brutal strength enduring and hex:ruin. It's a simple but effective build as trapper can trap his hexes and if someone triggers your trap you know someone is around your hex totem.
---
Going postal in style.
---
For the Face Camp challenger I'd switch out Spine Chill for Decisive Strike.
---
That way you can unhook yourself and then DS away from the camper.
---
Yeah, I know. Fuck me for not putting the "/s".
---
We should get a 20second entity blocker on kicking a gen, time should decrease depending on the amount of survivors in trial. Make pressureing gens easier.
---
Ohhh ok, thanks
---
Third seal is really good against SWF
---
Aww schucks!
---
i dont like where this is going
---
My personal winner right now
---
Place traps in paths between loops so they are less obvious. Bring bamboozle so you dont need to waste time trapping main. Keep a trap on you, threaten to place it at a loop to force the survivor away, if you guess right thats a hit.
---
I think you’re missing the point of thrilling tremors. It isn’t meant to slow the game down. It’s meant to show you what gens survivors are working on. The only thing I would change about it is to allow the killer to kick blocked gens.
---
Do you have a donate button set up?
---
These perks need downsides to being used. Cool ideas, but very unbalanced. Like a downside to running Unbowed is that you hemorrhage easily leaving bigger pools of blood or that your blood flows bright red, but disappears quicker and Flight of the Rabbit is too samey to Unbowed with leaving no pools of blood or scratch mark's. It could be a perk that activates similarly like Mettle of Man.
---
Can you imagine walking home at dusk and seeing this thing?
---
Deal!
---
I would take lower quality graphics at 60 fps on ps4, but I'm used to 30 fps on some games and 60 on others. I was born in the lower fps'
---
That's actually a pretty good mechanic in general for a killer.
---
It also was him against his friend so no random was caught in it and negatively affected by it
---
Imagine thinking a map that regularely spawn with 12+ safe pallets is killer sided.
---
I mean, your point is valid, but I find that if the counterplay is "just don't hit the guy", that's its own problem.  Sure, you will eventually run into him again when there's noone around to protect, but games don't really last long enough to be able to continually pull that off if they are always trying to make a point of being in your way.  
---
  
---
I agree, it's activation requirement is better than previous, but it's not exactly difficult to get to, either.  I suppose DS was in the same state, but the counterplay of leaving them on the ground was at least still offering some progress to your objective, where as "walking away" doesn't.
---
Yeah, I’m console so we don’t have as many nurses because she doesn’t work as well due to frame rates and whatnot. That could explain it.
---
What do they mean by pellets or snares?
---
I love the idea of having the Spine Chill icon on the bag! As a gamer, it makes sense for Feng to have meta stuff like that for her cosmetics. This whole idea is great, I hope you win!
---
I’m running for office, so yes you can donate to my political campaign. My 2020 platform is to delete Nurse from Dead by Daylight.
---
not entirely true, they also care deeply about what rank 20 noobs want. for example, notice how the above post mentions how they're dropping Freddy's aura reading because "new players" didnt understand it.
---
So with red paint brush all survivors start in the dream world and failing a skill check does not wake them up. How do you get out of the dream world then? Do you just wait to be hooked?
---
I'm a trapper main, and this post was put together not too long ago, have a look :) my pro tips are in the comments, and if you habe any questions you could always send me a message, but this should help you a bit! https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bxwih0/dummies_guide_to_the_trapperkinda_long_and_very/

---
As a fellow Nurse main, I need your vote! Surely we, more than anyone, know that she too much gooder than the other killers and must be stopped!
---
well but not imposible. ik was a hard job...
---
Yep
---
Boooooo

I love this lunatical rambling, I relate to it greatly

---
Excuse me I play solo survivor still because I hate myself. No way I'm depending on these baddies. Being able to self-heal has gotten me the hatch plenty times too where I would have otherwise been downed on first hit
---
I'm so sorry, I know its auto correct but I saw 
---
"I've been mailing Legion"
---
The dad jokes just come out sometimes
---
Camping and tunneling is the main reasons for survivors DC'ing. Camping usually ends with killer getting free and undeserved NOED kills at the end and tunneling is impossible to counter because injured Survivors make so much noise. It gets kills but survivors will eventually respond with something more toxic again like looping.
---
They explained it in the dev stream. Freddy has two main mechanics that his new ability is based on. He can teleport to gens, and can either put down dream snares or fake pallets, apparently changing based on what add-on you use. Dream snares work similarly to Hag traps but only affect sleeping survivors and slow them down when they are triggered. Dream pallets work similarly to the Doctor's Order pallets, but can only be seen by sleeping survivors and require Freddy to manually place them around the map and explode into blood when survivors try to throw them down.
---
The Wraith change actually affected him a ton, which just goes to show how weak he was before.
---
They won't stop me.
---
Tunneling can be countered with DS and you can lose the Killer with Iron Will or Lightweight so your scratch marks disappear faster. The Killer is there to kill and not to help survivors escape lol.
---
Kinda wish I added more tips to it and space it out more so it didn't look like a wall of text but hey ya learn as ya go on. The next guide is going to be about either Clown or Wraith.
---
I didn't camp at all as the Hag in my first three games.  Maybe at higher levels?
---
And tunneling?  Why?  I figure I'll just patrol three gens and let my traps find you.
---
Pig=upvote
---
Not surprised
---
Tell me about it. Sometime I’ll hit DS in the middle of nowhere, and it won’t accept the fact I hit it. Feelsbadman

I like how the daily unlike others wants you to do 3 things:

1)Lean stalk
---
2)Mark
---
3)Hit
---
You know what else is bad? Ghostface is licensed so we'll likely get Ultra Rare ghostface splinter offerings taking up space on our bloodwebs.
---
These are great. Loving the Clown outfit.
---
Spirit.
---
I love these!
---
AngryPug has been nerfed if this becomes common knowledge
---
A big part of why I want the option to choose from all the music the game has used is because of this very theme. It's fucking amazing.
---
Right? It already hard enough to
---
1. Get close enough to stalk, and lean while doing it (finding a good spot to lean and actually get the lean to work)
---
2. Mark the survivor fully without being seen first
---
3. And actually be able to hit the survivor IF you get the full stalk off
---
Some are safer than others, cause killers can't mind game them.
---
I’m sorry I confused STBFL with PWYF. PWYF is good on her lol
---
Where do we vote for these in the contest? Because I fucking needed to vote for this. Love everything about the outfit, love that it's feng, and beyond that I love how much effort you put into this. 10/10 would buy this skin
---
I'd love the head without the hat and would make the body similar [to this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1751/5137/products/Simplee-Halter-off-shoulder-summer-dress-women-Ruffle-backless-high-wasit-chiffon-dress-Casual-pink-short_28a2cd65-3faf-4e2a-b72e-92b49ad5cb6b_1024x1024.jpg?v=1534517861) so that would still work as separate pieces
---
Now that you mention it... we haven't gotten splinters since Pig. Clown, Spirit, Legion and Plague are DLC killers, but they didn't get splinters... We did with doc and hag, if it's the licensed thing.
---
not being able to move while stalking would probably be the next worst thing after losing your power if a survivor sees you
---
Next survior is a hunter for sure
---
I get that they're good perks, but when the majority of your games is a killer running those perks, it gets stale and frustrating.  Nothing I can do about it though, so I guess that's that.
---
where did they say they promised us? source?
---
I'm on ps4 and have this issue with autohaven.
---
 So how can I play with friends and have them save?
---
Flight of Rabbit on ps4 sounds like a nightmare. Survivors already pop out of existence with dark clothes due to frame-rate
---
It was never promised, it was just shown in concept art once, they have explained many times it would be very difficult to make, as the hoodie hood and ears would be a headpiece and wouldn’t really work when added to other tops.
---
it took like what 2 years for the ds rework? bhvr isnt known for being fast
---
Last year, around June or July, during one of the weekly streams, they said they were already working on the 3D model. I cannot link you to it right now, but you can find links to that stream on other posts about the cosmetic.
---
its really not as many as you might think after returning for 1 day :)
---
I don't have a issue, it's just what i do to prevent DC's. I tunnel from time to time and camp if i hear footsteps but it's not my strategy going in. My survivors earn more points and send me thank yous
---
yeah weird how he's just a blatant rip off. have you noticed how the pig wears that mask from the SAW movies?

I need this

Gotcha haha.  Ales more sense!
---
Do we get a small buff to PWYF in the upcoming patch?
---
I guess they have their priorities. Besides, if Bunny Feng was to come, it'd probably be AC only. Shame.
---
Hag is really missing some good skins, the medusa one is awesome, but the rest are just meh.
---
I like to use her fully black, since hasn't any other good skin.
---
I disagree. All you need is a good headset and you are good to go
---
I think power is fine as is, just make sure the survivor is facing (not just camera) and unobstructed view. Also hooked and down survivors should not be able to detect
---
They even added a burn victim with a striped sweater! The balls on these devs!
---
Would you believe me if I told you I completed this in one game? The trick is to not be immersed and just stalk while they’re running away and shit
---
Plague, even if people don't use the fountains, it's just a gen rush. Also It's a fight among survivors just to gain any altruism playing against her since there's no healing going on.
---
The gun:
---
Power: gun point
---
New status effect, Ruptured:
---
Comes in three tiers, is deepwounds but worse, the survivor can heal themselves while inflicted however upon the lapse of the timer(30 secs) its effect will be applyed.
---
Ruptured 1:
---
Upon the lapse of the timer the survivor will be damaged one health state.
---
Ruptured 2:
---
Upon the lapse of the timer the survivor will be put in the dieing state.
---
Rupture 3:
---
Upon the lapse of the timer the survivor will be sacraficed (unique animation). Survivots effected by this will not have their rank or items effected.
---
All survivors in the trial will receive a fear guage, depending how full the guage is effects how long stuns inflicted by the killers power will last.
---
The killer starts with 3 bullets, each one coresponds to a ruptured status effect:
---
-bullet 1: ruptured 1
---
-bullet 2: ruptured 2
---
-bullet 3: ruptured 3
---
The killer has the ability to choose whether or not to shoot a bullet or the blank, both will give different effects.
---
Pressing CTRL will allow the killer to switch between bullets and blanks, in addition they may spin the magazine to randomise the ressult.
---
Load bullet: 100% fear guage on survivors observeing or in chase with the killer.
---
Load blank: 0% fear guage on survivors observeing or in chase with the killer.
---
Spin the mag: 50% fear guage on survivors observeing or in chase with the killer.
---
While the survivor is dropping or vaulting a pallet or window the killer may fire a blank shot to stun them for a maximum of 5 seconds and a minimum of 1 second, upon the blank being fired the survivors fear guage will be depleated by 25% of its maximum possible value.
---
Upon the killer useing their last bullet they will loose their power, be reduced to 110% movespeed and the end game colapse will start.
---
Daily Bunny Feng Min thread. Like holy shit this is insane.
---
kinda annoying how she can make you sick even if youre on the ground/hook. like imagine if myers could down a survivor and then stalk them till he's almost t3
---
Trapper and Hag.
---
I could write an essay about how annoying it is to play against them.
---
Alright I'll wait for her, she does seem pretty fun. Last 2 questions because you seem pretty knowledgeable about this game. I was thinking about buy the Ash vs Evil Dead DLC because I'm a huge fan, is Ash worth it as a survivor? Also is there an effective way to generate enough in game currency to buy a killer like Plague? Thanks!
---
Is this a Drake &amp; Josh reference?
---
I'm guessing it was a late skill check :/ unlucky. Should be fixed.
---
Hillbilly. It's not fun to face him 6 times in a row with 4 of those Hillbilly's being different players.
---
Nah man, Spirit is far more than “hit, phase, catchup/listen, hit again.”
---
It should block generators that are being worked on
---
"Flight of the Rabbit" is soo good I am literally missing it now ingame, thanks! :(
---
Well I already bought the game, but I will for sure hold off on buying DLC right away.
---
A Doctor that is 3 gen strating but also not actually hitting anybody or committing to chases. I get tired of all the screaming and his endless laughter annoys me.
---
You started playing in November therefore you have no idea the progress this game has made since beta.  I get frustration because I have it to on some parts, but you have no room to talk.
---
mix of Trapper, Nurse and Spirit. Spirit and Nurse because it's all on the killer's skill, you dont actually dont have a chance if the killer is good.
---
Trapper because setting a beartrap isn't an outplay.
---
Looks like she's ready for horse races. Or tea and brunch in her mansion's garden.
---
I mean, the power is supposed to be extremely contagious so it makes sense from a gameplay stance to infect downed survivors to infect new people
---
Shirtless Myers won't happen, this CAN happen but they didn't promise anything, just said some stuff about it being hard to make, also would be kinda impossible to juke a killer with the bunny ears lol
---
*BAAA DEEE YAAA*
---
In-game currency is earned by level ups. I think you may earn more as your level gets higher. You’re looking at 100-300 currency per level up at low ranks and a killer costs around 9,000. So I wouldn’t *advise* it.
---
Ash (currently) has the most broken, dumb perk in the game but as of the 18th its being nerfed twice over and turned into a pretty trash, low-mid tier. His other two perks are pretty trash, unfortunately.
---
Spirit is annoying, but at least the killer has to be good for her to work well
---
and wraith is supposed to be stealthy but how often does he actually sneak up on you?
---
When they were fucking around with the match making bs a few months back, I got stuck playing the swamp 10 times in a row, 6 as survivor, then said fuck it and went to play killer :( 4 more matchs in the swamp with Myers! I FUCKING HATE THE SWAMP!!!!
---
Nurse main here, too. I'll donate if you agree to give me tax breaks on bloodweb items.
---
Disagree. Legion isn't the best but easily works. I've gotten to rank 1 ever since his update and before.
---
Legion with save the best for last actually means you dont Always need frenzy either. No point in using frenzy even if they aren't injured if everyone is injured. Yes he has map pressure. Not as good as a hillbilly of course but hitting 1 survivor and running directly towards another 32+ meters away isn't bad either. Perhaps it's the player mostly and not the killer?
---
More than you’d think.
---
And on that day, no real valid point was made in the r/deadbydaylight community
---
open your eyes my man
---
The doctor's real ability is to annoy the shit out of the survivors
---
Upvoting this simply for the throwback reference of the title. I laugh every time someone does this for The Ghost Face. I feel a kinship with all of us that remember and it just makes it ass that much less scary.
---
I was telling people how funny I think it’d be if his camera didn’t always wanna work during a mori or he’d get frustrated from a bad pic.
---
Nurses Calling is S 
---
See the survivor, through walls and clear as day, while they’re at their most vulnerable state
---
Does a permanent dull totem mean it can't be cleansed until/if it lights up?
---
Oh, you're one of those people who makes fun of other people's laughs
---
How is nurses lower
---
I can't look at it in the same way after that shit dude😂
---
We must salute this fine man!
---
What they're calling "awake" here was called "Micro Sleep" in the official presentation, so I think that's probably the intention. The survivors briefly wake themselves up with a clock or whatever, but immediately start nodding off again and eventually end up fully in the dream world.
---
Alright NASA chill out
---
He did do them in PTB, as per his last YouTube video. Right? Because Ghostface was there.
---
Plague and Clown, i also despise Wraith (i mean, mostly the players who use him to camp or tunnel even in freakin' red ranks ffs)
---
No it can’t activate, but can be cleansed for extra points. Basically so that it can’t be inaccessible if NOED or haunted grounds activates.
---
Your ideas will get upvoted because players are awful game designers, but I want you to know that it's utter garbage.
---
 that's so dumb tbh, such a better game with friends
---
Kinda sounded like the doctors in the beginning
---
His goal-kill. He succeeded. Your goal-survive. You failed. There are no rules he has to adhere to to appease your ego.
---
hope you have as much fun as I did playing killer!
---
A petition for DLC with his tongue sticking out a la Scary Movie
---
well, thanks for your feedback.
---
Tbh that would make up for how shit his character is😂
---
Flight of the rabbit would make the game more interesting but we all know the killers would butch claim it’s to OP
---
These are great perk ideas, usually when someone posts their perk ideas they are either totally useless or game breaking, but these are actually pretty good. The only change I would make is with the rabbit one, the fact that it rewards the survivor for messing up and getting hit doesn’t seem right. Perks like lithe and dance with me do basically the same thing, but a survivor has to earn the reward, with the bunny one the survivor gets rewarded for doing badly, and the killer gets punished for hitting the survivor. That was the issue with the original DS, survivors got rewarded for getting downed. At least then they still had to hit a skill check and their was juggling, with yours there isn’t really any counter-play for the killer at all, and survivors don’t have to earn it.
---
Tbh I feel like this should be the theme music to play while you have Michael selected as your killer (where he is the one on the main menu). Like how they did for all of the killers who have their on special version of the music. 
---
It **IS** the Halloween music after all. Just think it would fit him.
---
Seriously. This isn't bad or anything, but Kate isn't the sit in the nursing home listening to Johnny Cash type. Give this girl some of that "young and beautiful" flair.
---
Fighting Wraith on Lery's is great. A good player with add ons will pop out of nowhere with zero terror radius, or make you think he's right next to you.
---
That’s a good start, but I think an up survivor breaking the Ghost out of stealth may still be too powerful of a counter. I like the idea of looking at the Ghost interrupting his stalk only.
---
Fits the character aswell
---
If you look at huntress with Iri head. She kills herself.  
---
If you look at clown. Perma intoxication  
---
Look at the hag or trapper. No more traps.
---
lerys is very different from most maps. wraith and micheal both have a huge advantage there
---
Yeah. Wraith needs a buff. Make him Freddy invisible vice Predator invisible.
---
It's one of the ways for a bad, unskilled killer to try to guarantee at least one sacrifice.
---
I wish they would too! These perks that people create make more sense than the garbage perks BhVR keeps dumping out! What would be cool is if they took someone’s 3 perks and implemented them for a month and then rotate to someone else’s.
---
if he was 100% invisible he'd be too strong
---
I understand that the goal as the killer is to kill survivors, but when I’m going in with 3 perks that are basically useless to get achievements, and I have literally no defense because of the Feng min wasting pallets, wtf am I suppose to do? I don’t have an ego for just wanting to enjoy a match of dbd.
---
One character is licensed from the movie, the other licensed from the costume company.
---
The last one would be broken on console with limited turning speed for killers, add in some corn and even pc killers will just DC lol.
---
This is just... no.
---
I wouldn’t say speed when most of the match you are going to be walking cause of that sprite burst. Then after you use that the other two perks become useless so now you’ve wasted two perks slots.
---

---
Current freddy you have to wait 7 seconds before you can even attack anyone. An uncloaked wraith is more powerful.
---
I just want a kill with friends mode. Me and the boys on one survivor. Teabagging pallets with a pig while Doc shocks and plague vomits on them.
---
The dream...
---
Honestly these 3 perks would go perfect with some kind of hunter survivor
---
&gt;I don’t have an ego for just wanting to enjoy a match of dbd.
---
And neither do the killers.
---
So you’re saying you know going in that you’re gonna be at more of a disadvantage than normal but wish the killer would take it easier on you?
---
Spirit 
---
Against Spirit everything is just a one-sided guessing game in the Spirit player's favor. Passive phasing and lacking a vault animation are incredibly unfun to be screwed over by and they're not even mechanics the Spirit is in control of.  Even when you guess correctly and you manage to lose the spirit when she's phasing, you can't even see her mistake and adjust your plays from what she did wrong. 
---
At least when Nurse is ignoring nearly all of the game's mechanics you can see and can adjust to her playstyle.
---
Doctor + bbq = profit 
---
You can thank me later.
---
Yeah, ever since the nerf, I've been experimenting with builds without it. I've adjusted my playstyle accordingly - now, I try to avoid even being near or being seen by the killer (unless I'm being a martyr). Spine Chill helps.
---
TOO FUCKING RELATABLE
---
I never said I wanted the killer to take it easy on me. I didn’t just get tunneled. He was going to tunnel and camp whoever he can find. I’m just more annoyed by the fact that his only reply to my messages was “EZ” like he thought he was a god killer.
---
If you down a survivor in less than 10 seconds, they should DC. If you tunnel a survivor  he doesn't get to play the game = he should DC. Let's stop wasting our fucking time here. Fucking astonishing to see people complaining about a natural defense mechanism against this game's bullshit
---
I'm having a blast. It's the most fun I've had playing Video games, in a while :D
---
SWF is a free win game mode, give the killers something fun.
---
I don’t even go into SWF with killers to be toxic, I just go in with my one mate so I have someone to talk to lmao
---
Bad Blood would be a more fitting Yautja. The crazed hunter would be happy to slaughter defenseless survivors. I do appreciate that you acknowledged Predators not hunting unarmed people though.
---
That's one of the reasons I hate most killers. If you perform well and loop their ass (no flashlight, no tea bagging, no toxicity) for 5 minutes = guaranteed facecamp. They get so fucking bothered.
---
After a long day of drinking he just wants to go home and eat his wife and kids.
---
So basically you’re just salty? Just a game my friend don’t take it so seriously. Cheer up buttercup and onto the next match.
---
Never happens. Apparently 95% of killers are stinking tryhards.
---
Just solo survivor things
---
Everyone here is saying that third seal doesn’t hide the boxes, I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure it does.
---
yes please
---
and fixing the camera bug
---
Well it’s wireless so I guess xD
---
Billy. Too many people play him, at least in mid-low ranks. It’s not even a difficultly thing. I just long for diversity.
---
As the flair says.
---
Half of reddit is old enough to remember VCR’s.
---
Relax, granddad.
---
Oh, thanks friend!
---
Is that mask still used by a scavenger in Death garden after the change? It might be Meg's mask now. Lol
---
That’s actually really cool, any other things you’d consider interesting about the experience you have?
---
Maybe you dont but a lot do. No wonder hes being dirty. The devs released some stats recently where survivors have something like a 70-80% survival rate at the moment.
---
Big tiddy doc gf
---
2 seconds later; killer DCs like the type of baby they all are.
---
And I'll look down and whisper... Yes!
---
I know but i wanted the bio to be understandable to people who don't know predator lore.
---
I mean I think there’s a bit of difference between ranting about getting tunneled and wishing people would get banned for it. But don’t worry I’m sure some killer out there wishes people would get banned for repairing gens so meh.
---
YOU’RE SO MEAN
---
If a survivor gets downed ten seconds into the game then that was probably their fault considering that's the time when the killer is at their weakest. Getting downed from your own failure then ruining the game for three other people sounds a bit silly.
---
also this post is nearly a month old
---
Tbh, if somehow part of the money for the cosmetics went to the respective artist, I would actually pay for this. Like this shit is quality, they put so much thought and planning into this. They offered alternative patterns and designs, even went so far as to think of physics for it. Like I would actually buy this with money if the artist got commission from it
---
There’s survive with friends. You can actually save the load out if you play the main game and unlock the perks the old fashioned way
---
survivor going down instantly/killer getting looped for 5 gens+altf4
---
Yep. Its really annoying. If killer DCs we should be getting a free pip, not lose one.
---
nice footwork
---
but whats wrong with his ability
---
People usually suggest garbage or overpowered perks. While the third one sounds real damn annoying to go against, these are actually great ideas.
---
You just got an express pass to college. Clown college that is fool.
---
Oh dang, I might hold off on Ash then.
---
I know it’s an and unpopular opinion but I liked the remake of nightmare on elm street better I thought it was much more scary not that  Robert England isn’t scary just that I don’t really like comedy intruding in the horror it just makes Freddy a joke not scary.
---
Poor little fella :(
---
- PS4
---
- Survivors lose rank progress when killer disconnects from match.
---
Oh shit, that sounds awesome! Thanks!
---
Judging from this, it's looking like this is a killer's tier list cus there's no way shelter woods ain't in complete garbage tier
---
The little moments like crouch dancing with a pig is what makes this game whole for me. It’s the nuggets of community fun
---
You say one is secured safe, but in reality everytime I play leatherface I tantrum infront of the lockers and the survivors ALWAYS come out and get hit. So they would probably both end up dying from my tantrum. You know, unless they were smart lmao (rank 8 killer btw)
---
According to a Huntress main friend if a Survivor is hooked in the basement it will go off non-stop and won't alert you to anyone entering the basement. This makes the only real use of the perk completely redundant, essentially only having it serve as a chest defense perk and nothing else.
---
Stop shaming players.
---
Nope. Either you waste time looking around the place if Whispers procs or the added time for the speed boost + no scratch marks or blood allows them to escape Whispers radius.
---
Sprint burst shouldn’t be changed
---
Should've replaced his mask with a clown mask
---
he got greedy that's why he lost.
---
How is this a fix? The simple fix should be that survivors need to face their character towards you to cancel the power, not only the camera
---
I really think Behavior is too scared of change. Yes I don't expect ground-up perk reworks every other Sunday but why the hell did it take us all the way to version 3.0.0 for Streetwise to be buffed? Why does Solidarity only heal you 50%, why does Flip-Flop only give you a maxium of 50% struggle bar, and why is Behavior terrified of buffing these numbers at least for a week or two? Is their code seriously such thick sphagetti that changing something as small as a single precentage value will destroy the game?
---
There is the new "battle pass" (think it's the altar or sowt) which has challenges within it, that might work.
---
Nope, the masks look different now :D
---
Clayface, 
---
special ability: shoots survivors
---
Honestly? I think Pig=upvote.
---
Then don't try to loop around corners. If a Killer is ~~running Beast of Prey~~ moonwalking to mindgame you at corners just run somewhere where you can see them better.
---
You don't depip, you black pip however it shows a depip. I tested this myself.
---
Xbox One

* Huge Problems with Servers - Disconnecting 5 out of 6 games because 'Host disconnected'
---
I thought that at first but when I went off the menu I had derailed from 6 to 7 so apparently not
---
He is doing his best.
---
Imagine thinking the state he's at on the PTB is what he'll be on live :^)
---
What do you dislike about lettuce hag
---
I feel like he is perfect for the game: Traps, lasers cloak and more. He is humanoide and cool.
---
sOMEone dude read "The Ugly Duckling" in pre k and it shows.
---
smh my head didnt even try to bodyblock
---
Oh, indeed I cannot
---
I don't see why it shouldn't, it pretty much guarantees you reach a safe loop which makes it hell for weaker killers and especially stealth killers or killers that rely on exposed such as Myers or plague. Pretty much every other stealth perk requires a trigger and sprint burst doesn't.
---
Don’t you have to pay for that though?
---
Yeah but those 2 meters take just over 3 seconds to gain as a standard 115 movement speed killer, 5 seconds for a 110 movement speed killer. (Assuming not a single obstacle, window or pallet is in the way)
---
That could be enough to reach a new loop or the exit gate. Those seconds matter
---
Oh that's weird, I usually stay rank (at rank 1, killer left and if you depip you become rank 2)
---
Thanks
---
Little did I know I’d get bullied by an SFW squad haha
---
Leatherface. Stupid one-hit ability that he moves stupid fast during, and they. Always. Camp.
---
rancor in C? should be on B or A
---
iron maiden isnt sooooooooooo bad
---
:)
---
I honestly would insta buy if they announced krampus
---
Nope, there's a free one that I'm guessing the challenges work towards. The paid probably enhances it.
---
Now to jump in with the wraith specific if this,
---
Wraith who camps does so invisible. 
---
-no terror radius
---
-no borrowed time
---
-invisible to the eye
---
-can aura read while invisible
---
-MoM disable since tunneling
---
There is 0 chance for survivors when bing bong does this.
---
Wasn't he completely invisible when the game first came out
---
Guns aren't toys or props you dumb little kid.
---
Yeah but Hag and Doctor Splinters were removed from the bloodweb since you can now buy those killers with Shards. 
---
Since Ghostface is licensed, we'll see Ghostface Splinters.
---
I'm thinking it's an obligation to Fun World for the license.
---
hope isnt good :(
---
stake out should be on C
---
i dont like balance landing, idk, should be on D or C :/
---
Just load in with 3 Neas?
---
fully expected a mori there.
---
Need a better mask mate. Also you gotta kill people
---
&gt; If you look at Hilbilly, his chainsaw explodes. 
---
The thought of a Billy going full speed around a corner just to have his Chainsaw blow up on his face gave me a good laugh.
---
That still has nothing to do with the fact that the 5 second stun is ridiculous.
---
True, but it would go along with his lore. Plus they could just add that he has a terror radius when invisible. Survivors won't necessarily know which direction he's coming from, and won't make him overly strong.
---
I HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO FREDDY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HIS "REWORK" IS OVERLY COMPLICATED, AND TAKES AWAY HIS THEME OF BEING A TRACKING, STALL, AND STEALTH KILLER. NOT TO MENTION THAT IT GOES AGAINST A MAJOR PART OF HIS LORE.
---
Hag because it’s just a camp fest. Put 4 traps at the hook, walk 32M to teleport with MYC.  If they take time crouching to unhook they still have enough time to make it back and down you.  I hate camping and tunneling, Hag to me is just a long range face camper.
---
but a lot of time someone goes for that chest early game. If you get a basement hook early game thanks to that, it might actually be the strongest killer perk XD
---
Easy 4k with Pig (nerfed), buff obviously not needed if your good at the pig even with meh perk
---
too much running and jumping, no mindgaming which is why i love dbd, seems less skill based and more "shoot moving ducks" kind of game
---
The true meta healing perk
---
&gt; The devs released some stats recently where survivors have something like a 70-80% survival rate at the moment.
---
I remember seeing those graphs when they came out and I definitely do not recall 70-80% survival rates. Having trouble finding them again, do you have a link to them?
---
Rabbit seems a bit op
---
Yea they totally can’t just work on gens while he camps the hook and tunnels one person.
---
DANCIN’ IN SEPTEMBER!
---
Yeah I'm not running a perk for one potential hook on a moron, thanks.
---
Ghostfacé
---
or the entity is you know an entity and thus gender-less.
---
Hope he ain't gonna get nerfed.
---
But thing is, only TWO games that I've played against NOED have "countered" it. One game was when I was killer(and I ran NOED a lot.) And the other game was against a nurse. Every single game a killer had NOED, it activated, except for those two times. And it was a lot of games. A ton! When NOED works, it is reallllyyyy strong, so you would imagine it would only be fair to be easily counter able, because atm, it's just a shitfest of a perk(I stopped running it a few months ago).
---
I love the Plastic Love reference in the corner aha
---
You weren’t suppose to do that
---
Most likely. But I don't remember the last time I saw ANY shards in my webs...
---
Ruin is one of the most reliable perks too slow down the game, BBQ gives both blood points and good map coverage too find survivors, NOED is the only thing that reliably counters MoM, and I personally never run Nurses lest it’s the huntress, but it’s good for finding the injured survivors when they think they can heal safely.
---
That requires a co ordinated team. Not to many people will opt out of a rescue. Because at this point in the game. After 3 years, we know people want to play a game and not just get ran over by a train and then parked upon by said train. It's legit altruism.
---
Change you play style then.  Be more stealthy early game so you can get some gens and then maybe some altruism until you get out of the low ranks and have more competent teammates.
---
YOU OBVIOUSLY HADNT WHEN YOU WROTE THE COMMENT SO YOURE WELCOME FOR INFORMING YOU
---
Somehow see it more fitting for Sussie. But won't say I don't like it, and somewhat offtopic (or maybe not) I really like your drawing style, so simple, yet it looks clean and cool.
---
BTW, where can I see the rules for the contest and all that?
---
There should be a survivor kinda with the same backstory as the Huntress, kinda like a woodsman kinda vibe
---
You look like a sweat I don’t blame them
---
new geometry dash level music right here fellas
---
Kindred is kinda nice from rank 15 to 20 to signal your teammates to get you,when noone bothers to get you
---
Honestly IMO, if they were gonna nerf it, might as well make it so at full stacks it basically doubles the time to open up the exit gates (20 extra seconds).
---
It has happened a bit for me, I got stuck in the 13-11 range when the killer would DC. Sometimes on accident, other times when we pop the hex totem
---
Cutie
---
I'm rank 16
---
The reason the Devs nerfed it was because of the whole end-game collapse. I believe they nerfed it because they thought it would make it impossible for the last survivor to escape the trial if the hatch was closed. 
---
It was still entirely unjustified as they nerfed it for a very specific situation without really considering that the perk is only really used for situations where more than one survivor is alive.
---
They buffed Left Behind by making the gen repair speed boost higher. Totally worthless as the new hatch mechanic removes the need to repair gens at least 2 gens so it was obvious that they did not put much thought into the perk changes.
---
I got the game 2 days ago
---
Ill come to your party
---
HE, I disagree as the main Pig guy. Yes at your rank it is easy, at rank 1-6 it is not. Pig needs a buuf IMO. 
---
\-Addon rework
---
\-Increase crouch speed
---
\-Rule Set No.2 in her base kit.
---
These are just ideas btw. 
---
Also I am on your side, Pig is a good enough killer, he is just a salty little kid that lost a game. 
---
Pig=upvote.
---
Kindred, Spine Chill will make you bad at chases
---
Ok thanks
---
It is what is.. constructive criticism is alright... gotta do better
---
It's because of this is why Behavior needs to quit with the PTB and hire actual game testers.
---
How would Spine Chill make you bad at chases? Lol
---
He was using perks. Killers aren’t allowed to do that
---
Freddy always has a terror radius, it just can't be heard by awake survivors. So perks that activate within the terror radius (borrowed time, unnerving pressence, and infectious fright) will all still work on awake survivors if they're within the terror radius range, even if they can't hear it. The lullaby range doesn't have any impact on any perks.
---
Note though that Freddy's terror radius is 24m - smaller than normal - and his lullaby is much larger than this I believe. So it's possible for someone to be in the lullaby range, but not the terror radius range.
---
Okay
---
I've seen that happen before. Same map too.
---
They were in a chase with a wraith and had dropped down from the balcony. He got downed shortly after though the killer was still in the building. Killer left him and a teammate came by and healed him however the teammate was healing him inside the building rather than where he actually was outside of it.
---
But not every loop is safe and it gives those two killers a decent counter it would be a massive buff to instadown killers
---
The loud sound that plays when he's nearby you is very good and creepy. However, there shouldn't be any audio alerting you that he is nearby. To keep it in the game, I think a small QoL change would be to make that noise play when you are exposed from his stalk.
---
Can't stand people leaving when the hex pops, but yeah it must be a glitch then, hopefully bhvr knows about it.
---
Do you still get BP’s for a whole lobby that quits?
---
Should give you something as a reward for getting ducked
---
You’re right, I forgot about that rule.
---
Except if you’re playing pig of course, because they all get it off first try
---
I don't like using Stridor on Spirit, because it makes me think survivors are next to me when they aren't. Instead, I just use my ears and their collision box. You might also want to use your power in short bursts when in loops.
---
yes, killers get BP for suvivior DCs.
---
survivors get nothing from survivor or killer DCs.
---
Yea good trappers can make you fear moving, which makes for a super stressful game
---
These are all good, but I think Ears might be too strong on Nurse.
---
It's secure as long as you just wait for someone to be grabbed. If you do anything else, no, it's not safe.
---
tbh the rank I'm at is definitely easier than 1-6, but I am fairly new with only 92 hours and not knowing all the addons and what they do. and I also agree with everything you said. Her crouch speed is just way to slow, reworked addons would be nice even tho i never use addons and rule set no.2 would be nice if it was just in her power/basekit but I feel like if jigsaw boxes were shown only when the bear trap is active would be a bit more balanced.
---
A disconnect does not give you bp for sacrifices, I downed all of them at least twice, with most of the BP coming from stalking, chasing, and hitting
---
I don’t even play Feng but I would totally get her so I can have this cosmetic!!
---
Thanks for this interesting insight!
---
Do you play survivor too? Without heartbeat it must me a real spooky experience :D
---
Is that Enduring + Spirit Fury on Spirit I see?  
---
Also, congrats on a perfect game.
---
Agreed. Will thonk of a solution.
---
Quit the jokes.
---
Don’t worry plenty of people will remind you
---
Probably kindred for the lower ranks, spine chill is really good though, I still use it in red ranks.
---
My top is to use enduring and spirit fury, of course. And, this might sound stupid, but just think about what a survivor is going to do next, and if you can’t do that try and play more survivor. But you’ll get it, I promise! :)
---
I wanted to see a feng wearing a school uniform.
---
Do people not look behind them when they loop?
---
What rank are you?
---
Bro if I don't get BBQ before level 40 I hook myself irl
---
Bunny Feng tho!
---
It doesn't make you bad, just less experienced as it allows you to get away from the killer before a chase starts thus leading to less chases.
---
I’m a rank 1 survivor so it’s like, I know looping spots and where survivors are most likely to go but for some reason when I play Spirit (currently rank 8) I blank and/or the person bamboozles me by going a way I was not expecting at all. 😭 I’ll just keep practicing, thank you!
---
I already gave up on that one :/
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury isn't that good on Spirit, as you deal with pallets and loops by using your power. You should try Sloppy Butcher + Nurses instead; it gives you a lot of free hits and downs on survivors.
---
It gives about 650 bp per disconnect
---
Survival instincts seems like a lesser bond and run rabbit run is op, but I love the concepts and art
---
I really need that cat bag
---
The thing is that the whole detection system is broken and sometimes he just can’t be spotted it’s even more fucked up with the addons
---
do you mean that there's to much red and cant really tell what it is because of it? or you don't know that its a dataminded cosmetic that's for the pig?
---
Because to get good at chases you have to GET into chases. A new player is going to be pretty immersed, if you add Spine Chill or Premonition he's going to go full immersed, and when the Killer comes he wont know what to do.
---
Without Spine Chill or Premonition you will get into a lot of chases and practice them.
---
Or, maybe have it play and work like Wraiths bing bong?
---
When u trying to escape a crazed murderer at 7 but have a meeting with your friends at the nearest starbucks at 8
---
I’m running BBQ + Ruin + Sloppy + Make Your Choice right now. Maybe I’ll swap out MYC for nurses and give it a shot.
---
Both
---
To an extent yes but it’s a fantastic perk that I highly recommend for new players.  Playing immersed is often part of the beginner playbook and Spine Chill is good at helping with that.  Sure you get less chase experience off the bat but being able to survive longer will keep newer survivors more interested and hopefully encourage them to try different things as they learn more.  It’s a great perk for any player though as it’s excellent in counter stealth killers and/or spirit w moth her phasing.
---
Ah well rip. Maybe that will be the most cited cosmetic then they’ll have to add it in lol
---
They'll probably fix him before the DLC goes live; almost no one will buy his DLC, not even mentioning playing it.
---
Yeah but why be rational when you can jump the gun, assume the worst, and then get uppity as hell.
---
Also Myers lol
---
Shelter woods desperately cries for a rework. As a killer I feel bad because there is literally nothing for the survivors to do except get killed one by one and as a survivor I feel forced into stealth gameplay because I dont want to waste one of the 5 pallets on the map...
---
YEAH I DID, SO I DIDN'T NEED TO SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING THAT I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.
---
“Thats ugly” isn’t really constructive, maybe instead try giving examples of why it doesn’t look good, for example “the hat could be removed or changed up a little”
---
Any idea why they quit? My guess is that one got caught early, quit, then the others immediately followed suit.
---
Behind the sign doin a fat dab
---
Honestly I want the professor or Dwight the wheelchair guy as the new survivor.  The quotables are endless.   “Maybe you should kiss each other goodnight Uhyuhhhh” .  Dwight’s perk can be “I can do it myself”.
---
Who is they?
---
I'm sure they can fix him and make him a good stealth killer. Making it so our characters have to look at him like a dev mentioned, and also removing basically every sound he makes would make him a lot better. So basically get rid of the map-wide noise he makes when activating his power, get rid of the noise when he's stalking someone and get rid of the noise he makes when in his power.
---
Literally says his name at the bottom chill anyone with half a brain cell can figure out its from farmer john
---
so you're a stealth survivor? yikes
---
That would be cool. On the other side colorblind people try to convince the devs for 3 years to implement colorblind support - sadly still unsuccessful.
---
Same with me as trapper, got all 4 survivors in the basement last night!
---
He’s not a big youtuber so some people might not know him but still they should’ve put his name in the title
---
Thrill of the Hunt and Devour Hope is an amazing combo. Add BBQ &amp; Chilli for a nice lil bonus to your efficiency and try out Infectious Fright if you wanna go buck wild. Also, don't use Prayer Beads, Prayer Beads are for sinners.
---
The only thing I can think of was that I burnt an offering that sent us to the hospital
---
Instaheal + white ward loool
---
I like everything except the scratch marks disappearing in the last one. Matched with the speed boost length would make it REALLY easy to escape a killer.
---
Wispers is not nearly strong
---
Wow😂😂😂. And they quit over that?
---
Use your ears, just listen to the sound of survivors, it's rare the survivor that brings Iron Will, and still it's not that difficult to track survivors even while phasing
---
Didn't really see it as constructive.
---
Leatherface/Cannibal for sure and only because it’s so easy for him to knock down an unhooked survivor and the unhooker at the same time. The only killer with a free no counter power that just gives him too easy kills.

Flight of the rabbit would be way too strong. Throw on an exhaustion penalty even if it's like only 20 seconds instead of the usual 40.
---
I like unbowed which could make injured builds less risky, and survival instincts could be good for stealth builds.
---
have you tried lowering the music and raising the voice sounds? The voices are there, even when using max volume on all sound settings, you might just not notice due to the stress of playing killer, take it easy, learn first, screw it over a bit, practice, you'll get good eventually
---
Why do you think so, despite the fact that it's never happened before? Spirit and Legion were both unbalanced on PTB, released unbalanced and had to be fixed in a later patch. Ghostface probably won't release in the *exact same* state he's in now, but it would be unprecedented if he were actually in a good place on release after being in such a bad state on PTB.
---
*Didn't you hear? Disliking or having different opinions is a crime against humanity*
---
When is he going to be released?
---
Calm your buttery asshole.

Only 4 gens in 5 minutes?
---
Literally fuck off mettle of man makes 80% of killers in this game useless. I fucking dare you to play wraith or another m1 killer and not want to fucking die from this perk.
---
This is by far the best post I've seen on this sub I wish I had silver gold etc you get my approval which isn't much but you're the one baby. It's you
---
“LIFE HAS MANY DOORS FRED BOY!”
---
Yes, the point of the PTB is release and test content before it is released.   But if content launches so severely underpowered and bugged to the point that is proves nigh-impossible to *actually* test it?  Then we have a bit of a problem on our hands, wouldn't you say?   I mean, Christ above, a bulk of these are oversites and bugs that could be found with the preliminary in-house QA.
---
We should care because?
---
OMG YESSS I'D LOVE THAT
---
how would this help the killer??
---
Just a way to get more points like the Plague does when activating her power and infecting stuff.
---
Because it makes saves incredibly safe no matter what the circumstances. BT is already really good.
---
It definitely does, good nurses on PC is ... something to experience, but only once, because you never want to face it again.
---
Current BT is the best one because it has multiple uses. Old but could be used just once and you didn't have full control of when it would happen. 
---
If both survivors know how to play, Borrowed Time saves aren't necessarily just to trade places. Although, it requires a little skill and game knowledge, which is something people aren't usually willing to try to learn so they just ask for buffs / nerfs. 
---
If I am the person hooked and a teammate frees me with Borrowed Time, instead of running for my life immediately, I take a protection hit for my teammate so we both go free. The killer can't down me immediately because of Endurance so the smarter play is to always take a hit. 
---
If I am the person unhooking, I try to use the updated unhook animation to bait the killer into hitting the hooked person (which is brilliant but survivors always forget to mention it when they complain about BHVR being killer sided). If not, I unhook anyway and pray that my teammate knows how to play in order to make the play mentioned before.
---
Great more aura reading, just what this game needs. How about they give ghostface a power that helps in the chase and dosen’t appeal to noobs who don’t know how to look around
---
Let me know if you want it. Happy cake day!
---
There's a lot of things I want as options that each individual can turn off or on for themselves. Post game chat for consoles, in game voice chat, percentages, totem count. Itd be great to have, especially as an optional thing that you can choose to opt out or in of
---
I mean with gf yea its overdone b u t its the ptb aka the time to complain and “whine” so he gets fixed before ppl spend actual money for a low tier killer. Also ppl have every right to complain abt broken things that make the game unfun until there changed bc if u dont “complain” abt broken stuff its never gonna be fixed. Also x2 80% of the ghostface complaints i see on here are memes or ppl making light of a situation if u dont like seeing these t h a t bad then wait out the ghostface “drama” and comeback when hes just another killer in the game.
---
They are not incredibly safe, not even close if the killer is even remotely close to camping/proxy camping. He will still either tunnel they survivor who got unhooked or down the person doing the unhooking. Especially the 1 hit killers
---
There's a hatch in the game?
---
A lot of survivors are scared to jump out when they should and because of that they jump out too late.
---
With the risk of certain perks that punish ‘hook tunneling’, even when I’m feeling like an asshole I’ll tend to go for the farmer. One hit just before the hook, and a second afterwards
---
The guy gets safe unhook points, sure, but next time he gets unhooked I’m tunneling his ass to see how it feels
---
They previously said that he was still being tweaked, so nothing is really definitive.
---
Listen, if someone is solely targeting ME and only ME and admitted doing so as well as Tunneling AND camping to the point where I don't even have a chance to play or get 20 meters from the hook I just got unhooked from, THAT is ruining MY game experience. I don't queue to get to depipped and get 0 BP. I queue to have fun by doing ALL THINGS POSSIBLE in one match. Yes I get dying is part of the game, but I don't get into a match and end up wanting to die instantly cause a killer wants to solo me out from everyone else because I escaped last game. THAT is what I am getting at. It would be totally different if the killer hadn't trolled me in the messages, only then would your comment make sense. But once u get a killer who targets u and oy u for some dumb reason then trolls u in end game chat or in ur PM's then u will understand what this post is about.
---
You can just earn her with shards if your patient
---
I’m not disagreeing with anyone that the borrowed time now is great, but what I’m saying is they made mom literally a protection only perk to stop tunneling and camping, why not do the same with borrowed time? Decrease the amount of games where killers get free kills for doing literally nothing, since killers said survivors did nothing and earned the free mettle of man hit, why not make them work for it to?
---
Dude It looks so cool great job!
---
The T bagging thing was a joke btw
---
What did you do to him?
---
This is the lowest quality picture I've ever seen on reddit I think.
---
u/v_redditbot
---
Unfortunately he is not elegible for the contest.
---
But otherwise it would b a good skin.
---
yup
---
I took it from my phone because I can’t screenshot on my pc
---
WTF. MoM in the PTB was already worthless.
---
You lose out on getting more, and getting no points overall. You get little hunting, brutality, deviousness.
---
Woah. You're saying that a killer that can move anywhere from 230-310.5% of the maximum speed of a survivor that is exhausted is a fluke? That a survivor can actually do something differently about how fast they move?
---
I'm a P3 Leatherface main and I would be PISSED if they changed his chainsaw. In its current iteration it event has some great advantages over Billy, notably that it can be canceled at any point during its charge-up rather than having to wait for it to wind-down.
---
and this, this is why I run iron maiden
---
It means "remember that you will die".
---
Sorry guys, this post was made by my brother who's very new to the game. This won't happen again
---
I didnt watch the shitty video soo your point is?
---
Good work on the art aspect, I don't hate Flight of the Rabbit. I don't really see the other two being viable after like level 15 though. Realistically, when you create perks, you should be looking at perks that compete with current metagame perks and would have longstanding and viable game play.

It's roman a language? I tought they speak latin.
---
Serious question.
---
Legion wasnt the even that bad nether was plague, they are  both at least low mid tier to mid tier. Spirt was the only big one that got way better
---
Thanks, I couldn't answer cause I was in a match as the nurse and one escaped by the hatch. I got a question, what do I have to do to find it because Everytime I'm the last person and I'm just running around because I know I cant do the last gens I never find the hatch.
---
This is not his original look either, it is the Zombie Ghostface costume-
---
The original father death costume is not sold, unless custom made and they are quite expensive.
---
When someone says legion is the best killer
---
Legion- *IM THE BEST EVER I GOT A KILL IN FORTNITE AFTER PLAYING 100 GAMES YESSSSS!!!!!*
---
Everyone- *they were being sarcastic*
---
Legion- *can you stop a survivor pallet spamming by vaulting it?*
---
Nurse- *can you go through walls and pallets?*
---
Myers- *........................................................................................................................…………....…...……………….…*
---
Doctor- *can you play mind games with pallets?*
---
Legion- *hey I fit an aggressive play style*
---
Hillbilly, letherface, huntress, nurse, *we all do too and are better then you at it as well!*
---
The entity- *I will give you a buff legion*
---
Legion- * no remember you had to nurf me first because I was too op?*
---
Entity- *o yeah sorry bud*
---
Legion- I’m to used to it that’s why I killed in the first place
---
Hillbilly- * for once I agree with legion*
---
Entity- * well forget that, when you go into that trial you serve me and sacrifice to me and I will make you unstoppable*
---
All killers *why do we have moris then*
---
Entity * I don’t really know
---
That’s the pathetic part it was t a joke. He/she does not speak English as a primary language, typed that they upvoted the OP and post. Just worded it differently.
---
When you hear a noise like the woooo of this video , the hatch is near https://youtu.be/I37VtbLTTNI
---
The Spirit and Michael Myers are the two most fun and yet fair killers in the game IMO.
---
Alright thanks
---
Maybe get better at the game and don't rely on perks to get you out of hard situations?
---
What do you guys mean by God Pallet?
---
Obviously Dwight was checking to see if you were worthy of escaping the trial.
---
Really need a black leather dress for her tbh!!!
---
Don’t save while they are camping? So let them face camp someone and take the game away from that person? That’s your solution?
---
Trust me I know how to do a decent amount of coding and a problem like this shouldn’t take an entire MONTH to fix. Especially if you have a team of coders dedicated to fixing bugs (which they do)
---
I want flight of the rabbit so bad
---
Idk just thought it was interesting
---
Your abbreviations and then spaced out occasional lettering for random words confuses me. You're an anomaly. I think I l i K e it. Bt nt s u r e.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but the reason they did so just does not matter to me. Their in-game actions were justifiable and within the confines of proper play, they did not qualify as harassment. That they tunneled you specifically because you escaped last game (dumb reason in my opinion) has no impact on how their play patterns impacted your game experience. Whether you had a bad time because you got tunneled normally or you had a bad time because you got singled out for other reasons, this does not qualify as griefing.
---
Without context, without post-game chat (which you can hide, by the way), it was just another game where you got tunneled. Maybe some people tunnel you because they don't like your choice of cosmetics or your Steam name and they just don't say anything about it. Doesn't matter. They are still only using core game mechanics to target you. It's only griefing if they harass you out of game OR if they're on your team and intentionally ruining your experience.
---
**AHEM** Lisa Simpson sir/madam

Oh okay! I was just reading a few of the comments and people seemed salty as heck so I assumed that was the post sentiment lol
---
Edit I thought about this and we already have tons of characters who wear masks
---
so did i wtf
---
Now tell me, would perks be in the game if they weren't meant to be used to your advantage? Maybe get better at having a decent conversation..
---
With the way things are, using DS or MoM would only make my Quentin even more of a target, and I'm already targeted enough in games for either looping or playing the game. An exhaustion perk maybe (I need to work on more bloodwebs lol), but it's been pleasant playing against Doctor and not getting any grief. 
---
I know Wake Up seems fairly pointless but I just like to get me and others out quick.
---
That would be nice. Obviously they couldn’t use the adidas logo but a rugby (or any sport) skin would be pretty cool.
---
&gt; And sorry not everyone is as great as you are
---
This is not about being bad or great. Its about understanding the game mechanics and using them to your advantage rather than asking for buffs or nerfs that will take away all the effort you would need in order to outplay your adversary.
---
There are a decent number of pallets on Shelter Woods, just look to the odd tree formations on the ring of the map.
---
Lol.   My favorite was when pig came out and them trying to make a fading heartbeat and it made the heartbeat for everyone just insane! 
---
I remember facing a Michael and I was playing SWF,  my buddy is like “he is on me” or whatever, all of a sudden I have a heartbeat like he is up my ass.  
---
Game was legit scary until they fixed that.

I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE

I‘D MAIN HER IN A HEARTBEAT

Wait so you’re saying don’t use any perks then? Isn’t the point of perks to use them? You were having a decent conversation now you’re just being ignorant

&gt;the camera shake is disorienting enough as it is, followed up as it so often is by a flashlight blind. The red flash is just unnecessary visual clutter. 
---
Care to explain how it was an issue? I barely noticed anything, but I thought it was a super cool addition.
---
It's ok, the post has blown up and my original comment that went with the post has floated away into the thread. I just told people I ended up laughing because of it and the guy had made a record of bullying me, but I wasn't actually mad about it. I already believed I was dead before hatch was found so I only struggled to open the gate and the rest is history. :D
---
I think a lot are upset on my behalf though, which is a whole other thing entirely.
---
What was even the point of messaging him though
---
You can also body block pallets and windows
---
I've only heard lettuce hag but I mean prolly lol
---
God damn that felt good to watch. If you slow it down you can see the hope *literally* drain from their soul. 
---
Thank you.
---
We don’t know they have not told us
---
Offering that lets you play a killer that you don't own. I believe you can only get them for licensed killers.
---
I think 1 sec is too much on that last one, but these are considerably useful
---
So these are based towards a hunter or some outdoors-man
---
Tbh he fact he won is your fault, if you knew he face camped should have done gens and make sure he displeases the entity
