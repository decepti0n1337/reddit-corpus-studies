AHHHH!!! GET AWAY AHHHHHHH!!!

---
---
Yeah I've been on the receiving end of Blood Warden haha scary the first time it happened.
---
That's sorta the cool thing about the two perks I mentioned is that it can make the game feel tense again. I know everytime I see Blood Warden pop up I'm in for some trouble.
---
Sole Survivor is definitely not balanced. I really like the NOLB change. I still wouldn‚Äôt use it, but some people would. At least it wouldn‚Äôt be useless anymore.
---
Thanks for just adding to the problem. It-s much easier to just brand someone as evil.Survivors are the devil right? Nevermind fixing the bullshit survivors have to endure. And yes, I do realise this is reddit and this post will be downvoted to shit by baby killers... you're just proving my point cheaters. LOOSE THE TRAINING WHEELS
---
still a 5 second stun and if the killer immediately downs and picks you up, the 20 second difference between tier 1 and 3 won't matter.
---
I love this
---
yeah i've noticed he scratches the locker and sparks appear before he grabs them
---
i saw the red sress cosmetic, felt like i was about to be molested by a 600+ granny
---
Imagine being this upset over DC jokes
---
Billy
---
Slippery meat would 100% need a cooldown and lower count. With the amount of pallets on any given map that would be insanely OP especially combined with a flashlight. This would make any other scratch mark perk obsolete.
---

---
I also think 20% is too much for sole survivor. Gens already go at a crazy fast rate.
---
Those perk icons go along with ascending?
---
NO. No more exhaustion recovery while running.
---
Issa joke post
---
Doesn't mater witch killer you're plauing you can just camp your way to victory. Don't forget your ruin, sloppy and noed. Right fellow redditors???? Keep wondering why people dc on you.
---
If you didnt get the joke clap your hands
---
*entire comments section claps*
---
skillcheck nightmare has no weakness
---
A Nurse's Calling is very good, yes, and if you don't intend on leveling Nurse up anytime soon, I'd say go for it.
---
Other than that, is kinda depends who you're playing as to what Perks you should be eyeing. Barbecue &amp; Chili, Hex: Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Bamboozle are all also pretty good for just about any Killer. I really like running Surveillance and Hex Perks on high mobility Killers. Aside from the "meta" Perks, it just depends on who you're playing and your particular playstyle!
---
Yeah noticed after I posted and read the rest of it lol. Just too lazy to correct myself. They should have dc lose you 4-8 pips. Have an honor system like most games. With the reset. If you dc 1-3 times it‚Äôs 2 pips. 4-6 times 4 pips. 6-9 it‚Äôs 10. And if you dc 10 times. You get rank 21. Where you will only play with other rank 21s or if no game is found within 10 minutes, puts you against normal ranks.
---
karma always strikes back
---
Yeah, forgot about the cooldown. Probably would change it to be more dance with me where you have a static duration but with a cooldown of 40/30/20 seconds
---
The only thing I dislike is when a MoM player has an instaheal and tbags. Its also worse when they all come to body block you so you have a terrible time getting to the hook
---
I somehow doubt that the skill gap between east asia and na is anything insanely noticeable. Dbd isn‚Äôt league of legends, but what do I know. Maybe everyone in east asia is just somehow superior at holding shift and running around a pallet and holding the w key and pressing m1.
---
Also to your point about everyone playing nurse and billy, the changes had nothing to do with that. Nurse and Billy are arguably two of the best killers and their popularity shouldn‚Äôt be surprising because it‚Äôs been that way for awhile.
---
We‚Äôre all playing the same game. DS changes and the inclusion of MoM effects everyone playing, if the devs find it necessary to fix it they will. If not, then they won‚Äôt. Maybe just, I don‚Äôt know, use hex ruin and don‚Äôt tunnel if DS is making you lose lol.
---
It's not about the joke. It's about the way the whole thing is seen
---
I meant to put it in D but I did it on mobile so they are a lot if mistakes
---
Super wholesome, take care OP
---
use frenzy on as many survivors as possible, then follow the last one you hit and down them
---
Yes exactly even with the longer cooldown with all the perks survivors have to prolong chases, like MoM, they can just loop forever until they run out of exhaustion and sprint burst away.
---
But when she blinks her hand looks like its burning. So I don't it will work
---
Correct, but it doesn't hurt to try and not be HEY THERE'S SOME MEAT IN MY PERIPHERALS.
---
He needs some milk...
---
yeah but hardly anyone goes doctor and 8 don't like perks that are only useful against one killer
---
Is because the devs are so lenient with DC‚Äôs. When and if harsher punishments come for DC‚Äôing then it‚Äôll happen a lot less. There‚Äôs also actual DC‚Äôs where someone lags out, and you‚Äôll know when that happens when the survivor DC‚Äôs but there‚Äôs no DC sound.
---
play killer more. having fun should be the most important part of playing a game. just enjoy yourself and you'll get better over time.
---
I see any Claudette on my team and I always internally scream. I know it's either they're gonna fuck me over somehow or be immersed as all hell with their self care and urban evasion üòÇ (in most cases both)
---
It's not as good as it sounds because the terror radius fades out over like 6 seconds after the initial 2 seconds of standing still, meaning it's actually pretty time consuming.
---
I don‚Äôt think it was op. Just made survivors have to be careful walking by crows.
---
Urban and calm spirit makes it useless I was fine with it being 48
---
[removed]
---
I mean you adjust the other shards so that you still pip up without the team shard. Fix it so that you get points while not being seen (as opposed to the current bullshit of terror radius) and adjust the gatekeeper perk so that if one person does two gens by themself they get it.
---
Like I hate to be that person but if it‚Äôs an immerse Claudette and they tea bag. You‚Äôre getting face camped. I want you to hate playing with me lol. I can get 4K nearly every game. But I‚Äôll take 1k if it means you are straight up not having a good time.
---
Fair, fair.
---
I like your technician changes
---
Kill him first. Problem solved.
---
You must be fun at parties. Oh wait..you probably were never invited to one. I really wonder why.
---
Wow, what a unique idea for changing Vigil that has definitely not been suggest a million times before.
---
Exhaustion was changed because it was broken and abusive to be able to use multiple sprints in a chase. When it gets to that point the killer is already struggling hard, and doesn't need an extra kick in the balls or chase extender.
---
Get over a nerf that happened a year ago.
---
Yep. And getting to flex on survivors for the rest of the match. I love when I use my power and dont see my left arm and know what's going on
---
no still didn't = (
---
lmao i know the arms are suppose to be muscles but they look like chubby, baby arms. its adorable
---
Thanks to you, I beat Freddy for the first time! Thank you so much for this guide. Worth a follow
---
Thank you!
---
No, killers just want the points they are getting robbed of.
---
A "Stylish Death" Mori BP bonus would be cool. Doesn't have to be alot but just something of a consolation prize for survivor's who get Mori'd after first hook and thus taken out of the game early.
---
ok... I'm talking about EGC itself, not finding the hatch. Thanks for telling me they're obviously linked somehow.
---
Listed on their Instagram to stay posted for more information coming soon. Goodsmile Compamy often uses that generic description when items are soon slated for preorder. We will more than likely see preorders open up within the next 2 or so weeks.
---
Same. For awhile I was always thinking I was catching a glimpse of a crouching survivor that was just on the edge of my peripheral vision lol.
---
Before people get angsty about the tbag I did here's some context
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Context-
---
This bubba was camping nearly every hook. I wanted to get his attention to chase me. But unfortunately, he wanted none of it. I looped him a bit at the Killer Shack and at a t wall, but unfortunately, he must've had enough of this group of survivors and blatantly lag switched. From my perspective he was nowhere near me, nor was I lagging at the time frame.
---
Normally I don't participate in tbagging as I think it's petty, but sometimes I just do it in order to get a killer to chase me if they are staying near the hook.
---
Spies from the Shadows could been even map wide and still wouldn't been OP.
---
Because I‚Äôd rather buy cells and chapters and no more than that
---
Do you mind game a lot Bc the way most people play freddy is that they just play him like a trapper.
---
The lawsuit was recently appealed, it might drag on for another year.
---
JoJo‚Äôs buzzard adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. A must watch imo
---
I more meant it as you benefit from other players aura reading abilities but couldn't find the right wording
---
You can see the weapon, and for the rest idk, I guess to see it on the menu, beginning of a game and the end of a game
---
Oh my god! This is amazing! üëè Good job!
---
Learning spirit my dude, not having a great night, actually my second game against that swf, yeah i left cause ruin gone instantly
---
If it seems like they're deliberately dragging it out you should check the basement. A lot of times survivors will go in the out of lockers down there.
---
David has to be the loudest, hearing him get in a locker, his groan is like the t Rex roar
---
I think the devs have mentioned it once or twice but aren‚Äôt looking to take action anytime in the near future
---
I could be wrong but I‚Äôve read the husk only has an 8m terror radius. So after you enter spirit world the TR will reduce to 8m and this can‚Äôt be changed with perks.
---
Yeah i did dc after ruin was destroyed in the first 3 seconds, I‚Äôm learning spirit and really wasn‚Äôt having a good night
---
Well I hope to someday see you in my stream:) 
---
Twitch.tv/spooksgame_
---
Oh my god. I give up. I will not bother explaining to you what the meaning of kindness means to you, and you probably won't understand it either. It feels like I am debating with an AI.
---
I feel like I'm the only survivor who likes playing against a good billy
---
.....ugh
---
Like I said a lot of the times we dont have the time to do that
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt having a good night at all. I‚Äôm learning spirit and just want games that are somewhat fair.
---
Also trappers mask is in Payday 2
---
People usually get really triggered if you ask for tips on running really strong add ons like iridescent head and prayer beads. DC fests y'know
---
Keeping expectations low for now.
---
No one notices how it's just a late chinese new year cosmetic? Shit looks almost exactly like mins and huntresses event cosmetics.
---
People are worried it'll be pay to win
---
oh boo hoo they‚Äôll deal with prayer beads , if they dont like it they can choke with their MoM üòå
---
Bro I do the same. If you need a killer to chase you to save someone. You bag that tea all day.
---
I like that idea
---
This is my list:
---
1)Nurse
---
2/3)spirit/billy
---
4)Huntress
---
5)Hag
---
6)Myers
---
7)Plague
---
8)Clown
---
9)Pig
---
10)Wraith
---
11)Trapper
---
12)Leatherface
---
13)Doctor
---
14)Legion
---
15)freddy ( D A R N )
---
I haven't had that much trouble getting out due to the hatch being kicked closed. I feel like it's a good idea but only if there is one survivor left. But the problem can arise for people camping the gate and waiting for the endgame to open it so they can escape.
---
Regardless they'd be cool cosmetics
---
why
---
Genuinely never knew that. Thought it only picked up video from when you press the record button.
---
Mmm, I like it
---
thanks bb
---
so when's our marriage bb
---
Kindness the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.
---
So you are telling me that because you suck at the game.. the killer must be those things to you? get the fuck out of here lol
---
You are simply using it like it means something it doesn't. You can claim I am missing kindness or not.. but you are just being willingly ignorant. Get better at the game little kid, and maybe you won't be crying on the internet how people are assholes who have no kindness are detached from reality.. because they don't want to be some sissy killer who lets you live for free.. because if he's not hes not kind.. the fuck? 
---
The world is harsh grow up, the game is meant for you to survive.. not for the killer to let you live because of certain outcomes.
---
Oh wait I forgot I live in a society where the children of today think that they are owed something.. and deserve everything handed to them without putting in work.. and learning that you will fail and lose every time.. go run to your safe space if it bothers you so much that.. I will not give a free escape.. just because you and your team suck.
---
it's competition against the killer for your life you either live cause you are good or you die cause you suck. There is no special treatment, that's just something expect of a sissy because they suck at the game and need someone to hold their hand.
---
Waaaaaaaaaah
---
;) next week
---
It's effective on all killers. On Billy it's a little weird tho

"My friend"
---
can't wait, we'll kill survivors with ebony moris and prayer beads. it'll be fun ;)
---
Prayer Beads is a fairly gross addon. But the Mother Daughter ring, or the Yakuyoke Amulet. If you don't have either of those another addon that increases move speed while in phasing.
---
If you are looking for perks, running Surveillance, Discordance, Tinkerer or other perks that let you know when survivors are on a gen is good for grabs.
---
I see Trapper in the same light as Heavy, in the sense that they're both the faces of their respective games, are instantly recognizable and are in a lot of memes, but no one actually really plays them
---
You could throw hag in the mix maybe wraith too
---
the ‚Äúprayer ‚Äú beads will b fun ;)
---
Hag is a ton of fun imo
---
How is legion considered low tier? He has pretty nice global map pressure. I‚Äôve been playing him pretty actively. I would see him like b or c tier
---
*Darth Huntress*
---
Yeah, it‚Äôd have to meet the condition of having the hatch is closed, which means that there is one survivor. Otherwise a door would already be open anyway for all the other survivors to escape and leave the one.
---
oh for sure hehe ;D
---
How dare you speak the truth of me!
---
I‚Äôve got to disagree. I find escapes that much more rewarding knowing that they‚Äôre hard once the hatch is closed. Also you loop during the game, you‚Äôre suggesting taking out the hiding and mindgame aspects of the endgame and replacing it with... more looping. Yeah no thanks.
---
i use prayer beads when i get mad for being hit with 2 MoMs and some d-strikes when i dont even TUNNEL. but thanks for the help i use surveillance usually
---
xing ling
---
Agreed 100%. The front page is so congested with low effort karma grabs it's insane (it was *80% shitposts* last I used it in an argument about why /r/minecraft is correct to ban memes). I don't even mind jokes or shitposts or whatever, but the vast majority of them are "when the thing everyone experiences in dbd happens" over an image macro.
---
Absolutely yes. I think he‚Äôs fun to play and the most fun to play against. He struggles early and has counterplay, but he gets stronger as games go on. He has many different playstyles depending on which add ons you‚Äôre using, some are really strong. 
---
Save the best for last is one of my favourite perks, I‚Äôd almost recommend getting him just for that.
---
Who the fuck is Claudet? Think you posted this in the wrong subreddit
---
its good
---
ps4, holy fuck i watch space coconut too. this is really coincidental but spicy and interesting at the same time
---
&gt; No One Left Behind:
---
&gt; It is inconceivable to leave someone behind. Upon unhooking a survivor, you and the survivor sprint at 150% movement speed and leave no scratch marks for 5 seconds.
---
&gt; **Causes the exhausted status effect for 40/30/20 seconds**
---
&gt; (the reason I have the exhausted effect last for a shorter time is because unlike other exhaustion perks, No One Left Behind does not help you in a chase)
---
This would be pretty broken for the Bold part, and it would also be annoying as hell to be grabbed off the hook, run into the Killer, and not be able to use your own perk because someone else gave you exhaustion.
---
The reason Exhaustion perks are balanced is because it puts you on such a long cooldown between uses and you want to use them in a chase. Having one that has a lower cooldown would completely mess with the balancing of all of them.
---
Using this, you would unhook another survivor, you'd both run off and be harder to track by the killer. By the time you got done healing the guy you just pulled off the hook you'd already have Balanced Landing or Lithe up and ready to be used, rendering the "drawback" moot.
---
I feel like if you made it where you had to be in the Killer's Terror Radius, it'd be one thing, but grabbing the guy off and just disappearing without a trace is too much for one perk (You need Dance with Me and Lithe together to do the same thing every 40 seconds).
---
This would actually help me a lot. Half the time when they DC on my shoulder, I don't even notice and get really confused. If I drop and then this happens, I'd know.
---
Okay, true i worded that wrong AF...
---
Any memeing in general doesnt work and they just d/c
---
Literally just had a swf try and be toxic when i was killer and they d/ced, so that thought was on my mind, my bad
---
It's more so they're bad and can't kill survivors at higher ranks so they stay low ranked otherwise they'd kill no one, ever.
---
idk how we arent married yet to be Honest. add my psn ; @abhorrentaiden
---
im not at home at the moment but ill add u back and hey we can play sometime :-) im glad we met lmaoo
---
They need to remove totems in open area spawns and make them more hidden and add more spawn spots.
---
Because PC gamers have to justify their purchase by bashing everything else.
---
As if that isn't his default skin.
---
this hit tbh this is facts
---
Asian fetish
---
\*non gaming pc sounds\*
---
LMAO
---
My only gripe with console mains is how they seem to adore recording their televisions vertically with their shitty iphones
---
I downvoted this tbh
---
As long as it takes a full minute+ I‚Äôm fine with this.
---
Honestly, if they‚Äôre wasting so much time being scared and holding the game hostage I‚Äôll sit in a random corner and hope for the best. 5 minutes pass, I‚Äôll DC. It‚Äôs not fair even a little bit. 
---
I have a Claudette do the same thing to me. I could not find her anywhere. No gens got touched. Nothing.  I had a vendetta out for her because they let a first hook meg die and luckily this adam and deliverance.  They messaged me ‚Äúfaca you‚Äù repeatedly in game.    Finally I phased to every locker and eventually caught her with a quick two tap. Hit them repeatedly on hook while I allowed the adam teabag her.  An HOUR GAME
---
**being broke noises**
---
&gt;mfw the obsession is teabagging at exit gate but they didn't notice Rancor
---
LMAO ps4 has a record feature they rlly dont have to do the most w that

Here's where you belong. You're welcome.

*15 fps crying*

alright, ill add you but atm i don't have ps plus :(, ill get it soon though and we can play then. im also glad we met :)
---
cries in *not being able to 360 well*
---
*cries in  not being able to moonwalk at all*
---
Is it you personally that‚Äôs randomly disconnecting ?
---
alrightyy thats fine we can talk until u get itt
---
wonder how much he brought Quentin in there
---
Me, but I never stream lol. But i usually sit red ranks as a spirit main. She‚Äôs super fun
---
I would say it takes almost the entire duration of the timer, leaving little room for the survivor to get out. 
---
If it‚Äôs like 2 minutes until murder time, maybe leave 10 seconds for them to actually get out? That way it can‚Äôt be a full map loop or anything too mad like that.
---
The fact that this is flaired as a shitpost speaks volumes about a PC nurse vs. console survivors scenario.
---
People always say Trapper is basically Jason and I mean... sure from a visual standpoint but in terms of gameplay? I wouldn't see Jason using bear traps.
---
ü§£üòÇ
---
True
---
haha, well, misspelling a simple name that you see all the time is pretty sad
---
I think seeing some killers as survivors would be interesting seeing as the entity can pull characters from different dimensions
---
You did great!!
---
If this is yours...
---
This was apparently fixed according to the patch notes, obviously not, it happened to me as well.
---
I can‚Äôt take credit - my boyfriend baked me this for my 30th :)
---
You realize they haven't done a single teaser yet shit was leaked they still have to put him on the PTB
---
Gg
---
Im sorry if you see mine as negative, I am hyped however I do keep my expectations low so that if something great pops up I'll enjoy it even more than the mindset of: We're going to get so many awesome things!
---
I don't think it's working, at least on PS4, just a few hours ago I spawned literally a few steps from Ruin.
---
Why.... why are you back at this thread you already commented
---
Because they disconnect? I still don‚Äôt get it.
---
I'm crying oh my god üòÇ that's a great perk
---
sounds like someone was camping.
---
The killer mains had a hell of a time dealing with annoying hatch stand offs, so us survivors are kinda getting our version of that. 
---
It definitely sucks but I get it lmao. I just want to find something that‚Äôll make both sides happy without favoring one more than the other. Hatch stand off favored survivors, end game favors killers. 
---
Life sucks and then we all get shanked in the cheeks by the entity.
---
It's kinda weird how everyone on here promotes stuff "their friend" makes. ü§î
---
Honestly, nothing you can do against a face camping insidious bubba. Unless one gen is left, someone has borrowed time and manages to pull it off, everyone escapes cus of multiple DS. 
---
But as far as tunneling, I guarantee you not every game is quite like that. Make sure you‚Äôre not teabagging or flashlight clicking.  But to survive, look behind you, don‚Äôt drop every pallet, etc. keep practicing.  Depending your rank, I see why you get multiple campers/tunnelers.  I enjoy staying in purple ranks because I feel it‚Äôs the most fair.
---
or just play hillbilly n go zoom zoom 
---
im willing to bet his kill rate jumped a lot since endgame collapse came out
---
I didn't read the guidelines where you're not allowed to visit a thread multiple times but: I went to look back after I got a reply here.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve already prestige‚Äôs her and have never gotten it. üò¨
---
I think huntress does a kind of wash when pallet stunned
---
non-accurate list lol downvoted /s
---
O shit I lost interest in the convo
---
Yea sometimes it do be like that. It feels good to run really strong addons and perks, even a mori after a bad game.
---
Yes
---
Right. Expect messages if you‚Äôre camping and think they‚Äôre low because they ‚Äúlost‚Äù no shit I lost I didn‚Äôt stand a chance lol.
---
O shit good day to you.

you got what you deserved for the teabag. Instant karma is instant

Top 10 saddest anime deaths
---
London isn't too far from me aswell so would have loved to go to the event but..no friends that have the same interests lol
---
Nendoroids actually cost around $50 in the US. Even the most expensive one I bought was only $100 and it was basically 4 figures. That said I import Nendoroids myself so I usually end up paying no more than $40 for them.
---
Well I‚Äôm a Freddy main and I‚Äôm asking for the rework, so...
---
Omg yes please
---
Seems to be that way pal.
---
So...Ghostface can do everything Micheal Myers can do and even more? (Shock, invisible)
---
I may have a problem. lol
---
But in all seriousness. I‚Äôve been collecting various figures for about 13 years now. Nendoroids just happen to be a portion of those. I have received a few of them as gifts as well.
---
I want that ps4 controller.   Looks amazing.
---
No it's the down vote button on reddit
---
I did record it, in text format, stupid.
---
/s
---
In all seriousness, partially because it was over Discord and I'm a little dumb with recording audio like that, and partially because of her own Reddit-shyness. 
---
I might record the Survivor edition though, as soon as I can get some editing software.
---
I think its kill 25 of the original 4 survivors each to get their faces. So kill 25 clauds to get the smartface, kill 25 Dwights to get the leader face, ect.
---
What is it
---
The end of the game is as important as the start of the game, so it should be taken into consideration to fine tune it.
---
They‚Äôve already balanced the beginning of the game by ensuring that the matches start out with 5 players, so why not try to balance the last part of the game so it‚Äôs more enjoyable for both sides?
---
And killers don't have time to chase a survivor for potentially that long  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø.
---
I do not understand how freddy players can play on ps4. 15 frames in the fog sounds miserable.
---
Every Claudette ever
---
Thanatophobia (Nurse perk), hex: no one escapes death (hag perk), hex: ruin (hag perk), and dying light (the shape perk).
---
I know how toxic tbagging and shit is so I stay away from all that. I've been getting a bit better at looping and such, and of course not every game is like that; I was just super salty and down about the last like (actual) 6 games or so of toxicity. Played one game as killer and had all friendly survivors and now I'm in a better mood.
---
Her power pretty much ends the chase in an instant if the player is good enough
---
If I didn‚Äôt play counter strike growing up, I probably would have been on console too. Different strokes for different folks man. I gamed for years on a PC and could never comfortably play on a console. Controls always feel clunky and unsatisfying.
---
Rob zombie lol
---
I‚Äôve never played Freddy. Part of me wants to cause of this build TrU3 uses but my luck I would invest a million and not get the perks lol
---
Those barrels of fire are surprisingly good at hiding from the Killers view.
---
I play P3 Bill and I‚Äôve had Killers walk right past me, as long as you stay behind the fire, it distorts you and hides pretty well.
---
Bill and any forest Map with Rocks/Shadows is GGEZ
---
Well the nurse player would have to not only know the how their blink works but also need to read exactly what the survivor is doing and unless they run in a straight line in the middle of nowhere, it usually requires an educated guess if the survivor is behind a wall. Don‚Äôt get me wrong on maps with very little walls or line of sight blockers nurse is really strong but she‚Äôs can be mindgamed at pretty much every tile that she can‚Äôt see the survivor on
---
Now i got some exploring to do lol
---
r/GrammarNazi r/iamverysmart r/AmItheAsshole
---
Let's find out haha
---
SaAaAaAaAaAaMe
---
Why
---
Do they have a website?
---
Exactly lol. Basically, if you kill the obsession before they cleanse ruin... Gens are getting a complete stop haha.
---
Literally, we aren't that different. Practiced players can get hits just as easily, nurse is harder, but can still be just as strong.  60fps is no different than 30.
---
Well not everyone lives in the US they are almost 100 where I live and that‚Äôs really overpriced for a tiny figure that fits in the palm of your hand
---
So they DC in five and a half nanoseconds? Now that‚Äôs epic!
---
It's remember me legacies players. XD
---
I mean what else are you going to do? Go hook them 11 more times  before 1 gen is done? XD
---
As a surv main if I run 4 gens I expect to die by facecamp.
---
Eh, Nurse a little bit, so she can see her prey while fatigued a bit more easily, but M&amp;B is the better choice because of the FOV increase being the secondary effect to it's already great TR reduction.
---
Yo, why does it say level 1 trapper in the top right corner?
---
I mean..it worked.
---
Ah
---
Wait, can you explain this a bit better?
---
Unless its event farming, and not even then for the most part.
---
survivors when i play freddy
---
Console killer main here, no
---
"Useful" isn't quite the correct term to put it. When it comes to Shadowborn, there will always be better perks.
---
Shadowborn is nothing but a QOL. Having a wider FOV can help tracking and spotting survivors hidden in corners. 
---
Personally, I can't play Nurse without it because it helps not losing survivors during Fatigue.
---
Close your eyes, problem fixed.
---
What servers?
---
I got the offering when using The Trapper but no idea why it says level 1.
---
Like the long hold M1? I don't think so but I might be. That would make sense.
---
Ace is one the most quiet I think, even injured he makes almost no sound
---
Ahhh. I never understood that. Thanks!
---
Literally no need for the hostility, I have no way of knowing where you live. The price that you see around you is clearly the retailer including import costs to get the stock to sell locally where you are at. At base cost they are not that price, it‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt see the value in them. You aren‚Äôt obligated to buy them. Unless you do want them and don‚Äôt want to pay the inflated cost. In which case you could always import yourself. It‚Äôs usually cheaper in the long run.
---
Take my money BHVR
---
i disagree as survivor main former killer main (switched because i now play with friends more often)
---
*deadhards while crawling*
---
There's no ELO afaik, it goes by rank and connection for the most part. Most new  free-weekend players are likely playing Survivor with their friends which will make Killer queues to be lower, causing the game to pair you up with someone of higher rank just so you can find a match.
---
But don't give up on the game just yet as there is a bit of a learning curve. You and your friends will get better and will get more helpful perks. The biggest piece of advice I was given was to not play to escape, but to play to get the most points.
---
I began playing the game with two friends who were rank 3 and had over 3.5k hrs in the game. It sucked always being found first as the killers were Rank 1 and I had shit perks in comparison. Looking back, I definitely appreciate that I was thrown to the wolves because I had to learn that being stealthy doesn't really reward, taking risks does.
---
If its final survivor I just do this outta boredom...
---
A meme isn‚Äôt good with a typo
---
This is my present issue as well. I feel like I would really enjoy this game but I don't have  a group of freinds who are interested in it and thus am not looking forward to getting matched with some toxic players. Maybe it's just luck of the draw but it seems pretty imbalanced presently.
---
Wish there was a reddit discord group or something like that for this :)
---
Fuck
---
Yea it‚Äôs interesting maybe I‚Äôll post some pictures later lol, maybe Benedict escaped and left his journal in those crevices?
---
yes when i play survivor. When i am killer the survivors will disconnect randomly, and i know it's not them because when it is done by choice the sound plays. Whenever it's the survivors i play against, there is no sound.
---
Legion would be a playboy and an iPhone
---
Nope try it out.  I always forget to clip it when something good happens.
---
No, not that, the fact that a game ended so quickly BECAUSE of IH is what‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù
---
He is! With a troll/meta build, he is 100% fun to play! If you don't find him fun to play.. then is just you!
---
Not always.  Plus killers automatically generate points a lot easier.  They dont gave to share points with 3 other people
---
Rip hairbow.
---
For us to keep up with it, it would literally be the most frustrating grind to even reach levels comparable to players who have been around awhile. The F2P weekend was supposed to entice new players not have them slaughtered by high levels. Most people aren't going to have fun just dying over and over and over. We're all under level 5. I'd rather wait on an infected player who is new than have them pair us with veterans.
---
The obsession has a circle around their name
---
Why do you care that much? If I get tbagged I literally don‚Äôt care and say gg then move on instead of arguing over it
---
Post results if it works!  Video ideal.
---
Them just luv taps.
---
Darn
---
Oh I make sure to sit in the exit til the last second because I know the bitch who tried to sandbag me is sitting by the hatch.
---
Then why is your power for the shape
---
This is really good I love the little chibi art at the top and that they included all of the legion... Even if susies kind of a push over
---
He's John Wick now?
---
.... I don't understand why ya'll act like Red Ranks are really important when there's no reward for being there and everyone complains about queue times anyway.
---
I wanna see Billy go Gear 3 at least
---
Nice try, I‚Äôm not playing trapper until I see a post of ‚Äúvirgin swf vs chad solo survivor‚Äù
---
Should we tell em‚Äô there are no servers.
---
She doesn't choke you she full on feels your neck and yoinks you on out of there.
---
I know right he came in with Noed and A Mori simply because I had a flashlight. I‚Äôm sure he is a lot nicer.
---
hol up, lemme rephrase, can it be of any use with specific killers, like billy , freddy and nurse
---
Straight up.
---
She literally pounces on survivors.
---
Heehoo i saw ur boobies
---
probably XD i couldve escaped a few times i think, but panic is a hell of a drug
---
welp shit im dumb, must have been bad hosts? I thought they had servers because me and my friends in a public match were all rubber banding.
---
Cursed images
---
There is only one viable counter to this rework.
---
We need to give survivors the finger guns now.
---
Don't appreciate a valid complaint being called "bitching about it" but whatever.
---
&gt;Just don‚Äôt get hit
---
And all the world‚Äôs problems were solved in an instant.
---
I wish Monto would stream
---
I still fail to see why it‚Äôs a problem for them to do that. When they do it hit them so they leave . It‚Äôs really nothing to overwork yourself about
---
Exactly, not that hard. Just don't let her blink to you ggez
---
Waking up takes 7 seconds away from two survivors. I already mentioned this. This is AS MUCH AS SNAPPING OUT OF IT TAKING 14 SECONDS OUT OF ONE SURVIVOR. Also failed skill checks lose 10%. NOT 4%. They would have to repair the gen for SIXTEEN SECONDS in dream state to BREAL EVEN. Also, guess you are mister horse shoes, as you totally get skill checks every ten seconds, which by the way will still set you back, so EVERYONE must get skill checks every ten seconds. Also, Pig has at max five traps. Freddy can infinitely sleep them. And it doesn't require downing a survivor to do so. And bad luck screws him over less. With Pig, bad luck removes your stall entirely. With Freddy, bad luck slows down the rate you apply slow down. NOT cripple it. 
---
Spirit IS A 50/50. A STRONG 50/50. I have indeed played her. She's either phasing or she's not. Can it get more complicated? Yes. Will it? Not always. But since we will just down play anything Freddy has, let me do this.
---
Clown saves a few seconds during a chase. He has NO Mind games outside basic ones, and we've established Spirit has good chase cause of that. Freddy has shortness, and the fact that the dream mist + fog can make it hard for survivors to tell where you are. Freddy more than makes up for "lost time" during chases with slowing progress down.
---
Also, it seems you think "sleep one person and ignore the others" is a good idea. If you're breaking chase with Freddy, you do it to sleep survivors, not just cause like you'd think. You should be cutting the survivors off when they try to go to good loops. Also, pallets and Windows shut him down? Tell me, does the term mind game mean anything? Yes, that's why Spirit is good. Freddy HAS mind games better than the average killer. Think, if they're asleep, your smaller tr and the mist make it harder to spot Freddy. If you're awake, he can mind game you to take a hit because he didn't follow the loop like a normal killer. When you are transitioning them to sleep, you should be mind gaming if you want to chase them. Otherwise the seven seconds ACTUALLY becomes problematic in this scenario.
---
Tell me, does the small tr make Michael undetectable? Cause the survivors have eyes. They will spot that white mask. The survivors have ears. They will hear breathing and in the pig's case roaring. They can see these people. Freddy cannot be pin pointed while you're awake. Every other killer can. Grass, corn, and crows only get you so far if he's avoiding them.
---
Legion and Ghostface are the 2nd time actually.
---
&gt;dying to the entity isn't a kill
---
well that's just incorrect
---
I want that Sombra controller
---
"Ignore the bullies" is not good advice, that just ensures nothing changes and people keep doing whatever it is they were doing.  
---
Also, triggers are actual things, don't conflate it with someone being pissed off on the internet.  They shouldn't be treated like a joke.
---
Beginning menu, during game for weapon, and some killers moris aren‚Äôt first person (such as spirit)
---
&gt;They do it because it bothers you. 
---
Better?
---
at this point i dont even think the people that do it know why.
---
I do it when i meet a teamate at the start of a match as a greeting, and if a teamate heals me I do it as a way of thanking them. Never do it to the killer unless its like a friendly pig whos doin it with us.
---
The hair looks like that because it‚Äôs meant to, most of her hair is put down if you look closely and it also has stuff in her hair
---
I can hear the *darn*
---
I've been playing a lot of jumpscare myers recently and it's so much fun. Having these Neas and Claduettes urban evasioning towards you just to surprise them around the corner. Most usually dc quite fun 10/10
---
God you are overly sensitive about such small things
---
still even if he is supposed to be Jason it didn't stop them from Adding Leatherface and Ghostface when Hillbilly and Legion exist.
---
Submitted my application! Hope I get in.
---
You're a damned heathen. 
---
  
---
I did like the reboot pretty well, though, and agree it's the only reboot worth a damn so far.
---
Biggest pussy award goes to you my good sir
---
Why is this marked nsfw? Lmao
---
Platinum Dunes, iirc, is even more tight fisted with their licenses than pretty much anyone.  I could be misremembering though.
---
You can‚Äôt kill survivors if ya ain‚Äôt cute
---
I have a strong hateboner for all Claudette's, it doesn't help matters her scream when hooked is my favorite to hear.
---
Dude do you know how many times a fucking killer Chase's me? EVERY GAME!!!!! I have to DC every time. How do I play this game!?!!?!???? Im deleting it
---
Badass
---
I'm afraid to lose the nice things I've plundered so I never use them, I'm glad others do too. it's a simple solution for my boosted ass.
---
I feel your pain man.  That's just how survivors are. They think because they've one a game they have a right to disrespect people and belittle them. I get messages from random survivors even when i play as fair as possible. They just don't know what it's like to be a killer so ignore them if you can.
---
I get irritated as a killer main with teabagging but usually I take that as me needing to take a break from the game and kind of refresh and remind myself that unfortunately this is how the game is. Sometimes survivors tend to teabag me because I‚Äôve played a really tough killer that match and they‚Äôve outmaneuvered me, and good for them, even though sometimes it really irks me (they won, y‚Äôknow!) 
---
Ultimately I personally really dislike it as something that happens during the game but I‚Äôve accepted it, especially because I play on console and so I can‚Äôt necessarily do anything about it or say anything about it to the survivors. It‚Äôs annoying but if I‚Äôm getting really bothered by it I just take a break.
---
Boy, that sure is some projection.  
---
Did I say *anywhere* in my post that killers are incapable of being toxic?  No, I didn't.  Did I say anything about face camping, tunneling, etc being ok and not toxic?  No, I didn't.  I have no idea what point you're making by jumping in here and turning the conversation on "killers can be toxic too!"  
---
Don't really give a fuck about this "both sides are bad" shit, I'm talking about something specific here.  And by and large, yes I encounter waaaaaay the fuck more toxic survivors than I do toxic killers.  For every facecamping leatherface survivor game, I get 2 or 3 at least teabbagging, post-chat taunting/insulting killer games.  It's not even close, in my experience.  
---
So again, thank you for your familiar input of "killers can be bad too."  I see you still like to chime in on survivor complaints with how "the other side" is just as bad.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt an apple be the counter to doc tho
---
Yeah, I'm starting to think those survivors were right about him...
---
Hey I don't know if anyone will see this because its 2 weeks later but I'm sorry. I thought the pun was good I just hate going against stealth killers. I didn't mean to ruin your fun.
---
-Megan
---
I didn‚Äôt want to be neutral though. I wanted to be antagonistic.
---
Run DS. If you manage to get off the hook, they just fucked themselves.
---
Just the price that surprised me. Those suckers tend to go for ~$50 each.
---
I am not. I never watch thier streams.

Non US/UK timezone is the only advantage I have lol

Omfg my last 2 brain cells ran out, also it's water cuz he has electricity and if u threw water at him he'd die

this is beautiful. Whoever did this is a true mad lad and deserve an award.
---
I like that one, ‚Äòno nuts Nurse‚Äô. But it‚Äôs only for the tryhard Nurse‚Äôs, not the baby ones.
---
no diea
---
So here‚Äôs a general idea:
---
Jason can move bodies of dead/dced survivors around the map. Anyone within a certain radius of the body tenses up in fear, similar to being hit with the doctor‚Äôs electric shock attack, upon first seeing the body. 
---
That‚Äôs just one idea obviously, but it‚Äôs a unique power that‚Äôs based on what he does in the movies. I‚Äôm sure if proper time went into this multiple powers could be thought of, most better than what I just came up with.
---
I'm approaching 3k hours and have always used a wired (official Microsoft) 360 pad for survivor and mouse and keyboard for killer. Tried to use controller for killer once and I couldn't do shit with it.
---
What trailer?
---
It made me think it was servers because it happened 3 games in a row.
---
I respect you for seeing that us killers aren't always bad. Have a nice day.
---
Love Jeff. He became my new main
---
It's not a story the survivors would tell you.
---
Thank you  :)
---
You also want to stop chases a bit, especially if you can't win them quick, focus on breaking gens, and clear pallets they toss. Use the person you let go to be bait and draw more people so you have map awareness. From there pick the next best action, protect the 3 closest gens to each other for an easy late, down and hook the easiest target, protect hooked people based on knowledge you have,  disrupt a genrushes.
---
Going one hook at a time is a sound strat with everyone else, except maybe piggy, but Freddy doesn't have strong chase skills, so you can't afford to just stay on someone till hooked. And repeat. I can share a replay if you want.
---
It's absolutely projecting, you see a thread about someone annoyed about something, and you just had to jump in and say how "yeah well killers are bad too so it's not only survivors" which is entirely irrelevant.  You just had to bring some 'balance' to whining about killers to offset my post on survivors, for *some reason*.  I'm sorry you have issues with toxic killers, that doesn't make a damn thing I said wrong, or less of a problem, or I don't know what your intention was here, but your reply literally has nothing to do with "survivor teabagging is rude" as a topic.  
---
Facts.  Deal with it.
---
I don't think she should be nerfed, but I think her add ons should (no more than 3 blinks, range add ons don't stack)
---
Wishing I didn‚Äôt work üò≠üò≠üò≠

The Doctor in game IS swole it's just a very easy detail to miss when his eyes and mouth are permanently clamped open
---
It's a BHVR legend.
---
Eh I also want to Mori the "Shell" of the DC'd survivor. If I bring a Mori I shouldn't have it "robbed" by salty DCers.
---
I feel like plague is generally mid tier. She has some good pressure in that her power means you're either always injured or you give her an arguably stronger ranged attack than huntress.  She can get looped but other than that she's pretty middle of the pack.

"Cruisin' down Haddonfield in my '64"
---
Huntress has the best stun sounds
---
Not considering pig of course
---
Not the bullet buttons nooo
---
You guys aren‚Äôt in any sense. I‚Äôm a survivor main and I hate seeing all imbalances for the killer sides. If a killer is miserable playing then that‚Äôs gonna make playing survivor miserable too, and vice versa. Each side takes out stress on the other and it can make the game a pain in the ass when you‚Äôre just trying to have a good time.
---
Plus we all know the survivors who get mad and turn into toxic killers to pick on someone to make themselves feel better, and the other way around.
---
Bad bot
---
Why?  Why is this being oversensitive?  Why isn't the problem someone being needlessly rude to someone else?
---
Oh look at you, clever bean.
---
It‚Äôs the same reason why MoM‚Äôs aura reading isn‚Äôt as useful to the Killer as it would seem: the Survivor can still loop the Killer. They just have to be more careful.
---
Yes!
---
Yeah, that would have pretty broken with today's perk variety.
---
Hell yeah!
---
I‚Äôd also love to see something like this for when the killer DCs, just imagine the meme potential
---
While playing killer on PS4, the trial glitched and didn‚Äôt allow me to hook survivors in hooks that i had already used. Their meter after being hooked wouldn‚Äôt go down either. One of the survivors said that he couldn‚Äôt even get to the match results unless he left the trial. Has anyone else encountered this?
---
Im just saying that even at its worst her power isnt luck based like someone like trapper or pig and applies similar pressure. Being sick while repairing does contaminate the gen so it is easier to see where people are as well. The constant noise is also a bonus.
---
It is not so much toxic as it is unanimously agreed that Blendettes are just the fucking worst kind of people.
---
I was on the hatch and the guy left the exit gate about 7 seconds before the timer ran out. pic related
---
3 Blink max, remove the travel speed add ons, add more fatigue reduction add ons, and give her 100% MS.
---
Having 5 blinks, or instant Blink travel is what makes her a God.
---
I don't want to see her nerfed, but I would be ok with it, seeing as even a basic baby killer can do ok with her when they use the right load out.
---
Should have put ghostbuster for the spirit
---
And then what?
---
I had a game do this.
---
I got my Blood Points, could spectate (IIRC) despite being disconnected from the host (in theory), and everyone was still playing. I read as escaped.
---
I also depipped, which confused me. You depip if you disconnect, but don't get your BP if you disconnect.
---
I depipped because it was an early DC and I'd not done much, kept my BP, and stayed in the post-game lobby.
---
&gt;wireless cable
---
Repeat after me
---
Yo ho, yo ho, near the hooks I'll never go
---
It's still p2p. Not in Dedicated yet.
---
Or the asshole waits out your Borrowed Time, then proceeds to slug you to wait out your DS :|
---
One good jump scare grab off a gen with monitor and abuse will show you he was worth every penny.
---
Clown:  (Laughs in 115% movement speed)
---
I absolutely love Sloppy Butcher and/or Nurses Calling on Legion.
---
I'd main Jeff more if he weren't so damn big!  I feel like I can't immerse for shit with that big lug.  Still love him though.
---
Those doctors will spawn the rest of the game as long as they're tier 2 madness, which is getting shocked like twice lol. Freddy's aura reading is only when they're asleep, which they won't be for long if not getting chased. And if they are getting chased, you don't need aura reading.
---
Ikr
---
Nea killer le funni me me
---
OMG IKR SORRY I RAN OUT OF IDEAS
---
Well, hiding then DCing when caught is ;)
---
I had a Nea like that on my team earlier.
---
More like he gets hit with a Iridescent Head and instantly DCs.
---
I mean, they won't see it since they closed the game...
---
Most times* on PS4 anyway
---
Billy can trade though
---
The whole thing is seen as survivors being little bitches because DCing is for little bitches.
---
Lol I only tbag for certain occasions. Tbag to say hello to team members, tbag to say thanks for a heal, tbag to get a killer to chase me for dailies (only if they already chasing someone) or at the exit gate if the killer was being a dick by tunnelling/camping/head nodding after every down/hook. Those are the only times I tbag.
---
What do you mean by trade?
---
yea thats true theres defintley some scenarios that are pretty intense for survivors tho, getting chased by the killer when haunted ground pops and trying to last long enough for the timer to go down is one for sure
---
I‚Äôm assuming PC. I‚Äôve heard a five blink nurse on there is painful. Ive never had a problem with nurse and hate playing her. I‚Äôm Xbox so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs the same for PS4.
---
I‚Äôd accept vigil working like this if MoM was deleted, but yeah we don‚Äôt need all of it together. SWF are miserable enough
---
I want that feeling to last for every chase. If not every chase most of them the killer would feel in control and the survivor would be feeling like a survivor if he/she gets away
---
Generator simulator xD
---
It's easier on console because the aim assist and its clunkier then PC, however when I see someone trying it I stop moving my body and just turn the camera usually works most people will tell you to stay still as killer so you can wait out the 360
---
Oh crap I meant *QUICK &amp; QUIET* not balanced landing!!!
---
To add to my previous post (pretend I said quick &amp; quiet instead of balanced landing) you can fast vault into lockers without it making a sound. Of course, this doesn‚Äôt matter if the killer has a perk that counters that aka they get a notification that a survivor is in a locker - think it‚Äôs a legion perk.
---
That's what i'm afraid of. Guess I need to git gud
---
Where is it?
---
If Swf was banned then maybe this would be acceptable, but can you please use your brain here.
---
I think the difference is that he exposes a survivor with his power, as opposed to making himself 1 shot.  
---
So it's better to surprise and attack one person, but doesn't have the temporary superman feel of EW3.
---
If it takes that long to get T2, play someone else.
---
Gtfo you faker.
---
Was getting camped AGAIN by the Wraith,  so it took me a minute. Lol.
---
That's the thing i like the character and I want to learn to play him, but every time I start to stalk someone from afar they immediately duck behind something, and by the time I get to them they're gone.
---
No
---
Should‚Äôve used the new episodes muda beatdown
---
That‚Äôs because most nurses are bad
---
They need to redo the DC system, make it so that someone DCing 30 seconds in a match isn't an insta lose, or at least make it so that everyone's time wasn't wasted.  
---
It should give everyone a stack a WGLF and BBQ if applicable, give everyone extra points based on how long the survivors were in the game.( the more time, the more points, not too much, but enough that it help make up the time loss)  
---
Plenty of stuff to add to make the game better for everyone, basic QoL stuff really...
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has been banned yet, BUT do it at your own risk because if EAC bans you then the devs won‚Äôt help you get out of it.
---
I spend too much on this game
---
Get better at tracking. I used to main Mike, but switch to Billy for map pressure. First thing, get T2. Don‚Äôt attack until then. If you can‚Äôt get T2, then I can‚Äôt help you. Tracking is the entire game, so if you lose people a lot, play more survivor.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten there unfortunately but when I do I‚Äôll use it for something that‚Äôs for sure
---
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs
---
Legion is hot garbage, jeff has lackluster perks.
---
Oh, ok, sorry.
---
No, just specifically fuck your opinions.
---
How is this at all op? If swf wanna do nothing but run around and do no gens then be my guest.
---
I use the schoolgirl outfit with the 1st skin's hair c:
---
I think they go really well together, and short hair makes it harder for the survivor to keep track of you on low loops where long hair is very visible when it stands up straight.
---
You dc'd a bunch of rank 10's. I can't rn.
---
I think it was more that Legion was unfun to play against, especially with the moonwalk exploit. It wasn't that he was powerful, just that he wasn't really fun and engaging. Especially when Infinite Mend Legion became a thing.
---
They get points for people DC‚Äôing
---
It seems like you just need to practice a little bit more. I would recommend watching streamers and see how they play killer. I would recommend watching truetalent play! That‚Äôs the best advice I can give! Helped me a lot
---
Really though, its happened twice by this point.
---
Once the survivor was on a COMPLETELY OPEN-AIR GEN and just matching my strafing exactly, the other was someone trying to loop killer shack after wasting god pallet, tried to loop again despite me hitting him once with the tactic already.

---
Sometimes I wish this was how the locker POV actually was
---
Micheal is a stealth killer while in EW1. His terror radius is basically nothing, and with Monitor and Abuse, it's literally nothing. Never walk out in the open. While walking towards a generator you think might have survivors on it, try to keep los blockers between you and them so they don't see you coming and then peek around corners just enough for you to stalk them without them seeing you. The range on the stalk is pretty long so you can do it from far away. After getting into EW2 he becomes just like any other 115% speed killer, but with half the terror radius. He's very good at ambushing survivors. With M&amp;A his terror radius goes down to 8 meters. You should start chasing survivors in EW2, getting hits when you can, but you spend most of you time charging meter. Try to get it as close as possible to EW3 without going over, so when you get close to a survivor you can just tap it and instantly go into EW3 for the insta-down. In EW3 he becomes the single scariest killer in the game with enhanced movement speed, vault speed, and a dramatically longer lunge, with one shot downs to boot. After going back to EW2, simply repeat the process. Charge to 99%, wait until you need it, pop it, insta-down repeat until all survivors are dead.
---
Just ace
---
I really wish they'd make more (all) of her hair the same way as the first set. The way she has ribbons of hair that move as though they're suspended in water, they react to her movement but float gracefully.
---
The schoolgirl set has a similar more physical appearance, but just looks like someone's holding a vacuum above her head sucking it straight upward.
---
Her default and new set just have this awful smokey effect with a really obviously repeating animation. When her default model moves it's obviously made from large chunks, it bends at harsh sharp angles rather than natural curves like hair should have. It really just looks like they chucked on what would be easy, not what would look best. If she had more dynamic hair she wouldn't look like such an awful upside-down mop all the time.
---
Ah, I didn't realise we were in cartoons where any electical supervillain suddenly loses control of their power because they're slightly moist.

Some people DS on death hook while they are getting hooked to save a pip. For some reason it doesn't take away your pips when you disconnect. Plus it doesn't really make too much of a difference to their teammates/the killer if they do that once they get death hooked.
---
It looks like it does, but if you reload your game they are still there.
---
I also think DC-ing against hackers/lagswitchers and hostage doc is warranted.
---
I have gotten one jumpscare with him, pulled someone off a gen. I'm also a doctor main so I have monitor unlocked, I'll take that advice thanks
---
Thanks lol. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll have the perfect ghosting build if you link up Lithe, Dance with Me and Q&amp;Q - you can add Iron Will to this as well if you‚Äôre injured
---
Great. More people to not do anything about the memes.
---
Gotta say I got to around number 5 before I realised it was satire :‚ÄôP
---
Don‚Äôt let other people make decisions for you. Legion is still fun to play and he has some great cosmetic items. It‚Äôs on sale. What‚Äôs the harm?
---
Did I say getting red rank was important?
---
Holy god, $40-50 US for a tiny little weeb doll, no thanks.
---
Yikes on that strawman. 
---
If the battlepass doesn't give Auric Cells/Shards/BP it won't be P2W.
---
If the battlepass only gives Auric Cells/Shards/BP in the free pass it won't be P2W.
---
Definitely don't misrepresent someone's argument to push for your false narrative, it's not intelligent.
---
Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia can pretty much halt games for a while if you can injure everyone, and if you use a longer mending time add on, completely dirty plays. The whole build is pretty reliant at how good you are creating pressure though, so take that into consideration. 
---
Another one is Save The Best For Last and Monitor and Abuse. It's pretty much an ambush setup, you have a smaller terror radius and attack quicker. You get stacks so easily with Legion's power sometimes it's ridiculous. I saw Tru3ta1ent use it and tried it myself it's great. 
---
Add ons that affect the timer are pretty much useless since the nerfs. Go for the add ons that increase your power duration and mending time. Cooldown are also good if you're going to play more like a basic attack killer but only Cold Dirt is really worth anything because the fatigue is still super long with the other cooldown add ons.
---
No, but it's not like Emblems really matter if you're not caring about ranking up.
---
Return with the results!
---
The jump between the Doctor and Myers is about as extreme as you can get. Myers is all about subtlety, the Doctor is all about lack of subtlety. Myers is happiest when has 0m terror radius, Doctor is happiest when he has 50+m terror radius
---
Yeah I run purple rank 3 distressing on my doctor lol
---
Only thing I‚Äôd tweak is making great skill checks never grant additional progression, even with tokens. Otherwise it‚Äôs just one skillcheck that may potentially not have the bonus progression from greats.
---
accurate
---
As a ps4 player this is always wild to me, but I get that it's all different on PC.
---
If she breaths, she's a THOT!
---
Points
---
 I fundamentally don't get how anyone is still complainning about it
---
YES! YES! YES!
---
Tryn installing other windows version, if it doesnt work, tell me...
---
I want to see it too but Marth currently has health issues that get in the way of streaming and I heard that his other 3 friends don't enjoy the game that much anymore (maybe that changed though). 
---
I also got rank 1 with old freddy when he first came out and it was not that difficult. I also got rank 1 survivor by being carried by my decent friends in swf back when the game was still young so I do know that rank 1s at the time did not mean as much as they do today. That being said they managed to do this to what would be decent killers without perks or items (and several other experiments) and like you said it was easier to pip back then yet they were still able to easily deny pips. I believe they counted 6 pips by game like 59 and two of those were a double pip from that game. 
---
Also I did not watch all of the games I linked but I can assure you there are more nurse games to watch if you want to see if they versed nurses that meet that requirement. 
---
The thing about recreating the experiment is I think the point will still get across that survivors are stronger (albeit they will lose a lot more pips to killers probably since it is a higher concentration of amazing nurses and hillbillies at rank 1). If they can run full perk sets I guarantee they can do amazing but maybe perkless would hurt more vs amazing nurses.
---
Paragrphs arent that needed tbh, i prefier wait more time and get more stuff
---
You and me both
---
Hillbilly looks like a bad Monkey D Luffy
---
It kinda sucks that the best a survivor can do in any situation against Nurse is turn it into a guessing game. At least with other killers there is punishment for making a bad read. Allowing the survivor to get to a really strong loop can greatly extend a chase. With Nurse there is little punishment for making a bad blink. The 2 second fatigue time is nothing when survivors move at 4 m/s, and she can blink 20 m after charging for 2 seconds. She can just guess a few times in a row until she gets you. This entire process is also trivialized by the range addons since they are bugged.  
---
It's like you're a free kill anywhere you can't mindgame, and even there you only get a 50/50.
---
I do it right when I hook them so I don't hear the long agonizing scream
---
Play on PC.
---
It's rank 15's lol
---
Lmao u almost had me till I saw the jokes, if I had Reddit coins I would give this a gold
---
80% with shards? More like 73%
---
Susie
---
I think I remember him mentioning that he wants to, so  thats something to look forward to!
---
Nope.
---
You already lost twice, accept it.
---
Resilence I‚Äôll take, given that I see it pictured with a lot of No Mither people and give it a more risk and reward style.
---
Left Behind still I would say is a little op but overall I think you did a pretty good job, people might say otherwise but good work.
---
No counter to getting face camped for the person on the hook ....
---
not gonna lie, i kinda love when the killer does it to me after looping him for 5 gens lol. it's like a badge of honor.
---
Interesting. I didn't expect this response. Is it because it's annoying or does it make you uncomfortable?
---
With his three unique perks  
---
The Clash Dinging, The Bash Slinging, and The Dash Ringing
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know which dev had the genius idea to let killer hit you, but it‚Äôs bullshit. Killer should just eat pallets and get flashlight stunned.
---
Well of he is the thing conducting the electricity the water would do nothing,as he is under constant expose to the electricity.
---
Imagine as the match starts, instead of the ominous music you hear "ARE YA' READY KIDS?"
---
They've been on sale once already this year and last halloween before that. So semi regularly I guess
---
If you're playing because of the free weekend on Steam then the killer times are long because everyone else wants to play killer.
---
It would help if you said your platform. Killer lobby times on consoles are bad enough but mix your NAT type in and it could be forever. PC lobby times vary but they aren't anywhere near as bad as consoles.
---
There's no real trick to get a lobby. Might just be the time you're playing, the ranks, your internet could be giving you a bad ping, could be a bugged lobby, etc.
---
**Abandon the generators.**
---
Seriously fuck that, thirty minutes or more? Run around on the other side of the map, go as far from the generators as possible and run back and forth in lines across the width of the map in stripes towards the generators. Any survivors hiding will end up being herded towards the generators (more than likely, it is possible they'll go backwards into areas you've already patrolled) and do them, any survivors at the generators will do the generators, and anyone you happen to see running in a panic is yours.
---
This is specifically if two survivors are left; **better to try and catch one at the exit gates for a 3k than to wait for ages for a 3k and possibly closing hatch.**
---
I mainly do it for fun, but I could see someone giving those reasons. Like for example Idk if you've ever paid attention to it, but ash is loud as fuck when you hook him
---
Up the Ante is too OP.
---
Two people running the perk will allow the team a 50% unhook chance.
---
The locker part is exclusive to Dwight
---
I love playing legion, and he's doing good for me ( rank 7 ). Oc, you need ruin and any other perks that will you'll need. I use ruin, thanataphobia, nurses and monitor.
---
Its either mind games or basically luck lol
---
Ko custom creations I think.just the skin tho.
---
It‚Äôs on their website too
---
Ruin on Spirit feels like overkill to me. I like playing her and she's easily strong enough without Ruin. At some point thete's just not much survivors can do anymore.
---
Happy cake day!
---
What a Salty  Salterson
---
indeed.
---
This post was brought to you by HybridPanda
---
Hello hello Sombra mains. Theres literally dozens of us.
---
That's good.
---
So these are the type of guys that run noed?
---
mountainous william III
---
Lol XD
---
Fuck yeah
---
Still sucks to get punished for doing your job well though.
---
Strong and annoying are different. Spirit is strong not annoying. Freddie‚Äôs isn‚Äôt strong but it‚Äôs annoying. Sometimes it‚Äôs how they use there power to hags that place 6 traps around a hook are annoying but that isn‚Äôt the strongest strategy for hag if anything it‚Äôs pretty dumb but it‚Äôs still annoying.
---
lmao, love old reposts.
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to be good at this game.
---
Noticed how those shitty immersed urban evasioning babies are always the ones escaping and pipping? That‚Äôs because they do the following -
---
1.Hide as soon as they hear heartbeat
---
2.Only start working on gens where they see that a survivor got injured
---
3.Will let their teammates hit second phase on the hook just so they can be safer
---
4.Die quickly in chases, so the killer doesn‚Äôt get his fragile ego hurt, and won‚Äôt camp them as a result
---
5.Sprint burst, sprint burst and more sprint burst.
---
Jeff is my fave male survivor. &lt;3
---
lol i honestly love it as someone who runs small game. 2 perk killer.
---
Timer needs to be about 15-30 seconds, imo.
---
And if you get healed, it goes away completely. 
---
It's just so overpowered still, and really. If a killer is going to tunnel, this ain't stopping them.
---
So i should just buy the DLC I want?
---
What God do you pray to and can I have their number?
---
It's possible it'll be on sale next week for the 3 year anniversary, but idk how likely that is.

---
Is it a shitpost? Baseline Ruin? Really?
---
Don't tunnel, and you basically delete DS from the game.
---
6-8 protection hits for MoM? How many hits do you need to kill those survivors? Are you playing vs terminators?
---
Tier 3 is huge at higher ranks when killers don‚Äôt try to tunnel, but they stumble upon you, the extra 20 seconds is huge imo.
---
Tier 1-3 doesn‚Äôt matter in the low ranks if they camp/hard patrol the hook
---
The only map I‚Äôm 100% positive they spawn on is Myers‚Äô map
---
She ain't breathin anymore i can tell you that.
---
The other argument is if Nurse is balanced, there's no defense left for why Survs shouldn't be nerfed (if other Killers won't get buffed).
---
The Sombra one :o
---
Clearly a shitpost
---
Exactly! If I don‚Äôt get hit when I‚Äôm hooked then I haven‚Äôt done my job.
---
Damn, im not really very toxic when i play survivor, but you really do sound like a whiny bitch rn
---
This can almost bait out anything or try to work around any camper except billy and leather face just annoying. But Campers don't fsr and Kindred exists. But agree its frustrating
---
honestly, I think mettle just needs an increase by 1 hit. but DS  is no issue at all
---
killer main btw
---
It means you are I m m e r s e d
---
So this should happen to killers who DC too
---
Is that when they're fully sacrificed and it plays the final "sacrifice complete" sound 1000x at the same time and sounds like the reverberation of a steel box being hit in a giant warehouse?
---
Yeah that sounds about right
---
Given that it stopped when I accidentally hit a wall I think I'll do it immediately on purpose next time
---
I heard good things about this, gonna try it out.
---
Pig's that use the rbt's as a tunneling tracking device. Also spirit that phases just far enough from hook so that she can tunnel phase off of hook. Iridescent huntress.
---
I think "buzzard" is the superior concept here...
---
I always forget it‚Äôs there and when I go down to look for Ruin the light makes me think it‚Äôs the totem for a second lol
---
I only corrected so he could find the anime. But instead of things being weird in JoJo‚Äôs you just have Buzzards annoying tf out of guys named JoJo, that‚Äôd be wild.
---
Tbh, the only thing that should be nerfed about her are some of her addons, cause as of now, she's one of the only killers who are actually decent without addons, so using good addons on her makes her overkill.
---
In order to fix that, the omegablink and extra blink addons could get reworked to have (meaningful) negative effects as well.
---
Otherwise I think she's absolutely fine.
---
As someone who has never played Outlast, you've definitely sold me on the concept and this post has me super excited for an Outlast chapter.....
---
I agree. Her scream seems to be one of the longest
---
Hi scared ^-^
---
It's Xbox and PS4 as nurse is hard to play on those because of the fps and controllers. She is really hard to get good at on console and isn't really viable if you're not a GOD
---
Yup
---
&gt;And if Nurse does get nerfed, that means Billy takes the cake. After that, the most effective killer is something much easier to play thus being encountered more often than a good nurse ever was.
---
I don't think Billy is far and away #2. He's around there, but his map pressure goes from clearly the best, to crap if he gets a map like The Game. After him, the next most effective Killer is Hag, who's skill cap is probably even higher than Nurse.
---
If that's a surprising thing to hear, you simply haven't seen what 2000+ hour Hag mains are capable of, and how much thought and mechanical execution goes into it.
---
And behind Hag it's going to be Huntress, who's macro is relatively simple, but her mechanical skillcap is ridiculously high. Like Hag, she has tech most players have never seen.
---
But I do agree that simple Nurse nerfs are a problem and honestly a rework would be best.
---
the last time they were on sale, was before the plague went live, as there is a current sale on steam for the game + dlcs on sale you could get lucky before ghostface  goes live
---
Not in-match tho, only pre-game and post-game lobby
---
You're stating the obvious, and just repeating things we've both said. What's your point? Should legion players abuse exploits because it's the dev's job to fix it, not the player's job to avoid it? This may not be an exploit, but it is driving the game towards a meta that's not fun. No one may be punished but is it fair to whine if your entire team is running adrenaline and the killer eliminates you one by one rather than splitting damage and risking 4x full health survivors when the gens pop? I don't think so, but thoughts aren't facts.
---
Is it fair to whine if your entire team automatically heals to full at the start of the late game and the killer downs you in one hit in the late game?
---
NOED may be a crutch perk, but it may become a necessary one instead if there's no situation where survivors aren't fully healed when the last generator pops. I don't want it to be that way, and I know you (survivor mains out there) don't either. 4x adrenaline will cause those situations, and NOED will be the best, most reasonable answer.
---
Not in-match. This is from the pre-game lobby, you can chat on it when playing on PC
---
DS should be a 15-20 second timer that pauses when you go in a chase or gets slugged. Then it would be a genuine anti tunnel perk that couldn't be countered by being slugged and the killer dry humping you for 60 seconds before picking you up, and it would stop the scenarios where you don't tunnel someone and still get d-striked bc of the 60 second timer.
---
MoM needs to be removed I agree.
---
Ruin baseline is dumb, the way to fix short ass games isn't to touch gens, but to add a secondary objective.
---
 15-30 second timer is kinda dumb yeah. DS should be a 15-20 second timer that pauses when you go in a chase or gets slugged. Then it would be a genuine anti tunnel perk that couldn't be countered by being slugged and the killer dry humping you for 60 seconds before picking you up, and it would stop the scenarios where you don't tunnel someone and still get d-striked bc of the 60 second timer.
---
the devs have stated they do not actively ban people for it, as many streamers do it 
---
But they have also said they will not unban you if by some chance the system picks up on it and banishes you to the shadow realm

Ya, but not if they ragequit by ant-f4ing.
---
Wait, are you saying the game is balanced around solo survivors?
---
Freddy is my favorite killer, lol.
---
dedicated aren't out yet......
---
But i get where you are going with this
---
last night me and my friends played against billy one by one the game would dc us i was the first i kept my items 
---
as i was watching their play "spectate"  2 more got dc'd on our end it showed the killer dc'd but the game was still on as our last friend got hooked and his end game showed the rest of us dc'd
---
r/comedyhomicide
---
shadow clone jutsu'
---
You forgot to mention killers aren't allowed to open lockers!
---
The only time when it's acceptable to dc is if the survivor/killer is cheating.
---
Figured.
---
I disagree, you did something. *Every* match you were in, the killer could not say "they were all running DS!" you made a difference. I would venture and say there are other players just like you and realized that the perk wasn't balanced and chose to not use it themselves. 
---
Individuals believing that their actions don't make a difference is one of the greatest calamities even a society can face. 
---
You didn't have a responsibility to the community thrust on you but you took one upon yourself anyway, which is what makes you a good person. 
---
The developers have a *job*, and that's different because they get paid to do it, and not doing their job means they don't get paid (as much?); this is not the same thing as a responsibility.
---
So teabagging would be toxic in this case, but a mori right before the exit gate isn‚Äôt? ;)
---
It really do be like that sometimes.
---
You can pre-charge the next chain blink while you‚Äôre still in the previous blink.
---
How about not making M1 Killer shit ?!?  If they nerf the nurse, its the downfall of DBD completely, you guess pretend that it dosnt take fucking hours to master her and just login her in brings you the easy 4k -.-,
---
It's the same people who gave us the new Freddy, so it's def not out of the question.
---
I wouldn't say he was definitively better, but he was a great re-imagining regardless. I also hope for remake Jason as a possibility.
---
Found Patrick guys
---
Did... did you cross post from the same sub?
---
Thats not how it works buddy -.-,
---
They don‚Äôt know if you can escape or not so they‚Äôre probably just waiting
---
The PC Plebs think it, because thats the only killer there need to actualy try to suvive against, instead of clicky clicky EASY GG WP !
---
Keep it mind that some people dc against killers that play annoying. For example when you get slugged and you can see that the killer won't pick you up. I don't think people want to see that animation when they are a little annoyed already.
---
But besides that it's a cool idea, I just don't think it'll make it into the game
---
'Cause the plague spreads a sickness and that's why I chose vaccines
---
I would say we're more likely to get remake Jason over original Jason if we ever get either, which I am all for, remake Jason was worthy. However it's unlikely to happen while the lawsuit is in the air. Even if it's not original Jason, the holders and BHVR will want to stay safe.
---
Even more bullshit was when survivors could sometimes move before you. Literally watched the obsession being woken up by a team mate before I could fucking move. I just stood up and walked away from that one.
---
In the original movie Sally the final escapes by just jumping out a window
---
The grind's insane so you'd be tempted to open your wallet and spend. So be a good little consumer and spend. Spend, spend, spend!
---
Definitely good against bad players. I don't think anyone is going to waste their time hiding against a freddy. It's more effective to run and find a way to wake yourself up.
---
Oh fuck.
---
&gt; statistically had one of the lowest kills per game
---
source?
---
Kindness = Going out of your way to help someone else. You don't have to do it lmao, it's a choice. You say you're not a sweaty tryhard but you're treating the game like its the fucking olympics lol. Also you just made a new copypasta, nice.
---
I feel bad for the hooked survivor when one or more of their teammates tries looping me right next to them. Some people just really want those we're gonna farm together stacks I guess
---
You fool! You've only made him stronger! You've doomed us all!
---
I've never been good with the pig I just never understood how to get the best from her.
---

I was going to mention that but I was focused more on the last game. But yeah that too.
---
I don't think they can buff the speed on No Man Left Behind because if stacked with 100% buff on healing after hook rescue during End Game, you'd essentially almost have an instaheal.
---
This is a good example of what endgame collapse is meant to do. You and the other survivor wasted time hanging around instead of leaving through the gate, so you were killed for it.
---
We should pray...
---
I want to like her but most pigs I play against tunnel and camp the hook.
---
Exactly my thoughts
---
I'm immersed with David. Does it work? 80% no. Is it worth it for the abs? Yes.
---
You know how you already paid for the game?  Now you want to work hard to unlock those cool cosmetics?  Fuck you
---
I love pig and im so happy she's getting cosmetics, that all black outfit is gonna give her claudette levels of stealth.
---
Most of the Nurses at rank one in the old system were no where near the skill cap, not even remotely. I've faced a god Nurse before, someone who had thousands of hours playing her. It's like comparing a hobo with a switchblade to a fully geared Navy Seal.  
---
Sure you'll only run into a handful of Nurses that good, but you'll also very rarely run into a group as good as Marth's.
---
&gt; power gives you a boost in move speed
---
No, one or two specific addons do that and if you use them then you can't use his better addons and are gimping yourself.
---
&gt;survivors can heal downed survivors fully just like in every other scenario, except you can put both of them into the dream-world and then you got 2 people who are just losing time,
---
Except an awake survivor can heal a downed sleeping survivor faster than you can sleep them and stop them.
---
Yea, you should have a guaranteed safepip if you have at least one iridescent
---
Your comment doesn't make sense, if she good against good surviours, she must be good against the good ones too right?
---
Same tho!
---
I think it should be 50/50 but that is just me all that needs to be done is make sure the exits do not spawn super close to each other and the devs are looking into that last I heard
---
*A reminder that if you have bought every DLC the full game costs +100 bucks :D*
---
There are various BM actions but the main ones are teabagging and flashlight clicking.
---
Yeah whoops but Buzzard is pretty funny so I‚Äôm keeping it
---
Excuse me, what? She doesn't need a nerf, she just needs to have her addons reimagined.
---
I agree with the gates spawning in better locations but disagree with the 50/50. Not everything in the game needs to have a perfect balance between killer and survivor, EGC is not supposed to be a guaranteed escape or even a good chance at one. It's meant to be some small hope for the last survivor who is now effectively failing at their objective.
---
*sees Jeff* This does put a smile on my face
---
I cant let you go I've lost too much
---
*Holy loaded question Batman!*
---
Uhh, your comment didn't make sense. I'm assuming you meant "if she is good against good survivors then she must be good against bad and decent ones right?"
---
To which I reply with yes she is, I never said she isn't. What I said however was that Billy is BETTER against decent or bad survivors.
---
Console has inbuilt screenshot and recording capabilities, uses phone.
---
Ya I can understand that point of view. My only complaint with it was gate locations as I find it pretty cheap that when I‚Äôm bubba I can walk like 10 steps and see both exits lol
---
You should have used the 7 page muda instead of the Steely Dan beatdown, but either way you get an upvote because JoJo
---
He literally looks exactly like Bruce campel?
---
Legion is not that much fun, but his perks aren't bad. I use discordance quite often, and iron maiden is cool on huntress, and also pairs well with BBQ. Mad grit is also useful if you want to do basement builds.
---
She‚Äôs cool but I tend to not the ppl playing as her when ever it‚Äôs a pig at least for me the guy who is controlling her is a ass
---
Yeah that's a broken distance and needs to be fixed.
---
The greatest anime/manga of all time, JoJo‚Äôs bizarre adventure
---
I did this thinking yes ruin! Nope haunted ground instead owned and I'm like I shall save her! 
---
She died.
---
Spirit &amp; Hag.
---
Spirit because they usually haunt away only to haunt back in and tunnel.
---
Hag because 7 traps leading down the basement steps is a little overkill.
---
Haha hell yeah. Pig is my beast.
---
The ranking system is a joke overall. Not once did I save pip by getting tunneled for 4 gens straight. I swear to God looping a killer for 5 minutes should grant a double pip , but instead you barely save pip cus you didn't save anyone or do enough gens. Like there was time.
---
I'm pretty sure i've already seen it on the reddit before
---
Nurses brother
---
I hope that whatever they do with that battlepass thingy isn't predatory.
---
Hahaha
---
and people Always ignore clown and plague
---
:(
---
Why did you use a add on if you're gonna use the splitter?
---
It's always in a corner on the top floor. It's in the surveillance room where you can drop down into the shower room with the generator.
---
lol what that makes no sense doing that
---
That's the biggest concern I see. "You screw your teammates over" no. You dont if you are going to die anyways. So I'm not saying this happens every day but if I take a hook fair and square then get unhooked and put right back on over and over I'm dead anyways. It's not always another team mates fault either. If I'm being camped and they decide to try to help me anyways then good on them. They know if it was them they'd want someone to try for them instead of just doing the gens. Idk how many times I've died because I saved someone that was spending their match on the hook. It's basically the same as cheating and it's obviously acceptable to dc if someone is cheating right? It's a very narrow circumstance of what is actually acceptable and what's not. I'm not condoning anything that actually does screw the team like dcing on first down. If no one understands that then idk how anyone plays matches where you dont get a chance to do anything because of a insecure killer not being able to let the first hook go.
---
No luck yet. Only ended up on the damn map once, and the bastards gen rushed the whole time I was trying to get into it haha
---
It was usable and I‚Äôm guessing a fog whisperer said it was too strong
---
You guys pay ‚Ç¨10 for outfits? Here in Australia its $15 :(
---
Stronger than leatherface in basement tbh
---
Okay, Nurses and Thanatophobia is good but isn't the best build. I play only reworked Legion exclusively every day and the best build in my opinion is Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin and whatever you want some people run Save the best for last some run Sloppy whatever. Ever since the rework DbD devs fucked up Legion's addons and quite a few of them are useless but the best ones are for sure Iridescent Button and Mural Sketch, Cold Dirt is not very good anymore. Good luck
---
Yes.
---
This would legitimately help fix the frustration. Killer gets the sacrifice, disconnector gets what they deserve. Long term they need to stop the disconnecting from even happening, but it's a good interim fix. Good suggestion üëç
---
I never DC, but this is some shit that'd make me dc as a survivor, just watching my team get absolutely obliterated.
---
Pig
---
Amanda
---
Sexy Saw Lady
---
Or they could keep it exactly the same and keep the skill check chances the same as well as normal healing instead of -100% chance.
---
Why is every new outfit is in the most expensive category?
---
Sounds good at first but makes everything to easy again (for survivors)
---
Actually I think I have seen it before, I only noticed today that the original saw room is down stairs which was a pleasant surprise
---
Yes but when a survivor lags out. The killer is hosting the game,
---
So that means the killer has bad lag. And they DC because they don‚Äôt want bad lag. Even though the killer probably spent ages trying to find a match just for other people to see his FPS and leave.
---
Oh my goodness please grow up jesus there are way worse things to get offended for than people tbagging, stoooop.
---
The clearance check is only for line of sight - the totem can still be almost right next to you, provided there's something blocking line of sight from the exact spot you spawn
---
Clown, billy and legion
---
Maybe because balanced landing was brown
---
This is totally not the sixth time i've seen this
---
Same goes for killer DCs
---
Ah, I see you're a killer of culture as well.
---
after that facecamping and the double whiffs in an open area i honestly wasnt to shocked he lost you tbh :D
---
Wanker responds to a post rudely, fails to read title
---
What‚Äôs sad is we were all 11-13 and the killer was 14. Idk how it happened so horribly at once.
---
Julie, Wraith, Pig.
---
Tum tums, bing bong boy, and oinky
---
Nice
---
Finaly! A "I never even realized" post where I actually already realized it myself before I saw the post.
---
Im sitting here on my bed watching this and laughing and crying
---
I'd say Leatherface because of his chainsaw and Spirit or Nurse. Both the Spirit and Nurse have the ability to quickly teleport back to the hook so to see one of them camping it is both confusing and frustrating to me
---
This
---
Freddy, leatherface, trapper
---
If only I still played on console...
---
Myers
---
Sometimes spirit?
---
they've really stepped there game up with the cosmetics, I have a feeling im gonna be buying alot of cells over the next few months..
---
If you remember how it was in the beginning... I came so hard when they announced the cosmetic store
---
idk why survivors do that. if you're gonna DC then at least fuck with them lol. run into a locker and then DC.
---
damn that was sick
---
what if a killer DC's? Survivors get knives and get to stab a bit?
---
It would be end game destruction if you save em for the last gen.
---
Try etsy. They sell stickers for ps4 controllers as well and perhaps if you contact an artist he could whip out something similar to this one for you.
---
red rank nurse player, can confirm
---
Cosmetics are the best way how to support game, but not gain unfair advantage. God bless everyone who buy cosmetics and support our loved game.
---
with shadowborn, deerstalker, bbq and nurse's calling, no tunneling, no intentional camping, btw. still easy as fuck
---
The example could have been camping or tunneling as well, but that is sometimes seen as viable strategy as well. Survivors and killers both have "strategies" that are less fun to play against and killers dc as well so it's not only survivors.
---
And well I don't dc cause if I don't wanna play the match anymore I just let the killer sacrifice me and my problem is solved, but friends often complain about that, so I wanted to mention it.
---
Thanks
---
I remember as killer someone dc‚Äôd as I was grabbing him and his body was floating in front of me until I downed someone else
---
That would be seriously funny lol chasing someone and they Houdini in a locker
---
We gonna talk about spirit's face?
---
Agreed.
---
This is the third pig post in a row. Is it a holiday?
---
I bought one yesterday at the con dressed up as Dwight! Bought the faceplate for ¬£35, knew I needed one as soon as I saw them
---
I find I get better results with the shroud. Survivor spawns separated and asleep meaning I can IMMEDIATELY rush up to them and down them very quickly with red paint brush + monitor and abuse for zero terror radius. They seem to DC more consistently.
---
School spirit best spirit
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs just you that plays both sides poorly, you seem to be the only one throwing a fit on reddit because you had a tough time against mom and want it changed to please yourself entitlement. You don‚Äôt have much to say you play Freddy an absolute trash hole of a killer no wonder why you can‚Äôt win any games. The killer is trash and so are you. Thank you I didn‚Äôt want to have to assume it you said it not me
---
Way too many people for some reason. I don't understand since she isn't that powerful or has anything that makes her stand out really.
---
!IMTRequest
---
Well, the killer equivalent of an item is their power, so basically killers should unequip their powers or otherwise they are toxic
---
Ash irritates with teabagging and flashlighting so I tunnel him and camp so his Mom won't go off.
---
I realised it was satire when I saw it had upvotes
---
That's my kind of game. Well played.
---
I‚Äôd go for Nurse‚Äôs and Surveillance maybe? Or TOTH if you like totem guarding, help keep your ruin up and gives you some pressure.
---
Doctor and Freddy. I dabble in spirit.
---
I think she's fine just remove 3 and 4 blinks.
---
They were only allowed to use reboot Freddy for legal reasons unfortunately. They wanted original but couldn't get him.
---
&gt;I only really play killer and I don't know what happens if the killer disconnects
---
The game just ends instantly and survivors should get 5000 bonus bloodpoints for surviving
---
Spirit, Michael, and Hag
---
Look at her. She is SO cute.
---
Is your post supposed to be read as a poem or something? The formatting is slightly confusing.
---
I'm not even going to entertain this clear troll post with a serious response.
---
Meyers is trash. FIGHT ME. 
---
This subreddit is bordering on a cult at this point.
---
You DARE me?  Well let‚Äôs see!!  Without add ons it takes 7 seconds to hit a survivor rather than right away. Quite literally gens pop in your face in that time. Putting pressure also includes hitting multiple people in a short period of time, Freddy doesn‚Äôt let you do that.   Don‚Äôt fucking act like there‚Äôs no problem with Freddy when they‚Äôre LITERALLY DOING A REWORK on him.  They‚Äôre also nerfing MoM so killers LIKE YOU quit fucking crying so hard. 
---
The way you‚Äôve spoken to everyone on this thread who you didn‚Äôt agree with, you sounded like a complete tool. Go take your hiatus. Go leave this subreddit. Because I promise you no one will be upset bud.  
---
95% of these people on this thread either disagree with you or think you sound like a fucking jackass.
---
This meme and caption are giving me aids
---
I am 17 and a half. What do I Pig? Get it.
---
The banned pepe and the ok hand sign, because its a "white supremacist sign" ! Just for a example....
---
I did. You want chocolade?
---
You seem to forget that the true victims of DC's are the teammatesa
---
I run with Nurses, Discordance, Hex Ruin and either Pop Goes The Weasel  or Monitor Abuse. Just varies.
---
I recently bought her and I'm in love too! She's super fun to play.
---
*Happy Oinking*
---
Damn, that sucks. Hopefully someday we can get an OG Freddy cosmetic
---
I don't agree with this cause I hate limited time stuff. I'm not even a friend of legacy cosmetics even though I have 3 pieces and almost all event cosmetics. Some people might not be able to participate in certain events or might just discover the game later. I think it's good that they stay in the store to buy
---
Or rather they want to face camp, but they want to do it poorly. I'll take a bubba swinging his mallet for NO reason vs a bubba with half his brain still intact and a chainsaw ready.
---
They promised that new cosmetics wouldn‚Äôt all cost auric cells, we know how money works
---
He‚Äôs laughing that you play clown but mains Freddy...... Don‚Äôt give this fool the time of day. You earned yourself a silver Captain because you‚Äôve said everything I would have said myself.   He is literally asking for a free win because he failed to do his objective and came to reddit to bitch about a perk that‚Äôs being changed.  He came to reddit to bitch and whine instead of turning off his game!!! I find it to be really sad, actually. 
---
And here‚Äôs the thing, go ahead and share your opinions!! It‚Äôs made for discussions. Also the devs like to see what we think. But to say he‚Äôs leaving over it and calling people awful names and defending himself is ridiculous and childlike.
---
r/perkbydaylight has a lot of custom packs for you to try.
---
‚ÄúThere is absolutely nothing you can do about it‚Äù 
---
Ok psycho LMFAO.
---
I hope so too, I'm still holding onto hope that someday they'll also be able to get Jason's license.
---
I am. I love new info or seeing people talk abot Pig skins.
---
They usually dc when u down them. If they are down and the entity kills them, they will face the floor, meaning that you can give them a booty smack
---
you can buy killers with shards too. \*sips tea\*
---
Jeez, what's with the billy hate. Billy is not only fun to play but fun to play against imo. Chainsawing is like driving a car which is an interesting experience . There is also a lot of counter play to his power such as windows, pallets, any sort of wall or barrier, or 360s. I can understand nurse hate because she ignores everything survivors have and turns dead by daylight into a guessing game but Billy is a chill and fun killer and I just can't understand the hate Billy gets.
---
I reckon for Xbox, PlayStation and the switch! It would fix the queue time definitely
---
She hasn‚Äôt been nerfed in forever. They‚Äôd be out of their mind to rework her before fixing half the roster, which is too weak to pose a threat to good survivors.
---
We got Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Ghostface, and Ash. Jason is the only one left.
---
During the dev stream (I don't have an exact date, but it was the week or week after Freddy came out) they implied it was the only Freddy the license is willing to license.
---
Pennywise too
---
Just use a jar of lips to up your luck again lol
---
Same question as to why do killers DC at the end of the match after getting fucked the whole round. Why not wait 2 seconds for them to either leave or get killed by the entity and get the points you did earn.
---
Nice work! I love it!
---
Eeehh, I don't really consider him to be in the round table of Horror OGs but I'd like to see him
---
You need Auric Cells to buy licensed killers I believe, so like Michael Myers, Amanda from Saw (Pig), Freddy, etc. but for every other character you can buy them with Iridescent Shards, which you get just from playing. You get them every time you level your PLAYER level.
---
Thank you!!
---
Piggy, Myers, Freddy
---
Thank you, I've been confused for a while.
---
It‚Äôs simple, survivors are playing generator simulator, and killers are playing flashlight blind and pallet eating simulator.
---
since the rework is coming I want to give this post more attention but I do not want to claim credit for it so I do this.
---
r/titlegore
---
I agree. Cosmetics which you can buy in store have no value. Unfortunately i don't own legacy, but i have 2017 and 2018 Chinese new year cosmetics and all other event cosmetics.
---
Not sure why youre downvoted for the truth
---
Yeah and in some of the remakes. I think Part 3 and 4 as well
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people keep getting down voted for saying this.
---
No new arguments? Ok cool.
---
*‚ÄùFinally! Lady Luck turned a friggin‚Äô face card.‚Äù*

Clever
---
I agree i love that moment had a game the other day where by a series of events we figured out hag had a green mori spawned together didnt mori someone else and i knew it was gonna be used on me since i had metal of man and brought an insta medkit cuz i had new item daily looped for a ruin cleanse and 2 gens new she was saving it for me i never laughed so hard getting moried
---
Thana is useless though :/
---
Myers, Plague and Doctor
---
Haven‚Äòt realized that the skill standards are this low already at rank 7
---
Basically that, a more scarier version of freddy, somethin i can take a bit more serious too. I believe iv heard the reboot freddy(i could be wrong on this ) was cravens real vision of what he really wanted freddy to be.
---
For a 3 gen build you normally only use perks for slowing gen progress and making it almost impossible for the survivors. But you're free to run whatever perks you like or prefer to run. If you want to use rancor then by all means use it
---
I'd rather it just work more than 20% of the time, but if we get both then sure
---
I would pay just to have the flashbulb sound effect somewhere in the game
---
You're kinda right. He originally wanted OG Fred to be a pedo but decided against it because he thought people wouldn't come see the movie iirc
---
I hate those pig players, give us pig players who actually have skill a bad name.
---
Most people view it as a sign of protest against a game mechanic or the other side. Most people in the same match view it as a tantrum
---
imagine being this billy
---
He's got two hands, he needs two beers!
---
I always hated feng‚Äôs scream tbh
---
Amanda,trapper and freddy.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people care so much
---
Patch Notes.
---
*Remodeled Freddy to look like a JoJo part 1 character
---
s a m e 
---
It's such a terrifying sound
---
The only thing that makes it a real camp is if the killer sees me but they wont chase. I get hit.once get far enough and the campers always turn back. 9/10 times its not fun.
---
Cause the reboot fucking suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks and the fact that that specific version of Freddy is a Pedophile
---
Too bad that usually means your team is full of fucking potatoes and they're going to go down in less than 5 mins to which the killer will say "gg" knowing damn well it was a shitty game and they got fed 20k points for no effort.
---
So I never watched any of the movies, but I've been wondering for some time now, since everyone hates the "new" Freddy... what's different about him? They look the same to me, they wear the same glove, hat, striped sweater... or can't I just see it?
---
Mornin' Angle
---
Thanks! It'd be weird if I gave feedback on the game if I've never even played the game before. 
---
A trapper camped me today, but stepped into his own trap when my teammates went to rescue me thankfully. 
---
I have the basic gist of what to do and what not to do; the hardest part for me is just learning the map. One game I ran around for almost a minute looking for the last gen and I can't loop well since I don't know where pallets/jungle gyms are. I wish there was a mode where you could just explore the map. 
---
Thanks for the motivation!
---
Well, you are to blame, btw - you didn't need to run towards the killer while he was chasing someone else
---
Swinging your arms means that it is safe to go for the unhook
---
You dont need to buy the cells. It's cheaper to buy dlc chapter directly from the steam/ps/xbox store.
---
Hello Friend
---
Yay!
---
They're the two killers I've seen played the least...
---
If thats how you do it, you're doing it wrong. Swinging your arms meant camp from the very beginning. It's only over time that people started doing it to say "save me".
---
If you move your arms, I assume the killer is camping and won't come to the resque. You should just wait on the hook for your teammates to come and get you
---
IMO teabagging isn't toxic, neither is this.
---
It's a competitive game, people need to lighten the fuck up. 
---
The only thing that is unacceptable is post game abuse.

---
So? It‚Äôs a videogame
---
Leatherface, Trapper, Myers
---
You missed that if the killer readys up you should instatly DC
---
Lol nice template
---
Aww thank you! =)
---
 I'm working on a better part 2 the original one I made sucked so I'm going to upload the new one
---
Also: he can't chainsaw throug a window if you are fast enough
---
There is a streamer called PsychoScorpionz who mains Pig, watch him play a bit.
---
boy, you must have thick skin if teabags actually get to you
---
Thanks mate. I'm on my way home now so I might have a day playing as pig. I was considering a spirit day.
---
The ultimate punishment
---
&gt; So why cry?
---
He is clearly not crying, he is saying he dislikes the Freddy design, he is perfectly allowed to criticise it without "crying"
---
Still ignored all my other points
---
Don‚Äôt compare me mere mortal killers with the entity herself
---
If you like the game you should.
---
Hahaha as if people use their brains while playing this game
---
Pinhead is up there but to a lesser extent same with Chucky
---
For me personally Trapper. I just hate seeing his face it pisses me off
---
During the original tutorial when the game first came out I SWEAR it made mention of staying in proximity of the hooked survivor was a viable strategy
---
Quite a but actually. If they had gotten the OG License they'd have ALOT more to work with, moveset, powers and cosmetics wise. While the reboot was very limited on what the character was capable of.
---
With devour hope, BBQ &amp; make your choice
---
this is really cute lmao you‚Äôre cute
---
legit warms my heart when people go out of their way to be nice given how toxic online gaming communities can be
---
Dedicated servers are coming :) All killers with bad internet and lagswitchers will no longer ruin game.
---
The dukes !! Solid
---
probably shouldn‚Äôt post things you can‚Äôt credit
---
Yeah, right! That would be stupid, haha ^^^^^^[cries]
---
I only do this when that survivor bullied my ass haha
---
Ok. I'm going to break down all of your points just so you feel good sweetie yeah? 
---
&gt;  It‚Äôs a videogame
---
Yes and he is a licensed character from a movie, it's the equivalent of making Myers without his iconic mask, regardless of what medium the media is in the original inspiration can be called into question if needed.
---
&gt; Not to mention he has no personality in this videogame
---
At no point did op mention freddy's personality, aside from the fact he is now a Pedo not a murderer, they simply stated they disliked the reboot and would prefer original Freddy.
---
You seem to be far more offended than OP here, if you dislike people having a different opinion so much get off the internet.
---
cheers.
---
I think these were all brothers from the same parents and said parents where also brothers
---
Yea I main killer and only hit survivors on hook when they bullied me haha
---
I'm pretty excited for that :D
---
Instead of saying "not my art."

---
Ash's meme scream is basically a perk. You can't hear any injured survivors for about 30 seconds after hooking him with the ear piercing **"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"**
---
Chill i took a screenshot a while ago so i dont remember where i got it from and im not trying to take credit or anything.
---
Bro I know this is off topic but is Mathieu a boomer? He acts like one on his Twitter lol.
---
Fresh meme
---
With Anne frank as survivor
---
That‚Äôs not how I‚Äôve ever interpreted arm swinging.
---
Arm swinging to me creates a sense of emergency, like ‚Äúkiller isn‚Äôt here, now‚Äôs your chance to unhook me‚Äù
---
Not swinging to me is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bother coming, killer still here‚Äù
---
Dio's Mori is RODA ROLLA DAAA
---
Usually I wouldn't like this since it looked like you were proxy camping, but all survivors were in the basement, so there is nothing I can blame you for
---
I use surveliiencs, nurses , BBQ and rancor
---
When I see someone unhook their teammates when I‚Äôm RIGHT there before even letting me leave, I down the dude who got unhooked, go down the person who unhooked them, bring them back to the person they unhooked, and tell them to heal them, then I down them once the unhooked survivor is healed and I let them run away simply because that‚Äôs the one thing that I hate most about playing survivor is THAT happening
---
I don't get the Freddy one.
---
Who said who was toxic lol? Also what a bunch of perk load outs to go against. Rip.
---
Derank
---
In Identity V, camping is a "strategy" so it is even worse.
---
Yes, I've learned a lesson.
---
What pisses me off even more is the guy that is probably going to report me just ignores me, even when I sent him proof I was tricked.
---
I think quitter's bonus is Brutality.
---
Hooked point score is still awarded, since they dc on the hook during sacrifice animation (200 points), sacrifice complete is 200 points. Quitter's bonus is 625. So you trade 200 sacrifice complete point score for 625 Quitter's bonus. Assuming you aren't capped out on brutality, that's 425 more points than you'd have via finishing the sacrifice.
---
I am not completely sure, I know for a fact that the game does count the hook towards your in-game hook score (at red ranks I think it requires 12 hooks to double pip), I am not certain if it rewards you for a sacrifice.
---
If they just drink a lot of coffee then he's going to be stuck in the dream world
---
&gt;Hooked point score is still awarded, since they dc on the hook during sacrifice animation (200 points)
---
I was talking about DC right before final hook
---
I won't ever downvote you master
---
Ps. Have already linked your post to some of my steam friends about pigs buff , let's make it popular so people can actually get the pig Buffs and her addons change
---
Ah, makes sense.
---
i litterally started playing because of noob3 XD
---
Hopefully nothing of the Creepypasta variety killers
---
Yikes
---
Why would someone NOT leaving the hook mean they have Devour Hope, a perk that only does something if they leave hooks.
---
But that's not what I was talking about, I said "on" death hook. So once they get hooked and the sacrifice animation has started.
---
If you dc before the final hook that's only 250 points more than the hooking action, and you deny a point towards the Devout cathegory.
---
Im sure you‚Äôre slaying mad pussy fam, anyway I wouldn‚Äôt take advice from someone that thinks ‚ÄúI want pig to choke me‚Äù is funny
---
Did they have a whole video on strategies and camping was a part of it?
---
Its amazing but i dont like that anime style on some characters
---
Yo look at that Sombra controller
---
Maybe they could just decrease the gens that need to be done for every person that dcs.
---
Being on death hook means that next time you get hooked, you instantly die
---
I think it depends on your approach. If a survivor blatantly runs up to a killer, and beckons and all that jazz, most of the time it's because there's other people nearby or there's a plan in place. It's the same with clicking flashlights and stuff. Obvious bait is a bad way to get killers to leave.
---
He isn't too good at higher ranks... I would not buy him until they reveal the rework which they should do in a week or so.
---
They were t-bagging and flashlight spamming me non-stop so i called them toxic
---
Idk, I don't bother watching the "help" videos they have in the game. I usually just figure it out on my own, but maybe they did. And it's considered a strategic by many top Chinese players simply because you don't lsoe point from camping unlike dbd.
---
I am only rank 11 would that be okish?
---
Well I was responding to the original reply where it says they leave and go back. The scenario is situational, that‚Äôs why I said NOED or Devour Hope.....
---
Yeah you're actually right, I originally hated swamp, but taking a step back it's not really bad at all, much better than Yamaoka for sure!
---
THE SAME THING HAPPEND TO ME 2 DAYS BEFORE AND I WROTE THIS ON FRIDAYS BUG REPORT BUT NO ONE WRITE ANYTHING TO ME
---
AAAAAHHH
---
"The 3rd key I found in a chest
---
another repost. can't wait for my memes to get reposted.
---
That's not how it works. Yes the entity instantly impales the survivor, but they have to finish the animation for the game to counts them as dead and their icon switches to "dead" skull.
---
Same with moris, the animation has to play out completely before the character portrait switches their status to "dead". If you dc mid animation your icon will show the disconnected status. That saves your pip.
---
Yea, some random teammates sometimes can even sacriface yourself for you &lt;3
---
What is SWF?
---
And this is why I can only play Roblox on my PC, but at least I have something to do to pass the time for this summer.
---
surprisingly I actually didn't get a salt message
---
O' boi, I'd love to read the end-game chat after this game. xd
---
Yeah I agree 100%  would just be nice to be able to get straight into a game. I don‚Äôt mind waiting 5-10 minutes but when I can‚Äôt even get a game at 9pm on a Saturday night it‚Äôs rough
---
I will run back because usually you can tell when another survivor is coming to unhook, or do a gen by the hook for some reason.
---
Thanks for the info.  I just got the 1000 throws trophy and maybe like 3 of those are over 24m.  I already have plat. trophy so I'll probably skip this one.
---
I just got blocked by a group after 4-man Mori-ing them 3-gen doc. One guy was named "mori me doctor" and I only had an Ebony so I wanted to go all the way and get a 4-man with it.
---
They immediately told me (like 2 other solo guys) they were both blocking me via MLGA after the match and I was the most obnoxious killer they have gone against today. Frankly I'm estatic for dedicated servers because these guys are on my "ShitList" and I am looking forward to being matched up with them again, and I WILL show them how much more obnoxious I can be considering I wasn't using a Jigsaw Piece.
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
When survivors have tried everything (dressing the same way and all of them using flashlights to blind me), they can in order to not get hooked, there's a 99% chance they're all still together when no1 gets hooked. And if they leave red scratch marks, click the flashlight in my face and teabag, it's so obvious what they're trying to do. And when I'm 99% sure they're not getting any objectives done anyways, why would I go out into the wild when I know that 1 survivor is on hook and at 3 other survivors are trying to get him out? 
---
It's not camping; it's using goddamn logic
---
F
---
Seriously, what were they thinking.  If it was just 100 downs I wouldn't mind grinding but I think I'll skip this one.
---
but you can't end game pig anymore

Same, it took soooo long to implement, and I‚Äôm so grateful for it.  If it weren‚Äôt for cosmetics idk if I would even still be playing.  Can‚Äôt wait for the new David/Jake outfits.

yeah but I suck as huntress

If they all just ran out you would have gotten 2 max.
---
pls dont play 3 gen doc. sure the build is probably the docs best build but you arent really playing to win. you are playing to make the survivors to give up, so i will ask you kindly to take into consideration that you dont play that build
---
It would be funny, BUT then they should do the same to killers who DC: give points to survivors like they have escaped and I doubt they would.
---
Just derank down to rank 15 or wait for a reset, you can derank fast by slugging and facecamping.
---
I Like How Every Word's First Letter Is Capitalized, It's Honestly A Very Funny Thing
---
And with the EGC, I also open the exit gates for them
---
because rank reset happens. and people don't ever see the traps coming
---
I miss thoughtful Thursday
---
or mabye fun is subjective
---
I only have 2 achievements left: clowns one to down intoxited ppl and the wounded healer one. The worst ones have been the Skilled Huntress and Evil Incarnate (farmed both). I also farmed some other achievements but usually without survivors noticing:)
---
Oh right, forgot that's an option!
---
Yea focus on the totems, I jun NOED and Devour hope on all my killers.
---
I've played against the guy, dudes a piece of shit
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
Maybe some Civilization?
---
So slug em? A survivor going for the heal is a survivor not working a generator. With the slug, you pull at least one survivor off for the heal, and maybe another to instigate a chase to get you off the healer. That means there's only one or two people working a gen, tops.
---
Once you've killed one of the survivors, slugging like this can completely nuke any chance of survivors making progress on the generators.
---
Same, I do run noed and blood warden though. So if people don‚Äôt boop the snoot by the end of the game I go full killer on them.
---
To be fair though, this isn't hating your message, but whenever this happens, just stay around the killer really close for a while. This is gonna be iri for evader cause you're stealthing. You'll also get iri in unbroken cuz the killer didnt down you and I assume you would have escaped. I would also assume that you would have contributed to some gens, which should be a bronze in the least for lightbringer. And I'm pretty sure at red ranks the lowest for safety is 9 emblem qualities. So here you go. You also get a bronze benevolent from the start, so you should be fine.
---
Although, I agree afk killers really ruin the game, but just saying it is completely possible to safety pip when the killer is afk
---
Oh my God this happened to me four games in a row yesterday. It's so fucking annoying.  3 times some survivors dc'd because they got downed in the first couple of minutes. Not even on the hook yet! The other just dc'd at the very start of the match.
---
If a survivor is spamming crouch they are trying to make you upset, and for a lot of people that visit this sub, it works really well!
---
Don't act like killers can't BM, because they can and do. I love trying to make survivors upset simply by looking straight up and QE spinning.
---
sadly yes it is :(
---
Agreed, ive never played a game until DBD where players would messages me after the match toxic shit
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs sarcasm, but that‚Äôs fine if you do. I‚Äôm not saying I always spend the game just cleansing totems, but I was saying situationally if I suspect a certain perk I‚Äôll cleanse totems? Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted and such for that.
---
If this is recent im like 99.9% positive hatch will prioritize near a player or killer. Just something that became something super noticeable lately with end game. Idk y tho :[
---
Woth a rework coming I'm not so sure about that
---
it does not look like you were tricked xD. You agreed to farm and you were even talking with him during the match LUL
---
Nah. If you do the 3 gen right they‚Äôll never get the gens done. I prefer running Sloppy Butcher to help keep them off the gens.
---
She is sick with whisper, well until SoO drops.
---
The look of ‚Äúwow, youre so good‚Äù.
---
I have bought almost all of the cosmetics for Huntress despite only ever playing Legion, Pig or Survivor.
---
It was in the loading screen tips, yeah.
---
???
---
But.... why play nea then at all?
---
I only do it if it's a Feng, her scream has a pretty high pitch so it hurts my ears :c
---
You should wait untill his rework is revealed.
---
Cus some days, I get dailies for her, and I'm just like

Noed on billy smh
---
You can't see them in-game, but they exist on the Steam store. They aren't like loot boxes, they're just a cosmetic pack.
---
Legion has trip wires now? Trapper is gonna get jealous lol
---
Just luck of the draw, it gets worse at night. Try to play during the afternoons.
---
Wow OP, this is a really great idea. I like this idea a lot because there‚Äôs a potential for altruism points for survivors and the killer gets his points for hooking/sacrifice, but also the disconnecter gets a punishment.
---
Sure, if you sell your life to the game EA style
---
Ik weet het, wat een vervelende figuren
---
Hiding in tall grass all game instead of doing objectives?
---
It‚Äôs the glitch when you see the dbd loading symbol even though you are in a lobby but it‚Äôs not textured so it‚Äôs using the default texture. No idea what causes this or why it sometimes happens though but I do know is you need to restart the game cause you won‚Äôt load into the match
---
I got a 4 man as Freddy in rank 1 with no perks,add-ons or offerings
---
It seems to be the MorezPack, considering the yellowish color

---
My point it works both ways and people downvote because sub reddit dbd only favors killers and what there needs are..
---
Maybe if you only inherit slightly nerfed perks. 
---
Example-if they have lv 3 you get lv2 and lv2 you get lv1.
---
(Although that could get a bit convoluted lol)
---
Houden jullie ook van Plopkoeken?
---
I got like 5 tufts and hair and 6 tombstones in like 3 days in my Michael, along with many scratched mirrors and shattered glasses, guess I‚Äôm just lucky
---
who says they're not doing objectives
---
It is odd though.
---
Ik ben meer fan van Stroopkoeken en Smoeltjes, maar Plopkoeken zijn ook lekker
---
Wait, I recognize your voice. Were you in FYA Qu√©bec?
---
... David?
---
True true... I wish I could confidently run different perks like small game, but I feel like I need meta perks to get anywhere in the match... I dont know how many times ds has saved my ass since the rework. Rank 5 survivor is rough
---
Honestly depends on what‚Äôs your style and taste, and what you think looks good. If you want to donate to a good cause then the charity case is definitely the way to go, you can also wear your streamers and youtubers cosmetics!
---
but he could be m o r e scary

Hell yeah
---
the past 5 games i've played ive seen ruin break in around a minute, i almost have thanataphobia at tier 3 as well any other perks you would reccomend? im using Spirit fury, sloppy butcher, bbq, and thanataphobia now. Thanks for the advice!
---
Sounds like a good match  :)
---
Im pretty sure farming like that is bannable aswell.... so you never were safe agreeing with it in the first place....
---
I'm waiting until is rework or maybe just get him now and start putting point into him so he has addons and perks once the rework comes out. Because everyone is gonna be playing freddy lol
---
I mostly just want some shit that looks good. I would probably buy the Charity Case for that reason, cause some of the killer items are pretty baller.
---
Stay groovy!!
---
Dishonor on your whole family for noed on a billy!! Lmaooooo
---
Is it? I've gotten into (never started) farm matchs and never had a problem. Never heard of it being bannable.
---
To be fair, on release she was the most quiet female survivor. They bumped her sounds up.
---
‚ÄúA little easier‚Äù lol. It ruins the entire game. Comms gives you like 10 perk slots essentially plus the communication factor. You three stay on gens killer is on me. You two stay on gens I‚Äôll go for the unhook. Etc. etc.
---
Oh i know, the cosmetic prices are ridiculous though.
---
Welll he ain‚Äôt wrong
---
Bodyblocking to prevent a hook is not toxic. Also, there's literally a perk to counter it.
---
for the first point. they are no longer making perks that differ in use between tiers (look what they did to Ruin, BBQ, Devour, Balanced Landing, Noed...) and ffs you have mad grit.
---
REEEEEEEEE GIVE ME THE UNHOOK FOR FREEEEEEEEE BAD KILLER BAD KILLER
---
Have you heard of mad grit its pretty much a Balanced Version of the Perk that you want.
---
Except better teammates on average.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAnbDJd1VRk here's your context.
---
Most dlc can also be obtained for free. Why would they try to make less money then their competition
---
Play with ur friends those are the best and most fun teammates.
---
Stars with Feet
---
Borrowed time doesnt need a nerf... dont camp and it wont activate it last 15 seconds..
---
Honestly we just need DC penalties...
---
DC? You lose 1 level of one of the perks you had equipped for that match.
---
I agree this looks beautiful
---
No evidence to the contrary.  Last thing anyone knows about this survivor is that they were hiding in grass.  Nothing else is known about them.
---
YOU WERE CAMPING THAT'S WHY YOU GOT A 4K, NOT BECAUSE WHY SUCKED AS SURVIVORS
---
Im from Qu√©bec yea, but no my name is Chris and the orher one in the vids is Martin
---
This is pretty regular for people who play pig.. why are people so stupid?. Let's chase the person who isnt doing gens as opposed to someone who is.. the traps are there to slow the game down.
---
And here we have a 4 pack of potatoes.
---
Not so lucky actually. Ever since the end game collapse they‚Äôre having the hatch spawn very close to the final survivor if it‚Äôs a case where the hatch hasn‚Äôt already spawned. Like in this case with four gens left.
---
Bruh, tried saving a Dwight from death today by taking a hit for him. He would have made it... if the killer wasn't a tunneling cunt and left me on the ground to go after him. Then the killer let me go because he thought I was farming.
---
I‚Äôm probably the only one that does this, but whenever i‚Äôm listening for an important sound (generators being worked on, injured survivors etc) I always turn my head and put my ear closer to the monitor, even while wearing headphones.
---
Killers is also trapped with entity like survivors. The only difference, that killers enjoy murdering, but they can still get mad, or loose hope. So, actually, thats dont need to be explained.
---
As a killer, anytime a survivor rage dc's I always try to get the other survivors to just have fun and farm with me for the rest of the match and then I let them go. Often times 1 of those survivors will ask me to actually sacrifice them too, so we turn it into a nice time.
---
Considering that literally nobody is stupid enough to just sit in tall grass for the match like you're suggesting, they probably were doing a generator and then tried to hide in the grass and the killer found them. It's really not that hard to assume what happened if you've ever played killer in your life.
---
i like how you went from flopping like a dead fish, to doing an olympic jump
---
In movie, it‚Äôs explained that his favourite was Nancy, and a flashback shows her in there with him painting on the wall. So I‚Äôll assume Nancy was the one who was taken in there most. Also, when Quentin finds the box of Freddy‚Äôs photos in there, they‚Äôre all of Nancy.
---
I learned Hag just so I can use that new gold outfit because I like to see my phantasm pop up and nod at it. 
---
Same reason I play doctor. Those illusions look so stylish.
---
I‚Äôll hsomethingate it to death if they use Casino-Like visuals for it. Flashy colors, animated bullshit, and overall ignore the tone of their game to make it more Arcady and ‚Äúpalatable‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôll love it if they somehow manage to fit it lorewise into the game (the free version of it,  IE: ‚ÄúAs the Survivors lapse into tedium, their minds wander, bringing up memories of the past, and desires never known. Desires that The Entity makes reality without a passing thought.‚Äù ,) with accompanying stylization adherent to the games current aesthetic.
---
Should it be the other way around?
---
Save The Best For Last + Rancor is a really nice combo for her, especially now, with Mettle of Man being meta.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel + Sloppy Butcher can help you to slow down the game even more.
---
A Nurse's Calling + Deerstalker can help you to slug survivors and put even more pressure on them.
---
Surveillance + Discordance can help you to protect the gens and have map awareness, which is very important for Spirit.
---
You should try these combos on her.
---
On any other killer I'd recommend sloppy, but with legion your m1 is usually your finishing blow so it's not quite as good on him and idk if its worth a perk slot. Nurse's + M&amp;A instead of sloppy and thana is my recommendation.
---
Take everything I say with a handful of salt, I literally just got Legion last night and I'm not very good with him yet. Very fun to play though, for myself and the survs.
---
OK well sure it's harder now as survivors, but 50% of the gates whould be 10 seconds. 10 seconds to open a dor whould make the hatch useless, there wouldn't be any "standoffs" even on extremely fast killers like Billy or spirit you wouldn't be able go get a survivor before he/she opens the hatch, even on good maps. 
---
There is a reason why the devs decided to not shorten the opening times of the gate to 15 seconds. (And this is even more extrem) 
---
These are not the only reasons. When a survivor group isn't capable of doing gens (3 whould be nice) it's not the killers foult and get shouldn't be punished, actually he should be awarded for killing fast. Why should survivors get a free win. This whould make everything just like before the update when for a patient survivor that knows what he/she is doing always escaped through the hatch. (I'm talking out of experience, it's impossible to catch a survivor witch patience like i was at the time.) As someone who plays survivors and killers on red ranks this is **my** opinion, you are free to have yours.
---
Can we have the Entity end game kill animation for DC‚Äôs?
---
I think it would make a lot more sense than the survivor just falling down dead, and it takes time to complete so people can‚Äôt just dc so hatch instantly opens for their friend
---
I personally say yes because you can have fun with him and people, esp,on console can often potato against him.  If nothing else, Blood Warden is a fantastic Perk with the Endgame Collapse mechanic in place to teach to all of your Killers
---
I understand what you mean but that would be next to impossible to balance. Making them too close together makes it too easy for the Killer, but making them too far apart makes it too easy for the survivor unless you‚Äôre playing Nurse (then it‚Äôs probably GG either way - if they‚Äôre good). I‚Äôm pretty sure that gate spawning is RNG based, so it‚Äôs basically a gamble on whether you‚Äôll escape or not.
---
Happy in pink
---
"Wtf why were you camping bad killer"
---
False, a real Dwight main would never get out of the locker
---
I usually watch Hyprid and No0b3.
---
Runningman37 is a funny killer main. Good community and seems like a cool dude.
---
It's the same every time. You down someone, hook them and see scratchmarks everywhere. Someone flicks their flashlight at you, then starts running towards an infinite.
---
How stupid do some survivors expect killers to be?
---
if you get basement hooked , and huntress decides to camp it, its pretty much game over
---
Lobbies crashing like that is NOT due to slow loading PCs, just yesterday I got 2 crashes on the loading screen myself and a while ago I played no mither squad with 3 other guys, we had s couple of infinites as well and guess what, none of us has shit hardware either.
---
I experience infinite loading screens no matter the circumstances, whether I am alt tabbed, in the steam overlay or just staring at the loading screen. I even had a game just yesterday not load and just end cause 1 guy either DCed mid loading like a bitch (highly unlikely) or he got an infinite loading screen/crash.
---
&gt;m-must be your PC!
---
I only run off an SSD and even my friend with a very low spec PC doesn't have issues with loading in the normal time it takes. You know what, that all a-fucking-side, infinites usually occur right at the start, maybe a couple seconds into the loading screen so people's PC performance or drive performance really doesn't play a role at all. In the most recent patchnotes it even says that they "fixed" a bug causing players to lose network connection and not load in during loading screen, but it's clearly not fixed since it's still happening. I've yet to get a loading screen that's frozen but I can still alt tab back to it, at least since the most recent update, still the game will randomly decide to crash during the loading screen and just hold up the other guys/end their game and you're left to figure out your game's not responding after waiting for a bit and not realizing it ain't loading.
---
I had this happen last night. I had 2 DCs, a hook suicide and a survivor die on their first hook, all because every single time id hook one and turn around id see another survivor doing a shitty job of hiding and waiting for me to leave. They didnt do a single gen, played  altruistically the entire time, then cried at the end and called me a camper.
---
EGC, worst-case
---
you'll never kobe again
---
Damn that was so satisfying to watch
---
My favorite‚Äôs no0b3 but some people think he‚Äôs toxicj
---
Zubatlel is amazing killer+survivor
---
Cool ill check him out. I've heard that word tossed around a lot in this community.
---
He used to be, I've watched his streams recently, dudes changed. His chat is annoying as fuck though. It's just constant annoying messages and non-funny meme after non-funny meme.
---
He‚Äôs more of a streamer but he said on stream the other day that he‚Äôs gonna start posting more on youtube
---
DBD in a nutshell.
---
well i wish this was the case for me. i dont mind going against billy , on my end it's 95% nurses games, which is pathetic and honestly it's not even DbD. DbD is about chases , which are ignored by nurse's completely broken mechanics , ignores all the fundamentals, structures , tiles etc. so you are FORCED to play hide n seek, which is unfun and straight up boring. at least with billy you have good chases, you will only get dropped by a chainsaw if you make a mistake, which is going to happen eventually, but at least theres the chasing part and overall fun
---
/r/leagueoflegends
---
Wait, how do you know who the killer is before the match even started?
---
Farmer John makes me laugh.
---
Camper
---
Puppers and FunGoose
---
I believe the in-game disconnect has 2 versions for this reason. If someone manually disconnects it plays the death sound but a crash or something it's silent. Not sure if it works for an internet outage though.
---
I think he did a video with monto recently or am i wrong?
---
I like Cahlaflour and HybridPanda. They have pretty likeable personalities and are generally very chill.  
---
I also enjoy watching a smaller streamer known as SarcastiKelly. She's very friendly and wholesome. Probably my personal favourite of the three aforementioned.  
---
Stay away from this one guy known as TrU3Ta1ent, unless you enjoy watching a man-child with an extremely inflated ego who complains about literally every single thing in DBD. The man can win a match and still whine. He's an all around draining character to witness. Of course, if this is the kind of content you enjoy watching, I won't judge. I just feel that it's important to mention, especially since someone earlier recommended him, going so far as to calling him "all around good folk." He is not, has seemingly never been, and you should know that before even thinking about checking him out.
---
Cool, ill check him out.
---
Yeah he occasionally colabs with Monto and Puppers
---
Why doesn't BHVR just get rid of the leave button altogether. So like the only way they can quit is dashboard/ALT-F4.
---
This does seem like a solid idea. I like it applying to killer as well if they DC. They are still in the game but with an indicator that they have DCed. Remaining survivors can finish any remaining gens, look for chests and totems, and farm off the afk killer. However, the killer can not re-take control over them after DCing as that would be dumb. They simply can‚Äôt create a new lobby until that existing game is completed. EGC would prevent it from going on forever as eventually someone is going to open a gate.
---
playing spirit as killer is like those little wheels on a  bike when you are learning to ride it. mind games consist on : standing still. literally anyone can do it. you dont need to know a whole lot about playing killer, if you play spirit you will get kills regardless.
---
Although these guys are suggesting Thanatophobia, its a really poor perk in my opinion. 
---
Thanatophobia at max slows everything down by 16% when everyone is injured. 16% extra on a gen is 12.8 seconds. 16% extra while healing is 2.36 seconds. The impact it has while having all survivors injured is negligible and in my opinion a wasted perk slot. 
---
A good ruin skill check at tier 3 will waste 7 seconds on a gen (4 seconds for the 5% regression and 3 seconds for pausing the gens repair progression after the skill check). Although ruin is much riskier, its significantly better than Thanatophobia. 
---
You could instead go for a more useful perk like Enduring to make good use out of Spirit Fury. It can work amazing on Legion as a survivor stunning you with a pallet can not only allow you to charge Spirty Fury, it can allow you to do a normal M1 on the survivor straight after they break the pallet.
---
Sloppy is a good option on Legion as you do not want the survivors to heal as you want to only hit healthy survivors with Frenzy. Survivors will take longer to heal which indirectly slows the game down and can allow you to make better use of Frenzy without relying on survivors healing before you can find them again. It also punishes Self-care by adding an extra 8 seconds to the timer, making self-care take 40 seconds to complete. 
---
If you want a more reliable alternative to Ruin then Pop goes the weasel is your answer. It's very good for defending specific gens or taking out gens that have nearly been completed. The added bonus of using Frenzy to gain more distance can allow you to travel to further away gens to make use of the perk. 
---
I would recommend with Legion;
---
Spirit Fury, Sloppy Butcher, Enduring &amp; BBQ - Very strong build that allows you to eat through pallets and get double hits really easy while sloppy works for forcing survivors to choose between leaving themselves exposed or healing which wastes time.
---
I personally use;
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy - I do not have Spirit Fury nor Enduring so I cant make use of that combo. Ruin helps waste time at the beginning of the match for me to start applying pressure. M &amp; A helps me get closer to survivors before using frenzy to make better  use of it against groups of survivors and BBQ allows me to track better. Sloppy also works as a side to ruin for keeping the game.
---
Yeah, he was the one I was talking about. He got a 2K in a Legion match and in chat I suggested what he could‚Äôve done to get a 3K. But instead of listening he said ‚ÄòoH lEt Me LiStEn To YoUr WiSe WoRdS,‚Äô being sarcastic for no reason. Huge ego, and yeah a man child for sure.
---
yea it was just different colored t-shirt :/

What was the post-game chat like

I was just trying to make a joke friend. I wasnt legitimately trying to justify his behavior, believe me I hate this as much as everybody else

---
Puppers is fun!

---
Maining Jeff has made me realize that I don‚Äôt give a fuck about being effective. I care about being an immersed P3 Claudette or running effective builds. I do wish they‚Äôd fix his breathing because even just walking around he‚Äôs so fucking loud. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs good or bad though, because I love his voice but it‚Äôs the complete opposite of stealth.
---
It is in the US. A majority of PS4 DbD players are US based.
---
Monto is the best IMO.
---
Noob3 makes better editing, but all in all is not as entertaining as monto.
---
Farmer john is pretty fun to watch too.
---
On twitch i often watch streamdad_ as well, he's not very good, but all about positivity, and sometimes i need to wash the toxicity away.
---
I like all of it except the re enter part, feel like that‚Äôs going to get abused
---
Would this apply for killers also or just survivors?
---
Coosturd If you want to watch one of the best huntress players in the world. He's also super chill even if he wins or loses
---
Morf is usually my go to all around nice vibe and community. I watch Jendenise (Survivor), ScottJund (Killer), and ZubatLEL(both) but a new viewer might not understand their humor/sarcasm and get butt hurt if they personally main the other side. I'd give them a chance though since they are very entertaining to watch.
---
Camping is a strategy in DbD too, of course.
---
Can we stop for a second and appreciate MaA on huntress?

[**JOOJ.**](/intensifies)
---
Jokes aside I really hope that Behavior manages to rework Freddy in a way that he's fun for everyone but still maintains a similar playstyle so Freddy mains don't have to learn an entirely new Killer. (COUGH LEGION COUGH) Note that I **don't** want to keep most of Freddy's "core mechanics" (time to fall asleep, waking up with skill checks) which might make a "faithful" rework hard.
---
We'll have to see what they do is all I can really say.
---
That still seems dumb of the killer honestly. A survivor getting unhooked doesn't mean you lose the game, but chasing a survivor a little bit, hitting them once, or ignoring them altogether for just one hook is kinda dumb.
---
Even out of SWF I still think it's a good strategy to initially TRY and beckon the killer away from the hooked survivor if it seems like they're camping so someone else can go for the save.
---
If you as a killer are THAT paranoid of the survivor getting unhooked you will never get anything done.
---
Legion Undertale hitting you with their Joey Blaster.
---
I only got the joke when I got to #5 lol
---
I hope that's it. Maybe it'll pick up later.
---
Yep! YouTube and twitch. Puppers on both!
---
1. So what? Who says pipping=winning?
---
2. Camping could be an educated guess based on thinking survivors are close
---
3. You dont lose points if theres survivors nearby
---
More like why not plague who is the oldest
---
ZubatLEL by far
---
Yup. Once you see a trap you just dead hard through it like "miss me with that gay shit"
---
Love matches like this, make me laugh a lot and it breaks up some of the intense ness of other matches beforehand.
---
I love monto, he always has a new build I can try out with killers. Its fun when I get to play most of the day and use his builds
---
That would be a paragraph. Ash for an example is a paragraph character, leather face is a paragraph. So when they say ghost face is the next chapter that means it's killer, survivor, map. This isn't the first rodeo where the killer is known but not the survivor or map. We just gotta wait!
---
Why the fuck did they *both* go down to the basement? And why didn't anyone have Borrowed Time you were essentially camping there so BT would've saved them a lot of trouble.
---
But honestly the basement in general is way too hard to escape from if the Killer is hard patrolling, especially on maps with longer and tighter staircases. Ironworks of Cuckery have the cancer loop but if the basement is in the main Ironworks building and you camp you can easily down both Survivors when they try to exit the basement.

I mean, it's not the worst idea, but this would mean that players with more characters unlocked / leveled up get way more disconnects before they are locked out of playing. This doesn't seem like a good solution. Just lock them from joining ANY game for 30 minutes. And then 1 hour if they disconnect again. And so on.
---
Force people to spectate if they dc. Also lose bp from their bank. Each time they dc they have to wait longer before playing again. 10 min, 30 min, 50 min 2 hours etc.
---
Could you explain how you think being able to rejoin a game you‚Äôve disconnected from would be abused?
---
I started watching that show last night and I must say it‚Äôs pretty awesome
---
I don't understand people's obsession with pipping when queue times in Red Ranks suck ass and there's no actual reason for getting that high.
---
Its definitely not just you. Not sure if there‚Äôs a drop in popularity or they‚Äôve screwed up wait times but it‚Äôs a painful wait time recently for a game. Also been playing since console release and even back in 2017 it was easier finding a game than now which is suspicious.
---
Wrong flair
---
Dude, it‚Äôs seriously amazing. I just finished watching it for my second time, no regrets. Enjoy!!
---
I don't see how an entirely factual statement in response to your trying to command me on what to do makes me psycho but that's fine.
---
Might be your connection.
---
Yes definitely
---
You've never seen billys hair floating across the map?
---
I don't think anybody said pipping = winning. The objective is obtaining a high score, as is inherent in nearly every game.
---
Camping is *a* strategy in DbD, but not necessarily a good one.
---
Most of the time killers have some kind of aura reading perk. There's a good chance you know if there's the possibility of a survivor being nearby. If you're unsure, you should be checking gens. Survivors aren't gonna go anywhere if they aren't working gens. 
---
If you know they'll hover around the hook, try slugging a time or two; the rescuer(s) will practically throw themselves at you, ensuring at least 2 survivors aren't working gens.
---
Found a game within 2 minute as survivor, pog
---
There *was* two people in the basement, so altruism was to be expected. If 2+ people are in the basement you should probably patrol
---
When you try to bodyblock for a team mate to be able to escape but the killer has NOED
---
I am Survivor main but only play Amanda as killer. My pet peeve with her is when other pig killers go after unhooked players with traps on their heads. I never do that.   I feel Like the entire point of the traps is to keep the survivors busy and not doing gens and it‚Äôs just bullying to down them while they‚Äôre stuck trying to get a timed trap off of their head.  
---
Exception to this rule is if you‚Äôre a teabagger or you flash a flashlight in my face for NO reason whatsoever. No more fun and games at that point, it‚Äôs death time.
---
(reposted because of a small little mistake)
---
It would have been better leatherface, Hillbilly is still able to make pressure.
---
Patrol is just a fancy word for camp.
---
Nein
---
Nah that's part3 
---
But instead he picks you up and blast you with his vampire laser eye beames
---
Or, and here's a thought, maybe he doesn't deserve a kill if he played awfully all match and absolutely has to camp in order to secure one? Like, if you can't get a kill as Billy (or even any killer for that matter) before 4 gens have been completed because you're not putting enough pressure on the survivors and/or are not kicking gens, you have failed as a killer and don't deserve a kill in which you camp. "I played shitty, but I still deserve this kill so I'm going to camp even though this is my first hook all game."
---
why are you gay?
---
Yeah it is, but I told you it was probably the most strategic choice at the moment. I don‚Äôt condone camping most of the time but sometimes it‚Äôs the best thing to do
---
Is it the official date ? 
---
I can‚Äôt wait !!
---
Because if the killer catches you, you could just dc and wait til he‚Äôs on someone else to join back
---
Kittychipz!!
---
"Being handed a 4k" even that doesn't let killers pip, btw. Killers have to go out of their way to sort of farm just so they can be able to pip once. Survivors have it easy points wise.
---
Nope, you're in tier two for the rest of the game unless you tier up to 3, after which you'll come back down after a minute on base duration. Addon's can bump that tier 3 timer up by ten seconds per rarity increase.
---
(P.S, each survivor has 10 seconds worth of 'stalk' on them and a base tier up from 1-2 and 2-3 without addons takes 5 seconds. This means you can tier up about 8 times per game, one of which will be spent on going from tier 1 to 2, the rest are there for you to get to tier 3. Happy stabbing.)
---
Ya you can only stalk a survivor so much until you can‚Äôt get anymore energy from them, and ya it never goes back to tier 1
---
So the redder they are the less Evil Within you can get from stalking them, and there will be a point where stalking won't fill up your bar (so you'll have to pay attention a bit but you'll kinda know cuz they get REALLY red)
---
And you are correct; when you get to Tier 2 you are in Tier 2 for the rest of the match :)  You only fall out of T3 (unless you have the add-ons to prolong it!)
---
But this idea proposes that your survivor stays in the trial, meaning that you could still be sacrificed when you DC, so this concern is already dealt with, regardless of if you disconnect when chased isn‚Äôt it? If anything, disconnecting mid chase would just make an easier kill for the killer.
---
This.
---
Meh, if DC'ed survivors still give audio cues you can easily find them even if all 4 DC, not much to worry about, put them on a hook one after the other, close the hatch after the third for extra points and move on.
---
As for evil within, i wouldn't mess with it. It will be drained quickly anyway and then offer no bonus to the killer.
---
No, that's only during Christmas
---
Yup I see that
---
One player disconnected as soon as the match started, we didn't do much but it frustrates me how he bailed right before i could've used Deliverance, i looped the killer around the shack for a long time , enough for him to recover but he didn't even try .
---
Oh god that sucks I feel your pain man lol RIP
---
Why would it be dumb if a killer could get back in to a game after he DC'ed?
---
Why should he be punished for as long as the toxic 4man SWF decides?
---
Very true, but I like it the other way round too. It sometimes happens where the game just went so quick, all 4 escape without pipping and that‚Äôs also a win since ranking up fucks you over
---
but it also means he puts on black face then
---
Rip all my Jake, Meg, Ace, Feng, Dwight, and Adam cosmetics once mechanic David comes out
---
The huntress disagrees
---
I also had DS so i think i could've easily found the hatch , oh well.
---
No0b3, Monto, Farmer John, Ussylis
---
Credit the artist. If you can't find the artist, reverse Google search it. Still can't find the artist? change your title to find out who it is
---
Well considering you can‚Äôt play without playing ranked, they should just treat it like every other ranked game. If you leave early you get an abandon penalty to your rank and something like -50% exp/money earned. It works in other games so idk why not in this. Also I can‚Äôt speak for all games but I know that at least in Overwatch, if you leave matches consistently the wait time gets higher and higher. I got it up to 18 hours on my smurf once, never pushed it past that. However they would probably need to add a casual playlist if this were the case
---
Why were you using stalking speed addon with Scrathced Mirror Myers?
---
One version is probably just the Alt+F4. Making a difference for a crash or intentional DC usually ends up making the penalty useless because the people who abuse DC will just make sure to DC in a way that doesn't have a penalty.
---
I cannot unhear the narrator's voice describing the perks now. Dang.
---
now if he only streamed consistently :)
---
Insulting AND teabagging, not insulting IS teabagging, but yeah teabagging is pretty damn insulting and rude, so hard disagree.
---
Unlucky dude
---
I love how you literally resort to shitty insults when you have been trumped easily, you lost this debate bud the whole reddit community knows your a toxic whiny bitch. Take your sad pointless existence and go on your hiatus from the game,the reddit and the rest of the internet. We will all enjoy the reduced amount of stupidity when you‚Äôre gone.
---
I agree. Murder is more "fanciful", so to speak, when it comes to fictional violence. Most of us aren't likely to know someone who's been murdered, in general. 
---
Sexual abuse is a much more "real" horror, which while it helps to make Freddy creepier, doesn't really make him *scarier*. It kind of turns him from the master of nightmares to some burnt-face pussy who's ass I want to kick.

Oh ok I was thinking that the dc‚Äôd survivor lays on the ground like they do now

I enjoy pineapple on pizza
---
From what the sound of his post it semms like he was watching angry pug.
---
Ok thank you!!!
---
Interesting, will have to see if i can watch his twitch VODs, or maybe catch him live.
---
Hard to believe a person can be that different on another platform.
---
But at the end of the day i'll probably still enjoy his videos on youtube even if he beheaves like a dick on twitch, but good to know.
---
Alright thank you so much!!!
---
If you don‚Äôt watch KYRSp33dy you‚Äôre missing out
---
This is solid. Needs to be implemented.
---
That's what I always run, gives you that GOOD moonwalk. Oh and I guess its easier to walk around while seeing auras, too.
---
you think it's an asshole move for someone to press ctrl to crouch in a video game. ok buddy
---
Ok thank you so much!!!

Legion likes pineapple on their pizza.
---
I never understood this whole dc thing. Sometimes it ends my game if someone DCs while loading, which causes me to lose my offering which is annoying when I‚Äôm using a purple or green. Sometimes it loads me in with only two teammates listed and only 4 gems to pop. Also annoying but better than losing my offering and gaining no BPs I guess. The worst though is instant DCs at the start, which I see a lot in the lower ranks (people that smurf, play too well, need to drop rank is probably a big contributor) or when someone gets downed in the first minute and DCs. I think they should just make it so that if someone DCs in the first 30-60 seconds it just pops a gen. The killer still gets points for the DC but does not lose points for the gen popping. That way at least you don‚Äôt get screwed when a SWF all DC immediately. Losing all 3 teammates and needing to repair 5 gems is fucked
---
standing there and staring at a hooked survivor is still only 1 survivor being kept busy especially if the others are smart. Chasing 1 survivor while another goes for an unhook and heals them is minimum 3 survivors off a gen, this is where you being a good killer matters, because if you are effective at the chase, you should hopefully either be downing, or wasting pallets with that other survivor. Repeating the process, if all survivors are around the hook, then start downing them, focus more on going for the survivor(s) around you rather than protecting the 1 you have on the hook at all costs.
---
But Boyfriend's memo helps you more by having a large lunge
---
Puppers is boring... he legit says the same thing every stream and if you wanna request him to play killer you have to give him $10... which is insane....
---
A win without perks is still pretty impressive against that lineup, since they're obviously not fresh 15's. 
---
But I'm sure it pales in comparison to all of *your* perkless victories.
---
Comments like this are divisive and unnecessary. People like you are what cause further problems within this community. Always turning it into "the other side." Get over yourself.
---
To be fair op is playing Scratched Mirror with no Ruin and they didn‚Äôt even used a map offering for Lerys or The Game.
---
^your ^flair ^= ^my ^reaction
---
Why does Adiris have an afro
---
This isn't even a SWF issue. People do this all the time, and it annoys the crap out of me
---
I can't believe you're still on the map after hooking me **you fucking camper**
---
Tatum is my favorite Scream character, but I think Rose McGowan's press would likely send Miramax (who'd have to license) in a different direction.  It'd be Sidney...maybe Gale if the Devs really pushed for it - or an entirely new character that promoted the upcoming MTV season.
---
Ash throwing down the palette when the spirit wasn‚Äôt even nearby or picking you up is very reminiscent of how my survivor games go
---
It's not always an intentional DC. Not sure if it's dbd side or my side, but I DC at really bad times, like when um first downed , but I'm as pissed about it as you are.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEpost
---
But hes a rank 1.... I cant
---
Yikes. In all seriousness just don't even bother. Even at high ranks any sort of display of having common sense or strategy is "camp" or tunnel. I've been sitting in red ranks as killer and there is no point in arguing with survivors there. Some folks are just like that
---
Nope only exception is freddy.
---
&gt;maybe he doesn't deserve a kill if he played awfully all match and absolutely has to camp in order to secure one?
---
Who says he played awfully? Like, if he doesn't have ruin and chases a survivor that drops every pallet along his path without looping, they will keep you occupied for a long time. Yes you won't be able to get them soon, but is it worth breaking chase? They're wasting the pallets. If you keep chasing this guy, it is quite possible that 4 gens get done by the time you get him, but I don't think that meant you played awfully.
---
&gt;are not kicking gens
---
Kicking gens is one of the worst wastes of time as a killer. Not saying you should never kick a generator, but unless you have a perk that only takes effect when you kick a generator, it is very common to have matches where kicking a generator is never a good option
---
&gt;you have failed as a killer and don't deserve a kill in which you camp.
---
You have not failed as a killer yet. If you get a kill simply by camping after 4 generators are done and all other survivors haven't been hooked yet, then it is the survivors who fail
---
&gt;"I played shitty, but I still deserve this kill so I'm going to camp even though this is my first hook all game."
---
If you get a kill at this point without NOED, you deserve it, even if it is by camping.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that. She makes some great characters though. You know if the new MTV season still gonna have the original movie mask like they said a while ago?
---
Might explain why all my games when I started playing as a survivor with a friend led to me being facecamped, game after game after game after game
---
Poor squeaky toy
---
No-one is saying to stand there and stare at a hooked survivor blindly.
---
As I said it's all down to context. For example: You've got one survivor obviously baiting you and no-one showed up on BBQ? Chances are there's more nearby.
---
Also saying "be good in chases" is simplifying it a ton. If someone is going out of their way to bait you they aren't going to run aimlessly away. As I said earlier they'll have a plan in mind. A good survivor can easily loop certain killers for a long time, in the right circumstances.
---
And your last point is agreeing with me. Again if someone is baiting you there's a high chance others are nearby. It's usually best to look for them before doing anything else.
---

---
Never thought about whispers as a counter...
---
Killer main, 700 hours.  When I hook a survivor, I'll head off toward finding another unless I see direct signs of someone else nearby.  Puts pressure on those doing gens.  Low skill survivors mean one or two people already heading towards the hooked person meaning 2 to 3 not doing gens.  High skill survivors, nobody is coming so hanging around would only mean 3 gens pop in not too long.
---
For survivors:. Want the killer to not camp? Don't be seen until the killer walks off, just that easy.
---
I'm pretty sure Funworld owns both the mask and the suit. If you go to their official website, you can buy the mask and the suit as well.
---
Solzec says it makes you lose points, suggesting that you do bad because you dont pip, or at the very least lose emblem points. 
---
It is definitely a strategy and can sometimes pay off, especially if youre good at mixing it up
---
image quality got absolutely crunched by reddit (not to mention the fact it was taken with an iphone) dwight and legion don‚Äôt use instagram, but nea‚Äôs is @tobydeep.
---
then that's not camping. I'm talking about killers who blatantly ignore other survivors even if they're an easy down trying to trade or distract you from the unhook.
---
In that case...Umm..I guess you'll have to step in the traps
---
That's is the intention, I only now realize that how I wrote it makes it seem that way. With the buffed Autodidact, Great Skill Checks wouldn't ever give bonus progression.
---
I pipped to level 17. \o/ It's not much, but I am happy about it. Also, I am almost done with my Claudette. Twenty more levels, and then I can focus on Jane or Ash - Maybe even Nea or Meg. I am still unsure on who to go after!
---
Yikes!
---
I got deranked to 17....if you pay attention
---
Yes. All this. Makes me fucking mad this game has been out for years and nothing has been done.
---
Im about to quit for real. Fucking like this game but it takes like 20 minutes to find a actual good game, and no clue if in that game someone will DC or whatever
---
Fucking bullshit
---
They would all give crows when AFK so it wouldn't be hard to find and sacrifice all of them in a few minutes. I agree it sucks but when does a 4man DC not suck?
---
If you want to farm BP from assholes who DC by getting T3 Michael, more power to ya
---
*rawr*
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not ideal. Just seems the console hype has died down now and decent games that don‚Äôt get cut off randomly or survivors DC constantly üôÑ
---
Ive been watching noob3 and im sold on his content, I've been laughing for over an hour.
---
Lockers counter BBQ without running out, I usually play without relying on teammates in a solo play style, and bond works just as well. Or empathy. Aftercare only works if you get to the unhooked person first.
---
Eh
---
The way to start playing against  would be to load back into the game and finish it, or get sacrificed.
---
Because if the End Game Collapse now, if you get in the game it's easy to force an end
---
Spirit, Myers, Nurse
---
I pipped up to level 17! Pretty proud, since I have been playing alone and going against some tough killers. I am also so close to finishing my Claudette! I don't know who to level after, though.
---
I'm going to Kermit suicide
---
I love this comment so much
---
Yeah exactly, if you DC and you're on the hook, it just means while you are exiting and coming back in you could go into 2nd stage and fail to struggle or you could get sand bagged and put back up. No exploits possible
---
Ah I like this full story üòÅ so they were superheroes willing to die rather than leave their friends!
---
Exact same happened with me yday and it was also a clown. I also got disconnected just like OP.
---
I guess I am lucky that I at some weird rank 6 where I am match with a Rank 10 Trapper with no Ruin and then every survivor has Mettle of Man, with ranks from rank 19, rank 10 and rank 3.
---
It's almost like they are the only viable killers at high ranks... Weird
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Just loaded into a game (again as legion) where every pallet on the map was invisible to me. Survivors would still throw them down but I couldnt see them even if I ran into them. Kicking air while breaking pallets ...
---
All killers need 3rd person moris
---
Honestly, nurse is fundamentally broken with her ability to ignore every means of time wasting a survivor has.
---
Billy could be made more manageable if perhaps, chainsaw downs were harder to get, or his map pressure wasn‚Äôt so crazy
---
Pig, Hag, and Spirit
---
I'm not arguing either way but people have pointed out that Ash was officially referred to as a chapter. 
---
It could be that they're moving away from the word paragraph because chapter sounds more complete. People may be more willing to buy on the word chapter. 
---
Still, hoping for Sidney or Gail!
---
What I'm trying to get across is the game setting me back 1 or 2 pips when quit to desktop from the main menu
---
Outstanding move
---
This is why Micheal was the real OG killer. No matter how fast you ran, he could walk faster than you.
---
It depends on rng really, if both spawn close together you might as well just let him get you.
---
What bullshit are you talking about?  I play both sides but haven't seen something on either side that warrants a dc on my part.
---
It reminds me of the bug that happened sometimes when you picked up a survivor as they disconnected. Where it would make you continue carrying the dc'ed survivor and could hook them for the points. Although you couldn't use your power or anything so if you didn't know it happened you could have problems when chasing other survivors
---
He doesn't even need to be good, just atleast useable.
---
i don't think that i get it...
---
Oh ok. I just needed more clarification. The video didn‚Äôt show it off much :/
---
You saved a friend, dodged a chainsaw, and got some exercise. That‚Äôs a good day!
---
Yeah, given all that. I would be 100% on board with it.
---
I play a lot of survivor so I can tell when someone knows what they are doing at a good time wasting loop and I'll break off if all three others are healed bc that means they are on gens. Even if you can't get someone as soon as you see them it doesn't mean that will always be the case. Some chases are for getting survivors and some are for clearing palleted areas and then you control those areas by watching the gens in them. It's a game of patience sometimes, but camping a gen area with a hooked survivor on the area with no pallets around is bank when you are killer.
---
If it doesn't stay it can't stack, it stacks.
---
Hey, I was a video of a guy in evil within 3 and when he got the survivors he killed them right there instead of bringing them to a hook but when I do it I just 1 tap them but still have to get them on the hook? Did he have a perk or something that let him insta kill them
---
Are you blind? I rank up to 16, exit the game and I am somehow rank 17. If you can't see that you need to get your eyes check quickly.
---
He didn't kill me though, he was being nice to me and let me go, even though he could tell by my actions I was trying to shield the Dwight from a hit... the only good thing I got from being downed was I got a WGLF stack.
---
Ash was called a chapter too, but he came with no killer. The fact they specifically call it "Ghostface reveal" instead of "Scream chapter" should be a good enough reason to assume it's just Ghostface.
---
Burn 2.
---
No hook saves would be beyond broken.  Think about the games balance when making suggestions like this.
---
I was watching this clip like damnnn this dude is a beast, then i realized it was you slime lol
---
The Nea is bad at it because she isn't UEing away
---
There is almost always a lfg somewhere looking for people to play with.
---
Pig is the only killer that can still make me jump out of my skin
---
Omfg I‚Äôm rarted.
---
Wait I‚Äôm confused, what are you even arguing? Survivors have it bad and have the god-given right to DC? I‚Äôm not even sure, but it‚Äôs kinda funny tho how you say it‚Äôs the games fault THEN saying it‚Äôs the baby killers. I prescribe watching less Ochido
---
Your action is still toxic. It doesn‚Äôt matter what somebody else did.
---
Nah, even though you've outplayed two people in quick succession and they were dumb enough to get downed in the proximity of each other, the right thing to do is walk away and pretend you didn't notice survivors around. Just walk away, pretend to find survivors working on a gen even though you know nobody is on a gen. Let them reset the game because survivors gotta escape. Fookin campers.
---
I think it's more of a minor annoyance for me but it could be easily fixed by the devs. I run the same perks mostly as survivor and if you have a perk that has visual feedback (such as spine chill) it just gets annoying having to remember to look at a different slot. It becomes even more annoying when they're all the same colour lol
---
There are two possibilities for how he did this, one specific to Myers and one available to all killers
---
All killers can bring in Moris, which are rare offerings that allow you to kill survivors under certain circumstances.  There are 3 and each will tell you what you have to do to kill them.
---
Myers has two add-ons that allow him to kill survivors on the spot: Tombstone Piece and Judith's Tombstone.  They have small differences but the underlying effect is the ability to kill survivors without having to down them or hook them.
---
Nobody mentioned TydeTyme, and I'm not sure why. He's really chill and has a voice for horror. He's also been playing the game since the beginning so he has a pretty deep understanding of the mechanics. I learn a lot about playing from him.
---
For Clarification, I don‚Äôt think you guys are wrong... at least some of you. I just think you guys need to be a little more optimistic
---
Your "point" doesn't make any sense.
---
You don't normally do nothing when there is danger.
---
I'm in danger so I call the police.
---
There is a fire, so the fire alarm sounds.
---
Batman sees the bat signal and goes to rescue someone.
---
Why would you give a signal to indicate something is not happening? Normally, someone is going to rescue you without this input.
---
*walks menacingly*
---
Why does everyone blame the devs? They literally can‚Äôt do anything about it right now, or else every person who has bad connections would pretty much be perma banned.
---
You're right lol. They do like to push their luck these days thanks to head on being added.
---
I mean to be fair, if the doctor doesn't want you to save someone, you aren't going to he can just sit in treatment mode and spam tap m2 the second anyone even tries to unhook they get insta-grabbed.
---
Don‚Äôt blame them for playing with their friends. Just saying it ruins the entire balance of the game and I‚Äôd say 75% of SWF groups just breathe toxicity. Sucks for the remaining 25% but I understand why killers are toxic toward all SWF groups. And I say that as a survivor main.
---
I really want this to be great dude, but just like this drawing: the back of my mind is creating all kinds of doubts XwX
---
I watch Morf\_UK during the day (US Time).
---
At night AngryPug (I know Reddit hates him, but he's amazing.)
---
Jendenise, ScottJund, PsychoScorpionZ, and EdgarAlanBroLive are my other go to as far as bigger streamers that play at high levels.
---
If you want some smaller streamers to watch, MayorWertz is a nice guy that does a lot of killer.  
---
BeccaSVG and Aquarius\_70 are quite amazing smaller streamers too.
---
I was legitimately getting pissed at my team for hiding in lockers whenever they entered Doc's MASSIVE terror radius. I destroyed Ruins, looped him forever and did 3 out of 5 gens. Game took forever. Then I saw the ranks and it all made sense. Then I wasn't angry, I just felt bad.
---
He‚Äôs the ‚Äúsilent but deadly‚Äù fart. Pig is the ‚Äúsitting on a wooden chair‚Äù fart.
---
I got work but I‚Äôll be off at 6 so I should be on
---
Bubba is the best killer to get because of his perk BBQ &amp; Chili.  
---
If you've already got that, the next best killers to get would be either Spirit or Hag because their perks alone are used on many good builds(Ruin/SF), and they're fun to play.  
---
Then you can pretty much get whoever you want.
---
I think the name is saying trans people aren‚Äôt people and the post is they killed him for being transphobic. Good job
---
A smaller known channel called grimmybear was pretty enjoyable for me; he mostly does survivor I think but hes pretty good and just has fun
---
Hello Amanda
---
If it gets upvoted enough, who knows?
---
I wasn't lookign seriously at first and went like "How the fuck is there so much killers ?"
---
Then I realised that it's just Legion 4 times wich made me think there was more killers than it seems.
---
Perks hag.
---
But imo Myers is far more fun to play.
---
Hag is better overall because she's got a better base-kit and perks.  
---
Myres could be fun, but to me he's just a slightly enhanced M1 killer.
---
They should also just remove the leave game button so that players have to dashboard/ALT-F4.
---
I'd go with Myers.
---
Dang!!
---
What do you think pretending to go find survivors is?
---
Yes. A lot of the achievements that come out with dlcs go with the perks of that survivor that came out with it. For instance, deliverance with escaping the hook 50 times, breakdown with breaking so many hooks, flip flop with wiggling out of the killers grasp 10 times, etc.
---
I'm glad teabagging exists for one thing.  Trashcan Camper killers.  If you camp survivors with gens up, or hard tunnel directly off hook, best believe I'm dipping my nuts at you furiously for being trash.  Typically NOED gamers too because have some self respect man.
---
Same, and worst in my case, the skill checks aren't even appearing, so sometimes the gen just explodes out of nowhere.
---
This is PC and Ingame.
---
Survivor Entitlement Syndrome. Killers only exist as a means for survivors to have fun in many survivors minds.
---
Yeah standing next to the open hatch until you spot the survivor is a tactic that works.
---
I close the hatch as fast as i can though, because i still hate stand offs, and rather take the loss than stand around for minutes doing nothing.
---
What I'm saying is you make it sound like the only way for a killer to win is camp.
---
I watch Noob3 and occasionally Puppers. And let me guess, you used to watch AngryPugs?
---
I killed a transphobic person, hopefully the entity will be proud.
---
Doin' the lord's work, man.
---
NP!
---
What makes myers fun besides the jumpscare build? After tier 2 he's just full terror radius and movespeed, right?
---
Hag has better perks and is easier/more fun to play without addons and crazy builds, but Michael is so satisfying and there is no feeling like reaching tier 3 and hearing the Myers music as you instill fear into anyone within 32 meters of you. He also has some of the most broken and fun builds out there. I personally love both and maimed Michael to P2 before playing Hag
---
Pig is fun to play as a jumpscare killer, not good enough that you win matches easy, but fun non the less.
---
SS remade into There Can Only Be One:
---
You now have the ability to kill one other survivor and take their perks as your own. 
---
Obviously wouldn‚Äôt be allowed because obvious reasons.
---
I censored the name, how can you tell?
---
Unless of course you mean scrubbles, in that case-
---
*yeah that's me*
---
OIs it just me or does the Legion look absolutely gigantic when compared to the people in the back?
---
That's not what I'm saying at all. You're making it sound like the only way for a survivor to win is to have the killer let them win. In reality, the secret to surviving as survivors is to play well.
---
Considering it is literally censored, thanks!
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, thanks for reminding me!
---
I totally forgot.
---
Fucking agree.
---
Just had a game where someone lag switched, lost my 100% bonus
---
This sucks
---
But then you know for sure that they are giving up and they can be banned promptly. If they disconnect, you can never be sure. As they said once the dedicated servers are up, they'll be able to effectively ban people.
---
I really want a survivor.  I don‚Äôt play killer often, and I really only buy DLC for new teachables. I‚Äôm perfecting all my survs rn, just got my Ace to P3 perfect perks.
---
So the killer can only play well as a camper while survivors need the skill, got it. üëç
---
I just love when a killer is chasing me and they go back to the hook because someone just got unhooked, only to tunnel. Then they cry because people DC.
---
I mean, streaming is literally his career. He‚Äôs there to make money off of it so if people are willing to pay to see him specifically play one killer, why not charge for it?
---
Tactical Sandbagging.
---
I hope he gets a rework and do you have any general tips for killers starting with the huntress but so far I haven't been doing too well
---
In all fairness ghostface leaked power is kinda shit; if the devs have changed it to be better in chase I might be more exited but as it stands the new freddy seem's to be more interesting.
---
Don't forget how bad Kate's scream was in the PTB
---
Shit you right
---
Can confirm this is exactly what I sound like.
---
To be honest I thought about doing the Shitpost flair, but these are all suggestions that come from discussions in some streamers channels.  The streamers that BHVR listens to.
---
And they were serious.  So maybe it was "discussion" more than whatever I chose over shitpost.
---
One of those guys is wearing his mask upside down.
---
It seems pretty nice tho to only have to stalk someone for 2 seconds to install down them
---
Honestly I cant decide if i love or hate head on. Like they keep buffing lockers, so they are less useless, and thats good, but also, if survivors are encouraged to be in a position where they waste time, and have to be afraid to stop wasting time, I feel its gonna hurt newer survivors more than this will benefit runner builds at the higher tiers
---
I've had instances where someone unhooks their teammate when I'm only a few feet away.
---
I try and remember to go for the unhooker. Because that's a stupid dick move.
---
I think they said that when dedicated serves are up it‚Äôs going to easier to pinpoint who exactly disconnects
---
I'm not gonna argue with a rank 21 player. All you need to know about this clip is: don't get downed at the basement, don't get downed at basement if your teammate is already at basement, and don't reveal your rescue attempt by making noises right next to the killer leaving basement. And here's a bonus lesson for you, gtfo out of basement as soon as you have the chance. The end.
---
No I made sure to make a point of noting how I didn't say I had trouble with the perk, that was just your dumbass assumptive self believing as such. I like how you've apparently been appointed the spokesperson for all of this reddit to be able to speak for them though apparently. lmao You're more of a village idiot I would say though.
---
And this was never a debate. A debate is a discussion between two equals. You're faaar from being my equal. Hope there's some enjoyment in being inferior for you.
---
So killing yourself intentionally is a bannable offence? Legitimate question as I have no idea.
---

Shes so good and very entertaining to watch.. her commentary kills me
---
[https://imgur.com/KJWKKlV](https://imgur.com/KJWKKlV) I was Ace in this match and damn it was funny (for me, not for the meg)
---
$10 to sit on your ass and play a killer for maybe 10 mins..  it's insane our society is so backwards.
---
I don't think anyone is really complaining about them wanting to make a living off of the game, or saying that they don't care about it (Those license for the killers are probably stupid expensive and it would make more sense just to go the "like X, but Royalty Free"), but there comes a point where they have to take a step back and figure out why things aren't working.
---
If they need a Battle Pass that's fine. Just not in a Paid Game (So it needs to go F2P) or not in a game with the amount of DLC this game has (11 chapters in and counting). If they need money that's fine, but the double, triple, and quad dipping they're doing is ridiculous.
---
I found out that the exit gates still kill trapped survivors if the headgear was activated with a gen. So, I've been saving my traps for when a few gens have been finished, then I start trapping like crazy. Every few games I get lucky and someone tries to escape with it activated. The snap is so satisfying.
---
I was playing Myers and I did absolutely terrible, but the survivors in the endgame chat were encouraging me to do better instead of being toxic. Was super wholesome :‚Äô)
---
David too *wink *wink
---
I like it!
---
Paying to remove cosmetic items (like useless shirts) from your character: [https://imgur.com/gallery/N6beCkp](https://imgur.com/gallery/N6beCkp)
---
Considering Myers is Licensed you can't buy him with Shards. So Myers.
---
I did not know that! *smiles* Thank you!
---
Is this really a surprise considering the gaps of power between the top three killers and everyone else? 
---
Survivors pick the strongest perks, killers pick the strongest killer they know. This is the meta we have had for some time.
---
When you just stare at the exit while they butt dance.
---
I'm glad!
---
I think it is because the whole school and fencing tile which takes up most of the map forces the hatch to spawn there.
---

"Looping Successful, Killer is pissed, tunneling Claudette, commence Tactical Sandbagging."

David became a Legion member
---
If I die to NOED, I won't even care. As long as the person I was trying to protect gets away safe I did my job and I can quite literally die in peace. Especially if I died unhooking them and they make it to an open gate.
---
Pig is pretty fun and has some good perks that you can use on other killers. I would pick her over Freddy as Freddy really needs good perks to be effective.
---
Yknow what, thank you for being civil. This kinda opened my eyes more to that :).  The DLC is fine, the Battle Pass is too much. Though, I would like something to grind for other than Teachables
---
Get your Ash back in the Warframe subreddit!

---
I don't agree with any of what you said, but I loved how you said it. 10/10 made me murr.
---
id take a hit for janes phat ass any day
---
even if its an accident, even the killer looks at you with dissappointment
---
Cute!
---
May i bring up how laurie was when she first released
---
Myers at tier 2 TR is 14/16 meters. Not sure which one, too lazy to google search. 
---
Run Monitor and Abuse and he has practically no TR until tier 3.
---
Zuccatraps
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;But if you think about it, that extends the length of the DCers ban so long term will hopefully discourage DCing enough that it doesn't happen.
---
The guy will just watch some youtube videos while his teammates get screwed. If you were to count him as dead while being in the "DC state", he'd still be banned for the duration of the match.
---
Making the DCd person prevent hatch from opening kinda goes against the goal of Endgame collapse. The reason why there is a timer and why the hatch spawns for the last person regardless of the number of gens left is to prevent long drawn out games in which the one survivor can't possibly win, so they hide for as long as possible while the killer has to aimlessly run around the map looking for them. 
---
&gt; My solution is aiming at preventing DC behaviours altogether
---
In some cases DC-ing is warranted (aka the things I've mentioned)
---
Yeah I agree. It is good that lockers are getting more uses, and it has encouraged survivors to start utilising them. I suppose this also buffs killer locker perks since survivors may actually use lockers more now.
---
Lol
---
Always happy to help a fellow member of the oinking army!

The 31st
---
Switch out thana for Enduring and swing through every pallet.
---
I need to stay off reddit when I'm drinking lol
---
You're not wrong. It's just a shame when there are 15 killers and you only experience the same ones. As you said, it's part of a bigger problem with gaps in power.
---
I will never understand people's mentality that *pressing ctrl* is *toxic*
---
What makes the least sense to me is that Ghostface is even being released. We have Legion, which is literally the non-licensed Ghostface.
---
Its cool toby. Any more?
---
It‚Äôs the concept. 
---
If it were that simple, nobody would press CTRL. People know why they do it and it‚Äôs fairly obvious. 
---
Nobody just runs around and spams CTRL for no reason. lmao keep telling yourself that though. 
---
Good day.
---
Does he still play dbd? Because when bo4 cane out i never saw anymore dbd on his channel
---
Huntress gets free hits whenever someone vaults a window or drops a pallet so always have your hatchet ready when you think a survivor is going to.
---
SWF would ruin that idea. It kind of already ruins Dark Devotion.
---
Numbers /=/ Quality. If only 3 out of the 15 killers stand a reasonable chance to win against top tier play then the remaining 13 killers are drastically underpreforming and need buffs. Top 3 all share a common trait to, good map pressure, ways to destroy or avoid obstacles and the ability to end chases quickly.
---
Freddy is a great example of why stalling type mechanics just don't work as powers in this game, at least not with how their numbers balance out. If you couldn't wake up without a teammate or a generator skill-check, and Freddy could interact with survivors mid dream transition then he would be a good killer.
---
Here's the issue, that would lead to long drawn out games that feel hopeless for the survivor so people would complain and he would just get nerfed back into the ground again. The difference between spirit, billy, nurse and this new "proposed freddy" is that the prior 3 end things quickly so it doesn't feel as bad, cheap maybe but not dreadful and boring. Stall based killers COULD be buffed up to the levels the top 3 are at and in doing so make them competitively viable, but at what cost.
---
So when you complain that there are only 2-3 killers at higher ranks, think of the alternative.
---
 Whispers makes it basically impossible for the survivor to sneak to a door. 
---
Just chill by one of the doors, if whispers is off you go to the other one. Even if you are playing someone immobile like Huntress, they won't be able to open it unless they start opening a door on the other side of the map the moment you close the hatch :D
---
I play both too. Playing killer is a walk in the park compared to survivor.
---
No.. It was sarcastic.. What I meant was...
---
It was my ehh....my accomplice's account.
---
People were paying Scottjund, Zubat and Bahroo $100+ to play 1 match as Legion before Legion was reworked lol
---
People need the /s it seems
---
a'ight enjoy being a sensitive pussy then lol
---
Repost
---
Just disrespect my hag why dont u.
---
I can't see anyone seriously taking any locker related perk as a killer. Unless you are playing huntress and use them anyway ig.
---
Listing BBQ stack as a reason this is nice should clue people in to the fact that damn perk is unbalanced. That plus the stats released last month showing every body using it at all ranks.
---
*sad oinks*
---
This is an epic gamer moment right here.
---
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Are you on console? Cuz it‚Äôs way worse on there I‚Äôve had like 30 minute que times before not even at rank 10 it‚Äôs crazy
---
Srry )':
---
Whose fault is it tho?
---
The killer or... We all know who
---
Can we please get some for Detective Tapp?
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone said that, just that when Hal the team is hooked in one place, it is 100% guaranteed someone will come for them, why not keep half the team hostage and find new survivors while your at it. Camping is normally a bad strategy, but if half the team is there...
---
As trapper, I trap the switches if I know the game is going down to the hatch. Then they either get trapped or I hear the snap and know which switch they are at. Works like a charm.
---
Look sir if he‚Äôs gonna be an asshole to me and my team, I‚Äôm not gonna be a nice guy. He facecamped my bud till literally death on first hook
---
I ran into an irredescent head huntress three times in a row last night.
---
Not for me
---
One time I had this really weird dream where the real culprits told me to go play Civilizations.
---
You can't even play killer in 3rd person, so your cosmetic is basically for everyone else but you unless it's a weapon.
---
Yeah, I actually have had a couple of times where I had Deliverance *and* Mettle of Man active, it sucks.
---
How do you guys even pull it off? I just can't
---
Hag is better than Myers, but you can get Hag with shards, so you should get Myers.
---
Myers with Monitor and Abuse + Infectious Fright can be quite strong.
---
As someone who never buys cosmetics,
---
thank you for your service.
---
Shalob
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work because most killers are blood thirsty and would go for the easy hook, and they do this now with afk players
---
Plus there are fun builds to play as with Micheal for example scratched mirror Myers
---
no, DC may be done. fk those camping and annoying killers.
---
If the reworked Freddy can't tea bag as fast as survivors, I have no reason to be more excited about him than Ghostface.
---
Can you place traps close enough that they can't operate the switches? I thought there was a bit of a deadzone near the switches.
---
Dark Devotion is garbage, so no.
---
Trapper is clearly the Rock
---
Myers because you can get hag for free.
---
Killers can derank even when they kill all 4 survivers üôÇ, if it's made so that if you just complete your objective than you pip I think everyone would be happy.
---
Thanks. -nonbinary person
---
That's delaying the game and reportable.
---
The opening theater scene in scream 2 is the DBD community when the patch comes
---
I always give the last survivor the hatch but they always just keep wiggling :/ I try and hit the walls and stay in one spot but they make my job so much harder so now if they keep wiggling I just hook them but I try
---
It's just annoying seeing people work that hard to rank up and they DC over hex totems.
---
You lose very few points from camping as well; in fact, I often notice that I lost far more points from letting survivors heal when they get away than if I had camped them. So if you care for points, your smartest option is to stay near the hook, but not too near, then don't let the unhooked one get away. Bet survivors don't like hearing that, but t he math is clear on the results screen no matter how much they rage.
---
Tbh I‚Äôm really disappointed that it‚Äôs not all Trapper and Myers as the 2nd.
---
For me, his power is shit because it's not original. It's just a mixture of Pig and Shape.
---
Considering we have fancy entity animations, it can be used to treat the hatch situation easily.
---
As soon as there is 2 survivors left, one of them being the DC, a timer could tick down for the DC'd survivor. Maybe about 10 seconds at the most, in which they're get sacrificed by the entity if they do not connect within that time frame.
---
Could even make a super simple AI that just follows paths to a gen and does nothing but fix generators until it's dead so it actual contributes more to the team than the enraged toxic fanboy behind the keyboard. That will give killers a good reason to kill it.
---
He has borrowed time instead of leader tho
---
Nurse? Would be Sia
---
Holy smokes this is fucking great, you switching in between tabs to play the sounds had me laughing so hard
---
wow look a triggered boi who‚Äôs made is way out of the post game chat! That‚Äôs not supposed to happen!
---
It's a gamble you're either gonna have fun intense games or be put with really toxic people .-.
---
Where's the love for Ghostface? He'll Tbag together with our Pig Goddess.
---
This! Do you think keeping a job is worth it? I might just quitüò≠
---
It's actually not, since there's a definitive end (the timer going down to 0 and the survivor getting killed). The survivor being at a disadvantage does not equal the game being held hostage.
---
Somebody down voted they're a kitty hater
---
I play ps4, isn‚Äôt the hag free?
---
mixing perks is not a solution, and making things ridiculously overpowered is not either. Some perks will only ever get use in very specific builds, unfortunately
---
Well it would be stupid if the killer can DC, which would lure survivors over to farm points off them, and then just reload into the game at an opportune time and down somebody. If they can rejoin the game, the survivors would need to be notified well in advance that the killer has rejoined the game, before they gain control of their character.
---
I‚Äôd had a solid game and wanted to see the final surv get sacrificed by the entity because it looks cool but I got outplayed. Still cracked me up though.
---
That is what I mean. I assume it picks a random tile on the map to spawn on and if it picks that massive tile, it can only spawn in that one location.
---
That would scare the shit out of me as killer if they kept the huge sound they have when the EGC ends
---
Right? My favorite is the rainbow jacket Meg with 1 generator left, who teabags and clicks like mad. What am I, Charlie Brown with the football?
---
Obviously I've watched him dumbass.. how would I know any of this fam??  I think it's hilarious that people are stupid enough to give someone there hard earned money to play a killer match which he isnt that great at!  Runningman37 will play a killer match and any build for fucking free...
---
I feel games that have leaderboards tend to be worse than those without
---
I've been watching 1-2 dbd movies every weekend for the past few months and here's my opinon :D a lot of people hate on saw 4-6 but 5 and 6 are pretty good. Anything you would change? Also I haven't seen scream sequels or elm street sequels so i didn't use em
---
This IS a lot, but who plays every killer? I play 4 regularly and others have OK perks. You dont NEED to have T3 perks on every killer. It's just unnecessary. And if you do want that, you need to put the time in. Not to mention I can get over 100k BP from one game with bbq and a offering. That's like 3 blood webs if you play them smart, and get good RNG. That plus the occasional BPS, it's hard not to get at least all the teachables on your favourite killer by 500 hours on the game. And if you tell me 500 hours on a game is too long that's just 2 and a half hours a day for 200 days, less than a year. You only NEED all the perks on who you play, and that is only, what did you say? Like 171? That's not all that hard. Also this doesn't account for the fact that the chances of you getting t1 of every perk could theoretically cut the time for this down by 66%. Getting every perk on every character is for people that sink thousands of hours on the game. For example, I've played the game for about 2 years, and have about 2k hours, and I have all T3 perks on the killer I main, plus prestige, I have OK builds I got on the way to level 50 on everyone else, and I have spirit at prestige 2. That isn't even talking about the survivors. It could be done much faster without them. It's really not all that bad. By level 50 you should already have most perks at tier 1 or 2 already.
---
I did that as the wraith once
---
Clocked and found the hatch as the survivor was gonna jump in it, closed it right in front of his face
---
I felt like an ass for doing that tho
---
The survivor cannot do anything to progress the game, so the killer is holding the game hostage.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the original saw?? I thought it was an actual good movie and not just ‚Äútorture porn‚Äù that‚Äôs pretty much what the ones after turn into.
---
It's not in the slightest since you can just hide in a locker now but okay.
---
The issue with Barbeque is that the perk does too much. Not only is it an incredibly strong tracking perk but it is also by far the best farming perk in the game.
---
I honestly prefer Whispers for tracking but I still run BBQ on all the Killers that I have which have it because Bloodpoints.
---
I like the ones who get hit, use my cooldown to unhook, then magically disappear once the other person is unhooked and in front of me. Am I supposed to go searching for the person who's a good evader instead of the clear target? Especially when the evader is ultimately helping me kill the others and likely has multiple tank perks? Thanks Meg, but I'll take a 3k over a 1k any time.
---
I usually watch a mix of Hybrid Panda, Monto, Noob3, and Azralynn she plays DBD a lot but does other stuff too

Whoever becomes new mod - bring back Thoughtful Thursday plz

I mean you aren‚Äôt wrong, but that‚Äôs the extreme version lmfao. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs toxic and move on
---
As you progress through the series you kind of realize that saw 1 doesn't stay true to john kramers motives, i think ending was kinda meh, not enough amanda, and the writing was not that great. I knew people wouldn't like seeing saw 1 in d tier lol
---
I disagree on every level. Saw 1-6 shold be S saw 7 should be E.
---
Now I want spaghetti
---
As a single player, games are really hit or miss even at level 10. Got a game with people that could play and it was SO REFRESHING. Feng/Jeff/Claudette/Nea against a Freddy - As soon as the game started, running, no fear, working on the center gen. Unhooking and healing together. Body blocking shots. Hiding around corners as the killer and Jeff loop past us. I got a few decent loops in. This was a match where it started badly (got hooked pretty early and it was Freddy, whom I hate playing against) but we pulled it around for 2 escapes and double pip.
---
yea her add ons have always been garbage
---
I knew you would have input lol have you watched em recently? i watched every saw over the past 4 weeks so they're fresh in my mind, amanda wasn't even in 6 did you know that?
---
I think this is really on the devs side. They need a way to punish players who bitch out when they see legion or when they get downed.
---
honestly at this point, the pig is so beloved, i dont think anyone would care if they made her broken
---
Thats what i thought but i think it didnt hit me bcuz he let go of the trigger before it reached me
---
I wouldn't want to stain my reputation with that shithole of a company, besides even if I did, if I didn't have complete control of the game's balance design not much would change anyways. Balancing around the lower/lowest skilled players in every game has always been a bad idea, that said as much as I hate to say it BHVR is doing what is should be doing, at least financially. With the way the game is setup it makes sense to appeal to the majority, by making life easier/more enjoyable for the survivors they increase the chances of those players buying cosmetics/dlc and playing longer. That said I have very low expectations of the game getting much better until the lead balance designer changes to a more competent person not much will change. In a game where both the Nurse and Legion exist my only thanks goes to them being to stupid to realize how broken Nurse is.
---
Check my edit, buddy. Good point
---
I just love Legion's cosmetics but because of that I made it my goal to get all of them. Currently I only need 5 more pieces 2 rare 3 common and I can't tell if it was worth it yet.
---
i remove the upvote from my own posts n replies less  you mean it was an actual downvote

The Meta: leveling a character to P3 lv50 and wearing cosmetics with the P3 head
---
You can get more from a chase and a region though
---
It's not reportable. It's only reportable if there's no way for the survivor to get out without DCing
---
This is so simple but some on each side don't understand. Survivors act like returning to a hook is a jailable offense.
---
M&amp;A is actually quite a high-tier perk, even though Huntress can't really capitalize on its benefits
---
Call someone dumbass in public irl and you're likely to be removed from said public space if reported to managers/landlords or fired if an employee there.
---
Or held in jail for 24 hours for harassment/disturbing the peace

Reward people for playing full games. Can't punish those that DC cause a lot of the time it's the janky game. I DC'd while working on a gen one match. My internet is great..

The saw series gets way too complicated and really weird plot points and like every single character is working for John and it‚Äôs kinda dumb imo. It might not be your favourite but to say the original is the worst is nonsense.
---
inb4 someone actually gets killed on stream
---
Honestly, most of the time when I‚Äôm in green or purple ranks I get a decent variety of killers and that‚Äôs usually when I‚Äôm using the weaker killers and off meta builds too.

It's not reportable

I mean most swf is just friends playing together, I play a lot of solo so I can hold my own in game, so I just gossip with everyone and play and see what happens in the match

don't forget "unplug if your map is remotely at risk"

It was revealed in a later Saw it was Hoffman's plan.

Make sure to cleanse yourself from the vile purge, and oh! Be careful of the corruption!
---
Hillbilly? You just charge it to full and keep it held for him to chainsaw sprint/down a survivor.
---
I tried doing that for David but I accidentally blocked him on the stairs instead... which caused him to get downed... and then the killer went after me instead ;-;
---
Don't watch it. I can link you the only scene that is Saw. everything else is a mess with bad acting and un saw traps.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkgkvV-I8hk&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkgkvV-I8hk&amp;t=2s) Watch this and don't consider this a Saw movie. Save yourself from the pain I ahd.
---
Nope. They need to make one though, makes escaping impossible when he traps the gate.
---
Me as a full brown clothing Claudette on yamaokas estate
---
That's Cannibal's chainsaw. Billy's need to be held down.
---
Danny could be the Crapper. You know Trapper's cousin waiting to get into the game.
---
more hooks in the map :v
---
If you're already tilted to the point of DC'ing when you get downed once, you shouldn't be playing. **Take a break**
---
It‚Äôll be after the stream, because that‚Äôs when they are announcing a ton of stuff
---
Oh lol I didn't realise. Yeah that's weird
---
found the guy who got tunneled
---
Man this hit boxes keep getting stranger and stranger.
---
so you want a lower quality game just for cheaper cosmetics?
---
Maybe we're booing you because your logic is bad, especially judging that the Hillbilly is based off Leatherface, yet We have Leatherface now.
---
You are correct on that, their Twitter page does say chapter. But it should be a full dlc coming with ghost face since the pleague is 3 months old.
---
This will likely be one of the last trophies I get
---
One time, I was JUST about to bleed out and I just so happened to be crawling right toward the door. It was awesome. And the killer showed up right before I jumped in, and wasn‚Äôt close enough to catch me.
---
I dont play either tbh lol
---
Wow, didn't know it was this bad. Just started playing and the matchmaking alone is making me not even want to play and now this.
---
When you escape but you don't get a pip
---
FTFY :p
---
I actually love flashlights. Pretty high chance of that survivor not really doing any gens.
---
I mean he got the other three, I personally would‚Äôve been laughing if I witnessed that as killer. So hard to hate a Dwight. Unless it‚Äôs a toxic Dwight, the corrupt abomination even the Entity is fearful of
---
That should improve the queue times
---
you get perks on level 2-4. they changed it a while back.
---
Just don't do it then?
---
not really, if a lot of them play 1 side then whoever tries to play that same side will get long queue times
---
What is Amanda supposed to do in saw 1.
---
The writing isn't great but it's on par with the rest of the franchise.
---
They didn't develop the saw films backwards so all the other saws aren't true to his own ideology. Crap his own ideology istnt consistent within its own film.
---
And I think that the ending is the best in the franchise. It's on par with 2s ending , with 3s double twist coming in slightly lower , saw 4 and 7s are just bad twists (Twists should make you recontectualize the film) Saw 6 is just not interesting. Saw 5 doesn't really have one but it's kind of refreshing at that point and jigsaw just reuses the twist from saw 3.
---
There is a way for the survivor to get out. It just takes time
---
The same way that chasing survivors out the gates takes time. Is that reportable?
---
Everyone‚Äôs Legion it‚Äôs boring try someone else !
---
That's such a shame... I think he's entertaining and gives great advice. He seems to talk about peak play a lot though, so I can see why people might not be into that.
---
Despite the best of efforts, username fails to check out. Better luck next time champ.
---
Pro-tip; Virgin is sooooo 2005, update your lexicon to 2k19 man.
---
I'm pretty sure that the devs said while the game was in development that they wanted Leatherface in the game, but they didn't have the rights at the time, thus the Hillbilly, a knockoff Leatherface, being born. and Supposedly Leatherface DOES have a disfigured face, but i'm not sure.
---
I can understand not liking saw, (not really, but i get everyone has their own tastes), but how would the original saw ever be placed lower than any of the others?!?!
---
Happens all the time, you'll be surprised at just how many reposts reach the frontpage nowadays.
---
I tried killer and survivor both but they both suck sadly. I'd be better off playing mk 11 but I dont feel like grinding
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world
---
Im so excited for the streamm
---
Sorry, couldn't see anything with the recording being vertical and all.
---
I mean, there's more than one reason to be a Piggie main... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
This enhances my want for vommy mommy
---
It is bugged currently.
---
I think most killers are viable at high ranks. The only ones I would consider "nonviable" would be Fredberg and Bubba, and even they can have some good games. Billy, Nurse, and especially Spirit are leaps and bounds ahead of the other killers, though.
---
Eh, I'd argue Freddy's more serviceable than Clown or Legion in most situations at least.
---
popular doesn't = op? i disagree. People rarely play stuff that won't give them the best chance of surviving/killing coupled with getting lots of bloodpoints. The reason they nerf/buff perks just like with stats in other games is because a meta gets established of people using the same stuff because it is more effective than all the rest. The effectiveness of the perk makes it popular.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't get grabbed while jumping into the hatch anymore; the Kate could've just jumped in.
---
Ew wtf it‚Äôs spelt mummy dumbass American üòÇ
---
she's a qt
---
I know what I wrote
---
I want the mommy to step on me
---
That way, you can play around Borrowed Time.
---
You're right, I took this clip two months ago so the changes weren't live yet. So everybody was scared of getting grabbed lol.
---

I think you mean Gale. I also wouldn't mind either Dewey or Randy. One of these 4 from the movies and I'll be happy.
---
Ussylis is good if you want to improve, but people like no0b3 and Monto and Demi are entertaining
---
That would explain why the Clown didn't just close the hatch then.
---
Why do you have to call me out like that though?
---
yep! i‚Äôll post an imgur link to a bunch when i get home in like four hours.
---
So the Plague
---
She has the potential to only have to hit a survivor once to down them if they get broken by her ability.  As soon as their poisoned, they have a choice: heal and give the Plague her corrupt purge or not heal and eventually go into broken status and be a 1-hit down (which, with the way hitboxes are now?  Very suicidal)  If they do give her Corrupt Purge, they turn her into a faster Huntress that can literally spray and pray and hit all 4 people if they're clumped together.
---
Puking on random objects, while it can be time consuming, can serve as a deterrent for survivors who don't wish to go through the hassle of making the decision of broken vs corrupt and dealing with that.
---
If the pools didn't heal you up from injured, Plague would probably be OP.  The game would be **considerably** slower if every time a person got sick and injured from it they had to also find someone else to be healed up to full, and especially if the Plague had their Corrupt Purge and was chasing you because they could just spray and pray and one drop of it will down you.
---
Problem is not every killer will have/should have a way to end chases easily, otherwise there'd be little chance for survivors.  It's why a good Nurse is such a pain: they can end every chase instantly.  I think the Plague is a fine mid-tier killer like Clown: they have abilities that allow them to impede survivor's actions in differing ways that can allow for a good player to dominate without being able to just break the game.  
---
Also, I do believe the game is balanced around the idea of a killer averaging 2 kills per match.  The emblem system sure doesn't make it seem that way but that's what I've read over and over and over.
---
wait disconnecting your Ethernet cable STILL keeps your items?
---
Oh don't I know it. I'm a killer main. 4k5gens are a depip often
---
[CAW PURACHINA](https://imgur.com/a/WpL6w0O)
---
I love shaking on the ground while exhausted
---
I don‚Äôt like that statement because I could turn it the other way as an excuse for my horrendous playstyle. 
---
These killers could say instead ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing around deliverance‚Äù and that‚Äôs a valid statement.
---
There are much more reliable tracking perks out there, when there‚Äôs so many counters to BBQ. The popularity isn‚Äôt an indicator of how effective of a tracking perk it is at all, I guarantee if you cut off the bloodpoints people will use a dofferent tracking perk in it‚Äôs place. You can‚Äôt hide in a locker against whispers, you can‚Äôt juke directions against nurse‚Äôs calling, etc
---
Most killers can‚Äôt use the few seconds of crossmap surveillance on survivors but the double bloodpoints + this tracking is enough to make it popular. It‚Äôs effective at farming and tracking, not OP at either of them. There‚Äôs counterplay, heavy incentive not to camp or tunnel.. 
---
How exactly would you want to nerf it?
---
If your standing right there it‚Äôs not like the person unhooking is gonna get away so why wouldn‚Äôt you just go for them?
---
Deliverance isn't as common as Dead Hard, but I didn't think about that.  
---
By "playing around BT" you're being nice at the same time, I guess.
---
Killer main as well, as long as I get rewarded for doing my job I think that's fair
---
Why not though? I mean no one is obligated to give someone else the hatch, but he also didn't do anything to be 'undeserving' of it. If he had saved OP, he only ran risk of himself or both of them dying, there was no way they were getting out both.
---
4 man SWF only makes up 6% of games. Find a new excuse for being bad.
---
Mountain out of a mole hill....
---
I watch AngryPug play a LOT. And I rarely ever see him have the issue you describe.
---
Every now and then it happens, but not nearly on the level you bitch about.
---
&gt; I played no mither squad with 3 other guys
---
This tell me all I need to know about you, you're a toxic player.
---
The only Saw I liked was Saw 1. But I'd put it way above any of the others. It should be in B Tier. That's my only real comment. Scream should be higher as well. I loved the latest Halloween as much as the original but I can see the argument for it being lower than the original.
---
Dying Light doesn't give you a "Mangled" status effect, so they should.
---
That's it I'm getting me mallet
---
Myers. Hes fun to play, hag is only good for perks, which you can get through other means
---
You literally said ‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs wrong with playing Freddy‚Äù so I did????? You didn‚Äôt specify a damn thing lol.  Did you say ‚ÄúTell me what invalidates playing as Freddy. I dare you‚Äù so don‚Äôt twist shit because I told you why he‚Äôs the weakest killer and why MoM is fucking you over, and why they teabag at the exit gates because you don‚Äôt apply enough pressure.  Just fucking admit you suck already. 
---
And my argument was MoM doesn‚Äôt bother me because I usually make them waste it mid game? I didn‚Äôt justify the perk. I don‚Äôt use the perk when I play survivor!  But instead of having a chill discussion why you don‚Äôt like it, you bash people who call you out for being an asshole.   The only thing I said to you for you to flip out on me was because I said you probably don‚Äôt apply enough pressure, and I still stand by it. 
---
You don‚Äôt have to care how you sound here. Your issues ring loud and clear. If you want to argue with people all day for the rest of your life because you‚Äôre mad at the world 24/7 I can‚Äôt stop you. You deal with that on your own. And there is a ‚Äúdamn thing I can do about it‚Äù I can stop replying, I‚Äôll let you see this comment so you know you‚Äôre a fucking loser, and I can block you :‚Äô)  But I love how you called me a pussy! I got one &lt;3    You‚Äôre the type of person who calls their mom a bitch when you don‚Äôt get your way and don‚Äôt deny it.

if i run WGLF i still only make safe unhooks without bringin borrowed.

Really? If I‚Äôm the killer it‚Äôs always either by me or they escape immediately. If I‚Äôm the survivor it‚Äôs either shut instantly or right next to me and I escape. Surely this can‚Äôt be coincidence.
---
Wholesome comments &lt;3 love! So many downvotes because conflicting opinions D;
---
Not grautenteed. Always good to bring burrowed time if you're going to be prioritizing hook saves over other objectives.  
---
BT only works when the killer is in radius. And good luck getting a safe hook In that scenario.
---
I'm calm I just feel strongly about what i said...
---
The costume includes the traditional ‚Äúcloak‚Äù sort of thing, right? I hope there‚Äôs a classic look if that‚Äôs the case, the leather peasant rags don‚Äôt do it for me
---
Yes I have done a slowest healing build that uses sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, couldrophobia, and dying light they all stack you can do it on freddy to make it the slowest while they are in dream with certain addons its ridiculously slow
---
It‚Äôs crazy how fast meg is compared to someone like jeff
---
It would have been awesome to get a survivor who could booby trap generators so if a killer tries to kick a gen after she's worked on it, it explodes and they get stunned for a few seconds.
---
Yes, of course. Is there anywhere in the text where it seems like I'm asking people to only send pictures when they find something good? I'd like to correct it if that's the case.
---
Or just play BBQ, Hex: Ruin, NOED, and Nurse's every match like people like to do. /s
---
It's annoying for survivors too, especially when you don't get the character's own perks to tier 3 by rank 50. It makes prestiging a big risk.
---
uwu
---
**Yes, So great**
---
You're dumb... nobody goes to jail for calling each other names... talk is cheap...  you're comparing real shit to someone talking shitt on on a video game. I cant with you.
---
excuse me where are my memes
---
Or they pretend to let me go to the hatch, even though I know they'll pick me up right before, or mori me. When EGC came out, they'd slug just to see the animation.
---
I dont like this just because if you delevel a perk, it can take a lot of blood points in the blood web to get it again, and sometimes DCs aren't intentional. I'd be pissed if my internet went down and then I had to spend the blood points I was saving up to get a perk I already had back.
---
I'm the type to get the hatch spawn in front of my face while I'm dying on the hook.
---
Whoever here is gonna become a mod please do something about low effort posts such as people ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù dbd characters in paint and reposts.

because in case the killer is not camping it is just selfish :/ and i hate to play with people like that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ahgoeb/angery/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

That was most likely the game DCing them than an actual person quitting the game. It still happens where the game randomly DCs a person because of crashes or something of the like.
---
Petrified Oak increases the distance between hooks, Putrid Oak decreases the distance. None of them affect the number of hooks any more.
---
No, its not in the text but people tend to do that, so I just wanted to make sure because I am really interested in the data.
---
Good recommendations. Do they also make history and tutorial videos too? I don't use Twitch a lot tbh, so I mostly watch Tyde's produced stuff on YouTube. For alternatives, I'd love to see folks who do something similar. I'll also watch n00b on occasion, but again, only his produced stuff. His manner of speech really annoys me for some reason, so watching him stream might make my eyes hemorrhage.
---
Yes but now it‚Äôs LITERALLY useless
---
I fucking love you.  The way you speak compared to this ‚Äúvillage jackass (lmfao)‚Äù is ridiculous. You are so full of knowledge. You have yet to say one thing that wasn‚Äôt true about the guy.   More people need to be as educated as you, Captain.  But in all honesty, he‚Äôs a miserable person. He‚Äôs going to argue with anyone he can to make himself feel better but we don‚Äôt want him to feel better, do we? He deserves his anger and hate so replying back to him would be doing him a favor.
---
I think that Evil Dead 2 is just a little bit better than Ash vs Evil Dead but I do think that both belong in S tier. Also I'm gonna be honest, I think the only good thing about the Saw movies are the traps, they suck at everything else in my opinion.
---
y'all look like figurines!
---
uh....you do realise that it can say anything. why are you jumping into conclusions thinking names like these are always homophobic it can just be "trans people aren't bad" i guess. or something else
---
I've just bought the DLC so I was trying some stuff with the perks I had unlocked haha
---
As a day 1 player my Optimism was killed years ago by a 5 blink ebony mori noed nurse

I think if I had to pick a favorite Saw I would pick the first one because of the amazing ending.

Please uninstall if this isn't a shit post.  Ragequitting against Wraiths because they're "op"  LOL!

If you want really wholesome communities and fun/good players, I would recommend:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/umbra (absolute best community and probably the most down to earth streamer, catch her tonight at 10PM EST)
---
and https://www.twitch.tv/kittychipz if you want to watch and just have a good laugh. She calls everyone a dumbass, but it's more of a term of endearment than an insult
---
I don't remember how to do it as it's been too long since I've played PS but there's a way to check who is in the game you're in, for just about every games server that you're on/attached to.
---
Just look behind you while running, and when he charges with chainsaw, swerve to the side, usually works if you time it and distance right. He isn‚Äôt op as I‚Äôm not even high rank but have no real struggle with him.
---
Vinc3tvega is a good one to watch.
---
I think Rank Reset is necessary to keep games feeling fresh so that not everyone just stagnates at Rank 1 but... I don't understand why Rank 1s go down to Rank 10 after a reset.
---
I wish I have friends as you are. Good job, i like your costumes .
---
It would have been fine imo if they didnt slap it into red forest, it feels lazy. Could have done almost anything else with the surrounding space, or even just made it an indoor map.
---
Loop him is the obvious answer...
---
But he's also a moth so shine your flashlight on him to uncloak him. He will be stunned for a few seconds when you burn him with your flashlight beam, just as if you stunned him with a palette. If he has Enduring then don't bother, just GTFO if you can.
---
I watch a lot of Monto, Painreliever and recently I binged noob3 series 'once upon a toxic...'. I though he would be as cringe and annoying as ochido but I'm pleasantly surprised he isnt. I also watch some Tydetyme and the King videos for some patch notes and announcements.
---
Recently picked up Myers, been having a blast. Got to Dying Light level 2 (finally) and decided to try it out. Unfortunately, poor Laurie was getting bullied by sandbagging teammates, who promptly got two-hooked in the basement. Fast forward to the other three teammates dying, I felt so bad for tunneling the Laurie who had been bullied, that I gave them a free hatch.  
---
Honestly, seeing that person in post-game chat thank me for that made my day.
---
Again, even if I get a jumpstart like a palletstun, he just catches up pretty fast. I can't even begin to start hiding.
---
I mean I'd understand if it was just like 5 or so ranks but 10? That's too much. Then u have ranks 6-9 going up to 13-16.
---
Probably because they wanted to show something at Pax and a killer takes a lot more time to make than a survivor (we had received the Plague just a month prior to the announcement after all) and they may not have known how to make a Deadite killer work.
---
LOL
---
Great, then you should also be interested in contributing to the data, right? Right??? RIGHT?!?!?!
---
What even is this shit?
---
Fun for you maybe
---
Just walk away from it. He doesn't move fast enough with the saw to actually make contact as long as you're going strait away from him.
---
remember he's also a tracking and a stealthy killer, perks like Iron Will, Lightweight, Dance with Me, Q&amp;Q, Premonition, Alert, Spine Chill, Urban Evasion are all great to counter him if you have a hard time evading him
---
Nice animation, horrible voice acting xD
---
Lmfaooo
---
That‚Äôs who it should be fun for.
---
Probably just a memer.
---
Harsh words. But true words.
---
Then you run to the next one. Stall the game until gens are done. He has to be uncloaked to hit you he's really easy to loop.
---
Could also be latency , not just hitboxes.
---
See I like the gameplay, but having to waiting 5 minutes between every match and not counting the time it takes to start up the game I‚Äôm not trying to play a game of dnd 10 minutes from now I want to play it now
---
I mean by that logic why did DS get reworked? It was only unfun for killers.
---
Well you think survivors are gonna wanna go against cheese builds like this?
---
No, i was a plague just doing my daily.
---
All killers eventually catch up. Your teammates do gens while you loop and either swap off with you or come unhook you.
---
Imagine thinking Leatherface is OP
---
Tommy: Doing gens, you?
---
I'm not planning on staying down here for very long. Maybe 6 months at the most. Just visiting for now. I can't stand the weather or the heat in this damn state. Idk why so many people even want to live in Florida.
---
Serious, why is that a bad thing? I just got into this game so I‚Äôm learning the etiquette. Isn‚Äôt that the best way to ensure a kill if you‚Äôre the killer? Why wouldn‚Äôt you do that?
---
key
---
Ready to be up at 5Am my fellow east Aussies?
---
It does feel kinda hopeless when it happens but it should favour the killer more anyways.
---
meme from 1800bc. Also did you literally just google "dead by daylight meme" and steal one of the first images you found?
---
The meme itself is fine. Even I believe that you should chase the killer AWAY from the hook. It‚Äôs the title that‚Äôs a problem. Complaining about SWF is ridiculous now that we know how many 4 man SWF teams there truly are. Even if you add all the game together where 2 and 3 man SWF are in a game, it‚Äôs still less than half the games played. 
---
People point at SWF as though it‚Äôs this massive problem when they pay zero attention to numbers. Even a 4 man SWF give you less than 50% survival rate, yet killer mains still scream that the game is survivor sided, and that SWF is OP.
---
"Dead by Daylight Submarine Sandwich" was a stretch. I'll give it a 6, overall (out of 9).
---
The simple answer is the aim of the Killer is to please the Entity by killing survivors with their ability and in intersting ways so Camping is not only annoying and boring but nets the Killer fewer points.
---
Have you ever yoinked a Jane off a gen due to Dark Devotion as Legion and put her in the basement? It's one of my best yoinks if not the best one.
---
You hate to see it
---
low effort pff that's what i wanna see
---
I feel like it should favor survivor in some way though, I mean mid chase he can grab you as well so it's like hatch is pretty much useless unless you have a key
---
He can't cloak and uncloak to catch up in a loop. Once he commits to a loop he has to be uncloaked.
---
Yeah but is also really frustrating when survivors leave just because they have adrenaline. Noed is basically the counter to Adrenaline. Both sides dont need skill to be activated. But for adrenaline you have to finish all the gens wich can be hard sometimes. I think they should just make it that it just lasts like first 40/50/60 secs but guranteed, without a hex. That way you could just wait it out and dont cleanse totems. Also for that i'd make that you have to do at least 1 full Generator or something for adrenaline to be activated, i mean doesnt make a lot of sense to get adrenaline through your blood when you did nothing the entire game. Give it a requirement or shit and then its fine
---
Ghost face leak is the main thing
---
If you don‚Äôt struggle I take you to a hook and stare at it for 5 seconds, if you still don‚Äôt struggle you passed the test and get the hatch. If you fail you die.
---
Where is Ghostface? This is unacceptable. Sure choking myself with a pillow case is hot but still.
---
And even if you are actually guaranteed to die, why d/c? It takes maybe a few minutes assuming you aren't on your 2nd hook, if you are it's definitely only a couple of minutes at most, and if it's your 3rd time getting hooked you die instantly. 
---
In any of these situations, just wait it out. You can just leave right after you die if you want to. And as you pointed out, yeah, if the killer is camping you, it sucks, but it does at least mean your teammates are getting gens, and the Killer is also losing points on his emblem, so less BPs for him.
---
You targeted a person in a video game because he said the truth? its a mental disorder not an identity. smh
---
...no
---
A 6% increase would be times 1.06, not 0.06.
---
That makes sense, thanks for the reply. It‚Äôs a shame I got downvoted for asking that question though.
---
But this doesn't appear to be complaining about swf being OP at all. He's not even complaining as if swf is too good or helpful. He's just complaining about swf that lead the killer to the hook and then all cry 'camper' it doesn't reflect on his skill as a killer at all. That's why I don't understand you calling him bad.
---
Nerf Adren and MoM first and I'd be fine with nerfing NOED.
---
It's only Sidney or Kirby for me haha
---
No worries, and yeah welcome to the toxic sludge that is the DBD subreddit
---
Wow why should you want to do gens if the hatch spawns at any point anyway plus you can just use the exit gates if the killer closes the hatch
---
The first Evil Dead is better than Army of Darkness tbh
---
i cant stop watching him flop like that
---
Youre not going to juke and hide from any half decent killer. Your goal is to waste as much time as possible so the other survs can do gens before you get hooked.
---
This game has a very lively community, some are terrible people, but most are decent human beings.
---

Both awesome chill streamers. They do play other games on occasion, not primarily DBD, but great to watch anyway. They don't whine, complain, or focus too hard on the meta. They're both skilled players but don't brag or get salty (although Oroboro loves seeing salty players in post-game chat).
---
Definitely worth checking out. I watch them both all the time, since the "big" dbd streamers are all kind of boring after a while. You can tell they're burnt out.
---
Vinc3ntVega:  [https://www.twitch.tv/vinc3ntvega](https://www.twitch.tv/vinc3ntvega)

If you want a DBD main streamer. He's hilarious and swaps between killer and survivor every hour to keep it fresh. He also does random perk wheels, and other random challenge/bits throughout the stream. Awesome streamer if you want an active viewing experience full of excitement that won't get boring fast.

Not while he is charging his chainsaw. His chainsaw is useless at every loop and is only good at getting a multi down at a hook or if the is in an area with no pallets or windows anywhere nearby
---
What a brave opinion.
---
&gt;Sort
---
because you aren't an idiot... people can't handle an easily countered perk, they get angry, then they complain online about it. Any decent player, such as yourself, can handle an active noed, or prevent noed from becoming active

Yup, there are many killers you can't get away from b/c their ability is a gap closer (spirit, billy, nurse, etc..). A survivor can't really do much to break a chase on their own, only prolong it. Just stall the killer as long as you can. Your team can do gens, and they can even try to save you by distracting the killer long enough for you to escape, but once you're in a chase your fate is basically in the hands of the killer and your teammates.

She do be lookin kinda fresh doe üò≥
---
Indeed
---
I smiled at this.
---
Probably.
---
Wow
---
u should be nerfed!
---
Ok.
---
lol I didn't know that either! Nice find.
---
One of the devs literally said on the forum earlier this week that a ‚Äòchapter‚Äô can refer to anything, including a solo character
---
That's why I use the exit gate to leave XD also most survivors are poo
---
&gt; Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I believe you can escape and still not pip
---
You can get a 4K as a killer and only safety pip, emblem system is stupid at times for both sides
---
Lol good to know
---
Beautiful.
---
So are you saying you camp? Because according to you, a skilless killer will camp, and that if you stay near the basement when you have two people hooked in the basement, you lack skill.
---
This actually got a laugh out of me...well done sir.
---
I would love to run, but I don't have all the requirments.
---
this is a smart build i like it, though predator isnt a good perk, i‚Äôd choose bbq instead so u can see everyone
---
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll play Survivor!‚Äù
---
*-Randoms disconnect after being hit once, everyone has been hooked twice and only one Gen is done-*
---
‚ÄúNEVERMIND. I guess I‚Äôll play Killer!‚Äù
---
*-2 Gens pop in the first minute, insta-heal Med Kits and Adrenaline timed perfectly-*
---
His name, I think the last part was people, but it didn't fit

Bruh transgender aint a think if you got a ton of testostorone at birth u a Guy if you dont u a girl the ONLY exeption is a shemale
---
By camping someone on the hook, you're allowing the others free time to complete generators which is the opposite of what you want. If they get generators done quickly, this will hurt your end game score. Prolong them being completed as much as you can .
---
Similarly, if you do not chase, injure or hook other people, this will also hurt your end game score. You are supposed to hook 9+ times (if you can) for an optimal score.
---
You will want to put as much pressure around the map as you can and camping someone on the hook will only make you lose points , while giving the survivors an easy chance to escape.
---
Isn‚Äôt Freddy a pedo? Feelsweirdman

even if it was a mental disorder, you realize they're still people right?

M&amp;a is only active out of chances, and you're more obvious during chases.

Still doesn't fix rsrity issues.

Now tales an add on and perk and movement slow

video settings? ultra?
---
The joke is that trans people aren‚Äôt [people]. A clever play on words for a homophobic joke
---
At least you only have to max one survivor once you have the teachable perks.
---
I had no clue about that. I figured you got more points for kills. I started watching streamers and noticed they don‚Äôt wait around after the hook so that was my first indicator that that‚Äôs not great, but wasn‚Äôt sure why. This explains it.
---
Don't let anyone stop you from being you!
---
Memer =/= transfobic
---
If that's your definition of being held hostage, then I'm honestly not sure what to tell you. No matter how you argue it, there is a definite end. You are guaranteed to be able to leave the game normally instead of having to disconnect.
---
It is true that you cannot progress the timer yourself, but that is unnecessary because the timer progresses on its own. Go and make yourself a sandwich, or watch a video. Check your phone. The timer will run out eventually, and you'll be in the next match.
---
Is it toxic? Sure. Is it holding the game hostage? I wouldn't really say so.
---
For fun!
---
God, how toxic can some of these comments be?
---
Ha! I noticed that pretty fast
---
Leathersface is one of the weakest killer.
---
At first glance, I had to double check that I wasn‚Äôt on r/Bloodborne .
---
counts as an escape/killer DC and saves your pip as well
---
You know that balance landing was going to get him anyways
---
Of course it‚Äôs a Dwight lmao
---
It doesn't help much for map control as much as survivor tracking, so I don't think you'd get more than 2 kills most times.
---
I mean for his build it is. 
---
3/4 perks in this build are bad. But they fit what style he‚Äôs trying to go for.
---
Rigid but fair
---
The free weekend is really messing with lobbies D:
---
Make them fight each other to the death like gladiators to decide who gets out
---
I don't care about getting the last kill. I just wanted to prove a point.
---
true, but i think bbq still fits the build well. im gonna try this build sometime
---
No. I'm so good, I don't need to camp.
---
I also propose that more perks have the double BP bonus on them. As a killer I feel like I am wasting time if I don't use BBQ and chili as it technically cuts the grind in half and it STILL feels insane and then the game play starts to feel stiff because you almost have to run BBq and ruin leaving you with only 2 perk slots to play around with.
---
*Happy oink!*
---
I am 51 years old and this is the only online game I have ever enjoyed enough to stick with.
---
Hey I and 2 friends literally got the game last night and got destroyed haha but thanks for this post. I fwd it to them and hopefully it'll help us out next time we play.
---
My goal as killer is to give survivors hope of survival only to slowly kill their friends one by one. If the last person still has hopes of survival they will die. Only when they have nothing left in them do I let them survive, I‚Äôve already killed their will to play.
---
It‚Äôs always a Meg too, as if the killer doesn‚Äôt expect them to have adrenaline
---
Hey, maybe if Pig wasn't so annoying to play against as a solo survivor, then it wouldn't be so bad.
---
Fair enough.
---
GachiPls Thread locked
---
Wow that‚Äôs definitely useful to know but is this only pc though.
---
Welcome to the world sadly :(
---
Then you'd be on the same page as every Florida local I know, haha!
---
Wait, really?
---
Wait, I thought every map was night time?
---
It was not a compliment. I am not worried though. This is a rare and very expensive build. In most cases it does not even pays off, so no BP gained :/
---
HAHAHAHHA SOO TRUE
---
XDDDD
---
Her kit really isn't all that bad though. When I play Survivor, Pig matches tend to be some of the fairest.
---
Virtue signaling at its best
---
People complaining about reposts should really get off Reddit and do something else more often. The fact that it got upvoted this much even though its apparently a "repost" just means that a lot of people don't use Reddit that often and this is the first time they have seen this meme.
---
You think  
---
Could be literally anything, but ok
---
I consider a 3 kill a victory honestly
---
Well normally I would say it doesn't matter because the killer would just down you again but now with Mettle of man being a thing....even though they did say they plan on changing it for the time right now that would be a bit broken. If the hatch it nearby or the door is open you would just hop of take a hit with mettle and fly out the exit
---
I saw somewhere that the Devs were just doing that rework to get a foundation so they can continue to do more work on Legion.
---
No audio due to unrelated conversation in the background
---
I assume you play against higher skilled Pigs? My rank is usually between 15-11 so Pigs in this range aren't entirely skilled.
---
If only there was something like a totem counter for survivors. Only then would i be ok with Noed
---
I'm actually kinda fine with Noed, but have had ideas for a nerf. Like, only activating once per survivor or something. So healing up is a countering option. And end game collapse can make it so it doesn't just make the totem worthless once there's the four hooks (if they can even rack them up in time)
---
Ah, I forgot that was this weekend. That would explain it.
---
Honestly that's worse because I don't want to be scaring off new potential players.
---
I mean, sadly people are transphobic. I wish it was normal for someone to be trans.
---
I swear to god, they nerf my Piggy and then don't remove the secret ultra rare LF addon?
---
Really? I mean maybe it's just because i saw it coming but when you really look back on it it's like, really? that mf was sitting there the whole time? like as a twist it's like wow! but from a practical standpoint it's like why? lol was that necessary? what is your character even? I love john kramer as a character but it's his lack of development in the first movie that ruins it for me
---
great idea)
---
Lifeguards will be searching for Claudette
---
Problem is, you nerf the top two killers, and suddenly no killer is viable at red ranks, and now the issue is on the opposite side. Killers always lose, and it'll be a relief when rank reset comes.
---
The 'Wanting to have a fair chance at winning the game' goes for both killers and survivors. Killers want to win just as much as survivors, and the only way to reasonably win without completely sweating your ass off(Slugging and tunneling), is to play the only killers that allow enough pressure to prevent all gens from popping because a single chase lasted for 2 minutes, even if everyone was on death hook at that point
---
Ok but still none of that applies to this and doesn't explain you calling him bad
---
1) i would consider 2+ kills a win, its a grey area 
---
2) Take risk if you want, Playing the huntress (hatchets girl) is a killer you will have to take risk at higher ranks just bc how hard she is to play
---
3) you can not damage gens after all gates are powered, if 2 gens were still needed to be done then he left through the hatch. 
---
Dont worry about people getting upset, you are going up against a bunch of low rank bad players so expect salt. Play the game how you want, and have fun &lt;3
---
The Plague is perfect. I also love that she discovered make-up and covered up that decay and blisters. If she had that back in Babylon, things might have been different...
---
1. "Winning" is not so black and white in this game. Read the "Emblems" on the post-game screen. They tell you what all things you should be doing as killer/survivor. For example, you get points toward winning when you hit a survivor and when you hook one, but lose points for standing near a hooked survivor and letting the survivors heal.
---
2. No. Little-known fact, but due to the Emblem system, *both* sides can "win." People seem to be under the impression that it's kills vs. escapes and one side doing well means the other did poorly, but that's not it at all on this game. It's almost like you're all on the same time to re-create a good, thrilling slasher experience. Focus on your Emblem objectives, not just kills.
---
3. Yes. When only one survivor is left, the hatch will spawn and open. It's a race to see if the killer finds it first (if you do, you can shut it).
---
And thats a no for u
---
And they will never find her.
---
1. if you pip, you won. 
---
2. you'll learn more by taking risks
---
3. when there's only one person remaining, the hatch opens. if you find it first you can close it (which will power the gates tho, so now you have to defend those). After closing the hatch, the End Game Collapse (EGC for short) timer stards. if you keep the survivor in game for 2 minutes, he'll die.
---
Have had this happen to me more times than I can remember. The theres the flash light blind and they Urban Evade away. Almost feels like they just used Za Warudo to get away lol
---
I see that Billy up there.
---
Low tier so easy to counter
---
So I just tested it with a few friends and it and it seems both wake up and leader stack additively (40%). We got the gate opened in around 12-13 seconds. 
---
So my math was indeed wrong. I just wish Behavior was a little more consistent in how they deal with certain values stack.
---
*cries in Hag*
---
1. The ‚Äúwin condition‚Äù can be whatever you want it to be.  Mine is hooking each survivor once so I can max out my BP with BBQ and Chili.  
---
2. You might as well go for all four, if there are two gens left to repair and one survivor, you should be trying to find the hatch, as the survivor is not going to try and repair gens then open the door.
---
3. If you mean there were two gens left to repair then yes, he escaped through the hatch.  
---
4. What you described of your play strategy  is indeed called hook camping.  It is generally considered bad manners but is a widespread practice in the game.
---
Billy actually got nerfed. The recovery on a missed chainsaw is considerably longer than it was, and that's the only kind of nerf he really needs. It makes screw ups more relevant, and even if you run straight past a survivor, you can't instantly be up their ass
---
If they give him 110% movement speed, or increase the rev time on his chainsaw, I'll be pretty upset, because then he'll be a dogshit killer. Take away nurse as well, and as soon as killers reach red ranks, they'll stop playing until rank reset because playing any other killers usually lead to massive amounts of frustration
---
she's not very good
---
Telling by the communities you're active in you're most definitely a virgin bud.
---
Smoking Mavericks and washing them down with yoohoo
---
He got the smol dick energy üòé
---
Stop comparing noed to adrenaline they arent even the same, one rewards you for doing your objectives. The other one rewards killer for being bad..
---
Among the many positive additions of the end game collapse, I particularly like how keys are now a more strategic choice to bring in.
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø transphobes be like that
---
Ok dude
---
Yeah she just seems faster I remember playing a character other than meg for the first time and being like ‚Äúso slow‚Äù
---
This is such a Nea thing to do, lol.
---
Easily one of the worst decisions they've made so far. By a considerable margin. It's an i-win perk for killers who dont even attempt to outthink their opponent
---
C tier. Her power becomes useless if the survivors don‚Äôt cleanse (which good survivors won‚Äôt do). She can be good but depends on the survivors. ;)
---
&gt; Nurse doesn't counter MoM anymore. You get stacks. 
---
My bad on that one, didnt know they changed it
---
&gt; Also, an extra hit against a killer that can turn a game on its head with a single down is worth fairly little 
---
Have to admit i don't understand your point here, no offense. Sounds like you're saying the extra hit doesn't really matter against nurse? Because in that case i fully agree, that was exactly my point. Nurse is already strong enough to not care about most stuff that's in the game. But try playing wraith or any M1 killer against that shit and you're almost guaranteed to have a bad time
---
You have to learn to loop better just keep practicing, bring a flashlight as well everytime he brakes a pallet booom right in his face, gives you time to run and hide, 2 things are going to happen he's going to leave you for another surivor or your really going to piss him off and he's going to tunnel you all game. Personally I would take the risk.
---
The new Freddy rework is ridiculous. BHVR, do something!
---
Pretty much any non-meta perk is a waste of a slot. That's why they get nerfed and buffed bc perks are just way too important
---
hunch wasn't though. I reccomended it to new players.
---
yeah and we all have our opinions. and here is mine
---
We should get full points for DCs. Survivors should get their lost Benevolence for any lost because of that scrub.
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs Ash, he does that.
---
C√∂me √§t m√´ br√∂th√´r

üòÖüòÇüòÇ
---
At the end of the game, on the 2nd screen with all the categories and their ranks.. underneath will be the progression. there will be a black pip, which means you didn't rank up or down, and there's 2 positive pips, +1 and +2, which work towards your rank.
---
I have my graphics quality set to high, if that's what you're asking.
---
My friend, you can 4K as a killer and DEPIP. ü§£ if one or two of them decide to sudoku themselves on first hook
---
Please tell me this isn't intentional
---
Thank you! It's an honor. It was. I didn't realize his name until halfway in the match, so I didn't tunnel. Got 4K anyways, I mean look at the rank
---
They must be transphobic because they make jokes
---
Well I could not look into the other Locker. So maybe this is one special Locker or some nice editing skills üëç or idk
---
It‚Äôs a Meg tho, they always last like 10 seconds in a fight and drop pallets when the killer is 20 meters away from them.
---
Dude, if you use Black Incense on Plague, then your entire build will become useless, because you won't need any tracking perks on her with that add-on equipped, because you will have free wallhacks all time. You can use something like Ruin, Surveillance, Discordance ( even if I think this perk is overrated ), Monitor and Abuse, Enduring + Spirit Fury. Also, you should use an Apple with Black Incense.
---
A lot of people still think Clown is Top 5 or something... what many don't know is the act of throwing a bottle actually slows Clown himself. The net effect between slowing the Surv and the Clown slowing himself is about neutral.
---
Basically his Power doesn't do anything. It turns fast vaults into medium ones, that's really all it helps in a chase. Everything else is placebo, attempts at dodging the gas for fear that it's stronger than it really is.
---
This is gonna be a good one
---
Most likely, you left out that the joke is transphobic though.
---
Once again your comment is completely invalid. I said if you do it last minute before you are going to die anyways it doesnt matter. You will literally be on the hook until you die but instead of dying and being punished for the killers playstyle you dc and dont.
---
If you hold down the PS button, go up to Dead By Daylight &gt; currently playing with and you can figure out who the killer is
---
Played with this out of curiosity. Dwight was one of the few characters I COULD in fact see. It's definitely visible, and seems intentional tbh, but it's worth saying I definitely could NOT see shorter survivors. I tested with Laurie and Meg and neither of them were visible.
---
Ur cute UwU üíï
---
Yeah I'll waste a killers time but if I have a rare item or something that I never got to use fuck them. The last second before I would die I'm going to dc and keep my stuff.
---
It's effecting every map.
---
Yea. I know. Just with the last few killers added: spirit, legion, plague and now GF, that‚Äôs 12 new perks. So an additional 36 bloodwebs per killer. At 50k per web, you‚Äôre looking at an additional 1.8 million BPs per killer.
---
That‚Äôs insane guys. A new killer main has no chance of catching up.
---
That's just disrespectful ! And insane !
---
Actually the free weekend and the sale helped a lot with the game population.
---
All that's missing is a tbag spam and them sprintbursting away
---
SLAY !
---
I mean if there are two of us we can maybe get the save but some killers will hit you once and just face the guy on the hook. I try to bait them out I'll be injured and everything and they just secure the kill.
---
I know, the CFL draft is that day too :(
---
Does this not happen on console?
---
Then you'd get 0 points because you were too lazy to struggle on your own lol
---
Most DCs I encounter now is the game kicking them out. Yes first down DCs exist still but a majority seems to be game host disconnect.
---
*thick british accent*
---
And here we have the now endangered Dweets out in their natural habitat. This series of movements has been deemed a mating ritual of some kind. It is so powerful, in fact, that the local female Huntress, the apex predator of the area, does not seem to mind and joins in.
---
*happiness oink*
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt tried it myself.
---
I will If I ever get a chance.
---
60% of Killers:  
---
Op: MeTtLe Of MaN hAs A cOuNtEr!
---
Jesus christ you're narrow minded. If your teammates screws you over that doesn't make you bad at the game. You alsi mentioned earlier that if the killer spared you, you dc. You're just throwing away all the bloodpoints. 200 IQ plays there
---
There should be some kind of penalty for disconnecting
---
"Before, survivors would DC when they went against a Legion. Now we've made it so that once you get downed by Legion, you get disconnected automatically"
---
well when you have hundreds of hours on one killer things can get a little boring. I would like to play all killers and have a lot of variety in my play. I'm not necessarily going for the **strongest** build, just a new and fun one. like Myers for example, you can play him with a super small terror radius and sneak around, you can play with a huge terror radius and infectious fright for a slugging build, you can do vault master Myers and although all those might not be as strong as spirit fury/enduring/ruin/M&amp;A they are still fun and I would like to try them. some of them I cant even try because even though i put a ton of points into him I have yet to get some of those perks even with the 650+ hours. Now of course I would probably have them if I put every point into Myers but I don't want to play just 1 killer...I want to be able to spread out and play different people with different build just for the fun of it.
---
Like I never play Doc because I usually find it so frustrating to have to M1 everyone and the power not really helping with that, but if I had the perks to make a totem protector Doc I would play him much more, even if people are escaping every match it woulds still be fun to play it.
---
My matchmaking has been fantastic. No longer than 5 minutes all Sunday.
---
salty survivors. Moria help the killer drastically, but people must realize that survivors will always win no matter what if you gen rush. (Unless it‚Äôs a god nurse)
---
Laurie would be tanning with Ace and Ash. Bill would be in line for cherryaid, or melted ice cream or bloody Watneys Red Barrel. Jane would be swimming, Jeff would be showing off his swimsuit body along with Meg and possibly Jake. David would be hitting on everyone he sees with no shirt on. Adam would be looking for plastic and other trash. Nea would be hiding somewhere with a sandball to throw at someone. Dunno about the rest
---
Shoulda let him hit you. lol
---
Honestly, probably less to do with your chase and more to do with not having a single kill with 1 gen left.
---
I think it's cool if you're active in the sub and don't just post videos like all the time. Space them out.
---
But yeah be active.
---
I'll be interested in seeing your video.
---
I wish they would change it back too. Not because I think it‚Äôs OP but because I‚Äôm tired of you guys acting like this a huge buff to NOED. Please change it back.
---
Quentin sleeps in the car.
---
Ok. So I should post it? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm currently super active, but it has nothing with me talking or promoting my channel so
---
You don‚Äôt remember playing at rank 20?
---
A lot of survivors are entitled and salty when they get outplayed or things don't go their way.
---
Billy players are entitled cunts. Prove me weong.
---
Yes and no, I think. Yes as in, you don't have to be amazing for Nurse to be your strongest Killer. If you're decent and you practice with her a bit, she will be your strongest. But I do think her skill barrier is quite high in the sense that her strongest plays require a lot of mechanical accuracy and also awareness/map knowledge.
---
Like how when you watch someone like Marth max-distance blink to some corner and hit a Surv he had no business knowing was there.
---
I actually think Hag may have a higher skill ceiling than Nurse. I've seen gameplay and discussed her tech with 2000+ hour Hag mains, the best ones in the game, and it's unbelievable how deep the thought process goes. I feel like you could take a college course on how to master her.
---
Nea and Jeff would be smoking weed under the pier
---
When you are staring in disbelief at a locker you clearly saw a survivor enter
---
Yes, Hag is no question the highest skilled killer. I think trapper is after that and then I don't really know
---
Makes sense. Completely forgot the "Ghostface Reveal" panel on that stream plan. I still hope there's a PTB though.
---
Yeah cuz running an ebony mori is such a good outplay
---
That's understandable. What I'm mentioning in particular was a match I had the other night. It was a p3 micheal. He downed a girl at the start and camped her and me being a wannabe hero I started antagonizing him hoping he would leave and chase me. He hit me 2 separate times and I just ran off and healed because he wouldnt leave the hook. Idk how this micheal got to p3 playing that way. In the end of the match the only person he got hooked at all was the first girl.
---
Well, so it's only on console then. Explains how I didn't know
---
Not to different from using MoM or Adrenaline tbh
---
Can you close the hatch on them if they use the key? I know it cancels their jump animation before EGC, will it interrupt the second?
---
Really nice dodging, especially since he had double cooldown, and thanks for not wasting god pallet there.
---
Not sure about that one. Isn‚Äôt it about 50k a web? So 38 webs would be almost 2 mil BPs
---
I was honestly expecting her to kill the one that was alone as if he was some kind of sacrifice
---
Yeah that's not really how killer works at all
---
This is my FLASHLIGHT!
---
I like that idea because it encourages playing every character on both sides AND you get a nice pay off after you put your share of time into the game.
---
I had an idea a while ago. One idea was that only level 1 perks show up in the blood web. Once you buy these perks you can level them up by putting bloodpoints directly into the perk to level it up to level 2 and 3. With this method there is still a bit of a grind but you don't have to put bloodpoints into perk that you don't want so there wont be any points wasted.
---
My second Idea was the same as the first but to level up perk you instead have to do challenges, kind of like call of duty was. If you want to get a perk to the pro version you had to do challenges with that perk, like BBQ and chili would be to down X amount of survivors after the aura was revealed with BBQ. Spirit fury could be to break a certain amount of pallets over your head...things like that.
---
I don't need a killer to spare me because of my team sucking ass and dying. You are the one who is narrow minded, who gives a fuck if your team screws you over? learn to take a loss like a fucking man. 
---
"Oh look at me I am such a nice guy for letting the last person live." what you think you gonna get brownie points? You're the idiot letting your kill get away because you think you should be nice to rivals in a game but if that's how you want to play more power to you.. just makes you look like a sissy killer. 
---
Might as well apply that logic to every game, but you don't lmao
---
You‚Äôre lucky, I had an ebony and as soon as I started moriing one guy the other 3 dced FeelsBadMan
---
Sorry you had to deal with assholes, that should never happen imo but to answer honestly, it's just unfun to play against most of the time.
---
People often get farmed off hook and tunnelled so they can be mori'd. It makes you feel like you wasted your time, and you're likely to de-pip as you probably didn't get much of a chance to actually play the game.
---
Nope. Dead game. ^^^^^^^^^/s
---
I play every killer.
---
The only benefit to a new killer main is that they can pick and choose which teachables to unlock so they have a less chance of bad perks showing up in their web, but no new killer is going to know to do that.
---
Who?
---
Cuz that sweet 0.20 extra blind time boiii
---
Your first sentence says it all. Believe me ‚Ä¶ I feel ya on that one. 
---
Some killers are just not my style no mater what I do. Look at Freddy. Most hate him and wanted changes. Me, I got him from day one and was really good with him while other characters like Billy do nothing for me because I'm not a run around the map type of guy. 
---
That's just how this game is. Killers shouldn't be for everyone, otherwise matches would be the exact same each time and without any diversity in play .. it will get boring fast. 
---
I also agree with the fun factor. I want you to escape ‚Ä¶ I just want to terrorize you and make you feel on edge the entire match. I said in another post, when I play as Myers, I play him as close to the movies as possible. I stalk like crazy. 
---
But at the end of the day we are at the mercy of the map. Regardless of who you play as. I know instantly how I need to play simply by looking at the gen placement. Which again, is why who I play as should match how *I play.*

I love how the devs even buffed the numbers with the EGC patch.
---
Oh man I just can't wait for Ghostface so I can join them.
---
Well he got 3 uses out of the mori, so he must've done something right to end those chases
---
Where can I find news about this freddy rework
---
Sweet Myers cosplay! What's the sign say?
---
Believe me when I say you're wrong about Hag. I don't play her at all, but I've seen the light.
---
Billy's only weakness is looping. If he can't rev the chainsaw quick enough, he's just a vanilla Killer at loops and it's one of the reasons Bamboozle is one of his best perks. Looping is Hag's greatest strength though, she gets to bypass that game much in the way Nurse does.
---
Hag actually can get a guaranteed insta-hit on any trap that's triggered. She has tech that forces Survivors to move off a loop with her traps because of what it does to their camera, and this means knowing where to put the trap and where the Surv will likely approach from.
---
In all likelihood, you've just never seen nor played against a Hag god yet. So your skepticism is warranted.
---
I cosplayed Bill on the Friday and Sunday, I do actually have a few photos of DBD cosplayers to upload but I shall do that tomorrow as I'm far too tired now.
---
You‚Äôre better at drawing with a mouse than I am irl
---
You‚Äôre the only person I‚Äôve seen say this, his power looks super fun
---
Are rank 20s the standard bearer of what's OP?
---
He existed to cause you pain, after your down he no longer had a purpose to exist therefore he stopped existing.
---
Ps4 hit boxes have been really bad lately too :/
---
üòè
---
Freddy is a 115 powerless killer lmao. Bubba can at least instadown
---
There seem to be a ton of games where the survivors force the killer to camp by trying to immediately unhook every single hook and just all staying on the area with the killer so it's not surprising.
---
I'll post the photos tomorrow but It says "Homeless war veteran, will loop killer for bloodpoints".
---
Yeah OP is the catalyst for all this. I thought they had an instaheal at first but they don't. Just low IQ moves altogether, there's nothing "unfortunate" about this.
---
poor trappy
---
both NOED and Blood Warden*
---
Can anyone explain how survivors not cleansing and staying broken 1hit downs makes her bad? I see people saying this all over this thread and any time she gets brought up and I just don't get it. 
---
Lok I understand that from a perspective of having an option between: 1) being broken, or 2) giving plague long range down power, the good survivors choose to stay broken as the better option.... But that's still leaving them broken and 1 shot how does that make her bad?
---
I think it's because most people aren't afraid of the killers anymore anyways. This is a game of serial killing parkour more than hide and seek now.
---
I can see it
---
Can‚Äôt he be both?
---
This is a pretty great solution tbh. I like the timer idea to give the last present survivor a chance
---
I guess megheads often like to hang out with them.
---
wait... üòÇüòÇ
---
wrong, but that's not so bad because it was a 50/50 and you took a shot in the dark
---
You must be great at parties.
---
Thanks for clarifying. I don't find your argument valid, but at least now I understand there really isn't anything I'm missing, you literally are just calling him bad for calling out swf that falsely accuse the killer of camping when they fuck around the hook.
---
And what if I told you this recording was of a previously captured instant replay? Stoopid.
---
I don't think so (not sure) since using the key automatically makes the survivor jump in as well
---
Yeah I am encouraging it. All of peoples points around how dcing is bad is pretty much not a reason in why I do it. I dont do it a lot it's just rare occasions. If I bring a purple toolbox and I get found first and camped I just cant stay. I dont see how in any circumstances that killers playing that way is fair. Honestly if I dont play because I stay hooked then it's kind of like I never even played a match yet I get punished and set back. If I can get a decent enough chance to do things then I dont care if I die and lose stuff. I just refuse to lose out when the only mistake I made was getting found first and going down. Honestly I'm not the type to leave if i get downed once or if it's a killer I dont like. I only do it if I feel like I'm forced to do it. I just think if I dont get to play I should keep my item and I would never have a reason to dc. It's super simple.
---
You‚Äôre really accurate he just want answers back to beef his ego
---
you didn't blurr the killer's name tho. that's actually against the third point of this subreddit's rules
---
If you interacted fast enough could you close it again before they land, or does the key trump that now? I'm just curious as there's no longer a grab so if the key has no counter then the survivor will always win the new EGC hatch stand off as long as they have a key.
---
Merely calling someone a dumbass doesn't meet the standard for harassment/disturbing the peace. It wouldn't even be enough for an intentional tort.
---
There's one up against the back wall
---
"They had us the first half not gonna lie"
---
Theres infinites in this game still? I played two years ago and just reinstalled and I dont buy that for a minute
---
By basement stalemate I meant when a killer blocks the basement without letting the survivors exit it, though I forgot that the newest patch notes said they fixed this, not sure how well they fixed it since I'm mostly a killer main and I'd never do that scummy mechanic,  but if that is fixed in all maps then I really hope the devs at least consider this idea.
---
*Ahem*
---
‚ÄúNow I understand there really isn‚Äôt anything I‚Äôm missing‚Äù
---
I mean, you‚Äôre clearly missing your brain. It‚Äôs sad I had to explain it to you so many times, and even more sad that you‚Äôre unable to comprehend why my response was valid.
---
Trapper.... :sniffle sniffle: is ....:sniffle sniffle: ...great all of the time!
---
TRAPPER MAINS UNITE!
---
10% rule, only 10% of your posts across all of reddit can be self-promotional. You have way too much across your profile and it can be considered spam.
---
The only viable thing to do on that map is 3 gen and if the survivors are halfway decent then you lose. 
---
Definitely not as bad as Thompson house but still.
---
I wouldn't call it a nerf, but more of a very pleasant rework
---
Why are you not researching/asking people about the next killer you‚Äôre going to buy? 
---
There‚Äôs no way you purchased something without doing any sort of information seeking, and then getting mad if you don‚Äôt like it.
---
They can open hatch in dying state too with a key
---
Direct repost of a 1k upvoted meme
---
I'd say nice try, but it really wasn't.
---
It depends, is it?
---
Dude the range is so short! Needs a buff please
---
Never called it a nerf haha
---
No they're not
---
I tried that last night and the prompt didn't appear.
---
Do you mean the meme MAKES you gay? I dunno buddy, are you homosexual? If not, quit getting defensive, that makes you look like a closet homo. Or homophobic. What‚Äôs wrong with being gay, again?
---
I call it like I see it. Sorry you got tilted.
---
Shit, I responded to the wrong comment
---
Move along, nothing to see here
---
Spirit's amazing tho. Just requires practice
---
&gt; I wish it was normal for someone to be trans.
---
Fucking wow.
---
I wish it was normal to fuck animals.
---
I literally preach about shirtless David every opportunity I can and I‚Äôve never been attracted to dudes. I don‚Äôt call him daddy or anything though. 
---
Even if it ‚Äúgay‚Äù, who cares? If you think it‚Äôs funny and want to meme about it, do it.
---
You gotta be on the right side I believe.
---
I like your idea, well thought out imo. Unsure if been mentioned but what if the killer took out everyone except the dced player, then downed the dc player. 
---
Proceeds to drop them until they fall off their shoulder and position it so they are stuck in a corner and body block them (hard but probably possible). They could then afk and do whatever they want and keep the dced player hostage. While i know dcing is pathetic and deserves punishment this feels a little too far, maybe a limit of 20-30 minutes or however long of dced will eventually kick you permanently from the game. Just order to stop this from happened
---
Frank smells pennies.
---
Fair
---
Im at rank 9 my dude.
---
Don't think that's really necessary. Speaking long term you'll unlock all the non licensed characters anyway at some point. And also playing a killer once or twice doesn't really tell you if you'll like a character. Worst case you can still level up the character and get their perks by grinding with another character. All of them have at least one desirable perk and that saves you a trip to the shrine (if that perk would ever appear there in the first place). 
---
In your case spirit fury is amazing for most killers.
---
Yeah, pig with enduring+spirit fury is just amazing.
---
But after he charges hes faster and hits with the chainsaw
---
False
---
Lol oh don't worry, I'm not tilted. Quite glad you've given up on the poor logic of your invalid argument and have fallen back into the classic form of forum communication, insults and mockery :)
---
There aren't. Some people just call good juke spots "infinites" for some reason.
---
A few very rare ones. Like the basement on Lampkin Lane, if the window spawns.
---
9. Literally every game I get people get slammed. Its not even just me doing bad. Its everyone in the games I play.
---
Because a killer who can't down survivors with his power can't be 4th place, he's a Wraith without stealth ( and yet you put Wraith the last ) and after he gets that first hit with Frenzy, he is as loopable as any other M1 killer. He is Frenzy speed is slower ( I literally saw survivors looping him in Frenzy because of how slow Frenzy speed is now ), his vault speed is also slower, his fatigue time is huge, you literally need to run Cold Dirt ( so he is add-on reliant ), his add-ons sucks all except cooldown and duration add-ons and he is just a joke in general.
---
Since height was important to mention I liked the idea of cliffs around the edges of the map into clouds rather than walls. I am aware of how that would make the edits look but it‚Äôs the entities realm so it doesn‚Äôt need to make perfect sense.
---
I think they can go ahead and nerf nurse right now. A killer that ignores every survival mechanic in the game is awful.
---
Just do your research mate, look up stuff on the killer/survivor you wanna buy BEFORE you buy it.
---
Because legion is terrible.
---
It‚Äôs the point of reddit to get good boy out pints. Even if it is virtual signaling, it‚Äôs a transphobic person, so who cares. Also it‚Äôs not like the name is unique or anything, so I doubt this post will be taken down. If it does I understand
---
You are supposed to report them ingame and mail them the video for additional proof, not post on reddit to shame someone (deserved or not).
---
Currently serving life for calling someone a poopy headed dildo. Pray for me.
---
I had a twitchy dc. And then 3 others. And then the last survivor a Claudette i let out. We were farming some BP becuz noone likes getting no points. I then let her get out. The twitchy is like you know your live. And then I'm like so what? He was like "your farming" and then i said "you dc'd"
---
It's come to my attention that I forgot to put The Plague on this list! My mistake, I'd put Plage at 6th Place (Amazing With Some Exceptions)
---
I mean anything can be memed tbh. Just because someone doesnt like it, doesnt mean its not funny. 9/11 memes are way worse than transphobic memes, but people laugh at those
---
I absolutely agree with this. I have half the killers at level 40 to unlock more perks but only 3 of them have any rank of BBQ, so I feel like it's a waste of time to play the other ones which is super frustrating.
---
She is not considered bad. She is just worse than nurse, billy and spirit because of her speed and loopability.
---
In my opinion it runs pretty well. I rarely have any bugs or glitches with it. As far as the player base I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs pretty big because I never have more than a 5 minute wait time. As far as DLCs they come out about the same time. Idk if it‚Äôs the exact same time but it‚Äôs close
---
Alright, thanks for the feedback. This was my first time making a perk build, I knew it wasn't the best.
---
Wait is she actually faster even without sprint burst?
---
Both unnatural. 
---
Stop virtue signaling.
---
Fair enough I dont get your logic either. In that Vein a exploit is just taking advantage of something to your benefit. Killers exploit camping. That's their right to do that correct? But if decide I'm in a match that's not exactly worth playing because people have to be asshole I cant leave? Screw me right? I'm being taken advantage of and it's okay to die on the hook and give the killer points but if I leave then its suddenly not okay? Seeing as i still try to last as long as possible so the team can get stuff done i dont really see who I'm hurting here? If i stay i see this as just hurting myself. I just want matches were people on the other side stop treating me like I'm just a bot. It's not okay to be a asshole. So if you say what I'm doing is wrong then that's just advocating camping and tunneling. They are strategies but they are asshole strategies.
---
Fair enough I definitely agree with that put I commonly see people going so far as to say she's among the worst killers, I think some one in this thread even said 3rd worst
---
They can and will die, so no, the killer is not holding the game hostage.
---
wait that's a thing holy shit I did definitely not know that
---
Wow finally figured out how to get a dang Gif up here
---
No that‚Äôs too hard, better complain on reddit
---
Ehhh haddonfield‚Äôs only really bad if a swf requests it via map offering imo, still annoying tho. But yeah ormond is awful.. I lose survivors due to bad scratch marks/aura readings almost as much as I do because of corn blindness
---
Definitely gay
---
I'd say accumulative temporary ban and bloodpoints gain penalty would be enough
---
Unless you're a p2w claudette.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve given no actual counter argument to my comments. Make it easy to affirm that you‚Äôre a moron. 
---
But I guess you will tilt as you will.
---
Why would anyone use New Reddit!?
---
The same could be said about almost any killer tho.
---
I am confused.
---
You got something for **free** and want a refund?
---
ah yes the blue hair nea
---
more insults, but ok I'll go back to your first common and smack ya with some logic.
---
I imagine David trying to build an extravagant sand castle and progressively gets more pissed off because the shenanigans of the other survs inevitably end with someone falling on his castle.   
---
Nea would be carving graffiti into the pier's legs during low tide.   
---
Quentin fell asleep after the first hour. The ice cream he was eating has fallen onto his chest. Everyone is afraid to do anything about it because poor Quentin is finally sleeping.   
---
Claudette is probably befriending a crab by the shoreline.   
---
Dwight is hiding under his umbrella because he already managed to get a sunburn.   
---
Jane is probably catching up on her tan while she reads a book.   
---
Kate is gathering wood for the bonfire she's going to make after sunset.   
---
These are all the ones I could think of.
---
The point of the build is for close-range tracking, so once you engage in a chase with a survivor, it's near impossible for the killer to escape.
---
"Problem is, you nerf the top two killers"
---
What? I didn't say anything about nerfing killers. All I said was that it was an issue to be addressed. I didn't say anything about how to address it. 
---
I agree that both killers and survivors should have a fair chance at winning. But it shouldn't be "I win if I pick nurse/billy and I lose if I pick anything else."
---
In a similar fashion for survivors, it shouldn't be "I lose if there's a Nurse/Billy, I win if they're anything else."
---
I definitely think there's a lot of balance that needs to be done, but I'm not the one to say exactly what needs to happen. I don't believe it's as easy as "nerf top killers and buff bottom killers" either. But I would like to see something done about it, because getting to the red ranks just feels unrewarding.
---
Every time a survivor disconnects (I a killer main) , laugh my ass off and scream ‚ÄúYou pussy!‚Äù
---
So you're buying followers/viewers essentially?
---
What colour was it?
---
The portion of games that are made of swf has nothing to do with the quality of the players in those swf groups. Simple logic, not hard to grasp. 
---
Complaining about the quality of play by those swf has nothing to do with how many games those swf are in. Also pretty easy to comprehend, and utterly reveals your reasoning as poor and invalidates your argument.
---
Sorry logic triggers you!
---

thats true, i wanna try this build tbh im gonna

I thank you for your service soldier ~
---
Having a discussion is hard, better complain about the post and contribute nothing useful.
---
Sorry, I mean that it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
You cannot grab the survivor out of jumping into the hatch anymore, ever. 
---
You can't close it either, as soon as they begin the opening/jumping in animation the prompt for closing the hatch won't appear till they are finished with the animation.
---
thank you all for the feedback i just get very offensive when uncultured weebs insult the memes of this beautiful "sometimes toxic" community
---
side note i ain't gay i'm as straight as it gets
---
Yeah for some reason it‚Äôs computer players. This means cross-play is gonna be very toxic.
---
I know that's what I should do. I just for some reason dont want to let people die like that. I dont like when it happens. I know I need to just stop and do gens but every once in a while I'm successful at freeing people without getting myself hooked to
---
Ah ok, in that case I agree
---
ok
---
Just cause it's a repost doesn't mean I don't want to see it again and so what if it's a low effort meme? Some good memes come from low effort just like bill gates says ["I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find a easy way to do it"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job)
---
Either purple or pink
---
OP cant even proc deliverance anymore
---
Great. They need to bring back the grab to at ieast enable mind games when that happens.
---
That‚Äôs kinda dumb. I just thought the video they were stuck in an animation while they hopped in.
---
Why can‚Äôt I play against teams like this...
---
Then it must not work or it‚Äôs a bug
---
I mean, it‚Äôs very obvious you didn‚Äôt watch gameplay of her. 
---
I would‚Äôve said the same thing no matter what killer you ‚Äúwasted‚Äù your shards on.
---
TIL: there are people out there who genuinely enjoy hearing/seeing the same joke over and over
---
No, thats not quite what dedicated servers will do. Im not quite sure exactly how they work, but lag switching wont be a thing and hopefully ping will get fixed a bit better. Lag will still exist but it will be shared equally among survivors and killers.
---
This was garbage the first time it was posted not much has changed
---
It doesn't make her bad. That's just idiots spreading false info
---
Okay, Hope it goes well! I should mention that if you haven't you should look at the changes to the add-on's I made, and the longer list of staying away from corrupt intervention!
---
That face is terrifying
---
Survivors have no specific advantages apart from each other. Other than Dwights being 500% more likely to be given hatch
---
I haven‚Äôt played DBD in weeks (months?) cos of this. I pretty much only play killer and I got tired of being accused of cheating when really it‚Äôs just poorly P2P desync.
---
I've been on both ends of this "accidental sandbagging" before. All it takes is a couple messages to clear things up.

Lmaooooo ü§£ü§£ü§£

Did a few perkless-addonless killer games today (mostly Trapper) and got quite a few 2k-4k. Post game chats were pretty wholesome as well :)
---
yes i know i read that, thank u
---
shitty meme
---
Ah thank ya
---
No, sorry if I used the wrong term. I mean the splinter offerings or whatever. They already have them for e.g. Freddy, LF, Micheal... I'm talking about Doc, Hag, Spirit, etc. They *used* to have them for the latter group, but disabled it. I'm saying they should re-enable it.
---
ya i cost more than 25$ sweetie, also i like how this is your first post in months on this subreddit and its just a shameless self promotion.
---
I love you that called them heroes. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
---
Ok if you are sandbagging by accident you feel bad so you message but if you are accidentally sandbagged you have to be nice or you look like an A hole
---
Dude I'm still working towards getting enough for Plague
---
wait why is the remake nightmare on elm street here and the og Freddy in the game is based on the 2010 movie
---
It looks a bit *_CORRUPTED_*
---
So you're telling me you don't laugh at a story/joke that you or a friend have already told? So you just sit there not laughing cause you've already heard it? Nah I bet you still laugh cause even tho you've hear it before you still laugh, same applies for movies
---
Why is this downvoted...? #left4head
---
...the joke is that he's saying *Bill* is the odd man out..
---
feral frenzy is just dead hard at full power
---
I don‚Äôt see where it is that we were fighting. I understand how frustrating playing killers can get by the people that I watch, and by seeing asshole survivors get out of situations through broken means (old DS being the main one). So while I may not have hands-on frustration levels, I can definitely see some things from the killer‚Äôs perspective, just from an outside one.
---
&gt;enable mind games
---
There is no mind game, they either use the key and you grab them out of the animation or they do nothing and get impaled by entity as endgame collapse timer is ticking.
---
In a situation when you kill 3 people and find the hatch before the last guy, the last guy gets to escape. That's really situational and keys don't need to be weaker.
---
It is perfectly fine the way it is.
---
Once all the pools of devotion are used they reset so they can‚Äôt stay corrupt forever unfortunately :/
---
I thought you can't grab them out of the animation anymore?
---
This is how I feel about plague I hate her.... I'd fully give her stupid ass back... shes just not fun to me. But spirit.. when i first bought i liked her then i hated her didnt play her for like a month then picked her up again, I'm glad I gave her a second chance shes fun and has very good addons.
---
Really? For me it's the opposite, suffocation pit is really big and hard to control generators on, it's also really hard to catch them in the middle where there is 47 connected jungle gyms. Coal tower is not very large and there isn't any super strong loop other than the shack or the coal towers window with balanced landing
---
Its a good idea to let people disconnect but i think after 30 mins you should be able to start a new game so the killer can't just hold you hostage by not killing you.
---
Ah true
---
It was my drawing üòÇ I gave him permission but he felt bad so he took it down. Its all good man.
---
I can agree on the magic wearing off after the first time cause it's true but that doesn't mean you still don't enjoy hearing it or laughing on the inside.
---
So you're telling me that you don't hangout with multiple/two friends at a time and talk about stuff or mention something funny, then what do you do then, sit there in silence while they're present? Even tho it may not happen all the time it still happens and just denying is just hilarious cause you're telling me you don't laugh at a retold joke or story and it's complete BS unless you're some edgy 14yr old tryna act tough, live a little dude, laugh at stuff you don't have to hold it in cause 'you've heard it before' it's also just a nice gesture to laugh at something you've heard before regardless how many times, sure it's not that funny but you at least give out a little ha ha cause it's just plain rude not to when someone is trying to make a joke or tell a funny story.
---
Ah, I guess I could have worded that better.
---
This line showcases a situation in which the grab is brought back. The survivor can't really do anything in that situation, they can't use the key, they just die either from you grabbing them or just the timer running out.
---
My argument is that key item is really situational and basically a gamble, so once you get into a situation where that gamble pays off, you shouldn't be denied the payoff.
---
Stars really have to allign for this situation to happen, 3 survivors have to die, the last guy has to be using the key, the killer has to find the hatch before them AND they have to basically run into them around the hatch after closing it.
---
Hey, attacking megs isn't allowed. Megs are very wholesome and sweet :)
---
Ah I get ya, thanks for clarifying.
---
lucky as hell was this before endgame collapse?
---
I doubt It, the name isn‚Äôt unique, and was probably trying to get my attention. It‚Äôs probably changed, but if this post is deleted then I‚Äôm fine it with, I understand. People post nicknames of other people all the time
---
This is my favorite art style so far. Reminds me of stitch
---
It is a huge grind, as I have a few people prestige on both sides, and working on my last survivor teachables. I personally think the grind is perfectly reasonable, as it's pretty easy to get what you want on 2 or 3 characters, but quite difficult to get it on most or all.
---
Do you not experience horrible frame drops? Most games I can crank the settings but I have to keep dbd on low.
---
That is a rather large middle school
---
I wish I could enter there and wait to be moried there against Freddy.
---
What is this clip from?
---
The cosmetics arent required so like it doesnt really matter. Although they are cool to have it really does nothing to help you

Yeah I just meant the one that ended up being Jigsaw lol

We'll Make it Caps your healing speed at 100% on others, so Botany Knowledge and medkits don't do anything. You can still benefit from using them on yourself, though.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
---
yep seems about right
---
Never knew freddy was interested in that industry. I guess he wanted to release some stress after all of the entity displeased
---
I don't know why you think it's obvious because I've probably watched at least 2 hours of each killer many of whom I have absolutely no intention of buying.  
---
You are being obtuse if you think that I went into buying the killer with no prior knowledge
---
"The portion of games that are made of swf has nothing to do with the quality of the players in those swf groups. "  
---
The portion of players has to deal with how often the poster would have to deal with this issue they're bringing up. They're getting accused of camping and saying, based on their title, that the gameplay and accusations come from SWF groups. When actually, if they're receiving these messages often, it's got a lot less to do with SWF and more to do with the player base in general. Meaning that their title, which was a snipe at SWF groups, was unwarranted.    
---
"Complaining about the quality of play by those swf"  
---
Except most of the people the OP is talking about aren't actually SWF. Killer mains just like to cry about SWF because they know it'll get upvotes, and they like to ignore the reality that 4 man SWF's are rare, and thye're just bad at the game. If people are calling OP a camper, then most of them are solo players. In fact (looking at the meme now), if someone is being stupid enough to chase the killer *around* the hooked survivor instead of *away* from the hooked survivor, it's more likely both survivors aren't voice chatting together, because one would tell the other to chase the killer *away* so someone else can rescue him. Another indication that the title was unwarranted.

Are you don't making a fool of yourself today?
---
Oh darn, you got spanked anyway.
---
Who the fudge downvoted your comment, like, your just saying facts!
---
Seriously, get on it artists.
---
Now that you say it, I all I see is stitch üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It isn't, it's a glitch
---
Thank christ
---
Definitely Save the best for last, it's great on her. Besides you can use MYC, Nurse's Calling, M&amp;A, Corrupt intervention, Hex: Haunted Ground(only with ruin) or Devour Hope/Huntress lullaby for memes :) With Spirit the only perk you really need is ruin. Other are just quality of life.
---
happened to me with Jane. i was sticking through the side.
---
Who would have thought when everyone stays in the basement and then runs at you 1 at a time, you get to kill them
---
No it stacks, or at least it did a couple of months ago
---
Shit. I was thinking about that, and I don't know why  thought it worked like that, them staying corrupted would be OP as fuck lol.
---
Its bad everywhere. Its also latency
---
I love it lmao
---
This did put a smile on my face.
---
Can't tell if the title is serious or not, but regardless, it literally does have no counter for M1 killers.
---
DBD is the worst optimized game I have ever played in my life. NOTHING will give me a steady framerate. Nothing
---
I just saw that opening today and was wondering what's behind there
---
You too üòä
---
Why rancor tho?
---
&gt;"laugh at stuff you don't have to hold it in cause 'you've heard it before'"  
---
I'm sorry, I guess. I just don't laugh at things I don't find funny, even if I found it funny the first time. Like, I'll smile if I recognise that a person is *trying* to be funny, but I won't laugh at things that don't amuse me.  
---
&gt;"live a little dude"  
---
Because I'm an incredibly boring person for not having the same sense of humour as you do, and I have no idea what fun is or how to have it.  
---
&gt;"it's just plain rude not to when someone is trying to make a joke or tell a funny story"  
---
Unless they've told it to me before, which they would know since I'm willing to bet a bucket of ice cream that they were there when they told me it. It'd be pretty freaky if they weren't.  
---
I am sinking way too much time into a conversation with someone who actually finds repeated jokes funny. I'm gonna call it quits here. Have a good life, bud.
---
What if the DCer goes off and on Dead by daylight?
---
It actually breaks my pork heart...
---
LMAO LEGION HIGHER THAN HAG LMAOOOOOO
---
It's adorable! Rin.. she grew so fast murdering and slashing ‚ù§Ô∏è good job buddy
---
I don‚Äôt think anybody but Dead Hard users would actually care much.
---
43503945 traps is so dumb...
---
You can't use any item when you're in the dying state.
---
Ikr! It's like how dare you loop me to infinity, you little twerp lol.
---
DC in loading screen if you see a mori... not hard to tell which one it is.
---
Lol you're trying so hard to force this shit post into your poor logic and it's really making you look like the fool.
---
He's complaining about how swf act, that is not contingent upon how frequently he plays against swf at all. That alone makes your whole argument fall apart. It's a shame you're having so much trouble comprehending that.
---
Thrill of the hunt, Devour hope, Haunting Grounds, Ruin.
---
Russian Roulette of totems!
---
I think it's from the movie "Mama".
---
So why tf do people disconnect? They don‚Äôt get any bloodpoints and they could just as easily kill themselves to buy time for the rest of us?
---
I think the battle pass thing is more of for a reward system to keep you playing. I can even say, for a person that plays this game for his life. Once you get your people max level it gets boring. And its just farming
---
I‚Äôm mortified. Ironically, I heard this movie was hot trash.
---
This is why people need to start appreciating rank 1 pigs like myself
---
He looks so dumb when revving when revving his chainsaw I feel embarassed he caught me xD
---
Once the wall hack perks are removed from killer side expect a lot less DC's... until then, play the game fairly and maybe that shit won't happen.
---
Killers have enough shit going for them now that survivors have been nerfed in to the ground, the stats also showed killers win more games than survivors so until there are some drastic changes, it's going to be a thing.
---
Oh I love a good spanking, but your attempts are just pitiful
---
Are people really scared of getting moried this bad?
---
It‚Äôs those thighs girlüçñ
---
Same goes for that Dwight
---
The Huntress got some big tittiesüòç
---
Keys can be so bullshit sometimes
---
*devour hope has entered the chat*
---
I haven't seen it all the way through. Just a cheep jumpscare movie from what I did see though.
---
masochist
---
DAE play DbD and experience this thing that just naturally happens as part of the game's progression?
---
The area upstairs above the bathroom.
---
tbh, i think it was way creepier for the killer rather than for the survivor
---
Honestly i think its more of skill. But nurse takes. Alot of skill to use(to use efficiently) but i can have countless 4k's with wraith(with the right perks and addons) but then again we can dispute this forever
---
:)
---
In what way was Ruin buffed, you dumbass?
---
I play both sides, survivor more than killer tbh (though I prefer killer. More stressful though), but here's one thing your inbred self doesn't understand: A time wasting perks for survivors is automatically higher in magnitude of all survivors can use it. Because as one survivor pulls it off while taking up the killer's time (for nothing noteworthy. Literally just getting M1'd), the others are working the objective uncontested. Couple that with multiple having that and you have a balance nightmare. You don't understand game balance one bit. 
---
Also DS isn't at all worthless, and you're a fucking moron if you think so. They just made a good prerequisite for its application. Adrenaline won't get touched either. At most, it'll maybe be a 3 second speed burst instead of 5, but even that is unlikely.
---
unfun to play against
---
Gg buddy sorry you couldn't handle an argument and remember to live a little :)
---
Ps you can laugh at stuff you seen before stop being so grumpy mr. "I can only laugh at something once cause the second time I hear it it's not funny in the slightest"
---
I once switched to the lowest graphics quality and somehow my frame rate went down... how does that work?
---
Dwight is splashing in the water
---
Meg, david, adam and feng are playing beach volleyball.
---
Nea is prob smoking a joint with laurie or jeff
---
Tapp is bbq‚Äôing and or trying to find that weed smell.
---
Kate and jane are sunbathing
---
Ash and ace are drinking beer with each other prob with tapp
---
Quentin is sleeping under the canope
---
Jake is prob sitting in the water looking at the ocean
---
And have some slightly more competent teammates.
---
I go with the effective (if boring) BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's, and Sloppy.
---
The only one I'll bother explaining is Nurse's. 28 meter auras, 24 meter terror radius that they can't hear the whoosh inside. See an aura, move a few steps closer while looking away and making it not super obvious you're coming for them. Now they can't hear you phase and may think you're heading somewhere else.
---
it did, but not anymore, WMI even says in the description that it caps the healing at 100% and you can't benefit those 33% from BK
---
I thought this was fr fr and i was reading it and was like wtf. And then realized it was a joke
---
She grew into such a lovely murderer! They grow up so fast!
---
Reddit is kind of a cesspool of people who don't possess independent thoughts, so the only thing they can do is downvote comments they might not agree with or that otherwise sound like they stray from the norm.  
---
If they were to make users' votes public, I imagine people who do this would go away, as downvoting stuff that isn't detrimental to the website as a whole (i.e. trolling and other things that break rules) is literally against the rules of the site and can get you shadow-banned if you're caught doing it too much.  
---
All in all, though, I don't really care about karma. It's fake Internet posts. The only time I care is if I catch sight of a user whose total karma is negative. That kind of thing interesting.
---
Monto, hybridpanda, Scottjund, farmer John and noob3
---
Monto isn't a streamer, but a youtuber. His content is pretty enjoyable and he rarely ever complains, if at all. I also learned a lot from him 
---
Hybridpanda is really fun to watch and he is super wholesome. Completely avoids camping and tunneling even if it costs him the match. Also really helpful for beginners. Overall awesome guy :) 
---
Scott is pretty good at the game, pretty entertaining and memes around(also plays wholesomely) I like him :D
---
Farmer John does not have many videos but his videos are ones you can relax and watch 
---
Noob3 is very good at survivor and his videos are very entertaining and well edited. Overall a cool guy 
---
I don't watch these but apparently cahla is really cool and zubat is nice 
---
(sorry if this was really long)
---
For camping I think it's Hillbilly. He looks like and idiot  facecamping when revving his chainsaw and I can't watch it. Also camping-crouching Pigs, I don't know why but they always look like a complete noob.   
---
For tunneling it must be Freddy, I don' know why, but I just hate being tunneled by him. Another one is Nurse. Like, she's so powerful she can afford going for the savior and let me get some gen points.  
---
For survivors, I really like Ace, but I HATE toxic Aces, they trigger me so much. Same with Quentins.
---
Devs wanting to buff a killer, nice one
---
Would just like to point out in these times of constant DC complaining that not all DC's are from ragequitting as people seem to belive
---
I quite often actually get random chrases in DBD and many people just plainly suffer from bad internet
---
Monitor, Surveillance, Discordance, Ruin + Prayer Beads and Mother Daughter Ring üòâ
---
Only arguement I could possible agree with is wraith a bit higher.
---
‚ÄúPuke on me mommy!‚Äù
---
I did not either. Thanks.
---
I reposted my own post which was first a link, second a image, third a link to a gif, and now finally I‚Äôve figured it out... my apologies I‚Äôm new hereüôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Now I want a belly dancer cosmetic for Huntress :/.
---
HER FACE, I'M SCREAMING
---
ShItPoSt
---
I think blade and soul beats DBD in terms of being horribly optimized
---
Wasn't it because it activated too often during chases and was too distratcting or something?
---
Cue the opening scene of Scream 2 where everyone in the theater is wearing Ghostface masks and screaming excitedly.
---
You have spirit in A tier but Hillbilly in S tier?
---
Only if they can distiguish between bad connection/game crash and a deliberate DC
---
Weird seeing you in the wild
---
Yes. Spirit is harder to play with less of a reward.
---
Neither did they
---
i don't find it horror but it's worth watching, i cried more instead of getting scared, it's really sad
---
The exteriors looks like they are made of plaster, and they probably have a plastic base against the face.
---
How would you say it's balance around swf if the only killer may do something against them is Nurse? That's not balance my dude/dudess.
---
[here you go!](https://imgur.com/a/i2c089K) we were taking pictures in a large public park so there‚Äôs occasionally kids doing cartwheels and shit in the background lmao
---
If you have the Surveillance perk (from the Pig), you might want to give it a try. I use it to pull people off gens straight out of invisibility.
---
I usually use a couple tracking perks, and avoid pallet management perks since you can mindgame pallets instead.
---
Her purple add ons are generally seen as stronger than her pink ones, but I guess it depends on your play style. The Prayer Beads can make the Spirit one of the most powerful killers in the game.
---
Myers is most definitely A tier.
---
So you actually believe he came here to make a complaint about 6% of the games he‚Äôs in?
---
You ACTUALLY believe that? 
---
Because if you do, I feel very sad for you.
---
r/punpatrol hands on your head!
---
Against bad survivors, even Freddy is op.
---
And why?
---
The only argument I'd have would be putting leatherface in C tier. and also, Freddy's not D tier, he's F tier for Freddy
---
lmao there‚Äôs a pic of me crouching with UE in mind in the link i just posted
---
Yep, I've found changing the quality does absolutely nothing for the fps, just makes it look even more shit
---
I only have one prayer beads and ring offeringüò≠
---
Since 2.6.2 We'll Make It has a cap of 100% healing increase.
---
How dare you escape his hits.
---
Bubba should be a tier
---
I‚Äôve seen hybrid panda do that build but I‚Äôm not the most skilled killer so I think I‚Äôll get stomped on üò≠
---
Not a mental disorder according to literally all of science bruv
---
I played against a Spirit running this, with purple and pink add ons. After she killed everyone else and closed the hatch, I was lucky to open the gate and escape. It was a rough match.
---
Nah if you clear out the pallets and know how to mind game with his chainsaw, with some charge time addons, he can be really really good.
---
Excellent idubbbz crossover
---
Happened to me with Bill before. His empty pistol holster was sticking out the front/side of the Locker.
---
Ruin, BBQ/Monitor and Abuse, Surveillance, and Nurse‚Äôs Calling/Discordance
---
Because he has massive snowball potential. Especially with BBQ or shit your pants
---
Hmmm don‚Äôt like this gif, no sir
---
cant unsee hill billy
---
Eh, high B is the highest I can put him because of his reliance on charge time addons.
---
Well they did say in the developer stream that they were looking into things they could buff about her after the nerf to her endgame traps, but maybe that was just something they said to keep us happy....
---
Assuming you are not going to run Prayer Beads every match, you should use STBFL + BBQ + Nurse + Ruin, NOED or another perk of your choice.
---
If you have the faster charge addons and speed those will work well as you can hit with STBFL and quickly phase walk and hit them again.
---
Big Cringe right here
---
"Trans people and dog fuckers are the same"
---
Like wew lad
---
That's true and false
---
Noed is basically the panic button but has several weak points. You'll run 3 perks the whole game which is more impactful for the killer compared to survivors having 3 perks (asymmetrical game) and can be disabled before it even come into play
---
Noed don't need a Nerf but totems need two buffs instead, 1 better place locations since you can find them very easily if you don't tunnel vision just gens and more bp and obj point to incentives survivors to find them
---
Noed at best gives you 1 kill, that's it. If the guy who has noed get more than 1 kill just for that perk is the survivors fault because you are either still trying to save the guy knowing the killer has noed and get mad if getting caught or not playing more careful when you know he has it.
---
I stopped using noed after 1 month of play time for how useless it is. It gets instantly cleansed if it even activates and it's decent only against very unskilled survivors. When I'm against noed I laugh while I cleanse it or notice he had it when it never activated.
---
Noed don't need a Nerf at all, just learn how to play around it since every killer I've seen running it is kinda bad
---
Thicc thighs save lives
---
Gardevoir and Gallade, huh?
---
It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs meant to be. üòç
---
I feel sad that you believe that to be honest
---
*In the wild*
---
As if I'm a pokemon or something. 
---
*insert *is a snorlax* joke here
---
Aww I love how big her ears are :)
---
M&amp;A, Ruin, BBQ, (Chase, Exposed or Aura perk)
---
16m terror radius when out of chase to give the jump on most unaware survs that don't have LOS.
---
BBQ for aura reading
---
Ruin to slow the game down. 
---
Last perk slot for another aid perk, as Spirit can mindgame at most pallets, using enduring to not respect is a good choice, or using Nurses as you will have a 28m range with a 16m terror radius.
---
Spirit is much easier to hit with than Hillbilly, because she can counter pallets.
---
Also Ash Williams from Ash VS Evil Dead is kind of a thing.
---
I‚Äôd guess they‚Äôd focus on his invulnerability, maybe give him a short period where he can‚Äôt be stunned after activating his power.
---
Wait you actually think spirit is easier to play than Billy? Or is this just a good meme.
---
