Shh, please ignore the bait. Maybe he will stop.

---
I've never had that before. I don't understand why you'd do that anyway, it's just a Legion.
---
I think you mean "amir tofu, bazinga, piggly wiggly"
---
Most people don‚Äôt care to argue with someone over the internet. So the only people you have commenting are the ones with really strong opinions that oppose yours. Also, again, how does people having different opinions relate to fucking McCote?
---
It's so dumb, there's literally no point to legions existence anymore, whereas pigs ability is actually useful
---
As someone who consistently gets red survivor and purple rank killer (not that rank means that much, just giving what context I can) I find killer a lot harder. Survivor is mostly just pallet looping and hoping your team can hit ruin skill checks.
---
Oh, I thought the wiggle bar thing was part of one of the new oni perks lol.
---
Yep, this is pretty much how it happened. It started with Michael, then leatherface, and just snowballed from there.
---
See, this is a prime example of what I'm talking about.
---

---
Someone who can't even think for themselves and thinks everything the devs do is always perfect.
---
Gens get done way too fast with just a 3-man SWF. Imagine 4 all working on gens at the same time. No way.
---
No, because 3 seconds is way too long.
---
This is beautiful, I'm away from my PC so may I ask, did you use David with a beard???
---
thats a thing as well, but there is an exploit to hit over a dropped pallet also. Some people abuse it
---
I love how it got the nsfw tag (I mean understandable but you can‚Äôt see anything)
---
Wow, that was a journey. And I was only like 15 posts down.
---
On the contrary, people LOVE to argue with each other. I know this fact from experience.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with sucking them off? They provide us good content and hours of entertainment, the least we can do is a quick BJ
---
I‚Äôve bitched about PS4 not able to use mouse and keys for years. Downvoted to oblivion. 
---
Oni launch. Everyone wants PS4 to have mouse and keys now. 
---
The community is just autistic. They contradict themselves all the time for the sake of hive mind  internet points.
---
Favorite thing about playing Billy is tricking survivors into thinking I'm about to chainsaw away and then just flicking right towards them
---
I see what your saying but I just disagree
---
ok gamer
---
Right? 
---
I'm thinking 5 v 25
---
I play survivor primarily because I like getting jump scared and spooked. I like being on the edge of my seat üòä
---
I thought the same lol
---
Yeah, but Billy runs faster with his power and it can be used any time.
---
Does left behind show the aura of closed hatch as well?
---
The fucking statues, man
---
If you wanna play in high ranks ruin is necessary if not freddys good,spirits good, pig is kinda a stealth killer like gf
---
Patch testers ‚Äúthis seems fine‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd get bubba for bbq
---
maybe you are casting too big a net, you have to interrupt the survivors flow, hook one person after having them downed
---
I... It isn't though. EGC was active therefore the Nea would've eventually died.
---
Regardless of if ruin is your cup of tea, you need to run it unless you luck into trashcans every game my guy.
---
Killer finds you first and hooks you in basement, instantly breaking your game
---
because you get points by denying them points
---
Buu is one of my favorite villains tbh
---
I agree, the survivor adepts are so much easier. I killed all 4 survivors numerous times and had to redo because I didn't achieve merciless killer.
---
Obviously you've never taken a look at this subreddit for more than a minute
---
Sounds like it deserves to abused to the fullest then.  I'll run it all night.  Hope to get you in my game.
---
True, I keep forgetting how much bait there actually is on this sub lol
---
I want him as a killer omg
---
I saw getting out fix it a few times, and it did for me, but u just watched a streamer make it across the map glitched so you're right. That's kind of wild.
---
Killer picking you up still seems to fix it though.
---
Because the community didn't used to be this way. It pains me to start seeing it degrade into a cesspool of circle jerking.

Either refund everyone who bought him, or completely change his ability

yes but then you encourage people to swf rather than solo play, i¬¥d rather not punish someone for not playing with voice chat
---
i have bubba tho
---
How did you only find 2 survivors but still get the 4K?
---
her perks are great, her blood perk is very useful and her other 2 perks are fun and not useless. I dont really care about how loud she is, bring iron will if its an issue though
---
I'm not really a fan of pharmacy, sure that 80% faster and quieter is nice but I'd have to give up a comfort perk and a chest that could have something more preferable in exchange
---
Yeah now they‚Äôre just mad ü•∫
---
damn so hag?

This keeps happening to me and throwing games plz fix :(

I didn‚Äôt get my hopes too high, still kinda disappointing though. And it‚Äôs no problem! It‚Äôs good to let others know, always think about your purchases!

---
Sort by hot. Look in a comment section. Mostly everyone likes the post.
---
Your logic says people who like the post will upvote and move on whereas only the people who don't will comment. This isn't what happens at all.
---
Oh boy There'll be some lethal combos. Imagine plague and ghostface. He'll get perma instadowns so people will be forced to cleanse, giving plague her power
---
I mean, this isn't just a single conversation, right? Because there are two aspects to playing: mechanical play and tactical play. Killers are much harder than survivors to play tactically, because they're forced to make moment to moment decisions of what to do. Breaking a chase, switching targets, going for a kick, slugging, where to patrol - these are all tactical choices that the killer makes. Survivors have a much smaller pool to choose from. Basically just do gens, hide, or altruism. If they're being chased, they run - no decisionmaking allowed until the killer stops chasing them for whatever reason.
---
Mechanically, survivor seems much harder to play. I'm a red rank killer and when I play survivor I can't loop for *shit*. I've seen all kinds of tricks, both from people I play against and streamers like Fungoose, and there's nothing more mechanically challenging in this game than looping a good killer for a long time. The difference between a survivor that knows how to loop and one that doesn't is night and day. It's like trying to catch a ghost. 
---
The question of which is harder to play comes down to what kinds of things you're doing more frequently: making tactical decisions, or executing them (mechanics). Since the killer is permanently in high stress mode from the start of the game, I would lean that direction. There's no autopilot for the killer; no breaks. As a survivor as long as spine chill doesn't light up or I don't hear the heartbeat, I can sit on a gen and just hold my mouse button occasionally hitting spacebar. 
---
I don't think killer is that much harder if at all, though. I think it's 400% more stressful, but not very much harder.
---
Legion‚Äôs power got buffed and in exchange got synergy with his best perks destroyed.

Her blood perk is useless as killers can track you with your sound, scratch marks, and if they just have good awareness in general. The pallet one is just a meme like Diversion since killers just break the pallets asap. The only moderately decent perk is Breakout

This entire thread is some wholesome. I love it. I apologize in advance for beating you into the dirt if we cross paths, workin' on them Archive Challenges.
---
The menu music is pretty good too
---
but thats another major flaw in legions kit. legions power makes you want to hit as many people as possible during frenzy but you cant down anyone during frenzy which means you cant capitalize on the tempo you should have gained by deep woundsing everyone
---
Yeah, so long as you‚Äôre the last Survivor doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs open or closed.
---
New Legion nerf.
---
The weak hatchet throw to the Nea on the ground has SENT ME lmaooooo. Also fuck teabaggers, be as petty as you want.
---
Yep, thanks for proving my point. You're just part of the circle jerk as well.
---
"It's not much, but it's an honest job."
---
How does one farm a survivor?
---
You're just going to get downvoted for being right.
---
2 second search is amazing tbh. and not even counting charge addons on the green medkit.
---
Thanks. I just feel your pain. If I wasnt so addicted to the adrenaline rush the game gives, I would stop playing this game. Also the friends I met playing swf make the game way more enjoyable.
---
I would love to see 2 killers vs 8-10 survivors or something so I can kwf without suffering through the broken custom match.
---
Cause 3 second stun = just straight up murdering the killer
---
they figured too many people would abuse it, especially SWF with *i won't let this random unhook me so i'm gonna use the kick mechanic to prevent him and let my friend do it instead*
---
Quentin.
---
/thread
---
Take off hook right in front of killer
---
This kinda makes me want a 3rd person killer mode though lol.
---
I don't remember my set up but it took me 2 days. Its very situational. Especially now with Oni available and his tracking perks/add-ons.
---
You must have Spine Chill. I know I had Urban, I think I had Inner Strength and Iron Will. Maybe I had Poised instead of IS...
---
Either way, you must play immersed. You're best bet is not to be found, to stay out of chases and hide, get safe rescues and gens while the killer is far enough away you have a chance to hide. 
---
Of course when I was trying to get this, I started every single game near the killer and had no chance at not being first hooked. 
---
Alternatively you could see if the killer is cool enough to farm the game and just not hook you.
---
Eh. At least I‚Äôm not getting my organs harvested for political unrest.
---
First of all, I've disagreed with the devs plently of times before and I talk about this stuff all the time on my inner circle of friends that play DbD. I just haven't posted much on Reddit lately.
---
Second of all, I genuinely think that Freddy is in a good place right now... he's not as weak as he was before the rework but he's not overpowered either. He's fair while still being strong enough to keep pressure on the gens (his gen teleporting ability really helps).
---
I am confusion.
---
 BaLaNcE
---
This looks like it was taken on-set. Holy
---
Just before, played against a whole team of new friends in the game, wrecked them hard, wanted to give escape to the last 2, dropping them in front om gens,  they didn't catch the hint. Even the last ran away instead of healing his friend while I was just standing there. Tried to give him the hatch but he wouldn't stop wiggling and running out... 
---
Welp he found it himself after running the entire map with me behind.
---
Yeah it sound like it.
---
Well that's kinda dumb tho 
---
(JK BTW)
---
TIL that people sharing opinions means they‚Äôre circlejerking, Thanks for enlightening me
---
Yeah me too, feelsbadman
---
Uguuu, harder Daddy!!
---
Again?
---
Its preventing gameplay.
---
Some streamer got a killer banned for it recently.
---
Half of the bugs would never occur if they learnt how to code properly and fixed whatever the everloving spaghetti fuck they have.
---
They have been ‚Äútrying‚Äù for what years and still havent fixed time old bugs. Yet they have time to release shitty rifts with the same recoloured charm 6 times.
---
I've played 7 games and no oni :(
---
Ok, personal experience. When I play killer I usually don‚Äôt care who gets the hatch but, if I had to choose between a survivor who ran me around, made saves, and actually played the game vs. a survivor who urban evaded around the map and focused more on not getting spotted than completing the game or being a team player. I know who I‚Äôm choosing to sacrifice. 
---
While the goal of the game is to escape or get a 4K. The events leading up to it are supposed to be fun, intense, and challenging. If I give you the hatch, congratulations you gave me a fun and challenging match.
---
They should add a hole in the wall that simply drops down onto the staircase along with the normal path.
---
Me when surveillance goes off
---
I‚Äôve been let go for playing Meg and Dwight
---
Make your own memes. Like at least crop the meme to make it look like you ripped it right off of Google images.
---
Also if it's a Nea the weapon stays with her to the end of the match and she becomes the killer
---
What does that have to do with the developers? wtf
---
I'm personally tired of playing against him!! Lol. Its like every game
---
Now I just need good teammates that can do gens
---
Nobody on reply to either post said he was balanced. They said he was the opposite of what my post said he was.
---
Making a stun perk that functions like the pebble perk could possibly work. You'd have to be standing still and crouching so you couldn't use it mid chase.
---
Pros: stun a facecamping killer and get a free save
---
Cons: double stunning the killer at pallets, survivors straight up pummeling the killer with rocks and chain stunning the killer
---
Could be fun lol
---
Yeah I feel basically the same on her 3 perks. Not downright awful, but not that good either. That pallets perk seems kinda memey.
---
*I've been trying for days to get Iron Will for Claudette and Meg and no luck so far* 
---
And I'd rather use quick and quiet instead of Urban Evasion, I hate that perk so much.
---
Had the mispleasure of having Legion as my daily
---
You‚Äôre right, you seem real hungry to pwn some noobs in epic online debate
---
Mettle of Man &amp; Breakout seems like a fun combination.
---
 Hey you shhh over there. You probably will but know i will laugh and wish on you a stubbed toe.grrr
---
Bear with me, but I think the Perk "Deliverance" *might* be to blame for Adams being tunneled.
---
An literally no one gives a shit.
---
Source the art and donate to them the money you got from gold, art thief
---
ye
---
If everyone just had the same opposing opinion on opposite posts, yes it's a hypocritical circle jerk.
---
Personally, I find her first two perks downright awful, but Breakout is pretty nice, especially for very altruistic players like me
---
Dunkmaster Clown. His bottles turn into small glass basketballs. His ~~disgusting~~ delicious beer belly sports a basketball logo.  
---
But that's not all. He's wearing Air Jordans. AND SHORTS!
---
Thank god they finally made huntress hatchets legit!
---
? i played huntress just fine a few hours ago i mean the the new maps rocks seem to have big hitboxes but thats all. (and yes i was playing on ps4)
---
When you can‚Äôt admit a mistake and resort to insults &lt;3
---
Okay... so what do you want me to say about that?
---
Honestly that's one of the main reasons I got her lol
---
There is reason, you console players didn‚Äôt support so why should you commemorate it with cosmetics
---
I had a game once where I had managed to get 3 generators done, and rescue a teammate from a hook, but we still lost. I ended up being the last survivor alive and so the killer gave me hatch. In the post game lobby my other survivors were flaming me and the killer asking why I was saved because I was a piece of shit who did nothing the entire match....
---
Don't wanna get hooked? Fine! Have it your way!
---
-Doctor standing above a sabo-jake just waiting for him to bleed out into the dirt.
---
Yes, everyone knows that survivor mains want nothing other than every killer to be total trash. Thank you.
---
Why do you think people keep replying to people with opposing views? They like arguing with them.
---
And yes, thanks for proving my point.
---
I dont usually use it, but urbn evasion gets the killer hella confused on the grass... and you just crouch away. Yh, sometimes its hard to get one perk. With yui i only got dead hard at lvl 58 or something like that
---
Why am i not surprised at this
---
And that makes sense. I 50/50 killer and survivor and lemme tell you a lot of the people who play killer is really disappointing. Somebody has to camp/tunnel 90% of the time to me. Looped somebody as kate the other day and they would stop chasing others just to come after me and then when they finally killed me, they let all 3 others finish and leave the match. I was salty as can be honestly
---
That you see the truth, that this sub is just one big circle jerk.
---
this is the wholesome claudette content I live for
---
*Meme explicitly references killers who leave quickly*
---
‚ÄúBut what about the killers that don‚Äôt leave quickly?‚Äù
---
I like these, please keep then coming.
---
What a waste of a pallet
---
hell yea! 3 whole books
---
Or just learning new difficult killer. You wouldn't believe how much abuse I got after deciding to learn Nurse recently and downranking almost every game. One of the first Nurse games got strong SWF and only managed to hook twice entire game. One person stood next to hook at game end and didn't try to run. I asked in end game chat "why"? He said he saw that I'm obviously bad at Nurse and he wanted me to have a few BPs and not to worry and keep training. It really made my day and kept thinking how there are still a few good souls in the sea of toxicity and that I want to be one of them. Then I got better... And started getting DCs :( One time I accidentally blinked on top of survivor and grabbed him off the gen few seconds after game started. Immediate DC. I let them farm that match and apologized for the accident. As survivor, I sometimes get hatch and I don't enjoy it because I obviously lost and pity escape doesn't change that fact, but it warms my heart knowing there is another human on the other side of the game who cares about how others feel.
---
The point of this rant: Let's all have fun and be nice to each other :) We can all play nasty and get a few more wins, but at what cost to our humanity?
---
Ghosty Boi + Amanda would be cool 
---
Piggy would check generators and Ghosty would patrol Jigsaw Boxes 
---
Freddy would be cool with Demogorgon 
---
Oni with Hillbilly 
---
And Huge Terror Radius Doc with stealthy killer like Wraith or Daddy Myers would be amazing
---
And every killer main wants easy kills lol.
---
Sorry but I forgot to mention @CutieC3 for letting me remake this!
---
Get rid of lithe is a start
---
"We're not* gonna live forever"
---
Could you please deliver your oni players to PC please, well trade you some Ghostfaces, Waiths, and Hillbillys

Okay, go back to those two posts and find some people who replied to both, and had different opinions on both posts. If you can find a lot of people who did, then yes it‚Äôs a circlejerk since they‚Äôd just be changing their opinion to fit with everyone else. But if you can‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs different people who have different opinions, so not a circlejerk.

I was saying DE was better about it than Behavior, but you literally just asked for an example of when they weren't, so I'll give you one.
---
The Warframe Ghoul Purge update went live on December 21, 2017.  Starting on that patch, if you had a controller plugged into your computer (whether you were using it or not), the game would lock up any time you completed a mission.  It was hotfixed on January 4, 2018.
---
So much for them fixing things on a Christmas Sunday.
---
People have loved the idea of multiple killers. That‚Äôs why people still do the glitch. Making it a actual mode would be great. It‚Äôs gonna screw MM times even more though
---
Hmm I guess I'll give it a try since I keep getting that map 24/7, and yikes I hate that.
---
whats one killer gonna do when 7 dwights swarm the hook to unhook their fallen comrade
---
Now the cooldown is 3 seconds in between so pretty much the recovery after hitting someone well carrying
---
True, it's yet another perk that is nice to have when playing with friends or just for players who are generally altruistic. It's nice to wiggle faster and it might come in clutch during intense situations.
---
Smiles in bubba.
---
In no uncertain terms, Clown easily has the best cosmetic options in the game. You got Santa Clause, the party outfit, his pumpkin-face blighted skin, and pretty soon he‚Äôs getting that mascot suit. Odds are you‚Äôre going to love at least one of those.
---
Use sprint burst to get distance and then urban evasion to hide. Spine chill to prevent grabs depending on the killer
---
Oh, that's fantastic. I'm honestly so jealous... I'm at rank 30 and still no BBQ.
---
bubba deserves a mode where he can be happy
---
Nice job completely disregarding my point to try to make a dig at me. You should try going back to school, your reading comprehension is abysmal.
---
Lmao big brain
---
Uh no I want it to not be busted
---
SWFs tend to be the most toxic because it‚Äôs a small group of people who just compound their feelings off of each other. Don‚Äôt take anything anyone says in their game seriously
---
Getting a temp ban, bp penalty, and losing an entire rank seems a little harsh for one dc as killer, but I understand the problem.
---
PC
---
I created it myself, but a generalized one can be found here: [https://i.redd.it/2am9osxbsn241.jpg](https://i.redd.it/2am9osxbsn241.jpg)
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely give it a try tomorrow. And yeah I use spine chill on all the survivors, that perk is a life saver for me.
---
x for doubt

So sad

No they were dumb. You‚Äôre the killer, you kill people. Tell them to suck it up

Oh no, you really should cleanse... :)

You‚Äôre just a piece of garbage if you DC like that, the odd los are all in your favor and you get mad and leave, I would‚Äôve had a 32k BP escape that game and wasted 15 minutes of my life on that game and got no BPS, no XP, didn‚Äôt get my rift challenge done.... I‚Äôm really pissed off
---
Right in the feels. Well said my dude.
---
This game needs more players like you. :)
---
It‚Äôs being introduced on the 5th. Honestly they should hold it because DCs are high due to basement bug. Are we meant to just stay with a white screen till we die?
---
I understand the problem but that‚Äôs way to harsh. Plus sounds like your over reacting
---
Fair enough.
---
Why not just make the second attack inflict the deep wounds status instead and not even worry about touching NOED, No Mither, or borrowed time.
---
I dunno. My team is usually too selfish to heal me, so I need to run Self Care or I never get back to healthy
---
Y'all use the weirdest meme formats I swear
---
Sort by Hot and you'll mostly get shitposts about the game and people complaining. Mostly everything the devs get in terms of feedback is overwhelming hate. And no, that's not what my logic says at all, all it shows is that you're not as good at observing things as you think you are.
---
shut up, plague
---
She's been busted for a while now play survivor and see how unrealistic her hatchet hits are. That's probably the reason you use Huntress for easy kills.
---
Ya I feel that
---
Ghost Face is in the bushes watching you heal.
---
But it isn't. You're blowing things out of proporcion.
---
which exhaustion perk is better then lithe right now?
---
1. I personally do not rq
---
2. I said I understood the issue you talked about, I've recently had a problem where games would full on kick me, and penalize me as though I dc'd intentionally
---
If a single survivor DC's, there's 3 other survivors for the killer to get no off of. If a killer DC's, then all survivors lose out on everything. It seems harsh, but a killer dc ruins a game far more than a survivor dc can. 
---
 
---
 Although any DC should be treated harshly at this point.
---
I'm guessing this in PC? Killer queue times are instant on console. Maybe take a little break and play some survivor?
---
Plague main? Me? W-what? Nooo..... Totally not...
---
Sounds like you've only seen red rank Bubbas
---
Yep! üòÖ
---
I play tons of survivor. Maybe you should play killer for once in your life 
---
And fucking lol at thinking Huntress is easy kills on console good fucking god. If that was true there would be tons of them. Like Spirit, who genuinely gets ez kills. But almost no one plays her at all. Because she‚Äôs always been bad on console
---
Omg I bet he was so mad. I‚Äôd be so mad lol
---
What am I looking for?
---
Oh ok! I‚Äôll now proceed to cleanse
---
I‚Äôve only played survivor, I‚Äôm still new at the game
---
I let Megs go if they have nice outfits, I let Jane leave by default, and I'm also pretty soft on Ace. I am merciless with Dwights.
---
...no...just no, that would be INSANELY hard to counter as the killer, just don't be a fucking idiot and run up there while the gates are being opened
---
Not really the 5 vs 1 was pretty fun
---
lmao, for real tho, does anybody now the real context?
---
real campers are the reason I stopped playing dbd for a month
---
going from purple ranks to green really helped but it just went right back to camper mccampy camp
---
Why respond to people like that? Just block them. Also the basement hook may be them referring to the basement glitch.
---
All I‚Äôd do is swap kindred for adrenaline. I‚Äôm not sure about how lithe does vs other exhaustion perks, but I think it looks pretty good

Yesterday I had a survivor get mad at me because currently there is a sound bug issue where your sound is all fucked up and he was telling me I should have let him live because he was having that sound issue and I was like how the fuck am I suppose to know what's going on in your end.
---
Whats interesting to me is since the chapter dropped, every DC I‚Äôve had the pleasure of dealing with has not been due to basement bug. But I agree that needs fixing first, I‚Äôd understand people DCing because of that. Although when it happened to me I just asked the killer to come kill me cause I didn‚Äôt wanna DC.
---
Lol
---
Congrats you made it to heaven
---
*cries in killer*
---
Yea not exactly looking forward to this as a killer main

---
Yo, so I don't actually play this game as I think it would give me nightmares but this stuff appears on my front page and I have seen a few YouTube videos of the game. No interest in playing it for aforementioned scare reasons but what's the reason behind it being bad for someone to get unhooked?
---
Meh
---
Are survivor mains seriously at the point where the brain rot has gotten so bad they think tons of people on console at playing huntress because she‚Äôs easy? Holy fuck.
---
I'm hoping the latter. I want to love Legion, but the position they're in makes them suck fat fucking cock

---
Killer doesn‚Äôt need to be made harder, majority think killer is harder.  50% kill rate shows nothing, hook rate is what you need. E.g at red ranks hook rate would be very high with low kill rate compared to low ranks where it‚Äôd be high kill rate and low hook rate.
---
You mean red, purple, green, and some yellow rank bubbas
---
I hope not. I didn't check his rank, but I'm a rank 7 and just went against a leatherface. He facecamped one person. And then he got me down after they fully died on hook and facecamped me. 
---
 Most other killers I play against will maybe stay a few seconds, or will immediately run off. But every single time it's a leatherface, without fail, they facecamp the first two people they hook.
---
Only bad survivors bitch about something like this. The majority have no problem.
---
i do not condone this behavior

---
You say these factors are incredibly relevant. I am asking you to prove it.
---
Do they affect a significant proportion of matches, such that it greatly inflates Killer winrate statistics?
---
If these factors don‚Äôt even have a significant impact on the results, I cannot say that they are relevant.
---
E.g.
---
Killer winrate without factor: 60%
---
Killer winrate with factor: 59%
---
Then I can safely say that those factors are not important because they barely affect the stats, therefore we can use the stats as a valid basis for argument.
---
You keep talking as if these factors are so important that they cannot be ignored. I am asking you to prove it.
---
I have heard your qualitative explanation a number of times and understood it the first time. I am asking for quantitative proof.
---
Killer is definitely harder. Especially Oni. He is harder than huntress imo
---
I don't camp as Leatherface. The ones that do camp are memeing, trying to get easy bloodpoints, or are new to the game and don't understand it's frowned upon.

**[Rule 2 - Unrelated Content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_2._unrelated_content)** All submissions must be directly related to Dead by Daylight, the fanbase surrounding the game, the subreddit itself or associated properties.
---
* For non-text posts (images, videos, gifs, ...), referring to the game in the title is not sufficient. The main focus of the post itself must be on Dead by Daylight. The rule of thumb is: if you can post the exact same image/video to another, completely unrelated subreddit without changing a single thing in the image/video, it is considered offtopic.
---
I mean I feel that you should keep whatever points and items you earned, because losing it all makes no sense. Also, survivor dcs often throw the whole game for the other 3 if it's near the beginning, which also sucks. 
---
So in general, the intentional dcs should be less effective on the other players.
---
It‚Äôs wrong if it‚Äôs done the whole same but if it‚Äôs only in EGC  I think it is okay In a sense that he wants to secure a kill , at times a killer does really bad in a match and being a a**hole is the only way to get a kill I guess

The new map is just garbage. It has annoying tiles and it‚Äôs impossible to see anything.  The middle a cluster fuck of annoyance.  BHVR seriously needs a new map design team. The last 5-6 maps have been pretty atrocious.

It‚Äôs a pretty shitty pallet anyway tbf

Man, I had to switch over to killer because the queue times for surv were like 10 minutes a piece
---
Can you please fix the matchmaking while you are at it.
---
I play both so I know huntress has shit hit boxes because I've gotten kills I know shouldn't have hit  unlike you I will admit it but maybe you're just trash with Huntress I'm done after this no point in continuing this conversation.
---
‚ÄúCan do gens‚Äù isn‚Äôt a real sentence in dbd
---
All I see is a circle jerk.
---
If egc is active and you‚Äôve trapped 2 people in a area , I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong in a gaming sense , morally yeah people will judge you dearly .
---
Oh no. Pls. The only thing I have left to eat is my 3rd child that doesn‚Äôt have legal documentation
---
Purchasing the game isn‚Äôt supporting it? Many people enjoyed their time but compared to DBD it wasn‚Äôt as good, majority of playerbase came from DBD.  So even those who did support it got cut short
---
As annoying as situations like this are, it's pretty pointless to post on here. It's not like posting it on here will get this DCer banned. You're obviously posting it because you're pissed off, but what does it accomplish? What he did was obviously scummy, but you'd be better off submitting a support ticket to BHVR or something.
---
Adam needs some rasta dreads cosmetics. Like bob marley style. Mainly because I want a survivor that looks similar to me...
---
It's so jarring having to wait 20min for a match on ps4 when a new killer just came out. Can we plz fix this?
---
I got knock out level 3 at the 5th level oni :p
---
I dont even like slugging with him know that he doesn't have to
---
Someone doesn‚Äôt play this game, it‚Äôs Hawkins laboratory, unsafe pallet heaven
---
Like all pallets on this map. (:
---
Also there are rarely any good spots for traps on indoor maps like this one or the game, they will be always easy visible.
---
Unfortunately it does not :(
---
But your point literally has *nothing* to do with this thread.  I‚Äôm not claiming killers who stand and wait for you to go into struggle are okay/good, but this meme *literally excludes killers who do that.* So how valid or not valid your point is doesn‚Äôt matter cause you‚Äôre just looking to start an argument in an unrelated thread.  My reading comprehension is fine, but if you want to start arguments about camping killers do it in a thread about camping killers, not on dumb memes that, once again, *explicitly rule out camping killers from the joke.*

I think new Freddy is perfect in terms of balance. Not too strong, (He's only an M1 killer) not too weak (Possibly the best M1 killer in DBD). Good synergy with BBQ and Pop, and not addon reliant + the fake pallet addons drastically change his power.
---
Blood echo is solid, Nemesis on the other hand is extremely overrated. Zanshij tactics is a good perk, just not for experienced players.
---
It's not. Also Rule 9.

Thank you for your service.

Numerous of players in the past 24 hours have DC‚Äôd. I‚Äôve dcd because of it roughly 5 times, my friend got 2 in a row which sucks. There‚Äôs also a bug where you get stuck as killer if you kick the gen and you‚Äôre too close. Meant to just sit and wait to get destroyed?? Such an awful time to implement punishment
---
I shit you not, I played an Oni game today where I hooked a Steve, he got unhooked, I hook 2 others and down the Steve again and STILL got DS'd, guess I shouldn't tunnel...

Glad it‚Äôs not just me. Some of shots should have hit because they were dead on but didn‚Äôt register. I still am having fun playing her though.
---
Yeah, you guys sure are getting your way.
---
I mean Balanced Landing is probably the worst exhaustion perk now. What else do you want
---
Friendly reminder that it can only be triggered a maximum of 5 times in a match. It's not a good perk.
---
Dead hard, sprint burst.
---
Happened to me too lmao. At least I got to see the galaxy as I slowly died
---
The queue times will get better once you rank up. There's not many players at grey and yellow ranks.
---
dead hard is buggy af and i havent seen anyone use SP in ages :/
---
I feel bad for doing it while the glitch is going on. (I also dont want to get banned for glitch abusing)
---
Xi Jinping says: Dude your social credit score is so low we just went ahead and stripped you of your humanity. -Life
---
So it‚Äôs an ongoing issue, when do u think they‚Äôll patch?
---
Dude I think your meme just became a template? Hes not even making the same joke as you.
---
Decisive is the only way to free your self from the void.
---
Still 10 seconds is a lot.
---
Exactly. You‚Äôre one step ahead of him.
---
Honestly some killers might not use reddit or any type of forums so they might not even know about it.
---
...there no point in this worthless community anymore
---
If you do it while the killer is still around, the killer can one hit down the unhooked person immediately. And if the unhooked person doesn't have DS to fight back, they will get put back on the hook for the 2nd time which will bring them close to death.
---
So you're admiring that you're a lonely douchebag with no friends?
---
Killer is prob harder on console, starting off, killer is very easy, and gets harder. 
---
Survivor however, starts hard, prob gets easier, then harder again. It's hard because a lot of newbies don't know-how to escape and often hide instead of doing gens.  This is also why killer is relatively easy to play early on.
---
It‚Äôs a moral dilemma for me because I need basement hooks but also can sympathize with the glitching survivors
---
You don‚Äôt watch any tournaments or play at high rank then. Sprint burst has been used by all the winning teams. Dead hard is a little buggy that‚Äôs why I mentioned SB, I just went back to DH a few days ago seems better than before
---
PC master race
---
-rolls a D20-

He seems pretty nutty on PC but I wouldn't be surprised if he's a little lower than people expect down the line. Kind of like Plague
---
I am seriously doubting this is bait. Also, bump
---
Tracking is hard when you start playing killer man, I used to loose survivors all the time mid chase haha. You get used to it eventually, it's probably due in no small part to going from third person as survivor, to a low-ass fov killer in first person. Try out shadowborn, the wraith perk, if you have a hard time with tracking: it can help you keep an eye on survivors when you're new :-)
---
id swap kindered for adreniline
---
It hurts how true this is. I'm never following the updates and talk from a ptb ever again. He feels like trying to control a broken tank on PS4.
---
Just think of it as a way to help you get better at the game, I guess.
---
MOOD
---
i guess red ranks arent considered high LUL
---
True but I can‚Äôt rank up if I can‚Äôt get into a game, I‚Äôm being tru when I say I waited like 46 minutes yesterday üòÇ
---
I just have a really hard time controlling him on PS4 but I only had like, three matches with him.
---
It's also difficult since I have almost no perks with him and I'm getting paired with survivors higher ranked than me.
---
Still, I'm not giving up on him just yet. I love a big boi.
---
I want to progress and it ain't being fixed in a week or 2..
---
Ex legions mains everywhere upvote
---
"Uh oh! shes not using iron will" Best line.
---
Is this frequently? I have been hooked, and hooked multiple survivors in the basement. They all seemed fine
---
You can only match with who's playing not sure why  people don't understand this.
---
I think lower rank/level survivors were being verbally harassed over pre-game chat.
---
People like you are the reason I come back to the sub so frequently. While the mods let this place run rampant with garbage memes that are either a) downright stolen or b)the laziest Sponge Bobesque eye cancer, and tend to eviscerate any posts concerning real complaints or game discussion, there are gold nuggets like yourself. 
---
Thank you.
---
Thanks - I can barely see cause the map is so dark.
---
What a sad little man you are.
---
I will never understand this sub. Why do you yet downvoted to hell for that?
---
-rolls 5 dice at once-
---
DM Xi Jinping says: *No.* -Your Freedom. Off to a North Korean work camp
---
proof it's way to easy to rank up in this game
---
I dont think you know how dumb survivors can be with unhooking
---
This guy has heard enough of your shit
---
They said a week or two lol
---
Thanks - it's hard to see since it's so dark.
---
top image meme source?
---
No thats not at all the reason
---
Lmao
---
I‚Äôm not. I genuinely don‚Äôt care if I win or lose. But not having a prayer? That‚Äôs just dreadful. And most other killers bore me to play except Oni who I‚Äôm going to try and figure out how to world around his hardware limitations. But I‚Äôm probably just going to only play survivor now since Huntress is off the table
---
You just wait for now. Or you can get it with a VPN.
---
You guys are like the epitome of this game
---
People say frequently but from what I've seen on Xbox it's random half the time they are fine and get out.
---
You'd just go down immediately on any loop, they'd just approach from both sides. It'd get really dull after the first match unless the killers would split up.
---
Not saying they would stomp the survivors, but it wouldnt be fun to play vs.
---
I mean I‚Äôve seen the biggest potatoes at rank 1 and the best players at rank 1. It‚Äôs not that hard, you can get rank 1 by hiding the whole game. Rank just happens, each season majority of people just troll and piss about and always get rank 1. It‚Äôs the rank for average to top survivors, not same on killers side.
---
Bill got his sweater early, and for free!
---
I was trying to get a basement rift challenge done, was wondering why survivors weren't moving when they got off the hook lol. Got my challenge done tho
---
Yea it does take awhile when your rank 20 sadly. I was lucky and played pc during a free weekend
---
I don't pallet loop, I use the structure of the map and windows to run away, survivors would have to adapt
---
How does furtive chase bring back old school legion? As far as I know the perk is useless, I'm curious I kinda wanna use sometime
---
Well then it's no longer an insult it's just truth.
---
This is in english?
---
Why, ofcourse

---
I get it if you need them for like a challenge or something but otherwise if there‚Äôs another hook to use it would be great not to be immediately dicked over.
---
Clown and leatherface would be quite hard to get away from. 
---
Hag and trapper would be annoying if everything was double trapped. 
---
I like the idea of Huntress hitting people who stepped in bear traps, but don‚Äôt think that would be that effective. 
---
Double huntress might be something. 
---
Double hag, one with collision addons the other with mint rag and shackles would be crazy
---
I kinda think that with more players in the game we might see more dedicated roles being played. Like one killer runs a slowdown build and the other a chase build. 
---
The survivors might have,  prove thyself gen jockeys or healers running We‚Äôll make it and op flower perk.

just double tap the unhook.
---
works 100% of the time
---
Not taking sides here but theres plenty of memes or comments on this sub about how survivors are "toxic" for actually being good at surviving. And yes I know teabagging or pointing at the killer is toxic but seriously some of you really get mad at survivors doing well. And to the survivors that do rush the hook instead of waiting to see if you are camping you guys suck.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, haven‚Äôt experienced it yet
---
Oh I do. I guess it's just cause usually I'm a nice killer if someone unhooks someone in front of me I usually go after the person who did the unhooking and give the other survivor a pass for now.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me every basement hook with the new update. :(
---
Simple; new players gravitate toward Bubba. They don‚Äôt know that face camping is a bad idea, so they just do what they think gets them a kill.
---
Shut the fuck up carl
---
there's drop downs on badham like that lol
---
Only if same punishment applied to survivors if they DS.
---
Oooh I‚Äôll keep that in mind
---
old school legion addons, furtive chase, tinkerer, remember me, and any other perk that you want (other than stbfl or dying light). Use your power to find the obsession, double hit them, down them, and hook them. Continue doing this to the obsession. Your terror radius gets smaller and smaller each hook. Its not tunneling since the obsession always changes. Countered by staying close to the legion during the chase, but then the legion gets to be closer to you, making you easier to hit. Probably not "viable", but not burger king Myers.
---
Where else should they have put the trap when there‚Äôs barely any grass?
---
Well your probably one out of the 100s of killers they've fought and most killers dont do that.
---
same just playing all love it is dumb just like this game
---
Ya but regardless it was dickish. Just take the L lol
---
This happened to me today and I raged because I was downed at the start of the match. I even had a Rainbow Key and had given the offering to make everyone start the trial together. The Killer knew about the basement bug so it was dirty as hell to use a basement hook. I can't believe some players are knowingly trying to exploit the bug.
---
How big is this update?
---
How about this- *everyone* gets a harsher punishment for disconnecting. Not just killers.
---
[Reading is fun](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
&gt;If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
It's working as intended

3.7.8 Patch Notes:
---
Fixed a bug where the farmer did not become the unhooked survivor's obsession.
---
What do you think the game is balanced around?  Because it's not red ranks.
---
Maybe a lil sensual bj
---
I'll promote putting a paper sack over his head as a cosmetic.
---
furtive chase brings down your terror radius during a chase by 4 meters per time your obsession is hooked. Less terror radius during chase means they can bleed out during the chase. This cant work anymore though because deep wound is no longer tied to the terror radius.
---
On PS4?
---
This...
---
Mine was only 2gb on ps4 :/
---
So for now we wait and get fkd noice.
---
make another pair of stairs
---
no it's legitimately against the rules of the game. it does fall under body blocking unsportsmanlike
---
You act like only professionals play on pc. Thats not at all true. Many people play on pc that are casual players too. And its not like pc and console will ever have cross platform. Itll be xbox and ps4, switch and mobile, windows and whatever else there is
---
Oh I should have seen that ;-; I'm sad that I didn't get to use it now lol
---
Fast flapping = "I'm being camped, just work gens."
---
After being on hook for awhile, long slow almost-attempting-escape = "Jesus guys, it's been 40 seconds and nobody is even near me... please come!"
---
Good bot
---
"Your point has literally nothing to do with this thread." This post is literally making fun of survivors who complain about camping killers, which my comment points out is still a thing that happens, regardless. My comment may not be on the same 'side' as OP's post is in relation to hook camping but it is related to the topic at hand. 
---
Go back to looking up memes and babbling to yourself, you're a disgrace to your parents and not worth my time.
---
Gonna be honest, this sounds kinda condescending. As if you‚Äôre above everyone else in this community because you don‚Äôt have a strong preference for one or the other.
---
Basically
---
Oh nice. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I've been grinding for a while so I can actually use it in a public game, but I was too late.
---
Every time me or someone I‚Äôm playing with get hooked in the basement it happens and now all of a sudden every killer run iron grasp and agitation
---
Solid post.
---
The cosmetic was free. Its in bill's customization
---
Usually I avoided this by simply trying to see how was making gens if I have a perk like bbq or bitter murmur and see eho saves the most or at least tries. I usually slug them, kill the last surv and them give the hatch. Its not a hard thing to do since I have to know who's doing what to win, so it comes to me like if it was second nature
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Most killers are rewarding this behavior by tunneling instead of going for the farmer.
---
Harder daddy
---
Oh yah? Well that was a run-on sentence, NERD!
---
Yeah being able to turn quickly is both a good thing and a bad thing
---
I had the perk forever I just thought it was actually useless, what good is a stealth perk if it only works when someone has to be seeing you I didn't make the connection of the terror radius and bleedout
---
Leatherfaces power was made for camping. Can‚Äôt really blame them for doing it
---
People complain, you're fine. They call you a noob, oh well, last I checked high level DBD squads push through Ruin until they stumble upon it. Their correct play was to just do gens. Punish the killer for not spreading pressure around the board, attack Ruin when the killer is away. That's their fault.
---
Probably cause (speaking as someone who played Killer against a group like this) it makes the game obscenely frustrating and take goddamn forever because you can't hook people and also can't slug them either, so it inevitably turns into a clown fiesta of hitting people as soon as they get up until everyone bleeds out. 
---
Tl;dr - fun for SWF groups, not fun for the Killer to deal with.
---
Jesus got hooked that way?
---
Thank you!
---
Ahhh gotcha . Well I‚Äôll prolly just stick to survivor then
---
Killer is easier if you are in the brown/yellow ranks. With all the scrubs that dont know how to play its hard to not get at least a 3k. I imagine that thats why all killers have a 50% kill ratio is because they are counting those players that dont know how to play yet. Dont forget BHVR also counts disconnects as a kill, so killers like the doctor that have a higher than average DC rate will look like they are doing better than they are.
---
so whats your definition of high rank?
---
Usually when I play with my friends we try to make a roll for ourselves, and it works like a charm if the killer doesn't pay attention at who's doing what in the game lol
---
 Claudette‚Äôs mori looks pretty cool
---
Lower ranked/leveled survivors were being harassed over pre-game chat.
---
The sub has 90k+ more people in it then it did this time last year. Communities change and evolve, grouping almost two hundred thousand people together and say we all suck the devs‚Äô cocks isn‚Äôt just untrue it‚Äôs pretty stupid and immature. But whatever üò™
---
What‚Äôs wrong with you?
---
Does this happen to everyone
---
Her blood perk is amazing on maps like lerys, or combined with stealth perks. Think about it, that perk + poised on rotten fields makes you impossible to track.
---
Her perks are not amazing, but they are better then the year of dog shit we got before the stranger things chapter.
---
In all seriousness I‚Äôve been told that starting the unhook, canceling it and then unhooking the second time will also free them.
---
Lithe is actually one of the best exhaustion perks atm.
---
Im a Ghostface main and even I thought it was useless. The moment I realized was whenever the deep wound rework was leaked. Sometimes it really do be like that.
---
That's a Ussylis tech, right? Makes Killers pick up Survivors instead of breaking pallets. 
---
Gj, not many people know that exists.
---
Her SCREAM
---
I used to main legion up until a few months ago and rarely got DCs but I'm sorry you have to deal with that (I still say I'm a legion main because I literary can't change my steam name because so many people recognize me by it lol. if anyone is curious it's Franks Left Nut)
---
Good thing that you know now that it actually means White Penis :)

A ton of players are checking out Oni, leaving only the absolute devout survivor mains as the player pool. Unfortunately, in this pool, you‚Äôll encounter a lot of meta perks, a ton of skill, and a little bit of toxicity. It‚Äôll settle down in one to two weeks.
---
It's extremely easy, especially as survivor
---
I dont know if he is a worse billy or not. The obvious downside is that he has a condition to his power, and it genuinely can be pretty hard to get the ball rolling with him. Once he does though I think he snowballs pretty hard, and once he has his kanabo out he is definitely better than billy
---
No! They're just entitled. It annoys me so much when people act like that. It's a fucking killer, they're not gonna be nice to you.
---
For the clown guy?
---
...except, the meme specifies that the killers in question aren‚Äôt actually camping.  Things this meme doesn‚Äôt do:
---
1) Defend actual camping
---
2)Accuse all survivors of unfair complaining
---
3) pretend actual camping never happens.
---
So, once again, none of your arguments are relevant because they‚Äôre referring to scenarios different from the meme.
---
Plus, you know, it‚Äôs a meme.  It doesn‚Äôt have to come paired with a paragraph of disclaimers about the OP‚Äôs opinions on game balance and the player base as a whole.
---
But go off, I guess?
---
Yep but you get to dc as much as you like. entitled POS survivor
---
I mean yeah that‚Äôs why I said it
---
I think this is the most frustrating part about this whole deal. Infinite Mending got a news entry when you entered the game with a warning that abusing it would lead to a ban, and this is far more easy to reproduce and can be exploited by any killer. Why isn't it getting the same treatment?
---
Oh my god, yes
---
I'd argue that the opposite is true. Console killers are actually better at aiming since they have to deal with survivors 360'ing really easily and having much less precise controls.
---
&gt;This will be used to make sure the injured survivors bleed more when a survivor is hooked, This is important because the more blood the Oni has the quicker they get their power meaning more blood production equals a better chance for the Oni to win and using their powers more times per game
---
&gt;This will be used because Sloppy Butcher directly increases the rate of which a survivor bleeds, giving them more fuel for their power
---
Perks and debuffs dont affect blood orb frequency.
---
I kill the farmer if this happens
---
I was on the Stranger Things map with a few friends. One of my friends got hooked in the basement. And he couldn‚Äôt see anything, once unhooked he took the next few minutes trying to find the stairs to get out of the basement, once out of the basement he started to continuously fall through the map. 
---
We managed to complete every Gen and started opening the gate, the killer found him and proceeded to get hooked in the basement again. The irony is when he got hooked again the glitch fixed itself.
---
Wait.. really?
---
Her VA sounds the same as nancy
---
The only ONLY use I can see is when you break off suddenly from a chase you can probably get the drop on some gen workers, or solo survivors
---
Huntress is one of the easiest killers to loop, especially on console. The hit box is a bloody cylinder so it ends up being questionable for both sides at times. Unless you're playing a god tier Huntress (especially on console) majority of times it's going to be you at fault for dying to her.
---
Who else hears the tier 3 music
---
Huntress is stupidly OP your hitbox is the size of mount everest
---
Always, but btw how do u feel when no one steps in ur traps bc ur the predictable trapper that traps the mother‚Äôs dwelling windows?
---
I think he means rule 8
---
I came across a Wraith who was running Agitation, Monsterous Shrine, Iron Grasp, and Mad Grit, just to abuse the basement bug. Survivor is damn near playable at the moment with the combo of the basement bug, server issues, and the fact that a lot of players are doing their Tome challenges, so Killers HAVE to hook people in the basement to progress. Fucking ridiculous.
---
I played killer on my friends account on rank 20 took about 10 minutes imo
---
Nope he is quite bad compared to how he was in PTB, basically just a budget billy who has to work too hard for his power now and he can't mindgame loops because of his size and footsteps. Pretty bad
---
Pc or console
---
The killer got sick of getting body blocked by survivors. How the roles have changed
---
I actually main Wraith lol! Cause he's so easy to play and you can just sneak up on them.
---
You farmed the ace knowing your team doesn't have DS and you don't have bt. Pepega
---
I think their data also showed trapper as the most played killer, but didnt mention that during the period that the data was collected people were playing the trapper to get the rift challenges done; so he would see increased play.
---
His lore does say he was pretty athletic...
---
I want to get legion and the plague. Both their play styles and perks are unique enough to make them interesting but. I feel like I would run into this issue making the purchase and Bloodpoints invested obsolete
---
Ever missed a skill check because someone got hooked at the same the check came? Because that happens a lot to me. It's like too much happens too fast.
---
Poised is just not good. You can't really control when it works. You could be on a hook or be downed. It's way too situational to be good. It's a niche perk at *best*.
---
that explains why i stay hooked for so long. just thought my team were dick heads leaving me for dead. i just do it cuz its something fun to do while I'm hooked
---
Congrats!
---
I can find games in 10 seconds as killer on Xbox. What rank are you?

3.7.7a Patch Notes:
---
Fixed an issue where the previous patch notes made a tapped typo with the word "Grants".
---
Keeping in mind survivors hiding in lockers are no better than immersed Claudettes hiding in the corner of the map in a bush. He‚Äôs like Hillbilly where he could be on top of you in any minute. If locker hiding became an epidemic then Iron Maiden exists to help locate survivors and potentially insta down them. 
---
Lockers will not be a viable counter if every survivor starts doing it. If every odd survivor does it on the occasion then it may work, but the point still stands that a survivor in a locker is doing nothing while he insta downs someone else.
---
Stop. Posting. These. Please.
---
Whenever all the 5 gens were done and I'm playing against the trapper, I have the feeling that the Trapper is doing the archive challenge. I always walk into a trap and I always end up getting hooked :(
---
But I'm not going to stop
---
Lol, I get it now.
---
We should really be talking about that elephant scream in the beginning of the video more than anything else.
---
Repost police your under arrest
---
I love you.
---
Thanks, sweetie, but someone already replied and let me know.
---
And this was early game too. Like wtf can't we just have fun with the game instead of ruining it for everyone else??
---
If you‚Äôre on console sometimes they try and pull the whole file that isn‚Äôt needed. Pause the download wait a minute and restart it. If that doesn‚Äôt work do a quick reset. Ddb has only done this a couple times for me while games like COD do this regularly for whatever reason.
---
Holy shit. This is the largest I‚Äôve ever seen one of these comments get.
---
I was wondering if something is up. Like, I was wondering if it was just people playing Huntress for the daily with little experience actually throwing hatchets.
---
Every single patch seems to impact killer performance negatively, and as a survivor main I'm getting a bit nervous about BHVR driving all of our killers away. We desperately need optimization, and something beyond lowering the graphics.
---
Can I‚Äôm at work and just imagined Claudette I hinging her jaw and Demo mori‚Äôing David and I can‚Äôt stop laughing,
---
Rank 1 here and I find games about 10 seconds after pressing ready.
---
This was pretty damn satisfying.
---
I said play at high rank, more the less meant high standard.  I thought you were green ranks to yellow? You still haven‚Äôt said
---
I would switch out Spies for Sloppy Butcher. Or if you have Freddy, Bloodwarden. If somebody is scrambling to get an activated trap off during the end game and you down and hook them, you can block everyone from leaving the game. Get those pesky tea baggers at the exit gate. And honestly, if you don't have better perk options use No One Escapes Death. If you don't have Ruin, it's fair play. And it pairs really well with Bloodwarden.

See I don't understand this my friend said the same thing and I'm rank 20 it's insane my internet is fine every other game I play works great it's just whenever I try to play Dbd as killer it just takes so long
---
Similar problem just with ps4 survor ques
---
So it sounds like the best build you can achieve is Make Your Choice, Surveillance, No One Escapes Death, and Bloodwarden.
---
I don‚Äôt trust the survs I get to do gens so I will literally go down to finish the gen when it‚Äôs so close to popping
---
When a Killer on that map (to my knowledge) hits a survivor while descending from a higher point it's likely that the server desyncs the player frame (invisible) from player model (visible) and the Killer player can not continue playing without aid.
---
I like the invisible wraith in the background, nice touch!
---
didnt say my rank????? its clearly in the picture
---
you are one sad strange little man
---
True, too bad that doesn't work either üò¢
---
Took me two games. Blendette with a key, Spine Chill, Self Care, Iron Will and Dead Hard. With all the new Oni's out they are easily bullied and avoided. Typically when they're raging they don't take the time to search. Hide when your Spine Chill is active and make smart saves. I luckily had a good team of randos. One got caught at the end but I had to leave to protect my challenge. We hammered out gens and I was able to escape. Good luck
---
Stop posting these. If you sort by New Posts, you'll see it gets posted every minute. It's a bug. At this point 99% of people know about it.
---
So weird
---
Not this guy. I know who he is, and anytime a bug like this appears he abuses them. He never gets banned either since it's console.
---
This is more of a rant than a discussion , DC harsh punishment shouldn‚Äôt be one sided .
---
Like seriously were these problems even happening in the PTB. I feel like theirs always more problems in the live version lmfao
---
I think once the match has reached 40ish minutes the environment should turn to dawn
---
New Chapter confirmed?
---
Survivor: cutie
---
Killer: wholesome dad
---
Map: b e d
---
I see a lot of people getting stuck on generators all of a sudden. Are you kicking it to make this happen?
---
When did I say that?
---
That may of been what that wraith was trying to do, but that isn't the normal technique.
---
isnt the game hide seek then chase
---
so darker means better hiding when it can be really hard to hide
---
Shit, so it's not just the new map?! D: I was hoping it was only that map. Damn.
---
Yeppers
---
Noice
---
this is the most wholesome thing i've seen in a long time, thank you
---
Trapper isn't a strong killer and has a lot of RNG invovled. Stop complaining about killers who are underwhelming. Disarming a trap isn't the end of the world.
---
Even better
---
That would be fun!
---
I had 14 gb. I think it downloaded the whole dbd File.
---
Bump
---
hey, you. you're finally awake
---
super easy to do, maybe i could show you one time but there needs to be 3 people total
---
PC or console
---
4k potential is pretty dang good, Power is fun if you managed to down multiple people or get a down when hitting out of demon dash also it's great for snowballing. Perks are kinda eh Nemesis is alright, zanshin tactics is pretty good if you're a noob or don't know the pallet spawns. Fun factor atleast for me is a 9/10 maybe even a 10/10
---
That's you're problem. It's hard to find games in grey ranks because everyone's at least a yellow rank.
---
They should honestly have a grass spawn in every map when playing against trapper , even in Lerys and any other indoor map , it‚Äôs hard for the trapper to get traps in those maps .
---
People are senselessly salty in this game. Better to just avoid the post game screen
---
Exhaustion add-ons or mindbreaker/blood echo perks. any survivor running an exhaustion perk will hate you.
---
Console. Xbox specifically
---
Sorry that I didn‚Äôt capture it in my head, replying from reply box can‚Äôt see pics

Sensitivity? If you're playing keyboard and mouse on console doing turns are also much more difficult than pc and max out at about 90 degrees I'd say. Other than that I'm not sure
---
There are people who just enjoy the game casually and others who want to try their best (on both ends). Sometimes these two pools of players mix and people become unhappy (babby survivors get run over by experienced killers, experienced survivors rush an inexperienced killer in like 2 minutes). There's nothing wrong with trying hard and it's just a stupid stigma because one side is playing to the best of their abilities and the other isn't.
---
True, I am a little guilty of being mad at those perks :( but not overpowered perks
---
That is, canonically, what the first guy did. Stabbed the guy himself, then convinced others to join in.
---
Bruh the killer trying to have fun(win) triggering u?
---
That map is aids
---
Friend of mine finished getting healed and couldn‚Äôt move, be picked up, or bleed out.  Killer had to DC as a result.  Pls fix BHVR.
---
Which one of my idiot teammates got myers to rank thr*gack!*
---
Dude I said this before it became a template
---
Yea pretty sure I saw it yesterday or two days ago
---
Having fun doesn't mean ruining the game for everyone else
---
This is a noob rant.
---
120 games, 17.5% survival rate overall. Do you really think he just happened to play against good killers and get bad teammates that many times in a row?
---
Unlucky.
---
How is he ruining the game though? He's just using his power
---
Its not just that, this particular trapper was camping as well
---
Me yesterday when I got mori‚Äôd and then the killer let the other three farm and escape. Feels bad
---
I agree, the new map is hard to play with the killer because it is so damn dark.
---
Had this happen yesterday, except it said match result: escaped.
---
In a toxic way that ruins enjoykent for everyone else
---
Then you understood the intent perfectly. I *transcend* this community.
---
get better internet or dont post.
---
Why is it toxic
---
ok cool
---
Then that's the issue. Not the fact that he's a Trapper. The fact he's camping as a Trapper. Some killers are strong when camping like Trapper and Leatherface.
---
Why‚Äôve you posted this 4 times?
---
Honestly they should remove those huge unmindgameble vaults , block them like other blocked windows it‚Äôll make the same sooo much better . As for gen speed , make a open argument about nerfing gens and you‚Äôll see people being against it because majority is solo que and they‚Äôll hate you for suggesting it .

Played him a lot on Xbox today. Power is incredibly hard to control (unlike PC) because on PC you can flick and hit people around corners or counter 360s. People can just hug a rock or wall and you can‚Äôt use your insta down. The videos you see of him wrecking on PC are not even close to console. You can‚Äôt pull that stuff off unless they make some changes to it. 4K potential is alright until purple/red ranks where they counter him pretty easy. Perks aren‚Äôt very good except for Nemesis (pair with Rancor, PWYF, maybe some other fun stuff.) Blood Echoes could be decent on Plague.
---
Oooo  piece of candy
---
Personally, i enjoy messing with really cocky people. And killer lets me do that. I also find killer more fun then surv
---
What do you mean by that
---
When you tombstone the Claudette that looped you for 5 gens and teabagged you at every pallet
---
na but the amount of bugs that are occurring are ridiculous, just had a game on red forest and the doctor hit me mid air and got perma blinded and then stuck in the basement, another game I couldn't wiggle even tho I got body blocked three times and later the ghostfaces got stuck in a gen, and another my friend got downed during EGC and him and the huntress got stuck even after the timer ended, he couldn't leave and the huntress walked around until they finally closed the game
---
You posted this 4 times in a row
---
lol last time i try to say anything negative about killers on this sub. Literally just a killer circle jerk. You missed the point and cant take any criticism
---
I know right?
---
Played survivor first to get use to the game and because it's a horror game. Then I played killer cause of monto and survivor cause of noob3 and everything fell into place
---
It was an accident my app didn't close after summiting so I thought it didn't so I kept doing it
---
I watched a video from umbra that reminds me of this. In which she kills the farmer and let's the unhooked survivor teabag his downed body
---
Ok thanks!
---
Oh darn.
---
There are a few good guides online you can check that can help. Space coconut got a great "How To" video on her you might wanna check it out :) It's called "How to Hag: A Gameplay Guide For Aspiring Hag Players". Its a little outdated though for perks and addons but he put a video in the description that's more up to date for those and the gameplay itself. As I said though its still a really great guide I'd recommend!
---
Hope you don‚Äôt get banned for spam my dude
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e69d0e/help/
---
Do you not see my user flair? I play both sides equally. You are complaining about an already underwhelming killer. What would you like changed about the Trapper? Ooo, maybe we should take away his traps!!
---
I'm liking Oni. First few matches were rough but as I got the hang of things I can see plays I could make if I was better. I feel like he has a really nice skill ceiling and will be rewarding to learn.
---
To be fair it was for the best. Old Legion was incredibly boring to play against, I certainly don‚Äôt want to go back to that. They really need to just rework him
---
According to the wiki they both have a move speed of 230% while running
---
There's this new bug that I think happens to everyone no matter what where if you get hooked in the basement, you fall through the map and all you see is white and your character is infinetly falling. It only goes away if you get guided by a teammate on comms and jump from a height or get downed and picked up by the killer. For you you're just falling, for everyone else, you're bumping into walls and screaming internally
---
you said it, not me.
---
That's all I can do
---
Ooo, peice of candy
---
Yeah agreed. It‚Äôs too late in the rank season to find much at rank 20.
---
Even faster is 3 people on 3 different gens, plus the killer showing up won't completely stall progress.
---
I mean, unless you're down to the last gen with ruin still up I guess?
---
I'm mocking you. You're complaining about a Trapper using his traps. It's ridiculous.
---
Very cool BVHR
---
Srsly, I expected Survivor queues would be way better because everyone would be rushing to play the new Killer.  Survivor queues last night were still atrocious for purple ranks to the point where I was matched against a poor Rank 16 doctor.
---
Seems like a pretty good job to me.
---
Thats why id like to see how many times he pipped because a pip is a personal win. Also this doesnt really mean anything he could be bad himself, taking data from the games of one player isnt representative of the game as a whole.
---
Stop reposting ur own post u twat
---
Don't need to post four times
---
Damn... Legion said screw this and just straight up shot yo ass...
---
I mean yes I do think of it like that but I do sometimes want a chilled game tbh you get me ?
---
Like others have said, it‚Äôs late in the rank season, so rank 20 will struggle to get games. Also a new killer just came out and that usually throttles killer queues for a few days.
---
Prayer beads yes. Collision is fair too.
---
Personally i dont think the window vault was an issue. Not on a 110% speed killer

I get that. But this game fails to be chill a lot of the time. XD it can be quite frustrating.
---
Who says you have to complete all the archive missions?  Just skip it.
---
Or at least the tree hitboxes. Try to throw a longrange hatchet, it touches a stray pixel and disappears
---
Agreed, I never played the Legion in that state, so I never really knew what I was missing. I'm just hoping for some type of change for the Legion that would be for the better.
---
Well yes but I wouldn‚Äôt mind closer to my rank I‚Äôm rank 8 and getting matched with 2‚Äôs I‚Äôm not saying every match in with red ranks but there‚Äôs a positive correlation to it
---
Pretty sure somebody already did when he first dropped on the PTB
---
I did it before the patch , I want even intending to do it so I had billy and I just happen to down the person near the basement and then I made a circle and back to the basement to down another , this cycle happened and I got 8 basement hooks on my first game .
---
I mean...can I get healed too though...
---
Thanks
---
You‚Äôre talking about the bug and I‚Äôm not. This was a rant about an asshole who got salty, was losing and DC‚Äôd. I‚Äôve also had the bug but its got nothing to do with the fact that people are still DCing over salt. Did I say you should just sit and take it? I literally said I understand people DCing because of the bug but shocker thats not what this rant post was about.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten stuck in forever. Last time I got stuck it was with Clown on the exact same map, but in a tiny ass tree couldn‚Äôt even hit people or throw bottles. Gas got stuck in the tree with me
---
Excellent, enjoy!
---
They're working on it, chill the fuck out
---
That‚Äôs why I like gf he can tbag back to the survivors Ha !
---
Don‚Äôt think so honestly but there are more people playing in live servers also
---
It was an accident the app didn't close when I submitted it so I did it again. Sorry
---
ok
---
Yeah but it sounds like the penalties will be severe.
---
To me it should have allowed it first time, slowly increased and then reset after so long to allow for disconnects during bugs.
---
I mean shit someone posted a video of an invisible killer earlier. I had that on the ptb. Whats the fucking point in playing when you‚Äôre desynched and getting hit by nothing cus the killer is on the other side of the map in your game but on his game hes right behind you.
---
Of course people will get pissed off and disconnect
---
Exactly. I did every challenge in Tome III except that one. No sweat.
---
Was literally just thinking the same thing. It‚Äôs happened to me multiple times already. üòë
---
Ha i will do for as long as she wants to play with her dad! Wont be long b4 im not cool enough ! :'(
---
Clourophobias another good one
---
Thats the plan!
---
I think he has a low skill floor and a higher skill ceiling than people were expecting. I'm loving it. I got *wrecked* for the first few games until I got a feel for how he plays and a handle on his movement and attacks, after which I started 3-4king most games (Red ranks).
---
I love playing Ghostface but I don't have teachable Nurses or Thanatophobia. So it's not often pretty.
---
Lol aight, my bad I guess. Didn't really browse the sub for the last few days. No need to be an ass

I managed to get it on my second try luckily. First attempt got fucked over due to a key. Fun stuff /s
---
4k hour pig main says otherwise
---
https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz/videos
---
Yeah for real these bugs literally just happened
---
Ah sorry to misunderstand. I still think it's more decent to save basement for third hook until there's a fix, especially since the screen bug persists beyond just being hooked. The challenge is still doable without just making it so survivors can't even play ;w; (I play killer and survivor. I won't be taking them basement til 3rd phase).
---
An the mobile version it won't let me if you could tell me how that would be great
---
Nope it does nothing
---
So you‚Äôre telling me, if there‚Äôs 3 gens left, and two people, and both are on death hook, they should both try to pick the other up? Even if it‚Äôs an obvious bait trap? That seems counter productive to anybody surviving at all. 
---
Because what happens is you pick them up and then they are immediately downed and then they down you. Or you both get away until one gets caught and it repeats again until he‚Äôs able to slug both. I‚Äôve been in games where we keep picking each other up 5-10+ times. It‚Äôs never ended with one or both getting to escape. 
---
So yeah I left him there because I wanted the game to end and to survive. Just as I would‚Äôve wanted him to do to me if it were the other way around.
---
It makes you feel better about all the time you spent playing the game... maybe.
---
Is sloppy worth swapping out for thana ?
---
okay but legit that would be so much fun.
---
I can confirm it works. Tested it in KYF
---
it makes u start from lv 1 all over again
---
It would be better if the killers were actually against each other, they have to kill more survivors than the opposing killer. They could either down a survivor and sacrifice them, removing the survivor from the game. Or mori the survivor and making them respawn in a different part of the map (it still counts as a kill). You'd want to start the game by sacrificing a couple survs so that less survs are in the gane to help each other out. And then, mori a few (for extra kills) then start sacrificing so that the other killer can't catch up.

The secret to having fun playing Oni on console is to get lucky enough to go against survivors who don't 360 and run in straight lines out in the open.

If you gameshare the game and are for example in the EU and use a US version of the game it won't show cells in the store and when you go to your console store you can buy them and they'll never go to your dbd because the game has to match the currency the cells were bought with. I bought my friend the dbd for his country, 3350 cells and some dlc's after figuring thisnout after sending tickets to bhvr. The only thing you can do is get a refund, buy the game in the right currency and then buy stuff on it. Otherwise it'll just never show up. After my friend got the correct version of dbd he could buy cells and it went to the account the only bug that happened was he couldn't buy outfits for the discounted price (the set) but it unfucked itself after a few hours.
---
Deadass this actually looks real.

I would give you an award if I could.

Thing is, I'm on PS4, and I had these errors before the ST update while searching for a game solo. But when I used the swf lobby, and played alone, I had 0 NAT type errors.
---
What if they have borrowed time tho
---
If not for being a game of the month last year I wouldn't have dbd, and yes, on PS4 the waits can take forever. 5-15 minutes for a match and that's not a guarantee either the killer doesn't up and leave IF he thinks it's a swf group. I think during the moonshine event it was the worst it ever been. I only got Feng Ming's outfit out of the 3 you could possibly get by playing. Some nights in a 3 hour span, I can get 5-6 matches. It seriously needs to be handled better. Then get into a match with a toxic killer who's been bullied previously, forget it.

I don't mind deep wound not being connected to the TR of the killer, actually. If it was based on distance, like 24 meters away it decreases, then I'd be fine. Not right now, though.
---
holy shit, this bug is annoying as hell :/
---
All the more reason why devs need to fix this ASAP. It's affecting a lot of players
---
Whether he is bad or not these games were played in the problem (red) ranks, yes? Is that not what the majority of this sub reddit complains about?
---
Wewlads, the pip card. I would assume the vast majority of players are like myself where they don't feel like they "won" unless they either 4k as killer or survive as survivor.
---
I would agree that taking games from one player isn't representative of the game as a whole but multiple people have gathered stats like in the last 5-6 months.
---
Not to mention the stats devs just released themselves. I know these stats are fucked in that they probably contain all platforms combined, and I know they probably include disconnects as a death but I would be incredibly surprised if those facts lead to a 20-25% increase in overall kills.
---
I usually don‚Äôt correct grammar but I just had the strong urge to this time idk why.
---
its all good im gonna give sprint burst a try for a couple games
---
Could very well be. But in any other context it doesn't really work. Hell my first few times being "exposed" I thought it meant the killer knew where I was at all times until the effect ended.
---
 It's one of those things the game doesn't really tell you what it is or what it means so you either have to figure it out or look it up and then when you do the 1st thing to come to mind is that it doesn't make any sense
---
Fucking love TCM

There isn't a single game company out there that can identify the cause of a bug, attempt a fix, test it and ship out a patch for multiple platforms after less than 24 hours of the patch deployment.

People need to chill the fuck out and stop posting this shit because they are already aware of it.
---
Laurie mains?
---
&gt;holy shit, this bug is annoying as hell :/
---
Not as much as these posts.
---
I'm not saying he's bad, but it may be because he has to actually hit a healthy survivor to get his power. NOT SAYING HE'S BAD, JUST SAYING WHY PEOPLE MAY THINK HE'S BAD!

He is the locker king, the god Dwight believes in. Fear his power or be cut down by his chainsaw.
---
You could kill two, let em do the gems, then down one and open gate yourself b4 hooking.  Blood wardon helps
---
For me when I play killer my main rule is spare the last
---
I don't understand how this would be a good idea given how if both killers stayed together then a survivor would have no chance of doing anything as even at a pallet each killer could just go to either side of it and the survivors would likely go down within a matter of seconds at a time.
---
Definitely want something scary for him.
---
We won't get the OG NoEs looks, but I'm sure they can come up with something.
---
I will literally sacrifice myself to endgame if killers punish farmers.
---
WELP, NOW I DONT GTE A JB, I SHALL LISTEN NEXT TIME! FUCKING BHVR.
---
well i am glad you made this post. i am Vixlune. you accused me of doing this to you on purpose, and when i tried to figure out what happened you banned me. i am glad to finally know what caused you to get stuck. i didn‚Äôt do it intentionally. and i am sorry if the other players in the game took advantage of you getting stuck. i left after i got up, so i didn‚Äôt see. (i think you said someone flashlighted you?) if you would have added me, i would have tried to help you. like let you hit me or something. sometimes in the past i saw a killer get stuck and if they hit me they could get out. i‚Äôll make sure to avoid this area so no one else gets stuck there. if someone does get stuck i‚Äôll try to help them get out. thanks for the informational video &amp; good luck in your future games. :) i hope they can fix this glitch soon.
---
I've played like 10 games today and I have yet to get put on the new map yet I have faced a the oni 7 of those times
---
How did they do it so easily in Death garden and drop the ball so hard with DBD, people have been asking for it for years now, and yet a dead game gets a more innovative update than this cash flow money maker for them
---
Yeah. The worst part is even if you manage to navigate out of the basement, it still seems to affect you until you‚Äôre picked up again. I guided my friend out and she still couldn‚Äôt see.
---
That is the cutest thing I've seen all day. Made me smile a lot. I love this I wish you and your family happiness
---
Sadly, the rank shows only the amount of hours you played this season. Most of people reach red ranks if they are playing consistently either they want it or not. 
---
However.
---
The main problem is that you will match up with people who are also red ranks, BUT might have thousand upon thousand hours of gaming. If these guys are in your survivor team, you will either get carried by them and technically this will be a 3v1 or you'll get matched with people of the similar level and red rank (80-300 hours or so) and then the team won't make it most likely. Regardless, your possible red rank teammates with bagillion of hours will be very frustrated with your playstyle, since it will be... rather careful and different from what is considered an optimal one. At 84 hours people don't really have the game sense yet. It's normal.
---
If the killer that you are facing is also red ranks, chances are that he really knows what he is doing. Then the team will die with 5-4 gens unfinished. Reasons being:
---
- New survivors of red ranks can barely hit Ruin skillchecks.
---
- New rank 1 survivors played waste all the pallets in the first minute of the game.
---
- New red rank survivors hide and waste time crouching rather than doing objectives or saving.
---
- New survivors run Self-care and heal after every hit, even if there is Sloppy, Mangled, Rusty blade, you name it. 
---
- These survivors usually go down easier. 
---
And, well, hence the frustration of lots of survivors :/
---
Okay you're personal experience doesn't discredit the facts.

---
What, how people can have different queue times?
---
What is the bug exactly?
---
Lol, nice edit!
---
Have you never played any other games? All games have bugs and glitches throughout. All that differs is how big the team is, and therefore how much time they can afford to spend on ironing them out. Dead by Daylight has a relatively small team for a multiplayer game, and they do their best. At the end of the week, they are really good at taking out a large percentage of bugs. Every minor update comes with 20 bug fixes. And they know the bugs are there because of their amazing communication with the community. The bugs can be caused my anything, and you have no idea how difficult it is to iron them out. All in all, these devs have done amazingly recently with their release of balance, content and bug fixes.
---
Yeah, these posts on Reddit sure do ruin my Dead By Daylight experience. Devs, pls stop these posts before you patch the bug!
---
Ad hominem.
---
Accurate as fuck
---
TRY TRADE SCHOOL?
---
All games were played in rank 1-2. So i Black pipped a lot/pipped a lot. Rarely ever depipped. General rule of thumb for me is 2 gens, 2 Mins of chase, 2 unhooks, 2 totems.
---
Games get dragged out a lot since people dont want to Power through ruin

---
Yah there not working on PS4 for me either. I used up a whole green med kit last night with both gauze add ons and Botany in which I can fully heal myself 3 times. But it was gone and broke at almost full health the first time I used it and left me at 98% healed.
---
I was like wtf! Then the basement glitch thru limbo and no wiggle meter, ect ect...
---
This game is total trash and the devs keep making it worse and worse with every update and the PTB release 2 weeks before is a total joke and none of those ass wipes at BhVR know what they are doing. This game needs to have a fresh set of well qualified coders in the gaming field to get this baby back on track!
---
Right? I‚Äôve always wanted to know what that range is! My guess is about 6 meters, but that‚Äôs assuming they followed a similar guideline to Breakout so no way to know, I guess.
---
speaking of lighting, they should REALLy fix Steves hair. Most of the time it's literally orange. I never see it be brown like in the show

Explain to me why they can‚Äôt patch anything like the lobby issues, and how it takes 3 years to integrate a lobby for SWF in general that doesn‚Äôt kick you out after every game? These are beyond basic and don‚Äôt even require being in a game, and those are just two basic examples of what they‚Äôve done wrong. I‚Äôm not trying to sound entitled, I bet you‚Äôre the type of person who‚Äôd scream bloody murder if they took the game down for a week to try and resolve everything.

---
Should I correct your sentences too?
---
Every game that get a lot of updates has bugs, as a example you could see LoL.
---
It doesnt matter what you feel is a win. The game awards a win with a pip, a draw with a black pip, and a loses as a down pip. Someone can do nothing the entire game and escape through the hatch, but he will depip and someone can pip and not escape because the game knows escaping is a team effort and therefore awards you with a pip if it fills you contributed enough to personally win. The sample size of a few people is the problem not how many matches they play or over how many months. There are also some sampling issues even if you tool data from all players at rank 1 since id wager there is a larger amount of the player base percentage wise that makes up rank 1 survivor than there are rank 1 killers percentage wise because it is more difficult to pip as killer because of the emblem system. In regards to the bhvr stats that were released, they mean literally nothing, bhvr even tweeted saying that you cant draw any conclusions about the state of the game from them. Id hope most people would know that when it said bubba on average performs better than nurse and that freddy is the highest performing killer in the game.
---
Did you collect any other stats? Such as the average time it took for the first gen to pop, second, third, etc. or average chase times? Od be interested to see those. Also wouldnt saying that your teams often couldnt work through ruin suggest that they were weak? That would kind of explain why you didnt escape often especially since killers at rank 1 consistently play well and if your teams werent working through ruin they weren‚Äôt consistently playing well.
---
A literal gameplay mechanic vs a bug
---
Sick nasty. Good thing they spent the time to make a graphic for a status update image. Na but the devs are doin a great job
---
No shit, what I'm talking about is they knife the window and it hits me even though my vault animation finished a second ago
---
I know you‚Äôre going to scream at me for saying this, but this comment makes it absurdly obvious that you haven‚Äôt played Huntress. Especially on console. If you did, you would have first hand knowledge of how close hatchets can be to a survivor model and not hit. They seriously slide right by their side.
---
Yeah, getting angry and swearing at people really makes you look like a real nice dude lmao
---
how many newborns have you seen with teeth?
---
I get why on PC, since people played him already on PTB
---
But over the past two days on Xbox I've ran into maybe 3 Onis, only one of which actually played him and didn't just M1 (should it be like RT for console?)
---
I‚Äôm doing tome three and I‚Äôm stuck on getting kills in the basement. Don‚Äôt know if I should continue ?
---
Uhh....what? I just checked my recent posts and I see nothing about offerings and certainly no bitching about them. Care to elaborate?

You guys never stop complaining. Devs cant just roll out a patch in less than a day after their announcement. Also the argument where they only make cosmetics is invalid, there are literally separate departments of BHVR that work on different things. The art team is entirely separate from those who work on the game mechanics.

Double the Legion, double the fun

I type ez sometimes when I die because I did some obviously dumb stuff like accidentaly going in a locker instead of vaulting a window

I‚Äôm not raging at you, I‚Äôm just pointing out that the devs have been working on a lot of things. Lobby issues and latency are difficult to sort out because it‚Äôs such a complicated issue. The small team size means that they can‚Äôt be as solid as other game companies. Also, about the original post, if they shut the game down for a week, it wouldn‚Äôt actually help anything. It‚Äôd just mean that people couldn‚Äôt play for a week.
---
Sounds like someone isn‚Äôt having a good time playing Oni. Either that or you‚Äôre theorising why he‚Äôs the worst killer based on what‚Äôs written on paper. I‚Äôve only been getting better with him the more I play and I‚Äôm completely dominating survivors. Everything you‚Äôre saying is purely hypothetical but in practice I can guarantee you he is incredibly powerful. Getting the first few hits has posed be no problem. The Oni excels at wounding multiple survivors and constantly getting his power through blood orbs that survivor leave lying around everywhere. 
---
Jungle gyms pose little threat considering the reach of his slam attack goes over the vault, meaning he can still down survivors even after they‚Äôve reached the other side due to the shape of the attacks AoE being a straight line ahead of him. 
---
Actually play him and spend time with him before jumping to conclusions that he‚Äôs the worst killer in the game.
---
Dude. You can‚Äôt even make a relevant post other than ‚Äútypical child bitching‚Äù yet my post literally is asking for feedback on the game, not another toxic DbD player who just wants to blow off steam for no reason. And you follow up with ‚ÄúI agree with part of this‚Äù. Keep paying your bills and working since it seems to validate your thoughts on unrelated topics LOL.
---
First picture is what happened when I was hooked the first time (dark screen). Second picture is what happened when I was unhooked (character is basically floating with arms raised and hair blowing in the wind). Unable to interact or play whatsoever until being hooked again and then play returns to normal. Anyone experience this?
---
Name one survivor before Kate besides Bill that didn't come with an additional free cosmetic built-in
---
Are you using nemesis?
---
Fun fact: usually when a post is tagged with "meme" its a joke. Who shit in your Cornflakes?
---
But it wouldnt be for the better. It wouldnt even be a ‚Äúbuff‚Äù because the strategy is not good and wont get you more than 1 kill against good survivors. The problem with the strategy and why legion got gutted in the first place is because the chase is non existant.
---
Don't mind the strange perk choice. Friend jumped into a KYF so I could test Oni. Could hardly see them when they crouched into the grass.
---
That lbp music speaks volumes
---
Nope, too poor to even get the perk. Just like the character concept
---
Slows opening presents just a little bit
---
my apologies i thought this was yet another post about the hook bug.

You‚Äôre just a fuckin noob little baby killer lmao

Only kidding. In all seriousness, those are very valid points.

No worries.
---
The Entity's realm ain't got shit on Todd Howard's realm.
---
People don't like losing, that's what it comes down to. Some can be mature enough about it being just a game, some take it as a personal insult. I mean, they sucked enough to die so I guess it is personal.
---
Ignore it just say ur bad lmao
---
To make matter worse the mods ain't doing shit about ppl posting about the same shit over and over again
---
A good chunk of her add ons are useless.
---
An entire function of her power is never actually used if the survivors play efficiently.
---
That reflects poor design regardless of whether she's weak or strong.
---
Myers = top tier
---
Ok, was it Pig match?
---
I‚Äôve noticed every Oni has just been proxy camping and not demon dashing in chase at all. In fact I never got downed by a demon dash at all. Just skillfully bloodlusted or PWYFed. Dont blame them in the slightest but its a shame because I was going to get Oni with shards.
---
Alternative: Match ends in less time than it took to get into the match because the Killer decided that no one is allowed to have fun.
---
As a Myers killer main, agreed
---
Fun - 9,000,000 out of 10
---
Oni exists tho
---
Damn it couldn't guess Otis from Ho1C/Devil's Rejects, but now I really want him in the game, complete with him yelling "RUN, RABBIT, RUN" as his terror radius instead of a heartbeat.
---
When did this game become family friendly?
---
Yep, getting hooked in the basement can sometimes cause you to fall through the world on your screen.
---
They could be getting the tome challenges. There   are multiple challenges that require basement hooks. Unless they flat out told you they are abusing it then they could have been getting tomes.
---
No respect for anyone who chucks players in the basement knowing full well it renders the entire match unplayable for them, leaving them either to DC (and rightfully so in this case) or wait to die. I feel you though. I dealt with a basement camping Insidious Bubba exploiting the bug. He went out of his way to take two Survivors all the way to the basement from the opposite end of the map since another bug prevented them from wiggling free so when they both ended up in lost in that expanse of nothingness upon being hooked they disconnected. He proceeded to do it two the two of us that were remaining. I don't know how someone could get any satisfaction winning a match playing that dirty.
---
Those 15 seconds can definetely matter or turn into alot more depending on who you are playing against, but yeah, often it doesn't.
---
I‚Äôve had some trouble getting hits at close range but for the most part it‚Äôs all about getting used to the feel of it. I‚Äôve honestly not been having as much trouble as other people seem to be having.
---
@tnormus
---
Do not go any further. Stay where you are or go back to green ranks
---
Had a killer earlier kill me right above the stairs to the basement. He kindly walked me out to a different hook. I don't know who the Oni was, but I thank him
---
Wait what are the changes?
---
No you weren't asking for feedback. You were straight up bitching and trashing the devs. "I'm sick of people backing up these devs" really now? This game is made by a small indie company. This isnt a triple a title. The amount of work these devs put in on the regular is actually impressive to say the least but you just ignore all the good things they've done, especially over the past year and just bitch and moan about a few bugs. Its childish. Grow the fuck up
---
Nerf oni please bhvr
---
What are you trying to get from posting this? Just don‚Äôt play the game, simple. Some of us enjoy the same old same old.
---
Happened to me yesterday and I had to check reddit to make sure I wasn't the only one
---
The game is too killer centric. Okay. You say that after killers who need to be buffed are either getting ignored or straight up nerfed. There isn‚Äôt anything wrong having a skill gap for red ranks, of you rework that, then it‚Äôs going to be like survivor red ranks, over saturated with mediocre players who got boosted to the rank or simply aren‚Äôt meant for the rank. I‚Äôm not trying to be toxic, but many games balance their stuff backed off of their higher ranked players, people who put in the most hours, money, and dedication to the game. Balancing the game around the rank twenties would be inane.
---
Oh and while were at it, since you want to go through my profile and critique 1 post I've made I'll do the same. Damn near 2020 and your playing runescape LOL
---
Yikes, I think we should just leave this game to the toxic players who are already ruining it for everyone. I don‚Äôt want to sound insensitive but most of these players should seek professional help with their mental health.
---
Are you playing with a controller or on console, because there are no dedicated servers on console yet, it‚Äôs just a laggy killer.
---
What kinda independent film?
---
Is that right? I thought they were out already (at least that's what I was told).
---
Always want the abilities at the ready though
---
The level of set off one of the survivors got when I said that was a fun game yesterday was legendary.
---
You're not even on pc
---
It‚Äôs honestly very mediocre. Old Freddy slowed down gens by 50% at base. New Freddy needs his 2 strongest addons to slow down gens by just 21%. Also, it‚Äôs easier for survivors to stay awake.
---
What‚Äôs the counterplay to Forever Freddy? Stay awake. Boom, countered. Honestly, not even remotely close to the strongest build in the game. Highly overrated, just annoying to go against
---
I hate both of the maps because of the fucking color scheme making fit so that I can‚Äôt see anything
---
You're not a new player at purple ranks though.
---
Pfft hahaha not tryin to be rude but ofc they will bodyblock so their friend escape anyway gl in your games
---
Botany doesn‚Äôt increase charges. FYI one heal is 16 charges. BHVR only has a small team and try their best to fix things. They are aware of the basement glitch and are working to fix it.
---
Good luck getting banned for exploiting a bug.
---
Hell yeah man, it‚Äôs a great game and consists of barely any toxic people like you. It has more players than DbD, and they rolled out OSRS mobile which made it possible for me to play again. I have no problem with that game, what‚Äôs your issue?
---
Omg I got my first 4k with the pig as well lol
---
Essentially a better moniter and abuse but you gotta work for it. I like it.
---
Hey I have an excellent idea, lets go to the basement!
---
The tomes are there for quite a while. It shouldn't take too long for this bug to be fixed. Have a bit of respect and just?? ?dont??? abuse a gamebreaking bug???
---
I hope he wasn't using insidious. He kept revving his chainsaw like he was celebrating how "good" he is.
---
Godspeed
---
Yeah no. I can't see \*\*\*\* in front of me, dark maps are the bane of my existence.
---
Put a stealth or trap killer there and I'm fucked even more.
---
On another note people also claim that this mode would somehow be significantly survivor sided,which is entirely possible, but I think the real reason nobody would play it is because for survivor it would be incredibly boring given they either do nothing except gens or they go down with no chance or hope of stalling or evading killers. Lastly, the games lore is already built around the idea that the killers are kept apart by the entity intentionally as otherwise they likely would fight each other.
---
True. Especially if it‚Äôs a trapper or a hag. I‚Äôve played hag before and sometimes it won‚Äôt say where you can put a trap so you have to make little shifts in your location. It‚Äôs looks like one is lingering but they aren‚Äôt. [This is what I call camping. ](https://twitter.com/allaboutsplat/status/1202416262975852545?s=21)   You can see my teammates coming from very far away.
---
Sloppy, thanataphobia, nurses and ruin would do the trick
---
Not necessarily, I stopped using ruin a while ago cuz I got sick of the totem being cleansed too quick. I like pop goes the weasel instead, that is the clown's perk. I got it from the shrine though so I haven't actually played him so can't say what he's like.
---
It doesn't extend your field of view just the terror radius aspect of the perk
---
Looks like a Halloween movie I haven't seen yet

That's the point. I got the "survivor found" prompt like 15 or 16 times or something and killed everyone. It only gave me 2 points, which isn't even what it says on the emblem description. Hence, it is broken.
---
He also naturally comes with the perk BBQ and chili. It's definitely meant to hook and immediately go for another survivor. Insidious doesn't really help when you sit there revving the chainsaw and swinging it over your head while staring at the survivor.
---
I wonder if BHVR will actually ban anyone for abusing the bug. Probably not...
---
You should‚Äôve asked them if there was a killer glitch would they respect it or abuse. Their tone would have changed real quick.
---
It has a huge phantom range tbh, more of a cone than directly in front of the locker.
---
Both, kinda hard to have good time with a killer who has absolutely no power against any decent survivor ;) I mean, if survivors are playing dumb he's absolutely destroying everyone, but so does Leatherface or even Legion. Getting first hits against good survivors is not easy. If getting hits without any power was easy, Clown would be absolute god and we all know he's not.  
---
Sweating your ass to get to even his power, while other survivors are rushing gens, just for one instadown or slugging fiesta and entity displeased doesn't seem fun to me...
---
Yeah, I'd say the majority of the community are good people but the other half are total nutjobs. I think it's because of how seriously people take this game. It's not a competitive game but a lot but i think a lot of the community treat it like its competitive. I for one often get insanely stressed while playing killer if I lose really bad.
---
Frankly on this sub it's hard to tell the difference between unfunny survivor hate and bad memes.

None, I mean, I used to play it when I was 10 years old.

Ok stop bitching about a bug you ain‚Äôt gonna explain
---
I ignored the basement hooks on purpose even if it might've provided advantage, Theres just no fun, I played survivor and this hag wouldn't hook anyone anywhere BUT the basement, dunno if she knew about the bug but uh...I felt the paim
---
Hehe. Ash hole.
---
Apply directly on the forehead
---
Inaccurate, the survivor isn‚Äôt calling the killer a camper/tunneller despite the fact that it was their teammates fault.
---
Damn, they finally added decapitation Moris
---
Went are you stalking Piggy? Leave her alone, you meanie!
---
Any respectable software company worth a damn would have reverted their breaking changes and fessed up to their mistake. Their release shit itself and instead of fucking rushing a hotfix or reverting the change, they've chosen to do jack shit all instead. We could point out that fucking QA seems to drop the ball every single release, but it's already fucking out here. So fucking handle it BVHR, you fucking jokes.
---
I've been basement hooked 3 times in the last 5 games and I've been bugged out of the game every single time. Two out of those three times, I've lost the game on my very first hook. Not to mention that other survs who are unaware of the glitch will throw the game trying to rescue you even though you can't contribute shit anymore. It's also fucking hopeless when you can't even disconnect because they added measures to punish people who do that with this fucking shit broken release. People are abusing the glitch on purpose because it's fucking 100% reproduceable. You can't even kill yourself and you have to wait the whole timer. Fuck you BVHR.
---
Only if it also gives the killer 50/75/100% more blood-points post game like bbq and STACKS. Otherwise this will just be a better borrowed time for swf groups to abuse. You run up to the hook pop a stip unhook. Use the endurance the stip gives you to tank the self damage and boom. Now you just unhooked the survivor in the killers face and their at full health POTENTIALLY WITH BORROWED TIME. 
---
If your gonna introduce a perk like that I damn well better be well compensated for that cheese.
---
I'm all for postponing the challenge to not make 4 other player's game miserable. That old saying:
---
*treat others as you would want to be treated* hits hard right now. Do I want to finish that challenge? Hell yeah, but not at the risk of making everyone DC/have a bad experience. You never know until the post game if that was someone's first game/impression of DBD.
---
Literally just scroll down one or two posts and someone else is complaining about the same bug that I‚Äôm talking about
---
But...
---
I have Borrowed Time AND Were Going To Live Forever. 
---
Sorry, but I gotta unhook ya.
---
? If you hold the sprint button and run away you can stop them from healing you
---
[NSFW](https://youtu.be/jn3YjQSvDzA)
---
I seriously hope you let that David go. He was just waiting there with his spooky flashlight and you shut the hatch in his face.
---
I‚Äôm going after the tome 3 challenge, where you hook two at a time in the basement. Can I still use the basement hooks? Please?
---
That‚Äôs too much work dude you gotta explain it to him.
---
I play on xbox, I've never had an issue with distance.
---
Damn typos. Ash doesn't deserve this.
---
those only exist in your imagination dude
---
Agreed
---
Just got reported for this. Didn't even know what the bug was. I just wanted my bloodpoints...
---
I wasn't sure about bans as I didn't dc so oopsie.
---
Some one had an idea that when a survivor dies a member of the legion leaves. I think this would work to counter any sort of end game issues plus it would be a stronger version of hags power with less charges and less uses.
---
They should block off the basement until it‚Äôs fixed

---
I would have let him go, If I didn't have a challenge to kill everyone.
---
Weird that you have him in your flair then.
---
Dude I'm saying. I've put 100 hours on the switch version and even in red ranks, survivors don't know how to play! I'm red on PC so it's easy to run killers but I haven't had an issue with killers slugging, more killers facecamp after getting ran for so long lol
---
Probably just me but I' can be right on their ass, go to swing, my frames vanish into the ether and the survivor is fine.
---
That would also be a good alternative
---
Only if you carry them back up and let them wiggle off once you get it
---
this dont work for me, the unhook button isnt even pressable :/
---
Look at him go...
---
I just DCed a match because of something similar.
---
Killer TR starts, I sprint burst away from the gen, he swings at the gen, somehow hits me 10 feet away.
---
Are you lunging?
---
Do it don‚Äôt let the survivors tell you how to play they don‚Äôt like it when we tell them so fuck em.
---
I‚Äôm not upset...just saying the other side. I would be upset if I was banned for it. No hate, I just keep seeing posts about banning killers for hooking in the basement. Your opinion is correct, abuse of bugs should be banned. But hooking in the basement is such a frequent occurrence it would be hard to enforce.
---
Yup.
---
Every killer slugs you say?
---
Dont?
---
But Oni is grey though.
---
imagine not getting the most obvious sarcasm xd
---
I‚Äôm a total novice and don‚Äôt take any of it personally. I literally haven‚Äôt played a console game since N64 or PS2, so I‚Äôm basically relearning the wheel. I‚Äôm just enjoying myself because I love the horror genre as a whole. Bottom line, it‚Äôs a game. It‚Äôs supposed to be fun.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing that kinda bullshit. Keep playing, fuck em.
---
Dont like it? Dont play it then. It's really not that complicated. Judging by your two main arguments I can tell you aren't very good/experienced at the game so why bother making this post.
---
Yes it's cuteeeeee!
---
Legion would actually have a spot in the meta as a support for Oni.
---
Dude this isn't someone telling you not to run NOED this is asking you to literally not crash someones game.
---
Sounds like a 360 my friend.
---
Technically legion gang is a gang for a already made gang
---
I said this cus I‚Äôm bored
---
I had such a hard time seeing that it was a slug lol
---
Not my problem don‚Äôt play survivor then
---
I like shaking my head "no" as I approach a survivor trying to hide from me.
---
I played as Huntress and there are barely any lockers.
---
Lol you didn't make this tho. you took the picture.
---
Just ran dead hard for the first time today. Can confirm.
---
Take my down vote and use the points to slit your wrists
---
Idk i can do very well with huntress after a little practice but so far ive killed about a fifth of all survivors i come across.
---
idk what kinda queues you have but for me survivor is instant and killer is 15 minute waiting,  
---
tho im just rank 15 so idk
---
It's usually that fugly nerd, Dwight.
---
Pretty good but you shouldn't have used pen at all
---
i agree but we all know they wont cause they need money.
---
Generally survivors get longer queue times in the night america
---
Yes you do. Oni can track you if you run no mither, but since he mainly slugs people you also have a chance to get up every time.
---
Possibly but I know to move with them or wait a sec then swing into them. I'm just frustrated atm bc in the last few games I've kept being matched with high red ranks as a low purple and had barely any frames, so I'll get two hooks if I'm lucky.
---
Nope, no real way to. Autodidact/Inner Strength/Second Wind can help on the healing end of things but that‚Äôs about it
---
What's confusing me is that this is a gamebreaking bug that coincided with the most recent update, but the decision to roll back hasn't been made. I heard a figure on Discord that you guys had indicated 1-2 weeks for a fix, which if true indicates this isn't a priority at all.
---
You know I didnt take time into effect for the queue times. I probably should've thought of that first. But then I'd still think killers would take the same time.
---
Fr Pig is still underrated despite her nerfs.
---
it's the opposite in red/purple ranks. 10 minutes in queue as solo survivor at rank 5 atm
---
Yeah, but it turns out more people want to be scared at night
---
To be fair, hooking in the basement is usually the best option when possible and they may have not known about the glitch... also basement challenges.
---
1. SWF squads play at night after school/work, so a lot more survivor players
---
2. Survivor archives
---
I love video games.
---
in high res, Steve‚Äôs hair looks real nice
---
Yh it‚Äôs annoying af, if a killer starts to lose they just basement hook. It sucks especially with dc punishments coming in today.
---
Freddy has jumpropes that bust the game into a snails pace.  It's absolutely cancer but it's a big reason to play him over Clown who can't even do anything worth it with his addons.
---
Playing with no mither against an oni running Iron Maiden is enough to question life
---
Claudette was between the pallet and the ground so she was able to use D4C to escape to a neighboring dimension
---
It's extremely strong if survivors are too lazy to wake up or you are good at spreading the pain.
---
"Fixed a bug that added a fully functioning UI allowing people to see one another's levels."
---
Her main power is kinda useless tho since survs always get the trap off quickly and it takes ages to reset :(
---
You can try waking up.
---
I watched an Oni down somebody right next to the basement, and proceed to take them to another hook instead.  
---
It was beautiful. The 4K he proceeded to do afterwards anyway was not.
---
Well yes what I‚Äôm saying is the actual crossover would be cool
---
Then they deserve the penalty
---
That's called prayer beads spirit
---
Yeah I though it was an image of him not some faggy ass name. Also who care dbd is fucking retarded now. The whole community just autisticly screeches at each other for nerds on this and that. And they‚Äôre killing there better game at the end of the year. It‚Äôs a bitch fest my guy. Soft people yelling at a shit company because they‚Äôre ass hurt over everything
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the primary reason I know they won‚Äôt. But it‚Äôd still be great for the long term health of the game if they did
---
Don't insult my man The Oni like this, he doesn't deserve it
---
Hi there, another mom here. I actually got my sons into gaming back during an expansion of World of Warcraft (WoTLK for anyone interested). Fast forward to my boys grown up and the oldest plays games with  my granddaughter, my youngest is in school and we occasionally get on Killing Floor 2 and play a few rounds together when our schedules allow (we live in different states now).   I think trying to learn the community helps. Keeping an eye on them when things get too toxic definitely helps, because it can get that way. Enjoy DbD, good luck gaming, I definitely have enjoyed my time  gaming, its been an amazing ride for me and my family.
---
Sometimes rng is dumb but the traps still waste the survivors time, and her dash is more useful than people give it credit for.
---
Prayer beads trapper and prayer beads billy
---
Tomorrow it‚Äôs activated
---
You really make me believe that there are such things as entitled killers
---
Tge people who do this also then blame the killer and say they're camping.
---
Ruin and noed suck a lot of the fun out.
---
The smugness behind it. The content they have behind the context of how they say it. There are multiple things to take into account indlucing what you yourself mentioned.

Lol don't make me growl at you too.
---
What is the bug? If I put survivors in the basement does it make it unplayable for them?
---
Sadly it seems it's not an area of the game but maybe a server issue. I was also under the assumption when it happened that people already figured out how to bait killers into doing something so they couldn't play their game anymore (much like Killers that are abusing the basement knowingly at the moment).
---
I've unbanned you and the other person who came into chat after the game.
---
Oh shit TIL. Thanks friend!
---
they didnt even really nerf him, they made him more comfortable to play and very slightly less annoying to play against. the only real nerf is not procking stbfl and sloppy and, tbf, good survivors wont heal vs legion anyway so those perks were never really good on him anyway
---
Ahhh forgive me I only started playing a month ago and don‚Äôt know much yet! But ah, I thought she was eaten by cannibals not the other way around. I seeee. Thanks! :)
---
I can agree the frames on my xbox get frustrating
---
Survivors abused the shit out of the Wake Up and Sprint Burst bugs...

If it‚Äôs a shitpost I sure as hell don‚Äôt understand what was meant to be funny about it lol

Gotta find a SWF group. I can't play solo anymore. I gotta have at least one person playing with me cause my teammates are usually useless as well
---
Cumbacha
---
From Hell's heart I stab at thee!
---
Being honest I think the legion is weak enough to actually have it be balanced to have 2 of them. Literally just get rid of mending and then it's two m1 killers against 4 survivors.
---
By it downing multiple people with one use of the power?
---
I just started getting back i to the game and this reminds me of a match I had. I was playing Ghostface and i ended up hooking two survivors and they left. Obviously two remained but there was no genertors done so i decided to play 'nice' if you will.
---
Whenever i hooked them, i would walk away from the hook to give them more of a chance and on both of their second hooks i let them both heal. I had this game in my head where whoever i find first, straight up dies, the second may take the hatch, if they can find it before me.
---
I roamed the map for a good minute or two and i still found the hatch first, the last one couldn't even open the door in time. I still feel kinda bad about it but it was my 'unspoken rules' and it was fun.
---
8/10 would kill Bill again

Who is that?
---
I keep seeing his face since the Oni was announced, and I have no idea who that dude is. Something to do with Onions? Is he a Shrek Mega-fan or something?
---
I had this same thing happen to me earlier vs doc might be a glitch on him.
---
Robert Englund Freddy, Needle Glove, and Sunglasses Freddy are all on my wishlist
---
Ok. That sounds like fun and a great way to hang out while doing something you all enjoy. Wow is a bit bigger then dbd but i am getting some of it and some league of legends. So much to take in. But so much fun.
---
Killer‚Äôs a lot more stressful is the thing. I find even solo survivor more relaxing than killer
---
I'm a Survivor main so what I usually try to do is not go down in front of the basement if I'm going down. You should just try to avoid that area of the map and if the killer is running iron grasp or something which is usually unlikely since I haven't found any killers who intentionally try to get you in the basement to exploit the glitch, try avoiding that area completely. If you have to do the killer shack gen and the basement is located there, don't be afraid to throw down the shack pallet.
---
I haven't went as far as to avoid the area of the map where the basement is but what I have been doing is trying to finish the nearest gen to the basement in order to make no excuse to go to that end of the map. If the killer shows up, I loop him around the shack and then rotate to the nearest map tile I can use as I'm a good looper but if you aren't, just loop around the shack once or wherever the basement is located and use the shack pallet or a different pallet to create distance. Then run away from the area completely.
---
Is this getting released in the next patch?  I can't seem to find it in the store.
---
Basement challenges in the archive and DC penalties, and THIS is the time this glitch shows up. Ffs lmfao. On top of that, one or two more weeks of this.
---
I think the real issue lies with the fact that both sides, killer and survivor, have the ability to give a big fuck you to balance. Killers, perks, items, addons, offerings. There‚Äôs options for both sides to go nuclear. 
---
It is not bad to try your hardest every match. Go ham, do your best. This game is competitive, one against the other, and testing your skills against the other is the point. 
---
The thing is, a team of survivors can really screw a killer out of a fun and fair game. That‚Äôs sweaty. They can choose to win before the game starts by all bringing the shiniest toolboxes, the best meta perks, etc.
---
The same goes for killer. Ebony Mori Huntress with a Iridescent Head and Infantry Belt? You‚Äôre killing all those survivors if you‚Äôre halfway decent.  That‚Äôs sweaty.
---
Theory?
---
Thats not steve....thats ET as steve
---
*Sweats in shadow shroud*
---
Clown the most neglected dlc killer :(
---
great point lol. remember when ghostface was shit because he had like 20-30s of exposed time?
---
Okay, so this happened to me on the Switch console almost immediately after I posted this comment. Oh no. Haha.
---
I'm sick of safety pips because I was stuck with toddlers who could not avoid the basement.
---
"Maybe I won't have to play at 20 fps with this update"
---
Every chapter.
---
I know the normal advice is to just buy a pc, but the only game I play is dbd. That would be a large investment just for one game that shouldn't really have problems running when I can play Warframe just fine.
---
I can't believe I'm saying this but it's ok to have fun and do something funny in game every now and then lmao
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, you‚Äôre right
---
... If no one played Survivor then no one could play Killer, you stunted reprobate.
---
I played a game as Oni and the second I hooked the person in the basement doing my tome challenge for it, their model was sent skywards like it had blasted off. There was no way for survivors to save him and I felt so bad for him, I let the other ones finish the gens and escape while I stayed in the basement just looking at what had happened. The guy was really pissed off but I hadn‚Äôt been on the Reddit at all today to find out about it. I‚Äôm ignoring the basement until it‚Äôs fixed and hook accordingly.
---
To the David that I sent to the heavens on Xbox, I‚Äôm so sorry :(
---
damn did you at least have them spit on it before you let them go balls deep in your ass? or did they put it in your mouth, cuz you're pretty clearly sucking their dick hard too huh
---
I haven't heard or seen anything about it before this post.
---
Ok
---
Bro if they're waiting till you open the door then they're not dicks. If they're nice enough to let you get more objective points then it's better than nothing.
---
Yes, problem is you won‚Äôt stay awake long enough to even complete a gen. Pretty sure falling asleep takes 60 seconds. Gens take 80 without accounting for Ruin, so you‚Äôll get a penalty eventually either way
---
Thing is you can get downed as far as possible from the basement but youll get brought there anyway because the wiggle bar is semi bugged as well
---
Yes, I said their work was amateurish and that the game is in a horrible state right now, their balls are clearly in my ass.
---
Also, I hope you never beg your girlfriend for anal since you seem to think pretty low of someone taking it in the ass.

People asking for 2vs8 while complaining about 1vs4 not being balanced \*eye roll\*
---
I love all of this content that you are drawing! Keep it up! I love seeing your work!
---
I haven't found any game breaking bugs yet
---
Pretty sure botany increases your healing efficiency, which effectively adds charges
---
Oni running at hyper speed from across the map looks like Shadow the Hedgehog.
---
I get you, it's day 2 if I'm not wrong so bans already are very unlikely to happen. I don't think anyone believes everyone already knows about it. As I said it happened to me multiple times and only reported one person. My guess is noone will get banned unless they make an official announcement that it's bannable. Also, people report all the time for no reason, you won't get banned if you don't deserve it.
---
You‚Äôre a legend
---
It increases healing speed, not efficiency
---
Survs are essentially skins, focusing on a single killer and not spreading yourself thin on survs is important for new players
---
Yes he does
---
@BVHR, Can you increase the likelihood of getting the higher rank character-specific perks in those character's bloodwebs? I get tired of seeing every perk except the ones specific to that character.
---
You don't happen to have a link to the file at all? I haven't played since before the Stranger Things DLC and would love to hear it!
---
Yes.
---
No one wants to play killer
---
I was banned for 7 days so i even cant play dbd
---
There is a glitch that makes it so you can't wiggle and turns your screen white while you're on the hook. Then it makes it black and after a while you'll be able to look around in an all blue area. You can't do anything else. That's pretty fucking game breaking.
---
A build that's always solid:
---
Whispers, M&amp;A (if you have doc), Enduring, Brutal Strength. 
---
A risky, but fun, build:
---
Make Your Choice, Enduring, Nurse's Calling, Surveillance.
---
I dropped the game a year ago for toxicity. Got death threats after matches and people sending me messages telling to kms. Now the game is way less toxic, but it's so buggy it's more unplayable than it was when I dropped it. See you all next year
---
I wish I could afford a PC as I used to... If you end up finding out how to fix it lemme know plz
---
Do you even know how hitboxes and servers work? Because 90% of the people complaining about them, don't.
---
No, he means blocking a hook. Putting people in the basement is a gameplay mechanic and ok, abusing the basement is not. 
---
(If I understand his comment.)
---
*cough cough* Mettle of Man *cough cough*
---
Lmao this is great! So much character in all 3 of Dwight, Ghosty, and Pig.
---
Imagine having to buy hag
---
this was made by the console gang
---
You can see survivors flying? Lol I didn't know that!
---
Sorry, just looked it up, you were right. But my other points still stand
---
As a console player, we don't all have tourettes.
---
Its not even that strong
---
The fuck is hiberantion? You want a guarenteed state from hooking people for running a perk? lmao what
---
Do you have a guide or video on how to loop? I‚Äôm pretty bad at it.
---
Go back to console and enjoy the nostalgic p2p bro.
---
I'm pretty sure most of us know what hit boxes are. Its the "box" that your character occupies that you can get "hit" at. Pretty damn self explanatory.
---
Nah I did, and it‚Äôs a TV not a monitor. I‚Äôm not shooting a movie so what do I care what it looks like. If you don‚Äôt like the way it looks then just keep scrolling. It‚Äôs not that hard, and it‚Äôs not that serious, I promise.
---
I cant stop seeing a little grin on his mask
---
You could say that about a lot of killers. Myers is made for camping so that he can stalk anybody that tries to save. Hillbilly is made for camping because he can instadown anyone trying to save. Pig is made for camping because she can crouch by a rock near the hook and rush anyone trying to save. Yet none of these killers camp anywhere near as often as leatherface killers. Which was why I was asking why leatherface killers, who start out with BBQ and chili, seem to only facecamp.
---
Lucky you! Lol. I just had a game where a huntress downed me and started bringing me to a nearby hook, then realized I couldn't wiggle and basement hooked me
---
That's still not good enough reasoning alone to just stop doing it without any knowledge from their perspective, sorry bud.
---
The real one not the iron chuckles
---
Watching ZubatLEL play any killer versus watching myself play killer**
---
I feel ya. All I ever play is solo because none of my friends play this game or they did at one point and stopped because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot Call of Duty‚Äù. Wouldn‚Äôt mind getting a static together for DbD nights on the PS4 at some point.
---
Its not even lag, they'll go to the edge of the map and smack the wall a few times then leave. I go to the gen and they teleport behind me and grab me
---
https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/winter-gifts
---
I hate to break it to you, but most of the people here have no idea what they're talking about in general.
---
I mean, I posted the difference between an average Game Designer salary ($56k a year) and a Computer Engineer ($87k  a year) and that that difference alone means they do care about what they're doing, and I was accused of dick riding and am sitting at a cool 22% upvote rate.
---
People just wanna bitch and moan and then wonder why the devs never take them seriously.
---
Why is nemesis so good with legion?
---
It should only be increased with teamwork.
---
It would be fun slown down, but would be SUPER forgiving. Everyone is happy
---
Survivors get to run.
---
Killers get to chase.
---
This shouldn't be ranked so everyone can have a good game, but no basement... Or camping.
---
Basically me but with killers. Like c'mon  entity just give me that sweet sweet BBQ and infectious fright for my Oni. All I gotta say is screw you entity.
---
New killer
---
Perks like slippery meat which gives you extra escape attempts on the hook or no one left behind which only gives you blood points if the exit gates are powered
---
Best way to learn survivor: Play as killer
---
Best way to learn killer: Play as survivor
---
thank you for your understanding. i appreciate it! and ah okay, i see. i‚Äôm not sure how i can go about preventing it from happening if it is server side... but now i can at least watch the killers more to try to help them if they got stuck. it‚Äôs not fun for survivors either (at least in my opinion) if the killer gets stuck.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure most of us know what hit boxes are. Its the "box" that your character occupies that you can get "hit" at. Pretty damn self explanatory.
---
I am certain that people don't know how hitboxes **work**, because they don't understand the influence of ping in the distance you are from the killer.
---
Lol entiled survivor
---
There's plenty of videos. Also keep in mind the meta for gf so you can kinda figure out the gf build while he prolly won't know yours.
---
More like ‚ÄúRAHHHHHHHHH!‚Äù
---
I may be able to assist, normally using a mic annoys the hell out of everyone in the house but they can deal for a bit someday
---
If a survivor is near you when you get picked up it can keep you from having a wiggle bar. More effective dribbling.
---
That‚Äôs fricking adorable. I wanna teach dbd hide and seek to my nephew now.
---
It was different for me last night. The killer tried to hook me at the basement, suddenly I was teleported to the corn field near the hatch!
---
No you can‚Äôt lmao. No one else can down multiple people in a second aside from Oni now
---
I just ran into my wiggle bar not working. Played 12 games today and this is the only one it goofed on. Still frustrating. :'(
---
With the frame rates anything less than tourettes is a blurry mess
---
I feel this so hard. I dont need all the frames id just like more than 20fps.
---
One's an exploit of a bug the killer knows is going to happen, one is being a dick. Terrible comparison.
---
Wait.
---
How would Plague and Pig as a duo work?
---
Just more boxes and fountains?
---
Get some back support bruh
---
that wasn‚Äôt exactly my question but it was a better answer
---
—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å –Ω–∞ –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–º —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–µ
---
How does using a mic annoy folks in your house? I mean if you have the chat audio playing through the television, that makes sense. But if it doesn‚Äôt then why does it bug them? Small potatoes, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
Nobody uses moniter and abuse for the fov increase
---
It use to be vice versa but dedicated servers changed that.
---
Frames have been shit on both consoles for months. In my experiences, just swinging at a Survivor can seriously mess up your FPS. 360s are nearly impossible to counter because of how crappy my frames get.
---
They‚Äôve released it to everyone when this chapter came out
---
Isnt there a pregame chat on pc? Cant you just ask what everyones rank is on that?
---
Spine Chill + Fixated and knowing where loops are and how to work them will help you a lot.
---
Clocks wake you up for 120 seconds I believe. It's also really easy to wake up in general.
---
You and me both. I can't believe it's been a year since the tweet with no information about the update.
---
He do be vibing though
---
You've probably heard it before and it still applies: G-I-T G-U-D
---
All depends on the team. Some teams will be doing absolutely nothing productive and you can kill them all really quickly, but some survivors are really good and while that one survivor loops you the other three are doing gens. In my opinion killer is much harder then survivor. If the team is good about doing gens then you have a very small chance of winning.
---
When I talk it's bothersome, it's not a very big house and the PS4 is in the secondary living room
---
CAPTURE THE SURVIVOR!!!
---
5 v 5 killers, they have to kill the opposing survivor first! The killer can hook killers!
---
Lol true
---
Oh, hey, I think you dropped your /s
---
It blows my mind that people launch their game for the first time after an update, are FORCED to look at this [screen](https://i.imgur.com/7h4AmkY.jpg) and then come to reddit to ask / talk about stuff that is written there.
---
The only thing that needs to happen is 
---
1) you use unnerving presence and
---
2) they do not open the exit gates.
---
So 4K, or 3k and a hatch, or whatever else is totally fine as long as the gate doesn‚Äôt open.
---
Yes consoles have the capacity of running games at 60 fps and also adapting the controls and sensativity of a controller . I understand that their priority is PC but man at least test the killer on console and verify that he/she can do the same on PC, I'm not an expert on the topic of how to fix it but I agree that the solution shouldn't be buying a PC.
---
All exclusives from codes besides Diatechh and bloodletting are free
---
I will never get as mad at solo survivor as i will at playing killer. But most the time even if my team does nothing they dont grief me so theres that.
---
The devs dont play outside of low ranks so that should be a red flag
---
Bothersome to talk? Man, your household must take the quote ‚ÄúSilence is Golden‚Äù to extremes. No disrespect.
---
There used to be a bug like this. It was basically impossible for killers to win. Also, until the playerbase grows, a new game mode would make queue times abysmal in either one or both gamemodes.
---
With that face, all hours are sad hours
---
More like still waiting for a fucking facial surgery
---
F
---
But that's a 2 v 3. Which doesn't work.
---
But friend's are epic!
---
But when it comes to holiday events, they'll delay it out the ass for getting pretty much no event.
---
That's a bummer. I won't be able to hit Red ranks because of work trip. Was this confirmed? :(
---
Sometimes I have the urge to DC when the killer connects a hit which totally shouldn't happen, but I grit my teeth through it because if I do that, it will ruin the other 3 survivors game. Also, yesterday I had a dc + one person killed himself just because the other guy dc-ed, with 4 gens up. Against r9 Freddy. Im r8. Freddy slugged the other survivor, Nancy, the whole game. The game ended up being almost a 30 min game with me kept getting Nancy up and looped the Freddy for 3 gens (I did one when Nancy was looping Freddy). Ended up dying on 3rd hook, but Nancy got out, and I felt really good about that. To those who dcs or kill themselves on hook just because you don't feel like playing with a dc, fuck you.
---
"Don't greed for a hook" lol what?
---
hahaha thats super gay bro
---
And people ask why I run STBFL
---
STABBY GANG RISE UP
---
Well holy shit, a new Bill cosmetic and it's free?  Yes.  Today is best day.
---
As a killer main, NOED is a crutch perk for bad killers. Fancy word games don't get around that. No killer should ever feel like their good at the game even remotely if they use NOED casually, I always imagine users of it either got bullied really hard in the past ingame or they're new to the game.
---
No... It isn't because the game is going to end soon "preventing gameplay" Isn't bankable but holding the game hostage is, which the Myers isn't doing.
---
Yeah bro, U get hit when the weapon is like 2 feet off of u
---
Wait till ya reach lvl 50
---
Remove Deep Wounds, rework Legion to be what another commenter suggested above, and give me back my balanced landing. And kindred is terrible now.
---
Because the patch is out for less than 48 hours...?
---
You are the reason I hate the community.
---
Bhvr has a huge disconnect from the general matches of there game. The least they work on balancing the better.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6bguw/has_anybody_else_gotten_this_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
What basement bug?
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a lot but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be due to Breakout. I play with three of my friends and none of them use that perk yet it happens to all of us almost every game
---
Hard to body block a basement though. At the end of day I care about winning more than I care that you might get the bug.
---
Whats going on with the basement?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6b0fc/dying_in_limbo_at_least_looks_neati_suppose/
---
he went for the hook at the exit gate instead of the nearer one away from it, causing him to get bodyblocked by all 3 that were waiting
---
You get that msg when you face a killer new to you
---
IIRC it's like the first 3 times you encounter a killer, you get their tips.
---
Just sounds like baby killer problems. Get a PC?
---
Would you like Christmas lights wrapped around the survivors so that you can see them too?
---
How long did this end up going for? The whole match?
---
My man got sent to the fucking shadow realm
---
Bruh, this game is 4 years old. It‚Äôs common, it shouldn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs really annoying if you grind the game, especially when the killer know about it.
---
Scarier then legion
---
Nice. Overall good game, except I notice some spots where if this didnt take place on console, you would have gotten downed. Like that first time that she missed you, for instance. She only missed because you can't turn your camera fast without being on a mouse and keyboard.
---
Still. Nice game, and nice to see a killer get punished for tunneling.
---
are you joking? You think a game breaking COMMON bug shouldnt be patched asap? are you dumb? You the reason i hate this community, ignorant dogs
---
It was a 50/50, plus all the survivors probably would of whatever one he turned towards. Either way it's dumb that it's even possible to body block hooks, but whatever.
---
I haven't seen any posts about basements
---
12gbs that will break your game
---
yea heard of a hotfix for something that makes the game unplayable
---
Nah dude it‚Äôs not over saturated or anything dude cmon.
---
Yep. Started at 5 gens, I couldnt move until the survivors all left.
---
Look if you tbag me for 20 minutes and they offer me a toolbox, then that's just politics.
---
Why do I never recall being able to see the Killer's Steam username as a Survivor?
---
Tell that to the 4 man swf I played as my first game as oni with 3 rank 4s
---
Rank 10 btw
---
I got the glitch yesterday, and the clown probably realised that and was kind enough to take me out of the basement and drop me on the ground, such a pure soul üò¢
---
&gt;Yeah bro, U get hit when the weapon is like 2 feet off of u
---
See, you have no clue what you are talking about but feel knowledgeable enough to demand something from the devs... This community in a nutshell.
---
You just described a normal hit when you account for the ping / latency. Which has nothing to do with hitboxes but it might still have something to do with servers, that guess what, are being improved.
---
They already got it i have them for ps4 it should be in your catalog or whatever
---
Can someone fill me in? Whats the glitch/bug?
---
I was playing a match with a friend when it happened to me. 
---
My friend was able to guide me out of the basement (he was spectating my game and was able to give me directions from what he saw in Spectator mode). 
---
So on the glitched player‚Äôs end, you‚Äôre stuck in limbo but to everyone else (including spectators) the game is running normally. 
---
Anyway, according to my friend, I managed to escape the basement and actually cross the exit gates but it was glitched and I reached the camp fire. 
---
Of course the Entity claimed me. :/
---
You had to shift tab view players and you could view the killer. Wasn't meant to be that way I'm assuming but you were directly connected to the killer and their profile.
---
Absolutely not
---
This. No one should have the option to dodge based on who they are playing against. Some Red killers even recognize specific survivors or survivor groups and know their playstyle in advance. I main killer and have literally never dodged a lobby so it mostly doesn't affect me, but if it's a common problem then they need to implement this. There is literally no reason for me to see their names pre-game.
---
Actually there _is_ just one reason and that js to memorize the players names to know which character is your obsession, but honestly they should get rid of that anyways. Just make them glow or something in the pregame lobby OR just get rid of that entirely and start requiring killers to actually find the obsession in game.
---
The issue is that the basement is already incentivized in challenges and just in the game in general. There‚Äôs no way to prove someone isn‚Äôt just using basement hooks as intended. They absolutely shouldn‚Äôt ban anyone. Just fix the bug and move on
---
Dude same. When I 1st load up the game and heard the vroom sound, I force closed it thinking I might've misclick. Then only I realised that I don't have any racing game.
---
You‚Äôre literally the thousandth person to post about this in the past 3 hours, and you‚Äôre screeching at the devs for something that‚Äôs out of their control *after* they‚Äôve said they‚Äôre working on it.
---
As for common, that‚Äôs anecdotal, haven‚Äôt had the issue but for one time.
---
Well, I used to play Siege, so I at least understand what it looks like when your hitbox isn't quite where you think it is.
---
Damn... I didn‚Äôt even notice the teeth. I thought I was being all observant and shit. I‚Äôm just high.
---
Not anymore. They changed kindred to only be usable by the person with the perk who isn't on the hook instead of everyone seeing everyone else.
---
There is a bug rn where sometimes when a survivor gets hooked in the basement they cant interact or move or even see anything. The only way to get out of it is for the killer to pick you up.
---
On the survivor screen, it will look like you are hooked and floating in air. On everyone else's screen, youre literally standing there doing sweet FA. It makes the game literally unplayable if you get hooked in the basement.
---
Oh wow ok. I thought they would be in the store and we would still have to buy. Im dumb sorry
---
yea tard ik its common, thats why i cant understand why theres no hotfix
---
I feel like it negates Lucky Break, Iron Will, and others perks. I can‚Äôt say what I suffixe strategy would be to escape as the blood literally follows you everywhere, but maybe at some point they‚Äôll add a nerf which makes the ‚Äòblood dry up‚Äô after a certain amount of time and disappear? I know how much people hate hearing the word nerf on this sub and generalize it with rank 20 players but I genuinely think it‚Äôs a possibility to look into.
---
I feel like this is an obvious answer, and is the most commonly discussed topic probably regarding DBD, that being, the opposition.
---
I just cut my losses with some gens. Some killers will immediately rush back to the same gen over and over again after every hook and it becomes impossible to fix those if the other survivors can't keep him busy long enough.
---
Yet another example of this game being focused on looping and not stealth like you'd think it would be.
---
Oh god. What did I just do? I legit got on to play the new dlc today and I sacrificed a few people in the basement only to hop on and look at twitter and reddit complain about the basement bug.
---
Well it‚Äôs because when you‚Äôre crouching it spawns them in, and walking limits the spawn rate for them.
---
Thanks! And yeah, I completely understand the camera thing as I mostly main killer. It can be kinda annoying to accurately land hits sometimes.
---
What tf is up with that crotch?
---
Happy 1 year anniversary of no optimization patch
---
Well yes and no, depends who's home. For the most part I keep quiet to avoid bothering anyone, everyone just wants to relax immersed in whatever world they're in when they're home and I can understand that so I'm a killer main lol don't need anyone but I'm trying to get good at survivor and I hit a roadblock quick
---
No
---
Take my upvote good sir, a man who cares about their girlfriends arse hole is a true gentlemen.
---
Ive had it 5 times already, last game I lost because the gates were open i get unhooked and i cant find my way out of the basement
---
It‚Äôs literally been here for a day, it‚Äôs all over this sub too
---
&gt;Bruh, this game is 4 years old. It‚Äôs common, it shouldn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs really annoying if you grind the game, especially when the killer know about it.
---
So just take a break for a few days until its fixed? I am sure you won't die because of it. 
---
If people actually bothered to watch the devs streams, they would understand why stuff break when they ship a build from test environment to live environment but this is obviously an utopia since 90% of reddit users can't even look at the front page of reddit before adding another post to the pile of already oversaturated shit.
---
Then play killer or take a break, don‚Äôt come to reddit to be another one of the screechers.
---
I used them as a comparison because they're both things that delusional people think will result in a ban. Explain how im gonna get banned. Post game reports? Please tell me another joke.
---
Yeah console Oni is really aggravating at first but it‚Äôs all about learning how to play well. Once I got the adept achievement. I started doing much better cause you kinda get in the a ‚Äú I have to win‚Äù head space for that achievement. Playing to have fun is when you learn better. My first game I did terrible and it was a rank 1-2 SWF and they told me to ‚Äúget gud‚Äù yet I had one perk and brown add onsüòÇ
---
Ah yes, guaranteed 2 kills
---
Yeah don't apologise for the black and white this looks like a nice shot from the original, this is great
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Friends tried the double tapping earlier and it didn‚Äôt work. It works sometimes I guess, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee :/
---
Blood warden is a good idea, Ill use that next time thanks
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs just the upside down
---
&gt;Well, I used to play Siege, so I at least understand what it looks like when your hitbox isn't quite where you think it is.
---
As a Siege player you should know better on how ping works and that you can be shot behind cover if you tried to hide in the very last second, like in most shooters.
---
That first one was unlucky, but he should try and look behind him sometimes.
---
I LOVE THIS ART STYLE! KEEP IT UP!
---
No reason to call someone a dog, everyone and their mother knows about the big and the devs are working on it; which means they‚Äôre prioritizing this but over other things such as balancing the new killer, map, survivor, balancing in general, by gas in general, put into consideration the work being put on the devs side before screaming at them and the community on reddit.
---
Wish granted
---
Oh, I see. So it wasn't intended.
---
I'm from the future he's here.
---
 I don't personally see the point, since the issue is already being worked on and a bunch of people wont use the megathread anyway, they'll just ragepost and not care, and the mods will have more work deleting the posts. I say just put up with it until BHVR rolls out a fix so people stop complaining.
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
Things that people complain about, the fact that cosmetics are more expensive than characters. People were having a go at them for that but also the fact that 9k shards which is free is too much. Yet these are the kind of people that will be the latest cod every year, then the season pass, then the bonus dlc, then the extra expansion bonus. It‚Äôs a ¬£14.99 game that you can get all licensed DLC and main game for probably less that ¬£20 if you buy on sales.
---
"suggestion"
---
it‚Äôs a bug with breaking gens right now. Sometimes you just get stuck and have to wait for someone to come to the gen so you can grab them. This patch is so bad, and makes me wonder how BHVR is still in business
---
I know. That's literally what I just said.
---
Cue the 400 differant patches and bug fixes of 'fixed a issue that caused Legion to be trapped in a locker when using his power, this was hard to pin down and we are keeping an eye on it' *Literally breaks every second patch after that for the rest of the games future.
---
Personally i half liked the idea of a reworked Legion including the concept or power element that is for most actions he sends out a another member to do the action instead IE, instead of kicking a generator another member materializes and does it instead, instead of breaking a pallet they send out another member and do it, instead of a lunge attack they charge the attack sending another member forward a few Meteres to do the Lunge attack, this aspect lets the other member fast vault windows and pallets, and maybe it has a bit of autoaim to let them curve a tiny bit. Bassically just playing with the idea that a Legion is not animation locked like other killers, they can still chase you while kicking a gen, they can still chase you while another one of them breaks the pallet. Play with the idea your not dealing with one Legion, but the group even in general chases.
---
Nice art!
---
OP survivor, the killer will give her the hatch every game.
---
It wasn't a 50/50, he gave up at least 2 seconds of time to get to that hook, and it was an open exit gate which they were all crowding around or they would of been bodyblocking from the start instead of at the end, at the exit gate.
---
I have an Xbox one X and the highest I got was 50 FPS on it.
---
Ok, so her new perk does stop the blood bubbles. I was wondering.
---
If they decide to burn a septic agent like that then that's a good play it can't be abused because you can only have four of those in a match. And I'd much rather survivors bring Med kits into my match instead of two boxes so I would welcome that change
---
Is it possible to use Keyboard and Mouse on console? Is that a bannable offense? I remember seeing a thing about how you could use KB&amp;M on console for Siege and people were basically just walking around getting free kills because of how superior KB&amp;M controls are for that game.

It‚Äôs the small details

Yup it‚Äôs a relief, sale with the background of Sanctum of Wrath in lobby. Hope they do this every update

Very interesting, try it inside Custom games with pwyf.
---
Something is wrong with dbd on ps4
---
Reading is hard dude.
---
But I'm sure if they did introduce a perk like that they would change up a few things or tweak some things
---
Hell yes or have killer and survivors friends the you can have random people join so killer can play with frends
---
[It looks like this](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Al3hEO2_lrVAgaQtfDvfPC9ndhWeDQ)
---
It was in the update notes.
---
Nice, I ask for a little visibility and you go straight to exaggerations
---
Sounds about right coming from the people on this sub
---
`no wiggle bug. OH MY GOD it is a thing now...`
---
I'd rather leave that to people who know what they are doing plus I don't have 2-4 people to test it with.
---
I'll go reft
---
This just looks like baby killer loses cause he doesn't know what he's doing.
---
It was fine, they should just make it connected to killer distance instead of terror radius.
---
Lol yeah, I missed that, thanks friend
---
So what your saying is people should be penalized for say leaving when on dead hook or vs noed or an intadown killer? That‚Äôs a yikes from me dawg. This also bring up the possibility of let‚Äôs say I leave and my team is still running around, they all get hooked and die so I get punished? Again that‚Äôs gonna be a yikes. If you can save someone from the hook you should but it shouldn‚Äôt be required.
---
&lt;3 to 3&lt;
---
Barely used besides "hey help met get heal/unhook tome challenge" before tomes it was just a box that one person typed into and no one responded
---
Object of Obsession essentially negates his stealth. You run that and spine chill to know where he is at all times. Coupled with bond or empathy, now you know where everyone is! Reveal the bastard and ruin his stalking, or run gens in peace.
---
Eh you may have a point but idk I feel like it would just be more fun
---
I'd love to play against a killer that has guaranteed 2 kills indeed huh
---
Gates are powered. Every man for himself. 
---
I‚Äôve played solo for to long. I leave, because I know they would do the same. 
---
Unless I‚Äôm running my  ‚ÄúF U ima save errone‚Äù build. Then I don‚Äôt care if I die. I‚Äôll get you out the gate.
---
      I am sorry if this is too close to a bug report, that is not the intent, I simply am trying to see if anybody else has experienced this and/or give people the knowledge to test this to other extents.
---
Basically the same as playing against a red ranks nurse
---
Locker + key = success 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or go with an immerse build with a toolbox and gen-rush the shit out of the killer.
---
I'm just at the point where new cosmetics and stuff won't break the gameplay loop personally on either side
---
Oh shoot, what if your killer was two people and you could switch between them at will. The one that you're not playing as just wanders around the map until you take control. The auto one has a terror radius too, but doesn't do anything more than walk around
---
Apparently it lead to a severe increase in lobby dodging from survivors. Now granted, it was a bug from the recent SWF lobby fix but it still caused enough of a problem to resemble when Killers could see the ranks and such of the survivors.
---
We can't have anything nice in this game because it instantly gets abused.
---
I just try to play fair as a killer, dont tunnel, don't face camp,  make it as fun as possible. As long survivors aren't toxic I may look for a minute or 2 for the hatch for the last guy but I dont have the memory to remember who was a good survivor or not.
---
Befriend the killer
---
I can‚Äôt because crow. Honestly the only way out I see is waiting like 5 days after the reset and survivor
---
On PC instead of skipping, I recommend deleting (or simply moving) the file located in the folders. It also helps booting up DBD faster.
---
Too late, the damage has already been done
---
Hi you must be new around here
---
Yeah, love getting chased away and my teammate who was right there cant even tap the gen to stop it from regressing.
---
Just be careful. If a skill check is going on and you cancel it, it'll be treated as if they failed it.
---
I totally agree!! I hope so too c:
---
DBD memes brighten my day, take my upvote good sir!
---
Nah that game just started and he got lucky on where we started the first gen
---
Deep wound is the same, do you ever play Legion to expect a down with deep wound? No right? As long as they do the mending which they will, its the same. Unless you're talking about the nemesis cheese
---
I played like 4 hours of killer at rank ~6 and not one killer used the basement on us. I mean we all avoided it like the plague but still
---
(*¬¥‚óí`*)
---
I agree.
---
Hes a bit harder than other killers, but hes not an easy killer anyway.
---
I've been telling people this all day, but nobody wants to hear it.
---
This video is so beautiful, I mean the rank 20 people rly enjoy this video game and are not  toxic I miss the old days when I actually enjoyed this game at its full potencial
---
Maybe swap lockers? Thought about that?
---
Nothing is good when it takes a 5min revision especially when all you did was change some colors. The perks are 1. Confusing and 2. Op
---
old Reaper
---
Oh Im not complaining, i dont care about this game, just check in for updates. i thought yall cared tho, so just bringing it to yalls attention that potentially just potentially yall decided to support this game with positivity, yall are as bad as Apex players some days Ive seen
---
The game has been broken since release
---
But... Other people do. That's the point of this post. The point isn't that they DC. The point is that people give Legion players a ton of shit but they play Legion for the same reasons people play any other killer - to have fun.

Okay. But legion still sucks butt.

I did the two killer glitch non-stop before it got patched. Never got banned. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how this basement glitch works but it sounds interesting.
---
Maybe it‚Äôll help me get the goddamn ridiculous Adept Oni trophy üò≠
---
Either way, it‚Äôs stupid to ban something that‚Äôs part of the game. The two killer glitch being bannable is kinda justified. But basement hooks? Not only do I still have to do the challenges for that, but it‚Äôs literally a primary location in the game. 
---
Why do devs gotta break something with every update
---
Killer‚Äôs way more stressful... you can‚Äôt derp around without being punished for it
---
Well now I'm only partially deaf.
---
This is twice I have seen a post about this very thing happened.  It shouldn't be too hard for them to add a way to get down from there besides the stairs I don't know why they can't this is also called holding the game hostage which is against the terms of service
---
Literally rule 7
---
What's ur problem?
---
His weakness is the same that most killers have, his reliance on m1. Of course, he has a power that makes him less of a m1 killer, but he is still a m1 killer for a significant majority of the game and he is pretty bad at it too. This perk combo helps.
---
No. Exposed means that being hit with a basic m1 attack puts you into the dying state immediately, even if you were healthy.
---
Lol can‚Äôt see jokes
---
Hi yeah, youre right.. not active or played seriously at all. i realize what i said is hard to hear for someone.. or they just wont like to hear or deal with it themselves or wont accept change but I was just informing the community how embarrassing some of you guys sound with this game and the things yall bring up.
---
I mean what's the joke
---
Console players watch videos of the people who play this game every day have a seamless experience on PC then complain while playing on there shitbox after a couple games. Honestly what do you expect.
---
This literally isn't a repost. You posted an image of Myers standing over the Oni during a mori. This is a meme of that image. Stop being a clown.
---
Those animations are terrible and so is your reference
---
Clearly then a very long time since you played because there is a hook up there and there is a generator
---
It can, but it doesn't sabotage as quick.

This actually needs more attention, I laughed so hard at the edits

Borrowed time, though it‚Äôs not exactly the perk, it‚Äôs how people play with the perk. Mostly just trying to body block you since they have a free hit and trying to stop you from going after the person that unhooked them, but if you hit them and down them all the sudden your ‚Äútunneling‚Äù. It‚Äôs just annoying.
---
Gonna cry about it?
---
Killers are all about snowballing including end game. If 3 survivors dive a hook then it's potentially a 4k instead of a 1k survivors have the option to choose there plan. Run adrenaline if you don't like getting hooked at end game
---
Idk why people complain about tunneling when they go for a BT block. Like you‚Äôre injured, deep wounded, and closer to me why would I not just get the easy down

---
The image fine lol I didn‚Äôt know the orbs were points
---
I applaud you good sir or madame.
---
I'm saying you can run the build if that's what you want to do. But the killer is still new and just cause you start running these perks doesn't mean the game will become easy peasy cake and not running these perks will make the games unwinnable. All killers can benefit from more m/s but all killers can benefit from other combo of perks and learning how to counter some loops will be way more helpful then a perk combo.
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve played against it it‚Äôs very strange but if you are lucky enough to be able to drop the slug and go for yui it‚Äôs not bad
---
Tanks bruv
---
lol dont get triggered, seeing negative posts on my home pages takes soooooo much effort to point out. lol
---
Yeah but reddit is t for self promotion i/e your youtube/twitch etc
---
I don't understand why people still insist on using it
---
Oh, I was under the impression that adding Undetectable to insidious would hide your aura while you're camping with it. So Kindred still shows the killers aura while insidious camping? That's fine then, nothing wrong with that.
---
That happened to N00b3 in the basement when he got hooked in his stream, he stayed like that for like 5 min lol
---
i'm just amking sure they know, i have faith in the good people but the negative ones plague this game in darkness
---
Ok man child
---
then why tf are you in this sub if you don‚Äôt care. you‚Äôre just wasting time lmao
---
They still made mending quicker tho didn't they
---
it has to be a hawkin level unsafe loop to be that bad, at most unsafe loops where u can catch people they can keep running and loop back potentially.
---
I didnt say literally everyone who likes fnaf I meant the general fanbase is typically children thats it I dont see why this has to be a big argument its fine to disagree with me thinking a lot of the people can be cringy that's it now can we please drop this argument like ive said 5 times its all opinion based it isnt a big deal

There‚Äôs pallet loops in Hawkins?
---
That happens whenever you get hooked in the basement now. Or at least most of the time. You can‚Äôt kill your self, as it auto struggles, and you only get normal again the next time the killer picks you up, so pray to god DS is active at that time.
---
For what it is worth, when I see survivors do this I chase down the unhooker and focus the fuck out of them until they are on a hook.
---
I leave it up to the others if they will rescue them.
---
yeah...thats what reddit is...
---
It's sarcasm but op is Pepega
---
Cool, cool.

I agree and I already started before I saw this post. I'll be back when it's not a super buggy mess. Just a regular buggy mess. Smh

Gang gang
---
dude, i just wanted to share a clip without downloading it.  hence the link. im not trying to promo anything.
---
"y'all are as bad as Apex players"
---
So now we're being compared to shitty free to play Battle Royale games. This is the biggest blow we've taken in a long time...
---
DBD would be the worse game to have split screen knowing the shit survivors do (and face camping Bubbas)
---
This is not fixed. I dont know what kind of weird version of dbd you play but I still lose all my shit everytime some garbage baby killer dcs because he lost the game
---
You mind gamed a baby nancy okay?
---
This happened to me yesterday. Someone pulled me off a hook and I just kept falling...
---
i'm sorry, i didnt mean to hit you below the belt.
---
no need to be rude. i just wanted to share. if you don't like it just move on
---
Damn, I haven‚Äôt experienced this yet since I took a break from the game, I was getting bored of going against the same killers and against the same swf basic builds, and all the toxicity, but I love this game so I decided that I‚Äôll take a break from it to not get bored of it and come back a little after Oni chapter, but u saw the glitch in a stream, it must be frustrating
---
But the demographic isn't children though, it's young teens and young adults (around 13 to early 20s.) What you're doing is like everyone else that paints a dangerous image just because you don't like it, sure there's a lot of Fnaf cringe, but that isn't the whole fandom.
---
I started doing this because the only way to enjoy survivor is playing with friends (not in a toxic way)
---
Me. But apparently only me.
---
She was rank 10 n and I wasn‚Äôt trying to brag bruv just thought it was funny
---
What do you run on her? I can get em all without using her traps
---
I didn‚Äôt see it. I experienced it, and I didn‚Äôt even know what it was at first.
---
An all time classic
---
I already have my basement hook challenge done so I'm not going to be touching basement hooks until they fix it
---
Maybe you should just go on subs you like then man
---
He was being sarcastic, mate
---
Wonderful play
---
*cries in barrowed time*
---
Welcome to dbd
---
I swear to fuckin god you shit developers of a dogshit game best fix this stupid glitch fast! Because ya dogshit community are abusing it you fucks and if you do the glitch and you‚Äôre reading this SUCK YOUR MUM
---
Survivor bad, killer good.
---
Exactly
---
I'm pretty sure almost everyone in the community unanimously agreed that the origin estate map was terrible (except for maybe the blendette's), if they wanted to do a new one at least remove all the bad aspects of the original map
---
i like this sub because the game is cool to watch sometimes, the community isnt... hence the post..
---
And I never said it was the whole fandom I just dont want that part I was mentioning of it coming in here the demographic might be for that age but the people ive seen tend to be younger
---
Sage advice of not getting triggered, by the Reddit user so triggered they needed a post to point out how everyone else is so mean and toxic.
---
It only fixes when the killer picks you up again. It is fun.
---
Youtube for watching. Reddit for community interaction.
---
When you play killer and ~~get a 4K~~ the game ends.
---
**Brace yourself, toxicity is coming**
---
Isn‚Äôt that hard tbh if I did it and I suck why you can‚Äôt ?
---
F ! I know that situation it suhcks
---
Idk why survivors do that instead of just running for the long wall window.
---
The Little Mermaid
---
I still think DS is the best perk in the game, but Adreniline is definitely up there.
---
That‚Äôs a really unique one, I like it
---
fun isn‚Äôt the word i‚Äôd use to describe it
---
Like any example of an x-file
---
\*Sad violin noises\* :( he seems to be the only killer I play against
---
Alright, how about ‚ÄòExhilarating‚Äô?
---
We can old hope for Jason
---
I'd be perfectly fine with having a jacket that looks similar but isn't themed around the lunar new year.
---
I just really like jacket cosmetics.
---
That perk is so good on nurse, but I don't think I can fit it on my mains builds,
---
It looks like an old photo and that's amazing!
---
Isnt trapper basically jason?
---
He disconnect, well yes he did but he didn't disconnect by the way you're thinking. He closed application. When they disconnect normally you still get all the bloodpoints you earned, the items you had, etc.
---
Yea oc, if someone rushes a save without BT they deserve to be punished, and I will punish them
---
He is bringing baby yoda to the entity, to make him a new killer
---
Killer queue times are so bad at brown and yellow ranks, but around green ranks it starts to get better. I‚Äôm rank 11 and it‚Äôs like 5 min instead of the 20min at brown and yellow ranks.
---
I used to have a lot of trouble with Ghostface. I dreaded getting in to a match against him. I stopped caring, stopped over thinking things, and now I feel a lot more comfortable playing against him.
---
Focus on gens with good lines of sight when you're not sure where he is. It may seem counter-intuitive if you're out in the open, but if you can see him, it gives you more time to react. When you know he's on the other side of the map or in chase somewhere, work on the gens with bad visibility.
---
Split up from your teammates, as it'll lessen the chances that he'll be coming after you. Split pressure is good against all killers, but definitely good against stealth killers. When people are grouped up, it means that multiple people are going to be running around worried about the killer and not doing anything.
---
Continue running Spine Chill. Take the notifications more seriously than you would from other non-stealth killers. Since it's difficult to tell which direction he's coming from, walk or crouch away from your gen if you can. If you need to run, know where the closest safe jungle gym is and go there. Since Ghostface can hide his stain, I like to go back and forth between neighbouring obstacles, because the jungle gyms are often blindspots.
---
The other thing you want to work on is breaking him out of his stealth, or Revealing him. I don't have links handy, but there are some good videos on youtube which show you where to put Ghostface on your screen.
---
Hopefully some of this information is helpful. If you have any questions, let me know!
---
not really licensed, but I really really really want a werewolf killer
---
That's not rude, why do you assume sounding like my aunt is bad &gt;:(
---
There definitely needs more interactive options for survivors I only wish behaviour would listen to your idea and/or community ideas.
---
I mean he‚Äôs inspired, but it‚Äôs like hillbilly and leather face there‚Äôs a difference
---
Or NOED, does it also effect other perks?
---
swole can‚Äôt be looking kinda cutw ü§™ü•¥ü•¥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥

even stridor isn't enough to save me

Your more of a criptid kind of guy
---
Any Means Necessary. The new perk that allows you to pick up dropped pallets
---
Ah ok I was wondering, thanks.
---
Yeah good point. I guess because they already have the friday the 13th game we wouldnt get it
---
No, I'm with you brother :)
---
I had this time when I was learning how to play with flashlights, and I started playing really toxic, this was when I played the game a lot, so I could literally 5-gen a red rank killer back then(which I can‚Äôt do anymore cuz I suck now :(  ), and it was on console when there wasn‚Äôt so much variety on lobbies, well, I kept getting the same killers and they kept dodging my lobbies, to the point that I waited 1 hour and 23 min for a match and the guy dc‚Äôd, I turned off my PS4 after that
---
Your choice. Honestly the perk is best on legion imo
---
restart both your games this has been a bug for literally months.
---
But I don‚Äôt think that game is to active and dbd did win the fight so he might just come over in the future, keep your chin up king
---
I think it's best on GF and nurse, why is it good on legion?
---
Borrowed time but mostly because the unhooker is a fucking cunt that only cares about the BP.
---
I seriously hooked the Claudette 2 seconds ago let me walk away Bill.
---
i kept my items when killer DC-d...
---
and later in the day managed to lose my toolbox when i escaped through the gate. pretty good job so far
---
Harry Warden. He would've be so perfect in dbd just seeing a Miner run at you with a pickaxe would be scary plus his p3 would look awesome, sadly though I don't think it'll ever happen

UNITED STATES OF SMASH-O!

I only ever go for the unhooked person if they are toxic. Otherwise I go for the unhooker especially if they are farming.
---
FYI, it was billy with ruin and noed, he camped everyone and facecamped only me for some reason, I even didn't have a chance to use my perks. Go tell my who is toxic here.
---
Either Pyramid Head, Chris Walker or Shrek
---
No mentioned that actually.
---
Didn‚Äôt know who he was, but I like his design
---
"i can't tell if you're a girl or a dude" is not a very nice thing to say
---
Ace ash and Quentin
---
The worst part is that they keep buffing BT
---
Ghost Face is just the little brother to Michael. A little brother who‚Äôs about to get killed if he doesn‚Äôt stop
---
I don‚Äôt know why but in the Midwest for me it‚Äôs fine, killer and surf lobbies take 2 min max
---
My god, it's beautiful.
---
Like I said I don‚Äôt support that behavior, I was just pointing out survivors are very toxic a lot of times, and killers sometimes wanna get back at em.

I think other video game crossover would be cool
---
BT is annoying
---
Literally I main Quentin and clown
---
No scratch marks so it's very easy to juke a legion through windows if they aren't expecting it.
---
It's happening to EVERYONE
---
Yes. And hes not that ass. Even on ps4. Idk about these people complaining about him on console cause im doing just fine.
---
I once was a survivor and I literally did all work on the 3 gens that were on, saved each other survivor at least once, cleared a hex and looped the killer for a while. He finally catches me and then there s only one survivor in the game, a duchebag that tried to block us in the game and do other neat bully stuff. Well, the killer is now giving him the hatch. I got so annoyed I stopped playing that evening.
---
Oh whoops, forgot no-ed. All I know is that anything that procs on a basic attack does not proc on deep wounds. It‚Äôs actually be fun if play with your food didn‚Äôt count, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it does.
---
So if I tongue-punch my girlfriend's fartbox does that make me an ultra gentleman?
---
We have. Fully closed out the game. She restarted her Xbox too.
---
Yeah, I was just asking
---
Someone hit him with the links of the 100+ people posting this.
---
Uhm...... what do you mean? We have options... alot of them. Please explain.
---
It's like console nurse, everyone says she's impossible to play and bottom of the tierlist yet somehow the few console nurse mains still dominate.

They didn't happen in PTB. Though there was a bug where you could get stuck in the pallet on the ptb
---
Lucky for you, I don't know where the basement is    %95 percent of the time
---
Fucking rip due it sucks but are we supposed to let you wiggle out? I have had games where surivors literally hid in the basement so that I couldn‚Äôt hook them it‚Äôs annoying
---
LOL, how the fuck do you imagine that can be done from a programming perspective?
---
For the love of god, no one copied anyone, this is just part of ancient Japanese culture, idk why everyone keeps saying they're copying another artist or game
---
Their expressions are killing me!
---
It's almost like that UI has always been there for survive with friends / kill your friends and was never intended to be used with randos. :)
---
Basically it gives you an insane lunge once you exit the phase.
---
The little mermaid
---
what?
---
It's the word survivor mains used to describe Wake Up when it was bugged and very exploitable.
---
Ewwww, you play Fallout 76.
---
I'm a killer main, so my survivor perks are very lackluster, I always run spine chill if I can it keeps me very safe, I don't search for ruins already, it's just annoying to go against, I don't even use it as killer it's just not fun. Most killers at my rank camp, so with the kindred buff I'll use it if I can get it
---
This is what happens now when the killer closes app, it just takes you to main menu w no score screen.
---
You‚Äôre funny kid
---
Thanks mate. I'll remember this and answer this coment again when I get wraith to lvl 50.
---
That doesnt happen. They just completely removed it.
---
It's almost as if 100% isn't enough.
---
You can always just ask
---
Still too real :(
---
Survivors bad.
---
I meant the original statement was sarcasm.
---
Whelp there go my favorite add ons.
---
They started with a dev team of 20-30 people, they now have 200+ and get half as much done in twice the time.
---
Survivors bad (again).
---
xbox too
---
Wow watching those actually made me realize how fucked hit boxes were in favor of survivors. So many of those should have connected. Now they are just all around fucked.
---
Dlc brings money fixing bugs does not sure it bring back old players but it doesn‚Äôt draw in new players plus one bug that will probably be fixed this WEEK is not the end of the world calm down.
---
It hides the fast vault that triggers IAE
---
its -intro not -skip_intro unless thats dbd specific
---
Yeah, low ranks suck. This is the biggest reason to swf
---
Joke has been made before.
---
Looks like a stiletto heel to me.
---
Only running kindred from now on tbh
---
And you‚Äôre not Mr. Slit Your Wrists. It‚Äôs a nice video of a dad and his daughter being cute. Cheer up.
---
I don't see how Mouse and keyboard would negatively affect this game besides making Nurse, Huntress, and Plague more viable.
---
A lot of people agree that survivor is easier to control with a controllwr anyway.
---
Pennywise, chucky, Marcus from underworld (or Dracula, think a vampire could be really cool), the creeper, tooth fairy from darkness falls, the leprechaun, samara(not sure how her power would work I just think she's creepy). I could probably think of more, but I don't feel like it. Lol
---
Where is that guy that has all the links to posts that people have shown showing the exact same thing?
---
For now, no. It's a new bug that came with the update.
---
God same, my first game after Oni dropped, had this happen to me when hooked in the basement, had no idea wtf was going on.
---
I‚Äôve seen this suggested every Christmas, probably won‚Äôt happen due to liscencing and lack of a substantially unique power now that demogorgon is here.
---
Yeah sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even let me wiggle. It‚Äôs kinda getting annoying because I can‚Äôt play the game.
---
 The last thing you see before your choccy milk gets swiped
---
#"just to suffer?"
---
That ending LOL
---
Survivor mains are Jersey Shore.
---
Known issue, devs are working on it
---
Power seems weak but good concept
---
Combo of billy and Myers
---
Lame
---
Love your style, please don't stop making these
---
Not really tbh. 
---
I've noticed a lot of people like running it on pig as well.
---
bhvr with the \*\*\*\*block
---
Whats going on in this video
---
OH I‚Äôm soooo sorry that I try to use game mechanics to my advantage!
---
Strictly speaking.... this is *still* a basement post. If you want something pinned, request it from the mods.
---
Don‚Äôt pick them up just slug them and then he‚Äôs good
---
Thanks. Any advice with wraith?
---
Yes I know I aciddently hit after I got off the hook .
---
Clown be like: OH Nooo he‚Äôs hot!!
---
camping gets super annoying. I try to make it sting less by thinking that I‚Äôll rank up while this killer will be stuck at these ranks as long as they keep trying this. (It may not always be true since you see facecamping up into the red ranks sometimes, but you *do* see it less once you‚Äôre into purple.) Out of courtesy to my teammates I try to stay on hook as long as possible to buy them time to punish with gen-rush. Not much else for it, unfortunately.
---
Takes too long to vault and sometimes inconsistent along with hitboxes.
---
You don't even have to mend now you can just sprint around, and as you know just sprinting in any direction is a hard counter to legion. When they do decide to mend it only takes 2/3 of the time it used to and they removed the only 2 perks that made him almost playable? Yeah legion is dead alright, he was bad before but this is literally worse.
---
I‚Äôll never understand why people stand still to reveal him. Just keep running and he won‚Äôt be able to mark you as fast and you‚Äôll make good distance
---
No he's Japanese shrek
---
If ghost face is constantly stalking people hes gunna lose thats not what makes him strong
---
Claud clown vs the clown would be an amazing battle, also teabagging clown in the bush ü§°
---
Yeah I do the same but then the other three are all crouched around the hook waiting to free me lol they don't understand yet
---
My logic is to stand there and have a badass stare off so that he doesn't expose me instead of run away and get exposed.
---
But hes so buggy that the latter is better anyways.
---
Another quick "Fix" that my friends and I have tested, start an unhook, stop it - then actually unhook and it should fix the issue. Still super fucking annoying though if the killer is near basement you might not have time for that.
---
And new Killers are always cocky like this. No reason what-so-ever but still behaving like their match the first ever legit victory.
---
He kinda hard to learn, it's not only the dush or the flick it's also what blood u should leave on the ground, knowing if the loop is short enough to use ur lungh and when to use ur dush if it's an infinite or long loop.
---
The best way I found to play him is trying to kill some one (no tunnel) in 2/3 gens and hitting everyone with the normal attack if u can (u should use sloppy on him) and pushing them to one side on the map with most gens. Then u can 4/5 gen and cuz all the blood they left u u can use ur ability almost all the time.
---
Basecly just pick one side of the map and try to keep every gen on it for later without using the blood orbs on that side.
---
How do you get the aura reading?
---
No.
---
I mean if you can find a good loop, being exposed won‚Äôt matter at all. He‚Äôs really easy to loop most the time
---
Upvoted. This update is a fucking mess
---
My games with a flashlight in a nutshell
---
The whole point of loops is that they are pretty uncounterable, barring some unsafe ones. (Hawkins in general is easy peasy)
---
Yeah thats if you find a good loop, but BHVR want to make unsafe loops more of a thing.
---
Legion is retarded
---
It gives 90 seconds. Clocks spawn randomly though, usually out of the way. Waking up without someone else there comes at the cost of generator/healing progress and revealing your location. Every time your teammate wakes you up, the time it takes to do it again doubles, so that just adds even more slowdown. ‚ÄúJust stay awake‚Äù isn‚Äôt a very good counter. If it was that easy, he wouldn‚Äôt be the deadliest killer right now
---
Walk around the bottom of the building, its on the side of it
---
Pretty much hes got a bit better steering than drifting billy and doesnt bumper when he collides with walls but i dont think his down side is worth it
---
Maybe he has a crush on her :(
---
My top 3 would have to be
---
-Edward Richthofen 
---
- A bioshock chapter with a nig daddy killer and Elizabeth for a survivor
---
-Jack Torrance (the shining guy but i forget his name so i think that's it)
---
Also, stop using the "Nobody" meme for the lice of God.
---
Black and White makes it better
---
I said this and got ridiculed. Apparently he has no similarities to Myers even though they both have to earn their instadown.
---
Fuckin thank you
---
I love the oni though. Even on console I'm having a good time. Then again, im okay if people escape as long as we all have a good game.
---
When will you fix hitboxes though? And infinite looping?
---
The map is just stupid dark so it makes finding people extra hard so yeah it sucks
---
I have. Im just saying it seems pretty fucking stupid to be complaining about this now. "New killer snd no1 knows how to play? We demand better flicks!" Like this seems so stupid to me its unreal. I play oni just fine so idk why all this sudden "WE NEED BETTER SENSITIVITY!"
---
Small Game ftw :)
---
Not you the other guy that got downvoted for being sarcastic

Nerf!

I‚Äôve never heard anybody say that, but I‚Äôve definitely heard the opposite.
---
You‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion as I am mine, I‚Äôm a console player and I personally don‚Äôt want to deal with PC players and the same is said among multiple other console players.
---
Look who has been shitting in the tall grass
---
Self care takes up a lot of time tbh, i prefer inner because after its activated you can use it at anytime, so after taking a hit and the surv escaping you can just lose the killer and find a locker
---
It's funny, you run into the same killers and survivors enough that you dont even have to look at the name to know who it is sometimes, you can tell who they are off how they play combined with their cosmetics most of the time. There's this one survivor I run into a decent chunk of the time who always runs David and if you find him first, he always DCs, every time, without fail. If I know he's in my game I try to find him first and just let everybody else farm because I find it hilarious
---
I'm also a console player. I like the new content aswell such as the oni and yui but just the map I don't like
---
Partner with Netflix and tge show slasher, make a new season plus add the killer in the game.
---
Nah, the character idea is yours mate.
---
Bhvr: Some killers need reworks? Instructions unclear, buffing Billy, nerfing legion and pig
---
Still, wouldn't mean that they can't take previous steps or examples.
---
Do believe if I say this but playing two of these games basically feels the same gag. Even OVERKILL's The Walking Dead.
---
That would be nice. Pretty much what I‚Äôm going for. Adding new content will only add more bugs and annoying functionality/balance problems, and this would help that since their resources would be dedicated toward that
---
I dont actively look for totes, i get them between gens, and i dont just chase killer w breakout but if the surv gets down near me then its possible to save w/o flashlight. Best case scenario the killer doesnt even hit you because of haste and the surv wiggles out.
---
The fact that he had to worry about decisive shows hes tunneling his own daughter.
---
As a killer I make it my priority to target players being idiots meaning if you unhook a survivor right in front of me you'd better start running because my sights are locked on you.
---
Ds and dead hard. Ima bitch about dead hard real quick. It does so much. It extends every chase because they can ise it to be greedy with pallets and loop one additional time. It gets them to pallets or windows they wouldnt otherwise make. And gives them a get out of jail free card if they fuck up or lose a mind game at the press of a button. But its okay you only have to deal with it once very chase on every single survivor and if they use it to get to a strong position where you have to give up chase theyll get it back in 40 seconds. Ok now its ds turn. While very helpful for solo survivor in a swf its just down right ridiculous. You see 1 obsession and you have to play like all 4 have it. If at any time you come back to the hook and you follow the scratch marks and its the injured person you just have to slug them and let someone else pick them up because its not feasible to wait 60 sec while the other 3 are on gens. So because 1 person brings ds theres a potential impact of 8 times during the game if you each person gets unhooked twice totaling 8 min of god mode for survivors where you just cant pick them up. I see people say to just eat the ds but thats so much momentum gone. You had to chase the person, hook them, find them again, chase them, pick them up, get stunned for 5 sec, chase them again, transport them to the hook. All that time wasted while the other 3 are on gens just for 2 hooks and then it could happen to you 3 more times in the match. Nah if you eat 1 ds you can just lose the game. If you respect the potential ds 8 times you can lose the game. Sorry for the rant those perks just suck and are bullshit which is why i run them when i play survivor.
---
Bhvr acknowledged it‚Äôs existence many hours ago though
---
Hopefully dog isn‚Äôt like my old cat and tries to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù it
---
It's his power and it is strong. Just because tru3talent plays him a certain way doesn't mean it's not effective at other ranks than red.
---
I think he is right. Im in.
---
"Yo Amanda! Pick up the phone!"
---
"Hello."
---
"WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
I didn‚Äôt know the concept of m1 but I was on the receiving end of it and very confused.
---
lol don‚Äòt you have anything else to do that you can‚Äòt stay away from the game for one day?
---
They changed rank reset now so purple ranks will drop to highest level in green and same for other ranks
---
You're doing it wrong. Solo survivor is just like playing killer, it's 4v1.
---
Thanks for the info! I don't really buy the new stuff, so hadn't paid attention to the changes.
---
You know im trying to say "ashhole" and not "ashhole" right? fork me.
---
Resilience... This is not happening... windows of opportunity...
---
At least these are only good for new players but not for experienced players. Might as well see small buffs and changes to them.
---
Play With Your Food, Myers perk. Lose chases with Obsession to gain up to 3 tokens, 5% speed per token, expend token each attack. 
---
AFAIK is As Far As I Know.
---
It was a tough climb to get here playing 2 killers who aren't particularly strong against red rank SWFs every game. Win or loss, of course there was a bunch of toxic messages along the way. Just thought it would be nice to share something that isn't the basement bug or salty messages from killers or survivors.
---
Thank you very much man, is good to see im not the only one
---
Annoying but it's not bannable.
---
This game needs a health update not content that adds new bugs and useless perks. You just say the word.
---
Devs: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite idea?! Mine is nerfing The Legion!‚Äù
---
I demand MORE
---
T walls and l walls are counter able mind games are counter able running nemesis alone will help
---
Oh trust me, if I could trip other survivors in order to get away I would.
---
It's not really a nerf, and the vault speeds are a lot more comfortable now
---
Ruin makes every gen 80 seconds unless they stack on it. Pop takes of 20 each hook.
---
This is litterally me all the time!
---
Do you have the link to the og commercial? Also please tell me it's satire
---
What about cleansing? Do people cleanse ruins often or?
---
I went against a killer earlier who admitted in chat to doing this because they wanted their challenge done. All the survivors were left floating in the void that game. Now, I just put in the lobby chat to leave me if I get basement hooked since it's not worth it.
---
Yup still not working for me either. No way around it it seems.
---
Run MoM or bring a purple insta heal
---
That and the unpredictability ! Smack cloak smack cloak smack cloak
---
I think it is because is sad have a killer witch no one plays with, it's like have a perk witch no one uses (no mither).
---
Except that completely negates killer powers AND perks. Killers chainsaws, Myers 3rd tier, ghostface stalk, NOED, haunted ground, exposed. 
---
Hell no. As a survivor main, these are things I ha e to deal with, I shouldn't have a perk that cancels out all of these because I was already one hit downed in the early part of the match. I get that you're frustrated, but suggesting a completely overpowered perk is NOT the answer.
---
Please look at her kill rate
---
I had 14 games with him 10 of them I got 2 pips and max bp
---
I‚Äôm rank 4 survivor and I‚Äôm getting rank 14 killers like wth bhvr, 6 rank radius my ass
---
Idk dude his mori is SO long I think you might lose a gen in that amount of time
---
I was gonna buy it thinking the shipping would be reasonable since I'm next to Montreal, but holy crap. 55 dollars for a pillow, plus tax, plus 17 dollars shipping.
---
At least you get matches I gotta wait 20 damn minutes for a single game as killer
---
I don't care if ever survivor is red ranked as long as I can actually play the damn game
---
I like your ghostface placement.
---
They should make it if the killer is in a certain proximity around a hooked survivor for an extended amount of time, they‚Äôre forced to leave, and can‚Äôt return until a survivor is in close proximity.
---
for people wondering
---
Medkit charge add-ons are not working
---
You have a 10% chance you won‚Äôt be able to wiggle once picked up
---
Sometimes your wiggle speed drops to 0 after the killer hits someone despite them not having Mad Grit equiped
---
The basement void thing
---
Flashlight saves not working sometimes (killer regains control, looks up, gets blinded anyway, no save)
---
All players in pre-lobby group char have the same nickname color
---
Doctor has power and add-on descriptions for his rework that wasn‚Äôt even announced yet
---
Oni can hit through some walls
---
Nemesis + Whatever Chase (don‚Äôt remember the first part of the name, GF perk) combination doesn‚Äôt work as intended
---
Some add-ons have wrong descriptions
---
Some players have lost their old event cosmetics
---
Should I go on?
---
A lot of dedicated fans asked for this and even myself. It's still a shame devs want only money from content and not fixing the game's health and maybe even mental health as well. I did state this before and I'll say this again. There's a small but also medium chance of players losing interest to the game due to how repetitive it can be. And adding Killers or Survivors as Barbie dolls into your collection doesn't make difference but huge grind. This is really disappointing...
---
ok, this was obi made by someone who just doesnt know what they are talking about.
---
Legion is worse then clown, doc, and bubba, and clown is better then doc and bubba.
---
Nurse... C tier... is that a fucking joke?
---
Demo bellow myers. 
---
TRAPPER HIGHER THEN HAG, HAG IS FUCKING AMAZING
---
Wraith is bottom C tier max.
---
Plague is higher tier then C.
---
Spirit is much better then billy.
---
Even in red ranks after her rework she gets less kills than bubba and legion.
---
Shouldn't the top text be the other way around?
---
Ight Cool
---
Congrats! Now the real game begins man, i wish you luck in your climb to rank 1.
---
Chewed pen, thana, and sloppy are all you need for a good time üòÄ
---
I fucking love your style
---
I agree I was just thinking he almost kabobed himself
---
Oni op
---
Yea, but she would be able to make it out if she had a pallet, or maybe somebody could actually do a pallet save, then not 2 people in the basment
---
Let's not, since tier lists are banned on here.
---
Is this the new leaked prop hunt game mode?!
---
Old legion isn't fun for the survivors, new legion isn't fun for the killer.  They need a Freddy style rework more than any other killer.  The bandage nerfs/"buffs" they're getting don't really change anything
---
Wazzdown
---
Plague to A tier
---
Myers + Demo to C tier
---
Pig to B tier
---
Bubba to C tier
---
The tiers were not in order besides alphabetical. Oh I know nothing ? Ah I guess me and my red ranked means nothing. I can tell you why I have everyone where I have them.
---
Sad part is that despite this "exploit" being bannable by definition, BHVR won't ban the badseeds just like how noone got banned for abusing Wake up bug.
---
I‚Äôm a hag main myself üòä
---
Has anyone else also gotten the bug where you get picked up and cannot wiggle? It's happened to me a few times but I haven't seen any consistancy to it. Happened to me earlier where I got the bug where I couldn't wiggle and the killer walked me halfway across the map, hooked me in the basement, and then I got the basement glitch.
---
Yep.
---
First hook only bud
---
Plague isn‚Äôt A tier. B at best. Pig is C tier worthy, why on earth would you ever use her when ghostface and wraith are out ? Don‚Äôt get me started on bubba üòê 0 map pressure
---
There's a bug?
---
There is a gen and a hook lol
---
exactly, you should put the correct title and then add "(sorry if someone has posted it already)" or something :]
---
‚ÄúDeath is not a escape‚Äù
---
Oh yeah dead by daylight EXPLAIN THIS THEN EH
---
Well it's an exploit yes. But the dungeon is a part of the map that is not meaningless for some killers so you could argue some builds even want to hook people in the basement whether or not the bug existed. You can't really forbid killers to use a certain part of the map
---
So now basement hooks are toxic?
---
I find the possibilities fascinating but to each their own. Though I do hope this reaches Mr. Otz.
---
*Laughs in Mad Grit*
---
Are you using bvhr‚Äôs stats
---
Legion isn‚Äôt even that broken anymore. Why do people still dc?
---
Basements good, bugged basements bad.
---
If they haven't said that bug is bannable then it's not bannable. 
---
To answer your primary question to report someone outside the game there are only 2 ways on PS4. One way is to take images or screenshots of the exploit and messages and go to the Dead by Daylight website, open a ticket, and report it. 
---
Second is if they used language against the PS4 terms of service you can report the messages to PSN. But that's it.
---
They didn't acknowledge the audio issues, killer being stuck after damaging the generator, medkit charges not working etc.
---
Let's just hope they won't end up fixing wiggle/basement and ignore the rest lmao
---
I really Wanne see Robert england Freddy. That's the one licensed thing i want. The good Freddy actor. PLEASE A COSMETIC WILL BE ENOUGH!
---
So it's not just me. Interesting. 
---
I can pay as Killer though
---
honestly pls nerf
---
Thanks dude!
---
Oni in A.
---
+oneshot power with increased range &amp; radius (with high sensetivity) 
---
+good mobility
---
+fast charge (3 hits or 2 hits and some Blood orbs)
---
+4.6 movement for such ability
---
-his steps louder than Terror radius, 0 stealth
---
it‚Äôs been happening for a while now. devs haven‚Äôt fixed it yet
---
That has happened to me once lol so annoying after a while
---
ok go ahead, why is nurse C tier.
---
I don‚Äôt just base it off of that. But you make a good point. This is a discussion I‚Äôm not a toe
---
I‚Äôm capable of taking criticism and  adjusting my list based off of other peoples suggestions too. I wanted a discussion so please calm down we‚Äôre all allowed our own opinions
---
Uh git gud=no die. Lol nah all you can do is try get to purple rank maybe even red. Easiest way to do that is do 2-3 gens if possible and get some unhooks and then u should be all g .
---
i find solo q a helluva lot harder because even red ranks will leave u to die on ur first hook and some realy boosted idiots get in to red somehow but killers arent as campy but they are much better so u mostly end up dying anyway lol. 
---
But solo q dose make u better in the long run because u pretty much gotta 1v1 the killer unless u get some good teammates by chance.
---
How does that ruin Oni? You are only one hit now. Its not wrong to counter his Wrath when your losing being healthy in return. Its a risky trade off but its worth something.
---
Didnt stand a chance
---
Happend to my friend today when we matched up and also huntresses axe hit me throu wall and  billy chainsawing me throu a wall and oni slicing me throu a wall like i had a ride today and i called it a day with the game soo many bugs have poped up and  not to mention basment bug and wiggle bug
---
Noo ok the mending ‚Äúfix plus on hit affect perks that were good on him now are useless. That took part of his kit away, see Yerv‚Äôs video for detail, I don‚Äôt have the link to it. However this means that maybe, just maybe they can buff him in the future without fear of him using cheesy things to play
---
Yeha but at what cost? Feral Frenzy is useless
---
Well, you can see how waiting helped us, helped legion, helped the basement bug, helped med kit bugs, helped the balanced challenges on the archives, theres a comment on the bottom of this post that list all of the most frequent issues
---
Read the god damn patch notes people
---
These bugs are absolutely destroying the entire game for survivors. It has never been less fun to play.
---
lol I am killer main and your clearly a waste yute make all killer's look bad purposely using a broken exploit to win the game then calling survivors entitled show's you've probably bin a gray-yellow rank trash killer forever.
---
Stacking add ons of the same effect can really vary your playstyle. Dont chase cloaked unless you have bamboozle or a windstorm add on in order to block survivor movement. A fun combo is Play With Your Food and Nemesis that builds stacks fast and you go zoom. Survivors can burn you with flashlights but if you get super close you should have time to decloak.
---
They're the funniest killers to play as, but you gotta sweat your ass off to get something out of them
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6ddol/psa_with_basement_hook_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That's a valid argument but at the same time if you're going to present kill rate as your ONLY argument, which is what you've done so far, you cant ignore all of the stats. According to the stats old Nurse in red ranks had a 72% kill rate and according to the stats Bubba has a 70/71% kill rate. So if her lower kill rate is why she's bad now why was she considered good before when she barely managed to outperform Bubba in kills.
---
Also I'm not entirely sure I agree with putting Huntress below Trapper. Sure the Huntress gets hurt on larger maps and can struggle on certain map structures but a good Huntress can still dominate and I dont think its right to ignore that.
---
I bet. I wanted to see what happened next lol
---
You also forgot them reworking Deep Wound.
---
**Again**
---
At this point, scrap the whole status. It‚Äôs worth less than Broken or even Mangled.
---
They created this update, had it tested and had two weeks to work on it before they had to release it. Chill out, bugs exist. What were they going to do? Delay it. No fucking way. I would be terrified of this community if I was a BHVR dev. This proves why they should be afraid. They can't move without being harassed. Have you seen Mathieu, McLean or Peanits streams? It's a mad house up in there. I could only imagine other platforms. They're not robots. They make mistakes.
---
idk... i hope killer dc punishments are a thing like survivor dc punisents cuz killers dcing is funny, but they deserve to be punished for forcing players to reQ
---
It NEVER proc‚Äôd NOED.
---
I actually think one idea that would help with farming like this would be to institute some kind of larger bounty for people who unhook a survivor in your terror radius. Say 1000 blood points or so if you smack them within 5 seconds of the unhook.
---
That small window would give the unhooked a little breathing room, and also serve the additional purpose of further discouraging tunneling.
---
too real tbh
---
Making memes and saving fellow DbDers money, it has been a productive day!
---
I hover around rank 2-4 and after they removed ur rank in pre lobbies I have no incentive to keep a red rank so I stopped running meta perks besides DS and just run fun perks and play a role as someone who runs the killer and take hits when someone's in a chase, way more fun than tryharding gens and most times I still manage to pip just off evader and altruism, basically stop trying so hard and you'll have more fun
---
Bruh dbd and Friday have been rivals since the beginning of time how do you not know that your gonna get hate for posting that
---
Gorgeous!!
---
Oh, but it‚Äôs so much better if you aren‚Äôt wearing them.
---
Their only weapon is an invisible knife with the perk decisive strike, line of sight and taking tighter turns than the killer due to their hitbox size and an exhaustion perk that gives you invincibility frames.
---
remember when the main character of that show became Hitler at the end
---
I can take cosmetics, but real life stuff is were I draw the line. I don't think anyone who isn't a fanatic weeb would buy this.
---
Balanced landing, I have no idea why it irks me the way it does but my lord. 
---
I won‚Äôt tunnel or hunt down anyone that has it, but it just has a way to get under my skin.
---
it's new and this post is kinda dead
---
Really disagree. 
---
Nurse should be top. Ghostface I'm not getting at all. Trapper should be bottom. Freddy is not top tier hes strong but if survivors play safe he cant do much like clown. That's just the really out of place ones
---
Quentin Mains? What does it mean?
---
The list is pretty good, but Ghostface is only A Tier with power recovery add ons and that TrU3Ta1ent build.
---
They‚Äôre absolutely a nerf, and now Deep Wound is even less threatening.
---
I was trying this but with self care instead of inner strength lol never got around to the protection hit part
---
Survivors can't use weapons they can only stun the killer. Also yes you should get this game if you enjoyed Friday the 13th although this game is pretty repetitive but the new content and stuff makes it well not boring.(also this game has some toxicity so yeah)
---
Huntress and Hag are both better than trapper easily
---
Protecc
---
If he‚Äôs chasing you for 20 seconds for the instant down he‚Äôs wasting time and other survivors can just work on gens. 
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt a chasing killer. He wants to catch survivors off guard. Either by injuring them and catching them later when they try to heal or lean stalking an unaware survivor for the quick down.
---
Thanks eventually it'll come no need to go all out then. :)
---
While their at it they should give legion a power lmao
---
Nah
---
Yeah I googled it and it turns out it's only for Xbox elite controllers which sucks. /:
---
been running break out/MOM/DS/bond and playing the role as running killer and taking hits and hovering around with breakout if they're not close to a hook, still manage to pip and bring a medkit (rank 3), not the best way to play but I've been bored with dbd so it's been fun plus if u get a good chase going the other survs can get a lot done
---
Wow, I actually wasn‚Äôt even aware the Basement was bugged, and I actually hooked a couple of people in the basement today.
---
God, that sucks. Now I feel bad.:/
---
I wouldn't buy either, but I felt an unbearable pressure to do this meme when I saw the image on Google. Maybe the entity likes memes?
---
I didn't read the whole post because I thought I knew the answer. It's a simple mistake. You're a fucking dick aren't you?
---
I get flashbacks when i tride to grab somwon slow walting or in or out of a locker while in frenzy. I big dumb dumb i got lil big brain now
---
Let's make more survivor crutch perks that fully negate some killers!
---
The Nurse is down there is well I kinda quit for 3 months(or after the demogorgon came out) and I play on console so yeah never really encountered nurses
---
There's a reason you've been on here 2 years and have nearly negative karma. Huge ass hole.
---
I dunno why they'd camp the whole point is survivors are bugged and cant see after being hooked
---
I don't agree with the list either but chill
---
Oversaturated content homie
---
Don't be surprised when this gets taken down
---
almost hit a quad feed bro
---
Patrick, go be edgy somewhere else
---
Deep wounds was never threatening, besides, his new speed actually feels really nice.
---
K. Enjoy playing other games
---
Now that you put it like that plague seems pretty good. 
---
Yes they are susceptible to loops that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt really bother ! Just cloak or go into stealth and keep getting surprise hits with thana sloppy and nurses. It works so amazing because survivors are used to looping bad killers. But once you start getting unpredictable they choke and make mistakes more frequently
---
That would be ridiculously OP, don't he so naive.
---
No I tried doing it you can‚Äôt. You can do it before or after picking up but not while it‚Äôs blocked
---
Eh I barely see actual serious tier list more memey ones also it's trying create a discussion so yea
---
Apparently you are. And a judgmental one, because you are exactly the kind of asshole people complain about all the time who don't READ the whole thing before commenting.
---
Yamoka is so annoying to see things on noe
---
Don‚Äôt turn your back, don‚Äôt look away, and DON‚ÄôT BLINK!
---
...what
---
The entity‚Äôs insistence on offering me milquetoast/bad killer addons has lead me to imagine it having an obnoxious, Ned Flanders-like voice.
---
‚ÄúAre you SURE you don‚Äôt want Distressing?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNO. BBQ, save the best for last, god. I‚Äôll even take Whispers.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúHow bout Spies in the Shadows?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNO!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, okely dokely, well I‚Äôll just check back with ya next level, in case you change your mind.‚Äù
---
The Legion tier hurts üíÄ
---
I won't be surprised at all but I mean they haven't taken down the multiple posts about the basement glitch so why should this
---
Fr but when I put the Patrick meme up they take it down real quick. I'm salty
---
yes!!! Love!! Thank!!
---
Clown is shit tier.
---
She just does that and I‚Äôm ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Indeed poor legion basically got nerfed to Oblivion and is worse then bubba which is a sad fate
---
Everyone got all the exclusive items as of the last patch
---
BHVR gave out a bunch of cosmetics to people that were previously given away as exclusives. The reasons for this were that people were getting scammed online paying for them, and because console players did not have access to them.
---
Eh i disagree he is very good at stopping alot of loops but besides that he is well yea shit,. probably should've place him in low tier now that I think about it
---
depends on ur rank, personally green rank killers always play like shit and facecamp or take noed and no ruin cause they know they can't apply pressure and get gen rushed, red rank killers don't facecamp but they tunnel all the time and why every survivor takes DS, if u never get saved then try deliverance or sumn
---
Gotta ask, why do people put the "No One: " or "Nobody: " thing in memes where it doesn't make sense/doesn't add to anything?
---
Man they could of discussed how fly my Patrick looked.

True but that got spammed to Oblivion no offense
---
Read. The. God. Damn. Patch Notes
---
i mean that's rare it does take some skill to reach red ranks, at least on xbox
---
Hes kinda annoying to play even though he can be fun. When you have his power you feel weaker than without it on some tiles.
---
Hes also particularly bad on the new map which you get 50% of the time right now
---
No it doesn't platform doesn't matter for survivor
---
I happened to me today about 3 times.
---
I know I'm just salty
---
Next patch legion is gonna be able to give the survivor their knife so they can be killer.
---
I couldn't solo queue. Just killer
---
No some add-ons got text changes on accident so technically the rework got leaked
---
Yeah but who will the rank 20s play with when there's a small population of those ranks. They're gonna play with the next closest rank. Baby rank 10s.
---
There gonna be legit pointless after the changes. Everyone will be within ranks 1 to 10.
---
I would like to continue in this plane of existence, so let's assume that it's a meh for it.
---
I agree with this change
---
i think they really really wanted that moon to be seen üòÇ
---
My ass out of the map thinking the endlessness of the air is just a part of the map
---
Yea don‚Äôt be thrusting a kitchen knife that can slice through a tough pumpkin like butter when you‚Äôre wearing a mask that you can barely see from. You‚Äôre asking to lop your hand off it‚Äôs incredibly stupid.

Yo farm sim 2019 is out btw

I would know, I play it

I'm triggered at this 4 year old image

Nurse is a really high tier (when played well) and spirit is so op that she has her own spirit tier to herself x)
---
Bebe huntress
---
DS be forcing people to do dumb shit. Needs a nerf.
---
yep. played against 3 basement trappers, a basement demo, and a plague that made a point to bring everyone to the basement today. they knew exactly what they were doing. 
---
went over to killer just so people don't have to deal with these assholes. i don't blame people for DCing at all until these are fixed.
---
Your question was meaningless. No I wouldnt mind if they shut the servers down for a week to fix bugs but 1 that will never happen and 2 what makes you think that shutting the servers down for a week will magically fix these bugs. Makes legit no sense. Maybe a month or 2 but a week...really? 
---
Also you private message me shit talking because I guess you gotta hide it from the public post were talking in right? Gotta keep that reddit reputation positive. Not only that you immediately search my history and bring up one random instance where I made a rant post and use that as "ammo" against me. Lmao whatever dude. Have a good night my guy.
---
New achievement in a nutshell.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize there was a bug until I got several vErY nIcE aNd pOlIte MeSsAgEs FrOm SuRvIvOrs telling new that I‚Äôm going to be banned for hooking in basement.
---
i did this the first time i even tried to play the game. my boyfriend was shocked bc he never can do it.
---
I love them both for completely different reasons.
---
thing is 95% or more of the games player base doesn't come here or go to the official forums, there is no way most people will ever know of this till they get called on it in post game. I wouldn't have known if i wasn't bored on way home and browsing.
---
The Nun and the Crooked man, both from conjuring 2.
---
I use the basement if I get the chance. Not because of the bug, but because it's a one way in
---
oh is this why a three people dced because i hooked them in the basement
---
I find it funny that people still refer Legion as "they" since promo was about a gang..., but you play single M1 killer nerfed into the ground...
---
Yesssss
---
I literally keep forgetting, i down someone right near the basement and instinct kicks in! I always apologise afterwards!
---
God damnit, why are tier lists getting more popular again? They were banned for a reason
---
...now thier are two of them.
---
This is my take on where these killers stand on console as someone who is both a red rank killer and survivor. Let's discuss!
---
Wraith In B tier and nurse in C tier. Excuse me?
---
Is this satire? I'm just so confused at this point I dont even know anymore
---
Oni could crush Myers‚Äô head by resting his head on his arm and flexing his bicep
---
Me too. Friday Th 13th is my all-time favourite slasher franchise so I'm absolutely thrilled for Jason to have his own game but I like dbd gameplay more. And since dbd has Michael who's my second favourite it's almost as good. You can probably guess who's my main ;)
---
Fine! We‚Äôll go form our own club called...the..the..legion
---
I think Netflix is a lot more willing than those who own the rights to the classic horror characters. For some reason they all seem very stubborn.
---
QUICK COMMENT FOR CONFUSION OF NURSE. THIS IS CONSOLE BASED.
---
P2P what's new
---
First perks on yui and oni we‚Äôre open handed and monsterus shrine
---
I can't find the image but otz took pictures on one of his streams of the dye differences, logwood does basically nothing but the tar bottle is darker than sin and amazing as hell
---
Just bring a bag instead of dye (or bring a tar bottle)
---
PS4 survivor wait times can be absolutely abysmal. PS4 killer wait times are usually very quick.
---
I know you're downvoting this guy, but he's right. My boyfriend got a 5 day ban for body blocking someone as doctor this same way.
---
Swiggoty swooty, comin' for dat booty
---
Thank god someone else noticed the wraith bug, I played a few games with him after the update and I thought I was going crazy. He's easily my most played killer - really hope they fix this soon as I have no desire to play him in his current state. :(
---
??
---
Was referring to the "Nobody:" which people still use in memes for god knows what reason.
---
Freddy's to high. If you play safe he cant do that much. Hag should be higher. Plague should be higher. Everything else seems okay.
---
Thats terror radius tho.
---
This is a console killer tier list. It hasn't been done before. Unless I'm mistaken. I wanted to discuss with other console players.
---
Ikr? Did you know legions knife can INJURE people? I mean does BHVR even play their own game? Ridiculously OP
---
I didn't put Hag higher because of problems with frames.
---
I would agree with this change if they also allowed it to work twice per game to really counter tunneling.
---
I'll call Matheiu Cote and ask him rq
---
I was accused last night of exploiting a bug for hooking survivors in basement...., didn't know about the bug and was doing Thome task with Insidious and monstrous shrine...
---
Honestly its going to break the game watch them
---
Let him heal too
---
If they fixed frames while playing her, she's easily A tier.
---
He's just testing the hook sounds
---
They're back and you go squish again when you hit people on hook
---
A mock to new players
---
The sounds are back along with the squishy hit
---
The day before Yesterday I was on Leary's as the pig and I managed to get like 12 basement hooks and I felt so accomplished, I then learnt about the glitch and felt like shit
---
Maybe he was running the add-ons that make it so you have to get closer to reveal him.
---
I've tried 
---
-intro
---
-skip_intro
---
-skip-intro
---
and none seem to work for me.
---
Nah because it‚Äôs surprising when you spawn right next to a hex. I get what you mean though
---
Laughs in otz
---
Looks like a lil black kid with his head tilted back and the hand covering his neck
---
So OP players auto DC lol
---
Lazy texturing that
---
Twice is a bit much but I mean if hooking someone else cancels it idk if it would be that oppressive
---
I don't think he did since you could hear the noise of me revealing him from a far distance at the start.
---
Instant downs exist to assist new and experienced players in chases. I am aware players dislike to be cut short with the game or with their life time. But you are still able you dodge them long enough if you know what you're doing. 
---
Also, by the looks of it OP got tired getting insta and kept quitting.
---
Can someone explain ?
---
Why, that was cute...
---
Frames dont impact hag really imo.
---
I will get removed regardless
---
I feel like on PC, you can teleport to traps faster.
---
I once trapped a david as lf in pale rose ship when he tried to hide, i couldn't stop laughing afterwards (i let him go obviously)
---
Right so the idea is you could use it twice per match but if someone else gets hooked it deactivates it until you're hooked again.
---
Well if it does, then so be it.
---
His dash is better than Billy's saw. it dosent stop when you bump into stuff, has better turning control and has a way shorter cooldown when stopping manually. Also his demon strike pretty much garentees an insta down if you get near the target.
---
It has been done. By myself among others. But I almost agree with this list but I would rank Wraith higher and Freddy lower.
---
Congrats
---
weird it worked in the past i thought, you should be able to just delete the movie 
---
&gt;Steam&gt;Properties&gt;Game files&gt;DeadByDaylight&gt;Content&gt;Movies
---
And delete LoadingScreen.MP4
---
Doesn't matter if it's been done or not. Tier lists are banned because of how much they were spammed
---
Yeah same, that guy most be posting from an alternate universe or something.
---
Whatevs
---
Yeah, but his feral frenzy attacks now don't work with the perks like sloppy butcher, save the best for last etc. So now he is just an m1 killer that occasionally can move a bit faster
---
I just wanted a place to discuss with other console players since killer viability so pretty different on console.
---
Btw I agree with your list. Except for Myers. I think he‚Äôs very mediocre but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
This used to happen to me all the time (specifically, every time I trashed a ritual, it would re-roll the ritual once, and then again once I quit the game or entered a match). I don't know why it stopped but it hasn't happened to me for a few weeks.
---
I would recommend, any time you get a new ritual (either upon starting the game or trashing an existing ritual), exit the game and restart it before entering a match. That should get it locked in before you go in so you know what you're trying for.
---
Is wraith so bad? I like playing with him more than any other, even when I get less kills per game. I'm planning on being main killer. Is it a bad idea to main him?
---
Can someone explain this bug? Is it only on PC?
---
new releases dont have leatherface and freddy DLC due to licencing issues.
---
nah, the amount of times this would just cause you to be slugged, hook the other person, return within 60s would be more then current.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6dw27/was_bugged_for_5_minutes_could_not_get_out_of_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
What kind of fucking ads did they have back then? It's so cheesy and stupid, the part at the end when he pee's on the kid is the worst part
---
Behind ace I think.
---
I'm also a Quentin main, but i'm thinking about changing over to Jane because of the lack of cosmetics for Quentin.
---
I don't come against him much on console and when I do, they're very solid. Mostly because of certain perks like Monitor and Abuse and his strong add ons.
---
I'm worried this might count as altering the game files and get a ban for this? Thank you though!
---
(Its probably because laurie really loves to hike her pants way up)
---
The basement glitch is literally just hook a survivor in the basement. 100% of the time. They now fall through the map for eternity yet seem to be hooked normally on everyone else's screen.
---
You can save them and heal them.  There body is there you can use coms to guide a friend out since he cant see where he is on the map but then they cant interact with anything
---
Head on is annoying for me it‚Äôs a free stun for wasting some time making loud noise to make me go over there so you can get a stun and run off.
---
Okay, if it gets taken down, that's fine. Also unless you can link me to a console killer tier list, I haven't seen one myself.
---
Ironically Florida Man is the true hero rn
---
this is some good content
---
I had a week where every single time I played Killer (I was around rank 17) all of the survivors were in purple ranks. Every single one.
---
It.... was a rough week.
---
That should work as you can grab if you slightly faster irl like wtf too op when he's a legit bot to play
---
Yea definitely but I don't how much they've changed since their nerfs and tweaks
---
Can't link you to one because the tier list ban happened a while ago, they were all taken down
---
Not at all. If you say it is, you're trash. Uwu
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Unmuted the video at the end and got hit with the worst earrape ever
---
you definitely can, but that's not really due to frames. that's due to people spamming the fuck out of control and mwdown constantly.
---
Same here
---
I like the yeet part my dude
---
I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs Freaky Friday
---
I love Wraith, but some people aren't skillful with him. I'd say I'm pretty good with him so in the right hands, he's definitely B tier. Every Freddy I go against in red ranks absolutely destroys. It could be because of strong perk combos and add ons.
---
Sneaky boi and sneaky girl having wholesome fun being sneaky
---
DS wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for tunneling. Too many killers immediately go for the person just unhooked because it's the easier kill. 
---
 Please note that I'm not saying all killers do this, just enough that it makes it kind of a problem. 
---
Added note, tunneling freshly unhooked people also wouldn't work if certain survivors would stop the insta-save bullcrap so they can farm BP. Killers tunneling is bad, but you jackasses pulling someone off the hook while the killer is 5 feet away, or while you're being chased, are the real problem.
---
Fair enough
---
I don't think clown is as bad as legion as well atleast clown has a ability that's slightly useful while legion just doesn't
---
His power is easier to fill than you think, you can often use it and right as it ends fill it back up almost instantly if you save a pile of orbs somewhere on the map. And nemesis isn't that great if the survivor can see you and thus knows where you are, and due to how big and loud oni is (especially in blood fury) it's not that hard to know where you are in a chase.
---
If we know them it's next year with the never coming legion rework
---
Forever Freddy is annoying to be sure but I still wouldn't rank him in S. Maybe a low A or high B.
---
Samara and The Xenomorfh sorry for bad spelling
---
Can people who bought him still play him ?
---
*confused pig sounds*
---
Maybe the ban is lifted? I don't see that rule anywhere. I think people should be more worried about the basement glitch posts that are flooding new posts.
---
excuse me i just want to see the pupper
---
True hero avoiding basement hooks tbh
---
Thank you
---
I don't think he's as bad as Legion either, but think he's at least a bit worse than Doctor and Leatherface.
---
Thanks fam
---
No one cares we need legion to be a killer he's z tier and I actually bought him
---
Yay I got over 20 DC in the 25ish games I played today and I‚Äôm at rank one... like bru... thank god that people will get punished for it now
---
It‚Äôs certainly referring to newer inexperienced players that play the first survivor in his default outfit and spend the entire match hiding and going in lockers because they‚Äôre still naive and spooked. 
---
Despite that, I‚Äôve always interpreted it as a friendly teasing jab, not necessarily over-cruel or mean. Baby Dweets are often cringe to watch and frustrating to play with but they are also adorable and wholesome in their own way. Besides, we all started as a baby Dweet.

Oh yea definitely (well not leatherface I think but doctor yea kinda) probably should've just stuck him at the end of d tier because he honestly doesn't fit in F but we all have different opinions
---
You already lose points if someone gets hooked and get them back if they get unhooked by anyone. Killers can easily force you out of the gates if they are open giving you know choice but to leave.
---
If it's the last two, I'd hook the one who framed and give the hatch to the last guy.
---
Oversaturated content. Jesus, there's like three to four of these a day now.
---
Were these bugs in the PTB?
---
Yea ive started to play killer (oni is fun) but before then rank 15 survivors were making me rage because i couldnt catch them but yet i could loop a rank one killer for 2 gens w ruin? But if a random is getting camped i can usualy get him away w borrowed time as long as i they take a hit i can take chase
---
Or I could just ask someone on Reddit to tell me.
---
I‚Äôm not the op but I am an artist while I can‚Äôt say what techniques op used as every artist is different I recommend drawing a rough skeletal pose and then refine it and add details. If you‚Äôre just starting to draw I highly recommend getting a butt load of pose references, and clothes references (quick google search will help) and save them and then create something new using said references, but try not to copy the references too much as it can lead to a bad habit of just copying other people‚Äôs work it‚Äôs mainly there to help create an image
---
I think he fun and powerful, but it‚Äôs coming from a Xbox player that is rank one so, go see for yourself
---
What else would you use to shit in tall grass?
---
Where dedicated servers are enabled.
---
can i take notes? i can really learn something here... hehe nice work!
---
Dude, tier lists are banned for oversaturated content since it made up about 80% of the posts. And yeah those basement videos might get banned too. No way the ban was lifted either without an announcement. But I think the mods want to avoid another tierpocolypse
---
I just used it on Spirit and everyone DC‚Äôed
---
I've went against good Doctors and Leatherfaces, but I can't say the same for Clown. They just spam throw bottles everywhere and use the exhaustion add on.
---
So apparently when someone gets hooked in the basement right now
---
Their character will fall off the map
---
Happened to me
---
Should only work if the unhooker doesn't have borrowed
---
I got it earlier out of luck. Three people dced and I gave the last survivor the hatch.
---
That survivor death sound effect at the end had me like üíÄ
---
Yes I played him yesterday but I bought him 4 months ago
---
I'm not arguing about this anymore. If my post gets taken down, so be it. In the meantime, I'm enjoying discussing with other console players.
---
IMO (console player too) Myers is way too high
---
Yup! That exact thing happened to me too. I saw somewhere that it might be a bug with agitation? But I‚Äôm not sure how true that is.
---
Switch has leatherface now
---
Yea most clowns do that becausethey aren't good at him but once you go against a fairly decent one loops just get demolished, went against a p3 one that hit his bottles 90% of the time and loops were just so risky and window tiles were a no go zone)
---
This is some /r/terriblefacebookmemes material.
---
I once asked a group of teabaggers to please stop teabagging in the post-game chat. (Insulting them surely won't accomplish anything; surely talking to them like adults could work, right?)
---
They told me to grow up. Then they all reported me and insulted me until I left.
---
I sincerely hope they worked through whatever troubles they were going through out-of-game.
---
Imagine playing Pig or Hag and being red/green colourblind and also not having hands to control the game on the new map
---
One person can bring it and you have to assume everyone has it. When someone is unhooked and you come across them and down them you are given 2 options. A: pick them up and eat the ds this essentially means you have to win 4 chases against this survivor instead of 3. So if you eat everyones ds you now have to win 16 chases instead of 12. This option is the worst one because you lose your momentum as 3 people can stay on gens as this person basically saved themself and is now given 5 seconds to make it to a loop to start an additional chase. Option B leave them slugged as you try and find another survivor. This is your best option as it forces someone to leave a gen to pick them up, however you did just spend time downing a survivor and were unable to progress your main objective of hooking survivors. This doesnt seem bad until you factor that you have to play around everyone having ds. Ao potentially you can down someone, hook them, they get unhooked, you encounter them again, you slug them to play around the ds, later in the game this same process happens again meaning for this one survivor you had to play around ds twice meaning you committed to downing the survivor 2 times and were not able to hook them so you may need to down 1 survivor as much as 5 times to get 3 hooks to kill them. And this is only for 1 survivor, this could happen for all 4 survivors meaning ds has a potential impact 8 different times in the game in which you need to down the survivor and cannot hook them, increasing the total times you need to down survivors from 12 to 20. In conclusion ds is op because eating even just 1 ds can cost you the game because it makes you lose all momentum and allows one survivor to stay in chase while all 3 others are on gens or it can increase the amount of downs you need per game by as much as 75% which could cause you to lose the game as it almost doubles your total objectives.
---
Ouch. Wiggle bug and the basement bug in the same clip.
---
M1 is a pc term of melee attack
---
In that shape he could sit on you and you die
---
It's like the question of "Is there a super FBI who checks on the FBI". Same question goes for the fun police. And those who fun police the fun police. Does it keep going or do you eventually reach a penultimate fun police?
---
What do you mean? When the server disconnects that means the final guy disconnected?
---
I'm always curious how broke this game is that they can cause bugs this bad. I mean what about this patch caused every basement hook to break, survivor wiggling and item addons to not work
---
No it's not.
---
If they count crashes, I'm screwed. My game freezes on the loading screen at least 10 times a day.
---
Thank you for being what‚Äôs wrong with the community.
---
Meanwhile, on console people will continue to DC like complete dick bags.
---
you're a good person, I wish more people were as considerate as this
---
Doubt they will count those.
---
Welp, you can hook them in the basement if it's their 3rd hook, no harm done.
---
Again, I said bhvr should enable M&amp;K for console
---
Everything is legal.  Including camping. Rest of the things in people's salty minds.
---
Alt + f4 will fix the bug
---
Why? O.o
---
punishment for DCs and the basement bug is in the game, makes sense that I should share at a white screen for God knows how long
---
I typically always let the last guy go just because I don‚Äôt care that much about 4king I‚Äôm happy to just get a 3k.(I‚Äôm not saying killers have to do this) it‚Äôs just how I like to play. Unless it‚Äôs a survivor that was clearly just hiding all game.
---
It would've been nice to see some gameplay or something. I'm pretty sure salty end game chats are against the sub's rules.
---
Meanwhile on console, all the toxic players can continue to DC.
---
Yea I was going to do that but it just felt like overkill
---
Same I do it typically unless all 4 are dicks
---
Personally I‚Äôve never faced a thana/calling GF so I‚Äôve always been fine looping GF like nothing but I‚Äôm also just a mid rank survivor but a high rank killer
---
Dude I'd rather get moried, literally stab me in the face it's better than getting put in the sunken place.
---
I see him on pc game pass version. They only one I dont see is Feddy. Leather and Myers are in there.
---
i main him as well, he isnt as bad as people say, but he is one of the worst killers in the game.
---
His addons are really good, but his power almost harms him more then it helps him. 
---
If you are new to the game there are 2 basic quality that makes a good killer, 1 being Chase potential. AKA how quickly they can end chases against the survivors, and 2 being map pressure, basically how much they can keep survivors off gens.
---
Wraith has decent map pressure and decent chase potential if used VERY WELL. but thats it, he is just decent.
---
If you are wanting to main him, then do it! i main him and he is a ton of fun! but i suggest picking up a higher tier killer as well to help you in the higher ranks, I suggest billy since he is easy to pick up but has a massive skill cap and can really fuck shit up no matter what rank you are at!
---
whats the point of sprinting around? whats you're value if you're sprinting around? Do you sprint around in deep wound before the change?
---
Bocchi!!!!!!
---
I used the basement in 6 games because of the challenges. I also knew the glitch was a thing am I the bad guy?
---
It says shitpost, but i feel like its a rant.
---
The big problem for me is that my Archives challenge rn is the ‚ÄòHook 5 Survivors in the Basement‚Äô- I was incredibly conflicted. I didn‚Äôt want to fuck people‚Äôs game up, but I really need to speed up my challenges because it ain‚Äôt too long until the Rift closes (and I‚Äôm only at tier 35). So I did it, feeling really awful about it, so decided to let the remaining three live (also, there was one DC and they were playing like rank 20s even before I brought them to the basement).
---
Also you get bloodpoints from looping, but lose bloodpoints from camping. That even more tells you that it's an intended game mechanic
---
I will take advantage of the situation and kill whoever I catch first indiscriminately. If the farmer gets away though, I will recognize that they are toxic and try to make sure they don't escape.
---
This also applies to dark souls, maybe even more so than dbd...
---
People argue that the lack of bump stun makes him better. Good billies don't care about bump they can drift through the map just as good as Oni and do sharper curves. Plus no cooldown, and his charge attack is waaaay too weird and hard to hit, so yeah, the bump is on missed attacks.
---
Once you reach close to red ranks thats when ppl get the hang of GF. Without spine chill, you will need at least vigorous 4-5 months of experience to go against GF optimally (meaning he wont be able to just willy nilly hide behind something and expose you or be True‚Äôs build and act like a surprise around loops)
---
I quit the game for good after this recent update. I really wanted to give Behavior the benefit of the doubt but they *never* listen and they're more focused on creating new content than they are with addressing complaints and requests from the community and are ridiculously obtuse and opaque when it comes to actually communicating with us.
---
It's a strange example, but Star Wars Battlefront 2, the recent one with the lootbox controversy, was completely revived by the dev team because they had community liasons constantly talking to the community on places like Reddit and Twitter, actually looking at suggestions and requests and bug complaints and all of those things were taken into consideration. The developers of that game, need I remind you, are DICE, who are also supporting a lot of other shit, and even they can make time to talk to and listen to the community. They aren't perfect but they've done more than Behavior ever has.
---
Behavior, on the other hand, just doesn't. How long have we been asking for a new primary objective so that the game doesn't become an M1 simulator for survivors and a stressful race for precious seconds to killers? How long have we been asking for buffs to favorite killers or meaningful balances in overpowered killers? How long have we been asking for accessibility options for colorblind people? 90% of all of it has been ignored and what hasn't been ignored has either taken *months* of constant requesting to be dealt with and in some cases (read: Legion) the opposite of what we want to happen is done.
---
On top of all of that they just never communicate what's happening. The Halloween event is a perfect example where we were left in the dark until the day before the event's eventual release. Even in the Reddit AMA they never answered any real questions, it was all jokes and fluff.
---
Even Dedicated Servers they managed to fuck up and they've been causing massive, game breaking issues since their activation and they haven't been touched since. It seems like the community is just shouting at the sky at this point and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the fun killers being barely touched and completely shit, I'm sick of the bandaids over real issues, I'm sick of having to run the same perks over and over again because the devs refuse to fix the problems that make them a necessity, and I'm sick of being ignored. 
---
I wanted Behavior to pull this game out of the shit and give it the fixes it deserves but it'll never happen at this point so I don't see why I should keep playing it. They'll just keep throwing shiny new cosmetics and characters and maps onto the pile of rotting trash in hopes you don't see the trash under the sparkles.
---
Every month, I get to rank 8. And every 13th day of the month, I derank to 15. It‚Äôs the most infuriating thing.
---
Just don't listen to people. Survivors and killers have these mindsets of how people should play but if you are looping the killer then you are just doing good. Killer is really the toxic one in the end if they camped. People just act nasty on the game and my advice is to just ignore it unless they have something good to say.
---
If you have some decent addons he's a beast but without addons you're just gonna get toyed with.
---
Legions had mains? Since day one legion has been broken tho
---
Yes. Run in straight lines and if you hit a wall continue running into it to avoid being toxic.
---
Oh yes, and he should be able to transform into survivors and and wear hockey mask. 
---
And fly
---
Mama myers big mad
---
Looping is just the smartest thing to do, you can't blame survivors for trying to win
---
Looping is not toxic if you run in a straight line YOU WILL DIE.
---
He called us Twats
---
I meant removing the collision is a fair nerf.
---
Window vaulting never really got me. I dont know why I was just always able to place myself in the right spot and predict it. Think it only ever caught me off guard once
---
To be fair that build is completely counterfun and uninteractive. 
---
And at least he didn't kill himself on first hook.
---
Stay strong man we got this
---
Second one was amazing too.
---
You don‚Äôt lose blood points. You lose emblem progress. And devs have advocated it as a strategy. But it‚Äôs an incredibly low skill one that doesn‚Äôt require you to outplay anyone which is why it is detrimental to your emblem
---
Did it to someone by accident, totally didn‚Äôt think of it until after I hooked her, so once she was unhooked I knocked her and walked her out of basement and dropped her mid map. She was fine after. I even gave her hatch for it because I felt bad.
---
Ah right, my bad.
---
25% increase for 10 seconds? I get it's super situational but fucking christ imagine a spirit coming out of her power with that lmao
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should!~
---
It's required for borrowed time to work.
---
Meanwhile, when I bring this bug up in the comments on the new update:
---
"lol thats an intended feature, you're not supposed to be able to walk on your traps"
---
The REAL use for STBFL.
---
I think it might be ad-ons in general. The medkit ad-ons are completely fucked as well.
---
He probably had z frustrating game :D As someone who knows both the dark side and the light side of the entity I would be proud either way
---
Oh no haha, poor nea! We had a rly good wraith who didnt tunnel or camp so it was fun
---
Hey Behaviour love the game alot but bot killers so much. Love being a survivor main its more fun less stressful. But good job updating this game it really needs some more because its a awesome game that has a great future of more cool scary killers like oni hes cool and scary unlike some others. But sorry for the hateful criticism i just get really fustrated so i take it out on reddit lol. Thank you
---
I hope they will fix it soon.
---
Have too is understandable. Want to? Then your a twat, mate.
---
Our boy didn‚Äôt become champion of alola for this bullshittery
---
I get where you're coming from, and I understand. If youre doing random invasions, you can get ganked and cheesed like crazy, but right clubs is where it's at for PvP dark souls. But I understand the point you're making.
---
This is a great phone wallpaper!
---
You shot me down
---
well that is pretty dumb since this bug is very game breaking honestly
---
im sure it will just take them longer, and im sure its also an issue with the FPS
---
That was some fine math my dude but what if you add Kurt Angle to the mix?
---
Technically they actually are, but it stops mattering once you unlock shared perks.
---
Laughs in trapper
---
Play with you food refers to aggressive actions I think.
---
Hitting the attack is still definitely something I need to work on. It still just feels really awkward to me and the way he raises his arms and blocks a good chunk of the screen, at least for me, makes it hard to read the survivors movements. I'm still finding myself when just doing the attack not even dashing first either whiffing or bumping into something when I flick to the side to try and adjust the angle at which I need to attack. Even his normal attack throws me off sometimes. It seems like his lunge is a shorter range than ghostface's even though ghost face has a short knife and he has a lot ass sword.
---
Im convinced this sub is filled with a bunch of children that don't know how to meme, so they just copy what they see. Such little creativity or imagination ffs
---
It is actually very similar to the basement bug, as in it's your camera not moving, but your character is still doing normal shit to everyone else. I had a oni walk around smacking things one game and turns out he was stuck in a gen and was trying to lunge out and stuff, but he was just blindly wandering about for me, totally not stuck in a gen, just beating up walls.
---
Duration could use a buff though lmao
---
I did it the first three games ever and thought that‚Äòs normal xD
---
Well to be honest the basement is one of Hag's powers
---
D:
---
I‚Äôm both busy and tired. I don‚Äôt have the mental fortitude to go searching for patch notes, fam. But I hear you.
---
Shit meme gtfo
---
Its 'they' because its a legion....2 dudes 2 girls. Its a group, what else you gonna refer to them as th
---
agreed before end game came out we told them about how this could be a issue but they said it does not happen that much and did not listren now pretty much everygame has the gates at the same wall lol
---
Dunno, the pig has a power for a great lunge, and the rbt make someone lose a good amount of time
---
I like that build. I gotta look into it.
---
Oof this is me xD
---
oh my god, i had this bug multiple times even without using it while escaping and it‚Äòs so annoying
---
Oh I got you. But yeah, a trick I did at shack was that I stood at the window and just watched the survivor, if they eventually went around back I would phase, if they went for god pallet I would short phase to the pallet, and if they just stayed there I would phase in through one of doors or vault. Point is, having no vault animation means the survivor literally has no idea what you are going to do. I get that is kind of Spirit's thing, but at that point it is kind of ridiculous.
---
Legion‚Äôs EVERYTHING could use a buff. I‚Äôm taking what I can get.
---
Why you heff to be mad?
---
I think its just addons in general, I've lost 2 styptics like this
---
Shhh, you're ruining the circlejerk.
---
"But Daddddddddddddddd"
---
Also unpopular opinion, but both of those perks were kind of overrated anyways.
---
There are so many good perks in the game im sure you can something to use on a killer that is really good at injuring survivors.
---
I've escaped in red ranks 3 times after endgame, just dont look for hatch just chill at a door. If you are lucky you can get it open 90% of the time.
---
Thanatophobia on legion is way better in legion than sloppy.
---
Pretty much how I feel. It‚Äôs going to come back to bite them in the future unfortunately.
---
if you don't want to use his power for hots, just use it for crazy map control, you can use pop and the easily take a look at every gen and decide on which you want to use it. He has a massive map control
---
Guys, i figured it out, if it happens and someone unhooks you, you can try to get out of the basement in the blind and the game will be back to normal. If that fails, there is a chance the killer will comeback, grab you and if you are not dead on hook, get hooked again like normal but the camera might not bug so if you get unhooked you can get out. Overall, pretty shitty situation tbh
---
I went against someone without agitation and still got it. My friends also had the same glitch that game. In a game after that we were able to wiggle though
---
You won the internet today
---
Well I took a hiatus from the game and wasn't aware of the glitch. That's B.S though hooking survivors in the basement was my favorite thing to do
---
Yup. Not to mention that he's so slow that survivors can read it, think and react really fast. Hey Oni, here's an Idea: SWING SIDEWAYS SO PEOPLE DON'T SIDESTEP YOU
---
You may be right, but still, that doesn't change the fact that that now legion is basically an m1 killer now
---
There‚Äôs also the medkit bug. If you put on bandages on a medkit or speed add ons it won‚Äôt do anything for the medkit. Instead it will deplete like you didn‚Äôt put anything on lol.
---
This. If I could get more than 30 fps, that would be greeeeeat.
---
That‚Äôs really good. I usually get to r4 or r5 at least each month but for a newer survivor that‚Äôs really good. Well done!!! Also keep it up. I don‚Äôt see many people running deny but that‚Äôs cool :)
---
Nice idea. You could also combine it with that add-on that takes you out of cloak
---
Wow that's a lot of quality, your pc must hate you
---
i think the only way it can be is if the survivor camps a building like the ironworks against a low tier killer.
---
but even that is just a thing with me, it would be like getting mad at killers for using there power.
---
I had this happen to me tonight and somehow still managed to escape. What a match.
---
That sucks. I am deliberately holding out on doing the basement challenges because I don¬¥t want to be an asshole and ruin the game for survivors. 
---
Some people are just mean.
---
I *think* you can still get him in-game with Auric Cells.
---
Adorable, is what it is.
---
Eevee is superfast although its more of a gameengine than traditional render engine was learning compositing so did these sets in one go :P
---
Skemoo doing the Entity's work! Love your renders man, the crispness! Good job.
---
#1 would be worth using for the same reason as tombstone addons for myers - no hooks mori
---
#2 sadly, but I think it is somehow balanced by his roar at the activation. By the way, nemesis &amp; dark devotion give you pretty same bonus.
---
3# is not exactly the same as current beads. Because survivors will hear the close proximity terror for the duration of bloodfury, instead of knowing the exact moment killer is in ability. Also it would have synergy with terror based perks
---
Challenges that revolve around basement hooks tho
---
I thought they were playing a game of rock-paper-scissors for a second there.

---
and not only that but aside from those glitches I have been getting stuck inside the gens in my matches as killer after I go kick them. this game is completely broken at the moment.
---
Jason takes Manhattan is an underrated gem damnit
---
The OP's suggestion is that the other 3 members are standing still, which makes it easier to implement
---
would would have thought, the 2nd yamamoshit map is bad
---
Ya I saw Oni the first day quite a bit but now I only see him 1 in every 5 games or so.
---
I've seen a few. Generally not fun. A lot of people don't bring a way to heal themself so they basically become Oni Power Feeders.
---
Uh, that‚Äôs literally how you do testing in software development.
---
‚ÄúHey bud, can you hook me in the basement? Lets see if everything still works correctly after the code has been updated!‚Äù
---
PS4 exclusives are way to good to swap to PC
---
The only time I would consider looping to be toxic is when it‚Äôs an infinite loop that spawned in the map and survivors continuously abuse it like the map with the the cows hanging up in the building (not meat tree) or when survivors used to all 4 run balanced landing and then put on handonfield offerings but other than that no looping isn‚Äôt toxic it‚Äôs the only way survivors can kill time or actually run away from the killer.. the reason killers think it‚Äôs toxic is bc they aren‚Äôt very good and go against survivors that have 1500+ hours in the game so they know what loops are safe which ones are mind game able ect making it hard for newer killers to actually catch them giving killers the impression that it‚Äôs impossible
---
Yea basically. Especially on console, haven't encountered a single Oni.
---
Yea, I've been playing alot of Oni everyone is basically just a Blood Orb sack giving me my ability every 30 seconds
---
wake up was a shit tier perk that increased exit gate opening speed by 20% and u could see gate auras. Now in some patch BHVR fucked up so bad that wake up gave 20% increase in EVERYTHING, including gen repair speed. So every game had a 4 man swf with tool boxes and wake up, basically ending games in under 2 minutes
---
Still an improvement
---
Well shit now I have to choose between, putting players in the basement and forcing a glitch on them
---
Or not put then basement and loose out on the power the basement has, but now be an asshole because the basement is now literally broken
---
He edited his comment...
---
I fell throught the basement several times yesterday, the worst is getting unhooked. You're still stuck, just let me die.
---
Jane made a big brain play. She's earned herself the nickname of "NoEd Preventor" in my eyes.
---
They‚Äôre like weeping angels
---
Falling away...from...me
---
You mean altruism farmers?
---
I absolutely consider spirits changes as just that, ‚Äúchanges‚Äù, not a nerf
---
While it‚Äôs true she isn‚Äôt as strong as she was before, a lot of it were just very necessary changes to overpowered mechanics and add-ons
---
Spirit‚Äôs place on the general tier list didn‚Äôt budge, she‚Äôs still #2, only beat by nurse, so I wouldn‚Äôt really personally say it was a nerf
---
The amount of "oni testing"  is going down now. But he is fun to play and a good killer he will be as common as huntress on high rank i guess
---
I love these!
---
It's funny cause he was still the worst killer in the game even before Cursed Legacy. Now, he's the worst killer in the game with a side of paste.
---
Imagine getting downed by a rubber chicken!
---
You know if you scrolled further down on this sub reddit, you can see this has been posted way too many times already
---
You need to distract the killer and get him away from the gate, yes sometimes you have to, that is just like getting lightbringer points while being chased. 
---
If the killer hard camps the gates it's obviously really shit from him. Everything he is doing is to stop the game and make it a pain in the ass to try to bring it back to rolling.
---
But usually a spawn like that leads to people being hooked and trying to get the killer away from the gates. I mean, if you worry about not being able to get everybody out it you and your team can pick perks like Borrowed Time or Mettle of Man to be able to get them out and tank for them. Obviously DS is also an option.
---
Well god bloody deam it
---
Misread "patrol"
---
I was streaming yesterday and this is what literally happened to me, I am about to submit it to this subreddit and saw yours :D I just kept on falling until killer downed me again and picked me up
---
Did this last night as LF whole team went in there twice didn't even see the other side of the map.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6ez3u/bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If you‚Äôre  just starting I suggest you earn blood points but not pip. As killer chase, hit, special attack, slug, but don‚Äôt hook. As survivor don‚Äôt escape and practice looping while learning the maps.  It will keep you at low ranks for awhile until you get up to speed and a few perks under your belt.
---
The stark difference between boomers and the zoomer-inclined.
---
No longer busted still means it got nerfed.  
---
She also has no collission when phasing and she has a vault animation
---
Why the hell is it so dark in there!? I thought I was going blind...
---
You wont get banned they cant tell the difference between people who dont know and abusers. If anyone tell you u will it's just an empty threat.
---
Then again it was so satisfying to hook all 4 of the SWF team lately that teabagged at every pallet, lots of bloodpoints were gained as a result as well. They very really sweaty by the end and made stupid mistakes. Still think SWF in current form is cancer and the member of the teams should have some sort of penalty just like multiple survivors working on one gen have a penalty to speed.
---
Ikr? Peasants complaining, I have both exit gates covered while dancing in the basement as trapper
---
Sure you can complain  but as long as it's part of the actual game (so DCs and Cheating excluded) it won't do much except making you look like a selfish idiot.
---
Maybe people have fun playing a certain way and the restrictions you put on yourself not using "scummy tactics" doesn't have to apply to everyone.
---
And what is the 'correct' title may I ask?
---
I would actually love for there to be some sort of mechanic that punished hook farmers, like transferring health states, if I hit the person who got unhooked, the person who unhooked them gets injured instead - but I have no weapon cooldown and they get no speed boost. :P

---
Nah I like my stabby gang
---
Yes! It only pops back up if the killer drops me and picks me up again.
---
The reason I hate SWF is probably because they are usually well coordinated teams are headache to deal with, they know where you are at all times, if you're camping, slugging is useless too because well they can call out where they are, picking someone up is a risk because you will most likely get blinded and they will block the hook. I know most SWFs don't play like that but when you do encounter a swf like that it's absolutely frustrating.
---
I'm on PC but use a gamepad its pretty bad due to  ot being able to turn the camera quick enough.
---
You can kill three and let last one escape via hatch, because if you close it, you risk final survivor opening the gate which will fail your challenge
---
This actually hits my feels.
---
If swf was to be removed I dont think I'd play the game anymore. Even with friends it can be hard to enjoy the game. Its super glitchy right now, killers can be toxic af which ruins the fun, and even random survivors can be toxic and unkind.
---
It‚Äôs hard dude when ur using a subpar killer and survivors are toxic yeah bagging attention whores that troll new killer making people not want to use them so they go back to tier 1 killers
---
I've had a game where my friend was being face camped by a Leatherface. The other 2 survivors ran in trying to save him meanwhile I got 2 generators done alone. Even after the Leatherface downs 1 of the 2, he would continue to face camp my friend and let the downed guy crawl out for help. After picking up the downed guy, they still ran back in trying to help my friend while he was struggling and trying to buy time.
---
They tried to call me out and their reason for trying to save my camped friend was "We can't let anyone die".
---
Nah man..., do it after hook you check around if someone pops up with chilly and push on...
---
I think that no one think that facecamping is funny, but a lot of killer do that, so...
---
Sucks that i don‚Äôt see Freddy dlc in the game pass version on pc. I wanted to buy him
---
My guess is that using the arrow keys (or q and e as most people change them to) is faster than using a mouse. I mean I don't see any real reason to change the flick.
---
Anything goes when those exit gates are powered, all rules are out the fucking window
---
Eh. Its not the best but comes handy. The other 2 are alot better
---
He can fuck survivors exhaustion perks with his addons
---
I mean everybody decent already has it.
---
Yikes. Woke up early. Thought "I've got some 5 hours to play DBD!"
---
First game fell through the map.
---
I'm done until it gets fixed. 
---
Depending on how effectively and quickly the fix it, I might not ever play. 
---
I mean seriously. WTF. Way to drop the ball, guys
---
Damn right :D
---
And here she is: the salty p3 Claudette, talking bullshit about "OP Killers"
---
Does the audio corruption include when you get stuck with the ‚Äúcarrying Survivor‚Äù music as Killer? Because it‚Äôs so hard to play with that constantly.
---
Or even with Borrowed Time, like when you're partially blocked between the killer and the unhooker, you don't get the full speed boost for getting hit and are generally easily downed again.
---
BT is a tool to punish camping killers, using it in any other way (unhooking immediately before the killer can leave or leading the killer back to the hook) is asking to get someone tunneled.
---
no idea lmao
---
Na you're just promoting your twitch account.
---
Some buld are unbalanced, so unbalanced that u use that and u did 4k, as survivor didn't exist something like this, i'm not saing that u need to nerf all the killers but they don't even nerf the survivor every time,like they do with ds, insta heal, borrowtime,etc,etc...
---
Welcome to Tome 3! Hope you enjoy seeing NOED a fucking lot.
---
This format always gets me, never gets old
---
Yea, i did not play him at all in the PTB and felt like he is easy to counter, he is ok but i am not hyped at all
---
Also ghostface with some addon is unpossible to spot, even if u are in front of him, i think this is unbalanced
---
I am sorry, I am probably stupid, but... what exactly are these penalties? Is it based on just one disconnect? The timer will be longer, orrrrr...?
---
removed for flooding please post these in one thread thank you
---
Yeah but joysticks as well? Anyone on console who has played Oni will tell you that even on max sens you cant flick or barely turn at all, so does this only mean PC players who also use a controller? Because I would think that a controller would work the same on both systems...
---
He still exist, sounds like a reason to me! (sarcasm)
---
That scared the living hell out of me the first time i turned back around at the.
---
As someone that plays both survivor and killer it can be frustrating having a swf  coordinating everything. The scales are heavily tilted toward the survivor. Have you played killer? I usually don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs 2 swf that load in and I can tell. But if it‚Äôs a whole 4 person swf team with toolboxes and flashlights... no thank you. I‚Äôd say try and play killer and you‚Äôll see.
---
Where I have heard "but it's in the game" before?
---
Oh right! Survivors abusing Wake Up!
---
PC and switch
---
I'm not a main survivor i play both, but i prefere to play with my friends. And as a both player i can say that the killer are unbalanced, so probably u are a main killer that has never tried survivor
---
This is the only community I've seen that blames players for bugs instead of devs. If the basement hook is the only one i can get to. Guess what, you're going in the basement. i'm sorry if u get the bug but it's not my fault the bug exists in the first place. I'm just playing the game. Maybe avoid getting downed near the basement? or Don't hide in basement lockers. Maybe if i grab someone and they don't wiggle cause we both know the basement is bugged i'd take them to a different hook. but if they're wiggling they're going to the nearest hook.
---
It happened to a guy while I was playing, I picked them up and let them wiggle free. The bug was fixed on their end thankfully
---
It can be frustrating sometimes when you play against these toxic groups that only want to kill your fun. But since most swf just play like normal survivors the hate isn't really deserved imo. I think most posts are just by killers that's just went against toxic people and now have to vent.
---
And there were also blood orbs??

I firmly believe both perks for either side are training wheels and should have been on the default bloodweb, not however many years later.

Wait I haven‚Äôt played the game in a few days. What‚Äôs the bug?
---
Had a Ghostface yesterday using a basement build and dc-ed because someone wiggled out and couldn't exploit it. Some players are just so fucking sad.
---
See you in hot
---
He came in acting like an ass

Yea basically. For the camping part sometimes you gotta do what ya gotta do

I cant stop shitposting, please help.

‚ÄúCurious is the late night shitposters art, his own upvotes unwitnessed by his own eyes...‚Äù

Doesn‚Äôt rhyme though
---
TBH dropping pallets just for fun as a killer would be OP
---
It's so smooth to kobe while getting adrenaline.
---
And let me tell you: They are learning. Once they actually realise how damaging it is to their win tate they will stop, adapt and improve.
---
If I'm getting face camped as survivor I'm always just happy because I managed to outplay a low tolerance player to the point where he feels it's necessary to throw the game. As long as my team gets out I did my job and I'm happy.
---
Honestly the new map wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so damn dark
---
Billy Main here I approve this petition on console.
---
You can't spawn next to a hex anymore, if you do it's a bug that you shouldn't abuse and BHVR hasn't patched out yet, despite claims of doing so. \^\_\^
---
But you can't, so.
---
Idk how do you pronounce oni
---
wdym, i didnt see any blood orbs
---
MICHAEL PUT TWO PEOPLE IN THE BASEMENT (WHILE THERE‚ÄôS A BASEMENT GLITCH BTW) THEN BODYBLOCKED THE STAIRS TO CAMP THEM AND THEN SLUGGED ME AND THE LAST PERSON.
---
Do you mean if you try to unhook yourself or if another survivor unhooks you?
---
I would love if they removed gen tapping, grabs are already broken enough with dedicated servers causing them to randomly cancel as it is.
---
Oh wait it's the fengs hair üòÇ
---
You can break pallets. just charge his attack for a sec and hit a pallet. Idk about doing it from a demon dash though
---
You might be able to combine both controll methods to get super controll. Like you use to be able too with billy a long time ago.
---
Basically me when I play Oni. Oh you're trying to use your demon strike? Suck it imma juke you dweeb.
---
I legit spawned next to one yesterday
---
not your fault a bug made in through to live servers.
---
My neither, just going off the way I say it and how I‚Äôve heard it the most :p Oh-knee with stress on the Oh vs E-buh-knee with stress on E
---
Just found out first hand that shit suuuuucks
---
I've understand ur thought, but when i'm facecamped, i fell frustated, because i will lose the pip (but that isn't so important) and i will lose a lot of time. When i play dbd i only wont a good game, not a simple one but not even a cancer one
---
This. WoO and whatever Oni‚Äôs equivalent perk is would be great for new killers and survivors to learn pallet and vault spawns
---
I dont think i like the idea and im sure behaviour wont ever do perks where you can literally damage your teammates.
---
idiot almost did some serious damage to his own hand for a meme video.
---
Where's the brightest moon banquet when you need it
---
Trying a red key this time. Making sure "broken keys" aren't actually.... Broken.
---
You dont know BHVR
---
What is your problem with calling a nerf a nerf lmao
---
They said "almost playable", so I'm pretty sure they meant STBFL and Sloppy.
---
they have no way to track legacy as during that time I believe it was stored by the user itself
---
I advise you not to use emojis on reddit they really hate it for some reason
---
I believe that it is \*charge\* based and not based on the number of keys burnt, so you might actually need to use keys for like 90 seconds (three pink keys worth) instead of just finishing off 3 separate keys. Get yourself a key with some prayer beads and rope and test it and see if that works and then respond to this with the results.
---
At least his add ons are all somehwat useful not like ghostface who only has like 2
---
How are you going to ban people using this glitch?
---
 Just simply hooking people? What if they have no other hooks to use that are close enough? How do you know people know of the bug in the first place? Basement builds are the most common "meme" build around, and for many killers it's somewhat of a standard to do.
---
 And the hooks? Only hooks that can't be saboed or disappear after a survivor dying on them, making them the strongest placement.
---
 So how are you going to tell which killer is actually abusing it, and which killer is just playing normally
---
I'm already a prestige 1 oni kinda curious on if anyone has his p3 outfit yet
---
I think bloodhound is useless perk for oni. I meam its so ez to find or follow injured survivors with the oni because of the bloodorps, why would you need highlighted blood when you already got flying bloodorps. I mean you can also see them through walls.
---
Looking at all those Rin's mindgaming by standing at pallets
---
I approve of your art style, it is pleasing.
---
Im fairly new actually. Only been playing the game 3 months.
---
I was expecting some discussion/jokes of current events, clever memes that only make sense if you play the game and fan art.   Only been playing the game 3 months. Apparently yall like low effort memes since im getting downvoted hard&gt;?
---
Killers are so much worse than survivors. At least with survivors you can just pick a main and then keep unlocking perks on him in a 50+ Bloodweb while you level the rest for the teachables...any other choice is just cosmetics.
---
Every single killer is unique therefore you need to level each one separately for 3 tiers of perks...I even avoided non-meta teachables on purpose and I am still having the grind of my life trying to get the perks I want on killers.
---
Janes comedy gold
---
Idk if its just me but ive been Stuck in the Same place as killer and couldnt move. Survivors were nice enough to hold the game hostage until i dced when they realised i was stuck.
---
The Legion PTSD is strong at BHVR HQ. Some of the Devs must have had their asses kicked real hard by Old Legion in game.
---
Its not holding the game hostage. Once endgame starts, there is no holding the game hostage.
---
THIS, this is awful, makes playing difficult like anything else.
---
I lost my legacy during the Howling Grounds event, when they did have servers. That was actually the problem. If it was still stored locally I could have used one of the FIFTY backups I made to replace the save file...
---
How long have you been drawing? It‚Äôs really good,  composition and all, I hope you post more!
---
When facing a swf that knows how to loop, you will lose all gens before doing anything noteworthy, unless you massivelely outplay them. Permanent communication is a significant advantage.
---
I'm playing survivor and killer equally and i'm red rank with both, btw.
---
The buff killer needed. /s
---
ah I see who knows why they will not give it back to ppl maybe they never thought of backing it up when those servers went live
---
Lots of killers didn‚Äôt know :( I personally had no idea when I was playing killer until someone told me (only took one basement game) and I felt so bad. I‚Äôve been telling every killer who puts anyone in basement and most feel bad. If I get one that brags though, I‚Äôm reporting them.
---
Is this a picture of the new Clown cosmetic?
---
I dont hate swf in general, its only those people who abuse the feature and sweat their butts off. Swf on voicecoms gives you an advantage no question about it, but i dont mind the swf that only want to have fun and chill. Its really just those MLG fully optimal survivors that makes some swf groups so annoying and unfun to play against. Slap a Object of Obsession on someone and you are not a stealth killer, one can call out your position everytime and everyone knows where you are all the time. Stuff like that makes it really boring to play killer.
---
I'm fine somehow *squeezes anti-stress toy*
---
Yeah I've had this gen bug happen 3 times in two matches. When you kick a gen you teleport somewhere else on the map for the survivors but on your screen you are just stuck on the gen. Only way off is if a survivor comes near and you you can hit / grab them. Going to wait till this is patched because the game is basically unplayable with all these bugs.
---
40 seconds isn't that long and with there should be something to prevent them from instantly healing since the big problem I wanted this perk to fight is farming. If I would compare it to anything it would be deliverance.
---
Did it with 3 broken keys.
---
I always had the yellow bond addon though, so maybe burning them without addons doesn't count?
---
Hows come killers aren't entitled to courtesy downs after excessive looping and dealing with some disgusting perk builds?
---
No doubt they know but I report it every time to hopefully speed up the process
---
I hate them!!
---
How was he nerfed? Can someone tel me or link a patch notes, I am behind on thisq
---
Okay. Lets take a scalpel and take out the bits where I disagree, agree or you are just wrong.
---
&gt;Now here is the difference: whilst the ONI can‚Äôt destroy pallets
---
Wrong. Very, wrong. Holding your power button to make it into a one shots allows you to break pallets.
---
&gt;BBQ and chilli and good old NOED for tracking and downing survivors
---
BBQ yes, Noed? No. Its the same reason you wont bring it for a one shot killer. Its wasting a slot
---
&gt;-I haven‚Äôt unlocked it yet but I would say Bloodhound, as it should a good boost to tracking survivors whilst you are collecting blood orbs.
---
I doubt it is, but comboed with blood echo, perhaps. Would make for a budget BBQ really in that sense though
---
&gt;-His smash attack takes a brief time to wind up so it can be escaped if you know how to dodge.
---
True. But note, you do not need to hold it all the way. As long as the Kanabo glows, its a 1 shot. Just dont tap it. Tapping results in a regular M1 hit.
---
&gt;-Survivors only drop orbs when injured so healing effects like Adrenaline are good counters
---
I wouldnt say adrenaline but maybe Self care and medkit. Also healing in a far corner of the map makes it unlikely for him to find the orbs.
---
&gt;Possibly Rancor and Dying Light if you are going to run obsession perks
---
Personally, rancor is okay, i suppose but again, its a bit of a waste on a one shot killer aint it? But you do you on your builds. This is just my opinion.
---
Hag also had a cypress and begrudgingly decided to let me go and I expressed many thanks
---
Are they aware of the getting stuck on gen after kicking it bug? You teleport to a random area of the map from the survivors pov and the only way to get off the gen is to hit a nearby survivor or have them work on the gen your stuck on and pull them off.
---
Let me find my comment I posted on other posts like this!
---
Yes! We need something about Anna and momma huntress
---
So, don‚Äôt tunnel. It‚Äôs as simple as that, why not use make your choice? DS is the one perk survivors bring to not get tunneled.
---
If Meg is on the hook and is experiencing the glitch and Jake comes to save her, if Jake only *starts* the unhook animation and cancels immediately (like trying to bait out a hit from the killer), *then* unhooks, Meg should return to normal and escape the glitch.
---
Woah wait whats this about??? Hooking in basement breaks the game?
---
I think people are also missing the INCREDIBLY broken combo that would exist by playing Oni and Plague. It would be fun but there are numerous reasons it wouldn't really work
---
Had an add on for my green
---
Weird flex, but ok boomer.
---
I usually use:
---
\- BBQ  
---
\- Ruin  
---
\- Pop  
---
\- Discordance   
---
But sometimes Sloppy and Nurse's are very fun as well!
---
It's in all versions, it's a bug
---
the issue is in the third page the start of the Killer branch starts with basement missions. You HAVE to do two basement missions before you can do any other killer missions...
---
So using a green didn't work, but dying with a red one did. I'm confused.
---
there's a chance the survivors camera messes up, like infinitely falling through the map, which leaves them practically blind even when they get unhooked.  
---
It seems there are a few ways for them to regain sight from what I've gathered here:  
---
1. If the killer maybe forgot the bug for a sec and now realizes the problem, they can pick up the survivor once they're unhooked and drop them of outside.  
---
2. As survivor you should tap the unhook button once (basically starting the unhook and not finishing) before going for the full unhook immediately after.  
---
3. If you're in a swf and your friend is dead: your friend can see you normally when watching you and can try to guide you out of the basement. You can also try to do it on your own, but oof, good luck with that.
---
[I think we all know what the best scene from The Final Chapter was...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocgj9tewHso)
---
If I didn‚Äôt know any better I would have called modded
---
Shit I'd take just the belly rub on its own tbh, that's a high tier perk on its own with just that one effect.
---
Because the game literally wasn't designed for SWF.
---
I love Huntress so much and I love this drawing
---
Thank fuck they don‚Äôt get closer I‚Äôd literally shit my pants.
---
They are doing more and more things that just benefit  survive with friends.
---
Then post it to r/peoplefuckingdying
---
What? Break someone's game? I don't get it
---
Is always the same story, you can't try new things when you are high rank, i got wreck'd when i started practicing clown and doctor, now i can handle myself better with them but the saltyness was there
---
So swf is toxic because the game wasn't designed around it? Not many team based games aren't at least partially designed around playing with friends.
---
Oh no you had a bug one game, better drop the game forever amirite
---
But you sound like no one wants you in their game anyway
---
I got NOLB and deja vu in the same blood web
---
I had this on a gen last night and couldn't get free, I didnt want to DC and ruin the game so I sat and waited for the last 2 survivors to complete the gens and escape.
---
To be fair instead of testing ALL changes on the PTB beforehand and fixing any bugs they might cause, they always just release new chapters with shitloads of bugs. Bugs that weren't present on the PTB because they made lots of changes that were never tested.
---
Interesting perk build, if you change ruin to pop, you can see on what Gen they are working an then rush there...hmm
---
Please do more with other killers i realy liked the myers one! ;)
---
 I will now if I ever forget!
---
Well I'll give tips on how to loop(run around) killers as that's really the only thing I'm good at as survivor. When looping stay close to the wall as the further you are the more easier it'll be for the killer to catch you, if a killer stops when you pass a pallet keep running as he just wasted time respecting it meaning you get another loop, if the killer just walks over the pallet that means he doesn't respect so you should play more aware and stuff.   Use the killers red stain to tell where they are, if a killers red stain is visible then you know where they are however if you don't see it be very cautious. For the shack area the pallet is very strong so save it. That's all I got that I could explain easily and that isn't complicated to understand.
---
hmm. sounds like a non-issue, it would have to be a situation where everyone is grouped up and on that same mission and they'd literally just released page 3 at the same time as this bug before it would be an issue.
---
Still no dedicated servers too! I guess they forgot that console exists
---
I can‚Äôt hear footsteps anymore.
---
**"...** **we are aiming to release a hotfix as soon as possible."**
---
I truely would like to believe that... But i've learned to not get my hopes up when BHVR says something like that!
---
&gt;"Is there a super FBI who checks on the FBI"
---
Well JFK tried doing that and look what happened to him
---
It's an argument because it's a pvp game which \*tries\* to be somewhat competitive. If it's not a cheat, bug, exploit, or unintended feature or mechanic in any way, why would I NOT use it? NOED has counterplay, by cleansing 5 totems before completing 5 gens (takes a miniscule amount of time), facecampers lose the game 100% of the time (your mistake here is not seeing the game as a 4v1. Facecampers kill 1 and lose the game because the other 3 do the objective. It sucks, but it's an asymmetrical horror game, that's kinda the point?), we have a lot of anti-tunneling perks like Decisive and Borrowed, and the same goes for the other side: decisive is countered by switching targets, adrenaline is countered by some powers and perks, borrowed is also countered by switching targets, etc. Sounds to me like you're not good enough and try to find excuses and shift the blame on the game or its players. Grow up.
---
I play on console with Oni. Played around 15 games with 13 4ks and two 3ks. As long as you are good enough, you can manage Oni. Besides his movement isn't that bad lol, just learn how to play him.
---
I wasn't keeping up with dbd news amd the oni had released yesterday I decided to play killer and found it weird that someone I put in the basement had disconnected I thought it was just someone quiting cause new killer but then I go on this subreddit only to find out there is a basement glitch I felt so bad after learning that it breaks your game.
---
He got stuck in the gen and couldn‚Äôt move until a survivor showed up so he could grab. It‚Äôs a bug right now. Thanks BHVR, you are flawless.
---
... He's eating her.
---
And he's going to eat me.
---
*OH MAH GAWWWWWWWW*
---
Or maybe you didn't outplay anyone, because in their mind set they were never competing against you and face camped purposely to waste time or loose rank or just out of boredom.
---
That would survivor scream while being mortied.
---
So what? People suck sometimes what else is new. At this point that's not even the games fault, it's just immature douchebags like in every other online game.
---
So he want add New perk what work like MoM but defend from one shot, isnt he? Its wierd
---
Same things happened to me for hours. Both survivors and killer is broken for some reason
---
Noob Play!
---
Shame on you!
---
That's what I'm thinking.
---
right!
---
Devs be like:  
---
"Remove flick entierly, lol"
---
I started as Bill :D.
---
Or maybe they don't suck at all, quite mature, have a good life but still do this because to them "it's just a game and as long as they are cheating, they entitled to have fun how they like. " People are not so simple, luv.
---
The no wiggle is fun having a killer chase you with a helpless Meg on their shoulders lol
---
Hol up buckaroo no positivity here as the rules in my handbook say you are only.allowed to screech at the devs and call people names for different opinions. Jokes aside glad you enjoy this sub
---
I think it only activates if the somebody is running the new perk?
---
As damn
---
i meant like... each individual hook could still break and it wouldn't really change how the basement works.
---
So it must be done as a show of power.
---
&gt;  Not to mention the amount of cheesy builds out there greatly outnumbers dbd with the amount of true combos and broken weapon arts
---
You leave my Iron Flesh + Warmth PVP build alone.
---
Ooh, Nemesis
---
I'm more saddened by the fact that OP literally ran right up to them and they apparently ignored the scratchmarks.
---
Footsteps have been bugged for me too!
---
Pardon my french but at what point is a person well adjusted and mature if their casual afternoon hobby is to be specifically mean to random people in a game? I didn't even say they suck I'm just of the opinion that you can enjoy the game any way you like as long as it has nothing to do with making people sad and angry on purpose.
---
For those who just reply with ‚Äúnerf‚Äù tell us why, i‚Äôm interested ü§î
---
What exactly is the scummy playstyle you're referring to that you shouldn't make use of despite being in the game?
---
Can confirm, had heard about this fix, experienced the glitch, and got my friend to do this method. For some reason the starting and then halting the rescue pulls your view back to normal.
---
I'm a killer main toxic is t baging flashlight spamming pointing and overall being toxic in the end game chat.
---
No looping is not toxic it's a tech that survivors developed to survive longer
---
But then what‚Äôs happens to the people who can‚Äôt buy/afford a new one? What about the people who do t want to switch their whole play style? Imagine going agai est a 4 party SWF, flashing m&amp;k and everything. Or a nurse that has a m&amp;k on consolide. I‚Äôm not ready to have to be practically forced to switch to m&amp;k, just because others are doing it.

That is my favorite part of the game, honestly an 11-10 experience
---
No what, imagine looping one of them and another one just waits for you on the other side
---
Pig needs a buff too
---
Give an option to disable crossplay and if u select it u cant use m&amp;k
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúdisorientate her‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to avoid basement because of that, or just letting survivors good they aren‚Äôt wiggling. I‚Äôm pretty much getting swept anyway while I‚Äôm still learning the ropes with Oni anyway so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a problem üòÖ
---
How long did it took you to make this meme??
---
20 seconds?
---
This subreddit is going to shit because of people like you
---
Some of them are pretty op but still good job
---
This is some loli fetish. degenerates
---
STBFL is up in the air rn for him. Before it use to be you gain stacks fast but lose them fast. Now it you gain stacks slowly but you lose them *Very* slowly. You can hit your obsession with FF and you don't lose stacks now, you only have to hit them normally once. It's subjective whether or not that was a buff of nerf but through Sloppy changes are a straight up nerf.
---
Its really easy to confuse her with your scratch marks. Since there is no collision with her, you can be more unpredictable and throw her off
---
Well that's ur problem as a killer main I get 3 gens done in the first 2 min if I don't use ruin.
---
Ps4
---
Spirit nerf: took away a single bullshit addon, adjust others and took off bump into people, how, HOW is this breaking her? You still can hit people just standing still, hear moans, this "nerf" barely touched the main problem, but it's something. Spirit is almost as strong as nurse, but ot's way easier to master.
---
Hate to break it to you but the excuse of "I might be an asshole online, but in reality I'm a nice guy" doesn't work. If you are only a shitty person in an environment where you're free of consequences and your victims fighting back, you are the worst kind of person, because then you're not only a garbage person in disguise you are also a coward, only acting up on people when you can hide your face.
---
Sorry if I used to word "you" a lot this is not meant to insult anyone directly, but I have no respect for anyone defending these kinds of people.
---
Gotta learn that moonwalk
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean the nerfs are minor and I can still 4K as her in purple/red ranks almost every game if you are a good spirit who can use their ears the changes barely affect your gameplay and honestly it‚Äôs kinda good coming out of phase now without the extended lunge because sometimes that would disorient you
---
yeah, idk about op but they are solid. you have to make big changes to utter useless perks for them to be viable, or they will always be overshadowed by what is good today.
---
No, she got all of us at least once. Myself twice. And killed two others with the rbts.
---
BHVR: "This bottom tier killer got something that actually made them playable? No no no we cant have that."
---
Little Jack - ASSHHHHH.... HOOLLLLLEEE
---
NO NO don't say that word you don't want to say that word!
---
Why not both ? Personnaly, i'm sick of losing ruin in 20 seconds, so i'm running corrupt + pop
---
I didnt play survivor in this patch yet, whats the problem with the basement?
---
So far in every company I have worked in people actually test that the code is actually functional, yeah. Obviously you can‚Äôt test everything, but it is a no brainer to go through the basic game mechanics in QA especially when this stuff keeps breaking.
---
Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt complain about yalls nerf after the balanced nerf
---
I realize that they have massive code debt with what appears to be a giant monolith of code with the leaks they're continually springing. And I agree that it's probably not the dev's wishes to release early. At some point, management has to figure what agile development means and if they can't get on board, they need to at least figure out how to estimate better, with more leniency for errors. BVHR is acting like a bunch of rank amateurs.
---
I usually if I take the basement hooks I just leave the players to do their own thing while I kick gens, etc...
---
I have avoided the basement hooks due to that reason alone. Sadly survs dont appreciate it.
---
That's fair. I played as him once last night to finally see what he was about and I had a blast, even got a 4k, but that was only one game.
---
It‚Äôs concerning to see how with every update the bugs that are introduced get progressively worse. Corrupted audio, stuck animations, inability to wiggle, the infamous basement bug. I really am wondering how this game is going to survive in the long run if this is going to continue being a constant with each patch.
---
Players are getting tired of experiencing the bug-filled mess that is this game in its current state. A future where the majority of the player base ends up leaving the game permanently is actually becoming feasible at this point. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs likely but it does not look as far fetched as it used to.
---
Just like the basement bug where a survivor infinitely falls, this game is falling down into a bottomless pit and it‚Äôs going to be almost impossible to get out of it if BHVR continues to go down the same path.
---
God damnit now it‚Äôs stuck in my head
---
Nice post
---
Autodidact changes your perception of altruistic acts as you're more motivated to get heals early on to stop slugging down the line and towards endgame.
---
Pharmacy allows you to get items for certain situations quicker so I like to prepare myself a bit of an arsenal when I need to be altruistic or focused on the objective.
---
Yes I am a hipster in regards to my perk choices but at least I'm honest about it.
---
Need legion till people stop playing him so I don‚Äôt have to go up against a killer than makes me hold M1 all game ffs
---
You can keep recycling the auric cells, meaning its a $10 entry fee for life with all other passes being free, if you use your cells for it. Then it's free cosmetics anr whatnot so totally worth it. Bought the pass day 1, currently tier 68.
---
THEY SHOULD ADD KRAMPUS
---
Oni is already op on console, i have played countless games at this point against oni and have not won a single game; he needs a nerf.
---
You know they do both, right? And there is also a mid chapter patch dedicated specifically to bug fixes and balance change. Every new patch people make this bad meme of "fix things instead of adding new stuff". 
---
Here, since you missed:
---
# BALANCE
---
* Protection Hits: The conditions for Protection Hits have been adjusted. To trigger a Protection Hit a Survivor must be within range of a "Survivor in Need" which translates to being close to an Injured Survivor. Players can now trigger Protection Hits each 3 seconds instead of each 20 seconds. Any hit received by a Survivor while the Killer is carrying another Survivor will count as a Protection Hit.
---

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6ggo6/you_guys_arent_going_to_fcking_believe_this_fall/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It‚Äôs a bug, after the killer kicks a gen on their screen they‚Äôre stuck inside the gen, but on survivors screens they leave. As soon as a survivor taps the gen the killer gets unstuck so on your screen it looks like they teleport back
---
I reported him
---
i mean, you‚Äôre dying for it, wasting time, not doing gens, which is a weak way to use it imo, ideally used to save a teammate say who is on their last hook. 
---
body blocking hooks is totally useless most of the time even if they escape because you don‚Äôt gain any pressure as a survivor on the killer while gens are needed to be done.
---
You can still basement hook and not be a dick. If you down the glitched basement survivor, pick them up and drop them outside the basement it fixes the glitch. I've been doing it to complete the basement archive challenge
---
There's a difference between being annoyed by a bug and threatening to quit the game because you encounter it in a single game.
---
I am just as annoyed about the basement bug as the next person, I hate it. But if that guy is so thin-skinned that a single bug makes him want to quit the game then he is just a clown and I don't wanna imagine how he's IRL
---
Nice whataboutism you got going there.
---
downvoted
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6ghn5/new_killer_leaked/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Technically you don‚Äôt fall under the map. What you see is just a VISUAL error that only that survivor sees. In actuality you‚Äôre standing there spinning around in the basement. If the killer downs you and picks you back up it is corrected. So basically it just makes you a useless sitting duck.
---
Well done :)
---
Apparently we seem to have different views on morale and that's fine, but I will not bother to explain further. If you need to vent frustration on people online instead of doing something like sports or physical work and you feel like living out negative emotions that way that's not okay for me. Just because you don't see them and don't meet them on a regular basis does not make them less of a person, maybe "they are not that simple".
---
That awful sound.
---
I can see that being the case. The higher-ups are pulling the strings and that trickles down so that the rest of the staff has to follow suit.
---
This game is blessed that there hasn‚Äôt been a decent competitor out there that has really challenged it. The games that had the potential to do that basically self-destructed. But if something good comes out the woodwork (like you said, Last Year *perhaps*) then DBD is going to start getting into real trouble.
---
Use empathy, any flashlight, rubber grip. Wait till the killer attacks someone and follow them. Try to be on the side the killer will be facing to pick them up. As soon as the killer is almost fully stood back up, use the flashlight on him. Boom. Survivor saved.
---
Baby yoda and spongboob haha funny
---
Quick note, don't bother trying to use the flashlight if the killer is already able to move. They literally just have to slightly tilt their heads up to avoid being blinded, which let's them still see where they are going, and drains your flashlight. If ya don't get the save immediately, ya probably aren't saving that survivor.
---
It isnt a nerf it was a much needed BALANCE. The only people that at this ‚Äúnerf‚Äù affects are the baby spirits that actually rely on the collision to get hits. The balance won‚Äôt affect those who are actually good with her because now she can beat you to a pallet/window/etc by simply passing through you. 
---
She is still top 3 with Freddy and Billy.
---
I remember seeing tumblr posts using this format many many years ago. I don't know where this sudden craze comes from though
---
If you play enough dbd its pretty much just a few more cosmetics for free. Cant see nothing wrong about that. Especially because you can buy the premium rift after finishing it and you will still get all the cosmetics and your "money" back. Wat i dont like are the challenges. Not gonna lie tho most of this challenges are bullshit. I play both sides for an example but some players dont and will struggle with many challenges. Some challenges require perks you prob dont got as a newer player.
---
I just run it because I love being chased
---
it is because of the dumb new survivor perk for sure.  it happens when the killer picks you within the range of 16 meter.
---
Ez waste of a pallet
---
I think the entire point was they were just slowing the game down a ton, but not really succeeding in killing anything. I‚Äôd had some bad Legion games that lasted roughly 20 minutes where I got 0 or 1 kills, and that‚Äôs only partly because of how bad I am at killer. it was also because I changed targets too much, and I couldn‚Äôt keep anything under control. this change made them slow the game down less, but made them better in the chase, and I think it‚Äôs actually a pretty good change. Legion could still use some buffs, but I think that this was a step in the right direction
---
I like the challenges though even the tougher ones. I always wanted challenges alongside the dailies. Things you can work towards for a bigger reward. Something like a monthly quest: Unhook 50 survivors =&gt; get 300k bloodpoints kinda deal
---
Except it makes no sense in most places it's used especially here.
---
True. I really enjoy the design but I had to turn my tv brightness all the way up. I'm sure itll be brightened soon or at mid chapter patch
---
I Wish :(
---
I was playing KYF and I basement hooked someone and they told me that their screen broke and that's how I discovered the glitch
---
Dang I'm gonna downvote cause of the nobody.
---
The new map is aids when your just now returnung to it after a break
---
Frenzy no longer procs on-hit perks, mending is faster
---
I know that most people here have less than 500 hours in the game, and tend to hold skewed opinions on it, but are the majority of people here also console players? Because otherwise I can't explain how the subreddit stance on Oni is that he's weak or underwhelming. Now, Oni does have a fairly weak early game that good survivors can definitely try to abuse, by playing it very safe and trying not to give him hits, thus denying him his ability. This is a weakness. But it's also his only real weakness. His ability is ridiculously strong and very fun to use and get better at using. Flicking people to death feels more satisfying than much of anything any other killer can do. It's scary to see what good players can do with Oni, leaving survivors little opportunity not to die within ten seconds of encountering him, being charged at from a distance and clubbed around corners.
---
I do agree that the collecting of blood orbs could have been a little more engaging, or at least have a cooler animation, and I also agree that his mechanics feel somewhat clunky, but the former is a minor complaint, and the latter is something that simply takes practice to get used to and master, at which point it won't feel clunky anymore. And like you say, it's also supposed to translate his weight and strength, which it does a fairly good job of. They definitely need to come through with that sensitivity thing they've been talking about for consoles though, to allow players to control Oni and lunges in general better. (That said, personally I am glad that Oni, seemingly being difficult to use on console, shows that BHVR is not limiting their design space completely by the mechanical constraints put on the game by the different non-PC platforms. I know this is not "nice" from a game dev perspective, but from the perspective of a player that wants mechanically demanding unburdened PC gameplay, I approve.)
---
His add-ons are uninspired, and add-on sets of releases and reworks have not been interesting since the Wraith rework (though Nurse's rework was a step up again), but the stat increases are definitely not too conservative. The charge and movement speed add-ons are on-par with Billy's, if not better, which makes them scarily good. Increasing Fury duration and decreasing Fury duration penalty is also scary, because of how game-decidingly explosive any Fury can be.
---
You guys are getting fps?
---
Do you want a sticker?
---
Read the patch notes, it's a known issue
---
[This](https://twitter.com/MCote_BHVR/status/1169585193306533888?s=09) gives me hope
---
Ngl oni is one of the coolest looking characters in my opinion
---
With Wraith?  Damn dude.  Teach me.
---
Why was this worth posting?
---
Yes let's delete legion
---
Playing against Freddy put me into the most surreal dream-state where I was falling forever. It's weird
---
I‚Äôve kept playing, but I stopped buying their DLCs and cosmetics. Haven‚Äôt bought the Stranger Things one or Cursed Legacy, nor have I bought the battle pass. But I can‚Äôt expect the majority to do the same.
---
It hurts but the truth is there is still a relatively healthy base of people who defend the dev team to no end and will keep supporting them with cosmetics, DLCs, plus the rift. BHVR has prioritized content over all mainly for this reason. They know that this gets people hyped and they are guaranteed to receive a good amount of income from it even if their game becomes more of a buggy mess in the process.
---
But there are also more folks calling them out on recent events. I don‚Äôt expect anything to change anytime soon, but long term? Maybe. Just maybe.
---
I'd pay top dollar for Pretty Lady Bubba. Throw us a bone BHVR.
---
Being frustrated does not make him toxic. As stated before, I feel the same frustration about the bug as it has ruined like five games I've been in so far.
---
There's also nothing toxic about venting said frustration in general, but the way he did is what makes it to me. 
---
Not only did he make it clear he encountered it like one time in total which makes his comment very hyperbolic, he also sounds very entitled (I know this word gets used way too much in this sub). It sounds like he expects BHVR to read his comment, be like "Oh no, not the reddit demigod "whateverhisnamewas", if he quits the game how are we gonna recover?! Lets get our shit together quick and then write him a personal apology" 
---
I get that you may still disagree, but I am very frustrated with such comments. And you are pro-venting your frustration and it's what I'm doing
---
Nice.
---
When will they release the hotfx sry for my bad english btw
---
This totally never happened to me...
---
Survivor bad
---
Killer good!
---
You killed a squad that had no interesting in doing gens and were trying to have fun instead by doing something else? Outstanding.
---
But how would you know?
---
Thats the challenges i would like to see i jsut dont enjoy challenges that make you have to change your gamestyle like that 1 challenge: hook 2 people at the basement at the same time. Honestly not a hard challenge to do but it "almost" requires camping to finish it.
---
Yeah but she went to the basement at every down, Madgrit iron grasp and agitation, Just straight for it even when we're across the fucking map
---
Just basement hook them on their 3rd hook ethically.
---
This is my exact GF build lol. And Demogorgon.
---
legion needs a rework, he‚Äôs not fun for killers or survivors
---
Make so that legion can actually disguise himself as a survivor and do what he did in the trailer
---
k.
---
have a good one üëçüèΩ
---
Solo players do use the perk. The amount of SWFs that use Object and actually communicate the killer's every position is vanishingly low. The amount of people that use Object at all is vanishingly low.
---
Object was already substantially nerfed with the introduction of the Undetectable status effect: killers can see the survivor while undetectable, whereas the survivor cannot see the killer. At most the survivor can use the perk icon to tell roughly in which direction the killer is.
---
Object is a very good perk, but it is also a perk not many players use and that comes with a unique set of drawbacks, or ways in which it changes gameplay. I would compare it to Play With Your Food, a perk that is also very good, yet not often used as it aslo has drawbacks that change the gameplay dynamic. I don't find these perks problematic, I think more of a problem is how few good perks there are to begin with, and so nerfing such already-niche perks into not being worth using at all anymore would be bad.
---
Not sure what your issue with Sole Survivor could be. It's a terrible perk. (Object + Sole Survivor is ridiculous against Freddy, however.)
---
Again, that's only your opinion. I hate going against Wraith even if he is weak af and I don't want him to be nerfed into the ground because I consider him boring.
---
Somehow janes ass looks extra thicc because of claudettes hat
---
I would agree with you if at red rank you were reset back to rank 10 again but with this new dlc came a new deranking system. You're going to be set back to rank 5 to 8 again so you're still gonna have an impossible time trying to get adept now. You're only reset to the last color badge on the rank system on the 13th now.
---
I can only imagine the end game chat.
---
Same thing happened to me when I was playing, my mouse controls got inverted and I couldn‚Äôt switch them back
---
You so get points when they DC. You get Rage Quit points not just their calls thatüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My comment clearly wasn‚Äôt that serious about nerfing him.
---
Go for a walk outside or something.
---
I did the same when I had a challenge for hooking people in the basement. I even played Trapper specifically because he's good at getting people onto the basement hooks. I did it pre-patch tho
---
I think the wiggle still works, the progress bar and animation just dont display. When I got hooked by trapper I saw my progress bar was almost halfway
---
Should have said that from the start then bumpkin
---
From what I've seen, "useable" doesn't extend passed the purple ranks. Which sucks because he's fine on PC.

Learn sarcasm nerd
---
Yeah I noticed that too it's kind of a harsh issue.
---
Its fine. Im actually depipping from red ranks switching from legion to nurse (legion main). It took a while for me to accept that "No, im not yet a god like ScottJund, Otz, Scorpioniz, Zubat etc...". I want to learn to play without genslowdown perks and also Nurse. Theres is actually no shame in losing. I want to reach red ranks without even trying like the real top tier players. Not sweaty like Tru3 that just piles on genslowdown or play nasty with tunnel/camp. Until then i'll take whatever rank im placed
---
Which is annoying because without it he's pretty bad. All you have to do is run to a basic loop and you deny his entire power.
---
Not to mention that the new map is really dark, so seeing a survivor hiding in some bamboo is now just impossible.
---
Found the rank 20. He already got nerfed. You just need to git gud and stop being a potato.
---
If you were being sarcastic then you wouldn't bother to defend your sarcasm now would you
---
Yeah she's doing it after patch, I messaged her later asking why and she called me an entitled survivor wanting to win games and that I should learn to wiggle more
---
Do you have any friends
---
GG
---
Y‚Äôall being everyone who complains
---
What glitch?
---
Finally, a use for this! https://youtu.be/O-MQC_G9jTU
---
I played against like 5 basement builds yesterday. Chances are they knew about the bug.
---
Lmao, not a rank 20; im a rank 9
---
To accentuate the weirdness of something described next. Because supposedly usually nobody does what is described in the meme.
---
I've actually Mori'd someone right as they escaped and it legit changed their escape into death
---
No, but without cross progression switching to PC is stupid.

Every match is gg
---
Joey's mixtapes got nerfed and now has a completely different use along with other add-ons that would decrease cooldown.
---
Just saw a great bio for Chris walker from outlast so now I want him
---
The console validation and release processes slow everything down, it's a huge bottleneck and prevents them from throwing hotfixes here and there
---
&gt; that I should learn to wiggle more
---
You know what to do with that big fat butt...
---
it can be a 2 v 4

Happened to me yesterday being put on a hook

Wiggle wiggle wiggle

Yeah this happened to me when I got hooked. IDK what it is, but that‚Äôs the last time I play meg.,,

Can‚Äôt you change it in settings
---
This is true for things you can do that you're not suppose to be able to do, that's exploiting a bug. However, in this case playing the game normally and hooking someone in the best place to hook them isn't exploiting because you are able to do it with or without the bug being there. If it's game breaking devs should hot fix it right away.
---
Unpopular opinion: oni is broken and should get a nerf
---
I get a solid 50fps at least every game on ps4
---
She escaped the mortal plane
---
Yeah this happened endlessly until the game itself ended for me
---
In the end it's a preference usually I will throw one if left under hooked guy refill and if I notice someone with chilly go in that direction.., doing it before hooking up seems time wastefull for me since you give them time to setup for flashlight save, downed guy to fill his bar or move to opet position-pallet . . ., but to each his own :)
---
Theres a jump from using perks that aren't considered meta and going by a play style that requires just standing still and doing nothing, as well as ruining the experience for all survivors as one doesnt get a chance to play the game at all and the other 3 are just forced to rush out gens.
---
And yeah, I've seen you say that they are learning, but that defeats your entire argument that "people might find facecamping fun I'm not to judge". There are still people with hundreds of hours who still facecamp who dont care about the bloodpoints or winning and are literally doing it for the sole reason of being an asshole and think its funny to see survivors rage.
---
Didnt you just complain about balanced landing?
---
Why does Spirit look like lelo from lelo and stitch?
---
This would make Legion actually useful
---
It‚Äôs the Equivalent of all the dumb sh*t OchiDo abused in the past.
---
Killer Mains like me have to be better than that. Do not abuse it it‚Äôs seriously dumb
---
My point is that it isn‚Äôt one single bug, it‚Äôs another bug in a long list of bugs going back months. One bug in one match isn‚Äôt a big deal, but one bug in one match day after day is the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back.
---
Stunning the killer forces them to drop any survivor they're carrying. Pallet drops, flashlight blinds, and Head On all cause stuns. Head On is a survivor perk that stuns a killer if you sprint out of a locker when the killer is close enough (after you have been waiting in the locker for a few seconds)
---
Sorry for the toxic self unhook :(
---
I will never even understand why trapper sets off his own traps anyway. I could understand if he was OP, or if he could only get trapped when people sabotage his traps, but him being able to do it on traps he sets himself with the state he's in right now is just sad
---
What was the sloppy butcher bug?
---
Huh. Weird. I was setting up to try and farm with these survivors but as you can see, it didnt end up working out
---
New tec guys it's not the CJ tec but the Feng tec
---
Which low/mid tier killers have been nerfed?
---
I was playing killer and some people got super mad at me I didint really know what was happening and haven‚Äôt played enough survivor to know what‚Äôs up but it seems like they really broke the game.
---
I got hooked in the basement then I was in the void, I got unhooked then was just falling forever and couldn't do anything but to everyone else.i was normal and just crawling around,the killer got the most bullshit 4k in the world
---
How this shit doesn't get caught during testing is entirely beyond me. Incompetent idiots.
---
The "nobody" meme started as a joke when people do something dramatic without anyone asking. Like joking about vegetarians having to tell everyone without anyone asking, people who do Crossfit, etc. Now it's just slapped onto every meme without making sense
---
Legion got its basic attack nerf that was pretty unnecessary considering they were already weak, and pig got a few nerfs awhile back
---
I wanted to try and farm to get the "trap 5 survivors in one match" challenge. I did the 4 traps one legit, and the 2 traps one legit, and I'm sick of playing a killer I dont enjoy playing, so I just wanted to get it over with
---
The basement bug wasn‚Äôt in the PTB AFAIK, so something got messed up between the end of PTB and the release. I don‚Äôt know how at this stage, a bug this significant just slips through like this.
---
I really hate how easy it is to hide on the yamaoka maps
---
He‚Äôs not fast anymore lol. He jogs
---
OOOOOOHHHHH  
---
a couple days ago, a guy thanked me for not using the basement, I just thought he meant the Basement Hag Build was broken AF.  lol
---
Exploits are taking advantage of things that you normally can't do. You have always been able to and will always be able to hook people in the basement. This is a bug that they should immediately hot fix not a bannable exploit.
---
Dude, this is so wholesome. I'm glad Dead by Daylight will have future players to keep it alive. Keep it up, my guy.
---
Exactly what happened to me. Apparently if you place traps too close to each other theres some bug that detects the other traps and teleports them to you when you set one off, thereby causing this. Someone else in the comments mentioned this
---
No we don't. 2v8 in identity v is absolutely broken and quite unbalanceable.
---
Check my other comments
---
He only has mov speed add-ons
---
I was playing freddy on badham preschool, the hatch was at the middle of the street and me and the last survivor were positioned in oposite sides, while we were both rinning to the hatch he stepped on one of my traps, so i managed to close it just as he got to it. He soon after disconected.
---
And i already said I agree with potential frustration over several buggy releases we had to endure and if you phrase it like that you wont find me disagree with you at all.
---
Now leave me alone keyboard warrior I am not the BHVR apologist you're looking for
---
Forever Freddy is much more cancerous to play against yet they leave him alone.
---
I really hate it when games and youtube videos do this. Half of the time I can't even figure out what they tried to translate.
---
Spirit was never at the top even after the nurse nerf she is still broken in the right hands
---
You ssid you agree. He will see that I commented on his post, and therefore this notifies both of you.
---
I like 4 and 5, as well.
---
Had no idea about the med kit charges.. I was wondering how I ran extra charges on an emergency med kit and it depleted after I healed another survivor for 1 state. I was confused as hell and thought you guys nerfed medkits
---
You can, but even max sensitivity isn‚Äôt good enough really
---
I was Freddy last night in Red Forest. Basement was in the middle at the log house. The survivors were running around the outside and inside of the house trying to keep me busy, one gen left. One of them makes an error, I put him on the ground. Closest hook is basement. I know the other 3 are still around so I use basement and snare it to keep pressure on the building. I'm checking the gen on the deck upstairs, I'm listening for repair sounds or anyone running or dropping down. Snares go off, I head to the basement. 2 Quinten are waiting for me. I'm slightly creeped out and ready for them to bait me for the hook save. 
---
No, no. One runs and the other takes a hit. He doesn't move. I circle around, looking for the other Quint, I don't see him. I turn back and the other is still standing there. I drop him, I look up the stairs, I check my inbox... Are they farming? Why the change in play? Nothing. I go back down and hook him. There's now 1 more survivor. I gen-hop and find that guy nearby, away from the house. I hook him. 
---
End game chat confirmed that the Quinten standing in the basement had a glitch happen where he was "falling" but described it as trippy while in Freddy's dream state. I felt bad but he was really cool about it, said he's been playing it for over 2k hours so it takes a lot to upset him.
---
I saw nothing on my screen that looked weird.
---
And that's the first I knew about this. 
---
I guess its similar to the end game timer where it took until almost the patch release for me to experience it myself. 
---
This needs to be patched soon. Like, today.
---
That doesn‚Äôt do much, literally hardly has an effect. Bet the even broke hooks straight away
---
hasnt stopped BHVR before
---
It‚Äôs just a really smol hatch and she had the really smol key for it
---
Yeah, check my other comments. I wanted to farm, this is true, I actually stepped into the first trap to try and communicate to the survivors that I wasnt chasing them and wanted them to also walk in my traps.
---
How would he Mori you if you ran him for five gens?
---
That happened yesterday a couple times against Oni. The second time it happened, the bar flickered visible and not.
---
It was a visual bug on Wraith where blood was constantly spilling out of him and it made survivors dc on hit.
---
It was horrible.
---
Yes. This is the nature of bugs. They come out of no where and are a pain in the ass to track down.
---
GG ez noob killer uninstall
---
No, we do.
---
Ah that‚Äôs why the guy DC , came to check why people we‚Äôre dcing when I tried doing the basement challenge. I apologize to anyone who DC because of me knowing
---
How is this a shitpost
---
i doubt anyone at this point doesnt know the basement bug, so i report any killer that takes me to the basement just in case. it is a real serious exploit if they know what they are doing
---
People who don't celebrate Christmas:
---
"Quick, cleanse the totem"
---
whisper said it best but my main concern was allowing a surv to go freely and instead of rescuing first they get my hex all cause I was being nice. Though it's not my fault if they cant sneak past a killer/dont lead me away from the hooked victim.
---
Pig main, I basically agree with everything here
---
I played survivor only last night, had three games where someone got hooked in the basement and bugged out.  The last game it was me.  In all three games the killer was unaware of the bug, and one of them was pretty horrified that that‚Äôd happened, despite having a bad game.  All three said something to the effect of not using the basement after.
---
This all came after we calmly explained the bug (I was solo all night so it wasn‚Äôt that we all agreed to explain it calmly.). I would assume coming in hot assuming the killer knew about it would get a very different response.  A little benefit of the doubt, especially when the game news reel mentions nothing about the bug, goes a long way.
---
It just sound so wrong to see the translation
---
I only put people in basement for the archive challenge then stopped. I don't really like getting a free win, like what skill am i showing for exploiting the game to win.
---
Pretty sure this means you won‚Äôt be able to strafe with him in demon dash anymore and he‚Äôll be more like billy. So you won‚Äôt be able to go more tightly around corners.
---
That is not a regular scenario though, that is a tournament. Even if he is inferior in a loop, loops aren't everything. And even if she is superior to Billy, she is not superior to Freddy.
---
Just had a killer place everyone down in the basement one at a time. Then messaged us and told us to get gud cause we couldn't escape the basement because 2 of us couldn't see anything
---
The basic attack thing is pretty unnecessary (or rather, the perks it applies to are unnecessarily limited to basic attacks), but it's also not a nerf that matters very much, I don't think, as Butcher and STBFL were not very good perks on Legion to begin with in my opinion (and in the case of STBFL, it can now be used on Legion similarly to how it can be on other killers, which is not losing tokens when hitting the Obsession with your ability). And on the other hand, Legion has received a few nice buffs. The same can be said for Pig too, who has received more buffs than nerfs. The twitch streamer "Scorpionz" is a die-hard Pig main and likely one of the best Pig players out there, and he is also adamant about the fact that Pig has gotten better with the changes, overall, not worse.
---
That said, I do think these two killers and a variety of other low/mid-tier killers could all do with more substantial buffs. But I don't really see that they are all being nerfed either, by much of any stretch...
---
The drawing is cute, is it yours?
---
I‚Äôd say in his current state after patch he‚Äôs still uncounterable but good players can last slightly longer but in 1v1 aspect for survivors this is unfun. I do think they should‚Äôve removed the pallet break bug but that‚Äôs cos it acc was a bug.
---
I thought that would happen to me, but eventually it randomly stopped. I usually farm with two survivors and kill one just before the end if the game ends to quickly or someone DCs. I would have been upset if I couldn‚Äôt betray their trust.
---
You are making me wet. And I‚Äôm a straight male. What a good dad
---
I agree
---
U don't play consoleüòü
---
I pardon the basement Bubbas. It's their only trick.
---
Oh sick, good to know
---
Demogorgon can‚Äôt turn, he can...
---
I got close to rank 2 but lost all my pips on 3 :(
---
Instead the killer notice I was in my bug and struck me again and placed my back on the bugged hook in several games.
---
I'm not complaining, if the biggest topics right now are talking about the issues of the patch, whether or not in meme form, it is sparking discussion with the problems players have right now. Whether it be Oni difficulty on console, Legion changes, the basement/wiggle bugs, and so on.
---
Better than seeing the same spam of shitposts like we always do. Which kudos to the devs for snipping that shitty Patrick one early on before it swarmed the front page.

Gg wp. You are a work in proggress but you will get there! I believe in you!
---
nice thanks
---
I actually have a friend who has been tier 70 for a week now and I saw a killer 2 weeks ago that had the vial charm already and was like "somebody bought somw levels"
---
Could have been doing that one tome challenge.
---
I want the winter music back and have it as my main since it brings back memories
---
It's just not a good thing to do, If you played both sides you'll know the pain of getting hooked in the basement
---
Oh? I play Xbox. I believe that's a console lol
---
A full swf yelled at me for hooking in basement without having a clue about the bug xD
---
Same here,  and looks like the survivors cant see you,  but you are still able to injure them,  happened to me on tuesday
---
C H O N K Face
---
A reenactment of "CLAUDETTE'S 8TH BIRTHDAY"
---
Its 500ish points instead of what i was supposed to get from killing them on hook.
---
This happens every time there's a glitch like that on both sides. It's why it gets so frustrating that they aren't fixed faster sometimes (I know there's limits to how quickly they can fix things, but some things get patched REALLY slowly) because they are just exploited into the ground.
---
Can we get a fix for the medkit add ons? My 44 charge brown medkit gave me one heal, that's it!
---
Well as much as it may have not hurt builds that don‚Äôt use it, it was still a bit silly to add anyway, if it wasn‚Äôt broken why try and fix it? Just felt like a weird thing to take out of legions already weak kit, they made mending useless too, it was a frustrating mechanic anyway but legion would do better with a rework of some sort. And nah the drawing was found on some old insta site that saved all the stuff posted on insta gram the page and the page it linked to were all dead and deleted, i dug for 30+ minutes trying to find who made it but no luck, if somebody does know the artist it would be nice to see more of their work~
---
Lots of assholes in these comments. Yikes.
---
I got the glitch yesterday as well, I got unhooked and healed up by someone, then I tried running around and spinning. All that time, all I could see was Bill endlessly falling in the clouds under a sky full of stars. 
---
The one time I was wishing for a tunnely killer, we got an Oni who hooked and then left to look for other people...
---
Haven't played since the update. What's going on? Seen a lot of shit about basement being fucked but what about it is actually fucked?
---
Use iridescent family crest and make them scream constantly.
---
Careful. They are heroes
---
I've played a lot of Oni since he's came out on console but i have only seen 3 Onis as a survivor. i know he is hard but like come on please don't let this be another demi issue where he's good but barely anyone plays him.
---
Is anyone able to get mid to high ranked matches since word spread of the bug? All I was able to get was babysitting matches with basement build killers. I'm out till a fix is made.
---
Its a lag switcher.
---
It would be so hilarious but we would all be bodyblocked to hell
---
"gg ez apply pressure"
---
Not perfect balance, but at least fairness. I'd like to enjoy the game's atmosphere. Offerings shouldn't be necessary to make up for poor designs.
---
I actually like a challenge. I thrive under pressure. Killers who abuse that glitch are pathetic, simple as that.
---
Because they dont have a system to let you know that they taken action against someone you reported?
---
I dont need to see that nope nope
---
;-)
---
It is a console pc, laptop and switch are the ones that aren't console I play pc
---
he has to be mad
---
dude his fucking feet thumps are what gets me. BAM BAM BAM
---
When survivors get hooked in the basement after this recent update. Two of the hooks basically send the survivor into the shadowrealm. Basically there screen is completely blacked out and even if they don't struggle they will continue to struggle and after getting unhook the issue persists unless the killer picks you up again or you leave the basement then jump back down into it (this doesn't always work)
---
The stealth is her biggest issue, isnt it? Head pops actually hurt the killer more than the survivor, so mucking about with RBT's would make her dangerously close to Plague-level bad (does well in match, 4k/12 hooks/exit unpowered, ENTITY DISPLEASED.)
---
Ambush/stealth changes I agree with. I love the Pig, she's my favourite killer at the moment, but right now you almost have to run m&amp;a on a STEALTH KILLER WHAT THE HELL IS THIS. I never even use her ambush on shorter loops, it almost never works. Way more reliable to bloodlust it, stupid as it sounds, because ambush attack's even more of a guessing game than playing against a spirit.
---
And people can get a hatch escape with an activated RBT? What the hell, that isn't fair. That's even worse than a regular hatch escape, especially if it was a key.
---
Sounds like the sound that every ‚Äúbest horror film of the year‚Äù uses for their trailers
---
Wait isn't that the sex offender shuffle?
---
Create a bright setting on your TV? That's what I did
---
The night the patch went up, I had a game where I hooked 3 people down there repeatedly. They explained there was a bug after the game. Im sure there will be many who dont know about it, but I've been skipping over basement hooks since.
---
She is lost to the void, nothing phases you after you are swallowed whole.
---
Upvoted - I agree Pig needs some QOL changes. Particularly her crouch speed + box RNG. 
---
Since the current stealth killers have a trade off for being in stealth (Myers is slow, Wraith has to uncloack before hitting a survivor, GF needs to fill his power gauge) I think her crouch speed shouldn't be 115% but definitely at least 100%. 
---
The current box RNG is garbage, I'd much prefer increased probability per box and reworking some addons to affect the % to get it on the first/second try.
---
I was expecting the "carriage fall" meme of Skyrim in the End.
---
Huntress mains applause you
---
I guess she's gonna head out.
---
Donnie darko shit
---
It started as memes about vegans and crossfit people talking about their shit unprovoked and it was decently funny and made sense. Now it‚Äôs something to tack on a meme to... make it worse? Make me want to punch OP in the face? I don‚Äôt actually know.
---
No joke they need to fix auto-aim on console, desperately. The number of times I've swung for a survivor and felt my aim vacuumed off to nowhere because it can't figure out where they are when they spin a bit at the right time is COUNTLESS.
---
Either remove it completely and raise turn speed so your hits land where you aim them, or make Auto-aim strong enough to counter the borderline 0 degree turn speed people have on an analog controller. I get it isn't really an "exploit" per se but 360/180 jukes at high level are absolutely filthy with how much baiting you have to do to land a hit.
---
As a guy who use gamepad for PC I'll tell you that M&amp;KB doesn't always have an advantage. For example, I'm much more comfortable playing survivor with gamepad.
---
Huntress experiences puberty for the first time
---
1, 2, 3, 4, H20, &amp; 2018 all have their merits, I think. Even the first Rob Zombie film was decent when it got past Michael‚Äôs backstory and moved into being a shot-for-shot remake. 
---
Honestly, I only think 6, Resurrection, &amp; Rob Zombie‚Äôs Halloween II are truly terrible. The rest are at worst fun and at best amazing.
---
I'm out of the loop, what's this?
---
it looks like you‚Äôre writing on a chalkboard
---
Don‚Äôt worry, friend; we have Demodoggo to cheer us up.
---
Step 1: CENTER him in the middle of your screen (he was crooked)
---
Step 2: DONT stand out in the open where he‚Äôll probably finish stalking you before you finish revealing him anyway 
---
Step 3: He‚Äôs pissed now run!
---
Yep happened to me today too
---
&gt; Or even Mangled
---
Did something change since they added Mangled to Sloppy? I remember a lot of people thinking Sloppy would be great when that buff was revealed, has it been needed since then?
---
I was going to point out that Switch is a console but my actual response is What the shit are you even saying
---
How do you bind it to q and e?
---
Me lmao
---
Grow some hair maybe?
---
Having to perfectly look at the killer in the middle of your screen is not good and consistent counter play if you ask me.
---
I'm scared to hit gens now too, there is a chance you can get stuck in them
---

I‚Äôve been playing nothing but killer with a basement build every game to get the basement challenges done there‚Äôs a glitch?
---
No turning addons, but he has Demon Dash speed addons!
---
Also, happy cake day!
---
But why would you even have to? If you're fine with playing controller, it's not like things will change for you personally in DbD if M&amp;KB support is included, there is no aim vs. aim type of competition in DbD. Some killers might definitely be more viable, but type of controller in DbD doesn't really change the counterplay that much apart from the fact that 360s are easier with a gamepad.
---
I mean, Spies in the Shadows can be good..until it gets grating from JUST HOW MANY FUCKING CROWS GO OFF.
---
on console too? i didnt see it in my inventory
---
Ex? EX?!            
---
#EX?!?!?!?
---
depends if you really wanna wait that long i guess.
---
 id say dont wait, but this is the 3rd time ive installed recently. second on pc, (first time barely put any into it)
---
Yeah I have iy
---
I don't understand it either. I would love to see good Nurses of Huntresses on PS4.
---
i def ship this
---
I feel like I can speak on this from a place of some authority, I'm not a game developer, but I am a software developer, and this shit is absolutely fucking crazy to me.
---
I mean, I introduce bugs in code, bugs that get past QA, it happens to everyone. But if a bug slips through and QA comes back after release and describes it to me, 99% of the time I know instantly where to look and within probably a couple hours I know what the issue is.
---
I mean...I fucking *made* the changes. I should know what could have possibly went wrong. If I worked in a specific place in the code that involved the bug I would know it. I really don't even understand how you get in their situation.
---
Like they added new characters and perks, and that's a big thing I get that, but the bugs should pertain to anything specifically revolving around those two characters. Why are they so interconnected to irrelevant parts of code? Or are people just checking in random changes that have nothing to do with the release so they don't get tested and slip through?
---
Why would wiggling all of a sudden stop working? Why would med kit addons stop working? Why would people all of a sudden fall out of the map? I mean these are things that you would think have nothing to do with what was changed in this build, and if they did pertain to things changed in the build, it should be easy to isolate and find what the problem is because they should be very specific and isolated parts of code.
---
I don't  understand how hot fixes can take multiple days. It's not like a bug from a year ago cropped up, this is shit that was from the most recent build it should be easy as fuck to find what changes caused the issue...man this shit is fuckin crazy.
---
i had a weird bug happen in the ptb when spectating that i saw them move to watch the kate as she walked past them, honestly way more terrifying than the weeping angles thing they do.
---
I know its not good, hence why i don't do it unless the archives requires it. I payed for the archives im not going to stop doing it, bugged or not.
---
i like using sloppy, nurses, bbq and surveillance
---
But he've already got one O.o

Personally, I felt I got my money's worth after making it about half-way through. By that time you will have unlocked the nurse's blighted costume and enough serum to unlock another (as well as the Wraith's sweet new weapon). But I also want to get the maximum value out of it. Currently at tier 60, and I can't accomplish some of the survivor challenges, even if my life depended on it (trying for days, and even if the killer is willing to farm, the exact situation I need at the time never happens, or is prevented).
---
Overall, for me it's been worth it, I expect that with the arrival of level 4, I will easily get to tier 70 at my current pace.
---
Had a game where they wanted to sabo all my hooks so I said fuck it and hooked them in the basement! Ggez
---
I am probably with my friend on this picture . Did one are names NitrosTropy and Barakus6?
---
Excuse me what, Xbox, PS4 and switch are all considered console
---
You will never be able to have acsess on your ps4 dbd profile from your pc. Thats just not posible. Crosplay is one thing but your are talking about beeing able to share gamefiles of complety differnt systems. They files arent programed for that and cant function that way.
---
You don't need a flashlight save. You just have to blind the killer when he's carrying a survivor, i can confirm.
---
No, they don't. DBD, for its entire existence, has been a game of bugs that have no reason to exist getting pushed to live.
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
I think the reason they "fixed" it is because they've been harmonizing what counts as a basic attack and what doesn't, throughout recent months. What their goal with that is and whether their approach is not sometimes questionable is another thing, but like I said, more than the killer specifics, I think these perks themselves should just not care about whether it's a "basic" or ability hit. I. e. Sloppy Butcher and Franklin's Demise and maybe even Save The Best For Last should apply no matter whether the killer hits a survivor with their primary weapon or their ability. They used to. Hell, they could even apply to bear traps.
---
Mending is about just as useful (or useless) as it was before the change - it's now what, 4 seconds less per mend? The stalling potential of mending was low before and still is now. Legion's ability is primarily about injuring survivors with ease, to do half a chase's work for them. But yes, maybe more than just more number adjustments (such as reducing Frenzy fatigue duration...), Legion could do with a larger rework of sorts. The main leverage point for that I think is the Deep Wound status effect itself, and what it does to survivors. In its current state, its only real purpose is injuring survivors and wasting a bit of their time. But maybe it could be more, maybe a dynamic could be introduced where survivors have to manage to mend their wounds mid-chase, or maybe the status effect comes with other afflictions that render survivors unable to fast-vault, or make them have to complete skill checks during chase interactions, stumbling if they fail to succeed them.

Is there a way to deactivate his power once used besides picking someone up?
---
No mither + object of obsession cause i want to do?
---
Please, sometimes I just want to stab folks, give us a very stabby Legion. Like when they first came out you could commit to one guy and stab him down. It was cool!
---
I greatly agree with you. I feel rotten field is only a problem though because of how massive it is, if it was just scaled down  as many killers usually have to spend awhile running across the map to a generator, or instead of scaling it down just have some areas with corn batches cut down to make it easier to see.
---
quality post
---
See, that's not your fault.
---
They probably just don‚Äôt know how to fix it, like the rest of their shit game breaking bugs.
---
Is its just transparent? Or how does it work
---
Poor clown
---
 are you saying that cross progression can't be realised on dead by daylight?

This guy knew. He had a stupid challenge and said he didn't care about being reported.

oh boy he's going to play a few game of ebony iri heads huntress to calm himself down after that..
---
Well done little stalker
---
Oddly no mither, and resilience and this is not happening. I don't know why but I just preform better with them, maybe because I'm more alert and cautious? idk
---
This needs to be upvoted more so people playing solo can help each other out.
---
Yeah I meant that it is way harder to get a merciless victory and thus the Achievement on red ranks. Kind of stupid because it is nearly impossible for Killers on red ranks and Survivors only need to escape. Survivors should have to double pip too to make it even (or 4k as Killer).
---
downed and hooked after last gen
---
Crossplay will be possible but no profilshareing or tradeing on multiple Plattforms.
---
Skill checks could be interesting during chase, also i know its a difficult concept to try and figure out but as many have said legion is a group, and they only play 1 at a time, it would be nice if they had some sort of patrolling, or grouping up they could do. It would be hard to do correctly though, I‚Äôve heard ideas like? Having them walk around the map and you can switch to them every x seconds, or have them guarding certain loops, pallets, or gens. If done correctly it could be a really cool concept, and make legion an actual legion instead of 1 stabby boi/girl who is an M1 killer
---
Land of people with friends lol
---
Classic "Muh survivors bad", Not like killers werent abusing: Sloppy butcher wraith, Double blades Legion, Tinkerer 2 and the current basement glitch.
---
pretty good job so far
---
The only issue that makes a lick of sense in that context is the wiggling where the new perk (breakout) could possibly be an issue
---
Wait you can mess up someone‚Äôs game by hooking them in the basement?
---
Yes that's right 
---
but when we create a custom perk. we modify the icon but we do not change the background because we can not change it that's why I made a transparent Perk so that we can see the initial color
---
if u hit an injured survivor during feral frenzy the survivor becomes healty and u are stuned for 25 seconds
---
one time while running to the pallet, I turned around to look at a Plague right before dropping a pallet and I got rekt because I suddenly turned around 180 degrees, dropping down the pallet while running straight at her.
---
I ended up dying that game due to not finding the hatch after a few minutes of being chased.
---
They should just give Legion an entire extra power; have Feral Frenzy be his sub-ability to apply debuffs and track people like Doc, and then give him a Primary Power that isn't total cancer for either side that rounds him out.
---
I mean there's so many things they could do for that. Pose as Survivor for stealth to get close unnoticed. He could gain extra strength the more people are bleeding. He could gain some sort of ability when chasing someone with Deep Wounds. And yes, a power that has you controlling multiple bodies in one trial.
---
Legion had so much potential and it was completely wasted on a clusterfuck of a power that's either completely broken or useless or BOTH at the same time against all conventions of logic. Anti-Healing Legion is fucking obnoxious but it's pretty much the only build he can use effectively, and that just got shit on too with Sloppy Butcher no longer applying on Feral Frenzy hits.
---
Legion needs his power completely reworked.
---
The only fixes they need :)
---
Oh okay. I thought they actually turned and followed you, like as I was running by them I would keep my screen focused on them.
---
&gt; Yes. This is the nature of bugs. They come out of no where and are a pain in the ass to track down.
---
I can understand weird niche interactions slipping through. Stuff like the basement bug or medkit charges getting through even rudimentary playtesting is pathetic.
---
Double flick is the bug not the regular flick.
---
On pc i‚Äôve seen killers nod SUPER fast and it‚Äôs the funniest shit. I faced a huntress that would only furiously nod after she landed a hatchet. I love this game sometimes
---
BHVR meeting
---
"Okay the community is onto us nerfing Pig every step of the way."
---
"How about Legion then?"
---
"PERFECT."
---
My issue is more "Legion didn't have many perks that worked with them to begin with because of how FF works." Pallet breaking? Doesn't work with FF. Exposed Status Perks? Doesn't apply to FF (for good reason). Anti-healing perks? Why heal when you'll get re-injured with FF? Tracking Perks? Half of them don't work on FF!
---
Watching the dev's play back in the old halloween event was the single most cringe thing I've ever watched. Full on rank 20.
---
Out of all the teammates to be helping, they were Claudettes. That‚Äôs unusual, but amazing haha
---
Why's Freddy so appealing all of a sudden?
---
I play a lot and completed most of the challenges (all of levels 1 and 2, most of level 3) and managed to get to level 70 last week without buying any extra levels. I think it‚Äôs worth it since you get your money back in auric cells and the challenges are mostly doable, although I‚Äôm hoping they re-work level 4 like they did with 3. 
---
I will say that I think if you‚Äôre a more casual player and not a no-lifer, it‚Äôs still doable but you have to prioritise getting the challenges done and the devs need to make sure that most of the challenges are accessible to everyone, not just the veteran players.
---
Also deep wounds is paused while you sprint.
---
I've been playing killer more recently and it's safe to say if I see anyone urban and evasion isn't around the map not being productive or see someone farming someone else... lets just say...
---
Cowabunga it is!
---
Cross save requires millions of dollars, and I don‚Äôt think BHVR are looking to spend that right now on a bit of a dying game
---
That‚Äôs the start to the basement glitch, if you can‚Äôt wiggle and you get Hooked in the basement you‚Äôre going to the shadow realm
---
Sure, Kill them if you dont like them. Just dont abuse exploits to force someone to disconnect.    
---
(Not like its really farming if you have borrowed time and take a hit, Just dont do that against Bubba/Billy/Huntress.)
---
yes, abusing a glitch is on the same level of scummyness to a coordinated team
---
I had a game yesterday where a survivor got hooked but was not considered hooked.
---
could not be unhooked, could not do anything and did not bleed out.
---
Don't think it was  basement hook though
---
**The swarm protects**
---
Yeah suppose it could be like a baton system
---
That passes on proximity though have to do it carefully so survivors dont run between borders and abuse it, it definitely would be nice to add a 2v8 mode of some sort as well, who knows if they will do a revolutionary rework for legion but it would be a unique killer and a new experience the game hasn‚Äôt really had before, could even have them around the map shouting insults and egging the survivors on making skill checks harder and giving info, and they could yell at the character you‚Äôre on like ‚Äúkill them already julie!‚Äù
---
Heroes
---
Every killer has been doing this, makes me pissed
---
yea, and my teammates get michle to tier 3 while he has tombestone and bring him to me
---
Because sometimes things don‚Äôt break until they hit live servers. Other times it‚Äôs because having your entire playerbase play for an hour gives more data and playtime than they can get testing in house which gives bugs more of an opportunity to present themselves. Sometimes testers just don‚Äôt catch them or aren‚Äôt given enough time on the current patch and miss bugs because of that.
---
Bro nobody can talk shit about  Halloween resurrection. Busta rhymes straight up beating the shit out of Michael Myers. Why tf did they add Laurie instead of busta rhymes. New survivor pls
---
Awesome game, man.
---
I think the best I've ever done is 4, and I had to burn every pallet on the map.
---
Did I miss something or is this just bad survivor gameplay
---
I feel bad for him 
---
Too bad he Didnt kill anyone
---
Plus enduring/spirit fury.
---
Aight imma head out
---
I think it has to do with possibly internet or there server. It happens to me alot on PC but not on the switch. Do a speed test. I get 80mbps with 15 ping .
---
You need more sleep lmao
---
I‚Äôve played the game for a while, but WoO really helps me when I need to know if the pallet is still there, or if a good loop is open. Otherwise, I could lead myself to a dead zone. But I never really run WoO, so eh.
---
depends on your goal, u wanna get to rank 1? or just have fun?
---
A CJ tech yea lol
---
December hasn't ended yet, give the devs a chance to put the patch out then post this when they inevitably don't. You gotta at least give them a chance to not do this on time to post about this lmao.
---
killer be runnin  with the squad like "who yall running from"?
---
Oh dang. I think that may possibly be an older glitch? Could you see any of the other cues like healing, active hex's/ status effects, etc.? I've gotten that glitch twice where I can't see any prompts for skill checks for any action but I remember a large time gap in between it happening.
---
I‚Äôm NoT eXe I‚Äôm ShErIfF
---
That's lame of her. Yeah I haven't ran into any toxic killers like that yet even though I'm at red ranks. Seriously though, if any killer knows about the basement bug and still intentionally hooks survivors in the basement, that's really lame.
---
Yes officer, this comment right here.
---
Ohhh look at this lottery winner here, bet you won at least 3 power balls with that luck.
---
I have had a few matches like that as killer and I know for damn sure I shouldn‚Äôt have hit that. I usually pick them up and let them escaped unless they were being very toxic the those I hook
---
Thanks Cutie
---
yes I'm sure BHVR is gonna be shaking in their boots over 1 day of people not playing
---
Nah, Jester confirmed.
---
Same I was pretty lucky he was already boosted enough to not realize
---
If you get downed close to basement thats on you, Im not gonna go out of my way and potentially let someone wiggle off to gobto a further hook. People act like its soley on killers to "not use basement" when survivors judt as easily can avoid that area.
---
You abused a bug though. There‚Äôs no justification for knowingly doing it. You could have just killed her and hooked her anywhere else if you didn‚Äôt like how she was playing. Even camped her if you want, but purposely abusing the basement glitch is a dick move.
---
No Adrenaline that's where you went wrong tisk tisk.... :D
---
yeah, thats my tought as well.
---
They probably had to introduce a check for survivors inside a range while wiggling, and somehow that messed something up.
---
‚ÄúWe want to redefine what a Killer is.
---
In our current Society ‚ÄòKiller‚Äô and ‚ÄòSurvivor‚Äô are social Constructs and we want to move away form that outdated mindset. I mean Survivors it Killers are forced to be this way and we want to change that.‚Äù
---
They almost fucked up tho
---
I usually tend to kill people in the basement when i have the opportunity, in order to save up some hooks on the map.
---

---
I had this fuckin game playing as Steve. I play meta perks for the most part and typically balance fun and competition while playing survivor. I noticed I was the only one doing gens. People ran toward Oni and farmed each other like it was their job and I got a massive amount of blood points from all categories except for survivor (rank 10 btw).
---
I was one hook away from dying and it was just me and a locker Dweet. I started hearing heartbeats. I literally got up from the gen I was working on said fuck it and motioned for the Oni to kill me and put me out of my misery. 
---
He just stood there, turned away, and ran around the map, found the Dwight in the locker, dusted his ass and then led me to the hatch. My god he was my hero that day.
---
As fun as it is to call anything interfering with the Survivor a "hostage" situation, this wasn't a hostage situation. A hostage situation is when you prevent the game from ending with no resolution. Here the resolution is that she gets hooked at the end of the game, or dies to Endgame Collapse. I left her behind to play the game as normal with the rest of the team, which is not hostage taking.
---
Also I was Oni, there was no Mori in play, and I was not camping or tunneling, she was just being a greedy shit farming her teammates in my face for them sweet BPs because Borrowed gives you a free "Safe" unhook no matter what, which is utter horseshit. Farmers ruin the game for their entire team with their selfishness, an opinion that is absolutely not limited to just me. If you think farming your teammates with a good strategy with  a MORI in play then...IDK, all that does is guarantee they will die when the killer hits them the second time.
---
She wanted to farm points at her team's expense, I put her in a position where she couldn't make any more, that's a fair trade in my mind. When I fell prey to this glitch a couple times I just pulled out my phone and waited to die, I wasn't forced to DC, and neither was she. Of course this is all subjective opinion.
---
Being able to vault windows/pallets and having a 30% move speed advantage is not ‚Äúuseless‚Äù lol
---
Well, resilience can save you in situations where being healthy wouldn't... Same with hope being able to save you where adrenaline wouldn't. Hope gives you a 7% haste effect for 2 minutes after the gates are powered.

---
Probably! Although it sounds like even though we can't see the animation or bar it does actually still work? 
---
On the other hand I heard that killers are getting stuck inside gens when they kick them? I played a match last night where a killer wasn't really kicking gens so maybe that was why as well. It sounds like the game is broken for both killers and survivors right now.

Hooking in the basement once you know about the bug is being 100% an asshole.

It's there to tell the person seeing the meme that whatever happens next happens out of nowhere. For example: sitting in a line at the store and the person behind you tells you he's vegan

Sad Legion hours.
---
He was previously broken. Got reworked. Then all the legion bitches are complaining because they were exploiting a bug in the PTB which they decided not to keep in. - Because it was uninteded.
---
Now acting like they are getting nerfed into oblivion.
---
It is exactly the same as pig. She got reworked to allow for EGC. Everyone only started getting extra pissy about it after they removed an unintentional bug on her - claiming more nerfs.
---
And it's hilarious because she is actually one of the most efficient killers. All that has changed is that you don't save all of your traps to the end now to stop people leaving.

did you want to mean "Hope"?
---
I love it when others play wraith.  He gets a lot of hate despite being so low on the tier list.
---
My usual build either consists of Bloody Coil + Setting Tools (and the purple version if I can find any of the damn things) or Tar Bottle and Stitched Bag. I pretty much think the Logwood Dye is useless, hence why I have 137 of them.
---
Did I say that? No. I said pretty much every killer. So not every single one. But the majority.
---
did i miss something? Legion gets nerfed again? for Real?
---
I made up a few perks for him, same for Sawrunner, for simons prestige outfit I thought of book Simon but less monster like in the face lmao.
---
I have done this at the Killer Shack..
---
I am fucking trash.
---
Survivor bad killer good.
---
is it like before where two people go spectator and switch to killer at the same time?
---
Yea basically. Ruin is non-existent when I use the combo, just focus the objective help teammates and not worry about healing at all. I really like the play style honestly
---
Whats the bug all about?
---
She wasn't forced to DC. I left the basement and played the game as normal with everyone else, if she waited the game would have resolved at whatever point I got everyone else and went back for her. It's not the same situation as bodyblocking everyone in the basement and going AFK, for example.
---
I just get out my phone and wait to die, no different camping except I can actually participate in the rest of the game rather than babysitting the hook...which is what people seem to be recommending. It feels very arbitrary to me.
---
michle
---
I hope so. I do like the design but it‚Äôs the same with the spirits map where I‚Äôd rather play on any other map :D not even sure why
---
.... yes? That's my point. They keep fiddling with the lighting and sound (without even putting it somewhere I've seen in the patch notes) in a game where doing so changes how it's played.
---
It's so dark right now that blendettes can 360 and disappear on like half the maps. It's not supposed to be like that.

I don't even understand what that means. Is it supposed to mean that if this was an Episode of Kek or Cringe with the Entity, this is Cringe?

---
I know and it totally sucks. I 2man swf with a friend and he's not good at running from the killer really but boy will he get then gens done when he can
---
If that nea saved you out of the trap you could have made it out easier
---
If a survivor gets hooked on the basement,  they will fall of the map and wont be able to see anything

This is amazing, can someone please make a real one to add into the game, similar to the cat meme and spine chill?

I still like battlepasses as a cool way to support cheap/free games I‚Äôm playing.
---
I played against a legion and he did not feel nerfed
---
Apparently there is a work around, if you start the unhook animation then cancel it before you pull them down you will fix the glitch. Then you can get them down normally, you should say that before games.
---
Oh lol im gonna have to try it out

That's impossible, every true blendette runs iron will

I thought they were able to track if people started using new perks/add-ons much more often then they used to?
---
You know, I can‚Äôt remember haha. I thought it was related to the ‚Äúnot being able to actually escape through the gates‚Äù glitch from a few months ago but it did let me escape, which surprised me. And it was just one match. So I don‚Äôt know. But it was annoying.

Because in the over 100 games I've played since the release I have not encountered even one of the listed bugs.

Do you think their QA team is thousand of people playing hundreds of thousands of games before releasing it? 
---
Fucking get some perspective you dick.
---
I actually talked to Andreas R√∂nnberg about it not too long ago, he‚Äôs states that he‚Äôs had the idea in mind, however he said it‚Äôs very difficult, but I can see why since Simons model is a bit outdated to say the least, but if possible I can send you a note on what I had in mind? :]
---
wait that's actually a buff.
---
Like unironically if he could do those things he could be a more effective Killer by a lot

If you get mori'd on the edge of the exit, will you escape, since most moris push you forward?

Does that mean that the abdominal dressing won't reduce charges? Because that could be a savage buff to medkits.
---
Don't they pretty much have to get that to stay in red though??
---
It‚Äôs not luck is just a pro
---
Oh yea sure wouldn't mind seeing it also interesting Andreas atleast thought about getting a cry of fear chapter in the game(atleast that what I got from what you said.)
---
Yeah, mine is 220 mbps/8 ping
---
 But the connection is all on the Killer's. It was just suspicious that before that, he hooked the survivor, and stood still for a good while. Since I had Kindred. But oh well. I think that the developers have done a pretty good job so far üíÄ
---
Whoever said death wasn't an escape fucking lied
---
Yeah. Taking stopping looking in a box (no matter if you find a key or not), inflicts one health state of damage to the survivor.
---
No other changes.
---
this is important to remember. some people can/will only play a few times a week, if that. try reminding people or pointing it out to them after games rather than jumping down their throats.
---
imagine equating exploiting actual bugs/glitches to using in-game items and mechanics.

It doesnt matter what you get on average if there are cases where one side of multiplayer versus game cant do anything, no matter their skill. This goes for both killer and (mainly solo) survivor.
---
I think it caps at 100% overall so the medkit will get wasted and not give speed.

---
Woth medkit ad ons you can have insta heal
---
Or they tested it in a very rigid, standardized way without actually simulating organic gameplay or doing multiple iterations of the same test. With the basement bug this is likely the case since it doesn't happen 100% of the time.

Guess everyone realized the Oni is kinda hard to use considering the optimization
---
The way you stated your original comment made it sound like you trapped her there when she was the last survivor without closing the hatch.
---
" I left her behind to play the game as normal with the rest of the team, which is not hostage taking." No you did not, You left her in a glitched state on purpose. Meaning she couldnt play the game normally.

" Also I was Oni, there was no Mori in play, and I was not camping or tunneling, she was just being a greedy shit farming her teammates in my face for them sweet BPs because Borrowed gives you a free "Safe" unhook no matter what, which is utter horseshit." Then what is the problem if you werent tunneling? If you werent tunneling then you can easily hit the Claudette while she is unhooking right in your face, And if she is in a safe distance to get the unhook before you can get to her and hit her, Whats the problem? Her teammate gains borrowed time and she is still healthy and can take a hit. (Note, If she just straight up ditched her teammates afterwards then thats a dick move unless they had DS)
---
" Farmers ruin the game for their entire team with their selfishness, an opinion that is absolutely not limited to just me."  Agreed, But at what point is it okay to use bugs to your advantage against them?  And "farming" can also be used effectively. (I wasnt in your match, So I obviously cant be 100% how she was "farming" her teammates)
---
"She wanted to farm points at her team's expense, I put her in a position where she couldn't make any more, that's a fair trade in my mind." Then just kill her instead of keeping her stuck and blind. All you did was abuse a bug to your advantage, 
---
"When I fell prey to this glitch a couple times I just pulled out my phone and waited to die, I wasn't forced to DC, and neither was she." So you are saying its fine to abuse bugs because you can just wait it out? Like infinite mending legion, Sure you can mend for 10 minutes. But is that really fine just because you can wait it out?
---
TL:DR You abused a bug because you didnt like someones playstyle, then kept them stuck for multiple minutes. Just kill them and move on
---
Myers got a skin???
---
Why? I play on PS4 but I haven't been on DBD for about a week
---
This meme format is so dead you guys.. come on.
---
event ones havent been, according to my friend (i got all mine)
---
but the special outfits from cons n stuff have
---
Still an asshole.  You are willing to break someone else's game to satisfy your own needs.
---
Honest to shit I'm gonna just turn off my messages because I'm tired of this shit üôÑ
---
Honestly you're best off just bringing grey medkits in until this is fixed. Every medkit seems to be stuck at that level of charges.
---
yah but it would be a bit too powerful if he was still a 115% speed so maybe down to a 110% movement speed but a major speed boost in frenzy.
---
Abbreviations are more efficient when taking time into account, and they are common practice on social media
---
You don't spin with Oni as fast as the sensitivity goes. You flick and curve just like drift Billy.
---
It literally just shuts off my PS4
---
Some sweaty little survivor main will find something in there. 
---
"He still has a knife and the ability to enter my lobby, OP PLZ NERF"
---
Relateable
---
What‚Äôs stopping you now?
---
While the dash could be tweaked in almost all aspects, the RBTs are the issue, when you remember that if they go off, their power is basically equal to that of a Mori and they immediately just kill the survivor. That is too hard to balance in my opinion.
---
Stack on the RNG element, the possible debuffs, how easy it is for the Pig to deny access to the Billy boxes, and the lack of urgency vs. the lethality of the RBT from the survivors PoV and we have us another mechanic that is impossible to balance so that it is always an effective tool for the killer, yet fair enough to play around/against as survivor.
---
The problem with Pig is that you can have a scenario where she places 1 trap on each survivor at some point in the match and you have 2 identical mirror matches that have all the same exact variables, where the only thing that changes is the survivor finds the key in the 1st box or 5th box and the outcome will be drastically different. Her power is TOO RNG dependent to ever feel both powerful and  fair at the same time.
---
With a power that has a strength to just straight up kill the survivor, you don't want it to be  buffed, where you're regularly killing almost all the survivors with them every match, at that point it will be too much. Especially when you consider active bear traps can't leave through the gates either.
---
In my opinion if you want her to be viable across the board, the RBTs should be reworked in general.
---
My first match with this map the killer never ended up seeing me even once, I felt kinda bad. The extra walls and big rocks are very helpful for hiding lol
---
**impossible**
---
who wants a 2v8 mode? ive seen like 1 person ask for it and it was moreso a joke.
---
and to make a 2v8 mode remotely balanced youd have to completely redesign the objective system
---
So you are saying that if the Killer camps, I can use any available exploits to make him unable to play the game?
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea
---
I hate the map Grim Pantry. It‚Äôs so boring imo also I somehow get lost on it.
---
They were originally saying one to two weeks from the patch. Hope it's sooner.
---
The worst thing is, this bug is now common knowledge at this point and you STILL have people abusing it by running basement builds. 
---
I went against some scrub tier streamer playing Myers yesterday running IG/Agitation and taunting everyone in the lobby that he won't get banned for it. Once we figured out he was abusing the bug we started all rushing for killer shack every time someone went down (was Rotten Fields) to block and flashlight save. We all escaped and reported him afterwards, hope he gets banned.
---
Ok this needs to stop. You got an optionally free chapter, so many free cosmetics, along with this update which did sort out a lot of issues like frame rate dropping and what not. 
---
And on top of that BHVR has been communicating and working around the clock to fix new issues that have popped up. They are not multi billion dollar corporation but a small company really passionate about their project.
---
They didn't whine when one of their baby (Deathgarden) died but moved on and started working harder to keep DBD growing like it has been in recent months.
---
The Devs are doing their best and we should be appreciative of that instead of constantly stomping and spitting on them in the name of poor taste comedy.
---
Be a little grateful people.
---
I don't understand, are claudettes usually toxic and don't heal? I haven't had an experience like this
---
This has been a problem for low rank killers forever, it legit takes 20-30 minutes to find a match regardless.
---
These latest rank reset changes are just going to exacerbate the problem.
---
YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE
---
Highly agree with you, if the devs can slightly tweak his sensitivity it can bounce him back to where he should be as a S to A tier killer, on console rn though I say he's a low A tier because of the limitations
---
Except that SWF groups only make up ~4% of the lobbies, so it's safe to assume that a majority of these stats are from red/high rank games.  Just because they're not in depth doesn't mean they're useless, they're still indicative of trends in the game.
---
Same reason why nurse and Billy aren't nearly as good as they should be on consoles. Despite being a port dbd is coded differently on consoles so some things just come out a little wack. Mix that with controller capabilities and not that optimized performance console dbd suffers from and you find a whole less nurse and a lot more freddy
---
Doctor Who meme = Upvote!

Thanks for the heads up but guess I'm gonna be playing only killer for a few days and avoid basement hooks.
---
We do not do that at all. Do not listen to them.
---
DBD is neither cheap nor free.
---
20‚Ç¨ for the game plus 7‚Ç¨ a chapter. Which is over 100‚Ç¨ for all the content.
---
Situation A: you get the notification that someone was unhooked and return to see scratch marks you follow them and it turns out to be the injured person. Thats not tunneling but now what? Do you just leave him and give up a free chase or do you fall into the above scenarios where you have to either slug or take the ds? Both of which are detrimental to you as i explained above. Situation B: there are multiple people injured someone was recently unhooked but there are multiple people using the same character skin. Now what for 1 min do you not chase anyone with that skin? Situation C: you are snow balling hard and hook multiple people in rapid succession and they are all unhooked. Now what do you just have to ignore 50-75% of the team for an entire minute? If 3 people have ds and you ignore them they could all hop on gens and even if the gens were at 0 now you have 3 gens at 75% or potential 2 gens if 2 people hop on 1 gen for the 44 sec to complete it and then those help the third once done with it. Now your huge momentum from rapid hooks is not only gone but has turned into huge momentum for the survivors. Situation D: you tunneled. So out 4 situations only 1 the solution is dont tunnel. What do you suggest the solution is to the other scenarios? id love to know if you have one because the only one i can think of is lose momentum and lose time which puts you in a worse position and a potential losing one out of no fault of your own or skill of the survivor, but rather just the existence of 1 perk.
---
Out of all the legion ideas this one is the most...  interesting.... story short killers being in a locker is not the best idea and this would be considerably worse than what their power already is and a very weird mechanic at that
---
I just want the fix to killers engaging in chase and the frame stutter causing me to miss the first hit so often...
---
I don't remember seeing any challenge that requires basement camping.
---
r/deadbydaylightgonewild
---
How does this even happen? wtf are the devs doing that makes certain actions randomly send you to the shadow realm
---
*in the future would probably be more appropriate than ‚Äúof the future‚Äù but now I‚Äôm just being pedantic to make a point lol. I really don‚Äôt care for spelling errors, it just seems so unnecessary to correct someone when the message is clearly communicated regardless. No hard feeling obviously.
---
I've been away from the game for a few months. What's the glitch?
---
4 Man SWF make up 5% of the groups. But you have roughly a 70% chance to have at least some form of SWF in any given game. Now it might be a single 2 stack and 2 randoms, or two 2 stacks but in most games it's present.

by 'hotfix' they mean they're just gonna (slightly) fix the gamebreaking bugs, yknow, in 9 fucking months
---
Thats what I said in my comment, stop using crass comedy to shit on devs when they have been doing all they can.
---
yeah that‚Äôs fucking annoying
---
&gt; il assume you are a compsci grad working entry at a fairly large company where they have stricter requirements to sort out the riffraff
---
Wrong, fucking idiot.
---
Explain to me how something like the wiggle bug is something that is purely unique to game development, or something like med kit addons.
---
As far as I'm concerned something like the wiggle bug should be isolated from anything unique to game development. Really, nothing in terms of how they handle key strokes should have changed if this was set up in an intelligent manner. Really if it was set up properly nothing should be changed at all other than a parameter to determine wiggle speed after doing checks to see if someone with that new perk is in range.
---
Then something like med kit addons. How is that unique to game development? When loading in to the game...I mean check what addons they have, apply charges and heal speed and whatever properties that it may have to that med kit, and it should stay the same until depletion. Why is that unique to game development? In fact, why can't that be unit tested?
---
Why wasn't the wiggle bug found when a new perk was introduced that involved wiggling? Why are you defending this shit?
---
"Knitted beret claudette" haha. I know I dont do that, what's the point of playing like a scared child
---
I think any power that could possibly down a survivor is better than what their power is currently. Their power right now is absolutely useless. Mending doesn‚Äôt slow the game down much, if at all. Now it doesn‚Äôt go down when sprinting. It doesn‚Äôt help in a chase. What‚Äôs the point of getting a hit if you can never finish the kill. The legions power currently is actually useless and my idea actually gives him map pressure, use in chase, and stealth, all at once. This would be much better than his current power
---
If they didn't make deep wounds so useless and just changed how it functions between chases and mending then legion would have been fine 
---
One of the utmost stupid changes I've seen to this game so far
---
Like the mannequins in the mall level in condemned criminal origins
---
Wow I had no clue you could pull survivors off the pallets
---
Windows at least has some use to tell you what pallets have/haven't spawned, or what ones have been used, which can help you know what areas to avoid in a chase.
---
For killer, the survivors generally dictate what loops you're going to, and you should know what areas have been cleared or not.
---
He isn't, if anything he's straight up f***ing terrifying, especially for the 10-20 rank bracket, which is honestly a nice change of pace for the game not having any scary killers over then I guess ghostface in some senareos, though the fear factor alone + the amazing ability makes him a force to be reckoned with, its just because of the limitations for console players and the sensitivity that holds him back, just like pre-patched nurse/current nurse
---
I agree, but I'd also like to note that it's kinda gross that the community will say this but hardly anyone says anything about a survivor humping a matt walker window.   
---

Dude I just ran around the nurse for 5 gens (which is a heart attack and a half) last night and my teammates all left before I got to the gate and escaped lol
---
Hook 1 survivor in the basement while another survivor is hooked in the basement while using monstrous shrine. The simplest way is basement camping. You could ‚Äúplay normal,‚Äù but realistically speaking you shouldn‚Äôt get it, especially purple/red tier.
---
My fucking dumbass actually looked for wraithü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Agreed, she needs some love
---
I like to hook someone, go insidious, and then down the rescuer and hook escapee in one jump scare with chainsaw. Good times. Then I NOED.
---
eh, if he tunneled for 5 gens w an ebony....... i mean..
---
When the game boots up, the menu is uncapped so the PS4 (base at least) will get really loud trying to push out as much FPS as possible.
---
If you play mostly survivor, you won't notice FPS issues really outside maybe Dead Hard or Skill Checks not loading right if the screen is cluttered (looking at part of a map with tons of assets when someone gets hooked).
---
Killer is way more noticable once bloodlust kicks in and/or you use add-ons that speed up animations for killers. Corn maps make it worse too.
---
Why was this tagged as a rant? Congrats dude
---
Thank you i always try to use maths or data to back up what i say. Too many people let their feelings get in the way.

---
My favorite DBD streamer got banned for mri canceling :(
---
Billy with monstrous shrine, iron grasp, agitation, and bbq. There you go
---
It reminds me of a one piece picture
---
I had one the other day where the last injured survivor made it to the hatch right after me and I stomped it closed right in her face then downed her and hooked her.  It was intense.
---
"We decided that pallets aren't effective enough on legion so we implemented a new feature where if a pallet drops on legion, they're knocked unconscious for the rest of the game. We plan to add this feature for the pig in future updates."
---
they all say "oh i didnt know" when they have 80 hours this week in only killer and my name is literally 'basementsbugged'
---
Poor legion is basically just BHVRs punching bag
---
Hey the yui one is in jpeg. It would be better without the white background. Could you please change it? btw i love your doge icons, good work!
---
&gt;Hook 1 survivor in the basement while another survivor is hooked in the basement while using monstrous shrine. The simplest way is basement camping. You could ‚Äúplay normal,‚Äù but realistically speaking you shouldn‚Äôt get it, especially purple/red tier.
---
So this is not a problem with the challenge itself but players wanting to get it done ASAP so they can move on to the next challenge otherwise they are wasting time when they could be progressing their rift.
---
The current way the challenges work force people to play like this. The basement challenge is quite fun and like you said it yourself, people don't **have to** camp, personally I completed mine by having fun with a "carry build" (agi + IG + mad grit) and just throwing people there.
---
I‚Äôm not arso because 2 attacked me last night and I was healed by doc

---
Exactly.
---
His ability makes you into a literal fireball that runs around the map decemating any and all survivors, which honestly if you had a samurai letting off a blood howling scream in your face you would honestly probably piss yourself
---
Thats probably a typo in all honesty. Yeah I said I don‚Äôt care if you correct me, so obviously no hard feelings.
---
If you run everywhere you are not doing anything productive so I‚Äôm not sure what your point is
---
Usually it‚Äôs the survivor that teabags at pallets, point taunts and loops that will dc as soon as you down them.
---
dude... finally someone says the truth! People only know Jason because of the game.
---
Pallet attack!
---
Legion is not supposed to be a stealth killer at all so I don‚Äôt know where you are getting that from. Their power is not useless as all as it makes it easier to injure multiple survivors in a short period of time the point of mend is not to down but to slow survivors which it does if you are consistently hitting them frequently with feral frenzy if a survivor is running across the map they are not doing anything productive so that‚Äôs on them the only change they should make is so running in terror radius is what pauses mending not every killer needs to have a instadown
---
buff moon pls
---
With how the spaghetti code is in this game, it‚Äôs entirely random what gets broken after a change.  Who would‚Äôve thought to test getting hooked in the basement after adding a perk to pick up dropped pallets yknow?
---
I got banned for using wake up when it was bugged. Without realizing it wasn‚Äôt my friends leader or prove thyself giving me the bonus. Only after 2 games too.
---
Darn. sorry guys I didn't know that :(
---
Ah, a fellow scientist Jake that runs the killer around, except you're actually good at it! Im glad the claudettes weren't assholes, congrats on surviving.
---
You‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs considerably worse than PC.
---
Can we see perks?
---
Why not just heal the slug? It‚Äôs better anyways and guarantees an out
---
Is it possible she fell below the map which counted as an escape??
---
In the legions trailer, he is running with David. He then attacks David out of nowhere for a sneak attack. Generally stealth killers use sneak attacks.
---
The whole deep wounds and feral frenzy is just not working. There have been many changes and I don‚Äôt think there is a good change to it. It has to be reworked
---
Sure, I‚Äôll send them to you directly cause I have them all wrote down, I don‚Äôt have perk images atm sadly.
---
Had a wraith a couple games ago that did nothing but overcommit carries to get people in basement. He didn‚Äôt succeed, but goddamn was it obvious he was trying to pull free kills.
---
This image gave me a miniature blood transfusion
---
Run DS it's a direct counter to the basement it gets you out if you hit it.
---
This is a great idea, basically functions like Trapper's bloody coils. It should probably only knock you down to injured state though, idk if solo survivors would have a chance to beat the RBT timer if they're healing and they're obviously screwed if they go down and Pig can just hop over and get them.
---
They may make up only 4% of the total players but how many players are at rank 1? 10% maybe? So odds are youll go against them 40% of the time if thats the case and even more frequently if you play in sweaty region. And its not like they need insane synergy or team play, just call outs as simple as ‚Äúthe killers oni‚Äù ‚Äúhes on me‚Äù ‚Äúhey someone heal me im at blank‚Äù ‚Äúhey gen im blank is 99‚Äù ‚Äúim going for save‚Äù make the game way too rough for most killers because it maximizes time on gens and gen prioritization. So can we stop with this? Also who cares how frequent something is if its absolutely broken, like who cares how rare iri hatch, utility belt huntress with an ebony is to come across its stupidly broken and should be addressed, just like swf.
---
Have the decency to do it on last hooks at least, jesus.
---
Who the hell says Jason is Nurse? Like I understand Trapper, seeing his design was most definitely based on Jason, but where the hell do people get Nurse from?
---
Why can't my team do this :c
---
sure, but that doesnt Change anything
---
**REVERSE** backhanded Pallet drop! GO!
---
Tbh legion survivor would be pretty cool, like someone of their group thinking they have gone to far, and now has left/got kicked out of the group.
---
As a Pig main I have 0 issue with removing my ability to see trap boxes in exchange for a useful buff. I don't pay attention to them anyway except when I'm going to hook a survivor and trying to avoid putting them right next to a box.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6ixi8/counter_to_basement_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It's called a pro gamer move, ok.
---
Nice and a half, really close to 70
---
So, no news for the "stuck in the generator after kicking it" bug? Damn
---
DS counters this bug if you hit it you are free again.
---
I got put in the basement, fell through the map and got unhooked and I was still falling. But when the killer picked me up again I hit him with decisive and it was back to normal
---
The ability to be where the plot demands him. In universe it might seem like he's teleporting or "blinking" to his next victim.
---
"Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack.", Rule of Acquisition 109.

Which two hooks do that? Is it consistent? I still want to be able to use the basement, and a couple ago i sent someone to the void off a backhook. Felt bad.
---
They mentioned in the AMA that once cross platform gets implemented, they‚Äôll raise the console max sensitivity to keep up with PC. So there‚Äôs hope.
---

---
It‚Äôs a *parliament* of Claudettes
---
Okay but their actually in game design made by BHVR is not supposed to be a stealth killer. There will never be a killer like the trailer most likely because a killer that looks like a survivor isn‚Äôt effective in high level play . Feral frenzy works if you know how to use legion and if they ever rework the power entirely(which I doubt will happen for a very long time if ever) they still won‚Äôt be a stealth killer
---
It‚Äôs a meme.
---
Wiggle not working properly and basement hooks launching your camera into orbit are not edge cases, nor is sound being bugged yet again. They would have noticed by playing a nonzero number of standard dbd games.
---
Running into random players that end up being god tier teammates are one of my few moments of happiness I have with this game
---
When you get hooked as a survivor in the basement you/ the camera seem to fall under the map. For me at least the screen went completely gray and I couldn't see anything. Even when you get unhooked the screen will stay grayed out. Some other players said it can be fixed by being picked up and dropped by the killer or if a survivor starts to unhook you but then gets interrupted/ stops. 
---
If you see survivors just kind of hanging out in the basement not moving after being hooked odds are they have the glitch and can't see a thing on their screen.  I can't blame killers since I know some of them don't know about the glitch and others are just trying to complete the tome 3 challenges but the basement glitch is pretty brutal.
---
Not really, just need a bigger map and more gens and one more door.
---
They can kill themselves on hook. Nothing is stopping them from doing that so there‚Äôs no reason to dc
---
Ah, but I mean lately what's changed that makes him popular? Did they buff his rework?
---
What a great solution, screw over the rest of the team, it‚Äôs not like survivors want to have fun aswell/s
---
I'm not abusing it. If I'm near the basement I'm not risking you wiggling free I'm putting you down there idc.
---
And it doesn't always happen anyways
---
Why's that? It might be different but it wouldn't be impossible.
---
i feel like it should be once per jigsaw hat
---
I can't fuckin stand this. Fuck you to any survivor that does this BS.
---
I too do not read the patchnotes or the pop up when the game launches.
---
Why stop at Oni is ass on console? The whole game has been ass on console since way before the Yamaokas poisoned it
---
Stop making bs excuses as to them being a small team, they have had a nice cash flow since stranger things dumped! It‚Äôs a lack of management within the company period! 
---
Also I was running the emergency med kit (green) 16 charges, then a Gel dressing another 16 charges and gauze roll 12 charges with botany, now botany only speeds up healing and I‚Äôm aware of this but normally I can get almost 3 full heals from this build for a med kit and the damn thing was gone before I was even fully healed upon the first time using it... so again med kits are broke along with the list of other shit broke...
---
it‚Äôs free to play with game pass on Xbox, and frequently goes on sale across all platforms. compared to $60 titles filled to the brim with microtransactions and another $60+ of DLC, it‚Äôs pretty cheap for a game.
---
Yeah but all you are doing is just assuming.
---
What if the killer breaks the pallet?
---
Because while it sucks and isn‚Äôt fun camping is a valid tactic that isn‚Äôt against the rules to do. The only way campers usually win is when people don‚Äôt realize they are camping and super altruistic survivors keep going for the save.
---
Excessive DC‚Äôing is something that has been stated to be against the rules. All this person is saying is that instead of hitting disconnect you just kill yourself quick on hook. Result is the same for you and your team as if you dc‚Äôd.
---
I know! Man I think I found a much better place for my content on DbD, I have a bunch of comics for it/other screenshots I may post on here, some even include Simon as well.
---
Bubba broke the scale, thats why he isnt here
---
I didn‚Äôt realize there was a glitch, well sorry the 3 survivors I slapped down there in a Oni game because the entire team was huddled to one gen and didn‚Äôt scatter more than like a foot from it. My bad.(I don‚Äôt know if a glitch actually happened but I did feel some of them just died down there way to quickly)
---
You do know there‚Äôs a basement hook bug right? That survivor in front of you was probably floating in the abyss.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Actually Dev's already said the flick isnt supposed to be a thing and are patching it on PC
---
You talented cutie
---
I feel the same.  The charge is clunky an the lunge is difficult from far away.  I only succeed in hitting a survivor if i tap the power right behind it. 
---
Also, I don't know if it is just me, but the game is jittery during the Oni's blood fury.
---
They just make a heart beat noise. It's stupid cute!   
---
I must play too much. 
---
My niece also called me garbage a couple of weeks when I was being tunneled. :/
---
Oh, i forgot bubba :(
---
At this point if they left everything the same and just put him on survivor would anyone really notice
---
&gt;I too do not read the patchnotes or the pop up when the game launches.
---
Or read the devs notes.
---
Or look at the pinned threads. 
---
Or use the search bar.
---
Technology is hard for some people.
---
Nah, is just that people know how to use his rework fully now.
---
PGTW + BBQ&amp;C to teleport right after hooking a survivor to a gen being worked on to kick it and start a new chase.
---
Use Chain+rope addons if you want to slow gens to a crawl or his pallet addon + something else for mindgames in chases
---
If you want to be real nasty you can use the Forever freddy setup to slow gens to a halt so the fun never ends.
---
These are the teammates I aspire to be.
---
Far far away
---
The dlc gives you a gold logo
---
Ooooh whats the forever Freddy setup?
---
He definitely did get nerfed. 
---
He is just a badly designed character and will never be balanced in his current state so I made a thread on a possible rework.
---
yea i 100% feel like i'm handicapping myself with him.
---
i genuinely had better games with nurse when i was trying to learn her.
---
Wut.. f*ck! Already buyed the Oni because I didn't buy her cause of the cosmetic issue here
---
If anything I get mad when they don‚Äôt give last hatch even if it‚Äôs not me because that‚Äôs how I play as killer
---
The basement hooks are glitched?
---
Nope. People would have pointed it out then.
---
Just so you know, people have good that particular person this several times now. They don‚Äôt care about the hardware limitations and how awful it feels for console players. They have a narrative to push
---
You know we don‚Äôt have great community events anymore because they are all taking a lot of man power from that to fix the game they are working on just have patience they actually care about the game unlike other game developers
---
Pretty much, they should rework to just escaping after the hatch has been shut. 
---
Ive gotten twice (xbox and pc) and it was from a glitch and the other was pure luck.
---
Pc i was the last one and the ghost face brought me to the hatch, i wiggled out and ran to the gen and he let me do it and escape.
---
Xbox i was against a huntress on lery‚Äôs (i was in like gold ranks on xbox playing with some friends) i kept running between gens trying to get the last one for like 5 minutes until she finally closed the hatch while i was working on a gen. Opened the gate and escaped and somehow got it
---
Can we get this with a hooked David on the reverse side?
---
There's a disturbance in the force.
---
Pharmacy is a guaranteed medkit. I like to board medkits... Also a better self-care.
---
Y‚Äôall I didn‚Äôt even know this could happen so I was so confused my a legion was stopping at nothing to take my only to the basement hook
---
Good on the devs since today they are going to start punishing dcs today on steam and switch

The only stealth skins you get is the blendette build, but damn if it's not effective.
---
Thank you for the daily dose of survivor bullshit
---
Did you try going to another challenge and then going back to that one?
---
New here, do players up there really salt you for doing badly? Like seriously, it ain't your fault for doing badly. And doesn't that give them a better time if you do badly? Jeez, some people just like throwing insults to feel better of themselves
---
i honestly dont think it really matters because as long as you know your child can take it thats all that matters
---
spirit was not reworked
---
And when you get lagged before it or a vault even though you went over it in chase |:
---
Honestly lol the ‚ÄúBHVR devs suck loolololol‚Äù are kinda stale. Even the unnecessary nerf memes are tiring.
---
Praise the entity! This was very annoying, and it actually ruined a couple good games me and my teammates were having.
---
The number of bugs in the update is insane
---
Good. Stay Down
---
The legion nerf was justified. When you use your chainsaw or hatchets as other killers, it doesn‚Äôt trigger things like sloppy butcher for the survivors. But then the legion would use their power and would trigger sloppy butcher with a feral frenzy stab, which isn‚Äôt consistent with literally every other killer in the game.
---
After watching streams and Youtube videos of DBD for the past 2 +/- years I finally caved and got the game on Switch last week or so. Now, I am a new, bad player don't get me wrong. I have tons of trouble looping any killer and looking behind me while still running the direction I need to go. But the high ranks on Switch are crazy to solo. Half the team will kill themselves on first hook instantly, gens blow up right an left. If for some crazy reason we get all the gens done somehow, the doors are instantly opened and its every player for themselves instead of 99% which isn't really a big deal since I know a lot pf the people playing don't have the understanding of the game that I have from watching videos for 2 years  but it still hurts to see when you know how it should go. One thing I didn't expect was the tension of playing survivor I feel. I keep telling myself its a game but  I find myself not breathing at points and panicking when a killer notices me. I thin kthe more I player to more I will relax but its hard at first with everything going on in a match. There still are decent players in the higher ranks though. You can tell some are just messing around and have a main account on another system. After playing a few nights I moved up into the 14-15 ranks which gets better for solo players for sure. I just really need practice at running killers. I also hate there is no chat before or after games so you can tell someone they did great or to mention a tip that may help them. I had a lvl 15 or so Claud pull off a flashlight save for me a couple nights ago at the exit gates allowing me and our other teammate to get past the Trapper we were going against. It would have been nice to point that out to the player after the game because they deserved the praise for that move. I plan to play some killer next week, I just wanted to get a week or 2 done solely as survivor to get a feel for the controls/maps
---
Yes I can go back to looting the basement chest in peace and I can finally complete my master Killer Challenge.
---
I'm at 49 and I still have level 3 of the tome, but I'm unsure if I can make it to 70 in time...
---
Had this happen to our 4 man group at least 3 out of every 4 games.
---
I only say ‚ÄúGG‚Äù if it is actually a good game. Crazy idea, I know.
---
Why shouldn't there be a swastika and rising sun?
---
You can break someones game by bringing them to basement?
---
the thing that always gets me about the yelling about jason is i'm not sure what his thing would even *be*. i'm sure if bhvr ever got the rights they'd figure it out, but jason's thing is his relentlessness; you're right, he's not like the trapper or the nurse even though the jason inspo is clear in the trapper. his 'teleportation' is a narrative affect which is why it was incorporated into the other game but wouldn't work here (unless it also included some kind of stalking mechanic?)
---
i guess i just don't see how he'd work in dbd because the things that make him a truly fearsome killer, are things every killer in the game has. aside from the improvised killing anyway.
---
Mm! Yup!
---
also I cant struggle.
---
Looks like she has a key in her hand, so maybe it was a invisible escape hatch? or maybe she had some hack/mod that allowed her to see it.
---
Wait so... if i try to complete my archive stuff that requires basements, im trash?
---
I make it a mission to find the killer and lure him into a good looping area. Just for the sake of practicing.
---
People are talking about this bug but no ones talking about the medkit bug? Any add on I bout onto the uncommon and rare just don‚Äôt work, I put on the 16 charges add on and it didn‚Äôt give me another head out of the medkit
---
Firstly, yes. If you lose, you get toxicity, if you win, you get toxicity. If you win and are nice to one person, you'll get toxicity from a survivor who waited the whole game to flame you.
---
Generally, though, if you get to rank 1 you'll know how to hold your own and know how to play properly to counter all the different methods of survivor-play. Not just mindgames, but abusing overly-altruistic players, etc.
---
Secondly, no, it doesn't always give them a better time, for two reasons. One, they won't pip if they just do gens. Secondly, no one has fun if they just stomp a player into the ground.
---
Dead by Daylight is easily the most toxic game I've ever played, which is fair enough considering the strong **us vs. them** dynamic. However, I don't really fault it, either. I play killer to be the antagonistic force and enjoy the pressure and satisfaction of winning.
---
You get used to the toxicity.
---
ty
---
Borrowed Time didn‚Äôt initially have Deep Wound, and shouldn‚Äôt be linked to the effectiveness of a killer‚Äôs power, since it makes balance difficult.
---
That was every game 1 if us also had issues with black screening during game then it just came back.
---
Bitch deserved it
---
Realy
---
On Xbox last night I had two matches in a row where about half way through, all four survivors disconnected at the same time. No idea what‚Äôs going on. Stopped playing after the second occurrence.
---
" I am rank 0 mate, trust me, you are playing with a legend"
---
Said by a David player using only free cosmetics.
---
I wonder if that glitch is still around where something happens and the screen essentially is taken up by the entire survivor...I‚Äôve had that happen and the game was pretty much unplayable. Maybe that‚Äôs what he meant?
---
I once did something similar as ghostface. I found a survivor who didnt see me, and followed them (without stalking) until they noticed me. I ran with them for a while until the gems started finishing, but I let him go
---
jesus that grab took way too much time to trigger, if he had finished the pallet animation just half a sec earlier the grab would've been canceled... love dedicated servers
---
This has literally been fixed you damp socks
---
Everytime he downs a survivor: "This is MY swamp!"
---
Nope. Doctor Add-ons still have the upcoming mid chapter descriptions as well.
---
Only the urgent game breaking stuff was touched.
---
Yea but slightly increasing his speed isn‚Äôt really a good replacement. He‚Äôs still trash and needs something to help him
---
They‚Äôre talking about Q &amp; E flicking. Which allows you to flick at up to 270 degrees. The reason why the notes said joystick as well is because Q &amp; E + Joystick flick on PC was too much as well. Flicking is a part of his kit, they nerfed it in patch notes so it‚Äôs obviously a feature.
---
Down here in rank 10-20 is fun. Everyone is good. Played Trapper and the survivors said I'm a good killer even though I only sacrificed one rank 20 player
---
yes
---
He was playing normally so i dont think so, hell he was the best looper in the team
---
Gee, I sure am going to miss the thousands of posts about the glitch...
---
And the problem with that is...?
---
Yes, anyone deliberately utilizing the bug for easy kills is an ass.  But I‚Äôd rather give someone the benefit of the doubt than treat an innocent killer like an asshole.
---
Hot take: the reason the game is constantly toxic is too many people assume innocent behavior/mistakes are deliberate toxicity, so they act toxic ‚Äúin return,‚Äù and then the previously non-toxic player sees toxic behavior so ‚Äúretaliates.‚Äù
---
So yeah, I‚Äôd rather be wrong about an actually toxic player than get mad at a non-toxic player because of perceived slights.  Maybe that makes me boo-boo the clown but I have a much happier time playing when I stop assuming the worst of the other 4 people I‚Äôm playing with.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Didn't saw her P3.. and now I'm mad cause I didn't buy the whole for the golden one :/
---
"ex" i could never abandon them
---
Looping isn't remotely toxic. Any killer that says otherwise is inexperienced/new to the game or just a fool.  
---
Looping is core gameplay.  It's what you're supposed to do as a survivor.  Good luck surviving against red rank killers without looping knowledge.
---
Yeah, just booted it up on PS4. Patch 3.4.1:
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause a Survivor to fall out of world (from their perspective) when getting hooked.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause Survivors to fall through the ground to the floor below when dropped from the Killers shoulder.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause the wiggle UI to flicker when getting interrupted.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause the wiggle UI to disappear after being picked up and dropped.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause the wiggle UI to disappear when getting picked up by the Killer with a Survivor nearby.
---
The second challenge in Tome 3 is still hook people in the basement.
---
When I was doing that I was dragging people across the map for basement, and it's not like a bunch of people were in T3 before now.
---
Just explain after the match. If they knew about it, then put them on blast.
---
What's the basement bug?
---
It's all ogre now.
---
The flick is not meant to be implemented because it is way too powerful. It will be patched out.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Oh, well! I‚Äôm not too sure then! Idk what he meant by ‚Äúblimp‚Äù cause I‚Äôve never heard the term for anything lol. Sorry I‚Äôm no help xD
---
[Wiggle bar just not popping up](https://gyazo.com/98e73332e118b962605b4256c36597e1)
---
I often have the same problem, rly needs a fix asap
---
The same exact thing happened to me, but the brick is not an ebony mori, it's me when I decided to become a nurse main, 800 game hours ago.
---
technically theres weapons in this game if you count flashlights and pallets and persk like ds and head on
---
Eh. Fuck the gold one. That shit is tacky. 
---
I went with her purple hair, white sleeveless auric cell top and maroon pants.
---
It‚Äôs very rare to play a game with 3 randoms where the teamwork is so good like that, i haven‚Äôt seen that in so long i forgot that was a thing..
---
In my opinion, Trapper isn't viable at red ranks. Hag isn't much better, for me personally, either. You spend way too much time preparing and said preparation can be reset within seconds.
---
Also, fair. I have a lot of fun at rank 1, but that isn't what this post is about. It was more, certain play-styles, particularly going for achievements, is better done away from red ranks.
---
100% agree, I've been having a blast
---
Oh I didnt know. Well thanks for the knowledge
---
yeah, only once have I managed to get unstuck and that was only because a curious survivor got too close and I managed to down him. I used the pick up animation to get myself free. still, I let that survivor go that game as a sort of thanks for managing to keep myself in the game.
---
What is this basement bug anyway?
---
Note : The Oni facecamped me before the generators are completed.
---
Given the state of other games in this genre, BHVR devs have really done a magnificent job and like you said I m tired of this thanklessness that has become a norm among legion like teenagers on this sub.
---
The entitlement is the reason this community suck so much in and out of game.
---
try accepting and unaccepting til it rewards you, this happened to me on the unhook challenge. I had enough to meet the updated requirements after they did the rift hotfix, but hadn‚Äôt completed it bc I hadn‚Äôt achieved enough to do the original ones. I just had to toggle the challenge on and off twice. If that doesn‚Äôt work then you might need to submit a ticket.
---
There‚Äôs an add-in that causes mangled and it seems that you forgot about the deep wounds status effect.
---
Was just thinking about this in game. Thought I heard howling or something and thought that would be the coolest thing.
---
No fix on killers getting stuck inside gens?
---
I maintain that the Pig should be allowed to work on gens so she can trigger her RBTs by herself.
---
He doesn't get a "heartbeat." Instead it's Smash Mouth's All Star that get's louder and louder as he approaches.
---
Flair checks out
---
this hotfix has been the best so far
---
I hate the word "unfun" because it is abused by people who are shit at the game, but you do have a point. How about it injures if healthy, and makes you broken for X amount of seconds if already injured? The fact that survivors can maim themselves in the Billy box with no downside annoys me.
---
hoes mad
---
It can be pretty toxic. As a killer main, I get tea bagged constantly and get pretty brutal messages after the game. I literally got a message the other day from someone I sacrificed telling me to straight up kill myself. Its immature and unnecessary, but it makes you really appreciate the players who are actually friendly.
---
Prevents survivors from going to them at least.
---
Did i complain abt the bug? I want ppl to see this new animation lol
---
No it wasn‚Äôt. Feral Frenzy is the WORST ability in the game. It has 20 downsides to its 3 upsides, and overall even pressing the power button is a waste of time. The ONE thing it had was sloppy butcher and STBFL. That was quite literally the ONLY thing that made Feral Frenzy a slightly viable ability. Consistency is not important when it comes to balance. If a small double standard is the only thing keeping a killer from being useless then any competent balance team leaves it in until they make it so the character doesn‚Äôt rely on it anymore. Of course we all know the devs balance team has always been a sad joke so that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre having that conversation. Consistency is rarely important. Double standards are okay. It‚Äôs about asking: does this character need this double standard? Will making it consistent be a massive blow to this already bad character? If the answer to these questions are yes, you need to take a step back, and access why on EARTH is a character relying solely on a double standard, and actually fix the problem. It will never be justified to nerf an **F tier** killer (the worst killer in the game) for the sake of consistency.

---
Hmm, no fix for Oni getting stuck on generators I see. RIP.
---
Yeah, I agree 100%. That's so fuck-you-and-everything-you-do that I would DC everytime I see a Pig lol.
---
How would the game recognize it? Easy, proximity. The game already has several proximity features in it already. Not hard to make another undisclosed area of effect. 
---
Also, we need to stop spreading this false assumption that flash light clicking and tea bagging are somehow equal to face camping. Tea bagging and flashlight clicking does literally nothing to hinder the killers game. It doesn‚Äôt slow them down or alter their movement ability in the slightest. It‚Äôs a distraction, and if you let it get under your skin, that‚Äôs on you. Face camping however, 100% hinders the other persons game, because it means they literally can‚Äôt do anything (or at least, have extremely limited options). You see the difference? One is an annoyance that doesn‚Äôt actually DO anything if you ignore it, whereas one is being butthurt and forcing someone‚Äôs game to be essentially over. They are in no way ‚Äúequal‚Äù when it comes to trolling. The killer equivalent to tea bagging and clicking is shaking your head post hook, or tea bagging if you‚Äôre pig or Ghostface. 
---
Also, killing yourself on hook is a TERRIBLE selection for your team. If you‚Äôre on that hook getting camped, the killer HAS to stand there with you, and you give your team the option to do gens. You are occupying the killers time, and they WANT you to kill yourself on hook so your team will be greatly hindered and they can have an easier game.
---
Legion is very op with sloppy butcher. They either use a lot of time healing or they get insta downed when you next time see them.
---
Legion is like plague, but legion can run and patrol a lot more easily. Also legion can counter every exhauston perk. When they activate  exhauston you just catch up with them with frenzy.
---
Blessage.
---
Is this on all platforms?
---
Isn't that normal in this game?
---
I hardly ever play survivor. I‚Äôm a killer 99% of the time.
---
Love it, moris deserve to be punished.
---
I really want to be chased by lady lf but at the same time I never want to play against Bubba again.
---
All of them sadly
---
That glitch also happens in non basement hooks. Although looks like killers must hack into devs pc's to fix games for them. Because of course irs killers fault. No damn wonder you see eo many spirit's in red rqnks. You guys just a-holes Lmao. Sincerly jake main
---
You just got outplayed man, it‚Äôs just that simple.
---
This game's logic is insane. Every update,instead of fixing bugs,it gives us more of it
---
It's all killers. It just happened to me twice in a row as Ghostface
---
So sad, I hate when teammates don‚Äôt do actual teammate stuff!!! I‚Äôve been on the hook watching it unfold like this.
---
I will never stop telling people that they need to add the Wazzup mask as a cosmetic to ghostface. Just imagine turning around and seeing [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/417809978766786570/639991081034842125/9kw122dnyky21.jpg) stare back at your rank 20 dwight from around a corner.
---
this was only tangentially related. Sorry. great comic though! Dwight in that RBT kinda looks like [Nezuko from Demon Slayer](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/564/953/a6e.jpg) (with the bamboo mouth thing)
---
While it's unfortunate the basement bug happened in the first place, kudos to BHVR for taking proactive action to fix it this quickly.
---
Steam and PS4 first.  Xbox and Microsoft store later
---
Sorry that I'm new and I didn't understand what that meant.
---
Monto is what got me to the game btw. I like playing DBD not try harding. I play whatever killer I like, and I use whichever perk combination I like. I know other DBD pros who are better than him, but I like him for introducing fun play styles.
---
So from this post it's kinda sad to be informed that I won't be able to enjoy the game that way uo there cuz in the end it's not going to give me or the survivors a good time.
---
No bloodpoints for you billy
---
People said they wanted legion to be more like survivors.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
I think that for the sake of consistency the nerf was justified, but I think the whole community agrees that poor legion needs a rework
---
Basement bug? What is it? Ik about the wiggling thing- but not this
---
Yeah, got the update on PS4 just now
---
This ain‚Äôt special
---
So nothing done to those??
---
Medkit charge add-ons are not working  
---
Flashlight saves not working sometimes (killer regains control, looks up, gets blinded anyway, no save)  
---
All players in pre-lobby group chat have the same nickname color  
---
Doctor has power and add-on descriptions for his rework that wasn‚Äôt even announced yet  
---
Oni can hit through some walls  Nemesis + Whatever Chase (don‚Äôt remember the first part of the name, GF perk) combination doesn‚Äôt work as intended  
---
Some add-ons have wrong descriptions  Some players have lost their old event cosmetics  
---
You can have multiple obsessions when running Nemesis (get pallet stunned by one survivor and have the other flashlight blind you straight away)
---
Still didn't fix Iridescent age challenge.
---
Havent heard that before lol
---
Hey remember when you said "Two weeks, It's an official quote"
---
Well the patch is live already. What's that like.. 30 hours ? 
---
Hmm 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/110295/
---
This makes me so proud, great teamwork üëèüëè
---
No worries xD thanks
---
Wow a survivor patch that came as fast as the patch needed when survivors could use one of Quentin's perks to speed thru gens in 8 seconds. Thank you Devs!
---
Honestly padded jaws are better than Logwood dye
---
That remains to be seen. It depends on how good "static blast" is. I don't have much hope that they will actually shore up Doc's weaknesses without giving him new (worse) ones.
---
Well I already explained consistency isn‚Äôt important when the character is already garbage, and there is no justifying that. But hopefully they actually rework him soon though.
---
Unpopular opinion but I love those statues. They're so happy and make me feel like I have friends. üò≠
---
I basically told my teammates at the beginning of every game that I needed the challenge. Eventually I got a responsive 3 man swf that gen rushed then purposefully threw themselves at the killer so I could get an unhook.
---
Keep trying, teamwork will save you.
---
Make him play a low tier killer, he cannot dodge when people join together, wear bright clothes or have items
---
same happened to me

People who nolife this game 24/7 especially because oni is out and awesome
---
People aren‚Äôt really saying he‚Äôs the trapper because of the trappers power, it‚Äôs because trappers design was clearly heavily influenced by Jason. Big bulky body, hockey like mask, cleaver that‚Äôs pretty close to a machete, hell trapper has a machete weapon skin. 
---
All that being said we have multiple killers that have the licensed one they were based on in game . Hillbilly was at least slightly influenced by Leatherface, legions story and design was influenced by Ghostface from scary movie. So adding Jason really wouldn‚Äôt be difficult
---
Maybe from the F13 game? One of his abilities in that game was to teleport to anywhere on the map.
---
He also was able to place traps, throw knifes, "blink", smash down windows and doors.
---
He even had a rage mode that would activate after a certain amount of time, making him do more damage and break through doors/walls faster.
---
Me neither. Actually excites me thinking we may continuously get more lines from as patches come out.
---
70 at the moment
---
Honestly if they ever add 2v8 mode Legion will actually be useful as a support to Oni. Get everyone injured for more globes.
---
If the killer was a dick all game and doesn't say gg after I escape, I hit him with the ez
---
However, if he does gg then I'll be a good sport too
---
Realistically nobody wants to give a toxic camper points though.
---
DBD players: Think the game is fine as is
---
BHVR: Let's buff ruin

DBD players: can't wait for the oni!

You give them points if you dc as well

i wouldnt even say this benefits swf, its just shit in general

Thanks, Steve

*laughs in brutal strength and a fetish for breaking pallets*
---
I'm currently learning Oni (I've played like 7 games and got a 4k every game) but I still feel like I got some things to learn before I try adept because I feel like my perks carry me
---
The last "new" one i heard was "are we gonna be here all day?" And i thought it was so funny
---
If you want to fix try, press M1 button when killer picks you up. It helped 2 times when i had the same issue.
---
\*pops\*
---
So you if you bring an offering for the game as killer because you‚Äôre using a stealth build and some survivor just says whatever I‚Äôll just throw on a haddonfield offering because I dont want to try this game and you get haddonfield instead of the game, it‚Äôs already a gg. How is that ok?
---
What was the post game chat? Did you mention it?
---
Correct, as far as I know, this bug wasn't on the public test beta and so it had to have happened to the changes made between the PTB and live release. As of now (Noon EST) a hotfix has already been pumped out to fix it.
---
Last night I played against oni and got hit when he was nowhere near me ;)
---
Honestly, if you feel that way, the best time to change that is now, before you get even higher and the games become unfun.
---
STOP! HE‚ÄôS ALREADY DEAD!
---
Sorry but you just described a regular hatch standoff lol
---
I know this post is a month old but A nea messaged me about not using my M1 as bubba
---
What does "Mori'd" mean? I haz noob.
---
If you would the link again could find it. Fixed the privacy.
---
Preach Dude!!
---
And talking about bugs, I used to work in IT department and have coded website. I wasted a whole night because a webpage was showing up blank despite having so much stuff on it. I looked and looked and every piece of javascript and PHP on it looked okay.
---
Around 5 am I found one of the insignificant piece of call for content wasn't closed because it didn't had a semicolon ( ; )
---
I wept. I wept to sleep.
---
Can't constantly criticize without giving props when due. Appreciate the speedy fix BHVR!
---
I mean my performance feels better now on pc, my frame rate is stable. This game is gonna need a whole code rehaul to run well on console.
---
If you got hooked there decent chance you fall into the void and cant see shit.
---
How is this cocky? seems more like hes just trying to beat him to punish him.
---
A stealth build is bad on Haddonfield? That‚Äôs one of the maps to actually use a stealth build on.
---
It‚Äôs a game of counters and chance. 
---
If everything was to be balanced and fair then killers and survivors should see what perks are being brought in before hitting ready.
---
Suggested nerf: the chainsaw now applies the deep woulds status effect instead of downing a survivor, when using your chainsaw lose 10% movement speed.
---
The main problem is that he just encourages players to facecamp too much imo
---
This is how hatch standoffs are meant to go. Nothing special about it.
---
Ayy
---
That's lame. I rarely see salt in DBD, but it does exist for sure. It's way worse in OW for sure.
---
Deep Wounds got nerfed so that the timer no longer goes down while **sprinting**.
---
You can get unhooked and run the entire map without going down now.
---
Spirit, Nurse and Billy are kinda good on any map. I think the Oni is good especially on big maps. I personally like Pig (oink)
---
you can also get stuck in Lockers with the same bug, i know this firsthand.
---
Its only endurable since Lockers can be interacted with again, freeing you
---
Sadly, that's true :( I stared and passed by the hooks and all but he didn't get the hint.
---
There was like a single gen left, but none were even being worked on. When I finally found one of them, he was on the other side of the map, with zero gens around it. Cue attempted transport, which failed miserably.

---
I think there is missing about a 0.01% so it isn‚Äòt finished
---
Thank fuck it didnt take 2 weeks. Thanks guys.
---
its also not 100% chance. i tested it one game hooked everyone in the basement multiple times and only one person got the glitch
---
I don't play with anyone either. Just ridin' solo.
---
Well I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still able to like him despite the many changes to him. I hope you stick with him
---
It‚Äôs 10/10
---
Hotfix gamebreaking bugs, break archives in the process OMEGALUL
---
Basement and wiggle are the biggest bugs in this patch so i guess these are coming later on.
---
I rage so hard when this shit happens to me when i'm the killer lol.
---
I play well with others since I sacrifice myself so people can escape but people just call me a noob
---
Break the game how?
---
If they copy team fortress 2 spy power even swf could be tricked.
---
That‚Äôs me as ghostface
---
this is the big dick energy we love to see from survivors. teamwork makes the dream work.
---
Plague would still be better since you either feed Oni his power or give Plague hers.
---
I FAILED my comp sci final and still passed the course with a really good grade (god bless teachers who understand) it just blows my mind when people complain non stop on bugs. 
---
The really bad ones I get, but ptb was pretty badddddd this time around and they fixed a lot of the bugs. If they hotfix the killer carrying audio bug and basement bug, we are in the clear.
---
Coding is so finicky, bugs are just the literallll worst but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse, when it doesn‚Äôt compute or when it does and it‚Äôs just a hot mess
---
Yes same it reverted the challenge to the old "deplete 8 key"
---
Because your way you let the assholes walk all over you.
---
How do you get legacy skins
---
Every tip here is valid and well thought out. Good job. New players read or watch this because everything here is true.
---
That's what I was thinking. It honestly seems pretty fair. Imo a good game for everyone is two dead two survived.
---
Daddy Oni T H I C C
---
Nah I'd rather disconnect, thanks but no thanks.
---
In all seriousness though, to point #6, certain killers like Plague and Leatherface, with their abilities, can technically down multiple survivors at once. Super hard to do and the survivors are pretty much asking for it at that point, but not technically impossible.
---
&gt; made them better in the chase
---
Important clarification, but only made them better in the chase while using Feral Frenzy. Which doesn't let you down survivors. Very minimal buff.
---
Always lynch survivor claims
---
The only thing I would change is make his chainsaw charge work like Billy‚Äôs, it‚Äôs super confusing switching between them
---
I agree that we should be graded better on things other than deaths. But I dont think making kill rates go down is a good answer..
---
Lol sorry I meant scream but my brain is fried from lack of sleep XD
---
I mean, it lets you get to where you need to be, and you can body block any pallet or window and then undergo your stun. I‚Äôd say the stun duration could be made a bit shorter, and then it‚Äôd be a solid buff
---
Imagine this as a specific sound when grabbing Survivors out of Lockers
---
The second the Killer start to swing the Doors open:
---
someBODY once told me \[...\]
---
You don't. Not anymore. You could have gotten them three years ago for some time, but since then there has been no way of aquiring these...
---
Entitled survivor mains
---
Yeah, I agree with you honestly. I just don't like Whispers personally. I wrote that when I was in a pretty shit mood, so it sounded a bit aggressive and condescending.
---
I know that the devs said they ruled out Killers that can mimic survivors, but I like the idea of Legion being able to hide in plain sight by becoming a survivor for a few seconds.
---
How it'd work: When Legion hits a survivor, they gain the ability to transform into said survivor for 5 or 10 seconds. While disguised, the Legion will have no terror radius or red stain, basically looking like a normal survivor. He also is able to vault pallets and windows like a survivor would. They can also interact with gens, but will regress them instead of repairing them. Legion is able to come out of Survivor mode at any time by using the attack button.
---
I feel this would fit Legion's theme more, and could allow for some good mindplays if used right.
---
excuse me. what the actual fuck.
---
My criticism is why the pink hair. That is the T O X I C nea flagship hair!!!!1!1!1! 
---
No but this drawing is cute, doodles are always good for the brain
---
Don't go down near the basement then lmao
---
Legacy nurse and legacy nea here, who I gotta help?
---
Can someone explain?
---
Michelle Myers is my waifu
---
hahahah make sense, I was gonna kick ur ass if you told me Scary movie is the official franchise.
---
Yeah, a lot of people seem to think that four dead or four survived is the only outcome of dbd. And honestly, depending on how your count it there are at least 3 ways to "win". There are some wacky things here and there but all in all the game is in a pretty good place balance wise, at least the best it's been at for a while  (with some outliers, ie legion)
---
Holy shit that's insane. I wonder how fast those bars were going... But what's the point really, if the game last 20 seconds then everyone got cucked out of anything more than a handful of blood points.
---
If you're referring to perks or a killer and their abilities then no they are not rightful complaints.
---
Wait, what glitch was being abused here? It just sounds like you hooked her as usual, nothing seems glitchy about that? Is there something with the basement hooks that makes them different?
---
wait you are saying this was not a swf team.
---
well thats gives me hope again. because mostly i get left behind when i do all the work.
---
like today got chased for 5 gens and protected the exit gate got noed and theybleft me to die all of them . still it wont stop me to help people but knowing one day there is one person at least what would do the same just makes it better.
---
*gets hit with pallet*
---
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed...
---
"Why is it always you four?"
---
I love ghostface so much.   
---
The amount of funny moments he gives this game is insane
---
Bugged for me aswell, and also for a lot of other people right now
---
If it gets the job done, it gets the job done
---
Grabs on gens suck but pallets and windows became hellllllla unsafe on dedicated due to killer authority so both ways. It‚Äôs just how the interactions work :/

Dude Devour Hope and face camping, ultimate big brain plays right here
---
Man, I gotta get some of ya'll to teach me how to play Legion. I've actually been doing better with it since its "nerf". I don't even have the right perks to really make it fun either.
---
The devs want the game balanced around a 50% kill rate, for that to happen, kill rates WILL have to come down.  You don't necessarily have to nerf killers to do it either.
---
I played a few games as him on console, he‚Äôs fun but hard to get more than 1 or 2 kills at rank 5-6.
---
Me too...
---
This pissed me off yesterday, I'm glad someone else noticed it. I had a syringe and an addon for 16 extra charges, I went to heal myself and it depleted the medkit after one use.
---
Camping is NOT a good thing. but you wanted to secure the kills and please the entity so...i probably would‚Äôve done the same thing. (Plague Main)
---
The devs don't really play their own game at all. They'll very rarely do it as a publicity thing, but I think they stopped doing even that. It was fun seeing them play with streamers, and actually speak their honest opinions.
---
Ok possibly, but then make it 2v6
---
Biggest of the brains. I was surprised to see his rank. With that play i expected Green. Maaaaaaybe purple lol.
---
I get it but still no excuse to be toxic. I had a super frustrating game like that last night (actually a couple, first night playing vommy mommy) and I had a down by the exit gates. Picked him up, started walking to the hook and decided screw it, they ran circles around me all game, I'll depip anyways.

How?  Like you said, I‚Äôm not going to report them or send salty, bitter messages.  So to them, it doesn‚Äôt even matter what I think.  I could think they‚Äôre the worst person to ever live and it won‚Äôt do shit about their behavior.  The *only* thing that changes based on my opinion of them is... my mood.  So being forgiving means I feel better, which (since we‚Äôre playing a game that‚Äôs theoretically for fun) is the goal.  Why get bitter and angry over a situation I have no power to change?
---
&gt;I would love if they skiped a chapter to rework some things. But since it's never happening, we just have to wait.
---
Mid Chapter patches are specifically made to rework "some things". They don't have to skip a chapter release.

fully deplete key archive challenge is bugged. while in lobby its says 8. but in archive its 3, and  u cant claim reward after depleting 3 keys.
---
The epitome of the Reddit Killer mindset right here
---
This happened to me once so far but not by my own fault. (not entirely at least) the killer was laggy af (and since the killer is the host i was too) and i dropped the pallet behind me and 1s later teleported back in front of the pallet and got killed for it.
---
I didnt pay for the rift frankly i dont want to cuz its not free to play game otherwise i would tho the rift seems really lackluster if u arent paying for it they could easly put some bloodpoints on those empty levels because atm they are really lackluster for a player that doesnt want to buy the pass
---
I completed them after the patch not before. Look at the post right above mine, someone else has that with another challenge, seems like they messed them all up.

Pretty sure its random
---
Just did that one last week against Freddy.  
---
I was desesperately praying for the gates to be far enough, never thought I'd get it on red.
---
Tbh new legion isn't fun for survivor either, IMO. It's just an annoying grindfest of mend timers and watching the killer gimmick their power. Easily the least fun killer to play against in my opinion.
---
Like The Great Never from The Neverland
---
I wish I had teammates like that
---
Well. A new hotfix just rolled out. Game is playable
---
Ok problem solved i don't know why but i automatically recieved now the reward
---
I Just played 2 games and got 2 emblems. Tho I get 2 and 3 on the endscreens.
---
Man I'm so glad this is all fixed, thanks so much BHVR! Has the escape 5 times challenge has reverted back to escape 10 times for anyone else?
---
it‚Äôs satire my dude
---
Dec 16th I believe
---
That‚Äôs what I was worried about lol
---
I think is more of a visual bug in my case
---
indoor map maybe ?
---
only the Survivor bugs are fixed :(
---
I dread playing against the o I for the first time once I get on DBD tonight because he looks fucking terrifying. He‚Äôs HUGE.
---
Ok thanks
---
I havent encountered any Killer Bugs so far
---
I'm having the same issue with the Obsession challenge.
---
Its deplete mission so yes you have to use them fully. I used green keys with aura reading ability. But be carefull killler may try to tunnel you for key.
---
Ok let me rephrase. You're letting the assholes walk all over you and you don't care.
---
Eh, I 4k every game in red ranks with him so I'm not so sure about that

---
Where?
---
no u
---
Yup, both sides have people who DC, I'm not denying that. In my experience I've had killers DC when they've been chasing the same survivor for all five gens. 
---
I've also had survivors I've been paired with DC at the most ridiculous times. At the end of their phase 2 on the hook, downed after all 5 gens repaired. I just don't get the point. At least get a few BPs, take the loss, and move on.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Okay so FULLY use one...
---
I think most would agree that this makes total sense. It's a good middle-ground between the suggested options. I'll add it to OP.
---
I was playing basement Bubba yesterday for fun and it never happened to me. I didn't even hear about it until a few hrs ago
---
I just listed stuff that was still there and from those the only one I really care about is the medkit charges one
---
I can tell you now proximity would not work well since killers don‚Äôt need to be right in front of the hook to camp they just need to be near it. Killers are already being penalized for being near the hook anyway. 
---
As to the second point both are unenjoyable experiences that‚Äôs the reason I brought it up. As a killer if I want someone to die I should be able to make sure they die whether it be through a mori, camping, tunneling, or regular play. All of these are valid methods yes some of them are not enjoyable to the survivor but they are valid and the killer should be able to do them.
---
 It‚Äôs not fun going against swf but it‚Äôs a valid way for them to play, it‚Äôs not fun going against flashlight clickers and tbaggers but it‚Äôs not against the rules. As killer you suck it up and power through or dc those are the options. As survivors you can kill yourselves on hook, dc, or power through those are the options. 
---
Idk why keep bringing up how it‚Äôs bad for the team if someone kills themselves on hook. The op was talking about how people dc if a killer is camping them and how they can‚Äôt do that anymore , the people that did that don‚Äôt give a shit about their team anyway so now they‚Äôll just kill themselves on hook instead that‚Äôs why I made the comment. In fact anybody who‚Äôs played this game long enough knows it‚Äôs better that they have to kill themselves on hook instead of just dcing.
---
Now that‚Äôs a speedy hotfix! Well done Devs!
---
Who is this bitch lmao
---
So the killer messaged u after the game ??
---
Totally doesn‚Äôt happen to me every match... *haha*
---
Good point
---
Even worse with hook in the basement chalenges
---
Am I the only getting huge deja vu vibes from this? I'm sure I've read this exact thread a few months ago
---
Usually I find it before them or they find it before me. It‚Äôs more rare for me to have a showdown there.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I think vaulting at normal speed is a Legion thing, it would be hard for BHVR to add it. But I think they might be open to add the option of breaking pallets with the dash, at least as an addon.
---
He's probably a comfortable upper-mid. What makes Billy top tier is that he can rev up and go whenever. Oni requires you to get a few hits first, and if you fail to snowball, it's gonna be a little while before you can get going again. He has absolutely nothing going for him until he transforms.
---
I cannot stand how loud he is LOL. I was trying to get him a cosmetic and ended up just going back to menu because I couldn't take his ear-splitting rage screams
---
My monitor has a built in targeting reticule in the center that I've started using specifically to break Ghostface out of stealth.

No? I 4k at red ranks every game with him
---
Does PC even have a tutorial? I don't remember this being a thing and I started only a few months ago.
---
Gens would get done way too fast.
---
How is applying gen slowdown sweaty? I'm not that experienced at the game or anything but that's like survivors saying "nah I wont do this gen its too sweaty". Forever Freddy fair enough, but ruin and pop etc I don't see.
---
Playing on Xbox and I'm doing fine with him, and I'm kinda can do the flick with his power, not on the same level as pc but usually it works
---
No one's getting banned lol. There was challenges regarding getting basement hooks. Be mad at the devs not the people just using what should be a regular hook.
---
Props for the quick fix, literally all of these things happened to me last night while playing Survivor.  Like every other game someone was just exiled in the basement, I got dropped through the Mt. Ormond lodge couch and bled out, was quite the clusterfuck.

Omg LOL. So instead of removing legion like everyone originally wanted and admitting they did a bad, they just make him the new freddy so he literally doesnt get played. Lmao that's brilliant.
---
Auto-aim isn't completely to blame, but keep a close eye and you'll notice that sometimes when you swing at a survivor it "jitters" or tries to magnetize to the spot they were heading towards rather than where they are.
---
I've come to the conclusion it's the same thing that sometimes pulls PC players into walls, but on console the pull looks a *lot* stronger because it seems like it doesn't account for the extra speed whatsoever. I can't describe it, just like the aim assist is trying to aim at a ghost and you have to force it to go where you want it. It happens way too much to be just me.
---
Well Im rank 3 so I cant get much higher really
---
How so?

Why is this true...

Crap, Ill just see myself out...

---
May be a dick move, but you can‚Äôt take chances in this town.
---
True! I was Christmas Sweater Bill the other night, hiding in a bush right in front of the Oni hooking another survivor. He didn't even see me at all (and he looked around too)
---
Yes that was my original point and now I‚Äôm having to debate other topics lol
---
Not necessarily, they could just increase gen time then
---
Welp, from just looking at that image you got there they look hard to read.

Ahhhhhh looks like they managed to shank legion in every place possible

Welp, time to play feng!

Bhvr isnt a large company. They dont even have a publisher.

No come back.

Just... no. Imagine 6 survivors working on gens while 2 survivors loop the killers for the entire game. It wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

no, you just dont know how to run a survivor around the map properly.

---
David King spreading his arms in a literal T pose when he crouches...
---
The idea is not to get more head pops, but merely to make survivors spend more time in Billy boxes, push the average number of searched boxes more towards 2/3 than 1/2. RBTs should be kept as stalling tools.
---
I agree that we shouldn't feel the need to run M&amp;A on a stealth killer.
---
I think thats an absolutely fine decision. If you see 2 keys coming into the game you are absolutely allowed to counter that. And if you had to camp in the end thats just bad luck for the survivors aswell. Overall if the bill didnt run towards the hatch it would not have happened so it was a bad play aswell. If the bill didnt know the hatch was there then its bad luck. Cheers.
---
That's not a bug, that's just hitboxes.
---
Yes like any killer you can 4K every game especially if you play that killer every game. But you have to admit she still needs a buff no matter what especially when you compare her to nurse, spirit, Freddy and ghostface
---
Iridescent Head?
---
I'm back.
---
May as well be GG when they start cleansing
---
Possibly..? I talk about legions problems a lot. I usually have the same talking points because many people share the same opinions on why the legion shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed. It‚Äôs usually something like ‚Äúhe made me miserable on launch so he should stay dead!‚Äù Or a misunderstanding of what makes the Legion bad. Like ‚ÄúI get 4K‚Äôs consistently so therefore legion must be fine‚Äù so most of my taking points discuss the flaws with the power, since that‚Äôs what‚Äôs normally up for debate. However the topic of this debate was about whether or not consistency matters for balance. Since you claim to have seen something similar a few months ago I don‚Äôt think it could have been me because I didn‚Äôt discuss these nerfs until they were revealed a few weeks ago. I might have been discussing pigs change but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually gone into debate with anyone about her.
---
Even the Survivors with deep Wounds forget about the deep Wounds status effect.
---
Oni is very difficult to use on console, and with such a short range attack...
---
*plag
---
They upgrade their power for a brief moment after you cleanse making it much harder to not go down
---
I can hear this image.
---
Ya PWYF has the qualifier of 'offensive actions', not 'basic attack'.

If the survivors get offended you lose a stack of PWYF.

It's a flashy way for the killer to finish you off without hooking you. It can only be done with certain perks addons and offerings
---
Pig effortlessly carrying David and slinging him onto a meat hook isn‚Äôt realistic, nor is a survivor taking a chainsaw to the chest and being okay after having their back rubbed for 16 seconds. This game isn‚Äôt balanced around realism.
---
But we all hide, well atleast I hide, when she came around. So it was like another haunted grounds moment just with range.
---
Yesterday I caught up to a survivor camping a pallet.
---
On the wrong side.  
---
Facing the opposite direction, where he thought I was coming from.  
---
I stabbed him and he then dropped the pallet on the wrong side.
---
Me too, whenever they fix 1 bug, 4 new ones come up. It's getting annoying tbh
---
My soul was always yours daddy entitty üòòüò≥
---
Only had it happen once in my games. No complains besides that, the bugs in this game are weird...
---
Nemesis brought back old legion when he was stunned by pallet. Devs nerfed Deep Wounds just before the patch update so nemesis doesn't affect deep wounds.

I‚Äôm both surprised and ecstatic that Behavior was able to fix the basement glitch this fast.
---
Or just something other than FUCKING GENS
---
I've queued about 20 oni games today and played against half that if not more
---
Come join us on PC, it's literally haunted like a motherfucker
---
Nothing but oni
---
Now I can go back to my fun basement builds without survivors crying saying I'm going to get banned. What am I saying they'll always cry and say that with or without a bug.
---
Yeah, Amanda is one of the only killers that really provides a secondary objective, which is the biggest issue we all have in DbD. It's really necessary to make it more reliable.
---
You guys are actually convincing me that removing her ability to see box auras is actually necessary for balancing.
---
If they remove his shock stun, my boy doc is dead in the water.
---
Hiding is only so affective. Whoever she finds is basically screwed
---
Why would you run OHK perks on a killer with a OHK power?
---
You have a good point. I think the best ideas are the ones that force survivors to spend a bit more time searching Billy boxes.
---
I'm starting to think that removing her ability to see box auras is necessary for this. It might be a good change.
---
Yeah it does. It's in the help and tutorials section
---
Billy is useless on Lery‚Äôs, The Game, and Hawkins.
---
Why dont I ever get this, they always let me 1 hook die. Getting chased by the killer the whole match should give me way more than a measly 8k or so bp.
---
But your post said "so nothing done to.." and then you listed off a bunch of things, like you expected them to be dealt with too. I think most of us would rather get a quick response to the most serious things, and then let them work on the rest. The response from BHVR on this one was actually pretty good.
---
I was playing Pig in The Game (quite coincidental) and I downed a Nea who was going for a pallet but didn‚Äôt actually drop it, I assume it was a mistake. I pick her up, go to the other side of the pallet and then a Laurie comes from behind and drops the pallet thinking it would stun me but, since I was already on the other side, it didn‚Äôt and she just stared at me while I went to hook the downed Nea I was carrying hahahahaha I kinda felt bad though
---
honestly there‚Äôs no right way to do it if you‚Äôre going against a skilled plague.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with Nurse‚Äôs Calling? Do you not have it?
---
*GET OUT ME SWAMP!*
---
I watched this clip on mute, but in my head when she got grabbed I heard the, "DENIED" voice line.
---
I have a habit of reading "experienced survivor" as "entitled survivor" and reading through these perks completely justifies it
---
It would just create an uncounterable situation when you stack on the fact that you have a timer ticking down your death, the pig herself capable of denying you the boxes at any time, and being unable to escape through the gates until you get it off, adding on top of that of needing to damage yourself can make for super easy cheese and elimination of a survivor if the pig exploits all these facts.
---
It's akin to moonwalking legion, may not be the most effective and the killer still may lose, but it gives the survivor no option but to die.
---
&gt;  I get tea bagged constantly
---
Tea bagging and taunting is on a completely different level than telling somebody to kill themselves. If you get mad at something as innocent as tea bagging I cant imagine how many holes youve punched in your wall.
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
Yeah, I have been thinking about this for a while and I read many opinions on what should be done, and then I saw some patterns. I think we can come up with a consensus set of possible solutions that are feasible and not too oppressive. It would be nice to be able to do this as a community and then talk to BHVR about it.
---
I'm sorry that I did not quote the sources of the suggestions, but I couldn't remember where I read most of them. But I hope you all still feel included in it.
---
Yes they have but a chapter skip would make the game better in general. Some killers seriously need or a total rework (Legion) or a partial rework (Leatherface or Clown). There are so many dead perks that need some love too. And some maps need to be reworked. If they skiped for example the next chapter, they would have 6 months to work only in the game health without worrying about fixing the new killer/new perks/new bugs. 
---
Not saying that they not care about the game or something. Just stating my opinion
---
It was the corn field map
---
If you read some of the other comments I say that a 6v2 might fare better, besides if you can't end chases you need to get better it's simple
---
Because if you're not running add-ons on LF his power almost doesn't matter
---
Just get a chairing game bro.
---
I've heard this argument many times about Disconnecting and it holds no value. Just because you can doesn't mean you should 5head
---
I think that's a very good suggestion. I'll add it to OP.
---
tfw they feed the most unconvincing troll in existance fucking reddit.exe
---
They need to reward proper gameplay. Give more points for juggling survivors to discourage camping and tunneling. Strengthen emblems for just hooking multiple survivors rather than sacrificing only a couple. Give killers a reason to do this stuff. If the killer is still an ass after all of that though, they're probably beyond help.
---
Freddy works on every map.  Freddy works on every map without addons.  Freddy works on every map against swf without addons.  Freddy is amazing lol.  Try you some Freddy.
---
This is my first time hearing about this glitch
---
yes! it would be great, they just need to fix the many bugs they have right now ; _ ;
---
Most people don't even know about the bug, there's also a challenge about hooking people in the basement.
---
You can be stuck on gens
---
Sure, but what if there are 2 survivors who are god tier at looping? 4 survivors all working on gens at the same time is still way too strong.
---
Have you heard nurse's footsteps? Rumors says that it was so loud that the entity decided that she would be better off just floating. 
---
100% canon
---
That interaction doesn't work anymore since deep wound doesn't go down while sprinting now.
---
I suppose I don‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs a game, caring too much isn‚Äôt healthy.  I‚Äôll play the way I want to play and if things don‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll just move on to the next game.  Why should I care?
---
i just went on a match with a killer who did this intentionally, i feel like they should get punished for exploiting the worst glitch ever
---
Its december 18th
---
It‚Äôs a build to play and win. It slows the game down as much as possible to where it makes it a lot easier to 4K since gens will take much longer to fully repair.
---
Lesbian Claudettes are the best
---
I was playing Overwatch with a random group I teamed up with. Our first game was 4 smurf accts with diamond-lvl SR in their respective roles, a top 500 Orisa, and a GM Tracer main. I don't usually get salty at that game, but that was fucking brutal. It's like the game is built for salt
---
Watching people lose their absolute shit over this and tear each other's throats out in the comments is top-tier entertainment. Suddenly everyone is a software engineer who knows better than all the other software engineers here.
---
&gt;  Some killers seriously need or a total rework (Legion) or a partial rework (Leatherface or Clown).
---
Just because you think this or some part of the community think this, doesn't mean the devs agree... Get the picture? 
---
So yeah, they won't skip anything because they know better on how to balance their game and which characters need "fixing" or not.
---
I've never had it with anyone else, but I know that hitting a survivor got me out once, but good luck having someone do that.
---
What if I hooked someone in the basement for challenges and then after I exit from DBD, I come to find out about this glitch/bug. Am I still an asshole/trash guy?
---
Then I suppose they deserve the win, yeah? Like they're good at the game and the killer isn't, then if the killer is smart he'll adapt and learn instead of infiltrating Reddit and complaining about entitled survivors. With this I mind I understand your point, so as compromise disallow SWF capabilities
---
Now the medkit bug please. Can‚Äôt use add ons anymore because they don‚Äôt effect the medkit.
---
love ohmwrecker
---
No. That‚Äôs *2* survivors being good at the game. The other 4 just have to be able to hit skill checks and hide, and that‚Äôs it.
---
That could help, seeing as a Pig camping the Billy boxes is no different from just camping hooked survivors imo.
---
I also wouldn't be against the traps themselves adding more status effects to survivors, whether or not through add-ons, to give the pig more slowdown and also incentivize survivors to get traps off.
---
Maybe even give the pig some kind of % buff per trapped survivor to encourage her to go after all of them and not just tunnel the 1 survivor she trapped over and over.
---
It was fine. If the jake had a key there was a chance that they could still get out if he ran to the hatch and jumped in
---
I respect your opinion as well as Scorpionz, but it's undeniably in the minority. The same could be said about several killers who are considered weak. Lot's of streamers consistently 4K with Leatherface, Legion, Clown etc. in red ranks, but I think that fact speaks more about the impressive skills of people who spend thousands of hours in this game dedicated to a few specific characters rather than the killers themselves.
---
Being toxic vs. Using a bug in game that prevents a gamer from enjoying or even playing the game at all.
---
Doesn't sound hypocritical at all /s
---
Jake was busy looking for hatch, idk if he saw me by the hook and dipped or if he just gave up on Bill but I found him across the map lol
---
Tyler1, previous LoL streamer, emotionally unstable dude with admittedly hilarious rages
---
True. Killers have some though like Legion‚Äôs newest skin, it‚Äôs bright as heck
---
Heard this referred to earlier with someone using that excuse for abusing the basement hook glitch. Their logic was that it didn't matter if they were abusing a game breaking bug. "It's in the game, so it's fair."
---
No changes in game for doc only the addons description change
---
Archive Bug on PC Steam: I have done the Deplete 3 Keys mission, but it doesnt allow me to complete it and get the BP's to continue to the next mission. I even depleted a 4th key and activated the mission a few times.
---
Whomst‚Äôde‚Äôve is Joe?
---
The problem is that the people who don't read the patch notes also won't read this.
---
Same! I thought the Mori aspect was interesting as the teammate was looking. It‚Äôs as if the other survivor was talking smack at the other survivor lol
---
You're right. I fixed it in OP to "changes".
---
Yeah, but hooking people in the basement is the best place to hook someone. It wouldn't be taking advantage of a bug for an advantage it's simply playing the game with a possibility of a bug happening that they should have hot fixed within a day or two of realizing the bug exists like most online games do with major bugs that completely break game play.
---
They can define what an exploit however they want but in the end they can't ban people for things like this because they are simply playing the game and might not even know it's a bug at all.
---
Edit: that's why no one got banned for using wake up and during that entire time it was bugged almost everyone used it without fear of repercussions.
---
For feng min as an example when you get her to level 30 by putting bloodpoints into her web you get something on the web called a teachable (technician), it's orange. When you unlock it it then has a chance to show up in other webs. 35 is lithe 40 is alert. Same applies to every character with their perks. When it comes to leveling all the characters their omly differences are their person perks and minor stuff like how they sound if they're loud or quiet generally and if their model is small or big. If you level a character only that character has stuff unlocked.
---
There‚Äôs also the tutorial mode for killer and survivor that also awards you with starting blood points so you can get some levels put on any character you want
---
Can you hotfix the legion nerfs as well?
---
Exerting that dominance ü§£
---
Just because a killers scary doesn‚Äôt stop them being shit. The doctor is, imo, one of the scariest killers to face with the initial jumpscare and later ones, as well as the tenacity of his skill checks. But he‚Äôs still pretty ass to play. I tried PS4 one earlier, aiming with his weapon is a bitch and with the console settings I can‚Äôt do dick. Would rather play someone I have a chance wigh
---
U get transported to cripps realm where he packs up the camps.

Probably in the same tier as huntress, good but not great.

&gt;I am bored of this discussion already.

I wonder why... BHVR won't give you something, just because you keep saying everything is fine.
---
Once the exit gates are powered, you gain the HASTE status effect for 120 SECONDS.
---
Brad the stacks
---
Sweet. So it‚Äôs in my best interest to become adept with every character
---
imagine how incredibly unintelligent people have to be to downvote this comment. xd
---
This is true! We need more bright flashy skins for killers. The halloween ones are a good start.  
---
~~Halloween Oni next year, BHVR please???~~
---
* Plus theres the perks
---
* people suicide on first hook
---
* how long ruin stayed up for if there was a ruin
---
* the map 
---
*  the rng of said map
---
* The map when paired with x, y or z killer
---
So many variables, and given how long red rank survivor queues are and how often high purple ranks get paired with 4 red survivors, It doesn't feel like many enjoy killer in red ranks
---
Lmao nice
---
When there was the wake up glitch, people used it freely.  
---
Now killers are supposed to ignore the basement because it might bug people out?
---
Nice, I saw that as I was reading through the how to play guide
---
Ah, console still suffers
---
They said on Twitter that that‚Äôs from restarting their backend and it should be fixed now when you restart the game.
---
You're still playing with idiots. I 4k constantly with every killer in red ranks, it doesn't mean they're good; this includes legion in his current state.
---
When survivors play well, and know they can just.. turn and you can't hit them, you get fucked.
---
&gt;I generally try to never just tunnel one person
---
"tunneling" is just a complaint people who aren't stealthy have.  It's just like the players who hang around hooks and then say you're camping.
---
Well, it is pretty shitty if a killer downs the first players and just stands in front of them until they die. Seen plenty of killers do that.
---
The map looks like hell for huntress lol the statues will be your best friend in chase in her. I had 3 onis and 2 spirits rage quit.
---
Encouraging her to trap a different person is a good thing. We could discuss that a bit more.
---
I don't really agree that it's sweaty, but I would say it's less fun to run those sort of builds. Like you can run other really good perks as part of your build and depending on the killer run a somewhat unique one that may only be doable on that killer, but you can also just run the classic gen slowing build with things like PGTW, Ruin, etc.
---
Done this so many fucking times, Jesus
---
I could've sworn this was in the files, but this is the first time I've heard it in game
---
So true
---
&gt;I wonder why... BHVR won't give you something, just because you keep saying everything is fine.
---
Things won't be fine for "forum killers" until they can consistently 4k at 5 gens every single game.
---
I‚Äôm on the PAL-LET TO HELL.
---
And give survivors option to hook the Legion.
---
Does nobody how businesses work? You had people on here freaking out that I could take two weeks. You under promise and over deliver and that‚Äôs what they did. They gave the two weeks in case something came up even though realistically they were going to get it done sooner.
---
I raise my glas to all the killers who do this
---
Next nerf they gonna remove his knife and make him punch the survivors
---
7 hits = injured
---
20 hits = dying state
---
Good job wasting the time and effort of 5 people
---
Are the servers not down for you?
---
Same thing happened to me when I downed a Feng. They ran up to me though, so I'm pretty sure this isn't unintentional
---
How does beware allow bugs like this to go live all of the time? Do they have any idea how to test a patch before pushing it out?
---
He is not gonna cry, don't worry lol
---
If anything it was a buff. With the right build you‚Äôll be like speedy Gonzales when vaulting during FF. You can use things like bamboozle and body blocking to break loops that were once super annoying. It‚Äôll also allow you to push people into dead zones. Also wounding every survivor is flat out easier from the speed and vaulting buffs, which is great when you use something like thanataphobia.
---
You can still use SB and STBFL, since you‚Äôre still going to hit survivors in general. It just won‚Äôt be as easy to get stacks or apply SB. I‚Äôll take breaking loops over those 2 any day though.
---
Oh and if you DW someone with DS they won‚Äôt be able to hide in lockers for invincibility anymore. So they‚Äôll go down, and it slows the game down more.
---
Do people seriously dodge when players join with bright clothes? I have a lot of colorful cosmetics and it feels like I have to find new lobbies every other time because the killer leaves. I solo queue and it‚Äôs super annoying.
---
I literally spoke negativelly about a nerf to balanced landing. Are you really going to bring that argument of me not caring about the other side?
---
Clown isnt played as much because he cant stop survivors from doing gens that effectivly. If hes on big map he suffer, but i still like him.
---
Heavy Duty would be the worst thing to ever grace this game like dear god imagine the length of stuns plus a speed boost like you would not be able to catch survivors
---
Aggressively hitting the poor flowers on the ground
---
If the killer is stuck in a gen simply tapping the gen (so they can do the kicking animation again which resets their position) should do the trick.
---
I did but it's still giving the same message üò¢
---
only $399! That's a great price!
---
If you‚Äôre playing survivor
---
*run* 
---
*(bass drops)*
---
Tbh the fact that they made it so that perks like STBFL dont work with feral frenzy was a huge nerf on his part
---
Thank you for that clarification! I Genuinely did not know why clown isnt played that much üòÑ
---
The Yui yeeteth, the Ghostface yoinketh away
---
Oh 2018. mb
---
Interesting. This may have happened to me possibly. Killer trapped me by a rock after the gates opened and then just waited for the timer to end and the entity to pop up and scorpion shot my brain.
---
oh well that's good at least
---
Are you going to play killer or survivor more? :)
---
Man, I gotta learn how to play Legion better then. I did better in every game I played with him last night than before the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù. Must be because I use FF to cut off angles too much and slow the game down. Hopefully when I get perks like Bamboozle and BBQ I‚Äôll feel the nerf more.
---
Just give her the PTB status back. It breaks my heart to see vommy mommy in this stupid mid tier hell just a couple of QoL changes away from being a terrifying goddess again.
---
A bug doesn't count for the "it's in the game so it's alright" argument LULW wtf
---
I love OW as a great plug and play quick PvP FPS experience, but if the goal is to really grind, it is hard out there. I play DBD on PC and OW on PS4. I'm not sure how the PC OW community is but I've abandoned team chat outside of my friend group for more than a year now...
---
You know how when you get hit by the killer, there is a blood splat coming out of your back?
---
That bug made it so the blood splatter played indefinitely. Plus every time the wraith with sloppy (or blind warrior add on) hit you, it would add on top of the previous one. By the end of the match people would be like walking fountains with 4/6 sprays going at all times. This would also severely drop your fps as survivor, many people couldnt really play the game.
---
To expand slightly on the other comment, the killer will actually murder the survivor while they're on the ground, rather than pick them up and carry them to a hook.
---
This ability to "kill a survivor by your own hand" was originally only enabled by one of the "Memento Mori" killer offerings, which is why people call the act a "mori". They later added certain addons and perks that could also allow a killer to "mori" if certain conditions were met.
---
Not really. I know others are disagreeing but it frustrating from a killer stand point of not being able to get someone due to body blocking.
---
Cause he has been buffed. The DW change actually makes it so survivors can‚Äôt hide in lockers if they have DS and you apply the wounds. With the right perks, like bamboozle and fired up you can cut off a lot of loops survivors use to kite legion.
---
Look at all those downvotes. It‚Äôs almost like killers are knowingly exploiting the game breaking bug, and don‚Äôt like being called out for it. üôÑ
---
Not really abusing it but we have rift challenges involving the basement.
---
That‚Äôs the games way to get rid of toxic survivors, if they get downed once the game will take them out so they don‚Äôt have to themselves
---
Well BHVR said on average there should be about 2 kills a game, getting more is icing on the cake... If survivors do their job good  2 kills is fairly accurate, the more time you give a killer the better he'll perform.
---
All a killer needs is time, if you give him that instead of doing gens and rescuing hooked survivors, you're just shooting yourself in the foot as a survivor.
---
Give survivors ninja uniforms as skins for balance
---
What do you mean former? Afaik he still plays LoL and streams.
---
Wait what's the bug?
---
Ok that makes sense. Thanks for the time!
---
Right? I understand it if people are taking advantage of bugs that allowed you to do stuff you normally should be able to like climb on top of hay bails so the killer can't reach you but this is just normal game play. You have always been able to and will always be able to hook people in the basement. This is a bug that they should immediately hot fix not a bannable exploit.
---
That's the endgame collapse. Moris are where the killer physically kills you. Theres a lot of videos on them if youd like to learn more about it or the game. Doctor and ghostface are my favorite moris
---
I would like to mix it up. But After playing Friday the 13th I realized I enjoy terrorizing survivors so I‚Äôll have to check out the gameplay lol
---
Nope perfectly fine on ps4
---
Problem with this situation is that not everyone reads reddit/forums so they might not be aware of that. Hooking people in the basement is something you do pretty often as killer, so it's hard to make out if they are abusing the bug on purpose. Especially considering that we have basement related challenges for killer.
---
During the infinite mending period you had to use the bugged add ons to do it, and the devs could actually check your match history to see if you suddenly started using said add ons right after the bug was found out.
---
There's probably 2 sides to this story...
---
How do I delete this I meant to reply to a comment not make a whole new one?
---
Very recently I faced a good killer. One gen done. Someone dc mid chase. He chased me I escaped he downed someone then another someone. I waited for him to walk away with one before running to save the other. 
---
They both disconnected. I gave up. A single gen done. He took pity on me when I waved my hand towards myself. He took me to some gens had me do them. Then I let him down me in the exit gate. 
---
He was a kind killer because I was abandoned. 
---
There have been other kind killers. Ones that led me and a teammate to win after a dc. Killers don't like it when survivors quit the game. They are human too.
---
Wouldnt really say that it‚Äôs all fun and games in rank 10. There are a lot of P3 Rank 15 survivors for some reason with fully decked out perks and flshlights. They are pretty much a bane for killers who actually belong there
---
I think an addon that's similar to Trapper's Bloody Coils as suggested by AProClasstinator and ward0630 would be more interesting.
---
He blocked me
---
holy shit
---
When the first person cleanses they wasted the time of 4 people
---
*Dwight
---
Thing is, there's always that one add on that allows Plague to see auras when you vomit as well as you infecting other things because you're sick. If I'm against a Plague I tend to wait until I'm broken, do something like work on a gen alone, then cleanse after a couple minutes because I'd rather not let Plague get in a free hit because I'm injured with no ability to heal besides cleansing.
---
He never popped Tier 3
---
Why do I need to be notified?
---
10 times out of 10 its either a survivor or an arsonist. 100% positive outcome either way.
---
Thanks man
---
i'm in this video and i don't like it
---
Yeah I also play OW on console and Smurfs run rampant. I've given up on comp altogether and just play Quickplay with friends
---
Ruin, Pop, Sloppy Surveillance/Thrilling always works for me.
---
Well, after being pissed and angry at first , I now played some games and found legion to be stronger than before. 
---
Just don‚Äôt think DeepWound is gonna down someone. 
---
I use the extended duration addon with cooldown reduction or Iridescent. Gotta switch targets a lot and you are actually pretty good at mappressure. Discordance help a lot tbh. 
---
He became quite the fast af boi
---
Of course not, but it's definitely better than red rank
---
I think this happened to me last night. This bug y‚Äôall are talking about, does it evolve your screen blacking out as soon as you get hooked? It even automatically struggled for me so I just waited to die lol. The guy that hooked me apologized for it after I messaged him asking about it.
---
Noooo
---
No they don't.They have artists and designer being different people. No studio do both unless you're like 2 people.
---
[Only reason to play Legion after more nerfs.](https://i.imgur.com/WmarpLE.jpg)
---
It's pretty much your goal to get everyone level 40. What I did when I started other than that was getting everyone level 15, so if I had a daily as a character I wasn't playing them with 1 perk. I played feng until I got her level 40 and then started leveling others. You can use the bloodpoints earned as killer or survivor to level either.
---
Well, your teammates WERE being dicks. Remember, Killers have feelings too. This is how you create face-campers and Hillbilly mains.
---
Ahh, I don't play the game or really follow him, so I'm not up to date on what he does. I just saw some compilations over youtube

"Oh look, one of my traps is in my way. Should I step over it and move on? Nah I'm gonna step right the fuck in it."

Oh dude I love this skin, I used to be cowboy Jake but I was so happy when I saw this one
---
GIMME 5 MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REPLICATE THIS
---
I like the bright clothes! They're fun
---
I've had success once though to be fair I haven't had many attempts. It's mostly a meme perk. Run it alongside someone who is running flip-flop and it'll help a good bit. Or if the killer is trying to carry the survivor to the basement it can help.
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
Omg I remember this happening to me, I was playing killer on the game, found and downed someone, picked them up and then dropped them because all the survivors were trying to body block hook, and once I got all of them to run away i couldn't find the survivor anywhere (no stairs were nearby, so they couldn't have been able to crawl that far that fast) and finally I found them on the bottom floor instead of the top where I dropped them. Super weird
---
Do you really think huntress is not great?
---
I never said it wasn't
---
Playing Hammond kinda works out for me to get rid of the salt I accumulate playing OW. The hamster's aura soothes my soul
---
Your meme is crimge
---
Yes, so long as you are sprinting or mending, Deep Wounds will not go down. 
---
It takes 12 seconds to mend now, 8 with help.
---
"Nurse is trash" - yeah right, because a few small nerfs solved her ability to end chases in 20 seconds with little counterplay if the Nurse player is actually good. Get your facts straight, Legion was already weak and got nerfed hard, he has nothing up his sleeve against good survivors, apart from 115%MS (which like 90% of other killers already have AND also a useful power)
---
Not even a little. Being able to catch up to ppl and making it easier to deny windows and loops by body blocking or forcing ppl to dead zones is way better than slightly higher attack speed. You‚Äôre also able to wound more in a shorter time frame, which will slow the game down. Legion can also DW survivors with DS and they won‚Äôt be able to hide in lockers for invincibility. Add to that any killer speed perks will make him fly across the map, and you can still get on hit perk stacks, but there are better perks.
---
Breakout + mettle of man. try it.
---
That's my warning. The perk pretty much slows a Survivor. You heal yourself slow, when you could have helped do a gen, or save a teammate. A lot of Killers run Sloppy Butcher. Which slows healing WAY MORE. If you Really want to heal, just bring a Medkit. The perk slot can be filled with a more productive perk üëçüèΩ
---
Cause im playing with my friends and we're competitive and I'm in the lead and don't want to lose due to a bug that should be fixed?

I agree with this 100%!!!!!!! Very well written!

I believe his issue was with OP stating that they pretty much **only** go against full swf. Unless OP is using a rig made out of broken mirrors and black cats, that's probably not the case. Also I don't really get your 40% figure, that would only be true if every single swf group only played red-ranks which we know isn't the case.
---
I dont think anyone who plays this game doesnt like swf because they dont want  others to have fun with their actual friends. Obvs playing with people you know is a good time. The reason killers dont like swf is because it gives survs in a group an advantage over the killer that bhvr has yet to do anything to help them over come. Playing in a group with voice comms is like everyone in that group having a fifth aura perk that highlights the killer and/or their traps any time another survivor sees them. Surely you can see how that would be annoying to deal with, especially since most swf refuse to acknowledge that they are playing with an advantage.
---
I'm glad I could help in some way. I just don't want new players to become addicted to the game like myself and countless others have been, the game has flaws and you will get frustrated from time to time. Just know that at the end of the day, dying or not getting kills doesn't matter towards anything and it isn't worth being angry or upset.
---
?
---
It is a nerf one of the strong suits of legion and a common build included STBFL or even sloppy having these not proc with feral frenzy and the amount of disadvantages already associated with the power itself made the whole thing alot worst to use. However the bamboozle build is looking pretty promising ngl.
---
Survivor: \*dies near basement\*
---
Killer: \*brings survivor to basement\*
---
Survivor: GLITCH ABUSER
---
Survivors would complain 100% tho. ;(
---
ah, anime, where hot girls are unrealistically interested
---
Dude, I just go for the closest hook. If it just so happens to be in the basement then tough sh*t.
---
I played legion about 4 times before the change and never downed anyone with deep wounds anyways because by the time they were out of my terror radius they would mend.
---
It‚Äôs the shrine of secrets on the store that lets you purchase perks with Shards that you in from the game
---
Damn I had a game last night where I got a 4K in the basement and I was so confused because two of the survivors were just crawling around in circles after they unhooked. I even messaged one because I couldn't figure out why they didn't leave or what they were trying to do. I feel bad now, I thought it was just the new Oni map that was bugged.
---
So what if he was, sucks for the tunneled/camped, but the rest of you should be doing gens then.
---
Maybe she had a daily?
---
Just realized I learned echolocation and Braille just to play this game. Wild.
---
It's not like other bug abuses where it only worked if you ran tinkerer 2 or some shit. Basement hooks are a normal part of gameplay.
---
Honestly I main survivor but when I do play killer 10% of the time and see bright neon cosmetics it makes me cackle because it's going to be like 10x easier for me to see them poking through a bush or from across the map. I'm also a blind baby killer so it actually helps. Not sure why killers would avoid, maybe they don't like DBD Killer on easy mode? lol
---
or maybe because people who wear neon cosmetics are toxic or plan to juke the whole match, who knows
---
GG EZ
---
I certainly can‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt been in that Mikey‚Äôs position specifically but it is infuriating to the point of tears for the only survivor you can kill to get bodyblocked by a Squadette. 
---
It would be even worse if they flamed him in the postgame chat.
---
Do you mean FLIP FLOP?
---
They're not live yet I thought?
---
No, flip flop is a smelly perk
---
The Senate will decide your fate
---
It‚Äôs a nerf to a build yes, but imho not to the killer overall. There are other better builds now. Map pressure, slowing down gens and cutting off loops is usually better for winning. Will it make legion top tier? Nope. But I think he‚Äôll be better than he was for skilled players.
---
So wtf does deep wounds even do?  Why should survivors care that they have it?
---
They buffed Legions Frenzy speed and Frenzy vault speed and buffed some add-ons but they removed Frenzys ability to work with perks like STBFL (one of the best perks for Legion), nerfed some add-ons and I believe shadownerfed Frenzy duration as well.
---
The balance team needs to get fired. Leave the stabby teenagers alone. &gt;:(
---
bhvr better get their shit together
---
The new update introduced a bug that makes survivors completely unable to see if they get basement hooked even once.  
---
Edit: I'm seeing comments that say it's fixed as of today.  So that's good.
---
I usually slap Noed on my Nurse nowadays bc she‚Äôs abject garbage at red ranks.
---
Survivors either do the totems and buy me time or they don‚Äôt do totems and I go god mode on them. 
---
Win/win for good ol Nursey poo
---
Love the art, totally reminds me of Gumball
---
okay so on the killers side ( if you purchased the DLC's ):
---
- theres a Perk called Barbeques and chilli. it gives you 1.5x to 2x ammount of bloodpoints after the match. you need to hook every survivor once tho because if you dont youll get less points multiplied. it also comes with an effect wich gives you information about the locations of the survivors. you can get this perk from the Cannibal.
---
- theres a perk called hex ruin. its a perk from the hag and its effect is to slow down the game. skillchecks on the gens are way harder to get and if the survivors miss it the gen gets regressed. they have to actively search for you hex ruin to cleanse it wich buys you a lot of time.
---
- dont play nurse in the beginning because she is mechanically the hardest survivor to play.
---
- if a survivor loops you for a very long time it might be a better decision to leave that survivor because the other 3 survivors are doing gens and totems. if you go for another survivor you might down them faster.
---
- if you want to read some of the most used perks in the game, go check out these perks:
---
Killer side:
---
- barbeque and chilli
---
- hex ruin
---
- hex noed
---
- nurses calling
---
- pop goes the weasel
---
- save the best for last
---
- play with your food
---
survivor side:
---
- borrowed time
---
- decisive strike
---
- balanced landing
---
- dead hard
---
- iron will
---
- urban invasion
---
- sprint burst
---
- adrenaline
---
if you have any questions, were here to help ^^
---
if i forgot any perks feel free to comment down below guys
---
"You've officially gone too far Buddy!"
---
I had a match yesterday as huntress for a daily. I‚Äôm a god awful huntress and play on console and hooked someone at the end and had all 3 survivors crowding the hook faking a rescue trying to make the save. Finally got to the point where I downed two and they died to the EGC.
---
More like please fix
---
Bro, I would love a killer that was four people on the map that you could toggle through with spacebar.
---
All Legion's power is good for is mildly inconvincing a survivor for a couple of seconds.
---
The only way Legion is going to be viable at this point is if he gets a rework, and no one knows how long till that's even anounced, nevermind being implemented.
---
Tunnel them.
---
A lot of games do the copying thing on PS4, it's not just DBD. It's partially because the ps4 doesn't have a SSD.
---
A good way is to wait like half a second after the black circle thing around the hook disappears
---
I gotta upload it. Kms.
---
I‚Äôm a decent survivor and don‚Äôt try to hide, I definitely give killers a good run but it‚Äôs nothing too bad.
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen every time. I‚Äôve been basement hooked but nothing happened, though it‚Äôs seemingly random.
---
500 people working there (not all devs, sure) and multi million revenues (look it up). So yes, I think it is normal to expect a game without bugs. 
---
And no they did not fix any framerate dropping. I had to many framedrops since this update came out, I‚Äòve never had any before.
---
Do you really think it is normal to bring out unbalanced and untested bugs? Do you ever heard something about software engineering and how software is designed? I don‚Äòt think they are following any standards lol
---
I saved a friend from the basement with it. The killer was mad at my friend cause she looped him and went after her hella hard. He tried to put her in the basement so I ran over and ran circles around him. He swung at me twice, missed both times, and she was off his shoulder halfway down the stairs.
---
Ah yes we all know people are reliable with those. What if the killer doesn't browse forums or reddit, and has chat turned off (a lot do)? This isn't something you can enforce. Shit happens, it's fixed.
---
It‚Äôs not that they need to remove him, but they need a massive power rework
---
Nice!
---
I could be wrong but smaller updates take longer to copy than bigger updates, it‚Äôs just Sony.
---
Right but that was just one game. It's really easy to look at logs to see killers running IG/Agitation multiple games.
---
Kind of a requirement tbh. Disrespect deserves death...and it always seems to come from Ace and Ash players
---
love these but theres no png files? like with no black background
---
Golden mates
---
in the next 2 years
---
I've gotten it to go off a few other times but that one was the best by far and the killer was fuming. I got salt mail from it.
---
But usually, with all the games I have anyways, it downloads the update and then it's installed. There is no delay or "copying" like dbd.
---
Use alpha mask and combine them .. dint realize 8k render as png was over 45MB.. cant upload those anywhere
---
Something's wrong here
---
Don't be a toxic survivor and maybe killers won't want to dish out extra punishment.
---
Don't assume everyone knows there is a bug or are really wanting to get those basement challenges.
---
Don't get downed close to the hook.
---
Tell me about it. Haha
---
Lmfao damn
---
I have an Xbox but I have this game on PlayStation
---
It‚Äôs cause you didn‚Äôt activate windows
---
Dead Harded into a wall, Trapper missed, I ecaped, dropped a pallet on a friend of mine, immediately hit a Trapper's trap.
---
There's a problem with that, what about people who were unaware of this bug and got mass reported after playing X games? Give them a free ban too?
---
Happens on almost every single game. Just do a quick google search about it and it'll all make sense! :)
---
I definitely did the opposite of that on accident recently. And immediately screamed OH MY GOD I AM THE SANDBAGGER NOW. My teammate got away without a hit luckily and I ran right in front of the killer to take a swipe for my misdeeds. Also messaged the player afterwards saying sorry for my accidental sandbag
---
They literally have a chef that makes them food, wow
---
Ooh that's nice.
---
I never believe people when they say they 4k "every" game at red ranks. Feels fishy as fuck.
---
I would pay for filthy frank to be a survivor. Everytime he slams a pallet down on a killer ‚ÄúKNOW YOUR FUCKING PLACE!‚Äù
---
To Satan? What has Jesus been doing with his new body?
---
Deep wound is what his ability is essentially all about if that's not what hes supposed to revolve around what is? His fucking M1 the thing every killer has?
---
It happened to my friend on the new map not 1hr ago
---
I guess we shouldn't discuss if your pov is "$10 a month i'm spending is free and cheap".
---
they have combined to make an angry ogre
---
Yes. But technically The Entity has their souls before they get sacrificed.. but that is just me Shitpost gatekeeping.. and I ain't about to ruin everyone's fun.
---
This game is so bad as soon as your needle was dead center of the skill check my phone buffered and then jumped you to the hook.
---
I had to watch again to see if it was me or the video lmao.
---
That‚Äôs sucks tho
---
His billy sprint is good but my main problem is the charge attack during demon mode. That shit seems hard to land because of how much screen it takes up and how much time they have to dodge
---
I feel so bad when those accidents happen.
---
I haven‚Äôt played Oni yet
---
Not enough gens done/teammates left for hatch to spawn
---
I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs A tier and he‚Äôs A or B
---
When bhvr messes up we cant just give em a pat on the back and say you tried, this game is a product and as a consumer we have every right to complain about said product esp if it isnt up to par. And well they arent huge they arent someones uncle making a free game in his garage for everyone to play, they are a actual company. Im sick and tired of this ‚Äúuwu they twied owo‚Äù attitude bc it does absolutely nothing to fix the problems in this game. To fix problems it takes actually calling out and complaining about these things. If we all just said its ok you tried the game would get stagnant and go nowhere leading to its bug filled death.
---
Edit: also the be grateful part grinds my gears. I payed for this game i payed for the dlc etc it was not a gift it was not free. Why should i be grateful when something i payed for is a buggy mess it makes no sense.
---
Who the hell is saying nerf Oni? Literally haven't seen one single person say that.
---
1. No Cross Platform
---
2. Community as in players?
---
If so, yeah, smaller numbers on Switch than the rest
---
alright wheres the killer vs killer fighting game
---
Not cross platform and I doubt switch has a big community. Also the fps on switch is extremely bad so skillchecks get messed uo due to that a lot I've heard.
---
Yeah, huntress is super good if your good with her
---
Played against him once, we got stomped
---
Hi, I‚Äôm here to circlejerk.
---
I think I have quite good aim for a console player and she works great for me. I like not being looped 50 times
---
I love playing against him as surv. He is one of the few killers that still legitimately jumpscares me sometimes, and there's tons of funny moments even in moments I'd usually get irritated I can't help but laugh cuz of his character
---
Monstrous shrine is a killer perk tho foo
---
hey yo it worked
---
i mean. i joke about bhvr nerfing legion all the time, but it doesn't even feel like one because deep wound hasn't done anything except be annoying since those dark days. literally the one time i downed someone that way it confused me so much i let them go because i thought the game glitched.
---
Yeah it was my first perk on oni
---
Oh I saw the Oni part late, Im dumb
---
70 :P I grinded that shit out too so it felt super rewarding hitting it
---
Outskilled, outplayed, outgamed
---
The same way they took action against survivors abusing Wake Up?
---
Console ONLY player here, too poor for DBD on PC after I got it on PS4
---
thats not what I meant with looking it up, but thx for the info :D You can also find some info about the revenue and stuff if you search for some longer.
---
survivor bad amirite
---
Nobody really even played Oni that much yesterday. At first they did, but then it was back to stealth killers. 
---
Now everyone is running survivor because they know how easy it is to juke Oni.
---
Y'know, getting a job as a game tester was all the rage in the early 00's. Maybe those positions need to open back up. Not just for this game, most these days.
---
The other day me and another guy were running from the killer and he was in front I was right behind. He dropped the pallet on me causing me to get hit by the killer. I was so furious as we had plenty of time for me to make it through too. Playing survivor is pretty laid back but that infuriated me.
---
Yea I'll happily eat the downvotes. I know it's wrong to abuse bugs. There's never an excuse. I had a killer tell me yesterday they "had" to hook me in basement on first hook or they'd lose. They knew about the bug. It's not how I play when I play killer and I've purposefully avoided the basement. But some people think they can choose which behaviour deems people worthy of being affected by a bug.
---
Thanataphobia is a horrible perk I don't understand it's popularity. It makes sense on stealth killers along with Sloppy, but by itself it only slows down healing and gens by 16% at max, that is a garbage number.
---
They nerfed a build, which can be replaced by IMHO a much better build. Map pressure and slow down are going to be better than hitting a bit faster, especially when survivors can loop you. Now, you can cut off loops better than ever. I'd also argue that being able to apply more DW is better than being able to apply DW with SB. More ppl forced to heal the DW while you focus on 1 person, is better than less DW with SB stacked. Especially since you should be able to more consistently down ppl with new builds.
---
When breakout is used well the killer will miss you most of the time, at full stacks and styptic it just allows you to take enough hits even if the killer picks up a surv right by the hook. Tbh its very satisfying taking 3 hits, imagine the killer's frustration xP while it might not be the most well rounded build i think it has its place.
---
really appreciate the swiftness of this update. keep up the good work!
---
Not just Nemesis Buddy. Beast of Prey was just as bad
---
"You merely adopted the salt. I was born in it. Molded by it."
---
"KNOW YOUR PLACE. TRASH."
---
This surprised me lol, anyone remember the winter where devs were on break for like 2 weeks and bahroo showed an exploit that let you stack perks and change killer powers?
---
That was a crazy time and it wasn't fixed until January. It shows how much bigger bhvr has gotten.
---
I would grind oni if I had him
---
Sumo are muscle under that layer of extra fat. 
---
Oni is not a sumo. He also has no body fat.
---
I thought it this was a rickroll. I‚Äôve had 2 of those today on this sub alone!
---
It would appear that The Trapper has become The Trapped
---
Juking only works on console because the fps is mediocre. That mixed with lag is almost unplayable. I barely play killer for that reason.
---
I bet you would, pervert. ;)
---
It just started happening to me after I bought auric cells at around 8 pm yesterday. But Every game before I got them was working fine? Idk if that has something to do with it or what.
---
That's gay bro I am straight
---
As far as I know you can only purchase them individually
---
At the last second, Pig dives in front of Bubba, taking the bullet for him
---
then she gets back up and does it again
---
Cocaine!
---
I read someone suggest that if you hit three Survivors without DW in a single activation, the fourth Survivor hit is downed. I think that could work as a buff for them.
---
Then Frank's could make it where you down the third person hit instead.
---
Just don‚Äôt look him in the eye. TOTALLY fine bro. No homo.
---
Well up to now I've only played about 15 matches and only 2 people have escaped because I dont slug for the 4k.
---
I'm almost certain the pic isn't commenting on him being nerfed as a whole but on how deep wounds was changed so that it doesn't work with nemesis.
---
Ah, I see. That‚Äôs a bit inconvenient. Oh well, I‚Äôll manage lol. Thanks for the reply!
---
He posted that 5 hours ago and the fix only went live about 2 hours ago.
---
Yeah, and even though there's a 3-5 second stun or whatever from deactivating FF, a Survivor can't get -that- far away and if you use Feral Frenzy to get the Survivor into a position that's unfavorable for them, it'll make getting the regular M1 hit that much easier.
---
Also Feral Frenzy is a _great_ anti-tunnel tool.  If you run into someone who just got unhooked you can slap DW on them and use that to hunt down someone else.
---
Besides the flick, I feel like he might be somewhat screwed up on console. There‚Äôs been countless times my club has gone through their bodies or I‚Äôm super close and my lunge doesn‚Äôt go far enough and I‚Äôm left scratching my head, ‚Äúhow?‚Äù.  Also, I‚Äôm sure this is a universal problem (maybe), but his character model is waaaay too big. I mean, besides his obvious girth. I won‚Äôt be close to a pallet and I‚Äôm getting stunned. If his model is actually this big, then my sword attacks should equal this distance, but of course it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Wait I've never realised. Is there no shack in Hawkins, The Game and Lerrys?
---
6s swapping as the Killer is pretty meta..
---
I will remember itüò≠
---
DUTCH, THE CRINGE, IT'S KILLIN ME DUTCH.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6lzus/psa_counter_to_the_basement_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You can buy individual characters with Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells. It‚Äôs only a good deal to pay real $$$ if you plan to buy both killer and survivor from the pack.
---
In your case, you want the killers, so buy Auric Cells and then get only killers
---
Working as a team to try and let everyone escape is being a dick???
---
How does the power cripple you? I've had no problems with him so far.
---
I‚Äôm a plague main, and not to boast or anything but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty good with her. I got to red ranks using her alone. So yea, if someone cleanses it‚Äôs pretty much game. Corrupt purge lasts a lot longer than it should imo. The thing is though, even if you don‚Äôt cleanse you‚Äôre still pretty fucked. If you infect everyone, it becomes extremely easy to track and hear survivors, and since vile purge puts them in the broken status meaning the survivors can‚Äôt heal they‚Äôre always one-hit. Plague is definitely one of the strongest killers at every rank, especially if the player knows how to use her correctly. Her add-ons are extremely broken as well
---
you can either but killers/survivors individually or chapters
---
Out of Shape: After running for 5 seconds the perk activates. Once activated you get the exhausted status effect for 120 seconds and are incapable of running while exhausted.
---
Pain Intolerance:  Perk activates once put into the injured state from healthy state. You become completely immobile for the rest of the match.
---
Depression: Knowing that death is inevitable fills you with despair. All action speeds are reduced by 80%.
---
W-what? Beast of prey only effects your red stain
---
It‚Äôs been two days and I have not encountered an Oni once. Also I only played the new map one time.
---
Or ghost face, I main him and I lose survivors all the time, it‚Äôs a pain man...
---
&gt;but a small company
---
That's gotta be a joke, right? They have 500 employees. Many AAA studios have a similar number of employees, some even lower.
---
&gt;really passionate about their project
---
And that's why in the latest AMA they said they will not skip a chapter in order to work on the game's health and instead, they'll gut events and stuff like that in order to do so.
---
I'm not going to even bother to mention a plethora of issues this game has had since release and the huge lack of QOL improvements such as barebones options, no colorblind modes and so on... and the game has been out for over 3 years at this point.
---
They deserve some credit, but there's a lot to be criticized and rightfully so.
---
To my recollection the same thing happened to me, I bought some auric cells on Tuesday for the Black Friday sale and it‚Äôs been going on since
---
‚ÄúMy bloodline was dishonoured, my birthright desecrated, my granddaughter subject to this murderous rite of bondage. I and I alone will end this‚Äî‚Äú
---
‚ÄúNo one gives a fuck about your emo fan fiction, Oni.‚Äù
---
While injured, I once had an Ace pick up my Health Kit in front of me, then tea bag and run off. THE DISRESPECT.
---
Whether you call her great or not she's about the 5th best killer at best.
---
Nurse, Freddy, Spirit, and Billy are objectively better and I won't entertain any argument otherwise. Personally, I would also say GF and MM are better. Plague is arguably also better. There are also some pretty noticeable gaps in power level mixed in there some places.
---
Huntress' movement speed fucks her. She can't patrol split gens as good as a low tier killer can on a lot of maps, and to patrol on the rest takes high huntress skill and survivors dumb enough to not crouch or repair on the safe side of the gen. Chase time isn't everything, nor is chase inevitability.
---
They never should have changed deep wounds from pre-legion.  It was good the way it was.  Rework legion and bring the OG deep wounds back.
---
It's viable on legion because healing is the worst a survivor can do vs them. So you'll pretty much always have 16% slow down on everything. It's not wise to run it as your only slow down perk but it works on legion.
---
good :)
---
Fix the deadzones for Nurse on the new map too. The area in the middle where all the statues are cannot be blinked through and a few rocks and bamboo on the outsides.
---
Are you on console or pc?
---
I am not sure why you are being downvoted for a literally 100% factual and helpful statement.
---
Aww poop. Another thing I thought I'd mention too is if you play Nea or unlock her perk Plunderer as a teacher perk to get it on other characters it's really useful. Sometimes I'll just go into a match with nothing and get items from chests
---
That match is dark as hell, it‚Äôs hard to see shit half the time
---
Console
---
No. It did work after restarting the Xbox though.
---
If you're playing a competition with friends, you're still on an even playing field with them since you all need to deal with the bug the same.
---
Nah, only Susie is trans.
---
When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that a mori.
---
Restarted game and console and still can‚Äôt connect to host after many retries. Not sure what‚Äôs going on.
---
Good. Glad it went away for you
---
If he chased one person for 5 gens he has nobody to blame but himself
---
Thanks thats helpful!
---
Yep having the same problem. Funny how it happened right after spending money on the game too LMAO
---
"Do you know what Nemesis means?"
---
[https://youtu.be/QGsQ2gPzAf4?t=159](https://youtu.be/QGsQ2gPzAf4?t=159)
---
Ohh, you got the ds skill check but the game didn't counted it? You must be new if you are giving it so much importance, these things used to happen a game yes and a game no
---
Eh, I don't mind. People have different opinions.
---
I don't get why this dude even has a power. The only time its not active is the first 30 seconds of the game.
---
Gets it so fast and it lasts so long. I think using his dash should consume his fury a little faster.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really weird. I got the ugly sweater today and now I can‚Äôt connect to host. I‚Äôm gonna hard reset my console and see if that works.
---
Isn‚Äôt he 5% faster and vault pallets and windows so much faster. Like he vault pallets faster than survs now
---
I think the devs either don‚Äôt play their own game, or are constantly in grey ranks.
---
Just chair gaming bro
---
I'm down
---
Gotta get those challenges done one way or another.
---
Wait they are out already? Tell me if it gets fixed after resetting it please
---
You should have put it warning headphone user man,my ears are deaf right now.
---
Yeah I gotta admit I‚Äôm eating my hat on this one. Not having nemesis is a bummer, but I do like these changes a lot and their power feels like a power now. 
---
All I think I‚Äôd really like now is their cooldown addons to have a bit greater magnitude, Franks Mixtape to instead allow me to miss feral frenzy attacks and keep my power, and the DW timer to be like 15 seconds.
---
Na it‚Äôs the meg ugly sweater, I don‚Äôt think the rest release until the 11th, and will do.
---
Wait what?? 
---
Why am I getting spotlighted like this!!
---
*Aaaggh runs and hide in the locker*
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting common/well-known bugs and glitches in the game. Please use our weekly smile sunday threads for this type of submission.
---
It always makes me laugh when I'm working on a gen and I see a teammate randomly decide to walk over to a corner
---
when you're trying to avoid using the basement hooks but the survivors are running sabotage  :/
---
Dose your ass get jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth?
---
aka standing still
---
and this is why we dont attempt adepts at red ranks.
---
It doesn‚Äôt spawn. It doesn‚Äôt exist
---
Deep Wounds is a stalling power. It's stalling ability was nerfed by reducing the time to mend. 
---
His add-ons were...adjusted. Pin add-ons are definitely better, not great but better. 
---
The add-ons that got nerfed, not sure why. 
---
The vaulting and speed changes were appreciated, but not enough.
---
He is poorly designed, he can either be horribly underpowered or horribly overpowered.
---
Someone who doesn‚Äôt understand humor^^
---
Imagine downvoting this lol
---
Shut the up crimge normie
---
Small Game tells me there‚Äôs a totem ahead. Trapper has Ruin, so I run ahead to cleanse the totem.
---
Trapper also has traps, I remind myself, as I‚Äôm picking bits of leg out of the trap.
---
And then I do it again when I discover another ‚ÄúRuin‚Äù across the map. I‚Äôm just so enthusiastic.
---
I've yet to die to an Oni, maybe ppl are still learning him but corners make dodging his power super easy, especially really tight curves
---
Someone please ask about the lighting on the Yamaoka maps. It‚Äôs atrocious
---
Try for vault grabs instead.

√âdit: and I swoop
---
ahh this would be so cool!! cry of fear has a special place in my heart and seeing simon as a survivor would be beyond cool
---
Deep wounds is a joke now
---
Imo the doctors's "buff" isnt a buff but a nerf. No more passive madness. Like how the legion got "buffed".
---
GhostFace, Myers, and Pig are the spooky trinity for me. 
---
I always seem to have replaced SpineChill when I get into their lobbies lol.
---
It is a known bug. It is being fixed. This has been posted literally over 100 times. If you sort by New posts, you'll see that.
---
It does count for example when you put red ranks against yellow or grey ones. Many people carry their friends (which is stupid as fuck but ok) and I have faced red rank games with a rank 20 that does nothing and always has the team going out of their way to save/protect them; or yellow/grey killers going against a (potato, but still) red survivor because the rest of the team was yellow/grey. It can make the game even more stale than it is, imo
---
Edit, for clarification: rank means nothing yeah, but it usually depicts experience/hours into the game, and that makes a hell of a difference
---
Lol I had some embarassing moments recently. Just made the switch from console to PC, didnt read over the controls so those first few matches were rough. I kept hitting crouch to sprint, and vice versa. Getting better now though
---
Last night I wasn't even hit, but the number of times I was invisible in a small bush with the Oni looking around for me is ridiculous. Even more so considering I was wearing the bright red hat, fire rooster shirt, and watermelon pants XD
---
Pretty much they get a quitter bonus it's like 1k points I think
---
I accidentally sandbagged somebody recently. I had been running borrowed time all day, but I took it off bc I was doing the tome challenge where you have to use dark sense, and my level 3 jeff was the only character who had it. It didn't even occur to me until the end when I unhooked a meg, thinking we'd be able to get out only for her to splat onto the ground.
---
I felt like, and was I realize, an asshole. I would have apologized but they had their console settings set to not allow that, so if you see this random ps4 meg, I'm actually super sorry
---
Oni is the rarer Breed of having muscles and fat, extra thicc and stronk
---
I did not. Sorry for the spam
---
It‚Äôs a game you probably spent like $50 on for actual gameplay add-ons and probably have spent 1000 hours playing. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúreturn on investment.‚Äù You‚Äôve probably spent more on bad dinners and left without saying anything, but something that‚Äôs offered you absurdly more hours of fun for way less money turns into a ‚Äúlet me speak to your manager‚Äù situation. Video games is one of the biggest return on investments you can have as a consumer. Sure, because you bought it you can complain about it, but also don‚Äôt be a Karen
---
I really wouldn't recommend PGTW on any killer other than Freddy because you're going out of your way to find a gen with a lot of progress to kick. Surveillance could be good on demo. Just kick any gen you see when you're not in a chase and place a portal so you can go to the gen if someone starts working on it. The surge surveillance combo is also good!
---
I don‚Äôt understand how to beat hex either
---
No they played the game as intended unlike you
---
AFAIK there is a legit way to do this even with the hatch changes in play (this was shared with me by other players).
---
If your last teamate is about to get his final hook (or you plan on letting him rot) start doing a gen just before he dies (or while he is dying before the hatch opens) and let the killer look for the hatch. If the killer closes the hatch while you are on a gen that gen you were doing gets "auto-finished" and counts as the requirement for "Do the last gen". All you have to do now is escape through the gates, which you likely will need "Wake up" or a lot of luck (no mobility killer, exit gates on oposite sides).
---
Stfu about them being a small company.  They‚Äôre fucking not.  That‚Äôs not an excuse anymore
---
Joe Mum by moonlight
---
I'm saying that, only because this Was quite common, I know that isn't normal that the perk doesn't work
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one with this problem. Its so weird how he works. He has map pressure and chase potential but.. he struggles so much. His shred is more useful for jukes, so maybe thats it.
---
*multi-million dollar company ruins legion, releases a buggy new chapter, tells us we have to wait up to 2 weeks for them to fix a game breaking bug*
---
You: y'all aren't grateful for this product you paid for and continue paying for
---
Are you talking about their real life store? It doesn't seem greatly ran. I could try to submit a ticket for you and see if I get a reply? I'd love to help because it's stressful to buy things online and not get any confirmation or timeline as to when you'll get the item. I was gonna buy the Huntress body pillow for the memes but it was 55 plus taxes and 17 dollars shipping so it didn't seem worth it. Which was frustrating since I'm very close to Montreal which is their headquarters.
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen!
---
i want to cry
---
This is a stolen meme. It was already posted.
---
Maybe the killer boxes can be changed to something the player goes into and is immune from the killer messing with them while they check. This can put a hard stop on even the best killers tunneling and if they do wait for one to get out they're just hurting themselves by wasting time.
---
Survivor skins are supposed to be flashy to prevent it from being "pay to win", since killers have a terror radius it's ok to have non flashy skins. Except for stealthy killers like ghostface who does have flashy skins
---
Upvote for Shitty UI
---
I'm good at aiming it's the other stuff i have trouble with. This is great advice, thank you for the help!
---
Getting four kills says nothing about the difficulty of the killer
---
Idk why but when I face plague I just get so thirsty
---
Very funny.
---
DW is still a solid stalling power with the new FF speed buffs. You'll be able to get to survivors faster, and potentially be able to apply more DWs in a shorter time frame. Not only that, but it prevents survivors with DS from jumping into a locker for invincibility if you get them with DW. 
---
Not just that, but being able to cut off angles and loops from survivors is WAY better than applying DW, when it didn't do anything in the past. Gotta think of Legion as being more tactical in that you can use him to deny windows/loops and trying to force people into dead zones so you can easily M1 them. Also gotta think of them as more a delay killer than insta-down killer.
---
From my understanding it might‚Äôve been based on the cosmetics your character was wearing. 
---
I was wearing jakes Christmas sweater (blue) got blue underworld. People with brown screenshots had brown or yellow cosmetics. 
---
The shirt in your pic has purple and you got purple. Oddly enough I think it might actually have something to do with this. 
---
Fortunately we‚Äôll never know thanks to the archive breaking hotfix.
---
I got a vpn but I can‚Äôt change my region on AppStore
---
Especially if they had the audacity to actually try and run from the killer and not stand still under a hook /s
---
There's been some bugs with nemesis. Like having 2 obsessions.
---
Additionally, for these game breaking bugs to have made it to production means that their testing and regression practices are either nonexistent, ignored or completely incompetent. 
---
For people (myself included) to notice a bug that makes the game unplayable within 5 minutes of playing my first game at release, is unacceptable. 
---
I do agree with OP on one part tho, it‚Äôs not the devs fault and bugs occur as part of the coding process, but Testing is a key part of development and it obviously is not being managed properly.
---
I mean, what is the purpose of the rank?
---
I'm not having a dig at you bro, just replying to the other guy about hatch standoffs
---
Ngl I thought that was a HD Dwight head
---
True but still in my opinion he is really easy
---
This changes everything. Finally I can play Billy
---
Agree. They can not do anything with deep wound it is like RBT's on piggy. Deep wound makes them not be able to do anything
---
 bond, breakout or empathy. Those should help with positioning. Metal of man because you can get protection hits while a survivor is on the killer back. I really don't have a idea on the flashing or add-ons.
---
Better way: Give the option for solo queue, swf queue (2) or swf queue (3+) so the killer can choose and practice against swfs and let them choose multiply options if he doesn't care about swf
---
The game that started me on PC gaming is TF2.   
---
ANY update that doesn't take a year is a early update to me. That said, I am super grateful for behavior.   
---
They screw up a lot, but they still do it a LOT, meaning things get done on a regular basis. TF2 hasn't gotten a major update in 2 years and is now on hold, so seeing something like DBD getting a big patch every 3 months is a big deal to someone like me.
---
In my opinion the survivors get too much warning, I don‚Äôt think everyone in the map should know that he is teleporting.. but I‚Äôm not a game dev so that probably wouldn‚Äôt be balanced haha
---
I kind of like the DW idea. Help uncover people trying to hide, ppl have to mend and can't work on generators, and now if you apply it to someone with DS, they can't just hide in a locker for invincibility. Still not the greatest power, but I see the movement as the core of Legion's power. Denying windows and everything is WAY more significant than applying a mostly useless wound.
---
Things we don‚Äôt know:
---
If you actually decently used your power or if you just basic attacked everyone and they were potatoes
---
How much the DC affected the rest of the game
---
Nemesis isn't weak at all lmao
---
Did this as Oni recently, handed the last survivor exit gates, their team did well getting 3 gens before they started to get snowballed and so I let the last one wiggle free and I ran around found hatch closed it and then just swung them over to a nearby exit gate.
---
Yeah i plan on looking deeper into it
---
Good survivors almost never hide though
---
Uh no he's right you fuck people over when you cleanse so no it's not "playing the game as intended"
---
Dash attack not effecting stuff is actually good imo because you can use it to conserve STBFL stacks
---
Are you ok? Do you wanna talk?
---
I don‚Äôt have Pop on demo yet, but if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it, you‚Äôre probably right. I have discordance as a filler right now, do you think I should swap discordance for something else?
---
there's something off about your comment, and the off thing is that it makes too much sense
---
Sorry bro I‚Äôll change the caption lmao
---
Exactly this. Just because I enjoy running add ons/perks/moris that other people hate playing against, I'm not toxic. I just enjoy running dumb shit.
---
Anybody else unable to get in a lobby with friends on xbox? Tried a full console restart and no luck.
---
RIP DUDE
---
That knife looks extremely big lol
---
Ok thank you, what do you think of make your choice? I have it available but wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be put to good use..
---
I called out a killer about this and he said:"Do GeNs fAsTer..."
---
I had to report it even if it does nothing.
---
There still has to only 1 gen left, right?
---
Proper rework late in 2022
---
i AM the senate.
---
Sadly I don‚Äôt have pop yet, what about discordance?
---
Can't use a motorcycle to kill people when you're a scrawny Asian girl
---
THIS. THIS IS WHAT I‚ÄôVE BEEN LOOKING FOR, I was too lazy to do anything about it but me and my swf group made this exact joke (and a few other related memes to it) and I just HAD to check reddit and see this the next day. Wholesome.
---
yeah!! KWF mode!!
---
Seeing Ash run away from a dude with a knife doesn‚Äôt make sense. He could easily turn around and beat the shit out of them.
---
Then by your logic there‚Äôs NOTHING wrong with running insidious on nurse. It‚Äôs perfectly okay to run and you definitely won‚Äôt be at a disadvantage for using it. Make your choice, NOED and haunted grounds are also insane on plague then right? Let‚Äôs also put on brutal strength on Demogorgon. It‚Äôs super good and not a bad thing on him at all!
---
New ultra rare offering. when used re-enter the trial with ash's boomstick
---
Not you bby.
---
Not sure if it needs to be only 1 gen left to do or if it can be multiple ones missing, but work testing if the match is going to south anyway.
---
Yay, no more angry messages when I hook somebody in the basement.
---
Great idea.While were at it just remove match making
---
In all honesty Ash would fucking obliterate every killer except maybe Micheal and Freddy, they'd atleast get a few hits in before getting their shit caved in
---
It's nerfed in that it won't be busted with DWs for sure, which is probably for the best. But it's buffed for funny builds like using Nemesis with Play with your food. I'm not saying that combo is going to be good, but it'll be good to get rid of pallets while gaining increased speed movement speed. That speed I believe also applies to FF, making you THAT much faster. It'll be amusing as fuck, if you don't mind losing matches.
---
SWF can be so bad that killer needs a "give up" option, where you raise your arms in the air like you're being arrested
---
Damn, I probably would've dropped nea on the ground and killed Laurie. Now you got 2 downed survivors
---
Corrupt Intervention to set up traps, use Deer Lung and one that make survivors take longer to close portals, the purple one preferably so they don‚Äôt rush closing them while in chase. You are gonna get rushed early so make SURE you get yourself at least a 3 gen strat at the end so you can always see where they are with the heartbeat thing. I‚Äôm guessing you know how to use the lunge already. Use slowdown perks just to be safe, PGTW, Sloppy Butcher, etc.
---
He could beat up Micheal. Just doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt come back.
---
hahaha. it is very dark. i had a bad match on it as oni where i actually tried to use his power. i wouldve done well if i didnt try to use it
---
No, I added the oni face
---
I mean the only nerf really is FF not counting as basic attacks. DWs getting nerfed is like, whatever, nobody used it to down anyways and it was pointless ever since the rework. People crying that Legion is now unplayable and horrible and that the devs are beyond redemption are just exagerrating and circlejerking for upvotes.
---
Screenshot chat + report.
---
He just activated his own trap card.
---
Spirit = legion they both stab with stuff. See? I can do it too.
---
My favorite part of every stealth killer is when you see a survivor run around corner directly at you and you get to see the "OH SHIT" moment in their eyes as they turn 180 degrees and start sprinting in the other direction. Even better when they don't have that moment until you smack them and they proceed to play Pong and bounce of 10 walls while running away.
---
Good luck! Glad to hear you're enjoying it!
---
Proximity would be fantastic. You just don‚Äôt want it to work because then you won‚Äôt be able to face camp. That‚Äôs a fact, whether you like it or not. 
---
Please supply a citation where BHVR said their stats were not to be taken seriously. Nobody puts out numbers unless they have meaning, and I e got my doubts that you‚Äôre either being honest, or that you got that information from a reliable source. Until you can do that much, your claims are invalid in terms of gameplay and fairness. 
---
I don‚Äôt need to read your response again because you clearly didn‚Äôt read anyone else‚Äôs.
---
Faster vaulting and movespeed in FF feels very nice. I can actually catch up to people at the edge of my terror radius now.
---
I don't particularly care about STBFL or Sloppy Butcher, and the mend times also don't really matter. Legion's power is about injuring survivors quickly, the mend was always just a small bonus.
---
I would like the FF stun to be a bit shorter though.
---
They did test it and it didn't happen at all in the PTB version of the game.
---
For real they could just replace it with 60sec broken effect and reverse on-hit changes and we should all be happy.
---
Squadette
---
Vault grabs are easy they function fine, but they need to be injured. The thing with grabbing on a unhook save is that it downs the unhooker essentially and keeps the person on the hook, which   means they can‚Äôt abuse BT which is why I  need some advice on how to do it consistently
---
Best advice. Learn to recognize strong structures/loops and if a survivor runs to one just give up the chase. Im sure its not what you wanna hear but committing more than 20 seconds to a chase can put you in a position where you wont be able to come back from. Just injuring someone is enough dont keep on them to secure the down unless theyre in a bad position because even them running in a straight line after receiving their sprint burst from being hit could waste to much of your time.
---
Or... 4v16
---
Just 16 Dwights running about lmao
---
When its over its over.
---
It doesn't help that Yamaoka has its own mini cornfields every 6 meters too.
---
Now people who ran Agi IG get banned for using perks to make sure they can avoid the basement? Face it, there's no way to punish them.
---
nah.
---
No I did use my power and the survivors... Weren't the best but they were good
---
While that sounds good in theory, nobody would want to play against SWF.
---
Fun idea but I honestly don't think it'd work. Could you imaging going against 2 Nurses or Spirits or being body blocked by 7 fucking people? And ontop of that most maps are too small to be practical for 8 Survivors to be stealthy at all.
---
Yeah, I agree with you on the FF stun being shorter, that would be my #1 wanted improvement.
---
Andbyeah, I love the movement speed. Makes the power feel a lot nice since you can actually catch people now, plus the lunge is harder to dodge since I feel like it goes further now.
---
Entity knows I need more distractions during my work day
---
No idea. Especially since it doesn‚Äôt look like we‚Äôre getting cross platform for a long time.
---
Sorry but my burning bright new Hallowed blight skin on Hag will outshine 10 toxic Neas any day.
---
PIG MAINS UNITE!!
---
I swear officer I'm not doin anything
---
As survivor I hide. But i'm not the best at this game. I have fun though and don't really care about ranking up. I like hiding more because it feels more like a horror game. Tried to do hardcore looping like some survs and it got repetitive fast. lol
---
I think it is a buff. PWYF is insane
---
Maybe there is a reason for it...
---
I had the same issue. I hard reset and got into a game, but now I‚Äôm getting the error codes all over again.
---
Not him, but MYC is alright on demo but it forces you to come back to the hook and leave your current chase if you started one. Its easier since you have portals to come back to the hook but its overall sus unless your planning to proxy camp.
---
You can‚Äôt tell who is SWF though (at least not on PS4)
---
Haha
---
Thought it was asscheeks
---
Might as well
---
This game was built with solos in mind
---
Not swfs
---
no not really.
---
Mid January, with the next mid chapter probably.
---
Some thoughts that have helped me:
---
Make committing/abandoning a chase a conscious decision. A lot of chases just take diligence and patience and swinging through pallets (believe!!!!), though it's also important to know when to leave a highly skilled survivor in a useless place and switch priorities.
---
Trappers, Huntresses, Hags, Clowns etc. can feint using their abilities to try to affect survivor's decisions (e.g. a Huntress threatening a hatchet), though I would be mindful of how this affects your speed as you practice.
---
Also, I think you should use Brutal, Enduring and Spirit Fury as you see fit if you think they'd do well in your Killer designs or shore up a deficit. There's a healthy difference between making use of a perk in its situation versus relying on it.
---
Also, unpredictability. Survivors are studying your patterns, so consciously going against your immediate go-to reaction can be a good way to mix it up. Usually for me this means sometimes committing to the direct route and sometimes ducking around for a short-cut, but still mixing it up. You could get lucky.
---
Sorry to be vague, but I hope that can help a little!
---
Add bigger maps
---
&lt;3
---
Oh, thank you, that‚Äôs very helpful. I‚Äôm still learning this killer so I appreciate your advice!
---
Well obviously they would have to release a very large map for it and make it impossible to have 2 of the same killer but it‚Äôs the same killer-survivor ratio as normal so both sides would have stronger strats respectively
---
On console you can't but on steam you can just check their friend lists
---
Yeah, that definitely makes sense. I do have a habit of over-committing to a chase out of fear or wasting the hit. Will keep that in mind, thanks for the response!
---
Im sure this can work if perks were disabled
---
you wont get it till like march.
---
Can‚Äôt they make their profile private though?
---
Please, BHVR adress this. I would kindly play again this game if these changes go live.
---
Good post, you even get a reward from me, even if it's silver.
---
I played Clown one time in my life going for adept. Used the exhaustion bottle and two survivors commented on my profile saying I ‚Äúthought exhaustion perks were exploits‚Äù lol. Nothing people say in this game makes sense. Idk why it attracts the whiniest/ most toxic people.
---
Yea good point
---
I know that‚Äôs not your question but I did it with a firecracker.
---
Bodyblock at the hook and when the killer hits you drop your firecracker
---
PIG MAINS RISE UP! NEXT IS BUBBA
---
Only PS4 and PC got the update, the rest of the platforms have to suffer with this shit
---
ok thanks!
---
Ah, "Silent night, deadly night."
---
I see Mike is a connaisseur.
---
Yes, but if they're 4 privates then they're probably SWF and you can just dodge anyway. Killer lobbies instant at red ranks
---
"An american Ogre in London"
---
Best to wait for the 13th for adepts. You don‚Äôt have to 4K to get the achievement in yellow/green ranks.
---
That may be true. But.
---
I want hot pink killer skins
---
Hot pink oni when?
---
Well the game wants you to cleanse right? Yes it does but doing that gives the killer more power. But that's how it was intended to work people just found out doing the opposite seems to work better sooo
---
She's dripping with sunny d. Neas be jealous.
---
Guys Michael just wanna win peepers, let him do it finally :D
---
Object of obsession is a really strong perk have one or two people running it on your team I've had four people run it but if you use mic effectively you only need it on one
---
Why people can‚Äôt see sarcasm and downvote you?
---
I find billy and myers more like his fusion since myers has a buy into his power like oni
---
I mean, oni pretty strong.
---
that's actually super good to know i will remember that
---
Don't ask for Pig changes. She'll get "buffed" the same way Legion was "buffed."
---
Don't get me wrong these are good ideas but I half expect Behaviour to say "we heard you that the Reverse Bear Traps were too easy to remove so we removed them entirely, and to balance her addons she now only has brown tier addons."
---
lol downvoting is toxic? that's cute
---
The word you were looking for is lazy bud
---
Nah dude how dare you get in the way of the fun of the survivors don‚Äôt you know you‚Äôre supposed to make the game enjoyable for four complete fucking strangers.
---
I‚Äôll run straight to the plague and let her kill me if my teammates start cleansing, red&amp;purple ranks should know better.
---
Fuck it, I'd take a hot pink Ghostface outfit too. It'd be like playing him on Hard mode.
---
Checkout beaver_ow on twitch. Hammond main. Super good. And he is pretty chill with a hammed up southern accent
---
Wait, there is a tutorial? 350 hours in and I learned the hard way
---
A huge caveat to this.   It needs to be on your best looper.  Of the few things that will make a killer tunnel your ass, this is it.
---
Sharp hand joe cosmetic
---
it's okay you can swear on the internet, the police aren't going to come get you. the fbi is on their way though
---
Yeah but if they are currently rank 11 the killer probably won't think about it that much but I agree when they get to the low purple/ red ranks then they will
---
How are you game sharing?  Steam family?   The perks are tied to your account, and if you get a new account, you won't have the perks.
---
Is this a personal attack?
---
Sharing on Xbox.
---
SWF should be how God intended - one Dwight, one David
---
Yes don't  have it
---
Yea I hard reset my Xbox and restarted the game multiple times it‚Äôs still happened.  It let me in one match then it happened again
---
Read what Enduring does. Short answer: no.
---
At the same time, once you get your power, his dash is far better then Billie's and his instadown is easier to land.
---
Imo better Billy, probably 2nd strongest killer right now.
---
BHVR. GET ON IT!
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a long time what is the basement bug
---
Swf is harder to deal with, but if it's so much harder to deal with that you have to dodge, then you probably arent a very good killer
---
This exact post was here literally yesterday
---
Those make it bad builds not wrong builds
---
THE WORST GLITCH EVER OMEGALUL
---
Whos gonna tell him about the clothing/loadout exploiting from like 2 years ago.
---
Do you happen to have the blank format? This is the first time I‚Äôve seen this and I love it
---
Oh shit, well if we got it Today, it shouldn't be too long untill switch and xbox one get it, i hope...
---
 I'd put Oni on that list of killers that could whoop Ash's ass I mean he's basically a Tank from l4d, Buff as one and tall as one also considering how meaty he looks I  think he could take a shot from ashes boomstick
---
Maybe if injured survivors get mangled when they miss a skill check. pressure them to heal before trying. it would also make skill check difficulty add ons useful.
---
What does that number 3 under your player level mean?
---
If you played on your account the  you ahouldnt lose any teachables.
---
Yeah the guy who posted this picture is very entitled.
---
So, where's the compensation for the bugs, my offerings lost and my rank points lost ?
---
You didn't even bother to read it did you.
---
Devotion Level: After 99 (The large number) It goes around to 1 again, but with the small number underneath to signify how many times you've rolled over
---
I *think* this is a joke
---
Wtf are those perks !
---
It‚Äôs not gay if you don‚Äôt look in the eyes everything else is good
---
Switch?
---
As in that as soon as I mori someone the survivors will get at least one door open I can't test it
---
This is the problem: People that go as far as just killing themselves on hook (or DCing) don't care about other people, they just want to get to the "next game" as soon as possible.
---
Are you a basement dwelling video game player who fantasizes about being with fictional characters, and look something like well, maybe [this?](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fgamepedia.cursecdn.com%2Ffridaythe13th_gamepedia_en%2Fc%2Fc9%2FEric.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ffridaythe13th.gamepedia.com%2FEric_%2522J.R.%2522_LaChappa&amp;tbnid=2_x0CQI0KpmGWM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=xONxjgfnxYl2AM&amp;w=678&amp;h=1017&amp;q=eric%20Lachappa&amp;hl=en-US&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)
---
No this is no place for jokes this is serious survivors must survive every game or else killer is op and needs a nerf.
---
That's why I specifically mentioned the warning in game that BHVR did for the infinite mending bug. I agree that they can't just assume people go other places to find out about stuff like this, but they also have that tool to help stop abuse and they're not using it. It's actually incredibly easy to not use the basement (in fact, for some killers it's better to find that next closest hook) so the lack of trying to prevent this abuse is frankly infuriating.
---
Eh, anyone who says DS is bad now doesnt remember what it used to be like. A surv getting a free chase and being able to escape any time they want was really bad, especially since eveyone brought it so every survivor in the match had one free chase out of you. That was OP; its fine now as an anti-tunneling perk.
---
I'd have to say Iron Will is the most annoying because the killer relies a lot on sound and having survs not whimper while hiding makes it take that much longer to find them.
---
I'm a Killer. It's in the name, I *kill*.
---
Honestly looks pretty cool
---
Yes, has happened to me 4 times today.
---
I think it is a buff. 1. New speed. 2. PWYF. 3.B

Literally all ash needs is to jam a kandarian dagger into Oni

Found it on google: [https://pm1.narvii.com/6214/dc70a761dd96d4788d4d224b9c852e5831f238cd\_hq.jpg](https://pm1.narvii.com/6214/dc70a761dd96d4788d4d224b9c852e5831f238cd_hq.jpg)

Then you realise there are 30 more next to it
---
Yes charges are not added tested multiple times with different medkits and all charge addons
---
Good
---
good job guys!
---
I just don‚Äôt think a lot of people realize that most swf aren‚Äôt doing it be sweaty and win but rather play with their friends to have fun
---
*PERHAPS*
---
I feel like easy-going survivors like to play against ghostface because of his reputation for being fun. Then you always see those *other* survivors calling him the most annoying killer in the game, because he can t-bag. It's like toxic players' approval for t-bagging suddenly dropped once a killer could do it.
---
No one uses sabotage. Not even Jake mains.
---
Good thing they manage to patch it on atleast PS4 and PC meaning it'll likely be fixed on the other platforms very soon so people won't get bullied by people exploiting it on purpose and killers doing on accident won't get bullied too.
---
thats my thoughts on the thing but this man wants no fun
---
trapper is still bugged and they are yet to even acknowledge it üôÇ
---
Then that's ok, I shouldn't judge you for your life choices, just don't expect me to express joy about it.
---
Ghostface is one of the best killers
---
Oni is just hillbilly w/ a more controlled rush and shittier 1HKO that you can't use as often as the hillbilly. He's really cool looking, it sucks that he isn't perhaps a bit faster or something to make the feel of playing him as fun as it looks.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm too used to Bethesda but I don‚Äôt think half the bugs are as bad as people say they are. Maybe I‚Äôve just been lucky, too.
---
Podette
---
Oh, I thought you were going to get judgmental and shit. Pleasant surprise. I was just shitposting. Mostly.
---
&gt; , when I charged up my basic attack in demon rage, survivor just ran left/right and
---
Same i am horrible in it!! but when i see people play online...wow
---
My last game, my teammate got hooked in the basement. She just stood there for a while after being unhooked, so I tried clicking my flashlight to see if she could hear me and follow the sound. Did not work, they DCed. Hope they didn't think I was mocking them or anything.
---
Great
---
Basement is actually pretty rarely the opportune hook if you're not playing like a jackass with the exception of certain killers like trapper, hag, and bubba, and even then you're still gonna be playing like a jackass it's just that your power relies too much on that gameplay.
---
It's extremely easy to juke as a survivor
---
My favourite part about SWF is that at the end, when they have all the gens done, they 99 both exits and go all out trying to save there one teammate who got hooked.
---
I don't like him with Tru3's style of play, but I for the most part I enjoy playing against him
---
Hallelujah! Nobody would listen to me when I said that nothing bad actually happened to Legion.
---
For killers, I suggest you check out "Not Otzdarva" on Youtube who streams on Twitch and uploads on Youtube. He's a rank 1 killer and explains everything he does when he's playing as Killer, explaining his tactics and the reason behind them. Apart from that he's one of the most beloved streamers/personalities in the DbD Community as he's very wholesome, even people who don't play DbD watch him lol.
---
Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/7_yixIT0p58) of him showing the best starter perks for all killer, it's a long video but he explains it very well in detail and you can use timestamps in the comments to find the loadout for the killer you're looking for.
---
Also, if you can you should think of purchasing The Leatherface as soon as possible, he's not the best killer but he has a perk called BBQ &amp; Chilli who helps A LOT when you're farming Bloodpoints as it gives you a 25% increase in BPS for each hooked survivor up to 100%(2 times the Bloodpoints per game) of course you can wait for BBQ in the shrine of secrets but it's REALLY rare as it has been on the shrine only 4 times since DbD came out I think and it was just recently in the shrine
---
It‚Äôs all about timing and hoping the killer would kick the pallet right away rather that walk around lol.
---
Thank you! I have been saying for so long that it wasn't a nerf and I kept getting downvoted into oblivion because two or three perks are slightly less effective now.
---
Atleast it wasn‚Äôt a TCSA
---
Not sure if he really deserved that teabag
---
An infestation of Claudettes
---
Eh I bet DBD is scarier in a dark, cold place.
---
He benefits from "backrevving" like Billy does. You only have to hold it for an extra second so just wait until the right moment.
---
RBTs should still go off whe a survivor uses an exit gate. But they should stall the EGC timer the same as with a downed or hooked survivor.
---
Imagine using NOED on Spirit lmao
---
Eh isnt the kandarian dagger only effective against deadites and demons? Because Oni are more so spirits and Ogres instead those 2.
---
Honestly it wasn't even a big nerf. Deep Wound did jack anyway. If anything it was a buff to Feral Frenzy's base kit (besides on-hits) and it made the add-ons actually worth running with the power
---
Might be right eh I though oni was a demon
---
Upvote for Jesus and Mary.
---
Judging by the fact it currently has 0 points and is only 28% upvoted, I'm going to say people don't think it's ok.
---
I've noticed that the matchmaker is significantly worse than normal ever since the Oni update came out and the people in my games agree.
---
Thats good
---
Yea I mean his ability names kinda do say demon but Oni literally means vengeful spirit or Ogre(I don't get why they called his abilities demon dash and strike now that I think about it)
---
Clown and Doctor just naturally suck
---
HOLD MY BEER
---
First of all, all of the killers' and survivours' souls are belong to entity since it brought then to this realm which belongs to her, and second, it consumes hope of the survivours who think that they can still escape, and when they lose that hope, they become useless to the entity, and it finds someone else (a.k.a new survivours and killers).
---
And being nerd aside, can you make same meme but with the guy from mortal combat who says "your soul is mine"  (forgot his name sr)
---
What was the basement bug
---
And working üò±
---
What did he say
---
# HMMMMMM
---
Bright cosmetics tend to signal that the survivor is unafraid/wants to be chased, which can make new or unconfident killers hesitate. 
---
I just see it as more practice every time I go against skilled survivors.
---
Agreed. It was 10/10 until that
---
Oni isn't ass on console though, he does just fine on Xbox from what I have played and seen. The real killer that is ass on console is Nurse
---
No one should agree with the picture
---
I think it would be funny as a survivor if the killer dc‚Äôd you could see their body drop as if a survivor dc‚Äôd
---
I've been getting games like this as both survivor and killer ever since Oni came out.
---
It's so frustrating to get challenges done this way
---
Truth. I literally walked by a p3  one doing a Gen last night   heard repair sounds looked again. Nothing. They thought I saw them and got up to run.   Scared the shit out of me.
---
Hi, I‚Äôm here to circle jerk more.
---
because that decision requires common sense
---
10000000% agree it‚Äôs basically pitch black in some shadowed areas, like I thought the first Yamaoka map was bad but damn
---
In red/purple ranks, I get SWFs who are more likely than to be the sweaty survivors Reddit killer mains hate. If I get a meme SWF, they're extremely fucking wholesome.
---
Watch the static blast be royally ass and make Doctor even worse than he currently is lol
---
Disable vsync if your on PC
---
I mean if we got quality of skemoo id buy it
---
gotta wonder what they're thinking sometimes
---
So they drop pallets early and now there are less pallets on the map. I see no downside
---
r/dbdgonegay has joined the chat
---
Id love alt moris. I love the charms it just sucks killer doesnt see them much.
---
If you do the survivor and killer tutorials it‚Äôs like 25k blood points each
---
I still remember the good ol' days when a Mike signaled survivors to farm only so he could stalk his infinite mori addons and squash them all.
---
Never tust a guy with a weeze.
---
Honest Opinion: The survivors would see ruin in Gens anyway and the speed deficiency is pretty much a sign that says "He's got that? Oh well, doesn't do much".
---
I mean at least he has an instant down. 
---
He could have a power that does some damage, but only to people you haven't damaged yet. And it's meant to slow the game down but doesn't. And your power gets drained with every basic attack. And just took a slight nerf.
---
They didn't fix the kicking gens bug and I still get stuck when kicking gens. Man, I have to try so hard to not absolutely hate this game.
---
I hit someone through a gen with my chainsaw the other day
---
Wow you‚Äôre awesome. Thank you for taking the time to help a newbie out.
---
Yes, so am I
---
PC or Console?
---
I dont think charms are all the great. We all have the same few charms so it's not really impressive. I'd rather just get cosmetics.
---
You didn't see how he played the entire match
---
When I got the arcade charm I wondered if any of the killers could see it. It‚Äôs the biggest charm but still so tiny!
---
Uh oh, legitimate criticism, time for you to be banned
---
Dead by Daylight 2 lol at this rate they wont make a part 2. They'll just keep making content for this one instead. I would however buy the game again, with a BETTER engine.
---
Yeah. Making some perks slightly less effective while somewhat buffing a few others to be much better, is actually nice. You can still run the other perks, just like all the other killers as well. I just wish I had the perks to make Legion shine. I don't sadly.
---
I'd love the option to change how the abilities look like maybe The Onis Kanabo gets bloodied for doing a specific challenge for him? Or maybe Trappers traps become more silver or clean? Or hell just makes Ghostfaces poof of smoke change color I just wanna customize my killers abilities.
---
Mine is bigger.
---
Lanky Dwight is ***FED UP*** with Wraith's attitude
---
Right, didn't even buy the pass lol
---
Yeah the biggest issue was that you were often joinked of the gen, at least now you can let go for a bit to avoid an insta-down, or even walk a bit to the back until you are sure she is not coming for yours.
---
He does ok if you dont camp though. Like, he can basically be a fragrant tuft Myers if you know when to use the saw
---
You won‚Äôt lose the teachables don‚Äôt worry
---
i would love the charms more if so many didn‚Äôt look the same
---
lmao
---
Survivors take too long to find a match, Killers have it easy plus it makes dodging so much easier.
---
Your right but think about this: There wasting time by taking out every dull totems they see giving you time to get a couple hits off before they actually pop ruin and then again you can use hex haunted ground?
---
The extra 5% buff to his frenzy speed and the faster vaults aren't that useful when his power is even less lethal and does a worse job at stalling the game now.
---
He was already pretty weak before the changes, but these change has likely made him the weakest killer in the game.
---
wait theres a titorial now
---
You can cancel the unhook before actually unhooking them and it'll fix it.
---
Fewer killers at high ranks because thats where the game really starts to show its surv sided balance. Once players are good enough to get into red consistently they know how to abuse the game's mechanics that favour survivors.
---
They're just making his whole gimmick (They started the Deep Wound stuff btw) nullified. I get that it slows the game down and people don't like that, but that's no reason to nerf it into the ground.  
---
And yet, somehow, the Plague stays completely unhated. (don't you LOVE being injured for the entire game or risk certain death by cleansing? me too!)
---
If you have room in your loadout, I would suggest running small game. Not only will it help you short term because you‚Äôll get a ping whenever you look at a hex, it also helps long term because you‚Äôll start to learn hex spawns
---
good old t1 &lt;3
---
Found the Monto sub Pog
---
I was trying to think of a cool sequel name but couldn‚Äôt find any lol.
---
I tried to do the Monstrous Mayhem challenge last night as Freddy. Put one David in the basement, realized no one was asleep at the time so my Dream Snares wouldn't help me catch anyone new and figured "Eh, next game, maybe."
---
Way later, like several minutes, chases, etc in the match realized David was still standing in that basementt, pinging me with a crow. I realized what must have happened and rehooked him to get him out of a bugged game. Felt like shit and decided definitely not to attempt that challenge till the bug was resolved.
---
But somehow me rehooking that David completed the challenge because the game thought he was still hooked? Or something?
---
Still felt like shit. Sorry, David.
---
They said a while back that they're looking into the "Chainsaw Bros" add-ons after Nurse and Doctor. Can't wait for Ultra Rare Bubba saw add-ons
---
Surprised nobody grammar checked the ‚Äúthis‚Äù for the
---
there literally isnt one. Just run a flashlight and 4 perks of your choosing. You will not get saves vs a killer that is a human being.
---
The arcade machines my favorite charm havent taken it off since lol. I want all charms to be available on all characters. Like id love to have the nurses wooden horse on my quentin
---
Literally last night something like this happened with swf. Was getting chased while injured, and on death hook, I see a pallet and loop around the side so I could slam it and run the way I came. A friend was chasing the Killer to try to get their attention so they go towards the pallet... I turn the corner and they drop the pallet and run into me. Killer was nice enough to go after them while I got picked up.
---
Don't Hug Me I'm Scared chapter when?
---
Exactly. He‚Äôs not fat, he‚Äôs just gigantic
---
I gotta say, I play better when in a solo queueing xD
---
Depends how rare it was, only 1/4 was affected my first game, and that might as well be 1/10000, there wasn‚Äôt any memes on reddit even so it took me a few more games to realize chances are pretty high. I‚Äôm sure some killers were aware of it but thought it was just an outlier
---
Oh and if you were running sabo you are going to the basement anyway, the basement is the counter to sabo so you forced it
---
Unnerving Presence works with DS, however I'm not confident in that since if they are good then they won't fail the skillcheck.
---
Every week this gets suggested, and every week it gets explained all the reasons why it isn‚Äôt coming. I‚Äôm starting to think y‚Äôall don‚Äôt check the sub before posting things
---
Was beefing with them and calling them "fucking losers" really necessary?
---
I'm not normally one to shit on Tru3, but he really doesn't play any stealth killer right. He pretty much just treats their stealth mechanics as a way to try and win chases instead of a way to start them.
---
Np welcome to the community but prepare to face many toxic survivors/killers but you will eventually get used to it haha
---
I honestly kinda enjoy the map(besides how dark it is) as survivor and killer. May I ask why you hate it so much?
---
Thank you! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Due to your strong devotion, you have ascended. Praise Jesus.
---
Lol the perks
---
How do you expect us to criticize perfection?   
---
Srsly tho, their expressions are a mood
---
# MINE IS BIGGER
---
BHVR needs to hire more SQA engineers
---
4 privates doesn't always mean SWF tho.
---
Honestly the big boy is underrated. Sure he ain't top tier but he isn't Legion, Wraith, Clown, Doctor level of badness
---
Not a suggestion, change your flair to rant, please.
---
It‚Äôs literally impossible to see anything at all. It‚Äôs totally broken.
---
You won‚Äôt like it as a survivor when you play against plague or get deep wounds and lose all of your vision
---
Limiting the charms to killers or survivors only is stupid imo. I think a killer with an entire hook chart of the original four survivors as charms (just add a fourth position) would be cute an funny.
---
It is incredibly dark. I honestly thought it was the estate map at first until it made me play it 100 times in the darkness.
---
Imaging blocking the word "by"
---
Cant lie i wouldve too thats annoying man
---
I‚Äôm a grower. :(
---
How is ‚ÄúDC on this broken map‚Äù not a suggestion?
---
Oh shut up. SWF is by no means a garenteed win and can be beaten quite easily with sufficient skill, which you clearly lack.
---
yeah, survivor(s) and killer ready up, while people who are spectator click the switch role button because there's a strange thing where if people ready the switch role button becomes available for a second
---
Not that part. I just enjoy anime more than I should.
---
It glows like 90s goo.
---
There are enough pallets on most maps where you can waste pallets and still escape because gen speeds are ridiculous. Lol
---
It's not a Hex Perk if they cleanse all of them but either way Survivors have dealt with Slow Down Legion and they still worked on Gens. Also I don't see this perk being Viable enough for me to waste a slot for that.
---
people have limited times during the day. if you dc you‚Äôre a scumbag and a loser, he ain‚Äôt wrong. you‚Äôre not only screwing your team over but your time.
---
I only bought in hopes that the next rift would be much better!
---
I wouldnt dc against forever freddy. I would just run up to him and kill myself on hook. And thats the go to way now. Dc punishments are nice, but wont solve the core problems
---
"Hey mama, look at me! I'm on my way to the promised land..."
---
Really high chance to go blind after being hooked in the basement. You would remain blind after unhook unto you were picked up or left the basement.but if you are picked up in the basement then you are probably gonna be hooked again, causing more blindness. 
---
Essentially death hook basements
---
I also used it on trapper and it worked
---
"KYS" is also a suggestion, that doesn't mean anyone is going to do it.
---
Yup, i saw those videos on youtube as well lol
---
what are you suggesting that adds to the game? restructure the post
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
To quote the Odd1sout, ‚ÄúI should think about what I post before I post it‚Äù
---
Oh yea totally status effects would make pretty hard to see on it but besides it just being a little too dark isn't that badly designed also considering everyone has been saying to BHVR  they need to make it brighter it seems like it'll get changed
---
/r/uselessnobody
---
Ok anyone and everyone has a right to there opinion
---
Not when their blessed by a lovecraftian elder god
---
Good luck Mr. Otz!
---
Dedicated servers have been on PC for a while now. On switch they‚Äôve been live since launch
---
Ita cool that the rift pass only exists for the charms because they are so small you don't even notice them, meaning the game doesn't become too monetized.
---
Just wind up hatchet at pallet 5Head
---
Thanks for responding!
---
Vengeful Spirit sounds like Demon to me.
---
Discordance is also a really good way of applying pressure by allowing you to know where half a survivor team is at a given moment. It also prevents survivors from quickly finishing a gen by preventing them from grouping up which can be strong during the end-game when you have few gens left.
---
Discordance is also great for most killers as most survivors spawn together allowing you to almost always immediately find the survivor spawns which speed up your ability to apply pressure on survivors.
---
Chases are bad for killers. You're supposed to end them as fast as possible, not attempt to start them.
---
Yeah, an the map appears like every game. It was already a dark map.
---
I haven't played on Badham yet. Only got the new map and Coldwind Farm. But I can imagine, especially the basement of the school.
---
Yep...I‚Äôm pretty new to the game. I‚Äôm a rank 18 killer, and I‚Äôm getting rank 10 and 11 survivors. I‚Äôm getting completely stomped on. It‚Äôs so discouraging
---
Nah, if you play him well, he can be better than billy
---
Yeah its really annoying
---
As I said I don't teabag unless you killer deserves it
---
Sky diving in the realm of the entity
---
Because said players understand that by nature of being a bug, it wasn't intentional &amp; the same benefit of a doubt will be given to a killer who genuinely does not know of the bug.  If you however intentionally apply it with the end goal of breaking someone's game?  Then you're a jerk and deserved to be called out.  And no, this isn't a DBD issue.
---
Oni is pretty much the samurai version of Kali Muscle.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs good.
---
It has plenty of hiding spots for survivors, loops long enough for survivors to utilize and mind game with them, but short enough so they can‚Äôt abuse them. And it‚Äôs visually pleasing.
---
Full disagree.
---
It's not a nerf if you know how to play Legion actually
---
Yea I think people tend to skip over these things or even fail to realize the people that fix the bugs and the people that work on coming up with new content might be different people with different roles.
---
I demand Harajuku Freddy now!
---
That's probably where killers go when they get "entity disappointed"
---
Ash has fought waaaay larger things than Oni lol
---
Yeah. Wish there was a mode you could queue up for where ranks were non-existent. Sometimes you'd be the bug, sometimes you'd be the windshield.
---
Run Small Game or Detective's Hunch, or just bring a map. After that you'll start to learn totem spawns on the maps.
---
Third seal be like
---
"ok back to the pit with you clown"
---
Yeah because why should there being an active game breaking bug demand an ounce of sportsmanship of you? /s
---
Dead before dawn? Idk if that exists already I just think it sounds acceptable
---
I‚Äôm a shower that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in jail
---
And Demon literally means Evil Spirit. Your point lol?
---
Ultimate strategy
---
Why is this tagged as Rant?
---
You were completely lost xD
---
Always have been
---
Just change your region that‚Äôs what I di-I mean move to Denmark like I did
---
can't the coders add a fucking height check to make sure someone doesn't fall for an eternity? teleport them when they cross a certain point?
---
I use the glitch when a surviver t-bags and farms his teammates
---
Good point but it honestly does depend still because is the Oni a vengeful spirit or a Ogre because he got his revenge
---
Less than a year old
---
Not me, but a SWF team who bodyblocked a teammate cleansing my "ruin" totem. They were teabagging and pointing all while they did it, when they cleanse the totem they find it is in fact NOT ruin hut haunted ground, which led to me downing all 4 in the same spot, which then led to all 4 Dc'ing and then in the post game chat going on about how lucky i was and how OP haunted ground is. I was just in hysterics about it, absolutely hilarious to have them teabag while bodyblocking only to have the ego and arrogance wiped away in an instant.
---
Be grateful for paying them money to deliver a broken game after every patch? Also, have they ever apologized for doing so? Point me to a time in recent months they have said they are sorry for inconveniencing their players. It's one thing to make mistakes, but then to not show any regret for wasting your player base's time is another.
---
tfw oni means ogre in japanese
---
Honestly wasn‚Äôt sure if I should‚Äôve had it but it adds a little something. Damn I just realized I could‚Äôve done ‚Äúno killer in DBD:‚Äù ‚Äúthe oni:‚Äù
---
"I think we did a pretty good job, so far."
---
No we need stable framerate
---
I‚Äôd be more on board with the charms if there weren‚Äôt so many lame recoloured ones. Like a couple of the same charms recoloured, fine, but 5 plant ones???
---
I felt the same way - also, does anyone else think theres a lot of grassy areas? Most of the time I spent crashing into survivors crouched in bushes lol
---
He isn't wrong
---
That‚Äôs me!! Hahaha
---
Damn! Just saw you beat me to it!
---
Like 25ish
---
Survivor pip loss sucked but what can you do....
---
You can't just remove him, people paid for him.
---
How do you do that on play store? Do I need a vpn?
---
Lol told ya
---
&gt;This is true for things you can do that you're not suppose to be able to do, that's exploiting a bug.
---
Okay, so then by this logic: should hooking a player break their game?
---
Henceforth, by your own logic, intentionally hooking and banking on it bugging &amp; breaking their game is exploiting a bug.
---
Ah, happened to me earlier today, didn't realise it was so widespread. Made my piss boil though.
---
You could also wait for her under a hook instead of cleansing. That way you at least won‚Äôt fuck up the game for your teammates
---
Maybe for a few seconds at a time. Not during skill checks, tho. :'(
---
Is that suppose to mean something?
---
unpopular but right opinion: don't let the reddit circlejerk get you down
---
Well glad it‚Äôs not just me.
---
They basically made it easier to apply his power but ruined most of what made it ok in the first place.
---
Dude this made me think it would be kind of cool to have cosmetics change certain color details in the game, have no idea what those details should be tho lol   
---
~~Also unlikely to happen as they don't even have colourblind settings~~
---
It‚Äôs good if you only care that survivors have a map where killers literally cannot fine them lmfao
---
This is this most survivor main biased shit I have ever read 
---
If they only brightened it up it would still have all those hiding places and loops. But it wouldn‚Äôt be fucking broken
---
well he's not that common even though he is terrifying and difficult to be against in the right hands from my experience.
---
It adds people not playing on a broken map
---
There.
---
As much as I don't want to say "Japanese lady is a ninja", I do have a pretty good look for Yui right now that mostly looks the part.
---
Basic pants, covered face, and the tank top + bra combo. She's got cool looking arm guards and the colors match.
---
Damn didn't even see that it was them until you pointed that out, the fuck?
---
At least that's how I kinda always understood it. I still may be wrong ofc.
---
I like them. They‚Äôre cute. You‚Äôre right that the rift has too many tho. Not really a big deal since it‚Äôs the first one and this is what introduced them tho but I do hope they pull back in the future
---
that‚Äôs still....not a suggestion. 
---
(I think the map is too dark, i wish they changed areas of brightness) &lt;- that‚Äôs a suggestion
---
Yeah it does make the killer more powerful so you're that shitty teammate that fucks over your other 4 teammates when they get instadowned bc you wanted to be selfish and cleanse so bad
---
How is it a non-issue?   
---
Are you delusional or something?
---
Pretty cool, maybe add some other survivors too into the mix
---
its good actually
---
I don‚Äôt like it when the Halloween timeline is convoluted with backstories and reasoning. Sometimes there are just people that are plain evil. There‚Äôs no reason to it. He has an obsession, and that‚Äôs what makes it even scarier. The fact that some people are like that, and have a compulsive need to kill.
---
You‚Äôre playing a losing game if you have a team that cleanses. You need to be lucky and get a really bad plague to survive it. Not a reason to leave the game though
---
I love you papi
---
Lol no
---
add-onless wraith would like a word
---
That huge battering ram is studded for pleasure not pain. You are missing out.
---
Wow, seriously? Where are they?
---
People need to stop this white knight shit, BHVR ain't gonna give you some sort of cosmetic you don't already own, give you all the DLC free, etc.
---
BHVR has had a track record of releasing garbage and this is no different. They released optionally free content, but it's behind many days worth of play time to unlock 1 side of it and they gave free cosmetics with the main reason being to try and stop the trading people would do which was not only for insane prices but were easily and likely often scams which BHVR isn't responsible or obligated to do anything about. With the free content they've released a ton of paid content, sure it's all optional and cosmetic but they've still done it.

A lot of the issues with the game have been present for a long time and in some cases completely screwed the community. When the save data bug was a regular issue two of my friends that played had it happen and 1 of them had SPECIFICALLY played and grinded to get P3 Nea before the Legacy cosmetics were released, they had their data wiped and got I think it was like 68 million BP refunded but no legacy. They've contacted multiple times to try and get help on it and they've never done anything I believe around 3 years later by this point.
---
Point is that BHVR has created a lot of issues with the game and while it's great that they are dedicated to updating the game after so long, every update leaves me wondering, "What's going to be broken this time?" Which unfortunately is hard to win because a lot of the issues make no sense especially considering how they make it through QA testing. Like the tinkerer bug where I believe tier 2 Tinkerer would completely remove your terror radius if I'm not mistaken or how about the opposite where if I remember correctly ANYBODY hearing the terror radius would make EVERYBODY hear. Every time they release shit, things that don't make sense to break somehow become broken.
---
I thought the /s stood for serious.
---
Like the other guy said, not screaming is nice, but it seems they only nerfed it to not work when youre exausted, which basically removed combos like deadhard plus balanced, where you could not stagger while you were exausted. Which i never really used both. So personally it feels the same
---
Jason Takes A Boat isn't as catchy of a title.
---
The issue is if you just hook someone in the basement because you need the momentum or something you get accused of abusing the bug.
---
Ahh, so this is what roid rage looks like.
---
catching anything with this bait?
---
Obviously he dismounted his boomstick and chainsaw when he came.
---
miese Sache
---
Yeah I know all that but it doesn't change the fact that the game intended for people to cleanse even if it is worse overall
---
Legions just needs a complete new power. Can‚Äôt think of any way they could tweak his power that wouldn‚Äôt be boring as hell to go against
---
Demo isn't good though, I think he was second to last in sacrifice rates.
---
I had to get my 5 basement's hooks. Felt terrible after everyone let me know what was happening.
---
Happens to the best of us when we got 40+ teachables lol
---
It‚Äôs absolutely not good to have a map where it is quite literally impossible to see survivors
---
Ya he def needs a full rework but it would be nice to have a temporary buff
---
Oh you want me to make a suggestion to BHVR.
---
DC is absolutely a suggestion to people playing. You should have been more clear
---
Yeehaw brother. Learning totem spawns and loop locations shot me up
---
Very boring. So i just don't play survivor anymore.
---
Killers at least get whole new play styles every 3 months due to new killers/powers.
---
Survivors run and do gens for 3+ years.
---
I've just come to terms that, as someone who plays both killer and Survivor, I'm a a toxic piece of shit and I will bitch about survivors being OP while I play killer but then turn around and bitch that killers are overpowered when I play Survivor. It's a vicious cycle that I can only blame myself for
---
Neas are just wannabe no0b3s
---
Plague is the one killer I‚Äôd say can‚Äôt be ‚Äúranked‚Äù. Her power is either one of the best in the game (if survivors cleanse), or very, very underwhelming (they don‚Äôt cleanse). Corrupt Purge Plague is leagues better than Huntress, but Vile Purge Plague is leagues worse.
---
You only need to charge up like 0.3 seconds and then you will insta down anything infront of you. If the person is looping you try to hold it longer because then you will do more like a lunge attack. The easiest is of course to play on computer where you can bind Q and E to look left and right. So you Demon Dash at someone, when the time has come to release the BAM BAM you hold the equivalent button Q or E and you move your mouse in the survivors direction. Survivor pudding mhmm. Also practice him with a buddy in a custom lobby. Very important to get a feel for him!
---
Also Otzdarva tested him very carefully in his PTB stream. You can learn a lot from that stream just like I did because I have no one to test him in custom games.
---
Yeah I know I already said that. Doesn't change the fact the game intented people to cleanse
---
I can't tell if the changes are breaking even or if they are a nerf.
---
Definietly not a buff
---
I legit thought the wiggle thing was a new perf the killers had.
---
imagine this with devour hope
---
the survivors dont suspect a thing but when they see that exposed effect they dead
---
If only this wasn't a kyf
---
Nah more like you spawn on it, and it's gone within first 15 seconds.
---
I mean sure, they can brighten it up. I‚Äôm fine with that. But the map design is quite good.
---
Also I play both sides very regularly, and im red ranks with both killer and survivor, so hush with that survivor main garbage.
---
I'm glad this is getting handled so quickly, but this shouldn't have been as big of an issue on launch day of Cursed Legacy as it has been. The game needs improvements on it's framework or gamebreaking bugs and glitches like these are just gonna keep happening. A couple months dedicated to that I'm sure would improve this game significantly.
---
Oh I agree it‚Äôd be awesome. 
---
Heck I want cosmetic options for different mori styles, and I want to be able to customize the color of the hooks even. 
---
There are so many things they could do, and my wallet is thankful they don‚Äôt.
---
Lmao okay bud
---
Usually yes but I wouldn't be surprised if BHVR has them doubling on to speed up production
---
I'm a terrible person.
---
This explains why the Nancy wouldn't leave the basement.
---
People are usually toxic in response to toxic players. It‚Äôs a neverending cycle.
---
Gotta keep chasing the killer and shining it into the back of their head til it works
---
His lore also said before he came he was wearing only boxers. Now he has an entire wardrobe.
---
Kill me
---
Precisely. Survivors need some type of new feature, new perks aren‚Äôt always gonna make the game more fun over all for survivor
---
Right, but most stealth killers' abilities are not exactly great for ending chases. They're designed to give you an easy first hit. Trying to use it to mindgame in a chase (pig's dash, GF's crouching at low walls) doesn't normally work on survivors unless you're in green ranks. Red ranks have played against it enough to see it coming and counter it easily. 
---
It's usually more effective to just get your easy first hit, and then either chase them normally or break off and try and cut them off with stealth/go for someone else to apply pressure.
---
Yep just like how survs weren‚Äôt punished for the Wake Up bug a few months ago, shame on the ppl that knowingly exploited it but they def will not be punished.
---
Deep wound isn‚Äôt for downing it‚Äôs for pressure and wasting survivors time. I main legion and I think I‚Äôve downed maybe five survivors with deep wound
---
Yeah, he‚Äòs mostly a m1 killer, but with his power, he is better than billy. He can charge, can‚Äòt bump into objects, one hit, destroy pallets with his weapon, charge his one-hit faster than billy. So yeah... and leatherface is a completely other thing. He is just baaaaad
---
*Removed issue that caused Legion to win*
---
oof thats like a +15-25 h playtime
---
Can you elaborate on pont #8 a little? I didn't know there was a way to change how much of a vault you get?
---
maybe you should stop playing this game for a while, it‚Äôs getting you worked up
---
Thana is still great, while SB and STBFL are slightly weaker on Legion, they're still viable. There are also much better perks out there for him now. Things like PWYF, Bamboozle and Fired Up. Thana is also going to be way better on Legion now, because you should be able to apply more DWs in a small time frame.
---
In the ‚Äûhelp‚Äú section I think... At least there, where everything is explained
---
Wait what actually happened?
---
But for real there's a reason why clip ends just before chat and that reason is...gg baby killer noob tunnel toxic camp get rekt easiest game of my life xd...
---
honestly the best one I've read so far.
---
Imagine seeing her yeet a Hatchet into your face
---
Now for the other small things like the carry music playing forever
---
That last one is me when I have spine chill on, no heartbeat, don't see the killer and turn around to see Myers/Ghostface 2 feet away looking at me.
---
Hate the dev, not the player, I made this argument countless times, but it's time to start hating their design decisions rather than hating eachother on this stupid reddit.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you guys talking about. We need higher and stable framerate that‚Äôs it. I play on 80% sens that allows to 180 pretty fucking fast. 100% is too much. Even higher sens not gonna help at all. It‚Äôs like cough pills when you need antibiotics
---
It's a happy rant. I didn't know what else to tag it as.
---
Exactly üòÇ just chillin on a gen and not noticing you‚Äôre being stalked
---
The killer claimed in the post game lobby that he was somehow stuck inside a generator for 2 mins and then got teleported to killer shack, he came to pick me up from behind the rock I'm looking at 15 seconds into the video like 10 seconds later.
---
The piece is wonderful! :) The figures for both characters are a bit off, but I'm assuming that it's intentional by how well it's been executed. You could try drawing a bit of scenery, but that's not much of a requirement and more like an idea. I like it though, especially since the faces are so expressive. :&gt;
---
Just bc it's in the game doesn't mean you should do it. Do you stand there and teabag and click your flashlight on and off constantly just bc "it's in the game"?!
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
Wannabe entity
---
You seem upset. Would you like an ice cream cone?
---
Probably clipped trough the map, when you do the hitbox of the gate might have come in contact with hers
---
No. Game already runs on Unreal Engine which is decent, switching from one to another is really tricky and basically comes down to rewriting the entire code more or less; it really depends.
---
Another key factor that's really important is if the game was built to have some sort of modularity built in to it (Which I'm going to assume this game does not)
---
Also depending on the engines they have their own physics, particle engines, and such so yea if it ain't gonna work they have to re-do everything in those departments.
---
The thing you're speaking about (skeemo renders) can be achieved without the need to switch engines.
---
What do you plan on doing with the shards because when i got back into the game after a while i made a big mistake of wasting mine on thicc jane for head on and i dont use her or her perks. So if you plan on buying a survivor for one of their its best to just wait for it in the shrine
---
That's because you've only had 3 games with him. Trust me, Oni is definetly top tier. Good survivors have already adapted to him but you'll adapt too if you practice.
---
They already do heal before looking in boxes. In fact, they heal and then do a gen and then go looking for boxes. There's no sense of urgency to get them off at all.
---
I agree but everyone seems to act like with the change to deep wound they‚Äôll never down anyone when it wasn‚Äôt really like that before either.
---
Fighting fire with fire will just make the fire burn brighter if you‚Äôre toxic then they‚Äôll be more toxic
---
???
---
sorry but whats the issue here
---
No, typically you download the file (depends on device, like an APK for Android) then use a VPN.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ok but honestly if you‚Äôve ever played in a sweaty swf  you can see how unbelievably op they can be (unless your nurse or spirit and POSSIBLY oni but it‚Äôs too early to tell ) which can cause competitive players (killers) to start to dodge/ quit the game entirely. Because it‚Äôs not fun to play a game you have a literal zero chance of winning. Not saying it‚Äôs right just there is a reason for it
---
Same, in my experience Claudettes are either the bane of your existence when you queue solo or the best teammates ever, no in betweens
---
The meme is that he‚Äôs fumbling around blindly trying to find the hex totem
---
Umm you ok? I didn't say because it's in the game it's ok I just pointed out that when the plauge was released survivors were meant to cleanse but through a learning process we as a community found out not cleansing is better. And even though I agree not cleansing is the better option the game still wants you to cleanse anyways, doesn't mean you have to but that's how it was originally INTENDED
---
Spine chill makes bitches out of all of us
---
Thank you this is really useful! And lovely voice lol
---
I‚Äôve always accepted that as normal hmm...so it‚Äôs not
---
I have BBQ I on my Bubba (1, 41), Huntress (50+), Spirit (3, 50+) and Piggy (1, 23). I also never got level 3 bbq and that's why I just prestiged Pig
---
I don't know why it's happening, but I love the influx of Skyrim Crossover memes. :)
---
Ah. You should spend the time playing Nurse to get it. It‚Äôs worth picking up. Also, Nurse is still S-tier and worth learning to play.
---
You guys are really underestimating him. He's at top A tier with Billy. After testing him out for about 15+ games and watching others play him, I for sure think he's better than Huntress.
---
Honestly the best thing you can do is to try and get a friend to play with and going to the match together and purposely have him get hooked and then sacrifice yourself to unhook him and have him Escape.
---
I would play killer way more often but i play on xbox and it takes around 20-30 minutes just to find a lobby
---
But survivor it usually takes 2-5 minutes so i stick with survivor mostly
---
I‚Äôm at worked up at all.
---
This is the kind of thing people fall back on when they have no point so congrats on that
---
Shit stain
---
I know how to play legion. I‚Äôve played them since their release religiously. It‚Äôs a nerf
---
Not if you always run small game. :D
---
Yo guys wtf why im the killer
---
I thought I was crazy. I couldn't remember if it was always like that but I was pretty sure it wasn't.
---
You do realize the lighting is part of map design?
---
Fuckingmoron
---
I'm on console so it ain't worth it on console lol.
---
The interior isn't even that bad. You can't even see generators at maybe 3/4 the distance you can on Ormond.
---
A medium vault is a running vault that wasn't perfect. You can tell by whether you slide over the vault or if you climb over it (where your feet touch the window). A fast vault is when you hit the running vault perfectly by lining up with the window and hitting the vault button at the last second. Test a few vaults and you'll see what I mean.
---
I have definitely done that before. I play using a controller when I play survivor and there are plenty of times where I'm approaching a window that I plan to vault as I'm being chased so I start spamming my button and suddenly I jump into a locker. At that point I'm frantically trying to get out but the killer just grabs me. Definitely lots of dumb fuck juice there.
---
:D
---
It is intended I believe, as a part of last patches spirit nerf
---
Still worth it to spend 13k more for it and get 50% bloodpoints while you grind more
---
Can I ask what was changed? Couldn‚Äôt play the PTB
---
Ok, well sorry for trying to help, I still have not had any issue with that.
---
Vile Purge Plague has normal movement speed, doesn't need to waste time refilling her at random spots on the map, can easily apply Broken, can use her power to track gens and survivors, and even has addons that will guarantee she can Corrupt once anyway. And that's still not even factoring in how much more game knowledge you need to play Huntress at her best.
---
I think she's better than Huntress, but I can at least see how people might not agree.
---
Level 50 and I just now get bbq 1
---
The power role in the game is the devs making us pay for dumbass cosmetics like the dumbasses we all are, but go off I guess.
---
The game is as balanced as it has ever been, surviving is not toxic, the same way killing isn‚Äôt toxic, mate
---
What was the other player trying to do?
---
Just had a game where the first person went down near the basement, and then it domino's into everyone being in there. I thought they were meming when they just stood still after being unhooked. Of course, they all sent me a message with no end of abuse on it üòî
---
Same, I wanna knoooow. Dumbass comments feed me lmao
---
This happened to me i can confirm this is what happens
---
I would as long as the game plays the same and performance is still good.
---
Who is that girl in the lower picture? I would love to play her! Honestly. They look very different to me.
---
Survivors: *be as toxic as possible*
---
Killers: *do the same*
---
Survivors *C O W A B U N G A  I T  I S*
---
I like where this is going. Please tell me more man of culture
---
Wazzzup
---
Idk. I drop them out of the basement but you could probably just pick and drop. Not sure if it works
---
Absolutely no idea.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6nu9d/survivors_getting_basement_glitched_be_like/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Instructions unclear my oni got stuck in a gen
---
I forgot how gross new Freddy looked
---
Is that a joke? The not counting as a basic attack change was as bad as when they gave them a normal terror radius instead of the smaller one for surprise jumps.
---
The nerf was a nerf, they just buffed them in other weird places they were already ok at. Once again Legion becomes more limited in builds it can run.
---
Love running Scratched Mirror Meyers and waiting around corners for survivors who are trying to sneak around
---
Who is one of the better stealth killers to watch?  I watch Otz a good bit but he tends to stick with trapper.
---
Make it so that the last item touched by the survivor using the white ward disappears from the map when they die. Like how it works when they are holding the item, but now it affects the item where ever it is.
---
Uh huh, what a perfect timing, am I right? All 4 were waiting at the exit gates and it just happens that someone DDOS'es right at the end of a match. Seems absolutely believable. I don't know why anyone would doubt this
---
dude I put about 2 mil BP into huntress after I already had level 50 with 80% of the perks in the game for her just to get BBQ the web practically refused to five it to me so i get it it's all RNG like it take me forever to get thanatphobia for some killers while some I got it in the first 10 levels
---
Maybe the server you were on just disconnected everyone ? I'm not tech genius but I believe a DDOS would shut your whole internet out for at least a couple minutes wouldn't it ?
---
If you got DDOSd your router would crash/have to reboot. This is obviously just a random blip with the server.
---
Nah, fuck that. I've been having tons of fun on it with Trapper, hag and Ghostface. Plenty of places for the survivors to hide and places for me to hide myself and traps. Pretty well-balanced for stealth and trap play styles.
---
Imagine creating a mechanic for a specific character only, and making that mechanic useless as shit.  
---
Gotta love it, amirite?
---
I usually tunnel just to get rid of it near the beginning of the match then I swap targets once they use it. Scummy but it works
---
Cant help with most of this, but remember that ghost face's shroud removes the red light, meaning if you are at a brick gym, activating shroud may make the survivor wind up running into you
---
Other than that, watch videos. I main survivor so admitedly I'm not the best person to advise you, I just watch alot of Painreliever
---
EDIT: as for enduring and co, if you play akiller whose power has little use in chases (like wraith) its necessary, if not in depends on your build
---
that confusion, "I'm on the ground, why am I on the ground...."
---
Xi Jinping says: I thought I stripped you of your humanity?
---
Legion was already a bottom 3 killer and he got nerfed AGAIN.
---
Indeed here and it's amazing 4ks after 4ks
---
As someone else stated in the comments, if you go to the charms section of your cosmetics while waiting for a lobby, it‚Äôll replace him with a hook. He can‚Äôt roar if he‚Äôs not there :)
---
This is why I prestige my characters only if don't get BBQ within my first prestige. If I get even BBQ 1 in my first prestige I'm not prestiging cause the system sucks.
---
I got the same bug. what fixed it for me was restarting the game
---
More likely that the game crashed. It sucks but it happens. 
---
I was DDOSed for tunnelling someone and they added me as a friend on steam (I never accepted) and at the end screen told me enjoy having no internet, he DDOSed me for 4 hours straight. You'll know when you get DDOSed.
---
Me too
---
thanks for the info
---
They weren't waiting for a lobby though
---
The answer is right in front of your eyes, absorb the generator to Free Yourself
---
Nice! Are Hex Spawns always certain though?
---
So timing the space bar is the trick to success here correct
---
I know. That‚Äôs just a tip for when they‚Äôre waiting for a game.
---
I'll never forget until they rework them
---
I love how they keep releasing paid skins for characters they keep nerfing. their right hand is stabbing their left.
---
#Relatable
---
I also did and the changes have actually made me even better. I already didn't use on hit perks before the change and I did just fine cause I didn't rely on them to be effective plus DWs was already pointless ever since the rework and nerfing it means nothing. Maybe the only problem I can think of is mending taking less time but then again 3 more seconds isn't going to win you games and you have the pin addons which are super good to suffice. If you know what you are doing you can use the extra speed and vaulting to your advantage and chain hits more efficiently and apply more map pressure, instead of holding on to one set of meta perks and crying that the already useless DWs is impossible to down with. Inb4 muh time stalling, again he stalls time just fine, he can get to places faster and hurt more people even if they stay injured for slightly less time.
---
New Oni Power: Now Oni can fucking absorb gens
---
It can only be fixed if the killer picks you up if someone unhooks you but then it‚Äôs only for a second because they normally put you right back on the hook
---
I really want Rules set 2 could be part of Amanda‚Äôs main load-out in her power. Probably change the add-on to where a survivor starts the trial with a reverse bear trap already on their head.
---
Imagine if we still had old Balanced Landing, it'd be even worse.
---
They said the speed boost you get when coming out is supposed to be gradual like the wraith because some of her add ons covered too much distance. But it also depends on what add-ons you were using.
---
So honestly, it would be a buff if legion could drop pallets on himself, he could destroy the God pallet instantly
---
wait isnt that the freddy dbds based on?
---
There is not a single reason why oni should be even be near top tier.
---
I wish you'd get some points for them or that they did something outside of just a cosmetic. Like, maybe if you're hooked and you and the killer share similar charms, you both get some BP? Lol idk, just goofing around with some ideas here.
---
Legion is not doing any worse than before. They weren't gutted, and the add-ons for their power are actually worth using now.
---
Nope longer than that. I ran them when I started in June last year.
---
I wouldn't say NOTHING bad happened. But there's more good than bad. It would have been nice to have the movement speed increase along with FF applying SB and STBFL. Heh
---
the way archives work, people do get to the end of whats released and then when the next part is released everyone is tryign to do the same bit. And they did only just release it at the same time as this bug...
---
So the previous thing i said is obviously joking by saying the exact situation which is going on... except for that last line. which seems legit.
---
Im rank 16 killer against rank 2 survivors it sucks
---
Im not talking about the haloween timeline im talking about the Entity who is the elder god present in dbd
---
Console needs higher sensitivity
---
Why would you think that they made Franklins to counter white ward? That's such a weird take. There is no benefit to the killer at all from preventing the survivor from keeping their item post-trial beyond a "fuck you". In fact, white wards/Franklins working the way they do now means the items stay in the trial and the key that you knocked out of someones hand could be used to escape in the same trial if another survivor picks it up. 
---
Making white ward take your item out of the match with you when you die would be an unambiguous buff to Franklins.
---
Thought he‚Äôd be fun mechanically on Xbox w a controller but so far without any of my good perks he‚Äôs a low d tier rn
---
I think he means it didn't effect anyone in his game, which did happen. It only bugged me out half the time when I was hooked, and the other games I was just fine.
---
you could have litterally countered that strat with preplacing pallets doe
---
So, it'd be business as usual then? Survivors complain 100% of the time anyways.
---
I mean yeah, but deep wound was really good for applying map pressure and now that it got nerfed it‚Äôs hard not to get gen rushed. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely harder now, but if you‚Äôre still doing well your still doing well ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The slow down which was already weak, has been nerfed, sloppy and STBFL don‚Äôt work anymore, Filthy Blade got nerfed, and deep wounds have lost any pressure they had. If they‚Äôre running across the map to a generator, they don‚Äôt have to mend until they get there. Again their slowdown is literally just 12-8 seconds now, then they‚Äôre back on the gen. Not exactly ‚Äústalls time just fine.‚Äù Also inb4 you say ‚Äúhaha I predicted what you were gonna say in my funni inb4 joke‚Äù
---
Really it didn‚Äôt feel like this long
---
His ability is better than Billy's in every way but it has a timer. Have you seen gameplay of him? I'd go as far as to say he's even better than Billy.
---
That's the biggest part, yeah. But if you come at the vault from a harsh angle you'll miss it too.
---
You should read the end of the patch notes on console. The dev's stated it's a known bug that the oni on console is already too sensitive compared to pc and they plan to fix it. Sorry bud.
---
Oh ok. I thought you talking about the Druid curse on Micheal.
---
You gonna learn today...
---
She is, freddy is easy to go against, just drop pallets early simple.
---
Bug hasn't been fixed. Got hooked last two games and fell through the floors.
---
I got so lucky, was playing SWF and they decided to slug and then soft camp my friends body after I had been altruistic all game. So I started working on a gen while they played that game and completed it after my friend died.

Free cosmetics are trash, framerate on consoles still dog shit. Sorry but his point is invalid
---
I first encountered the bug when I was facing a doc. I had tier 3 madness and I was like, "woah what, T3 madness can prevent wiggle now?!?" I was also shocked before I went down so I thought it was a power addon like Huntress' exhaustion one.

Bro im here trying to do a rift challenge and people are now gonna hate me BECAUSE I WANT BLOODPOINTS AND TIERS thanks community
---
When she had Vile charged she had 115% movespeed and she didn't become nearly as slow when charging it which ment you could keep up with survivors when spewing on them. Also people still cleansed which made her almost top tier attack that time. But on release to live she was nerfed for some reason and there she is in her awkward self.
---
Im just glad I finished my basement challenges in time. But if the basement if the closet hook then sorry but you‚Äôre going to the basement
---
Are charge add ons fixed yet? Don‚Äôt want to waste my gel dressings &gt;.&lt;
---
this happens way too often üòÇüòÇ
---
First game, I wondered why the survs weren't doing anything. Went to the basement, they're all clipping into the wall
---
I love that top, but I wish the gloves were removable üòè
---
It gets boring in the long run but same time killer is really stressful too, I dont want a 4k I just want 4 bbq stacks D:
---
Charms are honestly just filler.
---
That change was to demon dash, his ability to turn and strafe was too powerful, the real problem is that you can't flick the attack afterward and survivors can easily counter it by just turning a bit
---
Why, does she already have a one-hit down that I'm not aware of?
---
My devil ghostface mask disagrees.
---
but i mean u could just preplace pallets and it would work the survivors would just have less loops idk is that really that op?
---
And fuck people over when there are no pallets left? Even if he doesn't break it, he can snare trap it and make any distance you would've gained go down the drain

Just thought I should let you know but the addons that make more skill checks at boxes increases the chance by 1/1.25/2%. They are extremely useless. Her only good add on imo is the status effect ones and straps.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6o4cj/can_you_actually_get_banned_for_changing/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I mean, you do have a bright white Oni though
---
Boi, i actually checked it after literally typing in "ASMR- The Dead by Daylight devs beat me up in a dark alley for maining the Legion" am i stupid?
---
Lol. I'm on Xbox One S and survivor queues literally take like 30 seconds to get in 4man lobby
---
*Nerfs again out of spite*
---
First time?
---
(Where's my upvote?)
---
Glad I finally got the chance to tell it.
---
He's copied and pasted the description of the survivor perk named "Hope".
---
From my understanding "copying" is it installing. Yes its ridiculously slow.
---
Imagine thinking it was a good idea to implement a killer that forces you to stay injured for the entire game or risk total annihilation.
---
This is why the devs aren't going to change their ways, because every time they have major fuckups the whiteknights come out of the woodwork and defend them until there's no tomorrow. 
---
They are not some small company anymore. They've received a lot of income lately with the bunch of content that they dished out. The number of employees are in the hundreds. Stop acting like they're a bunch of rookies who are still learning how to type code in high school with Visual Basic. The recent issues could have been prevented had they not rushed to release so much content at once. And this happens to them constantly with every DLC. They don't learn from their mistakes but instead they've been fucking up even worse.
---
**No I'm not saying to criticize them  on everything they do. There are things that they do quite well. The content is great; I can't say no to that. The cosmetics team also does a really nice job overall** But call them out when the game gets plagued with errors, bugs, and glitches. They are prioritizing new content over fixing the game's current health. That alone should tell you what their stance is for this game in the long term.
---
They know what they're doing at this point, and it's inexcusable to defend them with a passion when every single update comes with a new variety of problems, some of which break the game. And people have a right to complain when they spent dozens of dollars in this game to show support and yet the product they receive is barely even functional, lacks QoL improvements, and has very poor optimization on all platforms, three and a half years in the making.
---
Just because you get a lot of new content doesn't mean you should ignore all of the things wrong with this game. "Be a little grateful" How about you guys wake the fuck up?
---
Bullshit. You know you're just saying that to cover your own toxicity. You're a douche.
---
Spirit shouldn‚Äôt need to use noed. She is extremely viable at any rank. Noed benefits killers that lack map pressure early game. Spirit‚Äôs phase ability helps her control the map early game and, ideally, makes noed redundant on her.
---
All I'm thinking about when I see this is No0b3 haha. But seriously it's an amazing cosplay ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I got downvoted once for saying their should be a fix to dribbling back when ds worked differently
---
I love it
---
I always get a 4K with Pig since there‚Äôs so much grass, and I blend in with the dark shadows
---
Guess what there response was
---
Same, was also like stop fkin moving all the time so I can see what you look like!!
---
gottem
---
Dang Feng was chainsawed into the shadow realm.
---
I mean, doesn't ghostface have an all black costume as well?
---
Looks pretty full of replies to me.
---
These changes are all great ideas, but the next killers getting changes after Doctor are Leatherface and Hillbilly as of now
---
This guy is obnoxious.
---
Tbh being able to drop pallets dosen‚Äôt sound bad
---
I remember people saying that same line a long time ago. That the legions nerfs were just set up for a rework. But truth is a rework doesn't need set up. I mean look at Freddy. No nerfs to him before he got reworked.
---
^Don't ^do ^that, ^don't ^give ^me ^hope
---
Thank you! I drew this in school so I didn‚Äôt have much time to work on it and scenery is a thing I‚Äôm not all that good at, but I appreciate the genuine criticism!
---
Godforbid someone wants to try and win as killer.
---
Honestly Oni does pretty well on console. Not as hindered by sensitivity as the likes of the ranged killers and Nurse
---
Every solo survivor ever
---
what bug?
---
Bill's ugly sweater is the best thing ever, how dare you
---
Yea that is most certainly not true
---
And people wonder why Freddy, Ghostface, and Hillbilly run rampant on Xbox
---
Yeah maybe on people who are good with her. Maybe this person was just starting to play her and learning her. Which seems obvious as three people were still alive at the end so no reason that player should be shamed for using a perk. Quit trying to shame people for using certain perks. That goes for all the assholes talking shit about survivors who use self care.
---
Detective hunch &gt; small game
---
Ok so I've been playing Oni alot on console but I gotta ask why does flicking matter so much? I mean just because he can't flick on console doesn't mean he is useless, he is still very much viable(also just going to make sure I'm correct, flicking with the Oni just means turning incredibly fast right?)
---
Not to mention Black Incense deletes any chance of winning
---
* Repost - Reposts of a previously posted image, video or meme within 3 months are not allowed.
---
I‚Äôll take a guess and say you play on console? 
---
The Killer force closing the application has been around for an unhealthy amount of time and becomes frustratingly frequent during double BP events which just ends up with Survivors wasting their time and walking away with nothing. The fact this hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet is inexcusable.
---
Filthy blade was already a pointless addon and the fact that people say it's such a bother that it got nerfed shows that they are just trying to be crybabies about everything. I already explained to you why the slowdown didn't get nerfed, you have more map pressure and the ability to inflict more deep wounds in exchange for them lasting 3s less. STBFL, Sloppy and Franklin's were good perks on Legion but if you can't live without them then you then you don't know how to play Legion effectively. Am I mad that they are gone and think it's a stupid, uneeded change? Definitely. But I can't do anything about it and I know how to play effectively enough to not need them.  Also, survivors at high ranks don't &lt;&lt;run around&gt;&gt; unless they need to because they understand that scratchmarks are a thing and, since they are injured because of DW, blood trails too. Survivors already just stood still whenever you left them chasing someone else, mended and went on their merry way, that's just how it is when you are playing Legion but now you can actually use your ability to patrol more and chain hits more efficiently, This ultimately means that more survivors are not doing gens because tehy are busy mending and healing themselves. If you actually decided to play the new Legion you will understand that he is stronger.
---
The devs of this game are famously bad, nothing new about that sadly
---
Theres no she remains unhated. On god plagues depending on my mood by then I'll usually just kill myself if i get hooked or just leave
---
Ohhh so this is more common than I thought? Explains why people have been going for basement hooks so much lately. It happened to me and my friends a few times last night. Needless to say BHVR never surprises me.
---
I know what he‚Äôs done, I just don‚Äôt know why he did it
---
That's not a bug unless you're on pc.
---
No servers=Killer leaves everything breaks because the killer is the game/server nothing exists and is all lost if they pull the plug and don't use the menu button.
---
Without great perks I‚Äôd say b or low a. Also it‚Äôs so hard to land hits in his rage mode
---
Yes like 7 times last night. So irritating.
---
*immersed*
---
Same I don't like the glasses on the forehead but everything else is soooo gooood
---
While I don't agree with anything else he says or this post that's actually correct. It's why they didn't include communication in the first place, the devs have said they wanted the player to feel a sense of isolation.
---
Honestly idk why people think Oni is more difficult on console. He does just fine. The disparity between PC and Console isn't nearly as bad with Oni as it is Nurse.
---
Why should I? I'm not gonna push myself through a game I don't enjoy, games are meant ti be enjoyed after all.
---
Playing killer has instant queues maybe give that a go?
---
I think it's kinda funny too.It gives me good laughs,unless of course it's some game-breaking bug like the one you couldn't escape through the exit gates bc after doing so you would continue on the match
---
He‚Äôs utterly worthless at high ranks. Survivors with half a brain have no issue at all with him. His power cannot be used at loops like it can on PC
---
How did this glitch exactly happen? Did you get stunned when throwing a hatchet or what?
---
Dont bully me :( even when im playing with just one friend i go all out to protect them
---
Yea i flinched when I read the person you responded to. What a douchenozzle
---
I think they were just showing me what we can do as Yui but idk why xD
---
Yeah, one of my friends got that one! He's really good in looping and juking.
---
How does it feel to be completely wrong?
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
Also, look at this. [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e63h0i/red\_rank\_survivors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e63h0i/red_rank_survivors/)
---
You might be onto something.
---
This is why Console Bubba &gt; PC Bubba
---
HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA i havent laughed so hard in a long time
---
Simple answer, yes. Max sensitivity.
---
Probably a connection issue making it look fast or something :s
---
Unfortunately that's considered balanced by the games standards. You can get matched with players up to six ranks different from you. And it seems that this is what all killers face across all platforms. You're always matched up with survivors of higher rank than you. I can't remember the last time I played against more than one Survivor of a lower rank than me.
---
Can you give me a link so I can add that to my game?
---
Honestly, if it lights up for more than a few seconds, just slowly sneak away and they'll be none the wiser.
---
Dude I just passed 550 and learned
---
If you got disconnected enough to exceed a certain % you'd be punished.
---
I mean, he is
---
Thank you, would I be able to be unbanned if I have visual proof that I didn‚Äôt dc
---
I mean according to most people i play against im a tunneling, camping, slugging, waste of human space no matter how i play so go for it i guess. I play the way thats fun for me which is none includes none of those things except for slugging but yea play whatever way is fun for you, fuck the other people you dont owe them anything.
---
This is what it should have been from the beginning but devs are like ''NOPE camping is fine'' -.-
---
I only played killer 1 time since I started playing this game like 3 days ago....I've played mostly Surv.  But when I did play with Doctor...it was like 2min
---
That'll teach you to play the objective!
---
Honestly? I‚Äôm still a newbie, and I don‚Äôt know how to drop survivors...
---
You can but the max feels like molasses
---
We need more killer mains on PS4 sadly.
---
Now if only we could get fixes this quickly for the myriad of other bugs and glitches.
---
[this is a thing and I hate it disclaimer (THIS IS NOT A RICK ROLL)](https://youtu.be/evmNWAkYd0E)
---
Make things worse you can‚Äôt kill yourself on hook, at least I couldn‚Äôt. Once I was picked up, I couldn‚Äôt struggle. When on hook, I couldn‚Äôt attempt to escape and when in the struggle phase it auto-struggled.
---
But sloppy is available as an addon right?
---
Yea but I find its really only for the demon strike that survivors are able to just 360 or turn against even then I found just backing up nullifies as they aren't as close up. For the ability on loops it's really only good  from ive seen make people panic drop pallets and break pallets incredibly fast if you got it charged up. I can agree though definitely should allow console players to have higher sensitivity
---
Because it‚Äôs in the game...
---
Aggressive much? Lol. My bad I wasn't aware you were referring to the flick instead of his general turning sensitivity during his dash. Calm down bud.
---
Yes I‚Äôve played the new legion and yes I can live without those perks. I don‚Äôt want to though because they‚Äôre really good perks on them. Also filthy blade was the only halfway decent purple add on, adding another 3.5 seconds to the mend timer increased your slowdown.  The small speed changes =/= slowdown buff. Your map pressure was only slightly buffed, while your slowdown was nerfed by a 1/5.  And yes, they do run around at high ranks because 1: I‚Äôve been there and can confirm. And 2: because they‚Äôre not scared of getting chased. Why would you assume I haven‚Äôt played new legion. I‚Äôm a legion *main*.
---
Things you can pull survivors off: Pallets (vaulting and reseting), vaults, unhooking, generators, other survivors, lockers, chests, and the exit gate.
---
Basically anything they interact with, except the hatch. We don't talk about hatch...
---
Heaven Ascension nowadays with the bug lol
---
And then you died shortly thereafter
---
The killer leaving should not stop the game itself from recording what happened, like I said, it should've been fixed considering how long it's been going on. And unfortunately that's not the only bug. I cant name others off the top of my head but this game is so bug ridden that I cant help but get upset everytime something happens. This game has such incredible potential to be a great well working masterpiece, but the devs dont even play their game regularly much less be bothered to fix it
---
Nah, she would get slivers from the pallets then
---
slivers &lt; knife in back
---
I‚Äôm still grateful for them
---
This was N00b3's most recent video. He hooked like 3 people in the basement, but didn't know. I was cringing so hard since he genuinely didn't know about it, I saw the endgame chat where survs were complaining about it
---
To be fair, the developers did initially give an estimate of a week or two for the hotfix, but I think that was before they fully realized the extent and severity of the bug(s).
---
Imagine getting downed by that trash killer XD
---
Yes, you can grab survivors that are performing an unhook. 
---
It's a short press, not a long press - if you hold it then you'll do a lunge instead, and a lunge takes priority over a grab.
---
Note that *sometimes* the game will disagree with your version of events - you'll go into the grab animation, but it'll turn into a regular attack instead. This is simply latency at work.
---
I never said worse, I said theyve limited builds. They brought down some add-ons like the knives and bumped others up. Again, theyre just limiting the already small pool of builds legion had access to.
---
Limit builds, hurt Legion in this spot, buff them somewhere else nobody was asking for. Oh and Legion probably isnt doing worse because the killer is already bottom tier. Its just now you cant use Sloppy, Franklins, STBFL, etc.
---
I find people cry about how toxic we are when in reality we are a lot nicer then we think it‚Äôs just a small few who are mean and are loud
---
No.  Hex spawns are RNG entirely with the only exception being that they can't be LOS and within a set distance of where survivors spawn in.  The point is that small game tells you where it could be or where any of the totems are which can be quite helpful as you learn where the tricky totems are and this effectively teaches you where each totem spawn is, lowering the chance you miss a Hex.
---
Funny joke
---
&gt;morale boost while in a chase all other survivors action speed are increased by 15% 
---
We don't need Survivors popping gens even faster.
---
If you're using NOED while learning a Killer, you're not actually learning the Killer.
---
So maybe a dumb question but where do they post the answers? The thread is just all questions.
---
Yeah, those few who go and message you on console or spam end chat on PC really paint the majority in an awful light.
---
I've just done both and yep, easiest 50k ever.
---
Awesome cosplay, this community is sure full of talented people, impressive
---
I like talking to people in end game chat we talk shop you know? Most times it‚Äôs pleasant and nice
---
Idk but even if that's the case that's still bullshit that they need an add on.
---
Yessss.  I played a round today and we didn't see it for over 25 minutes.  I swear, it's never taken that long. I was the person to find it as I was dying. Too bad I was the last person alive....
---
Yeah lol, it‚Äôs better too early than too late
---
Ha ha I guess.
---
It isnt gradual. Unless going from 100 to 2 to 1 was the intended result.
---
Eh that's kinda arguable atleast on PS4 that is as everyone will teabag, trash talk you and DC but yea people blow out of proportion how toxic this community as a whole is
---
Oh no!!! You lost minuscule things in a video game!
---
Calm down Karen. We‚Äôll let you yell at a manager if you really want to.
---
Run, it's the entity
---
I salute you and hope to get those same people one day.
---
Most of my games on the PC been pretty chill. My problem is more you have to wait like 30 minutes to get in as the killer.
---
Oni is worst killer in the game by far. Lol I actually wrote a reddit post about it.
---
I'm this clip though I ended up looping at harvester until he gave up. I actually have the rest lol I just cut it because people prefer short funny vids
---
Big Thicc boi
---
What rank?
---
you can‚Äôt pull survivors off each other healing if that‚Äôs what you mean
---
I would give you gold if i could
---
Monstrous Shrine, Pop, BBQ, Ruin
---
Since when? Smh, I should look deeper into the patch notes next time
---
Imagine if they handled this the same way as the legion mending add-on bug lol
---
&gt; Since the bug could be triggered accidentally, we‚Äôre only going to punish repeated basement hookers.
---
you were never able to pull them off
---
They are not.
---
Fix for that is probably more in-depth. They probably decided to rush out the fix for the game-breaking basement hooks and wiggle issues.
---
I'm not sure if you meant this, but OP was talking about the person rescuing you from the hook should double tap the save not that you should double tap escape attempt (which the glitch prevents anyways).
---
No, original jacket looks way better. There is some cool cosmetics but there are all paid, so yeah... no
---
Taking me 10-15 mins at the moment in red ranks. If the killer doesn't dodge the lobby, someone will DC in the first 20 seconds :(
---
Teabagging in general says otherwise
---
*New chapter with a lot of change in the game, literally hotfix 3.4.1 coming in next 2 days, DC penalty disabled because of bugs*
---
Yeah, they just makin skins, sure
---
Hm, alr.
---
If it's not a glitch, then their tactics are within fair use. (Much to mine and many others displeasure)  
---
But they cant even find a better excuse and vomit out the same shit as the rest, that's what's annoying.
---
Killers should have their own separate ranks per character in my opinion, I‚Äôm a rank one Freddy/Ghostface ext but a rank 20 huntress.
---
Whoa, they aren‚Äôt being Karens. It‚Äôs called constructive criticism. If no one says what‚Äôs wrong with the game, how is anything supposed to get done? When the devs do something right, they‚Äôll get all the praise they deserve. Gutting events and peddling along with chapters when there are things like color-blind settings that should be added and haven‚Äôt are serious issues. Despite being an indy game, Dead by Daylight has a pretty large base, and the devs need to meet the demands. They certainly get the money for it. Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Stranger Things, Evil Dead, even Scream (to a degree), these are all licenses they have and are all audiences that they have access too, so they aren‚Äôt a baby company. To claim ignorant and ignore giant problems is not something they can really do anymore.
---
click click click click
---
20
---
That would be a good perk tbh, damages survivors on missing a skill check. Might be too op without a cooldown with certain builds though.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/scottjund/clip/DirtyDeadLarkPanicVis Here's an example of a 90 degree turn with Oni on PC. With the add-ons to boost his dash's charge time you can make pretty much every loop really unsafe.
---
crazy, it's never worked for me.  It always attack them with my weapon
---
It was bugged for like two days. Breathe. You haven‚Äôt lost anything of substance.
---
Or download from Tap tap (no viruses)
---
Hahaha an OP perk, any time survivors work on the objective, they DIE. No cool down.
---
I prefer not using ruin
---
My build: BBQ, Thrilling Tremors, Pop, Nurses/Haunted Grounds/Devour Hope/Agitation/Mad Grit/Surge/Surveillance
---
Devour hope lets you oneshot when they unhook 3 times and then if they don't go ans find your devour hope you can mori them all. If you use haunted grounds they usually clense it thinking it's ruin or the "It glows it goes".
---
Yeah fuck that glitch. That one and the one where you couldnt be healed. I had that glitch, played the whole match injured, escaped just to die to EGC because it put me outside the map.
---
You can only pull survivors while vaulting if they‚Äôre injured.
---
Wow it is not a very good way to spend your life and I find it to be unsatisfying and disappointing.
---
(Hopefully this is brought to make the mods happy)
---
Happy Claudette Noises
---
What is swf?
---
Wait, Oni is bad on Console? Is it because it's insanely difficult to hit with your power? And I thought it was supposed to be that difficult lol
---
I've had Laurie for a while but haven't gotten around to leveling her. The other week I decided to finally invest in her to get DS and got her up to Level 31 before taking a break. Now DS is in the shrine.
---
seriously, its absurd that playing my fave killer for a few hours blocks me out of enjoying the other killers for the rest of the month.
---
What I do when I wanna stay at a certain rank is just hook everyone once then just slug till they eventually finish all the generators and leave if they are extremely potatoes and I max everything out I chill in the basement go on my phone till they do all the gens and leave. With this you should not gain any pips unless they suicide or go to stage 2. Currently happy at rank 10 where the players are decent but not gods.
---
There are 2 basement challenges in Archives level 3
---
I see. Well we shall see in the coming weeks. I haven't noticed that yet on console because I haven't seen any survivors rush him yet during his power up. Most stay away as far as possible.
---
Yeah the game really does discourage you from trying new killers at high ranks. Why would I, at rank 4, use my level 3 Plague when I have a level 50 Myers, Freddy, and Hag?
---
I would get stomped, and the survivors would have no idea it was my first game.
---
IMO if they were truly passionate about their project, they‚Äôd do what‚Äôs best for the long term health of the game first. Yes this would cause a short term content drought since their resources would be spent fixing the base game, but it would extend the game‚Äôs lifetime
---
What about the issue with crouching killers getting stuck in gens?
---
Im from germany, playin on xbox and my waiting times totally depend on what time it is.
---
during daytime i get survivor games in 20seconds, during nightime i get killer games in 20 seconds.
---
otherwise it can take up to 1-4minutes. i dont mind because i like play both sides
---
Honestly the changes aren't bad. Besides those terror radius builds you can't do anymore to deplete the Deep Wound timer, it at least prevents survivors from staying in your terror radius doing gens with Deep Wounds. Unless doing actions doesn't deplete it either.
---
That‚Äôs optimal survivor play. Far too often, randos will just do whatever they want and focus on farming/purposely being assholes to the killer. This was an extremely rare occurrence and while probably frustrating for killer, it IS the survivors trying to protect all of their own.
---
Wish every game had an options to see the tessellation
---
You can't grab healing survivors and can only grab injured survivors while vaulting
---
Pretty sure Furtive Chase is not supposed to work with Nemesis. Nemesis ONLY works when stunnes or blinded, meaning the only perks that can activate it is DS and Head On.
---
Yeah I wait for upwards of 15 minutes most times. If I play killer I get put into a lobby instantly though.
---
Rip I was in the middle of leveling her too, got to level 28 when the shrine updated
---
Could have used it on yui
---
Nemesis + PWYF is a really strong combo to help build stacks D:
---
Oh that's not that bad............if you'll excuse me I have to change my pants, because of reasons.
---
That is, honestly, a very bad design. Same can be said about the beartraps... Sadly the game is too survivor favored.
---
The only reason why I play Legion is because of Susie lol
---
I mean how  can you change something that's a fact. Oni could probably break Micheal in two with a single kick or just absolutely obliterate anyone smaller, dude comes from a Chad bloodline too I mean a samurai father that basically destroyed everyone? Also need I mention Kazan killed a few waves of farmers by himself and manage to humiliate pretending samurai and take their topknots(also he doesn't take shit from anyone that insults his family).
---
I approve make the pig great on DBD she was my main
---
Your reports are meaningless and are going to nothing so have at lol. Their is no way to determine who knew and didn't so devs arent gonna ban or even warn them but have at it grinch
---
It says 10/10.....
---
This sub is full of spoiled brats, that's just how it goes I guess. Look how mad people get when they get DS'd or die to NOED once.
---
I'd kill for a fuckin Pink Guy skin
---
Lord entity.
---
I hope I sacrificed enough today.
---
Wtf is happening
---
"no complaining"
---
quit dick sucking op
---
Hatch standoffs don‚Äôt exist anymore
---
Killers still getting stuck to fuckin generators..... I know this phrase is a meme, but it's happening every game. Glad you fixed this for survivors, but still literally unplayable
---
They should have just left the nemesis be. At least deep would would, you know, feel like deep wounds instead of ‚Äúthat period‚Äù
---
Hag makes me jump out of my skin every time I hit a trap.
---
Indeed
---
I answered on other comment. Killer was just camping everyone from the start. There was no even map offering.
---
&gt;it was billy with ruin and noed, he camped everyone and facecamped only me for some reason, I even didn't have a chance to use my perks.
---
Well, he got his Ruin cleansed from the start actually, may be that triggered him.
---
With a tank and a magical dagger that can kill any evil entity it touches.
---
I don't know, concussive strike would give it a run for it's money.
---
Should've applied more pressure
---
Have you had the challenge accepted since the archive changes? You might need to pause and resume the challenge to claim it
---
JEEZ DUDE. Holy hell I have feeling they're definitely gonna nerf his tunability just because of that(also I think theyve mentioned they would nerf the turn rate again but I don't remember) anyways compared to console Oni PC Oni is fucking chad
---
Yes that too, but there are plenty of other cases.
---
On my end I was basically distributing my BPs between both Laurie and Myers since I wanted Play With Your Food to synchronize with Oni's Nemesis perk. Because of that neither are maxed out yet and I could have gotten Myers' maxed out by now and then put the rest of the BP on something like Doctor or Jake who were both next in line for me.
---
No to this because you ruined my favorite perk ace in the hole.
---
You must have a micro penis if you‚Äôre this angry over lighting in a map.
---
Turn up your gamma/brightness if it‚Äôs really that big of an issue you simpleton.
---
üò≥üíï
---
yes I completely understand what you mean, I realized tale too late \^\^,
---
And I just came to finish the meme for "your soul is mine" \^\^, I post them on the reddit of MK
---
Sir you aren't being WHOLESOME 100
---
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
---
As far as I can tell until the hatch has actually spawned in (has textures) it can't be messed with, but it is always on the map, just as a non interactable. She couldn't have used hacks, but if they existed one could probably let you see hatch, couldn't open, just see.
---
Oni by far. I love just running around as a giant weeb and Bonk people with my kanabo club also it's great when defending a hook.
---
I see this a lot and it doesn‚Äôt make sense . A person that has a rank 1 killer would absolutely dump on rank 20 survivors even if they were on a fresh , minimum perk killer at rank 20
---
Will do love.
---
Oh shit, that's what this for. prob a new killer concept where he queues like a survivor. This is basically the only way it could work.
---
If only I did this challenge before the prayer beads change
---
The killer community on PS4 has been steadily depleting. It‚Äôs definitely getting worse and worse but as devs cater to the PC crowd killer gets more unfun to play on console.
---
It‚Äôs really bad right now
---
Grats! Its definitely not an easy journey doing that all solo. You get so many god awful games. I did the grind once and won't do it again.
---
Hope it makes you feel better sweet pea

I didn't realise agreeing with someone because from your perspective they're right was dick sucking, but ok

[based off this](https://vine.co/v/ixFbqMJJUYB/)
---
Good news, everyone! The bug has been fixed!
---
A 4k hour main of anything will consistently win at red ranks - it isn't about how something is viable when mastered, it is about the killers average results throught the ranks
---
God damn
---
Then you are the skull on the bottom right.
---
That honestly sounds dope, I really hope this isn‚Äôt just a visual bug.
---
Can't see anything in this map.
---
In Soviet Russia ruin hex finds you!
---
He's obviously in AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA tier
---
Survivor: Dwight
---
- Quick and Quiet
---
- Inner Strength
---
- Head-On
---
- Kindred
---
Lockers are safe, Lockers are life. Kindred‚Äôs buff has made it my go-to Information perk. Being able to tell if someone else is going to the hook or if I need to is wonderful.
---
Killer: Plague
---
- BBQ/Chili ‚ÄîOR‚Äî Surge
---
- Dying Light
---
- Hex: Ruin
---
- Surveillance
---
A take on the Forever Freddy Build. Ruin slows the game down (just a little bit) in the early game while Dying Light slows things down later. Regressing a Generator and then puking on it means 40 seconds of survivors having to choose between getting sick or stopping the regression. If they wait out the puke, the time regressed is worth more than the time worked on the generator due to Dying Light‚Äôs penalty. If they work on the gen, they get sick *and* I know about it with Surveillance. BBQ for the BP farm to level up Oni, but Surge is typical for auto-regressing gens when I down a survivor.
---
I would not pay more money for this game in any way, so no
---
basement only, or any hooks?
---
Had a peekaboo Meyers a couple matches ago. Peek behind me, nothing, slow vault and I'm getting grabbed from behind. 
---
My mom asked me if I was okay shortly after.
---
(Context for the last bit, we bought a "mother in law" and I live in the smaller half)
---
No, it can't spawn in los of survivors. It spawns so that 3m away from survivors its in los. Or you get the 1/1000000 spawn thats actually hidden, but it'll be cleansed in 20 seconds. /s
---
Spine Chill, Kindred, Lithe, Adrenaline is my survivor build
---
This might be an unpopular opinion but I kind of like the changes. Sure, deep wound is even more of a joke now but it was already really weak so it doesn't feel like a huge change. The added movement and vaulting speed however feel really nice and there are still a lot of good perks to equip even without the basic attack ones.
---
There should be quotations around what the devs fix. Because every other patch something they supposedly fixed get broke again
---
I always think its a survivor at first glance when im up against that legion skin, which even further proves the post's point. D:
---
Wait what was she doing at that pallet?? Pulling it back up? lol
---
They wouldn‚Äôt be there for long I‚Äôm sure they would double pip every game.
---
You also get 50k bp for completing both killer and survivor.
---
think about it, they can't have killer not be in the group at the start. Otherwise its obvious who it is.
---
They already did so I doubt it. On the PTB he could pull a 180. It's the flip side of his power requiring you to build charge, it's really strong once you get into it.
---

---
I think the only new thing they've mentioned about the flick is making it so keyboard turning isn't any better than mouse turning
---
Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
---
Our team is divided into 4 roles:
---
I try to be the stealthiest, I rarely run around looping the killer because usually by the end of the chase I get hooked. I like playing the stealthy side and not get noticed at all. I use iron will, spine chill, urban evasion and self care
---
A friend is the bait, he can run around with the killer for long times and has a 50/50 ratio of escaping but also, sometimes he gets hooked. You can burn yourself when playing with fire, obviously. He is using self care, object of obsession, lithe and adrenaline.
---
Another friend, he is a mix of two, and is support. Has prove thyself, small game, urban evasion and self care (i think).
---
The last guy is the gen guy. He is neither stealthy, nor aggressive but he always brings toolboxes to work those gens fast. I don't remember his perks
---
Anything you would change or add? Thanks for the help!
---
The demodogs didn‚Äôt come out until the sun went down for a reason, just like the demogorgon &amp; mindflayer. Fireworks were used against the mindflayer, which has the same weakness against heat as the demogorgon, so just like the fireworks and flashlights blind characters in DBD, I think realistically they should just burn the demogorgon. It just makes more sense as it doesn‚Äôt have eyes. It can‚Äôt be blinded. I‚Äôve watched stranger things the whole way through about 30 times since the day the 1st season came out, and it‚Äôs heavily implied that even if it doesn‚Äôt mind the light itself it still avoids it for a reason (heat.) Also, when the mindflayer takes over Billy, he‚Äôs VERY affected by the sunlight, and wears glasses, long tshirt, etc.
---
By that logic, are you sure that's not yours? It's like you didn't read any of my comments.
---
I think gripping tendrils could be just a bit too strong, other than that I love it nice work!
---
Still doesn‚Äôt really solve the problem since the other four people in the game would suffer . Not a good balance imo
---
As always - the community absolutely *loves* it when you guys communicate and bring these issues back down with prompt and care. Thank you for being prompt on fixing this on behalf of the community.
---
He's not inclined to let you hit him.
---
Wholesome
---
Oni is at least A tier, maybe even S tier? Idk.
---
On console he‚Äôs fairly meh
---
Cause it's PC wdym?
---
I'm not the hugest fan of Nea but the cosplay is accurate and well done. Keep it up.
---
No but that doesn't make tbagging and flashlight spamming acceptable does it?
---
Omg tell me about it! I love their designs way too much to not main them and I‚Äôd be fine with playing as a survivor version
---
I keep my messages to friends only and won't ever change it back. It's been a great dbd experience ever since. I can only read so many salty messages before it starts to get annoying. I sometimes get a salty friend request message tho lol.
---
I'm not. The comment sections speak for themselves.
---
Also, if they were only bothered by the heat from the sunlight Billy wouldn‚Äôt even bother with wearing sunglasses.
---
I agree completely with that but you can't expect someone to let you hit them or their team
---
BHVR is a company with 500 employees.
---
&gt;And its painfully obvious you dont know anything about game development or programming.
---
What did you take issue with? Go into specific detail as I did. Don't just hand wave it, get into the nitty gritty I wanna see you, man who browsers /r/blackchickswhitedicks, flex your programming knowledge.
---
WELL - their argument for it is based on toxicity and it is a damn good one. I've seen and experienced it first hand the countless number of times that someone went out of their way to upset people. I don't think you want that experience.
---
It'll be fixed whenever we get servers. The fix for many issues is out there just not on every platform
---
&gt;3-4 year old game
---
&gt;on latest gen hardware
---
&gt;a shitton of money made from dlc and skins
---
BHVR: ahhhhhhh, give em a skinny ass, stretched ass moon
---
Or because the clip is over because that was the gameplay?
---
I didn't expect him to let me at him at all where are you getting the idea I did?
---
I don‚Äôt understand, what do you mean?
---
Would love to say the same, each time I follow a survivor in the grass I instant lose them, I guess I need to got gud but oh god, I may also need a pair of glasses
---
omg? I had no idea that was a thing I just made this for the memes LOL
---
**Anytime** a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they are affected by the Oblivious Status Effect for 40/50/60 seconds and their Aura is revealed to you for 4 seconds.
---
Sounds like it 100% should work when Furtive Chase changes the obsession
---
So that explains why my 16 charges didn't do shit to help my Brown Kit the other night... oh man. Thanks for letting us know. I am avoiding addons for now.
---
Toxic players deserve to be retaliated to definitely.
---
Huh well still I have a feeling a bunch of people will complain about it and get Oni on PC just absolutely nerfed to Console levels of Oni. Kinda seeing a pattern in the yamoaka bloodline, be very strong, get tweaked at launch, still very strong and then get your add-ons or ability nerfed by BHVR causing you to cry in a corner and wonder what'd you do to deserve this.
---
Happened once in the basement and once on a hook outside, but on the latter it didn't happen until we had all gens started if that counts for anything.
---
I think giving her buffs in compensation for her being unable to see the box‚Äôs auras is a great idea. The appeal of her power is primarily to slow the game by adding an additional objective, but is sometimes used to go after already injured survivors since they don‚Äôt really have time to get healed and reliably get the helmet off before it kills them. So taking this ability away would allow these other buffs to make her good but not be as frustrating and oppressive to play against
---
I believe this is a demonstration of what people refer to as YEET
---
Germany wasn't full of Nazis before WW2. But then the community changed and it became full of Nazis.
---
You're basically saying not to do anything if Nazis start to take power. What a joke.

---
Survivors: ‚ÄúKillers are overpowered! Nerf killers! Nerf this! Nerf that! Killers trying to win is unfun! It‚Äôs toxic! Killers need to care about our fun!‚Äù
---
Also Survivors: ‚ÄúWhy does no one want to play Killer for us?‚Äù
---
Aka before the shitstorm that came from the response of that time estimate
---
They need to change that animation. Instead of it being right in his face. I'd appreciate it moved to the side so I can see center screen.
---
The only thing these changes benefit legion with is running Blood Echoes with the Legion Pin addon to make injured survivors exhausted in order to make future chases easier to get downs. 
---
It hinges on survivors not healing (which is common) as well as ending your chases quickly to make sure the others can‚Äôt use their exhaustion perk. You still have to down them like normal sure, but maybe that can be enough to not have to play around Dead Hard and BL so much.
---
And only one of them used the correct you're
---
Yeah, I agree with you that the vault/frenzy speed is a nice boost, but deep wound was good for map pressure at least and now it just has no redeeming qualities :/
---
Can I say that we need a Dwight skin now of Pink Guy?  Come on BHVR.
---
I hate it so much honestly
---
Achieve rank 1 so you can stop caring about rank, Rank reset happens, 2K with low tier killer, EZ TRASH KILLER ENJOY BEING GREEN RANKS FOREVER
---
No, healthy survivors can be grabbed while the vault.
---
I think after people get used to the sensitivity and learn how to adjust to the curving, Oni may be a better Hillbilly and that speaks volumes.
---
What's your opinions on moris?
---
I would have let you go cause of the sandbagging
---
If they blind it mid-swing, you‚Äôll finish the swing with a normal attack. Was in the game ever since Legion came out
---
I just tried to play in a house that had a skylight and it was pretty much impossible. I kept running into walls. I kept trying to run through a ‚Äúdoor‚Äù and I was panicking because he killer was coming and it was a window. I couldn‚Äôt even tell.
---
I don‚Äôt even tunnel. But survivors at the red ranks work on gens in front of me or jump into a locker to force the DS. They do stupid shit in front of me because they know they can‚Äôt be hooked for a minute. It just pisses me off and it bothers me that if one person has it, I have to respect it just in case everyone has it
---
I reread your comment, sorry for misunderstanding.
---
Spirit was actually weak on launch. The vacuum noise was directional instead of omnidirectional, you could hear it even while in her terror radius, and her power's base recharge time was 20 seconds instead of 15. edit: I also remember it being kinda impossible to hear anything while phase walking, but fuck all if I remember that being an element of her power or just one of the many audio bugs
---
She's still #2 best killer after her nerfs.
---
Oh my god who cares mate, it‚Äôs a meme.
---
This was so intense I thought it was over only 15 seconds in.
---
inb4 someone says tries to be edgy and simply says "nah"
---
The Devs put a cooldown on survivors dropping blood orbs when they crouch. That should tell you everything you need to know, about the game and it's developers.
---
[...That is exactly what he does with Wraith majority of time?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMHRTpiLPFI)

I mean she was on death hook and had been camped on the floor for a while at that point, but yeah I was kinda pissed haha

IVE GOT A BELT AND IM NOT AFRAID TO HANG MYSELF
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

---
I still need to complete the hook 5 survivors in the basement archive... FUCK
---
Oh yea I know was just pointing out the pattern  I saw with them good or bad, just saying seems a pattern is either gonna form and he gets flicking  nerfed again or nothing happens.
---
Yes I said let‚Äôs not do anything if Nazis start to take power üòÇ please either go take your medication or go back under your bridge. Disabling reply notifications, have a nice day troll üòò
---
The delay for the archives. They apologized on Twitter and in the live-streams for not having things ready on time. That was very recent and they did at least own up to fucking that patch up.
---
and, spirit leaves 95% of pallets, just phase and boom you cant do a thing.
---
For survivor I‚Äôm playing jorts Dwight and I have adrenaline/lithe/BT/unbreakabill
---
I‚Äôve been playing Oni for killer and I have BBQ/Ruin/Sloppy/whispers
---
XD
---
Thats so true though, people need to be grateful for the amount of work that is being put inarouns the clock on DbD
---
honestly I‚Äôd never clenched my buttcheeks so hard in my life
---
Max sensitivity on xbone isn‚Äôt that sensitive to begin with. Yes.
---
It is. If they use it, it is their build. And if you use it, it's your build too. This shit has all got to be a troll at this point right? Nobody is actually stupid enough to think every person ever is being 100% literal right? The machine I use every single day at work i call "my welder" others reference it as "(my name)'s welder" but it's not mine. It's owned by the shop I work for. I'm getting tilted by other people getting tilted at possibly the stupidest thing that, for whatever reason, became a thing... It is very very very clearly a figure of speech every person on the planet uses.
---
4 man SWF only has a 48% survival rate. It actually makes the game MORE fair for survivors. 
---
Check the stats BHVR gave out in May.
---
There the exact same both the same amounts of bullshit but I wanted to address keys first but I plan to make another post about Moris later especially green and red Moris
---
If there were an award for being a cocksucker, you, sir, would have earned it three times over. Go fuck yourself.
---
I do agree that the testing process to eliminate those bugs should happen more, even if it takes longer for DLCs to come out, thats what the PTB is for, to find those bugs, as well as show off the new killer/survivor
---
Unless you have a Mori or specific perk, you ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô.
---
I'm looking at their twitter now and I don't see an apology. It just says "thank you for your cooperation". Do you know where I can find it?
---
because you literally said they're a small company knowing they have 500 employees
---
This game is just fucking wrecked right now lmao
---
The basement hook and the medkit addon bugs should not have made it onto the live build. That was a major fuck up. So yes I will criticise them.
---
UPDATE 3.5.0:  
---
&gt;Legion can now mori self
---
just like nature if it's flashy it's toxic &amp;
---
if it looks like it can kill u it probably can
---
What makes that perk good on legion?
---
we have no fucking clue, all we know is that the older killers are being looked at in 2020.
---
This is flawless, well done.
---
&gt; nothing personnel kid
---
ftfy
---
I‚Äôve seen several people today mention you can get stuck inside a gen kicking it. The only way out is to hit or grab a survivor off the gen.
---
You're incorrect, and I have the receipts. It was actually confirmed in Dev Q&amp;A session 5 on October 26th 2018 that Survive with Friends was always intended and not due to some made up "outcry", nor have they ever said adding the feature would "break the game." Stop making up shit.

Facts, id 4k so much with console bubba
---
Right... newer players... (cries in 1k hrs and still missing skill checks like a noob sometimes)
---
&gt; Sadly the game is too survivor favored.
---
That must be why killers are overperforming at all ranks.
---
Hmm it might be a bug you can bring up in the q and a
---
Yeah now I would have seen that and just let you off with a warning
---
That right there is what I call great teamates. I wish the commuity was more like this
---
Sure they nerfed STBFL for legion and reduced the mending time by an insignificant amount, but everything else was a buff in this patch. Faster frenzy speed, waaaay faster vaulting, buffed a few addons and reworked the buttons to actually be useful.
---
100% agreed
---
im not even a high killer rank (14) but using oni was a nightmare.  
---
i got 2 hooks in 3 games.   
---
granted 2 of those games were on the damn japanese map where you cant see shit, but still.   
---
i just wanna use the new guy.  I have come to accept that using a new killer means i'll depip at least 4 times before i do anything.  
---
and i always use my "better" killers at the same time to gain the bp to level the new guy.  
---
teachables?  yea i took pig from level 15 to level 40 after unlocking bbq.   Still dont have it on her.  
---
but my freakin clown has all the best teachables.   BBQ and ruin literally popped up before i hit lvl 5 with him.
---
i think he means the blendette teabagging at the end

It was 6 before so there's that

Well I think its cool enought :D

Except for the fact that the pig was still somewhat okay compared to the legion.. Though can't disagree either that both are getting nerfed to the ground while already not being the best and weak from the nerfs
---
I totally agree. I play both sides and hitboxes are 50/50 at times. Grabs as killer don't happen at all.. I've even been stuck in the grab animation for a while and although it's funny, it's happening too much!
---
Le funny. 
---
Does bug me tho bc you can't tell the design team to go do balancing changes. They need to hire more people to do balance.
---
Plague
---
Corrupt Intervention 
---
Thanataphobia 
---
Dying Light 
---
Pop Goes the Weasel 
---
I originally used Ruin in this build but it was too hit and miss for me. Corrupt has been pretty consistent for me. As the majority of the time I'll find a survivor before the 2 minutes are up.
---
Thanataphobia and Dying Light work well together for slowing the game down. As Plague's whole deal is to put survivors into a broken state, these two perks work well together for me. And seeing as survivors are broken and can't heal, it takes away Dying Light's bonus to healing that the Obsession gets.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is probably my favourite perk right now. 60 seconds of being able to knock a gen back 30% is just such a great feeling. I just love watching a gen get knocked back when it was close to completion.
---
Should‚Äôve put more map pressure smh
---
It's a new player starting out as Dwight or anything survivors
---
I don't usually see people running it (myself included) unless they've had bad matches, and need to calm down. Partly because you rarely even safety pip with it.
---
+1
---
*people who farm*
---
Optimal survivors are nearly unbeatable, especially if in discord, etc. But it's not hard to rank up and damn near impossible to depip, so if you play enough you will hit rank 1. Because of this there's a ton of potato ass players at rank 1.
---
[If only there was an offical forums where devs check](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/)
---
What‚Äôs the glitch I haven‚Äôt seen it yet since I rarely use the basement
---
It‚Äôs interesting that I keep hearing people say ‚Äúbut the basement challenge exists!‚Äù And though survivors don‚Äôt have challenges they‚Äôre trying to complete as well. A challenge existing doesn‚Äôt excuse you for being a jerk when you knew there was a game breaking bug.
---
Survivor I‚Äôm Feng, using lithe and technician, I can‚Äôt remember my other two and I‚Äôm open to suggestions. 
---
Killer I‚Äôm Nurse and I use Stridor, whispers, iron grasp and thanatophobia sometimes I swap the last one out.
---
Someone doesn't have the IQ to understand analogies.
---
Its hard being a chad
---
They can't
---
Yeah that didn't work for me most of the time either.
---
I ended up playing a farming game as bubba, took the first survivor i found to a gen and let him work on that, pick him up and let him wiggle out three times.
---
Would have liked to do it properly, but i don't see that happening with how glitchy grabs, or anything really, are with servers.
---
Keys and Moris needs reworked fs, I shouldn‚Äôt be able to instantly kill someone after hooking them one time.
---
I also shouldn‚Äôt be able to do a minimal amount of gens and escape at the snap of my fingers.
---
What am I missing? How did he get nerfed? Reading the patch notes they buffed him.
---
True
---
Yeah lol
---
I‚Äôve always said that there should be a higher sense

---
That Nancy deserved an epic sandbag after that
---
I don¬¥t know. While all you¬¥ve said is plausible, I think the real reason of Adam being tunneled may be due to his *teachable* perk "Deliverance"
---
Just... a feeling I'm got, like somethings about to happen
---
Never saw a surv whine about GF tbagging.
---
Every time.
---
and they say this game doesn't have enough horror in it
---
Wait that's literally the exact opposite of his philosophy with Ghostface. The entire build is centered around getting one free hit and leaving them to heal specifically so that you can avoid having to chase. He might go more chase-heavy when he's doing viewer builds but his preferred build (Corrupt, Thana, Nurse's, Sloppy) is literally designed to not chase until you are in the "let's wrap this up" phase of the game.
---
Tru3 hate is weird. Everyone you named there (except Scorpioniz, only because I honestly don't know who that is) will tunnel and camp if they have to win. One of my favorite Otz videos is him tunneling the living shit out of a player with Object of Obsession. They all definitely run ruin regularly as well, with the exception of Otz.
---
Except for that time he fought Freddy in Freddy vs Jason vs Ash.
---
&lt;33
---
Self care is a waste of time, your better off bringing a med kit. It takes an ass load of time to heal with self care
---
"Legion is dead" "BHVR is shit" and "Stop nerfing Pig shitheads" is not constructive criticism. There have been people complaining and I agree with people saying "hey, this is clearly broken, is there any chance you can fix this soon". But I do not approve of insults to the people working on DbD or the company itself. If you think that constitutes as criticism then you are a pos and a lost cause and I doubt BHVR will ever listen to you or any developer ever.
---
They are still people, they are working with passion on DbD, if you can't keep it civil then that is not criticism and is not worthy of any discussion or attention from anybody. End of story.

---
are u sure its not those people who are trying to do the blind killer while carrying survivor challenge? Because I remember completing the challenge by just starting to blind the killer at the start of the carrying animation instead of doing it at the right moment so he can get blind and drop the survivor.

But... they wanna make money. As long as you‚Äôre doing pay to win and forcing players to pay a shit load of money to gain one item like Apex did last season then I‚Äôd agree but otherwise nah. Make full use of the rift I say.
---
Not everyone visits Reddit or the official forums. It would not be unheard of for someone to be doing their basement challenges or just playing normally and have no idea there was a bug going on, especially if they only play Killer.
---
Just yesterday I was in a game, got caught in a horrible spot by a Billy within the first minute, and just so happened to be next to Shack with the Basement. Game glitched out, I DCed, I waited to yell at him.... only to notice that he never purposefully went to the shack with anyone else.
---
I told him about the glitch and he legitimately had no idea it was a thing.
---
Run the black splinter offering
---
500 people that don't all work on DbD, btw. Maybe a fifth of that do, which constitutes as a small team, considering most AAA games DO have like 500 people working on a single project.
---
I don‚Äôt play survivor much but when I do, I be pimpin
---
Fucking Survivors wanting everything to be easy smh
---
The new way to DC.
---
It‚Äôs what I thought of but then I was like ‚Äúehhh Until Dawn exists‚Äù
---
Teaches them to genrush in my lobbies /s
---
R e f o r m e d
---
Up until you get a wide open map like blood Lodge with 3-4 gens in the middle of the map surrounded by pallets. Ghosty boy can struggle immensely without visibility blockers.
---
Not pay 2 win, pay to look cool, though? Yeah.
---
If the actual power, which is the Stab, is still useless then it was a nerf. Making him run faster doesn‚Äôt do anything if the stabs are about as harmful as a paper cut
---
bruh i just played a game where my ruin didn't spawn reee
---
Trying to imagine a killer getting startled by a blendette jumping out of nowhere and it's incredibly amusing
---
I definitely agree with this, too often I get facecamped and the team either fall into the camper's trap or refuse to do gens as a matter of fact they just stand there. I'm betting you deal with a lot of new killers that camp? I've been trying to do the Rift but no luck so far, I have gotten most of them as Claudette until the part where you have to unhook people. lol
---
The pages to the first book are all blank
---
No, I just refuse to take off my ~~blackface~~ Smartface.  I want those horrible little teabagging Claudette gremlins to know that, no matter what else happens this trial, they will not survive.
---
I feel like disconnecting should have a penalty if it‚Äôs specifically people who disconnect when getting downed. I‚Äôm not too sure though, some people will just die on hook. It always sucks when 2 players dc and the other dude and I die and derank.
---
Dead after dusk?
---
You almost have to try to not escape
---
Perks like sloppy and dark devotion dont work with feral frenzy
---
How do they do it without switching engines? I only assumed they had to use a new engine because of Overwatch 2‚Äôs existence honestly. Look at the way Last Year looks in game visually. That‚Äôs what DBD deserves to look like imo. Almost triple A.
---
Plus she probably can't fuel it up easily.
---
That‚Äôs not even what he‚Äôs saying. If you learn a killer and are only able to get kills through using NOED, you‚Äôre probably not using them right but the kills you gain make it seem like you are
---
I swear sometimes the hex totem wont be Lit but they're will still be light around it
---
Title is "Devs plz address keys"
---
If you actually want a response from a developer (or someone able to pass on information to a developer) it's more likely to happen on the actual forums.
---
I‚Äôd smash
---
My staple perks are Thanatophobia  and BBQ, and then switch around the other two. I used to use Sloppy as well but they‚Äôve changed it so feral frenzy hits don‚Äôt activate it. The new perk Blood Echo may be good on them too but I haven‚Äôt got to try it yet lol
---
I got this achievement because my whole squad got hooked in the basement (everyone had killed them self when I got hooked last) fortunately the rng luck was my side and I managed to get off the hook. Not saying I expected to live because usually high rank killers aren‚Äôt very generous when it comes to that. Anyways, the trapper decides to let me go and instead of letting me go for hatch he wants me to do gens instead. So I popped the remains 3 gens and escaped. Just a lucky night I guess
---
Just a basic build. Stuff like Ruin, Enduring/Spirit Fury, normal m1 killer stuff to help in chases and bbq. His power doesn't really have many synergies anymore so a standard build like you might see on trapper is good.
---
Honestly, I'm mainly an Xbox One player, but I play on PC and PS4 too, and I feel like Oni isn't as bad on console as everyone says. He's nowhere near as good as he is on PC, but I'm still getting good use out of his power at Rank 5. The flicks don't work as well, but his Demon Dash still catches plenty of people.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6perl/have_the_framerate_issues_on_console_been_fixed/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I remember when unlimited vaults was just part of the game
---
Yes I know but I do know devs check here and it‚Äôs mostly just a title
---
I believe I said very clearly... ‚Äúwhen you KNEW there was a game breaking bug.‚Äù
---
I wasn‚Äôt going after those who were unaware.
---
I actually thought about that, but I didn't know how to connect them
---
I main huntress and this is 20/10
---
And no i didnt mess up the number
---
yeah I've been getting this every game, starting to get annoying
---
Hence botany knowledge
---
What about leather face mains?
---
Better off playing killer matches lol, those queue almost instantly but I want to mix in some survivor rounds too....effin 2mins+
---
The fact that you're used to Bethesda is both sad and relatable. 
---
Part of it is luck though. I never experienced the basement bug, but I did get stuck in a generator after kicking it.
---
BLESS YOU KIND SIR
---
That makes no sense. 
---
Moris take away 1 life, Keys take away 1 objective.
---
If your counter to moris is "You can live" then your counter to keys is "You can kill."
---
There is no counterplay to either, except each other.
---
Pls do not insidous camp, otherwise you guys should RISE UP AS WELL
---
What about wraith mains
---
I thought RS2 in basekit was a consensus, but after some discussions I heard lots of people who thought it actually hurts Amanda by pushing survivors into fixing gens since they can't find the boxes. So that's kinda controversial.
---
#New Location: Overlook Hotel
---
##The Curator (Jack Torrance)
---
###Primary Weapon: Fire Axe
---
###Power: Redrum
---
The Curator has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. To activate the power: **Redrum**, **tap the Power button** once the gauge is full. While active, a malevolent force applies the **Blindness**, **Oblivious**, and **Exhausted** status effects to all Survivors, draining the Killer's power gauge over **20 seconds**. Additionally, The Curator's **attack recovery speed** is increased by **30%**. Once the power gauge is fully depleted, it must recharge over **30 seconds**.
---
###Perks
---
**Cabin Fever**
---
Months in isolation have taken a toll on you. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. If your obsession escapes a hook **2** times, or obtains the accumulative repair points equivalent to **2.5/2/1.5** completed generators, you may kill them by your own hand.
---
**Spark of Insanity**
---
Unlocks the potential in one's **Aura-reading ability**.
---
Your mind has been consumed by delusions and paranoia. The auras of Survivors with **40 meters** are revealed to you every **50/40/30 seconds**, but your movement speed is reduced by **5%**.
---
**All Work and No Play**
---
Your presence fills those around you with anxiety. Survivors take **50/75/100%** longer to unhook when inside your terror radius.
---
When you are carrying them and you walk up to a hook and violently shake your head and don't hook them, they should get the message.
---
Sounds like this guy struggled off multiple times. He should have got the message.
---
Absolutely. That is what being survivor favorited is. Survivors play nice with killers to hide the scary truth about their abuse from the devs
---
I love this. This is too good.
---
Most of the animations are pretty good I'll give them that.it just sucks that those animations are tied to such a terrible offering that ruins the game for your opponents
---
Yo we rising up already?
---
That has nothing to do with it lol.
---
&gt;Perks like sloppy and dark devotion dont work with feral frenzy
---
Sloppy doesn't work with any M2 anymore, why Legion should be different?
---
Thank you so much for the silver! That's so kind! &lt;3
---
HELL YEA
---
I use insidious as a meme at the exit gate only. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs tier 1 lmao
---
Ensuring?
---
Maybe. Tbh you forget she has the crouching power mid game. I want to compare to ghost face. I would like to see her have increased speed and not a roar ( at least not while performing the action)
---
You too. U deserve love
---
I‚Äôve played Skyrim so many times through, I‚Äôve lost count.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize there was a basement bug, and now I‚Äôm wondering if that t-bagging Feng last night got stuck in it and was doing that because I did that to her.
---
That great
---
Side note my Claudette is only lv 25 and i play healer a lot and im ok at gens and being able to heal while having a toolbox is handy
---
All Legion mains should go on strike until he‚Äôs S tier
---
I'd say enduring.
---
YEA
---
I mean tinkerer is pretty powerful. But it‚Äôs up to you
---
I just really want theatrics for her to really feel like there's a trap on you
---
I mean ebony is a lil much but the other ones are fine imo. You used to be able to MORI without even hooking
---
I mean yeah that's usually what happens when someone is wrong it's not that big a deal.
---
Yeah, to mee too she looked way better in the trailer, its not even because of the graphics, but the hair and the nose are different
---
Once you get to high level play, there is no time to have a 32 second heal when you could spend that time working on a gen, it‚Äôs great to learn how to play when injured too
---
Edit: also I‚Äôm 99% tiers of selfcare only change the consumption rate part and not the self heal part
---
So basically it‚Äôs plague
---
I feel that. We need more Pig love BHVR ;(
---
There should be a shelf full of books marked "new things that broke when the devs fixed other things".
---
The nerf was Unneeded, but trust me the reddit gets spammed every .2 secs after a small nerf to any killer gets announced, especially top tiers.
---
I'd say spirit fury
---
The "meta" billy build is BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Sprit Fury.
---
Chainsawing pallets count for Spirit Fury tokens, so you can basically have it up 24/7.
---
No one is going to think that comment is serious, much less "an unholy amount of idiots". MAYBE if they skim it, but even then, that's a stretch.
---
How am I flaming him for using self care I‚Äôm just saying self care takes to long to use even with tier 3.. if he wants to use it I could honestly not give a fuck.
---
I though tits tood for
---
Self care is a user problem not a problem in general. When I bring it I usually use it for end game collapse to save survivors. It‚Äôs a great perk if you use it right. The problem is most people use it to self care after every hit. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt know how to do gens. If you know how to use it, great! If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs like having a rank 20 on your team.
---
ah gotcha, now i get it
---
It's still shit but much much better than what it once was. Granted I don't play too much on my PS4 anymore, mostly Olay on PC. Beeb about a month since I played dbd on console.
---
Shrug, you're right. But just kinda annoys me that a lot of people's first response is to downvote someone for being wrong.
---
I mean, he wanted your attention, and he got it. He shouldn‚Äôt be mad
---
I thought it stood for
---
It depends on what's your favorite build. It sort of helped with one specific perk while it made lots of other very interesting perks useless. I prefer Sloppy Butcher+Nurse's to STBfL, so I (and many others) didn't like the change.
---
The mangled addon is pretty shit only for 60 seconds and it doesn't apply to the first person you hit
---
Pretty sure it's the atmosphere/sky of whatever map you're on. My sky was blue-gray cause we were on shelter woods. The farm maps are reddish brown.
---
Just gaming, chair bro
---
Jenny&gt;nurse joy
---
That just sounds like camping with extra steps.
---
The Curator has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. To activate the power: **Redrum**, **tap the Power button** once the gauge is full. While active, a malevolent force applies the **Blindness** and **Oblivious** status effects to all Survivors, draining the Killer's power gauge over **20 seconds**. Additionally, all Survivors hit while Redrum is active are afflicted with the **Hindered** status effect. Once the power gauge is fully depleted, it must recharge over **30 seconds**.
---
Months in isolation have taken a toll on you. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. If your obsession escapes a hook **2** times, or obtains the accumulative repair points equivalent to **2.5/2/1.5** completed generators, you may kill them by your own hand. Cabin Fever can only be used once per trial.
---
Its part of her character. Next you're going to say that stalking people as Myers is scummy too.
---
This game is a product, not a cookie being sold by fucking 1st graders, and as it is, the product barely functions right. BHVR is a studio, a company. Stop defending them. When you do, it makes it sound to them that doing this shit is okay, and it fucking isn't.
---
Same shit happened with Bethesda, and eventually Fallout 76 happened.
---
If it kinda glows I guess it goes?
---
i hope they make more flashy skins that turn kinda dark mode colors for killers so they look good while still not being a disadvantage
---
Bad title. Spoiled the surprise
---
Kinda... But no it can climb on walls and stabbing them with your tail is a melee attack the climbing on wall has no cool down
---
sounds like a waste of 2 perk slots. bring a medkit, inner strength, pharmacy, or just realize you dont need to be healed 24/7
---
Yeah there is. As someone who likes to survivor-stealth it up it makes it real hard to be quiet or lose a spirit.
---
As Killer, I lose people running in circles. It's corn blindness plus a night mode filter D:
---
1) you can get a flash blind from the side (sort of) more of at an angle than from the full side but its much harder and requires much accuracy and timing.
---
2) no way to test them unfortunately, best thing is to watch videos on them before buying.
---
3)yes granted it's very very faint sound, but if close by and not shifting through grass they can possibly hear you, I have pulled out survivors like that.
---
If they were to change her, there should be more of an insensitive to cleanse, perhaps the sickness could slow down action speeds like Freddy‚Äôs jump rope/ swing chain just something apart from being permanently injured.
---
So THAT'S why my medkit was depleting so fast. I had the green and yellow charge add-ons on a yellow medkit, and after one heal it was less than half left, I was so confused. I did get a blind that I was certain I should've gotten the save from, but I thought I was just the tiniest bit too early or lag or something
---
With a flashlight you kinda need to aim for their neck, its where the killer's camera of the game is. Play a couple of games to practice I'd say, also you cant really blind on the side more straight onwards.
---
There are sometimes offerings that are killer shards that will let you test out killers, for example theres a black splinter to test out Myers and a jaw bone to test leather face. I think the shards are for the licenced killers only but Im not sure on that one. 
---
And yes the killer can hear the locker noise within a couple of meters
---
I‚Äôve seen an oni every game so I just throw on a lery‚Äôs offering anytime I play survivor
---
Thats what changed in the update. Which is what I was saying. It used to tho thats the nerf
---
If you gameshare the game and are for example in the EU and use a US version of the game it won't show cells in the store and when you go to your console store you can buy them and they'll never go to your dbd because the game has to match the currency the cells were bought with. I bought my friend the dbd for his country, 3350 cells and some dlc's after figuring this out after sending tickets to bhvr. The only thing you can do is get a refund, buy the game in the right currency and then buy stuff on it. Otherwise it'll just never show up. After my friend got the correct version of dbd he could buy cells and it went to the account the only bug that happened was he couldn't buy outfits for the discounted price (the set) but it unfucked itself after a few hours.
---
^ same would happen to dlc on your account
---
found the self care user.
---
Perk one would only be useful for this killer, Makes more sense as an add-on
---
Now if only they would also fix all of trappers bugs
---
No you always know that a killer has a Mori but for killer they can get lucky and find one and lose because of it that‚Äôs the main problem for me at this moment
---
Woooah I thought this was some SFM trickery until I took a closer look, this is great!
---
Maybe addons that add status effects to injured survs. And I feel like corrupt purge would have to be nerfed a little. Maybe make it work like vile purge but putting survs into dying when it's full.
---
1. You pretty much have to shine it in their face/neck area. If you do it while the killer is in the process of picking up a downed survivor. they‚Äôll be stunned and the survivor will be dropped. This isn‚Äôt easy to do though as it requires you to be close enough to the downed survivor as they get picked AND reveal yourself to the killer. The Flashlight is good for rescues but mainly used after dropping a pallet during a chase. Use it too much, good or bad, and you‚Äôre likely to get tunneled and facecamped because it‚Äôs really annoying to deal with as a killer. 
---
2. I don‚Äôt believe there is a way to play the locked killers unless you buy them. Check YT for a more in-depth answer as I don‚Äôt know much about that. 
---
3. I believe there are some killer perks that let them know when someone is in a locker, but not specifically which locker. Some survivors have benefits to using lockers that may or may not negate the killer notification for fast entering a locker. Or just being in one. Regular entering shouldn‚Äôt give you away unless you‚Äôre getting chased, break line of sight, and get in one and they have a perk that notifies them of someone hiding. They could probably put 2&amp;2 together at that point lmao. But that‚Äôs so situational, you‚Äôll probably never encounter that. 
---
Bonus: you may or may not know this, but scratch marks appear behind you as you sprint. They‚Äôre easy for the killer to follow during a chase if you‚Äôre not careful. So what I do sometimes (this completely hinges on the distance between the killer and you.) is run into a building or looping area (any multiple wall area with windows and pallets) one direction, then walk away in the other and hide. Usually it‚Äôll throw the killer off and you‚Äôll be able to escape. But this only works if they‚Äôre far enough away for you to break line of sight and trick them. 
---
I hope this was helpful, have fun!
---
The story behind why I made this meme is because a red rank nurse was fighting to hook us in the basement, only the basement, I'm talking they were hauling ass across the map and redowning us to get us there. When we asked if they knew about the bug they said "it's in the game lol don't play if you can't handle it" 
---
Bro you're playing one of the strongest killers in the game and you're still purposely glitching people out? Scumbag alert
---
After a few games I've come to decision that there isn't really a reason to use your power anymore.  Mathematically speaking 12 seconds of mend time isn't worth the 13 seconds of time investment per survivor you'll put into applying it to multiple people.  I think the biggest nerf here is the changes to deep wounds means that survivors have no real sense of threat from the Deep wounds the mend timer is so weak now that I can re apply deep wounds to the same survivor twice in the same frenzy.
---
I mean, fuck it, Oni's Demon Rage already lights him up like a godamn christmas tree anyway. Might as well give the fans what they want.
---
Fixed ;)
---
New killer The limitless
---
Ability- Bask in his glory
---
feelsbadman
---
I like that a lot more this is a really cool perk  idea the overall killer is pretty interesting keep on thinking of new ideas
---
bro chill
---
because crybaby survs said they were best killer and unbeatable
---
Thank you love!! I‚Äôm really glad you like it! Thanks a lot for your support!! ~&lt;33
---
This literally just happened to me but I got stuck kicking a gen, survivors said they saw me against a wall hitting it, wasn‚Äôt until a Bill started on the gen I managed to grab him off and it unstuck me. I let the survivors go and had to explain in post chat that I wasn‚Äôt hacking I was simply stuck.. sigh
---
Pig is her own killer yes! But a pooh one 
---
She needs QOL changes
---
I'm only getting worse frame drops on the new map.
---
What platform are you on ? If ps4 I‚Äôll do it with you tonight if you‚Äôre down
---
Oh I see, then yes it's garbage
---
which killer(s) do you have in mind?
---
Not 100%, it's more of there is like ~20 possible spots for totems and 5-9 will spawn.
---
A screenshot of a reddit comment. Now I've seen it all.
---
I main ash, like I play him all the time. And I honestly cannot tell you how many times I was literally on the other side of a tree from a killer and they were blind as hell and somehow didn‚Äôt see me. I‚Äôve done that so many times.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on ps4 my username is Golondrina1414 if you can help it will mean a lot to me I‚Äôve been struggling with this challenge
---
you need to have a medkit equipped for the 2 states, you don't need to use the medkit. Based on the wording i 99'd then finished the heal with the medkit just in case though.
---
Thanks, Sherlock.
---
I believe they nerfed him into the floor but that may just be me.
---
Go away nea üò≠
---
***drops pallet***
---
Ghostface jumping down and assassinating claudette
---
the faster you do it the less guilty you can feel
---
I think he's better than before, the deep wounds change helps, if people walk it ticks down, if people vault windows it ticks down, if people do gens it ticks down.
---
I am a legion main, and i dont feel any difference in his abilities or addons
---
Listen here you little shit
---
Pros: You can catch people with your power much more effectively
---
Cons: His neutral game is completely neutered compared to before. Deep wound is now even less effective, he has almost no perk synergies, and he probably has the worst capability to end chases after the initial hit.
---
tbf if there's 2 of you alive and you've 4 gens left, you need to accept that only one of you can escape.
---
Was just about to comment the same lmao.
---
You are not playing the clown. You are playing the entire circus. Please don‚Äôt punish people for things they didn‚Äôt know. Punish only the guilty, never the innocent.
---
Me either, I like the speed increases
---
THIS HURTS
---
The new survivor looks nothing like what she did in the trailer.
---
Lmfao
---
Lmao and someone downvoted this. Wow.
---
Man, it's not like they put the basement bug in the game on purpose. Making a game is hard, balancing it is harder, but bugfixing it is the hardest.
---
