Noed is also a complete waste if you don't get to end game, but survivors will still call you a no skill noed user after you get a 4k.
---
---
---
I don't think it's that; if someone deliberately plays more toxic to deny people of points when setting them though, that sucks.
---

---
I've been facecamped first hook over people bringing in BPS. There's definitely a "gotta ruin people's chances" mentality with some.

‚ÄúMarty, I‚Äôm scared‚Äù

Farming with Freddy is a bit.... Awkward.
---
In this case I would give him (played with him as well, and he DCd against trapper) a pass.
---
I can appreciate a good window fake if you aren't teabagging me afterwards lol
---
I knew about Chainsaw Myers and survivors running a splinter to force the killer to play Perkless Freddy but never heard of a killer running survivor perks.
---
You said the entity but that doesn't look like nea ???????
---
That could actually encourage me to join a club, but I have to wonder if this feature would encourage the formation of 4 man SWF groups. If those become too prevalent (only 5% of matches have these groups currently) and prove to be too powerful it could lead to survivor nerfs that really hurt solo players.
---
Yeah, thats literally how they got to red ranks
---
Had to vs the same Wraith several times last night and they got increasingly toxic. DC'd the third game because a hooked survivor got away when gates were opened, we were all about to leave and got booted. 
---
Console is a fantastic place.
---
But ‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt distinguish between leaving through the menu and an actual crash?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH94gY0Uk_U
---
All of this noed shit started away before MoM came to the game...
---
Trapper main here!  It‚Äôs all about owning your turf.  Pick your side of the map and corral survivors onto it.  Never gets old when survivors burn through 3 genies super fast and get overconfident when they are playing right into my hand.
---
What does prayer beads have to do with a DC? Does it make your internet shitty or something?
---
Yea that's annoying as killer.
---
I can't find a game on PS4 :(
---
To be blunt, I‚Äôm doing that because I intend to prestige that character and want to actually try those add-ons before I lose them.
---
This. I get miffed from the tbagging, and not actually from skillful escapes
---
oh for sure, for farming I'd say knock it out altogether tbh. Just gets to a point where you want to actually play, and you only get 1 chase before a gen or two pops, and it feels like they snowball too fast for you to catch up.
---
Then your totem gets popped instantly anyway.
---
Tbh I‚Äôve been rank 1 a few times now and only went against my first scratched mirror a few days ago. Then two games after had scratched mirror on ormond the poor bastard. 
---
You rarely see it now. I do have one ready in my inventory though just waiting on a game or lery‚Äôs offering.
---
Congrats my dude!
---
It's the only game where you expect the other side to play fair. I played 7 years of League and still think DBD has a worse community.
---
Isn‚Äôt there a bug around that can cause player models to become invisible? Someone posted an invisible Claudette cleansing a totem a week or so ago.
---
*4 stocks the killer*
---
It's $10 for ONE outfit. I get that the devs need financial support, but I wish they'd reasonably price everything like their old clothing DLCs.
---
Wild guess. Is it for a tattoo?
---
I know what the perk does, but it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with disconnects unless the survivors playing against it are a pack of little bitches who DC at the first sign of any difficulty
---
Added in that Nurse and Billy for the true experience.
---
I work all weekend. I was happy that it was going to run through Monday then I saw the event ends Monday afternoon. üòï
---
*ROLF will remember that*
---
It‚Äôs kind of a hit and miss sometimes. Like with the tractor i‚Äôll go off most times for me but there‚Äôs occasionally times where it wont activate and i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm too low idk
---
Hey nice flair
---
Oh hey
---
And the best part is when they blame you for triggering them even though you never stopped crouching
---
If you think "shack looping" makes you a trash human, you should very seriously consider stopping to play this game. Because that is literally playing this game.
---
As a tip regarding the actual topic: You can disable the post-game chat. "ChatDefaultVisibility=False" in your GameUserSettings.ini and never worry about interacting with players outside of the game again, unless you want to.
---
Gross
---
Dwights everywhere cry out.
---
I thought this was the latest season (apocalypse) when she came back ?? I swore she said that same exact line. Coven was the best season though.
---
Idk man there is so much sodium the human body can tolerate, but 2x tho
---
I 4k'ed last night as killer and didn't get a pip.
---
Sweet and sour baby Jesus, this is dumb.
---
Nice meme but I hate this idea
---
I think if you really are that sensitive, DBD isn't for you, and that's okay.
---
Nah thats just the new Nea skin.
---
aw poor floofables
---
Survival point offerings are key, when the killers are DCing after offering screen.
---
If they want to ruin the fun, at least get a bonus you can get without setting foot in the trial.
---
no, it doesn't
---
His chest speaks for him.
---
It says: "ssssssssssss ahhhhhhhhhhhh"
---
But killers dont DC as often :D
---
and it's corruption vile
---
Anonymous lobbies.
---
The stats show that the 4 man advantage is pretty small overall and that only matters if majority of people use vc
---
We definitely need an Arnold Schwarzenegger-like survivor.
---
*points to open door* Leave
---
I'd be happy if my random survivor teammates didn't hook dive or DC the first time they got hit. The amount of buffoonery from some of the survivors during this event is terrible. Why do double bloodpoints do this to people? And don't even get me started on all of the lag switching. (My friend called the killer out after the match and they said they definitely did....) I love the points for these but the terrible gaming nature on both sides of this event make it so terrible to play as either.
---
how exactly does BT or MoM stop tunneling? Spine Chill is also useless if the killer already found you, not to mention you have to still be around the killer to pip too. JUST doing gens is not enough to pip as well, I know you're being a smartass for no reason but it is still statistically impossible to pip especially in mid-high ranks if you only fulfill 2 categories, which is usually all that's possible if the killer is really bad, tunneling you or someone else, or if the match goes by too fast.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Sorry does he/she thinks that using ruin means your bad at the game? The thing that can be negated after a 2-3 minute search?
---
I love infinite wall hack Meyers it‚Äôs so funny to get a grab
---
Prove Thyself, We'll Make It, Adrenaline and Lithe.  Lithe will be switched for Borrowed Time eventually.
---
What glitch is this?
---
Ha no, for a graduation cap actually!
---
for survivor definitely bal landing, bond, deliverance and adrenaline
---
Typical build: Bbq, ruin, nurses and then bamboozle on Wraith, prefer nurses and bamboozle then spirit fury and enduring
---
why doesnt this have more upvotes.
---
Play some killer and you‚Äôll understand the hit boxes better
---
They are just bad
---
Good
---
This almost made me spit out my drink
---
Teabagging the killer usually makes them want to mori you instead
---
And Tenacity.
---
I'd like to believe you're being sarcastic.
---
Agreed, and I'm fine with people using it for the reason that is intended instead of just to BM.
---
I would've just done one at a time so that I had at least 1 survivor with perks, but go ahead and do it your way.
---
I fucking snorted into my drink with that comment. Good fucking job lol
---
I mean, they're pretty basic, you could probably find them in an H&amp;M.
---
That Jake one is N O.  But Dwight sweater, I'd be on that.
---
Lmao
---
for survivors i like running DH, Solidarity, Botany Knowledge + Emphaty or DH, Open-Handed, Bond + Iron Will, either DH, MoM, DS + Adrenaline. For my Myers i run M&amp;A, Ruin, BBQ, Whispers, for Pig i run Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin, BBQ, for Hag i use Nurse's, Sloppy, M&amp;A, STBFL and for Legion i use Sloppy, M&amp;A, Bloodhound, BBQ.
---
Agreed
---
It really do be like that
---
i was talking about recovery speed, otherwise Flip-Flop and No Mither affect it as well
---
This is the worst thing you could've done. 
---
Your bloodwebs now have all perks available which means you will have to spend a lot of bloodpoints and go through a lot of useless perks before a decent build presents. Even then, it will take even longer to get the perks on this build to lv3.
---
gotta love the instant "he must be hacking" rather than, hmm, looking at the killer's loadout. Big brain manuver right there.
---
If I‚Äôm last, to increase my chances of living I don‚Äôt wiggle when they pick me up
---
1st game as killer after months of not playing ( usually rank 1-3) and I'm breezing through these poor lower rank players so I start playing dumb to let them farm and when I down one of them for 3rd hook he DCs and send me a message saying "Couldn't let trash killer get my points". wut
---
Bohooo cry more just get over it
---
About equal to survivors throughout the year. ;D
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Both sides can be assholes, and just because people are trying to kill you, doesn't make them toxic.
---
So that basically 3. 5 seconds?
---
He looks like he‚Äôs concerned about your wellbeing. Considering you‚Äôre playing DBD, he‚Äôs Toto be worried.
---
Yeah but it will only happen to you if u tunnel a survivor so
---
Iron Will, Botany Knowledge, Poised and Resilience.
---
I actually really want it for pallets because I hate stuns,  I have make yout choice so I never tunnel
---
Enduring is a good perk to have non the less, so in the end u should get it
---
Poor guy probably crashed but atleast OP got an insta heal haha
---
During the blood hunt I've played so many games that I was a rank 2 killer and my lobbies were taking 15+ minutes to fill. I'm not gonna DC to Down-rank like a total douche, so instead I used Moris for a few games until I was rank 5 again. 
---
Memento Mori: "The fun way to earn better queue times."
---
\**This message was sponsored by the Practical Mori Syndicate.*
---
I always ask people if breakdown is worth it or not.
---
Does it help in matches?
---
I think if u have enduring lvl 3 and they use DS on you you can almost hit them instantly so DS would be worthless
---
This made me laugh harder than it should‚Äôve
---
Im not one of the people complaining but if you include 2, 3 and 4 mans it's roughly 50%. Still enough to make a difference.
---
Enduring id say is the overall most useful perk in a chase. If you can combine it with spirit fury and enduring you‚Äôve got the M1 meta pretty much. My favorite thing to do as trapper is to run enduring, brutal strength, spirit fury and bamboozle. It‚Äôs my ‚Äúfuck your loops‚Äù build. Some survivors can drag the chases out a little bit but everyone goes down eventually. The downside of course is that you get genrushed to hell but you have fun losing.
---
This looked more like the game forcing the DC.  The few times I know I was the one forced out I‚Äôd see everyone stuck moving and then seconds later it‚Äôd say killer disconnected and boot me out. Pretty sure this is what happened with her
---
Just being a survivor is toxic dude haven‚Äôt you heard? The way they breathe, look, work on gens, exist is toxic.
---
But on paper brutal strength looks so meh
---
Enduring is better overall
---
Thank you
---
Ok.
---
I have a video somewhere of my tbagging with Kate and my tits are flying all over the place. I was using the amerikate skin which ups the jiggles to 11
---
Ive been 2 hooking people this event. No one is gonna be optimal so trying to avoid ranking.
---
Really? I went into the store and flipped her around and didn't see it. Maybe because I only messed with the ski gear and the American flag shirt?
---
It means you burn through pallets extremely fast though and can quickly kick gens mid chase without losing too much ground. If you can get an idiot survivor who just runs from pallet to pallet throwing them down as soon as possible the late game becomes a cakewalk. It‚Äôs a build that‚Äôs more than the sum of its parts if you get me.
---
Finally, someone in the community who has a sense of humour üòÇ
---
As far as we know, they are random.
---
Someone told me to "Kys" after I hit him and he dc'd. So that was fun.
---
[removed]
---
Reddit found it funny the first time
---
Chaotic neutral. But you are acknowledging how ineffective mori‚Äôs are and I accept that
---
I think they're going to be scrapping the RNG mechanics of Freddy's power. At least if they're smart.
---
It rounds to whole percentages on the review, but you were probably 99.6% or something. Unfortunately the line has to be drawn somewhere.
---
Even small mistakes get punished, then if it comes down to it they can tell each other to die for hatch which some will do just because if toy dont get everyone it's a win in their eyes
---
I have a comment on my profile saying something like "-rep wallhacks and uses BBQ+chili to hide it". I love dumb survivors
---
I‚Äôve noticed on pc when people get hooked, there is a black square instead of the blurry bubble when someone gets hooked like normal.
---
Oh, I knew what I was doing. I want the grind to see what builds I would be forced to use.
---
We now need the MoMs

typical computer generated  randomness

Just ignore those baby Killers.

I have, i think i dont, but in the end i do. Its when the game loads then they dc.
---
It‚Äôs a game. It‚Äôs fun. I commend this! Find perks you might not normally use.
---
I'd buy at least 2 of them.
---
I‚Äôd definitely buy Dwight‚Äôs, and maybe Feng‚Äôs if it came in a different color.
---
I'm wailing hahahaha
---
honestly the VHS and japanese VHS tape trapper hoodie/shirt they have is sick, probably their best item
---
You should get the nurse's perks. They're really good on a lot of builds
---
Lemme guess, Nea?
---
Their entire name history is an assortment of explaining how they're going to DC. Why should the community continuously be punished because of players like this?
---
How would you improve them or balance them?
---
If only parents actually stopped their kids from playing :(
---
Oh I already got nurses and stridor from shrine but thanks! 2
---
thank you and see you in the fog
---
2 more perks that reveal survivor locations. Why?
---
I wish more people did. I haven't gone against her since she came out :(
---
Had a game with only 3 survivors and one had the name ‚ÄúHex: Farm BP‚Äù so I was like ok should be good and every survivor was still playing the game normal so then I didn‚Äôt farm just played the game and got the 3k and at the end I get called sweaty.  Like ok bud.
---
Heading to r/dbdgonewild?
---
That "fucking" hit you really expressed my feelings of anger and frustration when I hook and look out for BBQ I see a surviors running at me with possible wglf
---
me and the boys waking u pay 3am to go consume the souls of sacrificed survivors
---
Maybe Myers then, if only because Doc has Monitor and Abuse which gives you complete stealth in Tier 1 Myers.
---
yeah because she sucks
---
It's done. I'll post them probably on Monday, I want to get as much double bloodpoints as I can before uploading more art, it's quite time consuming. ;P
---
So you cannot directly name other players, you can alude to other high profile player but no you canmot directly name other players with out their consent.
---
DBD
---
In terms of that game, yeah the feeling sucks. But who cares about rank. If i depip I honestly think, hell yeah, better lobby times coming my way
---
I hate to say it but once the endgame collapse releases that will be the only time when camping becomes a legitimate strategy. The only counter play the Killer has will be either to finish off everyone before the doors open or otherwise create a window wherein the survivors can‚Äôt actually escape. The best way to do that will be camping. Once both doors are open that hooked survivor is the most defensible objective on the map. If there‚Äôs only 30 seconds left on the clock it‚Äôs the smart thing to do.
---
Oh good, so now the insta dc are killer's fault and not the pieces of shit survivors who can't play except when EVERY SINGLE THING goes their way ?
---
I'm getting fucking tired of being left with only 2 other teammates because: It's not the killer the guy wanted, he got down first or whatever dumb reason didn't suit him.
---
That sweater is beyond overkill. 
---
And that's coming from someone who actually wants a really grungy Jake cosmetic.  As though he just came out of the woods after 2 weeks with more twigs and leaves in his hair, torn jacket as though a cartoon chemistry experiment just blew up in his face.
---
Hahahah. WTF.
---
Recently they brought it up.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019
---
All they really said was they're doing some sort of complete overhaul and not a numbers tweak, something "more complex than anything we've done before for a killer" or something like that.
---
Hold on-20/25/30 total progression? Are you insane friend? That's Pop Goes the Weasel on multiple gens lmao-and you think mine is broken...
---
Yep...
---
Murder
---
#NOOOOOO
---
Uhhh nurse is broken af regardless of system.
---
Shes just better on PC
---
I‚Äôve actually been enjoying one thing about playing Hag: drawing symbols on the ground to pad up my devious score while one survivor waits by the exit to taunt. Usually only takes a minute before they realize I‚Äôm not coming.
---
No. We just ban them for 24hrs and if it happens again 48 hr ban and so on and so on. We all knkw dcing is wrong. Why the devs have not made an out right claim to say yes we think dcing is wrong just shows who's side theyre on. I mean its a not like dcing ok by anyone but toxic peoples standards.
---
It sucks how people DC. I really do hope the devs are able to solve the issue sooner rather than later.
---
It sucks when that happens but it doesn't happen much to be concerned over fixing imo.
---
Ur insane
---
This same meme format but it‚Äôs holding Flip-Flop saying it‚Äôs an anti-slug perk and it‚Äôs Adam staying this is our fifth anti slug perk.
---
Ding dong, totem gone
---
Something I love about current Freddy is using Pill Bottle. Often survivors do that thing where they sit on the gen when you sleep them so they hopefully get a skill check or finish it, then leave before the transition ends because they see your glimpses.
---
Without the glimpses via using Pill Bottle, you can sit right behind them, and they'll think you ran off or something, and with fast reaction time you can do a gen-grab when they enter the dream world which is always hilarious.
---
How tho?she has good map pressure,her power is decent in chasing with the broken effect,and once you get corrupt purge you get the best attack in the game.
---
would it be sandbagging if one legion hopped a pallet during the chase and blocked it for the other two?
---
Man, do I hate Drake memes.
---
I also hate you with a passion and I hate myself more for reading the comments yet still clicking it
---
I like her, good if you get tired of playing only billy, huntress and nurse.
---
I also get a good amount of 3-4k so I don't think she sucks.
---
Go to the Hagger's Den on Discord and ask the people there, I'm not explaining this shit again.
---
i remember that they said that Freddy would still stay faithful to the OG freddy, which is nice
---
Reading comprehension is for noobs, gg ez enjoy ur ban /s
---
I think that is kind of the point. Make it a tad harder to trail the survivor(s) who is now on a &lt;2 minute timer before they die regardless.
---
oops didnt mean to put the "?"
---
You shouldn't have to use add ons to make a power good. It's obnoxious to get corrupt purge because you have to go out of your way to head to the fountain, at which point every survivor hears the audio cue saying you have it, so they can just stealth for one minute until the power runs out.
---
Imagine being asked to explain yourself and then saying "Nah, go ask these people I cbf"
---
If a survivor sees an infected generator, they‚Äôre not going to want to repair it, if they are infected they are more audible and will have to cleanse themselves which is time consuming and leaves a corrupt fountain, a survivor is not going to run in an open area and in closed area‚Äôs you can easily mind game the survivor. Corrupt purge is a great attack as it covers a wide area and can hit multiple survivors at once, I‚Äôm sorry but you must be really bad with her if you think she‚Äôs this terrible of a killer
---
No, it‚Äôs all random. Now that the bloodhunt is active, getting teachable perks is really easy, i recommend you to level up the hag
---
Incredibly mature and nuanced comment.  You can go back to 4chan now.
---
But muh Subway sandwich worth of money
---
Bruh every fucking killer is at least a little add-on reliant. And you say survivors can just hide when you get corrupt purge (which usually they don't) that's still a minute they wasted not doing gens.
---
‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to use add ons to make a power good‚Äù....um?
---
 B A N E D     L M A O
---
I want to be able to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an alone wolf‚Äù and leave situations that would be co-op.
---
Basically when a match ends you get ranked. The best outcome is 2 "pips" which are basically like partial level ups.
---
So for merciless killer you need to get that 2nd pip. Which means really you need to do almost the best possible but also drag the matches out some. 
---
Just getting 4 sacrifices doesn't work. You want to be sure you are hooking every survivor 2-3 times, not letting every gen get done and chasing survivors a good bit.
---
Did I say the game ends ? Did I? I asked a simple question dont answer a question with a question..
---
*Leatherface grunt/cry noises
---
*
---
Yeah, and it's a minute that you're not gonna find anyone as well, because Claudette is still invisible when crouching.
---
Riiight?
---
Enduring is the much better perk.
---
Noted
---
Yeah, i'm mad that i get like one proper game every 3 game because of someone who DC.
---
Being sick doesn't do anything, you moron. Being broken doesn't fucking matter when the killer can't touch you because her power doesn't help at loops. Being more audible also doesn't matter for the same reason. Corrupt Purge is a bad attack because when you pick it up, every player hears the "DONG" sound effect, at which point you can stealth for 45 seconds and wait out the power. Don't you fucking say "I must be bad" when I bring up legitimate problems with the Killer. Plague is only good if the Survivors are bad, just like with every other Killer in this godforsaken game. When Survivors die, they don't think about what they could have done better, they immediately assume the Killer is OP.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I literally can‚Äôt take you seriously anymore, was the plague your ex or something?
---
I already did explain myself. As expected, people were like "Nah Plague is actually really good I swear I'm not bad at the game, don't worry"
---
They started this month
---
Why would we want this btw? Isnt the divide big enough already?
---
Didn't the devs say at one point that all the characters as they appear in-game are minimum 18? Seems to me there'd be some ratings problems if not, especially considering the manner in which the Spirit's dressed/presented (floating severed limbs and all). 
---
I'd imagine that goes against some sort of ratings guideline against child gore.
---
Yeah I had the weirdest game just tonight! I played survivor, did 2 gens myself (out of 3 total), saved someone, and attempted another save but ended up getting injured and not getting him. I ended up hatching and after the game 2/3 other survivors just totally shat on me for apparently not doing anything? The killer tried to help but they went after him too. It was super bizarre and came out of nowhere. There's an insane amount of sore losers and winners in this game.
---
My boyfriend tried to play killer once and lost; but he did hook few people and it was his first try so of course he failed! A survivor in the chat was so mean that he hasn't tried to play killer since. I don't get why people want to ruin things for other players, it destroys the game.
---
Just a little bit
---
Did the plague leave you for someone better and more likeable?
---
M&amp;A, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Discordance and Bloodwarden on spirit
---
Yeah usually there's 1-2 survivors that hide but the others have to do gens and once you even see one  of them when you have corrupt purge their screwed.
---
oh damn, your shirt is a bit soaked, isn't it? what you get for crying I guess
---
Give up dude seek other sources
---
The crazy cat lady sweater is LIFE!!
---
Im a Jake main, and I dont mind Dwight mains. They tend to either be lost puppies I must protect or they tend to carry my ass to victory
---
Sad it seems you cant say the same
---
Good job on avoiding the entire fucking point that I made. Care to keep talking in circles for the next hour, where I bring up points about Plague that are bad, and you say "Nah ur bad"? Because I don't. Tell me what your fucking Discord @ is, and I'll link you to a server full of people who will also say you're wrong. 
---
Also, I'd like to again point out that you've yet to make any substantive points that I haven't refuted. And when I made my latest one, you decided to just make an ad hominem attack. Never change.
---
supercharge with bloodwarden...
---
EGC is now 2 minutes...
---
Ive come to understand it as similar to being a try hard. Id guess this is more objectionable among more casual gamers.
---
Trash may may
---
There‚Äôs add ons for a reason, If every killer didn‚Äôt have an add on and just used their base ability then I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre all fucked
---
A truly scary perk
---
Had a game where one of the randos dropped a streamer and he camped like what? Sent him a message we would've let you get stacks for bbq and hits but he never responded idk some new people come and play what they think is a good strategy but I'm sure some regret it once they know how rare double BP is
---
Yes, that is absolutely the case. My point is that it shouldn't be the case.
---
Claudettes be like: *I'M GOING GHOST*
---
Definitely Michael, DO NOT BUY UNLISENCED DLCS UNTIL YOU HAVE THE LISENCED DLCS, you can buy the DLCs that aren't based on movies with in-game currency (Iridecent Shards), but not the ones that are based off of movies.
---
Your point was, she‚Äôs only good because she uses add ons, that‚Äôs why she is terrible, so by your logic, every killer is terrible...? Tf
---
It's the other way around for me. If they wiggle, I'll smack the hook and pass by it. Sometimes they take the hint. If you don't wiggle at all, you're dead, 'cause I don't give the hatch to quitters.
---
Okay let's say every single survivor hides during corrupt purge that still gives you the advantage when corrupt purge ends because you can just start infecting the gens,and that gives you map control and is a time waster.
---
Literally how high are you right now when did I say every Killer is terrible
---
Oh yea it does get better especially since the ranking system is so harsh so only good people get up there however I stopped playing survivor for a bit to get a farming killer build and that made my survivor rank go down to 14 so I cant get out unless I swf and that's not always fun for killer so I solo que but it's always hit or miss with some survivors/killers who make not so smart decisions
---
It doesn't give you any advantage because being sick doesn't matter, ergo, infecting gens is a waste of YOUR time, not the Survivors'.
---
Don‚Äôt forget all the freaking DCs and infinite loading screens when wasting perfectly good blood streamers and cakes.
---
I said by your logic but alright whatever
---
This is literally the only pvp game I have played where not only do the devs and higher up's encourage griefing like this, they count on it keeping their broken game alive after 3 years. Constant bugs and broken mechanics are ignored, so they can focus on pushing out new content that is mediocre at best. With every supposed bug fix more always crop up, and/or older bugs which were fixed in some earlier patch, magically gets reintroduced. The game in its current state is more bugged now than ever and quality of life within is at its lowest ever; I loved this game more than most and am just sad to see what it has become...
---
Playing as Nea that explains it
---
swap BBQ with Lullaby and slap on a game/lerry offering
---
I play both sides, but does crouching at your opponent equal the same as holding a game hostage with a mori spam? Both sides can be toxic sure,  but man do people get absolutely butthurt over crouch spam.
---
Baby cloverfield monster...
---
So you‚Äôre saying a survivor is gonna go ahead and touch an infected gen?
---
Oh cool!
---
Yeah, you get to live that everyday don't you?
---
Nice
---
I don‚Äôt do it to quit, I do it so say ‚ÄúBruh it‚Äôs your choice now if I die or get the hatch do what you want with me‚Äù
---
If they're smart, they will. Being broken against Plague doesn't mean anything, she has no power against loops, so deadass just loop her for three gens.
---
I‚Äôm gonna vomit on this gen to save me time as I won‚Äôt need to patrol it for a moment, if they touch it, I‚Äôll know and if they cleanse themselves, I get a buff....3 positives
---
He gave you a gift, how sweet. But yeah, as a Jake main I can 100% say most Jakes are just stupid. They try their best but ultimately they fail. Its not malicious most of the time its just we all have to share a single braincell at one time
---
SWF has all the tools they need to make a killer's game absolutely miserable. Insta-heals, MoM, Adrenaline, flashlights, voice comms, etc.
---
If a group of 4 really good, coordinated survivors have those tools, the game is unwinnable for the killer. It's not about being a pussy or wanting a challenge, it's about not wanting to even put effort into something you have no chance of winning
---
I don't even know how to point or use the actions they give us now lmao I play on PS4
---
Or you know....her corrupt purge but like who remembers that?
---
We've been over this. Being sick doesn't matter, because being Broken doesn't matter, because loops completely destroy the Plague.
---
Almost every killer except nurse relies on add ons
---
MaYbE YoU ShOuLdN't HaVe StAyEd NeAr ThE hOoK fOr 0.1 SeCoNdS!!1!
---
Pig is to cute for me to get mad when she camps
---
The only "boss" I actually beat on my first try in that game lol...
---
Or you could take a second to realize that getting Corrupt Purge in the middle of a chase is situational as all hell and also largely up to the Survivor whether or not the chase goes to an area with a fountain.
---
Of course it will
---
Pretty sure I played against this dude the other day lol
---
I main Dwight and I've actually only had good encounters with Jakes. I dontknow how they feel about me, but I try to buddy up with a Jake if I find one. Iverealized I have better and more successful matches where I do.
---
Things are different for Megs and Neas. They're my teammates, but I'm wary to them. I find if I stick by them for too long, I'll get caught and hooked in no time.
---
I also like Davids. They're rare, but I always feel like I can count on them, and I always have their backs too.
---
I think these types of killers are the equivalent of immersed survivors. Immersed survs play the game stealthy because they're scared shitless. These types of killers believe they're an unstoppable force until the dainty Asian chick wearing a short skirt runs circles around a car. It breaks their immersion in the role, so they find it unfair.
---
Hell yeah preach my dude!
---
Laurie‚Äôs does as well. Looks pretty funny
---
Probably around 60% of the playerbase
---
Its a toxic add-on that shouldn't be in the game to begin with, but the devs seem to love and encourage toxicity
---
and we can make them pay to make a club, with MONEY. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA.
---
Damn, I'm dumb to not have known that lol thanks!
---
The chase doesn‚Äôt have to be anywhere remotely near a fountain and it‚Äôs not really situational as if I have corrupt purge I‚Äôm obviously going to start a chase that is going to end quickly, did I mention add ons?
---
A flying crow in the sky
---
I play on ps4 as well, never tried playing on pc because everyone that I play swf with uses the ps4. I have nothing to compare it to, but I agree certain killers can be a pain to play
---
I consider myself a survivor more than a killer. If your on ps4 we can play
---
Or they could just leave and be done with it
---
That's really solid for only having 2 pages worth of perks, nice going!
---
They are a specific custom perk icons made just for her., stealing it isn‚Äôt right. There‚Äôs a version almost the same made by Geistra.
---
If you get corrupt purge, every survivor gets a loud-ass sound notification saying that you have it, so they know that they should just go stealthy the second they hear the terror radius.
---
Being sick matters, being broken definitely matters and loops are only an annoyance for the plague, I thought we‚Äôve went over this but you keep putting us in circles to prove your minority of a point
---
The Wraith was a joke until the rework. After that, his life turned for the better and he started going out with the most popular killer in the realm. It's pure genius.
---
All doctor mains press the left button.
---
Bubbas just declare to stay out of their basement.
---
Legions dont even know what a button is
---
I don't think I've actually put any blood points into my doctor for a while he's been at p1 lv40 for so long.
---
I think they should change Kate‚Äôs main screen animation where she‚Äôs playing a guitar
---
Not really, if they already have the exit gates open, even if you start the EGC, they have plenty of time to teabag you before leaving.
---
I mean, it is, probably not efficient though. Then again people are so damn altruistic that in the time you spend trying to unhook from a camper you could have finished every gen with 100% hook time still left
---
Which... says a lot about killer power
---
Ever heard of anti stealth perks and you‚Äôve just wasted a long ass time being stealthy and not fixing gens but okay I guess whatever you want
---
Oh look more benefit to being a killer... amazing. At this rate the survivor player base will be there only to be used as pinata's for a lone sociopath. RIP.
---
"Loops are only an annoyance for Plague?" What the fuck kind of drugs are you right now? Plague's power does nothing to stop loops, just like Wraith's power. Are you saying that loops aren't a problem for Wraith as well, because if you don't say so, you're not being logically consistent.
---
I meant on this forum, I rarely see survivor posts. But I‚Äôm not searching high &amp; low for them either, usually get distracted by a meme lol
---
You're saying she should be doing stealth takedowns instead?
---
‚Äúplagues power does nothing to stop loops‚Äù yes because vomiting on pallets, windows doesn‚Äôt do anything to the survivor
---
I used to main Jake like when I first got the game and from what I could tell my mindset when playing Jake back then was "Me find hook, me break hook, hook hurt friend" and whenever I saw Dwights they'd just kinda hang around gens or near lockers so I'd sit there thinking with that 1 shared braincell "Locker man no help he bad, me angry"
---
I know perks aren't a *huge* indicator of skill and these guys are Rank 15 but... y'all mothafuckas have half a dozen teachables and purple flashlights and you don't know what Mirror Myers is? Fuck off liars.
---
Name one anti stealth perk that will help you to pinpoint the exact location of Survivors if they're just crouching around the map. The only anti stealth perk that will help you there is Whispers, and if you're using Whispers you've honestly just made poor life choices.
---
Should be 150% instead of 25%... that way you can actually do a gen before the killer comes back to patrol it, once it goes off you're pretty much dead any way.
---
most posts here are somehow related to Survivor Mains (complaining about Camping, tunneling, perks, or just certain Killers in general)
---
Just look and you will find plenty :)
---
I think the scariest part was that you were able to take a screenshot of this while opening the gate
---
and how many times do I have to say that being broken doesn't mean anything when loops still last for three gens
---
Just because you use streamers doesn't mean the other players are obligated to change their play style to suit you tbh
---
&gt;Plague is only good if the Survivors are bad, just like with every other Killer in this godforsaken game.
---
That just proves that you're spewing out your mouth and not really making any sense. "Just like every other killer".... really let that sink in. You're not saying *Plague* is under-powered, you're saying the *Killer* is, which is false. The Killer has way more to juggle, sure, but it also suffers way fewer consequences for its mistakes.
---
There's plenty of fun to be had in the game, and I think anyone should play any killer/survivor that they please. You haven't even made a single valid argument towards her anyways. I personally wish I saw her more often as well.
---
No you are dont funny shit
---
invest time in nurse all chases end when your power comes off cooldown.
---
Vault the map. Slug the survivors. Extend the match. Benefit from lots of BP.
---
If you want to play those killers you can just de-rank and play against low rank survivors.
---
It‚Äôs a jump scare addon in a horror game lmao. Do you think scratched mirror Myers is also toxic?
---
I‚Äôm doing to adept the killers so I‚Äôll need to
---
Just goes to show how many killers rely on wall hack perks like BBQ&amp;Chili and Nurses to find survivors... blind. Also Hex: Broken more like it... Ruin is too strong, needs to be nerfed severely.
---
Also, I love how the killers always complain about SWF groups when a 4 man group is literally less than 5% of the overall type of match actually going on in the game.
---
The game is balanced for killers that go up against 4 man groups yet the player base is mostly solo players... hmmmmm, time to start nerfing killer perks me thinks.
---
Solo players are getting fucked, makes me understand why the game is no longer enjoyable.
---
Good job so far.
---
&gt;.&gt; with what they did to legion and their add-ons, I can only see him moving up to mid-low tier and less fun to play.
---
Hyperbole exists, pal. Obviously no one is saying that Nurse falls into that category. Hillbilly and Hag are also in Nurse tier, in terms of the fact that they can be actually proactive.
---
And I made plenty of valid points, she just keeps saying stupid shit like "Loops don't matter to Plague" and "Her slowing down so much doesn't effect her that much".
---
Yeah just run through the exact same loop any other killer has to run through
---
//shiver.
---
I mean considering you're kinda talking to her BF and future husband...
---
I'll be very surprised if you don't get banned soon.
---
It's because you probably made the killer upset and instead of downing the meg that unsafe unhooked you. They thought... I don't want this survivor to live any longer. They made my experience unfun.
---
Also DS seems like it would be a good choice for you.
---
I love it.
---
I just kill'em and leave you got salt take it with you.
---
i didnt even say anything salty. i just said you stole it so the quality is shit. are you good my dude
---
Some people don't wanna fling around like a rubber band every step they take. I'm not playing if the ping is 200+. 
---
Also, the average wait time for a lobby for a rank 7 killer in the US region on PC is 5 minutes, with 12 minutes being on the highest end. Stop exaggerating.
---
if you don't have ruin I would get hag. Then play nurse those other killers can't vault the map.
---
I feel they're going to ruin freddy. And I'll lose my main.
---
I'm playing survivor for the queue times during the event. I'd question my sanity if I mained solo survivor. If it's not an insta-saw Billy, it's a fucking unnerving presence/distressing Doctor. And you'd think Kindred would lead to greater awareness amongst teammates, but I still get left on the hook until second state even when I run Kindred.
---
I would just de-rank and go against potato survivors. There isn't a bonus to facing higher ranked players. I'd rather have people that panick and run when they are in terror radius than someone who is intelligent enough to hide and focus on objectives.
---
Survivors doing their job makes you have to work harder. Certain killers aren't good at applying map pressure. I love nurse because you can safely down someone and then go to the other side of the map run the survivors off then teleport back to the downed body. "Sorry for ignoring you. Those kids were doing those gens."
---
Ok thanks
---
I hate when I play survivor and wait to make sure everyone is getting out, so I‚Äôll leave when everyone is at the gates and while I‚Äôm waiting to check out the killers build I spectate to see they are standing there teabagging **absolutely fucking nothing**. No heartbeat, no sign of the killer, nothing. Just teabagging the air waiting for the killer to show up who never will.
---
Oh my god, F for the poor guy on Ormond
---
If practically every other killer is ‚Äúadd-on dependent‚Äù except nurse, then that says a lot about killer‚Äôs power, or am I misunderstanding something being said?
---
I ain't your pal, bud.
---
And I totally understand what you mean by that, however I disagree about your statements towards OP's comments. I think they were really valid and made a lot of sense, personally, but I respect your differing opinion.
---
Nothing wrong with having your own opinion on the matter and avoiding the killer, but it doesn't mean you have to act like everyone else should share the same view as you on it.
---
You know something? I completely hate playing Hillbilly. When I play him, I think to myself "Wow, this really sucks. He's no fun to be at all and it feels like he wastes so much time in chases". I certainly don't *have* to play as him, and I still have fun playing the game when I play as him. He's just not my preference at all. You won't see me saying "Imagine playing Hillbilly" anywhere on here though, because I know that's *my* opinion and there are plenty of people who really enjoy being him. In other words: I understand that, just because I'm bad at a killer, doesn't mean others shouldn't play it.
---
Exactly, cannot wait to alt-tab and not have to walk of shame to both fuckin exits every match.
---
The ones I think are impossible? If so the nurse because by the time you blink at someone you can't really move the analog fast enough to find them even with max sensitivity, and the huntress becomes a little more difficult as well not to the degree of the nurse, but still worse non-the less
---
Bill: P I L L S H E R E
---
Alright, I never experience this, so my bad I guess. I don't really sit at gates unless someone else is alive and might need help, and I don't really want to risk Blood Warden. Even as a killer main, I just rarely experience this, maybe 1/20 games.
---
Did you mean everybody when you said someone?
---
But is her ass okay thats the real question
---
That's usually the reaction I get when I destroy people with Hag lol. The add-on that makes her phantasms solid objects seems to be the biggest trigger.
---
I mean anybody in general; I honestly believed I made a grammar mistake here that my mind was too stupid to compute it.
---
I‚Äôd say monto is in the middle. He plays both survivor and killer, does meme and sweaty builds and is not toxic but is not too friendly
---
well that‚Äôs shamefully toxic.
---
Hollywood Undead is my least favorite killer to play against lol
---
Not because of how often I die, just because he's annoying to me. It's always cool to see the variety of killers at least though.
---
I call it Pig Tree, but looking at it closer, I think those are cows lol
---
If you play on PC I'll add you, it's a lot more fun when you play with friends :3
---
yes because it‚Äôs very reasonable to have ~7 minute games, and even less if you have more than one person working on any gen at a time, definitely reasonable, especially on those pesky killers that require set up or have a weak starting game
---
Yeah and that does What again if I‚Äôm not being chased?
---
Don't play like a fucking asshole and you wouldn't have to worry about it?
---
For a hook simulator game
---
fukkk she‚Äôs buff üòçü§§
---
I‚Äôd kill for David‚Äôs. I love him so much lol
---
Because this game is trash, and the developers would rather release DLC and skins than work on the blatant issues that exist.
---
//killers dc as well buddy. it happens on both sides.
---
Poor little rank 15's üòÇ
---
But Jeff has an anti-anti-stealth perk, so it works.
---
*cough*
---
Suggestions then?
---
Since otherwise I‚Äôm still in favor of Exposed.
---
I want the Jeff sweater
---
Watched the whole video, Very informative and helped a lot.   
---
Thanks
---
It's Chaser is what it is
---
I think they mostly just married random celebrities and enjoyed no longer being locked up in the Disney Vault like an old VHS reissue of Fox and the Hound
---
Fair enough
---
I think we've done a pretty good job so far
---
She prolly had wglf. Just use ds bro. Helps me alot against shitty teammates and douchey killers
---
It‚Äôs pretty fun when they think you actually care and they will wait for hours lmao. I love when I‚Äôm clown and I farm bottle throw points.
---
(proceeds to equip mori and ultra rare addons)
---
Scarred hand
---
think we did a pretty good job so far
---
My one request is that you rename supercharge to √úBERCHARGE
---
A Daddy Myers in the window with Binoculars.
---
Most of you survivors need to understand that just because the killer kills you when most of your team DC doesn't mean he is tryharding. Not all killers you run into want to stay in the match for 15 minutes doing boring farming, even if it's 2x bloodpoints. They just want to find you, kill you and hook you and move on to the next match and actually play the game.
---
You said you wouldn‚Äôt respond to these comments though
---
Recently, I got one on the upper floor of the temple where there's no reason to go up to
---
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm getting em in while I still can
---
They might have not connected? I find that‚Äôs happened a few times as killer.
---
Same, I was getting a bit salty last night for the same reason. 
---
I'm trying to use my streamers on my survivors as I used up most of them on my killers already and I was leaving matches with 5k points or less.  I even had several games where two people DC'd and the Killer wouldn't even give us a chance to get SOME points and it just became super frustrating after the 5th game in a row of 5k or less points. 
---
And I don't care if I die, I expect that to be the outcome 100% of the time, but it would be nice to have a bit of a chance to benefit from the event, especially after multi DC's in the same game. 
---
Then I swap back to killer and leave the match with 30k without even farming, just letting games play out as long as possible. But of course I have no good offerings to go with em anymore.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd be down with it. Maybe make the Survivor draw a symbol in the ground kinda like the hag while performing the action.
---
Heaven knows I could use a lot more of this
---
That was *Juicy*
---
Rin was in uni before she died but go off
---
Are they all unplugged icons?
---
Most. Cancerous. Cunt. Ever.
---
So is MoM, adrenaline, DS, and borrowed time
---
Nobody:
---
Plague:  RRROOOA!
---
I feel like this needs more content for uh the first message
---
Yeah.
---
Where did you explain yourself? 
---
Literally the only thing I can see is you diverting to ‚ÄòGo to this specific Discord, which clearly has people that agree with my train of thought‚Äô.
---
Lol. I don't think that's a thing in any game yet.
---
You don't actually. If you restart your game, your pip will be there. It catches back up after a few matches or show if you don't relog.
---
Mrs Jane... I dont feel so good
---
I was playing Myers with tombstone piece
---
Fuck off you condescending asshole
---
You're acting like you've already won after that final generator pops. That the killer has "failed" if all the generators have been repair. That the killer sucks if the game has reached that point.
---
So you tell me, why do you consider the game over and a failure on the killer's part if all the generators are repaired? Especially when BHVR has indicated over and over that the end game should be considered it's own portion of the match?
---
If you‚Äôre asking if they affect each other, no. They do however go really well together on doc
---

---
The timer starts when the gate is open iirc. 
---
Besides running to the gate there isn‚Äôt much the survivors could ‚Äústill be doing‚Äù. 
---
Besides maybe getting an item for a daily or saving another survivor (which increases the timer) so ... idk, I‚Äôm not seeing a good excuse to hide the scratches.
---
Moment of Silence for boy here. He is the RNG Gods problem now.
---
Agreed üòÇ
---
Sike! You thought!
---
I love how this meme pretends that every Bloodhunt SWF group doesn't have a double battery flashlight looper and the heaux he is with aren't all using BNP. \*eyeroll\*
---
This post made me laugh so hard whikst drinking that I blew water out of my nose...
---
I'd swap Ruin for Overcharge and you have my bread n' butter doctor build perk-wise. I only replaced BBQ with Ruin when I use a Jigsaw piece just to be extra annoying although if I had Huntress Lullaby I'd use that instead.
---
Huntress. It‚Äôs easy to figure out how to punish Survivors who Pallet/Window in their animation with hachets.
---
But getting long-range hits with those Hatchets takes a loooooing time to get really good at.
---
Thanks. I didn't want to sleep tonight anyways.
---
I have been playing this game since the first of year 2 and been watching it on twitch since vanilla days before nurse, in my experience this never happened before they "fixed vaults" and implemented the medium vault, it wasn't lag that caused this! It happens every time I vault a window while the killer is close, if it was lag than that is some very consistent and specific lag that occurs 100% of the time, or in other words, bullshit! Vaulting is broken and the hitboxes stick around the vaulted item for seconds after the vault occured!
---
You‚Äôre disgusting! How could you not post that and send it
---
Video link: [video](https://youtu.be/LNc9MVn2_mo)
---
oh god. what have you done...
---
I see someting even more disgusting. Bamboozle on Hag.
---
i would like to see you play against it :)
---
What?
---
The only build I really use is Self-Care, Botany Knowledge, Empathy, and Dark Sense. Know where your hurt friends are, know which way the killer is going, and heal as many people as you can.
---
I‚Äôve played against it a few times. It‚Äôs not all that common since it‚Äôs a very rare addon. You‚Äôre always on edge but that makes the game more fun. The jump scares are actual jump scares against the spirit so it‚Äôs more enjoyable, even if you don‚Äôt win.
---
Self care
---
Borrowed time
---
Spine chill
---
Empathy
---
Those are my picks for what you should be using but I highly recommend you get some other characters leveled up :p
---
this trapper looks like he smoked PCP out of a lightbulb and i love it.
---
To derank, I get it. Good one.
---
Git gud
---
Just Claudette's default perks and general default perks? If you're on console you'll have Bill's perk by default so if on console I'd recommend Self Care, Botany Knowledge, Borrowed Time, and maybe Resilience? Pretty much whatever 4th perk would work and honestly Resilience is the only one coming to mind.
---
If you're going to run Self Care you need Botany Knowledge with it. Don't spend 32 seconds in a corner rubbing yourself.
---
If you had read my post, you would know I said it‚Äôs okay to not want to farm - just don‚Äôt be an asshole. 
---
If being an asshole is your play style, that is incredibly unfortunate that one would take pleasure in being so unpleasant of a person.
---
i was hoping this was going to say the bunny cosmetic...
---
I used to place 1 trap at the hook every time I got a survivor. Now I pretty much only place them by windows or random places.
---
so you chose to play Nea i don't see the problem
---
Yee, but arseholes exist, throwing streamers at them won't sooth their spirits lmao; I get your frustration though
---
Reminds me of Iron Legacy in Sentinels Of The Multiverse (Legacy's mirror universe evil version) as his abilities had similar names to the Good Legacy.

Demoralizing Presence ‚Üî Inspiring Presence.

Galvanized ‚Üî Galvanize (Legacy's Base Power)

Anyways I love the perks. I'd love to see what each killer's powers are.

Gotta cover the names bro!

Hold up

XDXD get it XD it's a character from a media property XD VOMITTING XD like PLAGUE does XD
---
Imagine thinking addons are toxic.

Is it me or is the "hide the face" feature bugged right now? It's not working at all for me and it's kinda annoying.
---
Tapp water üí¶

Thank fuck, i play killer and switch to survivor when im sick of getting told to kill myself and getting tbagged.
---
I was in a game today with my mates against a nurse and we all ran streamers trying to farm and  yet the nurse still sweat her ass off and proximity camped hooked survivors
---
man I need to fucking watch this show I absolutely love Bruce Campbell
---
what does playing like an asshole mean? 
---
coming from survivor main btw*
---
I‚Äôd just dc
---
Just hang in there mate:( once the 2x is over all the fuckheads go away and you get us decent  killers back again.
---
I need this to happen.
---
Well if you dont they say gg ez
---
No.
---
Putting a machine to sleep?
---
120% is a lot and you‚Äôre complaining about him being a trapless trapper, he‚Äôs gonna be a trapless trapper fast as fuck, still lame
---
I feel the same man.
---
I'm asking if Unnerving Presence shortens Overcharge skill checks.
---
Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. It‚Äôs super disrespectful to the artist
---
No Mither + Self Care. Nice
---
That's cute too!
---
Bit of a scumbag, bit of an idiot
---
Yeah because it's the killer's fault that BHVR's shit game kicked 1 player, and your shithead teammates ragequit.
---
I mean, I said that Hex Ruin wasn't the only crutch. It's interesting though that your crutch perks examples were all survivor perks. As if killers don't have crutch perks.
---
I decided today that I'm giving up on Devour Hope. It never lasts past 3 unhooks for me, so why bother? :'(
---
I‚Äôve been in this situation, let the hatch to the survivor
---
The dumbass did all five gens before opening the gate
---
I wasn‚Äôt even aware that such a feature was implemented, but I would say to just wait until it gets fixed, or maybe making a forum post about it.
---
I got dicked on by a SWF earlier in the corn. Just so hard to track people on console if you‚Äôre not a tall killer

I‚Äôm only calling it meat tree from now onüòÇ

Binge watching it rn worth the watch, it‚Äôs on Netflix if you have it

My point is obviously above your head, the devs encouraging toxicity by implementing these add-on's in the game is what is truly toxic! Maybe you can understand my point now that I specified in my opening comment, or maybe not....
---
# oh no
---
***Hol' up-***
---
It used to hide your character so you could see behind you but I guess it broke in one of the recent patches.
---
I haven't played on the PTB but I wonder if it's fixed there.
---
Survivors are never satisfied.
---
Most of them DC immediately
---
They DC on me with Nurse. I don't know who I should play. Wraith. Would that make them happy?
---
That's intentional. They're designed to get you to experience the other 50% of the game.
---
How do you prestige anyway? Pls I want to know
---
I'm high on believing in that name!
---
No you use whatever perks you want. You clearly worked for them anyway.
---
You come try playing a 5th survivor. That way it's a 5v0. Then again they'd still probably complain.
---
....
---
This is absolutely pathetic, it's always someone else's fault if you loose, that's the mentality of PVP online games in general, outside of Dead by Daylight, if these survivors think what you're doing are hacks when in reality it's a goddamn HANDICAP (even aura reading since your killers power is restricted and that's to compensate for it.) to Micheal goes to show these survivors know nothing about now good a killer is, I kinda wish they had a bad matchmaking and go against a red rank killer that's ether a nurse or Hillbilly that will give them a good beating if they think those are hacks.
---
If I was a survivor in your match at that time I would've defended you man, I'm one of the very few players there that actually would give you a simple GG, even if I get sacrificed, cause I'm not going to waste your time shit talking to you for doing something you're suppose to do as a killer. With the only thing worse coming out from me is constructive criticism if you were facecamping or even camping in gereral, other than that I'm fine.
---
This is also why I stopped caring about skill and how I played, my usual response to these survivors who say I have no skill is "If you want skill you need to go to CoD or Fortnite" because at least with those games you can show off how good you are, I wish there was end game chat in console so I can hear what survivors have to say after a match, I'm tired of people sending me friend requests just to shit talk to me.
---
I was grinding for Hex Ruins teachable and was taking any perks I could get (I don't own the staple hag perks like MYC or Haunted Ground as teachables)
---
Yeah when I went for it my rank went down the toilet as did my sanity. Even before the ranking changes it wouldn‚Äôt always give you the trophy. I can only pray for people who couldn‚Äôt get it before the update.

i hate that because of the dog's white fur and big blue eye, my first thought was sans :(
---
But when it is fun again it won't be double bloodpoints
---
If its not fun now, chances are it wont be fun again
---
She's fun to play against and play as.
---
It‚Äôs ashamed the killer did nothing. I would have went after that fuck
---
Looks solid my dude. Thats pretty OP build.
---
Welp, that's false.
---
I play Freddy a lot, but 120% base speed would just be unfair, with him and some of his addons.
---
You havent played freddy enough yeah he is weak compared to billy and nurse. But if used right can get the job done.
---
Oh shot watch out, you cant go posting a screenshot of a bug, the devs might ban you.
---
I mean that's untrue for me, things are fun for me every couple days and then I lose interest lol
---
I think Nurse is fine, but I'm 100% on Trapper and Wraith.  
---
Like, maybe the trapper could snap a trap shut on someone's neck or something?  
---
Idk for the Wraith tho, he grabs their head as a bell and bing bongs em to death
---
I did the same thing with all my killers. Feeling the pain of it now being without a good build for anyone, but at least I have BBQ 1 on everyone right?
---
Oh really ? Interesting lol. Good for you
---
Gonna get down-voted but I'm salty so fuck it. I'm gonna continue to DC for as long as the loading screen eats my party streamers. So, if all goes well, I'll stop DCing on Tuesday.
---
You escaped....ok...
---
Honestly I‚Äôm Arnie 2 for both.
---
Find her overtly frustrating and annoying to play as and can‚Äôt for the life of me escape when playing against her.
---
In what world is teabagging an indicator of wanting mercy?
---
Lol I don‚Äôt dislike gay people(I accely like them) I just find it fun of a community can build up a gay relationship between characters that has no dialogue with each other. To me I find it funny and that is dissent really make sense. I don‚Äôt dislike gay people it is just a meme
---
I'm rank 12, and I can think of one time in about 200 hours that the crows helped me find someone without Spies from shadows. Maybe higher ranks use it more?
---
#monto
---
Well if you play an M1 killer they‚Äôll end the game in 5 minutes and you‚Äôll get tbagged at exit gate, so you have a few options.
---
Solidarity and no mither?
---
Derank?  What the fuck is that?  It's to create kahntent.
---
There's a reason my rule is that Claudettes get tunnelled and facecamped.
---
Yeah, thats why i pretty much became a killer main for now. You dont suffer that much from a dc like playing survivor. Also you can get ez more bp with bbq
---
good thing they don't want to do spider killer for now xD
---
it's either 0 kills or getting kills because players don't try since youre a killer they dont like or cuz dcs
---
on the 3rd hook, slug them. When everyones slugged, make one of them wiggle out. It'll show them you have the power to kill them if they don't listen.
---
The biggest help is to take off the iri head...
---
That's a good point
---
Is that The Plague in Feng Min's clothing or Feng Min with the plague?
---
AS broken as people may think it is it's a perk that lets you down anyone in one hit and gives you a speed boost. I'd be worried if people don't use it.
---
This. An 'easy game' is one where you get a 2-3k before they power 3 gens.
---
So only ebony billy and tombstone mike gotcha.
---
This guy is honestly complaining about fucking mettle of man...
---
It's really underrated imho. Cuts down on what immersed survivors can get away with and prevents survivors holding the game hostage
---
The first perk I don‚Äôt get. What‚Äôs the point of the action speed reduction? If they‚Äôre close to you to do stuns, they will only be running away really, unless they are finishing the last gen and it‚Äôs almost done and they have adrenaline, which is rare occurrence and won‚Äôt ‚Äúreally‚Äù affect it
---
The second one seems way too powerful for the mid game, especially since it‚Äôs a blanket setback for the primary goal of survivors simply for the killer doing what (s)he is supposed to do
---
The third is just old tinkerer. Which gets complicated to balance for the myriad of perks we have now. And honestly, a perk that is numbering buffing other perks is a very boring thing, doesn‚Äôt add any flavor to a build. All it really is, is ‚Äúdo stuff better the whole game‚Äù
---
Im pretty much a Trapper main. Nurse is still babe but honestly not that fun as Trapper. There is just so much shit you can do, you can play normal trapper with trapperbag and fastening tools, yoi can play basement Trapper and have a basementparty (underrated built) or the tryhard ultra rear add-on Trapper. BESIDES THAT, He has hands down the best cosmetics in the game. Just got done p3 lvl 50 him, now i only need the perks
---
I play both sides, but a little more killer.  
---
Alright, firstly, spot on for the ideas, The Reaper sounds like a cool killer to play/play against, unsure of exactly what his power does. Would holding m2 near a survivor give him the speed boost or something?  
---
The killer perks are busted. I get this killer is slow af, but bare in mind these perks could go to all the killers eventually, so imagine a Trapper or windstorm Wraith knowing exactly where someone is and being able to down them straight away. Exposing survivors is really strong, and knowing their location is stronger, and combining both of those is ridiculous.  
---
Dreading Dead could be more balanced if it gave you a notification if someone entered the area instead of revealing their aura,  or if it revealed the aura for a few seconds instead of 30.  
---
Death threat is Dreading dead(already very/too strong of a perk) but even stronger. It has a stronger tracking effect than BBQ+Chilli, which is one of the best killer perks, and exposes everyone, making a rescue borderline impossible for solo queues and stupidly hard even for a 4 SWF, because the killer now knows where everyone is, for the duration of the obsession being hooked. They could simply hook the obsession, slug the other survivors, and hook them one by one, game over. The only counter to it would be for the obsession to kill themself on the hook, and if a perk can just straight up make someone die, it is way too powerful.
---
Stolen terror seems alright, being able to help the killer get momentum. It might encourage tunneling, but that's dependent on the player. It's not as strong as the other two, but it is still very strong.  
---
By the way, the killer's power being a speed boost is also very strong. This killer would be fun to play as, but no one would want to play against it. If it ran it's 3 perks with Ruin, games would be over in minutes. Perhaps if the perks were Hexes, so at least there was some counter play to it, it could work, but even then they are very strong. Other killer perks that expose people have counter play, ie, Devour hope is on a hex totem that can be cleansed, Make your choice requires you to be far away and gives the survivors a chance to run/hide, Noed can be cleansed throughout the match or in late game.  
---
The survivor perks are also strong, some being combinations of other perks, and I've already ranted longer than most people are willing to read, so I'll be quick.  
---
Build up is No mither, Adrenaline and Flip flop, combined and better. The killer would need iron grasp and/or agitation to have a hope of hooking anyone with that perk. users could just move away from hooks when they're about to go down and they will break free almost every time.  
---
Team together is Aftercare, and would have the ever love shit abused out of it by SWF. If one person ran OoO, eventually all the survivors could know the killer's location for almost the whole match.  
---
Challenging rewards is good. I like it. It's not too strong or weak, and is a nice counter to Ruin, a perk that is in most games.  
---
You were sharing your thoughts, or your friends, and I'm sharing mine, this is my opinion so you can take this all however you want. Apologies for coming off as a nit-picky nerd.
---
Rant over.
---
Wait just curious, how can you check who the killer is?
---
You mean Saw 1 -_____-, and its lame for this game.
---
I mean the cypress mori is by far the fairest mori if the other person was hooked and you were caught and downed I doubt you were getting away anyway so why not let the killer get his mori daily done? Sounds like you just don‚Äôt
---
*myers
---
The perks to keep an eye out for are Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse, BBQ &amp; Chill and Bamboozle, perhaps Spirit Fury. These is what you put on a good Shape to keep that good Shape in good Shape.
---
That was boring as shit
---
I want Jeff's!
---
Nah, spiders are on a whole different level than clowns, I don't think they'd ever put spiders into it.
---
Then people who got disconnected by accident (internet drops, PC crash etc.) will be punished too.
---
That doesn't stop them from saying "Oh they even have noed, gg no skill noed user" after said 3k.
---
They can tell the difference the devs said they could.
---
I have a P3 Nurse and all her teachables and everything, just looking for perks from the licensed killers. Nurse's Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bamboozle, and Spirit Fury are all things that I can just get by spending my shards on the actual killers themselves rather than waiting for the shrine to have them. I also don't actually play the Shape often, I was just mentioning the fact that I have him so that he would be excluded from the equation.
---
You're the second person to suggest BBQ &amp; Chili though, so I'm definitely taking note of that.
---
These aren't engravings, they are the entity's burns, similar to the legacy outfits and the burns on the two asylum maps (main buildings)
---
She said in I think the last episode of Coven and then again in Apocalypse
---
Normally I don't like it when subreddits have a circlejerk, but I honestly and unironically think a DbD community circlejerk day would be very healthy.

I brought an ebony last night. Only because it was my only Mori, and I had a ritual to Mori a survivor.

Balanced Landing

---
Did you..... delete your last comment?
---
the game emblems don't show decimals, so it's 99.something%
---
feels bad man, happens to me everyday but it doesn't matter because I'm already rank 1
---
I usually opt for dead hard but balanced is also good, especially since there's usually a way to proc it.
---
I prefer Lithe to the others because I don't have to find an elevated area to activate it
---
I‚Äôm a huge fan of balanced landing. The speed boost is good, but the not getting staggered from a fall can be incredibly helpful in a chase.
---
Darn I‚Äôm ashamed
---
Yeah I made a spelling mistake and hit the extra menu by accident and just went with it
---
Adrenaline
---
Sprint Burst
---
Dead Hard
---
Lithe
---
Head On
---
in that order
---
Fair enough lol. I was just about to reply to it. Thought I fucked something up.
---
Facecamping with gens up, proxycamping with the intent to hard tunnel off hook, hard tunneling directly off hook into mori, exploiting (Infinite Mending Legion), Bleeding out a final survivor just to do it, waiting to pick up survivors for 30 seconds so you can shake your head, nod your head, or other unnecessary BM, ragequitting because a game isn't going your way especially if streamers were played, slugging in a 2 man load in game lol.  
---
I play a lot of both sides and would say all of that is pretty asshole behavior from killers.  (Survivors aren't the only ones that are toxic).
---
I ones had all 3 survivors ran around the hook so I hit them all down and the game said I hat 0 for chaser because the points in chaser were equal to the -points for staying at the hook.
---
I would recommend not tunneling survivors, even when they get farmed in front of you, that'll fix the whole Decisive Strike / borrowed time issue.  
---
Always go for the other survivor that went for the save.
---
Sounds like a loser mentality to me
---
Regardless of the downvotes you're kind if correct to a point though there is a subset of entitled toxic af survivors that will cast salt at killers for simply existing post game.  I do play killer in a manner that doesn't involve camps or tunnels and generally expect a positive message if I'm contacted at all post game.  A lot of killers that receive constant salt probably are playing in a manner that may be drawing that type of a response out.
---
oh.
---
&gt;DS buff
---
Yup, that's how we know you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I agree with you, I find the nurse difficult as well. Huntress not so much but I never play nurse because of that. It‚Äôs not that those killers are impossible, it‚Äôs that I find the nurse is much more difficult to handle while blinking on ps4.
---
I just get their attention and point at a hook if I feel like they deserve the 4k.
---
would be cool if they made it like titanfall 2 that each club can select an hour and in that hour its the clubs bloodhunt. you wouldnt have to do it daily but maybe weekly if the devs think an hour a day is too much.
---
This is exactly the reason why I run discordance on plague
---
it's usually a toxic two - three mans with filler
---
If those extras know know that they're grouped by the way they're playing the fillers can easily fold into the group

---
Plague? Is that you?
---
It is what it is.
---
Nice. I've been using the BPs I'm getting to unlock more perks with my P3 Michael and to level up Doctor to P3.
---
I like that EGC is going to be a good notice of when a gate is open. No more patrolling between gates and keeping an eye on the hook just to know if a gate is open.
---
Also just because someone runs a perk you hate... does not make them toxic. Nor does it make them entitled (and yes i have seen people call others BOTH toxic and entitled solely cuz of ONE of their perks).
---
[Tfw you only have 2 gens left but the game ends, because the last two survivors got hatch via key](https://imgur.com/gallery/6rKBG).

And then it all ended when the BBQ and chilli attacked
---
Why is it a steam guide
---
Nea's true form
---
I think he's talking about ds stun was increased from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.
---
I wish the left was more true for my case. I am red-purple ranks right now and it is just full of tunnelers.
---
Always Mori:
---
Twitch streamers (Not based and redpilled youtube streamers such as myself.)
---
Girl gamers.
---
Trannies
---
Homos
---
Furries
---
And any of the above orbiters.
---
It would be nice if the devs would take a long moment to consider how to alter the game itself to provide a less infuriating experience for both sides.
---
They increased the stun mate from 3 to 5 seconds because if you had enduring, the stun was non existing and it didn't benefit the survivor at all.
---
I mean it's fair imo
---
You see what you gotta do is run deliverance and DS so you can unhook in front of the killer and then when he inevitably catches you, ds off his back. The ultimate meme build
---
That was to accommodate enduring reducing DS to a 1 second head start on a chase, besides if you don‚Äôt tunnel them chances are DS won‚Äôt be a problem most of the time. DS is still greatly nerfed compared to what it was.
---
ü§°^
---
Oh yeah true but I bet his/her point of the recent "buff"
---
I always use make you choice so chasing after the hooked one is a bad strat for me.
---
Mettle of Man requires you to get hit 3 times before it can even be used lmao
---
And that "buff" to DS was to balance it from its heavy nerf where it was borderline useless.
---
No point in using a mori when they're going to die on hook anyway. The time it takes to walk to a  hook is probably on average the same as a mori.
---
The thing is we get shamed on both sides for using perks. Crutch perk is a big one. I think all perks are crutches. As in we equipped them so yeah I'm relying on using them. That's the entire point. Also If I didnt have them yeah I'd still survive it would just be harder.

I ran it for a while to get the hook breaking achievement, and it really doesn‚Äôt do much. There are too many hooks on every map to be worth it, and seeing the killer‚Äôs aura doesn‚Äôt help you out much either.
---
Lol. This is the most awful luck. I hate when bad ping killers do that. I know they have to know it's up they just take advantage like they are good.
---
Well seeing as i have had an affect on you that would be enough. I feel like youre upset friend tell me who hurt you?
---
Haha i deserved to die ik

The dwight stayed like that from when the map loaded, all the way to the end results screen.

It‚Äôs amazing how many people play this game and lack the skill in general to play it

Play a different game

I dont really care. Just know you aren't contributing anything meaningful to society so essentially you are worthless. Have a good one. And I ain't your friend, buddy.

No

I've actually seen someone call a survivor toxic and say they were entitled because they used mettle of man... but most of the time i see people on BOTH sides call the other side toxic and accuse them of thinking they are "entitled for a free win", they themselves are being entitled and toxic

Pretty Good Job So Far, isn't it?
---
#1 is Hex: Ruin. Without it Myers will not have the time to tier up at the beginning of the game because his start of the game is super slow.
---
#2 Monitor and Abuse. Myers has the lowest terror radius in the game and this helps so you can catch survivors out of position and get an easy first hit or if you 99% your power a really fast instant down.
---
#3 and #4 enduring and spirit fury. You should never ever care about being stunned at a pallet. And meyer's biggest downfall is the fact that he will get looped pretty hard. This helps you deal with that a little bit.
---
It's nice to get perks like bbq for blood points but myers doesnt have enough map pressure to make it worth it. It does let you learn where survivors generally are to go chase though. Ideally you want to have an area of the map you protect while also chasing people and downing them. If you get a guy on the hook go pressure a gen by checking it. Now 2 guys are busy being on the hook and saving the guy on the hook. One is being chased. And another is doing a gen.
---
Only exceptions I can think for this is hooking 2 people really close to one another, in the basement? Or if you know survivors are near the hook who you can then chase.
---
I just hit lvl 100. Youd never guess it either if you are a half good killer.
---
What are you talking about reddit isnt about just nice comments. I said intially "you escaped" because its umimpressive. You started some weird defense for the OP who mind you can defend themselves. You cant be serious with how youre acting. Bruh...
---
girl you don't know about me, so get off my fuckin D
---
I'd like to inform you I dont care. Do you see how pointless this is? That's the moral of the discussion.
---
they didn't want to face the current one even before devs said Legion's getting reworked.
---
i wouldn't expect them to not DC when they probably saw/played against the new Legion.
---
Hey, sorry for necro, I've just found this after recently buying The Spirit and I feel like passive phasing increases is more useful than duration increase.
---
7.8/10 too much healing
---
yup, i made everything by myself, models and main render done with blender, substance painter and designer for textures, premiere pro for video render and after effects for post render effects.
---
Did you even watch your own video? I didn‚Äôt say you were toxic but you were 100% annoying.
---
Bruh...there is no moral the OP  is a troll, the guy who messaged me is a troll, im a troll and your one too! We're all trolls in this sub!
---
Playing solo survivor is basically a coin flip these days, either you get competent teammates who knows how to play, or you get total potatoes who might as well be replaced by monkeys who would likely contribute more than them.

I guess we need to "git Gud" rank ones get there somehow I suppose.

You can't just make 3 perks that make survivors exposed
---
First of all, thank you very much for the detailed feedback. I think I should have worded my title differently though, because none of this really has anything to do with what I wanted.
---
I mentioned that I already have the Shape because I wanted to take him out of the question all together, not because I play him. I *do* play him from time to time, so your advice is interesting and potentially helpful, but that's not why I made the post. I'm taking the approach of spending no money on the game at this point, so I'm asking about which killer perks I should get that belong to killers which I cannot unlock with shards. I cannot buy the Pig, Cannibal, or Nightmare with my shards, so the only hope I have of unlocking their perks is through the Shrine of Secrets. I'm looking for *licensed* killer perks besides the ones belonging to Michael Meyers, because I already bought him a long time ago and I own all his stuff.
---
I was trying to keep my post as short and concise as possible but it appears that I just didn't provide enough information, unfortunately. I was just hoping to find some help with deciding which perks to buy. I don't want to spend shards on perks that belong to a killer if I'm already going to buy said killer with shards. I will be buying every single killer that I can possibly buy with shards eventually.
---
Again, seriously thank you for the feedback, looks like this was my bad because I'm getting multiple comments with the same sort of suggestions; perk builds for Michael Meyers that largely don't even include the perks of licensed killers.
---
It looks great and impressive, but the only thing that made me think "Dead By Daylight" was the locker and the generator. You could easily tell me it's a trailer of something else and it'd have the same effect. It really could use more Dead By Daylight stuff.
---
Except the fact most killers who use this perk also uses ruin..
---
It is not toxic, you can just do gens asap, but when you do that then you just risk noed
---
And I gave my rebuttal that offended you because it included the truth.
---
Next time dont assume that the survivor was moried right off the hook. I hooked 3 of them 2 times so they had more than enough chances. Yea, I bet. You def go after the full health survivor who just tested you and unhooked a teammate without BT within killer radius instead of hitting his friend back on the ground doing and playing the game correctly. Lol, you are one of those two face people that say they do all these wonderful things in front of others and then behind the curtains you do the exact opposite...i.e. a fake. There is nothing "toxic" about playing the game correctly. Now please, try to counter this logic. I am waiting.
---
Imagine even caring about ranks in this game yikes

Do you want a reward?

i died at the Ace part

The idea of this project evolved so many times that it wouldn't even look similar if it was made again with day 1 plan, but you are actually right, it is not really 100% dbd content as i think about it right now, anyway i appriciate your time and thanks for your opinion.
---
I just came here because I was trying to find an old comment and I have to say you were an asshole.

locker grabs and pallet grabs or make them bleed out by slugging.

Something something Dwight something Nathan Prescott.

It‚Äôs not that‚Äôs just what people say when they are bad at the game

So your two ideas are:

‚Ä¢Rely on them to make an awful mistake

‚Ä¢Waste 4 minutes slugging

‚Ä¢Hope they jump into a locker

or, you know, dont use it? 
---
it takes you more time time to kill them with moris on last hook, gives you less points, and while beeing nicer than killing after first hook you still take away a little window other survivors could be using for a save (bodyblock, sabo or flashlight blind the deathhook)
---
I asked you to say the counters, since you said there were some. You had an awful attempt earlier. 
---
You then said there were other options, and you‚Äôre now telling me exposed perks? So just noed, a quite unreliable ‚Äúcounter‚Äù in MYC, and Rancor....
---
Rightttttt.
---
\+ instead of the mori you could use an offering that could give you additional points for nothing
---
Thank you so much! I cant wait to use them, happy hunting!
---
Art in its true form.
---
Don't built it at all. You're 16.
---
This happend to me yesterday with a ebony Mori :(
---
But fr tho killers should be the power role
---
Alright, I get that. Farming's bad, not everyone wants to do that, I should git gud instead of trying to cheat the system, blah blah blah. I understand.
---
But I'm only asking because I am literally the worst at this game. And that's not hyperbole; I've had game after game where I get almost no BPs.
---
I started a match once, and 30 seconds in, all four survivors had a generator up each. 60 seconds in, the fifth was done. 90 seconds, both gates were open, and survivors had left me in the dust.
---
I have worse aim than an Imperial Stormtrooper. I've swung and missed, even when they were right in front of me. And when I do land a hit, somehow, against all probablity, they get away, and are healed the second I lose track of them, leaving me earning Bleeding BPs in single digits.
---
Hex perks are worthless to me, because they always spawn in the open, with a survivor right next to them. I had Hex: Ruin, and 5 seconds after a game started, it got disabled.
---
I can't think how the survivors think, because I don't even know how ***I*** think. In-game, or in real life.
---
So yes. I get it. Farming is a well-deserved bannable offense. But when you're as bad as I am, what else can you do?
---
Look at it this way; immersed survivors will NEVER touch it, because it's right in the open where the killer can find them.
---
Because this community call everything they don't like toxic.
---
Enduring is already a questionable choice but Bamboozle? Now that‚Äôs interesting.
---
It was utterly broken before.
---
You regretting it make me wonder about your mindset.

2 times actually, and the 3rd one is then a free health state/invincibility frame for just being hit AKA rewarding failure.

You have nothing against cheesy mechanics like invincibility frames ?

Nothing to add then.

The Entity wants to know your location

Because tbagging is not enough
---
Many
---
Depends on the console or if you are on pc. Ps4 has a shit ton all hours day and night
---
SteamDB says there's 7,500,000 downloads on PC.
---
I'm a killer main, but every time I see it, I cant stop laughing.
---
Hi, I recently just tried to play a game with the pig but loaded into the game (with my pig add-ons/offerings but not my perks) and I was the cannibal instead of the pig? Usually I would just assume that I accidentally switched killers but I don't have the cannibal unlocked to switch to. What's up with that??
---
I vote for Balanced Landing too. Even if you're exhausted you still benefit from the quick recovery time when falling. It can be a real life saver, and on some maps you can have really strong loops thanks to it.
---
See you in 2020!
---
Because I know the future...
---
Did nea become the new claudette?
---
This is why I believe every killer/survivor main should try playing for the other side once in a while
---
This ^ it‚Äôs 2019 and the devs are still using Left for Dead 360 era gameplay it‚Äôs honestly disgusting especially since VR is the future. Time to let go of the ps3/360 era
---
currently 25k on steam and probably a similar number on console
---
I find it a bit rude to slug, then wait the entire time for someone to struggle. Might just be me, or I am sure there are others who find it probably the worst mori around. It basically is the let me slug someone mori, to ensure I get this kill. Perhaps if the killer had been less campy and tunnely, I would have been more inclined to be nice too. 
---
If as a survivor, a killer plays like an ass, I will play like an ass. If a survivor plays like an ass towards a killer, it is expected the killer will then play the same way. But, if a survivor plays the same way a killer does, then it is horrible. Even as a killer, I play how survivors play, and expect a survivor to play like an ass, if I do.
---
Well, a lot of bug fixes and dedicated servers would be a start. To prevent DCs you need to touch on the main issues that cause them. This is a buggy ass game, especially on PS4 in addition to the bad optimization. I know that's a hard thing to do, but asking them to add short bans when the game is in the state it's in is definitely not the answer
---
Really the only thing I can think of that can be done is to just make the game better. Sure there are lots of people who just get salty because they got outplayed and leave, but there are also tons of people who get fucked over by the game and are just tired of it. I'm just saying short bans would 100% mostly affect the innocent ones who didn't DC just because they were mad
---
Someone has had a bad Killer game, lol.
---
I'm glad SOMEONE is playing as the Plague. I have only played against her ONCE, but she was SO FUN and the killer seemed to enjoy the game, too
---
Honestly, what is EGC even gonna change? If there are survs still alive they will still wait to tbag u at the gate. Yes, there's a timer, but just waiting somewhere around the map for the timer to run out doesn't really make sense, it's just wasting time (and for what? just to not see them tbagging?)
---
confusion 100
---
I feel the need to point out that doing gens fast is probably the best idea against a legion. 
---
And as long as she got you of the hook before stage 2 it isn't that bad of an idea.
---
If she got you off insteadly the legion would just come back, put you both in mending and then probably tunnel you.
---
Honestly seems more like a crash. They were healing themselves originally, so surely they wanted to continue the game.
---
Charged the blink enough to leave the match.
---
Nurse*
---
This is probably why they haven't implemented a punishment system of some sort for dcing, the playerbase would be significantly lower with all the bugs. I guess we're going to have to face people dcing until the loading screen is fixed, also the random crashes. And that might take a long time.
---
LGBT
---
Let‚Äôs go break totems
---
This just proves you don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. 3 hits for it to activate, it activates in you‚Äôre 4th hit.
---
actually playing ebony mori nurse with noed for the bloodhunt. smh
---
There really isn't such a thing as Gen Rushing, since it's their only objective and if they sit on one generator for forever it means you didn't pressure them enough as a Killer.
---
Having said that, generators do get done too fast which is why Hex: Ruin is pretty much required on all but a handful of killers (Pig, Freddy, Nurse, and Billy are the only ones who can get away with not running it). Can't really blame that one on the Survivors though.
---
I'm on Xbox, and I'm not too great with her. 
---
But, I had a daily.
---
Is this lag switching?
---
Could we start by at least removing the leave match button?
---
I mean why is that even a thing? If you have to leave quickly due to IRL then you either stand up and let the game running or ALT F4 out. 
---
People having to restart the whole game would be better than putting them right to the join game button.
---
Guys I'm guessing most of you aren't asian. Believe me, Asia is hell. I'm probably the only killer that agrees to farm points and doesn't tryhard on 3v1 as well. When I played survivor during this event, apart from the camping/moris/tunnelling I've also tried to lure the killer into farming, using nicknames like "LETS FARM BP", just standing still pointing at the hook. No, asians are all fucking tryhard. They just sweat, they don't know fun. I'm telling you it's a trap right here to even try to shake the other's hand. Even survivors point your flashlights at you when it's 3v1 and you are clearly letting them escape/unhook safely,
---
Exactly, it'll definitely take a while and it'll suck, but I think once the game improves there will be a better solution down the road
---
You remind me of the Joker.
---
How is an objective ‚Äútoxic‚Äù please educate me 
---
People throw the word toxic around like it‚Äôs nothing
---
I'd rather be tunneled than never unhooked
---
You dont have fun you just do generators like stupid robot
---
Balanced Landing all the way.
---
You just get them faster is all. You dont get more like WGLF or BBQ&amp;chili
---
No I‚Äôm doing gens until the killer comes and pushes me off. If the killer doesn‚Äôt come by me what else am I suppose to do? 
---
Expect us to stand around and wait?  Like really I‚Äôm confused- I don‚Äôt get how doing a gen is toxic lmfaooo makes no sense.
---
just to be sure, what i meant was: It's a great trailer, but not a good DBD trailer
---
What does it do
---
Not necessarily just got bored and wanted to make some perks and thought I‚Äôd get everybody‚Äôs opinions but I also forgot this is Reddit
---
Yeah, once two days ago, and the first time was a few months back.
---
Ruin basically slows down your work on generators. When you start the match, both the Haunted Grounds Totem and Ruin Totem are lit up, which means it‚Äôs a 50/50 you will cleanse HG or Ruin.
---
Sounds right about the time it happened to me. If these BloodHunts are so rare and the grind is so long, and then I get this kind of bug, it makes me not want to put in so many hours anymore.
---
Is this on consoles?
---
Yeah, PS4
---
I don't know exact names but I use a kinda jumpscare build with silent bell, aura reading when invisible, thickened fog offering, devour hope, noed, bbq, and sloppy butcher.
---
Yeppp
---
If you send them a ticket they should refund you the Bloodpoints, might take them a day or so but they definitely will. I had an issue with BP on PS4 a few weeks ago and after sending a ticket it was refunded within 24 hours.
---
Ah; the console rank 1 post.
---
IMO: Yeah it should've been taken down, but taking it down after its already reached the FP is stupid, it accumulated over 350 upvotes and had an active conversation or two going inside it.
---
Why the hell does this happen when the solution is to just...Ya know; sort by new? The thread had cemented its place on the FP.
---
Also that language isn't good, "Uninteresting" It sounds more opinionated than factual.
---
When you down a survivor see an immersed claud in an unsafe area. Oh piece of candy.
---
Call of Duty: Advanced Wafare

I'll just write this after 20 games trying to play without dc and finding 13 nurse, i didn't count how many of them had 3 blinks but i saw 2 with 5 blinks which was really overkill, 4 legion which 3 of them had mixtape, 1 trapper and 2 pig.  Every nurse and legion had ruin, only trapper and 1 pig didn't. In 13 games at rank 1-4, only 1 guy got the hatch at one game, the rest of the games were 4k with 3-5 gens up. Vs legion he got 4k or some dcs, none of us escaped. One pig played well and got 4k, we 4 escaped the other game, same against trapper, all 4 escaped. The only weird thing is that i didn't find a single billy in these last 2 games which is weird for high ranks but i guess all the billy tryharders are playing nurse because it has higher bloodpoints/hour and grants you a dc at the start of a game which will leave you against 3 surv with 5 gens up and ruin up. Have fun playing against that without disconnecting.
---
People just don't get it and whoever says "you dc to nurse because you are bad, you can't loop, you boohoo" are just r\*\*\*\*\*\*s who have no clue about the game.
---
Statistics never lie and at rank 1-4, nurse will not be a baby nurse and will have the standard build which includes ruin.
---
Normally in a game, even if the 4 survivors are good loopers, nurse will get them because you know the drill with a nurse and "looping".
---
Even if the so called good loopers get first attention and can loop the nurse for a good 2 gen-time, the statistics says that most survivors cannot do a gen through ruin which leaves one survivor maybe trying to do a gen for more than double time while the others two go looking for ruin instantly after the first red check appears which they won't find soon enough because nurse will check ruin if it has a bad spawn and will start chasing whoever is close to it, leaving the rest of survivors "away" from it for a good 1-2 min.  
---
As soon as she get someone on hook, she will go for surv doing gens to interrupt it because bbq and now we have maybe 1 surv doing gens, 1 on hook, 1 on the way to unhook and maybe one still looking for ruin.  
---
The game will go on and for the first 2-3 min the nurse will check on each surv skills and as soon as she finds there is a good player or even two (which is never the case), in case she hasn't taken them down, she will ignore them knowing they probably won't do more than 1 gen and use the weakest surv as slug to lure more surv, as soon as she gets like 2 slugs, the pressure will not dissapear until she wins the game. 
---
Maybe someone broke the ruin early and your team got 2-3 gens done and one surv kept doing gens but you cannot counter the nurse pressure ever. 
---
I am talking about most rank1 games.
---
There is no win situation unless the killer is just terrible, like he just started playing nurse or have bad perks because nurse is really easy to master. Before level 50 you will be getting 4k games a lot and after 30-50 games you will be just unstoppable and that is why people dc.
---
All of this will happen most of the games. Sure you will escape one game out of twenty but that doesn't repair the fucking frustation you get playing over and over against nurse being slugged, camped and wasting your fucking time without the slightest hope of the game being fun. People forget how important is time and how bad it feels to waste it when all you can do is NOT HAVE FUN and maybe aim to a hatch escape because everyone else got killed.
---
It is worse than legion because against legion you can loop him and use mechanics that are meant for survivor to use while against nurse you can't LOS out or use a pallet or even vault because you are dead for good.
---
The day BHVR decides to punish disconnects before balancing the game i guess i will get a ban because i am not willing to be forced to play the game against some umbalanced shit that everyone sees as broken and NOT FUN to play against. What i don't understand is how they fucking touch legion which is only fucking annoying before even daring to destroy nurse which not only is annoyting to play against, it is ridiculously overpowered.
---
Yeah thanks man I dunno why like their was multiple conversations and people including me giving tips to other people imo the mod must have been biased but thought theirs should be more barriers in place before mode can just take down a post because they don‚Äôt like it.
---
Yeah that was it bro
---
I definitely did send in a ticket when I found out my BP was gone, so hopefully they get back to me on that soon.
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/381210
---
Yeah man, I think I'm calling it quits. 
---
I got banned for the weekend because I was toxic to a lagswitcher. The devs of this game are absolutely incompetent.
---
Haunted grounds activates when the totem is destroyed marking all survivors as exposed for a period of time (depends on the level of Haunted Grounds). What this means is the killer can down you with a single hit.
---
Actually 66/33 because there are two haunted grounds totems.
---
Seeing how 1 sided your post is and how much you sh*t on killers you were the one doing the shooting for me
---
Yeah that's the point. I'd bet that the rage quitter DC happens more often than someone actually getting stuck.

During Blood Hunt? Brave brave
---
It was probably a reference back to her most famous line in Coven.
---
I actually use it to look cheap. I wear the top and head with the black jorts. My friend wears the new Claudette top and head with the hot pants so we'll be hookers on a mission together. 
---
The outfit looks okay when combining the top and skirt with the light blonde version of the standard head cosmetic. 
---
My problem is that the outfits need actual high heels instead of those weird strappy sandals to make 'em look a little bit more chic.
---
Honestly? I've been using Trapper lately and with it, I use Padded traps and Tar Bottles so I can not only get that sweet 4k BP with Distressing, but also that sweet 1k for grabbing the survivor from the trap. Distressing on Doctor is great, but having it during the Double BP is sweet!
---
I agree. And glasses. just super big flannel shirt, David sized and glasses.
---
I... actually would like that idea since I almost never bring a map, but it would help out greatly when you stumble upon a Hex during chase for example.
---
How can survivors control the pace of the game? By "Gen rushing"?
---
Rank 15 survivors can "Gen rush" just as effectively as rank 1 survivors can, the only difference is how willing they are to power through ruin as opposed to hunting for it, but once Ruin is popped (which apparently happens in the first 30 seconds of every match) then it's exactly the same. Rank 16 or lower are a different story that I won't get into.
---
It's entirely on the killer to keep up pressure + make sure survivors are keeping busy.
---
Oh, I hate that so much. Like... Well, okay. Just trying to be nice, but sure.
---
"u farm because bad ez"
---
More bloodpoints = more Moris + strong addons, people just don't understand the concept of saving them till the event is over actually providing more bloodpoints overall.
---
There's been a ton of crashes lately, it's probably just the game
---
I always make sure I back out to the main menu, the little auto save icon flashes when I do, sucks to lose all that progress üëéüèª
---
The mods of this page have never answered a message from any of my accounts ü§∑
---
Thing is, I buy the games I want, rather than pay to get whatever crap they feel like dumping on me.
---
I‚Äôll be doing that from now on, just to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. And I‚Äôll also be taking screenshots too, in case I do decide to play for like six hours again, so they can see where I was before and after.
---
The bloodhunt deemed them worthy.
---
I'm awful with the nurse, but I finished my daily so I'm not complaining.
---
I wish you luck with it, hopefully you didn‚Äôt lose any good perks.
---
She's very good at preventing the game from progressing but if it hits the endgame then she's got practically nothing to aid her.
---
SANS DOG
---
So what‚Äôs the point in having mods if they‚Äôre biased, uncooperative and don‚Äôt acc support the sub
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt lose any perks, it‚Äôs just the BP I lost. I was only planning on going through the blood webs when I had one million BP. Course, I should have just spent it right away instead of leaving it for the next day, but I didn‚Äôt know the game would just delete all that progress I made.
---
How would you improve or balance them? This is a shit comment tbh
---
Matchmaking can sometimes make it seem no ones online, especially for swf. But just re-ready up a few times and you should be able to get in a match no problem.
---
Not sure about rank one (I stay away from it now). I used to have some issues getting into lobbies but again it could just be a matchmaking issue.
---
The DCs are out of control. It's so discouraging to be a survivor and see 2-3 teammates disconnect with four gens left, and at least last night killers were NOT wanting to farm. No fun. :(
---
the fact that all of those perks are "the strongest" yet you often don't get any use from any of them is what really hurts
---
That is why we need a tilt your head emote for the killer
---
I'VE FOUND TWO PURPLE KEYS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WITHOUT RUNNING ANY LOOTING PERKS &amp; I PRETTY MUCH ONLY OPEN CHESTS IF I STUMBLE ACROSS THEM ALREADY.
---
IN ONE MATCH THE KILLER DC'D AFTER THEIR DEVOUR BROKE &amp; IN THE OTHER, I RAN A KILLER FOR A SOLID FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES &amp; THE ONLY GEN THAT GOT DONE WAS THE ONE I'D DONE MYSELF, SO I DIED BEING UNABLE TO USE MY KEY. RIP KEY.
---
Oh of course
---
Maybe if the devs deleted legion plague and freddy people wpuldnt want to dc
---
I get my hopes up occasionally...
---
I tried running it for about a week and [this](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/56688/fix-head-on) has been my experience. It's buggy as fuck and there's no point using a perk, even for fun, if using it properly risks just dying because the perk decides to not go off and leave you incredibly vulnerable.
---
IIRC, the first batch (that included JenDenise) was just handpicked by the devs. The next round had an application with a strict set of rules (like that you can't have had any prior bans, which is why AngryPug isn't a Fog Whisperer,) and people were chosen from the applications.
---
That‚Äôs your own internet actually, happened to me before.
---
Yikes
---
Ridiculous isn‚Äôt it
---
I then used ‚Äòmod mail‚Äô to ask a question and i haven‚Äôt gotten a reply and many others say they have the same problem as me.
---
Sheesh. Wonder if the Mod was the guy who Downvoted this too
---
Or, and get this, you could follow the rules they have in place.
---
tbh they should just buff Bloodwarden to 2 minutes
---
Doesn't surprise. Some of the "mods" shouldn't even be moderating in general.
---
Feelsbadman
---
The rules they have set they decide only to follow when it benefits them man
---
I'll say
---
The process for flagging support posts is automated by a bot, it cannot read/understand the actual context of the post, which means it takes actions against any post that triggers the bot settings and filters.
---
If you modmail the team, we'll review the issue and act accordingly (read: restore falsely removed posts). Not getting a response from the modmail doesn't mean it got ignored; in some cases, the post has been approved manually but depending on the overall to do list, replying to every single modmail (in regards to simple approvals because of bot actions) is too time-consuming.
---
It's like a Charger whiffing. In theory (and sometimes in practice) really dangerous, but when you fuck up it's absolutely hilarious.
---
Yeep

Truth actually.

I've n e ve r seen it before.

It was a somewhat talked about but from around autumn last year that they said they patched I think!? I remember breaking a pallet as wraith and the game suddenly ending then too. Anyway it‚Äôs a rare but not new bug and idk how it happens
---
lag switch?
---
I often play SWF, and at least 1/5 games, every single one of our games crash. I dont know if SWF makes it more common, since it never happens solo, but it's most likely crashing

Play however you want and don't mind them, pallet looping is not toxic, nor will it ever be
---
I run self care on all survivors once its available bc going solo is kinda harsh. ive noticed many people dont heal me on purpose so i‚Äôm an easy target.
---
I'm not a big fan of farming, but if its double bloodpoints why wouldn't I? I want bloodpoints as much as the next person
---
Tbh, kindred seems to make more games fun as you don‚Äôt get left on the hook as much.
---
The best part is Feng looking away disappointed in Laurie for trying to taunt the killer.
---
I had one match where two people used BPS, and one match where I used BPS after an agreed farming with the killer via messaging.
---
But RNG basically hates me so my "hoard" of BPS atm equals 2 on Nea &amp; 1 on Feng Min, total, so I primarily wait to use them for either guaranteed farming matches or when I'm playing with friends.

Dead hard and borrowed time for sure, but self care? I get that swf is the boogie man but solo queue you almost have to run self care.
---
Bran is stalking you too
---
I'm serious as a killer main, run around without self care for a couple games. It doesn't work everytime cuz the survivors dont play to win but self care won't make your teammates do gens anyway.
---
Adrenaline. Only yesterday it popped right as a huntress swung at me after tunnelling for over half the game. I feel it would be disrespectful to stop using it now

My very first game of this blood hunt was a face camping Legion named ToxicBarbie. The little bitch thought it was hilarious, and her literal reason was because I looped her (just trying not to die) for 5 minutes and brought a cake. There was also a party streamers and she even brought a survivor pudding on the field and she did it to every single survivor. ‚ÄúOnly I‚Äôm allowed to get points, lmfao get good cry baby! Like omg your salt is gold haha!‚Äù
---
Meanwhile I threw at least 6 pallets on her, window juked the shit out of her and ultimately only went down because her Feral Frenzy hits finally depleted my bar enough for her to abuse the whole ‚Äòmake me lose terror radius and go down because I don‚Äôt have time to mend‚Äô asshole strat.
---
This, but with sprint burst and the little speed boost you get when you get hit.
---
Can‚Äôt find a match either. It‚Äôs frustrating
---
I hate when people say this. I‚Äôd like to play the game I fucking paid for. If I wanted to play something else I would have.
---
I had a 4 bps game where nurse slugged and one hooked everyone.
---
Dude, sucking at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.
---
I proclaim this canon
---
Of course it's a crutch. The game fucks over solo queue survivors this way and that, it makes sense for them to use a crutch.
---
I'd also like to point out you misrepresented what I said.
---
&gt;but in general self care is *borderline* needed
---
Like sure, I am capable of winning without it, but especially until you get back to rank 7 or so it provides that crutch to make it so you can get out of the shit ranks where your teammates are consistently hot garbage.
---
- BBQ &amp; Chili is a must, it's a Leatherface teachable &amp; the most valuable killer perk.
---
- Franklin's Demise (Leatherface teachable) is decent if you really hate people having items since it knocks items out of the survivor's hands &amp; damages them, removing charges.
---
- Make Your Choice (Pig teachable) is good for a lot of killers, but not for Mikey necessarily (since it's an insta-down perk &amp; Mikey already has an inherent insta-down.)
---
- Blood Warden (Freddy teachable) can be used really well on Myers, leads to some spooky moments at endgame if you get lucky.
---

---
I just played a game in which I unhooked a fellow survivor, the Freddy chased me long enough for 2 gens to finish, then face-camped me until the others were able to escape. Kept slashing at me while I was hanging there. I hope they got like, 6 bloodpoints total for that shit.

With Doc? Ruin away friend. Ruin is only not needed on killers with movement abilitys and nap pressure.
---
&gt;Me: Cleansing a lit Totem despite it **showing no ill effects**
---
Doctor is good for starting killers. It generates a crazy amount if blood points as well as is a salt magnet. Most survivors will not dare to taunt an experienced doctor. I saw your plight and decided to give you something that would combat it.
---
r/meirl gimmie gimmie 1000 BP.
---
Off topic once cleansed Haunted Grounds against a baby Spirit and she couldn't down me for the full duration of HG3.
---
I'm still looking for this totem
---
I take bond instead of self care and I dont think I will use self care ever again. It‚Äôs super easy to find people to heal you plus you can use it to take gens faster and find out where chases are, it just has so many uses
---
Bond
---
Tell that to Zombie. d:
---
I don't disagree with him that, if I had better generator pressure tools (Overcharge ~~if I wasn't Rank 7~~ and Distressing + Unnerving, mainly) I'd probably run them instead of Ruin. I'd certainly run them instead of Huntress' Lullaby though.
---
Nope not at all... lmaoooo.. I got a certain select few that enjoy playing with.. you must've not made the cut anyways.. if we only played once together..
---
Yes?
---
&gt;Like sure, I am capable of winning without it
---
Saying it's not required to win doesn't somehow argue against my point. A player is capable of winning without any perk, that doesn't mean that before rank 7 certain perks don't help remove the luck factor from the game so that you can get to the better ranks quicker.
---
I'm literally only playing killer because of the double bp right now. I'm starting to think it's not even worth playing killer anymore since you finally get into a game and it's a 3 man. Then the 3 other survivors say you're a tryhard for going all out on them and tell you to farm. I'd have to farm pretty much every game then since I rarely get a 4 man anymore.
---
Isnt it bugged like MoM ?
---
Good billies tend to not need addons, it depends on what you mean by charge time, one of them fine but both or instasaw is no skill trash
---
yea, exactly, but people still complain about those perks listed
---
BBQ - just get into a locker
---
Ruin - rank 5 complaining about it lul, git gut at skillchecks
---
Nurse's Calling - no one heals anymore and when they do, they do it outside of the killer's terror radius thanks to this perk being in the meta for so long
---
NOED - shouldn't get you more than one kill anyway and could be countered if people actually destroyed totems (sometimes it happens)
---
I myself can't live without Enduring
---
With the devs in total denial at the state of the game I would agree. It‚Äôs not worth it anymore. As much as I love this game, it‚Äôs just not fun anymore.

Yeah ps4

Out comes Franklin's Hag. If I'm gonna lose again they're not leaving with any of thier shit.
---
Not instasaw,regular yellow add ons that reduce the charge time slightly or moderately
---
It says brown and yellow ranks weren't included in the results ..
---
Who are these guys?
---
like with deviousness and thrill of the hunt on killer, it just fills out a certain category faster/with less actions. Doesn't add to your actual "total"
---
Yea, few times today ruin spawned next to the gen or pallet. Let's say it didn't last that long. 
---
And playing survivor ruin spawns on roof or something and no one can find it... Always.
---
I love this so much, good job!
---
Iri heads- sharpened
---
Infantry belt- buckled
---
Ebony mori- burned.
---
Yep, it's Ochido fanboy time
---
There were players with usernames like ‚ÄúHex-‚Äú something and they were both incredibly toxic
---
Sweetie could you please go read my original statement you're not even arguing against my point. You still can in fact escape without self care no matter how good it is or how much it makes you feel safe. No amount teammate blame and toxic killers will change that
---
Darn, so you mean my hourly visits to the Opera won't be mentioned on it?
---
Borrowed Time    
---
Whenever I take the perk off I need it so I'll just keep it all the time
---
This is the second video I‚Äôve uploaded using Corrupt Intervention as a replacement for Ruin. :)
---
This game, the area the survivors were forced into was near to the basement. I managed to hook a survivor there, which then allowed me to snowball as my traps were concentrated around that area. 
---
When the outer generators became available, it was too late as the snowball had begun.
---
"I can do this all day."
---
for some mediocre blood cosmetic? that's an extra 10 levels of BP, especially if they're just doing it for a teachable.
---
Even if they play them, eh? I'd rather just collect everything and use a quality cosmetic.
---
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up
---
Total shock fills your body
---
For ruin I think you‚Äôre ignoring how much it slows down the gens even if you hit the skill check. Getting a great doesn‚Äôt give the gen a mini boost it normally would, and it‚Äôs not realistic to say you always hit the skill check so that will further slow it.
---
As all things should be
---
See I normally do play and I'd rather play, but if a killer is going to farm with me, I'm just gonna say why not. And it's not like it's incredibly common. I've had one through the entire blood hunt
---
This guy must get a lot of gorls
---
Our 50h friend lands greats 90% of the time already. refusing to learn it doesn't make it impossible
---
r/ExpectedThanos
---
You do realize MOM is completely useless against a Nurse, right?
---
Jeff‚Äôs is the best
---
I play more survivor then killer, so saying I want an easier time to get kills is kinda strange. 
---
But since the announcement of collapse I started to pay attention to what I do once the gates are powered. 
---
90% of the time I just escape, the other 10 is when I or someone else is hooked.
---
When you say "it", do you mean his Xbox Live account? Because if so, it's probably just asking for his billing address - the one associated with the credit card on file. Hope this helps!
---
I had no idea that was a thing
---
OMG LOL. I HAVE DONE THIS T\_T
---
The same people who do that are the same people complaining that "it's a bad perk".
---
Better yet, if you buy the merch irl, you get a code to add it to your character in game as well.
---
Outplayed scrub
---
I think its cause of the event and everyone plays killer now. It is easier to farm points so there are not enough surviviors I guess . I usually dont have to wait more than a minute as killer on PC in my region but now I have to wait more than 5-6 minutes
---
That‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm trying to make but okay
---
A bit late
---
For a second i thought the one riding the horse was Shadman, what‚Äôs wrong with me?
---
'Cause baby tonight, the creepers tryin' to steal all your stuff again
---
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
---
But why tho?
---
I've played maybe 50 matches this Double BP event, maybe more.  
---
I've had 3 killers farm.   3.   
---
The rest played normally, which is cool,  let's do this...
---
But I've had MANY more than usual slug, camp, tunnel, bring Moris.. I wish I had kept track in hindsight because it was so noticeable.  Game isn't fun anymore.  
---
What's hilarious is when you question them in endgame chat:  "Why'd you tunnel? We all could have gotten better BP at least?"  
---
GIT GUD LOSER
---
KYS 
---
GG EZ hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Just ignore people like that, it‚Äôs probably a 13 year old tbh. Just really immature.
---
Love that way of thinking xD
---
I'd like to see a clip of pinhead in one of this movies in the teaser, then when the full trailer drops it pans from that clip to ghostface sitting in the corner and he'll look at the camera and just say "So, what's your favourite scary movie?"
---
But if you're gonna play it, why not get the mediocre cosmetic? At least it shows that you kinda know what you're doing.
---
If there is one Report function that gets completely ignored by BHVR, it'd be the Farm one.  Especially during Double BP events. lol.
---
konno dio da xd
---
TL DR is meant for the top.
---
Pallet looping is a toxic behavior by survivors. 
---
LUL
---
I'd like to see a killer version!
---
5 Blinks, uses them all in shorts bursts, has NOED,  Sloppy Butcher, Ruin, and Nurses calling.  
---
EZ DC.  Ain't giving you any more points from me.
---
O play Impossible skill check doctor and still get a lot of salt, even tho I don't do any of the things in your list. Survivors complain when they have a hard time.
---
So? Not my problem ;\*
---
XD
---
pepeHard
---
Deranking guaranteed, assholes.
---
Well it was a Myers he was a baby but we really didn‚Äôt feel like continuing so we just gave up
---
You are the one complaining so I guess it is.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the key only gets used up when you‚Äôve escaped. If the killer grabs you out you keep the key but the hatch closes again.
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Better watch out for his traps
---
Better eat some ginger snaps
---
Traaaper
---
Jazz.... jazz hands
---
Aaaaah thats hot... Thats hot
---
Maybe it was just a visual bug and the stayed open
---
Mini heart attack slowly subsides.
---
1 F = 1 Prayer for our fallen hero
---
Like at least 10
---
Are those the ones you havent bought yet?
---
This is the best way really, I do this with angry customers at work, just be nice lol shocks them
---
Like others already said, that's not a problem.
---
I can describe you my last rounds against Nurses.
---
1) 3 blinks + ruin  
---
2) slugging intensifies with infectious fright  
---
3) a mix between and also a good amount of NOED
---
It's depressing to play for 15min and get around 7k BP because the nurse just slugs everyone to death. Or just to play 3 min because she has 3 blinks. And in both cases, she gets around 20k points. That's simply not fair or fun. So many BPS, so many Escape Cakes for nothing. No thank you.
---
It's honestly not only nurse. Everyone is so sweaty at the moment, that it's not fun to play at all. But well, the things you do for ~~love~~  bloodpoints.
---
If anything, I‚Äôve experienced more potatoes playing dbd during this event than before. As killer, I‚Äôm enjoying the amount of bad players in my lobbies
---
You mean Bloodeh Dead Ard!
---
Botting is an offense.
---
Yup!
---
See, this is why they need to use fan creations in game, good fucking job with this she looks amazing.
---
Just gotta get used to the timing without add ons. You‚Äôll get used to it with time
---
Yes.
---
I never find them until I do find them.
---
Legion and pig are pretty fun, but leather face is also pretty fun but has also easier for new players so get him if your new. Also I'd just get him for bbq and chili
---
Doctor. I'm a 500 hour doc main and I find playing him fun, especially when I get Jigsaw pieces.
---
Do you have devour hope and ruin already?
---
The Hag is really fun to play it and strong in the right hands.The Doctor is noob-friendly and really easy to usr.
---
The Plague is a disaster, bad design and weak against experienced players.
---
Yes. Yes. And yes.
---
I'm happy I reached rank 1 with freddy
---
Nurse's is still pretty good, though personally I prefer Deerstalker, Whispers, Enduring and BBQ.
---
Yeah, can't do anything. Causes me to depip all the time...three in a row today even after game reset
---
Ugh. Why does this happen EVERY Bloodhunt?
---
F
---
I see you aren't a man who appreciates The Plague
---
Claudettes are the worst at hiding. How did you find me? Dude you squatted on top of a hill....
---
The only time I enjoy farming is if it's random. Yes the bloodhunt has made me want to have better games, but there have been so many times where I get messages before the game even starts "farm and I won't tunnel" and my fav "throw party streamers; while also using a  personal survivor pudding. At these points I either leave lobby or DC out. I only want to farm if the game just turned to shambles within seconds or if someone DCd by connection.
---
Terrible terrible analogy man.  Just don't use that shit please.  And no there does exist something called decency and sportsmanship in video games.  It's a game man.  They're supposed to be fun.  And I don't think I said anything controversial there.  I feel the overwhelming majority of the playerbase trolls excluded would agree with me.
---
So weird that you gotta buy all those. You should've bought the special addiction version. I automatically got hag doctor, huntress... hag is A lot of fun to play.
---
Well i Don t dc but nurse should be nerfed, nurse is the only killer that makes me wanna delete the game, and its litteraly at high ranks only nurse and Billy with sometimes spirit.
---
Fuck nurse that killer shouldn t be in game
---
E N T I T Y P L E A S E D
---
I've had it happen just about every 5 games or so. It gets really annoying.
---
looked like Ornstein.
---
I think BPS are just bad luck, for some reason. We've all seen how oddly common it is to throw a BPS into a match and then get tunnelled to death a minute or two into the match, killer spawning on top of you and a basement right nearby sort of thing.
---
No idea. Matches I have managed to get into have ranged from ok to terrible, though.
---
I just want some points, man. :(
---
What‚Äôs the DbD equivalent? Nea and Meg getting dirty in a locker or something like that. Lol
---
I have ruin, but no devour hope.
---
Exploiting is not part of the game the fuck you talking about?  Exploiting unintentionally exist due to broken code in a bad update.  They were never meant to be part of the game.  Exploits equals cheating.  What type of person even attempts to defend that?  
---
Also nobody mentioned flashlights or bodyblocking those are perfectly valid mechanics in the game.  You're making a lot of terrible points this thread dude.
---
Flair checks out
---
Then get Hag devour is a pretty solid perk if used to its full potential.
---
The Special Edition is only for consoles, not PC.
---
I really can't afford any of the licensed players atm. Not really interested in Legion (or clown)
---
I had one of the best games recently where we were in Lery's, and it was a Myers, but instead of him having mirror, I had a pink key with a blood amber and prayer beads add-on, and it was a wonderful role of reversal.
---
They expand it as queues already takes ages.
---
play nurse and tp through pallets and you'll see a whole lot more of that
---
I'm a survivor main, and I approve this message.
---
Not if your DAD CLEANSES IT
---
The hearts are just a bit too low.
---
Lol shhhh let them hide as they are.
---
NSFL
---
Had a match friday night. Brought prayer beads, so I was going to play the match, but BPS was a survivor offering so I guess they all live.
---
Ripped someone off the exit gates for their 3rd hook and just dropped em there and continued to scare the living shit out of my survs. until they escaped =P
---
I'm proud that you could accomplish that.
---
As a Nurse main using Infectious Fright, yes :D
---
*(I only slug if i see someone's "aura" close enough and i'll hook both slugs ASAP)*
---
I‚Äôve grown very attached to Bond as it‚Äôs helpful to find people for gens, healing, exit gates and such. But also I like using it too so I know where not to run the killer. If I see my teammates I know where not to run. 
---
Also small game as hexes are so common now that it helps a lot....I can‚Äôt remember where the hell those totems are placed so gotta use small game. 
---
I also like using We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever but not as a farming tactic. Often matches go bad due to camping or tunnelling and if I can get a save here or there it helps in the end with a bit of a boost to bloodpoints. I always be safe with my hook saves. 
---
My fourth perk I run is Prove Thy Self as it does help with gen repairs but also I like the boost for objective points. Again if a match is going bad but I can co-op on 1 gen it‚Äôll h lo boost points a bit and make a bad match a little more tolerable. 
---
Out of all the 4 I usually run, I almost say Bond is one I couldn‚Äôt live without as it helps in so many different ways.
---
Kate's boobs still jiggle.
---
FINALLY found a lobby. Had to switch to survivor. Face camping Leatherface that has average ping in pregame lobby but like 1000ping in game. All of us spawned together. ALL OF US. Including the killer. We literally spawn IN heartbeat. Balanced Landing refused to work. I couldn‚Äôt heal. My urban evasion wasn‚Äôt working. Every time I tried to vault a window I would teleport back and forth a few times like a goddamn nurse. And it was a face camping  Leatherface.
---
I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm literally 5 seconds from uninstalling this game.
---
The only way to fight toxicity is to kill it with kindness I've learned.
---
I don't always play killer but when I do its bloodhunt and I straight wreck. This leads to people dcing at which point I farm with those who had what it takes to stay in a game.
---
Plunderer's instinct AKA "Why I have 60 worn toolboxes in my inventory"
---
I think rancor is better only if you‚Äôd like to mori the obsession, otherwise it‚Äôs not a decent tracking perk.
---
60 seconds of haunted grounds is better than potentially leaving devour hope up. At least that's what I tell my teammates after they get one shot due to my questionable decision making.
---
If you get the hang of it it‚Äôs a lot of fun
---
I just leave my messages on friends only lol
---
Ahah nope i'm on PS4 and don't use My steam account :)
---
Seriously. I sound like an old man but I remember when toxic was how people acted, and in a very harsh way. Now a survivor bringing a flashlight is toxic, or a killer running mori is toxic. The word has gotten overused and lost all meaning. Like someone t-bagging isn't toxic, it's just bm. Someone messaging you to kys or something like that is toxic.
---
Freddy's Children
---
Eh, When I hide as claudette the killer only finds me 8/10 times
---
I would say it is terrible internet because it was lagging multiple times without any benefit for killer. Lag switch is clearly detected when game runs smoothly and then suddenly lags for killer to get down a survivor and then goes smoothly again.
---
Damn that's awesome. Most I've farmed is 90.
---
JOKES ON YOU my dad left me
---
Removed - unrelated content
---
Thx :)
---
Yes. Also 6000 ping killers.
---
That's the point. Usually, you'd use Ruin with Haunting Grounds to tempt people into cleansing.
---
If there's no Ruin, no Huntress' Lullaby, etc. there's not much reason to cleanse the totem unless you're worried about Devour Hope, which is a more rare Hex perk in my experience.
---
As a general rule I kinda agree but with the right add ons (spirit beads&amp; mother and daughter ring) I‚Äôd say spirit takes the win, she‚Äôs literally impossible to counter unless you‚Äôre lucky enough to be running spine chill but even then she‚Äôs tough to face.
---
I‚Äôve literally never seen anyone post it at the top.
---
Have an upvote because your not wrong.
---
It's still usable with Monitor and Abuse, though. Your terror radius will be smaller out of chase, so you might still see survivors healing, since the Nurse's Calling radius is bigger than the heartbeat radius. You can then phase to them and hit them. Don't expect it to work every time, but it's definitely not useless.
---
Lol that's so true though
---
This is true but when you do see someone healing you just phase right on to them and get an easy down, I use nurses regularly on spirit and it does help a fair bit.
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Since the event started, I've been getting survivor lobbies pretty fast, so maybe there's too many killers playing.
---
Threats absolutely not, never acceptable, some harmless salt sure.  Camping isn't the intended way to play the game dude.  Look no further than both the pip system and bloodpoints system to see that.  The devs go out of their way to encourage trashcans not to camp.  Stop making it sound like a core staple in the game.  Shit players make it that way it isn't intent on the devs part.  They punish your rankup potential and rewards systems for doing it.  That should tell you something.
---
Tell me your secrets
---
It took me over an hour to find a killer game earlier. Connection was fine until we loaded in. This poor Kate literally couldn‚Äôt even run from me, and I spent a full minute trying to pick her up because it was so bad. Decided to just let her go and messaged them all to just escape when they wanted because Christ....
---
I'd like to see all killers have the confidence to play without the safety bet but let's be honest, most NOED gamers rely on the perk to salvage their games.  There would be a babykiller revolt if NOED was so much as glanced at in terms of adjusting.  Unfortunately it's here to stay and more commonly used than ever.
---
Yep
---
Black box with ivory mori and dying light.
---
I‚Äôm voting for The Hag. She‚Äôs very strong! In the right hands :)
---
Her add-ons Disfigured Hand, Mint Rag, Rusty Shackles, and the fuckin‚Äô heart one  allow for a more fun/different play style- unlike a lot of killers‚Äô addons that don‚Äôt do much. 
---
Hex: Devour Hope is also fun/useful, ESPECIALLY so on some other killers (hint hint Spirit/Trapper) 
---
She be murderin‚Äô fools all across the map in record time.
---
STBFL and Iron Will. I love STBFL, and Iron Will has saved me so many times it's not funny.
---
The 200iq solo haunted grounds totem play.
---
PS4 seems to be completely fucked right now. Has been all night since PSN went down for maintenance last night. As soon as PSN was back up and to normal it was shit.
---
And also, need I mention Nurse's Calling? The moment they start using self-care the jig is up.
---
Big Brain Move
---
Isn't it based on the Terror Radius, meaning Distressing is actually helpful?
---
Can barely get into a game, it‚Äôs rather annoying and if I do get into a game, those spike auto save things come back and it causes me to lag all over the place
---
i solely think noed is pure trash on Spirit, Billy, Nurse and Hag. gives these killers way too much power. i only played Hag with noed when she was trash and it was legit.
---
Bubba without noed? i don't think so, he's a low mid tier killer despite his chainsaw. Myers has two add-ons that remove his instadown ability so also acceptable perk on him.
---
Removed- No screenshots highlighting multiple disconnects
---
He‚Äôs not botting he‚Äôs farming by pressing the mouse
---
It‚Äôs sad for the killers who aren‚Äôt playing like cunts, like me. Every game I‚Äôm just hoping for atleast 1 BPS, but you can‚Äôt really blame survivors. I‚Äôve gone against asshole killers during this event, idk why people want to ruin the experience and fun for people.
---
insidious is a thing so im pretty sure devs view it as a legitimate tactic
---
I face camped this Kate because she kept this Jeff in the wall, she deserved it lol. Camping does hurt killers. I lost 35% of my emblem for face camping him lol I agree they need to further punish killers for face camping but for now pips hurt a lot for me lmao
---
god i fucking hate that add on.
---
woowee
---
EGC won‚Äôt really change this
---
I've been having a crappy experience playing surivivor during the BP event, so I switched to killer. I hook everyone twice if I can, but unless they kill themselves on the hook or their teammates don't get them, I'm not killing anyone (with the exception of one really toxic group). I chase them hard right until the exit gate so as to hopefully give them a good exciting game, but also letting them get 5,000 extra BP.
---
I feel you man, I'm pretty much tilt proof but I still feel the annoyances of getting my good matches cut short. 
---
It usually seems to level out around 1pm, but I get the "fairest" matches around 6-7pm.
---
The devs don't take it seriously. No one ever said that.
---
How many p3 do you have?
---
I must say, you don't know what you're talking about, camping as hag doesn't mean staying near the hook, it just means placing a trap there.
---
so take back what you said lmfao
---
I was playing legion 100% not scum(you know made up survivor rules). I never used my power to down. I never multi-stabbed a survivor. I ran brown trash addons. 
---
I was letting them live so they can escape(Happy Blood Hunt) and then two of the four survivors DC and start harassing me post game chat. Saying they can't wait for legion to get nerfed and that I'm a piece of [Bad Word].
---
Had another game where the other survivors apologized for the person DCing. Even though the whole group knew I wasn't killing them. they were just mad that I slugged them every time I found them even though they were on their 3rd hook. It's not like the survivor stood still. They ran tried to loop me, used their DH and 360. (My bad building up my BP to max then I AFK)
---
I just think its funny how survivors don't want a killer that can beat them. Even though I didn't exploit any of the legion current power. I was playing them as if it were PTB.
---
I play both survivor and killer. I enjoy killer more than playing solo survivor. When my group of friends are on I play survivor.
---
This community makes fun of itself and it knows its terrible. It needs some help.

Holy shit thank you. I thought I was crazy or just terrible at Clown. I started playing him a lot recently. I usually play Spirit and Freddy. I genuinely think Freddy is better. Free first hit in a chase and pretty much the same potential at safe loops (re: none), plus aura tracking and game stalling. Clown needs a ton of love. You confirmed my suspicion about the gas: it doesn't actually do anything unless you have a have a hindered add-on or feather. I think the narrative that he's mid-tier comes from people just not playing him or using him. The base reload time is ridiculous. It takes 10-20% of a gen (depending on how many are on it) to reload your bottles.
---
It‚Äôs because every time you do as a survivor, the killer facecamps and tunnels to be a dick. I shit you not every single time someone has brought one since the Bloodhunt started this has happened to me. I got pissed yesterday and started loading as killer and telling survivors to bring BP and get a free farm. Couldn‚Äôt bring myself to punish them for the awful connection because for all I knew it was MY shitternet since I was the host. They all were so thankful they added me as a friend. Apparently I was the first non camping killer they had gotten all night. (They were a SWF)
---
This weekend has been rough in my experience. I've played about 10 - 15 games of survivor, and people are getting tunneled, camped, farmed off hooks, etc. I blame it on the BP event.
---
The devs have implemented some things to counter face camping. Most recently, you lose points in your enblems for camping and you can't down a unhooked survivor until they have regained control of their character. Also, quite a while ago when I first started playing, multi-directional unhooking wasn't a thing yet. If the killer stood right in front of a hooked survivor, there was no way for anyone to save them.
---
Yeah, I don't blame you for using meta perks. It doesn't help that I'm not that great at being chased yet, so even a bad killer can catch me eventually, there's no winning for me there.
---
You'd think killers who play survivor would know how unfun camping and tunneling is, but apparently empathy doesn't exist in the gamer world haha. Although to be fair, a lot of killers already camp and tunnel on ps4, especially in the low-ranks (and I'm rank 12-11 so...), the event just increased their numbers.
---
4, Nea, Claudette, Meg  and Feng
---
Yeah, that's be great!
---
next time send ss if you cant record it
---
Don‚Äôt need to farm as killer to rack up bloodpoints. As long as yer active you‚Äôll always gain 100k+ every game, unlike survivor where it‚Äôs more harder doing so every game.
---
Power that even the Entity itself fears
---
Nice got them on p3 50 too ^^ and some others I don't know right now :)
---
I think it should be combined with Hope
---
I've been playing all day and night since the event started and I haven't had a issue or had a game take longer than 3 mins to load in. Might just be your area unfortunately.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it more on Sundays but I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. I‚Äôve been playing Killer just cause hella easy points for goofing off and suddenly today I‚Äôm in lobby waiting for 3-5 for even the first few survivors to show up. I‚Äôm in Purple ranks too so it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a shortage of players in my brackets and my lobbies normally fill up super quick too.
---
hmmm ü§î
---
Too op pls nerf
---
Ugh. I haven‚Äôt gotten them yet. Only a matter of time.
---
Whispers is arguably one of the best tracking perks to begin with. Whenever I'm not running it I just feel lost and in hopes that no one is near ruin.
---
Why though? It‚Äôs like a bad ruin
---
It's honestly really annoying and boring. EVERY killer has this exact build. Idk if it's a good rank thing or a blood points weekend thing or not, but it's really frustrating. I just want variety!
---
i'd use it
---
Players would rather get easier games. M1 killers they‚Äôre glad to get against. Killers like Nurse or Legion right now players don‚Äôt like because they‚Äôre harder to counter. They just want a killer that is way essier to loop, so when getting against Legion, Nurse, a good Trapper, a good Plag, or a leatherdaddy those types of players DC
---
Agreed.  On top of the ranking system punishing camping, how are camping killers so common when it's guaranteed you will almost never safety pip when you hard camp?
---
absolutely not, end game collapse, despite what some knee jerk reactions say, isnt a buff for the killer in any way shape or form, its merely a quality of life update to prevent matches being taken hostage.
---
I couldn't be mithered with it anyways ya know? Can't be arsed.
---
Another reason why we need penalties for intentionally disconnecting, more than just de-pipping.
---
oh god, hag would be amazing, doctor would probably be too, or clown?
---
Here's my argument with that. If killers had so much control. How come as you rank up certain killers can't keep up with survivor experience. A tier list is made for killers on how well they perform.
---
There is a reason why nurse is the top played killer on PC.
---
As you rank up on survivor most killers that you see are billy, nurse, and sometimes spirit.
---
Why is this?
---
Because the counter pressure that survivors put out by spreading GEN PRESSURE is too much for the other killers to keep up with. The time it takes other killers to cross the map to spread pressure isn't fast enough. 
---
Experience in this game causes a meta shift. It's easy to play anything against Low rank survivors because they make a lot of mistakes. Low rank killers make a lot of mistakes by chasing in dead tiles and continuing to chase while being looped in a dead tile.
---
Delete Steam and don't come back, thanks.
---
Rip prayer beads tho.
---
no, I don't get upset. It's literally just a part of the game.
---
what kind of harassment did you do?
---
At least now I know you're a liar. Or dont play survivor. Carry on.
---
props to op for having the patience we both don‚Äôt have lol
---
they have to know its up? I hope you know, as the host, killers have 0 ping, its the survivors who have high pings, so its your own fault if you stay in the lobby with 500 ping.
---
it's still good tho.
---
&gt; Camping isn't the intended way to play the game dude
---
And that's where you are wrong - I am not saying it is THE strategy but it definately has uses.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEaFKY3opY0
---
Also the emblem system has proven to be a pile of shit.
---
Because wanting to play games with a friend because it's objectively more fun to have someone to talk to is a great counter argument to the biggest crutch perk left in the game.  Jesus dude.  I primarily solo queue and face killers constantly up through rank 1 running NOED.  Your argument is stupid.  The game aside from MOM has never been more balanced for killer.  I consistently 3 or 4K with Freddy for fucks sake.  Decisive isn't even a thing anymore.  Do we still need the crutch man?
---
The pallet doesn't even bother me,  it's the DC.
---
playing at rank 15 is like the killer gets an old ebony mori every round, every time a survivor gets downed they insta dc
---
Still getting better revenue that way. I'm survivor main and have unlocked teachables for Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress, Myers, Plague and Clown using this strat of farming thus far getting all teachables unlocked for everyone. And I mean I also make ppl happy that way so it's fine for me.
---
Damn they only do that shit to legit toxic assholes and dipshits, you must've been extremely toxic lmao.
---
WHERE'S FENG?!
---
I never said it was bannable dude.  Why link unrelated shit?  I said the devs have gone out  of their way to devise a system that punishes both your rewards and rank if you choose to camp.  That is them telling you it is not the intended way to play.  You can choose to do it, you won't get in trouble but they will punish you in other ways which they do.
---
id rather have enduring over noed
---
Ew prayer beads
---
I'll say hag. Hag is a very strong killer and her perks are very good. Ruin is one of the best perks in the game, devour hope is one of the most fun perks and if it lasts, you get a slaughter of a match. Third seal honestly isn't the best but it's pretty decent for slug builds
---
Nea is the only one not 50 yet. Double BP should fix that :-) also Meg WAS my main until I turned into a toxic Claudette
---
Do you guys re queue after 2 or 3 minutes or do you just queue up and stare at the screen for 20+mins?
---
There really is very little you can do about it otherwise. You can't block a killer from entering an area around the hook when he's hooked someone, since that would impact mobility and make the killer unable to stop anyone from unhooking while they might be chasing someone.
---
dont blame the players, blame the game (aka the devs, for making majority of perks in the game nearly worthless in comparison to the top tier ones)
---
So i guess you also want that the survivors in red ranks stop using MoM or Self-Care or all the meta perks, isn't? And if Noed  bothers you just clean the totems
---
wait i had a killer do this until i was about to bleed out anyway. I was wondering why they did that, but yeah, the chases were still fun and I think it helped me learn (I'm very new to PC). So thank you for your continued support (even though it might not have been you.)
---
Same, I have dailies to do with characters I'm currently leveling, but I'm waiting until the event is over because I don't have good perks on them. I'm a newer player and I can't play killer for a couple of reasons, so leveling my survivors with survivor's bloodpoint gain is a nightmare.
---
Now I regret not buying DS when it was in the shrine, it seems to be really helpful. It would help me get better at hitting small skillchecks too haha.
---
Hope you have better games once the event is over then. Good luck with your prestige adventures :D
---
Feels bad
---
nice name
---
I've noticed when I hear survivors I just can't seem to hear them, but most cases I can't hear them at all even though I'm using a headset, backtracking actually makes sense as most of the time their scratch marks just stop in the open an no one is to be found, I do use BBQ but I always forget I have it so I never look around but I'll try everything, thank you! :D
---
I‚Äôm aware, but you were implying that if a killer has a one shot ability it automatically makes them good so Noed on those killers shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. Whereas Nurse and Spirit are not one shot and yet those two absolutely don‚Äôt need Noed.
---
Resilience since I don't use self care
---
Enduring
---
Me too, but today, both sides got really slow queues. I used to get instant survivor lobbies at the beginning at the event, but today is just horrible.
---
Except you can look at someone's friends list and see when they are lying. Which is often.
---
Damn dude. It‚Äôs just a game. I just started playing on steam and the worst thing I said in chat was to a camper was he was a shitty killer. If it gets to that point just take a break for a month or two or forever in your case.
---
I've had a lot less toxic survivors, so as a result a lot more people have escaped or been given the hatch. IDK wholesome survivors make me so much more chill
---
Spies is a good shout actually especially as I main Legion, I'll try it out, thanks! :D
---
Well, if you got him in the end, he didn't play well enough soooooooo... Lels
---
It got to the point where even when I find a match, it's against purple rank killers and survivors. Please rank reset come quick
---
spirit needs ultra rares to compete with billies base kit. he outclasses her by a longshot
---
Ash looks good tho
---
Yeah
---
best girl
---
Yeah it has something to do with Rugby If I'm remembering correctly
---
he looks like a dog wow
---
I don't notice too much bugs, but
---
What are some of your (in your opinion) best, most flavorful death wishes?
---
Wat?
---
Do you have a tough time reading facial expressions? You might be low key Asperger's
---
I like meg outfits more ^^
---
I want my wglf stacks tho
---
The constants use of NOED is a response the swf assholery because being a killer main against the constant douchbaggery of toxic swf teams is seriously demoralizing. 
---
Yknow why survivors lobbies take so Damn long? Because swf teams are assholes that make the game not as fun for killers. So whats the choice a killer main has? Tunneling/facecamping/NOED or just switch to survivor which is happening. So less killers means more wait times for survivors. 
---
NOED is just another response. You can be a great killer main and still use NOED.
---
Face camping is toxic as fuck. Might as well just make it that you die instantly when hooked. They should make it so gen repair speeds increase when the killer remains that close to a survivor not in a chase. Or have the killer lose a good amount of BP for face camping so it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Im not sure what your point is as that does nothing to refute stats put out by the devs.
---
what platform was this? that could have been me
---
I made a hag DC yesterday. First minute of the game I find a trapped lit totem. Crawl over the trap and cleanse and then set the trap off and run. 
---
She loses me and DCs. Turns out it was devour hope.
---
The rose tattoo, it's the symbol for a Rugby club
---
"Stay safe put there" they should probably change that for permas
---
Get help. It's pretty sick to wish death on someone because you don't approve of the way they play a video game. Re-evaluate yourself.
---
What's the survival rate? For each.
---
Well i am surely not comming back to this game , i played legit and the guy that i reported that had hacked legacy did not get banned even with video proof. Banning someone from the game for just writing in end-game chat is beyond stupid, i don't know if you ever played other games but they usually have a chat ban.
---
Guy on a pic is called ozon671games if you are interested
---
I want to see charts showing the least used perks for killers and survivors and the least used items/add-ons
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt actually know that people knew about this. I thought I discovered something new, goddammit.
---
If you really were toxic its deserved. Maybe try not being toxic? I would just be done playing if you can't help it. Just my opinion don't hurt me through words please lol
---
Ok...
---
Because im probably the first one to be banned permanently for this reason.
---
entered a game as spirit, I put on survivor pudding and the other survivors put escape cakes. Turned out to be a 3 man game. One of the survivors was an ace and he was being an absolute meme lord, it was soo hilarious. We farmed and trolled around. In the end we got a fuck ton of bloodpoints and fun :)
---
Can you appeal it? We all make mistakes and outside of causing actual harm everyone should get a second chance.
---
You sound like someone who can't accept others opinion.
---
Whispers at level 3 is absolutely the best perk for the rest of the build, it's just not great at that low rank.
---
More! I want to see bill and ash!
---
Only cause he‚Äôs based on the *handsome* Bruce Campbell so you really can‚Äôt mess it up. Ash doesn‚Äôt count.
---
Yes that is a rather important distinction to make because I'm betting the higher the rank the more likely hood its a Tryhard/toxic swf team. You are more likely to get solo survivors at lower ranks when they are just learning the game. Sure you'll be getting some lone wolves near the top too but you'll get top killers as well and since the whole point of being a survivor is to, yknow survive, being a solo player isn't exactly a good idea. No one likes wasting offerings and/or items right? Unless you're a douche and fuck over the other people. 
---
My point is that the higher the rank the more likely the swf and all encompassing douchbaggery that follows because at that point survival is much higher and comms, as I've played with friends, makes it so much easier. 
---
I know when to unhook. I know where traps and totems are. I know to be at the gate right when a gen is about to pop etc etc. 
---
NOED is easy to counter. Comms? Not so much.
---
Again the emblem system is busted - it awards better emblems for a Survivor reaching a new Hook Stage. The whole devout emblem is about KILLING the survivors.
---
There are tons of other incentives for camping, like certain perks (insidious) or killer abilites (leatherface).
---
Again, I do not claim that camping is THE WAY to go, but shit yeah, it is meant to be strategy wise the best option at certain points
---
That's why I  run Small Game and cleanse all 5 totems before the gate is powered. Never seen anyone else use it, so I have to.
---
Especially Kate. Her hair is so bad.
---
No , the ban is permanent as it shows in the screenshot above.
---
F-Mega
---
Ace in the hole
---
I‚Äôm on mobile right now and didn‚Äôt click it. Sorry to hear that.
---
Even then, having the killer let someone farm you on hook(like over and over, not even attempting to hit the other survivor) goes under a different report category. I think farming is reportable when the killer is using a bot to do it(literally just uses m1 all game, doesn't move, nothing else) but not much else.
---
Am I not spinning them fast enough or something? I know it's weird, but I wamt to see it.
---
Honestly the only thing I could think of is to lose Bloodpoints instead of pip points.
---
It's pretty visible when he's using the shirtless cosmetic. The same rose can be found on his red tracksuit. I think it's part of the national UK rugby team's logo.
---
Don't be sorry i was really toxic. :)
---
Nurses, it's really good on spirit because nurses is 28 meters and spirits terror radius is 24 meters. When you spot a survivor, phase walk to them and although they'll be able to hear the phasing sound due to them being outside the terror radius, they'll probably react too late as you are already really close to them
---
Because I'd rather not put in 3x the bloodpoints, for something that doesn't really show that much, considering I could just play someone else and dump points into them (Like I did for most teachables). And again, I'd never use it, so it wouldn't matter either way.
---
Like it's just a waste of time for me, I could just have fun with all the perks now, rather than do the "grind" 3x over, for something completely worthless to me.
---
Uh have tier 1, not tier 2. It‚Äôs 20. Each tier is an interval of 8 btw.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs probably very visible on that skin.
---
one of these things is not like the other 
---
which one is different, do you know?
---
Months? Oof
---
But then that could end up being unfair for the killer when all 3 survivors hook-bomb the hooked survivor and there's little use in leaving the hook area. If a killer wants to kill, they will probably do so regardless. There really is very little more the devs could implement.
---
As a Feng main I second thid
---
Well harsh punishment deters and if the devs were really hellbent in punishing they would do this. Never said it was a good option.
---
Well played my dude, well played
---
understandable
---
i nutted today
---
I mean there's stuff to do, to say that the ONLY reason survivors stay behind is to teabag at the exit gates is dumb. Making sure everyone is out is a rather normal thing that happens in MOST of my matches, as survivor I want to know if everyone is either safe or for sure dead, hell even in my killer matches that's what I see survivors do and I'm alright with it, it gives me a chance to still probably get extra kills, I don't end up sulking in a corner to scared to see a survivor teabagging me.
---
Making sure the other gate is opened, bodyblocking for chased survivors, sabotaging hooks near the gates, going for hook saves because you got BT or a insta heal so you're capable of it. As many other people say the game isn't over just because the gates are powered/open.
---
The option to just leave is there ok, hell as killer you probably wouldn't mind survivors staying since now you will most likely snowball SUBSTANTIALLY easier if they try to make that risky save on a 2 minute timer, hell I'm expecting blood warden plays to come in to where you guarantee everyone dead with no escape with &lt;1 min left. The complaint of "I won't see scratch marks as easily" is nonsensical as there's only 2 ways they can for sure escape anyway and if they aren't around either they're at the disadvantage not the killer.
---
Tier 1 is 20, tier 2 is 25 and tier 3 is 28
---
Right? It's obnoxious as fuck having to deal with these pussies every other game.
---
The match didn't go the way you wanted? Harden the fuck up and deal with it instead of being a little bitch and fucking yourself and your team over.
---
Yesterday I actually managed to find 3 or so groups that wanted to farm! of course they were sprinkled between the usual flashlight spam, "you suck shitsucker, get a life cunt", etc, but it was nice to see anyways. It was nice, I got to get ruin, so I'll have more of a shot at playing people I enjoy, rather than having to resort to Billy or Nurse in order to play at higher ranks.
---
Hoping they add an unranked mode in the future, 100% excited for the legion changes (felt fun to play, heard no complaints from survivors), and the end game collapse. Sad about piggie changes, was gonna buy her next, but you can't win them all really, so I'll take what I can get.
---
Last 2 games as killer the game crashed and survivor is a coin toss at this point
---
Ive tried both. Either way I always wait a minimum of 10 minutes before a lobby. But I get insta dodged all the time too.
---
I got like 5 last night and I have to restart my computer every time it‚Äôs awful
---
Leave lobby and rejoin is typically what i do after 5-10 min
---
yea, but the effect isn't as big when survivors you face actually focus and their greats
---
had a lot of fun with the basement as trapper. survivors kept running into the trap at shack window. its not like i tunneled them. they chose to get trapped by the same trap!
---
Welp, that will certainly do that job. For any killer most likely lol
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion but self care. I like it bc you can't always rely on your teammates. The only downfall tho it takes so much longer since they nerfed it
---
Doubtful
---
Yeah. Use on Doc for maximum screams
---
Times bans that get worse the more you DC and Reduced BP earnings for games they stay in. Literally just rip off Overwatch‚Äôs entire system. It works there. They even time ban continuously quitting in Arcade(the most unimportant and non competitive) games.
---
Killers and survivors can both get party streamers..
---
Your last sentence is cringe worthy, I didn‚Äôt realise people would take it so personally. Maybe do some actual reading sometime, instead of getting your understanding from what everyone else does. TL;DR is meant to be useful, not at the bottom of a body of text. Take care, I‚Äôm sorry if my words make your personally or physically upset.
---
Poor Jaime has displeased EntiTywin. Sorry for the shit quality, but this was my first time messing around with Adobe After Effects. Figured I'd mix my favorite show with the game I play the most.
---
I mean if they want to start being toxic first...
---
I was stuck having to play him for dailies,let's just say it was a personal hell
---
And if everyone is healthy and not on a hook? You're just going to hide? When the killer isn't near you?
---
This is the greatest bait I've ever seen
---
if you lay off the CalArts art style these would be pretty cool
---
Dead by daylight falls
---
I can't change your mind because I agree (:
---
I got some yesterday, wym?
---
You have a 1/56 chance in getting a certain perk, a greater chance if you have perks at tier 3
---
can you explain in dumb for me? Is there any chance i can get it again?
---
Hag is very fun and depends on ur IQ, take her
---
Yes, it's RNG which one you get each level, there's a chance you'll get it again the next level or not for another 10 levels, it's all luck
---
I. KNOW. WHAT. TL;DR. MEANS. 
---
Take your own advice and read what I actually said. You‚Äôre so focused on shitty predictive text and voice to text fucking up that you‚Äôre just further being rude and repeating yourself.
---
And you too can, *take care*.
---
Ok thx so much i play micheal and missed m and a so i was pissed
---
I‚Äôve had games where i‚Äôve been absolutely shit on as killer. I go to each gate and they‚Äôre both open (which should be enough for them to leave). I might find 2 or 3 at the gates and i‚Äôll kick them out because all i really want is to go to the next match. But there‚Äôs always that one person that won‚Äôt leave even after 5 minutes of both gates being open, all their teammates having escaped, and said person being at full health when it‚Äôs clear i don‚Äôt have NOED. I need EGC for that person. Whether they‚Äôre looting, padding stats, BMing, looking for hatch... i need them to leave and rather not hunt the whole map for them.
---
Well put I agree completely.
---
No your really not my problem lol. Go complain about someone else‚Äôs post :)
---
Anddd yet another example for why I hate survivor mains. Because they treat killers who play like decent human beings disrespectfully for no reason
---
Unfortunately using the word bug in the title isn't allowed so I had to write problem, you're welcome to write a post to test this for yourself
---
Thrill of the Hunt is for protecting your hexes and NOED is if you suck. Jk, it's if they manage to get you to endgame, then you one shot them. So it's pretty situational for both
---
Again. You‚Äôre just repeating yourself without absorbing what I am saying at all. Your entire tone of post comes off as condescending on top of that. I‚Äôm done with you.
---
Farming is only bannable if the killer is actively working with survivors to kill you or using a bot to farm games.
---
If others were still playing you dont see killer perks &amp; stuff..
---
nice.
---
Exactly, if we "camp" were baby killers who dont know what we're doing
---
I'd they survive, we're bad players and should feel bad. 
---
Why not say "good game! Thnx for the fun" and walk away. Much easier than being rude.
---
You could add them into the game, if you want to risk EAC *possibly* giving you a ban. I wouldn't, but wanted to mention it for people here who might not know.
---
Are you kidding me, everyone is complaining that we get chapters instead of balance changes and now we have people complaining that we don't get chapters fast enough?
---
Easy pick on Noed. Unless you somehow have a lot of hex perks going on Thrill won't do anything on its own.
---
I float around 5 and have never used it. Maybe it's just a prediction on your survivors rather than using the crows?
---
We can't reason with stupidity. Next he'll be saying stand in front of a hook and wave the Killer over.
---
Nurse is officially too OP.
---
DEVS, NERF PLS!
---
The emblem system is only busted for bad killers.  If you play aggressively to initiate new chases and hooks on new survivors you rank up just fine. I've double pipped off 3k's in the new system.  It was designed to punish babykillers who camp and tunnel.  There are considerably more perks in the game that only work if you don't camp then there are those designed for it.  Again Leatherface is old af.  Insidious was one of the original perks at launch.  Look at recent shifts from devs.  Camping is not encouraged.  It is accepted if you decide to punish yourself in order to grief survivors but it isn't encouraged.
---
It's great. The recent statistics also showed us that only 3-6% of all survivors are full 4 man groups. People can be such crybabies at times, assuming everything and making up excuses to feed their ego.
---
Never thought of that. I guess because the camera is always moving I wouldn't notice
---
If you‚Äôre ruining two hex perks I would say thrill of the hunt is great if you can apply map pressure.   If you‚Äôre learning NOED is a good tool to figure things out, but I would replace it with Ruin eventually.
---
It‚Äôs BHVR, bugs from Beta are still in the damned game. (This is mostly an exaggeration for joke purposes but still...)
---
I do my best to not feel salty when the killer wins. That's the game, you know? And no matter what, as long as the plays were fair, I will always say gg to the killer.  
---
  
---
Literally five mins ago was the first time I've actually called out a killer clown who camped the basement for THREE people. Like, it didn't matter who he had hooked, he camped them and we had to essentially take turns sacrificing ourselves in the hopes that we could keep each other alive. It was just stupid and pointless. There's other ways to max out your BP that includes killing us all fair and square.  
---
That being said, it's usually more toxic on the survivor side from what I've noticed and I try not to be a part of that (with this exception, I guess). It's just a game! But it does suck to have an entire match thrown based on someone who can't learn how to get good.
---
I think the killer needs to be within range to open the locker, I don‚Äôt know, a Jane tried to use it on me a couple times last night and every time it didn‚Äôt work
---
What you read into in a comment is yours and yours alone, as words don‚Äôt have emotions attached- only that which you project. I‚Äôm repeating myself because your words showed me you don‚Äôt know how to use TL;DR, and so I am driving the point home. I‚Äôm sorry that this interaction is so upsetting to you. There‚Äôs nothing to absorb in your comments because it‚Äôs you emotionally projecting and sharing anecdotes based on conjecture purely because of ‚Äúyour feelings‚Äù. You ‚Äúliterally never seeing‚Äù it at the top is just more evidence that you browse the internet passively instead of learning. Your responses further prove that. Alright, I‚Äôll stop too.
---
What do you mean a crow perch down? Like if they land there's no survivor there or they have been scared in that spot recently?
---
Do you usually find survivors based off them?
---
Thanks appreciate the help
---
Yeah, when I move too much I get really disoriented quick, and I‚Äôm less likely to spot someone who make have poked out from a tree a bit, or disappearing scratch marks.
---
I have beaten very good coordinated swf teams where I had to bust my ass and play a perfect game too.  They aren't all potatoes just because I can win against them without resorting to baby tactics like noed, camps and tunnels.  The fact that this concept seems incomprehensible to you speaks volumes about your own killer play.
---
I guess it's really good if they have 2 options to let you know which one they took. I'm a very aggressive player as I main Billy so I dont have alot of time to stop and watch them you know?
---
K appreciate the help
---
What does that usually tell you or how do you act once you see them fly off?
---
I want one wow
---
Thanks appreciate it
---
Did you just call me stupid, stupid
---
They‚Äôre probably a SWF group, it‚Äôs stupid. The matchmaking can be terrible without SWF as it is too..
---
Indeed. You lack reasoning
---
They will probably change it for end game collapse
---
Hopefully you run into a really good game with 5 BPS
---
My reasoning is clear you didnt answer yet so you just look like a fool
---
Ofcourse , goodbye and fuckoff :P
---
You need to do killers next, or even the, "I think we did a pretty good job so far" guy.
---
Maybe people  are just sick of try hard sweaty killers who camp and tunnel.
---
That guy has a name
---
*i think we did a Pretty good job so far*
---
Kate has a pretty good chest
---
Dwight looks like mori to me
---
Lol now I'm a liar a sleeper agent survivor just because I rightfully call NOED a crutch?  Classic move on this sub lol.  I've been hitting rank 1 killer since the days of the pallet vacuum, insta blind flashlights l, having to uncloak to break a gen or search a locker with my Wraith etc....the games are considerably easier for us now it isn't even remotely close.
---
Also I never said comms weren't a big advantage communication clearly is.  I am saying that even with said communication most swf are very beatable if you are a good killer.  They have an advantage but a great killer is still in the power role against survivors.  It takes a Marth level depip squad to challenge that and those are far and few between.
---
I used to use NOED myself a long time ago back when Survivors were disgustingly OP and had every broken mechanic in the game at their disposal.  Then the pallet vacuum update happened and I saw how much easier are chases got.  I took it off my Trapper, Freddy and Wraith the moment that realization set in.  Then we received like 8 more buffs/survivor nerfs after that lol.  Again if you can't see how good we have it at this point MOM excluded I don't know how else I can explain it to your boosted ass.
---
Might as well since they fucked up my pig.
---
if those were stickers, id totaly buy them!
---
Club 96
---
I have had that happen. He tried to say I wasn't taking part in the game or something.  He did his gens and left. I think that he barely got 14k for his match everyone else was over 20k. I didn't even respond to him when he messaged me. 
---
This was a while back when I would only play killer for daily rituals.
---
That's a good point.  I even had a BHVR dev in a farm game Saturday night and they didn't actively engage in the farming, but they did slyly get their points.  
---
Now that you mention, I do bet it's more along the lines of "helping the killer" style farming.  Hmm.
---
Keep projecting and deflecting those insecurities  :) ! You‚Äôll eventually wonder why your sad and alone your entire life.
---
Winning makes for a decent game.
---
You okay?
---
Remember when people called this perk garbage ? They didn‚Äôt change it. Thats how much the community changes opinions
---
Bruce Campbell is a total DILF. He makes me want to be gay.
---
You two are at it again!
---
I feel you man. Thats why Herman Carter is my best killer
---
As a killer main, I disagree. Is it really fun to slug all four survivors just to get the win?
---
This is what mental illness looks like.
---
From personal experience having the game completly crash to desktop or just the match makes little difference.
---
However having to load the game up again after each ragequit might get people to think about if it wouldn't just be faster to get hooked and die there.
---
I cannot understand how people can argue against ragequitters yet want to have a big DC button on the interface with little to no punishment.
---
Thnx? o.o it's just speculation and playing for a while.
---
Oh my god. 
---
The bridge. 
---
That place, and the hotel windows place on the mall level have brought me many headaches and laughs.

Dimma Delet Dis
---
my point is we get neither fast enough, they take a very long time just to do the little things. for example, the last time perks got "buffed" in the sense that they actually changed something besides values was some time in March, and we got such gems as:
---
"Pharmacy: All tiers have a reduced audible distance of 8 metres.
---
Wake Up: All tiers reveal auras at 128 metres."
---
then the last time before that was early january when they reworked prove thyself and leader, and we also got this gem:
---
"Technician: All tiers reduce audible repair sounds by a distance of 8 meters, up from 0/-4/-8."
---
so it basically took them two months out of the year to rocket science up these ideas for these perks that nobody uses at all, and still come out with absolutely nothing. it just doesn't make sense even from a business stand point, like if you look at the nightmare on elm street DLC pack, why would you realistically buy it? freddy still hasn't gotten his fabled rework in two years, quentin is one of the ugliest characters in the game, and all 6 perks you get in that pack are pretty forgettable compared to other killer and survivor perks. i know they're working on dedicated servers and im sure it takes a lot of resources so im willing to cut them slack for now, but i hope business really picks up after they get it implemented.
---
Berating others isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúopinion‚Äù it‚Äôs just a obvious way of showing how unhappy you are with yourself. May is mental health month maybe you can find a support worker to help you out with your anger issues.
---
Me gusta.
---
You can't see any perks/add-ons from the killer until the match is complete.  They changed it to nerf SWF meta-game a bit
---
No it doesn't make any sense. How is doing the main objective as a Survivor toxic? You seem to be the only fool around here hence all the downvotes.
---
It would have costed you $0.00 to not make this
---
Yeah, you should totally draw the name guy
---
:D

Don't need to slug four people to win. This build isn't even that great. Let people run whatever perks they want.

---
There are more and more dbd cosplayers in Switzerland, yay!
---
i swear every time theres word on female clothes its always on the boob area
---
Nice to see sportsmanship isn't dead in this game.  Way to pay it forward man.  Take some Karma
---
I am having the same issues. I ended up doing the same. I got one thank you but wasn't really doing it for that.  I just wanted more than 9k in a match.  
---
I don't mind just playing but it seems like killers are being extra campy and tunneling during the event. The moonrise event was almost exactly like this one but I at least got a couple farmers or normal playing killers.
---
It wasn't like this before the moonrise event or I was just blind to it. I don't know.
---
Thing is, no matter what everyone says, camping is counterable and shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for the rest of the survivors. Now if youre the one getting camped sucks to be you but the other survivors can just do free gens and leave. Going for the rescue ESPECIALLY in the basement or against a killer with high damage potential is suicide, unless you have perks to help like BT
---
Sweaty Sunday. I've been running Detective's hunch all day to deal with NOED.
---
Sheep mentaility of reddit got me downvoted. Survivors are meant to play the game and have fun and not do their objective as fast as possible just to get away with no interaction with others.
---
The Killer can't get you if they are busy laughing!
---
Now youre putting them all into one category. Not all survivor mains are like this, ive know many that are nice and know how to treat people
---
Cya loser don‚Äôt think anyone will miss you
---
Yeah, my obsession disconnected first, then another guy, then this Jane that I downed. He was at my totem and I felt bad that he had 0 chance to actually win so I let him do and find the gens.
---
I think it started as people being ironic, like overstating that something was toxic, and it snowballed.
---
It always makes me dead hard when they do that.
---
I save them for later as no threat........ It's not like they work gens or deztroy hex totems. Then I down them in the middle of corn just to taunt them.
---
Distressing, BBQ, ruin and overcharge is what I run with the doctor.
---
I will do this
---
Trapper actually makes better usage of Corrupt Intervention rather than Ruin.
---
&gt;Also using a gen-perk Billy or Nurse
---
Some people are assholes. Because I feel for you and would like to rage a little, let me share my own story:
---
We played against a Huntress, played by a 13 year old Russian kid. How do I know this? I went to their Twitch site they had as their user name on Steam. I brought a key because I wanted to prestige, and I think it's cooler to try to use items instead of throwing them away.
---
Two people die, mostly because the Huntress was a little campy and they didn't quite get it. Three Gens done. Third guy gets hooked after standing on the hatch, hopefully knowing I brought a key instead of waiting for me to get caught and sacrificed. I decide to take the risk to rescue him as he was hooked only a short distance away from the hatch, we're talking like 8 seconds of running. Huntress is nowhere to be seen which struck me as odd seeing as how they camped before. I unhook him, he gets the idea and follows me...
---
And the Killer DCs. Because he didn't want us to get the hatch.
---
Mind you, it was the killer who had brought Party Streamers.
---
When I went to their Twitch site, all I heard was a squeaky voice most likely complaining in Russian. He then started streaming Hentai after he closed the game.
---
It was fun.
---
Yeah, I've been having way more fun with killer this weekend. I'm not straight up farming, just playing a normal match, hooking everyone twice, then hanging out to farm after the least gen pops if people want more BP.
---
No, I'm not trying to grief. I'm just saying I will play normally and try to kill them. No tunneling or camping. If they come up to me and teabag as an invitation to farm, they're getting immediately hooked. Mostly they wise up after that though.
---
All I'm saying is that I ignore all attempts to farm. I'm playing the game.
---
These are fantastic!
---
Yeah I would have done the exact same thing.  It was never going to be a game for him.  Sucks that you got all those babydick toxic survivors in your lobby.  I can't wait until they punish disconnects hard on both sides as it's currently an epidemic atm.  I want a lockout timer that prohibits queuing into another game and gets higher and higher with each subsequent disconnect.
---
I play survivor and stink as killer but I'm trying. Survivors are shit bags.
---
Anytime mate. Distressing even gives more BP now so added bonus.
---
They're getting rid of iri head soon. Soon it shall be over.
---
That said, escaping through the gates against an iri+belt Huntress is one of my prouder moments.
---
Salty survivors and killers would abuse negative ratings leading to bans. Stuff like that already happens with gameplay sabotage report in Overwatch. Sure, with abusive chat reporting it's fine because they have chat logs to prove the player is being rude, but with gameplay sabotage they just have to assume the player being reported is in the wrong

---
I run it with Botany Knowledge for a bit of flexibility. I can heal myself twice, heal myself once then give it to a teammate so they can heal (they don't need any efficiency perks to fully heal). I can also wake up against Freddy twice I think with 2 full heals still.
---
I've always loved Pharmacy (:
---
What killer are you playing?
---
Of course it's not exclusive to this event, but during the event certain types of people make it a goal to ruin everyone's chance at BP. There's definitely a spike up in moris, slug builds, and camping.
---
Gotta agree, it's a two way street. It's not the general game. Some survivors are toxic af, some are great and say gg. 
---
Some killers are shitbags, others are great guys and give props at the end.
---
Yea it‚Äôs helpful
---
at what point in your life did you decide to be a waste of air?
---
In the game rendition, Meg looks like a frowning grumpy teen. However, her portrait is gorgeous.
---
If they land it means they've been scared recently.
---
Accurate totem placement too! Wow!
---
I love finding keys with Plunderer
---
If you like running hex builds then thrill. But because youre new get noed.
---
Well he said camper, 
---
meaning you were the killer and you camped,
---
which also means thats I too hate you.
---
K thanks
---
I would argue that that having more time to set up your traps is better than having less ground to cover in the first couple of minutes
---
And yes I think with all that mobility to respond to the notifications from failed skill checks, Lullaby is decent on both of them. Certainly more effective than Ruin if you want to draw the game out a bit
---
I honestly just searched for "dark comedies" on google and it was one of the ones that caught my eyes
---
Or the classic hill spot
---
The perk is weird. I've see a killer with enduring just tank a head on and act like its nothing.
---
more than 3
---
Vete al infierno, maldito camper.  T√∫ eres la raz√≥n, a veces el juego no es divertido.
---
May I interest you in the best build consisting of No One Left Behind in the first perk slot, and Left Behind in the last?
---
I'm a Billy main, and you ain't wrong. I came back to rank 20 after some time off, and my first few matches were pure fucking carnage.
---
Sweet
---
You apply it directly to the forehead.
---
I feel like I've heard that before... where is that from?
---
Good movie
---
I looked at memes
---
I've literally stunned a Killer with it in the basement and they were on the last step.
---
Yeah I forgot about that change. But totem spawns still suck ass
---
This is fucking sick.
---
hill spot can still spawn, it's just there's also an additional one near the rocks as opposed to right by the edge in the open now too
---
Best chest build? Hmm, Jane, Kate &amp; Nea. There you go.
---
With Nurse you should really just do 4 tracking perks, you don't need gen-related perks on her.
---
For Billy you really just want chasing &amp; tracking, no reason to have a gen-perk either.
---
Also due to how Trapper plays, it's much more beneficial to have your zone from the start because the survivors can't really work on gens safely in your area, which means that all gen progress is basically non-existent before Corrupt Intervention runs out, unlike with Ruin where they can just find it or work through it with 0 effort.
---
It has ‚Äúyour‚Äù twice...
---
I guess I just know how much it sucks to be camped and I hate for my teammates to feel like we're giving up on them. I always end up fucking myself over endgame trying to rescue survivors too, especially after the gates are opened. Maybe I play a bit too altruistically!
---
yay ur back shitposting here and not at dontstarve
---
Yeah you better believe you‚Äôre done playing the game lol, the Devs made sure of that.
---
You know, I had one instance where I was playing Swamp Fever and during the part really early on with the pontoon boat one of them Charged past us, going straight into the water and dying instantly. The ultimate whiff.

65 levels later, I still don‚Äôt have Monitor and Abuse on Myers. üòû

It was added a couple months ago but has been unused. Probably for something really special.
---
A regrettable misplay.
---
I have more nightmares about the Tanks than the Chargers on that one, honestly. I'd say about 75% of the time I go through the Parish and it's my first time going over the Bridge Finale I get knocked about 150 feet off side of the Bridge, dying instantly.
---
So many swamp sinkings. So many high rise window plummets. RIP good buddies.
---
You do it would seem, it's not a bad thing though. You tried to help someone for good reason. This is where you leave the game or coordinate with a teammate how to make the save. Its difficult, but that's what the game is supposed to be. Therea always a way around something if you think hard enough, and are willing to accept the results of your actions. 
---
If I'm being camped I yell at my teammates to do gens, open gates and leave because the killer is preoccupied with securing his kill.
---
I'm waiting for Hamlet. Also I'm gonna get Mk11 on may 16 after I did my graduate from IT and English. B) Tbh I'm not really keen on what to shitpost about because everyone already does.

---
Listen survfag I can make red ranks without it. I only use NOED on Freddy when I play him because SWF always break all the Totems 90% percent of the time before it's even able to activate. Let alone the 10 seconds it actually is up before the swf find it because totems typically will spawn in the same general areas on each map, up to and including right next to generators. So I don't waste the perk slot but it's still not a baby crutch. It is easily dealt with. It's one of the first things me and my friends do when I do play surv and lt literally doesn't take very long. Get the easy ones first. Light searching throughout the match for the rest. 3 are generally done right from the get go. Problem solved.
---
Yes it is easier for killers NOW, but with comms SWF generally will have a large advantage, unless of course in your case, they are potatoes.
---
Survivors can still be tanks with items and thier comms.
---
Oh you didn't win? You a bad killer, git gud baby killer. Oh you used NOED? You're a baby killer.
---
Classic survfag move.
---
Wow haha killers got so buffed and survivors got nerfed. That's why killers keep switching to survivors. Notice the lengthy amount of time it takes for surv games to find a killer? I sure do. It's one of the biggest complaints on this board. In a survivor dominant place you all can't seem to figure it out. 
---
(Insert lie that your survivor wait time is actually "really fast" and you get matches immediately)
---
You and your extra chromosome can march your survfag ass back to the cave you crawled out of.
---
we camped and tunneled his dick after pulling it off of him
---
*Laughs in Haunted Ground*
---
For real, I thought they must've changed something because I've been leveling up 3 killers this weekend and I can't get it.
---
*laughs in doesn't own spirit):*
---
Haha I do the same thing too though to be honest. As long as the killer is camping me, they can't chase the others. Frustrating as hell to be camped though, for sure!  
---
Oh well. I really enjoy the game regardless, especially when it's a good match. :)
---
I know, right? Billy makes by and far the most use out of Barbecue &amp; Chili's Aura Reading. I like to combine it with Iron Maiden to dissuade Survivors from hiding in lockers which makes catching them out of position that much faster
---
We found the toxic survivor sympathizer! You could shack up with with OP.
---
yep, ranking is fucked currently
---
I was at rank 12 but then I got into matches with my friends and I ended up having to sacrifice myself or we messed with the killer then once I got dropped to rank 14 I would constantly get facecamped, also at the end of this match he did facecamp me ironically.
---
Did you mori anyone?  
---
If you mori(or kill with tombstone) all survivors too quickly, you're probably going to depip.
---
In rainbow six siege if you disconnect in a ranked lobby you get a timed bad and a renown (ingame currency) reduction. They should implement something similar into dbd.
---
I always feel bad at rank resets because Billy with map control perks (like BBQ) is so hard to play against at low ranks. You need to work together. I get countered some what regularly once you get past rank 10 or so, but under that and it feels like Billy is unstoppable, even for experienced players trying to re-rank.
---
Very rare F
---
Have you ever had a hex totem spawn on the Crotus Penn Asylum straight out in the open? That is pure torture :(
---
Going on what you said I have a solution: for every survivor that dcs give them a stacking 10 min ban and deduct 20k bloodpoints for that survivor and give the rest of the survivors a 25% bonus to bloodpoints at the end of the match
---
It cost a bit so use it, not like it‚Äôs a darkening reagent at 3000 bps...
---
I hope i'll never see that totem spot. that's why thrill and haunted exists to protect your totems, but even then it's luck that survivors cleanse the wrong totems
---
I mean, it is not a bad perk, but it is not the best perk either. At this point I think Dead Hard and Sprint Burst are both outclassed by Balanced Landing.
---
BBQ, Enduring, Ruin, Spirit Fury.  
---
To me he's just another M1 killer.
---
The emblem system is pretty okay?
---
exposed is a fair and balanced status effect
---
I still got my point across
---
They should do a club level. It'd be fun.
---
Why is it unpopular, almost everyone runs it
---
It is
---
I've been leveling Wraith and he has 15BPS and 25Pudding but not BBQ :/
---
Imagine being 14 again and thinking that‚Äôs a good insult.
---
is it? I dont know, but if I get 0 points in 2 categories after a 4k on rank 2 or even lose a pip if I only get 3, but didnt waste enough time kicking gens, destroying pallets...Im not too sure about that
---
It's not unused, I believe that the Artifact rarity is for some specific exclusives.  
---
I know AdmiralBahroo has the "rooHappy" shirt(Dwight cosmetic) which can be bought from the Charity Case DLC, but there's another version he can give out to specific people and has a limited amount of copies.  
---
I think that Diatech also has a special cosmetic for Nea.
---
My favorite is Hard Rain, but not because of Chargers. It was the atmosphere, and the fact that is was the first campaign where it honestly felt like one mistake could be fatal in a non-bullshit way. 
---
My least favorite is actually Dark Carnival. I love, love, *love* the Concert, but two parts to me have always pissed me off--running the coaster and having to wait through a metric fuckton of Zombies to get the the saferoom before the concert. It's not as bad as Dead Air's Terminal of Bullshit and Sadness, but it's still goddamn awful.
---
Artifacts are exclusive items like the Bahroo shirt. These items are only viable via codes
---
*cough cough* FUCKING FIX NEA KARLSSON‚ÄôS CRACKHEAD FACE *cough cough*
---
If you get a 4k without getting points in 2 categories, you probably mori'd everyone pretty fast, which doesn't help determine your skill.
---
Micheal looks cool in the portrait, but the in game model looks like a party city mask
---
Hilarious. Thank you OP
---
wtf howd that happen?
---
Dont worry i will always be part of your life with your mom.
---
no its a current bug that happens sometimes...Also If the Killer absolutely stomps the survivors he still loses a pip for winning to fast
---
There's a dumb mechanic which gives survivors invincibility frames.  
---
It's really inconsistent.
---
If I play Solo on Plantation I'm usually the only one who makes it. That last Tank is fucking lethal.
---
There's a bug that stops you from getting emblem points?  
---
I have over 1k hours and never experienced it.  
---
I also have never lost a pip for stomping survivors by slugging everyone at 5 gens.
---
Hard rain was the goat. Only level that had atmosphere effects that impacted the gameplay. I remember trying to find the fastest route to the saferoom on the third and fourth levels since it was a free for all in multiplayer. Good times. 
---
I thought the coaster was fun, but the horde coming after you had to open the gates to get to the saferoom was annoying. I remember you could jump on certain spots and skip half the level in some areas. 
---
Dead air was great up until the plane arrival. I can‚Äôt think of the boat one, but that was the best one. The cornfield one was cheeks.
---
I walk away and pretend to AFK. Since i have 2 monitors, i can just wait and browse reddit on one, and watch the game on the other. Either they stop being a cunt and leave, or they come up to me and teabag, giving me a free hit.
---
This is why i run noed.
---
I'll address each one of these. I play on Xbox but have thousands of hours in this game so sorry for the wall of text.
---
1. Maps like Lery's Institute/The Game, it can be hard to find gens but you just have to keep looking. I start with the four long hallways on the hospital. There is always one in the center of the map, in the "treatment" room with the upstairs. On The Game, the infamous bathroom from the movies always has one, but keep in mind you can get caught in there very easily since there is only one door, and 50% of the time the basement can be right next to it. Repair at own risk. 
---
2. It depends on how you want to level. I have one survivor (Nea) now who has all perks. Oftentimes if you skip a perk, it will continue to show up in subsequent levels so it's best just to take it to get it off the board. 
---
3. Right now the only penalty you get for disconnecting is a loss of 2 pips. It sucks and when dedicated servers go live, there will be discussion of implementing harsher penalties since the devs can more accurately track disconnects. 
---
4. That's exactly what chases are: buying time for other survivors. My current build includes Dead Hard and Mettle of Man, which can *really* frustrate killers if used optimally. Other popular chasing perks are Lithe, Balanced Landing. Knowing how map tiles work is also a difference between good survivors and great survivors. As you play more, you'll learn the geometry and popular looping spots, as well as the difference between safe vs. unsafe pallets. 
---
5. There is no guilt in being selfish. I have had 4 person escape games turn into clusterfucks where the killer gets everyone with NOED because everyone is trying to be altruistic. If someone goes down and I get the NOED popup, I'll run around looking for the totem, keep an eye on the killer to see if he camps to secure the one guaranteed kill. **Never feel guilty about surviving**
---
6. "Surprise" skillchecks are rare, where it pops up just as you are about to stop repairing. Kinda just have to deal with it. 
---
7. Freddy's weakness comes in his transitioning people to the dream world. There are times when I'm on a gen and will start the transition, get a skill check, and pop out of it immediately. He **has** to pull you in to even hit you. Running Self Care gives you a slight edge against him cause it gives another way to pop out. I'm not sure of your experience, but failed skill checks - whether through repairing gens or healing yourself or others - pops you out of the dream world. 
---
8. I believe 4 AM is the time for a new daily rituals but truthfully I have no idea. 
---
Again, I tried to address each bullet point so sorry for wall of text, I'll be glad to clarify or answer any more questions to the best of my knowledge. Good luck in the fog! :)
---
If you have the shards I 100% recommend her, especially if you like Wraith already
---
Heeyyyy, that's pretty goooood
---
Anything that‚Äôs going to make your terror radius bigger but also perks that are core for any killer like BBQ, Ruin, Overcharge.
---
no shit sherlock
---
I've not had one game where people farm yet. Most people have so far just added a nice fat jug of toxicity.
---
eh i've gotten used to it
---
Monstrous Shrine
---
Just @ me next time.
---
Either Myers, or drift king Billy doin work in the Lerys
---
I thought I had bad internet the first day. Never had a wait as a killer before.
---
They made it so the survivor being unhooked and tunneled off hook has at least a second to try and get away before the killer can redown them. They have to regain control of their character from the unhooking animation before you can tunnel them. 
---
If you at least wait until their feet are on the ground then you should be fine to redown them.
---
pretty good job so far

That's exactly what my comment is saying. If you run no mither, you will never be slugged
---
I was joking, but okay, thanks for the pep talk regardless
---
I think someone on Reddit had an idea that ghost face could call the survivors, in which the survivor could let it ring or do a hang up animation. 
---
Both have their bonuses and cons but that‚Äôs the simple explanation.
---
Ghostface: Two bodies that can be used. So you could see them on either side of the map and have then stand there so you could switch. A cooldown of course between switching or something would be needed.
---
Well I was kinda talking for shop items but yeah that makes sense as artifacts are rare exclusive I think
---
Say what?
---
I mean I was joking, but
---
Depends on the situation. She's better at loops, but Billy will snowball harder.

mostly completionists. All my favorite Games are always brought to 100% completion or as Close as possible. At least for me, its a nice Touch, much like a little thumps up for getting something done :) honestly I care more about achievements then rank
---
Lmao if this ain't the damn truth.
---
You ask them.  
---
I believe bahroo is giving his specific shirt for 200$?  
---
You can just get the same one with lower rarity for 5$ though.  
---
PC exclusive btw
---
It was around time where dedicated servers went live on PTB, I had 3-4 man swf almost every game. It was a hard time.
---
If you're a completionist, get everyone to P3-50 with all perks.  
---
That's how you'd "complete" dbd imo.

---
This really needs more upvotes
---
Nah we need more facecamping Bubbas
---
I think it‚Äôs 2 PM?
---
What else are you supposed to do though?
---
As a mid ranked killer main rank 13-10 usually I prefer not facecamping its boring for both sides. Only time I've facecamped is against a SWF where they had 3 people saboing hooks and I just was getting tired of it. Ended up actually getting a 3k anyhow cause they messed up near the end.
---
Noed One-shots people when all the gens are done. And Thrill of the hunt gives you an indication when someone is doing a totem. And slows them down. So Noed would be better.
---
Yeah, they have two minutes to walk ten feet. If they‚Äôre anywhere close to the exit itself they‚Äôll just fall through when you hit them, doesn‚Äôt even count as a down. Survivors are going to figure out very quickly exactly how much taunting they can get in before they‚Äôre in danger.
---
Always make sure you get a perk from the bloodweb, even if it's something completely useless. This way it's guaranteed that you'll *eventually* get that one perk you want, even if it's the last one to ever appear.
---

thats something Im also Close to finishing. but that 100% Bar is something actually quite rewarding for me and probably many others

/s? I dont see a problem with exposed effect, but your comment seem sarcastic.
---
These days? Lmao you know people from pretty much all generations were offended too right? You do think people from the 90s and 80s were pretty much the same as our generation when it came to harassment and crap like that it‚Äôs just easier to see how much of it is done nowadays because of the internet
---
Tunnelsnakes rule.

So i play trapper as a killer main. As a rank 9 iv been getting alot of asshole survivors, who tbag alot during chases and so on. Well i lost one during a chase, and about a minute later they tripped on my beartrap. While in transit to go pick them up off the trap they escaped and in their frenzy to get away walked into the second beartrap less than 5 feet away. I couldnt help but laugh.

I am on day 2 of killers being total dicks during this event. I play mostly survivor and would be fine with farming but the killers are doing everything they can to suck the fun from the event. 
---
Ive gotten a few toxic survivors in my games but nowhere near the amount of toxic killers. Don't know why x2 bloodpoints seem to bring out the most toxic in people.
---
Please don‚Äôt kill me I‚Äôm stupid I can‚Äôt help it
---
Cheers
---
You arent reading what im saying, if you wanna camp and defend the hook cool but tunneling in that situation is stupid, beyond stupid. You are risking several different anti tunnel perks being triggered.
---
The chance of that is extremely rare. You'd have more of a chance getting struck by lightning.
---
If you barely chased, hit or used your power on them then you've only gotten iredescent on sacrifice, in which case you don't rank up.
---
He can get suspended for calling you gay so if you want a good laugh report them for it, lol
---
good
---
Seems like anything possible is better than the situation he got. 
---
You have a better chance of getting a kill if you hit the unhooked person if you can‚Äôt hit the first. Not everyone runs borrowed time. 
---
I‚Äôm reading what you‚Äôre saying.

Your mental health blows my mind, you are beyond help

You just have to get used to having awful teamates that do nothing. Just learn to be hppy with what you do as part of a team, if you lead the killer on a good chase or save a few teamates think about that rather than the fact you keep dying at 5 gens cause your teamates love sitting in corners

Unlucky. Whenever I find what I think is ruin it's actually haunted grounds
---
I've never had that happen before as Legion, weird. must be a bug
---
True, but it didn‚Äôt. Perks can rise from a synergy or a major change, there wasn‚Äôt any for pharmacy. Exept the fact that people want to spend less time healing, which is half the game changing and half not
---
I personally never use it and have a fuck ton of them lying around, but if I do use them I do so for only 2 reasons:
---
1) doing a daily
---
2) encountering a toxic player I came up against before
---
except that you never do that, you instead do the shit I listed.
---
Love this idea
---
Wait you can do that with the new DS? How if they can break off before the pick up animation is over. The devs will need to fix that honestly
---
Im sorry for the face camping, Im a killer main and I use devour hope during all my games. I basicly walk to the other end of the map. Buuut, and I dont mean to justify face camping, and Im prepared to get downvoted, survivors are getting much more toxic. Over a year ago, mabey one survivor camped a gate to tea bag me. Now days, its any and every survivor that doesnt die in the trial. Im constantly being messaged like "get good" "baby killer". Along with flashlight spam and other reasons, Ive been getting more and more angry at survivors. I see why killers are so angry and face camp every few games I do play survivor. Yes its the killers fault for being ass holes and camping, but as a survivor you need to stop encurageing toxic play towards killers. Please, leave when the gates are powered, dont just stand there for 5 min waiting to teabagg me out. Dont bm me with your MoM, stop messaging me with your your "your garbage, go fuck your wh**e of a mother" ( Yes, Ive had someone say that to me, also cursed at me the whole time I was playing the match because I used a green mori on him). Once again, face camping sucks, but you're ignorant to just state "Oh, Ive faced the most toxic killers Ive ever seen :( ). Sorry to put all of this on you Lightning, but this needs to be said.
---
What was the setting you changed?

For me, toxic is doing something with the only intention to ruin others fun

---
Yeah, she is. OoO and flashlight squads are rare, and when they do show up the Hag can just switch killers/bring Franklins. Just bc she has one counter that is good doesnt make her a bad killer.
---
I always get Lithe or Quick and Quiet as my first perk on every survivor and then I just never find the other. Meg can't be a ninja unless she steals that Asian girl's moves.

That's a big assumption. You don't know how I play lmao

rank doesn't mean anything anyways, all it does is make ques faster if you're low ranked
---
Is it worth it to be in a constant no mither state?
---
Frank Morrison in his trailer is the closest thing we have to that. I'm sure there will be one that is like that though. It feels like (almost) all original killers lost hope in humanity at one point and became killers
---
Your the reason that many players have stoped plaything the game. *clap clap clap*
---
Well done, I hope its worth it.
---
Because it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
Hook vacuum takes priority over a DS skill check. You literally pick up someone when they‚Äôre right under the hook and just spam your button and you‚Äôll hook them back 10/10 times.
---
Oh didn‚Äôt know that. I was thinking more about lithe, but I guess spring burst would work (if times properly).
---
Also I don‚Äôt know why the downvotes, it‚Äôs just an opinion jeez.

Must I use all of their perks?

That's what happen after The Entity being displeased

Like I said, disagree
---
Sauce is ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Hug Me I‚Äôm Scared‚Äù.
---
Me too. All my perks are anti tunnel and anti camping for now.
---
I always do it too in such cases
---
So, what I do is make sure that I announce out loud that I really don't need X perk. I'll be fine without it. Then I make a point to never think about that perk with that bloodweb open. I've found that this makes no difference and this RNG based perk acquisition system is garbage and needed to be updated a year ago. "Oh, I have all the perks I need to do the build I've been wanting to try. Guess I'll stop playing now."- Nobody.
---
I can hear these comments.
---
 I had a killer yesterday get mad at my 3 man because the ttv in our 3 man body blocked for Ash. He DC'd immediately and went to his stream to say we we're a 4 man with comms. "Thinks he's good because he can play with a four man SWF squad that has to use a 3rd party program to communicate." Is one of the 2 comments left on my steam profile from him
---
*side to side side to side
---
You see that emblem that's not lit up? There's your problem. Also looks like your chases we're not good, or camping the hook.
---
Deciding to not play the game anymore until the event is over so I stop running into other survivors who are just trolling by body blocking you into a corner or farming you off hook literally right next to the killer. That's what has made this week of Dead by Daylight gaming better - not playing it, because other people are hell.
---
They need to fix this. Let me pick my own totem spots.
---
Lithe is a god send and is far superior to sprint burst.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna downvote and move on since you think securing a kill makes you entitled. 
---
Have a good day and try to be less weird.
---
The people who think it's a good perk are the ones that get easily baited by the killer into using it lol
---
I wouldn't really say noed makes you a bad player. It's a really strong perk that can change the game massively in the killers favor, and indeed it gets used by a lot of bad killers but just because you use it, doesn't mean you are bad
---
Some killers feel bad when you don‚Äôt win so they try to make a excuse just like survivors do
---
Yep. Every killer suffers from it barring huntress.
---
I like when survivors run urban evasion, because they never have any idea of what they're doing.

---

---
I dumped soo many fucking bloodpoints trying to get lithe for Jeff
---
I would not dispute that the higher up the rank ladder you go, a game against a 4 man team becomes more difficult. However, the narrative killers tell is that games against these squads is very common. You pretty much said it yourself in your statement how survivors are afraid to play without comms. The fact is only 3-6% of games feature a 4 man SWF. Even a 3 man is only just above 10%. These stats completely go against that narrative, and prove the point that many killers falsely blame SWF every time a game doesn‚Äôt go their way....as opposed to just admitting they may have played poorly.
---
That is easily the worst totem spot of all. Feels especially bad if it's devour hope
---
It stacks with everything. Only the envelope is restricted to survivors.
---
Infectious, Distressing Knock Out and a flex spot (usually Ruin) is fun fun
---
I wish all killers were more like this. I've had so many matches like this and I never live at the end of any of them. Thanks for being a good sport.
---
I though when some stacks on the offering screen, the ones that stack shake, I notice that whenever someone has a bloody party and I have a escape cake, the cake doesn‚Äôt shake... is the cake a lie?
---
Yeah, but I only do this if a lot of people DC‚Äôd or were killed way too early in the game, otherwise  I‚Äôm going full try hard mode
---
*gets in lobby with them second time*
---
Time to accessorise with my prayer beads bracelet and my yakuyoke amulet
---
Also maybe I‚Äôll throw in a hex totem..
---
Or 2...

Or 4

Oh yeah and an ebony mori for good measure :)
---
I cant complain about snapping on campers.
---
Played against a swf group who were a little toxic, so i thought i would sneak up on the exit gate, since i knew they wouldn't leave till they have t-bagged me again, and grab a quick kill

Every bloodweb you get 1 perk, make all perks times three and you will discover the amount of levels you need.

My urban evasion wasted shit tons of time for killers when they‚Äôre trying to find me. If they know how to use it properly...
---
Good on you man. Would have done the same thing. It's not fun for anyone when a bunch of babies decide to disconnect. Happens a lot with SWF 3-stacks if one of their friends die.
---
Not all heros wear capes.
---
56 x 3 = 168
---
So 24 more bloodwebs. 
---
40k-50k per web. Call it 45k. 45 x 24 is 1,080,000 bloodpoints.
---
Yeah, I understand. I've been DC'ed like this a few times. It kind of makes me hate playing on xbox. Lol
---
Yeah. I do that too if they show back up while I'm unhooking. The killers like to ignore me a lot though to tunnel. It turns into the killer chasing them and me chasing the killer lol.
---
I still think Sprint Burst is the best. It has the most utility, and it is consistent and reliable. For starters, you use it to traverse the map faster, something Balanced Landing and Lithe cannot do nearly as reliably. This boosts general efficiency when running gen-to-gen, or going for totems or chests and such, as well as due to being able to delay running in for saves or from the killer, in effect spending more time on gens all throughout the round. Then it can be used in defensive ways, providing safety both while sitting on a gen or being out of position otherwise (such as when hiding), as well as by running in for a save or the like with your Exhaustion nearly-recovered, thus being able to sprint away into safety after doing so. It also provides this safety more so than any of the other Exhaustion perks when you yourself get saved off a hook, or healed up from the ground. It can likewise be used in offensive ways, running in for hook or flashlight and pallet saves or bodyblocks without having to expose yourself beforehand, or simply too fast for the killer to react to. And then if your Exhaustion is already halfway recovered (or more), you can reliably get it back mid-chase by micromanaging Shift (especially when using Vigil). In those ways, Sprint Burst is the only Exhaustion perk that has actually gained some form of utility from the Exhaustion mechanic changes, priming it and enabling you to get an at-will sprint by 99ing Exhaustion. Those changes also brought with it a neat tech interaction with SB that lends the Map and Key items some additional utility: while actively using the Key or Map, you can run without triggering SB, and it will instantly trigger once you let go of the Key/Map action. Finally have some use for all those Broken Keys! It's not awfully viable or anything, but I've sometimes went with a build consisting of Sprint Burst, Vigil, Streetwise + Key/Map with duration add-ons, trying to get as much use out of this interaction as possible.
---
With all that said, the Exhaustion perks each have advantages and ways of using them that are unique to them, and as such cannot be flat-out compared to one another. Choosing one depends thus also on your playstyle, overall strategic approach, chase tactics and what you feel like doing in the respective round. Balanced Landing is undoubtedly god-tier on some setups, and since more than the sprint itself the stagger reduction is what makes it so strong, you can reasonably pair it up with any of the other Exhaustion perks, including Sprint Burst. It requires the most map and tile knowledge to get the most use out of. Dead Hard is definitely the strongest chase perk of the Exhaustion perks, on paper. The ways in which it can be used in chases are numerous, be it simply to get more distance to be more greedy on loops or tile runs, to save yourself if you mess up (such as Dead-Harding into a dropped pallet if the killer swings at you, then being able to vault the pallet during the killer's cooldown), to dodge a multitude of killer abilities (hatchets, chainsaws, bear traps, ambush dashes, vomit, shocks, reappearance lunges, blinks...), or to potentially survive a seemingly hopeless situation out in the open (in this case you should try to combine DH with a 360, to at least try and bait the killer into swinging). DH also shares some of the offensive properties of SB, allowing for some clutch save plays around hooks or with pallets and flashlights. It requires the most mechanical skill to get the best use out of, and it has a big weakness in its being vulernable to latency, especially given the killer's host latency advantage. We'll see how it performs on the dedicated server architecture once it's finalized (in the PTB, it was not better...). Finally, Lithe is neat because more so than all the other Exhaustion perks, it allows you to actually somewhat-reliably lose the killer, since you will regularly break Line-of-Sight on them and then get the sprint (and this turns into something actually reliable when paired up with Dance With Me and Quick &amp; Quiet). Lithe does have its risks, since triggering it on vaults can lead to you sprinting into the killer's arms, depending on the tile, but it does also have a good reward if it does work out, which is extra distance due to the killer having to vault/go around the tile you've just vaulted, or, again, having the killer lose track of you altogether. The recent change that allows you to use it outside of chase state now also gives it some map-traversing utility. It requires the most positional awareness and tile knowledge to be used optimally, I'd say.
---
*cries in console*
---
Thanks.
---
That happened to me and he didn‚Äôt move until I dropped my item.  
---
9 minutes later were the only two survivors and he ran to me while I was opening the exit gate. I stopped at 99% and stood there while he panicked and tried to give me my med kit back,  it it was too late.  Huntress got a good hatchet in on him but I‚Äôm not a dick so we both escaped
---
Blood points are literally the only progression mechanic in the game. If they're not that important the what the fuck is? Sick YouTube montages?
---
I never get Balanced Landing. Nea is literally the only Survivor I have it on.
---
I mean yea, I pretty much found them and sawed them down instantly. Didn't kick a gen once.
---
Dunno, thought my job as a killer was to ultimately...kill?
---
Agreeee
---
&gt; running self care, urban evasion, dead hard and mettle of man 
---
No, a toxic survivor build is DS, Mettle, Adren, balanced landing with a map offering for haddonfield and an insta heal/BNP/flashlight.
---
I farm during blood hunts, full stop. If survivors don't want to farm with me they can leave. It's not like disconnecting is rare anyways.
---
Adorable!
---
Good story. Makes me feel alright. Still gonna go play STALKER until this blows over.
---
C^l^^u^^^b^^^^9^^^^^6
---
Events always make people play like assholes. It‚Äôs made the event pretty frustrating.
---
Is it bad manners to slug a teabagger?  
---
Every time I excounter one I tunnel as hard as I can to keep him downed so that he lays there to think about what he‚Äôs done.
---
I think it's 4. Three was the butterfly singing about love.
---
Depends on the playstyle and the map. I personally prefer balanced but sometimes you get a map with no/few dropdowns and windows everywhere. dead hard is great, but only if you know how to use it properly, and an extra second or two doesn't help much if you suck at looping.
---
Yeah, sorry. Sarcasm doesn't carry well online.

I read this is as ‚ÄúWeird Al fanboys/fangirls‚Äù and was waiting for some of his music to pop up. I‚Äôm so disappointed rn. Good clip though lol

Lmao soryyyy

---
It is. But it takes more to rank up than just relying on bad survivors.

Justice!
---
Imo anyone who can be traditionally looped outside of billy isn‚Äôt high tier. Myers is definitely strong but against decent survivors he‚Äôll have trouble.
---
It really depends on your playstyle. You can play him like every m1 killer, shocking house, 3 gen strategy ect... there are many ways to play Herman Carter
---
i play with a controller and it frustrates me trying to get the hang of killer, so i don't even bother trying to play seriously - but i love those killers that will play seriously all the way through but not death-hook people. i think that's the best of both worlds tbh, you're not being crazy toxic like the killer in the OP and you're not also bored the whole game if you don't happen to enjoy farming.
---
It really does
---
The very slight buffing of killer‚Äôs being able to deal with loops as time has went on has meant there‚Äôs less time for the heal at every pallet for 2% with self care that eventually actually heals the survivor mid chase. With the introduction of perks like Bamboozle and Spirit Fury, people need to be a little more time efficient, Self Care was convenient but a time waster.
---
Omg why does this sub always cross over with rpdr, they‚Äôre literally t two favourite things and it‚Äôs the most unexpected thing ever
---
Wait, is this photoshopped? It's barely noticable /s
---
I'm joking, I just try to make people chuckle, I have no intension on making anyone feel sad. For what it's worth, I like the meme
---
That's why I always gen rush unless I see other survivors actually doing stuff, then I try to do a little of everything and have more fun.
---
I have played since beta also man, doesn't mean anything. I remember when people were speedhacking the game to move at mach 5 as trapper and also had level 30 characters during beta lmao
---
It sucks when that happens but at the same time the killer has no reason to leave an area (especially the basement) if survivors are just constantly throwing themselves at them. If you establish a pattern of throwing yourselves at hooks immediately the killer's going to start hanging around to see if they can spot someone.
---
Killers assume anyone that works together even a little bit is a SWF. I‚Äôve been called a try hard swf because I got a flashlight save while someone else opened the gate for us.
---
It is yours son , see ya tomorrow , ill prepare breakfast for you.
---
If you feel so horrible about it get better internet or stop playing killer...
---
Don't understand the down votes. You didn't buy the game to farm. They still get twice as much both than any other time. If you want to farm that's fine, but if the other side doesn't want to be a part of it, you can't be upset by it at all. If you are that's only because you feel like you're entitled to it. Which is childish.
---
whispers 1 specifically is the most useless killer perk in the game.
---
He wasn't.  my friend was looping him for  the 3 gens before he dcd.  Didn't even tier up during that entire chase
---
A lot of terror radius perks work. Because your TR is giving you passive benefits anyway, milk them for all they're worth! Coulrophobia, Unnerving Presence, if you're insane you can use Overhwelming Presence, Infectious Fright, all the good stuff. A great meme is to use Nurse's Calling with Distressing and Calm add ons, since the huge terror radius at almost all times means that a good portion of survivors won't stop healing until they have LOS...unless, of course, it's the Game, which is where our good doctor shines. Skill Check perks like Ruin, Lullaby, Unnerving, etc., are also great choices thanks to the random location. With add-ons like Order, pallets become less of a hassle once broken, so Brutal Strength and Fire Up. With add-ons like Discipline and Restraint, tracking is no issue, so you can save more space for what you want. A really nice perk is Save the Best for Last, since his chase potential is minimal outside of his shocks, so the ability to keep pressure in the chase is immense.
---
I have been playing with this perk for the last week, and while it is fun when it works it just DOESN'T work sometimes. Any situation where it works against the killer it might not work in the same exact situation, I am dead serious. It's hot garbage.
---
Balanced landing even though most of the time I use it the map is shit
---

Am I getting deja vu or was this posted earlier
---
Lol, true
---
I would have tunneled and moried him with Legion.
---
That's because killers that wanna get to rank 1 ( for the achievement ) now get punished for letting you escape...
---
Games were a lot friendlier back in the days...
---
Once again, Im sorry I posted this all on you (pun not intended). Perhaps I will make an actual post regarding my concerns. The thing is, once there's four survivors grouped together, even if they dont interact with one another, suddenly one or two get the confidence to be asses and then the others follow suit. 
---
I dont know any thing about you lightning. The killer has to witness it all alone. 
---
Unless they go and complain about it on reddit, (which is basicly what im doing), they have no one to confide in and address issues with how they are being treated. You could argue that killer toxicity is worse because things like camping and tunneling actualy effect the game, but I feel that both survivor and killer toxicness is ballanced. If a killer has a bad game where they get no kills and only 6 hooks, there already down, but then to have 4 flash light clicking teabagers going on and on not leaving unless the killer hits each of them two to three times really just ingraines it into the killers head how bad they did and makes them feel worse about themselves. Ultimately toxicity is killing this game. I can feel it and others have felt it, every SWF four flashlight squadet group I face makes me want to play the game less and less. I cant change how I play, and I cant change how others play the game, but I do see four survivors for every game Im in and at least two of them should at least try not be dicks. Saying Ive faced a lot of toxic killers during this event does nothing but deter people from playing killer more and more because there is at a minnimum twice the toxicity from survivors than from killers and anytime anyone brings that up they get downvoted to hell becuase no one wants to hear thwir side be the bad guy. The side with the scarry mask is supposed to be the bad guys. So they are treated that way.
---
Honestly I dunno either, I was like "hoooow dafuq" xD
---
yup hopefully \^\^
---
It does suck. Thanks for understanding. I'm not expecting people to baby me by farming everytime party streamers are offered, but even before the event the campers I rank into at my rank were rampant.
---
Take a gold!
---
Nah bro pretty sure it‚Äôs your mom flat and all also stop replying already man I like girls
---
You've escaped... wow
---
Because I believe it‚Äôs 32 seconds self caring. And pharmacy is faster than 100% speed, so a wound healing with self care is more than twice as bad
---
wheres the nea one
---
to be honest i don't know all the changes they made to him, but he needed a rework imo. chases were just so boring because he could ignore everything you can do as a survivor - kinda like nurse, but with nurse you at least need some kind of skill and can be outplayed.
---
when a legion just follows you backwards with bloodhound theres nothing you can do really...
---
At last, I may die peacefully, my art has been used in a shitpost xD
---
I would kill to these turn into enamel pins 
---
I need it
---
Fuck, ill become a doctor so fast
---
Yeah, but I forgot to put a flair &amp; so I just reposted it with a flair.
---
Taking a long time to rework and change things is a much more valid complaint. But your original comment was releated to the chapter/DLC releases.
---
Bing bong bitch!
---
[deleted]
---
Just admit it , you dont like when i sleep with your mom.
---
When the double bloodpoint event started I poured all of my BP into spirit, and literally the first perk I got in her bloodweb was BBQ and Chilli, and then like 3 levels later I got Ruin.
---
RNGesus has blessed me for his gift
---
I‚Äôd had every intention of playing all day today and just said ... nah. Go out on a high note. It was a fun, mostly fair, two days so today was bound to be a shit show.
---
Extremely annoying as a survivor. Not sure how killers feel.
---
If you DC as killer, do they still lose their offerings? 
---
If so, they'll probably put the bonus offerings up knowing they will get big points.
---
You have them on the 2 game long con.
---
Chacha real crutch
---
If they joined my lobby they‚Äôd be in for a VERY bad time
---
Soon as I saw it, I knew it was an opportunity. I was gonna use Quentin, but then I thought this joke would be better. Glad you approve of it!
---
"if you change everything about the art style, these would be pretty good." https://i.imgur.com/dLfPsSw.jpg
---
I seem to be the only one that noticed the survivor had a Mori. Nerf survivors, too op
---
Did 2 and half gens, got 2 saves and a heal, got chased to max, never went down, opened the exit gate and escaped. Iridescent in every category. Solo.
---
Ew
---
The director of Endgame have said that you are allowed to throw out spoilers on monday. So if you haven't watched it by now it's all on you.
---
Literally just learn to do ruin skillchecks
---
Wow, you had a good game solo... as most of the people sometimes has... wow... amazing
---
But it only activates once NOED pops sooo what
---
Counterplay is don't slug at 1 gen.
---
still a dick move, and i have seen the movie.
---
they made him a normal speed killer when not using frenzy and made frenzy not worth using 90 percent of the time so basically just the wraith who wont use their power half the time
---
I feel like saying gg is enough to ruin their expectations of a salty post-game chat.
---
Then why you so mad? I'm not allowed to share a game where I did well? If you don't care then why watch it and comment? You could ya know just fuck off lmao. Douche.
---
BRUTAL
---
basically any 1 of the nerfs to legion could have fixed the issue 
---
but all of them stacked on together make legion really weak
---
well when 4-man SWF make up literally 5% of the matches it's hard to believe that every match is comprised of them.
---
Even more so when you consider how much of that 5% isn't just 4 friends who play the game casually wanting to have fun together.
---
Didn't know Bin Laden was a survivor
---
Well, i just think that its littering the sub reddit. This is public subreddit so i can give my opinion, guess you are the one to be mad tho.
---
I‚Äôve had my best DBD games during this event.
---
I'm just scared they're going to get rid of his built-in slow and aura-reading. I don't want that.
---
I get lucky with the haunted grounds, however, when I do a full totem build: TOTH, Devour Hope, Ruin and Huntress Lullaby/Third Seal, it's always the only totem I care about that gets destroyed: devour hope
---
livejournal.com bud
---
Cool idea
---
Rush the gens, and find out if the killer has noed afterwards is a better tactic then preventing noed. Change my mind
---
I dont want to argue those statistics that BVHR put up, several of them like the rank one survivor survival rate has been proven, not false, but not entirely accurate. The probelm is is that its not just 4 man SWF, its groups of 3 man SWF, or two groups of 2 man SWF. Im not saying SWF is my problem, Im saying that survivors need to show at least a little respect towards killers.
---
Kinda like mortal Kombat
---
No shit, it‚Äôs like survivor mains are playing killer badly. They would have earned more BPs sticking with survivor.
---
So if it's a 4 vs 1 it makes a difference?
---
Okay, I have a dumb brain so I was like _TIME WARP?!_
---
It's more like they added new (good) totem spots, but have not removed many of the bad ones.
---
The next step in increasing the totem viability is making a generator line of sight check
---
Ok i'll take your advice to my heart.     
---
not
---
Obvious b8. Counterplay to adrenaline is tunneling
---
you need to know what kind of exhaustion perks survivors are running so you won't get fooled twice by them. when to hide your red stain, moonwalk and doubleback to mindgame survivors. if you have a hard time getting looped, i recommend you running perks like Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle and Brutal Strength. don't try to mindgame a loop where survivors can 100% see you, it's pointless, just chase them until you get a hit on them or they throw that pallet down + never respect pallets, you'll get hardly punish for that and you'll waste a lot of your time. perks like Whispers, Stridor, Bloodhound are great if you're losing survivors easily. also, if you're scared getting "genrushed", just take perks like Corrupt Intervention, Ruin (if you want to protect it, use Thrill of the Hunt), Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby, Surveillance, Discordance. Thanaphobia, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's and Monitor are great to pressure survivors and keep them off gens. if you want to hardly punish survivors after doing gens, perks like NOED, Blood Warden, Remember Me and Bitter Murmur are great at getting them in the endgame. you also need to know your killer's power, how to properly use it and their add-ons. hope i helped you, somehow, you just need to keep practicing.
---
Someone‚Äôs not taking a meme how it‚Äôs supposed to be taken :(
---
It‚Äôs not that I have the doctor, but if they slug at a 3v1 with no gens done then 
---
‚Ä¢One person is downed 
---
‚Ä¢One person is trying to save
---
‚Ä¢if it‚Äôs doctor, the last guy has probably been found and is being chased
---
This leaves no one doing objectives, and this will just continue unless the doctor is getting seriously outplayed.
---
Sad not to see ace but great work nonetheless!
---
You gotta give them credit for that, it was a fast change considering how slow the Freddy rework, Legion bugs and dc bug are.
---
Balanced landing as survivor and ruin as killer
---
I don't play toxic but it's been multiple games now where the killer just doesn't wanna leave lol
---
I made this when drunk, plz no judge
---
What‚Äôs the hate on BL for, when DH usually doesn‚Äôt work and can be easily predicted by killers?
---
Why the repost?
---
Oh man, the whole thing is amazing. One of those things I wish I could watch again with fresh eyes.
---
That's the thing, you can't do more stuff when the killer is constantly behind you :(
---
Hmm what do you mean by slug.
---
And how is it docs fault if it's a 3 vs 1?
---
Did it post twice? I got a notice saying it didnt. My bad man
---
I will give it a try from now I think
---
Only when you are the killer. When you are the survivor, the totem is spawned in invisible and remains invisible for 5 mintues before the Entity becomes generous and makes it visible.
---
&gt; Run perks to slow the game down.
---
The bloodweb literally doesn't give me any. I get unrelenting, shadowborn, third seal, devour hope, unnerving presence, etc. It's like a meme in the sense that I genuinely get nothing of value. My webs are too congested with garbage for me to get anything that will actually help me.
---
&gt;Billy, Spirit and Nurse are great with map pressure.
---
So I understand, but I have zero experience with all of them and always get obliterated trying to practice with any of them at purple rank, and then I subsequently get too frustrated and quit the game before I can really start to learn anything. I know about stuff like backrevving with billy but never find the opportunity to apply it.
---
Hillbilly has good mobility and an instadown so its not enough to be fully healed against him and everyone not near an infinite is a viable target to him
---
The resemblance is uncanny
---
BILLY YES
---
Exactly, Sidney/Randy would be a better fit. Hell even Noah/Brooke would be better than this Deion guy.
---
Yeah I always reward the people who stick it out and actually play the game. Fuck the little bitch boy leavers, dude.
---
Why the pig ring?
---
I'm okay, thanks for asking. :)
---
Are you sure?
---
Yeah! Worked hard to p3 him just for the head cosmetic. I think it's the best one.
---
It could be fun to drop rank and try out other killers, to get better. It‚Äôll likely provide more opportunity for growth and less frustrating.
---
There was no hate on doc just that he is doc, meaning pretty good. Like we already had 2 handicaps and then he slugged us. That's where my frustration/salt came from.
---
sad day
---
We'll make it is one of the best perks in the game hands down. The time saved is insane and really aids against basements.
---
Amen
---
it sounds like you were preventing them from doing the gens... which is kind of what the killer is supposed to do
---
It takes a large and consistent amount of reports before you get punished in Overwatch. If every single match you play is filled with salty killers/survivors then the pattern is because of you.
---
Sorry, I usually only play things that take skill. Like nurse with no perks and still being able to down everyone with 5 gens left. :)
---
Holding the game hostage is deliberately refusing to participate in gameplay to draw the game out for longer than normal. What you were doing was playing smart and not chasing Survivors from the last three gens.
---
Don't listen to entitled Survivor's who think they deserve everything :^)
---
Yo, me too for a week.
---
technically  no  but it is a dick move as long as you  aren't holding them where they can do  no gens or leave or die like body blocking the basement for hours your fine
---
Nope. Entitled survivors being salty
---
I had a Blendette literally sit in the corner of a loop after I spotted her out with BBQ amd continue sitting there until I walked up and bodyblocked her with chainsaw revving. Did not move an inch.
---
In the lobby I was told I would be "reported for body blocking". I can't make this stuff up.
---
Slippery Meat was good when Trapper was only one of three killers but now he's one of fifteen so... oofie woofie
---
If you DC during the match yes they do I believe.
---
"It's fine, people will take a hit for me!"
---
\*proceeds to being saved then the rescuer runs away\*
---
As a 5'7" I feel offended
---
Exactly. Being a killer is tough. Especially if you can play killer and play respectfully every time even with disrespectful survivors in the game. It takes experience to get passed that.
---
Yeah it's in no way you're fault nor is there any dickery going on. They fucked themselves over.
---
yeah, that sucks a lot but what i can recommend you is to try and get the same perk if it's appear in your bw again so you won't bother with it anymore (even if it's a trash perk like Unrelenting) 'cause you won't waste so much time in it. also, don't try to get other killers' teachable that fast 'cause it will take you a lot of time and patience to have everything on every killer.
---
Just had the biggest adrenaline rush of my DbD playing career.
---
Load in &amp; see that I'm Dying Light. Fuck. I manage to mostly hide trying to play it super safe &amp; a gen gets done before I'm found, okay, so far, so good. Get found, chased, downed, hooked, facecamped &amp; hit on hook. A brave Ash gets me off hook and I run, and of course she tunnels me. I keep telling my boyfriend to just do gens, just do gens, I'm buying as much time as I can, I will struggle to my last second if I have to.
---
Get downed, hooked again. Ash again gets me off hook, goes down in the process, and I run. She misses swipes at me a few times, and then hits me but I have Mettle of Man.
---
I finally get away and then realize I shouldn't heal, because I don't want her to see me. I manage to help finish two gens &amp; run her around more to ensure an exit gate was opened, then get downed running to an exit gate &amp; die.
---
BUT I DIED IN SERVICE! 5 gens done + an exit gate opened before I surrendered.
---
Bro what
---
Do you always host the game?
---
Great cosplay. 10/10
---
As soon as I saw the title I knew it was going to be a doctor post. 
---
I actually heard of a [case on the steam community](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915801601135/?ctp=3) of one doctor who got in trouble for 3-genning but he was blatantly holding the game hostage and refusing to hit survivors even when a dev was on the match. [Another thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915796880365/?ctp=1)
---
Doc was actively holding the match hostage and refusing to hit survivors even when they were out in the open. I've had 40 minute + games as doc and while I 3-gen to hell and back, I still go after survivors when I can safely do so. I don't take obvious bait to lead me away from the gens and protect them by disengaging once I'm being lead away. 
---
Anyways 3-genning (even ultra defensively) is typically not holding the game hostage. As long as you're playing with the intent to win, even if you drag it out a long ass time and not just hitting gens and doing nothing else.
---
Never nut so hard
---
If you are nothing without Hex: Ruin, you shouldn't have it.
---
its not a dick move if they fuck themselves by doing badly placed gens
---
&gt; Billy makes by and far the most use out of Barbecue &amp; Chili's Aura Reading.
---
I'm real happy for you and I'mma let you finish, but Omegablink Nurse is the best BBQ abuser of all time. Of ALL TIME!
---
Perfection
---
What do u mean by slugging.  Or do you just mean he hit you.
---
 I was asking about the hate because you mentioned sweat so I assumed you were talking about people playing doctor killer were sweaty and saying not hugged enough. So I thought I'd ask
---
Nooo pig is actually one of the best at tracking survivors. Use Whispers and monitor &amp; abuse. Approach a generator that you think survivors are working on, as soon as you see whispers pop up crouch, then you can get the jump on them as they‚Äôre working on it and it‚Äôs an easy free hit
---
Fucking same lol. I am always companioning about camping it some shit but I can't help but come back.
---
Probably neither
---
That was the dumbest dc I‚Äôve ever seen
---
I seem to never get the latter
---
Same. There's so much shit that's wong with the game but I keep playing it anyway.
---
I have noticed a lot more trappers lately for some reason. Did he get buffed?
---
i would be perfectly satisfied with all of those. i really do hope we get a meta horror movie geek one day, as well as a stereotypical blonde bitchy girl like Brooke. Kate LOOKS a lot like that but its far off personality wise. id really love a character like that
---
Not really useful since not a lot of people hide in lockers, esp on higher ranks. It's very situational I would say, I only got it to work like 2 or 3 times.
---
You sound like someone who picks Ash in R6, rushes, gets killed first and then blame the team who was droning for safety and didn't back you up.
---
Apart from clothes apparently it's supposed to give you the higher tier items at earlier levels
---
No no no, 11/10
---
:)
---
Oh, I've already unlocked every killer perk outside of Lightborn and Tinkerer (I got Enduring from the shrine a while back), and I do at least grab one perk per web. The only issue is I still end up seeing that same perk twice more after that.
---
Just an everyday thing for me. You also have a very nice day! &lt;3
---
If pkaying against a good SWF, slugging is the only goddamn way you're going to maintain map pressure. Ain't nine of them gonna let you get a saw off unless you're running an insta variant.
---
I'm a doc and I plan my 3-gen from the second the match starts. I don't just let all gens get done but I try to prioritize protecting my "desired" 3-gen much more to ensure the final 3 gens are those.
---
None, you just get bloody cosmetics. I feel like it‚Äôs just a mechanic to give some of the real long-time players something to sink their bloodpoints into.I refuse to prestige any of my characters until some actual reward for it is implemented.
---
Are you on xbox? I can get a rank reset practically on command due to a bug at least 100 days old.
---
Yeaa ive noticed, I use to main her then for some reason I really wanted Legion just because I heard he was "fast" defiantly going back to Piggy Amanda üê∑üê∑üê∑
---
Thank you so much!
---
Lmao I love it
---
i was playing with my friends. one of us was dead. 2 gens left. we were all injured and one was getting chased by a camping Myers. i had a key. me and my friend finished a gen so i immediately ran away to find the hatch... he follows me and points. Myers is right there with our friend, chasing him. and the hatch was quite literally right by the gen we had just finished. so i opened the hatch and we all escaped. imagine if i had been just a tiny bit slower. one of us wouldve diddly died
---
Imo, you should play with them anyways. Going up against more skilled killers is a great way to improve, and that'll help them catch up to your skill level faster.  
---
There's no harm in losing.
---
So true
---
And thats smart. And a very effective tactic with doctor
---
üôÇ
---
Take my upvote bro...
---
Help, I'm in this meme and did not approve.
---
Are we seeing the same portrait because what I'm seeing is a Meg with 20 frown lines
---
Dwight is giving me American Psycho vibes
---
How do you mean? We play SwF
---
oh, i see. like i said, you need to get the same perk over and over again so you won't bother with it anymore, get tier 3 for every perk that appears in your bw (even if you have the chance to get like T3 Agitation and T1 BBQ, go for Agitation so you have better chances to find BBQ in your bw after that)
---
No, PC
---
E x a c t l y. DBD is like the abusive ex I keep crawling back to for more for some demented, masochistic reason.  No matter how much it makes my blood boil most of the time.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
I‚Äôve yet to depip when chased the whole game but what I‚Äôve done is at the beginning of the match I hop on a gen immediately so that if I do get chased all game i won‚Äôt depip
---
Well there are only 57 Killer perks in the game, so you should be AT LEAST halfway there.
---
This game and smash are the only games I get really into. Dead By Daylight makes me toxic though. I feel it.
---
Why is it called a God pallet anyway?
---
But according to the lore, it actually feeds on your emotions, not your soul
---
The person who invites the others is the one who's weighted when it comes to finding games to play. If another player is the one who invites you, it should lower your rank a little bit.
---
I believe.
---
I told them the same thing, I picked which ones I was going to protect from the start.
---
I dont see the problem with farming at all, this game has become so extremely grindy with 6 new perks every 3 months that it has made this games only goal to acquire bloodpoints. Now if the devs took perks out of the bloodweb and implemented a new system on getting new perks, and making perk progression based on achieving goals with said perk equipped then farming would not be as imperative. The only things that should be on the bloodweb at this point are addons, items, and offerings...
---
Beautiful
---
You realize that multiple people were experiencing this problem this morning? My connection as killer is host. I should have 0 ping. I normally have decent connection. Shoo.
---
Someone once accused me of speed hacking, on ps4 xD
---
'Not important' as in, you'll get the BP you need eventually. No need to rush and spend hours playing boring games.
---
What you and other farmers are doing is essentially saying 'hey let's play on cheat mode for a bit to get more points'. 
---
I'm saying cheat mode is boring, and isn't actually playing the game. You'll get the points eventually and have fun along the way. If you don't actually enjoy playing the game why are you playing it.
---
really? I never heard that and I dont get why that would make sence but I'll give it a try. thanks!
---
That totem is amazing! Anyone know where I can buy a good replica like that? I‚Äôd love to have it for Halloween!
---
Exactly! I'm a bit disappointed in the community to be honest. If you find yourself in a position where you're shitting on people for just wanting to play the game as intended, you've surely lost your way. It's like an addiction to bloodpoints which has made them lose reason.
---
Other games have a way of making sure that unintentional disconnects are not counted. This includes Overwatch. So I don‚Äôt see it being an issue.
---
This cracked me up a bit.
---
You shouldn't quit because of something like that, when you start a game you should be committed to seeing it through, and even though you're at a disadvantage it's still possible to come out with a positive result. Should a football team quit because they let a goal in the first few minutes of a match? No.
---
The full link is [http://prntscr.com/nku7m2](http://prntscr.com/nku7m2) if someone feels unsafe of clicking it, it's from the lightshot domain.
---
I have put so many BP during this event into spirit and all I still can‚Äôt find it üôÑ
---
That mentality of not wanting survivors getting points is obnoxious as hell, and frankly sad, thats an individual that only wants fun for themselves and no other...
---
But I prestiged him because the bloody skins are the only ones licensed Killers will ever get. üò≠
---
I wanted to object to the first step but then I read the rest.  No objections, 10/10 instructions very clear
---
yea that was a weird thing he put in there
---
* **Rule 7** - Spam
---
* Excessive self-promotion - Follow Reddit's 1:10 guideline (1 self-promotion / self-content submission per every 10 submissions) and actively participate in other posts and discussions if you would like to promote yourself or someone you represent on /r/deadbydaylight.
---
That's a dope case.
---
Oh no, no hate on doc. By slugging I mean he downed 1 then moved on until he got all of us downed then proceeded to hook us. Yes you can outplay this but my teammates weren't healing enough to where I could do a run by pick up.
---
Interesting choice of perks. Where exacrly did you get that ?
---
This is the one thing I'm mad about in this game - a killer disconnect early on makes the survivors depip.  
---
Killer DCs shouldn't happen too often though.
---
Disagree, I think Freddy is mid tier. His stall, stealth, good m1 mindgames, and tracking makes up for his weaknesses IMO
---
Legion definitely.
---
Yeah that's why I asked who hosted. I was rank 20 and my friends were both 5 and I hosted. They bamboozled a rank 20 killer. It's weird there's no balancing in mm with swfs but it is what it is.
---
No that‚Äôs just a boring game. You did nothing wrong though
---
If the killer dc‚Äôs it will say you lost a plip but you really haven‚Äôt it should still say you‚Äôre 14
---
It isnt a buff IMO, the 115% doesnt make up for all of the nerfs he's getting.
---
I'm just wondering why I didn't at least the safety pip but I didn't even get that
---
Freddy is the worst killer in the game.  
---
That's because all his ability does is allow him to interact with survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gotten that but I‚Äôve had a few say ‚ÄúlEaRn HoW tO pLaY tHe GaMe RiGhT nOoB‚Äù
---
All I have issues with is the fricken grab animation is janked, you can't grab someone and they get some really good distance on you in some cases
---
Bahahahahaha!
---
Can't wait to see Ash!
---
Freddy does Legion's job better than Legion, change my mind.
---
Or we used it and yet we still got hit. Or the killer just waits for us to use it. Or the distance it gives us is simply not enough. It's not a bad perk, it's unreliable. I switch it up with BL from time to time.
---
As survivor I had a totem spawn on the 2nd floor of Ironworks in a corner once. Like you'd never check that place unless you were loot hunting or running BL.
---
If you hover over the bloodpoint symbol at the top it tells you how many hours are left.
---
Where's set 1?
---
This game sucks to come in as a new player. It's pretty offputting at times with some of the toxic players. Also, trying to learn a new killer can be painful. Clearly the level 5 Spirit is going to suck, saying so in the post-game chat isn't exactly insightful.
---
Everything you said is definitely spot on, though.
---
I just played against a Billy who was nice enough to not completely crush us 3v1. After a while my teammates died but twice when I was downed before he deliberately took weird and offlandish routes to hooks to let me wiggle my way out.
---
When it was just us 2 in the end I managed to sneak around him and finish the 2nd gen to make the hatch spawn but he discovered me just as I finished it. I bolted for the shack and Jesus Christ there was just sitting beyond the window. I don't know if he didnt stomp me during the last chase on purpose but he was really nice in post game chat (don't speak Russian sadly).  
---
Thanks for not destroying my soul Billy, I won't forget it
---
It was awarded to me when I escaped my 100th trail against Amanda. I couldn‚Äôt just throw it out üòÇ
---
Please get some help. Then you can return to The Fog.
---
I honestly can't remember the last time I went against a brand new part, they aren't nearly as good as they used to be, you'll get more gen progress by using extra charges and repair efficiency.
---
Idk why would you not want to go against flashlights, they are so weak and easy to play around, I'll take 4 flashlights over medkits and toolboxes anyday of the week.

Thanks! The survivor perks are the one's I use the most. I'm a green medkit hoarding, gen jockey Quentin main.
---
For killer, it's mostly the perks I have a soft spot for when I was learning killer.
---
The one thing I noticed is that despite another survivor having a obsession perk (Ds) someone else who has no obsession based perks will be the obsession.
---
Just tell them before the game starts that you want to farm so they can leave the lobby
---
Oh shit I love this!
---
Idk, I have a lot more fun as killer than I do survivor.
---
How? I'm the killer.
---
To be fair Mettle is pretty bs. Not nearly as bs as moris, far from them. 
---
But if you are playing as an M1 killer, there isn't much you can do against it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but I think it has to do something with the many possible ways you can extend the chase in the killer shack. I believe most people would use it midway through the match

That video sums it up, there's comments that are helpful if you're finding issues with finding the settings.
---
Great points thank you. I like that the Plague introduced a competitor to Ruin as a guaranteed-uptime middleman.
---
Why does meg look like Tom cruise
---
Im a main killer, red rank hag/billi (now learning spirit) and I really enjoy the game. I know the issues with the game, but still enjoy
---
A perfect DH can extend the chase forever, like if you get another loop at killer shack with it. But that happens like 1/25 times you use DH lol
---
Write them privately I guess. I‚Äôm always glad when someone tells me they want to farm so I can dodge :D
---
They definitely do, but in terms of Xmas Sweater Lewd it's all about Kate and her jiggle physics.
---
&gt; It's fine if killers don't have as much fun as survivors
---
I mean, no it's not. If playing killer isn't fun, there won't be any killers.

Play as solo survivor for one day and tell me if you had any fun. I usually don't.
---
Thank You ‚ù§

He's getting one though
---
I like using Pharmacy to farm medkits c:
---
I wish they'd buff it so that it has a small chance of granting a purple medkit, or have it give you some add ons with the medkit.
