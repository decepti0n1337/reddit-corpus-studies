I love matches like that lol
---
---
---
hmmm, Maybe the MoM nerf was a bit too strong, he's now as situationnal than unbreakable, tenacity, vigil and many more, it requires so many protection hits  (who'm already badly programmed to be aware if you protected someone or not) and is absolutetly pointless against killers with one shot potential (it already kind of was but at least you had unhooks for tokens). the perk was good in the idea and can be useful for well cordinated SWF but it's totally worthless for solo players, so it's basically a perk who makes swf stronger and is no use for solo players.
---

---
Kind of odd when we know the survival rate between those two.
---
They smoking that good-good
---
No, plague doesn't rhyme with cake at all. Like, not even a little bit.
---
just completed the last level and all i can say is this: FUCK THE FUCKING FUCK 4K BASEMENT CHALLENGE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. thanks for listening
---
Except one side loves to play the victim so much
---
I completely agree
---
Literally happened to me not too long ago, the boost from the hit was enough to get me out lol. Only time Ive ever activated it
---
Sounds good to me. 
---
But afterwards can we get a rework for the Flashlight's add-on set? Almost all of them have either unnoticeable or pointless effects.
---
Whenever I play doctor I love getting pallet stunned just for the lil giggle
---
I mean a good 90% of the posts that make it to the top of the page are memes; but they def didn’t just make it there because they were low quality and relatable a lot of the memes on here I really enjoy because they’re self made not reposted which is in no sense low effort.
---

---
Do I get it? Yes.
---
Do I wish it wasn’t the case? Also yes.
---
I love playing Claudette, Mainly for a select few cosmetics (p3 head, Military Coat, and L4D pants), and I usually try to do everything from saving my mates and doing gens to distracting the killer or occasionally helping the killer find super toxic survivors. I play for good times, and as of late it’s been getting harder for whatever reason, likely due to an increase in toxicity and whatnot. I love the game and all but *damn.* The going gets tough
---
Yeah im at rank 30. Fuck that.
---
I love your artstyle! Stunning! ♡
---
I suck at killer so I’ll never complete these.
---
Yeah taking a meme is more effort then posting 32k perfect games or salty messages.
---
What about Nea in Ikea?
---
First 2 are obviously hints towards a future survivor and killer.
---
The 3rd seems to be trying to show that even with all of his power the archives dude has, even he has no idea how to escape the entity.
---
I think that it shouldn't ignore exhaustion and if you can't use it in the moment then the game just doesn't care but that it can be combined that goes with every perk in the game
---
You’ve heard of ash in smash, but have you heard about nurse wearing a purse
---
It's an enjoyable meme op
---
totems are a gold mine for perks
---
Ew
---
Oh shit dbd leaked the beginning of my next psychedelic techno album
---
It was a nice video, good job!
---
There’s nothing about this that I didn’t like
---
You seem like the type of guy to think dead hard is overpowered and that Dstrike has No WaY tO cOuNtEr It
---
Eh, there's already at least 2 things in place -- the inability to gain Bloodpoints during the camp as well as actively lowering the Chaser emblem progress, thereby lowering the chance the Killer pips or even safety pips, since a full 2-minute camp should guarantee 3+ gens being completed, meaning very low Gatekeeper.
---
The problem is people that do this probably don't care about their rank or are especially concerned about Bloodpoints.
---
I've had multiple ultra rates spawn near the middle of the circle, they are not required to spawn at the edges of the web.
---
It may not be helpful. The game can be pretty unbalanced, but if you look at every match, fair or unfair, as experience, it helps. I play killer sometimes and it can get really frustrating when playing against swf or more experienced players. But playing against ppl more experienced than you will help you become a better player, more than playing against your equals or those less experienced. 
---
Don’t quit and try not to let unfair games get yo you too much.
---
eh who has the energy to use their brain
---
well i use the to get characters or perks so it is an issue for me if i go from 300 to 85 :/
---
thank you!
---
Too OP, can cause Killers to curl up and cry in a corner when thrown at them
---
Imagine just getting the bare minimum to keep the franchise going and still choose to release films and games that you can tell really just have 0 love in them. 
---
As enthusiastic I am for her you are right they’re just rereleasing the same garbage essentially and expecting it to boom because it’s Lara Croft omg but no they’ve just shit on her big time and given her a bad reputation in the last few years imo. Rip Lara Croft
---
Thank you so much!
---
She passiv goes invincible but if she's teleporting then she doesn't go passiv invincible and if you know that she is teleporting don't run just move but don't run
---
I seriously doubt that this is  ***Er-Lang***
---
Thank you! I try to post my decent DBD art stuff in here haha
---
I wouldn't suggest running We'll Make It and Botany Knowledge since they don't stack and having 2 healing speed increasing perks seems unnecessary. If you don't unhook a lot then just run Botany Knowledge but if you do then just run We'll Make It
---
This is very funny, sadly I am unable to come with with a clever comment that fits this amazing photo of GooseFace. I guess some things are just too great to be commented on and must be enjoyed in silence.
---
Oni on a pony
---
Spirit with an Ebony Mori crying without matchmaking. All you had to do was hook them all once and tunnel. Just phase back to the hook and smack them back down.
---
So you want the entire new and top to be filled with 32k "perfect games" and toxic post-game chats? News isn't very often and regardless still gets to top and/or pinned anyway, and discussions are had in nearly every post anyway.
---
I hate Oni, but I love this.
---
Yeah honestly I liked the 2013 game and most of the sequel but it does feel like they’re just recycling the same game mechanics and while the stories themselves are good the gameplay is super repetitive which just makes them boring :/
---
It's only annoying in the end game. That's why I eat it in the early game. I just eat the DS then move onto a different person instead of tunneling.
---
Oh cause tunneling is so nice :)

Show me a clip or something. I don't play Ash.
---
The secret incredient is capitalism
---
Then there's a new semi meta perk that directly counters a killer's perk. Yaay.
---
Exactly. Also don’t be negative and expect positive results. I don’t like some of the memes but that doesn’t mean I’m going to comment on them having no effort because that’s just simply not true. Please go ahead and post a low effort meme and see how far it goes before being downvoted or hated on by someone like you.
---
That would be over-saturated content. go visit /r/elderscrollsonline sub, its all fan creations and creative oc content and news for the most part.
---
its obviously 2 hot girls, a hot girl detective and a hot girl who feeds survivors to her pigs. maybe she'll be the first killer who can carry survivors to something other than a hook, instead carrying them to a cute baby piggy on the map who does something adorable to them like wittle wet piggie kisses and then munchy munchies your face off
---
The message was based entirely on moris, how does it not have anything to do with them? Lol.
---
i just had a game with a tunneling myers too, i wasnt even his obsession, thankfully though i pipped so that was my one victory 😔🤙
---
Doctor in a Helicopter?
---
Clown in Town?
---
Cannibal watching Dragon Ball? (thats shit lol)
---
The shape on a grape?
---
Yes. As you said, the people who camp don't care about pips. If anything it's beneficial for them to stay low-ranked, where they can encounter low-ranked survivors who are less likely to ignore the camper and just genrush.
---
I mean... M1 is for working on things, space is for throwing the pallet
---
How did he fuck up?
---
Honestly it would be really funny to have diversion have some sort of affect when a killer gets hit by it, like making a grunt or instantly getting bloodlust 3 out of pure rage
---
Well, the graphics suck.
---
I feel this. I've been getting matched with rank 4s all day and I'm a rank 9. I just want to play a casual Legion but I keep getting the most perfectly optimal loopers who walk me from pallet to pallet &gt;:(
---
Yeup. Hanging onto ledges and maneuvering old ancient tech an shit gets old pretty quick, as big as they are I’m sure they could’ve found a way around this but went the easy route like most companies would and just sucked up the money and tanked her rep.
---
(Let’s stop talking about Lara Croft before mods take us down tho cause it’s very irrelevant to the post lol)
---
hey hey hey, keep your dirty immersed fingers off my totem, I need it for my inner strength lol
---
this meme is more fun than playing her post rework
---
Respect the 4%!
---
Can I ask. What was the purpose of this post? Is it supposed to be funny? Factual? Relevant? Entertaining? Like I’m not tryna be a dick but if you’re trying to be funny you’re trying too hard. It’s also reddit clutter
---
whom? me? I don't whine about the game. killer mains, however, are mostly whiney teenagers who expect you to know what they want. setting these arbitrary parameters like "wait long enough to save your teammate, or else I'm going to hook you and face camp" are ridiculous. you're the only one clued in to this. the survivors are just trying to play the game.
---
That's amazing
---
Legion Gang where you at?
---
Man, here I thought you had the perk. Regardless, great save!
---
Post all of it! I’d way rather see stuff like this than people’s screenshots of 4k’s and of how fucked up ranking system is.
---
I’d honestly give ya an award for this but am broke :(
---
[removed]
---
It's... the survivors fault? You do know against a competent killer facecamping will get you a 4k. Here's a scenario I've seen way too many times: guy is downed at 5 gens, killer starts facecamping. Everyone realises they're getting camped and starts doing gens. Between the time you realise they're getting camped, everyone else realises and everyone finds a gen, the guy on hook is probably close to second stage. 
---
Everyone's now doing gens and the guy getting facecamped is just gonna die with 5k points cause fuck him I guess. Back to 20 minute matchmaking for him. 3 gens pop, the guy dies, killer finds someone else and downs them. Guy's now getting camped and the last 2 survivors are each doing different gens. Dude on hook dies with like 10k points if they're lucky. Last 2 gens pop while they're just about dead, someone runs to an exit gate. Oh no, killer has NOED cause we have no time to do totems. The guy's slugged on the ground and bleeding out and the killer is patrolling doors. Best case scenario NOED is popped, slug is healed and last 2 escape. Worst case they both go down. Most likely the last guy has to ditch his mate and leave. Killer gets a 3k, way too many points for what he's done, survivors get shit all points cause no chasing or saving. 
---
Do gens and gtfo works on paper but half the time in-game it sure as hell doesn't
---
You nailed the ancient aliens guy lol.
---
that foothand really tripped me out there lol
---
Why is it when the grab actually works it's for shit like this?
---
I’m not alone at least lmao
---
I think I know who this dude is lol
---
I haven't been able to start - can't find games in an acceptable time :(
---
I met a farming wraith willing to help... And for some reason the rift decided that it didn't count even after I got 5 stuns to be safe.
---
Day later I meet a tunneling Billy, dropped a wooping 7 pallets on him legit, looped him for 4 gens and depiped because I didn't get to do anything else, I somehow survied tho.
---
This was epic make some more
---
It’s really well done but I really dislike how every animation I watch has the slow moving camera moving around, it’s used so much.
---
Just get rid of struggle, it's a completely pointless mechanic.
---
Holy shit that was really fun and well done. I would 100 percent watch a show about this.
---
I guess the issue with that is that not everyone has a swf to play with. Getting some of the challenges solo can be a real ball ache.
---
Me: working on gens in peace 
---
Him: tombstone piece and insta death
---
1. Two Survivors on a gen with yellow toolboxes can repair it in 31s. Even with a Hillbilly insta-down, you can't stop that gen popping.
---
2. That's what I'm saying. Because of the 3 Big Problems; Killer *must* have good chase potential AND map pressure, which limits the design possibilities.
---
3. It doesn't matter about the deadzones, as any half-decent Survivor can use an Exhaustion Perk to reliably get to *that* window.
---
4. Coldwind maps still have the strongest signature buildings, are quite large, have blinding corn and have the Cow Tree.
---
5. Coal Tower has a strong window, surrounded by safe loops (and sometimes a double pallet loop) and has the annoying drop down.
---
6. Ormond is big, often spawns jungle gyms around the Killer shack, the central building is heaven for Balanced Landing and has impassable pallets.
---
7. Mother's Cabin is the biggest map in the game and the central building often spawns very strong windows.
---
8. Family Residence is big, dark has bamboo and reeds to hide in and uniquely confusing jungle gyms.
---
I'm on console. Dropping pallets and cleansing actions are execute dusing the same button.
---
You don’t have to fully complete generators I don’t think so it’s possible just difficult
---
hence urban evasion

This is amazing, keep up the great work!

Recently Pickedreams father passed away from cancer, it was really tough for her but she has been chugging through with it, She says her family have been getting along much better and everything is looking bright for her.
---
The best you really can do is hope things work out in the end, depending on the cancer things can get really bad, or just kinda bad, there is no good in the situation. just do your best to support him, and maybe if you can send him a nice Msg in his comments, twitch, or discord
---
I hate that Claudette gets a bad rep. I'm a Claudette main, but trust me when I say I put my fair share of team work into every match I've ever played. Who wouldn't want a stealthy player during a match, (especially since I'm not A+ at looping or out running a killer?)  You can always catch me repairing a generator or unhooking a hooked teammate (or healing a team mate because they're wearing neon colors and keep getting hacked.) Pick the person that helps your weaknesses the most and build em up!
---
This is the problem with randomly generated maps - survivors can walk between objects but the killers can't, totems don't give you a prompt to cleanse them, this video.
---
x)
---
Same. I am 54 with only 3 challenges left.
---
You are very unlucky imo.
---
 When I see or put in Bps on console it’s like the Alaskan gold rush of bp everyone rushes to get killer stuns and farm the most points in that time. It’s rare when bloody party streamers are out in that someone really gets hoed unless they were pissing off the killer or sum. I am also on (Xbox1) so it might be a lot different here for the most part I wouldn’t know.
---
Yea but they play in a way that fucks over their teammates that’s no way to play an ONLINE COOPERATIVE game sooo.
---
i used the app zepeto for the face/body as a base and drew the clothes/hair/etc
---
That's a bug. It wasnt intended to do that.
---
Matchmaking has been more busted than usual for me last night. Was playing with a friend last night (we’re rank 5/6) and we’d get put with other purple survivors but rank 17-20 killers. Hadn’t had huge disparities happen like that before.
---
At first they were confused and thought it was a bug, but they realized why it happened.
---
I'm on PC. I mean I don't put it up explicitly to farm. I love playing the game, its just a waste to put them up and get face camped for no reason.
---
I love Nancy in this :D
---
Meh, might increase the player base some what.
---
do not really care really
---
every oni match ever lol
---
And when they are swf and you have no ruin you're fucked every time I play against swf player without ruin in just 4-6 minutes like 3-4 gens popped and you can't do anything
---
Oh boy, more egotistical dbags in dbd.
---
No but you have to finish them which is kinda impossible if other people pop them before me it's over
---
I feel like a good quality of life change would be for disconnects to count towards whatever challenge you have selected if it would make sense.  
---
Basically any sacrifice/escape based challenge should just take the d/c and give you credit as if you escape through the gate or killed the survivor in whatever fashion was specified.
---
Make it so if you rage quit, you end up helping the person more than you hurt them.
---
Yes but it's still a bug. The recording of exp wasnt meant until the rift came out, but it bugged out and began recording before the rift. Just because we know what it is, doesnt make it any less of a bug.
---
Try playing killer instead, show people how to play properly.
---
MoM was breaking the game by punishing killer for literally, HITTING survivors. That was the dumbest thing ever as an idea for a perk.

But it'll be the reason your teamates don't lol.  Seriously it promotes terrible decision making and unevenly places the burden of completing the objectives on the others typically.

The sooner you cut that chord and learn to play without it the quicker you'll improve your survivor play.  Trust me on that.

I recall them saying it was intentional, they just were confused at first. Otherwise it would have been reset.

Short Description: Kindred never turned off for a DC'd survivor.  
---
Description: During my last game as killer (playing Wraith on Badham), a survivor DC'd as I was carrying her to the hook. I did manage to get the hook registered despite the DC happening during the carry. After the game, a survivor reported that the Kindred never turned off for the rest of the game. During the rest of the game (which lasted another 5-10 minutes), survivors could see each other even when no one was hooked. No one else was running Kindred.

Lol I got super lucky and got my friend as killer unintentionally, I let him do the grab challenge and I did the 4 Pallet stun one.
---
I’m srry that happens to you, maybe save them for a time when you play swf? That’s what I generally like to do because most of the time cause I hate knowing my bps went to waste; and putting that in the hands of randoms is what happens most of the time so I just don’t and wait until I finally play w one of my pals. Hope I helped a lil that’s all I can really comment for advice, that’s shitty to get tunneled after putting in bps I’d feel pretty frustrated

Yeah, anytime I make a meme, it doesn't get many upvotes. A lot of people take memes too seriously. But the whole point of memes is joking around and no being serious.

For the sake of conversation, wouldn't that make already volatile Hex: perks even more volatile? Right now they benefit from being low key until they're a bother
---
1. 3 survivors working on 3 gens would pop those 3 gens before those 2 survivors could pop 2 and a half.
---
2. this post wasnt made with that thought in mind, if this post was about weaker killers being... well weak, then i would agree they need changes.
---
3. So dont chase them at the window.
---
4. Barn is really not that big of a deal anymore, and thomphson has no windows or pallets inside
---
5. Coal tower also is one of the smallest maps in the game, making it so if you do WANT to leave a survivor you where chasing, you can easily find another.
---
6. Yea ormond is decently fucked up, but the middle building just fucking sucks most of the time.
---
7. I dont know if thats true about it being the biggest map in the game, but the central building has a CHANCE of spawning a good window, even if that window isnt an infinite.
---
8. Literally no one likes family residence, but listing hiding potential as a reason why the map is survivor sided is dumb.
---
Even being too bad, it's not the worst.
---
But honest. What is remotely funny about this? Yes I have different humour but this is literally dogshit tier for humour. + it just clutters the subreddit with low effort ‘memes’

Increase the toxic side, he acts like he owns China, all of Europe and U.S.A, and insults the killer by swearing at them in end game chat and doing other toxic stuff
---
Untitled Goose Perk:
---
You gain enhanced potential in chaotic bastard ability.
---
For each survivor with an item you land a successful hit on, gain a token, up to a maximum of 1/2/3 tokens. 
---
For each token you have, the next time you pass over an unattended Survivor item while not in a chase, you cause the item to flee from nearby survivors for 30 seconds. Fleeing items can only be picked up while running, and emit an audible honk when retrieved.
---
Yes could, when it revealed your aura, now it doesn't so it doesn't proc.
---
EXACTLY I’m always teamed with them and personally I just like running the killer it helps me get better so I do that for at the least 3 minutes and no gens get done AT ALL I get if they have ruin but if I was doing a gen before hand and there’s only Ruin 1 or none at all and they still don’t do anything it’s so annoying it’s so hard to even imagine what they did to get to red ranks or even purple ranks.
---
Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner. I'm so hilarious, ha. /s

Anyone else notice how easy the 4th level was compared to the 3rd? Just finished all the challenges in the 4th level in like two days.
---
It's a glock lmao
---
Old MoM tops it in my opinion. It completely handicapped the weakest killers in the game whole having next to zero impact on the top tier since their powers didn't stack it. It either needs reworked to a new effect or it can stay in the dumpster.
---
I would've let him go after that lmao I'd feel so bad, that is so unlucky

If your user flair is a joke, I very much appreciate it.

Really out here telling the mans “why didn’t you tunnel” like that’s advice huh

Voice acting for some of the characters could be better too. Constructive criticism here only though.

Until you get out of brown ranks and your traps constantly get disarmed and it’s way too hard to play Trapper. He’s my favourite killer but I don’t play him simply because I get so pissed that my traps get ruined all the time.

I’m glad it doesn’t go over some people’s head, you have a great night m8
---
I totally agree he is. I love jumpscaring people as him.

And before endgame collapse from exit gate opening, surviviea would just hide around the map oncs the doors were opened to make the killer dc and lose their points to get to the killers next game just to be asshole

---
If anything they should tweak it so you instantly lose a small % of the battery life upon using the flashlight, but it doesn't start draining any more battery until  set time of sustained use later.
---
Basically, keep the flashlight functionally the same for it's intended use, but make it vanish for use it for annoying clicking.

---
I do use whispers. Whispers is one of my favourite perks because of how much information it gives you about where survivors are and aren’t. Also, it theoretically lets the Trapper know if there’s a good chance someone saw him put down a trap. However I still find it’s impossible to have several traps up at once without them getting disarmed.
---
I hope the graphical changes gets nerfed
---
Just for you, Im throwing my own one together.

Happened more than 3 times... time to fix the game?

I'm at level 56 right now with a couple challenges left. I've deduced that about every game gives you 1 rift fragment, therefore I have to play about 140 games before the rift ends if I were to not get the challenges
---
I’d smash
---
100 Cells. If you were to buy the whole pass without earning anything, it would cost 7000 Cells, plus 1000 Cells to buy the premium track, so 8000 Cells total.

You definitely lack the emotional maturity for this game. I don't even face camp but I don't have to stand to the side for a 4k complaint either. Players will still complain about some arbitrary mechanic of the game that made them lose.  I'm not gonna have a temper tantrum to random people online because I lost. How young is the playerbase for this game? You guys are so embarrassing and I dont need your fake internet points for validation, its painfully obvious how childish this playerbase is. You're entitled to your opinion , however immature it may be.

Why you gotta be bitter, dude. I thought it was pretty good
---
Copy pasta from my reply in another NOED thread:
---
NOED is balanced because not only it can be countered but survivors have multiple ways to counter it and as if it wasnt enough, multiple tools to assist with that task. Survivors have more control over NOED happening or not than the killer itself since he can't actually protect dull totems. 
---
Counters: 
---
* Cleanse 5 totems.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it just yet. If you see the killer is struggling to catch survivors, go cleanse the totems you spotted before the last gen is done.
---
* Just locate as many totems as you can but don't waste time cleansing it. After the last gen has been repaired, revisit all the totems to see if one of them lit up. 
---
* Don't waste time looking for totems the entire match, just look for that one lit totem after the last gen is done or once someone gets hit by NOED. 
---
Tools to assist with cleansing totems:
---
* [Green Map](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Map) with [Red Twine](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Twine) add-on.
---
* [Small Game](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Small_Game). Just mindlessly run around the map and do a thorough search when the alert goes off, reducing the time wasted looking for totems. 
---
* [Detective's Hunch](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Detective%27s_Hunch). Doing your objective AND easily finding totems. (this perk recently got a really good buff in the last patch). 
---
Not a tool but comes with play time:
---
* Memorize most if not all props that can contain a totem attached to it. Drastically reduces the time spent looking for totems. 
---
Very rare but not impossible, you can loop a killer with NOED (just like an EW3 myers + the mov speed) to some extent and escape without getting hit. 
---
So yeah, NOED is fine. Feels very cheap because of the 1-shot but still fine. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
*"bUt HoW cAn I dO aLl ThIs If ThE KiLlEr ChAsEd Me, HiT mE wItH nOeD aNd My TeAm SaT bY tHe ExIt GaTes?"*
---
You see, the problem here is not the **perk**, is your teammates or players in general. They should be doing any of the steps above while you were being chased.
---
It also forces the killer to play with 3 perks throughout the entire match leaving him at a disadvantage right from the start for a hope that he will have NOED.
---
All of this without even mentioning SWF, which also makes NOED considerably weaker than playing against full solo players.
---
Ultimately, NOED is healthy for the game because as long as it exists, it creates a pseudo second objective for survivor which is something this game desperately needs. If NOED wasn't a thing, survivors could just focus all 5 generators like there was no tomorrow without any worries that they might get hit with NOED at the end. As a killer even if you never run NOED, you benefit from the perk existence.
---
No. The logic behind it was that it is challenging to gimp yourself by playing with fewer perks. WGLF offers no benefit in game, as if you're choosing to play with only 3 perks. That makes your trial more challenging. Understand? 
---
No need for personal insults.
---
Omg the knife part xD
---
Ruining? Honestly I enjoy games where the killer has NOED. It makes the endgame more suspenseful
---
Fuck. You got me.

That’s right. Aizen isn’t feared because he can use Kyokasuigetsu. Yes, Kyokasuigetsu’s power is terrifying. But that alone would not have been enough to subdue those who would rather die than to obey. That was the only reason why those powerful espadas were able to function as a group despite their personal motives. Because he’s strong. All of Captain Aizen’s abilities are far beyond everyone else’s. Youre going to take precautions against Kyokasuigetsu? Your plans aren’t good enough. You’re going to take precautions against everything else? Your plans still aren’t good enough. Even if you gather your minds against unfortunate events like the sky falling or the earth splitting, Captain Aizen’s abilities are far beyond your plans.
---
Went from being one of the weakest killers to one of the strongest.
---
Hope Legion and Cannibal get similar reworks.
---
Anyone tired of ds ruining the game?
---
It’s really just a feels bad moment when it happens to you or your teammate. Nothing much you can do unless you cleanse every totem which is super unreasonable to have to do or ask teammates to do. I’m pretty sure noed has been nerfed like a million times anyways so good luck getting any leeway there.

Not after it was nerfed though I do think it should be tweaked a bit.
---
This actually happened to me today over psn. I have my notifications turned off so I check them after matches. However, I did get a notification on my phone with the playstation app saying "farm?" from some random person. Me being me ignored it because 1. Idk how long ago I got that and 2. I'm clearly doing other shit on my phone not paying attention to the game to begin with while I wait for everyone to ready up before I pause my YouTube video I'm watching. 
---
Match starts, it's ironworks of misery. Everyone loops the holy living fuck out of this oni that clearly has no idea wtf he's doing. Ruin gone, 2 gens done, he still doesn't have his power. He finally gave up chase with dwight or whoever the fuck he was chasing and downed bill or ace or whoever. Dude got facecamped so we just did gens. Nea got injured trying to body block the hook. Came to me for heals. Then farmed that dude right off the hook in front of a face camping oni. Rank 4 killer doing this shit btw... ended up trading places with the dude on the hook. We busted out the last 3 gens. Dude dies on his 1 hook with kindred active the whole game. All gens are done at that point when he dies, the killer comes for me. I'm hoping that someone opens the gate soon.. ran the killer a solid 4 and a half minutes around the map. Not one gate opened... I get 1 hooked and died. 
---
Random nea Gets mad and blames us for his death and said we're what's wrong with the game and with swf. I was solo queued. Seen the killers messages and he ended it with "fine no farm then you don't have any fun." Unfortunately for the killer, I had a blast running him like a chump after he just got done face camping 2 randoms for that long and after I busted out 4 gens and got my last heal for my challenge done.
---
Unfortunately for nea, she still doesn't get why I wasn't gonna trade places with her especially when I wasn't running borrowed time at the time. She's using kindred, we all can clearly see the killer staring into your soul and drinking your tears. You really expect someone else to put up with that? Nah I'm good.
---
Sorry for long post.
---
No she isn’t. Every character, killer and survivor, is confirmed to be 18+
---
Seems like the majority of the community believes “fortnite bad, ninja bad” but honestly Ninja playing this game will give it a lot of popularity, which is always a good thing
---
Killers gotta eat too that’s mad protein
---
How about adrenaline?
---
I’m playing Tapp more often, he’s pretty hard to see with the right clothing
---
Yeah he was you couldn't hit survivors until you put them to sleep and Nightmare couldn't do much else as he had little chase potential or map pressure.
---
Yessss thank you for that I always love a good Claudette main i salute you sir Claudette 😹💙
---
Annoying Yes but I don't think it break the game.
---
Though I Really hate it when everyone runs the damn thing and you've pretty much lost if you were playing a low tier killer.
---
Same way until i get frustrated at the game and then i just go to titan fall or hulu. Either one that comes first
---
I don't get that a lot even if I do camp. Sounds like a case of someone who can't accept losing at all and not just someone tilted because of what the killer did. Once he reported someone for stream sniping because the person killed him then emoted which just proves he's not just tilted.
---
Why does the clown sound like he’d voice act for a fan made series with Nappa from dragonball
---
I was doing the NOED+Endgame to get 2 sacrifices challenge and decided I'd rather out the trap on the door side of the pallet. When I went to pick up the original trap I accidentally broke the pallet...
---
Maybe play him like 50 matches or so...
---
Well, thar’s every multiplayer game tbh
---
Why tf he would go for that second vault hit he must’ve hated that vault with a passion
---
The annoying part of this is a spirit could still totally catch you
---
Hey you get your dick beaters off *MY* totem that I need for inner strength as well
---
I mean if you really think about it adrenaline is the same thing for survivors that noed is for killers. It’s a free health state once the endgame starts. There are ways to counter both, (adrenaline being arguably harder to counter). And it’s not even necessarily fair to say that for survivors it’s only once because all 4 of them and be running it and then as a killer you’ve just lost up to 4 hits.
---

Legion got a big buff and the Cannibal’s fine- people’s play style with him is just cancer.
---
I might be wrong here but I thought Freddy just got a big buff not an entire rework.
---
No, it got a hard nerf a few months ago. It only heals 1 health state now and only after 16 seconds at base. To make it go faster your perks and addons actually do matter. I think the closest you can get to a real insta heal now is about 4 seconds of waiting? (Don't hurt me if I'm wrong on the exact time) But you need a full build dedicated to using 1 item 1 time for the whole match to get to that lower time now and it just isn't worth doing for 1 play out of the whole ass match.
---
I started my poll originally because I had used an insta heal for my heal any survivor X times challenge. Dude got the full heal on it. Got 0 progress on my active challenge. Had dumbfucks arguing with me all morning about how they don't heal people anymore. I actually couldn't believe there were so many people sitting there trying to tell me insta heals don't heal... like dude are you for real right now. So tldr the poll was just made to prove a point to the ignorant.

This, this sub reddit is just 90% salty killer mains lmfao.
---
He wasn't weak. He was very underrated. You traded hitting survivors for 7 seconds to gain the ability to see sleeping survs from across the map. He had good built in slow down (even though it was reliant on rng, it's effects were significant, sleeping survs repaired at slugs pace). And he had ambush potential, and the sleep transition phasing in and out could really help if a survivor was camping a pallet while transitioning.
---

I made a goal of leveling up the rift once per day. It got old real quick and I'm so burned out I'm going to take the remaining 20 or so days off. Looking back on it now, I'd rather have the hours I spent grinding back and just throw some money their way to cut down the grind, just a little bit.
---
There’s no way to tell a low rank killer... in game
---
I disagree for a reason he was my main and easy to play with.
---
You can tell by how they act
---
When they changed some of the challenges to be easier they stated it would like result in not reaching 100.
---
Yeah no I have 2 challenges left and I'm still like 2 pages away from the end
---
Ranking on survivor is stupid easy, I got a black pip at 8k points
---
23k on killer = depip
---
No... you literally can’t tf?
---
I would guess that the less time evens out with the lower shard rewards.
---
thank you! &lt;3
---
Lol Leave her be. She's just stayed to silently judge you.
---
One of the things the game desperately needs is multiple moris per killer, and for you to select either one to use or it allows them to go through multiple ones.
---
Clown jumping on the survivor would be hilarious and I would pay money for it.
---
I had that happen before balanced landing rework
---
Killer called me a glitch abuser / hacker
---
I didn't do shit all game except run because I've seen it on reddit and knew it was rare
---
If someone doesn't want to spend a total of AT LEAST 80 hours in the span of 80 days, then I believe they just think they are entitled to battle pass rewards. If they do less than 80 hours and stop at the last reward before hitting the blanks at the ends for the Claudette head and BNP charm, they wouldn't have spent more than 50 hours in a span of 80 days. That's almost 40 minutes a day for 80 days to miss out on two cosmetics.
---
The challenges aren't bad at all. Tier 3 was the absolute worst grind fest. I completed Tier 4 in 6 hours tops and that should have taken longer considering it's the final tier.
---
Just farm out the killer ones and you'll be close enough to just push it out.
---
Honestly I don't do rift challenges. I don't care enough about the game. I play it to have fun, not to do stressful challenges
---
Are you aware that newer players will usually be super direct?
---
Just make it that the perk instantly deactivates if somebody else is downed and picked up while the timer is still up. 
---
Like the killer clearly isn't tunneling if they got somebody else before you.
---
They do
---
THE ONLY KILLER THAT I HAD BASEMENT PERKS ON WAS BILLY SINCE I P1 MY OTHER KILLERS, TRYING GETTING A FUCKING 4K IN THE BASEMENT, WITH A BASEMENT BILLY, A BASEMENT FUCKING BILLY!!!
---
Dont forget loop and tunnel :p
---
That’s why it has no upvotes
---
Just played a deranked nurse running ebony mori and maxed perks on nurse. Disgusting
---
How was I suppose to know they were not allowed?
---
Just have the perk deactivate if somebody gets downed and picked up before you while you are not in the dying state.
---
I like it
---
Sorry my bad how about this: never use pallets bro they aren't for you they are only for the more experienced survivors, just keep dying over and over again until you git gud then only when you are perfect at looping and only then should you drop any pallet ever.
---
it gives a noise notification not aura reading so no it shouldn’t proc distortion. if you’re worried about iron maiden use calm spirit, direct counter
---
I am ok with this
---
“how does what i said have anything to do with any type of mori” 
---
this message was written in a way that appears to suggest that you are talking about moris in general. perhaps you should try to write your messages in ways that don’t have a meaning that it doesn’t appear to be saying. it also doesn’t help that you didn’t realize this and instead made yourself out to be a douche because of an error you made.
---
In theory, matches are supposed to be restricted to players within the same five rank range. (I say “in theory” because I see a lot of players that are six ranks above/below me but there is a bug that can display the wrong rank on the scoreboard so who knows). The exception are ranks 16-20 which don’t face these restrictions so that new players are always able to find matches. In theory, there should be a lot more low ranked players than high ranked players so matches like this should be truly rare. 
---
Unfortunately, that last part might not hold true anymore, at least not on console. There seems to be a massive dearth of red and purple ranked killers. When I play my green ranked Killer I usually find myself going against survivors who are 5-6 ranks above my own. When I play my purple ranked survivor I typically find myself playing against killers who are 3-*7* ranks below my own. 
---
If I had to point a finger, I would say challenges are a key contributor to this. The Killer challenges tend to be a bit easier — less grindy, less luck-based. As such I’ve found myself playing survivor a lot more to try to keep up. Just so we’re clear, that’s not an invitation to make Killer challenges harder. Survivor challenges need to be made a bit easier.
---
Lmao I had a similar match once. Be me as wraith on the storehouse. I easily maxed out all categories except sacrifice. I find Claudette camping the hatch. Down her and hook her last hook. Except instead she dc before the hook. So I shut the hatch and find Meg in a corner. The nearby hook was dead so I had to carry her to the next closest one. Too far. I was already angery at Claudette. I tried maybe 8 more times. Meg wasn’t moving. Then once I got far enough she took the entrance to the building and vaulted next to me. Downed her and dc. I had 7200 in sacrifice and 8k in the rest
---
Right now they have a major impact on the game

Like I said to someone else u had played them an hour earlier with trapper.. they were toxic then to but I can expect the reason u give bc ur a nea main that probably doesn’t play killer.. I didn’t even get to mori anyone until there was 1 gen left so don’t act like this build and killer are some how op. I didn’t even get to hook anyone until they made a mistake and the hook respond right as I got a knock which allowed me to take advantage of it. I don’t use Moris unless I know the game is gonna be toxic and I still almost lost with it
---
I just wish it had 100% chance to nuffle the explosion rather than 50%, would it it an amazing beginner perk for newbies
---
Huh, well that certainly is easier than actually playing
---
What the...
---
it doesn’t
---
Toxicity.
---
Tactics imply strategic use.
---
If it's tied to strategy, and it has a chance of working, I firmly believe it isn't toxic.
---
It can be underhanded, definitely, but if there's viability to it and it has potential to be effective, there's no use crying over it.
---
Just because you're angry doesn't make it toxic. If we avoided things that made others angry the game would be unplayable.
---
Yellow rank killer here I only face purple plus. If it’s swf I might get some green
---
You're correct. This was actually me introducing my brother to the game so he wasn't very familiar with the mechanics yet.
---
2/3 per game or ~2 for every 3 games.
---
So we can have even more toxic assholes? No thanks.
---
Flashlight clicking has 0 use other than being annoying.
---
For survivor it wouldn't matter, but the Devs balanced the game around killer players needing really good soundcards/hearing/sight to be effective. It's why the sound 'bug' (I bet it's deliberate) is such a big issue. Adding colourblind mode could make non-colourblind killers job at tracking blood/p3 blendettes easier, deaf mode could make killers job at tracking sounds pretty much automatic. But I don't think it's a reason not to add them, just like SWF they should balance the game around it (I know SWF is unbalanced, but it should be) and the 'wah, let's exclude people' crowd will have to deal with it. (To clarify, I'm neither colourblind nor deaf.)

Bro u got more BP than them and 2 downs seems like it was a pretty decent match up
---
This perfectly demonstrates most mid-rank killer games.
---
When the artwork is better than the killer
---
Ok
---
That end music was awesome, send it to the devs for alternate chase themes
---
Here boi

None of those are that bad except the splinter In the finger. I felt it when I saw it
---
Their internet was that the grind combined with normal game play would get you to 70 in about 70 days.
---
OnLy PlaCe Me WiTh PeOpLe I aM bEtTeR tHaN
---
"relatively low" lol
---
DbD has half the current players of the most popular free to play game on Steam. It's not "low" unless you compare it to the literal top Triple AAA titles like DotA and Destiny.
---
Many games that are online are played with no cooperation if you want cooperation play a moba or play swf
---
Eh, generally you wouldn't want to tunnel your Obsession. Most Obsession perks reward you for ignoring your Obsession. Also likely that the Myers didn't even have any Obsession perks on and someone else had Decisive Strike.
---
It doesn't..? They patched that 3 days after chapter 14 dropped unless you're a switch player
---
Fucking please, Dont hit me with the "like i said to someone else" 
---
that comment was made 8 mins ago, while my comment was made 12. 
---
I have been rank 1 killer for ages, dont talk shit.
---
"i didnt EVEN get to mori anyone until there was 1 gen left" So you are telling me you got only 4 hooks the ENTIRE game playing a top tier with the 2 best gen slow down perks in the game? 
---
That build is OP actually, just bc you suck with it doesnt mean its not.
---
See how i was really toxic while commenting this? its bc you gave me a shitty attitude for literally no reason.
---
It is spelled the same way but they can’t sure them because they didn’t come up with it first and it’s not trademarked
---
Thats pretty clever.
---
That would be the asymmetrical part of the whole “Asymmetrical Horror” thing
---
You're using the biggest killer crutch in the game on a top 3 killer.  There's no way you get to complain about anyone's loadout man.  Both sides were crutched out and a bit gross.  Just own it
---
Nope PC. That’s why it confused me, was sure it was patched. Basically I was hooked in basement, got unhooked infront of the killer so jumped into a locker to bait DS (to use head on) he grabbed out of locker and put me on hook. That put me into this state. Maybe it’s locker related? The frustrating thing is it only cleared up after I was picked up by the killer again
---
Oh I’m sorry that they used the perks and items the developers put in the game in a combination they were intended
---
Drop them, shake head no, pick em back up
---
I honestly wanna start running distortion because I'm so tired of everybody claiming that they use barbecue and Chile for the extra blood points when we all know they use it for the or a rating it's extremely powerful to the point where everyone runs it.  The only way to counter it really is with distortion or getting in a locker before it pops but if you're not close enough to a locker and it pops you are screwed and its irritating asfuck
---
This resonates with me, I felt this picture.
---
The amount of shards you get scales with your level. Basically, you level up faster near 0, and slower near 100, but the amount of shards you get that entire time is constant. You get about 0.07 shards per XP that it took to level up. You're not missing out on any shards, just longer times in between larger bonuses.
---
yes ass shots are always nice. i prefer when kate is opening the escape lever with the camera by her left shoulder when she turns her face to the cam. glamour shot
---
Bra isn’t the killer, Feng is
---
It always bugged me so much that survivor DCing favors killer, making the game a lot easier for them, yet killers are the one receiving more points and emblem compensation.
---
I haven't taken any glamour shots yet.  That will be next.
---
Based on this Reddit. Legion, Spirit, David, and Claudette are also in the hated category.
---
So sweet
---
Yeah, probably. First time i've seen this since patch. Unhook locker grabs are a pretty unexpected variable so it's easy to see how such specific circumstances could be overlooked
---
Oh mY gOd, YoUr SuTcH a HaCkEr. RePoRtEd!!!!!
---
I accidentally read that in Ash voice because I legit though it’s one of the phrases OP forgot.
---
Well I'm about to say fuck it and do the opposite. Fuck bhvr for messing with people's FOMO just to get some cash.
---
Exactly. They're the very embodiment of toxic anti-consumerism, by preying on your FOMO (fear of missing out) in order to ensure you keep playing, thereby exposing you to the constant mental wear-down of MTX's in an effort to get you to capitulate and buy your way to "success" instead of grinding.
---
And yes, I fell for it, too.
---
Yeah to be honest that can just sum this up
---
Lol u do realize to use pop u have to get a hook right ? Which is impossible if 
---
1) they sabotage the hooks they run to before they die 
---
“Oh just carry them to another hook” 
---
2) you can’t bc they use boil over and then chase u with break out making it impossible to hook them 
---
3) u think ruin lasted longer than 1 min ?? 
---
I gave you and attitude bc u gave one first either way playing this way than coming on Reddit saying that killers the power role is what’s wrong with this game please play any killer u want and go against a 4 man swf that each has 1500+ hours played and you won’t have any fun I promise u. Builds like this promote killer to be toxic and use op add on and moris bc otherwise not only will they not have fun but they also won’t even have a chance at winning. I see every day survivors saying why does it take 10 + minutes to find a game ???  The answer is simple killers don’t want to play killer anymore it’s not fun that u have to use 1 of 3 killer bc if u don’t you’re almost guaranteed to lose u played them as trapper and got wrecked had no possible way of winning so u think I’m not gonna go in and use a mori next time I play against the toxic fucks ? And look they still did extremely well but you know “ YoU uSe ThAt BuiLd AnD StiLl CoMpLaIn”
---
I meant to post this in the general comment. I accidentally tagged you mb lol.
---
Not that I’m aware of
---
So what you're suggesting is he needs another nerf? I'll call bhvr right now, they'll love to hear!
---
/s
---
Bill is just a white Russman
---
I hope you didn't mori them.
---
Sabouteurs are meant to be bled out on the ground.
---
He should have spelled it "depipped", but it's when you lose a rank pip due to not scoring enough. The little marks you earn against your rank after each game if you scored well.
---
That's an OOF.
---
GG ez baby crow, git gud
---
All the videos and screenshots people keep posting are making me dred this challenge
---
I've been playing at least 3 hours a day.. completed all the challenges.   And I'm still working only at rift Level 60.
---
I mean, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you weren't hooked once, was left alone to do the gens, and were able to save your team mates from the hook was because the Killer brought Rancor and left you alone intentionally?
---
You could always try. When you go to purchase auric cells in the game it would bring up the steam overlay to confirm it and you'd be able to see if the discount was applied before it charged you.
---
Plays one swf and takes it out in everyone. Seems about right
---
Why did you post the same meme twice
---
Distortion
---
&gt; You start the Trial with 3 Tokens.
---
When your Aura IconHelp auras.png would be shown to the Killer, the Perk activates and a Token is consumed.
---
For the next 6/8/10 seconds while the Perk is activated, your Aura and Scratch Marks will not be shown to the Killer.
---
Iron Maiden
---
&gt; You open Lockers IconHelp lockers.png 30/40/50 % faster.
---
Survivors who exit Lockers suffer from the Exposed IconStatusEffects exposed.png Status Effect for 15 seconds and their location is revealed for 4 seconds.
---
That reveal is the same exact thing as when someone goes up a madness tier or if the killer has infectious fright because you scream.
---
You’re the kind of person to play a shooter and snipe in random places and somehow kill people.
---
It's what I do when using it.
---
When I was new it was a great beginner perk. You could work on gens near the killer if they were in chase and they wouldn't hear it being worked on to stop you. Now, if the killer was a lot better they would notice the gen going faster which is why it was only a beginner perk.
---
This paragraph is so unreadable omg what
---
You are warned throughout the entire match that the killer has Rancor by seeing their aura when a gen is done. Use this warning to play extra stealthily, especially when the endgame is about the begin
---
Ontario is the only part of Canada that actually exists
---

---
Honestly I thought reverse skill checks were already a thing? I know they talked like it was brand new, but the obedience add-ons give counter clock wise skill checks.
---
I also could've sworn the iridescent queen's ability already existed on the scrapped tape but it doesn't, and I swear I used an add-on that looked just like it that gave a static cling to two survivors if you zapped them both at once, and when they bumped each other it zapped them
---
Haemorrhage broke the shit out of Legion when they came out, though.
---
i have forgotten more toxic survivors i have played against then you have played against ever.
---
yea you do slug, you dont just fucking sit there on top of the survivor, go kill others. im glad they brought those builds, they countered your toxic shit. Thats not toxic.
---
1k points per gen left would be a good start so when someone dcs 10 seconds into the match you at least get 5k points. Of course remove this for players who join in groups so swf don't abuse this. Also, award them post game so if you have really crappy team-mates you can't max out the points, it should be thrown on top.
---
The reason I was able to do all of that was because she camped and tunneled. And if she had actually gone for me I would have been able to use Deliverance, DS, Dead Hard, and Adrenaline, but since she only went after the first person she saw they were all useless.
---
You mean with the whole Moonwalk exploit?, if not, can you tell me how? (in all seriousness, i might be missing a point here)
---
Just unlucky, people can't actually see who brought the streamers, just that someone did.
---
Who were you playing/what outfit do you wear, because that tends to be the thing which carries the most stigma for players.

I agree there can be improvements. The title is "Why can't DBD have something like this so deaf people can play like everyone else". It makes it sound like you cant play deaf. All I was saying is that deaf people do play DBD and stay in red ranks and here are some examples... Thanks for the down votes.
---
They probably recognize that people are wising up to the fact that their game is a total snoozefest (yay, sitting on a gen and holding M1!) so instead of trying to do anything reasonable about it, they're trying to use the battlepass as a means to squeeze as much gameplay as they can out of it by making it obtrusive and clunky.
---
Because it's harder to pip with Killer, that's why. Make it easier and they'll have to reduce it, but then there will be more boosted dogshit Killers in red ranks. They're bad enough at Rank 4 (Which is not a red rank). Kind of a "Pick your poison" type thing.
---
"Legion is annoying to play against."
---
No, entire team of SWF, YOU'RE annoying to play against.
---
What?

---
I guess I am
---
Yeah i pretty much used that but replace ruin with a different perk base on whatever perk i feel like using. Mainly it's Rancor for even more ways of finding survivors.
---
How is signalling to your teammates toxic
---
I’ve never seen reverse skill checks
---
Which pokemon game is this?
---
Omg nerf bbq, ruin and every single perk that could help the killer because I might not be able to scape
---
Imagine being an interdimensional monster and being bested by plucky preteens, too. Demogorgon just has it rough.
---
if the killers idea of fun is camping a downed/hooked /hooked survivor when they have an insta down enabled, i can’t imagine its much fun for the killer either. just like four man toxic set is unfinished for a killer, a camping/slugging/tunneling killer isn’t fun for a survivor. i think if either side plays in a way that will cause the other to de-pip no matter what they do, it’s toxic and nobody wants to “play” against that. it’s a game after all, we should be having fun! not getting salty
---
Would use it if it was at 100%
---
Stop justifying toxicity and bullying and I won't downvote you.
---
At first I thought it was cut skin but it looks whiter than skin so I thought it was wood

Uhhh signalling to your teammates???
---
McStabbies
---
Are you on PC, console, or Switch?
---
I haven't either, but the add-ons for obedience are supposed to give counter clockwise skill checks. Which is totally bizarre- It's like they don't exist even though they're right there in my loadout
---
you can remap your button assignments thankfully
---
Yeah matchmaking is just fucked RN, im consistently going agaist purple ranks at green. Luckily for me though im only green due to me playing KYF since the reset so I've been handling myself, but they seriously need to fix this shit none the less.
---
Increase the current range increase from 4/6/8 to 8/12/16.
---
Maybe it could also make all teammates share any aura reading perks, with 30% of the normal range (and doesn't get buffed by Open Handed)
---
F
---
Huntress' biggest weakness is that her constant humming gives Survivors a huge warning to hide, coupled with her slower movespeed makes Stealth a very viable tactic against her no matter what perks the survivors brought.
---
As such, perks that help find Survivors are very good on her. Whispers, BBQ, Rancor, I'm All Ears, Nurse's Calling and Thrilling Tremors are all decent to good on her.
---
Then, because she's a slower Killer, you'll want to run some perks to actually slow down the gens. Thrilling Tremors, Ruin, Huntress Lullaby, Corrupt Intervention, and Dying Light can all be used, but again, various degrees of effectiveness. Avoid Overcharge and Pop Goes the Weasle like the plague, though; she's slow and doesn't have any mobility options, so it takes too long to actually get to a gen to pop it.
---
The standard build is Nurse's, Whispers, BBQ, and Ruin, but personally I love running Thrilling, Ruin, I'm All ears, and BBQ. I can't tell you how many "impossible" shots I've lined up with I'm All Ears simply because I know where the Survivor is running to.
---
You just buy whichever ones you want.  Some may contain characters that have certain perks you want which could influence your decision, but that is still mostly personal.  I believe if you kill, people recommend doing leatherface to get BBQ for faster bloodpoints
---
Your first paragraph is literally everything I complained about in my post. Names a joke. And I'm sorry you don't believe me but that literally does nothing against my argument.
---
Genuinely sounds awful
---
Holy shit people actually say this in 2019? You literally commented under my comment with a huge monologue about how im an entitled survivor main and that i never play killer ever.
---
and now that you realize your arguments have literally no standing you resort to word vomit in an attempt to save your ego.
---
would it make you any happier to learn this exact same thing happened to me except i wasn’t fighting EGC timer so your suffering is shared
---
Yup, because me saying that Rancor is stupid and toxic means I'm a survivor main that thinks every perk is op.
---
I really liked your version of the dbd soundtrack with that retro feel
---
that's a new one.
---
Killer is the power role is fantasy that lazy, entitled killers wish this game would be. They are stronger and faster but if you expect them to be the power role and grants you easy win then no wonder you are awful at it. 
---
You expect your wins to be delivered on silver plate with little to no effort. Thus,one hit down, NOED, and expect survivors to just give you easy hits and hooks.
---
r/dbdLFG
---
What generation do I live in? What makes assume I live in my parents house? Lolololol,  reddit is not that deep dude. For 1) not a dude. 2) I'm actually a home owner. 3) your idea STILL sucks ass just as much as it did days ago when you're crybaby ass suggested it. 
---
Totems get clensed to easily,  I only get 3 kills some matches and need 4ks every game. ="SeEkInG sUcCeSs." 
---
I think totems are okay,  it's balanced for you not to get 4ks every match. Sometimes a survivor should be able to escape,  that's their objective. "OMG FUCKING ENTITLED SURV MAIN, GO TO HELL IGNORANT BABY SURV AND GIT GUD." 
---
Yeah..... Sounds like I'm the problem.
---
The speed boost means they'll never go down instantly, besides, a new player both doesn't know the timings for stuns nor that you should wait to see if the pallet is being broken. They'd be giving pallets away for free.
---
do you want me to be nice to him? im telling the truth. I would have won against them. 
---
it has been so long since i have lost to a player with less then 2k hours without them having SWF carries. 
---
I dont care if i sound like an ignorant prick, this guy came at me for no reason, so i really dont care if im saying shit that upsets you or him. 
---
Yea, i lose sometimes. But if i where to almost lose with this build, i would uninstall and go play an easier game.
---
It was a good time to eat some snacks with your keyboard hand...yea it was bad.
---
TBF they had the help of a psychic preteen who carried them
---
Lol naw I just gave up argue ignorant people who claim they play killer but their name is “the nea main” u came at me toxic I replied with the same energy .. u said I’m trash bc I used slow down perks but they got to 1 gen left when I explained to u why I couldn’t use the slow down perks u said lol trash just slug .. slugging doesn’t slow the game down unless ur a nurse or an instant down killer.. I said u and bro bc u seemed mad
---
Did you misread? No one said what you said was wrong
---
The devs added the new description for the add ons with the release of Oni. They don’t work that way though
---
why couldn’t they make it only 3 ;-;
---
i just want my lore goddamn it
---
Or you can try not to be a shitty tunneler.
---
I wish I had a psychic to carry me in games.
---
No, they get a free escape for 60 seconds, they get to make really unsafe plays until it goes down, and all killer can do is slug or don't hit them, either way it loses him pressure.
---
If you bad enough to get caught again, why shouldn't you go on the hook? Oh killer should lose points and pressure just because baby needs his training wheels? Get real, its a fucking dumb perk and if you have played killer you know it.
---
No i don't see what you are getting at, and I think you fail to realize DS doesn't exist in a vacuum. Its not just a free escape, its a free escape on top of all the other time wasting and second chance perks survivors get, on top of the shit map design making some really unbearable loops.
---
Or why don't you stop being a whining little b\*tch and leave if you don't like it
---
No, you didn't lose because he took Rancor. You lost because you got caught despite being warned the killer has it 5 times.
---
Lol did I say I expect it ? I was taunting survivors mains that claim the killer is a power role.. but yes realistically I would think that survivors with no weapons just a flash light would get completely wrecked by any killer that isn’t the legion .. I  know that it’s a game but it’s a game where the “power role” has actually no power at all until survivor make a mistake if 4 survivors make no mistakes there’s no way for a killer to win
---
But pallet and totem are different buttons
---
that totem spot is pretty dumb right next to a pallet
---
My first paragraph is reinforcing the idea that she specifically took a perk that counters your perks, why wouldn't she take advantage of that?
---
Let's look at Rancor:
---
When the last gen is done, the Killer get a notification as to where **every single survivor is** while the Obsession *who is the only person Rancor will work on now* gets complete aura info on the Killer's location, where they're heading, and what is going on. The Killer has a 1/4 chance of running straight to the Obsession, the Obsession has a 3/4 chance of the Killer going to someone else.
---
Obviously, this changes if survivors are dead, in which case the Killer earned that.
---
You, as the Survivor, know where she's going and where the exit gates are. You can very easily go somewhere she's not and survive. Unless the gates are right next to each other, in which case there wasn't much you could do about that anyway.
---
This is adorable ngl, keep up the childish style :)
---
&gt; toxicity and bullying
---
Can't get bullied if you don't care ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Like i said, it's just a silly animations and it helps the killer more anyway since the survivor is wasting time either trying to get your attention or doing silly animations instead of gaining distance.
---
More power to them if it works, plenty of people throw games because they get way too emotionally invested in this game.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
I don’t know about other platforms but on Xbox, pallets and interact are both right bumper.
---
Well TIL
---
Shit that's so bizarre. I just thought they always did that.
---
The I have no skill build
---
all communities try to make the games as easy as possible for both sides. that's why prayer beads spirit and insta heals were a problem. You could play brainlessly with no downside.
---
this would help deaf people, yes, but just look at fortnite (i know, ew). they added features for mobile players and then it was ported to pc for deaf players. i mean shit one of the best players of that game is a deaf 14 year old girl. these options help them but can give players who dont need them unfair advantages. 
---
they give those who dont need them the option to shut off the sound and pay attention only to visual cues. paying attention to one is better than both, let me tell you.
---
Haha love it
---
am i not allowed to main a survivor if i also play killer?
---
You didnt answer my question on how that was toxic.
---
You are playing freddy. you have everything in your kit to do well, you brought a mori so you also had over 3x the power. 
---
Slugging does slow the game down. One slugged survivor+ someone getting chased is max 1 person on gens at a time.
---
The stranger things perks are not very good which kind of sucks, but I LOVE the characters
---
How bout no, you have no sense or balance.
---
&gt; if the killers idea of fun is camping a downed/hooked /hooked survivor when they have an insta down enabled, i can’t imagine its much fun for the killer either.
---

---
See how dumb you sound?
---
You define toxic based on your own enjoyment and ignore the possibility that the other side might have a different enjoyment.
---
Then again, you don't even define toxicity well to begin with.
---
You're just another entitled player trying to shame others into playing how they dictate the game should be played.
---
So you're using the fact that there are many good ideas that COULD be implemented to dismiss even discussing a positive change for something else? You're what we call a fucking fuckhead, buddy. 
---
And just so you're aware of how counter-intuitive you're being to your own cause, there may be useless perks that are breaking even in not being used from lack of interest, but No Mither is genuinely A DISADVANTAGE. It's easily able to be argued that it could use prioritized attention because of that. But I'm not going to make that argument any further with you cuz you're an absolute displease to talk to and somebody that comes across as just trying to be edgy. So have a good one, fucko. This conversation is over.
---
Julie mains exist?
---
Wraith's insane, Nurse's insane, Billy did nothing wrong really, Hag got tortured, Spirit got murdered, Plague did nothing wrong either.  feels bad man
---
This is the best one so far. I love all of your videos, keep it up!
---
I'm not a douche because you read the comment wrong. Yeah, I was talking about moris in general, not ebony moris specifically.
---
part of the reason I'm hesitant to learn survivor. i had feeling like I'm holding back the team and i miss skillchecks often
---
Yeah I figured that there'd be about 1/2 of it from Rift Challenges and 1/2 from grinding fragments. I did get through some of the challenges fairly quickly so probably explains how I did complete the pass at the time. Plus devs. mentioned that due to changes in difficulty that it would make it a bit more grindy.
---
Steve is the real entity behind the scoops outfit, don’t lie to yourself.
---
Your "different opinion" is you thinking there's no issue with you being a cunt. It's that simple, dude. I'm not playing for other people, I'm just not being an asshole. And the fact that the only way you can have fun is by being one is disconcerting. But whatever dude, I'm done arguing with an asshole with no good faith.
---
Farmed with the last one and didn't let me be saved 🤡 Is this against rules?
---
It's great for perk identification too, such as BBQ, IAE, BMM, etc
---
Maybe not nowadays
---
If you think that your power is non existent until survivor made a mistake then you're awful at this game. 
---
Killers these days have so many tools at their disposal to win yet they keep bitching like entitled kids.
---
It should just just go away after the killer hooks someone else and after 60 secs, there’s been multiple times where I hook others just to get stabbed in the neck or survivors doing a really stupid play and they get away with it because of d strike
---
sir please tell us what this means
---
She’s the killer but still getting scared of hitting a survivor I think your right about her playing a game rated m lol
---
Nah just swing and spin around. If they continue to wiggle hook them. They had their chance
---
Those are great survivors idk why you’re mad about that
---
of flesh and mud(for ruin) , Halloween, and leatherface (for bbq and chili)

Lol no far from awful and I know what I said was true bc it observable when I play survivors there’s only three reason why I get caught/hit 
---
1) I make a mistake 
---
2) my teammates make a mistake causing me to get screwed over 
---
3) I get caught in the open not near a pallet but really that’s just me making a mistake
---
On another game called identity v, which is like this dbd, has this
---
Its not quite as absurd as it once was
---
How do you kick someone from a match of dead by daylight or do you mea. The killer tunnels him then camped to ensure his death
---
With both uni and work I've still crammed a shit ton of playtime and I'm only on level 40. I did the math, and completing all the remaining challenges would net me about 100 tokens, so 10 fragments.
---
Getting around 600xp per game, I'd need to play 16 games a day (for the remaining 17 days) to finish the last two tens to 70. I'd really have liked the BNP charm but I cannot be arsed to spend most of my time playing the same game.
---
“If I play with my friends we destroy the killer but if we don’t play together we lose”. I mean what do you expect to happen in a game that has no mic
---
I have almost completed mine but I happened to have my doctor write me off work (undergoing multiple surgeries) just as it started so idk if I would have gotten this far if those weren't my circumstances..
---
Every killer would have to play around old DS and would get stunned just for doing their job. At least MoM could be countered with powers and actually took some time to activate
---
I’m having a hard time too, gone through a lot of flashlight inventory. If available add on the battery and filament. Try to have fun with it, use bond or empathy so you can get an idea where you’re needed. And I think it doesn’t have to be an exact flashlight save, so if you’re near the killer when he’s about to hook then I think it counts. Good luck
---
Oml I love this. Keep up the good work!
---
Funny thing getting into Fortnite for the first time and getting back into DBD when this went live both at the same time.
---
/r/FortniteBR has seen people whining nonstop that the current Battle Pass is too easy, too short, too quick to get to max level, not enough to do, "no reason to play after I do all the achievements!", etc.
---
But the Rift is just plain unpleasant.  I can play Fortnite a bit 2-3 nights a week and get everything done I wanted to, plus time for playing just for fun.  DBD so far I've had to grind my ass off to get **anywhere**; while I did come in a bit late (right before book 3 opened) I'm just finishing book 2 now and sitting at a lousy level 25.  Kinda feel like I should at least be halfway through the Rift if I'm halfway through the archives at bare minimum, yeah?
---
Moe?.... What are you doing here?
---
Oh yes, in the 3,500 hours I've played let me count the times someone has used a flashlight to get my attention as a survivor.
---
Let's see, there was the time someone got upset I was cleansing a dull totem. And then the guy who d/c'd after clicking at me while I was looting a chest. Oh, and who could forget the TTV nea who clicked at me and then attempted to poorly moonwalk while I was working on a gen.
---
Truly flashlight clicking is a gift from the gods.
---
Can someone explain to me how I have all but 5 challenges done across all 4 tomes, yet my rift is only 53. There's no way I'll get this pass done with how little fragments I have left from challenges and I am not going to level up my devotion 150 times in the span of 2 weeks to complete it
---
Just being less valued I guess and not have to work in a hive mind to have any fun. Some independence but it would make the game unbalanced. So I guess this post is pointing out a flaw in the games core design
---
Ms. Spirit would like to have a word with you
---
I'm in the same boat
---
I think challenges should be far less of a grind. I like that they promote different builds and play styles but some of them are just plain un-fun. I get that they're suppossed to be challenging but a few of them are realistically impossible unless you farm
---
It's easy tbh. Just get the killer to chase you, drop the pallet and when he gets stunned by the pallet or when he kicks it to break it then shine the flashlight at him
---
That's what i've been doing. But i feel like these killers know what i'm gonna do when they see mt flashlight &amp; they don't break it. Lol.
---
as a survivor main we do not claim this person. i’m so sorry :(
---
You’re probably the best at exaggerating, probably on this entire sub. It’s not that dramatic of a playstyle change, I’m just hovering around the killer, allowing me to do gens.
---
Uh
---
You do that first, drop em, shake head no and pick em back up
---
I am on xbox. I got it off of game pass which is the special edition, so I think it comes with a few dlc already on it.
---
There should be a button above the last log that lets you watch the cutscene.
---
If you're missing skillchecks, that means you're at least making an attempt to touch the generators. That would make you more of an asset than average :D
---
If I was the survivor, I would hate you for that.  However I’m not. So damn good shot!
---
Nope, I'm just doing chase music here and there ;D
---
That's not the devs job tho lmao
---
I burned a BPS and pretended to farm until I got 8 STBFL stacks. Then I downed everybody while they tried to heal and put them all in the basement. 
---
When all four were in the basement simultaneously one of them unhooked himself and they unhooked each other right in front of me. I got them all back on, but man that was tense.
---
The reason for it is because the killer sounds already thought out with a backstory. It would be wasted potential to not use it
---
Trapper level:expert
---
i got this against a freddy with that add on that makes the obsession unable to wake up no matter what plus lery’s. it was a battle i must say.
---
if you really are dedicated to the challenge you can let the killer hit  you through the pallet so long as you get the stun.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
when I'm playing survivor, I'm either glued to gens and missing half the skill checks or badly looping the killer
---
I refuse to accept this. I REFUSE!
---
I’m scared that people are saying they’re only now just reaching tier 70 when my pc was broke for about a month and I’m only halfway through tome Level 2 and at tier 24. :|
---
Am I in the right subreddit right now
---
Yes u are
---
Nice to see another Kate with balls. GG
---
&gt; as less people want to play survivors.
---
If people stop wanting to play survivor because they can no longer disconnect at-will to screw over the killer then the game is ultimately better off without them. 
---
They become the equivalent of the type of person who swears loudly they'll "Never shop here again" because some poor retail worker won't honor an expired coupon. All the while they've never shopped there in the first place.
---
It's pretty luck based I feel on whether or not survivors keep DCing. Some ppl take hrs and some get it in the first game.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
You're right. I have noticed across many gaming communities people feeling obligated to complete Battle Passes or events and if it is truly their favorite and main game, I get being upset if the system is rigged against the players in some way.
---
But then I see people who admit to barely playing the game complaining about not getting everything and its like "Bruh, it's not meant for you then". Or people playing through mechanics and metas they hate just for an event. Like, just take a break.
---
I don't believe cosmetics are "worthless" because I get expressing yourselves and showing love to characters you like. But at some point people just have to remember, it is just a game. 
---
You can leave for a bit, especially if you don't support the game's current direction. You might even come back and enjoy it more after the break.
---
And in the process remove a large incentive to stream in the first place. As i mentioned you lose all audience interactions, even if you don't respond the everything the whole point is being able to in real time speak to your community, answer questions, pose questions, read donations ect.
---
Its ultimately a case that True and other DBD streamers should not have to basically destream their own stream exclusively because of Behaviors stance and lack of input on what amounts to screen cheating and the ludicrous advantage it gives. Again its cheating, it should be bannable, if nothing else it makes your game look pretty shitty for new players if they go and check out someone like true, someone endorsed by the devs as a Fog whisperer and their first experience with the game is him mentioning that he is dealing with the same stream snipers today who are being super toxic and dickish as he is playing killer and you every few games them coming back. Not really gonna sell you on the game.
---
Outside of a ban system just place a avoid player system into the game again, something that lets you avoid 5/8 players after and only after you have encountered them within X amount of games over X amount of time, that way it specifically is something that can be used to stop people from constantly intentionally trying to be matched with the same player, and the fact it requires you to encounter them multiple times over a time period means that its harder to generally exploit (You cant just avoid killers that beat you, you have to encounter the player a few times before you can avoid them for idk, 10 hours or something).
---
6 is a bit too young, especially a game about killing people
---
I'm a rank 1 killer, and currently rank 7 survivor. I like the challenge. I don't bitch out, only way I got better was from playing people better than me. If you're happy staying stuck at your green level, then go ahead and keep posting these over saturated whiney posts.
---
To give more explanation you will have survivors playing scared, annoyed, toxic in post-game chat. Can be unlocked past level 30 as an offering that comes in, yellow, green, and red. Yellow mori allowing you to kill the last survivor alive if been hooked before. Green allowing you to kill any survivor if hooked before. Red mori allowing you to kill *any* survivor if hooked before.
---
no kidding, i had that too, and next match i didnt get even one chance to heal someone even a bit. but it ends fast anyway. rift challenges are only good for 1-2 days
---
I was lucky with my team, I let the man do 4 dark sense gens and then got my 6 feet under
---
Idk but as someone who mains Huntress and the Plague I love them hahaha.
---
Maybe I am.
---
Of course it was the red rank that dc'ed smh
---
Dailies should give rift fragments so I have incentive to do them but to also make the grind less tedious.
---
Well your right, however if they are getting dominated completely theres not really any learning or improving happening either. If *you know* that a killer is lower ranked (which I understand is not probable) go easy on them but don't just stand still because that's also helping no one
---
This pic is giving me goosebumps.
---
dude i feel the exact same, i want to play the game but i feel like i’m holding back the team and then i get nervous and don’t play
---
If you need some motivation, I’ll give you silver if you can pull it off lol. If you can only 1 or 2, I can tell you which ones id be interested in.
---
lol "specifically made to fuck you." i think rancor is pretty good actually. for mori daily rituals &gt;: D
---
And in my time playing I've found lots of use in signalling to your teammates with a flashlight. Anecdotal evidence goes both ways bud, but I dont understand why removing a useful ability for a slight annoyance is a good idea
---
I did it with Insta down Hatchets and with those perks stated earlier. Also pick a map that as a easy access to the basement like the nurse's map.
---
Fucking morons downvoting this obviously don’t have younger female siblings. 6 year old little girls shouldn’t be playing this game.
---
Thanks for the advice. Probably just going to do this til I get to lower ranks again.
---
Hey tell her that she sees me play this daily and she wanted me to teach her how
---
I just want a fleshlight 
---
- Jesus
---
its not fun to be downed or hooked and have to wait
---
It's only been the red ranks that have been dc'ing or sitting in corners on the opposite side of the map. Their disgraces to the red ranks.
---
“Does it matter” yes you brain dead degenerate.
---
A certain perk shouldn't be necessary for every regular game
---
How does rank 3 killer even come up against me. Also. He just stopped chasing this dude and came to me to just kill and hook me.
---
hoes mad
---
Don't wanna jump in and get attacked or anything, yeah these posts are constant but it is a little annoying to constantly get outplayed, and good on you for becoming rank 1 killer and playing against people better than you, no need to be hateful tho makes you seem a little toxic. Lowest rank I've been is 14 on killer and 12 on survivor so I'm garbage regardless.
---
Eh, I'm still on the second tome or whatever the sections are called. I already gave up chasing them. 
---
I still choose a challenge to be active in case I happen to complete them in normal play, like the "Heal X health states" ones, but otherwise I'm still just playing DBD as if the rift doesn't exist. I don't have that kind of time on my hand lol. 
---
But happy for others that do and hope they post on youtube the full stories so I can catch the history stuff of the killers and survivors. Because I sure as hell ain't gonna unlock the full stories in-game.
---
Well either swf or just feels bad.
---
Your fear and hyped/fear laughing sustains me take a sub
---
Legion is supposed to look ANGERY not kinda smug
---
I miss the old version of tinker. Made Huntress op and I loved it so much.
---
man, do u have firecrackers? if u do..thats a guarantee blind (ofc as long as u know how to time those correctly) specially on the Decisive Light challenge
---
Whey mey peypey hard
---
What the hell are you talking about?  Maybe it is the case in your region but in other regions we are not that lucky.  
---
They can spew all the statistics but the reality is matchmaking is almost non-existent at times.
---
This is pretty shit ngl
---
Doesn’t really fit the dbd sub
---
Are you on console?
---
Like neas teabagging a rank 20 trapper?
---
It is so sad seeing this post at over 500 upvotes. This does nothing for the game. Only annoys the fuck ouf of Killer. Survivor queues are already long enough, lets bully those last few people that actually play Killer, good job.
---
looks like it's all came full circle.
---
Yep
---
I wouldn’t mind seeing a cinematic of Nea being in chase now that you her bring up &gt;:)
---
 You use dead hard and Then you still get downed but you are exhausted
---
😻
---
Sally ♥️
---
What would you recommend?
---
"Oni Yamaoaka"  
---
\*kills the next person\*
---
Shit shitpost
---
Second Chance perks are DS, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard if used properly.
---
Whats a 5 seconds stun when im so good? Nothing, but in that 5 seconds they can get to a loop, and then it becomes a lot more than 5 seconds, or they can unhook someone, and then there's another active DS.
---
Yeah I could tell you run DS by the way to try and justify it. But this brings up an interesting point. What happens if you get unhooked and you don't use DS? Its there for your next unhook.
---
If you get downed, and then the other person does too, than you need to either blame yourself for getting downed or blame the other survivor for being a dumbass with his rescues, not the killer for playing the optimal way.
---
I get hit with it a lot. Watch any killer's streams, they won't tunnel yet they get smacked very, very often. Maybe try playing killer yourself to see. Also, if someone does a very unsafe hook while im there, and i down both of them, did I tunnel?
---
Purple/Red ranks in NA. Literally have had zero problems lately getting a game as killer. If anything the killer queues have sped up since now SWF groups are based on the highest rank, so the 'bully squads' of olden times who used a token rank 20-15 'friend' now all get treated as red rank survivors and put into my lobby.
---
R/STFU
---
It must be nice thinking that your privileges extend to other people in other side of the world or people who play on different platforms.
---
It’s so bad it feels like it would come from Facebook
---
It’s now canon that the killers and survivors are like normal people a la Wreck it Ralph.
---
You won’t be able to do challenges, as for lore in the archives I’m not sure but the rift and challenges close permanently ik that.
---
&gt;And just so you're aware of how counter-intuitive you're being to your own cause, there may be useless perks that are breaking even in not being used from lack of interest, but No Mither is genuinely A DISADVANTAGE
---
It's a challenge perk. It is intended in that way
---
&gt;It's easily able to be argued that it could use prioritized attention because of that
---
Read above
---
&gt;But I'm not going to make that argument any further with you cuz you're an absolute displeasure to talk to and somebody that comes across as just trying to be edgy. So have a good one, fucko. This conversation is over.
---
Sure. Bye
---
Talk with a brick might be more productive than talking with people like you
---
Still tier 17 lol, the battle pass was at the worst time possible for me i just hope the next will be near an holiday.
---
Nice. Why care when you can be racist?
---
Playing with standard controller on PS4. I trapped my Ruin totem and multiple players caught on, so I placed a second trap as added insurance.
---
But why turn notifications off?
---
These are really nicely drawn, but why are they called "poor bill"
---
My main problem is dh. It still serves the most viable function of getting a few extra steps to make it to a safe pallet. For me however, it's invincibility frames are non existent anymore. I've tried to dh an attack normally, early, late and it never works and still triggers the exhausted effect.
---
Hush the child is sleeping
---
Yeah, it's the same issue Overwatch installed when it removed hero stacking. QP went from the casual mode to a combination of poeple trying to play casually and sweaty tryhards afraid to risk their rank practicing in the actual ranked mode...practicing for ranked mode.
---
Except DbD is asymmetrical, so where the sweaty person ends up matters a lot.
---
Say that to all the people that let their 8 year olds play CSGO
---
The worst is when they're obviously going to dominate and still do stuff like break hooks and body block first hook.
---
I love it when it causes me to lose frames and I don’t make any distance
---
U can get in US u just change region on like Apple store there is videos for how to do. I did it I didn’t play a lot I didn’t like that much
---
Well thank god you didn’t run deliverance, otherwise you would have been found first 100%
---
Everyone talkin' shit but the trap didn't snap. Crow's mocking Trapper's efforts.
---
Seeing Ash's perks actually being useful warms my little heart. Thank you, devs, for the Cursed Legacy chapter.
---
I didn't say it was. I said it was a tool that made it much more tolerable while MoM only had "lol play a better killer"
---
Honestly sounds like too much work considering I would almost never play it on mobile, thanks though.
---
Fuck me my bad kinda tired don’t believe everything u read on reddit
---
Open your mouth.
---
That was my main problem it takes like 5 minutes to do but when I did I never had time to play and when I had time I was like I’ll just play on PC
---
If only there were more than one button for every single interaction in the game!
---
Hey JonTron you are man of culture
---
This is literally the best thing I've ever seen.
---
Thanks but I don’t even use that account anymore it was linked to my PlayStation account from around 8 years ago
---
Just replace her with the Wing Diver from EDF. I can see where this is going and there's no chainsaw like a laser chainsaw.
---
Why am I not surprised you resort to calling someone a racist when you've run out of other options?
---
Let me make it simple for you sport. Lets take a look at another DBD-esque game, Soul At Stake. 
---
Game has a terrible population in North America. Like, it has trouble keeping triple digit players.
---
However it is flourishing in the Asian markets. Like gangbusters. So much that for awhile, the popular thing to do was to infiltrate the chinese servers the play on them, latency be damned. 
---
Now I could stomp my feet and cry and whine that the developers should do more to make the North American servers full of people. Or I could put on my big boy pants and accept the fact that much like many Korean MMORPGs that also exist currently, I'm not the intended market audience. And instead I can play games that already exist for me to play on.
---
&gt; Non existent loops. There's just not enough debris to loop the killer around regardless where you go (that one map in Macmillan estate, for example) 
---
It's very rare after they spread out the pallet spawn in previous patches
---
&gt;Lack of resources. When is near the end of the game and the resources have been used by others. 
---
By that time the gates are almost open
---
&gt;Killers-pro maps. These are maps that are just non conducive for survivors for to either being too small or too enclosed to easily evade anything
---
True. 3 maps in the whole game which have many God loops except the demogorgon map. The game for example, every pallet is a safe one except for very few cases
---
I guess you're awful as a survivor if you don't see the power survivors have. I feel way more powerful as a solo survivor than killer and is way less stressful too. You can be caught yes, if you fuk up repeatedly
---
This might be of no help, but have you verified the inegrity of your game files? Go to steam, right click on DBD, select properties, go to local files, and select the last option (verify game files).
---
This is the most basic thing you can do, but it surprisingly works a lot. If it doesn't, some other computer god redditor must help you
---
&gt;I'm not the one who categorised am entire country of citizens as you put it "Bumfuckistan".
---
Considering I don't actually know where you live, and the only quality you've mentioned about it is that it apparently has no one living in it and playing DBD, I think my description is rather apt. 
---
And for the record, I don't actually care where you live. If it would make you feel better, I could refer to it as "middle of bum-fucking nowhere". 
---
But anyway, you're trying to deflect the issue because you've got nothing else. I'm sorry-not sorry you live in some area where no one else plays DBD. Guess you should have done a little research on the player counts. 
---
But the last thing BHVR should do is cater to whiny disconnecters who feel they should keep the ability to ruin games because of trivial reasons. Because that's what you came into this conversation championing.
---
There's so many bugs in this game that I told myself I that I would refuse to spend another dime on it until the devs can get their shit together.... Unfortunately like the devs not fixing the bugs I couldn't stick to my promise
---
Sooo...basically being a Killer, then. Eh, let them be salty.
---
I disagree. I do play swf here and there but got almost all the challenges done solo because I’m too selfless with friends it took too long to get them done swf. 
---
I think if anything the tome challenges made you be more altruistic as survivor but I wouldn’t go as far to say it literally forced you to play swf because it honestly didn’t because I and I’m sure many others are living proof of that. They aren’t that hard, and imo are easier than the killer challenges.
---
No you don't need the DLC to play. The DLC is useful as it gives access more perks and killers but it's not *needed* to be successful.
---
There is no seasonal objectives to complete. The things you have to work towards is the Rift Pass, Archives Lore, &amp; the Character Teachables.
---
No there is no subscription to pay for. There is however the rift pass, which is just essentially a battle pass in every way but name.
---
Type: In Game
---
Description: Wraith's uncloak haste is either much shorter than it's supposed to be or it will decays when it isn't supposed to. The speed boost does not appear to stack with lunge, even though it's supposed to. Canceling an uncloak makes attacking impossible for a time,  an undocumented revert of an earlier change.
---
Reproduction Rate: 100%
---
Don’t forget 100% blood points too :)
---
Well you did a phenomenal job this is amazing
---
thats why I play killer. letting noone down but myself. its a much more chill experience
---
I usually just respond with "k" and leave it at that. Most of them call me one more foul word and then respectfully piss off, but a select few of these absolute walnuts will just explode at the sight of this letter and write me an essay of pure hatred. I usually assume one of two things: they lose a lot and are tired of it or they're entitled losers. The first is at least sort of understandable if not excusable.
---
For the same reason people put their shit on private. Except idc if someone sends me messages. I won't see it until after the match or when I feel like opening them. I like being able to play my games without notification spam popping up every 2 seconds.
---
I’ll place some to shut down loops, not expecting them to last longer than the chase,  but even ones I’ll place around to catch people not being chased or not being careful seem to get busted really quickly. It’s to the point I’ll run the red spring whenever I have it because then I know I’ll at least injure them regardless.
---
Pretty much lol
---
(leaks by daylight) kinda tired can’t exactly remember the source gave out a list of the most played and efficient killers in all ranks. That would be your best guess as to who to buy if you’re really stuck. I’m like 99% sure it was leaks by daylight
---
i actually just played killer for the first time, and people told me i have a small pp
---
It's a flashback joke, I think. Bill's a Vietnam war vet, and he also fought against the undead. Some of the killers are bringing him flashbacks of some of the zombie types he had to face.
---
I know one of those perks is Inner Strength but what’s the other?
---
Tried this, second last option
---
Worked perfectly!
---
Thank you kind stranger :) 
---
Happy hunting/surviving &lt;3
---
What is p3?
---
So do the posts tbh.
---
Don't forget physically.
---
Ah okay that makes more sense. I hope OP doesn't think I'm trashing them. It's a very good artsyle
---
No, never physically. That leaves evidence.
---
Np at all I meant it, keep it up and I have no problem giving you a follow this art is genuinely cool imo, gn &lt;3
---
legion can help u farm bp, spirit is super fun and u dont need a specific build for her, is pretty versatile actually.
---
good way to make sure they don't know about your smol pp problem is to facecamp the hook and attack them while they are on hook to assert dominance. they will realize who the alpha is instantly
---
Devs said on stream the other day they we would be seeing the ranking system acting weird. This will be going on thru the Christmas holiday.
---
Prestige 3 lol
---
Looping and trying to survive is not bullying. Sometimes killers play badly and end up being the same rank as me, why should I not try to survive vs the killer in a game where you can play as someone trying to survive vs a killer. Since they “fixed” matchmaking, my green ranks friend has been playing against red ranks killers when we play together, and not once have either of us expected any of them to go easy on him, or called it bullying/toxic when they caught/killed him. Playing the game is not bullying.
---
Also r/nocontext probably fits in there better tho.
---
I agree with that last part - level 3 was initially WAAY harder and grindier than level 4 was.
---
you wanna play together? i got it on xbox and steam
---
I heard that if I use Doctor with BBQ and Chilli and Distress I could get lots of BP. Is Legion still better than Doc?
---
OhTofu would like to have a word with you. 
---
Or Battlguy
---
So the survivors just need to be crows?
---
Anyone ever watch Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th?
---
Old DS was basically a get out of jail free card.
---
The way it worked is that a few seconds after the obsession is picked up they can use it.
---
Basically you had no chance of hooking them if a hook wasn't close enough.
---
And it could also be used by non obsession survivors like how DS works now. For non obsession survivors they had to get thw wiggle meter to 25%.
---
Imagine going against 4 survivors using DS it was the most unfair perk survivors had you basically couldn't play the game because of it.

About time!

But, I'm currently making 30k-50k with The Cannibal atm
---
I'm honestly really excited to hear it. Michael April is such an amazing composer and to hear his take on Doctors theme would be an absolute treat for the ears
---
furries rejoice
---
Thanks for not being a total dickbag like the other guy. Some people don't like to tryhard every fucking game like that guy does apparently.
---
Do you play on PC? Something about this clip looks insanely good
---
Oh me too except I’m new to reddit I have no clue what in the hell I am doing BUT I’m doing it 😹
---
I love monstroush shrine tbh
---
I had this happen to me, killer picked me up and stood there waiting to see if I were to start wiggling.
---
We just waited for each other, I figured he wanted me to wiggle out as he didn't move.
---
As soon as I started wiggling, he hooked me and told me in post game I shouldn't have.
---
Truly outrageous.
---
It’s not their jobs to listen to the community either. Their jobs are just to develop the game. Listening to the community and playing their own game will help drastically though.
---
The other day as survivor I had a match where I could only find four pallets the entire map. I had a challenge to stun the killer a few times so I was actively looking for decent pathing but it only had four.
---
Meanwhile, when I'm killer I get Temple with a pallet every 5 feet.
---
Killers aren't the power role in this game when you're up against good survivors. At this point, you should've just ignored her and pressure the people on gens. You could also slug them if you're in a bad position like in this clip.
---
This is why this sub is cringe
---
He's entertaining when he uploads
---
Congrats
---
Lowkey this is way funnier than Pig on a Rig and I'm annoyed you got the better deal.
---
Thank you!
---
These threads? They are being stopped. Matchmaking screenshots are against sub rules. Just give it a few hours, this thread should be deleted.
---
&gt;Yeah I'd rather wait the 30 minutes than waste 10 minutes for a bad/unfun match.
---
Have you not been here when people spammed threads complaining about being in queue for over 5 minutes without finding a match?
---
Is there a bird version? Like a feathery?
---
Nice!
---
Ironically my claudi is prestige 3 haha
---
Why the fuck was the legion with david... i'm still pissed about that.
---
Everything I just mentioned has to do with survivors making a mistake 
---
1) getting caught where there is no loop 
---
2). Teammates fucking up 
---
3) most maps even tho are killer sided still aren’t that great especially for most killers ( ie nurse on any indoor map same a billy ... clown can get wrecked in any map even if killer sided so can bubba) 
---
So thanks for proving my point the only time a killer can actually win good survivors is if the survivors fuck up if they play a good game the killer will lose
---
   We did it the entity is no more
---
Most of the time streamers that consistently get viewers in the thousands read donations out between games/while in queue and even while in a match your message being noticed relies on pure chance of them looking at the chat at the right moment in time.  There's almost no real difference whether your message is seen 20 seconds later or seen in real time because there's no ultimate guarantee either way. 
---
Stream sniping isn't cheating, regardless.  Cheating in a game is bending the rules or breaking them in some way that was never intended to be done, such as speedhacking or seeing through walls or going through walls.  Stream sniping is a risk, a potential disadvantage you impose on yourself, something any streamer should know damn well what they're inviting in if they don't take any preventative measures and thus the solution to this problem should come to how they address it.  Wanting the developers to stop whatever they're doing because someone decided to broadcast themselves to the world and deal with these individuals swiftly is ludicrous and a waste of time. 
---
The game isn't going to be sold by streamers.  I bet most people play DBD because of the cross-over appeal it has with other horror based IPs.  What sounds more realistic: Truetalent made you want to buy the game or being able to play as horror film icon Michael Myers from Halloween?  
---
We can brainstorm all the ways and all the subsystems on how to address this stream sniping thing, but I think the easiest way to do so is also the most obvious: put on a stream delay.
---
And Oni is a Tank
---
BHVR gave everyone cosmetics a while ago, you will also have the David donkey jacket, dweard for Dwight, chuckles trapper mask, and so on
---
It would be meta at low ranks if it were 100% lol. Maybe even some people at high who can’t hit checks but are good at running
---
Yikes :/
---
Yes, pretty sure they are.
---
There's a whole science involved in those "dings". A lot of games, particularly popular shooters, are designed to hijack and trigger your dopamine system; dopamine being the chemical released in your brain whose sole purpose is literally reward.
---
Our brains haven't caught up evolutionarily to living in civilisation, so they still act as if we're hunter gatherers. Games basically tap into this and trick you into playing more by using visual and auditory stimulus to trigger a response. Ding; your first kill (you found some spoor). Ding; your first multikill (you spotted the deer). Ding; your first win (you killed the deer).
---
Sounds harmless, right? Problem is, issues arise when you expand that system, as developers and publishers have, into all the "recurrent user spending" mechanics that have been forced into games these days, such as MTX's and gambleboxes. You start running into people who issues with gambling, and spending management, and these practices deliberately target and predate on those people, ruining their lives as bad or worse than "traditional" gambling problems.
---
Everyone got them. I don’t have the special edition and I have it
---
Right now it's only Doctor getting chase music. They did say however that they will most likely be adding new chase music to killers who are getting reworked or changed. They are also most likely going to keep up the trend of giving new killers chase music as well since both Demogorgon and Oni got chase music when they released.
---
Iirc Moe was into Marge, could be way off base since i saw it so long ago though

what I meant to say is that in red ranks, you can depip because the killer is AFK in the corner of the map. There are no chase points and no altruism points to be awarded in that case, so you will depip. Which is stupid.
---
im talkin no bbq/offerings, if u stack bbq u double that afc 50/60k bp a game, also be realistic, ur either the best bubba or u are still low ranks and survivors go really easy on u and let u get that much, leatherface is really easy to bully
---
i Still love the oni , the only killer that can you call "oni-chan"
---
Maurice?
---
Because if they put him with Jeff people would know something's up because, at the time, we didn't have two survivors in one chapter
---
But my big boy ;-;

They'll be available just like all the other Christmas stuff was.
---
Colors we-
---
Yea i’ve been playing the game for a long time now and it’s honestly shocking how many people are advocating this. I really thought the majority of this sub was against toxic behavior but I guess I was wrong. I’ve been noticing a lot more teabagging/ clicking in matches lately as well, i suppose it makes more sense now. I guess only killers can be toxic in this game.
---
Bro I swear if you don't eat that good shit Freddicini Alfredo are you even eating?
---
That's so dishonest wow.. or ignorant, depends
---
&gt;The major difference between Survivor BM and Killer BM is that Killer BM completely stops another player from having any fun
---
Fun is subjective
---
&gt;Getting slugged, camped, tunneled, or Mori'd means that player is doing absolutely nothing, and then getting booted from the game. Thanks for joining that Killer's lobby... And there's nothing they can do about it either. That's Dead By Daylight for survivors, if they get a toxic killer.  
---
Yeah but let's take it one by one.
---
Slugged. This is a strategy and also risky since if you do it in the wrong way you just lose emblem points, you don't progress towards hooks and can be easily countered. Is an high risk high reward thing
---
Camped. Same thing since if you mindlessly camp you just depip and lose plus if you do that isn't boring only for survivors but also the killer that's just looking at a survivor dying, which takes forever
---
Tunnel. Same thing since the survivor has the opportunity to just waste time at that point due to BT, DS, God loops and so on. Idk why even bring it up
---
"There's nothing they can do" yes there are. BT, do gens, use Ds are very valid options
---
&gt;Meanwhile, seeing a survivor character model point or crouch doesn't change your gameplay at all. If that alone irritates someone, then they probably shouldn't be playing online games anyway. Who was it that popularized the idea that any survivor emote is "toxic" anyway?
---
That's not it, that's why I called you dishonest. Seems like you totally ignore the fact that playing killer is **way** more stressful since every second matter, in a chase as well as the whole match. Additional stress can be brought when you feel powerless and be humiliated by the survivors that spams emote and tbags to increase your frustration and you still cannot do much about it. The most common example, exit gates where you are literally in **God mode** and the killer can't do shit about it
---
&gt;It seems so silly to me that when you're chasing people to stab them and put them on a sacrificial hook, being pointed at is apparently bullying. Like, I'm all for more sensitivity in most situations, but this is one of those times Killers need to calm down and just understand if anything the Survivor is slowing them self down to emote.
---
I guess you totally ignore the fact they do that because they feel in control, they feel in power and shove that power at your face by doing that
---
You say killers need to calm down for taking issue with survivors who shows their power in the most toxic way possible but at the same time if the killer do something that 1 has a counter 2 punish hims more than the survivor, then that's too far.
---
I see a very clear double standard here
---
Daddy
---
HONESTLY this is amazing and i never thought about this before!! it's funny and a great art style, i hope your "poor bill"s get plenty of upvotes for the art and the l4d references !
---
I know they stack when it comes to vaulting speed, so it would only make sense you also get the gen speed.
---
Hey man don't worry about it. My advice as a rank one survivor would be to split pressure and work on a different generator. Don't work on gens with others until you've mastered skill checks and a good way to practice is to not work on gens with your teammates until you're confident in your ability to hit skill checks. Good luck.
---
The Plague is pretty obvious
---
I got it last night after many matches like that
---
available all the time?
---
Yoink!
---
I understand getting salty if a survivor is doing a gen in your face because they have DS active, but facecamping when they’re toughing it out because the gens at like 98%? Yikes
---
Frankly if spine chill is active especially if injured you probably want to hop off that gen and go somewhere else. So I don't see this working the way you are Envisioning it to begin with before we consider if the stats are worth it.
---
Yes
---
When the Claudette sets off the hag trap for the fifth time
---
I knew the original challenges were ok
---
..............just deep wound and leave.
---
God I HATED waiting around with both exit gates open for like 20 minutes because the Blendette wanted to cleanse every Totem and loot every Chest before she strolled her way out.
---
Exactly, make them harder if they want but have it as a checklist
---
Look at the news tab more often dude.
---
Nice, i finally got mine aftet 200h gameplay haha
---
OMG ITS [GOLD.DO](https://GOLD.DO) MORE
---
Nice dude. I thought you were going to both get taken. by the entity for sure. Those end game plays are seriously what makes playing survivor fun imo, and why it’s always worth it to try to be a hero lol
---
Haha beginners luck, I only have 7 hours but definitely trying to get some more
---
Or bond?
---
At those times you just gotta slug and hope for the best.
---
Tfffff
---
Adorable artwork. I hope your future games are more enjoyable
---
That's accounting for BBQ and Chile.
---
Once you get Leatherface's teachable Legion should yield around 50-60k
---
Goodjob tho :D when i just started i didnt even know a hatch existed etc haha
---
People can choose to grind or not. A lot of the events were grinds too
---
im ngl the "() gang" memes always make me giggle
---
Haha I have some great friends showing me the ropes, love the community in this game
---
I liked a lot of the challenges like 'Do X two times in one game' but the stuff like 'Heal 15 survivors' and stuff got grindy
---
Just ignore the toxic people tho, they can bring u down but at the end its just a game dont let em get in your head :p
---
Hey, be nice to me :(
---
the snitch finally got stiches
---
The Fortnite battlepass was extended by almost 3 months, there isn’t enough content or challenges to sustain nearly 6 months worth of gameplay because when it was created it was the traditional 3 month content drop.
---
Oh boy you gonna have a really bad time when doctor gets his rework.
---
Hope your ready for reverse skill checks.
---
Yeah, my 1st game dude commented on my steam page because I drank from fountain then touched something poisoned after, now I know not to do that haha
---
I was already considering leveling Feng for that perk only. I have a really hard time consistently hitting normal skill checks, the great ones are so random and really out of my league, lol. I love this game but I'm far from a decent player. I know the basic and advanced techniques, but I lack the proper hand coordination to excell at it.
---
honestly to the people saying 6 is too young? no offense but live a little man. i was playing gorey games when i was 6 and 🤷 they're probably watching movies that show even worse. not that it's exactly OKAY, but. you don't gotta come @ someone tryna have fun with their niece
---
7 attempts of mine have been cucked by survivors. As soon as I fucking get this challenge done I am going to spend the rest of the rift trying to basement all 4 people away just to they disconnect and lose all their points for literally nothing.
---
Yea mine is also full of - rep - toxic etc while im sure im not toxic, even if someone gets unhooked right in front of me i ignore the injured and go for the healthy, if i down same person twice in a minute im not even hooking them, and i always let last one escape through hatch, yet im toxic, camping, wallhack etc
---
Is he using Lightweight?
---
My reaction time is really slow. Just how I am basicly at everything. I will try that approach, thanks.
---
Well hiding against the doctor is nearly impossible in some scenarios. A terror radius build in the game or Lery's? Good luck.
---
Yeah it’s just unfortunate, like you just trynna so your job lmfao
---
Depends on the child.
---
My sisters are obsessed with horror movies/games even though they get scared easily.
---
Clown looks like a boomer as well, and I'm not talking about the one from l4d
---
I don't know man i would really change ruin for nurse's calling you will be there before they even have a chance to fully heal
---
Here are some problems with some killers. 
---
Legion obviously needs a Freddy-style rework, to the point where his new power barely resembles what he originally started off with.
---
Bubba's addons suck and it's incredibly easy to bump into objects with him. Furthermore, you have to get right up behind a survivor before using his saw, and by the time you've got it all revved up, you lose so much freaking distance. 
---
Pig's addons aren't terrible, but barely any of them stack with each other. Seriously, out of all of them, I think 3 or 4 addons actually stack with another, and unless I'm mistaken, the things that stack are her RBT boxes, ambush charge speed, and ambush miss cooldown. Also, Amanda's Letter just takes away too much to be that great. There's also the fact that Amanda can barely see shit while she's crouched. 
---
Trapper's traps need so much attention its not even funny. Wraith needs a little attention as well, and clown's power is, well, kinda meh. Like it could definitely be a little better, but at the same time, it's not total horseshit either.
---
I fucking love killers that dance and shit, mercy or no mercy. I once had a Myers that didn't let me go, and ended up watching me when I was the last one alive but first stage on hook. I started raving. He started nodding in sync with me. We just did that until I suicided on second stage, and even as I was pulled into the sky, my Spine Chill was going on and off, meaning he was *still* raving. Best death ever.
---
Also, bonus points for Running in the 90s meme.
---
Pretty good, have you considered spirit fury?

Oh. About that I use head phones that let me hear foot steps well so I might try and get nurses but it might take a while. :P
---
Cool, you could also pair it with brutal strength to shred pallets too
---
Just saying, y'all would've hated dbd in like 2016/2017 when the lighting was even darker and spookier
---
Or my favorite, when you are repeating a generator, and you don’t unhook the guy cause you expect your teammates that are just going around doing clicky click with a flashlight, and he -rep “CROUCHED CORNER OF MAP INSTEAD OF UNHOOKING “
---
Tbh I kinda think that brutal is kinda useless because the saw with some addons breaks pallets faster.  But it's ok if you use it!! It depends on how you play dbd.
---
It's funny. I say this to defend killers and I get told that I should've been aborted.
---
Fucking ironic, isn't it? Survivors get to do whatever they want, but killers need to follow some sort of made-up rules, right?
---
From /u/Waterbuffa1oman's post history:
---
&gt; Good? You mean broken iridescent add on, survivors got their iridescent add ons nerfed. Killers turn
---
Complaining about Killer add-ons? Check.
---
-----
---
&gt; Not my fault you lack ability to string together hooks without camping
---
Bitching about killer using a built-in strategy that BHVR says they aren't taking away? Check.
---
&gt; Slugging and camping is ok for hatch tho right? 😂
---
Here's the sarcasm as he complains about killers slugging, another built-in tactic that BHVR says is fine.
---
Notice a fucking trend?
---
Just another entitled, hypocritical survivor main. Always bitching about killers but trying to defend his role. Survivors get to do whatever they want but killers need to follow his made-up rules.
---
Hey /u/Waterbuffa1oman! I'm sorry that killers use perks and items and tactics the developers put in the game in a combination they were intended.
---
Now kindly go fuck yourself, ya hypocrite!
---
This challenge is just awful. I've been trying it for days using everything from playing dirty, which I hate even doing to trying my luck with the perks to slow down wiggle times and increase transport speed to making the basement a trap zone while always staying close to it while someone's hook, and a combination of all of the above, and it never works. There's no fun to be found when doing that challenge. It sucks for both sides. When I'm playing Survivor and I notice someone's sweaty trying to get me into the basement I just let them do it so they have a shot at getting the challenge done. I'll take the loss for them to do the challenge but then my teammates roast me. I just feel bad for the Killers who are desperately trying to get this challenge done.
---
When I'm trying to do this challenge no one's having it. Like with others if I dare get even close to finishing it someone disconnects because they don't like a basement party. Basement parties always seem to result in DCs. This challenge needs to be nerfed. Even just sacrificing three, not four, people in the basement in a single match would make it managable.
---
Exactly this haha, how many times this happened, or everyone running at the hook to save you and thry all get downed and then saying im a shit survivor while they all went down in a 5m radius lol
---
? I don’t understand why people shit on trapper. He’s me go to when I just need to destroy people and I use him to get to red ranks every season. He’s badass.
---
For Ghostface, I'd recommend running two of his starting perks, Thrilling Tremors and I'm All Ears, and Sloppy Butcher and Any Information Perk you can get if you don't have BBQ and Chili (I personally recommend Whispers since it makes finding survivors at the start of any match far less annoying)
---
Thrilling Tremors is an acceptable substitute for Ruin before you unlock it, as well as doubling up as a half-assed Information Perk. Pick someone up, and you see any Gens that aren't being worked on turn White, as well as preventing people from working on other Gens for the next 16 seconds.
---
Sloppy Butcher is also particularly good on Ghostface for jumping from one survivor to the next, then from that survivor to another, and so on and so forth. If you want some good gameplay of someone putting using this perk greatly, I'd recommend searching up "TrU3Ta1ent" and watching one of his Ghostface Videos, or even "not Otzdarva"
---
And Lastly, I'm All Ears is great for learning how to mindgame survivors early on, since you can see what they're doing, and having the ability to hide your Killer's Aura and Red Stain on Ghostface allow for some sneaky tricks to be done.
---
Ace has built in Iron will
---
My idea is to make DS an anti tunneling perk that is more effective and not affect the entirity of the gameplay by equiping a very strong perk. I genuinely hate getting tunneled and i feel like DS should help me more because there's only so much you can do if the killer tunnels you 24/7.
---
*Basement Camp Bubba, using Insidious, has joined the chat*
---
They honestly need to overhaul the survivor side, i finished tome 3 in days of release and im still struggling to get the survivor challenges on tome 3 just because devs want us to use very weak perks and do challenges that are just dumb, one of said challenges is complete 4 gens with dark sense, yes i know you just need to finish it off but it encourages SWF and is still really hard even with that
---
Ok, cause I am bad at killer right now. I can’t hit anyone they keep looping and tea bagging
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
I just got one of those in the first 45 seconds of the match. Feels bad man.
---
&gt;Using bear traps on bears - boring, old fashioned. 
---
&gt;Using bear traps on humans - too cliche, overdone. 
---
&gt;Using bear traps on crows - ***REAL SHIT***
---
As a survivor player, i find it really annoying to go up against tunnelers, i just wanted to make DS an effective anti tunneling perk that promotes a killer to go after a different survivor and punishes tunneling the same survivor. If the killer doesn't tunnel, he never gets effected by DS. If he does, he essentially wastes his own time just to kill 1 survivor. I do agree that more perks should get reworked like this is not happening and etc though
---
I did it solo. It basically encourages you to not save your team and rather use them as bait. I got it done when the killer was camping hooks in the basement. You just have to get lucky.
---
Maybe you’ve just figured out how to play him more effectively than I can. Idk, all I know is the only times I get frustrated on DBD is when I’m getting bullied as Trapper, because I don’t know what I’m supposed to do at that point. They break the traps, they make the saves, they loop you around because Trapper can only shut down loops when he drops a trap and even then if they’re SWF they’ll disarm it while you’re getting looped so it’s gone and then they run back to the loop again,
---
Man I can’t even play on Larry’s or Hawkins Lab without experiencing severe frame drops. I’m talking about missing easy hits 😤
---
Sorry it uploaded sideways :/ hopefully you can see what happened. She teleported and hit me.
---
me: *misses a skill check*
---
everyone else working on the gen: *sprint burst noises*
---
Great idea, but how would it work if someone unhooks you right in front of the killer when he is just about to leave the area. Like would the killer have to go after the other dude, hook him then hook the other downed survivor? Im just open for discussion.
---
Not sure if the recent update messed something up (knowing Behavior they fucked something up lol) but yeah, it’s bogus
---
Ooh that is unfortunate :/ those maps are nice it sucks that they cause frame drops. Have you noticed it being a problem with a certain killer/cosmetic? On the Nintendo switch I notice that the wraith has a cosmetic that tanks fps for some reason
---
I dont understand it. I swear call of duty game chat back on mw2 wasnt even this bad. Dbd has the most toxic community iv ever seen. I get alot of shit for playing litterally any killer and it makes no sense. Im hardly even playing the game anymore i honestly cant deal with it. People will always tell me to just turn my messages off but then ill never find the decent people.
---
Give some ideas to rebalance my dude otherwise your criticism isn't really helpful.
---
I have really bad anxiety (because of alcoholism, totally unrelated to the game and I'm just being sincere), so when other survivors join in the gen I find pointing the camera away from them and away from the action (I run kindred) helps a lot.
---
Is this from something? Or cosplayers?
---
Pictures taken moments before disaster. Birds edition.
---
Probably the same bug where you complete a challenge and nothing happens like wgen alot of people had problems with Tome 3.
---
Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling, Thanatophobia. Makes it almost too easy.
---
Vaulting speed was fixed, that was never supposed to be a thing
---
Intriguing... perhaps a new console? I too play on PS4, but my console sounds like an airplane taking off
---
The title is wrong it should be “Oh Hi- AAAAAAAAAA!”
---
Cannibal:
---
I believe the problem lies with the medkit running out. I had no problem with it while running Botany Knowledge and ranger medkit with good addons. I believe you can't let the medkit run out. That's the only thing I can think of.
---
Feelsbadman
---
I figured as much. but the thing is, I dont have enough medkits for that because that doctor game was the 2nd game I've had all day where a killer slugged. so i dont have enough of the medkits that are good enough for that .
---
Damn... maybe try my build? I use save the best for last, enduring, brutal strength, and nurses calling. It’s strong as fuck. Couple that with a tar bottle and some trap setters and you can seriously punish loopers. Survivors constantly underestimate how quickly
---
I can be back in the chase and I always catch them off guard when healing. And fast traps that are hard to see means you can trap windows and narrow pathways quickly without losing too much momentum, and actually get a return on your investment. 
---
If you still struggle, protect 3 gens. With that build, the 3 gen tactic is fucking unstoppable. I beat red rank swf regularly by keeping them all injured and only focusing on gens. Eventually they will make a mistake, then you down them and hang them up near the gens so they have to bomb the hook while injured. It’s a very powerful position to hold. 
---
Other than that, try to focus on corralling survivors into your traps. I tend to place them in the open, but in a place I see survivors run through and I get tons of traps. I got the 4 trap rift challenge in the first try lol. 
---
I’m no pro or anything but I’m consistently rank 5-3 every season so I feel comfortable saying it’s a good build. Best of luck my friend!
---
I've got respect for both you. Keep fighting the good fight.
---
Thanks 😁

You could use DS at any time you wanted, you just had to be picked up by the killer. The killer could counter this by dropping you on the ground before the skill check appeared. Now DS is active up to a minute after being unhooked.
---
Why those add-ons
---
Just why
---
Pretty standard and it works
---
You don't actually have to heal from dying all the way to healthy. You can heal two different survivors as long as the amount you heal is equivalent of two health states. And if it indeed says "finish healing" then you don't even have to do that. Just be there when the survivor gets healed.
---
Yo you got my double pepperoni meat lovers pizza with stuffed crust dwight?
---
I agree but having an opinion will get you downvotes so you just gotta roll with the circle jerk flow
---
I actually have a clip of this happening to me on ps4 against a ghost face, I don't really want to record video with my phone though.
---
i am not looking forward to the nurse archive challenges
---
Ya but you cut it in half with that last chainsaw sprint
---
I wear my heart on my sleeve so yeah I am going to get offended. I need to rant or take a 10 min break for playing again. I love this game but the toxic people ruin it and it is a shame. I don’t really care if it is giving them what they want I just report them and move on in game at least. I just need to release all my negativity to feel good again.
---
Agreed. Dailies in this game are lacking in general, though. Other games that have daily log-in bonuses give out all kinds of currency, including small amounts of real money currency as incentive to actually log-in daily.
---
I'm not logging in every day for just 25~40k bloodpoints that force me to play a character I probably don't want to play.
---
I turned a 1k into a 4k yesterday against a swf. They broke my 3gen but tried far too hard to bully me in the end that some traps I'd placed at the beginning of the game got triggered. They got pissed at that so much they'd all left before I finished looking at the post game results.
---
Best game of the night by far.
---
You get punished for:  
---
Killer that did nothing the entire game  
---
Being chased all game  
---
First hook death  
---
Terrible teammates  
---
And...
---
Ebony mories that are unbalanced as much as the key.
---
*Tryndamere would like to know your location*
---
If u don’t care about giving them what they want, you shouldn’t care about them being toxic then.
---
omg, why didn't I think of that? that may not work every time, but probably still better than hoping for a friendly killer
---
So I should just be ok with being verbally abused on the internet and not say anything. I just wanted to say my opinion that’s it.
---
I helped a guy out with his 4 stun challenge last night. 
---
Then he helped my with my kill obsession one.
---
thanks, I'll try that :)
---
I have all communication off on ps4. That dosen't stop people from somehow finding me here on reddit and harassing me after a game. I really hate how shitty some people are.
---
I use inner strength(nancy 40 perk), iron will( jake perk), kindred, and dead hard. Sometimes ill switch out kindred for borrowed time or decisive strike. It really just comes down to your playstyle tbh.
---
I did that exact thing LMAO 
---
my Jake is still lvl 30, with iron will still unlocked and visible in the blood web 🤣
---
I tried to find out but I couldn't, it's on Google if you search "the legion dbd"
---
I thought that was a raw chicken breast and was wondering why it was there. Now it makes sense lol
---
I like to think there 3x as many polite and good willed people online then there are bad. I feel like the competitive nature of ranked just breeds this sort of thing
---
Just watched.  He’s realllllly bad.  I know we all gotta start somewhere but yeesh.
---
I main Claudette because I used to play Laurie then saw at least 2 other Claudettes in my lobby every time so I thought i'd try, I used self care as a first perk and then she got to level 15 in around 5 games then in only 80 hours I got her to P3 and now she's like an only child because I play her every game unless I need to do a daily. I don't hate Claudettes when I play killer but I feel bad for her due to her backstory which was sad.
---
nearse
---
So he’s supposed to just let himself get hooked?  Hun, no
---
I had the perk on, but i didnt get the guy off the hook
---
okay thanks
---
It’s a shitpost, and a joke line, tough guy David saying that to Myers right before stabbed....:not every dbd meme post needs to have in game footage or a characters face on it
---
You did, you were just drunk and drugged up out of your mind so you don’t remember
---
let's see....
---
Clown - Boomer
---
Billy - Charger
---
Hag - Witch
---
Plague - Spitter
---
Legion - Hunter
---
Oni - Tank
---
Its explicitly obvious. No...but the internet is...you really just have no idea do you? 1) did anyone ask? does anyone fking care if you are a "wahman"? The "buddy"  part was reflecting the same shit you said to me. I know full and well what your gender is kid...and contrary to your belief you wont get different treatment because of it. 2) I also can call a trailer a home. 3) the only thing that sucks here is you; making a living these days is hard...I get it...
---
Now I see I will have to explain something to you because you are a dumb bitch (no pun intended). Kills dont matter to this situation...because if they did...I wouldnt be complaining. I am bringing up something that is broken and can be circumvented or removed by no skill RNG. 
---
Yeah, you are the problem.
---
Except for Nurse and Spirit you can 1v1 every killer in the game, and even those you can run long enough individually to at least win (I dunno what's fun for you, some people even like just being gen jockeys after all).
---
I definitely think DbD needs a fundamental overhaul to the gameplay loop, but you still absolutely have the power individually to win in the same way you always had. Even with double window shack and conditionless fast vaults you lost if your team just always crouches around and never does gens, after all.
---
Hmm okey, then it must be the medkit. I hope u get a good kit and beat the challenge! ^ ^
---
TL;DR: u gave me downvotes, now my feelings hurt :(
---
I think it’s against sub rules to shame anyone especially one person in particular; just a heads up
---
I am disappointed that there ditching the events... but atleast we are getting x2 bloodpoints soon.
---
I hit level 70 on 200 hours of continous playing without doing the challenges.
---

Dwight with a kite?
---
Kight*
---
Seriously, Claudette is one of my favorite characters because we have so much in common, but holy shit, it feels like whenever I play Claudette I get tunneled just for choosing her.
---
I don't teabag, I don't flashlight click and I don't use any items, and my favorite cosmetic is the bright white Fog Travelers shirt. I'm also not very good at looping. So there's no reason for it.
---
Sometimes I lose pip after pip after pip, then I change characters and get them all back. It's really crazy the hatred some people have for her.
---
Oi mates keep ye landlubber fingers off of me totems that I be using for me inner strength ya bilge rats!
---
Does calling me a kid or dumb bitch make you feel good about yourself? Lolololol,  takes a small man to try to belittle someone else the way you are over REDDIT. 
---
Totems are the ONLY thing we can do without a skill check,  they can ALREADY be slowed down with trill of the hunt. If they had a skill check, and thrill of the hunt we would never be able to clense totems. Get the FUCK over yourself. 
---
Not even going to argue with you about my "Trailer" because you aren't shit and I have not a fucking thing to prove. Sorry not sorry. Grow up,  and get over yourself KiD.
---
Dwight as high as a kite?
---
those are the players that can only win against a baby killer, let them enjoy their only escape of the day, u will find better opponents eventually
---
Isn't it obvious already? Alright, it seems you see nothing wrong in a FREE 5 SECONDS stun that CANNOT be evaided by killer and that can be used 3 TIMES per match by EVERY survivor..
---
You guys should try playing League of Legends on the EUNE server full of Polish kids and manchilds (and this isn’t racist. This server was made to keep Polish players away from the rest and for a long time was the only one offering Polish translation to make sure they stay there)
---
Imagine community so toxic they put it in quarantine
---
When I used to play with object of obesssion and saw killer afk I will try to bring other survivors to afk killer. 
---
One time I asked a claudette to come with me and as soon as we reached in front of afk killer I started pointing toward killer and killer started moving. Hell that was scary, got hit and then downed.
---
I mean it’s very clearly a rant the “fucking” wasn’t really needed but just saying as killer if I’m farming I’m not gonna not hook you. The more you resist the more I want to just kill you and get you out of the game anyways.
---
Somewhere down the line if I saw you while farming with other survivors and you weren’t willing because you “wanted to play the game right” I’ll happily throw you on the hook to kill you as fast as I can if that’s what you’re asking.
---
Thanato, Sloppy, Nurse’s, Ruin and don’t stalk much, just hide the terror radius, stalk only when free
---
I know, what I'm saying IS that you can't expect a team not able to design a properly working game to code a functionning mobile port
---

---
If you think cutting 5 seconds from a gen and vaulting slightly faster is worth your perk slots over second chances, go for it
---
Nothing in the shop is limited time
---
I think I played against this trapper yesterday. Was on temple map right?
---
Ngl I would use a colourblind mode cause I would think it looks nicer.
---
There are advantages in some games (In Lol your health bar is Gold, and allied ones are blue, so that they are not hard to see for folks with Red-Green, but your health bar being a separate color than your allies lets you pick yours out from a fight easier), but I cant think of a situation like that in DBD really. Other than Neon blue scratch marks might be too easy to see.
---
I didn’t have the “compete 4 gens using dark sense” and “stun the killer 4 times” challenges counted.
---
Ah yes, you don't like my post, so you must be toxic... right!
---
I can help maybe if you play PS4?
---
I (Rank 4 survivor) played against a rank 20 killer TWICE yesterday
---
Not really. 
---
You get BP offerings no matter what, and if you want items you're better off running a loot spec.
---
It has already been made. So yes, it is a repost.
---
While you're at it, stop watching TV, movies, listening to music, etc etc. If you find entertainment in what a streamer is doing there's nothing wrong with that. That's all a streamer is doing - trying to entertain their audience and getting paid for it is only fair for the amount of work they put into it. Even then, you can watch for free.
---
That's what I thought but the flare has a capital R in rant. And i used to leave and take 2 depips in low red ranks for players because they wanted to farm, Now i just avoid them and suicide on hook whenever i get caught
---
Yet you're happy to criticise him and his content when you don't actually know what his content is, and openly admit you don't watch it.
---
I'll never understand the mentality of "I don't like this person, so I'll keep watching them or criticising them". Just move on, and everyone would be happier as a result.
---
Nobody streamer gets salty. Shock!
---
That has actually happened to me a lot the past week or so... teammates just unhooking and stopping it constantly until I go into struggle phase or until the killer is right on the hook... I just DC if that happens. No point of playing with people like that trying to ruin the fun of the game for me and acting like an idiot
---
You just called him out for breaking the rules yourself though..
---
Yes but he said the streamer needed psychiatric help because he was angry and I'm just pointing out that this whole rant is pretty angry lol.
---
Yeah I agree man, I just wanna have fun on this game but it seems so damn hard, sometimes.
---
Is it even possible to lag switch on console?
---
That just proves my point.
---
Yeah you really seem like the arrogant asshole here if anything. I mean sorry if I’m harsh but I’m sick of entitled ass people thinking they’re right like you are the misunderstanding one here obviously.
---
Meh, this is about average for me regardless of what I'm playing lol. Killers and survivors both have acted pretty outrageously toward me post game
---
I must be cursed then, this shit happens to me all the time with pallets and traps. I get vacuumed into traps.
---
From which perspective are you talking about? You playing as a Killer and the Survivors trying to get you to farm, you playing as a Survivor and the Killer is farming, or your teammates farming in a match where the Killer is being serious? I don't think it should be a big deal if the Killer is obviously playing nice because it just means you can get a whole bunch of free points. It's harmless. If it's your teammates trying to farm and the Killer isn't interested than it's a big frigging problem because you're genuinely being screwed over since your teammates will get themselves killed, throwing the match off, or they'll straight up get you killed by unhooking you in front of a Killer who means business unless said Killer is nice enough to let you run away since you were unfairly farmed. I suppose if it's a farming match but you're not interested you can try pointing at the hook knowing it'll be your death hook, signalling that you want to leave the match although it might not work. Early when I started playing the game I had a Huntress farming when I was the last Survivor left. I think this was in a time when if no gens had been done and you were the last one left the hatch wasn't an option? I'm not sure exactly what the problem was for sure but I couldn't be bothered soloing gens and kept gesturing for her to sacrifice me but she refused.
---
I can think of about a million comparisons in which this logic is terrible in application.
---
Tell me where they are and I will lol, since they aren't here, this will do
---
Fuck it, let the 6 year olds parent themselves, amirite? So many parents are cucked by their kids.
---
Haha, 15% reduced chance to escape! Ha, who’s the fool n-
---
For me he comes off as a very FORCED, over actting manchild. Not on the level of Pedepie or whatever his name is. But its just fucking annoying. The guy comes off ultra fake. "I care about my youtube fans" Yeah I would care too if the sub count contributed to how much I got paided......oh wait.........
---
What did you expect to get from posting this?
---
Instead of being an arrogant asshole, why not give him some actual advice?
---
Discordance 1.. a man of culture I see
---
It's really annoying. I just don't dc because it doesn't benefit the people in the team who are actually playing and it depips me.
---
You are both acting like idiots.
---
*ur moms a cum zone*
---
It sounds like he's 12-13 years old and play Dead By Daylight because of Ninja
---
I love it! Ghost face?
---
Use the mouldy electrode, that really helped me and also try and aim for where they are headed not where they are
---
The current use of DS just makes it ridiculous: 
---
it is fine as an anti-tunneling perk, but all the faffing about that people are now using to bait you into picking them up, that's were I draw the line.
---
Repairing gens in my face, hopping into lockers in olain sight, sabotaging the hook they were just on, that's just utter BS.
---
DS should run out if you do anything but healing imo
---
No one said not to use any pallets at all either. You know there is such thing as a middle ground. A grey area. A middle track. You dont have to think polar opposites.
---
Sadly your second suggestion is arguably better than your first, though both are completely devoid of any level of intelligent thought.
---
Dammit Dwight, I've been reloading bottles since 4 (minutes ago)!
---
For example ruin tier 3 would be always active for 2 minutes. Or it would be necessary to cleanse 2 hex totems to break ruin. At the same time they should fix the totem spawn. So simple as make the code so no totem would spawn near a gen and no survivor would spawn in front of ruin.
---
the variety of console controllers smh
---
Those are Pedalos my dude
---
Heard doctor has a certain blind spot  area in front of him where he can’t shock survivors
---
Congratulations, that’s absolutely disgusting
---
I bought the premium pass, and you get auric cells back for certain tiers. My current plan is to get as many tiers as possible and then spend the cells I earned back on done tiers on the last day. I already earned more cosmetics with the 1000 cells I spent on the pass than I'd usually get for that amount so it's ok for me.
---
My knife hand on a meatball of lamb
---
Tbf I've come across baby legions that have absolutely no idea what they are doing. One guy didn't know how to use his frenzy and tried to tunnel survivors with it, activating it constantly. It was an easy and quick victory for us, but we decided to give him some legion tips when the game ended.
---
Any idea why it's gonna be acting weird ?
---
"That must be the feller who masturbates all day."
---
He starts out with 1 and then there is 5 across the map, what I have suggested is technically a nerf to the amount of traps he starts with because he starts off with 5.
---
Brown Addon adds 1 (Already does right now 1 + 1 he starts with)
---
Yellow Addons adds 2 (This will be a buff to this addon, currently is 1 + 1 he starts with + an additional carry slot)
---
Purple Addon adds 3 (Already does right now 2 + 1 he starts with)
---
I didn't think I needed to explain basics.
---
I agree simply because they jump-scare me when they fly past or I mistake them for someone else :(
---
You're a donkey or what? Every one got what happened here and instead of hooking him you let him go? Wtf is this video OMG. This game is about understanding his mechanics and profit on others mistakes. In this video the killer showed no understanding at all of game mechanics and you did not take advantage of survivor mistake. Waste of time.
---
You need to see Trapper mains or Otzdarva, every killer is powerful if you know how to play it,  but unlike the Trapper, not every killer can turn a 5 minute match in a 4k
---
Thank you! There was more footage before this save but I didn't want it to be too long. I hook tech'd in the basement right before this save. I'm still not the best player but I think im getting better when it comes to survivor mechanics.
---
15 mins for killer queue? What's this madness
---
No way? How'd that happen?
---
Smfh. Well I learned the hard way.
---
Iron will, and watch YouTube videos
---
Well I would be too, keys are bullshit and should be removed along with ebony moris.
---
The Tome challenges? You can’t progress them in kill your friends lobbies
---
*Clown
---
Let’s squad up sometime my dude, PS4 as well
---
Then you have to do a picture of him activating bloody fury ;d
---
If you're that close just hit them. I'm not sure tbh but shock therapy is best used at range to deny pallets and vaults.
---
Fucking Bulldog with Down syndrome, Fallout ghoul, stupid ass donkey ball smelling horse face piece of shit
---
Short version, from what I remember - there was a bug in late 2016 that let you swap the perks and equipment of killers onto other killers. This also extended to Survivor perks. It was a massive clusterfuck, I'm sure there are still YouTube videos on it from then
---
Makes me feel great. Does being a bitch and playing the victim make you feel good about yourself? Nah, it takes a cocksucking coward to put on the gloves and then play the victim once they realize they are out of their weight class.
---
"slowed down" TotH...LOL, ok sure...nah could actually make it easier given the right perk set but I wouldnt expect you to think of all possible outcomes with your pea sized brain.
---
Why? Because the truth hurts? Go stand in the comforting lies line then. Just make sure next time you come at someone you are tall enough to ride the ride...KID
---
Yea I know now.
---
I didnt play in si long I dont know what that even is or what you get if you conplete it.
---
Too many get out of jail free perks. Hate to see it. Poor Trapper.
---
Deliverance into DS 😩👌
---
Thanks for the info, will delete post now
---
Learn your loops jungle gyms, good loops, bad loops and god loops. Learn to 360 but use this only when you're not going to make it to a certain point. You have some decent vids on youtube for loops and 360s. Mindgaming is probably the hardest to master (faking window vault and pallet slides). Also you shouldn't worry about getting out of chases just keep the killer occupied as long as possible. Perks that will help you out are probably lithe, deadhard, adrenaline, desisive strike quick and quiet.
---
It’s like a private lobby if you will
---
I'm not sure you have listened to anything I said. 
---
First of all you said to me " I mean it was a rant the man just might not know the rules well " after you had said that he is breaking the rules. So my point with that is that you were telling me not to do the thing you just asked him not to.
---
Secondly he was the one who initially said that the streamer needed psychiatric help and I used that in reference to what he said to try and get him to see it's hypocritical.
---
Yeah I don't like negativity either
---
Incredible
---
Being downed doesn't actually punished you that much. How about you learn how emblems works before saying it sucks? 
---
[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://redd.it/8bvz68)
---
There are a lot of problems with Emblems but at least educate yourself and be objective when you say it sucks.
---
If you play Demogorgon frame drops are even worse, console optimisation sucks
---
OP also mentioned Totems, which go to Lightbringer Emblem so they wouldn't even matter after doing 4 gens (it also matters if they were done solo, with other survivors and if they were at 0%).
---
I think discordance is pretty useless since you already have bbq, maybe change it with spirit fury or nurse calling
---
The devs might not admit this, but I feep the game is balanced around Ruin.
---
I don't run it every game, but man do I notice the difference.
---
Without ruin you usually have two gens gone before you down the first survivor.
---
That does not mean you can't win without: there are a couple very strong killers with disgusting builds you can use, but for half the killers out there it's "no ruin, no party"
---
true but he did fight boomers tho, which are also akin to the plague
---
Wait so someone can’t have a change in opinion? Kindly go fuck your self you entitled piece of shit.
---
Dont tell me you use Bbq, ruin, spirit fury and enduring religiously?
---
Damn it I knew someone would say it.
---
Aren't there levels in L4D2 which allow you to play as bill and the original cast?
---
It's so easy to rank up as survivor though. I'm not even that great and got to rank 1.
---
All I did was run Bond and find people and heal them and let them heal me. Do gens whenever I'm not needed elsewhere. Use sprint burst and spine chill and get away from the killer early and get to a loop and then get chased for a bit, maybe cleanse 1 or 2 totems. I didn't even need to escape to pip as long as I did all that stuff.
---
I checked one of the survivors profile and they streamed on twitch I asked why are they so toxic like that and they replied with the end community  knows I'm toxic
---
Not_queen didn't criticize you at all.
---
I love how you went a looked at past posts yet opinions  can and will change overtime. How about you take your ignorance and shove it up your ass.
---
Who the fuck are you to talk?
---
Wait unsafe hooks make everyone lose the starting points?
---
just remember that you're playing a game bro. make it your new goal but don't let something this RNG ruin it for you. I got it on my first try and I'd like to think it was because I didn't stress it out (:
---
Everything you tried to throw at me was over 32d ago. 😂. You’re an actual moron.
---
I really hope they give us a little time before the next on drops.
---
There are just so many grindy challenges I still have to complete, plus a couple ultra hard ones you have to try for so very long to get.
---
If the next one drops before I had enough time to unlock the lote one's, I'll be done with them and won't even bother selecting the challenges anymore
---
Idk if you're on PC or Ps4 but this is how the red-rank games goes on Ps4.  Hop on a gen,  It's hex, 3 survivors sprinting around looking for the totem, I do a gen, they go down other's help, I complete another gen, get chased, go down or lose the killer because they want to tunnel and so it's rinse and repeat. I'm always muscling through generators but because I'm not being altruistic and other teammates are unsafe unhooking I'm being penalized? Kinda stupid
---
Sorry about the confusion! And I was a survivor playing a match, If i get a message from a non survivor i back out immediately assuming it's a farm request. I did not receive any such message though a random killed himself after a very short chase which I figured was from not wanting to farm as I would try to do later.  
---
The situation was the killer wanted to farm and one survivor agreed. 
---
I don't have an issue with them farming on their lonesome but they farmed me despite me clearly not wanting to farm.
---
Nee at the sea
---
Nea at the see-ah
---
&gt;Rift will close midchapter so you wont be able to collect it
---
The Rift (battle pass) =/= Tomes (challenges). 
---
Tomes will stay forever. Apparently the only thing that you won't be able to claim are rift fragments.
---
Is that Officer Doofy from Scary Movie??
---
I've seen them and they're not really an exception. If the survivors play trapper he loses unless his addons are anti everything. The main complaint is that playing killer is unfair as one survivor can get very good loops and tons of pallets while his teammates are on separate gens. In that regard i think a few killers could use a buff such as Trapper
---
I know the feeling, especially with the stupid emblem system they have right now. I have a rant about it somewhere let me find it
---
Sadly i didn't get the killers name but i reported him X amount of games ago along with the survivor who farmed me, The survivor sent me some lovely messages which is how i can follow up my xbox report with a formal one, Thanks a bunch!
---
Any constructive criticism instead of just criticism?
---
the first step is focusing on loops and structures
---
I've barely reached level 40, don't have the attention span to pay more than 2 games in a row and wanna reach 70. Entity help me I'm NEVER gonna reach the top. I can't even blind the killer carrying a survivor
---
Yes but i dont think they are “lore wise”. I am unsure here though.
---
Do you know when?
---
Me at tier 23 because college
---
I guarantee those same people would do way worse than  you with clown or probably any killer. The cocky survivors are always the ones who have never played killer before so they aren't used to the challenge.
---
I'm still at like 47 and I've almost done the quests, halp?
---
At least it is used correctly here
---
People like you are the reason I blocked every message from anyone except friends
---
Why bother msging to just harass? Are you that butthurt? Just move on instead of acting like a kid
---
You're also the reason why survivors feels so entitled and jerky in this community. Just take the L and go next instead of bragging
---
I plan on teaching my brother when I get my console working again I’ll finnaly have someone to SWF with
---
Noooo don't hurt the birb! :&lt;

Is that racist /s

---
Hello you STINKY SURVIVOR.
---
Go do a gen ugly.
---
As if peta ever saved animals and didnt kill even more
---
Awaiting for an answer. Just chilling here
---
There are dozens of Doctor mains Dozens!
---
The Legion’s Iridescent Button addon increases his terror radius to affect the entire map. 
---
Alternatively, you can use The Shape’s Dead Rabbit addon, which increases the Terror radius by 25%(8 metres) in tier 3 of Evil Within
---
Lastly, there’s The Doctor’s Calm series of addons, which all increase your terror radius in Treatment Mode (Altough with the upcoming Doctor changes, this might change as The Doctor will not have 2 modes anymore).
---
Doctor with both Calm add-ons, in treatment mode, with Distressing, and in a chase with Monitor and Abuse has something like a 60 meter terror radius which is more often than not more than half the map.
---
Although that is not right, at least they admit that they didn’t want to pip. Trust me on this, you could have encountered much worse than this. Swf is fun if you play like a normal human beings, but unfortunately majority of the high rank swf are cancerous.
---
Hangnail. Can be skin but tends to be a sliver of your fingernail. That's why they are hard to pull, hurt like hell, and bleed. You are pulling out your fingernails ripping out a hangnail.
---
Take a knife and chisel it off instead using your fingernail as a cuttingbroad. Place the edge on it and just press in, dont slice just press. Should either pop right off or be cut enough to break off without pain nor blood.
---
Wait really?
---
Somehow more toxic then True
---
Why did he feel the need to let u know he has a lvl 50 Oni with those perks? So does every other player
---
Dude don't give up for those assholes
---
Think about your plays. Everytime you do something during chase try to think: what have I done wrong? Was it the right play? Should've done this or that instead? And so on
---
Think of survivors as bots and you just have to outplay them in a way or another. Thinking like that, like you're trying to beat an AI like in dark souls for example, would keep you out of tilting
---
Clown is very weak but as long as you have fun and criticize yourself in a healthy way, you can succeed! I'm doing the same with Nurse on console. She's hard and I lose almost every game but IDC since Everytime I understand a little bit more about her
---
It's like a fighting game. You won't make a full 10hit combo in the first try but practicing even with the worse character you can succeed if you spend enough time. Especially if you use an underrated character you have the advantage of surprise when you become good at it
---
Don't give them the satisfaction of putting you down, ok?

First of all. Do you have Kate? A good perk to start is "windows of opportunity" a teachable perk from Kate. It shows every vault and pallet around you, it will help you understand where they usually are
---
Second, look up some videos. There's a ton of videos explaining how to play certain jungle gyms and structures.
---
Look behind you regularly but do it when you're sure you're not gonna bump into a wall, it will take some practice
---
In small loops look at the killer the whole time. It needs practice but will help you to move accordingly to avoid them. Also use your ears too since some killers have really loud footsteps so you wont fall into mindgames as easily
---
Look it up for ussylis videos, he's a good survivor and showcased several videos explaining many mechanics.
---
Play killer more. Sound dumb but if you see how other survivors play to avoid you, you'll also learn how to do the same when you switch back to survivor and ofc the opposite is also true. Playing both sides gives you an edge compared to the ones who won't
---
Playing killer also will give you that kind of sixth sense of "what would I do" preventing you to lose a chase
---
Have fun and try to learn as much as you can. It will take time but you'll do it

Frank wasn't a retail worker it was Joey , get your lore right. Otherwise not to bad art 🎭.
---
Thank you Coole :D
---
Instant hard pass from me, nurse is no longer enjoyable and this is coming from an old nurse main.
---
This saga has so much bangers. Beltrami did a wonderful job on the ost, I especially enjoyed the Scream 4 one.
---
Farming is not bannable but teaming with the killer to ruin the other survivors games is
---
Nice man,  congrats! I got my rank 1 for the first time yesterday in solo queue too
---
I've never spent that much time on a drawing before, it's exhausting honestly. I think I'll stick to drawings without color
---
Honestly my killer queues are instant and ppl spam flashlight macros at me that make all the noise in the world without consuming almost any battery at all.
---
  Brown flashlight sounds like a nice item for people who wanna practice being baby toxics without a flashlight macro and I mean sure whatever let em have it I guess lol
---
There's always one on the basement. No need to hide it. Nowhere down there can be hidden especially when lit
---
And now it's the most fair not often used perk? One person having DS now makes all killers in my game dread picking anyone up that was previously imjured (they think that people that don't heal are cocky due to DS), most of the time they even slug a non-DS user. DS right now is at it's peak power.
---
Yeah they're called avians.
---
Don't ask me how I know that.
---
Difference is one has at least SOME skill and experience and the other is a noobie
---
Good job :D
---
You gotta remember though, survivors can’t see the killer rank b4 a match so they are just gonna assume it’s their rank and will play normally
---
I don't normally like your posts, but yeah here I'm in agreement you should always just escalate to the level of shitlord that you're playing against.
---
  People who quit playing killer because they didnt have the fun time they were hoping for are probably not the people who should be playing the role in the first place.
---
Please. Ingore all these people. Its hag, hag. And then hag first.
---
If bbq and chilli is the best bp farming perk, ruin is the tied for best bp farming perk and is just the best perk in the game
---
Its so much farming that youll actually have set ups for the killers you do have.
---
I am red rank, not getting a single heal and doing  a quarter gen is not enough to safety pip.
---
Yeah I thought so tbh :c I'll try to change the shading so he'll look a bit less skinny. Gotta do justice to his muscles!
---
But the game is meant to be played at rank 25.
---
&gt;I wanna find my main killer...I just dont know which one I should go with. (I dnt like Billy so no to him)
---
Probably Huntress. Almost every add-on has some use.
---
Lmao I feel your pain. that achievement was bloody painful
---
wait there's no way to complete the rift pass just by completing all the challenges?you HAVE to buy levels in order to get all rewards?
---
Your wish is my command. [Crows](https://www.otakuusamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crow-1024x512.jpg) are the new killer.
---
I've only got 92 hours and I'm at 70. Sorry, you aren't entitled to the final rewards.
---
Personally I use up the good bloodpoint offerings on the character (escape cake, survivor pudding and 100% bonus’) also whilst doing so you may as well use up the best items you have, bring nice medkits or whatever you like to use, maybe drop them for a team mate at the end of the trial if you aren’t being chased out the gate. I like to have close to a million points when I’m prestiging, but that’s personal preference, I just like to be able to get the character back up to a reasonable level and perhaps get perks I could use..
---
This is why you make a personal list and pick Ghostface the next time you see them.
---
  
---
Hook them in your trial and then alternate between dragging your digital nutsack over their face with some occasional smatterings of mori cancel until the bleedout timer is stretched beyond it's limits and you're forced to mori them.
---
  If you're gonna take something personally, might as well make it personal right?
---
I’ll do as I please until somebody shoots me in the head for it
---
Is that ruin? Psht
---
Dude, I hope you had fun writing that because I didn't read it. That's how things go when you insult someone right off the bat. Protip: you don't get to have a conversation with them after that. I'll put you on block for good measure.
---
This should be a skin
---
&gt; carried by your perks
---
What does this even mean? You’re supposed to use perks to your advantage and change your play style
---
From what I’ve gathered, it’s because of how hard it is to see her sometimes, and the fact there’s a stereotype that they’re too busy being immersed to do gens and instead just stealth around.
---
People can be toxic as hell about them though. I was playing with a friend last night, and he was doing his spine chill challenge, while playing Claudette. Cue him getting close to the end, and his one remaining teammate sells him out, blocks the window so he couldn’t escape the killer after, and the post game chat being filled with the chants of the survivor and killer saying “death to Blendettes” over and over again. Really fucking scummy.
---
The amount of times I've seen these bastards at the corner of my eye and thought it was Ghostface is too damn high.
---
Are you solo?
---
So Scarlet Envy's quote is not from her?
---
Ok. I’ll use all my survivor puddings and see how far I get, I’ll probably have a lot by then, and I’ll prestige then.
---
I see. Truly a good work of game design.
---
PSA: You can complete this challenge by self-healing, even with Inner Strength. 
---
I completed mine in 3 matches.
---
damn did the nerf hurt that bad? I have heard the same from a few other people that used to main her pretty much
---
Yes this is so true. I've tried at high ranks to go for adapt and that is pretty much impossible. Especially the Gatekeeper emblem when you can't even run ruin or pgtw.
---
Awe, he looks like a baby killer whale.
---
(Makes sense now that I think about it, #KillerWhale4DBD)
---
“Your vibe, let me check it.”

---
This is the best thing I've ever seen
---
Nea on a Pier. I'm from the UK so it sounds right to me 😂
---
I wish other killers would stop rewarding RNG
---
I lost a bunch a brain cells
---
You messaged him first, what the fuck did you expect to happen.
---
:)
---
This was truly beautiful
---
Don't even get me started on how some killers have an inherently harder time getting Merciless simply because of how their played. Plague for instance, most people don't cleanse leaving them permanently injured. This means she gets less hits overall hurting her Malicious score. She also gets less chase points since her chases are really short because people are always injured. Same case with Billy since he 1 shots people with his chainsaw. 
---
Then you include the fact that some killers 3 perks are just utter dogshit. Wraith's perks are all bad except Shadowborn. Huntress's are also bad. Freddy &amp; Billy as well. It's just such a pain in the ass when you're forced to play in a particular way just to maximize stupid ass emblem points with the hope that the Entity will bless you with a Merciless.
---
I think it's more so entitlement. I don't expect a free walk from a kobe, but I do appreciate it.
---
I laughed in my mind
---
Okay but these perks were only worthless because you sucked. 
---
"ThEy SaBotAgeD AlL HoOkS."
---
Cry me a river and use it to swim to another hook jesus.
---
Obvious context:
---
I was avoiding tunnelling by chasing either the person involved in the rescue or someone nearby, not attacking the survivor I just hooked.
---
Accused of being racist just for targeting them. They expected me to let them finish all the generators and leave because of their colour?
---
Right now? The Demogorgon.
---
I hadn't played DBD since Legion came out and I've never watched a second of Stranger Things, but when I returned a few weeks ago I bought Demi out of mild interest and now I'm fucking hooked. Demi is so fucking scary with his loud footsteps, roaring, and fast-ass Shred, that it is waaaaay too satisfying. I'm powerleveling it now and I'm having a blast.
---
If you use a pair of nail clippers to cut it off the pain part is usually avoided.
---
I lost the ones I have left over lmao
---
Its literally in the perk description.
---
Ah, the toxicity of DBD.
---
Believe it or not I get a nice message from someone about once a year.
---
.... What super natural powers do Huntress and Trapper have?
---
... which is nothing no one ever denied... As i said, and i will gladly repeat it - since you all ignore it. Op could pull out that stunt because his perks which gave him the time needed to unhook. No one is calling it bullshit simply because OP haven't been hooked all game - which allowed him to do it.
---
**And seriously, people on this site need to stop taking everything as an insult. Just because someone says "carried by perks" doesn't mean it was a bad play. Even killers can be carried by perks by using NOED...**
---
This is why you always have your shoelaces tied
---
I'm clueless, the sub Reddit is a joke right? Like no one actually believes that stuff?
---
Im cool with letting deaf people play the game then balancing around that.
---
It seems fine, mechanically no difference to the actual game. This isnt a hearing test.
---
You probably actully had effort in that a Freddy just gave me it
---
Good job
---
None, but I did said:
---
"Extra supernatural power OR secondary weapon"
---
You know... The secondary weapon part. That's where she is. Same goes for Trapper by the way.
---
Huntress, Trapper, Billy, Myers, Ghostface and clown are all regular, very strong people with no actual magic to speak of.
---
Well duh, people know this is only possible because of Deliverance and DS. It’s a good combo as shown here. It’s pointless to say “you were carried by a perk” when they’re simply... using it. Are you gonna say someone is “carried” by unbreakable when they pick themself up? 
---
It’s not insulting, it’s just redundant. 
---
Also, being “carried” implies the player themself is bad in general.
---
Plus aren't the legion technically supernatural? They can dead lift people off the ground with one hand and when they hit some one with feral they can sense where other people are
---
Happens to me alot 4 times at once even
---
Yeah, the game certainly has humiliation/bully elements and the devs themselves have said this game is meant to be frustrating at times.
---
Then they still escspe
---
Did you teach yourself or do you have any tutorials you could recommend??
---
I feel you happens to me every game
---
What? I don't even know who TF are you. I don't look at people names, I remember two names in total, and none of em are you
---
Welp, i imagine you'll are really dishonest, thank you proving me right
---
no it was because you didn't have baby survivors
---
I think the Demogorgon could be an Animal Version of the Hunter
---
PETA wants to know your location
---
Yeah but this shows me that something has to be wrong with these people. Which normal person would tell someone to kill themself because of a game?
---
I’d rather not break my joystick though
---
Great survivor moment without using second chance perks are rare like unicorns. take upvote
---
It hates everyone.  Low ranks get stomped by high ranks.  Not sure if high ranks care about bullying low rank killers.
---
If you go the cheapest route it will get to about level 40. Around level 33-35 if you go for good stuff.
---
DS has been through enough already. There is better perks to focus on like "No mither" that has quite few complains.
---
Yeah the matchmaking sometimes is very bad. But don't give up on the game because of it.
---
What
---
And that’s why games are lost
---
&gt;So is being mori'd and camped then
---
Comparing apples to oranges. Moris are uncounterable bullshit in need of a rework and camping is just  a lazy &amp; boring tactic.
---
\&gt; You just admitted you use them in attempts to get an emotional reaction for benefit
---
No i didn't, don't put words in my mouth. Nothing to "admit" anyway, i don't see what's the big deal. You're playing a pvp game. A pvp game that happens to revolve around a cat &amp; mouse scenario where sometimes the mice can have the upper hand. I wish i could find one great post about the psychology of the game that someone wrote on this sub... This game definitely has bully/humiliation elements (the devs themselves have said this game is meant to be frustrating at times, why do you think they don't directly address so-called toxic non-bannable behaviour?) but if you can't take a little non-harmful banter (that actually just benefits you as a killer) in a pvp game, i think you shouldn't be playing online games.
---
Yes i'm sure there's plenty of people who capitalize on the bully elements of the game and seek to have their entertainment fulfilled via BMing the other side. Personally? If i see that a survivor could benefit from me taking the aggro (they're getting tunneled for example or are not a good ), i'll try to get the killer's attention. I won't BM unless the killer is being exceptionally unfun to vs.
---
Eric Draven is not going to like that.
---
It doesn’t. The rank reset system just got changed so players rank doesn’t go down as much as it did before, combined with there not being many low ranked players the game has to ignore the rules in order to find you a game.
---
It's actually quite fun..you land it hit, then survivors often get caught out. Survivors often don't drop pallets and such cuz let's face it, who does pallet loop Vs a nurse right? 
---
..then she catches you with 4.6ms speed. Also very easy to check ds timer with this :D
---
Had to pull out a toxic Nea outfit, flashlight, OoO, etc just to get a killer to chase me enough for 4 pallet stuns.
---
Why does this look like depression propaganda.
---
Yeah, but people are always pissed. Lol
---
See I wouldn’t even have figured out you were trying to do a challenge. I would have seen that username and thought you were just trying to get me to chase you to distract me from your teammates doing gens and would refuse to let it work.
---
I honestly forget the Tome Challenges are even a thing some times
---
Solo survivor queue is kinda depression itself
---
How are you supposed to know if killer is bad or low rank as survivor? Like yea sometimes maybe but not all the time. Sometimes i think killer play first time certain killer so he just dont understand his power, than expecting to get a low rank killer, i pity killer after match and often says sorry to them and give them tips how to improve.
---
People aren’t pissed when they win or have the upper hand lol. It’s a fine balance between letting survivors win and the killer win
---
The times when instead of going to menu screen we could just click one button and save 2 seconds of our time
---
I did this with my swf, and put all shiny coins on. I got 11/12 chests in the round I needed and it felt good.
---
yesterday, i had a killer hook me, and then pick up my last teammate. instead of hooking teammate, he sat him down in front of me, and just stared at me on the hook, waiting for us to bleed out
---
I got the 4%. 
---
and he immediately stabbed me, and hooked me again
---
Not bad you killed two people and with Hag 👍🏻
---
go play civ 4 for a month then come back
---
i won't! i've played it a bit on ps4, so i'm not super new. i was just surprised that i got placed against people that much higher than me lmao

---
Bro you already know he's gonna get bored in about 2 weeks and we won't hear from him for a month or two again
---
I mean it legit takes nothing to pip in this game just a matter of play time
---
it is stupid when I just wanna play a normal game of DBD but I can't kill myself on hook bc my dumbass teammate is there to unhook me 0.1 seconds after I got hooked and then the killer won't fucking hook me to kill me I JUST WANT OUT
---
Wrong again haha, I've had this thing since a year after the official release. Trust me though, my ps4 has it's bad days too. It's not uncommon for DBD to run at 15fps sometimes.
---
Be nice sometimes why dontchya?
---
When his rework eventually comes out, he’s confirmed to be getting his own chase music.
---
Yeah. You power through the ruin and keep eyes open while switching gens to cleanse it.
---
If one surv is chased and two look for the ruin, you are going to lose.
---
What survivor do you play when you do this?
---
Welcome to the 0.2% !
---
on pc one is space and the other is m1
---
Oh you fool. You sad fool
---
What’s your rank man? That’s not optimal for your teams performance in my opinion... you might want to find some better strategies to help your team out more...
---
Can u do a denogorogon one so I can put it as my wallpaper I really liked this one
---
Cutting 6,6 seconds from a gen is pretty decent and the vaulting speed with resilience and spine chill is insane
---
Knife on Dwight :b
---
shouldve big spun the killer on his shoulders, smh my head.
---
Run
---
Lol I'm a ghosty boi
---
Well dead hard was completely counterable in this situation and he hadn’t used ds or deliverance until egc meaning he only had dead hard the entire game. So technically he was a pretty easy target
---
Clown: Mine should be like du- *coughs* du- *coughs* Y'all know how it goes...
---
A lot of killers who didn't want to kill got tortured by the Entity so that they would have to, which is why killers like Doctor and Trapper look the way they do. Sad :(
---
PIG IN A FIG?
---
&gt; Must mean I'm a bad player and deserve a depip because fuck me I guess.
---
The game doesn't rank you up cause the survivors were too potato for you to rank up.
---
Yeah, missing skill checks would be too OP at the low ranks.
---
I think you can buy ranks on eBay or some shit
---
First of all, there wasn't a need to initiate the convo with "tunneling = no kills", you could have phrased it better, something like "gg, unfortunate about the loss"
---
Second, blur out names man, its in the subreddit rules.
---
Doctor's shock attack doesn't extend directly from the model, rather it starts like 2 metres infront of him, so he has a small blind spot.
---
Tell me about it! That was a lightning speed grab, meanwhile every other gen/pallet grab is like \*doouuueee, lets smack that gen/pallet, it insulted my mother\*
---
Nah, Pig in a wig on a fig . . .
---
I'm tired :( I can't think at the moment
---
They're more relying on alliteration than normal rhyming. So no, it's not too smart for you.
---
Ikr!, Dedicated servers are making my weapon not hit when it looks like it hits but hit when it doesn't?

Trust me, keys have been complained about for much longer than just recently, I know I've hated them as Killer since Legion came out (I started playing just before spirit)
---
I started playing in October 2018, what was that tab under the bloodweb?
---
it was where the shrine was before it got moved to the store!!
---
One of the worst killers ever on a fig? /s 😜
---
he is in the clowns little  trailer drinking
---
*Happy oink noises*
---
I can hear Tom say "let me have it!" In my head
---
I'd have to disagree. Whenever I'm playing I'm in a 4 man swf.
---
Someone always hunts for ruin whilst others run distraction / work gens
---
It means the same thing but I suppose it sounds more impactful to say dashed rather than bashed.
---
I said no with you my man.
---
*stabs in agreement*
---
For fun.  I started it because of all the different killer combinations for their outfits.  Some are really cool
---
well, rather after the holiday then in the holiday when most people are to busy with family stuff :p
---
New spirit buff u didnt know u needed

It's literally the only thing that allows you to communicate with teammates via audio in solo queue.

I like it. It makes sense ans looks cool
---
You got a devotion level. Every 100 levels you get a devotion level and reset back to 0
---
It's so true
---
1. Killer goes to farm, finds you - you refuse and he hooks you. You may be rescued before suicide just like in any normal game.
---
2. Killer plays normal, finds you - hooks you. You may be rescued just like in any normal game.
---
Point is if the killer finds you and you can't escape it really doesn't matter what his agenda is.

What did he say

Bro I like ur crow memes 😀😀😁😁👍👍👍 crow swag

NOED
---
No problem I just love hard working peoples well work
---
I think that means you’re just better at killer than you are at survivor
---
She got gutted pretty hard. Her addons needed to be tweaked to balance out her total power that much was pretty much undeniable. The issue is how they went about doing it, they said they were changing her addons, what they ACTUALLY did was gut every single addon she had and made them ALL actively hurt her for using them. 
---
In addition, they nerfed her base power despite the significant penalties it already incurred for using it. Now in addition to constantly being the slowest killer in the game, having a fatigue state that obstructs your vision and slows you down EVEN more all while preventing you from interacting with anything every time you use your power. It now has a 3-second blink recharge timer before you blinks recharge.
---
What this effectively does is punish the nurse twice for existing. First it forces you to use your power to traverse the map, then it punishes you for doing that by preventing you from blinking again for a minimum of 3 seconds while you wait for it to recharge. This charge severely limits her mobility and makes missing a single blink EXTREMELY punishing.
---
So yea all the skill you spent developing to get-gud at the nurse is effectively bottle-capped by an artificial cool-down timer. The skill -&gt; to the reward &lt;-- just isn't there anymore. People liked old nurse because she was one of the few killers where you had absolute agency in how a chase went. It was all based upon your skill as killer. Sadly that just isn't the way it works anymore and playing her just feels clunky and depressing.
---
You could just play more
---
That sounds strategic wouldn't absence of Ruin hurt a bit
---
Id rather know where the killer is all the time than have a ghostface or michael sneak up and expose my ass
---
Poor guy
---
People say Shrek 3 was bad, but I have a soft spot for it.
---
I feel like squidward should be the killer as patrick doesnt have the brain cells to kill someone and he seems innocent and squidward seems like the type of character to just snap. But anyway, good idea
---
you better have gotten a +rep for that.
---
I have to disagree with you.
---
I personally believe that pipping is pretty damn easy, if you know what you are doing.
---
As someone told you already, once you max out in a particular category *(let's say objective)*, anything else you continue doing on that same area is just a waste. 
---
In order to pip, you need to perform a little bit of each category. This means, safe unhooks, healing, doing generators and evading the killer.
---
I oftently do 1.5 or 2 gens by myself, unhook one or two teammates *(and heal them, of course)* and is barely enough to pip at purple ranks, even though I suck at evading the killer.
---
Because 4 people need to pip, there are more than enough resources for all of them to share.
---
So yeah, you only need one or two of every objective and you'll pip.
---
I got 4 moris in a single match once as Pig
---
I didn't have it selected
---
I'm visiting grandparents for 2 weeks. I'm grinding my ass off and maybe throwing money at the pass when I get back. I didn't even finish rift 3.
---
How have you used it in such way. Not how can you. How have you, specifically you, used a flashlight to communicate with a survivor.
---
Yes there are. And the crossover level implied that both games are happening at the same time
---
Hopefully those trends will die down, a lot of the archive challenges practically demand that you do so
---
I friended a guy after we played over 20 matches together and he asked me "why the f*** did u friend me?!" And im like :/
---
I honestly dont get how you dont see Toxic actions as an attempt at bullying unless you yourself are a toxic player.
---
I mean cool I guess all I see is the killer getting outperked. Ds really is a stupid perk, but it's fine he just needs to not tunnel literally the only survivor in the trial , poor trapper literally has 0 counter-play.
---
I have clicked at teammates to get their attention for heals, or to get them to follow me. I have done this alot actually. If you're teammate isn't looking, but you need their attention, audio is the best way to do that
---
He knew too. Lol. The hesitation before he picked you up

I just kept quiet, as stated before people will screw you over for spite if they know. Put on Plunderers instinct and just Bee-lined for them then did gens after if the game still was progressing. Got it done in three games thankfully.
---
Goddamnit Nea, I told you those shoes were too big...
---
It still gives vaulting speed. It even gives you "Attempt Escape" speed on hooks.
---
I just let a SWF farm their asses off until they were max points and asked if they would all die in basement. :) first game success
---
It might possibly be because he's trying to do his basement challenge. I know a lot of survivors like to DC to deny the killer of his challenge.
---
You have a point, but I have a specific vendetta with people who keep vaulting the same loop the whole game.
---
It's like the birthday for your Reddit account.
---
Frank gang, where you at?
---
Well you’re giving killers who would camp or use insidious an easy way to get kills. These type of killers will lose because they’ll have fuck all chaser and sacrifice
---
What about Micheal?
---
Meanwhile the 8 year olds on switch try to friend me before our first round without question.
---
*Activates Feral Frenzy*
---
r/Stabbygang
---
Do some research and you’ll get what I mean (;
---
Meh, depends on your playstyle. Like yeah, Calm and Order is a pretty standard Doctor add-on combination, but double Calm allows you to play Dr. Silent which is pretty damn funny since people don't really expect a Doctor to sneak up to them.
---
*(Specially with Monitor and Abuse)*
---
I am pretty sure that he wasn't trying to do it. Almost all of us died near the basement. He didn't hook anyone there once (well everyone dced but it still didn't look like it). But god, its so scummy to just make it harder for the killer to do their challenge.
---
 Woah hold up, you don’t have all the power. You should have it most of the time but it’s only a small percentage. Depends on perks, killer, add ons, map and survivors. That’s why it feels so defeating, even if you have no chance you’re made to feel like you have power
---
What rank killer are you?
---
At least you'll be less dumb in the future.
---
Post it to r/Stabbygang too 🔪
---
I've had people do this before.
---
Sometimes I feel like I should say "Congratulations, you've successfully been a dick for no reason and also got worse items out of it. I hope you're happy." just to see how they react.
---
It doesn't matter if you tell them that you're running a build around looting chests, it doesn't matter if you tell them that after you've gone through the chests they can take any items left behind, it doesn't matter if you clearly tell them not to search chests, some people will do it anyway just in spite of you.
---
each killer should have their own ranks. I do decently good with Michael but if I try Nurse, hell no, rofl. I think even rank 20s would all escape
---
Post it to r/Stabbygang too🔪
---
That's ignorant.
---
Such a passive aggressive reply. Why?
---
Obviously i can only speak for myself here. Although the devs do seem to agree with my viewpoint seeing as there's not much done to stop the so called toxic behaviour (such as tbagging, flashlight clicking, tunneling or camping).
---
&gt; The game doesnt run on your rules alone either
---
I'm not setting or making any rules here am i? 
---
&gt; General consensus says its toxic, then its toxic.
---
Argumentum ad populum...
---
I mean a quick google search could've answered your question but yeah being downvoted for a question is pretty childish tbh
---
She still has good addons
---
What does it take away from it?
---
PlayStation has an events thing too it doesn’t work like that
---
I meant that you hold all of the power that your side is given, therefore bearing all of the responsibility. Not that you control absolutely everything.
---
Just use stake out.
---
Or don't there are more useful perks out there.
---
Killers checking lockers might be more accurate
---
Interesting. I'm in the same region and I haven't run into that much at all. A few weeks ago I was intermittently teleporting around the map due to lag as both survivor and killer, but I haven't had it happen for a while now.
---
It’s basically that ‘doggo speak’, trying to be all cutesy and is just really really cringe imo.
---
They're like the birds from Fallout 4, they're spies for The Institute like these are spies for The Entity.
---
Probably a rank 20.
---
Attack on Titan?
---
Wait is the new season out?
---
My brain was in another planet this morning.
---
It’s a small price to pay for salvation
---
Indeed
---
Do you still have the cosmetics that were given out (like Billy's pro-pain hammer) or did you even lose those?
---
Sometimes they can be bugged. Like depleting health kits will count if another survivor depletes one you interacted with etc
---
&gt; Pretty much sums up how unbalanced the perks are atm. 
---
It's called losing the game. He had the entire game to kill people and he couldn't. This is not unabalanced, it's losing the game. He camped trying to get at least one kill and the perks Jane had worked: DS for the tunneling, DH for the second chance and Deliverance for the self unhook.
---
Killer's fault not survivor's.
---
ur really cringe bruh so cringe xD
---
Because, splinters..
---
Only thing that fucks with nurse now is dedicated servers. idk if this still is a problem but killer shack has like a box around it that u can't tp to just through.
---
her add-ons are shit and before they where broken OP I am fine without addons
---
Everytime
---
But you took the time to make it black?
---
DS and Deliverance both still up during the end-game collapse, talk about the stars aligning!
---
Very well played too of course :)
---
***ZAP***
---
Yes but the hexes could be tuned for balance.
---
Vommy Mommy gives you stinkies
---
No I just screen shotted it from a video and cropped the bottom out
---
By the end of the time we will probably have every single pants and shirts he was wearing in all 3 seasons. Calm down finally
---
And not the top at all?
---
Nope
---
Welcome bij dbd where the first 12 hours as killer will be a nightmare ( not the killer) just bite though it after the 12 hours you have same skilled survivors and it will all be fun (70-90% of the time )
---
Happy cake day
---
Imo they should just remove the ranking system anyone who thinks this game is competitive is harshly mistaken.
---
Ranking system should just be an evolving badge or something like that to give you an idea of how long someone has played. Having almost nothing to do with rank.
---
Its okay to lose to people who have more time on the game as you. Thats how you get better.
---
Thank you, I was planning to post in on that very day.
---
And my oh my, happy cake day to you as well!
---
Didnt say they were OP. I by far have more hours playing as a survivor. But if you cant see how tilted games are in survivors favor you're probably just a pretty shitty survivor tbh.
---
it's actually pretty confusing, people don't realize that with the right perks and add-ons he can have the smallest TR of any killer, not counting stealth killers that just remove theirs. I'm pretty sure it was the intention with his own perk M&amp;A as well.
---
a 12m TR is pretty easy to sneak up on people with.
---
no problem, hope u have fun with the stabby gang :)
---
"gEt gud, EZ, baby Killer"

I didn't say she was wraith tier I said she feels clunky as shit for no good fucking reason.

Dream Demon On Italian Food
---
Name 1 , ill wait.
---
I did it for 4 hours went to bed woke up then did it in my first game
---
They were really nice and non toxic, just really better then i was :)
---
I know that's her mouth, but I rather keep believing that Claudette has a white moustache.
---
The Nightmare on meatball?
---
All killers are supposed to have addons that either change the way they play in an interesting way or increase they're base power in strength. NEITHER of the categories are met with nurse's addons , they're shit and need a " RE-REWORK" . And yea collsion bugs are still plentiful with her as is the blade wipe into fatuige bug because nobody ever complains about it if it hurts the nurse.
---
That explains it
---
Thanks!
---
I played peekaboo with Billy. :) It's the little things.
---
Such an awesome drawing, I love your style 😍
---
Sorry, you said it was ‘survivor sided’ and said a perk was op. I mostly play killer anyway so stop bitching about it and git gud
---
ikr?, also are those same tryhards that make the game toxic with their "if i derank i die" mentality
---
“hard rank difference of 6”
---
No one has a problem with BBQ other than you, don’t need to get all snappy because you proposed a crap idea. If you don’t like it you don’t need to use it.
---
I got the deluxe edition so I am 20
---
Legion because they would make my death slow
---
Wraith. Invisible, tall dude chasing me down is terrifying. It's the things we can't see we are most afraid of.
---
Read it again. "Or literally any killer apart from Ghostface and Myers"
---
Wait till people in destiny figure out this is the real traveler...
---
Bruh moment. I've reached Galaxy brain status
---
It is survivor sided and adding that benefit to the perk would make it OP. Survivors don't need anymore benefits on their side, if you play killer at a halfway decent rank you would know that. It's an absolute cakewalk when I can run self care, dead hard, prove thyself, and decisive. Meanwhile half the killers need to run ultra rares to even have a chance against a competent group of survivors. That's not even factoring in bring map offerings, toolboxes and brand new parts.
---
What nobel did he won?
---
You saying he isn’t strong?
---
Non dbd killers but truly Samara (US) and Grudge (US).
---
Just the thought of all the bad killers using NOED without downside makes me wanna quit.
---
The great machine, Carl.
---
Don't worry, you must be like... The 4th guy to say something similar because they didn't read correctly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
From what I remember:
---
"What supernatural power does Trapper and Huntress posess ?"
---
"Trapper, Huntress, Bubba and Hillbilly are all normal human without any power" (something among those lines)
---
"Pig ?" (and then he answer himself this: "Nevermind I'm dumb" or something like that)
---
Just make it a perk. That lights a totem. Its technically not even a totem til the end game.
---
I think the worst would be Freddy, Clown and Doctor.
---
They are the most wicked ones, I can totally see them taking their time to make you suffer as much as they can.
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes. That Plague has no one to blame but themselves for losing that kill.
---
Yo... Your art is incredble mate!
---
Keep it goin', I love it!!!
---
thanks!
---
That’s for landing right next to me and then flying away like a little bitch
---
Run Plunderer’s Instinct, set on a coin, and just make a mad dash to all of the chests when their aura pops up at the beginning of the match.
---
Just equip STBFL and try to make the match go out for a while
---
when you come from friday the 13th and try to place them next to gens like you used next to cars and such.
---
It's toxic and you don't realize it because you're toxic
---
None if this works if they're running from you and looking forward, but good try.
---
Fourth season coming soon. Potential cosmetic hunting
---
trapper is hard to use, especially for the beginner. Try hillbilly or doctor.
---
Considering your post and your responses to other people I can’t tell if this is all bait or you’re just really dumb
---
You can remove flashlight clicking and make crouching more than once not instantly make you go down (first crouch and up is instant everyone after that with in 1 second is slowed down), and a more decent tutorial that explains you get more points for hooking multiple times and have better chances at winning if you leave hooks.
---
Bam now killers know camping and tunneling is inefficient and toxic, and now you cant spam click or Teabag.
---
Few people would mind if you took out the existing ranking system.
---
What this game needs is a (virwable or hidden) ELO like system: depending on how you do versus diffetently skilled survivors or killers, that's how you are matched.
---
Or even with the system they have, they could at least co sider player level / devotion.
---
Any multiplayer game, competitive or not, that pretty consistently matches you unfairly just creates a lot of unnecessary frustration.
---
I'd also bet that is why DbD is just not gaining a lot of new players. 
---
The game is already hard to learn in and by itself, but if you then get matched 10 times in a row against people you cannot possibly do well against, you might just give up.
---
I still remember vividly how it took me 40-50 hours as killer to rank up enough to finally play against similarly skilled survivors. Some of the games I had at level 18 were harder than games at purple rank
---
If they are running it's probably for a good reason, but good try.
---
5 perks against 16. I don't think it would be that bad.
---
Hehe
---
The devs said the matchmaking system has bugs right now where it doesn’t work as intended every round. Sorry this happened. Hopefully you can get in correct matches and don’t give up on the game.
---
Nazi hentai?
---
I'm sickened, but curious
---
It depends.
---
Sometimes gens wont get done or even touched until Ruin is gone. Most notably if you’re put with green ranks.
---
Legion would be least scary its teenagers with knives
---
I think cannibal or oni
---
i’m still trying to think of what they’re power could be
---
I did get really lucky that she decided to vomit instead of genuinely camp/guard the hook better. Not to mention if she didn’t hit me, I would have died to the entity. But thanks to the speed boost after being hit, I was able to make it!
---
Cannibal or Myers definitely
---
Each time a survivor teabags, you get a charge. Each charge you can sprint at said survivor leaping windows smashing pallets and lockers in your way when you reach a survivor you beat the shit out of them for 30 seconds. During this time all gens will be regressing and the hatch is forever locked.
---
I always tought about a Gouki kind of killer, where you actually have to input commands for it to make different moves.
---
This is season 2
---
i dont know sounds too balanced. maybe if you buffed it a bit
---
Bro did the same thing
---
Her legs look fucked
---
A Killer that has grabs would be fun as fuck. Imagine being on a survivor‘s ass, but instead of m1ing you grab them Tombstone Myers style and just throw them the fuck away from the loop they wanted to run to and now they‘re not just injured but way out of position depending on where you throw them.
---
I got my Trapper and Wraith to P3 50. I am on my way to having every killer max level, already at 4 so far.
---
Corrupt is a better ruin for Hag and running both is a mistake
---
I wouldn't say soon, it hasn't even started filming yet. It won't come out until Spring 2021 most likely.
---
K boomer
---
I don't know why, but any comics with Legion acting like hooligans towards the other killers or the survivors are so enjoyable.
---
Imagine being caught by a Doctor
---
Brought to you by the Calm Spirit gang
---
True how about all buildings and junglegyms and killer shack be flattened to the ground. The map becomes a colliseum and no one escapes the Gladiator. If someone DCs you can summon tigers on the other survivors that mori them for 1 minute. The survivor that doesnt teabag though instantly gets full points and escapes.
---
You 2 days ago:

The Cypress is the only Mori offering I don’t actually mind.

Then the survivor gets saved with bt and the killer dc's as all the survivors are leaving
---
*I don’t even know anymore, man*
---
Oh I fucking l o v e it
---
Four times in a row? Those are rookie numbers, you need to get those up.
---
Ya I’ve done it as hillbilly plenty of times and just cut chases lol
---
So was there no requirement of being recently unhooked? And could it be used more than once in a trial?
---
Do you think he gets Witch flashbacks when he sees spirit?
---
You're a real man
---
But you haven't had a change in opinion. You're still here trying to shame killers because survivors should be able to use perks and addons as they want, and you've yet to ever post about killers having the same right.
---
So yeah, you haven't changed a goddamned thing. You're still an entitled fucking hypocrite. Hilarious that you try to project that onto me though. All I've done is call you out with your own posts as proof.
---
Your actions speak louder than your words. You're nothing more than a hypocritical, entitled survivor-biased asshole.
---
So, I'm sorry that killers use perks and items and tactics the developers put in the game in a combination they were intended.
---
Now kindly go fuck yourself, ya hypocrite.
---
I mean, he loved this perk before
---
So do I have to wait for Jan 13th now or what?
---
How do I rank up if I can't find a game?
---
I hate this.
---
The game isnt doing well because of the ranking sytem.
---
My friends who dont play killer often at all. Would rather get a game than sit in the lobby for well over 10 minutes.
---
The amount of times in the past month ive heard "i wanna play killer but im just sitting here searching"
---
And then i tell them you have to play more to find matches.
---
And i know what they are thinking.
---
They would love to play more but when they can only get a match or two in an hour and a half they just get on something else.
---
Just an evolving badge that is shown in the lobby.
---
Forced hidden, forced ranks KILL games. This happened to gears. As the game ages People just want to play.
---
Let me explain cuz I know how this shit works already
---
Game looks for players 6 ranks around the first killer
---
It started with a rank 10 killer and got four rank 4 survivors in because they were in a queue for a long time
---
then the killer left and looked for a killer within 6 ranks from the previous killer, and got you, a rank 16
---
or they could balance gens so people wouldn't need Hex Ruin to make it more fair I feel like this would be a dumb work around for a simple problem but hey not like BHVR is known for that *cough nemesis and legion*
---
Wait? You mean entitled hypocrisy has an expiration date?
---
Nah, fucker. You said that shit, you keep saying that shit, you defend survivors here in this thread while blaming killers in other threads. Your made-up expiration date means as little to me as your made-up rules for killers.
---
I'm sorry that killers use perks and items and tactics the developers put in the game in a combination they were intended.
---
Good crow
---
Now *this* is shitposting.
---
Shoot, I really just want to see how it ends.
---
Meanwhile the entity: Keep firing Adiris, convert a heathen!
---
bc nobody likes Nurse she is fundamentally broken
---
Yeah, around that area for most killers. Some killers like hag are a bit of an odd exception though, iirc.
---
Most of the time it’s a bit harder to get it from further away at first due to the lack a reticule, but you can the gist of it eventually . Also try and note the beam getting smaller and adjust to keep that going. The smaller it’s gets, the closer you are to a successful blind
---
Generally you also want to avoid attempting blinds unless the killer is animation locked, so they can’t just turn away
---
Thank you! I’m gonna use this for my home screen.
---
Agreed but i actually think that would be a fun fix that involves more to do than just holding down a button. If a hex was always present it would change up the meta for survivor perks drastically and the multiplier would allow survivors to afford more items.
---
You're welcome!
---
i feel you
---
Fungoose
---
Mista was right
---
I love distressing and whispers on the spirit. Who needs some dumb prayer beads anyway.
---
On rank 5 and up
---
and you’re just another overzealous player who takes issue with people that want to play the game for fun and not get slashed and face camped to death on their first hook, calm down dude
---
This is magnificent truly
---
Yeah, anyone can play clown. He's probably the second easiest killer to understand besides leatherface. He's just really meh and boring.
---
most of the time I've played pig, I have gotten 4k's without trying, I understand how broken she is.
---
How do I rank up if I can't find a single game
---
Otz is a Spanish national treasure
---
I couldn’t play for two weeks. Some kinda of port issue. I switched to WiFi and I’m fine now.
---
"Bad Man's" Last Breath,Jenner's Last Breath,Anxious Gasp,Ataxic Respiration,Fragile Wheeze,Heavy Panting,Kavanagh's Last Breath,Dark Cincture,Pocket Watch.  2 of the range add ons have increased charge time of blinks, but can be recovered by another add on included. Other than that these add ons are all very good.
---
Damn that’s a classic
---
Imagine your Killer power being a paper cut.
---
Damn bruh you mad mad eh
---
No it doesn't tf
---
Dull Razors do this.
---
I do that for free
---
You should be able to complete any challenge that you have unlocked without having to select it. Manually having to go into the Archive and select a specific challenge every game is so tedious and such frustrating, poor design. At the very least we should be able to have two challenges active at once so you can swap between Killer and Survivor without needing to pick a new one. People are throwing games if they realize they can’t make a challenge - at least give them a chance to complete something else if they lose on another one.
---
Big talk for a sentient toilet paper.
---
As long as they nerf the power level of ruin, I’m fine with that.
---
Yup no requirement needed you can use it as soon as the killer picks you up the first time and no you could only use it once.
---
Pig is one of the "not so good" killers, but I find her decent enough. What me really hurts are the nerfs she got in the last months and nobody has asked for! I like to play her and these nerfs made an already not that good killer, a little bit more "not that good"
---
Yeah I'm trying to get better at blinds at pallets because they are very effective against me when I'm killer and flashlight saves because it is really hard for me atm. Cool that's great advice thanks
---
I'm well acquainted with shitty things. &gt;:D
---
I got lucky and had the last guy be nice enough to understand the struggle. Even sent him a thank you message for not dcing and he said he understood the struggle. 
---
This challenge definitely isn't hard, it's just toxic cunts and the fact dc's don't count are making it harder. In reality if this was a perfect system and nobody could dc then this challenge would-be be done in a couple games depending on the maps you get
---
Sadly I still got the hook 5 people one but I feel that will be drastically easier than this
---
I mean I would have just went back up and tried again.
---
To be honest I dont have problem with the rift I end it with 34 days left now I dont have a reason to play the game
---
Finally! I love this pack so much &lt;3
---
Damn that f*cked it’s good that they nerfed it or else playing as killer would just be a nightmare. What about mettle of man?
---
Is that a ghostface perk?
---
Why have I not known about this sub until now
---
Damn looks good. Wish I could draw like that lol
---
If you have bad Internet you shouldn't be playing a only online game anyway. Can't wait for this penalty system to go live
---
Matchmaking.
---
I'm a overzealous player that understands, and argues for, the fact that everyone gets to play how they want without anyone else dictating or shaming them for playing the game within the confines of the game mechanics and what BHVR says is and is not bannable. My issue isn't with people's complaints about how the game goes, but more in that they try to dictate or shame other players for playing how they want.
---
The fact that people seem to take offense to "No one gets to dictate how anyone else plays" is terrifyingly telling of just how entitled this community is.
---
It's not fun to get infinite looped and flashlighted and pallet stunned and gen-rushed, but I defend survivors just the same as I defend killers when I see threads. More threads complaining about killers, but it is what it is.
---
And yeah, it's not fun being tunneled or camped. But that's the game sometimes. Sometimes you get the gens done in 6 minutes, unhook the one hook the killer got, and everyone gets out. Sometimes the killer gets lucky and gets a 4xSlug in the first 40 seconds. Sometimes it's fun for you, sometimes it's fun for the killer, sometimes it's not fun for you, sometimes it's not fun for the killer. That's how versus games go - They tend to be zero-sum fun.
---
I hope people will be nice and kind and compassionate in game, particularly with the horrible matchmaking that's been happening. But if someone wants to keep their try-hard pants on, that's their choice.
---
As to calm, nah... Calm lets people like that think they're in the right. When they're never called out, they think everyone agrees with them. Calling out the hypocrites is what we should all be doing. The fact that you'd rather try and tell me to calm down instead of telling the entitled, hypocritical asshole not to be an entitled, hypocritical asshole is problematic, ain't it?
---
The most prominent reason being that walking is too slow, yes.
---
God damn this was actually so well made.
---
Good job OP. You got my Upvote!
---
Christ, there's a boomer around here!
---
It’s called quick texting u gimp. Surprisingly this isn’t essay writing
---
Nah this could've been pulled off with 4 strangers. Nothing here required verbal communication.
---
Unfortunate
---
I would’ve done the same too, it remind me of that rock in the one map that you can climb on top of.
---
Ghostface and Pig. I hate stealth killers in general since they often get bullshit 1st hits. And unless you're out in the open doing a gen with no LOS blockers there is no way to hear or see them coming unless you have trained your ears to pinpoint the distinct sound of their leather moving.
---
Edit: And Forever Freddy. Even after the nerf he's just a snoozefest to play against. I'm trying to play an action horror game, not go to sleep.
---
Smash an Ash?
---
Toxic community essentially, gen rushing isn’t a thing. The only thing you can blame the game for is having a main objective that’s so much more boring than everything else in the game.
---
To be fair, I also happen to land like that quite often...
---
&gt; You can remove flashlight clicking and make crouching more than once not instantly make you go down (first crouch and up is instant everyone after that with in 1 second is slowed down)
---
Just because someone's feelings got hurt by pixels on their screen? I'd rather see the devs work on actual issues within the game.
---
Anyway i'm done with this discussion. Nothing more to say to someone who actually thinks tbagging is such a glaring issue (or an issue in the first place) that the animation needs a cooldown tweak lmao. Thanks for the laughs! That suggestion is something else...
---
which build are you using?
---
Fairfield in a Field? Come on thats cheating using the same word to rhyme
---
It's not a problem of it being the same as he does now.
---
The problem is that Trapper has the best traps in the game and just giving him the full amount right off the bat is going to make him stupid as hell to go up against. If you limit him down to 3, he still can shut down some great loops right off the bat, but at least an entire side of the map isn't covered in traps 15 seconds into the trial.
---
Mine is usually filled with a mix of: GG, Trashcan, Tunneler, &amp; Camper.
---
Recent? People been camping since release
---
I find that hard to believe, I play both survivor and killer and regardless of how I play, I am branded a toxic killer or toxic survivor. Everyone's just petty and need to grow up imo
---
 i had the same glitch today
---
now that I think about it, the clown is a combination of the smoker (because the cough) and the boomer but the boomer i mostly the plague 'cause they have the exact same power.
---
Thats how good players get better. Roll the dice play the next match. Gears got killee because the good players have been playing for years. New people literally never found a ranked game. 
---
Its just the reality of the situation balancing your game around new players is ridiculous
---
I’m watching stranger things right now and this is a meme
---
You know how the karma whore works right? If you post something and it's not successful. You wait 2-3 days and post again. Most people's attention's spans are too short to notice or care
---
Good survivors hit hex skill checks anyway
---
I've been messing around with the Nurse lately and I whole heartedly agree. I feel like it's a mistake how the specifics are applied, the blindness has always been a terrible mechanic (I can't be the only one who gets nausea from it), being rooted on the spot while blinded and the subsequent teleport distances tied with the window of opportunity based on how much charge has gathered seems odd. 
---
I don't know if it's just me, but the best defense against the nurse seems to be, just run far away and she can't catch up to you? So the nurse is caught in a neverending chase because she's too slow to chase, but keeps needing to charge to teleport and then gets stunned when she actually uses her powers, allowing survivors to just keep running!
---
When the baby dwight cleanses the plague.
---
Spirit. Every single Spirit I go against always proxy camps JUUUST enough so that their terror radius goes away so that when you get unhooked they can quickly phase back and down you again.
---
He’s a pretty weak killer but also extremely simple to use. In lower ranks he does really well because people don’t know how to loop very well.
---
Well the only time I get mad about gen rushing is if people bring BNPs and gen builds otherwise I get annoyed over gen spawns, survivor spawns and my lack of gen pressure that I failed at or just in general shitty map for the trapper.
---
but usually, people who go "fucking gen rushers" are not realizing these things I said and are just annoyed
---
Probably Demogorgon. He's a 10ft tall lumbering killing machine. He'll catch you and gobble your ass up without a 2nd thought. Your best bet would be to hope he goes for the head so you lose consciousness before he eats anything else.
---
Can we get Robin tho???
---
The problem is map design, a good number of maps can spawn loops that good survivors can run the killer on for too long, thus one chase can take 3 gens to do even if the killer plays it right.  Gen speeds aren’t really that much of a problem, map design is.
---
Are you implying that I’m not a good survivor on purpose, or on accident? Not everyone has good coordination and timing and even if you didn’t imply that intentionally it’s still rude to say something like that.
---
I feel like having hexes be their own perk slot would kinda take away from the risk reward factor of hex perks like Devor Hope it can be a really good perk or it could be shit
---
Can you teach us how to skew the trapper image to Shrek like that? I only know how to motion track. It would help with my video memes. 
---
Nice vid
---
shit my bad, i posted this quickly and forgot
---
he also proceeded to teabag at every single pallet
---
Shitheals lol
---
Leatherface, trapper, legion, hillbilly (kinda), huntress, pig, clown and the two sneaky bois (ghostface and myers) all dont need powers?
---
absolutely correct. when the killer quickly kills all survivors, no one screams "kill rushing". killers have one objective : kill. survivors have one objective : survive.
---
This is hilarious xD
---
It's cool, but like, I'm just telling you this because the mods are absolutely (and eventually) gonna take it down for that reason.
---
That michael looks braindead
---
yup! just replacing the post now
---
&gt;Welcome bij dbd 
---
Lmao
---
Sad but true 😂
---
Idk about that. Pretty sure google is compromised, too.
---
Read again.
---
I'm special ok
---
lol yeah
---
You could wait until someone is injured in chase, then they could get slugged while the timer runs out
---
Killers don’t like it when the survivors do the objective. 😂
---
For as fat as he is, he is fast
---
Dude, that's just your phone. Try playing on something released in the last 3 years.
---
Fuck you might be right first YouTube then the actual search engine
---
nice 👍
---
He looks like a turtle
---
I takes too long to play against one, because if you don't have small game, you're going to crouching the entire game. You are better off dc'ing and finding a new game
---
This was already posted.
---
Its biggest issues of Shrek 3 were the poor choice of a main antagonist and it having essentially the same "moral of the story" as Shrek 2.  
---
Prince Charming as a main villain in Shrek 3, after having been a secondary villain used mostly for comedic purposes (and after more or less having his character fully developed) in Shrek 2 just wasn't a good idea and was doomed to fail the moment it was conceived.  
---
In my opinion, Shrek 3 should have just been Shrek Forever After. Going from accepting yourself as you are to the overcoming the fear of being a parent would work better without forcing in a filler movie with pretty much the same lesson as the previous movie.
---
Even worse when you know baby dweet is being chased
---
Rip, your karma died
---
How long did it take you to cut out the IU?
---
That ash is perfect
---
i disabled messages on xbox for this reason, survivors are just toxic. at least on xbox i would get 1-2 survivors messaging me every time i played killer whether i 0k or 4k.
---
With you, that makes 5 peoples that misunderstood this post I think.
---
As expected, would like to give cred if I knew who.
---
if you get anything under a 4k, it’s “gg ez”. if it’s a 4k, they complain about tunneling or camping etc
---
Emoji = Downvote
---
Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasal, Sloppy Butcher, and BBQ. Addons are key though. Use the addons that exaust the survivor and the one that gives them extra hindered. Take away their toys and loops are ezpz
---
Why would she run back in jesus christ
---
Yes you can, it teleports the killer around.
---
It's fine.  Your flair said "Looking for Advice" so I tried to provide that.  It appears you're looking for more of an Echo Chamber though.  I can't do anything for that.  Best of luck to you and your teamates.  Run what you insist on running just please make sure to do your part on the gens for their sake.  That's a real problem with that perk.  Just don't be that guy is all I ask.
---
Monitor and STBFL
---
And yet this post is still up 20+ hours later because the mods here are both incompetent and lazy.
---
If you squint the 17 turns into a 1
---
I don’t go out of my way to accuse people of doing it, but I think that gens do go way too fast sometimes. I think the main problem is map design rather than the survivors’ playstyle
---
 Ghostface: Phone Call  
---
dokkaebi be like NANI
---
thx!
---
X hours played = X rank survivors 
---
This is their algorithm 
---
I feel like a better caption would be something along the lines of "When you are hiding in a locker and the killer knows you are there."
---
 she thought it was safe to come out but i had recovery addons
---
&gt; "if I don't like something it's unacceptable and bad and if you like it you're bad"
---
I was worried I might be spoiling it for someone. Wish I could rename the title to spoiler.
---
Why even reply to this person?
---
It is such a pleasure to see that someone analyzed the situation instead of just crying or insulting other players. I wish you all the best and hope that this debate will stay fertile and open minded. 
---
My opinion is that indeed, when I play on killer side, it seems like the gens are popping too fast and sometimes I’m feeling helpless and stressed by the fact that I’m being pallet looped while everybody is working on escaping without having pressure from my side. My game end with 0k, 1k or 2k in average, which I’m ok with if the trial was fun :). 
---
I liked the game better on low ranks though (I’m rank 4 btw) as I felt like the survivors focused more on hiding, cleansing, helping each others, searching chests and map knowledge was lower which made them not confident enough to act ballsy. I was not oppressed by the time I’d be wasting and killer was to be feared. :) !
---
I wish something was done also, maybe upon the generators speed or perhaps adding another objective before opening the exit gates, I believe this would bring some variety on the perks’ choices as the meta is really about slowing generator progression today as a killer, and wasting killer’s time as survivor.
---
Why you level your killers like that?
---
When you are talking about map design, what would you change to make to game more enjoyable ?
---
This is why I don't use non viable killers. Big maps/survivor maps are so bad for them aswell. Unless I have a offering for small maps.  Usually run a try hard setup because survivors crutch perks are Sucha carry lol
---
   What do you run for perks on killer? 
---
Good luck on your next games!
---
I mean, it *is* a really amazing perk.
---
I mean she literally chased one guy all game, applying zero pressure to 3 survivors is an easy way to lose gens
---
She thought wrong lel
---
Ruin, Monitor &amp; abuse, Sloppy Butcher, Save the best for last, Make your choice, Haunted Grounds and Nurses Calling
---
it is the thought that counts
---
Cool and congrats and all.. but.. thats nothing you’d expect on this sub
---
Okay, cool, why?
---
Tell this to overwatch players. It's bad down there
---
Lmao Nurse is the best
---
Rank 15 and lower get matched with anyone cause there isnt any low rank players
---
I've gotten 1 salt message in my last 20 or so killer games compared to about 2 positive messages postgame on PS4.  
---
Are you sure you aren't playing in a manner that is encouraging these survivors to get pissed at you every game?  I find it difficult to believe our console communities are that different from each other.  
---
In my experience killers that consistently receive salt play in a manner that invites it.  Typically camping and tunneling.
---
Mario about to do the clown Mori on ash
---
Thank god I didnt miss that skill check
---
Thanks man! I had to play trapper for one of my challenges, and i’m particularly bad with him haha.  good luck to you too!
---
I love this art! But how dare you even think that bill would take his cigarette out of his mouth smh
---
Yup, and since they removed the ability to see your teammates' ranks i cant know when to dodge so i can get into a fair game
---
Well that whole part about screaming just from him walking by will be removed soon. Instead he'll get a blast that will instantly tier up the madness of any survivor in his terror radius that he can only use every sixty seconds
---
I mean he would call people in his original movie decades ago lol
---
I think you might be right. The problem is that a chase can too easily lasts for too long resulting in 3 gens popping for the first hook.
---
Sneak up on people and since you hit so often with hag you can get STBFL stacks really fast making it lethal
---
You may be the most entitled killer main I have ever had the disadvantage of having a discussion with on reddit. And that says a lot. 
---
Adrenaline isn’t a second chance perk, they get to use it because they do their job correctly and got to end game.  Did you just fucking lump dead hard in with second chance perks? It’s an exhaustion perk that’s used once in chase and if you’re a smart killer you can bait them. 
---
I will justify DS because I was there with old DS and that shit was a pain in the ass 
---
Why would we blame ourselves when the killer couldn’t Fuck off and not tunnel us? Quit trying to justify your shitty gameplay and make it our fault that you ate DS.  Add more pressure instead of tunneling and you won’t have this problem. 
---
Of course you get hit with it a lot!! You don’t leave them hook or can’t pay attention who you just unhooked!  And what streamers? Who Tru3? That piece of shit annoying entitled killer main? I’d rather chew on glass.   Otz makes good points sometimes about DS but very rarely. 
---
And I’m not sure if you can read or not, but trust me I play killer. I don’t know how many times I need to say that. But I won’t repeat myself again.   Just because I’m not toxic or experience  DS often like you, doesn’t mean I don’t play killer. Clearly multiple disagree with you and your whining. I would just uninstall the game if you’re that upset
---
i didn't say that is bad o something
---
Play myers with scratched mirror on The Game... salt will flood in. 
---
“Fuckin tunneler/ camper!” 
---
“Dude... I see you guys camping hooks every time.”
---
Congrats! I'm also 1 trophy away from it. Need about 100 more sacrifices.
---
Trying to get the Adept Plague Trophy for a while now :/
---
as do I. it's always killers complaining about arbitrary made up parameters they've set that survivors need to follow without being privy to them.
---
Nice drawing. You have some great lines on display here. The art looks cute too.
---
God this comment is such a meme
---
depends on the rank and survivors. Her lack of mobility would cause her to lose pretty fast as one surv is looping you and 3 are doing gens over the map
---
I’ll start ghost face right now :)
---
Emoji bad upvotes to the left
---
I could see them doing this, tbh.
---
❤️
---
Im at 49

So people aren't allowed to say how they feel?

Relevant read:  ["I'm a Dead by Daylight player and a psychologist"](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/60j6se/hi_im_a_dead_by_daylight_player_and_psychologist/) 
---
They suggest DBD is all about humiliation: That's the thrill of playing this game. Outplaying your opponent and asserting your superiority over them (or at least dragging them down to your level) is the underlying motivation for playing this game, whether you're a survivor or a killer.
---
He was a track star.
---
To be fair, i like I’m All Ears too
---
I personally think its underrated. Quaker Otz has good taste in perks.
---
Considering it allows you to get a crutch key ezpz yeah it's good.
---
Otz is the perfect being
---
Corrupt is a Plague perk
---
As a Hag main, I’ll tell you that build doesn’t play much. I got to rank 2 playing perkless and addonless. Your playstyle plays.
---
The best build for her I’ve found is:
---
Corrupt Intervention- makes it so gens don’t pop on the other side of the map during set-up. It's a better ruin for Hag
---
Save The Best For Last- you switch targets a lot so you’re very likely to stack it up and it decreases the time you are locked after a hit, letting you teleport to anyother trap even if it was triggered a moment before the hit
---
Monitor And Abuse- Hag has a smaller terror radius. Monitor turns you into a stealth killer. It’s one of the best Hag perks
---
Last slot is debatable. Some run BBQ for points. Some run A Nurse’s Calling to sneak up on people thanks to Monitor. I personally run Agitation to shorten the counterplay window (people will try to activate the traps when you’re carrying someone. Going faster = less time for them) and sometimes get some hits, even downs thanks to STBFL when people underestimate your speed
---
You’re going to run out of stacks and be seen thus giving the killer the extra uses of bbq...
---
that should be a totaly rare and weird and useless easter egg
---
since your an m1 killer, noed is always a solid choice if you are having trouble
---
ruin cause well ruin, monitor to get close before theres time to run (16m terror radius), sloppy to slow down healing, Save the best for last to cut down chases and hit multiple people quickly, Make your choice: just wait for them to unhook before you teleport, haunted grounds to snowball and Nurses to catch them off guard (especially if you have monitor).
---
Yea ik just thought it sounded funny also it would make samination more accurate
---
i didn't say it's bad or something
---
You guys are getting kills?
---
Me?
---
We must stab. 🔪
---
I see no Christmas spirit here 
---
This post was made by the Jolly Stabby Gang
---
because  the bird  could be trap
---
im sure im not playing in that manner, yeah.
---
imagine this sub if everyone started posting they're double pips
---
I'm rank 10 but the last time I played (I'm taking a little break from killer) I had four rank four only games in a row.
---
Flair checks out
---
This is the best legion
---
This post was made by the Jock Stabby Gang
---
Mfw because I farmed with some survivors it took me less games to get 6 traps in one game and to sacrifice everyone in the basement then to escape as Claudette. I got tunneled and/or camped 4 games in a row, I’ve never felt more sad in all of my hours of playtime
---
Oh come on its not too easy i am only at level 57
---
Nice
---
Yeah, pretty much. If he gets the shock on demand with no switch timer, he's gonna be REALLY hard to loop.
---
The Doctor is in!
---
The best is when they camp the post game chat
---
That is freaking bizarre then genuinely.  Weird that the same game differs on both consoles in terms of sportsmanship like that because this "every single game" salt messages isn't a thing on PS4.
---
I CHALLENGE YOU TO A STAB OFF
---
Legit though. i play this game about 20 hours a week and i'm only at level 53,only have the killer challenges of tome 4 left.
---
The flip side to this is solo survivor... you can  do everything you're supposed to but if the 3 other survivors aren't pulling their weight you're going to lose eventually.
---
Imagine being caught by infectious fright.
---
idk about you but stabbing ppl while ur angry once will give them deep wound, but stabbing them again while ur angry will not harm them at all, feels like a supernatural power that works against you
---
Best is when we don’t have post game. Then they spam me mid game with updates. 
---
But then they get a ban for harassment.
---
Dude dont post this, If BHVR sees this they might nerf the legion again
---
Weak. I haven't finished the 4th tome challenges because I finished the battle pass.
---
OH HO HO HO YOUR APPROACHING ME
---
They already do
---
Usually just go though pinterest. Found a lot of good dbd art on there.
---
do you watermark your memes?
---
I'm there too but Holy shit did I go through agony to get there
---
COME ON FUCKER IT IS ON
---
Not if we StAb them
---
Nope, idc if ppl repost them if it makes them laugh
---
Serious advice: Don't level people like that. Get their teachable perks before you work on the next. Or at least stop at perk-slot milestones. You're technically ensuring every single killer is as weak as possible that way.
---
ONGUARD
---
I GOT YOU NOW *stab* SHIT.......................................................... COME AT ME
---
at lower ranks it wasnt as frequent but w the new ranking system im stuck in higher ranks as killer where its a lot worse. the low rank survs are usually chill
---
Ok stop
---
You know what, at this point legion is a challenge character, let them nerf him more and then we show them that we can still stab their ass off
---
Just look at em dude
---
# /s
---
Noed is always a solid choice if you want to have trouble lol.  It encourages terrible playstyle decisions and its users typically voluntarily skip pressuring gens which wrecks them against good groups.  Also any groups that cleanse dulls, gg that's a wrap on to plan B, wait what?!.......there is no plan B?  Just the NOED?  Well fuck me...
---
this comment alone is an award itself, much love to you fren &lt;3 thank you so much!
---
Don't know I didn't play against that many players that used it.
---
Thank you very much, that was super helpful!
---
And people wonder why BOTH sides hate survivor mains.
---
I think my main issue is that people want those 4ks, but don’t want to accept that she’s just not always viable. So they resort to the scummiest tactics to win. 
---
Nothing wrong with liking a character or playing one for memes. I personally like Ghostface but I’m able to accept that he isn’t always viable. And before the rework I was a PROUD Freddy Main. I didn’t resort to the usual play style of old Freddy, I worked hard at him and found my own build and style to be viable and have fun at my own level. 
---
But it just seems like people INSIST on playing her without being willing to accept what a low tier  killer she is. Sure you can have fun with her but still.
---
Thanks! I try to do what I can but its kind of off putting when I get into lobbies that have violet-red ranks on them haha
---
I don't DC but I'm so unimpressed by the Wraith and Ghost Face. I think their abilities are frustrating and their character designs are boring, especially when they're played with the exact same uninspired Ruin/BBQ/Nurses set
---
Lol wait Xbox controllers still have battery packs? That's sad
---
Ok first off, a gun would be OP as hell, and his perk that silences it is useless. Second you are aware that spies in the shadows exists right? Third and finally, that just sounds like a less visible demogorgon portal
---
yeah, should do, but unfortunately majority of the fanbase is whiney and toxic. I'm a low rank killer being put with high rank survivors and they're toxic for no reason. sorry I'm new and don't devote my time to a video game. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
how did you do dark senses?
---
I understand that, but his method in doing so isn't that of a traditional hero. He's more of an anti-hero. Not exactly good, not exactly evil. At least, that's my perception. I think an "on-the-fence" character would be unique.
---
I was running a 3-gen Myers near the basement with a bugged Hex spawn (Ruin had literally spawned right where the survivors did in full unconcealed view of a generator), since it was broken almost immediately and they were at least a two-man (it was cleansed while I was chasing the guy I found on it)...
---
I wasn't even doing Six Feet Under, I was mostly just trying to stall with Pop 'cause I was getting gen rushed hard, but this Yui hung around my 3-gen while injured and went down in the killer shack on death hook, she disconnected as I picked her up to deny me getting a basement kill even though the other 3 survivors were still alive.
---
Like this killer challenge is absolutely awful, and 4 kills? Whatever happened to "the average is 2"? Like for fuck's sake, BHVR.
---
They didn't even make the survivor challenge one that can be screwed by disconnects, they literally just made it "survive with Claudette"; you can locker hop all game with Calm Spirit, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, Left Behind, and a key and end the game with 0 points and get the "Survivor Master" challenge.
---
But no, the killer has to get four kills - twice the desired average - in the area survivors avoid the most and can easily run too far from if you're forced to M1 them, and then even if you successfully drag and kill 3 there, boom, disconnect.
---
Nice!!! Way to rep. We love our urban streetrat
---
A big reason too is the perks man. I feel like I'm always just running 3 perks because I need Ruin or Corrupt Intervention to have fun. I reach the red ranks a couple of times and now I just play enough to get to rank 6 because it just becomes so unfun after that.
---
I play Survivor more  (about a 70%/30% Split) and I understand why perks like Borrowed Time and DS are necessary but when really good players take advantage of what they're not meant for it's somewhat frustrating. It's suppose to be anti-tunnel help but it just boils down too "I am invincible for 60 seconds, even if I miss play hard or get caught out of position again."
---
That's because theirs no downside to playing toxic, it literally always guarantees results it's stupid
---
When I started playing this game I used to watch people that were actually good with the killer that I wanted to use so I could learn tactics and how to play. In turn this also taught me basic game mechanics as well a positioning better so I'd definitely say watching people that are good is a good idea. I generally watch truetalent, otzdarva, and zubatlel, all of whom have a yt and twitch :)
---
I know right!
---
Good quality Meme  but WRONG MASK should be ONI
---
This game is killer sided! The stats don't lie /s
---
Yeah I have this perk because I play billy as a snowball killer when this shows up on a gen I get the survivor and hook bbq's auras let's me the next person and kill the. Also for genrushers
---
A wraith killed 3 survivors only to supervise me fixing four generators and escorting me to the exit. What a lad
---
I'm not a survivor main by any means but it should at least have an 80% chance to muffle the explosion at rank 3. 50℅ isn't good enough.
---
I used that same build but put on Iron Madden for those quick reloads
---
I'm just shelling out ideas. I haven't played for very long, as I only got the game recently. I don't have all the DLC. I'm not aware of everything that exists in the game as of now. Again, it's just a thought.
---
it is the same for PC now so nope we are all fucked they kinda butchered him
---
*ps I have been told pc has it like console now so don't parade me if I am wrong*
---
I don't see any problem here! 4 survivors \* rank 4 = 16 = 1 killer \* rank 16 
---
BALANCED AF!
---
Didn't the Devs say they were turning off Matchmaking for the Holidays?
---
Had a match in Coldwind last night where the second I would come close the survivor would just run back to that loop with the sacrificed pig. I'd barely be close and they would sprint over there and then teabag. That's all they did the whole match.
---
[Had the same thing this morning.](https://imgur.com/a/TosUWqd)
---
A Doc that actually used a Haddonfun offering. You hate to see it but you also love to see it. I ran the poor guy the entire game, think I did maybe one gen.
---
The proportions
---
Jesus. This picture hit me right in the feels. I actually ended up quitting killer for like 6 months due to a situation like this. Beautiful art.
---
Why the fuck is this so stretched
---
Thanks everyone for all your opinions on this. I didn’t want to get into a huge debate personally but just wondered what others thought about it. Glad that no one has been argumentative in their points.
---
Indeed she played poorly sometimes. What would you do then ? I hate camping, I usually go for patrolling, find another survivor, the first guy gets unhooked and I get pallet looped again. 2 gens are to be done and I know that, soon, I’ll be only 1 generator away from losing. The only way I can turn the odds in my favor is to « soft camp » and find &amp; chase the wannabe rescuer leaving 1 on hook, chasing one and knowing that only one survivor will be working on gen as the third will be trying to rescue. I still feel helpless when I play killer though :(
---
Old Mettle stacked by getting hit by basic attacks. It let you ignore a hit that downed you. Basically adding an extra 2 downs worth of chases if all 4 had it.
---
It’s good that you’re coming up with ideas, but please consider if they’re too OP or already exists as a perk, add on or power
---
u have 16 or 15 days to complete them sir so choose it wisely
---
Or maybe just compile a list of players who camp as Leatherface and for the next two thousand games as survivor (increased by 100 per disconnect), people who disconnect to deny challenges can only queue up against facecamping Insidious Leatherfaces.
---
Also they spawn in the basement on the hook already.
---
Also they can't attempt to Kobe, and struggling is automatic.
---
But they can't go afk, they have to press their struggle key anyway or it adds an extra game.
---
And they can't play as killer until they finish their queue.
---
So their next 100 hours of gameplay (at a minimum) is just getting facecamped, + queue times.
---
Lol  there's 8% chance of trigger a skillcheck while doing a Gen. Even if you're not that good hitting the greats, 8% means that it can be triggered like 4 skill checks in full Gen repair. if you fail 3 of them, it still worth just stick to the repairing instead of stop and search for the totem. It isn't that powerful as you said once you get used to it so no need to nerf it like you said.
---
I play on PS4 and the TV I’m using isn’t the best
---
That happens to me everytime on that map when the window is open, as soon as I enter the place, to the window they go until I'm almost at the window.
---
Errr... have you actually succeeded in this challenge with this loadout?
---
People DC instantly once they realise there's an IRI head.
---
well congrats ig
---
well shit, thats true, im kinda used to those "double standards" so i didnt even think abouit it, as i said i was just really lucky with this challenge, hope u find honorable survivors that play fair and at least give u a chance of gettin it.
---
Pig is not even remotely close to broken. She's just another killer that relies almost entirely on both RNG and how well the survivors play. As a pig, if survivors are getting your traps off first try and finding ruin/ doing gens quickly theres almost nothing you can do. Especially if said survivors know how to loop. Pig being an m1 killer makes her very easy to loop for extended periods of time
---
If he'd hooked the Jane at any point before, she wouldn't have been able to unhook, and he could have forced the David out. This was 100% the killer's fault.
---
I really hope they weren’t toxic as well. As that low an amount of blood points for a killer is punishment enough for something that’s not your fault :(
---
Killers that idle around waiting for noed to go of and trap the remaining survivors with bloodwarden, if i see a killer just standing in place doing nothing, i'll dc because there's no fun in just repairing gens without getting chased
---
Coming from a killer main, that sounds absolutely awful
---
I used to, but he’s pretty ass now snare Freddy is basically a better clown.
---
yea on Xbox/PS4 the longer you wait, the bigger the range with no limit. if rank 4 survivors can't find any other killer, they'll eventually get the yellow/brown ranks
---
(I think, I don't play there)
---
Wow that sucks hard
---
Omfg, lovely. What video-editor do you use btw?
---
Maybe it should be default in red ranks, maybe. But survivors in any other ranks always spend half the game looking for ruin whenever I use it.
---
Even if I get tunneled to high heaven I always give a gg or nothing at all. No sense in being toxic. At the end of the day it’s just game.
---
What type of platform do you get these messages from?
---
I use a wire, my Xbox can't even find wireless controllers these days.
---
Oh! Even better!
---
Iri head = DC
---
That would be helpful
---
If he wants to complain, he should go to the “posted by “this” gang ones
---
I normally don't, unless she's using the Ultra rare that shows her auras of puking (thus broken) survivors for 5 seconds each time they puke.
---
Little did you know, you've cursed yourself to 100 facecamps, followed by 100 Iri heads, followed by 100 games of Scratched Mirror Myers on Lery's or Hawkins.
---
And then once you finally breathe a sigh of relief, 1000 games of two survivors disconnecting and leaving you 1v2 against a slugging Pig with like 7 RBTs.
---
Every other one you disconnect on doubles these numbers.
---
Enjoy!

i try to have fun, but playing survivor just stresses me out. i love the cosmetics so I'm really doing my best to like it, but between feeling as if I'm letting my team down and also my heart racing during chases, i just end up stressing too much. killer is so much more of a chill exp cuz even if i lose, only i lost
---
Isn't it the same? According to the wiki, you have 8% of trigger a skillcheck at any given moment. Basically every moment you have 92% of not trigger a skill check.
---
Every time I run it I get caught first
---
[It's been whacky all morning.](https://imgur.com/a/TosUWqd)
---
Would definitely make it harder for newer killers
---
You are not the only one. I am playing at rank 7 as killer and red ranks is everything I've had today. I switched to survivor which was 7 and I'm getting matched with rank 17 or 16 survivors and killer. Just as usual the game is in a garbage state and little to nothing will be done. The sounds are fucked once more, the match making is fucked and sometimes even the game crashes.

Damn man I feel for ya. I haven't had to deal with that since ps2
---
This game has been out for years. Bugs like this still existing is pathetic.
---
oh my dude you gotta get on the brazilian servers, killers are so chill as long as you are, i keep ending up playing hide and seek or something with the killer lmao
---
Play for the ones you can get if you want to move through thr rift. Sure, you lost time, but you still have the present, so enjoy it. At the end of the day those numbers shouldn't be giving you anxiety; they're just numbers. Live and play the game for enjoyment and don't pressure yourself to live up to them
---
It looks like motion tracking to me, but he’s also rotating the face according to Shrek’s angle. Either way it would still be motion track
---
On the one hand I really like how OP sends a message with the mori to the attempted rescuers.
---
On the other hand they'd already turned away from the flashlights, they could have tried for a hit on bodyblock and then mori'd the dude. \^\^
---
Or maybe just hooked him again, there are still 5 gens left, and this was so delayed I doubt they were SWF.
---
Attack on titan reference nice
---
I deadass stared at this like

"Bruce in a brawl...? ...oh"
---
jUsT aPpLy PrEsSuRe GeT gOoD
---
Well in mine (see my comment) it was a Doc so they did get points from shocks and such. Guy actually did hook myself and the Jake (I eventually got bloodlusted down and I knew I wasn't gonna die after running the guy for over 5 minutes). He was also super happy about getting his "damage the same gen 4 times" challenge done so hey, win for him too I guess?
---
Are you playing on Steam? You could disable the end-game chat and never again have to care what the survivors say about you.
---
yea, i’m the Feng and i was just taking my death but he wouldn’t fucking leave lmao
---
It’s still random though, and ruin is a nuisance compared to perks you earn like pop or surge if they would buff it to 18%
---
They sell rechargables
---
Yes, Killer powers too, I just forgot to take a picture of them.

A HUGE shoutout to /u/Aurarus, who helped create the add-ons and offerings. This wouldn't be possible without him because *I am lazy!!*
---
If you add up the surviver ranks it very even, stop complaining baby trapper
---
I wish I was on this server. too many bad players these days
---
I don't fully disagree to be honest , I think there should be at least some type of slowdown that is default but not hex ruin . For example just making gen speeds slower .
---
And if you're wondering how this match ended: https://clips.twitch.tv/CogentLongScallionNomNom

THE ULTIMATE LIFEFORM
---
Rule #1 of Solo Survivor: Every single player is a potential enemy.
---
The problem is there's not enough killers right now at high ranks in general. Pipping system for killers is much tougher than for survivors since you not only have to 4k to pip in red ranks, but you also need at least 10 hooks to even safety on top of having enough chases to boost Chaser emblem.
---
Can we just go back to Victory Cube win conditions for killer please?
---
Jokes aside Having to rely on 1 specific perk just to slow the game down enough so you won't lose isn't very good for the game.
---
This also happened to me. I don't play much killer but when I did (rank 17) I got paired with a red rank, a purple rank and 2 green ranks. They really need to do something about the matchmaking. New players are not gonna have a fun time.
---
Ahhhh you mean heal tapping.  That's the way I generally heal gen tappers.
---
Main selling point was the 400mb for the whole household.
---
Who's that?
---
Actually as a survivor I find it more stressful. I’m a very new survivor. I’ve only just got one character to 31 and a handful to 10/15. I find it more stressful as when I get back to pat game lobby, if I’ve not done 4 gens, 5 hook saves, got the other three out and run the killer the whole game I get raged at. 
---
As a killer I’ve had people be toxic to me as a rank 20 killer against a 12 12 14 and a rank 8 survivor I only had the rank 8 toxic rage me. That I can deal with. Me having a bad game makes a low score for me but can make an easy game for the survivors. So they get better points. The other survivors said I did ok, just it was obvious I had stuff to learn. At least they weren’t toxic dicks. 
---
But honestly I’ve only found the game stressful when I’m trying to work on a gen with ruin active, one Claudette running for the totem, a survivor slugged and one on the hook, but I’ll get the blame for the one that got hooked and I’m the reason the other got slugged trying to unhook. The Claudette gets no blame as despite technically doing nothing she was “cleansing a totem” and when I point out she didn’t and one of the others did later I was a “lying piece of s*** who should f***ing kill myself”....
---
So nah I’m sorry I feel survivor is more stressful.
---
As a baby nurse, too, just to make sure the salt on the wound reaches the bone.
---
Spirit: you have better crowd control than you think you do. If you are keeping track of multiple survivors at once you can pretend to phase to one while actually switching priorities and phasing to another. Very many survivors will expect you to narrowly chase one while they do the same gen; pretend to leave and phase back and get them off the generator
---
"wrong, you are right, but here is a hypothetical situation where you are not"
---
I do agree that weak perks should be buffed but DS right now is still really strong and i barely ever see anyone in higher ranks not run DS.
---
finally a veteran who didn't use his money to complete the Rift
---
I just got out of a match with him, probably my 3rd time playing him in general, and it was awful
---
An international treasure
---
Seeing more than 2 decisives makes me shiver a bit
---
I pretty much carried my team through a game doing a challenge. Gave them all green/purple medkits and looted an Alex Toolbox versus a Trapper and proceeded to use it to sabo his traps all game. The medkits allowed them to quickly patch everyone up and we all got out except for a Meg (who got 3 full hooks).
---
No killer selection should ever make you DC.  Only time I dc as a reflex is if I'm up against an infant that ran a mori and decides to mori me directly off hook literal seconds later after committing to a hard proxy camp.  Those dudes can eat a double dick sandwich.
---
in the time it took me to hook one person, they had 3 gens done. and they were bming me the whole time, while I have a killer with one perk equipped. nice
---
also on ps4
---
Fixed!
---
i would DC 2.
---
I think they should nerf ruin and get rid of great skill checks. That way there's no more extra progress by hitting great skill checks at all even without ruin, but ruin doesn't have to be as annoying and prevalent. Just like how they nerfed brutal strength but made the default pallet break speed faster.
---
This. 
---
My high rank has gone down to 10 because of trying to learn the Oni. I'd be lucky to get one sacrifice in a game.
---
theyre jst getting the challenge done. ppl saw me easily as bubba. theyd even flashlight me and tbag. but bubba waited patiently for his chance
---
can someone explain pwyf and nemesis to me? like you get a token once you get stunned and let go of the guy but you use it to hit the guy so its like bloodlust 1 mid chase, is it really worth 2 perk slots?
---
feelsbadman
---
people suck sometimes
---
Way to suck and not get those extra 1k hatch points.
---
Yeah. Don't be such a try hard
---
Kidding
---
I can't play ghost face or spirit for toffee. You have some people you can do KYF with? That's always my advice
---
That's if you even get the challenge done. I finished it one time and it didn't count.
---
I asked a reasonable question and gave my opinion calmly. Stop trying to put words in my mouth.
---
Otz has a video that shows it to be absolutely fantastic. Like, up until 4m\~ you can't tell it's being worked on.
---
You might be thinking of Pharmacy which makes searching chests quieter and faster but literally doesn't effect the insanely loud opening/closing noise, defeating the point.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0aFo4lPARw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0aFo4lPARw) 9 Minutes ish.
---
And their salty messages and endless scuffed matchmaking screenshots. Mods ignoring the "Oversaturated content" rule. Not that it's surprising. They barely even post the weekly threads. They're more like every-other-monthly threads.
---
If you compare it to an early pre-alpha, it's ok.  
---
Given there's bugs with infinite loading screens, matches that cannot be ended due to god mode survivors that even the collapse can't kill...yeah.
---
Everyone consider DS as a top tier perk though, literally every survivor after rank 4 has it. It's considered the best perk because it can activate 3 times for 1 minute, if the killer picks you up you get a free health state and some time to effectively loop the killer. It's dumb how 1 perk can buy you so much time and be considered an "Anti-tunneling" perk. For example, a Survivor A unhooks Survivor B and you chase Survivor A. You hit Survivor A but Survivor B gets caught with their pants down and you down them. Around 50 ish seconds have passed when he was unhooked and bam, DS. Now the killer has to waste another minute chasing a survivor just to rehook them. Saying DS right now is balanced is absolute degeneracy.
---
Strong? You obviously didn't play before the last nerf and it is now perfect against tunnelers and campers.
---
It's really useful in the right situations. I've out mind gamed so many high rank survivors because of this perk.
---
not when 75% of games have a survivor spawn 4 feet away from the hex totem
---
What does this perk do?
---
I went from rank 4 to rank 5 via rank reset
---
9/10 killers cause themselves to be gen rushed by not making any effort to pressure the gens.  It's largely a self-inflicted gunshot.  
---
Also any killer that camps or proxy camps previous hooks of course you're getting gen rushed.  You aren't giving the other survivors anything else to do.
---
Hook it and book it if you don't wanna get gen rushed.
---
Yes and no. It is very frustrating playing as a solo survivor in a match where it is clear from the very beginning that it can only end in a hatch escape. A survivor kills himself on hook with five gens left? Yeah, there's no way you'll be able to pull it off and the whole match just turns into a contest of how long can y'all stay alive until someone gets the hatch. As a killer there's always the potential to snowball or to achieve some sort of personal victory. I find it that in higher ranks there's always at least ONE survivor who is really \*\*\*\*\*\*\* annoying. If the match isn't going too well then the rest can get out, but I'mma make sure the most toxic one doesn't survive and that can be how you can feel good about the match. The solo survivor can't really have the privilege of having the chance of turning everything around like killers do.
---
Can completely understand why he uses it I mean it’s great to deal with shack window tricks
---
With all the Killers that have stealth for a power, I can see why the Devs might not like that idea, but I can definitely get behind this, yeah.
---
This is a horrible loadout for that challenge.  You're inviting DC's with that loadout.  I'd retool your strategy. because I don't even think you're giving yourself a chance here.
---
Better than the crap perk it is now
---
you could have gotten both of us killed you dumb bitch𓀡
---
srry my english it's a ghost face perk that shows the aura of one survivor if the do a quick action
---
It allows you to see the survivors auras if they fast vault of from a set of meters from you. I, however, just see the auras at all times. When they vault, near or far.
---
*tips fedora* M’lady
---
While you are on it, take Ace in the Hole to have the Ultimate Chest Build.
---
Thanks but how do I get better at tracking the survivors
---
in the "sacrifice" teaser you can see a spitter and a smoker stalking the survivors before bill's death, so yes, he's fought a spitter before
---
Why didn't the trappers get any kills before hand then?
---
In my experience, for some reason, skill checks are heavily depenndant upon framerate. If you havent already try uncapping your fps in the game files and youll hit 90% of your greats like me
---
nice thank you
---
if they are afk u get loads of ault and chaser because u running in front of a killer starts a chase and u losing a chase doubles the points of that chase. also aultrism is easy just have ur friend get hit by the killer I'm assuming the killer just has his attack button on auto click if hes afking. and heal ur teammates
---
I just thought it was cool they both have bars going down their spines and the position of the arms is almost exact haha
---
I think it's been mentioned before but I have my own slight take on it; there should be generator repair speed penalties for when you're not looking directly at the generator. Like real life, you couldn't repair a generator if you had your back turned to it. So as a trade off for looking for the killer, you lose speed.
---
An addition to that would be as soon as you start working on the generator, your character goes into 1st person which means you lose situational awareness and the ability to look behind you when working on the generator. This makes it easier for killers to do generator grabs, and pushes survivors to wait till at least 2 of them are together so they can look over each other's shoulders, slowing down generator progress even more.
---
What a time to be alive!
---
Check out u/stillinthesimulation. They have a whole comic dedicated to a monstrous Patrick
---
In general survivors hate leaving unfinished generators, they often carve out the same routes around certain landmarks, and groups tend to stick with each other (in a group of three, one wil try to finish the generator while the second will probably trail you for the save)
---
A lot of it is really listening and looking closely for the smallest cues and then keeping a poker face while you do.
---
For example, once I took Bill to the hook hearing footsteps behind me. I pretended to face the shack but instead phased back around to hit Meg, who was following me to save Bill, hiding in the rocks behind me. Then I noticed Feng Min in the background hide in a locker, so pretending to still focus on Meg, I phased to the locker
---
^ Obviously that example was one of extraordinary luck. But one principle of your phasing is concealing your intentions and acting on subtle cues that you know the survivors don't know you know yet. Because they don't see you as a threat to groups, you play on this expectation by very carefully tracking them with subtle giveaways and playing on their expectation of you to have a one-track mind
---
Otzdarva, a streamer who is going on 3000 hours in dbd. Really down to earth funny guy who talks through his actions while playing. He's really helped out my gameplay personally.
---
At least their shit is consistent and not constantly bugged.
---
they should just remove them at this point. even keys dont unbalance the game the ways moris do. people love to bitch about keys, but please tell me about a time 1 gen got done then all 4 survivors got hatch.
---
https://imgur.com/YJ6lNaX 
---
Yeah....
---
as always, it's adorable and made my day! i hope you have a merry christmas and that you enjoy your holidays! ♡♡♡
---
Thats not a valid argument, bcs even thk theyre "ultra rare" and "rare" theyre really not that rare. And my point isnt about how good it is its about how unfun it is if the killer isnt nice and decides "maybe i wont kill u right after u get unhooked".
---
If it helps he's insanely good atm thanks to his recent rework, if your considering a killer you could do way worse them him.
---
That's Just facts
---
How about a bunny one for the Huntress
---
Good luck with six feet under....
---
Probably the worst challenge yet. Hope they change it because its literally impossible if the survs knows you are doing it or dc -\_-
---
If we could get the power of Epic but the creativity behind BHVR, that would be a hell of a game.
---
Yeah they suck, also killers have a grab glitch where they sometimes can get stuck in place for a couple seconds, people are abusing that grabs don’t work 3/4ths of the time. I grabbed someone on a 99 gen, and it got stuck in place and they did the gem right in front of my face....
---
Now Nemesis appeared
---
I would mabey buy IT. Depending on what IT is
---
Ghostface calls:
---
“WAZZAAAAAAAAP“
---
against good survivors m1 killers struggle heavily.
---
when you have to make a big drop but you dont get staggered cuz u have bl
---
when u wanna see your teammates
---
when the killer tunnels u but its ok cuz ds
---
this comment was made by the not perks that are entirely useless if youre even half good at the game gang
---
DBD is consistently bugged lmao
---
Oh no it would be this game, but with the power of Epic behind it to eliminate bugs and such but we still have the creativity from BHVR.
---
Ah shit, you right lol.
---
As a killer main, sometimes when I bring discordance 2 gens the  furthest from me are highlighted instantly. I’m happy to hear from you how should I apply enough pReSsUrE to keep those gens from popping in 44seconds without ruin??
---
Now that sounds like a perfect world
---
Yeah, that has happened to me when I was playing killer too.
---
I don't agree with him, but I can understand his thinking, having to waste a perk slot just so you have a chance at winning, only for it to last a grand total of 3 seconds can be very annoying, but it shouldn't be a base part of the game, and neither should DS or BT
---
That one scene where Shrek talks to Arthur next to the campfire was pure brilliance.
---
If the rest of the movie had been that good, with Shrek showing us how much he had grown over the course of the series, it would have been amazing.
---
Leatherface crying noises
---
Also I really like Bloodhound on Spirit. Even though it doesn't help in phase, in my view seeing the bright red pools gives me a much better sense of their trajectory, so I can phase from behind in a more hidden way and intercept them with more confident guessing
---
OTZ ES LA FORMA DE VIDA DEFINITIVA!
---
Why am I forced to play against a toxic bitch killer that runs an annoying build with mori and red addons when im just a casual solo survivor with no items? DONT be surprised why people die on first hook.
---
Cmon man, you forgot to change quentin. SMH
---
It's so damn under-rated on Huntress.
---
I can't tell you how many shots I've lined up since I can see exactly where the survivors I'm throwing things at are at all times. People usually call me a hacker now until I point them at my perks.
---
If for some insane reason we got a bikini for huntress I'd be content for the rest of my life. It wont happen but I want it.
---
if it is not a farming game im not going to allow you to put me in the basement so of course im going to crawl away. the dc part I agree with though
---
100% true but it is fun when this happens as they down you near the hatch.
---
Rushed action, not fast vault.
---
Leaving lockers triggers it as well.
---
That video ^ was ridiculous
---
He mended to 99% and then finished in the moment, he had Second Wind, he had Adrenaline, or he used Inner Strength.
---
I dunno if a Syringe works if the survivor uses it before being hit by Deep Wounds. I also wouldn't be surprised if he just bugged out lol
---
gosh everyone is such an asshole for not just giving me my challenge!!!!!
---
It used to be 40 meters away from you or something, but they changed it to now being applied when the survivor is within this certain range
---
dude i know this is a meme but a 7 survivor vs 2 killer mode would be nice
---
pred player pls add me and send a message
---
99 no because I was chasing him while he had it (ASAP after fatigue). He wasn’t broken, 3 gens left, couldn’t have lockered. Syringe I don’t think so but I don’t remember
---
Lol nurse
---
Instantly kills survivors when they enter the basement
---
I rlly like Claudettes animation. Cute
---
Bikini hag would be the dream
---
Like EA would care, visceral doesn't even exist anymore.
---
play hag or trapper to do it and run ruin + thanat + agitation + pop.
---
(Laughs in Wired controller)
---
I play him cause his character is cool, thr only thing that separates good clowns from great clowns is direct hitting most of your bottles. I’ve gotten ok at it, it’s harder than huntress tbh. And you get less value out of it than huntress...
---
That actually sounds really cool
---
Really interesting idea but I think itd make stealth killers insanely powerful. Like how you said in here how killers could get grabs, but with stealth killers youd have no chance at not being grabbed.
---
Unlike your other downvoting Xbox mates
---
fucking meta perks lmao, kinda sad that you and your teammate would’ve died with out them
---
I'll say it here. It's amazing on everyone other than maybe Hag and Spirit
---
Probably because of Ninja.
---
*Avalon intensifies*
---
Yeah it was hard being a hag main back in the day where she was considered the worst killer. Had to run setting addons to even make her work
---
getting 3 stacks is hard tho, i used nemesis and pwyf on legion and it guarantees 1 stack after you feral frenzy stab them and run to other survivors and it works really well but dunno if its worth 2 slots
---
Pharmacy is hugely underestimated, literally lets you search through the chest by just holding M1 for 3-4 seconds max
---
People just can't accept being tunneled. It's part of the game. Sometimes it happens and you just gotta deal with it.
---
She is one of the killers with the most map pressure and can even shut down loops with her traps. She is doing just fine. One thing there is about her is that she is fairly hard to play
---
You could probably introduce a system when non-stealth killers terror radius' doesn't give them away when they're approaching a survivor from behind, which would level the playing field a bit on the killer side. And you could introduce a new perk or modify an existing one like Spine Chill to trigger when the killer is approaching from behind?
---
Sadly but there's always fan art
---
Thanks and It is a “real” mind game: as you can saw that wasted pallet at the begging I wanted to test him his fear so now I need someone who edits this thing lol. 
---
Ps: also I know the map :/
---
It's been... Maybe two weeks? Idk, now it works tho. Btw Happy cake day dude :)
---
agreed. the dude is still occasionally sending me messages like gg ez 🙄
---
Freddy, Ghostface and Doc I hate them so much I won't DC if its just one but if I'm on my 6th ghostface in 8 matches I might then. I find them so annoying to go against I would rather go against old prayer beads spirit.
---
That would just increase the gap between solo survivors and swf
---
&gt;infinite killer add ons
---
because infinite tombstones, infinite iri hatchets w/ the belt, infinite instasaw, all that shit is balanced? lmao
---
&gt;ban a perk
---
yay now every killer gets gen rushed and every killer can tunnel without fear of ds
---
&gt;hexes blah blah blah
---
same stupid reason as removing ruin
---
&gt;thabatophobia can do ruins job
---
LMAO
---
i have over 80 ebony moris on my huntress.
---
Trapper + Shrek = Shrakker
---
Seriously cool ideas, but sadly things like these will never come because of how game changing these things are. I'd honestly love to see some concepts like these on the PTB. Even if they never pan out I think the PTB should be used more for ideas.
---
Did you not read my post?  I actively watched his content on youtube for a few months, and I stopped because I got fed up with him as I outlined in my post above.
---
And I did move onto other content creators, lololol.
---
You can't gatekeep having an opinion.
---
that's because you only went for 1 stack. It's moreso meant for the standard chase, although it does help Legion cover more ground since it affects their Frenzy speed as well. You have to actively go for the stacks though if you aren't you'll rarely get use out of the combo.
---
The way I see it, if you need that person down ASAP, getting 1 stack is enough to shorten the chase. If you have time, farm the 3 stacks off the person who just stunned you and use them to make the next couple chases massively easier.
---
For Legion specifically, it can help to farm the 3 stacks and then go into frenzy to cover drastically more ground with your increased speed, it can also help Hag, Huntress, and Spirit due to their slower base speeds and if you don't have their power available at the current moment.
---
The combo overall just helps for the standard chase in general without needing to wait for bloodlust to occur, I would say the combo is worth 2 perk slots, though you can go overkill with other perks with it. I kinda label it as the new Enduring + Spirit Fury combo, using 2 perks to deal with looping.
---
merry christmas leatherfaAAARGH!!
---
I love it, but I also love his least favorite exhaustion perk
---
It's not arbitrary.  Kills alone was a piss-poor way of measuring how well you played.  Camping was much more viable back then.  Run NOED.  Facecamp first kill.  If you're lucky you'll get another kill to facecamp, there's your safety, you might have enough time to get the free NOED down for your pip kill now.  
---
It was stupid.  Ebony moris shouldnt rank you up but they did easily.  At least the emblem system encourages you to play strong killer games (pressure gens, multi hook survivors, rack up scoring events for great BP in the process).  Kills alone was a shit system.  I'll take flawed emblems over kill based.
---
make other people suffer....wise words coming from the mouth of a killer. ...bad bad survivors...:D Give it a break and try again in a week or two...those challenges will never go away anyways even after the end of the rift....as a survivor i have to tell u goin up almost every game against a trapper with Agi is super boring so imagine being kind to every single killer who wants to get their basement hook/sacrifice....basement at this point is a forbidden zone until those challenges calm the f@ck down...
---
It makes the killers recoil in fear of being blinded, but really they ok.
---
Ridiculous! Lasted the whole game?
---
?
---
Leads me to another idea I had; local chat. Certain games have it on PC that I know of (for example, Squad with proximity chat), and that would allow survivors working on the same generator to communicate which would also encourage SWF groups to come off private parties and communicate in game with solo players.
---
Saying perfect is overeach is my opinion, alot of streamers like Not Otz and True talent have problems with the perk because it enables the survivor to be reckless and has very little counterplay to it other than slugging. Also, i can still be tunneled by the same killer, all he has to do is slug and wait the one minute to pass.
---
i would have been pissed if a DC stopped me from getting this. i would have posted here complaining, not that it would have mattered, to bhvr, that these challenges should take into account, that any DCs mean that that one survivor is not your responsibility when it comes to that challenge, i.e. that it treats it as if they were sacrificed on the hook
---
I don’t remember any of them being terrible but I do remember 3 being the hardest to remember
---
I know right! Apparently the people downvoting me don't seem to think so!
---
I DC if cheats are used or exploits that make the game impossible to play one side without it.
---
Other than that, I hardly DC.
---
Technically that's also the Spirit's backstory but here we are.
---
Also the jumpscares are annoying tp play against.
---
You forgot the part where the killer host lag switches and slugs everyone and then tbags all of us.
---
Leaving lockers fast tho
---
It’s only because everyone found out the next chapter
---
No I just think he’s toxic everyone has an opinion
---
use deerstalker for this challenge
---
Looping isn’t bullying. But what I consider bullying is teams who constantly body block hooks or teabag constantly during the game when they clearly beat the killer.
---
Constantly using the hook tech, or whatever it is called when you crouch under a hooked survivor so you can’t be hit is also kind of bullying. It makes it so any inexperienced killer feels helpless.
---
I forgot that movie existed, I read this title and immediately thought we were mutating one of the crows in the environment into a killer.
---
It's actually a very good perk,love using it
---
If they pull that cheese move where they run directly at your face to cheese your hitbox on treatment mode just switch to punishment and whack their dumbass.  That's what I do.  Free hits instead of the shock basically.  Fair trade.

a visit to the ophthalmologist bothers you?

But how do you know its haunting grounds? Or is that just a joke about bad luck?

The king from Shrek 2 dies, which makes Shrek the heir to the throne (since he married Fiona). 
---
But Shrek doesn't want to be the king, so he goes on a journey to find the next heir after him. While they're gone, their kingdom gets attacked so they have to come back with the new king and reclaim it.
---
Just because one team of survivors played “toxicly” doesn’t mean you punish someone else for it. Some of us are literally just trying to survive. And there is no excuse for abusing a flawed game mechanic to prevent someone to play and gain an unfair advantage over them.
---
MY EYES

You can tell where survivors are by sound and movement in the environment, from shuffling grass to even just the sound of their breathing, so the Spirit isn't as hindered by not being able to see them as much as one would think. However, you're going to need time to get good at that, so in the meantime focus on just learning how to phase after survivors when you have them actually running away (so that the scratch marks trace a path of where they've been and let you guess where they currently are) or think they've gone back to doing something you interrupted (such as a gen you keep having to chase them off of). Another basic principle of playing Spirit is that the only visible difference between a spirit that's phasing or standing still is the hands. Try finding opportunities to stand still while phasing and somehow trick survivors into running back into you. Just hiding around a corner and crossing your fingers can be enough for a 200IQ play, but don't bite off more than you can chew, and remember that the only difference between a cunning trick and sitting there like a lemon is if they actually fall for it. Finally, a phasing Spirit makes quite a bit of noise, but only when they're outside of their terror radius. This means that you can trick your targets by phasing to them from just  within your terror radius; try practicing this trick with Whispers while you get the chance.
---
Ghostface on paper looks like an overpowered mix of Myers and Pig, but he's actually quite the glass cannon. His ability is even more janky than Myer's, and while this is usually in your favour (allowing for sneaky stalks through little gaps in wooden walls and boarded windows, it also means that survivors often either can reveal you through opaque walls or cannot reveal you while looking you in the eye depending on how the spaghetti code feels that day. While his stalk goes through quite quickly if you can wrangle the game into corner peeks, stalking gens from around the nearest corner honestly often feels weaker than just trying for a gen grab with his already great stealth. Instead, try to build up stalk on healthy survivors that are travelling or otherwise not entrenched and looking around as much,that haven't seen you or aren't being diligent about revealing you without triggering it prematurely; after all, it's hard for GF to stalk in a chase if they're actively trying to prevent you. If you're going to be spotted while trying to play around stalking, at least try to ensure that you've squeezed out as much stalk on as many of them as you can, if not enough on at least one to quickly pop it on them when your power comes back. In other words, you won't be able to stalk in a chase and stalking easy prey is anemic compared to just attacking them, and while you should try to get everyone well stalked if the opportunity somehow arises you should pop the mark on one at a time just before you hit them (like Myers would pop it, but in a much more targeted way, and without the ability to just stalk all chase until you have it)
---
One thing you might not realise immediately is just how powerful night shroud is as in information tool. It not only lets you hide well but makes it hard for survivors to hide, as you'll see their direction the moment the game detects them looking at you. This lets a more blasé GF use their power as a poor man's whispers or deerstalker. If you can't find a survivor you've downed but think they're still near, just activate your power and walk around the vicinity and you'll find them in short order.
---
Rip xD
---
I had it disabled for the longest time but I reccently reenabled it cause it can be funny seeing the illogical garbage they say
---
now adress my other points- oh youre insulting me already lol.
---
Tome probelly. I don't mind though better than seeing spirit.
---
Yeah that's actually a good point , I also agree that it might make it boring for survivors . I think Maybe just reworking the god loops and maps might be a good option also .
---
I'm all ears is great on Clown. No one ever expects that perk which is great because it makes winning most tiles super easy with Clown's zoning.
---
I play ps4 and I've had my controller die so often mid game I just keep it permanently plugged in cause I play so close to the screen my mother would have a heart attack
---
I miss deadspace
---
Originally the perk was any rushed action outside your terror radius would give you the aura of the survivor. It just had very small applications because unless you were a killer who could remove your terror radius in chase or got any use out of aura reading from a distance it just didn't really matter.
---
I like this Idea. ALSO REMOVE THE BASMENT ONES! Just get rid of them
---
I would pay for this, no joke.
---
I just wanna 99% so I can get BP :(
---
Ah ha heres the problem ur playing nea, nea is  dead already
---
Demegorgon eats an organ
---
M’bitch
---
Shes not fun to play at all, I have no idea why they thought her blink needed a cooldown when it was pretty clear that her addons were the issue.
---
Gens can be done within 4-6 minutes. Keys and moris should just be gone. Both require no skill and are far too common for the power they grant.
---
So wholesome
---
Honestly a majority of the game's problems could be solved by fixing maps.
---
I also have 1k hours but your progress is far more than mine, also i'm happy cuz u prestiged my gorl laurie to p3
---
It’s punishment for trying to stalk a light bulb
---
Are you... certain?
---
bc its black and has some blue on it?
---
Anyone who dc are dicks and ruin the game for their whole team and make it easy for the killer who was probably a dick to destroy the rest of team
---
I mean I haven't seen people talking about it
---
No way
---
This &gt; Freddy Lunge
---
thats not toxic.
---
Thank you for the reply u/Ironman_C89. I actually play both quite equally.I agree that Thanato is weaker than ruin but numbers could be adjusted. This just proves that ruin is OP as it is in 90% of games and Thanato might be in 10%, mostly paired with ruin.
---
100% agree about the keys, I forgot about it ! Edited
---
I generally have positive experiences with survivors, especially at better ranks which is the point of ranks. I like to play with friends but auras and many other game mechanics are just useless with third party chat. Maybe an anti-cheat could ensure you don't use microphones even if you play with friends but then people will use cellhpones or whatever... I don't think there's an easy solution about that.
---
Removing add on stocks BUT also making them only types, no rarity. So no purple or pink add on. Only balanced add on types. Maybe something close to the yellow ones or attenuated higher rarity add ons. I might have not made myself clear enough about that.
---
Yeah i also think so because serviors can't just rely   
---
On God loops for the entire match therefore all gens popping after one chase .

Color scheme's pretty much identical plus the jacket is very similar to what androids wear

OMG if paulie Esther saw this I love you your my favorite YouTuber. I love him he's my favorite YouTuber I'm so glad he voice acted this I could hear it in his voice
---
It was in the last patch notes
---
What's sexual about the first 2?
---
So that means rushed but not fast vault? Or?
---
I meant more as, are you really sure it's supposed to be a reference? The only similarities are the blue highlights and the fact that the Legion stab people, which is a really big stretch.
---
I'm also not obligated to camp and tunnel but I'm still a dick if I do it
---
I love it when that happens.
---
The killer usually panicks when they feel that we can power through ruin.
---
&gt;Shitty pack

Quentin looks the same :|

ES INVENCIBLE, INMORTAL, IMPARABLE, NO TIENE DEBILIDADES! REPRESENTA A TODOS Y A CADA UNO DE LOS ASESINOS DE DBD!

Jan 2nd to the 6th i believe.
---
Ohtofu has some good critique videos that helped me learn bits and pieces there are some nice vids of youtube that give you some basics for playing some of the common tiles you will find as well
---
It can get a bit annoying but yeah, I recommend just ignoring or having a laugh at it or yourself and turning off messaging (if your on console) or closing end game chat (if on pc)
---
why are you hating on the gremlin man
---
Well I didn’t mention the messages I get whether I win or lose. I have seen so much gg ez and trash killer. Or I get constant tunnler messages.
---
A Fast Vault is a Rushed Action.
---
I'm just saying that more things trigger I'm All Ears than just Fast Vaulting.
---
I'd trade DS for Ruin any time. Those are just ideas and not all of them have to be implemented. I'd prefer to have balanced perks that don't rely on RNG than banning any perk at all.
---
yea. id trade it too. which is exactly why its a stupid idea. which was my point. your idea is to make it more balanced for a "competitive mode" but it doesn't do that. nothing could do that. because this game is not balanced for tournament level competitions.
---
It’s not there fault you weren’t taught also i understand if you don’t have time but don’t let them die and hate them because if you really care for a game you have to accept new players and at least help them a bit or else they’ll get a bad idea of a game and then they’ll quit and tell friends the game sucks and that depletes player numbers which is not good for any game (dunno why i got so serious there but hey ho)
---
The problem I have is that when i play swf the people I play with are ranks 18 and around that whilst I am rank 4. I generally have to play on a lower account which is unfair for killers. They just don't climb up the ranks like i do.
---
yeah i really don’t understand it. i’ve never messaged a killer who’s worse than me, it shows they’re trying to get better. people with those egos are just impossible, they’re terrible people online and probably irl too
---
I don’t DC but Freddy, Plague, Wraith and Leatherface are all annoying to go against sometimes.
---
Freddy if it’s a forever Freddy. I know they ‘nerfed’ him but matches with him can still take forever. The sleep timer is stupid. 60s isn’t enough, by the time you’ve woken up and started something you’ll be asleep again.
---
Plague because she’s just awkward. Nothing wrong with her design in my opinion, it’s just annoying to be sick lmao 
---
Wraith because I personally have encountered a LOT of toxic Wraiths. Literally slugging and watching you bleed out instead of just hooking you etc. 
---
Leatherface because his chainsaw goes on way too long and again most Leatherfaces I encounter literally face camp and tunnel. If it’s a Leatherface I know if I’m caught early it’s a 1k bloodpoint game and a depip. Because they just stand there. 
---
I play both sides equally and there’s no reason to face camp. Tunnelling is annoying, but it’s fair enough if they choose to go after the injured person, who can blame them? Doesn’t stop it being mildly annoying though!
---
I like it. Reminds me of Stanley Donwood's work.
---
Ohh, yeah totally my fault. Should've read your mind and look at the tiniest details you've mentioned. My previous comment absolutely does not reflect your clear intentions, my bad, I'll read your mind better next time.
---
clown one because clown is a child molester
---
Calling this anything else than awesome should be a crime
---
uh no, im pretty sure the skin is a jojo reference
---
Dear survivors.
---
Dont play the game if you arent even planning of playing it right.
---
Say for instance I get a good team, and one person goes down but we all escape. You can't be altruistic enough and just because the killer wasn't chasing you,  you lose out on Evader points. Safety pip at most.  The system forces you to do things that aren't necessary to win the game
---
Yeah I’m so sick of the same old perks being used. It’s not the killers fault because they’re meta perks for a reason, but from a survivor standpoint it’s boring af. At least it’s predictable though.
---
It's asymmetric, of course it's not designed for tournaments but those changes would make for a more balanced experience.
---
What are u talking about?
---
hold my dick

I wish they had it set up so that you could select 2 or 3 challenges to do at a time, instead of just one.
---
Imagine your power being useless
---
I started with trapper but mostly cus there were only three killers when the game first came out. I'd say try figuring out systems and mechanics and loops with him since he's got a simple ability but can still do pretty well with him.
---
Imagine being stunned for no reason
---
This is so well made. Great job!
---
Are we still talking about a haunted grounds totem? XD This was fun. Though on a serious note I can't even imagine me having time to just show someone the ropes unless they're my friend. Even if i was that kind-hearted, I just don't have the time for it.
---
I wish we could have this masterpiece on console. I'm on xbox and i kinda hate looking at some of the killers faces. And imo i think Legion should just be the group's 4 masks on all 4 corners like the Christmas Sweaters.

How is it so hard to understand that I'm not asking for the grind to get harder? I'm literally just asking for the grind to be the same across the board, so that choosing to not run BBQ doesn't cut your bloodpoint gain *in half.*
---
Here, I'll copy paste the fucking EZ math I gave to the other guy.
---
Healthy Economy= Base Bloodpoints (100%) + Offerings (100%) + Events (100%) + BBQ and WGLF (100%)= 400%.
---
If BBQ and WGLF becomes (0%), you can increase Base Bloodpoints to (200%), leading to the same overall value (400%), but players achieve that 400% without being forced into BBQ every single match.
---
Why is the community so fucking against this? It literally benefits everyone. Like actually everyone.
---
Which I think makes absolutely no sense to have your shards reset. Like you go from making 300 every level back to what? 150? For literally nothing except your devotion going up by 1 and it's not even like you have a choice. It's almost like a punishment for playing the game a lot
---
Hey thanks buddy appreciate that, maybe just look at the two pictures a little more carefully next time 👍no mind reading necessary just the use of your eyes and some common sense
---
Nice job dude! I love Junji Ito’s mangas and Spirit goes great with his style
---
Maybe you could try Oni next
---
Joinin in on the fun bro
---
Guessing you’re lower rank because once you hit low purple/red survivor queues take longer
---
hold my dick ya hurd?
---
Eat my ass daddy gorgon 😩😩😩...sorry
---
Your post probably deserved to be removed, i can't speak to the other one but yours still did.
---
I like to use stealth killers. People lile ghostface, the wraith or micheal. They are good to start with in my opinion. Although someone else good to start with is the doctor. He's a little tough to use but his power helps you find people easily. Plus he gets a crap ton of points.
---
As for perks. Of you can get them bbq and chilli is always good for more bloodpoints. And hex ruin is awesome.
---
High rank of both is the opposite
---
Go watch pain reliever on yourube, he goes into detail
---
I like how her finger’s inside her gaping wound
---
its not similar at all though, The other character is wearing formal wear, a suit and tie, with some blue tones.
---
while the legion is wearing a jacket with bright tape made for like, raves and shit
---
Idk man I had a group last night, first attempt at the dark sense challenge. They 99d gens for me and at the end saved me from the basement against a basement trapper build and tanked hits to get me across the map to the gate. Its super hit or miss.
---
Ah yes how did I fail to see the similarities with Bucciarati
---
The problem is that most people don’t chose her Bc she has a slightly higher skill cap than most killers and she utilizes a much different play style that’s not just chasing people down.
---
\*Happy stabby noises
---
I mean I hate spirit but this is some beautiful art props keep it up I love seeing dbd art especially in full detail like this. You’re very talented
---
I really hope that wasn't ruin
---
If you take something from one side, take something from another. I wouldn't mind mories being removed if devs remove keys or do something about genrush/second chance perks.
---
Guy who unironically says “Bruh you’re cheating if you don’t give me a free hook” “running is cheating!” is calling OTHER people dense
---
lmaooo not intentional but now i cant unsee it
---
It makes killers bad. Stbfl is a memeish perk. You're going to eventually run into your obsession and lose all your stacks. The fact the obsession can flip flop forces you to lose token stacks even faster. It's a garbage perk.
---
I'm all ears is the equivalent to people using oni's new perk that is the same as windows of opportunity except that it's time and proximity based. If you're already chasing someone then you don't need a perk to show you they're on the other side of a wall you just watched them window vault through. 
---
Y'all just busy suckin the man's dick and probably not skilled enough to understand that stbfl is basically the same as unrelenting and absolutely no one past rank 14 uses unrelenting because it's complete trash. I'm all ears is utterly useless in every way imaginable if you already know how to run and mind game loops and no one uses Kate's perk for the same reason no one uses oni's new perk. They're garbage perks and filling slots for perks that are actually valuable to a killer. Survivors walk all over these lame fucks that try to imitate streamers, ride their dicks then come online to cry about it later.
---
Y'all take literally everything some clown on the other side of a screen says at face value as if it were facts even when they're dead ass wrong just because you have some strange infatuation with watching them play a game instead of playing the game yourself.
---
Just stop.
---
Completely understandable still if you see someone make a mistake maybe send them a message after match saying don’t do that bye
---
Can you see the video? He’s not just running he’s teleporting. You can’t justify it just because it’s a glitch because he’s abusing it just like someone using speed hacks
---
Idc about which side gets what. The offering and item needs to go.
---
Quentin. Always Quentin.
---
Hash slinging slasher?
---
I use Moho studio, it is fuckin expensive but gives almost unlimited flexibility
---
What back accessory are you even talking about? The bear trap on his shoulder?
---
And yes I know that the balance team and the feature development team are two different teams, it's only a meme.
---
Right but ruining an experience for 4 other people by gaining an unfair advantage that can be easily remedied by taking A SINGLE HOOK is totally reasonable. Doesn’t matter it was intentional or not he clearly knew he had an unfair advantage and abused it.
---
To be completely honest, this isn't an accurate search I believe because most people will just search fortnite, right? That's the common name it has been given. The Battle Royale part isn't really used very often.
---
Insidious against a non swf, exactly shhh
---
Unrelenting is literally the opposite of STBFL though. I agree that unrelenting is extremely bad.. because you shouldn’t be planning on missing attacks. STBFL only works for hits, which quite greatly aids in getting back to your chase, and doesn’t lose stacks on obsession if you plan around it and use special attack against them (channel abyss, oni smash, feral frenzy, chainsaws, etc.)
---
why are people just now complaining about Q times acting like its bc one side just stopped playing.
---
Q times are always fucked for one side. its nothing new. the player base has not dropped, and there are enough people playing both sides, the issue is BHVR just needs to fix shit.
---
Susie, Julie, Piggy, and Huntress in bikini's.
---
Wouldn't waste money on them though, because it wouldn't be a waste. *Lenny face*
---
The hatch should’ve been next to cladette we all know they never help after finding it
---
At least the survivors acted nice in that short chat we see.
---
Everyone gets a bikini skin.
---
especially Dwight
---
i wouldnt say S tier, but def A tier. 
---
In the right hands there isnt much you can do against a hag
---
What about Nea
---
Moho studio allows you to move 2d images in 3D space which is how I made the mask stick to shreks face like that
---
Wtf why is this Left 4 Dead fanart on the dbd sub
---
Imagine using lockers when you can urban evade from nea gang
---
I like this idea. Maybe a token back when you are on a generator and finish it.
---
even for non colorblind ppl, the ski resort map is way too hard to see scratch marks and auras in
---
I certainly think it's one of the best perks. I just wanted to get the point across that being the best doesn't mean that it necessarily is the most optimum.
---
My thoughts when I see a bill not doing a gen
---
You’re so right
---
 This looks great
---
I actually remade the entire thing because cutouts usually look too blurry
---
Being forced to play around survivors because of perks makes killers weak and wastes more of their time not going for their primary objective and allows gens to be done faster because now you've put yourself in a situation where you forced yourself to play around something. You've compounded that problem because stbfl makes someone the obsession even when they're not running obsession based perks. So now you lame baby killers imitating streamers are wasting even more time playing around DS that isn't even in the match. I can sit in a locker for a full ass minute while you as the killer stand there. In that minute 3 people are busy busting out gens in your face.
---
The whole entire perk is wasted when multiple people are running DS.
---
Stbfl has always been a bad perk and will remain a bad perk. The only reason anyone uses it now is because of the blind following of sheep for this random dude that I keep seeing here.
---
If you run spine chill it will help you out. Her husk will not trigger spine chill, but her real invisible body will. If you have spine chill lit up even if she is "looking" at you, that is because she is currently phasing.
---
Competitive game mode, AKA the game mode no one plays since its just nurses and spirits against solo players. Sounds one sided to me.
---
It’s also really good 
---
It’s red velvet with pink/red
---
Black and white icing
---
Maybe it's because I'm close to the dbd east coast servers, but I never have issues with finding games as killer. I'm currently rank 4 and get games in 2-3 minutes max
---
I'm stumped myself. I'm stuck on 4 sacrifice basement challenge and 4 gens completed challenge. My goal is either with trapper or body blocker hag but I reccently prestige hag
---
Edit: I used BPS on a infinite tier 3 myers and it worked like a charm
---
I've never lost a game with Hag, playing at any rank. Build is:
---
Ruin, Sloppy butcher, Monitor&amp;Abuse, Make your choice.
---
I mean it’s cool and all but the fact that you have almost no way of losing that if you have any sort of skill is kind of sad. Borrowed time guarantees safe hook and gets David out even if he is tunneled. You go down but you now have deliverance and DS, at this point trapper can’t do anything to win. Exit gate is too close so perhaps he could slug you until you die to EGC but that’s still probably an escape. And I’ll be honest that kind of sucks dick, and a key to boot.
---
Imagine being so bad you complain about mid tier killer's powers.
---
Last year they were fine. Wtf did they change,
---
I fail to see how DS would help in a situation like that anyway, so the point is moot.
---
But i feel like stooping to your level, so Kindred exactly shhh
---
Yeah that's what I think I'll use. Monitor is easily my favorite perk
---
Obviously he sucks dick to have let you get the unhook but maybe he didn’t want to hard camp even at EGC
---
It could be worse. I actually sacrificed all survivors once and it didn't count so now you have to worry about not getting it even if they don't dc.
---
Imagine seeing a post marked rant and deciding to pour gas on an already lit match.
---
I think everyone is just downvoting because you reposted a meme without giving credit.
---
I'm glad I've finished it during DC penalties!
---
Lots of mentally ill survivors like that
---
The police come in and arrest everybody
---
T
---
Gonna be honest, as a trapper main, I feel you shoulda escaped there. It hurt to see that happen.
---
I semi-agree, T3 Myers is a great example of why a killer shouldn’t have the exposed stat tied to their power,but I believe things like Devour hope, and Rancor are ok because not only are they situational they’re vaguely counterable
---
Even better comparison than the previous one. Thanks!
---
It's not a perk lol. It's Michael ability.
---
Demogorgon with make your choice and territorial, be teleporting to the top of basement stairs as they unhook so you still get the exposed effect on savior, you’ll also still beat them to the top of the stairs and borrowed won’t come into play since you weren’t near at the time of the unhook. Although people DC when they see the baseman hooking so idk man
---
Its something since I've been meeting legion and ghost faces running it all day.
---
Set it to the mouse wheel. Less damaging to your mouse and easier to struggle with.
---
Its wrong because you typed "fortnite battle royal" this is a very specific comparism. If you compare "dead by daylight" to "fortnite" you will get the accurat comparism: firtnite still higher (kids in love)
---
It was the most painful thing. However when I rewatched the clip; I saw the tiniest sliver of bar left.
---
That happened to me with the dark sense challenge, I was so dang mad.
---
I'm still holding out for pre-Entity skins. I wanna see tiny adorable Hag pop out and wreck worlds.
---
Nah, you're a douche because of what you said.
---
I hate Coldwind so much sometimes. Can't see anything.
---
OF THE BURNING LEGION!
---
(I’m finishing the saying to his name because it comes from 1 or 2 games we like)
---
iri is a hack perk and deserves a rework
---
I even try to keep them in the center of my camera and it doesn't help.
---
no they where not lmao? Q times are always fucked, last year included. Hell its gotten better, i remember waiting 4 hours for a single lobby a few years ago.
---
Sometimes it’s fun to watch a fire get bigger.
---
Is...is t-that a bulge?
---
Patch notes: Trapper now has to rng his way outta traps like the rest of us plebeians decreased chance to escape from traps for trapper to 0.00001%(was 100%)
---
We felt he was too cute might delete later.
---
Same rank 2 killer game in 2 minuets max rank 3 survivor I have to find which phone game I'm going to play for the next 15 minutes only to join someone who dodges the lobby
---
HOW TO COUNTER EXPOSED:
---
Myers: Try not to let him stalk. Do not let him get super close to you. Loop him until his power goes away.
---
Ghostface: Use your eyes to break stealth before he can apply it to you.
---
MYC: Play immersed when you are the MYC, or go in for a hook save earlier than you would to stop it from popping. Or just let someone else go for the unhook.
---
Rancor: Play immersed when the gens are done. You have 5 warnings that the killer has rancor.
---
Devour Hope: Cleanse the totem.
---
NOED: Cleanse the totem. Do Dulls.
---
Haunting Ground: Don't cleanse the totem. Play immersed until it goes away.
---
Anything I missed?
---
I really like the brush strokes on this. The background is the rockstar here, but the tiny hook is ominous and lovely.
---
At least you're helpful.
---
Why are you complaining about shit when you are new to the game?
---
I can tell you are new bc "exposed" isnt a perk. Its a status effect. Learn the game, then you can actually complain about shit that needs fixing.
---
Not going to lie I was expecting something else #context Kappa
---
that's ghost faces power... break los
---
There is no such exposing perks except Haunted Grounds, but it's exposes after totem breaking and other perk is Rancor with noed which only activates in endgame. GhostFace have same ability as Michael but you can deactivate it just by looking at him lmao
---
T3 myers still gets looped though, and its on a timer, and he can only do it so many times in a match.
---
Ya'll some toxic ass people if you cant let a man vent.
---
Died on first hook when there was one gen left, they powered the doors and left. When I asked why nobody could save me and I got flamed and told "Just use Kindred lul" and I laughed and died a little on the inside.
---
BALD! BALD! BALD!
---
Oni. Don't feed him. Hear roar -&gt; hide in locker.
---
Your attitude needs fixing.
---
It is indeed the 14th week

grats dude, when are you going pro?

Day of the Dead Julie reporting for duty!

you're not my mom.

You will find most things in this game do have some form of counterplay, no matter how bullshit they may seem at first glance. It gets frustrating sometimes, but if we sit back and look at things from different angles, we can find our way though anything. Don't let it get to you OP.
---
The metal bar jutting out of his back , not a bear trap
---
Julie and Frank are the type of couple who wear couples costumes for Halloween
---
I play on console (xbox1) and because of the game relying on the shitty killer’s WiFi I’ll get to a full bar and just not hop off his shoulder and he’ll glide to the hook like I hadn’t wiggles out 3 seconds earlier.
---
 
---
Super frustrating considering wiggling on console is annoying anyways because you have to spam the joystick in circles to wiggle making your thumb sore. Some button mapping options would be a blessing.
---
I didn’t tell you to stop, i in no way acted toxic to you and I am in no way trying to take away your freedom of speech.....
---
I might be
---
Or go to a loop. Or play immersed. Or just like, turn.
---
I actually completely forgot about Oni because he is so bad now lol.
---
She can get nervous and vomit on her own tits :D
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Ikr Bubba is like so menacing and innocent at the same time
---
Ironically, you’d see less nipple from her then.
---
hahaha ohhh thats why😂
---
I've had killers messaging every survivor in the game and getting them to help eachother
---
At red ranks its the opposite
---
Followed to keep up to date, good work friend I envy your need to get things done. Very noble and cool thing you’re lowkey doing here an I appreciate it
---
Thanks!  I'm still new to this game and really liking it, there are so many different variables in play each match.
---
He’s talking about Spirit
---
You just made me laugh out loud for real, have an updoot my friend!
---
no
---
he just said any tips other than this.
---
He's like that gigantic scary guy in Tangled who has a series of tiny porcelain unicorn figurines. Will still ruin your life, but... unicorn figurines.
---
Let's be realistic, how often do you find yourself in a situation in which you NEVER face the killer?
---
I would dare to say that is probably one game out of a hundred. 
---
And if that's the case, then you would probably would have an iridescent emblem in lightbringer for gens, totems and doors, as well in unbroken, since you never got downed. This also means you got a silver in evader.
---
That's enough to pip. *(depending on the rank, of course)*
---
So no, I don't think the game *"forces you to do things that aren't necessary"*.
---
Too mumbly. 
---
Also imo I find people rapping fast to other people’s part isn’t very cool. What makes rapping fast cool is the man writing the part and having things rhyme and go together so he can spit fast. 
---
But y’all should look up Chop Shop by Twisted Insane.

Devour Hope, Make Your Choice &amp; Iron Maiden: Am I a joke to you?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/eeappd/gotta_love_these_glitches_ill_have_to_restart_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Nobody asked you to.. But you can't shit on the game if you don't have the hardware to play it properly.
---
Lithe is one of, if not the best exhaustion perk. The fact that balanced landing has a chance for you to not even be able to lose it and how sprint burst makes you walk all the time makes it a much better perk imo. Dead hard is pretty damn good too.
---
Iron Maiden is certainly a joke.
---
Yea that’s a bear trap lodged in his shoulder, just looks odd from this angle.
---
i also dont like exposed. its such a tease. i always play as kate but i havent seen her exposed even once even when it says shes exposed
---
Maybe even find a SO.
---
I just want to see the devs give her some decency
---
That is literally a perfect description like hes the shadow in your room that you think is a monster but is just a series of objects stacked ontop of eachother 😂
---
The exposed isn't even why T3 myers is good. It's that phat lunge.
---
Well, i forget about Choice but Devour is a joke. Whenever i play it, it get destroyed in first minute.
---
they removed the flick you get like up to around 40 degrees now
---
I just dislike its safety. It seems like such a crutch.
---
Daaaamn dude, this is so sick!! Thank you SO MUCH for sharing!
---
his username is bowdowntosatan, of course he's gonna troll you. lol
---
His counter is controlling him isn’t easy especially on consoles, so you rarely get to see him.
---
Turns out she’s European and goes topless
---
Stan? From slave raiders?
---
So i just have to turn at a different time to land demon strike?
---
Still being a hypocritical, arrogant, angry prick for little to no reason. Shocking, have a nice day fam.
---
Might be something with your files i suggest you reinstall (does it happen in survivor games? If so it might just be your pc)
---
True
---
It's not an unfair advantage if it's available to EVERYONE for free. You act as if deaf people are using cheating tools and they are allowed to use it.
---
That achievment icon isn't from 2016?
---
I'd have been pissed about this too. This is the kind of bug that shouldn't be a thing...
---
They fixed the traps catching your foot right after setting one on the floor. Shit like this shouldn't happen, it can totally throw the match.
---
Also the Trapper should start the trial with the number of traps he can carry already on his hand/body.
---
Until it runs out or the killer turns around.
---
Patrick as Leatherface with Squidward's face is terrifying.
---
you dont seem to be dead
---
No, I don't think I will....see you all in Rank 30
---
Personally Rank means nothing to me....and I playing in yellow/brown ranks. I don't need to GIT GUD...just GOOD enough where I want to be
---
Thank you, sir
---
Oni is more mid-tier with the nerfs to his demon dash.
---
I'm on console and I haven't played survivor since it's started but earlier I was fine
---
Dwight in flight
---
That would amazing!
---
Clown.
---
I'd try restarting the router and re-installing dbd, if that doesn't work then find someone more adept with networking.
---
It‘s your cake day!
---
That makes sense, whenever I play later I find the roles switch (killer is instant lobby, survivor takes forever)
---
Yea but bottomless
---
Vore mommy in a bikini would be to hot for my eyes
---
obi of course
---
lost it at the DC thats so funny. I wouldnt even be mad as trapper i love stupid glitches
---
That just happened to me, he saw me i crouched accepting defeat he gives me hatch
---
This post was made by the yoshi gang
---
Then I’d have to add a meg in to fight her for it
---
Most expose effects are not permanent so you can just burn out the timer by playing a bit safer.
---
His power is literally enraging himself and you think pissing him off more should stop his power?
---
nice XD
---
Hellraiser... hmmmm 🧐🤗
---
It says what are the MINIMUM specs REQUIRED to play. That is not recommended, it's what can you play this game with even if it looks like shit.

Meme is incorrect. It's not Nemesis + Play With Your Food.
---
Nothing says "I hardly ever win" like "gg ez".
---
I know I know it most likely won’t be, but like Kelly if I say I want it enough the devs will give it to me.
---
I would highly recommend you to watch good killer players on youtube and twitch, that is probably the best way to learn the game, apart from playing yourself.
---
OhTofu, Scottjund (DamnNoHTML on youtube), Otzdarva are good channels to start with. They have loads of educational content on youtube/twitch and watching them play will also help you.
---
You can also watch Zubatlel, but he doesn’t talk as much as the other 3 when he plays. He is probably among the best killers in this game though, so definetly worth a watch.
---
It's not really the challenge's fault some people will go out of their way to spite you.
---
sighs... gimmie 5 minutes \*UNZIPS
---
Imagine not knowing Huntress hatchets exist.
---
I had the most satisfying moment the other day, I’m a rank seventeen baby spirit and bbq refuses to show up on my bloodweb so I run rancor and I was going against a team of rank tens and the obsession was teabagging inside the exit gates waiting for me to hit him before he left so I morid him. Even though the three other people escaped it was worth it for that.
---
Of they can come up with an interesting power for him sure.
---
No
---
Tbvh just do what all killer mains do 
---
“The killer I’m playing is weak.”
---
“Who are you?” 
---
“Tunnelling is a legit strat.”
---
“I didn’t tunnel you, I only tunnelled that other guy.”
---
It’s why I don’t play survivor anymore
---
I dont think Oni has exposed?  Its just an alt attack like billy
---
&gt; G E T G U D
---
Yes because it's entirely up to the player's skill level if a survivor decided to be a bitch and DC.
---
I'm certainly seeing the fruits of your labor, looking forward to more good work from you!
---
well...how does it look on a newer phone?
---
Hag’s problem is the fact that SWF neutralises a lot of her strengths.
---
She has insane map pressure when she sets up but she also needs to constantly replace her traps to keep this pressure. That’s where SWF come in, they can disable her traps much quicker because they can constantly exchange information on Hag’s location and traps. This removes the surprise factor and makes it much more safer for survivors.
---
Hag is still a very strong killer, probably top 5. However she definetly isn’t S tier, unlike a Nurse or Spirit, sometimes there really isn’t much she can do due to circumstances.
---
Its fair on myers since it takes a while.
---
Its complete bullshit on GF sunce it takes about 5 seconds and you cant reveal him because its so badly coded and he has zero terror radius the entire time
---
You're mistaken here, The survivor was present as she already agreed to farm, She seen my refusal to farm and the down. The killer rightfully went to down and hook me but before I could suicide the idiot random pulls me off right in his face to which he is technically forced to down me again so i can kill myself, Then i'm rehooked and the fucker does it again immediately. If the killer wants to farm you are rarely saved by an unknowing random as they tend to group up first in place of randomly hooking people, Someone has to unhook to make the farm viable after all
---
Myers also doesn’t lose his power
---
The amount of attention to detail is actually unreal
---
Same, I play red ranks as killer and survivor. It just baffles my mind that a lesser killer as legion loses his power when stunned(which only injures them) but a better killer such as oni can run faster and down survivors in one hit. I feel like there’s different dev teams working every 3 months
---
Nah this is literally a decision decided by the killer not you. You accepted the outcome. Also to be “working” with the killer you would have to show them where your teammates are etc. 
---
It’s just a salty butthurt person that needs to do something else then play games and get overly mad and dramatic about things.
---
The map when I down someone in a corner on Grim Pantry
---
Whatever you want to run but run Corrupt Intervention.
---
Sadly, you'd be playing Clown.
---
Thicc boy really needs some buffs.
---
I think Otz is just making fun use of the perks by putting them to good use. Obviously there are better perks but he's just having fun with them
---
If they did Nemesis, which would be more appropriate because of the RE3 remake, he could just have a rocket launcher.
---
\-Corporate needs you to find the difference between this picture and this picture  
---
\-They're the same picture
---
She also said that I “left her friend on the hook to die” because I left her on the hook right next to the last gen because I wanted to get some progress on the gen before alerting the killer by unhooking, could this count as “evidence” to prove that we were working together?
---
Keys should stay moris should just be nerfed slightly, if removing keys I’d say remove hatch completely and make it so the killer has to force open a door to cause the end game collapse
---
Nah u good bro, got killers mercy and a salty survivor
---
What do you mean? I don’t think the plague existed in 2016...
---
You can still power through them with a toolbox and only one person on the gen. It’s just a matter of patience.
---
Ruin is a pretty dick perk when used at rank 15 tho. I started a new account to play with my family and it’s some bullshit to go against Rank 17 killers using all Very Rare best in class perks. There needs to be a way to meter these depending on rank.
---
If the devs remove keys, then remove the hatch completely
---
Okay but imagine Tomie as a killer
---
I had this happen I’m in one of my games as Trapper. A friendly Claudette helped me out - it was hilarious.
---
Yeah, forgot that the context of this thread was perks only and not abilities too when editing in Iron Maiden.
---
Fortnite/Dbd skin collab when? Trapper with a gun
---
He died inside as soon as you cleansed the totem in front of him
---
Don't fucking play the shack game for over a minute straight is a good start.
---
I dont get the hate for ds3. I loved it.
---
Naw that just means you aren’t supportive of your team or played poorly or you where just trying to survive yourself because you knew the chances of survival is smaller if you try to rescue. 
---
Or lastly you assumed the nea would get the person. 
---
I don’t know how the whole game went so I can’t say whether I agree or disagree with your decision to let the person die. 
---
But I still don’t think that’s a good enough reason to say you where working with the killer.
---
I checked and it looks like 11 year olds by their grammar
---
It wasn't a bad game it just wasn't a horror game it was too action focused and the stupid pay to win micro transactions didnt help.
---
Pfft, I love people who can make salty players feel so disappointed just by not stooping to their level. GG David!
---
It should he this post was made by league of legions
---
I was gonna get her friend before struggle phase, I just wanted to get a little bit of the gen done before giving the huntress a notification by unhooking (the hook was right near the gen) and the rest of the match was pretty standard I wasn’t pointing out where people were or farming people off hook
---
There was like 3 things to buy and a dlc... it was an awesome horror co op game.
---
No one gets banned on this game.
---
That’s how you destroy them lol.
---
I’d love to see the incorporation of even just a bit of mythology in this game.
---
Exactly so I think the person is over dramatic. You done nothing wrong in my book sir and maybe you over judge when to rescue her and failed or maybe you got so into doing skillchecks it was too late to rescue her.
---
I laughed at this harder than I should have. Hopefully the Trapper had a good sense of humour.
---
For stating the truth? Lmfao, alright then. You sound salty. Have a nice day yourself.
---
r/croppingishard
---
To counter, I think Noed should be a base part of the game.
---
That way you can choose to just do gens and risk trying to escape while exposed, or take the time during the match to cleanse totems.
---
To balance this, I think that there should be a totem counter below the gen counter (and remove the speedboost Noed gives).
---
This would act as a secondary, optional objective which could potentially extend the length of matches, without the need to increase gen repair time.
---
This Is beautiful
---
Mehh good luck the market is filled at this point
---
He has to earn his power by hitting a survivor, picking up stops his power and you want him to lose it when stunned ? How high are you ?
---
*winks*
---
this is art
---
STBFL is amazing on hag, if a survivor runs into your web you can hit them with one trap then by the time they reach your other one immediately teleport and down them faster than a nurse because of the reduced cooldown.
---
Why? That was a good move on your part.
---
Not as survivor, no. The Devs, and everyone in the community that's played killer, know that killers need to listen out for survivors movements. This takes a little bit of skill and practise, or it did back before the audio big that forces a killers chase music to mute survivors movement sounds. To make the game fair, the Devs would have to impliment a UI tool that indicates when/where a survivor is making noise in a manner similar to killers that just use a good headset/soundcard. 
---
But the Devs hate killer. As far as I'm aware, they haven't even issued a statement about the sound bug, but killers could just turn on deaf mode to get the information they should already have but the Devs, for some insane reason, don't want them to have. So they would either not impliment this feature (thus removing deaf-modes point entirely and basically making killer impossible to play as a deaf individual) or use it as an excuse to not impliment deaf-killer at all.
---
No, legacy was only available in 2016
---
Yknow that bug where you can get trapped on a tree and have to wait for the killer to knock you and pick you up? I had a video of that with a title that was something along the lines of "not sure if lag or a bug"
---
It got removed for "posting about a well known bug" (before I had seen anything on it anywhere). So I messaged the mod saying "wait, so this is a bug?" and their response was basically
---
"we're not BHVR, we are not the people to contact for bug fixes" for some reason.
---
Anyway, about a month later someone else posted a video of the bug asking what was happening and it made it to the front page instead of being removed.
---
I hate being on the cusp of red rank. The community survivor side just changes..... from "up for fun" to "I died first but the loss is your fault..."
---
I was thinking that since it was a recent release, that was a reward for the people who’d reached rank 1. I was hoping they did this with the mobile port too.
---
I’ve gotten a game where I quickly sacrificed 2 survivors then just messaged the other two and let them do their challenges in return for the sacrifices
---
Thanks everyone for replying :)
---
Otz not only likes the perk, but it feels like every video he puts out is him just like "ok now i'm using this perk on THIS killer, check out how HOAHSGOASHG IT'S WORKING SO WELL LOOK AT THIS AAAAH"
---
Never, but this game is really easy
---
Aight, thanks =)
---
The amount of iridescent shards you get per amount of time stays the same though. It takes longer to level up at higher levels but you are rewarded more shards than at lower levels, and vice-versa.
---
when it takes that fucking long to get the power and it is not even as close to OP as vommy momma I say no
---
get baited my mom isnt dead B) also im not a dude B)
---
Kinda like how if you had no information or knowledge about it, the Jews probably deserved the Holocaust right?
---
Old Freddy used to lessen skill Check chance?
---
S C O O B E R T D O O B E R T E D
---
Sadly, not much can be done against DCs
---
Survivors should be able to cause 80's stuns aswell. I feel like the game is heavily killer sided.
---
I would love to see the full match if you have it.
---
i remember when tinkerer was reworked and i thought it was actually p good, but now it just sucks LMAO.
---
nemesis is so much better
---
“Earn his power”. Hmm hitting a survivor isn’t really earning it since you’re always guaranteed to hit survivors in the match and can easily get his power within one chase.
---
Not really no.
---
Hag main here
---
She can’t be S tier
---
There’s a counterplay to her that isn’t hard to execute, that turns her into a 110 speed M1 killer
---
When you play her, it’s a cointoss. You either land on survivors who know what to do, or not.
---
Hag places traps on loops. The correct way to play against her is to leave the loop and run to the next one, and then have a second survivor run and trigger the traps
---
If Hag teleports, she won’t get a hit, will place another trap and now the first survivor will be the one triggering traps. Hag loses
---
If Hag ignores, the survivor will run back to the previous loop. Hag loses
---
You have to stop using your power and chase normally at this point. Hag also loses, but gets some hits
---
community: we want Trapper changes!
---
bhvr: the Trapper is getting nerfed, now crows can activate his traps so he needs to reset them
---
I run resilience and find that it is worth it if it’s matched with the right build, I recommend an injured build like iron will and dead hard and whatever else you’d like, but resilience helps with pushing out that last gen then getting the exit gate open faster, it’s saved me countless times. As for spine chill, I personally don’t run it but i know it does stack with resilience for vault speed and I could see it being useful being paired with resilience
---
Nice sarcasm, I think the game is fine the way it is. Each side is a bit stronger than the other in certain areas and that’s ok. But if we remove keys hatch should just be removed completely unless if you can prove to me a 100% accurate with no flaws reason to keep the hatch. Because without keys it heavily favors killers
---
Funny bug but it's fixed from closing bloodweb and opening it again.
---
Why am I cryin' in da club rn?
---
Yeah I really try to avoid engaging in these types of posts where they're trying to buff a perk because 90% of the time it's a perk in no need of further buffs or the buff proposed is ludicrous or overpowered but this one just strikes me as a common sense little change that wouldn't have any adverse effects but would encourage people to consider using the perk which gets punked pretty hard for being kinda meh.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
This is what we call “heartbreaking”
---
&gt;!any1 that downvotes has no class!&lt;
---
Whenever rank reset happens and I end up between 20-15 I usually take off ruin just because it’s such a dick perk to new players
---
I agree. The hatch allows me to flex super hard on shitty facecamper cunts. My ego would be devestated if the hatch was removed. The playerbase would die if the hatch was removed.
---
Banana Hammock Ash common BHVR ITS EASY MONEY
---
Yes, it was meant to help keep survivors in the dream world. Old Freddy had to manually put people to sleep before he could injure them, so once you got them to sleep you didn’t want survivors to hop on a gen or self-heal, instantly fail a skill check, then wake up. However, using these add-ons with Ruin active makes no sense, since the entire point of Ruin is to force survivors to hit great skill checks or risk constantly reducing gen progression. 
---
That poor Freddy just wasted his add-ons.
---
Yeah, Corrupt is only good on certain killers against certain types of survivor players, pop mostly forces you to give up on a chase (still a good perk, it just backfires massively a lot of the time) and we have reached the end of viable gen-slow perks since good survivors aren't affected by any others.
---
I wouldn’t say plague is too tier but she is very unique and fun to play and I would definitely recommend her
---
On that note I don’t know of a single person I play the game with that runs bbq for the aura besides huntress mains.
---
Why fucking wouldnt you? Its so fucking boring, and unfair.
---
there is no point in playing against it, im fucking 100% sure everyone who downvoted me DCs on haddonfield.
---
This sub seems to love Otz, so why do they ignore the fact that even he says IRI heads are studiedly OP?
---
Or have time to make up an imaginary SO
---
Title should have ended with: Oh you know how it goes
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
That is very easy to multi task tho.
---
Every killer (other than the base few) has their own music already. It is bugged in most patches tho
---
obviously no. I think he cried a lot
---
Sure, when we get the flick back so he's actually a good killer again I wouldn't mind if getting stunned deactivated his power.
---
* Submissions not directly related to Dead by Daylight.
---
Stbfl buys you time and punish greedy survivors for bold plays that udually would fuck you up, im all ears can help killers to make the right guess while mindgame. None of them buys you the game, but they have utilities and are fun to use, unlike the same boring meta. Also, bad killers will lose no mater the perk, decent killers will lose no mater the perk, good killers will lose no matter the perk because its all up to survivors dude. Stop with this shit and let people use what they want
---
I was really bad too...they just happened to be really really awful at hiding and dodging my hag acrylics.
---
Why the fuck is this getting downvoted ?
---
Especially when the exact same comment is upvoted elsewhere on this comment section. At least make up your mind about it, people.
---
I like a man that can compromise
---
I’ll go with Scott Jund and say that maybe they should only insta down past her terror radius. Rewards good play.
---
But yet, it’s only survivor players who are ToXiC
---
That’s a special breed of stupidity
---
Kirsty would be a lovely survivor and Ashley is lovely so would prolly provide her likeness.
---
Plus you could go so many ways with hellraiser. Which cenobite do you choose or do you go Julia/skinless Julia?
---
Julia always seemed scarier to me than pinhead. 👍
---
Every time Otz hits a survivor while I'm All Ears is activated
---
"I'm all ears baby! And this is why you use the perk. Really really helps."
---
I mean it’s what I’d do tbh
---
Makes it even better
---
It physically hurt me when he didn’t
---
Personally I used better together instead of sprint burst. Was able to do it against a tunneling trapped luckily
---
Maybe it’s itchy
---
Bro I haven’t been on in a few months I just wanna rank back up  :(
---
[u/vredditdownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/vredditdownloader/)
---
Congrats! Who'd you win as?
---
Bond- to see others working on gens. Don’t start one yourself
---
Prove Thyself- to spend as little time on the gen as possible and make sure you get enough time to get to the next person working on a gen
---
Better Together- to light the gen up for others to come and join
---
And ofc, Dark Sense because it’s needed
---
Hope you don’t get found
---
I did all 5 gens first try on red-ranks with that build

But the hatchet hits. Vommy mommy's vommy splashes.

---
Yeah ps4 has a ton of players.
---
Yep, I can vouch that EU PS4 is super active and hear the rest of the servers are too :)
---
The hatchet hits but huntress doesn't.
---
maybe, but that might be exploitable with Monitor, Nemesis, Tinkerer, ect
---
Overall i don't know what bhvr was thinking when they made that challenge. Killers hate doing it and survs hate playing against killers doing it. Not fun for anyone
---
/u/Kitbashd
---
Yes, quite a lot. Only thing (at least for me) takes like 3 minutes to find a lobby
---
Try to force a 3 gens situation and don't worry about the first two gens being popped.
---
After you hooked a survivor, if you get in a chase, you will have 2 survivors not doing gens, which is huge! The others survivors might be doing gens or going for the rescues, but you theoretically halved their repairing speed by half.
---
Keep chasing and make survivors waste pallets in your chosen 3 gens area and don't hesitate to drop chase to make survivors fuck off generators. Time will always play in your favor if you know how to manage it!
---
I'm a beginner at killer, but ever since I tried forcing 3 gens all the time, I usually get a 3k/4k every match without having Ruin yet. (thank god for PGTW though LOL)
---
It isn’t meant to be used liberally they said in the latest livestream it should feel like using an ult in league of legends. You can shock and not have to change stances to hit someone so his looping capabilities are no vastly stronger. Calling it now doctor will be A tier upon first rework release.
---
"It's all up to the survivors"
---
Ahahahahahaha bitch, what? You're one of those whiny little fucks permanently stuck in yellow ranks still tunneling unhooks because you can't figure out a better way of playing the game then crying about how anti tunnel perks are "over powered" aren't you? 
---
How about instead of obsessing over people who actually play the game, you take that time to play the game yourself and actually get good. These people that you obsess over didn't get good over night or by watching everyone else play the game. They put the time in do be decent at the game. This game has never been more killer sided than it has now. Even the new maps all have unsafe pallets and not a single safe loop in them. It's all in favor of you cry baby bitches that just can't get good.
---
Ah yes maybe just a hard 20 meters or so then. Didn’t think of that
---
Has a lot of players, especially since the game was free on ps+ a while ago
---
I do think it would be cool for there to just be an extra lit totem every match, not with an actual effect, just to have an extra lit to help draw attention away when you run hexxes.

I've used it in a chase plenty of times, you just need to use Quick and Quiet and make sure you run slightly past the locker before quick jumping in. They'll look for you outside of it with usually plenty of time to pull off the stun, and this is at red ranks. It only works around corners though, you can't let them see you do it.

Dark sense, obviously. Bond, better together, and prove thyself. If you get a small map don’t bother. Wait for a killer that’s not a stealth killer that also doesn’t have fast travel capabilities. Gas heaven with trapper is what I was able to complete it on. Maps help as well. Put some range addons.
---
I only like keys when using plunderers because it’s rng to find it and you still need the hatch to spawn. I’ve been running plunderers for about two days now and only escaped twice via hatch
---
But found many keys
---
I also use it to find flashlights so I can do the blind challenges without wasting a flashlight
---
Speedo Quentin is literally canon give it to me bhvr
---
The Hag. I just got the game yesterday but I like her design and her ability is pretty cool if not a bit op. I wouldn’t know though since I’ve only tried her and the huntress.
---
Edit: thought The Hag was called the witch.
---
The screen looks so crowded
---
Fax. I had a bubba with insidious just standing in a corner of the basement after he hooked the first person down there
---
Damm thought so too, its way to grindy in my opinion..
---
Idk bro. If I cant escape every single trial, then I am having absolutely NO FUN!!! Killers are already buffed in every single patch! I feel like the hatch should always be visible, that way I always know where I can use my keys.
---
Makes it sound like a trap remix of the match end song.
---
Yea it is but look at Myers in the background
---
Im not really wrong about it though. If you played the game as killer, you would know that a good swf team will work on gens separately and will get gens done even if you split pressure since they aren't really in a spot where you can put pressure on everyone. They actively avoid that. Maybe you should just be a better survivor and stop complaining about people who just want to have fun or learn about the game using videos of people like otz or tru3 or noob3
---
Console doesn’t have dedicated servers, killer is always host on console. I’d reinstall and maybe check your router.
---
why would you play this game on mobile?
---
Don’t have a console/pc :/
---
Pipping is always on you, escaping is not.
---
LMAOO this picture perfectly describes how it feels.
---
Was it on swamp? I saw somebody post that happen from the Claudette’s POV iirc.
---
Ik I agree it’s fuckin hilarious I die whenever I come across one of these but it also breaks my heart a lil bit every time too cause it makes trapper mains not want to play dbd; I’m not one of them but that’s the way I’d see it tbh. Hope it gets fixed soon is all I’m saying ig I’m all about a balanced dbd on both sides.

He lets all his 9 year old fans go to his head making him think he is way better then he really is. He is mediocre at best he is toxic to his chat and will ban anyone for even the smallest criticism and take their money for a build only to shit on it the whole time
---
Literally this so many times I've been in a chase then my controller gives out on me
---
I think someone printed it out on a shirt
---
Because the shrine of secrets doesn't exist? Got it.
---
And if you're gonna say "ThE gAmE hAs A bAtTlEpAsS", at least with this one, when you spend your money you can earn it all back instead of losing money each time it's a thing. And it doesn't have some stupid 5000% xp boost tied to it making you feel forced into using it for efficiency.
---
It just feels unfair for the game to just end. It’s about as crazy as the snitch from Harry Potter, it might make a good story once or twice, but it makes the game worse if it’s a real game meant to be played a ton. Sorry if I bummed out ur meme, but at least I can speak to its quality
---
You dont have 2, You can buy "champs" from the in game store with a pretty easy amount of in game currency you get.
---
you can also get their perks from the shrine with the same currency if the perks are in the shrine that week.
---
Crackbilly can curve pretty well. You can catch survivors around the long points of loops easily.
---
In my eyes I play from both sides and I think it just matters on the context of the situation; pallet stun and a teabag- that’s toxic. Also if I choose to let them farm or play surv and am farming I always see teabagging out of gratitude for not hooking an such. I think a teabag when you clearly could’ve demolished them and give them hatch is also a little thx too, I do this as well when I’m given hatch.

Does buying the game on xbox mean you can play it on windows? because if not then I don't see why dlc would work the same way

Not only can all non-licensed character be earned for free, but the Shrine of Secrets updates every week with teachable perks you buy for free in game currency. There are a lot of things you can criticize about this game’s design, but this really ain’t one of em chief
---
No because Xbox has special edition and Windows has normal edition only
---
I teabag once/twice as a thank you and I teabag violently when it’s a toxic killer. I don’t like being toxic so it’s usually only the thank you, sometimes an item drop instead. When I’m playing killer, an item drop is thanks as well as the one teabag
---
Or how I'm a green rank who gets matched with red spirits and god nurces. Yeah no
---
I used to run pharmacy with plunderer’s and ace hole. Problem is if you want to survive you gotta run decisive or adrenaline. I mean. You can play hide and seek too if you want to but if you’re looping then you’re generally screwed.
---
Good survivors aren’t really hurt by ruin that much either due to the small difference in great ruin skill checks vs normal great skill checks. Pop is pretty good on certain killers like Freddy who can reach the gen instantly and kick it or Spirit who is probably going to win the chase in a relatively short amount of time regardless of whether or not she pops the gen.
---
Everyone is pulling their Dwelf off the Shelf, but my Feng has Bangs.
---
The Witch?
---
okay but i agree with the Ghost Face reveal mechanism, it's absolute garbage, i'm literally staring at this dude trying to see how it works, the distance, the angle, etc and his "charge" for stalking a player still carries over after the exposed. 
---
like i get he's supposed to be a mix of michelle millers and oink moo, but the reveal shit needs to be patched.
---
Oh yeah, the hag oof. I’m not good with memorizing names.
---
The Hag. I’m not good with names, my bad.
---
I was capped out without spending money a week before the last page of the Tome came out.
---
DBD would be a lot more fun as survivor if it was first person. Or at least actually scary.
---
Imagine being this angry over a streamers opinion lol.
---
That clears things up
---
If I'm going to dc I'm going to dc regardless of shit, players dc for a reason
---
Thank you! :)
---
Maybe I'll finally get a reticle!
---
He’ll figure it out...
---
In a way yes, but I question how stable they will be without proper testing. I know they are doing testing on PC extensively but once live on consoles it’ll bring a big chunk of more players and could cause a lot of issues. I know it’s impossible but wish they could find a way to test things on console too. But once it is live and going I look forward to it, lots of issues here and there that “could” be solved by dedicated servers.
---
the build for ghostface is absolute trash, if i stare at him and he still is able to overpower that, i disconnect everytime.
---
My guess is in about 5 months instead of 3 because they’re focusing on bugs next and [spoilers] the killer and survivor mentioned in the first 2 revelations
---
Dont be part of the reddit hive mind. Im sure some of you high ranked survivors have ran into me playing clown plague etc to great success. Just because they play a different way doesnt mean they play badly. A little bit of brain power with clowns power means any chase is almost always yours , you just gotta have good prediction skills and admittedly HIGH game sense and awareness .
---
I disagree, I love Lithe but its a pretty awful perk. Hitboxes nowadays are so bad that you get hit from the other end of the window making Lithe pretty pointless.
---
Sprint burst can be put on 99 so you can use it whenever or just use it when you vault a window for the exact same effect of Lithe.
---
Old DS was actually better for killers than the current version since you could hook dribble to avoid it entirely. Now you either slug and risk Unbreakable or just eat it. Even worse if they jump in a locker to force you to sit there to wait it out, leave, or just eat it.
---
It's basically a 60 second Divine Shield when you get unhooked. [Me when I use it in solo queue.](https://youtu.be/3H5aTB1EVlM)
---
I’m no god at dbd, nor is anyone I think we all have our own unique play styles but let me give you some advice from what I’ve seen from your clip.
---
1. Collision- you run into things a lot making you lose time in a chase preventing you from escaping them in the first place. My tip here is to look just more in-front of you instead of behind because you don’t seem to know the maps really well.
---
2. Resources- I saw you multiple times run away from pallets or towards the edge of the map (where there is literally never anything besides sometimes on backwater swamp). You need to focus on using loops and pallets as a tool to your advantage because it’s the only thing you have as a survivor.
---
3. Your Perks- this is more of a biased opinion but your build seems kinda idk... weird. idrk what you’re going for but I don’t see you using any of your perks in the video to help with your gameplay; and that’s what they’re there for- to help you do better in game, or to have a specific purpose that helps you or you prefer it’s all subjective but nonetheless I didn’t see you use your perks like once if I’m not mistaken, maybe work on that a little bit.
---
4. Reading Situations- the biggest downfall I saw here which kind of ties back to my 1st point but you need to look where you’re going, read where he’s going, and move from there- not just run away and 360 and hope he doesn’t hit you.
---
I’m not trying to berate you on how to be good or anything just from what you showed- this is my advice because you asked for it, hope it helps.
---
I prefer killers like Freddy and the oni over killers like the nurse and huntress anyways but I do know when people are good at them it’s hard as hell playing against but kinda worth it when you do
---
The chat seems nice
---
Id love to play as mr. x
---
i know something u could have easily called 'gay for myers'
---
You’re on welfare
---
I’m talking killer. Survivors get more salty and give more content.
---
I’m Doctor.
---
I run Stake Out because I'm bad at hitting the Hex Skill Checks.
---
Its a multitude of things that would need to change. I heard someone else say that they should remove great skill checks on gens, my own suggestion would be to make kicking Gens have a built in Pop effect but have it only 5%. Or make generators constantly regress at half their normal regression speed at all times when they’re not worked on. Or all of the above, who knows.

---
god I love this community, so approachable and friendly
---
Yeah pallet and blinding teabagging totally toxic.
---
I usually just leave or do the follow me as a thanks rather than teabag at the exit.
---
This is obvious, but try to avoid them. Unless you enjoy distracting the killer, just always be doing something. Personally, I'm a gen jockey. It's much more useful to be on gens than it is to be running around. Genrushing is slightly toxic, but that's the point of the game. If the killer ends up near you, hide. I use Fixated, one of Nancy's perks. It's saved me from more chases than I can count, and gotten me out of even more, simply by being able to walk a little faster. If neither of the things I said work, look around for loopable objects, re: pallets and windows. Run the killer around as long as possible. Don't drop pallets as soon as you get to them. If possible, loop until you get hit the first time, then do another circle around, drop the pallet and run off.
---
It should also be noted, to get that speed, you need to tap as efficiently as possible which means waiting until the initial animation finishes before letting go and starting again, which ime is what people are failing to do when they claim to have proven that tapping is somehow slower than missing multiple ruin checks.
---
How about no. The whole baby dwight thing is just so stupid considering it literally only applies to dwight.
---
Shoot. That’s a bit harder. Run Monstrous, spies, the one that makes ur terror radius bigger (nobody would walk around a big radius), and any of demo’s perks
---
I don’t mind Oni but I truly hate Freddy games. The 60s sleep timer isn’t long enough because by the time you wake up and start something you’re asleep again. If it’s a forever Freddy you’re screwed unless you wanna spend 45 mins in a single game. His whole mechanics just suck for me personally and he is the only killer I NEVER have fun playing against. 
---
I don’t mind nurse and huntress because they take serious skill to master, so if I’m destroyed by either of those then gg because they’re difficult to learn.
---
So I'm not a wonderful chaser either, but theres some basics that I notice lacking in your montage. 
---
 The key to chases is distance. So you always want to maximize distance between you and the killer. A big way you can improve that is by running close to obstacles in loops. You want to run around corners tight, basically 90 degrees and the same with running around other obstacles. You dont want to take wide corners. It can be difficult to look at the killers and run close to an object but it will help the killer not catch up as fast.
---
Theres also general map awareness. You want to be aware of where pallets are and other loops. So when you're working on a gen and a killer appears you dont want to sprint to the edge of the map to hide. It's better to hide near a loop or pallet because the walls around the edge of the map are in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing to help you. If you want to hide behind them dont run to them (you leave scratch marks) and only do it when you know the killer doesnt know you're there and cant see you. The edge of the map is the last place you want to be in a chase.
---
Idk if that was helpful, but good luck. There are so many factors in being good at chases. I'm still trying to master them myself.
---
I personally agree with you. It being increased to 5 seconds and then not having that reduced when they changed enduring is a huge part of it.
---
Holy hell did not expect my dbd shitpost to get this much attention! Thank you, fellow reddit lurkers, for giving this guy with too much free time his first silver!
---
oh i get it, also i was talking about legion because i used the combo on him and didn’t benefit from it much. i will try it again thanks for your detailed responses
---
But on the other hand having cheesy load outs and making salty R1’s mad is better for content
---
I have insidious and noed on so far. Thinking of what the other extremely cheesy one. Have to get ruin for billy
---
Regardless of role if people aren't having fun and they'd rather be doing something else. They're going to dc. They aren't going to care about any punishment. Probably wouldn't want to jump into another game anyway
---
are you on console or pc?
---
For starters, survivors need a way to complete gens faster. Idk how many times ive spent 50-65 seconds on a gen. For this games health it needs to be reduced. I was thinking maybe 20-30 seconds per gen.
---
Flashlight blinds also need to be increased. The killer can recover waaay too fast.
---
Infinites need to be re-introduced. Killers have too many crutches like Noed and bamboozle. That is 100% unfair.
---
If a killerino is facecamping, you should get a free unhooked mixed with a built in borrowed tine to help get away. 
---
Speaking of which, ds, adrenaline and Borrowed should be built in to bsic survivor gameplay. They can give killers Monstrous shrine to help balance this.
---
After every game, survivors should get a free item. Id like to see an increase in pink key gameplay. My ego demands it.
---
Oh if it’s billy also use thrill of the hunt to dash over there:l. Nobody likes speedy boi to hex
---
Billy’s are always the most toxic. Gotta use him and alright I’ll remember that
---
Ok baby everyone
---
So pc then?
---
It was a reward for a prestige not for reaching rank 1 which they won't rerelease prestige as it was harder to go through the blood web back then and now with the blood market it's easier than the blood web. Going up in rank also isn't that hard if you play well as people have gotten to red ranks in about 2 weeks in mobile
---
They're cosmetics
---
I play Xbox.
---
:o hit me tf up
---
Maybe fix matchmaking then less people will sc due to getting placed with players outside of their skill level. Just a thought
---
Yikes, thanks for the information!
---
Counterpoint: Ruin trains you to get great skill checks, so it's ideal to face it over and over again early on.
---
I just want to pre-face by saying that even the best kiters can mess up on a chase or get caught out of position, happens to the best of us!
---
So, I watched maybe 20s of the video and saw that you messed up quite a bit. From the looks of it, you're still new and learning the game. That's okay! Everyone starts somewhere :-)
---
First and foremost; you knew that it was against the Hag, yet you ran around the hook area and set off a trap. Against Hag's, know that they will plant traps near the hooked person to quickly teleport back once the rescue happens. You have to take things slow when rescuing against Hag along with Trapper, the game can easily turn for the worst.
---
Second of all; you have Spine Chill, which is my favourite perk! However, you weren't using it to its full advantage. Spine Chill went off when you were at the hook, that should have been a clear indication of 'I have to get out of here', but you ended up running straight to the hook and setting off traps. Spine Chill is meant to prevent a chase from occurring altogether, or give you a head start on the chase. Be wary of when it pops and your surroundings.
---
Third; the way you try to escape a situation requires work. You got hit by the Hag and you immediately ran along the walls of the map, which is a bad idea. You always want to run to an area that has pallets or windows or both. Edge of the maps contain neither [minus Z-Walls]. Also, you haven't truly learned how to run and look backwards. When you look backwards, it should be a QUICK glance to let you know which way the killer is going or in what rotation is the killer going for a looping area. Other than that, you rely on Spine Chill to let you know if the killer is chasing you or not. In the video, you looked behind you for too long and ran into a wall after the hit. Remember, quick glance and you're off to a new looping area. After that, it's about keeping track of where the killer is going.
---
Finally; you're not thinking ahead, you're reacting to the moment. This is in response to the Oni clip later into the video where he spots you behind a rock and hits you, and you run into a wall because you fumbled around with going left or right. This is the number one way people get stuck at a particular rank or skill level, they fail to plan ahead. In every scenario and in every moment, you ALWAYS have to be thinking 'where can I go if the killer sees me? If I get hit? If my Spine Chill goes off? Where am I going?' You need to be asking yourself this all the time and you need to be planning accordingly. The more you do this, the more natural it becomes.
---
Best of luck in your DBD journey :-)
