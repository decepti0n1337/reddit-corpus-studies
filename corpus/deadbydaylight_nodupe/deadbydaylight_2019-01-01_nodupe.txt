Uh what? Lul ok xD

---
---
I’ve noticed this to, I’m not killing much but I’m somehow rank one with him. 
---
&gt;You rarely pip while camping but anyway that LF is probably camping to derank or simply be toxic. 
---

---
You admit that it is toxic, and no they camp because they learned it can work.
---
&gt;They get free points for no effort so how is their experience ruined? Yes they will lose points on benevolent but they will get all other emblems maxed.
---
They can get at most 8k points from doing gens and 5 k points from escaping. Not only is doing only gens boring, but after getting 8k from the gens they arent getting points unless they escape. If killer was camping they could be getting boldness, objective, survival, and cooperative points for the same amount of time that game is going on. Youll lose points on benevolent.....and you won't gain points in the evader category. "All other emblems will be maxed" is just wrong.
---
&gt;Most killers camp because they are annoyed at the certain survivor or need a kill so losing points is a bad thing and the minority of killers who camp with no reason are the ones who benefit from this. 
---
See that's a problem. Killers shouldn't be able to camp someone because they're just annoyed, at that point it isnt much of a strategy and it's more of a "you annoy me so I'll annoy you" and camping is often justified with excuses like "you used ds" or "you flashlight saved someone". They lose points towards pips, not bp. And again, PIPPING IS USELESS. People who camp "for no reason" often camp to troll, that shouldn't be a thing.
---
&gt;Yes it can be used to troll but that doesn’t mean it’s not a strategy. 
---
In my opinion, if a strategy can be considered trolling by more than a few salty individuals then it shouldn't be a strategy/it shouldn't work. That's a problem that needs to be addressed
---

I actually had an idea for a killer to disguise themselves as a survivor and screw up progress when the killer worked on a gen and could turn invisible so they have something to fall back on though my version was a futuristic scifi slasher villain and when they decloaked they would make a sound like how when a predator decloaks but your version sounds good too.
---
As for the invisibility my version would only be able to cloak for around 30 seconds and would have a cool down time so wraith wouldn’t be completely outclassed.
---
R1 killer games are like 25+ minute queues unfortunately sometimes
---
I was hard-stuck rank 8 and 9 maiming Nurse. I’m not the best at Nurse, but I’m decent.
---
Once I learned how to properly play Legion, I hit rank 7 with two games giving me two pips. I didn’t sweat as much as I did with Nurse either
---
oof seeing you getting hate is depressing.. I'm sure you've put a lot of effort into it so fuck these guys, send me the link when you do it mate!
---
For the disguised killer working on a gen it would reverse progress and make it take longer to complete it and if survivors try to do a gen while the killer is working on it it speeds up the sabotage progress and they wouldn’t know same applies for healing survivors as well plus he disguise totem thing as well

None but if I had to pick it's gotta be Feng.

The toxic part is that its exploiting how the chase system works
---
1. [Ya know, be more careful. ](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/video-gamer-hunts-stabs-man-killed-online-counter-strike-character-article-1.447608) 
---
2. I know you're going to whip out some crazy response about how you're super protected, but incase you aren't..
---
3. Facebook is a good start to find someone
---
4. Some games share your IP with others, steam even used to do this.
---
5. IP triangulation is a thing, while they won't find your house, they might find your neighbourhood.
---
6. Friends are stupid, they can track your friends and ask for your address from there.
---
7. They can arrange to meet your parents.
---
8. Somewhere your job may have imprinted you online.
---
9. Old data of common usernames used may have your real name or age or something to work with like when you were 10.
---
I can keep going but it's starting to feel like a tutorial on how to find people. Either way doxing is real and becareful with what you wish for. Happy new year! 
---
one person having fun &lt; four people having fun
---
Oh well in that case he’s a dummy though a case could still be made if the survivors were still all trying to unhook them instead of doing gens in that case it was smart to do
---
Even better: change terror radius music for the USSR national anthem
---
You heard them wrong, they said optimization PASS
---
Not the worst idea, I just feel like the invisbility shouldn't be there.  
---
I might be biased, but I'd put more into the disguising like my concept did.  
---
Honestly I'd just go full on Predator with that concept, take it as you will.  
---
What you could do as well, is replace the disguise for something else and just make it full on Predator.  
---
Like maybe Predator has an ability where there is footsteps instead of scratch marks, and you can press M2 to sniff them which reveals a survivors aura for .5 seconds, but the footsteps aren't always there, etc.   
---
Go ape though! Tell me if you ever finish your concept. :)
---
Woah! What a pro!
---
It should be personal, mention those that are close to you
---
Ooh maybe, but I didn't think it was fair that the killer couldn't negate progress, so I made it an illusion type thing.  
---
I left out things like sabotage because I didn't know what to do with it, and the healing could be interesting.  
---
Maybe when you are disguised and heal the person with another survivor, the skill check chance increases with harder skillchecks?
---
I stopped paying because fuck the devs. Said “console optimization coming in December” then denied ever saying it, then when the community called them out for it they said we all misheard (a fucking written word) and they said “optimization PASS not patch.” They’re probably one of my least favorite game devs now, blatantly lying, denying it, then treating their consumers like idiots
---
I main two killers and 2 survivors. I have stuff in mind for them but just like to see what others might like as well.
---
What a god play. Bless that man
---
Being the best killer for pipping is very arguably a bad thing. High ranks generally have more toxic survivors as well as groups of swf, which is not something you want, especially if you aren't capable of reaching rank 1 without legion.
---
As for legion's BP generation, it is certainly consistent, but doctor's is as well, while being faster without penalties for sticking on one survivor. Huntress is also fairly fast for BP generation with the potential for a ton of sacrifice points, and just being generally fun, which can also be said for spirit. 
---
Being so good at farming is in legion's case one more problem that should be ironed out. I shouldn't be double pipping for tunneling one survivor to death over the course of a five minute game.
---
Happy new year dude, hope everyone has a good one!
---
Plus you don't know if someone has DS until you're actually in the game so you just have to guess and run a non-optimal perk. 
---
And then you realize that the other gate already has been opened xD
---
lol yeah i definitely have to start buying the other killers for their perks
---
I see you were playing legion - there goes my sympathy
---
It should instead be if a survivor escapes your grasp with ds
---
lmaoo i feel like such a scrub with it, but at the same time it’s easy to use
---
I reported someone in steam who added me and wished me all of the above. 
---
Did we finally reach a generation that doesn't know what the good SpongeBob episodes are? So it begins... Soon, you will say "no I'm dirty Dan" and no one will know what your talking about

---
I really don’t know, i’ve never used add ons or offerings
---
Lmao, when did they added legacy Bubba
---
I don’t care what anyone else says, I actually enjoyed reading this.  
---
My goal with this event was to build addon inventory for the killers I use, so I’ve been doing great 
---
lmaoo that’s rough 
---
Ah a fellow Scott fan :) 
---
I think that the extra hit you've got in on an injured player far out ways  the 5% speed reduction from  normal killer speed
---
That or the huge amount of time they take to self care with sloppy
---
Obviously if you play against a good swf they can just not heal, gen rush and be out the door in bout 3 mins before you can kill more than 1 person but that'd be pretty hard to stop playing literally any killer 
---
The face you make when you have been in the game for a year and a half and still havent been buffed.
---
fair
---
It will be personal for every person, for me Hag, Nea and Dwight. If you ask for general themes, you can mention OP Nurse, Snipe Billy, Basement Bubba, Immersed Claudette, Killer Nea, Bottom Tier Freddy, DS Laurie, Flashlight Squads, Jumpscare Myers, Silent Wraith, God Pallet, Coldwind Farm Corn, etc.
---
As someone who plays both killer and survivor this is incredibly unfortunate.  I have been trying to ensure everyone gets the most points they can (e.g. I chase them and hook them twice, then smack them over and over if I can but not hook them) unless they're being an asshole.
---
Oh no i got gnomed
---
Winning a round with hexes? idk literally any round can go that way, especially if they brought valuable items or they're a 4-man.
---
Maybe have them crawl into hatch as well. Also while we at it, can we grab survivors from gates if we hit them and they are at the line so they could at least stop tbagging the exit 
---
thanks lol. I appreciate it
---
TREASON? Have you lost your mind, PlotShield?
---
That's right. But on bigger maps you have more meshes and usually more actors, so more calculations and more polys to draw, yet the performance is better than in this game.
---
But because its a crossover of 2 different film series' it's going to be directed differently to if it was a normal film like the rest of the aNoES films. It doesn't matter who directs them it's how they are directed.
---
Damn, not like Bloodwarden was already weak... its also easy to counter.
---
Sorry bro :(
---
Why Spies From the Shadows?
---
I think that would instead be a perk chief
---
The difference between Freddy Tier and Hillbilly Tier.
---
I wouldn't want a rework but I wish my boy Bubba could get some love. Like Billy just does everything better except for insidious meme camping.
---
Not quite. Nurse's lunge is a little bit shorter if it's right after a blink. Michael's lunge in EW3 is also longer than everyone else's.

When a killer does this to me, I struggle harder than possible, my controller made my hand bleed before but it was worth the toxic killers reaction. Done it three times now, tastes sweet.
---
Megs gonna Meg
---
I know I wouldn't let them go. I don't use a tombstone to let people go, I use it to kill eeeeeverything.
---
Thats probably why the expression is like that. OP triggered the OCD of the image with "your".
---
Someone said "seriously consider killing yourself" to me after I got a 4k as Clown. I didn't camp or tunnel, but I apparently made a friend nonetheless.
---
How do you know I’m a killer? 🤔
---
I approve of this. The game could do with an abandoned city or town map anyway.
---
Yeah, seeing a Survivor do this is almost my acknowledgement that they want special attention from me, as hag I'll use my teleport and mind game the hell out of them. I don't face camp unless they disrespect my terror radius and try cheeky stuff like running up to me. 
---
Yes
---
tfw decisive strike has more counters than legion
---
*Intense screeching
---
That is about the same thing, but I feel like there is something more obnoxious about fake pulling you off. It makes it so you can't even try and Kobe yourself if you wanted to.
---
If Kate would stand still right on that spot Freddy would be incapable of hitting her. This however is the end of being hit and thus Kate already moved futher into the room. Implying this would be the actual range makes for easy complaining about hitboxes though and free Karma on Reddit.
---
I like the style and how it’s pretty explicit like Gambino is, except some of the lines are just a wack amount of syllables and a lot of them don’t make too much sense for the flow of the song.

I like your effort though, and it looks like you can make pretty cool stuff.

I literally thought this most of the time. In SWF games we tried to put it in sort of a dance at the exit gate, thinking that it'll look funny. Now I think the killer must really hated us and considering toxic. So sorry. 
---
Please edit his intros

---
Not very funny.

---

---
That’s why they guard the basement chest; theres bubba legacy in there
---
Camping wins you tournaments so that's probably why he's doing it. 
---
If you find camping the last guy on the hook just because you want a single kill with three others alive and you think that's fun, I think you're lying. I'm fine with camping a toxic asshole, but camping some random guy for no reason while the exits are powered is something I personally find extremely unsatisfying and don't really understand why anybody would unless they want to be a sore loser.
---
&gt; Also any points the opposite team ends up losing isn't my problem , this is a competitive game with opposing goals. 
---
You also lose points as a killer by doing this, its a net loss for both sides was my point.
---
You shit talk Blood Warden, but when it happens.. ooh boi.
---
 the backstory of my killer is that they are an experiment that was done in the far future to serve as the perfect assassin of ITV the code name being 626 and they are treated as nothing more than a weapon for corporations and are never refured to with gender pronunciations so you can interpret the killers gender as you want.
---
They are eventually taken by the entity since time has no effect on the entity’s realm.
---
As for names I simply call it the assassin unless you have a better name.
---
As for perks the first one would be so that the longer the killer is in a chase the more speed survivors lose there are 3 stages that happen every 10 seconds.
---
At the third stage survivors can no longer sprint for speed vault ya an anti loop perk that some killers need.
---
For the second perk it works like this.
---
Every time you injure or down a survivor the auras of other survivors are revealed for 4 seconds if they are within a 32 meter range.
---
Still not sure about the 3rd perk
---
I used a splinter from Rin's bloodweb, the survs quitted the game in the loading screen, so... the game got confused and instead of setting the killer to Evan as usual it just stayed on Freddy :v
---
im not shit talking it, this happened to me in a game today and nearly fucked us over :P if the killer was anyone but freddy we would not have made it haha
---
My fps on low dropped from 45 to 30 rip
---
*sorry, just realised I have written “or” instead of “only” when talking about Kate’s guitar.  Sorry!
---
Believe this is a r/whoosh comment. 
---
Patrolling is smart when you have objectives secured and/or know there is a survivor nearby (e.g. you see scratch marks running to the hook). Facecamping (what the Leatherface in doing in this) is never smart because that means survivors will never go for the save, giving them free time to do gens. It’s also boring for every player, as Leatherface is sitting still for 2 minutes, the survivor on the hook it forced to sit immobile for 2 minutes, and the other 3 survivors are forced to sit still working on generators with no fear for 2 minutes
---
I don’t think making the predator is a good idea because they don’t use disguises they just turn invisible and there wouldn’t be many cosmetics
---
I feel its spread pretty equally and massively depends on what you consider toxic. 
---
probably he deserve the facecamp. or probably is just a killer with pudding who want to go home at least with one kill because he's a shitty killer ❤
---
M2
---
No, I mean, when people usually mention Blood Warden, they say that it's a weak perk or just garbage. But when a Killer has it, they usually know what they're doing and can single handedly turn the tide of the game with one good hook.
---
I agree and I add: you should do the same when somebody wishes you to "get cancer". A really terrible thing nobody should say for any reason, let alone because they lost at a game.
---
Infinite T3 too.

u/cdstout1106 I literally only play RL and DbD...... that’s weird haha. What platform?
---
Smacks you with a cleaver, the survivor drops pallet 
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury: allow us to introduce ourselves 
---
Nice.
---
My version is to make it so it takes additional progress by making the bar have negetive progress so it takes even longer to heal or do gens and yeah fair is not really an issue here since people like to loop a lot use ds and then there is swf 
---
I will often do a gen or totem right next to the hook before feeling it's safe to unhook, but if the heartbeat disappears and the killer is still heading away, just unhook and head the other direction...
---
cant really see certain things if i put it in the corner. it's good where it is
---
What were you missing 
---
The survivor falls unless they mend themselves 
---
Sprint  urst3 is Bad  Change my mind
---
I am [with Dunkey on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI). I do agree that it is wrong to shittalk and even moreso to be extra edgy about it with more heavy insults. But geez, reading stuff like "kys" is psychopathic? Come on.  
---
When someone actually tries to insult me in a krass way I try to avoid getting offended. Simply cause people who try that hard to be aggressive either have a very shitty day or a very shitty life. Like, have you guys ever truly engaged someone super toxic for a moment? After they lose their steam to "jump at your throat" with anger they almost break down in tears. Not always, but often enough.  
---
Sure, if they really do something fucked up that becomes a real threat like getting your IP or hunting for your adress... deal with it without mercy. But some edgy, hurt being trying to express his pain with extreme shittalk? Be kind, be mature. Fix the world not by by fighting fire with fire, but by being kind.  
---
One actually good teaching of christianity. To turn the other cheek.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I completely agree it’s in the right place, was just clarifying what the other commenter said (: 
---
That’s the thing though. I don’t tunnel as Legion. I try to stab everyone with frenzy (of course). Then I clean up. Kick some gens, break pallets, scare survivors, sometimes downing one or two. The amount of times you can enter a chase and max brutality is whack.
---
Once I hit a high rank, I’m not going to be concerned about losing pips when I play Legion, no matter who I go against. Heck, the last game I played, all four survivors lived and I still didn’t lose one. Feelsgoodman
---
About as long as his current ping
---
Candy 
---
Well, hello there.
---
Oh, I'm the whoosh victim o_o
---
Why did you stop, It was going down!
---
Is it considered face camping if they are walking around looking for survivors at the closer gens? Not necessarily in the survivors face but still close enough to see the survivor if u know what i mean
---
It's also sometimes just the matchmaking. I had a game once where I was Killer, and after the match one of the survivors sent me a message basically saying that I shouldn't be allowed to host as Killer because my internet was trash.
---
He lives in the UK. I live in Ontario Canada.
---
Fire up + surveillance makes the game literally unplayable, they need to nerf that shit

Where are the smaller patches?
---
I consider it camping, because they are looking for survivors who are close by to make sure the survivor on the hook doesn’t get rescued by them
---
that's called patrolling the hook, face camping is when you stand still in front of the hooked survivors while looking deep into there eyes
---
An all time classic
---
Why change your mind when you’re right?
---
It really doesn't matter how they're directed, bottom line is, it's the same character. You've gone off on a tangent about something entirely different than the matter at hand, as well. I'm done responding to you.
---
TDLR: a recap of everything that happened this year and a promise for an even bigger year in 2019. So basically just a regular PR statement.
---
Cause both make cute squeaks?
---
Why would he have an Ulster kit on tho? He's English
---
I guess to really figure out how much of a difference it makes I’d need to test out how much time it takes to loop a 110% movement speed killer vs a 115% movement speed killer. 
---
All right, here we go.
---
Nobody would use \*Take Me Instead\*, nobody likes being on the hook and I see it as a dead perk. \*From the Ashes\* encourages farming and unsafe hooks which is a thing nobody wants to happen. "See No Evil" is already present in \*Sole Survivor\* and \*Distortion\* so it's kinda redundant.
---
\*Nothing To Hide\* nailed it, no issues. \*Sunlight Rite\* great, but I'd remove the persist effect to not make it too strong. \*Foresight\* you're rewarding a killer for failing a chase, don't reward mediocrity.
---
\*Enlightened Eyesight\* realistically I think the game would crash if you did POV switches but we'll pretend it's stable, there is no counterplay once you get hit and it basically removes stealth entirely and on the other side it wouldn't help in chases nor help with map control.
---
Rework Thoughts.
---
\*Take Me Instead\* You gain an additional 30/40/50% bloodpoints for survival actions in a trial (cause survival points are ridiculous to get, rename it you if want). \*From The Ashes\* for every 4/3/2 safe unhooks, you can fully recover from the dying state 100% faster (rewarding safe play and counters slugging somewhat). \*See No Evil\* blindness status effect doesn't work for anything within 10/12/14 meters of your location.
---
\*Foresight\* When performing an action i.e. breaking or vaulting, all nearby windows and pallets are highlighted for 3/4/5 seconds (it'll help situational awareness and could help newer killers figure out loop routes faster).
---
\*Enlightened Eyesight\* I'd just scrap and maybe play into her lore so I propose: \*Cassandra's Zealotry\* hitting/downing/grabbing/hooking survivors all grant tokens maxing out at let's say 20, for every 5 tokens you go up a tier and the tier bonuses stack. Tier 1: 0-5 nothing yet so you're like a tier 1 Mikey, 2: 6-10 5% increased action speed, 3: 11-15 5% decreased successful attack cooldown, 4: maxed 20 tokens, 5% increased movement speed (carrying too). On the other side, if you get stunned or flashlighted you lose 1 token (I am counting DS). The gist is the more you do throughout the game, the stronger you get so at end game if you get max tokens then you are pretty strong and still have a chance to win. Also I noticed you don't have a weapon for her yet, up to you but since her story revolves around a pseudo cult you could do something like a whip or maybe a censer where it's a semi ranged attack that you'd have to wind up and could hit people over vaults and loops.
---
Ooh boy, that's a lotta typing but I enjoy reading fan chapters and offering suggestions.
---
That’s smart when the gens are close and within your line of sight
---
The crows are awesome 
---
Facecamping used to mean blocking the unhook prompt, which required standing right in front of the survivor, but now it's definition has been changed to "The killer is still on the map after hooking a survivor".
---
So to answer your question: Yes, that is facecamping.
---
Latest Tydetime tournament reference? If so, yeah , the other killer played so much better.
---
After the exhaustion Nerf it for sure isn't as good as it once was.
---
Not sure what the problem is with it since it’s easily countered by just doing gens 
---
From what I’ve seen playing survivor the killer seems to be waiting for other survivors to try to do the unhook some of my teammates end up getting killed this way so there is some reason for why killers sometimes do this
---
I was expecting a rancor mori
---
Remove speed buff
---
When I play SWF I swear I play like a god.  I feel so much more comfortable having comms.  Knowing when to make a save, when to hide, and when to do gens helps so much, not to mention after one of you dies they can relate the perks to the other survivors.  This confidence leads me to actually be able to pallet loop: something that's harder for me for some reason playing solo.  Once I pallet stunned a killer who chased me off a generator and tapped my gen and fled, hitting the overcharge skill check while I ran to another pallet.  SWF is the absolute best, and really the only way to guarantee a lot of fun matches.  I just wish they balanced it better.
---
Consider how little traps you have and how hard they are to place effectively this would be a good idea, 
---
perhaps a bar that takes a base time of 15 seconds to complete with atleast 3 skill checks. Failing will reset the bar.
---
This of course would be changed with addons.
---
It was, but I believe they recently patched it to have the same as all killers.
---
Cosmetics are Wednesdays. So the 2nd at the earliest.
---
Yes, but it’s not a fun experience for the survivor. Especially when it’s at the start of the game, you will literally walk out with no points and no pips.
---
Spine chill ?
---
Come on idiot, it clearly means to get something off the blood web after a game.
---
I had a game recently where a piggy hooked me in the basement then crouched in the back and waited for a survivor. i killed myself when i saw what she was doing. was i in the right in that situation? should i let myself die if its a insidious leatherface or a cloaked wraith hiding nearby?
---
Stop; I can only cum so much
---
It only drops it for me.
---
So pretty much a summary of everything that wasn't broken or didn't go to shit within the first day of a patch
---
The devs shouldn't be balancing the game like this. It's what I hate about DBD the most. Instead of balancing the game properly, the paper over the cracks by making perks that ignore the problems rather than fixing the root cause. 
---
Donde esta leche?!
---
That’s why when I’m toxic I make sure not to say stuff like that
---
reeEEEEEEEEEE
---
I love that skin
---
you can break the heal with gestures
---
I logged on to play killer the other day and had my drunk bubba basement build on and forgot to change perks (because let's be honest, running a basement protection build on bubba can be great fun). So, I hooked the first survivor and used insidious on the one who came to rescue the hooked one. They both died shortly after and waited around for the game to end just to tell me that they hope someone comes into my work and shoots me in the head.
---
When I told them to relax they told me to kill myself. So I guess the lack of situational awareness on their part can even do it.
---
He would drag them 
---
The best ways to counter it is just the other survivors doing gens and the survivor on the hook keeping the killer occupied. Or someone should save you with borrowed time. If they’re facecamping, I always assume they’re new to the game so juking shouldn’t be that hard imo.
---
Yeah, it's a bug that always happens in those situations.
---
I know right! Like surveillance already breaks rank 1 but w/ fire up? Unstoppable
---
Killers are suppose to kill though not be kind to survivors also shouldn’t the survivors be sneaky enough to not be seen unless it’s doctor?
---
Both and add Megs, thats my experience 
---
Dwight or David.
---
Not really. Freddy's character is actually quite different in Freddy vs Jason than it was in the other aNoES films. It could be time, it could be the directing of the film. Point is, even though the implications are a lot more, it doesn't change the fact that he was specifically only a child murderer, not a molester. 
---
ahh, a man of taste
---
Yeah killers are supposed to kill, but in a way that’s enjoyable for both survivor and killer. There are 4 survivors in the game (most of the time) so it’s not necessary to tunnel 1 person.
---
That's definitely r/softwaregore material. 
---
Problem is most people don't get enjoyment in seeing a red number, they take enjoyment in chasing and killing people which is why so many are complaining.
---
hes the biggest qt thank u!!
---
Hey, nothing wrong with a friendly lil hump on your survivor buddies every once in awhile. 
---
Reporting isn't not turning the other cheek. If I where to reply in kind to the abuse then that would me going against that teaching but reporting is just letting the designers of the game know someone is acting inappropriately and then it's down to them how they respond.   
---
If you act the way you do then it is just condoning such horrible obnoxious behaviour. Yes it's not the worst thing to be said but that doesn't mean we should sit back and accept that is how people want to act now. Sometimes you have to speak up to make good change come into affect. 
---
Do keep in mind the game has been terrible with making people dc lately. I even had someone message me with hate ur damn internet sucks stop playing. 
---
Where did they go trophy
---
Cool, I'd be interested for sure
---
To be fair I have had someone on reddit wish my whole family died in a car crash simply for disagreeing with his point. In DBD where the toxicity can be high and on console with no threat of bans damn you get some horrible messages. 
---
Monitor and Abuse, coupled with his low terror radius at Tier 1 EW, means he has near insidious levels of stealth in the early game
---
Happy new year to you too! Hope it's a good one 
---
I like this argument cause judging by the downvotes you're getting in your crusade against the legion.....
---
One person not liking a character &lt; multiple people enjoying the character.
---
Just let people like what they like. 
---
We’ve officially hit the point where survivors have decided that searching for other survivors not hooked is camping
---
Bravo, survivor mains
---
And apparently killers are supposed to let people get rescued lmao 
---
##hoo
---
Regardless, it's all meant to be the same, collective character. You really have no more argument.
---
but now you are gesturing rather than walking away.
---
first time seeing this lol
---
I did this on PC, but the Killer downed me so I pulled the UTP cable out of the rig.
---
We need to nerf Left Behind. The boosts for generator repair speeds are terrifying, and it encourages a toxic playstyle.
---
Yea right rank 15 is way better
---
Its never been confirmed but a theory circulates that there's no fps cap at the menu so the consoles practicaly work themselves to death.
---
However the fact your ps4 is turning off suggests that the fan needs a clean
---
Unless you have dying light since you kinda have to tunnle them or mori them
---
Also isn’t tunnling smart when done on a weak survivor since going after easy prey helps since other survivors will loop for long periods of time which is not fun to deal with
---
This killer tunneled and camped everyone I was heated. I didn’t care to include that but he wasn’t playing right.
---
He is only both in the remake, which is one of the big reasons the remake Freddy has no fanbase. I don't know what you're not getting but implications and outside statements do not make it canon. It was never explicitly stated in the original aNoES series and therefore cannot be considered anything more than a headcanon.
---
Playing him for the sole purpose of camping is what I think he meant
---
Do you really think they'd put that much effort into a killer by making brand new animations just for them AND survivors trying to wiggle?
---
Well if killers aren’t gonna allow survivors to get rescued, it’s basically tunneling/camping and while the killer is doing that, he’s wasting hella time watching that survivor on the hook. If you don’t facecamping and leave the hook, you can find another survivor and put them on a hook also. There’s really no point in camping or tunneling besides giving the survivor a shit time
---
"Adam is a great stealth character for the same reason as Claudette"
---
uh oh... Uh oh... UH OH...
---
"""""Altruism"""" kills. Sometimes you have to wonder how many players are actually altruistic and how many just want to farm those juicy altruism bloodpoints.
---
Im a noob to dbd what does bps do?
---
Know this is 2 weeks old but that would fit Jason pretty good if he will ever get released
---
Get one of the licensed ones, then grind for shards to unlock spirit.
---
Yep, BT is bugged right now. If the savior gets hit at all, the person being saved loses the endurance buff all together. There are a lot of people taking advantage of that right now, so it's best to not even waste the perk slot for BT atm. 
---
I doubt this will be fixed anytime soon. Assuming everyone will be on vacation for the first week of the year, I'd say a fix might come on Dec 7th at the earliest. 
---
You're right! Too bad all my teammates run shitty rank 20 perks like self care and sprint burst &gt;:( If only they understood the game breaking capabilities of Left Behind + Deja Vu. We better use it before the devs inevitably nerf it.
---
I wonder what the roadmap for year 4 will be I hope we get just 1 licensed killed next year
---
Does that work?
---
Always stall for time; the longer the killer spends time camping you the less time spent disrupting others, who SHOULD be doing gens.
---
I vote for Harlequins or Bristol.
---
No that's a totally fair question, and I agree it was a bad mindset. I've been playing a lot more survivor lately, just enjoying the casual games and trying to pip rather than worrying about BP. I really enjoy the feeling of progression in games, sometimes a little too much and the entire experience becomes jaded.
---
"Just a little bit" is the stupidest thing this community has ever latched on to
---
Happy new year, you toxic cunts!
---
I read "Kate"
---
I upvote
---
Doubles everyone's blood points from the match.
---
That’s the hard part about devs being begged for a Legion buff. Legion would be too good at farming BP and gaining pips. He’s definitely in a wonky state rn
---
He's always been both, in both versions of the character. A big reason the remake Freddy has no fanbase is because the movie's flat out trash. I don't know what you're not getting, but unless you're going with the Death of the Author thing, it's always been canon, and all but flat out stated in Freddy vs Jason. You not considering a film to be part of the original series or something not being canon doesn't mean said films aren't part of the original series or a piece of information isn't canon. 
---
I know on PS4 if the killer just quits the game you get the points you earned in the match, if they hard DC so turn off the console or quit the game to go dashboard you get no points. 
---
same man lol, that happened to my nea, i just used my offerings that give my more bloodpoints then just prestiged her
---
I stay at 60fps the entire time with max graphics, but my GPU runs at like 95% lol
---
Literally nothing changed for console except maybe game loading times which doesn't even mean anything. If anything the framerate got worse. 
---
I never said Reporting is turning the other cheek. I was more into "Letting the hurt, angry souls be. Or even be nice to them" being to turn the other cheek.  
---
"We all are not like this"
---
You are describing **everyone** as being "not like this". What you *meant to do* was describe "not everyone" as being "like this". You meant to write "We aren't all like this". I can't tell if you're trolling or just retarded at this point. 
---
Keep these coming please. Leatherface especially, could be about him, basements, insidious and camping because that's all they fucking do.
---
I just use a trimmer and use a wax called “grave before shave!”
---
Camping is a legitimate but very boring way to play Killer; yeah it sucks to be hooked but the game incentivizes killers to ensure you stay hooked.
---
As a survivor, if you hate facecamping there are one perk expressly designed for you to give the camper a big giant “F YOU” and that’s Kindred.
---
A killer that facecamps a SWF group quickly learns why it’s not very helpful; the SWF group knows exactly what’s going on; and they can either rush gens or go in for the rescue completely prepared.
---
Kindred let’s you get that without a SWF group. At level 3 it’ll even detect a facecamping killer!
---
So if you’re going to complain about the camping, run Kindred and see if it makes you feel better.
---
As a survivor main, I think killers are smart to patrol near gens, but standing there and watching someone die is just not cool it’s not fun for anyone and feels a bit insulting. When I play killer and hook someone I patrol the immediate area then go away to look for people I never just stand there and watch someone die 
---
It is never even explicitly stated in Freddy vs Jason though so I don't know what you've been watching but it has high implications only. In the very first film it is only stated that he is a child murderer and then it isn't until about aNoES 5 when the more noticeable implications start coming up. In Freddy vs Jason they amplified the implications but it has never been explicitly stated in any of the films itself. Just because something happens *outside* of the films, doesn't mean its canon. It can only be canon when it is explicitly within the continuity itself. 
---
Back in the day it was considered one of the better tracking perks.  It was the best way to catch people creeping round the basement!
---
We absolutely need an animation for someome that runs out of time while running. It is one thing to jump out of a locker and plop down-- at least you sort of look like you fell face first. Running, you just teleport to the ground like nothing. It has always bugged me so much. 
---
Nice. 
---
I can play nurse fine on ps4
---
I'm done arguing with you, it's like arguing with a brick wall. Bottom line is, Freddy has always been both a child molester and a child killer, even when it was just regulated to hints throughout the original series. For the record, it was never even explicitly stated in the remake, either, but I don't see you saying that Freddy isn't both. Sorry to burst your bubble about Freddy.
---
*Achsually*, the correct version would be Myers opting not to talk.
---
Then hold Sprint to force stop heals
---
I'm not well versed in playing/against Spirit, what is passive phasing?
---
Ahh that's fair, I agree that progression is important and for me the best games incorporate progression that feels genuinely rewarding as well as fun gameplay. But yeah I completely get where you're coming from, glad you're enjoying the game again :)
---
mate I just said you could or you could *not* do
---
But if you ignore them how is that doing anything positive? I agree you shouldn't react the way they should, personally I believe in 'treat others as you want to be treated', but I still think you shouldn't just ignore it. 
---
Join the bricc
---
You just have to turn your camera once you release the charge. Works the same. You just can’t pinpoint turn like on pc once you reach the end of your blink. 
---
Could you have posted this when I was alone?
---
other than the fact you play legion, yeah sweet points brother.
---
It's a stupid feature where randomly during her walk cycle she will do a mini-phase thingy where she 'blinks' and you can't tell what she's doing for a split second. Doesn't affect her power or movement, it's just something visual on the survivor side
---
 Oh i thought it was a killer perk not the party streamers
---
hey everybody I am here to say, I am going to T-bag at the gate today
---
Spirit Fury works very well with more straightforward killers like Myers or Wraith or Trapper or Leatherface, so it's worth it for that alone. Adam has a decent perk too, so together, just in terms of strength, Shattered Bloodline is worth it. Keep in mind though that you can earn SB for free through shards. Ive got Spirit for free. So maybe Halloween after that.
---
After using one by vaulting through a window and throwing it at my feet as I hopped through, I am 100% for having a rare or ultra rare party cracker as an alternative to flashlights. They're arguably harder to use since it's pretty easy to dodge them, but there's so many little tricks you can do with them.
---
I've got that issue where I never want to use my rare items until the right moment. I usually end up starting with a pimped out medkit and leaving with something else. I can't bring myself to "throw away" the good items lol. Honestly if anyone's on ps4 I could probably hook you up with items before I prestige. I'd rather they'd get used.
---
You just walk to break heal since the last patch.
---
Sweetie do you even know how canonity works? Hints are fuel for *headcanons*. Unless you've ever been properly part of a fandom I would assume you have little to no experience with this so don't try and tell me I'm making this up. You don't seem to realise what counts as canon and what doesn't so there's no point in me even trying anymore. 
---
cats would hate it
---
I honestly believe roughly 50% are farming, and the other 50% is just stupid.
---
Let them drown in the solitude of being toxic to the world. Don't feed their hatred by retalitating how they expect you to. Punishing them by bans or insulting them. That just feeds the fire of their hatred. No, don't even give them that. Let them drown in the solitude and they will change eventually. Atleast if they can't find people that feed their anger. 
---
I was using them on my survivors but I was either camped or tunnelled so I just stopped, I have so many on all of them but I won’t use them unless a killer messages me for a farm, I’m not giving a camping or tunnelling killer extra bps, screw that.
---
Trusting game devs in 2019 who monetise the shit out of their games...
---
I'm that nea. Go fuck yourself 
---
With special edition, the best killers are free or you can earn with shards. Billy, Nurse, Spirit. Definitely not btw
---
That's sad. Rank 1 killer lobbies only  take 2-3 minutes to fill on PS4. 
---
Does look kinda neat tho
---
But it’s not even like buying a killer makes you the best player in the world too. You have to work for it. 
---
Now my skillcheck cursor delays after I input, screwing up gens.
---
120 Christmas blunts and all perks for my P3 Claudette
---
60ping at the lobby=\=ping during game, some killers with bad pcs probably have horrible framedrops or shitty upload that cant keep a stable connection to everyone, specially here in south america
---
Considering they’re all low ranks they are probably are idiots
---
“Don’t van people who make actionable criminal threats on your life, just let them figure themselves out, feel sorry for them”
---
lol wut
---
aah that's hot, that's hot
---
So the usual then?
---
For whatever reason, playing Nurse with a controller (regardless of platform) halves your sensitivity mid blink. 
---
It is annoying, especially considering the frames drop mid blink on console, meaning you are attacking on information you had prior to blinking, and not able to adapt to survivor movements as easily once you do blink (if at all).
---
That's*
---
Not anymore. They fixed her super lunge after blinking so now she has  to actually be precise to hit survivors. I actually think her lunge his shorter than the normal lunge now
---
First of all, don't call me sweetie, especially not in an attempt to condescendingly tell me what I do or do not know. Considering it's been confirmed by the *creator and director himself* as well as the character's main *actor*, I'd say it's a **lot** more than headcanons at this point. Believe what you personally want to about Freddy, but the bottom line is, he's always been both in canon.
---
As a Myers main , I find tombstone too slow for my play style.
---
yeah im not camping but i was away from the game for a while so my rank rest a few times and people above rank 10 seem very green. I've been allowing people to farm so long as they're not toxic. I'm still not seeing many, i think maybe 10 from like 25 games... I've played one nearly every game.
---
I plan to make a series of these
---
Stale
---
On PS4 DC's count towards the achievement
---
I'm that nea fuck you. Sorry :(
---
Since you seem to lack reading comprehension, let me quote myself:  
---
&gt; Sure, if they really do something fucked up that becomes a real threat like getting your IP or hunting for your adress... deal with it without mercy.
---
Looks like the Entity celebrates Chanukah
---
I think you'll find that the creators can't just say 'oh yeah well actually this character is this' without anything in canon. Many other writers/showrunners have tried to do this with several things, an example being stating that a character is LGBT without any explicit content in the show itself, to which the audience is never happy with because they just can't do that without physical canon proof. This is the exact same scenario with Freddy being a child molester. Confirmation outside of the show itself does not count as being canon. 
---
:/
---
&gt; nd now the killer has returned and picked up my marks and I'm dead again oops.
---
Its trash, yep
---
I am sorry but I don't think that would work and I think your attaching religious dogma to the wrong thing. 
---
If you break the rules you should be punished accordingly. It is not wrong to report them and nor are you reacting the way they usually want. Normally they want anger and rage and you cursing them back but if you just say nothing and send it to BHVR that means its down to the developers who set the rules to decide. 
---
I respect your opinion and I understand what you are trying to say but I personally I have never agreed when someone of faith argues that we should do nothing and some karmic force will teach people. To me protesting peacefully and calmly is the right thing to do to create change, there are thousands of examples showing this and heck even the new testament shows this as Jesus thoughts and beliefs where not always shared. By us reporting it we are telling the creators of the game we do not like this happening, making them aware that it has happened and giving them the responsibility of deciding what to do. End of the day there is a huge difference between someone recieving a ban due to their attitude and behaviour and someone wishing death or harm on another human being over a video game. 
---
Wait really?  I guess it's been a while since it's happened to me.  Well that's good.
---
Which is all the times because running spirit fury without enduring is as dumb as no mither + self care
---
I just realized that Jeff actually met Frank.... holy shit
---
Ruin was in the shrine less than a month ago, I think DS not so long ago too.
---
Id take Pebble over those two, easily. 
---
I'm partial to the spirit
---
It's a shitpost....
---
Sacrifice
---
Sometimes when a player heals or is injured, their portrait stays highlighted in red instead of just flashing red to indicate the change. 
---
Yea, that’s where you draw the line...
---
I didn't get ruin once until Lvl 50 Billy then got to 2 by Level 10 of P1, feelsbadman. The bloodweb system is interesting. 
---
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT!
---
And the original script and scattered in hints throughout the original series, up to and including Freddy vs Jason. As far as I'm concerned, you don't see it because you don't want to see it.
---
lol literally anything, i play as a hag and use no add ons, offerings, or any op perks, and every night I get messaged by at least 3 salty survivors lol
---
Honestly it depends on your play style and what perks you want, I've played all 3 and they're all super fun, I'm def partial to the clown, but I do have a lot of fun as Legion rn
---
As a killer and bubba/spirit main myself, I can't see why people do it unless if the gates are open, I find it the most boring shit ever. 
---
"Last tip is just to keep cool."
---
I don't get pissed about stuns, DS, BT, etc... all that junk is part of the game. What really bothers me is the matchmaking. I just got destroyed by a team that was rank 6,5,8,16.  I'm rank 15. Why does BHVR think that makes any sense whatsoever?
---
I'm with stupid.
---
Apparently not for me
---
I think bamboozle (clown) is a top tier perk especially if you get down into the rank 10s and below, but then again haunted grounds is a fun perk to use (spirit) and discordance is a good legion perk or at least I like it
---
Last night  I was playing as Kate with a 3 SWF group. I tried my best to help them whenever the Killer (Amanda) downed them. I admit they were good, but somewhat toxic, since they teabagging a lot or bodyblock Amanda, clicking their flashlights even when she was looking for other survivors. When the killer downed me they did nothing to help me and let Amanda carry me over, however I managed to escape her grip and tried to hide and heal myself, however she found me, but did not downed me, instead she went for the others. After a few moments the gens were done, exitis powered, and the "No One Escapes Death" effect activated, and in matter of seconds the three survivors were downed, she hooked one by one, then sacrificed. At the end she found me, downed me and carried me over to the hatch. Then she messaged me: "Congratulations, you survived! ;)" 
---
How many times am I going to have to tell you that hints don't make it canon? I see what is explicitly there. Hints are fodder for headcanons.

For bloodpoints definitely legion. I think Spirit is the best killer out of the three and is more fun imo. 
---
Who knew LF is masterful at ballet?

Nah, it almost never happens and when it does it is few and far between. I'm talking every match and almost every person. 
---
That's cool if so
---
Nurse also gets stunned after her blinks 
---
Then I hit a barrel/branch 5 ft away

&gt; Bad Manners. Things like doing dens, using pallets, attacking a survivor and other things

Clown prevents loops and needs no skill to do so, I dunno as a survivor main I'd rather face a nurse than clown. No fun to be had vs him. 
---
Because adrenaline heals you a health state. You’re not gonna be full health yet have deep wounds that doesn’t make any sense
---
what is a p3 nurse?
---
But simpler threats are a low-key version of exactly that. They could be precursors.
---
Which means I cant do a somewhat relevant reply?
---
They could be. With the same likeliness of winning the lottery. 
---
Lol why though? The original Lullaby is actually really pretty. And it's Russian or Ukrainian too. It's supposed to be some folk lore thing that was used to scare little kids if I remember correctly. 
---

---
It's almost like every killer is different and they don't all need a gimmick like that. Weird, could've swore she had a fatigue stun.
---
This is my kind of shitpost. 
---
Why are you AGAINST reporting abusive users, though? I can't explain that.
---
When you quit, you can sit in the post game lobby until the match is over.
---
Shes known to pop out from time to time.
---
The fun one I had was in SWF 2man. One person gets hooked, I get my gen close to 99% (thinking if I pop it the killer will think, NOW they are going to save em). Unhook, he runs to the far end with me chasing him. Heal him to about 75% then he DCs. =/
---
I get stuck or straight up freeze in the loading screen pretty regularly. I lost a BPS and several rare addons due to it.

Made it possible for Survivors to cancel being healed by walking away. Prior to this change, survivors needed to run in order to cancel being healed.

I know he plays rugby but damn he would look dope in a skin with football gear

You have any vods of this you can send me?
---
How many times am I going to have to tell you it's not headcanons? 
---
Sure she does. Nurse has to reload every time she uses her power... that's the fatigue time. Mechanically, there's pretty much no difference, except the nurse also loses a portion of her vision during and can't choose when to do it. What even is this complaint?
---
u got outplayed and quit cus ur a fuckin baby lmao get off ur high horse

I'm saying that the community and fanbase make headcanons off of hints in general. But they don't make it canon in any series, not just aNoES.

Spirit is top tier, clown is mid tier, legion is bottom tier.
---
From what I've heard spirit is the most fun, then legion, then clown. 
---
Well you can't ACTUALLY throw it, my bad, my wording was shit
---
she gets stunned? basically just a small reload. 
---
tf is this post? 
---
Clown
---
Based on the location of his claws mid-swing, this picture implies that this is near the point of contact. And even if shes moved slightly away after a frame or two, this is such a huge gap that it feels very unrealistic  in-game. I've experienced this as both survivor (and as killer where ill admit it really shouldn't have hit). It was nice to see someone had taken a picture illustrating a problem many people in the game had experienced. I respect your opinion, but I don't think this post has anything to do with "free karma". 
---
Sacrifice unfortunately 
---
Adrenaline wakes you up because of the movie, where Quentin injects it in Nancy to bring Freddy to the real world and "kill" him. Sucks on the killer's perspective but makes sense movie-wise I guess.
---
No
---
I completely agree. This game is at its best when you play it fun
---
Bruh moment
---
There's nothing remotely supporting this theory, and on the contradicting side:
---
Jeff got a "black, vintage model" and Kate had an "acoustic guitar, the scratch plate engraved with flowers; as well as the initials KD, inlaid in mother of pearl."
---
No mention of a guitar case for her, no description of the one he got.
---
If the survivors get baited into a false sense of confidence, yes.
---
Except they still go down in one hit. Deep wounds eats the heal, giving the survivor just a speed boost. How should adrenaline react to deep wounds? Just not work?
---
That's totally accurate, yeah.
---
This is late, but just had a great game. Versus Myers and we start with three survivors, still 5 gens. The first player gets hooked immediately and let’s himself die. The second player rage quits soon after. I manage to get most of two gens done while injured but can hear Myers coming. I point at him and we farm down pallets, two gens and a few totems. He leads me to the hatch and I let him down my so I can crawl out. Turns out he has a Mori. He then finishes me off and drops me down the hatch dead. I seriously couldn’t stop laughing.
---
Anyone else feels like the snow makes it worse?
---
&gt;The problem is that when you’re an occasional killer player you get the most cheeky survivors ever.
---
Ye, that's exactly my experience. 
---
I play enough survivor that I feel like i get pretty diverse teammates, though. I guess not playing much killer makes those rough games feel more common.  
---
I mean, yeah I see what you mean about it being a complaint. I feel like a majority of posts on this subreddit are complaints about graphics or toxicity or people disconnecting. I guess I dont really look at it too critically because that's what practically everyone does in one way or another. So I dont really look at it as free karma any more than i look at the other 90 percent of posts here. 
---
It literally counters every killer besides maybe huntress sometimes.
---
Not that bad actually. Ive had ones that are literally next to the walls outside the killer's shack
---
So that was a fucking lie
---
Sounds like you're the asshole you child
---
The reasons none of the licensed survivors look like their characters is so the devs don't have pay for the rights of the actor's likeness. Still every time I look at DbD Laurie it does not feel right. 
---
That’s really not bad... only one way to it
---
How did you get this video bro, I cant find it
---
When you look at the maps, the small ones are usually filled with much more details, while Big maps are mostly empty with big polys faster to drawn. Could be the reason behind it.
---
What did u end up getting from that alpha pack?
---
:(
---
Idk I’d need to listen to it again I was just trying to sing it with bonfire playing in the background 
---
So because I give shit to people who deserve it, I'm the asshole, but people who do douchebag things are fine?

Uh huh sure

I wanted to see what would happen when it hit 0.
---
I know. It's not like it's hard to down people with Bubba. 
---
You might know this already but this has been happening to me too, and the only cure I've found so far is to queue up via SWF every time even when you're solo. Funnily enough if I actually am playing with friends I constantly get dropped from lobbies no matter what -_-
---
When you get healed it cleanses your status affects. Like how you’re at full health with mangled still.  There’s different between something that heals you a health state and something that affects healing rate. Now I believe the reason nurses does not work with it is for consistency reasons I think the devs commented on it at some point

---
Deep fried Bloodweb
---
Spirit is the winner, hands down. Pig is close second. I don’t care for any of the survivors. Feng, Nea and Dwight have everything I need! 
---
Never said it was good, just that it is quirky.
---
A game where you dont survive let alone do anything xD
---
I'd run devour hope more if my totem didn't get destroyed in the first 2mins, so now I run haunted grounds XD
---
thrill of the hunt with devour hope/ruin with prayer beads is insane
---
God dammit who keeps burning fog offerings! 
---
😂😂
---
For a second I thought I was in the wrong sub. 
---
people probably broke all the totems before the exit gates were powered
---
The farming is real. I got burned by a few of them so I ran a Tombstone then a Scratched Mirror Myers in Lerys. Cheered me right up. 
---
All of them at rank 1 when I’m killer. However the survivors ranged from 1-5 usually. Before that, the worst you get is just your average salt 
---
The survivors probably broke all 5 totems.
---
The only thing that bothers me is that they didn't even try and ask. Kyle Gallner didn't even know Quentin was in the game for like a month.
---
Can you do that for console?
---
r/pcmasterrace
---
For context. A survivor and myself brought bloody party streamers to the match. Someone else brought one of the other offerings for Alturism points. 
---
I figured they wanted to farm so I find the survivors and start banging the gen to let them know I want to farm. They all DC immediately. 
---
I was just making fun of how some people on here react to NOED being in the game.
---
yeah i could slightly tell but just didnt know
---
Nice repost.
---
A common shotgun skin for a dlc operator you're never going to buy
---
I'm game.
---
Oh okay thank you!
---
And also to be extremely toxic and provoking the killer.
---
I always keep my core of two perks as dead hard and adrenaline, but my other two are really flexible. Lately I've been trying breakdown and either kindred or deliverance. I also like using diversion with distortion, or botany and self care with a medkit. All are fun interesting builds that allow more depth in gameplay than previous.
---
I'm tired of survivors whining about every little thing. Wraith gets buffed to be able to teleport and survivors are freaking out, just adapt. /s

If they hit you once its to stop the scream.
---
I'm at rank 17, the lullaby didn't bother my teammates.
---
She had insidious and the basement perk
---
That’d be dope
---
I would split the difference at 15
---
NO YOU'RE WRONG. SURVIVORS ARE WRONG AND KILLERS ARE RIGHT! /s
---
My main doctor build is devour hope ruin thrill of the hunt and nurses calling I shock anyone who touches my totems
---
I'm just saying, Insidious is useless since they can still hear her just fine.
---
While i agree with you, i have to remind everyone who is "old" enough to the MW2 era.. there were no special snowflakes. No safe space. It was one of the most toxic eras of gaming. everyone was toxic, every child was the next selfcalled "fuckboy". The new generation snowflake would've hid under a rock dyring this time. Seeing how "everything" today is not okay. Back then it was more just muting and ignoring. 
---
Smart or not, don’t take the game so seriously. This isn’t a game meant to be played competitively, adding a ranked system was just there so that good players get matched up with good players. It’s supposed to be fun, that’s the main objective of video games. Do you think it’s fun not being allowed to play the game, because some sweatlord decides 4king is his version of fun and therefore more important than yours? The power we have over the survivor we’re interacting with is huge. We, as killers, influence their experience with the game. 
---
You cant understand that people want to play the game? Seriously? How are they dicks? Youre not playing the game and preventing them from having a regular game. Theres tons of people with all perks or bloodpoints capped, why would they bother wasting their time?
---
Spongebob is a disease of animation.
---
to be fair i was watching my old gameplay videos and found this, i have no idea what version 
---
sigh... noed 1
---
In all seriousness i like deja vu :'^(
---
You want to give survivors less points for escaping...because it hurts the killer's feelings?
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Yeah if I could've done without, I would've cut the Wraith, but I had to l, lest thy gay mods smitheth thy post.
---
&gt; If they are camping, then why would you give them the satisfaction of killing you?
---
Because it helps your team. The more time the killer spends camping, the more time other survivors have to do gens safely. 
---
*cries in survivor*
---
Oink
---
Yeah.....that is not how flashlight saves work dude :)
---
Borrowed time perk on survivors 
---
I play on PC, I started on the Xbox but haven’t been back since I did my build about 2 years ago. 
---
Why wouldn't survivors be upset if the killer is running fire up? It has no counters and obviously encourages a bad playstyle. Fortunately however, many killers don't understand the true power of this perk.
---
    /s
---
Borrowed Time, teachable Bill perk.
---
I wished the survivors in my game a happy new year but they started throwing racial slurs and shit at me :(
---
Borrowed Time. 
---
Whenever I scroll down to the negative comments, why is it always you I see?
---
This is the kind of different thing I was looking for, viable, serves a purpose, but not just standard self care + speed boost + 2 others lol.
---
Omg I work for Kingspan
---
I agree with this statement because I don’t mind staying on hook or struggling the full time just to give my team a chance to get a few extra skill checks in on a few gens. 
---
Lithe, Dance With Me, Lightweight and Quick and Quiet/Urban evasion is really good too
---
why is "leatherface must camp" a thing
---
Yeah and cat likes to pounce its prey much similar to ambush
---
This isn't a repost and if you think it is then tell me the post I stole.
---
I comment a lot. And bluntly. 
---
You can’t use unbreakable? What?
---
But isn’t it white?? 
---
This was red!
---
I thought it was a white bar, did it change?
---
Did they change it to red instead of white?
---
That's where I was at. The matchmaking shouldn't be as slow as it is while this game is popping.
---
Bond. Balanced landing. We’ll make it. Leader. No one ever expects Nea to have a few team friendly perks! It’s my female Dwight. 
---
Yes. Borrowed Time now applies deep wound and can be self-mended.
---
Is it really common for this type of stuff at higher ranks? If so I might just start exiting the game immediately once it finishes to prevent survivors from being able to say things like this. Sad that people want to be so hateful to one another though.
---
Bond, Leader, Dead Hard, Resilience
---
What’s fun about a guy saying “just a little bit”? It’s just cringe
---
"I don't think thing therefore thing is bad"
---
I mean it works both ways.  Unless you've memorized all the totem spots on every map taking small game is pretty important and they might not even have ruin.  Or they do have ruin but also haunting ground which is a counter to the counter.  I'm finally rank one survivor and so bored going up against the same 4 perks and the wave of killers with very rare attatchments or moris to spare since the event.  I do enjoy running a firecracker with ace in the hole/plunder's though.
---
Ugh it’s hit or miss. I haven’t seen in it any of my games for a long time. I usually get tunneler or camper
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the advice bud. Happy New Year!
---
Not to mention he dosent even have to find survivors.  his ability does it for him!  killer ez mode
---
Tru
---
Survivor perks as-is aren't meant to be stronger than killer perks (some perks, obviously, don't fit with that right now and deserve to be fixed). Point of the matter is, survivors get stacks by performing the actions I described, and can even get more than usual because you'll still get the baseline points you'd get for doing those actions in general on top of the extra stack. As I said before, WGLF can even be said to give another advantage by incentivizing generally helpful actions (bodyblocking, saving, etc., aside from those who abuse gameplay and just straight up farm their teammates to death), which in turn make it at least a little more likely teammates survive/get help. 
---
I believe he means when he runs it, he doesn’t get slugged but when he does he doesn’t. 
---
How so?
---
*hugs* you are safe now. 
---
another year another 6 months of shit sounds and bonkers scratchmarks.

Not when I nod my head yes to the Meg and then she shakes "no" and immediately DC's after 
---
I WOULD LOVE SUSIE SHAKING THE KNIFE C:
---
thank you.
---
Happy New Year from Puerto Rico btw &lt;3 (already 12 here)
---
I never play Nurse and its the best perks I had. I only played her cause I had streamers 
---
What if she had Amanda’s letter and saw a survivor nearby. Prolly not the case but u never know lol def against camping tho in 95% of situations
---
Well that answers that question... Sorry man
---
Playing killer gets more consistent BPs imo. Plus more fun when not playing swf. More competitive 
---
That wouldn't really have a place with the legion. The teaser image made everybody think that they would be a form swapper and when they had something different people were pissed. The form swapping idea should be saved for something else.
---
You're stupid. Just because you think they're 'hinting' at it, doesn't make it canon.
---
sweetheart u are one of the most stupid people on this subreddit
---
Should be able to zoom in on each image in the album by click on them. I'm seeing each one fine in my browser on my PC.
---
&gt;When a killer is facecamping, don’t kill yourself
---
I think most people just don’t feel like wasting their time. They know they’re going to die either way and just want to get onto the next game. I personally will just stick on the hook as long as people are doing gens but I completely understand people killing themselves against a camper. 
---
tenacity 
---
resilience 
---
unbreakable  
---
alert/ bond 
---
I don't even think Frank x Julie should exist, since you never see any of them together.
---
At least I can spell 'you' fully and won't call random strangers 'sweetheart' in a disparaging attempt to make myself seem better than them.
---
Dc gives survivors any points they already earned plus the 5000 for escaping. A force close robs everyone of their points, since the game can’t tell who left, it just reads it as a 5 man DC. 
---
I mean...its not as good as balanced landing or DS. But it can be useful. Like knowing what gens to do and not to do so you dont get stuck in a 3 gen strat
---
&gt; Besides all of this, I have practically never seen anyone get to the level of salt where they are shittalking in post-game chat. 
---
Really? I have merely a few hundred hours and I have seen shittalk tons and tons of times. Never a death threat, but tons of salty shittalk after games. Sometimes between killer and survs. Sometimes between survs and survs.
---
oh i don't need to make myself seem better than you because i already know i am :,v
---
I'm guessing by camping you gave 3 of them a free win so don't be sorry 
---
Idk for myers but i use knock out, nurses, deerstalker, ruin/thanaphobia.
---
nice
---
Sure you are, kiddo. 
---
Legion hits survivors more than any other killer, their chases last longer, if you’re running distressing your frenzy hits are doubled, so you’ll basically always get max deviousness points. 
---
PC NA high ranks i'm assuming, though. i get excited when people shittalk because it lets me know that i'm so good that i triggered someone else to the point of rage, and i literally made a friend last night after flaming this nurse and they flamed me back, it was great. 
---
omg don't call me kiddo i'm about to have a brain aneurysm 
---
Reddit, upvote this man. 
---
Ohhhh. I never thought it that. Thanks! 
---
Same I had a 3 person swf going and all 3 of us used bloody party streamers, and Meyers uses survivor pudding. Within 10 seconds our random survivor disconnects. Killer initially said to farm and we were all on a gen 1 minute into game and let him stomp on it until he decided to go tied 3 and down all of us instantly. We didn’t fight back cause we assumed he was going to let us heal or wiggle but nope he moried all three of us and nobody got any bloodpoints.
---
I thought about that, but for someone to hold down a camping button when they aren’t being camped, really makes no sense. They are preventing their own rescue for no reason. I can’t see the logic behind that. There would be non - team players that of course wouldn’t use it even when camped, but there’s a lot of people who would I think. It’s just an option that should be there I think.
---
It goes for survivor as well most times I get trapped out of chase it takes 5 tries to get out without add ons
---
I usually use up all of the extra point offerings with one character, Max out at a mill, and then spend it all on another character. You can do the same with prestiging just rinse and repeat
---
You can’t be serious. This build sucks..... you forgot hangman’s trick
---
I usually just dc based on how flashy their clothes are
---
at least you can farm with that guy :l
---
In all seriousness, Michael would totally be a cat.
---
Needs to be beefier.
---
If i want to play with 3 perks then i just equip fire up as the forth. Its the same thing
---
Knockout and Deerstalker are core.
---
Coulrophobia/Nurse's Calling/Sloppy Butcher based on your terror radius size, play style, if you have a one-shot, and the availability.
---
You will likely still have to hook people from time-to-time, and stay smart, thanks to the everlasting Self-Care Meta.
---
Okay cool I’ll have a look at the others perks.
---
If this is the week we get bbq and Chile I'd be annoyed I only just got leather face exclusively for it
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
EU PC - I actually have seen less flame in red ranks then in green ranks.
---
This happens when im the killer, but when im a survivor the hex is buried under ground.
---
Killers want invisible totems tbh
---
that's weird, do you main killer?
---
ok
---
Same. People who wait at exit and don’t even let me hit them trigger me pretty hard.

---
I dont run Distressing and i still max it every match. The best perks for Legion in my opinion right now are, BBQ for the event and just in general. Discordance so you know when two or more are on a gen, Sloppy and Bloodhound for the cheesey tracking. Stab them twice with FF and then turn around until chase ends then look down and follow the neon red blood until they go down. Literally nothing they can do to defend against it.
---
When you hit Prestige 4
---
Trust me, as a Killer main, I would LOVE to have more variety in what I can choose. I don't even particularly like perks like Hex: Ruin, BBQ, and NOED. I'd much rather have Killers be stronger at base by gens not getting done so quickly that I have to base my entire build around "what happens when the gens get done." I'd much rather be able to stack Dying Light, Remember Me, and Thanatophobia, or something similar without instantly losing.  
---
I agree with all the perks, but honestly the whole moonwalking strat is kinda dumb imo. Why wouldn’t you just chase them normally and M1 when you’re close? It’s much easier to rely on vision than sound. Sure they can loop you, but they could do that if you’re moonwalking as well, and at least if you’re walking forward you can see it coming.
---
Funny that if u camp when gates r open u will get shit talked anyway in post g chat
---
Australia, we usually share EU stuff so that'd be why
---
i just want my skill to be rewarded.

Nope, the terror radius should be Rasputin
---
Okay. I have fun playing Legion so I don’t give a fuck what you think. I’m just gonna keep playing Legion, and you can fuck off if you want to.
---
Not really, no. But I don't see why you would considering Mikey is the one famous for standing there and staring.
---
I guess it could also kinda work with spirit
---
People downvoted my comment because I told the truth. But you understand! I like you. Come with me my fellow visionary. We'r shall take over the world. 
---
As amazing as this would be, I truly doubt it. 
---
If everything the devs said was correct we would pronounce the perk eyeron meeden 
---
How aren’t his eyes dry by now? 
---
I occasionally try something very similar, but man it seems like every time I do it’s a game where people are getting hooked early on and I just can’t bother with totems anymore. Small game really should have some type of bloodpoint multiplier for every totem cleansed to make it more worthwhile.
---
this hasn't happen only on new years eve, this has happened during these three months ive been playing, and i've only had to play 3 times everytime i get into the game, if im really unlucky, i get no games at all.
---
I just uninstalled this game now, the devs needs to get a fucking grip until they know what to do.
---
I don’t know.

Yikes playing a game just to make others mad. Ooof that's super cringey.

Some guy with vastly less experience who plays on console lmfao
---
What platform do you play on ?
---
Leatherface before anyone else to unlock the Perk BBQ he has. It effectively while used almost doubles your bloodpoints for all time to come while giving you a good perk.
---
If you want to buy them in order of how good they are, buy Clown first, then Leatherface, then Freddy.
---
I never said you're not allowed to play legion lol
---
Probably not because not everyone is suffering from the crashing so much as you're saying

does not do much in my opinion unless you really do count on everyone using it and the skill check is pretty small but it is just my opinion on it.  I do like we can keep the toolbox though 
---
Playing the killer to torment survivors, I'd say he's doing it right.
---
Is it really that good of a perk? I’ve heard a lot about it , but I’ve also heard of pop goes the weasel 
---
all gens were done with everyone alive. I camped a bill right next to an open exit.
---
Poor door, only wanted someone to help repair a generator 
---
it was new year here 9 hours ago. Happy new year to you too!
---
I hate when my cat does that
---
I only ever hit a survivor on a hook when they have DS. Fuck that perk
---
r/woooosh
---
Ok thank you for the help :)
---
The flashbangs are sooooo much fun to use, especially cause I’m awful at using regular flashlights.
---
I’ll be a little sad when I don’t get like 5 a bloodweb ngl 
---
Imagine if any Killer could search a locker and get a Judith's Tombstone, wouldn't that be unfair?
---
That's the problem with Keys, you can just find them in chests and get a free escape.
---
Also, if you want Bond, USE BOND. It's not like it's a teachable. When was the last time someone legitimately used a key for aura reading?
---
Nah we can see Susie’s eyeliner with the mask which is what it’s meant for obviously /s
---
The song is literally about not sleeping to close to the edge of the bed because a wolf will drag you off into the woods.
---
Russians sing their kids some fucked up shit.
---
What doesn't make sense is why you won't either a) slug the survivor or b) find the survivor before they get the hatch. Should the killer not get points for camping someone once the gates are open for essentially losing the game? How sensitive do you have to be to cry about someone getting extra points for hatch? Survivors barely get any points as it is now. This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read.
---
Because the name “Johansen” is Scandinavian. Yeah, Jeff is Canadian, but the name implies his ancestors are Scandinavian. It’s pronounced “Yo-hansen”
---
You’re very creative 
---
I love when this happens. I was in a game not long ago and the survivors I got paired with were total potatoes. I did the first gen with Ruin on, thinking the others were at least looking for ruin or doing gens. I finish my gen and Billy comes from no where and downs me, I get put on hook and see my fellow survivors crouching around. Go into struggle and get unhooked just moments before I die. 
---
I find ruin, become the only one doing gens and unhooking the others, they all die eventually and I’ve only got the 1 gen done because I’ve been unhooking. Billy is getting to the gens and kicking them not letting me get anything done, real good killer this guy. So I run to a hill and run around, he comes up and I point at the hook, he shakes his head and smacks a gen, let’s me get ALL gens done, unlock both doors, cleans all totems and escape via hatch. 
---
Went from a game I was only going to safety pip if I was lucky to a game where I double piped and walked away with 100,000 BP thanks to Billy and my WGLF. 
---
Moral of this novel, there are some decent killers out there. 
---
np. Enjoy and welcome!
---
That's dope
---
The one time I’d wish a doctor made me Mad.
---
You don't need to moon-walk, with Bloodhound and sloppy you can just end the chase and look straight down and follow the blood. It's better to use this strat unless you're using franks mixtape, because it takes longer to catch up otherwise. This way its a mind game. I've had people run at me to try and start the chase and i just m1 them, or they ignore me and try and heal and i still m1. It's so fast this way.
---
Who is this guy again
---
Someone make a petition to have Susie shake the knife, cause that would be fucking adorable
---
How is pop goes the weasel a shit perk? It’s really easy to use and can really help slow the game down. Granted not as much as ruin, but an instant 25% regression is nice, especially if the gen was close to being done.
---
argueable
---
Right after DStrike and Self care
---
While it may seem rude, he doesn’t owe you the hatch, you should be grateful he let you complete some generators so you don’t depip.
---
It’s still more difficult than just chasing normally. The point of ending the chase is to cause the timer to run out, forcing them to mend, so you can M1 them. If you just chase normally, you’ll be able to see where they are going and just M1 when you inevitably catch up to them. It’s just more work for yourself.

---
I call it my stealth altruism kit, tho it sadly doesnt work against Doctor (finds me no matter what) and Myers (cant get Stake out tokens for miniscule terror radius).
---
What's ridiculous is you completely missing the entire point and then going off on a tangent on your high horse like a lunatic. My point was that opening a door and going out the exit gate should give more points than going through the hatch at any point.  
---
Dude...what exactly else are they supposed to do instead of “gen rushing”?
---
I mean, camp all you want. I don’t really care. But please don’t blame it on survivors doing their only objective. 
---
Nah because sometimes it’s a toxic response to toxic play
---
Good killer. You’re a rare breed my friend. 
---
She's cute.
---
Prestige character is useless
---
That was his fear, yes.  But you are wrong so was he... there was plenty opportunity to wound claudette and even bait David into a losing race against your swing animation....
---
The killer was flustered, worried and missed many moments he could have struck claudette
---
lmao the bitch censor came from me speech to text dictating this out into Microsoft word.
---
also wasn't tryna go for the rape angle maybe I should soften up that bit, tHough there are plenty of other fucked up lines in this like the Dan Schneider one
---
Yeah 
---
I will drop or show them the hatch only, if it was a hard fought and fun game. If they didn’t flash light the fuck out of me, run around a car for an hour, and they played hard why not give them the gift of freedom I think it’s a respect thing.
---
I'm probably gonna abandon the project, writing it was fun but recording it is a pain in the ass, and I dont have the delivery to not make it cringey. 
---
I don’t see what’s wrong with this. It works mostly from what I’ve seen 
---
That's what bloodhounds for dude, It's literally impossible to miss the blood, they CANT hide. plus moonwalking is just what the strats called, you can face forward and just look down, as long as the survivor's not in the center of the camera a chase wont start.
---
&gt;It honestly is easier to just chase normally
---
It's honestly not, I've been playing nothing but legion this event and have about 80 matches and i find this far easier.
---
&gt;If you don’t, just get the two frenzy hits, and then follow them. People act like legion gets fucked by loops harder than every other killer in the game, but it’s pretty much the same as every other 110% killer.
---
The other 110% killers have powers that help them in a chase that's why they handle them better, Legion dosent.
---
This is an online video game, don't expect privacy in an online game.
---
It becomes overly bass boosted during a chase
---
I do feel trapper has a hard time past level 10 as survivors are better able to loop and avoid traps, though trapper literally makes them wounded with the traps, and you can add mangled status effect...
---
Crashing 1 in 4 games for me.
---
Ray of sunshine 10/10
---
I think its drastic to say those perks are shit. The term you’re looking for is “situational”.
---
Dang, missed a great opportunity there!
---
Got a perfect game on clown earlier, Grats! Can’t imagine getting that on legion though.
---
What rank was that game? 
---
Yeah that was me lol. How do you like my one strike death slice?
---
Dang. I’m on ps4. I’m waiting to switch to PC tho. Just can’t stand the thought of losing my P3 Myers ;_;
---
Yesssss
---
Spirit + TotH = all time totem defense
---
Yes but you can see your ping before the match starts...
---
She is amazing but can you imagine what her boots must smell like after a long trial of being chased by Leatherface? Wow wow wee wow!
---
As a killer main I can confirm this 100%. I suggest jeff mains grab iron will until this is (if ever) fixed.
---
I was able to burn at least 4 bloody party streamers for a DCing killer and frozen start screens!
---
Few months at least? It took me less than a week to get all the perks I needed without BBQ. 
---
You mean you don't love the peak toxicity this community has to offer?
---
Iron Will is a must have with jeff 
---
Its not toxic at all. He gave you blood points before he himself gained more. You're lucky he even gave you a gen.
---
Just send them the video xD 
---
I had a bad snow storm here and my internet wasn't doing well so I just didnt play killer that day. 
---
Some people just think they are good, but there internet is trash.
---
Dead by internet 
---
well that’s not a gnoblin
---
I'm surprised I even got it, I haven't seen spungbob since I was a kid, but remembered that episodes an tought that was it, and now you confirmed it :) Guess spongebob sticks in yer memmory forever. you can never forget spongebob. Or you might die. from hooks because you didn't learn to stay away from them.
---
everyone blames the camper, no one talks about the DS, sprint burst, DH, self care P3 claud being bad enough to get caught and hooked.
---
Questionable but ok
---
Its a case of region. JO or YO is correct. 
---
Joke. It's a joke.
---
Huh, what was the context of the stream here?
---
I wish this would happen when i run autodidact.
---
good. isolate yourself for your ignorance and lack of consideration. we’re better off without it.
---
I'll kill myself if I know the last survivor is waiting for the hatch but apart from that, I always wait and waste their time. Helps out the other survivors.
---
All Kates are beautiful and deserve being saved.  Anytime i see one go on the hook, i immediately run over to help 
---
I responded to some of your points incorrectly anyways, you’re allowed to go after the weakest link in the chain. That’s not tunneling, what’s considered tunneling is only going after that person and ignoring everyone else, especially after multiple games. Camping is not defending a hook when survivors are nearby, camping is when you sit there and refuse to do anything when no one is going for the save. Both inefficient strategies with no reason to be used other than being a douchebag.
---
Understandable. Window Lunges can be weird. My point is more focused around the fact that the position you are currently at in the picture is nothing that a killer would actually reach thus it doesn't represent the actual lunge distance into a window.
---
Do you know what a sentence is? 
---
Wait really?
---
What platform are you on, and what map was it?
---
But having an extra lit totem is so cool. Toth should make all totens look like hex. 
---
I suppose that's fair. I would just assume BMing.
---
Am I hung over or is the text wiggly?
---
So what’s it say
---
Good addons for totem doctor build.
---
K
---
Oh so that’s what you meant I guess I misunderstood what you meant.
---
So what would be the definition of defending a hook when survivors are nearby
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
If they dc just cuz it's a certain killer, they're shit at the game, plain and simple.
---
Except you've already had to deal with the time wasting it counters twice for every time it goes off. Come back when DS requires being hooked twice to 'charge up.'
---
just as quality as his killer tier vids
---
Sorry I don’t really feel like typing out the toxic things the dude said. Feel free to look at the images on your computer when you’re able or you can try opening the album on the imgur app, it might make the resolution less blurry.
---
You're the last survivor. What's she supposed to do?

100% david. Step on me &gt;:(

Wasn't asking but each to his own, I guess. 👌
---
Didn't say it was you either, now did I?
---
I take it you've never heard of hypocrisy? 
---
I don’t quite see how I’m being hypocritical?
---
It's definitely not going anywhere. A lot people solely play this option. It gives them a huge advantage. I think if 3+ queue the killer should get an advantage. I'm not sure what that is but the game changes tremendously when 3+ survivors queue up together. Just the ability to constantly have eyes on the killer is detrimental to the killer.
---
If you replace Nurse's Calling with Hunted Grounds, they can't even cleanse the dulls to speed up the cleansing.
---
Fuck off. 
---
No.  The reason is it's optimized like shit.  Why the fuck is my 4000 dollar pc only JUST able to run it at 60 fps?  It's a broke bag of dicks my friend.
---
It feels better and makes much more sense because that's indeed how the game was designed. 
---
Not you.
---
It can be annoying as a killer, especially if the SWF are either really good or really annoying. However, I think it's a good addition for people who play with friends.
---
Well that was enlightening. 
---
I would play way less without swf. Even if I play 90/10% killer, having friends that play so we can ocasionally do surv match and tell tales of our own killer matches and have a few laughs makes it much better.
---
(i feel like i murdered wording in this post) 
---
Beast's marks is the best addon in my opinion. It allows you to actually close chases with an insta-down. If there's a stretch between jungle gyms, get them there and you can land hits way more. Also, keep an eye out for stealthy players, because bodyblocking somebody into a corner = free hook.
---
Yes, they should really remove that added benefit. Getting to camp someone AND it makes it less likely that you go to red ranks? Win win.
---
*Please don't check the locker, please don't check the locker, please don't check the locker...*
---
I just think it's not really funny. It's a bad joke. You are using a entire group of people to help make your punchline. 
---
Adrenaline literally only works once a game at a very specific late game moment lmao, imo its the most balanced clutch perk in the game
---
I’m not really salty, but why do it? Should show respect to me as a survivor since I ran her a while, but no :/
---
It's a joke
---
best part was hearing the Myers breathing.
---
like the cat was breathing on the cam.
---
balanced landing is imo 
---
Yeah I understand that completely, it's just not it's not *that* bad. They were already dead. But I get it, I see why some would be annoyed.

---
I can hit it almost every time, it’s just you.
---
i camped because i wanted to secure at least one kill. i didnt get any kills before i camped.
---
Adrenaline only does this because its lore friendly to the NOES remake... but this wouldn't be an issue if we got OG Freddy and Nancy :(
---
Yeah no, you said that already. Doesn't make it a good joke. 
---
Oh that pesky dead hard, how will I ever catch that survivor who's running such an over powered perk???
---
... then lower the settings? What are your specs, games don’t usually just stop running well
---
Good thing comedy is subjective, right?
---
Ahh a fellow Christmas  sweater feng I see.
---
Don’t listen to him. The clown is good, but Freddy and leather face stink as a killer. 
---
I saw this video ages ago on twitter and was gonna post a meme with it but it was when the devs removed every “non related” content so yikes you beat me to it 😂
---
Myers doesn't deserve that.
---
Sure. Just saying, you may not wanna use disabled people to help make your punch line. It's an asshole move. But clearly....since it was just a joke that makes it okay.
---
From the looks of it, that survivor has personally wronged him &amp; must die for their actions. If he didn’t have his chainsaw ready I’d assume it’s just regular camping 
---
This just happened to me on Xbox though, I recorded everything on here. I worked so hard on every Gen just for the other survivors to body block me and push me into the killer. I couldn’t leave because i had so many points .
---
It does, because it's comedy, it's not meant to be taken seriously. You can get offended, but that's your choice man.
---
Its pretty frustrating playing against a well coordinated team, but I play with my wife, my kid, and my niece, and we are in no way good. We just have fun. So in some ways, it can be bad, but in others its just family and friends having fun dying together.
---
I am tempted to joke report this and write something dumb. Thanks for sharing mods!
---
That makes sense thanks for your Honesty bro
---
So you can get away with making fun of disabled people because its comedy? Okay cool.
---
They missed their decisive patch. Gotta wait for next December.
---
That's comedy, literally making fun of everything. 
---
Ok, but what if you go looking for and find the survivor, and you both end up at the hatch. Now both of you are there. What then?
---
For my stealthy play style, doctor is s tier. It’s so damn hard to be stealthy against him.
---
I agree, nerf that shit.
---
I do agree, he played you but he could have just hooked and been done without letting you get anything further. 
---
I don’t  face camp but I understand why, survivors are altruistic cunts who will kill their own team faster than the killer can unless there being toxic ie flashlights body blocking and being over all toxic the killer won’t stand a chance I’m going to say this a lot but unless it’s a nurse.A lot of survivors want to be “toxic”, and they wasted the killers time then they get mad and they want 1 kill so they face camp.Understand please that if your not nurse your shit, because all killers apart from the nurse can’t beat a good group of survivors it is up to the survivors to make mistakes, and the killers to act on there mistakes. A good SWF group will destroy any killer apart from a good nurse, so if your someone who BM’s and then complain about face camping please uninstall and for survivors who don’t Bm and get face camped, it’s usually because the killer knows he won’t have a chance cant get a kill or he’s toxic. 
---
What about small game? 
---
Please never stop drawing♡ this is awesome
---
I accept Legion DCs because that killer is poorly designed. Nurse though? At least she takes skill to use and you can try to break LOS/use lockers to juke her which almost never get used otherwise. Nurse games are a refreshing change of pace for me. Its fun to try and outskill her. It truly tests both the survivor’s and the killer’s skill. Legion is just fucking boring and not fun. The chases are so boring and the bloody screen gives me a headache. Not even worth playing against a legion.
---
He hide his tears behind that fedora
---
Its a must have with anyone, especially if you hover red ranks and face lots of spirits. Its just such a good perk you should use it over self care.
---
Camping IS a valid strategy cause a Meg looped me for forty seconds and everyone knows running away from a killer is toxic as hell.
---
/s
---
I did this just recently with Thrill of the Hunt and 4 other totems. I call it Dead by Daylight: Whac-A-Mole Edition! 
---
Are you disabled or are you just getting offended on the behalf of disabled people?
---
Great LEGO and all, but if the guy is working on the generator, but there’s a hatch, the gates have to be powered for the hatch to spawn if there’s 4 survivors still alive
---
I am disabled
---
I am disabled.
---
Wait I don’t even play this game anymore much and that doesn’t even make sense to me lmao. If the killer can kill 3 people before the gens are done, and can find the last survivor(not like survs hide during hatch Standoffs) then why wouldn’t they deserve a 4K? They won lol
---
Better question is, why would you be entitled to escape + extra points when your entire team just got slapped and you didn’t do your job?
---
Did she have ds? If she didn't then you're not toxic, if she did, she's the toxic one.
---
I really liked Quentin in the 2010 movie, so I play him even if he looks like shit.
---
I actually grinded tonight and just hit rank 1 on PS4. I watch true talent to get better. And i mostly play Myers and spirit. Nurse is just way too damn difficult with a controller. I think I might just become a killer main and only play survivor with friends. It’s a lot harder without the coms. I don’t mind playing against swf either. It gives me a challenge and feels damn good to win. 
---
a cat
---
Missed the last one get gud kid
---
But the perks are good , I’ll end up buying them anyway , just wanted to see which ones skills are better 
---
Don't Dead  
---
Starve by Daylight
---
Ruin consistently increases the time of every single match. If anything it is _situationally not good_. Instead of being _situationally good_.  
---
And Unbreakable and Devour Hope are indeed shit.
---
Yea I guess but I’m a rank 1 nurse ps4 my guy and it’s so easy at this point also that is why I recommend hag she is unbelievable god tier if you learn how to play her but when It comes down to it any killer is viable if you can use them properly did you know? There is a rank 1 Freddy main 
---
i guess you are right... i was just a noob first time myers. i got scared. sorry.
---
They didn't say which December 😎
---
it takes two to make a thing go right
---
I only run a full totem build (Haunted, Devour, Thrill, Third Seal) in the Game map with Nurse or Spirit. So far only had one organized SWF manage to cleanse all of em ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Really? Damn props to you. I’ve run into maybe 2 good nurses ever on console. Maybe the next reset I’ll try to practice with her. I can’t even play her in a custom game against my rank 16 friends lmao. 
---
Oh yeah definitely. I get like 80k a game avg with bbq rn. Survivor I usually get 30-40 and get a lot more mad. 
---
I feel personally attacked
---
he wanted to put his chili in your burritos 😉😏
---
LPT: You can also conceal the drop animation (completely? not sure) if you take a hit and drop it immediately
---
Ok thats good to know. But still, just because you deal with misfortune doesnt mean other people cant make jokes about it especially as tame as this one OP made. He’s not saying “death to all disabled people” he’s just making a silly joke. If people arent allowed to make fun of one thing, then they wont be able to make fun of this other thing, and so on until it spirals out of control and you wont be able to make fun of anything. The beauty of humor is that not everyone is going to find it funny. I dont laugh at jokes made about poor people but I understand that people are still going to make jokes about them and they have every right to. You cant be a “joke police” and tell everyone that because that joke hurt your feelings its not funny or you shouldnt make those kind of jokes.
---
I like to run Resilience and I usually Self Heal myself to 99% to keep the boost, when a killer locates me i use Dead Hard to avoid the first hit and then one tap heal with Self Care. Sometimes survivors will sneak up on me and heal me sometimes though lol, it’s funny when i deny the heals and they have no clue why.
---
I got leather face solely for bbq and honestly it makes me better. Just having an idea where the survivors are in general helps a ton. It helps you get from one target to the other quickly. Or if you see two on 1 gen, disrupting that can help too. You should watch true talent on YouTube. He plays survivor a lot more as of recent but he’s a damn good killer too. He explains everything as he goes and talks to chat about what could happen next / what the killer could possibly be using. 
---
Forcing someone to do something they do not want to do equals fun? I'll be the Grinch in that case.
---
Switch Myers with Spirit then it’s a good sell, a Spirit that knows what they’re doing can be just as bad as Nurse imo 
---
the list is based on my playstyle and i generally like to finish the job i start. I dont really like to kill people by poking them with a toothpick.
---
What in gods name are those replies
---
You did something I deemed impossible. You made the super jerk looking meg into a cute "aaaaw" character. Well done! :3
---
Amen
---
It's not the actor that makes the decision. It's the studio

"Why do they downvote the dude who said the truth? That post was made about 50.000 times."  
---
"Oh hey someone bringing justice, whos that?"  
---
"Oh damn, its Mudmallow! Yay, that guy is still around. Even if he changed his Pig Flair into Spirit!"  
---
My thought pattern upon seeing this. Hey, Mudmallow! :D
---
Nurse is pretty much the hardest killer to be really good at so I advice you leave her till later.  
---
General tip:  
---
\- Use good headphones with decent performance. like Playstation Gold headphones or so. The voices are a huge factor for me. as a killer I can track/find people by sound and its direction. sometimes even if they are not injured. Steps, breath, grass, closet, jumps you name it. as a survivor you hear the heart beat better and also helps knowing what the killer is doing. (preparing chain saw, huntress charging hatchet etc)  
---
\-read the opponents powers/perks at least once.  
---
\-Practice. You won't get better at that particular thing (running, chasing, hiding etc) unless if you practice it. whether in public matches or in kill your friends.  
---
\-watch some youtubers and learn by watching. a couple I like are tr3ta1ent and tydetyme.  
---
\-Don't disrespect (excessive mockery, bad mouthing etc)
---
\-remember that it's a game and for fun :) enjoy occasionally trying to communicate with your opponent in a friendly way. ( i.e. if a survivor DCs I go easier on the rest/let them finish 1/2 gens or just farm with them. because come on it sucks when i'm a surv and someone DCs)  
---
Survivor:  
---
\- a good trick to use is to trick the killer by changing your direction after you break line of sight if he was going to go around to cut you off. Like in the jungle gyms.
---
\- If the killer is camping, don't hang around. do gens! your time is precious.  
---
Killer:
---
\- EVERYTHING GOES!
---
\- mind games. (i.e. Sometimes I pretend I didn't see a survivor who is hiding and walk to his direction but make it like I didn't see him.  then suddenly surprise attack)
---
\- Sometimes you have to defend instead of chase. Try to prevent them from completing the gens.  This is particularly true near the end specially if the last few gens are close together!
---
\- You don't need a 4k every time. Securing 2 kills and/or some \~22k+ BP is a good result.
---
Based on Legion i wish they stop making new killers with such a rapid pace. Legion *has* to be rushed, they're such a flawed design...
---
Spirit Fury and Brutal Strength get rid of pallets as well, they don't just mitigate them.
---
edited to add a survivor tip and fixed the formatting.
---
Who the hell is good enough to play against a god like nurse?
---
I haven't seen more than 2 bps in a game so far but I'm 199% positive that they're cursed. I've literally stopped buying them in my blood web. Everytime I bring one my entire team gets fucked within 3 minutes. 
---
poor guy
---
Without a doubt Joey and Susie should at least get their own voices.
---
Nobody really cares tho. He made a post that is very similar, and there is nothing bad about it. So feel free to leave and cry somewhere else 
---
I like them cause otherwise this game would lose a gigantic amount of its playerbase. But honestly only for that reason.
---
This is awesome.
---
Fuuuucking yes PLEASE.
---
For a second there, I couldn't tell if you were referring to the disabled people or campers. 
---
Honk honk
---
This is some top quality stuFF.
---
first time I hear that about Nurse and huntress.  
---
I did play nurse multiple times (PS4) and did manage sometimes to do really well. I didn't notice "optimization" problems. the only difficulty i had was with her abilities/using her. It's not as accurate as with mouse and keyboard.
---
Considering he's not European, JO-hanson can be correct.
---
One thing though, everyone pronounces Nea's name wrong. The "NE" should be pronounced like in the word "**ne**xt" not like "**ne**ed".
---
i wouldn’t play near as much as i do if it didn’t have swf
---
I get your point but this is probably the worst example for you to use because at least it's somewhat hidden here and not in plain sight from absolutely any angle near the Gen.

I  did play nurse multiple times (PS4) and did manage sometimes to do  really well. I didn't notice "optimization" problems. the only  difficulty i had was with her abilities/using her. It's not as accurate  as with mouse and keyboard.
---
But i think you're right about the map thingy. I don't really like that xD so far i'm going without studying them and just by memory.  
---
We do. And I still makes me chuckle.

---
Even though the Nurse is far better at shutting down loops and excels at everything else too...
---
Fair enough
---
np :) soon you will not need to and will probably learn much more.   
---
GL and many GG
---
So basically you have to be injured to do it. Damn.
---
A fixed time would certainly be better than RNG because trapping people is already hard enough and then you can just get shafted by RNG.
---
Stop using shit perks ☺️
---
I like swf its a good challenge to go against however u don't like 3 minute games. I know I know just bring ruin or other perks to slow the game down. I don't like playing like that I like to have fun give everyone a chance but then the game ends in 3 minutes and so next time I meet the same people I have to go with a slow the game build and slap on a mori to take some out to keep it longer than 3 minutes.
---
I'm by no means an expert, but I have some tips!
---
As a Survivor, know where you're running; don't just dash across the map, find a loop or a pallets, preferably both. Once the killer destroys the pallet, use the time to locate another.
---
Don't drop every pallet asap; it's best to leave it as a last resort or to get a stun. Using all the pallets only aids the killer in chases later in the match.
---
Find a playstyle that suits you; some survivors play better when they're being bold or aggressive, while others like to be sneaky and stealthy. Both are valid strategies.
---
Finally, time is your most important resource. You can't afford to waste it; if you're being chased, keep this in mind. Even if you feel outmatched by a killer, it's best to waste as much of their time as possible so your teammates can apply pressure by finishing gens.
---
As Killer, experiment! Every killer brings unique strategies to the table. Find out what you want to do, and go from there.
---
Again, time is important. If a survivor is frustrating you, it's fine to give up a chase and go defend gens.
---
Be aware; survivors can be found in various ways, from bleeding to breathing. Be attentive!
---
I recommend Monto, in addition to the Youtubers stated previously; he's entertaining and infirmative. He plays mostly killer, but does play a lot of survivor. Honestly, watchibg someone play a killer can give you the biggest insight in how to combat them as a survivor. Hope this helped!
---
So basically I can't play killer cause I am low rank, that's what youi are saying? cause then it's not my fault, then it's the devs fault with this really STUPID idea.
---
I watch movies, lol
---
PC, but that dont matter.

---
Happy cake day!
---
especially since that survivor is running sprint burst and dead hard at the same time
---
I use Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing, self-care, and Decisive strike. I like using this build because if the killer is after me I can use Balanced Landing to escape then use Urban to get out of the area without leaving scratch marks so then I heal myself and go back into the game distracting the killer and DS for the back up plan
---
More please! Love it. 
---
I mean, it's more like my perks for Wraith are rather bad.  I lack spirit perks, and BBQ, Enduring is good, but I don't got it on him, Devour Hope is also good, but not quite worth if not rank 3 IMO, and everything else is just stuff like Sloppy-Bloodhound or the like.
---
Unless I want to run Bamboozle to make him a bit less loopable, there isn't exactly many tools for me.
---
Right but it’s not just the event, crashing is still causing people to lose items
---
Took me a second to remember the reference
---
Plot twist:  Wraith was actually standing behind him the entire time, trying his very best not to burst out laughing as David lost his shit swinging at nothing.
---
Aren't a lot of old lullabies pretty fucked like Ring Around the Rosie?
---
Patent it before they do!
---
&gt;It is more of a safeguard against a bad game
---
'oh no I did badly well guess what haha I've got noed so even if I got 1 hook all game I can still get a 4k!!'
---
This. And survivors are too entitled/greedy to spend the time cleansing totems so NOED doesn't proc, choosing instead to focus solely on gens. Then they complain about it, despite literally genrushing themselves out of time to avoid it, as if they deserve to escape. 
---
/r/woosh
---
Where’s Claudette?
---
I almost always play together with my sister or guys I met through dbd (but 3 swf tops). Depends on the mood but often we don't communicate that much about what's the killer doing. I think it's part of the game and I would barely play without it. I suck anyway, no swf could help that xD
---
I mean NOED has counters.  Counters that TotH+Ruin SHOULD be pushing you toward doing anyway (Cleaning blank totems to reduce the time it takes to clear the actual Ruin or TotH totem).
---
Needs insidious... 
---
'psychopath' lmao do you know what that word actually means? 
---
Couldn't find better videos showcasing them, [here is the Wraith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sISUqiC32Oc) and [here the Hillbilly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LE9l1FeRw8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=144)
---
At match end, really, camping is the only winning move. You move away, they unhook and GTFO. Patrol, BT, always. (side rant, exposed and chainsaws should hit through BT, as it's an extra health state) Camping is mathematically the best move, looking at points and pips. Sucks, but that's just how it works out, given the increase in Sacrifice at the cost of what, 5% Chaser? 
---
Nea is probably your best option her power is pretty good and her mori is terrifying
---
And now we wait for the downvotes because this is a stupid joke that is overused
---
Getting dunked on top 5 worst feelings known to man but you learn to cope after awhile..
---
I often have a great ping and in game is suddenly hopping and flying around like the damn map is a trampoline
---
First off congrats on the perfect game, dont get to see a lot of those. But i would like to approach this in a better way than the other guy. I dont agree with him in that Legion takes no skill. I prefer saying legion does not have any counter play, therefore, kinda boring from a survivor point of view. 
---
Since i don’t know how you play legion, I’m going off my experience and I usually get legion who hit me twice and chase from far away to break chase and wait until I have to mend myself.  I don’t like this because there is no way to counter this. 
---
If we bring billy into the equation, he is easy to understand to play, but its a bit more difficult to learn to get good at. And because of the chainsaw charge time and cool down on missed hits, you can try to dodge the chainsaw and he will be punished shortly for his mistake as his counter play. Legion on the other hand doesnt get punished for missed attacks and gets rewarded for breaking chase and there is no way around it. 
---
Yea, you should see all my other survivor mail, only been playing since Christmas  -.-
---
Utterly delicious
---
Rank 1 Devour hope can be the best. Rank 2/3 will have people actively searching for it.
---
Yeah but I don’t like using a perk to counter a killer I probably won’t get. I’ll run it on some of my survivors though, thanks.
---
Upvote for monto reference
---
but at least legion’s power is useful in a chase.
---
Thank you!
---
No problem!
---
so adorable! :D &lt;3 
---
When you play nurse with noed because you're bad smh
---
That damn breathing, i hate it!
---
That makes no sense, there's nothing to grab them from. 
---
Since when? Isn't it 3 gens?
---
The sonic viral marketing still going strong i see...
---
You don’t know if they’re a god like nurse before even trying to play
---
NOED user found!
---
Yeah on xbox (that's what I play) I'd say there are about 10 amazing nurse's like out of 1 to 10 they are 11 most nurse's sit at around a 3 to 5 I would like to say you almost never see the good nurse's unless you are rank 1 on xbox. Sometimes I can be an 8 but if I'm really not feeling it I can be a 4.
---
I’m on PS4 also, how do you get the notifications to look like that? Mine are just plain white and don’t look good :/ 
---
Btw cool clip
---
I wish this was still the case. Stealth is what I’m best at and I generally use a silent Jake build. 
---
RIP
---
Nice I will be sure to keep this in mind whenever I have a daily to play Bing bong boi
---
We do live in a day and age were a "being funny industry" has emerged and loads people think they have to go deeper and darker all the time, It has screwed with their perception of normal speech and humor. You are really fucked up mate and the downvotes show that.
---
My main.  Love her so much.  
---
SWF is necessary to the game, simple as that. Solo queuing is terrible and with the new changes to the ranks there are a lot more players with less hours and experience at higher ranks so you then in turn need to get to a higher rank which can be tedious and unfun. It may not make sense in the lore of the game but it would sure be boring without it. 
---
I slaughtered three people as Leatherface, and my BBQ and chili led me to a poor Meghead, all alone in the world, too precious for the Entity’s Realm.
---
I gave her the hatch and received a polite thank you message, was a nice change from usual toxicity. 
---
The top left thingy reminded me fludd from Super Mario Sunshine.
---
I hit rank 1 with nea 20mins before new years!!! (My first rank 1) :3 
---
You gain bloodpoints for the struggle, so if your not gonna be getting that many else from anything else in that game, might as well work towards those. And who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and someone will get a last second save off on you while the killer's distracted!
---
Cuka blyat
---
Downvote for only playing half the game. 
---
I like the flashlighting of the killer, lol
---
There has to be 1+ gen done on top of remaining survivors. So if there are 4 survivors there has to be 5 gems complete for hatch to spawn
---
Wrong way round. Even a good clown still has to chase survivors round loops, break pallets etc. A good nurse completely ignores every method of survivor defence, which is why many say she is op
---
I don't know if anyone else remembers this (Or If I'm just that old of a player, casual since day-1 here) but it used to be wildly accepted that if a person is on their first time hooked and doing the unhook animation but then interrupting it so it doesn't speed up the timer, it means the killer is still nearby or camping.  Perhaps this changed with not being able to constantly see hooked survivors' glowing silhouettes  but there's plenty of perks out there that still let it happen.
---
Where can I download that Dwight picture.....for research. 
---
I meant it as in “I would rather go against this than that”
---
I think there should be a toggle of you wanna face groups of friends or not, when ever I face SWF I bring a red mori. 
---
I once stalked my way in to tier two watching two survivors do the crouch spam greeting. I hit tier 2 and then they booked it in different directions. It was cute lol
---
This community is easily triggered. It wasnt toxic. And like I said, hes lucky to even get a gen out of it.
---
What's worse is when the survivors all escape despite your best efforts and their STILL abusive/toxic/salty towards the killer in the post-game chat.
---
It’s truly amazing how much better my games are when I have that addon. I even got a “Franks Mixtape, YIKES” in post game once.
---
I’m survivor main and it’s frustrating for me to play as killer but I got so much better. Now I just don’t care if I lose since I’m always going against swf with instaheals. Started running blood warden and it’s so fun seeing them teabag only to find out they can’t escape. 
---
I just want maskless skins for all of them. 
---
The chance of them being on reddit isn‘t too high btw 
---
WHY ARE YOU FEEDING HIM
---
Freddy and Legion should switch now.. 
---
Actually scared myself like this the other day. Went to reload my hatchets and when I opened up the locker there was a bug eyed , bowl haired Feng looking back at me.
---
Jumpscared me!
---
No. He carried them to the hatch and then hooked them next to it. There was no reason for that except to be a dick. That is toxic and uncalled for. 
---
I will kill myself instantly on hook if I see the other 3 survivors sitting around a corner watching the scenario instead of doing gens. 
---
Close behind is that feeling of you know it’s coming. Ruin in 10 seconds, obvious swf, , more than one flashlight, at least dstrike (likely more).
---
Ahh she's so cute! I love it. Keep drawing OP &lt;3
---
Times like that are when ruin can be a massive piece of shit. Even after 3 'great's it still fucks you.
---
Yeah no
---
There is only two things i hate about this game and its spirit and Myers. Reasons for it for spirit I just don't like facing her I see way too many people playing her still and it's a bit annoying 8/10 games are spirit games for me. For Myers I love the concept love the character but he is just so boring to play and to play against I just can't have fun in a Myers game whether I'm killer or survivor. I know this is off topic with what you were saying but I didn't realise what I was typing too until about halfway through and I'm stubborn
---
I always wanted to joke report shit, but I'd always have this guilty conscious of wasting mod's times.
---
Edgy jokes are fine, it's just that there's gotta be a joke in there. Just saying "I would rape her" is not a good joke, the punchline is just you raping someone. Isn't that funny? I can say "I'm going to take a gun and go shoot up my school" and then call it a joke, but it isn't. It's edgy and has no punchline, that's why you're downvoted. You're being edgy for the sake of being edgy
---
It’s not true I swears it!
---
But honestly tho haha I use a pretty cookie cutter meta build w/ bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring, and ruin.
---
Dwights are in lockers.
---
Megs are either new players running sprint burst and adrenaline, or long time players, still running sprint burst and adrenaline.
---
Claudettes are the scum of the earth, hands down the biggest assholes of the game. Probably running a flashlight, and wearing head to toe dark green/brown to immerse so they don't actually have to learn how to play.
---
Jakes will not be seen all game. If you see a Jake, it's probably because they're saboutaging a hook in front of you.
---
Neas are Megs that are good at the game, they run stealth and meta perks and can usually keep running for a lot of the game.
---
Bills are a complete wild card, could bring fucking anything to a match. Hell, they play Bill, who knows what's going on in that head. Don't slug one or it WILL have unbreakabill.
---
Davids are cocky. Almost always running dead hard, but usually the least skilled at using it and will just lunge forward when you're completely out of range to hit them anyway. They will farm other survivors for WGLF stacks though, so it's worth keeping them alive for a bit.
---
Laurie players are attention-seeking SWFuckwits. She's loud, she's larger than most females, and she's probably packing Object of Obsession, teabagging you from across the map while guiding her minions to generators you aren't near. You're going to get genrushed hard, so kill her fast, or ignore her so she does more risky shit to get attention and hopefully ends up on a hook.
---
Ace is usually doing some weird shit. People play Ace when they're done being a tryhard Claudette and want to try some weird off meta builds like luck and plundering. Not your biggest threat but often an experienced player that can loop you for days if you take them lightly.
---
Mins are like a Nea/Meg/Laurie hybrid. Dressed in the most ridiculously hideous outfit they could cobble together, the min player tries to get your attention by running out in front of you and blinding you with her cosmetics. They think they're a looping god, often they are not. Similar to a Laurie, if you ignore one long enough they'll basically impale themselves on a hook just to get attention.
---
Detective Tapps are a lone gen jockey. Often fairly immersed they prefer to stay away from others and trudge through M1 simulator to make their escape, they prefer to avoid chases and often go down fast when spotted.
---
Kates are another wild card, most people play her because she looks nice. They vary from the veteran who was bored of Meg, to the "my boyfriend made me play this, where's the run button?"
---
Adams are dicks, but not just to you, to their team as well. They will stand in plain sight and throw a rock out into the open, then question why you didn't chase it. They will wait for a teammate to get 2 meters from them then deliverance in their face jsut to prove that they could. Will often play immersed but fairly altruistically, and only show themselves to get hooked to laugh at how good they are for using deliverance to get out of the gate.
---
Jeff is still a mystery. Who knows why someone would play a character who yells like a yeti in any situation, who grunts in agony after running a few steps? Perhaps they are deeply religious and feel like playing as Jesus will earn them heaven-credits. Perhaps they're just playing him while they judge if his teachables are worth the slot. Either way, fatty breaks hooks just by hanging on them, so keep it in mind if you hook him while the gates are open.
---
Okay SOMEtimes NOED with the scratched mirror, but only then 😭
---
thats a nice way to look at it. thank you.
---
It's not camping if I hook a survivor and see two Claudettes t-bagging on both sides
---
nea is the ultimate jerk, sorry!
---
if you're a scratched mirror myers you should always bring a Lery's offering, do that and you should never get to the endgame lmao
---
blood drops?
---
I would say that taking a break is probably the best thing you can do. Play something different for at least few weeks. Then you'll see if you really miss the game. 
---
I went with a pudding the other day with scratched mirror bc i’m a greedy bitch and I just hoped for the RNG best. We went to Macmillan’s and i got a 4k... at rank 4. I have never known such a thing 😭
---
Sounds nice but with or without the use of noed? 🤔
---
You gave me another reason not to get up in the morning 
---
None! I decided that enduring + spirit fury would be better off in the end. And I don’t play without bamboozle and ruin.
---
Noed? 
---
(chase music starts)
---
Might be a silly question but do you actually enjoy playing as freddy? He’s the only DLC i haven’t bought, purely based on the community’s outward distaste of him.
---
hey bro i play deadbydaylight alot to but i play on ps4 haha tips that work well for my videos i would say start the video with something funny in the first 5 seconds ! then a quick intro then the actual video. When theres a interesting sound a quick zoom in and out gives a really good effect ! in terms of gameplay your pretty good if im honest ! good survivor play good pallet loops and drops 
---
That's Meg, not Feng or Claudette
---
yea i agreaa, also ive been thinking that the mods could actually incorporate different game modes within dead by daylight or have the game move like a story line and branch off into different map locations . something to keep it interesting , its been the same thing for a long time now . 
---
what cool find bro ! super cool find ! n
---
Literally my first experience. When the Halloween jingle played I was like "OH SHIT OK HE DID SOMETHING!"
---
Yeah I'm actually a Freddy main and I really like his playstyle. He does need some buffs and the 7 seconds is pretty ridiculous (and can mess you up a bit sometimes) but there are some perk and addon combinations that can be really powerful. It's a lot harder to play him without addons than it is for other killers but his rarer ones can make him jump up to mid-tier and give you some easy bloodpoints. 
---
Dribbling doesn't "defuse" DS - now he's sure he doesn't need to handle it later in the game.
---
This is a joke, don't expect everything online to be serious.
---
This post makes me very sad for some reason 
---
A lot of killers have a hard enough time keeping up pressure as it is. Can you imagine if BHVR added perks that consistently and notably sped up gen progress? 
---
Where’s the immersed Claudette sitting in the corner of the map?
---
I love this creation btw
---
Cleanse totems
---
Not me. My pride engulfs me. 
---
I'm not OP but most Legions on PS4 just tunnel people into the ground or moonwalk+Bloodhound them to death.
---
Even if they don't do either of those rather annoying and unavoidable tactics; Legion's power has basically no counter play; either the Legion messes up or they don't.
---
I think they are making it so the addon is part of his ability now
---
i just bodyblock one of the exit gate switches
---
Well they look like they're all 30+ years old xD But they arent so ugly besides that, lol
---
It looks like these squirrels are having sex
---
You forgot Quentin!
---
How could you? :(
---
here comes the trapperrrrrrr 🎤
---
I wish all my teammates are like that
---
I mean... just because you play console doesn’t mean you’re a scrub
---
Where you the killer of the survivor?
---
Easy, because there are no Quentins.
---
True
---
Restart dbd
---
I wouldn't go so far as amazing, but he's a lot better than people give him credit for. He also takes a lot more skill to use than people think.
---
Unfortunately, he is the *perfect* Killer for camping and he will ALWAYS have that stigma associated with him.
---
After nailing that many great skill checks in a row, all the gens should just complete themselves. Jeez man, I could never do this
---
Also there is a bug.
---
Happens to me 2 times when a killer hit a survivor and you hit DS at same time it won't trigger and you loose the perk.
---
Nick Swardson is a gift of a comedian
---
It's like in Persona style
---
But i have to wait for it to appear in the shrine, i aint got that kind of patience
---
that's what a meme is, kid
---
All 2 dozen of us Quentin mains thank you.
---
Anyone who DCs just because they’re not winning/they don’t think they’ll win is not talented. Survivors DC over the stupidest shit. It shouldn’t be acceptable. Just take the fucking loss and accept that somebody can beat you. It’s a game. 
---
Probably from the enlarged killer perks I’d say survivor 
---
Having played as him and against him, can confirm. 
---
Thanks man, i'll keep that in mind for my next one \^\_\^
---
Cleanse DS strike
---
Yea I did a bit of research kinda sad about it honestly but I'll keep it in mind thank you
---
The fuck are you talking about? nurse gets stunned every time she uses her power.
---
Completely normal. She's the best because she's the hardest. 
---
Nurse can't be taught, because it's all mindgames and skill. 
---
Reason #429 that BHVR needs to give Quentin his speedo as a cosmetic.
---
Yes that is what i thought it was
---
It seems I'm not the only one who has a habit of catching Dwight's in lockers
---
r/softwaregore 
---
I mean, ive definitely improved on chasing since my first game as her, but in higher killer ranks its just hard to secure a kill
---
Different Mori’s
---
Good morning. I'm David, the android sent by Cyberlife.
---
This just in: Survivors attempting to Survive and Killers attempting to Kill are considered toxic.
---
That is all.
---
Great drawing really dang cute I love it
---
There's definitely an insta-heal on that medkit, fuckin Meg mains... for real though, great drawing! Looks super cute &lt;3
---
&gt;forehead is smaller than a commercial airliner
---
Definitely an improvement.
---
You can level her even when not playing her. I just got my Nurse from 5 to 40 just playing survivor and using all my bloodpoint offerings. Its double blood point week, so do it now. 
---
During the event we should always assume Myers is running Tuft +/- Tombstone (or scratched mirror if he doesn't hit EW2 quickly).
---
Saying just suck it up is dangerous though. How many kids grew up with people calling everything bad gay and internalized it and grew up resenting their sexuality? It’s the same thing here. Making jokes about things like that normalize the conception that disabled people are less than.
---
I don't main Kate just because she looks good. Dance with me and Windows of opportunity are pretty fine perks, I also like her Backstory 
---
I mean, the struggle against shitty perk RNG is a real thing. I have SF on my Freddy but haven't got enduring 1 even, so I just use it alone because I don't have a better anti-chase perk
---
LOL haha why would you say that ? im very very very happy on the first day of the new year , apologies if i didnt come off as positive haha 
---
"The devs are not incompetent, they're doing their best."
---
You used an efficient way to keep running away from me, that ain't cool!!! I will tunnel because you made it harder for me to catch you! How dare you?!
---
.... love those killers

Whenever I find a Dwight in my Locker I would love to be able to throw him because I have to run again to a locker to get Hatchets
---
I don't know, everytime I've seen this AFK NOED is not a fun gimmick play,  its a tryhard that saw this somewhere and thinks its an automatic easy 4k.
---
Naah, not really 
---
Why an asshole? If you fall for any insidious / noed basement whatever plays you are the one who needs to think about his gameplay. It’s so easy to predict, if the killer is not showing up the whole Match it’s fishy. Just destroy all totems and leave. No surprise... 
---
Isn't it ironic that before playing the game seriously I was a Dwight main that used to hide in lockers as soon as I heard the heart beat? 
---
You forgot the /s flair
---
If you can do it, that is. Facecamping is like NOED - a sure sign of a lousy Killer 
---
Ah i remember fighting off the killer with the lightsaber 
---
How is it being an asshole? I give them free points and let them all escape in the end?
---
&gt;I don't main Kate just because she looks good.
---
Name does not check out.
---
(Also stereotypes are stereotypes, they aren't true in all cases.)
---
Sex balls
---
Ive only played ming and even I have ran into dwight in a locker lol
---
Lmao just gram them by the shoulder, are you new or smth? Ez bby killerino duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud
---
Ok so you had a bad game and now BHVR should nerf a perk that nobody use ok
---
Dead Hard ? Suvivors have way more crutches and you know it ! I cant even use ALL  of them at once LUL
---
Reading this comment has made me realize the Meg in OP's drawing has no boobs, or at least no right boob (the left side is covered).
---
Cute af
---
How the hell do you swing that into a soft A?
---
Neh-a. Ugh.
---
Ok, then remove her stun. Clown dosent get stunned after throwing a bottle, why should nurse be stunned for blinking.
---
Are.. are you using a controller as a killer on pc. Respecc
---
Fuck off.
---
he literally couldve just ran away why would he run to that pallet
---
If you're getting 4kd by a noed chances are your team deserved it.
---
The Hair
---
lol dab on em how your suppose to haha 
---
From reading all your responses...dude, read the patch notes.

I can absolutely relate to the sound. My PS4 sounds like a hairdryer when playing it. But I've never had my console crash/turn off when playing. Where is your console located? Is it in a small tight area like a cabinet or unit? If so try moving it to an open area like the floor, that's where I put mine whenever I play big AAA games.
---
If that doesn't work I have no clue. Try searching online or cleaning your fans maybe. 
---
Didn’t work. 
---
Idk why people thing that Mr. Pouty-face is so attractive. 
---
it’s so very purple and so very pretty!
---
Turn your notifications off or block him ?

Whats there to be done wrong with lf in face camping? You stand there with the blade ready to go, much challenging
---
This happened to me several times. That bug has been around a few months now
---
That'S actually scary
---
The fuck is that formatting?
---
And, buddy...you picked the *worst* possible Killer to learn the game with.
---
I see you've taken the "spread the cheeks" approach when bent over a barrel. Good for you?
---
Let's see how many people think "and" implies "then"... 
---
i main Quentin ...
---
came here to say the same thing. beat me to it
---
It's so backwards. Feels impossible to not pip on them, and you gain more bp than the Carter himself, but you may get one kill at the very most.
---
If I still have other survivors still in there I wait until the killer forces me out just to give them a little time. Or to make the killer unsure who could be around to help save. But I also dont teabag or flashlight spam.
---
You can buy beer and wine in Germany when you are 16 years old.
---
disconnect so they can't farm you

Starve by Daylight sounds like a fun gamemode. 
---
I know that gamer tag... 😉
---
I spent a goodly amount of blood points so that I could get the legion perks on most of my other killer's mad grit on Leatherface, Iron maiden on Huntress, discordance on Spirit and Pig, Iron maiden on Doctor and all I am missing at the moment is Iron maiden on nurse cause survivors like to jump in lockers when I blink to them
---
Why I'd Rape??? Why not just something like would smash or thicc or somethin like that, still shitty humour but not "edgy" just for the sake of being edgy. Just saying maybe the fact u got 34 down votes and counting might be hinting you that you're in the wrong this time buddy
---
i do think Hag and Pig are average seeing as females tend to generaly be a bit shorter then men (not saying all females are short just stating a fact)  Freddy on the other hand is just.... a tiny old man 
---
they should've called it thirsty-chan instead
---
this is a good 2019 curse image
---
I find more Megs than Dwights in lockers lol
---
Do you mean bloodweb because I haven't hear of a bloodline. If you're talking about the bloodweb it is basically something you spend your bloodpoints on which you earn from playing. You can unlock perks, items, add-ons and offering from it.
---
I guess its just a case of  ''if I dc I did not die'' but hey at least they lose all their blood points from doing it
---
Lmao
---
question: 
---
how strong is trapper if he sets a lego trap on the ground will it kill the survivor who steps on it ?
---
I'm not sure why I get sucked into bruhs reviews but it was a resent discover and now I watch every new one when it drops.
---
And how can I escape the hang if the killer hung me?
---
Simply delicious content 
---
Gurl, I have tried a lot of different things with Freddy. The add ons and play-style are going to take you farther than any perk. Take the 25% gen breaking hook perk (pop goes the weasel), double hex totem exposed perk (haunted ground), exposed off hook save (make your choice), and exit gate time addition (remember me). 
---
You pretty much only play defense if the survivors allow it, but make sure you generally only commit to a chase if at least two people are asleep. Even if you do not make sure that you are keeping survivors in check, remember me will help not punish your mistakes. Always hit a gen after you put a survivor asleep at a gen. NEVER hit a survivor who is asleep unless you commit to a chase - you will form bad habits if you do that.  
---
Unfortunately any of the blocks are the best add ons. I try to take one of them each game. Hands down the best add on choices are the purple pills and the purple picture class photo. 
---
Other survivors can unhook you or you can attempt to unhook yourself (4% chance of success) at the cost of speeding up the sacrifice process
---
I ended up doing, beyond the point of a joke
---
just as survivors can 
---
I agree, I don't play Trapper that often but feel that his traps should be better.  Survivors get out way too easily.  I trap someone not very far away at all, too often they get out straight away.  Makes my effort of collecting and placing feel worthless...  They only seem useful when in a chase.  
---
if someone leaves the game purely cause the fact they are facing a certain killer then they are just plain shit at the game I don't care if they are rank 1 or rank 20 
---
I got a 4k with 4 iridescent emblems as a rank 7 legion on this nap last night. I'm not great at killer so Im kinda proud.
---
The amount of people who hide in lockers vs. huntress is honestly stupid. Just prestiged my huntress again so my perk choices on her are limited, so I've been taking iron maiden (only tier 1 but everything else is shit and the reload speed is interesting) and I get Exposed-procs at least once almost every game at purple ranks.
---
Enduring and spirit fury are a fun perks on Freddy.   I just throw myself on every pallet stun or not when I am not feeling competitive. 
---
Thanks. I'm no gurl either. 
---
Franklin's Demise would like to know your location.
---
Thank you!  I will try to play and this time I hope I won't be the first one to die :,)
---
Happy New years bud!
---
On PS4, Freddy is the best
---
Awesome bro ! i play killer main cause i cant do gens for anything ... Do you play survivor by any chance ? 
---
Also if you are the last survivor left and at least two generators are done the hatch will open and you can escape through it but you have to search for it.
---
God had my back.
---
i try really hard not to do this as a killer like i dont think its fair sometimes to people that are playing as survivor 
---
I have an infinite supply of ebony moris LG life good 
---
and nurse is F
---
Cant even play killer either. So many instas
---
I didn't know where he was from specifically, I just picked my 2 favourite premiership jerseys.
---
3000 iq leatherface flex
---
It's a little fiddly because it only works once they enter the dream world, and typically if you see your obsession in the dream world you're gonna want to go after them for hits (usually because you're running Remember Me) so it's actual application on Freddy is limited unless you're not running other obsession perks
---
No?
---
Did you play the tutorial?
---
Sometimes forget I have it lmao
---
Why is this meme on top page? 
---
Yea 2.5k hrs mostly surv. I think rank 4 is my highest for killer. Im on console and dont deal with 360s well as killer. Due to my large amount of play time Im decent at killer only because my prediction game is on point and Ive studied basic strats for every killer. I don't play as nurse or huntress but can hold my own with anyone else including sharphand Joe.
---
The person let go of the unhook button multiple times to troll lol. I only do that to bait a hit from the killer, when they face camp. 
---
Why are survivors allowed to whine and tell killers who they are and are not allowed to go for? Killers don't sit around and instruct survivors on which gens they're allowed to do.
---
If someone playing killer feels like they need to get a person out to help their game, then they should.
---
I prefer to get hooks on all of them rather than focusing on one person but my god the mindset you guys are talking about is stupid
---
Being stealthed as wraith muffles the end-game music for a few seconds.
---
Hahaha as i said calm down. I would recomend a good nights sleep to ease the pain in the nerves aswell. When you wake up i hope you feel relaxed and if you really try, you might just compliment someone of their work. Good Luck in the fog ;)

I swear this subreddit has a big sexy irony joke about David I'm not in on. Dude looks like the thumb from spy kids without the beard. 
---
You guys are taking this shit too seriously its a game and its trash talk on the internet lmao
---
I'm not playing to be better or the best I'm here to just have fun but it's not happening when you're put with people that aren't on the same level..
---
not really, a lot of ppl just spam it for fun, or spam it so he can be saved...
---
Agree lmao
---
How would a small killer even hook or carry survivors. Telepathy?
---
Wtf r u talking about? They dont lol nice try tho
---
It does suck how swf breaks the ranked matchmaking system. But they're usually extremely altruistic, which usually lets you get downs more quickly if you spot them. Also if more than 1 attempts the save that's 3 or more people not doing objectives. So while it does suck versing swf, as long as they're not extremely sweaty tryhards it's actually in your favour. 
---
Dbd Laurie looks better than the movie Laurie. Anyway, she at least looks good!
---
Sometimes toxic, sometimes merciful. You can decide which on a case by case basis 
---
And you know what? Theyll never be changed because devs “fine how they are” lmao just keep shitting on survivors when this window hit box shit is out of control
---
I have been playing this game on PS4 for approximately 4 months and I never had this problem before. 
---
If this issue occurs only when playing DBD, try reinstalling the game.
---
nun just fun
---
So you're angry because the free escape as a survivor can potentially be hard to get? If anything killers should be able to close the hatch for a duration to prevent hatch standoffs. 
---
Wow you have to be the stupidest human being i've ever spoken to.
---
Nurse can go through walls - yes.
---
This has a counter in the form of a stun.
---
You're advocating for them to add a limited number of blinks before she has to recharge, like the clown.
---
The problem with this is that you're just asking for a bigger penalty without removing the previous.
---
You're literally an entitled toxic survivor main who can't comprehend the game enough to form any other opinion than "WAH KILLER STRONG PLEASE NERF" 
---
That’s what kill your friends is for. I honestly feel that if you are super casual and trying to have fun then that’s the route to go. Otherwise just suck it up and deal. 
---
When I’m feeling troll and want to have fun in a regular lobby. I usually play something stupid like piggy and message all the survivors something like “TIME TO PLAY THE GAAAAAME” and tell explain to them that I will only kill them if they fail the first two boxes. 
---
Or hide and seek wraith.
---
What I’m getting at is if you really want to have casual fun there are ways to go about it rather than posting on here about SWF. 
---
This post is specifically about not trash talk, though. Read the OP.
---
Play the tutorial, also YouTube is filled with short how to play guides for both sides. Make sure it is a relatively new upload.
---
The three most likely culprits against the spirit would be rancor, haunted grounds, and no Ed. Make your choice is also possible. 
---
When you obtain the exposed status effect, it’ll tell you where it comes from. This is what will get you one shot down on the ground. 
---
Lewd
---
Sadly no. If the devs added the ability to see which Survivors in the lobby were playing SWF then most Killers would just duck the match because an organized team using mics is literal cancer. God help you if you're not using a top tier Killer. 
---
The only ways to determine if they're SWF is if they're being very obvious about it like using the same characters or have the same outfit or using troll names. Or they all spawn in at the same time though, this changed with the recent patch. I'd say if they spawned in at the exact same time it's a 50/50 if they're SWF or not. The only other way is to click on their Steam profile (obviously you can't do this on console because fuck console people) and go through their friends list. But of course, if a guy has a private profile he doesn't show up on a friend's list. 
---
Sometimes you just have to go with a hunch and equip a mori. Either way, it's better to equip a mori against a squad. 
---
mindgame a little, meme a little, and if all else fails, take a swing and move on because it isn't a big deal. You can have fun without 4k-ing, and more than one person can "win" a match in DBD. It's okay!
---
Nah I'll just keep finding lobbies where there's no SWF so that it's a fair game.
---
Half the cosmetics are buggy as hell for David. How do we raise awareness for this?
---
I agree that Legion has no counter play. However, I don’t moonwalk chase with him or break chase on purpose. That would be just as boring for me. I hit as many people as I can and then finish off the last guy.
---
Nah, I agree with you not being ranked with 1-2s, but you should be fine with a bit higher like 7s, as that's how you grow as a killer.
---
Anywho, I play a lot of SWF in all queues (Duo, Triple, Quad) since this is one of the few games me and my friends can all play together for a good period of time without getting triggered to Hell. But usually we're not really trying all that hard, since we just play for fun. All of my friends are lower level and rank then me, since I play more alone (I'm still in a BP grind for my killers- somehow they ended up getting boosted to a level where I can't kill anyone), but we do definitely communicate. But it's usually not much more then things you wouldn't find out quickly as a Survivor anyway.
---
But I prefer it like this, because that would just make all killers insta dc.
---
While it may be annoying, you have to blame the devs for not simply putting you guys back into the same lobby. Which hopefully they'll implement once they add dedicated servers, since the system should be able to remember your squad. 
---
Also remember that killers dodge swf because swf has a chance to be sweaty tryhards that end up being toxic and ruining the killers experience. Also complete communication really does make the match extremely unfair for the killer, so I understand why some will just dodge. 
---
I wish someone brought more BPS. Perfect match for that to happen.
---
Has anyone here tried Iron Maiden Huntress yet?
---
This happened to me last night. I managed to hit every single great skill check for 2 gens with ruin still active. I couldn't hit a single great skill check if my life depended on it as soon as I got on the 3rd gen. Doing that on the ps4 is a feat on it's own with the frame rate issues on coldwind maps. 
---
I don't think you can make it competitive. Sure, we've got the fan stuff but even that can turn into a bit of a shit-show.
---
Thank you :)
---
I usually just drop them on the ground for a little time out while I reload from the same locker they were hiding in
---
When I opened the game it crashed so I redownloaded it... the second time I downloaded it, there wasn't tutorial so I guess I missed it
---
Am I the only one bothered that this Leatherface is using the actual worst addons?
---
Yikes. Calling someone a lunatic because they have an opinion about a game. Who is the real lunatic?  You responded that survivors should be punished for basically escaping. I argued that if that is the case, why not apply the same logic to killers. Grow up.
---
"Let's get some BP! &lt;3" was my nick. ;)
---
You should play it, its very good and short and teaches you the basics
---
[Here's the original post](https://redd.it/87e17e)
---
Yeah I'm fine with 7s or even just 1 rank 1 but I'm constantly being put with like 3/4 rank 1s and I get destroyed xD That's the annoying thing there are SWF that play fairly so I feel bad if I leave the lobby on them D;
---
well, there is a certain balance to the game unless swf is participating. 
---
take a bunch of killers, match them with people of similar hours who are willing to participate.
---
need dedicated servers for a good connection for kyf mode. 
---
there ya go.
---
Ha people actually downvoted this. Are they mad that people don't want their trash in other people's games? I'm not surprised.
---
Ty, and i agree, they should bring it back, it's QOL and it feels nice to think they have their own personality.
---
Nasty now you have STDs
---
Yup
---
Yes because it’s so fun to load into a game to play only 5 seconds of it and get no points because the killer can’t properly map control
---
I literally just had a game where all four survivors spawned literally circling ruin.
---
I ALWAYS go after the sandbagging survivor. Its almost a guarantee they did it on purpose, so those assholes need to die 1st.
---
I love when this happens, killer cant play without his clutches, its just beautiful
---
I have so much tombstones on my Myers. It’s awesome aha
---
It's mostly frowned upon because honestly no one is really *playing* the game at that point. The killer is afk waiting for survivors to just lemming into him, the hooked survivor doesn't get to do anything right from the first hook, and the rest will just rush gens with no real threat, which is boring. The interactions between killers and survivors are what makes the game fun, not the generator minigames. 
---
First game of the new year my friend and I got mori’d by a hillbilly
---
leather face is too high, michael is too high, and spirit is too low.
---
There is no such thing as gen rushing. If there's a such thing as gen rushing, then normal gameplay is 4 people doing totems and hiding in lockers.
---
Not a good build if you rely on noed. Not sure what’s good on him but hopefully someone’s comment helps you
---
mmm yes
---
feng is scary when u pull her out a locker
---
An SWF squad also fucks over solo players and don't Killers still don't have the edge. So I don't think you know what you're talking about. 
---
Let's think about this: what is more important? Balancing the game so more Killers are viable and there's less trolling being done where a squad can literally do whatever it wants? Or, a squad can literally do whatever they want as the one guy NOT part of the squad stays on a hook for 2 minutes? I know what your answer is going to be, but I'm being rhetorical.  
---
As a survivor main, I always go for sandbagging survivors and survivors who farm others of the hook when I play killer. 
---
You ain't never getting your fuckin money back. 
---
This iteration of DBD feels like a developer left the entire code of the game open on their computer and while they went to get coffee their cat walked across the keyboard.  Several times.
---
Lol defensive
---
I don't even understand how they work, I stood in front of my friend who was legion (and was afk) I aimed the beam at his face for 5 seconds.
---
Not even a blind, I don't understand.
---
Don't use addons to start. This means no extra blinks, since it basically removes the nurse's skill and defeats the point for you learning her. Shadowborn is a very good perk to use on her, and if you put your graphics on 'low' then it will make tracking a whole lot easier since everything is brighter, sharper and there's no fatigue vignette. Don't expect to win game at first- go into the game expecting to lose, don't take it too seriously and just spend a few games getting used to the blink range until you're comfortable with it.
---
Im grossly immature? You told me to use my brain and called me dumb. Youre a fanboy lol
---
About 150k because the 2x event started a day before my week long vacation, and I only had enough time for a few games between preparing for my trip... I'm still pretty cut up about it tbh
---
I'm new to the game and have been mostly playing survivor. I find myself being absolutely terrible at getting chase  and so I prefer to just sort of sneak around and try to do as many gens as I can. 
---
Who's the best survivor at doing this, and how do I get better at being chased?
---
Sorry you fucking suck at not being found, juking, and got teammates more interested in farming than getting out.
---
That has fucking shit to do with anything. Killers don't have some responsibility to make sure that survivors have maximum fun.
---
By that logic survivors can no longer bring in flashlights because it's not fun to have them pointed at you :(((
---
Die quickly? just start another game, good fucking lord
---
I watched a bit of Nightmare: Last Year and wasn't thrilled at all. Is the game that good ?  
---
Doesnt seem that complicated to me. Each team would have 5 members, one of which is a killer main. Each team plays another team twice, once as survs once as killer. The team with the best point total wins (or however you decided to keep score) Esport teams already train for game specific roles now so having a fifth member that was just a killer isnt a big deal.
---
The real issue with DBD is that it was never meant to be played with a clear sense of team communication; hence why SWF is such a problem. They would have to rebalance the whole game imo to make it esport viable.
---
He’s carrying you by flexing... Wraithpreme
---
Because it takes away all the fun of the game
---
This would be my order if I had to start again
---
David for wglf and dead hard
---
(Wglf is great for leveling others faster)
---
Meg for sprint burst and adrenaline 
---
Dwight for bond and leader
---
Laurie for d strike
---
Feng for lithe and alert
---
Nea for balanced landing and urban evasion 
---
Jeff for aftercare and distortion
---
Bill for borrowed time
---
Some of these may seem off, but I put them in an order where you get a larger quantity of good perks first. Many survivor players (me included) will tell you dstrike is possibly the best perk in the game, but Laurie is nowhere near the beginning because her other perks are terrible. I’d say the same for bill, but some people like unbreakable (his lv 40 perk) but I think it’s too situational. I also think Jeff’s set of perks is one of the best of any survivor in the game, because all 3 perks are quite useful, but I say level him last because he’s new dlc and is subject to tweaks or reworks that could make his perks worse.
---
Also, you could level jake to 30 for iron will if you like playing sneaky, but I never use it cause I don’t like to hide.
---
I just got the game and have been playing survivor.   
---
Now I'm trying out killer, but I can not get anyone in my lobby! Rank 20 killer q time is how long now?
---
It's a bug since somewhere around(if not from) the Legion update. It wasn't in the game before that.
---
I think it's an indication of the Doctor's static field, so the stronger the lightning the faster you go crazy. He has some add ons that make his static field really big and really strong so those probably make the lightning more visually menacing
---
Starting to play killer more after only playing survivor for a long time is a really eye opening experience. And it makes it really obvious which users here still only play survivor 
---
Even if you're really good, wouldn't it just feel GREAT if you can just fly through walls and get people down in one hit without the hassle? Bad or not, it's helpful.
---
Lmao wait what's blood warden again?? 
---
(Fire Emblem joke)
---
Hitting them right after they are hooked stops them from screaming for so god damn long. So there’s that 
---
Honestly that's a big nut
---
Claudettes character model is pretty hard to see and her self heal perk is mandatory
---
Nea has a fast crouch perk which is really good for sneaking, you crouch around as fast as you walk
---
Feng has Lithe, which gives you a speed burst when you hop a wall while being chased, I've list the killer many times with it
---
Meg has sprint burst which is good for getting the hell away from the gen if the killer shows up
---
You probably know already but once you level up a character to 30 you can buy their perks so they appear in over people's bloodwebs 
---

** "あなたはもう死んでいます..." **

These are the same people who say that playing against a Billy/Nurse is unfair. Or a Killer using a Mori is unfair. Or tunneling/camping is unfair. These kind of people cry about everything and insist at the same time that everything is fine. Unfortunately these people infest every avenue of DbD online. 
---
Lol had a straight up moment were u saw ur future flash before ur eyes. 
---
THICCC
---
TV. It knows what I want. 
---
I had two more jump scares with the spirit and Michael I can’t seem to find but I promise they were better than this lmao 
---
Where do you people play, because, while I do main survivor I've also made it to rank 1 killer a couple of times and I honestly don't see that much toxicity.
---
It just takes a little bit of time. 
---
I played 7 solo survivor matches yesterday and escaped 6 times
---
so
---
Yeah whatever, survivors will always calls you bad no matter what. Had a Freddy daily ( my Freddy is level 1 ) where I had to complete a sacrifice, so I went for the first guy I saw and then just camped him to get the sacrifice. I was not even going to play further, would have let the other go, but they just went in a beeline to save the guy. They pretty much went all suicide mode, I snowballed from that and 4K'ed them in the end. In post chat they still had the nerve to call me bad as a fucking Freddy level 1 with Fire Up 1. Shrug
---
Jesus christ where is the shitpost flair? No one actually thinks like this. Right?
---
You sound like you use DS. 
---
Bill is free, console pleb
---
Exactly. And to work off your point, in more advanced ranks, if the killer is camping hooks you can easily finish all the gens and get the gates open. Camping is very easy to counter as a survivor, unfortunately the one being camped has to take one for the team. *The dynamic of the game changes with each killer and rank.* 
---
So, as killer, for the first five-ish ranks (15-20) you can camp with success, but past that you're gonna have to play aggressively to stop the gen rush.
---
lol i have 3000 and i got rank 1 survivor at the end of august 2018
---
I'm here for both. 
---
I dont think they changed it just for you coming back
---
REEEEEEEEEE /s
---
Anything but Legion.
---
No Mori
---
As soon as the match starts, someone shoots you through your windows and removes you from life instantly if a survivor touches a generator for 0.001 seconds.

*Disclaimer: I do not hate Monto in any way. I think he is a great youtuber and I respect him. If he messages me personally that this offends him I will gladly remove it at will. If the mods find this offensive I will also remove it. Holla at y'all. Peace*
---
Well for you to think like that must mean that you're a whiney survivor main who also gets upset when the killer doesn't just give you the hatch all the time. 
---
Why ?
---
You CAN get salty over literally anything.  You SHOULD get salty over virtually nothing.
---
i hate legion. its so annoying having to mens constantly tbh
---
This is the kind of creativity I absolutely love.
---
Swf group beating a killer ? Shocking. 
---
I love Monto and I think this is hilarious 😂
---
Dumb. But funny 
---
Or better yet - to Soviet March from Red Alert 3
---
Damn, I'm wrong.
---
I only used Bond in my single Meg match. I got out a couple times using only Tapp's unique perks. You really don't need super meta Balanced/Adrenaline/Bond/DS or Self Care builds
---
Seriously, if people actually played to get out they would.
---
Thanks for going into such detail, I’ll be sure to follow this.
---
thats what i meant
---
Could you at least come up with an insult that isn't so generically used? 
---
Also I do not see how I am defending this game, were you attacking the game in the first place? I figured that you were only referring to hatches in your post. Must be some invisible writing there. Didn't realise that offering advice and telling facts meant that I was defending a game that wasn't even being attacked in the first place.
---
But since you seem to be devolving with every reply I will no longer be replying to you. 
---
m8 he’s invisible!!! Couldnt see him for like the entire game and then he spawns suddenly in front of me with lots of mist and i cant see shit and I died (???) Nerf his fire up pls devs
---
Game was survivor sided for two years, heavy was heavily favoured and way to easy for them, the its is actually somewhat balanced now, killer still don’t hold the power role but it’s much better these days. 
---
As a killer I'd much rather play swf because it feels like the survivors are actually a team not 4 1v1s happening at the same time 
---
Wait, you might get Black Ice from an alpha pack!
---
Chat is always toxic no matter if most of the survivors live or die. 
---
People generally get annoyed when teamates crouch in the corner rather than not saving
---
farming off the hook is annoying
---
That's annoying
---
The men in the game, killer or not are hot. 
---
Np man! Are you on steam? If you are you can add me and we can play together or you can ask me more questions. I have ~250 hours and I am fairly confident in my knowledge of survivor tricks and tips.

You can turn off notifications 
---
Nurse. The nurse is garbage so all you have to do is run an opposite direction to where shes teleporting and youre fine 
---
I'd rather the killer do this than disconnect immediately after the game loads. Happened to me twice already.
---
tfw a trapper chases you to the gate and you think you’re gonna make it until you turn and see the entity blocker
---
UP
---
I feel very few asymmetrical vs games are balanced, but in most games I’ve played like this, where it’s unbalanced teams, the solo character is usually the power role and controls the game, in this games case it isn’t killers are outnumbered and underpowered. 
---
Balanced Landing is actually terrible, the stagger reduction is so situational it hurts.
---
Also the wiki says they go 132% during their power, which is slower than sprint burst. They also can't see scratches during their power, making it easier to juke when you have sprint burst.
---
I dont mind I am just stating a couple nerfs he missed
---
Oooh boi SWF
---
Trapper is middle to low tier.
---
The best killers are Nurse (not on console), Hilbilly, and Spirit.
---
At rank 15 probably Freddy and Doctor are the scariest-strongest. As survivors there rely mainly on hiding and aren't really good at being chased.
---
&gt;Do you think every game played is against a 3 or 4 man SWF...and they are all good players? 
---
If you cannot process the thought that playing against 3-4 people using mics (even 2 people using mics is hard) is incredibly unbalanced then I think we're done with this conversation. It's obvious that you're not going to get it and live in fantasy land. 
---
I don't know why you think that simply telling other players where the Killer is and how far along certain gens are is incredibly difficult. But you seem to think that for some reason. Most likely, again, because you don't know what you're talking about. 
---
First game of 2019, three DS and flashlights. 
---
Nope, it's just another bug that has come along with this update. Try another hook or the basement, usually stops that from happening to me.
---
Azarov’s spine? 👌
---
Looking for any and all tips on how not to suck as Leatherface.
---
lemme explain in more detail. there were two people hooked, both in tier one of the hook phase. i went for one who wasnt as far in the hook state as the other person since i didnt know who was who. and they got so mad and someone else saved them. then he got hooked again, he was in tier two but i was injured so i healed (with self care yeah lmao) and he died . 
---
the nurse isnt bad but i think shes fun to play against
---
ok, thanks
---
i was injured so i healed i wasnt just fuckin around
---
because we're all horny 
---
Mmmmm. His salt. Still you used self care....
---
What exactly is wrong with this...? Its a map based on the 'Saw' movies, so it'll have various props from it. Just like Hadoonfield and Badham..
---
whats wrong with selfcare i didnt have a medkit
---
I know but this guy just looks ridiculous.
---
I understand how annoying it is to play on console right now, and you guys have every right to be angry... but this tweet doesn't promise anything. They were aiming for a patch in December, and they didn't make it. It's sad, but I see no broken promise here tbh.
---
It would be different if they had written something along the lines of "A patch will definitely be coming in December and it will solve all FPS problems on console!".
---
So instead of Nee-UH it's like Neh-UH?
---
spirit is a tier for sure. spirit is arguably the 2nd or 3rd strongest killer.
---
Depends on the map. This guy obviously got very, very lucky 
---
I only play solo survivor but as a survivor who frequently runs Object of Obsession(paired with Sole Survivor) for both the thrill and the perk, I'd say it's fine. I understand that it's annoying to combat when being used by a coordinated SWF, but as someone who loves this perk, may I ask how frequently you run into this problem?
---
Rank 20 killer queue time can be long. I find playing at non-peak times tends to yield better results for me. When I play at night my killer lobbies fill faster than during the day.
---
Thats the issue. Imagine having a perk that does exactly what a toolbox does without a toolbox. It literally hinders the game as much as Decisive strike for the killer and dont even get me started how much it face Fucks the legion
---
Maybe a bunny Feng outfit with a iron on of shirtless Myers on the bodice? Win-win. I'd auto equip that.
---
Jeez that's a brutal scene
---
no this is a really bad bug that happens every once In a while 
---
Do you play claudette?
---
 The one you can loop and teabag with your swf squad.
---
Yea some people accuse anyone that they have any lag with in the game. The thing with this one is that it wasn't only me experiencing it, it was well timed and happened a few times.
---
This lowkey look like Daequan
---
Lol 
---
Ehhhh. Big woop she can teleport but after every time she does she gets face fucked and cant look up meaning whoever shes was chasing she just lost em 
---
if im honest this is pretty stupid. self care does not hinder the game nor facefuck the killer . it allows you to heal without a medkit, its just useful.
---
To get better at being chased, do as much chases as possible. Learn the layouts of maps. Think ahead, if I run into this direction is there anything to work with? Pallets / jungle gyms etc. - you need to practice mind games, look how every killer plays, do they respect pallets or do they just swing into every pallet to get it out of the way. You need to adapt to their playstyle. Some are extremely good at mind gaming some aren’t, what perks to they use. Learn the difference between a safe and a unsafe pallet. And mostly it’s map knowledge and experience. 
---
I literally just thought the same thing. It's always this guy with lots of downvotes. Not the best advertising for his (apparently existing) streaming channel.
---
The community is garbage but the devs don't give a fuck because it brings in the money.
---
They are utter scum
---
Try wanting to reload hatches but you see Claudette jump into a locker right in front of you so you grab her instead 
---
If anything they should make the perk better. It is nowhere in need of a nerf. Anyone who uses that perk is just waiting to die 
---
There are times where you can't exactly stop yourself from dying. If you are the last one around a Legions frenzy, or you get borrowed timed, the killer can just follow your blood trail without triggering a chase and either let your timer run out or just hit you again outright 
---
That’s not a bug it’s lag switching. Just pull your cord for some seconds and wait then put it back in. It’s pure BM. If you run mlga you can see how their pings are spiking up in this time. 
---
That a Captain Holt line  :)
---
the first time i played against a michael my friends warned me of the dreaded “tombstone” i asked what it was and the second i did i was yeeted. imo he does need a slight nerf with the tombstone. but overall i love it 
---
I think it's a shame that it's so easy to figuer out whether iron maiden is in the game
---
tombstones are really annoying but ive made a vow to never spread salt ☺️
---
Survivor is easy tho. Always has been. For the flashlights, just get good at flashlight saving, liberal
---
Shhh, let this dude stay clueless, it's funny reading their comments
---
50 no escapes*
---
* by exit gates
---
Stopped reading at rank 3 btw
---
i only rant n stuff on this sub but i sont message people w salt
---
I like playing against hag the most. U gotta be careful where/when u run. She will spook the shit out of u and is pretty balanced imo
---
Billy
---
Was wondering, are you my fiend? I litteraly bought the game as a newyear present for my friend yesterday
---
A bad nurse, a good nurse is crazy hard to go against but rarely go up against them.
---
Legion also. 
---
?XD
---
It is? For what I see it’s mostly ppl complaining about DS and NOED 99 percent of the time. That and SWF
---
This is the one instance out of dozens where the totem isn't a bitch and a half to find.
---
"I really wish killers would stop running NOED"
---
This entire sub is garbage. Reposted memes, stolen art, complete shutdown of any real discussion because people argue like children.
---
Exactly
---
Hard to break a virtually non functional thing to begin with.
---
Survivor main, but I do play killer. Will start doing this now + such a dick move, I've been on that side of the pallet before :( 
---
Well it counters BBQ so theres that
---
i play on ps4 so its rare i go against a decent nurse
---
As Hag you have 10 traps. When you try to set one more trap the oldest will disappear in order for you to set the new one
---
Legion shouldn’t exist at all, sucked all of the fun from the game.
---
The Min is very real, but there's an important second flavor of Min. I fucking suck at skill checks and know it and *I don't want to face the consequences of my actions.*

If Huntress had an Elmo cosmetic, her [TERROR RADIUS](https://youtu.be/jQRb4DZnhn8) would be sick.

Try Discordance
---
You could still have DS haha 
---
Maybe they were disarmed with a flaslight? I think when you are to close to them you cant actually see their auras maybe is that. 
---
That's actually pretty hilarious
---
I’m gonna go ahead and say we all have done this at some point.
---
😂
---
We'll make it, botany knowledge, medkit with healing speed add-ons and they STILL run away from me.
---
Don't give up, skeleton!
---
Nurse takes a lot of mechanical mastery to do well so you have to expect to get bodied your first hours with her. Someone said don't use add-ons, I beg to differ. Use only add-ons that give you more blinks but don't mess with the distance at start. Fuck anyone saying "it doesn't take skill to use three blinks" you're practicing the mechanics of blinks and the more you can blink, the faster you learn. Blink all the time to get a hang of how they work and try to always keep people in your LOS so you don't need to predict blinks, you'll learn to do that with time. 
---
That's her heartbeat her lullaby is national anthem
---
Me too.
---
Been playing for 6 months and have probably only went against a good nurse a handful of times.
---
Can you stopping being toxic and realise people don’t like being in the open when they heal because for all they now the killer might give up on chasing that person and go for someone else who might be them?
---
Peak toxicity
---
Funny how everyone thinks BHVR will deliver dedicated servers in time xD
---
An entire overview of the game would take a long time to type out.
---
Play a dozen killer games, then a dozen survivor games, then be more specific about what you’re struggling with.
---
it's a visual bug, idk what causes it but it's been happening since the last patch. It's pretty funny so I dont expect it to be fixed very fast
---
i only spread salt to face campers. they don’t deserve mercy.
---
LF is always worth buying
---
Here before this starts trending :)
---
Got to get your dad jokes to level up.
---
Game is extremely skewed to survivor side, you just rarely see this because of how worthless the ranking system is. It’s the only game mode so there is no seperationof casuals and competitives, it doesn’t weigh skill properly, it resets all the time, etc.
---
I could go into a large novel about why but it can be easily summed into a single sentence. A single survivor can run a killer around for 5 gens.
---
I know that yes. Still wondering why its him all the time
---
This would be very op because sometimes the audio cues mess you up. If they had visual cues, everyone would abuse them.
---
Hahahaahgssg well, what a miracle Bob
---
Like when it says “Tony Garza has joined the party” The colors of the notification are black and grey, mine are just white
---
Thank you , have a nice year!
---
Try leaving the hook.
---
Yeah you seem to be at the same level as him unless my eyes are knackered, why can't you hit them? 
---
No interactivity once he has found you. 
---
when i see scratch marks nearby obviously i aint leavin
---
&gt;one of the most unusual perks of the game
---
I can't think of a worse perk than surveillance. What is even it's purpose? 
---
How come? He teleported unto me while I was trying to loop him.
---
I don't think they're unfair wtf? I find hillbilly and the nurse difficult to play as so it's quite the opposite to what I think. Logically I think being put with people that are way higher ranks with headsets in a party is obviously unfair that goes for any game even a child could see that. 
---
As ruin gets removed
---
I did and got called trash xD
---
DAM BOI SHE aerodynamic.
---
The game's pretty good for this, IMO there's only a few things both sides have a point about.
---
Survivors
---
* Good Nurses are OP in general and need fixing, but I think small tweaks can make her fairer rather than drastic changes.
---
* Legion is OP at getting one person, and absolutely awful at getting everyone.
---
Killers
---
* Gen Rushing sucks (Bonus points for Brand New Parts)
---
* Looping really sucks. Again small changes can balance this better I think.
---
I probably forgot some stuff but otherwise for me I think anything else is fine, or somewhat intentional, including stuff like camping.
---
At the end of the day I think the reason we all keep playing is because like I said at the start, the game's pretty good with balance. If it wasn't nobody would genuinely play because of imbalance frustration.
---
You’re complaining about people pulling off the hook in front of you, but then never leaving the hook, thus creating the problem yourself.
---
It's been over a year who still hasn't got it?
---
IMO just to reward players that get messed up by camping and don't get to play... there should be a system that detects if the killer is camping (continued proximity to you on the hook?) and award many additional bloodpoints to you for wasting the killer's time.
---
😂😂😂 i love this glitch 
---
God damn, you're talking about shit talk in a video game, not the goddamn shores of Normandy. 
---
You're not hard.
---
This is the wrong opinion
---
“NeRf No OnE EsCaPeS DeAtH” 
---
I disagree. Survivors are perfectly fine and I still have fun playing survivor. Yes, I don't escape as much as I used to before the pallet vacuum changes but that's perfectly acceptable too! I'm sure that if you give it the time, you'll find these changes are actually perfectly fine.
---
No mither is so fucking broken idk how this got past QA. But surveillance, I see this every game and killers just dominate with it, it's worse than facecamping and yet it happens every game, ffs devs pls balance this.
---
How dare people want to play with their buds! I now can unleash my inner asshole that I have to keep hidden!
---
I find it really fun. It makes managing your hatchet count less of a chore.
---
Slow the game down JUST A RIBBIT!
---
How, she can't see them and is AFK
---
This is like the 1000th billion time I’ve seen one of these. 
---
Personally main Legion but can definitely see why he’s seen as underpowered / however you’d put it.
---
And you are the bad guy..
---
Wouldn’t surprise me if it’s another bug. One game none of my traps worked. The survivors would run directly above the traps and nothing. Was basically no teleport Hag the entire game.
---
Bunny Feng is almost as necessary as console optimization. 
---
i want to show people what others think.
---
Nurse. Juking her is such a challenge, but if you do juke her it is very rewarding. She really puts my skill to the test 
---
Legion doesn't get kills, but he's fun, and gets a shit ton of points during double blood point weekend while giving survivors enough points too.
---
No. I thought maybe Pop Goes the Weasel would do all right since Legion has pretty good -albeit limited- mobility but sadly, the effect it has is minimal. Like, it will set them back by about 20 seconds on a gen but that's it. And it takes about a minute to down a guy unless you get really lucky so...
---
Like others have said, Ruin is unfortunately your best bet. 
---
So cute. I love it!
---
I think this is where people get it twisted and I’m not trying to speak badly but playing killer is taking advantage of survivors mistakes, people often say they’re good when they get four kills as Freddy at Rank 1 when that isn’t the case. If you win at high ranks with every killer besides Billy, Nurse, or Huntress you basically won because the survivors messed up and you took advantage of it. Not because you’re good, don’t take this as hate but rather a piece of knowledge you can store in your memory and look back at.
---
Assuming I am a survivor main just because I told genuine problem with the nurse
---
Stun? Good nurse will get close to you regardless. One guy who commented in this thread totally got it, but I guess you don't have the intellect to get it.
---
People like you should play this game more with all the killers.
---
I'm pretty sure even if he hit him, he wouldn't be able to pick him up.
---
p.s. - I forgot they can just bleed out sorry
---
I'd have to say this more so depends on the group of SWF and the solos. Both groups are a coin toss, as you could be going against a casual group of SWF or an uber competitve one. Same thing goes for solos though, as there are some games with solos where your team mates are great, and there are others where your team mates just aren't. Maybe because they just aren't as good at the game or aren't trying as hard. But either way I kinda think it's a decently fair coin toss.
---
Why? I'd rather see someone with a different view than someone who just posts what the majority of the player base thinks
---
Don’t you still reload even if the survivor is in the locker? Like when you pick them up it refills
---
As a killer or survivor? 
---
Pig and Hag, always feels like i've got a challenge, but not very frustrating
---
the point of the perk is to tell you if a survivor has tapped the generator after you kicked it. Trouble is, it doesn't actually come with an alert, just that it glows white until the timer runs out or someone touches it. So the only way you get value is if you kick a gen and then walk away while still looking at the generator, and count in your head to make sure you interpret the colour returning to normal as just time running out or a survivor touching it because the perk doesn't distinguish the two.
---
I don’t have an update but here’s my advice, Sony and Bhvr don’t work well together for whatever reason so in situations like this plan what you’re going to do the dlc wasn’t gonna go on sale until after the bp event
---
I know but people complain about The Game in particular for apparently having very difficult totem spawns. Just funny to see the map most associated with having hard spawns having one show up literally right next to the survivor starting location.
---
Shit, u right.
---
I know, I was just riffing on the fact that The Game is usually considered to have some of, if not the most difficult totems to find.
---
Yeah, I was surprised about how much I learned just from playing killer after being a survivor main for a while. Flashlights and SWF were the first thing I noticed.
---
Self Care just recently got nerfed along with
---
healing overall. Imagine a game where as killer survivor hook dived YOU every Match as 3 people, and everytime you landed a hit in a game it didn't matter because they could self care heal in the time it took you to catch up / break pallets 
---
Omg gg! Left the key at the hatch, smart play!
---
I've always seen it being a coin toss however. While there are definitely killers that are underpowered (Looking at you, Freddy) Killers do quite generally have ways to be on the same level as survivors, depending on the build and how good they are at the killer. A great example is the nurse, as a good nurse can completely annhilate survivors without breaking a sweat. I've kinda always seen it as more of a case of skill of killers vs skill of survivors, as imo the killers do require more skill then survivors do, but the pay off is very good for killers when they do excel at whatever killer they're playing.
---
They actually had franklins demise and smacked me the first time I tried to go through lol!

---
It's not bannable, but I see that if the survivors know what they are doing, they won't go near the hook. You might get 1 grab with m&amp;a/insidious, but survivors will know that you are camping the hook after that. I've seen that in situations like this, survivors will just do all the gens, unless they are completely clueless about you camping. 
---
“S E V E N T E E N ! ! !”
---
To an extent yes but that's debatable because beginning of the match people may be cleansing totems or running killer around or looting chests. There isnt an obscene amount of stuff to do in the matches but I feel theres enough to where gen rushing is a strategy and does exist. But I do know what you mean
---
Well tbf people do run ridiculous distances when you unhook them sometimes to point where I just don’t even bother healing them anymore because I could’ve already healed them twice over if they didn’t decide to run across the map to a corner
---
I said "like", I wasn't calling you a lunatic. How about you read the full comment before going at someone? You grow up. I already said what my point was two comments ago and I won't repeat myself now. None of what you said is my point. 
---
When would we be able to play
---
Knock Out is a perk that's good on paper but in execution it's pretty bad because (1) you could get a small map and (2) SWF with mics counters it. 
---
Added transcripts!
---
And what if that person finds 4k-ing fun? Not everybody finds the same thing fun. Besides, once again, your suggestions do exactly nothing for the actual standoff itself.
---
Why does he have the vault boy face lol
---
You have ascended.
---
By that logic, Spirit Fury isn't the perk getting rid of the pallet, it's you. Yeah, I'm not buying that.
---
This Fire Up rework is weak, but could easily become OP if tweaked.
---
Be quiet, the killer might hear you.
---
I also use fire up 1 on my level 1 freddy when i have a freddy daily. I feel like it just gives more value than his other level 1 unique perks yanno?
---
That's been out for awhile now
---
If you watch the video, a solid dozen killers had the obvious incentive to kill No0b3 and do nothing else. 
---
No but it is loud and they'd hear you doing it if they were nearby. 
---
appropriate reaction towards playing against legion
---
Damn I fucked up with the title
---
Nah the big issue in our house is keys. My husband played killer for a few hours last night and at least 7 or 8 of those games, the last two people found the hatch and dipped. Its happening to me too, but I couldn’t believe how many games got thrown last second for him because of that. It’s out of hand. 
---
What happens in their forums? I do believe you tbh. 
---
The stick is Behaviour
---
No because it’s not a “mandatory” perk in the slightest. Bond, Empathy, and Aftercare all outclass it imo. If everyone had self care innately, it would slow the game down much more because everyone will be slowly healing themselves instead of repairing gens or finding other to heal them
---
Leather face isnt aa bad as some people think, you dont have to camp or anything to have fun with him, he is the only licensed killer with some cosmetics to him, and bbq and chili is great
---
but spirit fury with enduring is great
---
Tru3 uses OP add ons and calls Legion viable. Nothing good about that
---
I just saw it and came to tell, maybe someone hasnt seen it and now did, idk
---
I mean...Santa Clown...
---
Yeah im sorry
---
Play the game consistently with all killers in high ranked, play survivor in first ranks, have at least 1k hours in the game and then come back and talk
---
I refer to it as mandatory because 9/10 times at rank one, I see survivors equipped with it. If I see a survivor without it, they are usually the ones that are more susceptible to dying. Unless they are a part of a strong SWF group, then fair enough. Being able to heal yourself straight away is always a strong tool. I like the effects of other perks, but I find it hard to go without Self Care. 
---
Dang survivors wanting to survive
---
No camping is not bannable. Just unfun for the person your camping.
---
It has been happening to me too but I quite like it , it makes the gens more complex than just holding a button and looking around , of course an impossible skillcheck build would be horrible but I think it is ok .
---
NO U
---
I believe the DBD dev gave them permission and even helped developed it too 
---
He's stated in the past that killers need great add ons to compete.
---
dbd devs know abt it and i think helped with it :0
---
actually there is one donate where guy informs no0b about statment (here on reddit?) "kill him before he reach 50 in row, 50 dollars reward. by any means necessary"
---
Try BBQ on Billy
---
You cant get gen rushed if you kill them fast enough.
---
The only issue would be getting that first hook to snowball for the rest of the march
---
On one hand dedicated servers will put a stop to this. On the other hand it might break mlga and the billy can just stand on top of your slugger body while you bleed out, and you'd never be able to prevent playing with him again.
---
You could flip that right around and say that there are no good survivors  only survivors that escape because they capitalize on killer mistakes.
---
Buying time earlier gives the same effect, im just relying on NOED which is worse since they can cleanse it but its a lot easier
---
vag? What the fuck is that?
---
I don’t mind Pallet Looping. I don’t mind Window Looping. I don’t mind 360’s, hiding, lockers, anything.
---
The moment you start teabagging/bad mannering I quit. Because it shows that in order to have fun, you need to ruin mine. Don’t be a dickhead and maybe you won’t be so susceptible to Facecamping or Killers leaving.
---
Just like you, I’m trying to have fun. I don’t care if you blatantly out-play me, I respect the skill and effort. Teabagging and being toxic is something I don’t want to play against, so I’ll leave or delete you from the game. Whichever is easier.
---
The biggest isue I have with the traps, really, is that whenever I get caught in them as a survivor, 9 out of 10 times I can't escape from them even if the Trapper is across the map. However, whenever I'm playing Trapper it seems that all survivorw can escape their trap in 2 or 3 tries and sonetimes even in one when I'm close.
---
Devour hope.  Once you get 3 hooks you start snowballing the game hardcore.  
---
There was even a bounty out for him on reddit. To stop him whatever it takes. 
---
I keep seeing the Nea joke, where did it come from?
---
Pallet Looping is fine, it’s a time-stall mechanic and I understand it’s part of the game.
---
Teabagging and trying to get a rise out of me, essentially ruining the fun for me isn’t okay. I’ll quit with zero hesitation, I do not care.
---
yeah alright it's not you then who's gonna do the murdering
---
Sorry I’m this petty 😂
---
4 dc's in the span of a minute, but they all stayed for a little chat afterwards
---
I resisted lvling Bubba because I was hoping for bbq in shrine. I finally gave in. Watch it being in the shrine in a few hours. 
---
Her cosmetics make her look horrifying some times just like a killer hence the joke
---
If I message one of the survivors and convince them to sell their friends out and I'll let them go, is that being a good killer? I think most people would agree not, because I didn't do anything very impressive, the survivor just threw.
---
What is wrong with people playing the side that they prefer?
---
Yes lmao...I never drew the comparison to the past and now. you are right on, it's all of legions issues 
---
That's Tyde in a nutshell
---
Legions add-ons doesn't make him good only less shit. 
---
I don’t use self care on any of my survivors. Not a mandatory perk imo.
---
I never ever met a Quentin. 
---
You could but it’s mainly in the survivors hands, killers mistakes are more costly than survivors. Wasn’t shitting on anyone it’s just the way the game is, it’s still brought up a lot. 
---
I can agree with that
---
I don't personally use self care anymore because I find it way more fun to play with gimmick builds or experimenting with different perks. Although I mainly play solo 8/10 times I can hold my own.
---
I hope you try to meme, cause they are nowhere near the same 
---
Da fuq
---
You still have to be good to punish the mistakes survivors make though. 
---
No, when it's lit up it means a gate is open. It does not tell you if the exit is blocked
---
How about you not attack someone for stating their opinion? I remember asking a question or two and you completely ignored them in your reply. If my reply came across as "ranting like a lunatic" then you have your own issues and obviously don't know what a discussion is. I can see as much since you just replied to me with basically "no u".
---
Eh, i don't care about either.
---
I think we can all agree you need to be smeared across the road by an 18 wheeler if you play legion, though.
---
And not nearly enough furrowed brow.
---
I laughed like the Doctor does to this. Idk why this is so funny.
---
There's really no point in having a unique barrier, but there should be a timer like everything else has

Don't be fooled. He's just a regular Jake Park with a stupid cheap hat.
---
Oh I’m so thirsty!!
---
Whenever I bring in multiple totems, I litteraly use them as beacons that draw survivors in. Survivors think that getting the totem is worth their life and will waste minutes tryinh to cleanse it if thats what it takes to destroy it. It's very funny when I use haunted grounds + thrill of the hunt and the survivors throw their whole being into destroying these totems

I’d be one of em

K, next

Imagine thinking being allowed to leave, and not just that but helped by the killer, means you escaped lmao
---
This wasn't meant to be NSFW at all... 
---
&gt;My question is... what do the pins do? I don't understand what they mean by decreasing power depletion.
---
When you use a regular attack and successfully hit a Survivor you lose your entire Bar for Frenzy so you have to wait until it recharges if you want to use it. The pins reduce how much bar you lose from a successful regular attack so your bar has to recharge less before you can activate Frenzy.
---
&gt;Also, what is the difference between Frenzy cooldown duration
---
I'm pretty sure Cooldown Duration means how long Legion is stunned when Frenzy ends so the better the Reduced Cooldown Duration the less time you'll be stunned for when Frenzy ends.
---
&gt;Frenzy gauge recharging faster? I've noticed no delay when Frenzy runs out and starts to recharge.
---
Same as Spirit's addons that make her power recharge faster, your bar will just recharge faster than usual.
---
Doesn't console run at "stable" 30 now? Instead of the 15-20fps mess.
---
I mean tbh DbD should run 60 no problem on console. Fortnite runs at 60 without issues and DbD looks worse than it and is a way smaller game too. Performance is just awful on both console and PC for DbD.
---
No it's not. You're fine, don't worry. It may not be fun for them to play against, but as a Hag who does nothing but 3-gen, I know damn well that a smart and aggressive group can break that shit up FAST. That's why as a survivor it's important not to let a tight 3 gen develop in the first place :) It's on them to keep it from happening, and on them to deal with it if it does happen!
---
Keep up the 3-gen strats sista!
---
Removed - Offtopic
---
You broke them as the "worst" killer, so who's the worse one, hmm?~
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
The problem with killers is they're base kits with no addons are usually hot trash if they reworked everyone's kit to be viable with no addons and just kept addons effects up to yellow tier the game would be overall more balanced for the killers and there wouldn't be nearly as huge as a gap in power between them
---
&gt;console 
---
&gt;stable
---
Pick 1.
---
But he has a new hat!
---
Short for vagina dude lol
---
A "stable" 30 is about right. Playing as a survivor, using Lithe or getting hit with Sloppy Butcher kills the game a bit; as killer, being Legion or hitting someone with a hatchet as Huntress that gives any type of status has the same effect.
---
we all would

Ruin is a heavily overrated placebo, and I'm glad to see other people turn away from it.
---
I don't think there's a \*consistent\* alternative that works on all killers, but I'll post a few perksets which I like to use.
---
Billy: Knockout/Whispers, Spirit Fury, BBQ and Enduring
---
Nurse: Knockout/Whispers, Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn and BBQ
---
Wraith: Spirit Fury, Enduring, Sloppy and BBQ
---
Trapper: Monitor &amp; Abuse/Spirit Fury, Nurse's, Sloppy and Enduring
---
Doctor: Sloppy, Brutal Strenght/Spirit Fury/STBFL, Enduring and BBQ
---
Huntress: Knockout, Sloppy/Whispers, BBQ and Nurse's
---
Freddy: Enduring, Sloppy, Knockout and NOED
---
Hag: STBFL, Knockout, Nurse's and MaA. Or MYC, Rancor, Agi and STBFL. 
---
Leatherface: Enduring, MaA, BBQ and Spirit Fury/Nurse's/Whispers
---
Myers: Knockout, Enduring, BBQ and MaA. 
---
Spirit: Bloodhound, BBQ, Rancor and MYC/Whispers/Sloppy (bloodhound feels surprisingly nice on spirit)
---
Clown: BBQ, STBFL (or knockout with pinky finger), Sloppy and Enduring. 
---
1. not a notification, but it is VERY loud.
---
2. Sometimes people just wanna be nice or go easy on folks. Everyone plays differently, but me for example: if they played really well and really smart but I still got them, I might let them go just to show appreciation. Or not! ;) 
---
3. Base time to transition into dream is 7 seconds I think, which is a pretty long time. That can be reduced with addons of course. As for counterplay, in general: Be aggressive. There is only so much he can do, and you can snap back awake pretty quickly if you have self care or are near a gen where you can fail a skill check. Focus on staying awake, don't let yourself stay asleep! I'm no expert at playing against him either, but those are things that I find to be helpful.
---
Np
---
You want to start running as soon as you start falling asleep. Look for a pallet if possible, and be ready to drop it if you see Freddy right on your tail. He can always see your aura in the dream world if you're outside his terror radius, and the only guaranteed method of waking up is having a friend do it, so sometimes you just have to run. It's worth taking the opportunity to try a generator or self care if he's far away, though.
---
I want to stress that you should not rescue survivors if Freddy is nearby; just because he takes a moment to be able to hit people, that does NOT mean that it's a free getaway. Survivors can be put back to sleep in the middle of the unhook animation, and Freddy is easily capable of just following them until they're hittable anyway. I see this all the time while playing Freddy. 
---
Just started playing Freddy and I was doing actually rather well like really well. Not until I started getting closer to rank 1..... 
---
half of the issue with the playerbase of this game is that players are generally "mains" of one side (typically survivor, since its group friendly).   
---
In 100% of the games you play, you will be playing with survivors and killers. Knowing both roles, in and out, will help you tremendously throughout the entire game, no matter what role you're playing for the day. 
---
Exactly, i just wish it was consistent. Especially when the stakes are so high (being hooked).
---
Just play super gimicky builds that are bound to make you lose. No blink nurse with bamboozle or myers with tombstone and scratched mirror are examples.
---
Don't take any add ons to start with you don't want it messing with your muscle memory. Practice your blinks, blink close to the them and then blink right on them, don't lunge if  you don't have to this will add 1 second of fatigue. You will get shit on by survivors at first and for a while until you get a grasp of what your doing. After 100+ hours you should be able to hold your ground pretty well. Tires are your **WORST** enemy as a nurse so if you can avoid blinking near them do so. Takes perk like Stridor, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, and Lightborn if you need help tracking survivors when you come out of fatigue. Stridor will help you hear them better while their crying out in pain, bloodhound will help you follow their blood a lot easier, sloppy butcher will make them bleed more frequently making it near impossible to lose them, and Lightborn makes it so you have a wider area of view so you can see survivors in the distance better. You can replace these perk with whatever you want but that's the build that helped me learn Nurse a lot better and had a much easier time with it. Final tip, **don't get discouraged.** Have fun!
---
There are tier lists and meta stuff and all that, but I am not really knowledgeable about that side of things, I just play for the shits n giggles so MY advice is to dick around with a bunch of killers and see what you like best!! I love playing Hag &lt;3
---
While three of them where fixing last generator forth decided to take my Haunted Ground NEXT TO THEM..., few seconds later they had privilege of me playing jingle bells and other songs of my people until they bled out. 
---
Happy new year! (I let last one take hatch just for kicks)
---
No, it isn't. The survivors were either dumb, uncoordinated,  or both. You used that to your advantage and it worked.  They just can't accept that. 
---
I know a streamer that has 142 on his main, the nurse! 
---
Unique Moris would be cool as well
---
I mean they looked like they were having a blast. 
---
Fantastic!
---
Care to elaborate?I never seen this bug.
---
Sarcasm my dood... Sarcasm -_-
---
If you’re camping early game when there’s an opportunity to find other survivors you should just stop playing killer because you get no points. I only camp if 
---
-I see survivors swarming the hook
---
-Gate is open by hooked survivor 
---
If I don’t have any special addons I’ll camp survivors that teabag too much or hook farm other survivors without borrowed time. 
---
Oh, alright, thank you!!
---
RIP Irridescent King

"Here's the Killer buff you all asked for" 
---
-The devs
---
Don’t DC because it ruins the game for everyone. I always tell people the only way to get better as survivors is to be chased. Hiding and working on gens won’t make you better. Same with killer. If you’re only going after easy targets you’ll never get better. Practice mind games, figure out safe and unsafe pallets etc. i was always a survivor main but playing as killer improved my survivor skills since I have an idea what the killer can and can’t see. Also some survivors are good and you can learn some good loops. I see so many rank 1 survivors who don’t even look behind them because it’s to easy to rankup especially since so many people are playing due to double bp. If 4 swf join your lobby bring a mori and noad lol
---
That was me with a flashlight behind u all game 
---
With nipple tassles
---
That's so unfair
---
Blind the killer and yourself and your entire team for those extra bps to buy more.
---
It is indeed 
---
100
---
Y E S
---
I know, thats the joke
---
I mean you get a free hook out of it. Doesn't seem so bad to me
---
Holy maccaroni man
---
Extremely... For solo survivors... Right...
---
Yeah but then again the killer had the option to kill him and the reason they didn't might be cause they now it is a streamer. I call this the titty effect, basically if a good looking girl asks for something to someone they are very likely to get it. Same with streamers, Noob3 a well know DBD personality will be greeted friednly and treated differently by players in the game. 
---
So for gen rushing;
---
Ruin for sure, sometimes it'll get taken out immediately but even if it's only up for 1 minute it's doing it's job for you.
---
But honestly with the way Legion is currently designed, he can't stop gen rush or exert any map control or pressure. So going for killing people fast as you can is best. Run Ruin, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, BBQ, etc.
---
Could have just said nothing at all 
---
Thats not how dedicated servers work

---
What’s with the mask?
---
I mean it’s the default tbh. I haven’t really changed anything and I have the original PS4 
---
What does this have to do with my comment
---
Imo they should remove that blood dark screen is fine but that blood men i can't see through it
---
That's the mask with this outfit
---
I'd be fine being chased by Susie
---
Oh yeah your right, forgot there were four of them 
---
👉😎👉
---
More Dwights.
---
Geek right
---
Just me and the killer, gladly he was nice enough to let me go
---
Okay
---
He saw her go there. What is he supposed to do? Let the last survivor quickly go and unhook her friend and then continue on with the game?
---
You must be incredibly bad if you can't catch someone running those perks as killer eventually. 
---
He uses regular green tier addons tho? Not even Frank's Mix Tape or Stab Wounds Study.
---
But... the normal human eye is not even able to discern more than 70 fps. So there'll be no visual difference for you at all, except maybe screen tearing.
---
I would settle for constant fps as of now. Having a fluid skill check gauge on one map and then a choppy one while looking in another direction is kinda annoying.
---
I neither agree nor disagree with that point of view. I think he's correct that we shouldn't judge Killers by their baseline power, but we also shouldn't be fine with a baseline power being ass because we'll "just use addons 4head."
---
It will only impress me if its perkless and the escape is through the doors. THAT is worthy of a record.
---
yeah i see you're a dwight main. so what's life in the closet like?
---
After everyone left she actually let me pallet slam her a couple of times and she gave me the hatch. It started when she was chasing someone and she suddenly saw me at a pallet. She moved as if saying 'no' and I just walked away and so did she. Whenever I encountered her I just walked instead of ran to remain in her favor 
---
Yes you did the right thing, I am not questioning that
---
Goes both ways honestly but I’m playing too much Red Dead Redemption 2 rn so RIP DBD on my PC and PS4 
---
Seeing as it's the remake Freddy, I think he actually did us a favor.
---
Lol the thirst is real. Ill be able to mori approximately 300 lucky survivors that crave the attention of daddy Myers.
---
I'm questioning that this game should have let her unhook the hooked survivor, before she got grabbed
---
We Quentins are a close-knit community, occasionally finding time to do gens when we're not getting our 10000th medkit or clapping in each other's faces
---
Looks like hes about to dribble her between his legs.
---
I would recommend also picking a character with perks that you like. As you level up that character to a high enough level, you can eventually teach their perks to other survivors.
---
For example, Dwight has perks that allow you to do things faster when other are close. Claudette has perks based around healing, along with even healing yourself. If you like one of those more than the other, persue that character. Just graze through everyone and pick one you think is good.
---
Also, be sure to take the time to read those perks closely to make sure you like them. There are even perks that go with everyone right at the start such as borrowed time, you just have to get them in the bloodweb. 
---
There are also perks that can be bought in the store for shards (the currency you get when you level up), so keep an eye out for those as well. If you buy one from there, it becomes teachable for every other character, even if you don't own them. This can be found in the shrine of secrets.
---
TL;DR pick someone you like with perks you like, and check the shrine of secrets every week
---
Legion ^^^^^sorry ^^^^^Legion ^^^^^mains
---
I have to main Jake since I have Legacy 1 on him. I used to be such a fucking Jake too. Good ol' Broken Sabo III, when no hooks are left but the basement.
---
What. I'm not a fucking Dwight main Jesus Christ. EWWWWWW. Also it's not bad. Sometimes I want to suck my homeboy's dick but I restrain myself since I'm in a releationship. You know, peachy.
---
I am beginning to think the only way to really enjoy DBD anymore is to play killer. Teabagging doesnt bother me (and it really shouldnt bother anyone), and as the killer I have control over how the game goes. I try to hook everyone twice before I kill anyone (unless Im getting utterly destroyed, like 1 gen left and 1 or 2 hooks total). Sure I get annihilated by 4 man swf squads, but I also get annihilated by tunneling killers just as easy and they are far more common than a 4 man all star team.  Ive played probably 50 games of survivor this week in a 2 man with my wife, and Id guess 2/3rds of those games the killer has been sweaty as hell. A few of them are outright bragging about playing like assholes in the lobby chat.
---
A part of me wants to be a zubatlel level talent with angrypug level bm'ing, but I dont have the time and/or skill to be that good at survivor.
---
We weren't talking about Hex perks
---
Calm down. Im sure you arent that good at the game either.
---
That would be literally impossible, especially as a streamer like No0b3 where people are purposefully tunneling you with insta-down mori builds.
---
I honestly wouldn’t mind the option to get alternate Moris with shards or cells.
---
Bro.
---
Im confused whats wrong with sloppy butcher?
---
Same, it's really unfair how the bug is getting taken advantage of by basically all Wraiths
---
You were saying that perks created only to counter other perks shouldn't exist. Them being hex perks have nothing to do with it
---
And thats why it would be impressive.
---
Oh damn do I know you?
---
I'm certainly not the best survivor in the game but I'm definitely not bad either. Maybe instead of just jumping to conclusions, don't say anything? 
---
Exactly 
---
Ditto
---
Although that’s clearly wrong I think Leatherface gets a bit too much shit sometimes.
---
Listen here you little shit
---
Exactly this. I understand being cautious, but if you are going to run to the other side of the map while leaving a trail of blood and moans, I'm just going to leave you and let you fend for yourself. Use common sense.
---
All you have to do is leave the lobby after game. 100% guaranteed to work every single time.
---
Yah no I read it right. I'm sorry you dont understand my comment. 
---
But this is not a dank memes page but dead by daylight related page. Not sure what you’re trying to prove here. 
---
Darn, did I r/woooosh myself?
---
Yep, same. I don’t often dc but as soon as I see this combo I’m out, I’m not gonna play with cheaters.
---
So because one joke was once used in another reddit means I can't use it here?
---
Shrugs...
---
New to killer; I have a 15 Huntrrss, 5 Billy and 5... Wraith? I bought all Liscensed killers on Steam Sale, and decided "Double BP Event...better work on getting BBQ teachable." So I play Bubba.
---
First Web? NOED. Second web? First ever Mori. I am now sitting on like 13 moris with Bubba and I am rather enjoying Basement Bubba.
---
Insidious basement build you’ll derank quick enough and no one will be too toxic.
---
Run monstrous shrine/insidious/territorial imperative and people will assume it’s legit but really your de ranking and every now and then you’ll get a 3-4k for fun.
---
Wraith or Freddy to be completely invisible 
---
There is no argument.  The side who is most willing to trade is in the right.  I guarantee you'll find more survivors willing to give up D-strike than killers willing to give up NOED, even when comparing per capita.
---
Gatsby DLC
---
Found the rank 20 survivor main.
---
That's a little inconsiderate to assume they are trying to prove anything. 
---
I love these types of posts, crying about bans when they clearly violated the rules, then they proceed to be assholes.
---
I think only the developers would be able to give you real numbers on that. It's all very situational and depends entirely on what is going on at the moment, in my experience!
---
Well thats the con of being a well known streamer. 
---
yes pls daddy
---
I want to upvote but this has 420 points
---
"thedankdwight" made me assume
---
Well it's like 50/50 either they get greeted with tryhards or nice killers
---
I mean look DBD is great but Red Dead Revolver and Red Dead Redemption 1 are 2 of my favorite games of all time so yea DBD can wait 
---
I'm not playing against a killer who just slugs and stars at me the entire match. Sorry you're a little bitch boy, and you get blocked and dodged. 
---
&gt;Doctor's power basically doesn't do anything without addons
---
It's funny to me that you think this
---
“Unnecessary”
---
level up david for dead hard
---
I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still going to follow it up with the obligatory: "last game the killer kill rushed me.". The phrase 'gen rushing' implies that this is something that survivors do which makes the game bad for the killer, when it is literally the goal of the game.  You can't call it gen rushing because it implies survivors are doing something bad.  You can complain that gens are too quickly completed for you to ever win, but if that's the case, then change your playstyle instead of blaming survivors for playing the game.
---
You keep responding to me so here we are. You lack awareness and cognitive thinking if you believe my comment was unrelated. I compared a situation where a killer would be punished by depletion of points to your instance of a survivor being punished for taking the hatch. Like I said, you attacked me as if you were a 15 year old child just because I didn't agree with you. Grow up and I  hope you have a nice break from high school.
---
Ehhh I'm already spending a shit ton of ponts on Nea but is DH even worth it?
---
I can only really answer #2. If you want to play different characters and have perks for them, yeah, you’ll have to go through the bloodweb. But, I kind of cheat the system. I leveled up Meg as far as I needed her and played her to get bloodpoints, then dumped them all into Nea. It saved the hassle of playing a character with weak or no perks. 
---
Nah solo, i have the original screen shot still, whats your name?
---
Huge blood gush animation from the hit never stops, makes you incredibly easy to see everywhere and drains frames.
---
They've been banning people left and right for critisicm. Not over the too, but not that offensive either.
---
Its just funny how when people talk about the developers inaction or seemingly indifferent attitude, they can ban pretty quick.
---
When it comes to all the scummy shit that goes on in the game though, they seem unwilling and incapable of doing anything.
---
The fact is the "come and bully killers" mentality appeals to a lot of people and Behaviour know this, thats why they won't change it. Because the ochido kind of audience eats it up and keeps the money rolling in.
---
Looks pretty cool.
---
This is just a weird way to look at anything.  I kinda see what your trying to say but its not accurate for everyone.  People play at all different skill levels and your just simplifying the game from a top tier player perspective,  not everyone plays at that level.  To just try to nullify someone winning a game because you see the scales tipped in their favor or against is bonkers.  And regardless of what anyone thinks if you succeed at doing something then you deserved it.  That is how a lot of things can be simplified.  I can capitalize on mistakes someone makes in chess but i still had the skill to capitalize on them.  This sort of thinking leads to nothing good.  People who think like this go through life with excuses for everything that happens to them or others.  They only got a degree because they had easy classes, they only got promoted because they are a suck up.  I get that you said you aren't trying to cause hate but this comment literally is saying you are never able to posses skill as a killer which is just trying to diminish peoples skill which is pretty demeaning.
---
That you arent using moris enough. Get out there and eat some megs.
---
I think even a small buff would put him solidly in mid tier, maybe like the 8th best killer or so.
---
The thing about him is you have to choose out of 3 strategies: comboing with speed/duration addons and then looping/stealthing for M1s, stalking outside of chase with DW speed addons, or straight out downing with DW using Frank's.
---
All of them are terrible without the addons to support them, so against good survivors you don't really have any flexibility in game after choosing what strategy you're going with.
---
FYI you dont have to play Bubba to level him up.
---
True Monto is the main guy that gets 100% tryhards 
---
&gt; they want to believe it's because the game is stacked against them.
---
I'll agree that plenty of shit killers exist on this subreddit, just the same as shit survivors, but killers have legitimate issues in terms of power as compared to survivors. The game *is* stacked against killers due to map design, perks, and SWF coordination. I know it's trendy to circle jerk and bash killers around here, especially if they play defensively in any fashion to increase their odds of victory, but if you can say with a straight face that killers don't have the game stacked against them with how incredibly powerful survivors are, then you need your eyes checked.
---
Ahaha!! I know the feeling of having to tip-toe around friendly killers
---
One of the best killers is able to kill people with a bad killer, that's surprising. The biggest problem with Legion isn't that he's bad, it's that he's extremely unfun to play as and against because his power removes almost all skill from chases for both sides.  If Legion decides you're dead, you're fucking dead and there's not a single thing you can do about it even if the killer's bad because he's pretty much unescapable if he just slowly frenzies you down.
---
I had a freddy tell I was stupid after he hit me the first time the match with sb and was teleported to the other side of the door and of course he killed me because everyone else left. I told him about it and he blamed me for lagging and having bad internet. 😂
---
No. It mans that the fact it was used there means it was appropriate there but doesn’t have to necessarily be appropriate here?

They’re venting for a reason.

I could go on. To say he only uses green tier add ons is a bold faced lie.

Just because they're badly designed doesn't eat there's anything wrong with enjoying them.

The only issue is lack of balance with SWF.
---
Vooshy was the one carrying all those games anyway. 
---
I love spirit grabs!
---
Easy just use the keyboard and controller 
---
People already hate swfs because they can communicate. Adding it to solo would make killers unplayable at high ranks because of every survivor communicating with each other.
---
Lmao, a simile? You are really ignorant. You obviously want the last word because you keep messaging me? I was in no way rude to you when I first responded but then you decided to act like a toddler. Also, as expected, you are in high school. Grow up.
---
I have been playing the game for over a year now. I have way too many hours on this game. You’re build for meg as of now is not bad. 
---
This is the build I use that has proven time after time to be the most successful:
---
Urban evasion
---
Decisive strike
---
Self care
---
Adrenaline
---
Adrenaline has proven over and over again to be one of the most useful perks out there. Decisive strike will save you a hook every game as long as you hit the skill check. Self care is just amazing when you can’t find anyone on your team to heal you. Urban evasion is wonderful for stealth!
---
There is nothing better then when a killer picks you up and at the same time the last generator goes off, and you hit that skill check for decisive strike. Boom you escaped the killer and you’re fully Healed.
---
Solo play is an entirely different experience than SWF. Everyone is paranoid. Everyone has been fucked over by a stupid teammate who tried to heal them under the hook, failed a skillcheck and then started Urban Evading away while the killer’s heartbeat grew closer. We’ve all seen hatch campers who are scared to touch a gen, three teammates crouching around you while the killer camps, people who will fast vault over nearby windows to draw the killer towards you because you started cleansing a totem they wanted, and the infamous hook farmers. 
---
Solo play makes people play like idiots because they’re jaded enough to assume the rest of their team is idiots. With no way to communicate, it’s understandable. In SWF you both 100% know that it’s safe to heal because the killer is occupied, but chances are in solo play they don’t have that information and you have no way to relay it. 
---
Cute &lt;3
---
Never heard about that did that happen on stream?
---
I think the doctor because he doesn't *really* have to go looking for survivors he can just spam the shock treatment, and on top of that if you hang around his terror radius too long you're gonna get given up anyway.
---
But one way or the other a large amount of people would get angry and behavior is exactly on the best of terms to make their fanbase even more angry at them
---
Use MLGA
---
Agree
---
awesome idea if you ask me.

also a lot of players prefer playing killer because they get more bloodpoints in general. this change would also fix queues a bit if you ask me because survivors have more incentive to play because they could get more bloodpoints easier.
---
It could be made so that you can talk in game chat if you’re a certain distance close to another survivor, but once the distance is past a certain point you can no longer communicate- like a realistic mechanic
---
seconded. also increase bloodpoints for survivors. it's really hard to max out survival category for example. also give all survivors like 500 bloodpoints when a generator is repaired (like it was with event gens).
---
They will not remove swf from the game because many players can't pl... don't like to play without friends. Just let the killer know it's swf and give him more bloodpoints for it I guess.
---
That makes sense. They all sound good, but I only have money for one, hence why I asked the community. Thank you for your input!
---
survivor is fun btw 
---
Not even close. Map tiles and loops are a massive issue, and have been for quite some time, but unfortunately the issue is far too complex to quickly fix. Whatever the case may be, if you're not playing billy, nurse, or spirit, you're in for a bad time, and you had better damn well be running ruin and hope survivors don't find it instantly or just power through it. Survivors have far too many tools at their disposal to keep the killer in an endless carrot-on-a-stick situation. 
---
Thematically, killers are supposed to be this unstoppable force that you try to run away from as long as possible before eventually succumbing to them. As it currently stands, killers are punching bags to create montages with while survivors run from pallet-filled tile to pallet-filled tile while every generator on the map goes up. 
---
Killers have far more issues facing them than SWF. I find it hard to believe that's the only issue you see.
---
The same problem I don't think there is a solution other than praying BW does something... Yeah no hope.
---
And when they finish the rest of the gens and escape as 3 - surprised pikatchu.
---
I wonder if survivors are able to spot you much easier 
---
absolutely agree with you!
---
You madman wasting so much bloodpoints.
---
yeah I'm sure if survivors would get more bloodpoints in general, there would be more people playing survivor and thus fixing killer queues.
---
This was already posted and gained a lot of upvotes a few days ago. 
---
that lags the game..a lot,and you can’t Run or Crouch
---
This would help the people that killers tunnel also. not that I get tunneled a lot but would have people complain less about killers tunneling (maybe)
---
Self Care, BL, Deciesive, and Borrowed Time/Adrenaline on Jakes 90's Skin 
---
Now get 100 JM memorials because this add-on is pretty bad without it xd
---
use it
---
I got from level 1 to level 24 of leatherface, 9 ebony out of boxes. 
---
What is this, a video for ants?
---
(Or maybe things are just messed up on my end...?)
---
Ultra rare, btw!
---
Yes. When a perk becomes so core in competitive builds, I think it should just be incorporated into the base kit in some form or another. Two that really come to mind for DBD are self-care and ruin.
---
No, just had to record it in such a stupid way to upload it, my apologies!
---
Camping tends to happen less as you become a better ranked survivor. But facecamping could happen if the killer is angry at you. Lets say you teabagged at a pallet once you stuned him with it and now while he breaks the pallet you flashlight blind him over and over. For some reason that is considered 'toxic' and if killers know you are capable of doing this they could make sure you are killed to get rid of the nusiance even at the sacrifice of a gen or two. 
---
You can try thanatophobia with sloppy and add save the best for last or monitor and abuse. I find these perks well for legion, of course there are more but I haven’t had the chance to try any other perks out 
---
I like that reduced noise range of technician the most. 
---
I saying that the killers are so bad that there rank 2000 
---
I never said he always uses Green or below, but you're also implying that he *only* uses high tier addons.
---
Hi I'm TydeTyme and Leatherface is B tier also Hag is D tier and I don't use her traps.
---
Bro
---
Yeah, but he's so much fun!
---
One basement hook turns into two basement hooks far too often. ;)
---
Bro!
---
&gt;The fact is the "come and bully killers" mentality appeals to a lot of people and Behaviour know this, thats why they won't change it. Because the ochido kind of audience eats it up and keeps the money rolling in.
---
Ha that reminds me of a big baby streamer I like to face. I'm starting to think it is on us as killer mains to identify and bully these certain people back. Though I dunno if this will be possible after dedicated servers. 
---
When you see people complain about SWF even though its the only thing keeping a percent of the survivor community in the game
---
Damn how many points did you put into Claudette?
---
Ebony moris. How to ruin a game before it starts. 
---
Toxic survivors smh...
---
Unfortunately, a single long chase isn't good. You wanna try to break it after about a minute to grind the emblem.
---
Im just playing him from event offerings, his chainsaw is great.
---
exactly! Thats why I mentioned that you get tokens if other survivors do gens. So if you get tunneled all game and the other survivors manage to get all of the gens and you escape you get at least 8 tokens (10 if you stun the killer twice) which would be fair in my opinion!
---
The devs should really make it harder to pip. It's way too easy to rank up with the current system. I got rank 1 survivor the first month I played the game. To be fair a played a lot of swf but still that's insane.
---
It's just an example from two days ago that I pulled out of my ass. I don't dodge them but I'd like to know if I'm facing 3/4 streamers who've changed their names to get games.
---
There's plenty of streamers/survivor mains who've developed reputations so toxic that they choose to hide their names or create smurf accounts. 
---
OP grabbed really early on in the animation, so I'd say that it was rather fair that the grab took place
---
multiple chases, legion refused to leave me the fuck alone, i also ran to gens that were being fixed by 2 or 3 survivors and legion just decided to ignore that.
---
Anyone else incredibly tired of playing against legion every single game? 
---
Dude, how much time did that cost you? Dedication at it's finest. 
---
When in the chase, hit someone with frenzy (and unless you have Frank’s Mixtape) come up right behind them and cancel frenzy. If you do it right next to them by the time your cool down is over you should be able to hit them. Now there are a few exceptions, like I said if you have Franks mixtape just hit them again, or if they’re by a pallet or window. Usually you want to do this in an open area to avoid those obstacles. 
---
For survivor I run pebble so I know when the killer is getting closer to me and I always pay attention until I know them so I know it’s not a wraith. As killer I just suffer knowing that my audio isn’t gonna be any help so I’m planning to get bloodhound or the scratch mark one. I’m not hard of hearing I’m just sort of sensitive to loud sounds and I like to watch stuff while I play so I’ve got a earphone in my right ear as well we headphones on. I think more visual cues could be a good addition to the game 
---
Save the Best for Last and Remember Me work against each other, though.
---
Do not "main" one side or the other. Play both Killer and Survivor; as a Killer you will learn how to more effectively escape and hide. As a Survivor you will learn how to better juke juking survivors.
---
The most important thing is do not get salty; do not let the facecamping or t-bagging get to you. You will lose, you will get sacrificed, you will have full escapes happen to you. Keep that in mind and you will do fine.
---
Yeah, before it was actually fine, but after the recent update he literally puts it in the middle of the screen then wipes it. Which can screw you over sometimes.
---
Spine chill is my favorite perk in the game
---
I haven't seen anyone run d-strike in a long assume time. It could be that I'm playing at higher ranks than I did when I was a new player, but either way, it doesn't seem to support your claim of it being the best survivor perk. 
---
I’d take off self care. After the healing nerfs you’re better off using something else. My top three to replace that would be Pharmacy, Bond, and Empathy, although I’d go with Pharmacy. The extra searching speed is great and although the emergency med kit is used for healing others, it does great for yourself. It has enough charges to heal you almost 2 times. If you bring Botany Knowledge it’ll heal you twice and half a 3rd. 
---
So my build would be Pharmacy, Balanced Landing or Lithe, Borrowed Time, and Adrenaline. 
---
You can replace Borrowed Time with Spine Chill if you really want to, but that’s up to you. 
---
Oh yeah I see what you meant now. I’m a Wraith main and it’s probably my least favorite part of him. I lose so many survivors because of that.
---
guess Michael isn't the only stalky boi in town
---
What if you don't have BBQ though? Would he still be valid? 
---
I have a hard time learning new characters, and nurse is especially hard for me. I've heard people say that she's of comparable difficulty to Spirit. Agree or disagree?
---
u/thedankdwight you are a babyback bitch
---
Aw that's hot.
---
He's basically a default Killer with a charged instadown. And while I don't think there's anything wrong with a default Killer I feel that he's boring and doesn't add anything to the game. For anything other than camping Leatherface is objectively worse than Hillbilly and that's my main issue with him.
---
The survivor doesn't sound too bad in that case. 
---
I've heard that she's very hard to use though. Is she easily learned? 
---
Oh my god
---
That's true. So it's just her perks that would make her worthwhile?
---
He only does it the once, but yeah that is right. They only stay awake for a couple of days though, and you'd think being in the Entity's realm he'd start getting some sleep. Poor guy.
---
It should be base imo, but I dont have much experience not running it cause it's so nice not to have to rely on teammates
---
Of those three, I'd recommend Bond. It'll get you heals and then some, and giving a lot more/relevant information than Empathy will.
---
Yep.
---
Thanks for the great comment!
---
Do you have one for Jigsaw?
---
imo legion is in a state where it’s unknown if he deserves a rework, a buff of if hes fine. Id personally say that he needs a rework, because hes unfun to play against, ignores lots of in game mechanics (pallets, windows etc like nurse) and well, hes bad too
---
It's actually only on the survivor side, the killer can't see the blood bug. 
---
FORTNITE has always been backed by a large game studio. 
---
People took the joke seriously lmao
---
Is looping considered toxic? I am not very good at it, but since I am trying to improve my chase I was wondering if it's ok to loop a killer if you have a good layout in front of you during a chase,for instance two loops and two pallets near you. Should I just improve my 360, dodging and mind games to trick the killer? I see a lot of people doing loops but I am not sure if it's ok to do it. 
---
Reverse mikey, yekim
---
I mean if you're planning on playing the game more seriously and striving for higher ranks as opposed to playing the game just for fun every once in a while 
---
I mean like 70% of the power's strength is tied to addons. Along with the increase to stats almost all the files have an additional effect that help with tracking (Restraint, Order, Calm), chasing (Order, Obedience, Discipline), or wasting the Survivor's time. (Obedience, Calm) Add in the fact that the baseline range is honestly pretty pitiful and Doctor's power is very weak without addons.
---
I say "basically" doesn't do anything because you can still raise Survivors' madness to help with tracking and slow the game down. But without fake pallets or the increased Terror Radius or increased zapping range Doctor's baseline power is very hard to use and rather ineffective as a whole.
---
Hug the walls and familiarize yourself on when Bloodlust occurs. There's the ideal time to drop the pallet, and go. Try to remember where pallet spawns are as well. A proper looper knows where to go as soon as a chase begins.
---
Hubba hubba 
---
That’s fair, I’ve found his gameplay to be kind of relaxing and I think the instadown gives him some claim to a higher spot.
---
it look's more like a desync for me to be honest
---
The only thing hard about her is your ability to predict
---
If she uses her power you can only see scratch marks unless you use an add on which let you see blood too
---
But even with that, it's all about predicting where the survivors gonna go and if they gonna crouch or just walk while you're using her power 
---
Can you go into more detail? If you don't mind of course. I'm having a hard time deciding lol 
---
[NEW ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED]
---
**Vitamin D Deficiency**
---
This has happened to me too many times. Idk why we can’t get some sort of customization options.
---
Thanks man :)
---
I see
---
Thanks for your feedback!
---
The reason I think you should get more tokens for escaping is that a killer can tunnel you all game and you might not get a stun on him. So you only get 5 tokens maximum for the gens. This happened to me a lot of times and I think the 5 gen "juker" should be rewarded more.
---
The reason why I think you should get tokens if your team repairs gens is because it's a game where teamwork is key. If you do 90% of a gen, get chased by the killer and someone else does the remainding 10% it would be unfair to not get a token. I got inspired by the event generators where you got bloodpoints for every gen your team completed.
---
And I do think that losing the killer should be rewarded. It's not easy to do and would reward players who prefer a stealth build. It can't be exploited either because you have to be chased for at least 15 seconds.
---
BBQ has an additional effect to the aura reading. WGLF is just for bloodpoints. I think increasing the unhook speed would be perfect for this perk because it's not a big deal but it is something and could certainly help against facecampers.
---
Lithe, Dance with me, Decisive strike, Dead hard
---
I know decisive is really meta perk but I use it in this build to prolong a chase as long as possible if I end up getting caught
---
It is indeed
---
great idea
---
I don't play Pig a lot but I'd say Sloppy, Enduring, Knockout/BBQ/NOED and Spirit Fury/MaA/STBFL.
---
I hate how tyde ignores Hag and Freddy’s strengths and also ignores bubba’s weaknesses. His tier lists are biased af and he rates killers on how well he does him them 
---
Looks like Frank just rolled around in some mud.
---
Very cool, nonetheless!
---
I feel my rage coming back this happens way to often 😭😭😭
---
yeah i think most people who play the game a lot would agree that he just needs a flat rework. he/she's the most anti-fun killer they've ever released by a large margin. at least nurse is fun to play and can be fun to play against
---
Thank you for all your input :) 
---
As a piggy main, my go to non-ruin build is:
---
Whispers, BBQ, MYC and Devour Hope
---
Np.
---
Yeah it's been happening a lot to me recently, not sure if the patch broke something or what. 
---
Any good survivor will learn how to loop. Ignore the bs about it being toxic; it's as toxic as DS and NOED (which is not at all). Play the game how you want.
---
Much better post with this comment. I laughed when I reread the post after this comment.
---
Currently it does not tick down if the Legion is in a chase. However, you can game this by "moonwalking" (chasing the survivor backwards based on scratch marks/blood) or by not looking at them. Additionally, with Frank's Mixtape there's nearly 0 chance at not getting downed by a good Legion
---
I don't see decisive strike that often either, I never claimed I did, it's just, when someone DOES have decisive AND uses it that I procees to tunnel and camp. I agree that decisive strike isn't in every match, but next to dead hard, sprint burst and adrennaline, it's one of the most used perks in the game
---
"Best" and "OP" are synonymous in this case. The reason Nurse and Billy are always on the top is because they fundementally break the game, and ignore limitations other killers have.
---
If you watch the very top of the corn, you can see rustling where the Survivors are moving, but it's not an easy thing to do.
---
Just comes down to practice honestly, and even then fuck corn as Nurse :(
---
Couldn't really come up with another title, reading it now, I do agree that it is clickbaity, didn't mean it to be.
---
I would 100% by like 3 of Feng's
---
Yes.
---
I like Halloween. Myers is a strong and straightforward killer. Spirit has a higher skill ceiling, but you can earn her for free over time, and you'll probably have more initial success with Myers
---
I want the bunny feng
---
there is never enough bloodpoints
---
I just thought it was funny. 
---
They could just make it to the point where you don't get a stack unless the Safe Hook Rescue score event occurs, while keeping the taking the hit mechanic the same.
---
I like self care dead hard/balanced landing urban and bond
---
Thank you so much for the input! It's been super helpful! 
---
I’ll take any shirtless killer, thank you!
---
Pls both 
---
Nice! 
---
SWF makes survivors the stronger side. In a game with 4 random survivors though with no comms, I’d say the killers have the advantage. I probably have a 60-70% escape rate when I play with SWF, and probably 30-45% as a solo survivor. Just rough guesses but I definitely escape a lot less often when I play solo.
---
He has 2000 items to take into matches... 
---
If you stop a chest search midway through, it does result in a noise notification bubble (when you see the Survivor slam the lid shut.) As long as you finish a search, there isn't a notification, but as others have said, it is really loud when you're rummaging around and can be heard if you're nearby.
---
As for the Killer purposely 'throwing,' speaking for myself, if I've gotten good BP from the match and I have all of my BBQ stacks I'll sometimes just let people leave. Or if someone played well, I'll let them leave also. It gets the Survivors 5000 extra BP whereas I'd only get like 500 more or something.
---
It varies person to person honestly.
---
What map was that
---
this would help fix killer queues because more survivors would play because of more BP
---
Spirit: Discordance, Bloodhound, Nurse's Calling, Stridor. Combine that with Prayer Beads and it is a deadly combo.
---
"Why wont that killer let me bully him"
---
Well, I'll try. Spirit is a top tier character because she hardly has any counter, it's a guess game when she's phasing or faking the phase, so the mindgames are strong with her, which can be used "competitively" and it's a lot of fun messing with the survivors. Also can give her great mobility. I don't use her that much, but I've read her add-ons make her almost invencible if used right.
---
Now with her perks. 
---
**Rancor:** 	
---
*You become obsessed with one Survivor.*
---
*Each time a Generator  is completed, the Obsession sees your Aura  for 3 seconds.*
---
*Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for 3 seconds.*
---
*Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed  Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.*
---
They probably have some aura reading perk like Alert or Deja Vu, survivors have a lot of ways to tell where you are, so them being able to see your are for just 3 sec it's basically useless for them usually. In exhange, you get a free NOED/Mori for your Obsession and the ability to see every survivors locations (like Docs scream notifications) everytime a gen is completed
---
**Hex: Haunted Grounds:**
---
 *Two trapped Hex Totems will spawn in the Trial.*
---
*When one of the two trapped Hex Totems is cleansed by a* [*Survivor*](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Survivor) *📷**, all Survivors suffer from the* [***Exposed***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Exposed) ***📷*** ***Status Effect*** *for* ***60*** *seconds.*
---
Basically gives you free downs and protects your Ruin.
---
**Spirit Fury:**
---
*After breaking* ***2*** *Pallets, the next time you are stunned by a Pallet, The Entity will instantly break it. You still suffer from the stun effect penalty.* 
---
This with Enduring basically ends chases instantly. If you have Spirit Fury charged and hit a survivor, that means they'll end up on the hook no matter what.
---
while this would discourage toxic gameplay it would be even harder to get stacks and more BP. I think my  suggestion would fix both problems.
---
Fortnite has much less assets on screen at a time, less post processing effects, optimization by the people who make the engine and if I could guess DBD has probably done a lot more modifying of the base engine than Fortnite has. DBD also has spaghetti string code, makes optimizing extremely difficult.
---
None of these are excuses but I'd argue if the devs of DBD had planned the game to be as big as it was in hindsight they probably would have been more careful or how they made particular things work.
---
Consider something as simple as Nurses Calling - it's specific in that it works with healing, but not mending, but does work with snap out of it. Things like that are just programmed weird and this is even obvious from a lamen perspective, imagine what stuff we can't see that they've solved with last minute quit fixes?
---
But enduring is also useful outside countering ds, small game doesn't really.
---
Lol, looks like 12 people couldn't understand the point. 😂
---
Iron Works of Misery I believe
---
Let's be real, with the sheer volume the game rains these down on you in bloodwebs, maybe an hour.
---
Fortnite is literally made by the people who build the engine both games run on. Of course they have better devs/knowledge about the engine.
---
Well done lmao
---
&gt; Noed however can turn a bad game into a good one
---
Literally true of DS as well.
---
But frank is the main legion member, if anyone’s getting a chibi, it’s frank. It’s not that I don’t appreciate OP’s post though
---
On a hook?
---
When you have no skill whatsoever lmao
---
&gt;  But honestly it seems really really hard to win as a survivor.
---
And that's because:
---
&gt; I'm a very new player!
---
Honestly, I'm not trying to noob shame you or anything, but your difficulties stem from the fact that you're new. 
---
&gt; NOED kills you at the end of the game even if you've done everything right up to that point.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; DS lets the survivor have another chance at the chase. The killer is still likely to down them unless they're crap at chasing.
---
If you save your DS until gates are open you get a free escape
---
foh
---
Find lobbies are great after the patch, but the drop of frame rate is horrible 
---
I'm in Dennistoun.
---
Hope you had a good night last night. 
---
With so many second chances, you could build another survivor. 
---
I played against wraith with sloppy an everything looked fine but everyone else dced
---
NOED + slugging. How to easily turn your 0k into a skilless 4k with practically no effort on your part. 
---
Looping is basically one of the few ways Survivors have to avoid getting downed. It isn't toxic, it's just how the Survivors delay getting hit. If you want to get better at Survivor, work on loops/knowing how many loops you can safely get without being hit from each tile/pallet, and more importantly chaining loops together.
---
It's just how the game is designed, if anyone tells you it's 'toxic' they're out of their mind.
---
I'm gonna guess he thought she would instantly leave if he hit her, and if he landed the chainsaw at any point it was a much better chance of getting two
---
But I don't think they're "OP". Legion is OP because his power is very strong but requires little/no skill to use it. I think Billy is not OP because while his power is very strong it takes skill to use it effectively.
---
Yeah I understand that @w@
---
I was mostly commenting on how, early on it feels as if winning as a survivor is practically impossible, and that the game is heavily tilted towards killers, but it also seems like once survivors start being competent, the game will be heavily tilted towards us.
---
Someone spam messages me after hooking a survivor. If that wasn't bad enough he also sent me a picture of his &gt;!dick!&lt;
---
I like this idea, I think you should send this idea to the devs
---
Thanks. Is that a real place lol
---
They can also umm CLEANSE A TOTEM??? HMMM
---
Yep
---
Legion isn't OP, he's considered weak as a whole. Also, OP is regardless of skill. Nurse is OP, no matter how hard she is to use. She negates distance and with enough skill can kill people so easily it's like a joke. 
---
I'm a Freddy main and I consistently get 3/4ks at higher ranks without the use of noed or ruin. It does not 'have a place' on him. It has a place on skilless killers. 
---
He’s kinda a weird guy. Usually good-ish at the games he devotes time to but he is very heavily opinionated. And he doesn’t like being wrong/feels like he’s always right. He’s not a channel for everyone, you really need to take everything he says into consideration instead of taking it as fact. Because despite believing he’s almost always right, he’s not. As you might expect since no one is always right. I used to watch him for smite guides and that stuff because he was a grandmaster in duels and all around a good player and I liked him enough to stick around during the transition to dead by daylight. But at the end of the day, he says what he thinks, and then defends it to death, even if it’s  wrong.
---
Iron Will, Adrenaline, dead hard, Borrowed Time/Pebble 
---
Idk. I think potentially shutting down some loops with a good shock, or just increasing madness to make survivors waste time or not use flashlights while being chased with madness 3c an be a lot more useful than legion.
---
Gay
---
Thank god it isn't No Nut November anymore
---
I agree, however, what I didn't tell is that the name I go by while doing this is "DecisiveStrike=Tunnel" and if survivors stay in end game chat long enough, I'll tell them there. Also, I do this more because I'm bored of playing in a normal way. This is something I do while trying to get bloodpoints from this event. After this event is over, I'll go back to doing what I did before:
---
Changing my name to "Basement Trader" locating the basement at the start of the game and standing still next to the chest untill a survivor tries opening it without dropping me an item. Like I said, I'm bored of regular play, so I like to mix it up. Another fun thing to do is play as doctor with masdive terror radius on the map "the game" and play "find the dwight".
---
If you're such a bad killer that you (A) let the gates get opened and (B) haven't hooked a person by that stage then you deserve a 50% chance of them escaping. 
---
Totems = RNG. All you have to do is slug and you win even if you did practically nothing the rest of the game. 
---
Out of 85 games I've played since just before the bloodhunt, I've seen 20 legions. I know it's the newest killer, but I don't remember spirit or clown being this used on release.
---
It's in Glasgow haha 
---
You sure lmao? 
---
pins decrease the aaaaaagggghhhhh animation and the ruler makes ur bar fill fast  ez
---
It’s from the fighting games. He’s used to using every tool given to even the fight. Because if you don’t use half a characters kit you’re missing out. And if you don’t use add-ons, you’re missing out.

That person could be on their third fucking hook.
---
Why focus so much on bloodpoints than actually playing? It took my significantly longer to p3 a survivor and get all perks for them and get nearly all perks across all killers.
---
Play to win, not just to unlock more perks on different skins. 
---
Im only jesting. Happy new year to you
---
I wonder if they will do a bloody version (prob not P3 bloody) if the other two for shards or cells.

Someone thought my clown was P3 the other day because I had the dark outfit and the purple face paint.  It has some drips of blood on the bald spot on his head.  
---
He is freshly lvl 50 for the first time.  
---
*flashlight clicks and sprint bursts away*
---
I would consider it second to dead hard since dead hard isn’t as situational as balanced landing. Honestly though, the fact that balanced landing is more consistent for me puts it above dead hard. 
---
Not baby-faced enough to be current Monto.
---
:P
---
Too bad Aftercare resets when you get hooked.
---
&gt; Most people here are crappy killers
---
Holy fuck this is delusional. This sub is mostly SWF babies
---
Yeah which means you have to heal/unhook everyone again. Sucks but it’s better than Empathy imo
---
So is OP bad? Should BHVR change the "OP/Best" killers?
---
You're right legion isn't OP. 
---
But he's just fundamentally flawed the way you can simply delete any counterplay or fun. 
---
Don't do that mate haha
---
Aye you too.
---
Yeah you can’t for that reason
---
I'd say rework Nurse totally, she's a good concept with too much power. Billy would be a fine baseline balance, putting all killers around his level, and with survivors being buffed or nerfed accordingly. 
---
You never know whom you talking to. I was looked up from someone on steam who then wrote me the most disturbing things. Wished me death (that was quite an innocent one) and such things. I reported him and really hope steam takes it seriously. You never know how the person you talk to is (emotionwise) and it should not been taken lightheartedly. Some things are not okay. Simple as that.

tl;dr story of Tyde: used to make good videos now all he does is cry while being full of himself and his own opinions
---
The long story: Before starting with Dead by Daylight Tyde was well known for being a content creator for the MOBA "Smite", hence why he already had an audience when he started making Dead by Daylight content. He eventually grew tired of Smite and would often complain about how the developers don't care and how the game essentially boiled down to "build damage and you win."
---
&gt;Note: This information is all hypothetical from a friend of mine who's a Smite player who supposedly knew about TydeTyme before he started making DBD content. I know very little about pre-DBD Tyde or Smite as a game so take my explanation of his pre-DBD history with a grain of salt.
---
Tyde quickly grew in the Dead by Daylight sphere in large part thanks to his already large subscriber base on YouTube and Twitch which helped boost him up in YouTube's algorithms and Twitch's most watched streams. That isn't to say that he *didn't* make good content for Dead by Daylight, as he'd often discuss interesting and important topics about the game and encourage his community to give the developers feedback on how to improve the game.
---
However this thoughtfulness and insight quickly turned sour as he soon grew tired of the game much like he had with Smite, finding Survivor too easy and Killer too frustrating to play. Soon most of his videos turned sour with a lot of his most well known quotes being how (paraphrased: I don't give enough of a shit to actually quote him properly lol) "due to the huge amount of escape perks and the inexhaustible supply of pallets at the Survivor's disposal the Killer can’t reliably get enough kills in a match due to the time allotted to them.", "playing Killer in Dead by Daylight is like getting into a fight in Call of Duty where your opponent has a Sniper Rifle; if your opponent is skilled enough you never get the chance to make the shot - they just quickscope you and you're dead. As Killer you have to rely on the Survivors making mistakes in order to get kills and there is nothing you can do that can't be countered by good survivors.", and "a master killer will always lose to 4 master Survivors even if they're playing Nurse." ~~And he says this all while failing to realize that this is in large part how the game is meant to be balanced.~~
---
But what started as discontent quickly turned into whining and bitching for the sake of whining and bitching. Tyde would constantly sarcastically bitch about how “Survivor is so difficult I have to hold down Mouse 1 all game” and how “Survivor is so difficult I just Sprint Burst to a pallet and run around in circles” whenever he’d play Survivor. ~~At Rank 10 when he has several thousand hours worth of experience in the game.~~ His ludicrous bitterness towards the game and its developers stemmed into his discussion videos, and what was once thoughtful and discussion provoking was nothing more than glorified 10 minute videos of babies crying. One of the most infamous examples of Tyde "whining for whining’s sake" was when he said that Spirit would be trash tier [**before she was even on the PTB.**]( https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/99x3wb/crybaby_tydetyme_already_complaining_about_killer/)
---
In addition it’s become quite clear that Tyde’s high subscriber count and general respect among the community has gone to his head, to the point that he’d ignore almost any criticism of his opinions, usually writing them off with “I was Rank 1 Killer and Rank 1 Survivor one time” ~~like it’s somehow difficult to rank up especially with Emblems.~~ His biggest loss of respect came with his 2.3.3 tier list where he said that [Leatherface was B tier and Hag was D tier.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/328587057431576581/514609103935635467/ieojs5bqaiz11.png) This choice was obviously met with a lot of criticism with some of the best YouTube comments including:
---
&gt;Spends like 5 mins talking about how strong the clown is because he can cut off loops**  Puts Hag in D tier*
---
&gt;I like how in the gameplay where you are talking about hag, you dont have any traps placed and are instead prioritizing chasing as a 110 walk killer. Really proves you know what you're doing with hag. You say that she cant split her attention, but what is stopping her from teleporting to the traps survivors are tripping while you are chasing someone else and getting free hits? That's far more efficient than continuing to walk at the same person. Killers gain pressure from injured survivors, it keeps them off of gens and makes them easier to track, as well as putting them in the position of going down in the next hit.
---
and the current top comment on his tier list:
---
&gt;This tier list gave me an aneurism.
---
Also a Hag main YouTuber/Twitch Streamer named “Space Coconut” made a video where he calls Tyde’s tier list out saying that “Little Timmy Time clearly just made his list as a joke so we could all have a good laugh at how ridiculous it is.” Oh lord spill the tea!
---
But it quickly became clear that Tyde was actually serious about his tier list. When people took to Twitter to argue his tier list he was quick to say that the community was “proven wrong” by his tier list, and the fact that he’s being told that he’s “wrong about an opinion” is “insane”, and that “opinions can’t be wrong; they’re opinions.” Naturally [the community laughed their ass off over the massive hypocrisy of Tyde saying that the Community’s OPINION was wrong while also saying that OPINIONS can’t be wrong.]( https://youtu.be/cImWSBqeC0E)
---
And now Tyde is basically a joke with the only people who still support him being his overly dedicated fans. “Hag is D tier” and “Leatherface is B tier” are common memes among the community now thanks to Tyde’s tier list video. After the tier list it’s near impossible to take anything the man posts seriously, and I think his Dead by Daylight Content Creation will forever be haunted by his Rank 20-worthy tier list.
---
If you want my honest to god opinion on Tyde I think he’s still a smart man but his head is so firmly up his ass right now that it’s coming out of his throat. He needs a good long break from Dead by Daylight so he can stop crying about it. I’d say 6 months (2 expansions) would be long enough for him to maybe come back to the game with a fresh set of eyes. And the guy seriously needs a reality check: he thinks of himself as a god when he’s completely mortal and possibly even less than that with how he acts. He can be wrong, and he needs to stop thinking about himself as always right.
---
Also learn how to place a fucking trap while playing Hag Timmy. Jesus Christ I’m a P0 Hag walking on NOED crutches for my Kills and I still recognize that you’re fucking awful. You’re a Rank 1 Killer main and my shitty Rank 3 scrub ass knows how to play Hag better than you? 😂
---
I'm a simple man
---
I see a P3 Claudette running at least 3 meta perks, I downvote
---
Michael Jackson’s Thriller plz
---
&gt; SWF makes survivors the stronger side.
---
It's far more than that. SWF is just the extra kick in the nuts to killers. Don't get me wrong, SWF is a necessary thing to keep this game alive, but it's in no way the element that tips the balance of power.
---
&gt; In a game with 4 random survivors though with no comms, I’d say the killers have the advantage.
---
And I'd say you're playing at rank 10 if that's the case, or with boosted rank 1's. If not that, then you're playing entirely too altruistic and getting punished for it. When you play with and against legitimate rank 1 players, it's an entirely different experience. The fact that segments of the survivor playerbase are too inept to make use of all the tools they have doesn't make them any less powerful. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying killers should be able to just steamroll survivors, but at the same time, survivors should not be the ones in sole control of the match as they currently are. 
---
It can only go up from here
---
maybe reworked so hes actually fun to go against
---
Insta chainsaw billy? Bye 
---
I'm a killer main. Rank 1. 
---
I can play killer without trying very hard, while watching TV, because it's easy. Playing survivor requires concentration.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5x9TLCHeGw&amp;lc=z220z5mw3l20dde2xacdp4354irxve4hnk2hgit5nexw03c010c.1514045151876271) video by TydeTyme is why I stopped watching him.  He gets handed an easy 4k, has more than double the points of any of the survivors, and whines the entire time that "this is why it sucks to be a killer."
---
It cemented that really he just doesn't want to have anyone challenge him in any way, rather than play a game.
---
legion 
---
~~Give me shirtless legion~~
---
probably legion 
---
I'd love a little more insight into what he was like before getting in DBD; just out of curiosity.
---
All I know is that (according to a friend who played Smite) he did to that game basically what he's doing to Dead by Daylight now: he played it to death and then started bitching about particular nitpicks in the game's balance.
---
Iron Will or No Mither/Resilience/Sprint Burst
---
Hillbilly.He instant downs you with his chainsaw, but I have no idea why some players run NOED on him
---
It's still very map dependant. While Doctor can get hits at given vaults / pallets with good use of his power he also moves at 110% while in Treatment and doesn't gain Bloodlust while zapping people.
---
And that is why you change the button for healing, my friend
---
I’ve actually had that happen to me, maybe it’s the map? Almost the exact same area. 
---
Billy doesn't ignore the game's limitations, he still gets looped and can be played around.
---
Nurse and Legion ignore the game's mechanics, that I can agree on. Pallets and vaults aren't good defense against them so survivors don't have any real options when facing them.
---
Tbh you have a valid excuse for camping since killer on ps4 runs at like 0.8fps so it would be hard to move from that position 
---
I have 500 on one.
---
Bubba is the easiest killer I’ve used by far. I 4K 90% of my matches with him easily. I don’t know why people think he’s bad. His chainsaw is great.
---
 (Me a Claudette main) DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *CLICKY FLASHLIGHT* *T BAG T BAG*
---
You can't. There is an action button that counts both for healing and vaulting/throwing pallets.
---
You Monster. 
---
Wait is this a gif
---
Absolute lies. I play on Xbox and, while the bloodweb is smoother, actual gameplay frames have tanked.
---
Tyde follows his narrative without any deviation. If he's talking about how a Killer is overpowered he'll kill 1 Survivor and then spend the rest of the video talking about how easy it was to kill that one Survivor while being pallet stunned and teabagged. If he's talking about how a Killer is underpowered he'll get a 4k and dismiss it as playing against bad Survivors and say that "against good Survivors I wouldn't have been able to do that."
---
You know that in the first day of Film School you learn that *you're allowed to do reshoots*, right? I don't understand why Tyde doesn't at the very least try to get gameplay footage that actively reflects the points he's trying to get across.
---
Certainly you can show how bad Hag supposedly is while also playing some gameplay footage of you actually placing a trap more than once? Or perhaps when you actually use her power you actually get kills and that doesn't fit your narrative of Hag being one of the worst Killers in the game.
---
You must be so easily to amuse
---
Seriously. Jumped on my sisters PS4 for a couple games, absolute trash. Can’t believe people can sit and play that heap of shite.
---
It ran better on my old PC with a 960 and hardly any ram than it does on her PS4.
---
*Oi I thenk she'z strehm snoipin' meh.*
---
Lol I wasn’t really thinking about it at the time let’s just say the guy doing the last gen after he popped it, it spawned in 
---
What exactly is considered an “action” speed according to the game? 
---
Wow i was actually about to buy the game again. Forgot how gay this community is. No thanks.
---
One can be cleansed throughout the game.
---
One is punishment for winning a chase and essentially an extra life.
---
&gt; etalent is a
---
*tydetime
---
you got the posts intention wrong
---
I remember clicking on a Tyde video and almost instantly X'd out after the first three seconds of looking at that face.
---
Absolutely. It's quite obvious that the reason he ranks Michael so high is because Michael is a Killer he understands very well. He gets 4ks as Michael because he's extremely stealthy and runs actually good builds on Michael, but on Hag he runs chase builds (like he actually genuinely uses Brutal Strength on Hag lmfao) and never uses her power. And then he complains that a 110% movement speed killer can't chase well?
---
Myers or Billy imo.
---
Just because you dont expect it on them
---
Exactly. I don't have a pc, so I'm stuck on ps4. I love playing killer but it's unplayable. Devs said major improvements would be made by December but here we are... 
---
Why does it have to be solo a gen? So if claudette comes along when its 98% and taps it, now i don't get a stack?
---
I mean he didn’t kill smite or anything like that. Just a lot of drama that happened at one point between him and another YouTuber and a lot of lies. I can’t remember who the other guy was or really what the beef was about because it’s been a while. But it really was this big thing that kinda split the content creator smite community. At the end of the day most people stayed out of it or sided with the other guy. So tyde said fuck it and more or less stopped playing smite. He’s always been the know-it-all he currently is but back during smite times it was more warranted and I actually learned a lot about the game from watching his videos. And he’s always bitched about balance because who doesn’t really, especially when you’re super invested in the game like he was. Although honestly a lot of people in the smite community acted exactly like him. Even some of the pro players, some of which he had beef with. Overall his opinions made him a generally unlikeable person, and eventually there was the straw that broke the camels back and poof, he was gone. 
---
oo i did thats a fat yikes ahaha 
---
I remember some good people c: Just came back myself with renewed passion aswell
---
I havent seen tyde videos lately but i bet hes the kind of hag that puts more than 3 traps to defend a hook
---
Wow thanks for the write up! Really informative! Yeah his ego is definitely visible especially because of his dedicated fans. When I stop by his twitch one of his fans was saying how if he meet tyde in real life he would completely shut down because he can’t handle himself around celebrities, and then people started agreeing with him saying they’d act the same. That’s when I figured he’d have an ego with a community like that, but I didn’t know about his criticism the one about the spirit is especially crazy to me.
---
All the points in the world
---
I'm not a huge fan of getting tokens for gens being completed, as that would just encourage more gen rushing.  Perhaps granting tokens for cleansing totems and disarming traps?
---
Legion without high tier addons is just not worth playing, especially at rank 1.
---
Thought it was Claudette from the thumbnail
---
Nah put that on hag
---
oof
---
I'll never understand people calling the Killer bad when they wiped out the entire group. They don't realise they are just shitting on themselves.
---
Do you do digital art, because I’d wanna commission you to draw feng tbh
---
Legion, doesn’t work if you use frenzy, which seems like bullshit to me.
---
That. Lol. 
---
Because SWF on voice comms is OP.
---
Should have dashborded on your cocky swf ass
---
You could just build the entire tombstone from those pieces.
---
Meanwhile Survivor mains be like: F i r e c r a c k e r t i m e
---
Addons increase the amount you can blink
---
What you're saying is that you are an absolute piece of shit
---
That'd make it far too easy to get tokens. 
---
Object of obsession, bond, p3 Claudette with mist offering, slam enough pallets down and you’ll ko the killer. And let’s be fair there are survivors with good perks. Let’s not forget everyone’s favourite perk DS which surprisingly is behind paywall of Laurie strode. Good shitpost friend 
---
Summer 2019 can't come quick enough
---
Instead server has to factor in yours and kuller latency and compensate accordingly, have you never been shot behind a wall in an fps? 
---
Eh tried those. Annoying survivors make it way to hard. Seriously I'll be in a match trying to be nice. Trying to be a nice guy... Well ya know the rest. Either way annoying as hell.
---
I'm honestly surprised they didn't at least try. Perhaps with some fake sweaters (t-shirts with the sweater designs.)
---
I don't doubt that people on Etsy are working on it as we speak. I'm actually going to go do a Google right now out of blind curiosity.
---
The legion is broken, and through the use of the fake chase exploit can guarantee people going down with no counterplay, but I don't chalk up exploits to overpowered since the intended design of the killer wasn't to be able to do that, merely a consequence of oversight that will I assume be fixed in time.
---
As for killers actually being overpowered, only the nurse really falls into this category to me. The 'high tier' killers tend to be listed as nurse, billy, huntress, spirit and clown, generally in that, or a similar order based on their ability to end chases early without relying upon the survivor they are chasing having made a mistake, or in billy's case, exert a map wide pressure on the survivors using their speed being the main factor, not their chase.
---
The difference between the nurse and the others is that the nurse is able to break some of the fundamental rules of the killer, survivor dynamic. There is counterplay to be found, but only in tricking the nurse, never in outplaying through the in game mechanics. The nurse can ignore all map features so long as she distances her blinks correctly which nullifies every tool survivors have to combat it except the mind game or juke to hopefully make the nurse miss, but even then, it is reliant on their opponent making a mistake; the same way the bad killers are reliant on the survivors making mistakes to catch them.
---
Not gonna lie i had a similar game with 3 BPS and i had a Mori. Everyone got murdered by Nurse but atleast I gave them enough time to farm some BP. Semi-asshole here
---
would have hooked you 
---
You won't be missed, if you don't want shirtless Myers we don't want you.
---
Maybe predator could go invisible but be slowed and see through heat vision and not attack.
---
Did you buy the Saw DLC or did you buy Tapp with shards? Every licensed survivor has an extra cosmetic if you buy the actual DLC they are apart of.
---
That's OchiDO's position, not Tyde. Tyde is mediocre at best.
---
Just to clarify a few things, I had maybe 16 hours of playtime before picking the game back up again. Hence 'Getting The Hang Of It' being unlocked in Feb last year!
---
I mainly play The Pig, The Doctor and The Hag. The Huntress was what got me into playing as killer but I struggled to keep a competitive edge against better players with her. High rank Huntress mains have my respect. 
---
So what? It’s not hard to get 4 stacks of BBQ either so why should survivors have it harder becuase right now they have to compete over stacks pretty much.
---
And with my suggested change you won’t get 10 stacks all the time either but it should be much easier to get more BP and help with the grind.
---
Wait how?
---
Maybe it's a basement buff, extreme levels of radiation kill the survivors as soon as you hook them in the basement
---
swf
---
I go Urban evasion, dead hard, we’ll make it and then I normally change the last one but Dark Sense more often than not, I use this on full black  David
---
I think it was with 500 auric cells, do I need to buy the DLC to get him then? 
---
No. The contrarian/reversal-jerkers of our community are trying really hard to change the narrative but the fact remains that the second-worst character out of fourteen will always be 'bad' because they're allowed to be compared to each other.
---
Nobody gives a shit about how you 4k'd with Legion, guys. 
---
You can’t see his back boobs so it’s a no from me 
---
No idea why you got downvoted. This is correct, if you play legion the way the devs intended then the killer is dogshit, hence why people called him UP. Only reason people score kills with that guy is because people are awful, after all someone managed to win a bunch of games with speedlimiter leatherface. Use frank’s mixtape and purposefully abuse chase mechanics, and there is nothing that survivor can do but die. 
---
But 3 times is standard, isn't it? 
---
Yea if you want that cosmetic you'll need to buy the Saw DLC.
---
Killer is way too easy to play
---
Doesn’t fit the theme? ‘We’re gonna live forever’ we will get rewarded for surviving. If you want to survive you have to do gens, juke the killer, help teammates, etc. Not just unhooking and farming people because that’s not how you will survive the trial.
---
AFAIK they’re working on getting permission.
---
