We are now best friends

---
---
I’m sh👀k
---
Lol they could still tunnel, the time is hella short so they’re not even stunned long enough for an INJURED survivor to get away. It is most definitely killer sided, they basically nerf anything the killers don’t like. And also, Level 1&amp;2 ruin were still good. And DS is literally now among the worst in the game, completely useless, might as well run Deja Vu, will probably go over better 
---
Crazy how they broke it even more, now you can’t pip half the time dispite you doing very well
---
He's not the killer.
---
Without a single comment, I assume? 
---
Her potential during the chase might not be good, but her potential for STARTING it is great. You can sneak around, catch them when they least expect it, and immediately end the first part of the chase. Boom, now you just have to m1, or if you're feeling bold you can crouch again and sneak out of their view to strike out of nowhere once again
---
It's like facing a tier 2 mires that can go back to tier one on demand
---
Well, now is your chance! Get to rank 1 and stay there - and you'll know you're good. Gl! 
---
She is my favorite killer to play against. Ducking in and out of cover and mixing both stealthy gameplay. It’s such a good fun balance. She’s only managed to catch me a couple times since release tho. I ran duo yesterday all day and some today. Still escaping way more often then I don’t. 
---
Permanently. 
---
I'm aware of the bug but I don't understand what you're trying to say with this meme.
---
I mean it depends on your height, that might be considered fat medically
---
Leaked "Terrifier" perk for the chapter after this next one
---
You're not alone, just go watch any big survivor stream. They were complaining about it a lot last night. Also WGLF stacks aren't getting added when they should be.
---
People at high rank dont use items? 
---
Me but vice versa, I cannot STAND playing killer- I genuinely cant see how people find killer fun in the slightest.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS HORRENDOUS NEW MATCHMAKING THEY ADDED?! I WAIT FIVE MINUTES FOR A GAME THAT EITHER ALL GENS ARE RUSHED FAST AS FUCK, I KILL ALL OF THEM FAST OR A MIXTURE OF THE TWO! IT DOESN'T EVEN GIVE ME A LOBBY OF PLAYERS, I STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MOTHERFUCKING LOBBY TO FILL WHICH TAKES EVEN FUCKING LONGER!! THE GAMES END FASTER THAN IT TAKES FOR ME TO GET A PROPER MATCH!
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME WAIT FOR THE GOD FORSAKEN FUCKING TIME TO MAKE THE DAMN FUCKING LOBBY THEN GIVE ME THE PLAYERS AT THE START FOR FUCK'S SAKE
---
Stupid killer, you're supposed to pretend the hooked survivor doesn't exist, you owe the survivors a free unhook /s
---
No it's broken on killer as well. Since somebody dcs every game the best I've gotten is 3ks. Sometimes I safety with a 3k sometimes I don't, one time I double pipped. There was no difference in the way I played. It just depends on if survivors rescue early or not. If they don't and you only get 1 or 2 hooks we survivor I doubt you will pip. 
---
I've totally never done this..... :wink:
---
Geese mom you sure know how to pop the kids balloon! 
---
too bad everyone's been running both
---
Lmao he/she says bye then proceeds to track down another post I commented on and keep going. Talk about an "Ego". I'm not even gonna bother with the other post since ik that was just a personal troll/attack on me.
---
U don't? Uh huh, suuuure. I honestly can't name a single killer I've went up against or seen on a YouTube video that hasn't used some sort of insta down or Mori every chance they get. And not only those but Aura tracking perks. And highly I doubt ur any different. As for the "not needing ppl to get to rank 1" I never said I "needed" anyone to rank up either. It's very easy, that is til this new bs Pip update. I just prefer to play with my friends because it's funner. But way to make it into a competition. U must feel proud TRYING to make urself feel superior to someone else that u have no clue how their skill is. But it's ok u can settle down now puppy. I shall take my leave from this comment section so u can enjoy the rest of your day.

"Its time for a more... precise punishment"
---
I thought the same thing. Damn Klan Nurse
---
From my understanding,  you only get infected if theyre fully infected. If theyre just sick and on their way to being infected you can unhooking them safely. 
---
Really? Her purge puke hits you from a mile away. 
---
I missed all the leak stuff what was it?
---
It happened to me earlier today. But only once it was weird. I got put in a lobby and my boyfriend got stuck on a loading screen
---
I love this. Do have to say though, only seeing the top of it before scrolling down, I thought it was Kuzco from the Emperor's New Groove lol, all I could think about was plague opening up a locker to "BOOM BABY" a survivor.
---
If her name was Teabag then: "Teabag, this bitch!"
---
No matter what you do don't put your butthole on the drain. 
---
That explains why no one saved this poor Nea from a hook even though i was roaming far away from her/the hook and didn't realise no one bother to save her until she got sacrificed.
---
Not all of us are bad, I promise. 
---
Ash will be mine... oh yes he will be mine.
---
Its the dbd community on reddit... so meh
---
 
---
*And then do his giggle as he fires* countless times, while the player still watches the animation even thought its already game over.
---
rin is about a roll of toilet paper away from shirtless im pretty sure she would be bad enough to be in the No
---
Her regular puke range is fine because you don’t go down from two hits. But the corrupt one needs to be fixed. It’s literally like she’s playing an M1 killer except with an infinite amount of range. Don’t see how that’s balanced. 
---
I almost wish I could’ve seen that with my own eyes, holy shit.
---
It's called proxy camping. Go after other targets. it's not that hard.
---
Lol, have you ever tried playing killer. Stop having a sook without even thinking about the other side, I play a lot of killer, but I also play survivor with ds, it’s still a good perk, but maybe your just too bad to loop and SURVIVE. Shut up you heckin entitled survivor main
---
Sort of related, I just started using character specific perks with one additional of my choosing.  I know mix and match produces better results but I actually had a few chances to use Bill's left behind and it worked out.  2 gens left, finished one pretty quickly and was able to use it as diversion to escape through hatch.  The only one that's been completely useless is sole survivor.
---
You seem like the type of survivor that messages killers after the game.
---
* Spirit, Plague have sound bugs.
---
* Pip system on survivor side totally sucks.
---
* Head On perk is really weird.
---
* Infinite Loading screens still exist.
---
Damn I can't even tell whatelse sucks atm... there's so much shit going on.
---
I tried it out 5 times when the killer was in front of my locker and the perk was active (meaning I was in the locker for longer then 3 seconds), and I didn't stun them a single time. Maybe I am doing something wrong but for now I am just sticking with the other perks.
---
This deserves to be longer than 7 seconds
---
lol say something nice about the legion, hahahahahbahababbabahahahahahahahahahahhaah you got me rolling about this post! I would rather be basement, facecamped by leatherface a thousand times over before ever saying anything nice about the Legion! He’s straight up dumpster fire trash!

Of course you'd assume that if you tunnel/camp.
---
But nope. That requires effort on PS4. One which I can't be bothered.
---
This is a 5 star meme.
---
Infects others that get them off
---
Lol. The game is tew hard naow without our pweshus ds!!!1! Shes been out for 1 day.
---
Your the type of survivor who has never played killer, and assumes being downed more than once is tunneling. 
---
It’s time for a more.....Precise punishment.
---
It was funny because our friend didnt know his face was up there and he was making weird faces and when he looked up and saw what everyone was laughing at he was trying so hard to not make faces that it was even funnier.
---
Like a huge bowl of pudding with legs.
---
herman is CUDDLIEST
---
A smart trapper is at least B
---
You're a hero. 
---
Yep I’ve tried playing killer, I never understood the hate for DS, it’s not that bad. DS is not a good perk, there’s no need to lie to make the devs think that this dumbass patch was a good idea 
---
When I played her it didn't do and anything
---
Yes they do, and most of the time they are not part of my region and they leave, making it longer
---
GG --&gt; Leave. That's all I ever do as killer. There is nothing in post game that'll ever improve your mood. Ever.
---
I mean honestly before the DS change if someone unhooked in my face I would smack the person being unhooked back down and slug them (hopefully for them to get healed by a teammate) to go after the person who unhooked. Denies safe hook points for what clearly wasn’t safe, and I guess now plays around DS ever being a problem because I typically don’t tunnel someone that hard.
---
BUT I NEVER EVEN GOT FRANK’S TO DROP FOR ME, I’M A NEWBIE AND MY LEGION IS ONLY 17 D:
---
I am pretty sure if you DH but get hit before the DH animation starts and get exhausted anyways then that is a ping issue and you DH'ed too late. However, i had multiple instances last night where i DH'ed as i heard the killer lunge, saw the animation, but got hit in the recovery frames. They *might* have either mistakenly removed some I-frames on DH or increased the active frames on killers lunges. *OR* i just fucked up. 
---
I agree completely! and LOL "wind-scythe jutsu"; this needs to be a thing! I'm calling it that from now on, cause these hits are crazy broken. I'm a survivor main with over 500 hours and can honestly say, the hit boxes are ruining the game and making it impossible for me to enjoy it anymore. Vaulting in general equals a free hit for killers, pallet looping is nearly impossible with several killers because of the ridiculously massive hit-box connect that pierces you even after the pallet has been thrown. Surviving shouldn't feel like an automatic defeat when loading into a game. They've given killers handicap after handicap to the point where many killers who are simply competent can get a 4k without having to break a sweat; meanwhile I'm screaming at the computer in 20 minute increments as I die to unjust mechanics game after game. Please resolve. Please create proper balance. #Justiceforsurvivors
---
tyty
---
If you have stage 2 infection and you're unhooked, it makes the unhooker sick.
---
I didn't think pre-puking on everything prior to unhook did anything.
---
Kind of a shame. He's got some good ones. I like Breakdown a lot especially. 
---
I always wondered how they breathe through those first two masks
---
So In Australia/NZ we have a small player base, where literally EVERYONE has fucking enemies.... Grown ass adults like... omg i got this guy as my killer he's my enemy im gonna DC. These changes have weaponised DC'ing if you don't like the killer. And yes you can tell who your killer is, at least for us in Aus/NZ
---
   https://dbd.onteh.net.au
---
What happened when you were unhooked
---
If you facecamp, any good survivor will just leave and do gens. Unless they're screwing about, in which case they wouldn't be rank 1- you know, because you need to consistently win to maintain that rank?
---
It could be bugged maybe, not sure. But I've unhooked several people that's been puked on while on the hook and got infected, some of the people aren't even puked on prior so I dunno.
---
Because you didn't juke the killer. Juking the killer means losing them, not running in circles around a pallet.
---
Woah that's sick! Bet Wraith would look amazing too, especially with his latest Halloween skin
---
Easiest 45k blood-points of his life. 
---
Almost. Just need to remove the mask and let her pre-rendered face be there and BOOM there's your mimic. Now I want a head cosmetic that removes her mask....
---
Haha thanks! Good luck and many a lag free game to you as well!
---
Yeah like the first thing has happened to me plenty of times and it sucks, but I don’t even get exhausted anymore. I just hit it, early, trying to avoid the ping shit and it still doesn’t go off and makes my frames stutter on the ground like its bugged. 
---
Other times I’ve hit it, heard the killer whiff, and still get hit. All in green ping lobbies. I just wish a dev would take a look into it because everytime someone says DH doesn’t work, you get the automatic it’s due to lag response. 
---
Add them to the Mixtape list.
---
Get a load of this survivor main
---
Everything went back to normal. You can see it for a bit at the 39 second mark.  I went to heal at the fountain and it didn't happen again during the match. 
---
Brother, rank 20 doesn’t count. Ds was PRETTY BAD to verse, and yes ds is a good perk, it makes killers not tunnel which is always better, for both killers and survivor. Shut up mr entitled survivor main.
---
I still have vods and screenshots lol
---
It was the worst exploit bug wise but this patch broke everything else 
---
OH. Well that makes me feel better at least. I can stop trying and just focus on leveling.
---
Just leave. I probably speak for most killers in that I assume you're only staying to BM, so I won't bother going to the exit gate. Everyone just mashes their ctrl key and then escapes as soon as chase starts so only they get +250 escape points.
---
that she only gets for 1 minute intervals at a time, in exchange for unlimited survivor insta-heals. I'd say it's balanced
---
I didn't worry about it before because Rank didn't matter before.
---
Now Rank doesn't even exist. c:
---
There are a few theories going around that Sally is the nicest killer in the game. One of her patients was already drawing sketches of the entity, so the entity is what people assume caused the patients to just get further into insanity.
---
Sally appeared to have cared so much for her patients that she made a deal with the entity. Their freedom in return for her eternal servitude. Upon making the deal with the entity, she understood that the entity had already corrupted their minds beyond redeemable, so she was forced to set them free in the only way. By killing them all and allowing them peace. 
---
Thats why the nurse is so relentless in capturing her prey (the survivors) because she wants them to lose all hope so they can be set free from the entitys realm, just like she did with her patients.
---
Now I dont know about you guys but that back story sounds a lot more like the Sally who was desperate for money for her and her family. She was never a ruthless killer and she just wanted to help people.
---
It would make sense for her to sell her own soul in the freedom of hundreds of others.
---
Vods and screenshots aren’t the same though sadly hah although still entertaining.
---
And yeah, at least this patch doesn’t have so many ridiculous exploits, but it’s still pretty bad.
---
I still am too XD
---
Yeah, this is getting embarrassing for you. 
---
[https://youtu.be/exE4ZQWJ9pk](https://youtu.be/exE4ZQWJ9pk)
---
As a survivor? Jeez. Could you even see? If I got close enough it was giant prims making it impossible to do anything 
---
Yoo, this actually happened to me today. Also, i was lagging a lot and had to close the game. Lost my flashlight too :(
---
Lol i didn't even realize, makes even more sense
---
Stabby teenagers bad

That was a thread earlier someone posted with a video of DS against Enduring. Its even worse than Deja vu now! 
---
lol. It's never a channel. Just a way for me to post my gameplay.
---
but it's obvious how much my words really getting into your skin. I love slugging as i occasionally bring UB. 
---
To be fair.... TO BE FAIR, damn near every Bubba will camp the basement and when he doesn't I am eternally grateful. I had a Bubba that took me to the basement and let me run out past him as I was leaving, I nearly had a stroke. But I thanked him for that in after chat wrote on his steam profile then let him have my virgin asshole because NO ONE plays like that, especially Bubba but when they do I am thankful. 
---
It does do something it's just the same something as the pig crouch spamming a hooked survivor
---
Nah fam. I'm sick and having some fun.
---
You the kind of survivor who unhooked in front of the killer then gets mad when he downs them
---
Only perk I use consistently in that list is ruin.  In all honesty as much as DS annoyed me, it was bearable but survivors without it tended to do better 
---
I thought it will infect the person that unhooks. I've been puking on hooked survs, I'll have to test it.
---
 NOED? Literally the same thing no nerf. Plus any good killer could deal with it, the pallets around are gone probably, and the survivor is still very much injured 
---
Check recent players on steam, only works as survivor though
---
Go see a therapist?
---
Unlikely. Unless the killer is camping and in that case, I have BT.
---
You can dodge put by ducking behind stuff just like huntress, and like huntress and doctor, if she's puking you can keep looping since it slows her down.
---
Thicc means fat lmao moron
---
Yup my group does that aswell, but I've only encountered very very few swf groups like that. Most are extremely selfish and just leave you to die even if the killer isn't camping. 
---
Return of the salt: As the pig, teabag at the survivors for 1 minute
---
As solo survivor you'll end up hating swf more than killers do
---
Got a really nasty cold. This is the highlight of an otherwise boring day.
---
You the type of survivor who thinks killers in general are op.
---
He couldve dc’d when he saw how bad the survs were losing
---
That's probably because ppl that did have it wasn't scared to get caught knowing they had a chance to get free as to where the others had to be sneaky?
---
NOED is an end game perk that is countered by cleansing totems. DS is an awful made perk. Plus survivors also have lithe, dead hard, balanced landing , and other perks that can help you get a little boost to get away. The DS nerf was needed and mostly everyone can agree that its gone or not going to be seen as often
---
Happen to me a few updates ago. Delete and redownload the game, that fixed it for me.
---
Can confirm my uncle is the game director of bhvr and he’s definitely legit sorry dude your getting banned probably shouldn’t have talked shit and camped gens
---
Original template creator u/ZombieHuggerr.
---
Finally someone else gets it
---
Barely! If I did an action like repairing a gen or vaulting David would go back to his normal size, but once I stopped he’d be giant again. Also I was running empathy and aftercare so I could also see giant survivor auras as well 
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
It says the game initialized in a wrong way and it needs to initialize itself again so... is that what happened to you?
---
Boy wtf Pig gives the best cuddles wtf you doin headass
---
Yeah you should totally rank up for beating someone who is literally afk. Very skillful.
---
I guess I'm flattered And sad for you.
---
Well.....they generally are that's why it's a 4 vs 1 asymmetrical game. The 1 person is usually stronger and faster than the rest.
---
It's both. Spies was great at showing the direction people were going cus of the multiple procs.
---
Yep same to me. I played killer and had two survivors DC because fuck me I guess. Depipped. I don’t even think you can black pip if even one DC happens. 
---
Survivors have very strong perks and DS was just a bit stronger then the rest
---
Delicious FUPA
---
That’s implying people care. The good ole mentality of “if I’m not having fun you aren’t either”. 
---
1) it’s not instant heals, just faster. 
---
2) it’s not unlimited, try healing from a used one. 
---
3) killer gets instant down from the same place you got healed from which can possibly down all 4 survivors at the same time. 
---
Sounds balanced to me. 
---
The Killer needs to be stronger than survivors, but I dont think they're OP (excluding a certain medical women). However, I do feel that kind of up to how strong survivors are atm.
---
You the type of survivor to complain about a killer before their released.
---
BoDY pOsi!! tehe!
---
1.	Lithe
---
2.	Distraction
---
3.	Urban Invasion 
---
4.	Empathy
---
Expect to take a hit if you were clearly seen saving surv after they walk away. Unless it's the injured then just down em and chase off or catch the other one, they will learn the error of their ways.
---
THICC
---
YOU KILLED THEM TOO QUICK AND DIDNT PLAY EXACTLY AS THE DEVS SAY YOU SHALL. NO PIP FOR U  
---
make her white /s
---
Not everyone deserves to be rank 1. 
---
Let’s be real for a second, both are hard to counter because the totems are hard to find, and you’re on a time crunch anyway so if you want to get out you have to skip cleansing. That’s the reality of it, it’s hard to counter noed just like it was hard to counter DS, but DS didn’t change the whole course of the match. 
---
NOED's been nerfed at least twice so far....
---
True true.
---
The new Ranking system shows that people care too much about an imaginary number that carrys no significance whatsoever. 
---
The game has actual issues, but lets keep whining about player rank. 
---
not a leak, not a datamine, what are the guidelines to a F#@K UP!
---
it is not edited. Was just the light.
---
Did not think of that, gotta keep that in mind next time i need some bloodpoints. :-)
---
Oh Oof, I don’t understand how you’re not insta downed now because the time of stun is even less 
---
Idk I got camped/tunneled 4 times in a row last night and depipped from rank 4 to 5. Then spent the rest of the evening black pipping due to how hard it is to pip now as solo.
---
Still plenty of garbage teammates. They're just super immersed now and will farm you harder.
---
Killers have very strong perks, and NOED is hella strong but they don’t even consider nerfing it 
---
I chill around the exit gates to make sure that everyone gets out/I waste a little bit of their time by them forcing me out.
---
Or sometimes I just do it to give them some extra bloodpoints. No harm in waiting at the gate, really.
---
You really do not understand math or simple concepts of logic.  
---
\-1st you replied showing you do not understand what a 53% Kill Rate means. Let's even ignore it is 53% for The. Best. Survivor. Map.  Some maps reach almost 70% Kill Rate.  You try to say 53% doesn't mean much because sometimes Killer sKill less than 2. This concept of yours is so baffling since everyone knows that Killers are not guaranteed Kill. The maps having a 53%-almost 70% Kill rate though shows they are more often than not getting 2-4.
---
\-Then you try to argue that 3% is not a meaningful difference.  Their data is large enough that 3% is actually significant.  We won't even bring up the maps that are almost 70% which is almost a 20% difference.  As a comparison, the difference between Myers and Freddy is 4%.  So you must think Freddy is plenty strong since nobody claims Byers needs a buff.
---
So you're whining about survivors being nerfed over and over despite just saying that they've in fact received a fair number of buffs as well... just because you don't think those perks are that good? Then maybe the perks you consider good deserved to be nerfed.
---
*incoming pc progressive rant* xD i don't think it needs to go that far
---
He kept losing us in the corn, he seemed to be relying solely on bbq. We had done 3 gens in the first few minutes of the match. Not sure why he dced. 
---
Or make it any healing action, more ways to get stacks could lead to less farmers
---
Attack of the 50 ft woman, the next DLC
---
Wouldn’t be so bad if they did the rank reset by seasons instead of monthly.  Every 3 months or so when we get a new chapter it should reset. Monthly is pointless anyway, it just gives good players a chance to stomp bad players for a few hours. But then again with new matchmaking, you can get matched with literally any rank.
---
My only issue with this is that I've had A LOT of stupid teammates in my time on DbD.
---
An I can't tell you how many times I've gone for the save, an then immediately after getting unhooked the teammate runs straight into a hag trap, Trapper trap, sprinting Billy, or a blinking nurse. 
---
I've never farmed a teammate before(plus I almost always run BT for campers) an I would be real sad if I couldn't get my tokens because my teammates make poor decisions.
---
I know I get it, a minority of assholes have farmed us all many times and it's annoying, but if you have a teammate who plans on farming you, then most likely they were going to be a detriment to the team anyways, I'd rather not punish those that don't deserve it then punish everyone over a small number of dipshits.
---
angry oink &gt;:(
---
The perks that are being buffed aren’t that good, or aren’t getting significant buffs, Lithes buff is ok, Kindreds is pretty good, but none of them are as significant as the ones the killers are getting. 
---
Get help.
---
CORRUPT PURGE IS SO BRAINDEAD EVEN LEGION IS SKILL COMPARED TO THAT.
---
I haven't read your essay Jund but aren't you worried you're never gonna get anymore survivors at rank 1? I know how much you like to sweat for that rank 1 every month so it's gonna be hard for you to find games. 
---
that freaking thing moans way too much on the hook. like an actual fat girl, she acts like she has to compensate -_-
---
Game Theory: All Legion members actually African??
---
That's not toxic. "Toxic" would be if you're the last one on the gate making the killer chase after you without giving him the last hit. That's just wasting time for no reason.
---
But the whole idea of the game is to try to get everyone to survive. You waiting there so the killer needs to come close and chase you out and in turn give the other survivors a little bit more time is a completely valid strategy. Don't worry about that.
---
are you kidding, one of the first things i did as plague was to pointlessly puke on the hooked survivors
---
If you struggle to rank up, that generally means you are where you should be. This goes for any game. Maybe the system still needs tweaking, but making it harder to pip is ultimately going to divide the players into their actual skill groups. If you are really too good to be at your rank, you will consistently pip. I’ve played the system on ptb and it was alright, and I also saw that they made it easier on live servers.
---
I honestly could care less about NOED since i play both. Were you those players who relied on DS? Honestly thats why a lot of are mad cause of there crutch is gone
---
Most of the times I swing and hit my frame rate drops drastically. It can ruin a chase especially if I'm in the cornfields. I have the original PS4.
---
lol from skyrim?
---
Yup.
---
I try to do gens on the fringe of the map, and I will gen lock us whenever I can, because I am always farmed, left to die in 1 hook against baby killers, and sandbagged hardcore.
---
Other survivors will realize they fucked with the wrong one. 
---
Predominantly I play Killer, but I do play a fair bit of survivor, and I do the same. So I think most people understand. Just having one extra person in the game brings a lot more uncertainty to a Killer, especially if he's got someone hooked, so there's no point in leaving while other survivors are in danger. Even if you plan on leaving if they get hooked, the Killer doesn't know that. Your presence alone puts pressure on them. 
---
I think most people get it. 
---
For me, I’ve been trying to get the adept pig for DAYS now, I can see how gen rush is extremely annoying as well as getting paired with your stereotypical “toxic” survivors, and hatch standoffs are annoying as hell. It feels more like a chore to play killer to me, especially since I can’t get more than 3ks, though that’s probably just cause I’m shit at killed lmao
---
Does anyone like playing Legion?
---
But that requires you to do something...to take the time to cleanse the totems. All the killer has to do here is slap on Enduring and they can freely tunnel without issue. It’s not the same thing. Why is a killer with Enduring going to say “hmmm I wonder if this guy has DS”...when he can just knock him back down in 2 seconds.
---
But I do think legion is nice 
---
IF YOU TUNNEL THE WHOLE MATCH? FUCK YOU. IF YOU HAVE CONNECTION SO BAD IM TELEPORTING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MAP TO THE OTHER? STOP PLAYING KILLER. IF BOTH APPLY TO YOU? EXCUSE ME WHAT THE FUCK
---
Hey, isn't it that case you could win in a competition or something.
---
Well I mean they kinda have to be on gens all game or they’re not gonna get out in the first place 
---
As I said on the other thread, survivors used to be incredibly powerful. Of course there's going to be a shit ton of nerfs to that.
---
Killer main here and I agree, DS needed some changes but now they overnerfed it and it's almost one of these perks that are only situational.
---
Not weak. Balanced. If you can't survive in that, maybe you just need to get better?
---
Dunno man, your original was stupid but this? Once I shared a (wrong) fact, guy corrected me, I said yeah my bad. The funny part? My original comment was upvoted and the admitting that I was wrong was downvoted...
---
That's actually pretty cool I'd love to have that be the norm
---
I think this killer understood, I just felt bad. Especially since it seems like I've been playing a lot of new killers today and giving them the run-around. I want to send a few of them words of encouragement because playing killer in general is a lot to take in but you also have to learn individual killers and their perks. It can be disheartening playing against good survivors when you have no idea what you're doing.
---
What the fuck am I lookin at here?
---
I do it and if the killer appears I take a hit, even take a down if it means the other guy gets a chance
---
Lol, that’s funny cause, I’m not being salty, and your also getting mad at someone who is a child. Not a man child. Shut up toxic entitled survivor main 
---
AS A SURVIVOR I HATE BBQ &amp; CHILI AND I’M SO TIRED OF IT.
---
No not balanced, it’s definitely weak. I can survive without it but I sure would like it. Maybe those of you who couldn’t deal with 4 seconds of stun should’ve got better 
---
Thank GOD you put hag high up she can perform quite well without addons
---
Survivors just love having a massive ego
---
Yeah, but now they’re hella weak, that’s why a lot of surv mains are going over to be killer mains because it’s too hard being a survivor 
---
This is the equivalent of leather face in the basement. They didn't patch that 
---
Wtf?
---
I think ash might just be another bill situation, maybe for console this time.
---
Lol you’re definitely salty if you’re not a man child, go baby sit or something instead of staying here calling me an entitled survivor main 
---
Just do gens, don’t worry about cleansing yourself or getting infected. The only downside to being infected is that you can be one shot, but that’s it.
---
I've never seen anything like it before 😂

---
Me neither.
---
Not at all. Her looping is about as dick cheese as michaels. Unless she is corrupt.
---
I hope so, it still kinda sucks that PC has bill while console has nothing just for it 
---
I mean, Legion is pretty good and balanced.
---
If you honestly think the only issue people had with old DS was the four (really five second, since it was bugged) stun, then you clearly don't understand what the community was thinking. 
---
Well, I've been facecamped 8 games in a row and didn't do anything to deserve it. Happens on both sides. 
---
These new queue times are a gift from God for consoles, it could take up to 40 minutes to find a survivor game just to get dodged before this new system.
---
Ive been consistently getting at least around 60, but on the new map it dips back to 30
---
People are "going over" to try out the new killer. Give it a week or two, it'll go back to normal. 
---
Oh I'm a survivor 
---
It will die down fast, she gets a pitiful amount of blood points. 
---
Same, i just hope they do something about his "mettle of man" perk, its super op
---
No no, it’s not over the new killer, people have been slowly trickling over to being killer mains because it is easier and more fun nowadays. You have all the power, the only balance of power that was left for survivors is gone 
---
Ummm....ok I’m just gonna assume u play a lot of Freddy or something. I’m sorry if you’re misinformed but his power literally interrupted all actions for 1.7 seconds. Therefore unlike Freddy he can stop an unhook, his totem from being destroyed,gen from being finished, gates,etc. I mean the list goes on and even in chase if done correctly you actually can prevent a vault, and if lucky they may tier up and cancel the vault as well when screaming. Although, I will admit that it’s quite situational on whether or not you can prevent a pallet drop
---
It's an old bug it rarely happens
---
Chances are the perks will end up entirely different. Its still a couple months till the next dlc, think how much some perks change just over a ptb
---
At least you got points.  I just got facecamped for the 8th game in a row. Not once did I BM or do anything to provoke the killer. Toxic as hell tonight.
---
Oh boy I can’t wait this is not the perk we deserve, but the perk we need 
---
The only time ive gotten to around 30 frames is on the new map, havent tried corn maps or the other red forest map yet tho
---
That is something ppl can do. Never really thought of just ignoring it. How I play is I try my hardest to not go down to help save ppl at end game. Might have to adjust how I play for the new killer.
---
This bug has been around for a while, so it's not from this patch.
---
Went against a giant Billy once, during the winter event last year. Epic shit. 
---
Thats true. At least his other perks are pretty balanced
---
Shocked the monkey. 
---
I've never seen tgia before!
---
It takes less than 15 seconds to cleanse a totem my dude. Cleanse before gens and you’ll be fine. 
---
in the perk quotes, not audio, I specifically remember david king saying "Come on then, let's 'ave it! I don't give a shit pal." in the flavor text of we're gonna live forever
---
Either way it’s hard to find every single one of them, and you can’t afford the time it takes to hunt them all down 
---
&gt;Not those kind of players that will body block, run in circles constantly and make the game overwhelming for a killer. I sometimes get a headache because they do whatever type of movements they do so that I can not see them when I’m already assuming that I can’t see them since survivors are third person.
---
Lol sounds like somebody doesn't like getting spun .
---
Tbh the survivors should just run in straight lines so it's easier on you.
---
Or would you prefer they stood still?
---
Either people are salty they got downed, or they just needed to go do stuff.
---
With only one game under my belt against her I'mma have to try more loops. I tried one time but some how it made me throw down a pallet while I'm still on her side. Didn't end well.
---
&gt;the only balance of power
---
You mean... the people who are supposed to be the victims in contrast to the (supposed to be) powerful killer... aren't powerful?! Who'd have thought.
---
This community can be EXTREMELY malicious, hostile and toxic at times. My best advice is thicken your skin. And I dont mean that as an arrogant asshole remark, either. I genuinely mean. Let this shit roll off your back. Bad games happen. Often. Of you're a decent human being, you learn to accept being out played. You learn to accept defeat, and you win with some dignity.
---
You'll get stuuupid messages from bitter killers and even worse messages from tasteless survivors. 
---
The game can be fun. Find the right people to play with and enjoy yourself. And remember, at the end of the day, it's a stupid video game. What happens, happens. 
---
Do you hear that? It's called no one fucking asked you Man child
---
Those are probably the ones they'll change. The dev's have been to good about balance lately so we're over due for something bad

If only...
---
i had the same thing happen to me last night, couldnt do anything
---
&gt;~~Survivors~~ both sides just love having a massive ego
---
Fixed that for ya bud.
---
Going down in 1 hit is still pretty bad. 
---
Kind of leaning towards this with my philosphy. I think the increased pip requirements is a very nice change in helping solidify where a player actually belongs in ranking. 
---
I actually managed to escape luckily!
---
Im on ps4 and i play both sides. I went against two plauges last night and got facecamped for using the new ds
---
As killer, i havent gotten the last few shards i need to play her yet, but i doubt ill be as upset as you are. I bought the game in February of 2018 and i played a lot more back then. Typically because I'd get killers who would bring moris and have teams who thought farming hooks is good. Or id get camped super hard for just playing the game well. If you only play the game once a day, you arent going to realize different strategies like people who've played a lot. Practice killer more and youll see a difference. 
---
I'd love to get The Thing as a killer, and R. J. MacReady as a survivor... it sounds so good I honestly would have trouble believing that BHVR hasn't already considered it (or tried to get the license).
---
Dammmmmnnnnn, it'd be so good...
---
Short skirt and high boots? ;)
---
I wouldn’t run around obstacles as a survivor myself , since I myself would also get bored of that. 
---
Just so you know survivors are having it rough with the pip system and if the killer leaves it will Depip them
---
So neither side is gonna be much fun for you if you care about pips
---
New to reddit my comment disappeared but I play as a survivor and people keep quitting out on me as soon as they know its the new killer 
---
Yea there's no way any of us has seen this befor
---
The storyline doesn’t really matter in relation to what I’m saying, people are not going to want to play when the survivors are at a severe disadvantage, even if that’s what it would be like IRL
---
Jane is hotter than both of them though
---
We already know we're getting Ash as a survivor so what better than getting him as a killer too! Evil Ash also has a few different designs if BHVR wanted to splash out on cosmetics.
---
Check out unbreakable, same thing
---
Killer is absolutely more stressful than survivor. I think it depends on what aspects of the game you enjoy.
---
Help me find a meme-worthy scene.. I can put it on my list of to-do. 
---
Just loop her like normal. Dont be scared of the sickness.
---
I countered someone with Head On in one of my games, i started laughing like a mad man... everyone got hooked in the basement
---
Ha
---
Saved up my shards but this outfit is cells only. I wish it didn’t cost about the same as the dlc - it’s cute!!!
---
Every group has extremists don't judge a entire group because of the few.
---
Oof, you’re about to get down voted into oblivion.
---
*press F to pay respects* 
---
probably a bug but come on 
---
Just seeing this makes me buttfrustrated.
---
it is is pretty awesome ;)
---
I mean if killers brought pizza, it might be worth getting basement hooked! :)
---
i didn't have one
---
I'm a survivor main, i used ds on some powerful killers and wrecked em. Im cool with ds being purely anti tunnel
---
*cough*yourname*cough*
---
We both got a massive ego you coccsuccer
---
ACTUALLY, IT DOES ACCOUNT FOR SURVIVORS BEING NEAR THE HOOK SO OOPS
---
Entity isn't real
---
HE IS TRYING HIS BEST
---
k
---
I do play more than one game when I play, I only meant that I get those bonuses at least and then see what I want to do from there. 
---
I had a plague yesterday that barely got to see me since she was chasing everyone else and in the end some of us escaped. 
---
I do have some other killers that work better for me, just seems like some killers get pretty bombed if you don’t know them that well yet 
---
Honestly, i'll never understand people who consider body type of jane attractive.
---
Spider Gen Hump
---
What wise words to come from the internet. I like you.
---
I do not imagine it'll overtake Ruin as a big part of why it is used so often is because a lot of loud people shout at newer players, telling them Ruin is always mandatory (it isn't). 
---
I do like my spider gen hump perk though. I've had a lot of success searching around those generators first as survivors usually spawn there and wander around looking for the next generator instead of hiding. 
---
I dont think it is but it just how fast you can get to the broken status that maybe a problem.
---
By the time you become broken due to the illness,she could've hit you 3 times already and consuming the fountain makes her a better huntress. Definitely not op. 
---
I mean it's hard not to get vomited on unfortunately
---
Haven’t seen double pallets like this since before clowns release
---
I don't really understand why killers have to que tbh. Now it takes me 5 mins of queuing. Then I get a lobby. That's what we want, more waiting around. Survivor haven't noticed much of a difference. At least they fixed the crazy pings and connections from before dlc release. 
---
If you miss the skillcheck you don’t give them the chance to down you lol I make sure a friend is shadowing with a flashlight for my fails
---
She would be stupidly OP if they didn’t heal. The vomit is ridiculously easy to land
---
Honestly she outclasses Clown and Huntress so much because she has an aim skill that really takes no aim 
---
That's because the core of the game is fucking awesome, it's just under a huge pile of bugs, exploits, shitty design choices etc. So we say fuck the devs because we know what the game could be, but we still play it (even though not that often anymore) because sometimes you can avoid the bad part and have a blast. Combine these and you will see that we are really salty because we want the game to succeed (not financially, gameplay wise) It just seems like it can't. 
---
I KNOW THIS 
---
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THIS
---
HE'S MY   **S O N**
---
People found this out yesterday along with the update.......
---
Most unrealistic survivor! It’d be more painful running with them chunks than being hooked! Worth every penny.
---
Never been able to control my dreams before. Sounds awesome af. Always wanted to try all this but it sounds like a lot of work lol
---
Not my loadout went against it as obsession. You can guess how that went...
---
[I enjoy this thoroughly.](https://vredd.it/files/ksnpnak2asm21.mp4)
---
Cmon man, they're doing a pretty good job so far. 
---
Underrated movie.
---
Lmao, rancor is the worst perk on this one, no counterplay other than gtfo. 
---
This is hysterical! And deserves an award. Take my silver award. Cheers. 
---
I spent an embarrassingly long time looking for a stalkyboy 
---
Speak the truth brothee
---
Still Greyboxes then, despite the name Greyboxes are not always Grey boxes, its the matter that everything would be placeholdered in by the Map person before the art time got to touch it.
---
This hasn't been posted 500 times.
---
Planning on it once I can get my ps4 to connect in college. It's a huge bummer.
---
It’s kinda grey imo. It could be considered stream sniping, but they should be playing on a delay anyways. Maybe if you just go post match and see their reaction?
---
David instead of Kate, all the female survivors instead of Meg.
---
[removed]
---
If anyone on the fence, I can confirm using the perk No Mither will count credit toward the achievement.
---
I'm not a dev so it's just hard for me to judge. I love this game though. 
---
I thought broken just kept them from healing all the way though?
---
It looks like Rotten Fields. That map always had odds of having a shortage of pallets due to there being nothing but corn but for the extreme outside map tiles. If those outside tiles RNGed into ones without pallets, then you wouldn't hit the global minimum of pallets without doubling them when possible. Coldwind maps tend to have the most common double pallet spawns from what I seen. It's simply from having the most number of unique map tiles that have maybe 1 pallet spawn or simply don't have pallets at all.
---
Corn and Harvester tiles for example are in ALL Coldwind maps and cover large chunks of them, they don't have a single pallet. Forcing pallets to spawn closer together in other map tiles that do have spawn locations.
---
Oh ok lol. Good luck.
---
Friendly tip: I gave up trying to 4K. When I first started as killer (I play both equally) I would slug the third and try to find the fourth. I used to think: you’ve turned on two gens and now you want the hatch! No way, I earned this. I gave that shit up real quick and took a different approach. “Ok I got 3 if the other guy find the hatch before I find him, no worries. If it’s a hatch standoff he can have it”. I just play for the 3Ks and enjoy killer so much more. Don’t let it become a chore and you’ll be fine :)
---
Oh look, an angry boy.
---
I've watched the VOD afterwards, it's always funny watching them freak out when I'm stalking as Myers
---
I haven't played since PTB, is it still nonsensically difficult to pip?
---
She did not use her barf on him or me. Neither of us has the Broken status effect. She simple pulled him out of the locker and left him slugged on the ground. And no one could pick him off the floor.
---
It's not even about "IRL" or the "storyline". Considering this is a game heavily based on 80's slasher movies, it'd be real strange for the victims of said killer to be more powerful than the killer. Would you watch Halloween if Michael Myers was just getting his ass beat by puny teenagers for the entire movie? I think not. 
---
And they're not "at a severe disadvantage" lmao. I've been able to survive just fine with these changes. If you honestly needed the old stuff that badly, you seriously need to get better.
---
they want people to watch their streams? why they mad if they put the link in their name and I happen to check... while hunting them down and slaughtering them
---
She did not use her barf on him or me. Neither of us has the Broken status effect. She simple pulled him out of the locker and left him slugged on the ground. 
---
gg wp 
---
I got a 4K and only got silver devout
---
I agree with you, but also:
---
Message to all killers: Please when you hook the final survivor and there's no one left to sacrifice please will you just fucking walk away. Yes you killed woohoo I'm proud of you. No need to nod and M1 the person on the hook. Why do you need survivors to watch you rev your chainsaw or whatever every game? JUST FUCKIN WAIT FOR THE SACRIFICE or idk go break some pallets or kick a gen. Thank you
---
All you need to do is not depip to maintain rank, and before they changed it that was super easy to do
---
Seems like it’s becoming more prominent now. As is usual with chapter updates, tho...
---
Killer prob didn't either.
---
Lol says the NOED user
---
Yeah I'm mad I'll admit it but you're comment just screams "Fuxking sirvs pkayinng a gameeee zo unfiar wtf genrush=TOZIC REPORT"
---
PERIODT
---
As I read this post I was getting deja vu I check the user oh duh I watched the video already 😂
---
It’s only been out for like a day, and I def agree they need to tune it some but harder to rank up = better game in my mind. Old ranking system was like if challengers and gold players got matched together in a game like LoL, now it should be more consistent putting good players with good players 
---
^ this... some killers can't be lost... if you can run them you should be able to pip based on that alone. I have nfi what they were thinking when they decided the new system was ready to be put in.
---
BulimQueen^
---
They can only see you if you heal up after getting hit 3 times
---
Neither is anything else in the game, but appeasing the entity is literally the whole premise of the killers role 
---
There aren't any like rules for or against just looking. If you want to be chill just say hi in chat or like glhf but I know the people I personally talk to and I myself would never get mad if someone did just that
---
Ash will probably be released stand-alone (relatively) soon.
---
I think Jane is more appealing per se, but(t) I find that Kate wouldn’t be better to play as. Less cumbersome. 
---
The whole “ruin lasts 10 seconds” thing is super overblown, even in red ranks it consistently lasts at least close to a min which is huge

He was also making a joke
---
At least it wasn’t ruin 
---
What if it was something to do with a crow? And if you have the perk equipped you have a crow perched on your shoulder ? But it gave you third person ? You could make it an activatable perk so when you are in a chase you can smack survivors/ deal range attacks much easier.  That and survivors will never really know if you are looking in third and first person ? 
---
There’s no killer. The perks being leaked for survivor only isn’t a coincidence; it’s gonna be a leatherface esque dlc.
---
It could be a totem which would be fair
---
This is adorable. I like this calendar style, what exactly is it?
---
No? You shouldn’t snipe or play like a dick because they have it but the whole point of putting it in their name is for people they play with to stop by 
---
hey that's me and my lengthy comment
---
Michael should probs be his own, lower tier. It's legit just a kitchen knife. At least legion and clown have some options with a bit of flare.
---
God damn copyright laws. 
---
this is the shirtless michael we need.
---
*a lot of feminists also love boobs*
---
Why run Aftercare with Open Handed? Aftercare has no range. It covers the whole map.
---
Probably because they're not exactly meta.
---
Or maybe people just dislike me, who knows.
---
I dont think its fair to say clowns just a knife. He has a butterfly dagger and he does cool flips with it
---
I'm almost convinced there is a disconnect bug at this point. It's happening in a majority of matches it feels like
---
At least his P3 knife looks somewhat cool, but I wouldn’t place him any higher. The only legion knife I really like is the Karambit looking one that Joey uses. Clown has no good knife skins imo. 
---
Point is if the killer is running enduring ( a very popular perk ) it makes DS completely useless because you’ll get smacked down again before you take 3 steps.
---
The "black lock finder" map addon was broken for a lonnnnnng time. In fact, I can't recall if it was ever fixed... 
---
ikr... people do this shit then don't think and they complain...
---
Her puke could insta down and she’s be more fun to vs than legion
---
Ace Visconti is hot and I see him more when I’m surv. Case in point
---
I had some of my best games today and I didn't even pip at rank 7, I was shocked. 
---
Bloody Glove is the best weapon in the game period
---
The only evil ash I’ll accept are the tiny ones 
---
Oh it's a hobby tracker, I color in the days that I clean my house or draw or different things I want to track
---
I like the new pip system . I can literally play the same and not have to worry about pipping up for every try hard killers.  I used to barely try and get rank one , now really unless I try I'm barely getting it . I get like 25k bloodpoints in a match not even trying and I barely pip. People should only be mad about this system until there are rewards for getting rank 1.
---
Thank you for this. This is the content for me!!!
---
The plag dud3
---
What will the killer be?
---
Thiccer than oatmeal
---
I bet this is what the entity’s genitalia looks like.
---
The broken status isn't a big deal, any other killer would have hit you in that time anyway and you'd be injured. All broken does is ensure you can't just go "I don't care that I'm sick" and play on without going to a fountain.
---
Agreed. 
---
Idk why people don’t like when survivors stand in the gates, it’s free points and takes all of 5 seconds to run them out 
---
Yeah I've seen a few games of someone crashing. I've crashed, too. Still, there are lots of people that DC after getting downed or suiciding on hook. It's so annoying.
---
did you just compare a perfectly well shaped cutie Kate with a saggy Jane butt that looks like it's gonna rip out her pants and we all about to get cellulitis in our faces? 
---
You’re allowed to do it if you’re hitting them, what’s bannable is just standing on the stairs to take them hostage 
---
If it's a stand alone and not console exclusive its going to be extremely underwhelming 
---
Huntress's axe with prestige looks like something out of doom. Way too much meat imo.
---
They want the killer to be the powerful figure they should be, so... no. They're not in the wrong genre. 
---
Hoo doggie, that's a lot of bloodpoints
---
Like I said earlier, you clearly don't understand the problems with original DS. Or, you're just playing thick and trying to screw the argument into something you can actually defend. Plus, obviously the game needs to be changed so killers *are* the powerful figures they should be. *That's* why survivors are getting all these nerfs. 
---
Chilli boi happy noise
---
 How long does it usually take you to get to prestige 3 btw? I haven’t decided if I want to prestige my Feng. I thought I’d get others up to 30+ to get some of my favorite perks teachable for Feng 2.0 and use up her best items first.
---
Yo I’m all for dark humor and offensive shit- but bulimia is not the opposite of obesity- have you ever seen a bulimic do their thing? They can consume more than a 40 year old walrus-man with a 90in diameter beer gut.
---
The two are of the same cut of cloth. 
---
Some people just have to defend everyone else, huh 😘 keep rockin’ it dud
---
It uses the old merciless system, which requires only 4 kills, not 2 pips
---
Not even close, Legion is still the absolute worst
---
Definitely CZ. Source: own 5.
---
lol but if killers have all the power then survivors are gonna get sick of dealing with all the nerfs and quit, rightfully so. 
---
I will never see the appeal of DCing. Worst I do if I get tunneled back on the hook is not struggle and take my pity points. That’s only if the game is a shitshow guaranteed loss anyway.
---
If It’s not, I take my struggle points too in case it helps by delaying a camper or whatever.
---
In ps4 it seems smoother idk
---
Well... you're not wrong.

Right?! Like a new survivor drops you can pour a shit ton of BP into her, throw on the same sweaty asf perks every high rank survivor runs and nothing changes except the cosmetic. A new killer drops and there's a learning curve, learning all the ins and outs of the killer, etc. This is precisely why people generally say playing killer is harder than playing survivor. I've gotten so many survivors that have refused to leave after the exits gates open while I still figure out how to play the Plague that I switch back and forth between her and my "annoying doc" build every other game just so I'm not spending over an hour on just a couple matches.

i prestiged hag only because i thought she looked like covered on ketchup

I'm surprised the core values meme hasn't really been used much in the weeks leading up to this chapter release

The killer being the powerful figure they should be doesn't mean they're unbeatable.

To add to this, it gives you exhaust

She’s awesomely balanced quit bitching or we are going to end up with another Freddy. And it is unlimited because you’re guaranteed to always have 1 clean pool to heal on. And with number 3 should myers, billy and leather face also be nerfed for their insta downs. How about changing your play style and realizing she’s not op by any means. 
---
Was gonna say that
---
They’re getting to that point 
---
oh no not double pallets again
---
I dunno I kinda like the razor one so I can go full reservoir dogs
---
NO WAY survivors are Arnold. Sorry, but you guys will have to settle for being Carl Weathers.
---
People seem to think its tied to the terror radius swap perk. Were you the obsession?
---
I mean the plague will prob tunnel you once she pukes on you because if she just let's you go ur just gonna insta heal
---
According to you.
---
this shit honestly hurts to look at 
---
According to the lots of people who quit already 
---
Pixel art is my favorite, very nice, friend. 
---
I mean that also could just be you. I find killer way more chill than survivor. No need to hit skillchecks, no need to worry about what my 3 idiots are doing, no need to keep track of pallets and loops by the objectives I’m doing. All I have to do is killer is find someone, beat their ass, and the find someone else to do the same to. 
---
imo it was always counter able with unnerving and enduring with dribbling, but hey atm its genuinely pointless unless the killer's dumb enough to run through pallets when carrying
---
Your mom is into an interesting sort of man. And the nurse... but who doesn’t love the nurse..?
---
Yeah it's real hard for meg to run for 5 seconds without being exhausted lol
---
I don’t care about the system for killer as much as survivor. It was already hard to double pip for survivor but now it’s impossible 
---
are all bill perks bugged in console? what about BT?
---
That makes lot of sense actually, once I saw the child's addon I thought she went a little too deep/
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Wow you've genuinely opened up my eyes on this subject. I used to care about rank, around the first month or so of playing, the only reason I got up there.....is because I wanted to see the which colors the ranks got to and if there were any rewards and to my disappointment there isn't. Since then I haven't cared all to much. I started out playing with the intention of ranking up and getting to the top or at least where I should be according to my skill. But then it got dull, I wasnt having fun running the "meta" perks. Usually just some exhaustion perk and self care, but I digress. I completely agree that having longer games, being more engaged in the game and other players, and running less than viable but fun perk builds has brought me much more fun and replayability. I apologize for the novel lol. But thank you for taking your time to put this together and explain the new system like you did. Now that I understand it better I think BHVR did the right thing! :D
---
Nah, plenty feel that way and it's falsity thrown as fact. Idc. 
---
This; the terminology in the achievement refers to a Merciless *Victory* (from the old Victory System for pipping) which is 4 kills and not a Merciless *Killer* rating, which is when you get two pips from the current Emblem System.
---
And not according to the loads of people who are still playing and are fine with the changes. I, for one, am doing fine. Like I said earlier, maybe you just need to get better.
---
&gt;I don't want Enduring touched to achieve such a thing
---
Enduring would still be the same perk. It just wouldn't apply to DS anymore, a perk that is now not anymore what it used to be. It's fair enough that you have a particular gripe with this perk because of its past, but that doesn't affect my opinion on balance.
---
&gt;We don't have 40-60 seconds to mess around
---
You would obviously want to use that time to do other productive things. Slugging is generally a good play even ignoring DS. But it is true that slugging the timer out can be annoying, and I agree with the sentiment that the DS design could have been better. As I've pointed out numerous times now, I am not talking about tunnelling where you just chase the survivor that has hook progress, as that is indeed logical and reasonable, and moreover doesn't compromise the respective tunnelled survivor's chances to play the game. My concern is the issue of those common scenarios in which the unhooked survivor gets downed again immediately, without there being anything they could have done to prevent that. While I do think slugging the survivor out of their timer after getting into a chase with them is reasonable enough given that the timer ticks down during said chase, I would also welcome a reworked DS that more-so punishes farming in particular. Like I had suggested already, for that it would have a ~10 second window after getting unhooked within which being downed would activate the perk, then staying active until used or healed up.
---
I don't feel like getting into discussions about any of the other perks, their supposed counters or otherwise. Enduring currently basically disables new-DS, and that is undesirable twofold to me, in that it all but renders the perk irrelevant for the metagame (since Enduring certainly is a meta perk), and in that new-DS is one of the very few tools a survivor has to help themselves not get farmed. The first concern also simply stems from me generally being a fan of useful and good perks that people actually use because they actually do something, and the second concern is that I just like to be able to have means of succeeding or failing in games due to my own performance, and not having the outcome be decided for me by game mechanics that are largely out of my control.
---
We'll see what, if anything, happens to this interaction - or this issue, more generally, for that matter. I would more than welcome basic game mechanics that help alleviate such scenarios, over trying to doctor around them with perks. DS could be literally deleted for all I care, if instead means of preventing getting farmed would be implemented, means to allow unhooked survivors to secure a fair chase.
---
?
---
It is definitely different from what we're all used to, but I think it is necessary and should stay. I always thought double pips should be reserved for all Iridescent emblems. 
---
This patch in a nutshell...
---
update: *narrator voice* it was not, in fact, a joke. unfortunate.
---
I'm the opposite, Noed is a surprise and I think it takes away a good players chance to take that 1 hit and still get a good chase out of it. But, it's about killers being strong, and that has to be a constant.
---
With Mori offerings, there should be a downside. 
---
That’s very neat. Do you just have copies from month to month?
---
completely agreed. i’ll make a conscious effort to try and get the amount for at least 3 golds, but in reality not every game goes like that and even when i do well its still shit. im hoping they’ll make changes or i’ll learn to live with it quickly 
---
Ah, that's the master plan. People bitched about how it was, now it doesn't look so bad. Switch it back and everyone is suddenly happy with it
---
i don't really have a horse in this race because i never ran DS, but like...i watch a *lot* of killers on Twitch and never really saw anyone get SUPER fucked by old DS like so many people complain about on here? DS counters included:
---
* dribbling  
---
* running Enduring  
---
* slugging  
---
* and situational pickups, like making sure the survivor would drop down onto the basement stairs/DS you in the middle of a wasteland with no jungle gym or pallets to speak of
---
of course there's the odd time when you get DS'd and they jump into hatch or run out the gate (if it's end game), but that necessitated saving it and in all my time playing and watching DBD, very few people ever save DS until the end. most of the time i saw someone use DS, they just got downed again a few seconds later.
---
it just seems silly to me to complain this much about the way old DS worked when all you (the general you) had to do was adjust your gameplay to account for it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ but that's just my take on things.
---
This didnt make the ranking system harder, it made it more obtuse, now you don't rank up, not because you didn't win, but because you didn't win in a very specific and obtuse way the game wants you to win in. You chased them a little too hard, or you didn't chase them harder enough, your hooked them a little too much or you didn't hook them enough.
---
I think the not having the speed boost thing is countered by the quick insta heal from fountains. Just my thoughts. Not trying to say you're wrong or be rude. But I think her ability to get semi quick downs has a solid counter added to the game by the fountains. Not only is it a quick insta heal but it also doesnt require a teammate to heal you and they can work on gens after an unhook, or chase escape.

n u r s e  v i s i o n
---
I’ve been playing all day, consistently getting about 20,000 blood points and i haven’t pipped yet. I’ve been on rank 15 all day. 
---
I think survivors need to be very careful about when and where they use a fountain. It might be worth staying broken to finish gens and not let the plague go into god mode.
---
Easier said than done though.
---
Wow must haven’t upset allot of Legion mains. Sorry I really just don’t have anything nice to say about them. I play on PS4 and every time I have come across a legion they have all been horrible. 
---
It's just a 4k. IIRC you don't have to Sacrifice them either; I personally got Adept Pig with a DC and 2 Moris.
---
&gt; I killed everyone and nothing 
---
AFAIK achievements are kind of wack right now.
---
I've gotten three Merciless Killer 4ks as Plague with only her three teachables and still no achievement.
---
With all the other bugs going around since the new update I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of them.
---
JUST HOPPED ON DBD ON PS4 ONLY TO BE DOMINATED BY THE FACE CAMPING... NOT TO MENTION OP! NEW VOMITING KILLER.
---
I'm a survivor main, you dolt. 
---
Quadriplegic survivors when?
---
this screenshot of a Wii U game looks better than my DBD game, is the joke i'm trying to make. :p
---
your a genius how to fix the game in 2 easy steps
---
"I've been trying to sneak past but i'm dummy thicc and the slap of my giant unsupported breasts is alerting the killer"
---
Your points are not tied to the emblems. Read up the details on why you got each emblem on the end of your rounds.
---
It was much harder to change the course of a whole match with, compared to NOED 
---
&gt;I wouldn’t run around obstacles as a survivor myself , since I myself would also get bored of that. 
---
You probably die alot because trying to survive is boring to you.
---
&gt;I didn’t imply that I wanted the survivor to run a straight line. The insinuation is a bit arrogant, don’t you think? 
---
Another Killer main who supports that.
---
I like the situational change but the perk needs to remain effective.
---
Giving a proper stun the the killer would restore the balance.
---
What rank were you guys before the reset? 
---
I think it should stay too
---
Make your choice!
---
No thanks 
---
Damn your right, my bad for calling out an angry toxic entitled survivor main. My apologies. Have a nice day kind sir.
---
Michael doesn't need a fancy weapon.
---
He's a master at his trade.
---
lmaooo the perk gets no usage in red ranks at all so I’ve found you can throw it at literally anything and the killer will at least turn if not go towards it 80% of the time. I toss that shit at everything and nothing. Killers are already turned around enough in stuff like a cornfield add a random noise notification and it’s golden 
---
As someone who has been playing the plague quite a bit I disagree. If you don’t cleanse you will be broken and injured making it easier to down. 
---
I agree. Enduring has no place being tied to that perk now.
---
I agree; it's so tricky to balance. That 18k person probably couldn't have escaped without that 7k person and vice versa.
---
18k can distract a killer and get some unhooks while the 7k person takes care of gens and totems. It's frustrating sometimes since both have a vital role in the successful escape.

I try to balance both, but I lean way more to killer.

And good god do I hate survivors SO much more when I'm on surv.

\*\*The Glocktor might be my new steam name eventually\*\*

Thats a good point.

I guess it just depends on whether she is close to you when you get sick so getting distance to her early might help (especially since it makes it harder to get puked on aswell).
---
Omg that is not working as intended!!
---
Does it still work?
---
I shouldn't be at red ranks and I'm about to be, send help. 
---
Gonna have to agree. Just played a match with her and gotta say it's a lot easier
---
That’s his point though.
---
She is just a straight m1 killer if you don’t cleanse and just accept the broken status 
---
Sure you will possibly get downed, but she still has to chase you and by the time she does, your team should also be working on gens 
---
But did you find the lobby quickly? Problems solved.

Here’s a link, around 4:40 you can see DBD rise to one of the lower spots and then completely sink.

You can see them at 1:30, 2:14 and 3:14 if you just want to read them.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9KATSK-D_s8
---
NOED is fair. Just cleanse the damn totems. 
---
And then maybe you should go on the hook in that scenario? Why should you be able to extend a chase because of a perk that makes you insta-fall off the killer's shoulder?
---
If one of them died and are extra toxic, they can leave spectate mode early and pre-type a long message, waiting for you to show up...
---
Calm down there
---
Lol because you have to hit a skill check. And also the killer could just juggle, run enduring, etc.
---
And in addition to that, for the 99th time, you can’t always find all the totems, not everyone knows where they all are. 
---
She finally managed to turn the gen into a time machine!
---
I like when they cleanse. It wastes so much time I take my time and enjoy puking everywhere. I can hook them all a few times and let them all live and still come out with good blood point ratios
---
I'm eager to see rank reflect skill too, but I don't think this system was the way to do it. To me it's the equivalent of "difficult" mode in a video game just being extra HP on the bosses. It's "harder" but not in any meaningful or nuanced way that's actually reflective of greater skill. It rewards selfish Survivor play and tunneling with Killers, discourages non-meta perk builds, and it railroads you into a narrow play-style. 
---
The whole system needs a revamp. Not just tweaks in numbers to artificially inflate the difficulty. An actual, proper rework. But Behaviour's committed to duct taping together this broken rank system instead of investing time into developing a new one. Maybe a shiny new elo system? 
---
I don't think the rank system will ever actually be good though. I'm just sad that this one seems to have narrowed the meta. It was originally a fun, casual game, so seeing everyone strong-armed into meta play is a shame. And at the end of the day, the rank system isn't effectively matching Survivors and Killers of equal skill. That was the fundamental problem before, and it exists now, except now it punishes new Killers even more.
---
I met one of my favorite streamers from my country by playing against her and her swf group.
---
Thanks Satan
---
&gt; I genuinely cant see how people find killer fun in the slightest
---
"hey, I've made zero effort to understand another person's viewpoint, but that doesn't mean my conclusion is stupid"
---
You don't need to be faster than the killer, just faster than the survivor your sandbagging.
---
Fuck I hate the edgy teen killer angle. 
---
Oh god. I never thought about the big survivors bug affecting their auras. I hope you had some good laughs atleast.
---
It’s basically built in deranking. Give it a few more days and you will never see red ranks both killer and survivor. 
---
Evil ash hopefully 
---
my funniest moment with it actually screwed me over. I threw it at a window and it was so believable that the killer never left the area. Sticky. He stayed and looked near by for like a minute and found me. I didn't expect him to back track a fake path lol
---
It’s not too hard to do it. Just beware some have learned to hug walls where you can’t hit. 
---
Myers breathing makes me cream each time. 
---
I just got hatch vs bubba on purgation myself
---
&gt;As someone who has been playing the plague quite a bit I disagree. If you don’t cleanse you will be broken and injured making it easier to down. 
---
If you're good at avoiding getting hit then it doesn't matter.
---
I've looped killers for 5 gens while injured.

Closer you are to be ground the faster it feels you go (that’s why planes look slow from the ground).

It was amazing just watching it move with its limbs, or what was once limbs, moving across the map!  Was in a dark room with a bright TV so it did burn my eyes, but it was worth it to see this. My first major glitch in the game so far.
---
Someone's trying to one up jane
---
Any good survivor could hit that skillcheck. It wasn't that hard. 
---
Welcome to the risk inherent in DBD. Nothing's going to go your way 100% of the time.

Here is your upvote good sir

This patch is so buggy borrowed time doesnt work half of the time I've used it
---
Can she vomit on generators?
---
Honestly I don’t care about rank at this point rank doesn’t determine skill very much it more about time played and the fact that there’s no rewards for ranking up just makes it almost useless IMO Bhvr needs to do something about the ranking system, I honestly think it would help the game a ton if they did
---
This.
---
SURVIVORS HAVE A PERK THAT INCREASES EVERYONE'S REPAIR SPEED UP TO 40% BUT THE BEST KILLERS CAN GET IS A PERK THAT SLOWS REPAIRS UP TO 16%....AND IT WAS JUST NERFED.
---
(Facepalm)
---
I encounter the opposite usually, a killer that lets guy sandbagging me go and tunnel the shit out of me.
---
Yeah nurse breathing is lol 
---
Wow. That's felt faster than recovery from a pallet stun
---
So bamboozle on legion should block pallets then? If we are being consistent, of course.
---
Is this sarcasm? 
---
Don’t get me wrong. I prefer female characters personally but we just got a double female chapter and the year 3 road map had a pretty good gender balance. 2 female survivors, 2 male. 3(4 if u count Susie and Julie as separate entities) female killers and 2(3 etc) male killers. If anything I hope they add another licensed final girl character after this chapter. 
---
The Killer is one person, so of course they need crazy perks. If every survivor had a perk like DS, then it's a problem. Survivors have plenty of options in a chase, because they're fairly strong without them as well. Looping the killer doesn't require anything, but some perks can extend the chase when used properly. I wanna say I don't main any side, but playing survivor is so much easier than killer most of the time, so I have more fun as a survivor. My build right now is Dead Hard, Unbreakable, Balanced Landing, and Bond/Empathy.
---
The game was lower in players around this same time last year. That means nothing. 
---
\&gt;:(
---
Nah. I'd settle for more like 1500 or so because the Quitter Bonus we get is 625 a DC.

Don't they already do that?

lmaooo I’ve accidentally thrown it off the map behind me before which has screwed me over. My funniest moments are just when i duo queue with a friend and we just constantly throw the pebbles at each other lmaoo 
---
Uh, no? They did make Ranking up harder? Ranking up was made more obtuse by the Emblem system.
---
Killer main: D-strike was a powerful perk that SHOULD NOT have been changed. If you cant go hit a survivor after 6 second, then that sucks but they totally crippled the perk.
---
I actually am studying this image and all I see is a wholesome Killer. 
---
Wow.. I'm taking deliverance now too.   
---
  
---
And thank you!  
---
Killers get a 2500 bonus from quitters 2000 from dcing and a 500 sacrifice bonus cause dcing counts as a sacrifice 
---
Most of the time, I take a break from the game when a new chapter is released. Playing against the exact same shiny new killer EVERY. SINGLE. $^#&amp;ING. MATCH. is just obnoxious.
---
LF's chainsaw. 'Nuff said 
---
It’s awful. I have no issue at all that it’s a situational perk now, but let’s compare it to a few other situational perks:
---
Adrenaline- requires you to be alive still, but you may not even benefit if you aren’t injured or in chase. However when it works for you, it’s very strong! Definitely worth taking.
---
Unbreakable- requires the killer to slug you. Can be a total game changer though in an otherwise lost game where everyone is in trouble or downed.
---
Borrowed time- requires the terror radius of the killer. Some games itll be useless, but in camping situations and especially end game can result in someone escaping. Very useful perk when it activates (and when it’s not bugged!) 
---
Decisive Strike - requires the killer to tunnel you. However if the tunneling killer has Enduring you will be downed in 2 seconds. If the killer does not have Enduring, your clock could possibly run out if the killer slugs or if you do too good of a job at running from them. USELESS!
---
I respectfully disagree, I don’t think that the killer needs a bunch of fancy perks to be good, what they do is already easy and pretty self explanatory, I think that being a survivor is way harder. You have to balance doing gens, totems, unhooks, heals, chases, etc. there’s all these secondary objectives that make the game fun when the game isn’t one sided 
---
Trippy? Yup. 
---
Hate the game, not the players.
---
Played a match on the new map with four pallets. With how spaced out the map is, that would be a problem, but against Billy, it was a fucking slug-fest. I don’t know what these strong loops are, but I found only the mediocre double L gyms among the small useless walls.
---
It’s still getting lower in players, and I love the game I’m not trying to bash, but I think the reason it’s getting lower is because no one wants to play survivor anymore because they aren’t getting anything good. 
---
Same. I used to enjoy solo queuing but recently I’ve gotten such terrible teammates that I don’t even like to play without at least one friend anymore. I see a lot of people saying SWF aren’t helpful but from my experience I’ve gotten more selfish solo queuers. I played a match a few days ago with a friend and I was 100% certain both randoms were solo, they both played very selfishly, neither of them came to rescue me when I got hooked and my friend was on the other side of the map getting chased. I ended up going into struggle on first hook and my friend who managed to get away from the killer and was injured had to come get me but she went for me and I eventually got hooked again and died. I knew they weren’t SWF because they weren’t even helping each other, they just cared about themselves. Tough game. 
---
She can vomit on anything survivors can interact with like totems lockers vault locations pallets gens
---
Or maybe it's two different groups of people talking? I never asked for a harder ranking system, though I would've been fine if it was a few bars harder. Now it's too difficult, and the previously quiet ones are talking.
---
That’s the name of the game
---
I agree and they also get stuck when one person leaves. 
---
Idk why but her puking on you for half a second was the best part of the vid for me.
---
Chaser has always been problematic, but Jesus.
---
Gachacersevis cringe why have you done this
---
I used to get 5k BP when a killer DC'd, plus the points I got during a match. When did that change? 
---
At first I was surprised at how tough it is to rank up, but now I'm moving up just fine.  Course I'm rank 10, seem to be staying around this rank.
---
The only bad part is is that a lot of survivors now don't even make saves.  Had a game where my friend and I died on first hook cause the other two were just sitting on gens.  They didn't even try for a save.  And that's normal now. 
---
She's really tall so why do people think camping is a good idea
---
Using that same logic, maybe some of the totems spawned far away and you couldn’t find them and then NOED spawns and you had no chance because they’re far away. It’s flawed logic to say that any survivor could hit that skillcheck, everyone misses it sometimes. On the same hand, NOED takes 0 skill. You just put it out there and get your insta-down insta-reward for being bad.
---
Me too. I’m thinking of taking a break from the game since when I finally get a trial it’s always against Plague. I don’t mind her, just sick (bad pun😣) of her. 
---
I read a book between trials, so it’s not a huge problem. Once it said I had a 16 min wait, but it was more like 3, so try not too get annoyed if it’s estimated that it will take a long time.
---
I'm not sure but I keep getting 4k from my categories and that's it
---
I mostly agree but wish they hadn't made Chaser such a pain in the ass. Because depending on the Killer, it's really hard. Trapper especially has to constantly move around picking up traps and doubling back to defend hooks. The penalty feels too severe for legitimate strategies like this. 
---
You are both right. But it’s definitely not working that way since the patch, for whatever reason. 
---
Would be more relevant if BHVR are the people with the pikachu face.
---
After about 500 hours of solo survivor I just hate everybody.
---
Honestly it's my favorite part too. That's why I shook David back and forth lol. 
---
Firebrand Stinger disagrees. 
---
lots of hook perks dont work :&lt;
---
survivor model was scaled 10 times larger than it should be.
---
Found the immersed P3 Claudette,
---
I honestly think this view of the game is too black and white, sometimes tanking a bit for your teammate who’s about to go down is a far better strategy to help all the survivors get out then just M1’ing through a gen, your view seems to imply every survivor should either be immersed or a looping god when that’s not necessarily the case
---
So's Trapper. He made not only that but his power and add-ons from scratch. 
---
&gt;"Leaks are unverified"

~~I mean it's literally in the game. Hopping on a PS4 for two seconds can verify it.~~

Thats what they want even if they dont like it, so no its fine, dont want people tuning into your stream then dont have a stream.

IM JUST SO TIERD OF SURVIVORS BEING SHITTY TO ME IN POST GAME CHAT, I’M FUCKING LEARNING AND EVERYONE STARTS SOMEWHERE. TAKE YOUR TOXIC BULLSHIT AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS. 
---
Dweard though. Even better 
---
Looks like it has potential to be a fun and efficient space, I would have waited to clean up before taking a photo. Just take like a half and hour and it can look very nice.
---
bUt tHe NeW sYsTeM iS fAiR!!
---
mad cause amanda aint cuddly?
---
Why is is your screen pure pixels?
---
What did they do to decisive? I took a small break from this game lol 
---
I view this differently though in that it is supposed to be a deterrent/punishment, so I don’t feel that person should benefit from a perk to counter it. But at the very least, yes it should be like it was before at a minimum.
---
Looks like a graphical bug related to the new killer perk that entity locks generators. 
---
Perfection. 
---
JUST DONT TUNNEL. YOU ARE LOSING 60 SECONDS WHEN SLUGGING OR THEY JUST GET PICKED UP ANYWAYS
---
I've been running it and it's certainly a good perk but I don't think it'll overtake Ruin in the long run. Even though people meme about Ruin being destroyed instantly it's far more consistent. People also react to Ruin differently than Corrupt Intervention. You know CI is in play and you know where to go to avoid it. The games I've played against it I just moved on to another gen or did a totem. But for Ruin you have to work through it or find the totem.
---
Basically Survivors act normally if the Killer has Corrupt Intervention but they act abnormally if the Killer has Ruin, is what I find.
---
I like cleansing: maybe it’s not worth it, but it’s quick and I don’t want to make teammates sick. Plus I just feel nasty due to it! Thanks for the alternate take though. Maybe if I’m nowhere near a fountain I’ve try to tolerate it.
---
What I hate is that the gens are blocked at first. I feel lost because I usually focus on gens. Should I just hide until they are back to normal? What triggers them going back to normal anyway? I’ve played many games against her and must be daft because I still don’t know.
---
FUCK YOU ILL DO WHAT I WANT. FUCK
---
D STRIKE.
---
Fix the game in 2 easy steps:
---
1) Don’t let the Devs touch it. 
---
2) Get someone else to fix it. 
---
Bam. 
---
Those who suffer with bulimia come in all shapes and sizes. You are uninformed and uneducated.
---
Are you bi/pan or do you just really dislike Jane? 
---
Also, you rated Feng so low! She’s adorable! (I’m biased though and it’s good we all have different opinions or too many would play the same character.) 
---
My ranking for girls (I don’t know the guy’s names well) would be (highest to lowest)
---
Feng
---
Nea 
---
Claudette
---
Laurie
---
Jane
---
Meg
---
As for OP, not sure if you’re attracted to her or repulsed.

I feel that, cus I'm not a great player either and yet w/ all my time as Hag and Doc I'm slowly making my way up to rank 10 and above, (was rank 8 before reset)
---
I honestly can't stand the corrupt purge
---
I really don't get how they can justify having people safety pip/depip because the killer is bad.
---
You don't unhook your teammates 8 times during a match, heal everybody 7 times, escape the killer 6 times, do all 5 gens, pallet stun the killer 4 times, stay in the basement for 3 minutes, open both gates, and escape?
---
depip
---
legion is cuddly
---
I haven't flat out disconnected myself but my game is completely freezing/not responding randomly during loading. I was playing with a friend and he told me that it still showed me in game normally but I had absolutely no control over the game and the DBD icon wasn't doing the usual animation that indicates that you're loading. Only way out is to end task. Anyone else having this? Never had this before the update
---
To leave the match, you pause the game and physical press the leave match icon.
---
When you disconnect it, you basically close the entire program, pull out your Ethernet cable etc.
---
Leaving the match makes you lose 2 pips as a killer and all BP, but survivors get BP.
---
Disconnecting from match cause survivors to lose a pip (in the new ranking typically) and no BP
---
Instantly makes you the obsession

---
What do you mean good at balancing? They’ve released another strong killer with good perks, and another weak survivor with a big ass hitbox. Plus they nerfed one of the only good survivor perks and left NOED as it is 
---
He looks like a sideways scream painting
---
ITS MORE OF A CHANGE THEN A NERF AND THE LVL 3 VERSION IS UNCHANGED
---
Legion Classic, Legion Lite, Legion Extra and new Legion Hers.
---
This is a ‘known’ bug. It was happening in the PTB as well, but for some reason, BHVR was dead set on releasing this patch in the form it is.  Broken. 
---
It feels very bad ☹️
---
Everybody else. 
---
The killer is perfectly balanced and the survivor has the same hitbox as the rest and all new survivors suck ass cause there is nothing unique about them like killers. It's just a 7 dollar skin
---
What the fuck are you talking about? They might start out different shapes and sizes but if they continue to suffer from it they end up malnourished. You're a god damn moron
---
&gt;Defends NOED
---
&gt;A perk that legit REWARDS you for playing like a moron
---
&gt;Thinks surv is OP
---
&gt;Thinks the problem is that he is a surv main
---
Tfw being this much a dolt
---
No speed reduction which is stupid
---
No, we only get the 2500 if no one escapes, meaning all survivors are dead by DC, sacrifice, or Mori. Otherwise, we get the 625 Quitter Bonus and that's it. 
---
It's worth noting, however, that if you Mori someone and they DC in the middle of the animation, you get 1000 for the killer AND the 625 Quitter Bonus post-match. 
---
The gens that are furthest away are blocked. Find a closer gen to her but don't get caught.
---
After seeing Jane, my bf no longer uses the word “thicc” to describe me. I have a big butt and breasts with a little waist - that’s what we thought “thicc” was since I’m an average weight overall - definitely not skinny, but have a small frame and some muscle tone. Jane needs a new word to describe her body.
---
You could swap out Dwight for Claudette, she belongs there more. Either him or Ace.
---
MAN, I SURE LOVE LOOPING THE KILLER FOR 5 GODDAMN MINUTES FROM THE START OF THE MATCH ONLY FOR THEM TO DC AFTER THEIR 10TH PALLET STUN AND I LOSE A PIP BECAUSE OF IT.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SYSTEM?
---
Opposite for me. I get matches real quick now 
---
Yep. It was somewhat tedious to get a match as Killer now, but this?

What'd you say about Michael's weapon?
---
It says in the description in the store.
---
It’s just a fucking knife. 
---
I have 2 basement game experience with the plague and it was horrible. She was running agitation and iron grasps lol. I think she should be in phase mode while puking like Myers when stalking
---
This is why fedora man bad 
---
Your flair is hot
---
That used to happen all the time, survivors became way too powerful awhile ago. Also it's asymmetrical, the killer should be more powerful than a single survivor.  Ds did need a nerf 
---
I agree that it's time Survivors got some love in the grand scheme of things, but you're high if you think killers are the favored role.
---
They're waaay more better off than they ever were, but nowhere near the point where killers blatantly have the advantage. The only killers that make it even seem that way are Nurse (who doesn't even play Dead By Daylight. She ignores the game) and Spirit (Because her kit is a little silly. No punishment for whiffing a really strong power that isn't /that/ hard to use, and her passive phasing on top of that).
---
What.
---
Your Meg is cuter than real Meg:)
---
Although it's a bug it looks very pretty 
---
Same thing happened to me in the new map with a legion, the team was trash, 2 DCs and when I finally did the gens, the legion gets me, hooks me and then I go to third person camera view for the legion, also the game was pretty fucking laggy even at good ping, this game is getting worse 
---
She’s strong because of that puke range but not OP, just people aren’t used to her
---
Same with apex legends, this games barley function on their intended platforms, let alone a tiny switch
---
*laughs in 28 stab wounds*
---
&gt; you literally don’t have time
---
There's literally all the time in the world. The problem is you wanna genrush and focus on nothing but gens.
---
&gt; and doesn’t need a counter since it’s hard to hit
---
Like I said, any good survivor can hit it. Any good survivor can also run loops for minutes at a time. Being able to half reset a chase after a gens'-long chase is broken. 
---
&gt; and then all you killer oriented mains came in
---
You literally called me and other people a killer main, so don't pretend you didn't, lmao. People have been having an issue with DS for a long time, this change was sorely needed. And thank you for assuming I want to be a badass, that made my day. 
---
What platform
---
Steam? PC?
---
Not sure then sorry 
---
Thanks for the tips
---
I've been doing decently against higher ranked killers, my issue is that it gives me just below the +1 pip EVERY TIME no matter how good I do 9/10 games
---
When it comes to BHVR, irony is a best seller when it comes to skins
---
I’m on PS4. Can it be done there?
---
reminds me of the first time i played against the pig. 
---
saw her crouching in a corner and thought it was a survivor, went up to try and heal her. things didn't turn out well. 
---
But doesn’t she block gens at first? And what causes them to return to normal? (Sorry for asking on two threads - I couldn’t find an answer when searching.) 
---
Give me Ash and the Cabin. That’s all I want. Throw in a spooky fog killer that possesses things and turns em into deadites and I can die happy.
---
Nope I always bring a Mori and watch their reaction when it pops up in the loading screen / when I kill them 
---
As a gay male Killer main, I only bought The Plague, not Jane.
---
Nah I'm a god.
---
No, if we were to change for consistency I'd say "window vaults" in the description. It's somewhat consistent already with blocking as pallets cannot be blocked by survivor vaulting.
---
Calling on the entity to block a window doesn't affect pallets just cause its called vault. Picking and choosing which stuns enduring affects is different.
---
On Xbox if we click the home button it opens the menu for Xbox which then we won’t hear the game volume 
---
I can't help but think of my friend who would say in this situation, "Later biiiiitch."
---
I’m glad someone agrees! Maybe it’s just cause I’m a gay but I truly don’t think I’ve ever seen a body like this.
---
2 Old DC was much easier to play against than NOED. DS happened, they had 4 seconds to stumble away, and if you couldn’t catch them your a garbage killer. They bought maybe 30 seconds at most, which is really pushing it. 
---
3 God forbid anyone uses words that are longer than 5 letters 
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
She has a speed reduction if she holds it when fully charged, and she has a short reduction after she uses it.
---
I can probably guess one of them cause the guy had a Nurse avatar. Without naming names, his name may or may not have something to do with stars lol. Just a couple days was all it took to see the insanity over there. I legit fear that the devs think their posters represent the community. 
---
I think that might be why I like survivor better, killer feels so extremely slow- I like doing things fast and my way, with killer everything feels like it takes hours to do and out of my control. If a survivor has a perk that can out do mine or quickly break a hex like ruin, I’m left in the dark almost and I’d have to depend on skill- which I obviously don’t have much on killer lmao. I’ve been trying to get better, I only have abt 20 hours on killer so I’m no where near experienced as killer mains, but I’d like to understand their points of views better and such.
---
no
---
the new rank system is amazing
---
as good as the hitboxes and the 9/10 400 ping lobbys
---
best game experience 
---
Going to have to agree.  It was funny the first time and every attempt after was unoriginal and.... a flop
---
So, again, you got a 4k and are complaining? 
---
Was your 4k not breeze easy enough for you? Maybe smurf down some more ranks? 
---
Im really tired of these whiny matchmaking/rank posts, this game has so many issues and everyones sucking each other dicks over meaningless pips. 
---
That's what happens when you face Doctor
---
If a girl is pissed off enough to bother sending you a long ass message, maybe you clowns actually did something worth ranting about
---
Exactly, look at what you said. YOU don't find it fun, others do. Hence why people enjoy soccer over tennis, or becoming a doctor over a lawyer. Preferences. 
---
Don’t worry I know exactly who you’re talking about...there are others on there who are similar to him or worse. I go on the forums sometimes but everyone there has a stick up their ass. It’s just one big cesspool of biased killer mains jerking each other off. Barely any of the have balanced opinions.
---
Have you been to a college bar? 90% of the time you’ll piss a girl off that way
---
&gt;will now
---
Lol
---
By *biggest bug* I meant biggest for me, I'm sure there are other issues that are much bigger, I just have trouble seeing dim visuals.
---
Last night as killer on PS4 I was only getting survivors with 400-700 ping. Played one game just to get my daily done, they turned out to all be rank 5 and 6, I’m 12.
---
As solo survivor, I was joining green ping lobbies instantly. In a 3 or 4 man swf we got nothing after waiting 20 minutes, ofcourse the message on screen was &lt;1 minute wait.... sad face.
---
Not with that attitude.
---
I've been trying to click the leave match button for days now, but I just can't look away...
---
Man, if that's your case, you must consider LF the most OP character in the history of DBD.  Instant down that can possibly down all 4 survivors at the same time, without needing to go to a fountain for it.
---
Yeah, I never said other people couldn’t have those preferences? I’m just saying I don’t find it fun, like several people in the comments are saying they don’t find survivor fun, that’s their opinion and I don’t care about it, I’m not telling them to keep it to themself or anything lol. 
---
For this particular game, I’d say I’m casual. None of the ones I play are pro type games or fps. I based it on the number of hours played. Also, I can hula hoop with a weighted hoop while playing strategy games. 
---
Also, there was a cute girl on a reality show who was a pro and looked incredible.
---
I used ds against a killer while we were just a couple feet from the exit gate, since he had enduring though he knocked me down again before i even got to the gate.
---
Thanks! I thought they were all blocked or unblocked.
---
She's throwing you a going away party
---
If only half of the suggested perks weren’t bugged right now....
---
owo
---
When I saw another notification I was bracing for impact, thanks for understanding and having a sense of humor out here
---
2. You've clearly never heard of good survivors taking the killer on a minutes' long chase, finally going down, then DS-ing the killer and starting that chase over again. "Garbage killer", lol. 
---
3. Lmao, what.
---
yeah the killer was cool
---
28k and 1 pip tho
---
When I played yesterday, a lot more killers were dropping survivors and trying to make matches last longer. Back to back matches, almost identical scoring. One depipped me and one pipped me up.
---
The new scoring system is ridiculous and honestly ruins a lot of the fun for me.
---
its the ghosts of dead survivors fixing gens RIP
---
2 The chase shouldn’t last as long as before because LIKE I SAID BEFORE: They’re gonna be exhausted, Injured, and the pallets nearby are gone and if they aren’t and they got juked without a pallet than a killer really sucks
---
3 You thought it was funny that I used a big word I guess. 
---
Yeah the new patch has a lot of boo boos and oopsies, but everything should be fixed hopefully sooner rather than later! 
---
I highly doubt it. The Console part, not the solo part.
---
Bill is owned by Valve so it makes sense that they'd want to use him to try to steer people towards their platform.
---
Ash is a character that they licensed in order to sell copies, and I'd imagine they want to sell him to as many people as possible.
---
If only the solution was obvious. Ah well. 
---
It's because people who are actually good at the game have played enough to know what it's like to have toxicity directed at them and care about what happens to the community.
---
New Killer just came out two days ago that you don't know how to play against? 
---
Better get frustrated and leave when the majority of the Killer community wants to play with their new toy instead of learning how to play against her. 
---
Emblem changes have killers taking side jobs just to pip. 
---
Id be fine with ash being alone or with a killer
---
also bit different eyeshadows and hair colours 
---
but yeah, stupidly unnoticeable just like Adam's default hair and that 90s haircut. difference is in a tiny centimeter but one is free.
---
I wasn't and Billy wasn't running that perk to begin with
---
op please Nerf, stunning for a half of a second is broken! /s
---
Good to know! Weird af glitch
---
Another chunk is because they’re balancing the game around SWF so much that survivor just really isn’t fun to play. It’s easier and more rewarding to play killer right now. 
---
LITERALLY EVERY COMMENT HERE IS ABOUT THE EMBLEM SYSTEM! WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE NEW MATCHMAKING SYSTEM?! I STRAIGHT UP CANT GET A LOBBY BELOW 300 PING AND CANT GET A KILLER LOBBY AT ALL! FUCK THIS NEW MATCHMAKING SYSTEM! I GENUINELY CANT PLAY THE GAME RN BECAUSE OF THIS!
---
Yup same thing happened to me. I just left them there.
---
Yup! Apparently it also works for anyone spectating at that moment. My friend, who had already escaped, went to spectate and instead of seeing a Laurie on the hook, he saw a 3rd person perspective of the Spirit
---
So a perk that lessens stuns lessens the stun from a perk that creates said stun? Sounds like it's working as intended. 
---
Eff the change
---
Most people rejected his message. They hated Jesus because he told them the truth. 
---
This has happened to me 3 times as survivor since the latest patch, I was expecting some glitches because everyone was rushing them to get the dlc out but this patch has been ridiculous.
---
Sadly in the movie(s) that’s the only outfit Amanda wears as “The Pig” . 
---
I just played a couple of games as killer and it took little to no skill to knock people and hook them. No camping, no insidious, just always running around the map. After killing two in a few minutes it was more fun to mess around with the survivors and let em escape. In my opinion it takes more skill to be a survivor than a killer. Perks let me know where they were at almost all times and chasing them was fun but it got boring real fast once they start dying.
---
I mean you can see Hag’s nips and p l a g’s coochie so eh
---
It sucks because it was my third ever Nurse game. I'm completely terrible with her.
---
That must be mildly terrifying. 
---
Or squeeze a shit out squeeze it back in
---
I mean, if you're able to take the killer on a chase that lasts for longer than say, 30 seconds at most, when you're injured, bleeding, moaning, and (most importantly) only one hit away from going down... I think that should be counted as a whole new chase. 
---
I said the same thing. It caught me completely off guard. However as others have said, 128 meters is pretty much the entire map so if you cant see them you know they are far. 
---
A
---
I watch the VOD and most of the time say hi to them, but I don't check em out before the match 
---
The same 3 legion circlejerk memes get funnier every time
---
Boosted killers meme of the day
---
Makorrrr cleavage. I aint complaining tho ;) 
---
&gt;If you carried your team and did all the gens, you deserve to rank up
---
&gt; Why? You held M1 for 5 minutes. You did nothing skillful. You didn't carry the game, the guy kiting the killer all game did.
---
excuse me but what
---
Gens are the objective of the game. The **OBJECTIVE**.
---
Doing all 5 of the objectives deserves a rank up. What are you on because I want some of it.
---
BH GAMES FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME BEFORE U PUT MORE CONTENT 
---
I’ve never used it honestly but sounds more like a nerf than a rework 
---
Unless the killer is plague
---
Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Hope, and taking damage from the Killer = Battering ram through the exit gate
---
I don’t think that’s all they’d do but yeah it was just a theory, I don’t know what they’ll do. To me it makes sense since it would be a smooth process as they would already be in talks with licenses holders for another property they own and I’m pretty sure they are pleased with how the Saw DLC turned out so why not make a few more bucks off it
---
I just want old DH back, it was so much stronger and had more mechanics
---
Swf groups lose what few brain cells they have when you camp their hook. Its hilarious
---
I personally know someone shaped EXACTLY like Jane irl. Not too uncommon.
---
Honestly, I play mostly killer (though I make time for my boy Jeff).  I do think that when a killer is able to be actually doing things, if they are halfway competent, their victory (in that one instance) is guaranteed.  A killer in a chase should eventually win it.  A survivor is just trying to make the best of a bad situation, but ultimately the goal of each role is in their names: a survivor is trying to survive and a killer is trying to kill.  They should be most rewarded for doing those jobs.  Everything else, while fun and needed for the game to be more dynamic, is superfluous.  If, say, a survivor couldn’t leave the trial until they were chased for say 1 minute, then I would agree it’s a needed part of survival, but as it stands I’ll never blame a survivor for rushing gems because that really is their goal.
---
Same, I didn't went for the heal but I also didn't ran away when she came to me. But in the end I was able to escape trough the hatch.
---
The days of the Beta no longer exist. The reason things are the way they are now was due to how people managed to exploit the game in the past and continue to do so to this day. Not blaming them, it's just what happened.
---
Self-destruction 100 
---
that looks like those horrific bugged character models from the sims
---
“teabagging proved your skills!”
---
oh no I'm a legion main
---
Ahh yes a Legion player
---
AURAS GOT TONED DOWN AND DARKENED SO FINDING GENERATORS AND HOOKS AS KILLER IS MORE DIFFICULT AND BBQ IS DAMN NEAR USELESS.
---
AND PIPS ARE POINTLESS NOW. K THX.
---
Had this the other day as soon as the DLC came out. Couldnt move left or right at "wiggle" speed or else Id get stuck standing still. Ended up ruining the game for both myself and the other players. Accidentally sandbagged due to it. :( This patch has been a complete downhill since launch. 
---
Make WGLF actually benefit the teammate you're saving instead as the name implies. 
---
Personally when I'm the last surv in trial and an exit gate is opened I try to stay cuz of bonus bp for escaping the chase, healing etc, not to tbag or whatever
---
Imagine caring what survivors have to say about anything dbd related lol
---
IT SUCKS *slam* PLAYING *slam* THIS SHIT
---
I feel like I went up against a trapper who did this very thing... were you on PS4?? 
---
You have no idea... Its so bad. As a survivor main, Ive resorted to only playing killer for a bit. Cause being rank 11 and going against sweaty red ranks is absolute hell, especially when you have 19-13s in your group who arent as "understanding" as higher ranks. 
---
I cornered someone and revved my chainsaw the other day. They disconnected immediately. What's the point of playing the game if you're just going to quit *before* you even go down?
---
F
---
I think we all need to. 
---
ah
---
The Legion Looks Amazing(Except For Joe, He's Meh), Change My Mind
---
ok but were you just gonna let yourself get hit on that gen or did you know adrenaline was coming
---
That chainsaw hand aint for repairing things baby.
---
To be fair if it was "i slept too long" ash, it would balance out. Sort of.
---
From what i've seen its at least 10 hooks, stopping before 2 gens while kucking some and chasing not immediate downing people. 
---
LMAO yes! Im tired of looping the killer for 10 minutes, only two gens get done, they all die, I depip. Solo survivor is unplayable right now
---
When playing as Trapper I get caught in my own traps for their entertainment 
---
Yep, got a tank 8 killer. I was 13, everyone else below 15. No gens completed. 
---
Was legion too lol
---
You can stay in a vomit'd locker without getting out, and you won't get infected.  You only will get infected if you leave the locker while it is vomit covered.
---
I feel ya there. I've seen Rank 2's that hide the whole game and run in a straight line through open ground when running. But when I'm Killer, everyone over Rank 15 knows every loop, every pallet and window, and anyone with a flashlight will stun you every time. Now that I think of it, I don't even see flashlights in my survivor game, let alone successful ones.
---
Bruh.avi
---
Technically would have been better to get hit. You’d get the boost, run off with both damage and adrenaline boost, and at full health all while Freddy did the hit animation.
---
I can't stand it, its not even taunting its just being a dick. And then they leave right when the match ends.
---
FUCK NEW MATCHING SYSTEM IT TAKES FOREVER TO MAKE A GAME DAMMIT WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT WHEN I AM THE HOST???
---
That's with Endurance on 
---
Except he already did the hit animation?
---
Legion is by far the most enjoyable stabby boi I played with.
---
The PTSD flashbacks
---
Honestly I want MICHAEL to be nerfed now. The whole point of DS was to prevent his one shot ability- now every Michael is getting easy kills and you can't stop it. (Including one who Insta moried me on sight because fuck me.)
---
That's a wholly different problem than "should DS stop during a chase or not?". 
---
Happened to me too... with the Plague and in Gideons as well. 
---
# P R E T T Y
---
I brought a streamer as a legion a day ago I feel personally attacked
---
He did the swing animation, but he didn’t hit OP. He would have had the shorter miss animation, where if he hit he would have gotten the longer animation of shaking off blood.
---
Lmao you right brother
---
No problem.
---
Yeah. And with how gens still get slammed out, you could potentially spend more time waiting for a game than actually being in a game. It's ridiculous that killers have to wait to get into their own lobby.
---
yep im sure theyll fix it next patch
---
Don't care if it's a five BPS game, my ass out is out of there the second I see someone bleeding.
---
To be fair I’m getting stomped by high level killer right now as is (I just picked up the game, around rank 15 on survivor) I’ve been consistently going up again rank 5+ 
---
Lmao i freaked out when i saw it earlier, haven't seen it since like 2017. Reminded me of the Claudettes with insta blinds and pallet vaccum, haha.
---
I know all the Michael mains are happy, they get free kills with tier 3 and you can't stop them cause DS is nerfed.
---
Played a game last week where the third survivor killed themselves so Claudette could have the hatch. Had BBQ, knew they were going to get it... so I went about breaking pallets, kicking gens. Every now and then there’d be a noise, probably vaulting a window near the hatch or something. I ended up going and making coffee and coming back TEN MINUTES LATER TO A GAME STILL IN PROGRESS. She finally left a couple minutes after that. 
---
My dudes... my precious dudes... not about that hatch stand-off life and defo not about running across the map for your lil victory dance.
---
*Laughs in facecamp*
---
Not even close to what I said nor implied lol. But you go on ahead thinking so :) 
---
Once again, thanks to u/ZombieHuggerr for the template, you are awesome man.

it's very easy. check out my 'guide' here https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b3l8ci/how_i_did_devoted_gatekeeping_trophy/?

The one who gets moried at the exit gate and gets messaged saying "git gud" at the end by the nurse.

Watch I bet they'll nerf deliverance next.

God you're so brave, you're going against the mold and speaking what everyone is REALLY thinking

I play a little bit of The Clown, and I'm definitely not the best, but there's a few ways to play him. You could focus on slowing down gens by using Discordance, Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel, and BBQ&amp;Chili. Discordance is an iffy perk and could be replaced but this is definitely a good build to slow down the game drastically, you'll know where people are if you hook someone and almost completely revert Gen progress afterwards along with making it difficult in the first place to fix them. If you wanted to focus on permanent damage to a survivor I'd run Coulrophobia, Dark Devotion, Distressing and Unerving presence. This makes your terror radius large, which is a downside because they'll be able to sense you, but once you hit your obsession they will have an really tough time healing themselves and running to other survivors will make skill checks harder along with healing rates lowered. If you use your bottles correctly you will be able to corral survivors close enough for you to hit them regardless of your terror radius though. Hope this helps.
---
getting 0 pips isn't a loss though, just means you are where you should be basically. Tbh if you're consistently rank8 on the old system rank12 might be where you end up on the new system.
---
And that's not to be rude or harsh or anything like that, just that things have been shifted down basically. A good example is when CSGO did a huge downrank sweep. many people lost 3-4 ranks seemingly randomly, and it was because they changed the internal MMR to redefine what ranks were placed where. Global elite when from like 1.8% to like .4%. which doesn't seem huge, but when you look at the remaining 98% of the community being downranked as well it seemed much larger than it was.  
---
A lot of people have been up and arms with it, but I welcome it tbh.  
---
Just ditch the monthly reset is all, that's useless if there are no rewards.
---
*Excuse* me.
---
Yea, feels bad.  Something to do with the new matchmaking.  That's a whole other issue atm.
---
Yea......this isn't a real survivor main. I guarantee if you don't play SWF, you aren't winning most of your games.
---
Yeah I reported them for harassment but I don’t know how seriously it’s taken on console. I’ve gotten a few hate messages before but it’s usually when I’m the killer and never this bad. 
---
I love how everybody has to make sure they tell everyone what side they "main" to be taken seriously. Am I just allowed to say I play both sides and want the base time of the stun increased to 4s and the glitching fixed once you get hit by it as killer?
---
Yeah. I play Survivor every once in a while to get in their heads, and every single god damn time, it's the other Survivors that piss me off.
---
I'm always baffled by how they manage to fuck things up even more while fixing minor things. They're amazing. 
---
Spirit is scary but shes also pretty unfair to go against. Shes got so many tricks up her sleeve you just have to say fuck it and hope you dont go down.
---
Il probably get downvoted for this.
---
Dont care about the new matchmaking system since i just want to have fun on both sides no matter if i pip or not.
---
I had just got The Plague to level 12 and I was playing on her map. It was my first time playing her with and I only had one good perk (the one that blocks 3 gens). 3 of them after completing all gens and only getting 6 hooks jumped in and out of the locker jungle as I chased the 4th guy down. It was almost like there was no sound besides the boom. At least when one person does it it's got some space... this was just painful.
---
I can do killer perks/abilitiy/add-ons. Give me a bit.
---
Same I usually let then spank me out the gate. Everyone should get some points. I only teabag if they were straight facecamping during the match, and I dont let them spank me.
---
Dangerous in what kind of aspect? Sure I wouldn't hug the iron cactus that is my boy Evan but neither would I want to be fried alive when giving Carter a snuggle.
---
Links for all of those that you can show, please 
---
As survivor it’s basically the same, killer takes forever
---
Boo hoo 😭. It's okay. At least a grand total of 5 people enjoyed your shitty post. 
---
This what I wanted anyway
---
Cooldown addons completely negate this for the most part fyi 
---
I love it for 2 reasons; 1. Less tunneling, and 2. Less sandbagging in solo queue
---
Gonna use it every game just for that
---
She is actually faster than huntress do she’s similar to billy etc. She is only huntress speed when she is holding the vomit ready to throw up 
---
They absolutely become malnourished, but that word does not mean what you think it does. Malnourished =/= thin. But ye, most def malnourished. I know exactly what I'm talking about as I have first hand experience with eating disorders, so honestly your try at discrediting me is futile. Bulimia is definitely an obsession about ones body/weight but that isn't all it's about. Anyway you little shit, ✌
---
Enduring, Rancor, STBFL, BBQ&amp;C is a good start.
---
You need a 4K, it doesn’t matter if you get merciless killer or not, it’s only with a 4K and a certain amount of BP
---
I would rather it have a 20 second timer that stops in a chase than a minute timer that doesn't.
---
DS went from meta to straight trash and needs some kind of change to actually be useful again.
---
The girls that are describing their bodies.. LMFAO just answer Kate or Jane. Attention seeking imo  :x
---
I never used it before the nerf but it's helped me escape twice since then so I can't agree with you there.
---
I strongly recommend Save the Best for Last (good mindgame because they'll think you have Remember Me, it saves time Freddy desperately needs, and gives him help in a chase). I use STBFL, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. 
---
I’m a gay male survivor main, who plays legion on weekends. 
---
Guess you haven't seen it used against a killer with enduring. 
---
If you are really going for a 4k then you HAVE to slug.  Even if it's kinda shitty for the dude on the ground...  It's better then doing the fucking hatch standoff.  Doing the "Oh great now to hunt the survivor who's immersed and slowly scouring the map for the hatch, gg", is so boring and I wish I could just concede the match right then and there because holy shit do i HATE the hatch standoff.  I get why the hatch exists but fuck me.

---
For me, the game as solo survivor has gotten a whole lot less fun. There's so few pallets on the map that whoever runs the first chase creates massive dead zones. Couple into that having game after game of camping/patrol, basement deaths, ruin nurse/Billy/spirit, ridiculous latency hits, moris, 2/3 man games, bloodlust buff, and sweaty killer mains it's borderline unplayable 
---
Oh I have, and I've been hit with it as a killer with Enduring on, they don't get far. I wont complain if it's adjusted for Enduring because I was literally back on them instantly. In those cases I wasnt trying to tunnel but they ran back into so what's a killer to do?
---
Not having “Cover Girl” by RuPaul as the music is the biggest missed opportunity of the century. Nyaaas cyst. 
---
Doesn't it become a veiny knife?
---
I was telling her to find the leyomi one that goes “kak kak kak ka boom”
---
Agreed.
---
Okay so if you kite the killer all game and a literal trained monkey does all five generators while you are being chased, the monkey is better than you? Got it.
---
I ran it on a regular green map and I was able to find the hatch with it. The aura for it makes it look like a big, unsettling square on the ground
---
I PLAYED AS PLAGUE WITH ONLY HER 3 PERKS AND KILLED ALL 4 SURVIVORS AND DIDN’T GET ADEPT PLAGUE TROPHY ARGH!!!!!
---
&gt;I just want to point out that in other games if you ROFL stomp the other side, usually you don't rank up much. It's the other side that deranks.
---
This is absolutely not true for most (if not all) games with serious, competitive matchmaking.
---
Elo and Elo-derived ranking systems are zero-sum, and virtually every game I've ever seen that's willing to talk about what it's doing under the hood is using a modifed Elo system. Every point you earn after a game is a point you took off the other side. You rank up exactly as much as the other side deranks, always. *Your gain is their loss, their loss is your gain.*
---
To determine how many points the winner should take off the loser, these systems use the difference in each side's matchmaking rating and often - since many videogames have easily quantifiable degrees of victory - how much one side kicked the other side's ass.
---
So if you 4k 5gen against survivors the same rank as you, you should take a decent chunk of points off them. You shouldn't roflstomp people the same rank as you, so your ranks should move apart a bit, and since it's zero-sum that means you go up as much as they go down. If you 4k 5gen against survivors much lower ranked than you, you should barely take any points off them at all. You should roflstomp people much lower ranked than you, so neither side's ranks should really change at all. And if you 4k 5gen against survivors much higher ranked than you, you should take a fuckton of points off them. You shouldn't roflstomp people much higher ranked than you, so your ranks should move closer together, and since it's zero-sum that means you go up as much as they go down.
---
Meanwhile in DBDland, if you 4k 5gen against survivors the same rank as you, the net change in "points" is barely anything. If you 4k 5gen against survivors much lower ranked than you, the net change in "points" is... barely anything. And if you 4k 5gen against survivors much higher ranked than you, the net change in "points" is... still barely anything. In the end, it doesn't matter whether the result is expected or unexpected based on the two teams' relative skill, a 4k 5gen is always an equally almost meaningless game.
---
And this is the really, really important part: **if you have a long, drawn out game in DBDland, it doesn't matter who wins, everyone gets "points" (pips)**. Imagine the worst two chess players in the world, playing games against eachother over and over and over for fifty years... until finally they're the #1 and #2 ranked players in the world. Not because they're actually that good, but because every match they have gives them both points. They don't need to get good, they just need to sit down and keep playing and the system will give them points out of thin air until they finally take the #1 and #2 spots. This is how DBD's ranking system works. It's absurd. And this is why it's impossible for DBD's ranking system to ever truly measure relative skill.
---
The system needs to be gutted and overhauled.
---
Ruin, Brutal strength, Remember me, Noed. 
---
I feel you let the second one go?
---
She honestly looks like they designed a normal sized woman character then decided to tinker with "character creator" like you posted and decided to make her plus size to give the game more "variety". I'm not surprised in the least though as once I saw the route they went with Jeff I knew they'd do something like this with a future female survivor. This is the age where all demographics have to be catered to in the most absurd ways possible. 
---
&gt;healthy long legs
---
we're speaking of her being diseased and being basically a supernatural being or are we talking of her beautiful body structure outside the, well, plague marks? 
---
her breasts are also totally fine, she doesn't miss any even in plague.
---
also, i just checked out this model. are you seriously not seeing the fat turning into cellulitis? 
---
that is cute and curvy and healthy http://dorpsdokter.nl/wp-content/uploads/N20HX/template-GJi58oDsDJfw.php?getimage=aHR0cHM6Ly9pLmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9pL3BpeC8yMDE2LzA3LzE2LzAyLzM2M0ZENjhGMDAwMDA1NzgtMzY5MzAwNy1pbWFnZS1tLTM3XzE0Njg2MzExNTc3NjIuanBn

---
they don't even have Ashley's unedited butt anywhere cause it's saggy and disgusting.
---
I was a killer when a survivor found this loop and my heart dropped lmao
---
People actually care about rank??
---
My time playing as survivor after like 1300+ hrs as killer did make me a little sympathetic to survivors.
---
I don't tunnel normally and try to rotate all hooks and just maintain map pressure.
---
I also gained a deep seated hatred for hillbilly, fuck billy. 
---
Saw hitbox is an island and the character requires like no skill.
---
Pips **S U C K** now. 
---
Ugh.  Escape, unscathed, with new found new items, after fixing a pile of gens. De-pip.
---
She's as fun to face as the doctor except she's better at tunneling the hook rescues. 
---
Well, uh.
---
You tried?
---
R
---
*dgdgdgdgdgdgdgdgdgdgdgdg* _intensifies_
---
Sorry but I find the plague more cancerous than Legion. Her puke is literally a built in biological flamethrower.
---
I thought it would be okay. I mean, actual good players being in rank 1? But turns out even the best of the best are having trouble pipping. Hope they hotfix this. 
---
Ultimately too this wouldn't be such a problem if there was an actual complete overhaul, but just the way they evaluate what constitutes a "good" game is wrong. Right now the game punishes you if no one is ever found, if you are never found, and if all 4 survivors rush gens. It was bearable because it was easier to pip up, but still a problem. Now they left the real problem in place but made everything else harder.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:( sharp hand joe
---
E x t r a  t h i c c 
---
Don't worry this will be fixed when we get servers, because then they can see who DCs.
---
It looks the same as it was with %'s being different 
---
Haven't been around since then, but this bug was not in the game last patch, I am also talking about the hooked survivor seing the killer in 3rd personm this are 2 bugs that give 1 side an advantage
---
I've had games like that. 3k person gets tunneled twice with bt so I get the safe unhook, I do 2 or 3 gens and maybe loop the killer a bit. Save other people as well and either escape through hatch or by the door
---
I felt so bad until you said that. I did something similar to another Freddy as well.
---
I'm not having a good time either. 
---
So, my problem with the rank system is the same as it's always been.
---
What's the purpose of having rank in matchmaking? Ideally, to put players who are roughly the same skill level together so everyone is having fun, fair-ish games.
---
Did DBD's system do this before? Absolutely not.
---
The emblem system doesn't really measure how much one side kicked the other side's ass, it measures a bunch of videogamey stuff that would be called "grind" in any other context. If you have a close 15 minute game, it doesn't matter which side actually wins - everyone's going to rank up because the game went on long enough for everyone to farm their emblems.
---
Imagine the worst two chess players in the world playing chess against one another and *only* one another for fifty years until they're somehow the #1 and #2 ranked players in the world - what? That doesn't make any sense. They didn't get actually get good at chess, they just played a bunch of games against an equally bad player, and every game gave both of them points, so now the system thinks they're the best. This is pretty much how DBD works.
---
Does the new system fix anything? No, the problem is what the emblem's measure, not how hard it is to pip. The DBD system just doesn't do what rank systems are supposed to do - match players of equal skills together. And it can't ever do that because the emblem system measures like 50% how much you outplayed your opponents in the game and 50% how much farming you got to do in the game.
---
They just need a proper Elo or Elo-like system. It needs to be **zero-sum.** My loss is your gain, your gain is my loss.
---
Oh nvm
---
I'm pretty sure that playing killer helps you more to be good at survivor than vice versa. Obviously it is handy in both ways
---
Used franks tape + ruler (better than dirt in this case to get each frenzy hit in faster) 
---
Also brought streamers and dident tunnle the same guy of hook over and over till death targeting a new guy each time, did become more tryhard at last gen for the 4K (difrence between playing nice and literaly gifting a free win), ended up giving hatch to the last guy since he got sandbagged by another survivor.
---
if you play on PC, is it possible to block anyone who isn't Friends with you? i'm on PS4, but i have it set that someone has to be my Friend to message me. i couldn't imagine not doing that. there would likely be way more negative messages than not, if you play competitive online games. i think pretty much everyone should set messages to Friends only. then you can just add ppl as friends when you want
---
 June 14, 2016 by my calculations 
---
Nah. If you play legion, fuck you. BPS or not 
---
How on earth did you manage to hit her 
---
Do DC's count
---
What you talking about this is GameCube content you uncultured swine
---
I’m pretty sure they do. If they don’t that would be stupid 
---
I was under the impression that nothing stacked with it above 100% pre patch. 
---
You sure showed that toxic survivor by being a toxic killer. Good job. That's the solution to toxicity in gaming. 
---
It's more about apex tho
---
yeah, that's what i said up there. the guy must have been camped and tunneled cause there's no chance someone was immersing in distant corners when other was able to get 20k and die. the 3k bp unfortunate people who got camped and tunneled is in no way dumb teammates. just trash killer. that i've seen happen quite a lot and been one myself as well.
---
and when coming the patch?
---
Double windows too. 
---
(they don't)
---
*legion noises*
---
Their character designs are pretty cool, especially Joey and Julie. Probably the best iteration of the whole "survivor look alike" theme that was floating around.
---
Another leaked upcoming perk?
---
“Leaks are unverified”
---
There are several posts by *several people* about the perks.
---
Does reporting even do anything? I don’t check my messages very carefully. If it seems like a salty asshole from the first few words, I delete. Even though they won’t know I didn’t read it, it makes me feel better to just ignore it. If there’s a rant that starts “Why didn’t you save me you fucking...” I don’t bother. Chances are I was on a gen and didn’t think I could safely get them unhooked since the killer was near them.
---
I would immediately delete everything, but I’ve had nice chats with some and added them as friends. Ironic that they were all killers and I was playing survivor. It’s usually them apologizing for something that I didn’t have an issue with so I let them know it’s fine. Example: one felt bad for killing me when the others all DCed and I’d done enough generators on my own, plus wiggled free twice, but missed the hatch by seconds while slugging. It’s my fault for getting hit, so I didn’t think he should apologize, and he appreciated that I wasn’t salty over it.  A few others just thought my character was cute and apologized for watching her die.  Kind of odd thinking “Cute girl! I want to see her die rather than hunt other survivors.” but they wanted to be friends afterwards.
---
I imagine it’s worse when two team up on you like that OP. So childish! At least you can block them. You made a mistake, but so does everyone sometimes - they should get over it.  You had good intentions.
---
So innocent 
---
please fuck off
---
Definitely a bug right now. Had to stop playing the game. Can't stay in a single match at this point. Continuously getting DCed.
---
Agreed (:
---
Spotted the pig main ;)
---
AFTER 12 MIN QUE IM GETTING DEPIPPED WITH 3KILLS BECAUSE  AFTER A 20+ MIN HATCH STANDOFF I'M GET BORED AND LET THE LAST SURVI ESCAPE
---
FUCK THIS GAME, ITS JUST GETTING WORSE FROM PATCH TO PATCH.. FIX REAL PROBLEMS MAYBE? 
---
When was your last game?
---
Getting to rank 1 is nearly impossible.
---
You need 3 golds &amp; 1 iridescent to get a SINGLE PIP ranks 1-4
---
Oh, and if a surv DCs? Enjoy the safety pip/depip.
---
If a killer DCs? Enjoy the depip.
---
Nobody in their right mind can defend it in its current state with the fact that DCs are near guranteed depips.
---
DS absolutely does change the course of a match especially if there's 4 DS in the match let alone 2, so much time and momentum is wasted even though you played well and did your objective to down them.
---
It's straight up broken, just got killed by a camping Trapper when my friend with BT unhooked me and didn't get a proc. The Endurance effect doesn't even appear. It happened yesterday against a Plague too. It seems 50/50 at this point. 
---
Well, they do
---
Are you saying the half rotted walking corpse is beautiful? 
---
I just got back into the game after a good break could someone explain why legion is so hated? 
---
The meme may be about the emblem system but if you play Spirit, you’ll get to experience the bottom left one in this patch too.
---
It was like 5 minutes of him chasing me w/ no TR
---
The only people pipping are legion mains and nurse mains :(
---
these are all the same complaint, its as if piping doesnt matter anymore(or never did?)
---
My girl Feng Min is sad. :(
---
Wait are you serious? I can’t tell because hitboxes have always been good
---
I play Legion and in post game instead of GG with any other killer I say "Didn't you have fun" hahahha
---
I’m pretty sure if you get less than 2 dc’s then it’s okay 
---
Really? I did the adept achievement the other day w/ the plague and had a single DC, didn't count.
---
For the record, never used the perk so this isn't a former DS user talking but it was a one-time use perk...it didn't need nerfed. Rank 1 survivor and never saw more than one person run it on average and that was if anyone used it period. As killer, I only played like 3 games total where everyone used it and they were all 4 man SWF teams. Now the latter situations sucked, I will admit that, but that's SWF for you, they are and will always be problems whether all 4 use(d) DS or not. 
---
They should both get a pip. This isn't some "Only one person can pip" scenario. It's a team game.
---
What patch was that? My worst in recent memory is 1.9.2 where all flashlights instablinded and if you blinded the killer anytime during the pickup animation, they’d drop the instant they could move.
---
Here are 2 strong builds:
---
1. Generic straight forward build
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Enduring
---
Spirit fury, stbfl, sloppy butcher or brutal strength
---
2. Endgame freddy build
---
Remember me
---
Blood warden
---
Noed 
---
It’s bugged 
---
Wait... what?
---
Myers has a scary knife - the kind of thing that's terrifying because some evil bastard could be breaking into your house tonight, grabbing one of those, and coming to get you. Next time you're chopping onions, think of Michael's mori.
---
The Doctor has a stick.
---
Which sort of DC? Start of match or in game? I did Rank 2 adept trapper (yeah don’t ask) and had my third hook DC, then killed the rest and got it.
---
To clarify, I don’t know if the flashlight is what caused it but something seems bugged regardless. 3 minutes pass between that person getting unhooked and hitting d-strike. Certainly way more than the 50 seconds it’s listed as. 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Discordance, Nurse's
---
My favorite stealth build:
---
Iron will
---
Distortion
---
Quick and quiet
---
Lightweight 
---
Scream Queens References gets you MAJOR points! :)
---
usually the killer loses collision when they basic attack, that should be patched to keep it in line with every other killer. Shes got a hell of a basement game though.
---
I was curious if you’re always a cunt so I went back to look at your comment history to find out you usually are. But that you also said you were straight a month ago. Idk what I gained from that knowledge, but there you go 
---
I don’t see any reason to not do gens unless you feel it’s too dangerous in that area, but you can find another gen outside the terror radius. 
---
However, they may not save you because they worry they’d fuck it up. It’s awful to try and save someone, then the killer hooks them again right away putting them in stage 2 or 3.  I unhook only if I know the approximate location of the killer or if no one else is going to save them and it’s their only hope. I have a lot of perks to help locate the killer. If you have Kindred, there’s no excuse for them to ignore you unless you’re being camped, since survivors can see everyone and know if someone’s on there way already plus see the killer. I have it, and I usually get saved by randoms. Maybe you’re just having a streak of bad luck with whoever you get paired with if you are using Kindred.
---
I basically only heal against spirit and freddy, nurse I can work around since I usually have dead hard
---
i'm saying the BODY, THE STRUCTURE of the body of Plague is beautiful. disease has nothing to do with the beauty.
---
Blood warden, remember me, stbfl, enduring, play for the end game and watch them.
---
Did you just DC a quarter of a second into a chase?
---
I downvoted myself watcha gonna do
---
I use Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet, Bond, and Iron Will. 
---
That’s fair I suppose. I got rank 1 last season when I definitely don’t think I should have been there - at the time I thought it was too easy and now it feels too hard. But now you’ve kinda put it in perspective I understand...just feels a little disappointing when you feel like you’ve played a really good game.
---
You’re right about reset though, now that it’s harder to pip it seems unnecessary to have reset so often.
---
Midgame. It was the last guy, too :v
---
E
---
If you're getting 15-17k with her, you're doing better than me.
---
My poor Hag is currently paying for the Plague's bloodweb. Adiris may be pretty hot, fun to be around, and a welcome addition... but she's a scrub who doesn't pull her weight.
---
Because there are no perks worth taking on survivor to replace DS.
---
Its already way harder to get stacks than bbq
---
You are "bad guy". But this does not mean you are \*bad guy\*.
---
I did once watched a survivor's vod once the game was over just so I could hear what he was saying.   
---
It was quite fun to watch especially because the entire game was a clown fiesta. 
---
The vod ends with me - the hag- , a claudette and a dwight all running around in circles the hooked streamer, me missing a lot of hits, me setting traps, traps going off all around the hooked guy, and none of the two survivors profiting off my distraction to save him. This lasted for the entire time he was hooked until he died, not sure how long that is.   
---
He bm'ed the team in the post-match chat, ngl he was right though. I watched that vod a few times only because it made me lol'd every time.  
---
As I Survivor main I hate Survivors. I started playing Killer so I can act on that hate.
---
If the perk remains as is then its just about useless. A good 75% of killers are using enduring. You also have to be tunneled within 60 seconds of being unhooked, then get picked up for it to work. This is already situational, not even factoring in Enduring, or moris, both of which completely negate the perk. Its hardly worth running at this point. If they never make enduring not effect it than its about as bad as slippery meat and no one left behind.
---
I also feel like in high ranks only 1 survivor can really pip per game. Leaving a 1:1 survivor/killer ratio in rank 1, which would not be good. But we'll see
---
this happend to me earlier against a pig as tapp
---
Just finished my first game with the plague as well. 
---
Adrenaline: 
---
* works as a better BT if on hook
---
* auto wins a chase if you in one endgame
---
* Denys endgame slugs
---
* let’s a whole team rush the last gen injured due to the heal, thus geting the last gen faster to proc adrenaline
---
* anyone injured is now not, negating the killers endgame unless they have NOED as huge parts of the maps become save zones when gates open
---
* fucks Freddy for no real reason 
---
Only requirement is to get all 5 gens done (which if survivors try hard even slightly can be done in 3-4 mins)
---
DS (if it was meta lvs of good)
---
* is basically a free health state after an unhook
---
* punishes the killer even if they are not camping/tunnelling and they just happen to find you again
---
* forces the killer to waste 30-20 seconds slugging you, time most don’t have
---
* auto win at gates
---
* DS save into DS save so both party’s have a chance to get of hook and loop the killer wasting time
---
* fucks Freddy for no reason (people dive freddys because some survivors think 7 seconds = god mode for some reason, chasing the unhooked to punish such a dumb move is now punished, so now you can literaly dive Freddy for free)
---
* doesn’t actually stop tunneling, they waste time but if a killer hates you they kill kill you, only hurts killers trying to win or capitise of a mistake
---
that’s the ugly truth. Ranking up doesn’t matter since there are no rewards or any incentive that inspires you to rank up.
---
NEW PLAYERS PLAYING AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAS MORE THAN 1000HRS PLAYED
---
DEPIPPING FOR NO REASON
---
NOT GETTING BP WHEN THE KILLER RAGEQUITS (PC)
---
ALWAYS BUFFING KILLERS AND NERFING SURVIVORS
---
YOU ADDED PHYSICS TO JANE'S BOOBS BUT HER PONYTAIL LOOKS LIKE A STICK WITH 0 MOVEMENT (??????)
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BHVR? INSTEAD OF BALANCING THE GAME YOU ARE PUTTING MORE WEIGHT ON KILLERS (AND JANE'S ASS), DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT IT? I MEAN THE BALANCING, NOT THE ASS
---
what? has nothing to do with the beauty i was talking about where i said she has long healthy legs, breasts and blah blah all that. it is obviously not including the plague, holy crap. remove the plague marks and just use her Persian skin and she's amazing cause she already got the structure there, you can't deny that.
---
to not seeing the butt naked up close does not remove the fact there is CELLULITE(thank you for pointing it out. English isn't even my second language but obviously i mean cellulite. it just sounds the same in my mother tongue so when phone gave me cellulitis i just rolled with it) because of how her butt is structured. it is saggy even through pants, there's clearly cellulite.
---
and i did not say "not skinny" is bad and not beautiful. i even commented there with a picture of some other model that defo has curves they're just well shaped and healthy with no cellulite while the model other person told me about has clearly saggy hips and no pictures of uncovered and unedited butt because of cellulite. 
---
and i was mostly arguing about the fact that they say Adiris isn't thicc when there is specific difference between thicc and Jane or that model Ashley. 
---
Great, killer' perspective, where you get to decide what to do, but as a survivor if you get chased all game and depip cuz of it it's not your damn fault.
---
And you're assuming survivors are at all playing seriously, as opposed to memeing or looting or sandbagging or whatever else you want to think of.
---
Your data means nothing, and your over-estimation of its value is just pure ignorance.
---
Data also suggests Nurse is balanced. So you go ahead and keep those inapplicable numbers. You seem to be too out of the loop to have a perspective outside of them.
---
I honestly hated to be Rank 1, most survivors were toxic and annoying to play against.
---
Why should I not applaud this change, Im having good games for once.
---
On the PTB it was almost impossible to pip up, and easy as hell to depip. I haven't played on live yet but they seem to have made it way too hard to rank up now
---
Body blocking? What?
---
Getting to Rank 1 is way too easy?
---
Still, only 4.3% of all players have achieved the ***Legendary Survivor*** *(Rank 1)* achievement. Just because you can do it, doesn't mean everybody can.
---
Bad wording on my part, i mean they didn't achieve their goal of making ranking up harder and require more skill, they made it harder by making it obtuse and making people jump through hoops.
---
So you spent 1 perk slot to save 1 hit during the entire match? Big deal.
---
I just did that and felt great
---
Easily toxic and broken, due to the fact she can put them into the injured state by body blocking and continually puking on them then pretty much insta downing them with one hit
---
I'm not surprised. Good thing I don't care about ranking up at all anymore since there's no point after you get the achievement, but hopefully they change it because it sounds painful.
---
I havent played since the system got changed can someone tell me how affected rank 1 qtimes are? Does it take longer now? And have they fixed infinite lobbies?
---
Yeah they did
---
You have to hook at least 9 times (I got 8 in that round) to get the best shard in the hooking category, resulting in the stupid fact that it's better to let people escape from hooks often, than to kill everybody in a few minutes 
---
I've had a single DC in a game where it would have been a 4K and it didn't count. 
---
Merciless victory = double pip. Therefore if mid-higher ranks have to work much harder to get the achievement than lower ranks then the goalposts for said achievements are in fact getting moved further away... so why the downvotes?? I genuinely can't see what's wrong with my initial comment 
---
Mostly just that he’s annoying and that his power has very little counterplay, making him annoying albeit not being a strong killer with a very low skill ceiling that can be a real pain in the ass. After being hit you also have to spent what feels like 1-2 whole minutes just standing and pressing M1
---
How do you export stuff off of PS4?
---
Someone is salty survivor? DS never bothered me. 95% of users died and were crying in the end chat.. does this mean more crying or less?
---
Because achievements were bugged. There was a hotfix.
---
He's even poking his head through a window!
---
"controversial" 
---
Honestly, I'm tired of playing survivor right now. Just waiting till I move out and be able to use microphone in peace and quiet so I can do some SWF. Playing solo right now - at least for me, feels like 1 v 1 against the killer with 3 random NPC hiding characters in the map corners. 
---
Sometimes I get a competent people but that's because they're trio SWF yet they're not always playing for objective but more for saves and chases. 
---
Lobbies are currently messed up with Killers having a go against a bunch of newbies and myself, little to say these killers run perks these survivors are either clueless about or unskilled to counter them (no, not NOED, you can't counter it consistently as a solo with these survivors in your team). 
---
I tried playing as a killer as well but I got lucky to go against SWF generator alpha teams and I did end up getting the 2-3 kills but it was intense AF and I didn't score as much points as I would facing against survivors I had in my games as a survivor. Not that I am complaining I just think anything less than 25k points per game as a killer is a loss (my opinion) because it shows you didn't utilize all the categories well enough. My main struggle is either getting the chaser points or deviation (depending on the killer I am playing). 
---
NOED 2 op plz nerff!!!11!1!! /s
---
You don't have to, you just have to encourage the survivors you're murdering to hook swap and farm each other. Imo that's even worse than just letting them off the hook
---
Love this post OP,  interested in messing around with builds cause I just always run the same thing.
---
Same here.
---
Mmmm this made me happy
---
Maybe it’s because I play on console, or maybe it’s because I haven’t came up against a toxic legion yet (Touch wood), but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed some games I’ve played against them. THIS is gonna be unpopular but I tend to find Myers is the most toxic tbh. With add ons he pretty much has a built in devour hope, his movement speed is pretty fast at tier 3, even without add ins he has an exposed locked and loaded at the click of a button and more often than not it’s a Myers who will run NOED etc. Just to make sure of that instadown and face camp. There I said it... I HATE Myers :0
---
Adrenaline is a perk to counter campers. Noed is a perk for noob killers. 
---
I don't play legion often (only for dailies usually), but I have no problem playing against them as as survivor. I hate Doc much, much more.
---
Again it's not caused by the rank changes but rather the emblem system. The issue does lie more in emblems than the ranking system as a whole, but it was excusable back when the loopholes within the emblem system weren't mandatory knowledge to rank up.
---
I love the new Killers... The Glocktor and *reads smudged handwriting* the Hillbergy
---
Has anyone noticed the clipping of cosmetic skins for survivors has only gotten worse with each patch? What the hell is going on BHVR? 
---
See, that sounds awesome. I dont know why I'm the only one in my friends group that goes for end game saves. Its literally half the fun of dbd. Rest of my friends want to leave and one will even get upset if they are the last hooked and I try to save them (often he just let's go when he sees me going for him) and yet I wonder why they don't like the game as much as me... 
---
Nope
---
Billy with stbfl, noed, and dh stacks at you for the bottom one
---
Might not be u coz it was Hex ruin and monstrous shrine
---
Both game nobody do gens nor find totem whilst im busy basement saves with burrowed time. But then that puke in the face till broke shit happens lol.
---
After 2nd game with same plague, i complain and killer said entity made me do this only giving these perks lol
---
Is that why that Dwight hooked me? Man, Emblem changes really fucked up both sides.
---
~~Also explaining the Huntress throwing hatchets at a Gen til it was done~~
---
Maybe SWF or something.
---
lol what? Someone didn't read the patch notes. 
---
You can't dribble DS anymore so you just gave him 99% wiggle bar and when you picked him up again, he wiggled. 
---
The killer "staying on" the survivor isn't a counter. Like it doesn't matter that survivors can soak an extra hit because the killer can "just hit them again"?
---
You can just 99% the heal and finish it if the killer comes. The only way the aura is actually going to come into play is if you escape the killer twice in a row after soaking that hit.
---
This only thing that annoys me about a killer leaving is losing my items... even if they don’t give BP, I just want them to let us keep them
---
Or maybe legion after legion has led alot of us to the conclusion that we should not be asked to play agianst something so toxic and unfun for the game.
---
Yeah chaser sucks because if you do extremely well as killer and finish a game out super quickly with a 4K you'll get a bronze emblem for it as you technically didn't chase people around that much
---
Where does plague rank?
---
I had a guy DC after I hooked him once and it didn't give me adept on plague (earlier today). Was pretty tilted
---
Upvote here, adults knows that skinny girls not that hot
---
Came here to say this, haha
---
My time as a survivor so far has been pretty good, but the times other survivors have betrayed me has killed the part of me that used to let survivors escape when they struggled through the trial.
---
Idunno why but the more I look at this photo the more she turns into mike wazowski. 
---
I had it work. She had to be really close almost opening the locker and I realized I was trying at first to jump in and jump out. I’m dumb and didn’t realize I had to be inside at least 3 seconds. 
---
I can’t speak for survivor side but from killer side in 13 hours of playing today I piped or double piped 75% or so of my matches, Safety in all others but one. It’s by no means impossible. 
---
Or, idk, maybe break LoS and hide?
---
I'm not trying to be snarky here, but I made the experience that over-reliance on pallets/loops leads to legion shutting the game down quickly, while hiding/using blind spots is much more effective.
---
I think the main reason for hate against him is more that humans are creatures of habit, and Legion shakes the usual playstyle up and that doesn't sit well.
---
TBH I'm just as tired as "legian is bed" shitposts as I am of "leave legion alone" shitposts. 
---
Maybe I'm into the nerdy boys though. :/
---
its been suckin for like a year
---
Strong women don't bash other women on how they look, they build each other up instead. It ain't no competition and you're not winning any points with that atrocious personality of yours.
---
See ya nerd!
---
They did indeed say you'd load into lobbies with 4 people. Certainly not always the case.
---
A real smart fella, he felt smart.
---
No killer worth their salt has people hide behind LoS blockers
---
Only instance where this has potential is 3 jungle gyms next to each other surrounded by rubbish tiles. But lately, tile spawning has just been "huge ass empty area with no pallets in sight, except for one unsafe pallet riiiiight here"
---
Good killers/ survivors actually like the looping/ chasing aspect, hence why most people DC from Legion.
---
It has never been the case for me.
---
They implied it to be the norm.
---
I've been on this subreddit for a couple weeks now, after playing the game for the last three months (like almost every damn day for hours), the one thing that stood out the most is how so many killers think they're victims. I mean, jesus, for every survivor complaining about killers being dickheads there's about 10 killers complaining about survivors.
---
Try playing her sometime finding a gen that has some progression and chilling like this. The amount of times survivors run up and just start working beside you is great. 
---
And if you want a good jump scare go for the grab or just keep having a laugh.
---
Personally I like pretending I'm immersed survivor to afraid not to crouch and follow them from gen to gen "helping"
---
Can it be a shitpost if it's a repost?
---
It seems to be only for the survivor that you hit, but seeing her like on them till they get into the broken state, there not running away.
---
No counterplay, after a certain point you have to run at him to keep chase going so you don't instantly go down. Legion will break chase so your meter goes down, so you're only 1 or 2 taps (one frenzy mode) till down
---
He's not nurse broken, but he has the lowest barrier to entry that makes the game unfun as hell from a survivor's perspective.
---
If they all were dumb enough to get caught down there and have it done to them then not toxic at all.
---
Yes please. Also make it so that you get a token if you heal a health state on another survivor.
---
Had this happen to me earlier. Lasted all game. Any reason it happens? 
---
Ah, I see. I was thinking it was something to do with Haddonfield.
---
They changed it for the live version
---
I encountered this bug too but through spectate. Had a match was second last to die and hit spectate because I wanted to see if the last person got hatch. When I did spectate had the name of the last survivor of the bottom of the screen but the camera was following the pig around as she broke some pallets and I could see the survivor being taken by the entity in the distance when the killer turned. 
---
Or u could just. Run. 
---
I'd like a mantis.
---
Not even close. Survivors might not even make it to end game. Could be compared to pre nerf DS. was only annoying when it was unexpected and/or a good survivor had it. Noed can carry bad killers. Noed actually becomes stronger if you start destroying totems until you did all 5. (Good luck with that in solo). A few killers are already strong enough that they don't need the "slow the game down" aspect. "But it's a late game perk, high risk high reward" so is wake up, hope, adrenaline and blood warden, but those perks actually have a risk aspect, not so much for noed. Wake up is weak in general, adrenaline is a necessity more than before because many took off self care. (Not saying it's not strong.) Hope is cool, and for blood warden you actually have to work. Noed is just... There.
---
huh, not at all. It would only be reportable if the killer was standing there not moving and taking the game hostage, which is clearly not what's happening.
---
Yeah I was just going through reddit if I wasn't to only one who didn't like this :c
---
*thunder clap*
---
Someone's grumpy.
---
Ugh I really need to learn how to play this game proper lol. 
---
I only find it impossible to get rank 1 as survivor. Killer was definitely more difficult but I managed to get it a lot quicker than I did with survivor.
---
(I didn't play this rank reset I played when the dlc dropped)
---
Right? Devs expect too much from us man
---
Ds can't be dribbled anymore. They activate during the pick up animation.
---
However, ds was nerfed in the latest update. They can only activate ds for a short period after being unhooked.
---
The reason you were stunned is because you dropped the survivor too many times.
---
Yeah.... people hate legion because of the perception of people dcing...
---
Get fucking real. Your logic is backwards and desperate..
---
A picture says a thousand words. Legion is so unfun to play against people would rather sacrifice points and quit than waste time. That is very bad for the game and unheard of so far in dbd. I dont tend to dc, but I can understand why.
---
Well this was well done. Rare in this sub..
---
gen rush doesnt exist period
---
Had a billy who had no heartbeat or chainsaw sound until he made impact with my back... no idea he was coming 30 seconds into the match.
---
Was like the volume was turned down to 0 and when he hit it was like someone held volume up on the remote and it went up really fast.
---
"Love Porkchop"
---
Not really.
---
lol you dont need to dribble obsessions anymore 
---
YES, WE NOW HAVE RANK 1/2 KILLERS MATCHED WITH RANK 8-20 SURVIVORS. TUNNELING , CAMPING JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PIP SO BADLY. I HAVEA RANK 1 SURVIVOR FRIEND WHO'S ALREADY BACK ON RANK 1 THREE DAYS AFTER RANK RESET. SINCE THE PATCH HE IS BACK DOWN ON 6. HELL HOW I HATE THE GAME RIGHT NOW. 
---
I'm having absolutely no problem pipping as killer currently.  I'm glad they're punishing campers out of red ranks.  They didn't belong up there and the last emblem system changes made it insanely to pip as a camper.
---
They’ve had a rule change since then, a few months back. You no longer have to include something from DBD on the picture as long as you have context. That’s why you hardly ever see those tiny Billy faces anymore.
---
Apparently my buddy saw this after he died in our swf too ( I was already dead) I couldn’t switch to killer cam so it’s a weird bug 
---
U got bamboozled
---
Of course it doesn't last ten seconds.
---
Cleansing it takes 14 seconds, so it lasts 14 seconds.
---
I cant find surviver 
---
I learned these tactics before I played survivor, it's because I mindgamed survivor a lot that as a survivor, I often saw these mindgames comming.
---
For me it only made solo queueing bearable. You were able to "carry" bad teammates and even allow them an escape through the use of it (get downed and picked up next to hooked survivor, DS and unhook)
---
DS was by no means a "meta" or even "okay" perk against any killer worth their salt. (even unbreakable is like 2 tiers higher if we're talking everyone playing optimally)
---
Self-care is like my favourite perk to go against as killer. Waste of a perk slot, people wasting their time
---
You can mindgame lockers easily and get a free grab. I've already had killers who go for the fake grab then back out when I jump out, giving them a free hit. The perk does still take some skill. It just never really activates in the first place, which is my issue. You can't use it.
---
Quit n quiet urban evasion self care because thats the meta and you can choose either an exaustion perk or if you are sam fisher himself use iron will or calm spirit to avoid doctors and the new perk from the plague
---
This is the meme i'm talking about and it always gets me: https://i.redd.it/nlfqpia6wwm21.png
---
Clip of the scene for context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJtxMnvY3_4

---
So, you're saying it's healthy for the Killer to block the stairway and abuse the narrow basement hall inside Thompson's House?
---
Yes do it
---
Okay then
---
Man oh man, didn’t think I’d run into you on Reddit. How’s it hangin man.
---
dribbling isn't a thing anymore
---
There absolutely are survivors so pathetically immersed that they literally will finish a game with just a few thousand points while lasting far into the match.  I played one earlier where the game was dragging and I died far into it just to see the fucking Claudette I kept seeing walking around edge of map with bond had 2400 points....I hate randoms.
---
Downvoted not for the content but for the terribly cringe attempt at a shitpost. 
---
I would expect nothing else from a Legion defender like them honestly, have people suffer in their Legion games so people that bought him don't feel bad.
---
YES BECAUSE THEY MADE RANKING UP PRETTY MUCH FUCKING [IMPOSSIBLE](/intensifies) AND YOU NOW HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN YOUR WHOLE TEAM, MEANING YOU HAVE TO COMPETE FOR HOOK RESCUES AND TOTEMS AND SHIT, THAT SHIT IS JUST STUPID. KILLERS NEED A WHOLE LOTTA SHIT DONE TOO TO GET A PIP.
---
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY TO RANK UP ANYMORE SIMPLY FROM LOOPING, WHICH MEANS THE ONE SURVIVOR WHO IS WASTING THE KILLER'S TIME IN ORDER TO BUY THEIR TEAM MORE TIME TO DO GENS ISN'T GONNA GET A RANK UP ANYMORE. 
---
WE DID ASK FOR A CHANGE TO THE RANKING SYSTEM BUT WE DIDN'T ASK TO FUCK IT UP COMPLETELY.
---
YES, THE "OLD" RANKING SYSTEM WASN'T THE BEST BUT IT'S AT LEAST 100 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS HORSE SHIT. 
---
[I'D RATHER NOT HAVE A CHANGE AT ALL THAN HAVE ANY OF THIS SHIT.](/intensifies)
---
People find the Spirit great, but she relies on sound to really get the most out of her power so i would not suggest her if you don't have good headphones. Myers is and forever will be a solid purchase for stealthy grabs and pretty spicy addons. Hag has gotten some real love and has shown her true strength, being even half descent with her trap placement will wield satisfying results.
---
Can confirm, it will activate whenever a gen is popped, which is really great, you can use it in some case during a chase to loose the killer (ell that's highly situational, but that's a plus)
---
Ignoring a target just because it feels bad to lose? The injured survivor is the easy one to find, moaning and all.
---
Whilst annoying, I think it makes sense in some places
---
Had a game last night where we went up against a pretty bad killer, only hooked one person the entirety of the match. We do the gens and get out. I ended up with irri Lightbringer and Unbroken, but the others were bronze. It was annoying sure but I feel like it was the game's way of saying "this one doesn't count, you went against a bad killer"
---
Freddy doesn’t need NOED tho. I used it at the start when learning him, but I dropped it for a more consistent perk (rancor) when I levelled my spirit a few months ago 
---
So your ‘solution’ is to be toxic? Just play the game and improve, sure it may take awhile but if you really want to get better just play the game.
---
This has not been stated again since people realised how stupid it is and how uninformed you are about the survivor's side. Good on you for bringing this shitty excuse that rivals "just don't get caught" in stupidity.
---
swap pig and clown.
---
maaaybe bump hag up too.
---
I feel like Doctor and Legion should be switched around since The Doctor can find people very easily whilst Deep Wound can be easily countered.
---
THAT PERK IT BROKEN AT THE MOMENT.
---
Cynical but most likely to be the case lmao
---
Everytime you cleanse you are just feeding killer her corrupt purge....just repair sick man op is exactly right.  Feeding her corrupt purge is the only thing that makes her strong.
---
By good I mean high skill. When you're high skill you wanna scratch that itch and when you play a killer who doesn't make the game interesting and makes you M1 all game, you'll take a 20k bp penalty over playing that.
---
I think the new update is extremely buggy for majority of us.
---
how adrenaline counter campers : 
---
\- you get hooked before the last gen pops
---
\- killer is a noob so he camp u to get at least 1 kill
---
\- last gen pops 
---
\- teammates save u and u dont get downed immediately from the killer. 
---
for example : 2 days ago i was playing a match and a myers hooked me after he tunneled me for the whole game. he starts camping but my teammates did the last gen, opened the door and saved me and i escaped.
---
Liking the karma so far?
---
I just wanna scare people lmao Like when people do gens and i just crouch behind them with my pig and when they dunno what to do...they just freak out and i find it really funny. I have atleast kinda good headphones so maybe the spirit could be fun?
---
Don't say this to anyone, but i mostly agree with this.
---
Getting less than 3 kills is a loss for the killer. So 50 is close to balanced since 75% killrate is required to win 
---
It's not saving one hit. Its negating an entire chase which could last more than a minute. Which you may lose, not because you outplayed the survivor, but because you brought a perk.
---
Glad someone agrees xd
---
I don't get why everyone's hating legion that much
---
hahahahah yessssss.
---
I got facecamped on first hook by a plauge that also tunnels
---
He is 1000% right.  I just stay sick until endgame and plow through gens.  My teamates have no idea what they're doing against Plague.  I am seeing potatoes cleansing who aren't even broken!  Just noobs constantly leaving her corrupt purges to pick up, the only thing that makes her strong.  I've gotten iridescent lightbringer 6 Plague games straight because my idiot teamates somehow spend all game not doing gens while also cleansing themselves constantly feeding her ability.  I had a game where I popped all 5 gens....I'm averaging 4.....this is a problem.  Learn how to play PLAGUE people!
---
If you have trouble finding survivors, try using Doctor or using Whispers / Discordance(Legion) / Surveillance(Pig) / Bitter Murmur / Barbecue and Chilli(Cannibal)
---
“NOICE!!” - Loopers
---
Including males whatsoever is trash, fuck all men 
---
Why do people complain about cypress moris? They have literally no impact on the match.
---
trick question they were never useful
---
80% of my lobbys are in the green, 15% yellow. Have you ever considered maybe it’s your internet?
---
SPIRITS AUDIO IS BROKEN AND MAP WIDE "WHOOSH".  USE THE MUTE NOISE ADD ON NECKLACE THINGY OR JUST TOUGH IT THE FUCK OUT. I WENT BACK TO MAINING MY DC MACHINE DOCTOR
---
Man I've had that happen with both the Plague and the Nurse so far.
---
I don't even understand the Plague disconnects. She seems like a weaker pig. Am I missing something?
---
Thats just because most people are trying the plague. Whenever a good killer is released it takes a good week for queues to go back to normal.
---
They should add a XP boost the higher rank you are
---
Pig does have an extended lunge which helps immensely at loops, once you get the hang of it. (Pig main)
---
Yeah, she is both solid and fun when you get to know her ability, but like Nurse you will get dumpstered a few times before she can shine.Also her purple beads addon makes her perfect for stealth grabs.
---
Feel like Hag can be countered by smart plays, she's very situation but has good map control, I left her in the same spot from my previous tierlist.
---
I think Pig doesn't have an ability to help with chases or map control, but just to slow the game down, clown has good chase control so I think they deserve the spots they're in.
---
If you move hag up one then yeah, this is my perfect tier list lmao.
---
It wouldn't work. I've had a total of 2 people challenge me to a 1v1 and it's gone terrible. They try loop me, I down them then they say "My dead hard is broken!" "You're lagging!" "But I dropped the pallet!"  It wouldn't work.
---
I totally agree the new ranking system for survivors is ridiculously 
---
USE DADDY DOCTOR AND HEX. DC MACHINE!!!
---
Yeah, I’m a relatively newer player and I would see people moan about DS being OP, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone explain how. It was like a one time 2nd chance and when it’s done, it’s done. I’ve seen flashlights work better than old DS. 
---
But like I said, I’m also new and I don’t know how higher ranked matches go 
---
I'm with you on this, it was too easy to get the rank before to the point when 50% you'll encounter a potato player in red ranks
---
Stop feeding the troll guys
---
Plag (lol no0b) corrupt purge vomit doesn't injury survivors 50% of the time, or make them sick like standard vile purge.
---
Lmao insinuating that I’m complaining? Guess you can’t tell a difference between expressing option and bitching about something 😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️😂😂
---
As a survivor, ranking up means more compitent teammates
---
downvote!! because don't you DARE say something nice about this liquid garbage trash dumpster killer.
---
It isn't about face camping or tunnelling - which are legit, allbeit horribly frustrating (and bad killer strategy). You can obviously do this with any killer.
---
Its about his fundamental build and how it removes all survivors abilities to do anything. If you want to survive you just have to hide and not have fun.
---
Walking into gens blocked by entity causes you to sometimes gain the struggle prompt for the whole game
---
 Not really a feature but the unbreakable perk description is broke
---
Cuz he's a super sweaty boy.
---
Being good at a video game is very important to him, hence he had to point out he's rank 1.
---
Until some Claudette Urbans over and throws them down instantly cause she hears the heartbeat. 
---
\&gt;pig
---
you have some good taste
---
It's okay. Just try not to do it again 
---
I think her abilities are a step again into a dangerous direction. However I think it is somewhat balanced in that you can waste a lot of time early game and smash genys out and also can heal via the pools. The upgraded attack is probably too powerful but I have been able to escape multiple games vs her.
---
I think it just changes the game dynamic a bit - like medkits become pretty pointless most of the game.
---
When I play survivor Id rather go against a Legion, than against a Nurse.
---
No idea but it hindered me like crazy. I would just stop moving randomly or stop repairing generators. I didn't last very long that match.
---
it isn't about toxic players - for which there are lots for all killers. It is that legion is broken. There isn't much that you can do that gives him complete control of the game.
---
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
This hurt &lt;/3
---
Having a leave game button is standard, it would be dumb not to have one. But yea there should be a punishment for using it
---
Corrupt purge isn’t supposed to cause sickness, but not injuring is a bug. 
---
A great nurse deserves whatever she gets, takes the most skill with the most reward, a great legion has no counterplay just like a great nurse but doesn’t even have to try
---
I LOVE playing Peppa because most people assume its a low tier killer, so they decide to be toxic. Unfortunately for them, she's my main, so get ready for RBT hell
---
Well, pips were thrown around for free prior to this match. The only real condition was to enter the game and the only thing preventing me from pipping were crashes, lol. 
---
It’s still pretty easy for killer. 
---
Well, the topic kind of referred to sexuality in a sense, as it was focusing on the sexual attraction straight males of this community may feel towards Jane Romero. I was simply stating my own input on the topic. 
---
I only mentioned it once, also.
---
u/FalconV700 is right, this was actually changed in the most recent update+hotfix so you actually need to get a "merciless victory" (Which is what the achievements have said for as long as I've been playing despite the fact it meant 4k)
---
Source: I got a 4k as The Plague, wasn't merciless, didn't get the achievement
---
I got a 3k as The Plague (Last crawled to the hatch), game considered it merciless and gave me the achievement.
---
I have the same problem but in the killer side of things I’m rank 6 and haven’t piped once since the update and I constantly get 3-4 kills a game.
---
My bad, there was someone else who said the same thing and I thought it was you again.
---
This just makes it even more broken then 
---
Damn that sucks... I hope you get lower rank soon. 
---
more interesting than sitting on the hook doing nothing lol
---
Ah got it, no hard feelings, have a good one &lt;3
---
I had a game against clown where I did 3 1/2 gens myself, got chased around for like 2 minutes, destroyed 2 totems. I got help with the fourth gen from a P3 Claudette, someone finished the last gen and then I got NOED'd and camped. then I see the swf group at the exit gate, one destroyed the NOED and they just fucking leave. it was my first hook too
---
A Legion of downvoted you might say...
---
You too mate
---
I’m just using it as an example. Not every red rank is a rank 1
---
It's not terrible for killer but no great. You get punished for DC's or survivors just not grabbing people off hooks, or for you having too much map pressure. And I wouldn't say only the most skilled killers get to rank 1, more so if you're skilled with the strong killers and strong builds you can get there. But sometimes you just want to have fun with a different killer or a gimmick build.
---
Ah yes, there’s nothing quite like gutting a survivor like a fish.
---
See, people will always complain about something. 😉
---
More like he was released at the same time a map was released
---
Mostly it's because they want to come across as a neutral party, even if it's some shit like "I'm a survivor main, and I think all pallets are unfun and should be removed from the game".
---
I would move Hag up, other than that no complaints...(insert obligatory "fuck Legion" comment).
---
Nothing did, I remember specifically testing Botany Knowledge with We'll Make It... The time was still 8 seconds.
---
By perfect for killers you mean killers that let survivors get saved so they can farm a hook and to get a pip. To get all iridescent emblems you need to get something like 10-12 hooks which doesn’t happen in a normal game.
---
Should of used ‘Pose’ by Naomi Smalls
---
Delivery Dwight is already on the hook!   
---
\*laughs in Bubba\*
---
Oh yeah definitely, thank god I wasn't in red ranks when I was going for it, the fact that you'd theoretically need to double pip at rank 1 with 4 iri emblems while using the three teachables is a joke.
---
Aye I get this shit so fucking much.  
---
Both gates open, arseholes know where the hatch is, yet they stay for OVER TEN MINUTES wasting time.  
---
It's worse because I'm usually streaming when it happens, so it's not only wasting time in game but there's no commentary or anything you can offer over such shit other than to complain about it.
---
You're pretty rare.
---
Based on my experience I will just stalk you until I'm close to EW3 and then ignore you.
---
Almost all survivors just wait so they can BM the killer.
---
THANK YOU. Exactly this. 
---
At the very least as Killer you can choose to just not walk to the gates. But survivors are stuck on the hook as whoever chooses to chainsaw you, stab you, bludgeon you or now vomit all over you. 
---
It’s much more taunting than bending your knees a lot. 
---
D
---
Fedora man is fun. Most people generally get a false sense of security when fighting him making it an easy 4K.
---
They turned down the graphics for better framerate.
---
I have a acceptable framerate on my PS4 Pro since the new patch, but the game looks like a PS3 game now (Hell there are PS3 games that look better than this.)
---
Survivor main here. I like to play as pig, but going against her is just funny. Her crouching looks funny, not scary. So when I see her crouching towards my gen for example, I click my flashlight or T-bag (in a friendly way). She’s just too cute and too little intimidating
---
I usually use the time for tidy up. Kick a gen or break any pallets. Extra BP.
---
It is actually saving one hit, if even less then a hit actually, and that is a fact. If NOED pops mid chase when you're already chasing an injured survivor it barely does anything. An entire perkslot that you were not using. "Instantly win" is an extreme overexagerration. What about Hope then? Is Hope overpowered because it practicly makes you uncatchable for 2 minutes after the last gen? I believe the people who complain about Noed are the people who get overcomfident after the last gen, or people who get salty at outlier cases. 
---
I got to rank 2 with pig. 
---
I know I'll get downvoted foe this, but i can try and give you some context as to why most killers are so defensive. As you said, you've been playing this game for 3 months, so basically this is the weakest the survivors have been. At their strongest, game was living hell for killers. And i mean, survivors were some of the most broken, overpowered, toxic "things" I've seen in any game ever. And I've played some toxic games in my time. I try to be as reasonable as possible, and to see any situation from all perspectives, but let me tell you, when nerfs to survs started rolling in, i couldn't stop gloating. So yeah, some peiple have victim complex, and some are just straight up aholes. But some have been fed so much toxicity that they just want to see survivors suffer, deserved or not. 
---
It doesn’t matter what red rank you are, you still need 4 iridescent for double pip. Plus you need merciless victory for adept killers now so it makes it even harder to get them 
---
Yeah, because I find it annoying that people are so PC that you can't even make a harmless joke. Obviously Jane isn't obese, that's an exaggeration, but she's quite obviously designed to be at least overweight when you compare her to literally every other female character. Same way Jeff was with his stomach and to a lesser extent Ace. So I'm just taking two things that are right there in the game that reminded me of something that have characteristics of the conditions, that are related to each other in the way I mentioned, came out in the same exact same patch and made a 2 second meme out of it. Then people are saying that I'm promoting unhealthy body images and I'm uneducated, when neither are true in the slightest. If anything people who refuse to acknowledge obesity as an issue are the people promoting unhealthy body image. So yeah, I'm a little grumpy.
---
Shitty camper
---
Oh Freddy had kids alright. 
---
Or, hear me out on this one. Or ~~maybe they don’t want to play killer~~ are playing casually? 
---
In all seriousness, I have a friend who plays survivor exclusively and he’s in no way toxic and never will be. You can choose what you want to play for a reason
---
As someone who has played on Xbox since the game came out, I am mindblown. 
---
Like half of me doesn’t believe they fixed the killer with the biggest FPS issues on a map like red forest. 
---
That’s great news. 
---
It sounds like you camp or proxycamp by your statement.  I've had no problems pipping with new system.  Double pipped twice.
---
“It’s already hard enough to get to rank 1” No. It was almost impossible to depip, this change might be over the top, but I see it as an improvement
---
Damn I didnt know Ginormica was ingame
---
Gate switches, too. I'm not sure the infection is even visible on gate switches, but maybe I just wasn't paying attention last time it happened to me.
---
can we talk about how unbalanced the crows are? and i dont mean spies from the shadows being buffed and nerfed i mean the idle crows that circle if you dont move for 32 seconds. i've clocked it it's 32 seconds of not moving! ridiculous! 
---
the fact that the model has leg-hair disturbs me
---
O
---
What’s up with the wave of canping killers recently? Ever since the new update killers have dropped 50 IQ
---
Don’t camp
---
We've all heard about Nea The Killer. Now get ready for the Nea Ye Lovecraftian Old One 
---
LOL so you have no defense for the data.  Your only response to actual data is "I don't like what it shows because it proves me wrong."
---
I dont think Freddy is *bad****,*** just weaker than the other killers, but no killer is straight up bad, get him if you want to, he can be really fun to play. 
---
Yes you broke it down and it made no sense which is why they look foolish to everyone here
---
Play as you want, most of the time people will complain anyways.
---
When I play killer and hook someone, I tend to go to the closest gen while looking around and when I see someone rushing to save the recently hook meat sack, I turn around and go back of course. Apparently this is called camping. Similar thing happens  if you unhook someone in front of me - I will down that dude and put him back up. this is not tunneling, it's your own fault.
---
Even tho I wouldn't recommend to face camp, since it's boring for both sides, but I understand where it comes from. 
---
This is wrong.  Getting 2 Kills is a draw not a loss for a Killer.
---
Why do people continue to insist that hag is powerful? She was getting outperformed by Freddy at rank 1 before her buff, and she's not much better now.
---
Doctors shock doesn't really do much, yes it can stop vaults but in most cases it won't give him enough time to do anything about it, and he doesn't cancel any pallet loops because by the time you shock and do whatever to stop it the shock has gone off or the pallet has already been dropped (or just looped once more). I think legion is just a tad more deadly than Herman, but the difference is negligible. 
---
Happy cake day btw! :)
---
Nea is better smh
---
Until you said pharmacy I honestly thought you were talking about Ace. 
---
F I N G E R G U N S
---
Entirely subjective, and also wrong
---
The way Adept achievements work is that you need to 4K the survivors to get it, without a mori. No need for a Merciless Victory. The description of that kind of achievements kinda stayed that way because, before, you would get the merciless victory message everytime you 4k'd, despite how long the match lasted. I think it's misleading and should get rewritten to avoid further misunderstandings.
---
She’s a defensive killer like leatherface around hooks. Once they get corrupt you know you’re getting camped.
---
Yeah totally agree with you. Usually i camp just the toxic players and play normally for the rest of the game
---
&gt; sick
---
Haha
---
Wasn’t facing the right direction, sorry.
---
They do. Ive hotten one or two when someone DC'd
---
I don't ever camp unless a survivor is toxic. Sometimes you get a game with potatoes though, and every time you hook all 3 teammates come to try and save. Those situations suck because it's going to look like you're camping no matter what lol
---
Alright that makes sense I guess. This is also the opposite from my playstyle (as explanation to why I do really bad with her)
---
Yeah makes sense. I think that camping overall is stupid as a killer but if i can remove a toxic player by camping so i can enjoy the rest of tge game...i will 100% do it xd
---
I get that NOED is annoying, but if NOED is activated the killer already lost IMO
---
It’s been changed from a get out of jail free card to an anti-tunneling Perk.
---
Some survivors are morons and don’t know how to play against campers
---
And we were calling Jane dummy thicc
---
Not when they swf their rank 20 friends 
---
And when it took 3 seconds to break a pallet...
---
Yeah agree...like it's easy BP but i still kibda feel bad for the survivors when it happens.
---
So that means it's okay to insult me and make incorrect judgements about my intentions? I don't mind if people don't like my joke but I'm not going to take shit lying down.
---
Legion is still hetr, sorry but bad OC
---
This community is almost as bad as the cod community, always complaining about everything. I much rather this game to be playable and look bad, then look ok and be unplayable with low FPS
---
No im a nice piggy :)
---
And to think there was a time when lots of people were telling that F13 is better than DbD...
---
It’s sad because DS is supposed to stop tunnelling but once again BHVR failed by lessening the stun time. Tunnelling is pretty crappy and should be punished like that.
---
It’s a meme. This is exactly the response I’m looking for. 
---

These could realistically be used as weapons.
---
My beans are cool, just not with this person, you would understand if you saw previous comments they made.
---
Never know with some people 
---
You’re not, especially if you’re in the red ranks. 
---
You lose because you’re probably used to camping and won’t ever get better with this attitude. Leave the hook and find a survivor and look how you’ll start improving.
---
Well I thought I was losing my mind yesterday after I unhooked them next to a camping Piggy, got no stacks from WGLF AND they got downed instantly even though I was running BT.  
---
At least it's a known thing and not just me losing my mind.
---
With the new console optimization it's the perfect time to pick her up. She is also considered to be at the top of the food chain when it comes to console killers, i think even better than Nurse.
---
Piggy without the Mask ! 
---
And thats why u gp for the grab
---
 Clown. At B. With no addons.
---
Noob3 got 2dcs in his toxic huntress vid and still got it. 
---
I've posted a video here before where the second the game starts someone's on my totem 
---
That's what this Amanda did too!!
---
Michael should be the same tier as bubba imo
---
4.300001%* my bad.
---
Wraith = Beanpole Boi
---
Emote to bypass that timer
---
How? He's got zero belly. He's all muscle.
---
He's got Blood Warden. That's... about it
---
Cool perk. how do i unlock it?
---
Oh nice xd Tried playing as her, won 3 games in a row...but that was due to survivors rage quitting and being potatos. Like her kit so far tho and can't wait to learn to use her full potential. I think learning her kit overall will improve my tracking skills bc i suck following the scratch marks and the spirit is all about scratch marks xd
---
She can block 3 gens for up to 2 minutes if she has the Corrupt Intervention perk, but it’s pretty bad. You can just walk to a different gen.
---
He's city trained :\^)
---
When you do the DS/SB/360 thing it looks like a new perk
---
Oochido Fan
---
You enjoy the fun of being chased by the killer and infuriating them you unlock the ability to tbag at normal speed/360/instaflashlight the killer when you press the activate ability button while spamming crouch
---
*Ayyyyy!*
---
Still have a high rank in your team then
---
Lmao😂
---
Well DH can get mindgamed easily (probably easier tbh I just have to get my stain on the survivor) so how is this a part of the debate? Think about it. Say there is at least 10-20 meters between me and the killer. I find a locker and jump in. Alls I have to do is be smart and recognize when they try to mindgame. This is the skill needed to wait at pallets. *Wait* at pallets. Also, most of the time you’ll see where the killer is. Head On isn’t supposed to be used in chase. You *can* but that’s not the intended use. The point is that when hiding in a locker you have a defense.
---
So that's the logic... 🤔
---
Actually I’m not salty I’m just curious why it matters
---
i have some like this but with Myers, so sweet
---
I've whacked people doing this or walking up tractors. It's just like "WHERE'RE YOU GOIN'?!"
---
Mira from R6S reference, I like that ;)
---
Yup. 
---
And then you have their power...
---
This use to freak me out. Especially because I usually only play killer for the dailies or to take a break off survivor. But usually they end up being immersed urban evaders trying to gen rush with no looping ability, with one bozo trying to flash light save and failing constantly.
---
I disagree with Hillbilly's placement, his arms and legs are thinner than Wraith's.
---
I suggest the new tier 'Beanpole' for Wraith, Hillbilly, and Adiris 
---
the change was for the better, the issue is just how enduring effects it
---
Not really,i have high rank friends and they constantly complain about how their team is dumber than rank 20 survivors
---
They are the high rank lol 
---
I'm going to check through my achievements again to be sure but I don't think it gave it to me. Never can rank up survivor especially not now
---
Adrenaline. And self-care is overrated

THE FUCKERS FUCKED WITH MY CROWS! 
---
I LIKED THAT PERK HOW IT WAS, YOU GODDAMN DICKS! YOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING ONE, TINY, PIECE OF ENJOYMENT OUT OF THIS GAME?
---
Prove Thyself, the change they made to it is fantastic and I love the extra bloodpoints for being a team player. 
---
Wait I’m confused, I haven’t played in awhile, what’s wrong with legion?
---
Ask one of these killermains if they think ebony mori should get nerfed as well and prepare for downvotes and pikachufaces how ebony mori (a perk 10x as strong as 4 DS's) is even comparable to evil DS. Maybe if truetalent could open his yap about it some more during his streams they could parrot that part of his "both sides have OP things" arguments.
---
But then they escape the trap on first try even though your addons are supposed to make it harder.
---
From my understanding muscle can still make you thicc considering the ass is technically a muscle.
---
I do find it funny when I 4K 5gen an altruistic potato squad and de-pip.
---
I forgot about the buff it got, I’m going to try to use it more
---
Will do, thank you.
---
And yet, killers keep NOED just as strong as ever, so they can get their double kill after being thoroughly outplayed all match
---
4Head
---
Did I miss the /s or are 32 people actually upvoting something so angry and petty?
---
You should just get on a gen and do it, pls stop selfcaring for the love of god. Take medkit and run botany if you want to heal yourself. 
---
Good experience I guess
---
You know what's great?
---
Old Ruin and New Ruin together. Oh boy it's so fun. Fun fun fun. 
---
You guys've never seen an ass or what 
---
Left behind's perk description is busted too.
---
FREAKKKKKKK
---
Except matchmaing, which is huge for worse players as they rank up eaay and good players dont, so they more often end up together.
---
Adrenaline always kills me when I play Freddy, why does it wake you up if it doesn't remove sickness or madness
---
Or if a survivor dc’s rip devout and malicious especially 
---
I honestly like the new ranking system, it's similar to the old one apart from the safety pip. This is how it should be. I see way too many red rank survivors who act like they don't belong at their current rank.
---
You can either fight fire with fire, or bend over and bite the pillow, those are your options.
---
This is the post I need 
---
I love playing games as killer too. Ultimately I just want points lol. It's not often that I get a 4k unless they are all salty asswipes lol
---
*Wheeze*
---
Why do you people care about rank in DbD which gives no benefit for a killer? 
---
When you don’t tunnel, keep pressure up and don’t have to worry about four people wasting all your time for body blocking and getting extra DS’s. ❤️😍😍❤️❤️😎😎💋🥰🥰🥰🥰
---
No you most definitely didn’t lol
---
They went WAY too far. Basically you need to have a magical game where you do 3 gens, unhook everyone, and escape 4 times, for 30 seconds each, and escape, by yourself. And not even taking into account there are other people that need to do the same
---
Its a lot easier to use now that you don't have to worry about the shitty chase detection
---
When everyone jumped aboard the SWF bandwagon.
---
Absolutely 
---
You could always read patch notes but I'll give a TL;DR. Rank pipping requirements are divided into categories based on color. This means the requirements to pip for ranks 1 through 4 (red ranks) are the same, etc.
---
Not TL;DR 
---
That means if you are rank 4, you need to get all 4 iridescents to double pip (which is now more difficult than before, especially for killers that simply don't chase, i.e. Nurse, Spirit using phase to get hits. Also applies to No Mither or survivors not healing) Basically unless you get consistent 9+ hook 4 kill games, drag out or drop chases for survivors to heal to score more hits, hope they don't do gens, etc., you will either get a depip, safety pip, or just 1 pip. If a survivor tries to Kobe and forces stage 2, or DC's when downed, or simply doesn't get saved by team mates, that match is thrown out the window. Depip. Almost every game at least one survivor does this meaning pipping at all in red ranks is extremely difficult.
---
Added a sound effect that survivors can hear when she activates phase walk. So you can't fake it at pallets/killer shack anymore to psyche people out. :/
---
BUT YOU'D STILL HAVE TO WAIT 3 SECS IN A LOCKER TO USE IT. NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD DO IN A CHASE, AND YOU COULD GET SIMILAR DISTANCE FROM THE KILLER IF YOU JUST STARTED RUNNING AWAY INSTEAD OF SITTING IN A LOCKER.
---
I think the devs should come up with more ways other perks can fuck over Freddy, because at this point, fuck him.
---
Thick Latin Girl: *exists* 
---
You: **HOW ABSURD DOES THIS SJW REPRESENTATION STRETCH REEEEEEEEEEEEEE** 
---
Relax dude, it’s a woman. A pixelated woman. 
---
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
---
We’ll Make It.  Just too good to keep everyone healed up imo.
---
that would be a cool perk for 6 seconds 
---
Normally higher rank means a higher skill level so if you want to play with people of equal skill you’d want to pip.  If the system worked then that should just mean playing your best and you’d pip if you did well.
---
The way it is now you’re punished for efficiency so you’re right you should worry about getting a pip and just play.  The problem is it’s going to jumble everyone in mid-rank and stick a bunch of low skill players with high skill players which won’t be much fun for anyone.
---
I think Hag and Trapper are still the shortest and tallest killers respectively 
---
Trapper x Meg uww
---
Fuming 
---
Dafuq is a fon?
---
No, he is saying that catching 4 subhuman-tier idiots like that and then swatting them down 1 by 1 is not bannable.
---
i like the idea that survivors cant rank up when the only thing they did was genrushing as that doesnt require any skill. the idea behind this pip rework is pretty good. the implementation though.....
---
That moment when you care so little about graphics that you dont even notice.
---
It's stupid I know but with up toxic this community is,you don't really have a choice. Otherwise you'll just get called a "salty/baby survivor/killer"
---
Complaining about a perk for months on end with your most dominant streamers checking "how many DS did they have" after every fucking game even if he gets 4K after 4K = Complaining about a top-tier perk getting gutted  and made into a shitty bandaid for the most toxic playstyle to "be slightly delayed" 2 days after it happens, totally the same, both sides complain about shit equally, upvote me more other killermains who constantly bitched and moaned.
---
It's bugged. It works only once.
---
Hell yeah!! Fave ship of mine
---
So for the last two days ive been running a useless perk. Nice
---
Your right, but you’re contradicting yourself there...
---
Also DS was the very definition of “not fine”. Now it’s an anti tunnel perk. Good as it is now.
---
Pebble? Why'd you do Urban Evasion and not Diversion?! ^(/s)
---
That aside, it looks really cool OP.
---
That's very stupid. Do you know that as of now if a killer snowballs through a match and kills all 4 survivors easily because they either played stupid or the killer played real good, the killer literally gets punished for ending the game too early.
---
I'd have to literally farm or let survivors go on purpose to extend games.
---
Urban evasion for sure. I love being able to creep around trees super fast. 
---
But it's not like you are never getting a pip and constantly depip. Yeah most of the time it's safety and sometimes it's black, but I'd say I still mostly getting ranked up even without caring about it, just playing my usual.
---
It just feels for me that people are angry because they aren't getting rank as fast as they used to tbh.
---
My husband likes to play jokes about Jane but it doesn’t make him want to play survivor lol
---
They can jus go back down the stairs... 
---
I mean don't get me wrong their are some really good survivors out there who are decent at the game and fun to go up against and watch.
---
But man oh man as someone who mostly solo queues as survivor these days? I end up just switching to killer instead because it's fucking miserable to play this game without friends.
---
And not even in a ''I need them as a crutch way." Because I tended to only play with a two man squad anyways.  But just I need them for the emotional support of the stupidity I am seeing from my team mates. 
---
A shoulder to cry on is the world.
---
Killer main here. I dont chase unhooked survivors. Haven't been hit by ds for many moons.
---
I’d have to disagree with you especially as in some games I haven’t had any obsession perks whilst my friend has ran the new decisive and hasn’t been caught so the obsession stays with me and I’ve been killed through rancor.
---
Once you get to higher ranks you really do almost never get a pip and can depip with 20k playing well.  At lower ranks you’ll almost always get one.  Again the problem is it funnels everyone to the middle regardless of skill.
---
Jake is best fpr hiding with his standard cosmetics, otherwise pick anybody.
---
What are you actually on? I will agree with you. Ebony Mori is OP, but you only get one what? Every 10 games if your unlucky? Compared to a perk that you could activate EVERY GAME?!? Are you serious?
---
I don’t care if it’s a little more blurry, the better FPS makes playing killer so much better 
---
I am upset 
---
Spine-chill and pebble master. I can't say how many times those have given me the opportunities to escape. But it's a lot!
---
He's fun to play as. But not against. I don't mind battling against him compared to a nurse.
---
I don't think you read my post. I don't like the playstyle of "always need a 4k" that's getting pushed by the patch and it's still insanely easy as well as effective to camp in the new emblem system if you have more than two braincells. In fact I camped in a few of my games just to test how punishing the system was and as long as you keep your distance while doing it you wouldn't even know that there's a system built to try and stop you from doing it
---
its just not realistic how much you need to do to not depip and its a joke that you have to compete with other survivors for your pips instead of working together. there are only 5 gens. not everyone can do 2,5 gens. getting healed? screw you, i want to self care for points! etc. 
---
i guess its an indirect nerf to noed. with pips being so hard to get, people might actually cleanse dull totems now /s
---
He’s just boring to play as and against
---
Map redesign and dynamic map changes based on killer comes to mind, but that would probably take years to develop and the game would get bugged to hell if it ever got released.
---
Same thing with NOED, your team could play great all game and then the killer gets 1/2 kills because of it 
---
Yea, I think with the right perks and add-ons she's upper-mid tier. Pretty solid killer. Only thing I noticed is she reeeeaaally struggles on maps like treatment center, the high walls make it super easier to dodge her vomit.
---
I don't get it. How are you in the middle if you have a red rank? It's not like you'll be depipped all the way back once you get to reds
---
Iron will for me too. Strongest survivor perk in the game imo
---
You're probably rank 20
---
Downvoted because it's too true and too painful.
---
1. Adrenaline 
---
2. Bond
---
Can’t live without them. Sometimes I feel tied to use We’ll Make It as well. Barely leaves a spot open for Balanced Landing...dear god. I can’t get away from them at survivor perk layout. 
---
Adrenaline. Bond. We’ll make it. Balanced Landing. 
---
everyone hates survivors. some hate them so much, they choose to become killers
---
Decisive strike because I don't like getting farmed
---
Haha that’s amazing 
---
That's true for every killer that has an ability that deals dmg. Nothing in the plague kit promotes camping
---
If I get what you mean right, that you are basically saying that middle has shifted from rank 1-2 to rank 7. But isn't it actually a good thing?
---
Lots of people who are posting screenshots with rant about ranks actually have rank 1 so I don't think they are being deranked back to 7. Doesn't it mean that rank system now actually is more precise now considering it was not so hard to get to rank 1 before and there were like a real lot of potatoes there?
---
Okay...? There's still going to be 2 other people on gens if youre only chasing one (that is if you even find them) while i'm self caring? 
---
I highly doubt it
---
That's because the descriptions are wrong. 
---
Originally the description was "achieve a merciless victory with the killer's perks" because if you got a 4K it was automatically a merciless victory. However, with the emblem system they implemented, it was possible to get a merciless without a 4K, and if the game goes quick enough it's possible to get a 4K without it being called a merciless. 
---
Regardless, the descriptions are wrong. The achievement is still, and has always been, to just make sure all the survivors die. 
---
You can get them with moris. 
---
&gt;godsent
---
well I just did Adept Leatherface yesterday and didnt Kill everyone 
---
I mean if I find a flashlight in a chest and don't have an item, I might as well use it until I get another item from a chest
---
Bring a pink mori or a game map offering. 
---
Either the mori will make everything easier or the map will. That's how I go about getting those achievements, works like a charm. If you can't do it even with those offerings, just ask a survivor group to farm. 
---
His name is literally already on the PS4. Ashley J. Williams perks are usable.
---
r/samespecies (nsfw)
---
I always hated Mysers, but you can still play against him and have balanced chases. Every character is abusable imo.
---
To get a merciless on red ranks you have to get all iridescent emblem, so 4 gens remaining/ 3 gens not touched, at least 10 hook actions (what is kinda difficult since a lot of people go into struggle o kill themselves on first hook/dc) and a 4k, finding every survivor (2% BTW) and chasing them for almost no time and win those chases and hit all survivors multiple times but also not let them get healed too much. Seems kinda difficult don't you think?
---
My main problem with the previous ranking system was that it wasn't an accurate representation of skill, now it is even less of a representation of skill
---
I have literally no idea how that's possible. I guess maybe the requirements for the achievement changed to match the description? Not sure, haven't gone for adept plague yet. But as of the patch before this one, it was absolutely just get a 4K.

Ah okay! Good to know lol

Fair enough I haven't really played, the idea seems alright they just took it too far I guess 
---
even at Legions release I did the Adept while killing only 2....
---
I get what you mean and I’m not saying it’s not good that 7 is middle.  I’m saying it’s so ridiculously easy to pip in low rank and so ridiculously difficult to pip at high rank that middle is going to end up being almost everyone which defeats the point of having a ranking system.

---
You get less hooking actions for using a mori, what is necessary for an iridescent emblem (you need to get every iridescent emblem to get a merciless now on red ranks)
---
It’s not quite to 60 but it’s way better than it used to be for my One-S. Doc match in red forest was extremely smooth. 
---
You on console? Because that just doesn't make sense, I've never heard of that happening. I got a merciless with trapper (twice) and it didn't pop because I only killed 3. 
---
Me and my friend were playing together, we get a lil immersed. He'll be the one who just wants to gtfo and I'll be the altruistic one. We're standing at the gate as someone gets hooked and he asks, "Idk should we go save him?" and I respond "always." 
---
He distracts the killer while I get the save and we all escape. Gotta get them points somehow ;)
---
&gt; am I supposed to let the survivors get saved
---
Kinda sounds like you camp though. You pretty much *are* supposed to let the survivors get saved.
---
This exchange was far too civil for a Reddit post... You both are proving yourselves as gentlemen. There is no place for you here!
---
God dang why is my man using PWYF
---
PC and in steam it even says "get a merciless victory" 
---
The the ranking of brutal/ruthless/merciless is irrelevant. You just need the 4K. Unless that's been changed. 
---
Like I said in another comment, originally a 4K was automatically a merciless. When that changed, they never updated the descriptions. 
---
K I know it's salty killermains favorite word but "entitled" doesn't fit in everywhere, I'm laughing at how angry and petty you are for not using your BPS on killer, which btw you couldn't use on your friends anyways, stop backpeddaling. I don't give a fuck about your BPS and I'll probably never be in your rank 15 facecampfests.
---
I like the sound of that last idea. It would satisfy both sides.
---
Full terror radius. Her perk was only the gen one. Idk wth happened but yea. This game sometimes. 
---
I think they fixed that with the new patch, they said so in the patch notes at least
---
Yep, you rarely ever have to heal yourself more than once a game. And if you just use adrenaline, you're healing yourself by doing gens
---
Fuck looking for ruin, that's why I use Stake Out
---
Yes I am aware, it says that on Xbox too, and I'm telling you that on console it has never popped unless you get the 4K for me or any of my friends. The ranking at the end is irrelevant, it's just the 4K itself because that's what the achievement originally was and they never changed the description. 
---
But maybe it's ridiculously easy to pop in low ranks for you because you don't belong there anymore? Try to remember the times you were only starting with DbD. It was a damn while before I finally got to rank 19 lmao
---
I'd suggest that what you consider by ridiculously easy to pip may be harder for other players, and isn't that exactly what ranking system is supposed to actually check?
---
well Not on PC it seems
---
Bc its not about skill at red ranks anymore, it’s about opportunity and forced unnatural gameplay. You speak on something you haven’t tried and they didn’t balance anything, they tipped a scale. 
---
Yea, you can't dribble DS anymore. He just wiggled out.
---
No that’s your teams fault doing all the outer gens and leaving those 3 gens. You got 3 genned it happens. 
---
Haha must be nice, some of those achievements truly sucked, would've been a lot easier just going for the merciless ranking rather than the 4K 
---
I’m amazed at the people thinking this was cool. SWF group communicating when it is okay to get hit or finish gens is an incredibly OP and shitty thing to do in this game. 
---
Yeah, people complain about how easy it is to rank up and now that people have to really try all we get are complaints. People are just never satisfied.
---
You just said so yourself, if your unfamiliar it looked like a Nazi coat.i mod a few things and pretty much any Nazi related pictures will get you a ban. Are you a child who is unfamiliar with racism and why that is the way it is, if so let me tell you. If you post nazi artwork almost anywhere youll get banned. Pretty sure youll be walking a fine line on even this sub. But the swearing thing is bull shit especally when you consider end game chat is probably one of the most toxic cesspools in existence
---
Better chance at pipping in higher ranks solo than you do in swf.

The New Patch just ruined the game
---
Now when we see killers moaning about ds we know they’re tunnelling bitches. 
---
jup, Legion is a good example. its much easier getting emblems then kills
---
Got a game as plague using only her teachables, got a 4k, no Adept, read a little of the achievement and you need to get a merciless victory (a double pip), I thought it was only a bug, did it again, 4k, almost merciless but apparently I had -4% on chaser because I was close to the hooked survivor on the game map because I was patrolling gens and had to go near them for a split second.
---
Dude people aren’t pipping in red doing 3-4 generators, unhooking multiple people and escaping unhooked which isn’t fair or fun for high level play.  At low level yes it should be easier but now it’s so trivial these new players are going to end up matched with players and killers much higher skill than them almost immediately and will usually get steamrolled.  At the end of the day it’s a matter of opinion so if you think the system works that’s good on you.  Enjoy.

Oh, you have poor reading skills, okay. When did I say i used killer offerings on survivors? I said that when I play survivor, i won't use streamers unless I'm with friends. Make sure you actually have read something properly before you accuse someone of backpedalling, sweetheart.  
---
Reading is hard for you but do put some effort into it, Mr, overcompensation.
---
Then maybe they did change the achievements. As of last patch it always worked (on console) how I'm describing it, it's always been the kills not the ranking at the end. 
---
That's a bummer. I guess just wait for rank reset if red ranks are being such a bitch. I'm gonna try adept plague when I get home and get back to you. 
---
I responded to another comment with this so I'll just copy and paste:

---
I say mid tier. She can destroy dumb survivors and survivors to lazy to change their style. Survivors who adapt well can run her for days. 
---
Than you &lt;3 !
---
I've recently started playing Spirit myself, and she is very different from other killers. She is also currently suffering from two bug since yesterday's patch: survivors can now hear a glass breaking sound whenever she starts to phase or vault a window, and any stun reset your power bar. 
---
That being said, I'd recommend checking out the two YouTube guide links below. I found these really helpful when first starting out, and they did a really good job of explaining strategies and uses for her power. I'm sure some of the other more talented spirits on here will be able to give you some better advice, but I found these guides super helpful and hope you get some value out of them. They are worth the watch!

100% true. You and your trash team decided to do the easy gens on the outside. Leaving yourself with an easy patrol for the killer. The fact you cant realise this and have to make a post blaming RNG  speaks volumes about your skill. 
---
HONESTLY, THIS GAME HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL BUT IT IS LOCKED TO ONLY ONE GAMEMODE THAT MAKES NO SENSE FROM A HORROR MOVIE PERSPECTIVE. I MEAN SERIOUSLY THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO GET A COUPLE OF GENERATORS UP AND RUNNING AND ESCAPE WHILE THE MONSTER TRIES TO STOP YOU. THIS GAME REALLY DOES NEED NEW GAME MODES FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ESCAPE WHAT ABOUT ACTUALLY TRYING TO DESTROY THE MONSTER AND RUNNING AROUND THE MAP DESTROYING STUFF OF TAKING IT PLACES SO THE CREATURE GETS WEAKER OR A SURVIVAL MODE WHERE YOU NEED TO LIVE TO SEE DAYLIGHT AND THE MONSTER HAS TO KILL PEOPLE IN CERTAIN WAYS AND PLACES.
---
ALSO, THE MAPS ARE WAY TOO SAMEY AS THEY ARE ALL MOSTLY JUST THE SAME OPEN AREA SQUARE WITH DIFFERENT SCENERY ATTACHED, YOU COULD DO A WHOLE LOT MORE WITH THIS GAME WITH A DIFFERENT MAP AND GAME MODE DESIGN THEN THE WHOLE OPEN AREA THING. YOU COULD HAVE VENTS THAT THE SURVIVORS CAN USE TO GET AROUND AND ONLY THE LARGER ONES CAN'T GO INTO THEM BUT MAYBE TRAP THEM ETC. I PLAYED THIS GAME ON AND OFF FOR A FEW DAYS AND THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST SURPRISING WASTE OF POTENTIAL I HAVE SEEN IN A GAME FOR A LONG TIME.
---
I nearly got a heart attack when I saw Freddy being on top, but then I realized it was weapons tier list
---
If the killer is anywhere near me I'll stay and let them down me at the gate, no t-bagging. Only exception is Meyers, I'm just leaving against him.
---
Girl she’s just SLAYIN the runway
---
Yeah the new system makes survivors play more for themselves now. Some of us want to get back into the higher ranks not because we are tryhard but because we get bored playing killers who are lower skill than those we are used to. 
---
Yes but the bar would only move if the killer was carrying me
---
Yeah, I play on console too, and also got confused first time this happened
---
I mean that is what they said in the notes for both the PTB and live versions. In red ranks you need all 16 points to double pip, which considering what they want red ranks to be makes sense to me.
---
You're clever.
---
Git Gud or dc.. without skill or brain maybe u have to main Legion xD Lmao 
---
Lovely combo
---
Absolutely agree. I have to run kindred on all my characters or else it seems no one will get you. Or opposite everyone comes and at the wrong times. My first match today I found a ruin totem and evaded the killer just to have someone run her right back to me. Then as the plague had the vile purge someone took me off the hook after being injured, so when she took me down she injured both of us and I got mori’d. I can’t stand the new ranking system (it seems like when I wake up I’ve lost more pips just by turning off the game) and even with farming with a killer you can’t get a pip which is so weird. 
---
&gt;Back when I used to play killer, I was sitting on about 20 or so streamers for all of them since I refuse to use anything that could benefit a toxic survivor.
---
................................ yeah totally my reading skills you fucking inbred dumbass kid.
---
Nurse doesn't get much in chase because she shits on people too hard, so she still doesn't pip
---
So much rage.
---
"Now you hear me, Now you won't..."
---
Apparently stunning the killer with pallet and saving the hooked guy is also toxic for this piggy :D Teabagging is always bad but dude these other things are there for survivor to do and survive. How do you expect them to not unhook lmao or stun you when you are about to hit them. 
---
Huh, new survivor perk: Hook Wiggle: If you are hooked, the wiggle action appears, if the wiggle bar gets completed the entity thinks you are so sexy and let you escape from the hook with the broken status effect for 80085/420/69 seconds. This perk can be activated on every occasion you get hooked. 
---
"Damm you thick! Shake them booty real hard baby!" -Uknown whispers (totally not the entity... *cough cough*)
---
I have and it feels inefficient. Since gens get stopped from being touched, survivors have more reason to look around and find it.
---
Well it would help if people could stop seing themselves as a "main" of either side. Seriously I'm no angel in that regard myself since I'm also slightly on the killer side of things, but that doesn't mean I want survivors to get 75% Movement speed and Gens to take half an hour.
---
Whenever somebody calls me out for being a "salty killer main" I just ask them if they ran out of arguments and had to resort to that. Just my opinion, maybe the people could just chill a bit and listen to others.
---
facecamping Myers tops the video off.
---
I fully expected their power to be disguise focused and they’d have some really cool stealthy killer mechanics rather than “hurr  durr I vault windows (and to less degree, pallets) like all killers should be able to from the start”
---
I mostly mean windows. Seriously you’re telling me these killers need to daintily step through a window?
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Tracking Perk
---
Flex perk
---
I think Ruin and M&amp;A are key for Freddy. Ruin slows the game down just a little bit and M&amp;A allows you to find survivors and sneak up on them easier. 
---
For tracking, use anything that helps you find them. BBQ, Surveillance, Nurses are all good options.
---
For flex, it can be anything to either help slow the game down more or provide utility. Sloppy butcher is good and pairs nicely with nurses. Make your choice works well as you usually want to run back to the hook to put everyone back into dream state. Brutal strength can help your looping.
---
I don't like the end-game exit gate builds that use NOED or blood warden. It's too gimmicky and rarely works.
---
For add-ons, i use the extended range and the reduced skill checks. The extended range is amazing. When you are patrolling you want to have your M2 held down and just sweep around. You will usually snipe people running through brush. Skill check one for obvious reasons. His purple add-ons are also really good. 
---
Literally just cleanse totems when you see them.
---
Killers couldn't do anything except eat shit or play dirty thanks to pre-nerf DS, *however* survivors CAN completely annihilate NOED not playing dirty, totally perkless, *and* before it even activates. You have absolutely *no excuse* except for "no totem counters".
---
It might be a bit too hard right now, but it does kinda seem like people are overreacting a bit, just because they're so used to ranking up being super easy
---
https://i.imgur.com/bEStmTd.gif
---
Wow same. I'm glad I checked new randomly. That sucks 
---
OH GOD YOU'RE RIGHT TEEHEE
---
this obsession switching bugged the obsession system I think. I played several matches with my friend and he ran DS, yet nearly every single match I started off as the obsession and in most of them, out of all 5 of us he was the only one who even had an obsession perk with DS.
---
Spinechill, because it works through a lot of the shenanigans a killer might have going on. It also gives me more than enough warning to move out of the way of a killer. 
---
I mean staying injured with legion wa done thing because he was 110 and would chase you the same regardless of health, but the plague is a 115 killer so leaving yourself broken it’s the smartest idea against someone who’s good at chase.
---
Plus, if you leave yourself sick, you only infect your teammates anytime you interact with one (the other option being they stay away from you or any gens or windows etc that you touch which makes the game harder for y’all) and in turn progress them towards being broken and making them cleanse, which ends up giving her more corrupt purge than if you had just cleansed yourself.
---
So more like a good at low rank, bad at high rank killer.
---
Good as a GIF, the music killed it for me. 
---
too*
---
Just wish the pebble requirements were better. 45s in terror radius is a long ass time.
---
Freddo
---
Oh
---
Legion's the shortest.
---
I think it might just be a console thing and lag issues but I actually find I get hit by her puke corrupt or vile when I'm around a corner. Thus happens though you know 
---
I think all achievements were bugged with the new update, but I think they patched it? That might be the issue?
---
I agree with you. This meme gets reposted and hits the front page every single time. But there’s no time to lose arguing. If they like this good for them honestly 
---
&gt;Dude people aren’t pipping in red doing 3-4 generators, unhooking multiple people and escaping unhooked which isn’t fair or fun for high level play.
---
I still don't get how pipping up is related to "fun". Yeah getting recognition is fun by itself, but you are still getting iridescent emblems and bp gain hasn't changed, the only things that changed are pipping condition, and that's more related to matchmaking by skill than by fun as I see it.
---
And yet again, are new players actually pipping up as fast as you are saying or it's your subjective conclusion on pipping in lower ranks based on your skill?
---
Lol, you've done it again. You said that i couldnt use streamers with friends before because you misunderstood that at that point i was talking about my survivor streamers and here you are digging yourself into a deeper hole by using a quote from a different part of my post to try to prove an issue you had with my post overall. Poor reading comprehension skills indeed.
---
Also you edited in a paragraph about how I'm apparently angry but here you are positively Reeee'ing over an opinion that upsets you to the point you're calling people inbred and i'm the angry one? No reading skills OR self awareness it seems.
---
EDIT:
---
And I really roll my eyes at the whole "good killers/players like the chase" - not because it isn't true, but the way it's been repeated over and over makes it sound like "Only bad players like something else", which is just arrogant and false. Especially coming in the same post speaking about "different playstyles".
---
Idk how to help with this. I just catch on to game mechanics quickly, so it makes it hard flr me to actually understand them. I literally learned a week ago that the Spirit emits sound while phasewalking.
---
I wanna know where people thing the plague is
---
Gotta 8k for that gold
---
It’s not our fault you can’t appreciate ass
---
Aaaand you're a douche, congratulations.
---
Way too little time to determine her in my opinion so far, for now I'd say she's around B or C at most
---
I was told you can use ebony Mori, but every time I do, it doesn't pop. I think you need to double pip. Oof
---
Because the devs hate Freddy players having fun
---
There's just nothing that makes sense about them. They are "Legion." But their powers have nothing to do with there being more than one of them. It's like if Trapper's ability was throwing hatchets instead of setting traps. He would only be "Trapper" by name. And the title of the chapter, "Darkness Among Us" was also stupid, because there's no sort of deception occurring. It was like they took a couple of really cool ideas, used them for marketing, and then did nothing with them.
---
It's the survivor that loses collision after being hit, so this is no different than blocking the stairs against injured survivors as any other killer
---
I really hope you’re being sarcastic 
---
damn... this one got me laughing way to loud in the office
---
Like I already said stay mad
---
A mother-daughter outing gone wrong 
---
Her power allows for survivors to make a choice. Either cleanse and give her a buff to her power or not cleanse and remain broken. I think it’s one of the more interesting powers in the game. 
---
She has only been out a few days and people are still learning the best way to play as her or against her. Most people I have talked to seem to think she’s in a good place. 
---
Had a game as spirit on the new map and got a solid totem spawn (btw they can spawn in the crypt). Killed 2 before they broke it. Felt good.
---
On many maps the plague is pretty hard to loop as she can vomit over pallets and if you do throw a pallet down she will just vomit on you and because of her ability to vomit on jungle gyms she can just about shut them down. Her corrupt vomit is great for hitting people at range and over loops and when they try to save. It’s still early tho so once survivors learn how to counter her I might think differently I’ve just had nothing but good games so far.
---
What's that porn still of the super tall lady holding the short lady? That's basically this.

I have some ideas!

Using **Dead Hard** wakes you up now, because you're tapping into your adrenaline banks to invulnerability dab; and everyone knows adrenaline = wake up.
---
The **Borrowed Time** timer won't go down until a Survivor is asleep to ensure that they can actually get the benefit of it against Freddy. Unfortunately this means that if Freddy doesn't sleep them they can keep the Endurance effect forever; but that's a sacrifice we're willing to make.
---
Successful skillchecks with **Autodidact** now Wake Up because they didn't have a great skillcheck; so it's, like, not even a *real* skillcheck so you technically missed it even though you hit it.
---
**Aftercare** now hides Survivors whose auras you can see from Freddy; because letting your friends get seen by the Killer wouldn't be a good way to 'honour your best buddies', now would it Jeff?
---
**Bond** is identical to Aftercare above, except it also hides your aura too. Obviously Freddy is weak against the power of friendship; and this perk should be changed to reflect that.
---
**Distortion** no longer loses tokens when used to counter Freddy's base aura reading because tokens should only be lost when a Killer uses a perk or add-on to see your aura. Freddy's base power does that, so the only fair solution is that Freddy should just permanently never see your aura with his power if you're using **Distortion**.
---
**Diversion**  can now be used to stun all Killers you hit them with the Pebble. Against Freddy, stunning him causes all Survivors to Wake Up because he loses his concentration on keeping them asleep.
---
**Pharmacy** now lets you use 4 charges of an Emergency Medkit to make a Survivor immune to Freddy's Dream Demon for 5 minutes; because all Emergency Medkits come with a ton of adrenaline shots in them. Also 'keep us awake' is in the quote for this perk. It only makes sense.
---
**Saboteur** skillchecks now Wake Up Survivors, because obviously messing up any skillcheck should wake you up, regardless of how easy it is to activate Sabotage skillchecks.
---
**Small** **Game** automatically prevents Freddy from sleeping you, because the Dream World is technically a giant Trap set by Freddy, the Killer, and Small Game is supposed to counter Killer Traps (and Totems). Also this perk now let's you ignore Blood Warden, because, again, Killer Trap must be countered.
---
**This Is Not Happening** prevents Freddy from injuring you, because you just disbelieve in his dream powers and ignore him. In was hinted at in the first movie of the original timeline that this is possible; so it's canon.
---
**Tenacity** now automatically Wakes Up a Survivor who starts recovering while crawling and prevents them from being picked up while awake; because Danny Glover is too cool for Freddy.
---
**Vigil** now automatically Wake Ups Survivors within 8 meters of you as long as you're still awake. You could hardly say that you look over your friends in dire situations if you didn't instantly wake them up with your presence.
---
**Wake Up!** now lets you Wake Up yourself without a skillcheck or another Survivor, because it's name is literally **Wake Up!**. Obviously this was always intended by the devs and just got left out due to some bug.
---
**Windows of Opportunity** now reveals all Survivors and Generators to sleeping Survivors with this perk; because they present Windows of Opportunity to Wake Up. Survivors running **Vigil** will have purple auras instead of red because they represent a better opportunity.
---
**No Mither** grants you the ability to injure, down, and Mori Freddy because you just can't be mithered with all his nonsense anyway.
---
What do you think?
---
Will be slowly posting more over at twitter as I finish them (@cybuuorg)! I will see how I'm feeling this week. 
---
Goodbye.
---
If the survivors were smart, they could have gotten out with only 1 or 2 dying down there. If everyone just got into a different locker, she'd be forced to grab one of them out, giving enough time for the other 3 to hop out and run up the stairs
---
Except that my rank 15 killer ass keeps getting paired with 10 and higher survivors. I realize that matchmaking is to blame there but ranks do have an indicator of your skill and playing the past couple days has genuinely made me think about uninstalling
---
I clearly mean don't be a big dumb and put you and your whole team in a position for this to happen. This is an okay strategy that comes with the plague. If this is bannable, than fuck every tactic killers have. These dumb ass rules people came up with no one cares about. This dude finished the game, he didn't hold it hostage. 
---
Love it.
---
Right, not really into the boring bum style anyways. 
---
I think every Killer should be able to Self-Mori if all 4 Survivors are in the Healthy State when the generators are powered.
---
Maybe it will eventually work like they intended it to. Maybe.
---
susie and frank are my favorite designed killers
---
this is called a 3 gen. If your team doesn’t do the inner gens, 9/10 times this happens and you get screwed for playing poorly.
---
"Honestly, guys don't worry about Freddy. He deserves this abuse." -Quentin Smith, probably
---
Sorry you got 3 genned but Ormond seems to be a survivor sided map to me. 
---
goodsended
---
Yeah. This is the fastest I've gotten games on PS4 in the longest time. I can't say much about the quality of the games however, but I'm still getting them pretty fast. Lol.
---
Adept Killer is just to sacrifice all 4 people. I believe all the achievements for the new Chapter are busted though.
---
*RaNK mEaNS nOThInG!!*
---
cries the ex rank 1 survivor main that now cant get beyond rank 8 with our new emblem system.
---
goodbye you urban evading, non altruistic, sandbagging scum!
---
(not saying you personally lol just in general.)
---
Yeah, no kidding. Even had a Wraith with the legacy prestige skin that just camped. Like, literally just stood there swinging at you.
---
Then a hag that not only trapped all entrances/exits, but then wouldn't even leave the area.
---
My rank is exactly the same spot it was before the update....so it's not like I've deranked (yet) to suddenly meet these killers
---
It's perfect!
---
Thank you for sharing. &lt;3
---
I'm 100% sure the killer still has collision after hitting a survivor, the survivor just loses their collision so they are able to move through the killer. I will gladly look at proof that says otherwise
---
Some are telling me i have to double pip
---
Strawman argument right there. People aren't complaining solely about it getting harder, people WANTED it to be harder to achieve. What they are complaining about is that It's that the way you need to play now to pip is counter-intuitive to how the game is supposed to be played.
---
It pits survivors against each other, because those who get the unhooks will pip the others won't. While the game is all about working together with survivors ( on the survivor side) and disrupting this so you can kill them from the killers side.
---
It makes it so that if you dominate the other party, as killer or as survivors, you will not pip because you didn't get enough emblem points. For example only 1 person gets hooked all game, oh well guess I won't pip since i won't get any benevolence points. Killers getting 4K, 5 gens and only safety pipping? You destroyed the opponent meaning your rank is too low for your opponent. This SHOULD result in double pips, but as of now, it doesn't.
---
People weren't only complaining about it being too easy, they already thought the emblem system wasn't great. Now they not just doubled down on it, they went all in on it. And it creates this mess of a system where actually being better than the other party can make you go DOWN in ranks. While also forcing a very specific way of play which is never good for any game. 
---
'As a small little extra: not rewarding your players with a sense of progression, even when in their eyes they played well ( escaping, doing gens, etc), will turn people away from a game. This will in time diminish your player base and that's bad for everybody playing that game.' This is besides the point i was making, but wanted to add that tidbit in as well.
---
These ' oh they asked for it to be harder, and now complain about it being harder' arguments make me severly question your brain function. Just because the previous form is too easy, doesn't mean this form can't be absurd. That's the equivalent of 'oh you don't like a red sweater, fine run around naked then'. Try to think for a second and actually read the complaints about the current system, hey at the end you can still think they are wrong, but then atleast you can try and formulate an argument that's not a halfassed strawman :)
---
i believe it’s only broken if 5 gens are done.
---
To be fair, you should have checked the shack anyway. It's on every map and has the same totem spot, so there's no reason to not check it if you spawn by it.
---
Good luck my guy, seriously. Survivor salt has been real for me this morning, and that’s coming from me, a surv main lmao.
---
I'm on ps4 as well. Solo games are allright, games with mutliple players take waaaay too long sadly
---
Escapes and cleanses. Now full health. 
---
The Plague: Damn it.
---
Uh huh. If I'm the last one and the killer doesnt come I'll just leave after a few seconds. It's not like I sit there for a minute waiting, but if they see me I'll stand there and let them get me if they want.
---
You are an idiot to be honest and it clearly says that you have not played as survivor or don't anymore maybe because you suck at it? I don't know. 
---
wow dude. this right there is why i never post anything on reddit 
---
r/jesuschristreddit
---
Ah, so you feel the need to have the last word although you're basically just repeating yourself. By all means, have the last word and show us all how weak willed you are. I won't respond again.
---
As a fellow Feng with adrenaline, this made my heart full of pure joy. 
---
Wraith is taller than the Trapper and i'm pretty sure the Plague is the tallest Killer now.
---
Hag is short because of her stance but if she were to stand up straight she wouldn't be one of the shortest. That probably goes to Freddy and/or Legion.
---
Doesn't matter. Eboni Mori should not exist in the game. 
---
Ok boomer
---
Piggy trolls are my favorite trolls 
---
Please update here if you find a fix without them patching. I legit cant play either. tried every fix I can think of and still cant make it through a full match.
---
I don't know what platform you're on but on PC I can find a game in a minute or less as a survivor and around 4 minutes as a killer which is properly indicated so the problem is either your internet connection or you should verify integrity of files.
---
Does Adrenaline take you out of dream or did you fail a skill check right before it triggered? 
---
Nice. 
---
hi hi look at dis nazi mod
---
I could understand the misunderstanding but I was given no chance to appeal or apologize. It wasn't like I went around saying that Hitler was right and they should give Clown an SS Officer uniform. I posted the image on several other Discords and never got so much as a passing remark. I usually had to flat out tell people that the image had gotten me banned for "Nazi imagery" before anyone even remotely considered the option.
---
I could understand the perspective of it being a Nazi meme but 20 seconds of research would've shown that it wasn't. But instead of giving the option to appeal the nuclear option was taken in order not to trigger people in a safe space.
---
I would've accepted a warning about a military outfit that happened to have red sleeves and how someone might have seen it the wrong way. But to permaban someone with zero chance to appeal over a Photoshop of a cat is ludicrous. With all due respect grow a spine: the only person who's triggered is you. Calm down and think rationally for a few seconds.
---
Hea not op but hes a fun sponge. Takes all the fun for himself and leaves the survivors bored and annoyed. Any legion worth his salt can keep on your butt non stop, leaping over everything you do. Counterplaying him is nonexistent. If he wants you, hes getting you. Gen rushing is the best way to deal with him, dont bother healing
---
Absolute unit
---
Takes you out of dream world
---
Fire shells are not OP, if anything they objectively make your shotgun worse!  And if you’re the kind of bitch that runs a Lewis Gun with escalation you should just shut... woah.  Sorry, I don’t know what came over me.  I just... (Vietnam Flashbacks to r/WW2)
---
Relax friend. If you’re going to present an argument, try not to resort to insulting the other party. Your comment was fine before you had to go insulting my intelligence like some superior being. It’s just an opinion on Reddit, no need to get into a hissy fit about it.
---
&gt;  I understand them wanting to change things to help out killers
---
I don't. I was a rank 1 survivor and I would never escape, but keep pipping. I started playing killer and it is so easy to get 2, 3, 4 kills and I make it a point NOT to camp or tunnel like a lot of other stupid killers.
---
Hard disagree. Fixing gens is and still is the goal of survivors to escape. If you fix all 5 gens and the killer doesn't get you, thats up to him not you. 
---
I don't play immersive ( blue haired bright shirt nea so kinda hard to be immersive) but i have no qualms with immersive players who focus on the objectives. It's a valid strategy and if you do it well, you deserve to pip. It's that simple.
---
Same story for killers, you get 4 kills however you do it, you get the pip. 
---
You play to complete an objective, it's that simple. You make your own strategy on how to do it,you'll realise soon enough of crawling across the map not saving teammates will get you to those 5 gens or if camping the first person at the hook will get you that 4K.
---
The incentive is that there are fewer idiots at the good ranks. I would want to rank up just because of that.
---
&gt; Everyone was talking about too easy to get rank 1. They all have to purposefully depip.
---
There are 100 thousand subs here.
---
Let's say 20 thousand people complain about system 1. You're going to hear about it.
---
Now it's changed. Lets say 20 thousand other people complain about system 2. You're going to hear about it.
---
And we still have 60 thousand people that don't care either way. 
---
She's not the beefcake he is, though. In terms of overall mass he comes in second, with only the Clown surpassing him there
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you very much!  
---
You're welcome. &lt;3
---
Now if you're a good survivor but are in rank 10 a week after rank reset you're stuck there almost. Especially with the way some killers in that rank play. I mean I've been rank 1 and just saying I never got face camped that often in rank 1 compared to rank 10
---
Well he will get a rework _soon_ and he might be good. He is fun to play now, go get him! 
---
What did I say that was offensive lol?  You clearly have a different opinion on the subject so this isn’t going anywhere.
---
It's super spiteful, but there's always the option to deny them the escape points... Of course, you deny yourself any points in the process. 
---
Legion is for people who don't have the ability to play the game on a mechanical level. If you find your self dribbling on your t shirt throughout the day he might be the killer for you, if you have basic motor functions don't mention him again.
---
Because there are hardly anymore red rank players. 
---
Why would a huntress even face camp you though? Like... we have axes. We can hit you as soon as you get close and than get our choice of who to down. That's a dumb killer
---
(Huntress main)
---
The devs already sayed that is a bug and they are working on it.
---
Also, for Adepts, you just need to get a 4k, the amount of points doesnt matters. 
---
&gt; Reddit players don't mind him because their chases against regular 115% M1 killers last less time than their chases with Legion. Plus Legion's view height makes it easier to hide from him. So of course they don't see anything wrong with a killer that throws the fun advanced stuff out the window.
---
Except this sub does almost nothing but complain about Legion, even in this very thread.  How do you scroll all the way down here and come to the conclusion that reddit doesn't mind Legion?
---
Same question, but as a survivor. I was rank 3 when the patch came out and now I’m rank 7. It hurts my poor ranking heart. 
---
Depends on whether survivors are easily rattled or not, but that does for any M1 killer. If they just do gens, you're fucked. If they sit there and try to heal every time they're injured, you'll do ok. 
---
"Survivors win." 
---
"Hara Kiri."

Giant Nea: *spawns*

---
Myers: Why do I hear boss music? 
---
I bought Freddy yesterday and even managed to get him to 40 in a couple hours. Out of all my matches I had a decent amount of 4Ks, some matches with a couple kills and also a few matches where I lost pretty badly. I think he's okay and I feel like at the ranks I am stuck at with the new pip system (13-12) people aren't that used to him. 
---
I think what I like most about him is being able to walk around and easily find people crouching behind something because they can't see me coming towards them. He also has superb aura reading thanks to the dream world mechanics. He's also immune to perks like kindred which is great considering how it got buffed recently.
---
In summary I think he's worth it. You also get a survivor that has pharmacy which I think is better than self care, especially if you pair it with botany knowledge. I think you can also use that one Ace perk that gives you a chance to get items with free addons to make the emergency medkits even better.
---
I dont think she is too much strong but it feels super funny to play with and agaisnt her.
---
And what do you expect if the gates are open? I mean, he has to let you escape or what. And you were toxic at the end. I can understand if he would have camped you at the beginning of the match with no reason but it seems you were toxic all the time running in circles around a pallet and blinding him. Survivor main detected. 
---
Reddit by and large has a huge disconnect from the more advanced stuff
---
Hell they threw enough of a fit to get DS nerfed even though it was fine as is in the previous patch
---
Honestly, I only care about rank as survivor. The higher the rank, the higher the chance of me getting decent teammates. 
---
As a survivor who has been rank 1 and I would say rightfully should be rank 1 every season, I can say I feel bad going against lower killers at rank 10 especially when they throw a random rank 15 killer against me. However it's almost impossible to rank up when the survivors are so much better than the killer and cannot get altruism or sometimes even chasing if someone else gets chased all game. Gen rushing is like the bane of ranking up but it's the objective. Not to mention the face camps. I just think it shouldnt be so hard in maybe green ranks. It should ramp up in purple and red. Idc I'll take a challenge. But I hate gen rushing and never getting any altruism and chaser and just black pipping every game. Then the one game you do get chased they face camp you. Sigh man I've had a rough time getting out of green rank. It's frustrating but who knows maybe it's just me 
---

(Is for Freddy)

**Platform**: PC
---
**Type of Bug**: Ingame
---
**Description**: I began the game with the Wiggle counter at the bottom of the screen and couldn't press A/D too quickly one after the other without stopping in game, which led to some bad chases. Then, once I had been hooked, the POV followed the killer instead of staying with me on the hook.
---
**Screenshot**: [https://i.redd.it/y1gdyy5wghn21.png](https://i.redd.it/y1gdyy5wghn21.png)
---
**Steps to reproduce**: I don't know, I'm sorry. It just happened as soon as I loaded in.
---
**System specs**: HP Omen, Intel core i5, Nvidia Geforce GTX. That's all I know, sorry.
---
I can feel your pain mate. Hopefully the devs are gonna fix this so we can pass through her when she pukes. 
---
Is this a joke? "It only takes 5 gens to get adrenaline" not as easy said as done. And imagine thinking doing the survivors objective is try harding. Its not. Adren doesnt affect you if you dont tunnel off the hook same as ds. And rewards you for completing all objectives. Ds is now an anti tunneling perk. Dont tunnel and you wont be affected. If you are really that scared just slug for 60 seconds. But youre wasting time when you can just chase someone else. It does protect from tunnelers because it gives them a chance to actually play the game and not be affected by tunnelers. Yeah you may die anyways but it wasted time which bought survivors to do gens and the tunneler loses
---
Finally some proof that Nea is the Entity lol
---
No way to hide from him, can’t counterplay using pallets and windows. Extremely annoying to play against 
---
Those biceps 😍
---
That's bad, he tunneled you and he did not pay for that. But, for him, it's better in the case of an end game escape 
---
I think you get survival points. I dont think botany or nurse's works on fountain cleansing
---
I just don't like going against low ranks. Especially as survivor I just don't like it. The game is about having fun but for some people having a challenge is fun. And I always enjoyed rank 1 killers more than lower rank
---
I think survivors still haven't realized she's basically a Huntress yet. The same positioning rules apply and her puke is functionally the same thing as a hatchet at the code level. The amount of survivors that hang out on a hill after they get the corrupt purge audio notification is silly. 
---
Most of my adepts I made on red ranks, except for Nurse, Huntress and Pig.
---
Pretty much. However this place isn’t anywhere near as bad as the dbd forum lol. Holy shit was that eye opening. I do think this sub is slanted towards killer too but it’s not horribly and there’s a lot of level headed people here on both sides. That place though.....yikes. To think the devs may look at that forum for feedback is not a good thing at all.
---
I don’t own Legion but I’m almost positive that’s the case. The Legion was an extremely good concept, but the overall execution is disgusting.
---
Put it this way: Players are in yellow/green ranks for one of two reasons. 1) They depipped there or 2) they just started playing.
---
So now we have a pool of players in those ranks who already aren't matched in skill level. A Survivor may have pipped down because of bad matches (getting tunneled, sandbagged, and camped will earn you a depip) or because they have a play-style that doesn't earn them as many emblem points (gen jockeying, only running the killer while other players do gens, or actually doing dull totems which net you no emblem points.) These Survivors nonetheless may know the major loops on every map, how to pallet loop, how to mind game- all things which are actually a reflection of their skill level in the game that aren't calculated by the emblem system. Net result means there are now more skilled Survivors in lower ranks with Baby Killers.
---
I don't think that meta perks should be the only way to play the game, and it's true that you can have a perkless game and still pip, however, that's not quite what I said. Non-meta perk builds often align with certain play-styles. It's not just that I can't play non-meta perks. It's that if I run totem hunting perks, my intention is probably to hunt totems. Except now I'm expected to spend my match arbitrarily harvesting certain types of points in order to pip, so spending the match being a good little totem cleanser will probably mean I depip. So while I can technically still run those perks and have a good game, I'm now just running unoptimized perks for the types of actions I'm expected to perform. I don't have a problem with being a lower rank as a result -I'd rather play the way I want despite the rank system- but that's still going to put me against unskilled Killers who I'll have the upper hand on in basic gameplay.
---
People can think I'm whining or being dramatic. I just want to see a rank system that's indicative of actual skill, mostly so we can stop having these lopsided match ups that ultimately hurt or completely deter new players. As I mentioned above, things that actually make a Survivor good aren't really reflected in the emblem system. Things that make Killer good are so nuanced I don't think the emblem system ever could accurately reflect skill level. The emblem system has always felt like a checklist rather than a proper measure of skill. It was meaningless before because you could pretty passively earn the points. Now they've just illuminated the inherent flaws in their system.
---
Ehhh DS was fine even with dribbling involved. Dribbling wasted some killer time and gave some time for a survivor to run over and body block so DS could pop
---
I wonder if they also see you like this.
---
Facts
---
Same thing sorta happened to me one time, but worse. Me and friend were playing Shelter Woods I believe? (The place with the big tree in the middle) against a Doctor who had the Doctor loadout (Unnerving, Overcharge and Distressing) and we didn't keep track of which gens we did (cuz we don't treat it like a competitive game) and the last 3 gens were all on one side of the map and just about parallel to each other. We couldn't do a damn thing cuz he wouldn't commit to a chase and every time we even got near a gen he'd just keep going to each one, one by one looking for us, so we gave up since he was basically taking the game hostage. :/
---
Yeah but you still haven't answered if your opinion is based one actual plays of people with completely different skills in DbD or it's just a conclusion from your own plays
---
Dude I almost did. The thing was this was almost late game and he hadn’t tiered up so I was already shook. I’m surprised I didn’t shit my pants when he dropped down. 
---
I will admit, she’s somewhat balanced but her bloody vomit is overpowered in my opinion. Hiding behind a wall or box wont guarantee your safety, getting caught in the middle of nowhere is punishing. 
---
Even as a survivor main I say no. Imagine being killer and finally getting someone to throw down the shack pallet after a 2 min chase only to see it come back 😭. I would cry. Managing pallets properly is one of the most important machanics as a survivor.
---
I have the whole video saved fyi . I didn't tbag once during the game, didn't flashlight him ONCE during the game . I found it in a chest, but thanks for assuming
---
My opinion is based on my own experience, streamers reactions and friends that play at both high and low level.  Still doesn’t make it right just going by what I’ve seen in the community.
---
You can cry and demand that your cancer perk get buffed but guess what? Even if they listen to your crying and take away the effect Enduring has, all I'll do is slug your pathetic piss-baby ass with Sloppy Butcher and wait that shit out so you still won't be able to use your cancer perk to get away for free. 
---
I mean, have you seen that part of that movie? 
---
Nah don’t wait a trolly amount. Nine times outta ten he is chasing one of us to the gate anyway and then I let him get another hit. Unless it’s Myers cuz screw that murder add on
---
LMAO, the sudden terror radius sound would have legit scared me too
---
his happened to a friend yesterday lol, he sent me pics and i laughed to much. whats happening xD
---
Scratched mirror? I feel bad for him uww
---
Ok thanks man
---
On PS4 we have a save game play option and it does the last 15 min of game play and then you can trim it and upload it to YouTube or twitter. Or grab your phone next time (hindsight is 20/20 lol) they just need evidence and you’ll need their username. Just for next time. 
---
Two of them have to be bought. Like I said, the entire selling point was the multiple killers aspect (like for fucks sake they're called the LEGION), yet not only does that have nothing to do with their gameplay, but you can't even play as them all. It's fucking ridiculous. Purely made for cosmetics, and it's blatantly obvious. 
---
Awful design, awful execution, awful gameplay. Just a shit DLC. 
---
Cant get the Adpets Jane / Plague.
---
I wish lol
---
The little ticks you get that eventually rank you to the next level.
---
Nope no scratched mirror. He was a baby Meyers 
---
So you're saying I should run both
---
The problem was never that it was too easy but rather meaningless, and their change is completely asinine.
---
It's like a teacher overhears they grade too easy -- it would probably take some time &amp; effort to rewrite their whole curriculum (emblems) so instead they just make an A 98-100, B 92-97, C 82-91, D is gone and now F is anything under 81.
---
Now the system still sucks but it's also impossible to pass the class. 
---
Instead what we wanted was weighted grading. Like we can all agree getting chased by the killer for a long time is pretty hard. A person who runs 5 gens shouldn't depip, because that emblem should be worth far more than the others. On the killer side getting a 4k should also be worth far more. 
---
Adepts for the plague and Jane are bugged rn. You need to get 4 kills, it doesnt matter if u get ruthless/brutal/even entity displeased
---
Hope not lol
---
Ah, a person of culture
---
It uses the old adept system which was getting 4 kills. Pips dont matter, the achievement is bugged
---
The i game chase music has to be a fair advantage for everyone, I’m guessing that’s why you can’t change it. The music I think that needs to go is the dying state music. There is no reason I feel the need to mute my tv when I’m in the dying state. There’s nothing I can do except heal up and hope someone comes to get me or not get found by the killer. 
---
you dont have to, the achievement (for adept plague and jane) are bugged
---
Even with the patch changing totems they still get broken within the first 30 seconds, NOED has a feasible counter people refuse to do it. It's not crybaby killers especially when you make a statement this bold and never played killer. 
---

---
Everyone has a type. You're not meant to understand another person's preferences, which is why they are their preferences and not yours.
---
I suspect this was sarcasm at the new ranking system. 
---
We're all guilty of getting sucked into reddit and exaggerating our point! (:
---
Did everyone get out ?
---
I played a nurse game and i got rank 17 survivors as a rank 2
---
I do it because legion bad
---
Second
---
I’m confused I keep seeing people say there’s no difference between rank 1 and lower ranks. 
---
shes actually very fun (at least for me) because it adds a secondary objective that rewards both parties (corrupt puke and instaheals) for wasting time on them. It adds a lot to the game
---
That’s just wrong. I just got the achievement what must have been an hour ago at this point. Lots of 4ks, but didn’t get it until I earned a merciless. 
---
Flair checks out 
---
Agreed, i usually just dc after someone has or just kill myself
---
Its about as crutch as DS, so prob. Then again you have to save to activate it so maybe its already balanced.
---
This map is so massive, I'm finding it really painful as hag. Gens are so far from one another that setting up a web that covers loops around at least 3 gens is painful.
---
Did this the other day to someone, felt good.
---
Evil Dead Scene *Shudder*
---
From what I've experienced there's fuck-all you can do to shake off a chase so as survivor all you can do is loop them as long as possible and hope someone finishes a gen before you are hooked. Then you get unhooked and involuntarily sandbag your teammate jessa lilbit
---
New matchmaking system is busted is the answer. It's just grabbing people at random and throwing them into lobbies 
---
No one ever comments on my prof. They just tell me to commit neck rope in the after game chat... I want comments dammit! Lmao
---
The truth that no one is talking about. Luckily, the Plague is an amazon and can puke over most loops.

bro i just carried my game running the killer for the 4 gens and he tunneled and camped and i depipped; how do u explain this 
---
If that happens then can killers repair hex totems and regain their bonuses? 
---
I think it would be a better idea if pallets would break after a certain amount of uses. Similarly to windows being blocked after 3 vaults a pallet should break "due to damage from overuse".
---
If and only if that is implemented I could see the possibility of a perk (or just a game mechanic) which allows pallets to be repaired.

I have both adept Jane and Plague. Janes I got yesterday. Plague’s I got a little over an hour ago. You need to double pip. I got many 4ks and didn’t get the achievement, but the minute I double pipped (which is a merciless victory) I did. 
---
“In a public match, achieve a merciless victory with The Plague using only their 3 unique perks.”
---
That’s the achievement description. If you’re telling me that it’s wrong, you can take that up with the devs, but doing what the achievement says to do (achieve a merciless victory) has worked for everyone I’ve talked to so far.
---
she ded
---
Be happy it's not a 1v1
---
Not "toxic" at all. Those survivors could have 100% prevented this by running down stairs and forcing Plague to go down there to get them or jump in lockers so she only gets 1 survivor. 
---
now THIS is THICC

Ha, no worries. gg

First? You must not be playing much
---
I think there are 6.
---
Honestly I’m ok with it 
---
I think double piping should be kept the same as it is now but the standard to 1 pip just be lowered just a tad like 1 or 2 points.
---
This is actually a different issue I have seen even in the last system too. If you only get chased or only do gens, it doesn't like that. It wants you to do a range of things to fill all 4 categories for a pip. It sucks and I think that is an issue that needs to be addressed but probably won't be. Btw what rank are you at now?
---
Got the achievements, then never cared for it since, cant play enough as is to keep up both sides on rank 1
---
the way i see it is that if its harder to pip more people will de rank above 15 at the reset letting to lower ranks be populated by the people who actually invest time into the game and are good enough to pip constantly. This would make red ranks way more intense and try hard. 
---
WELL... ENJOY YOUR NEW SPACE HEATER.
---
Definitely for killer, but for survivor though? 
---
I haven't missed anything. You've missed mine. The perk *does* work. Unfortunately for the survivor, Enduring also works against the stun. Like I said, it's working as it should be.
---
I feel embarrassed to say I looked at this for about 20s without seeing that ~~claudette~~ pig.
---
Hag plays pretty uniquely and so she doesn't really use standard perks, so I think a lot of the advice here is off. BBQ isn't really good on her imo because Hag is about setting your traps and letting the survivors come to you largely, you generally shouldn't be traipsing across the map to chase a BBQ proc. I also don't like totems because I don't think she's particularly good at defending them, but Ruin does buy you time to set up at the start of a match at least.
---
Monitor is great because you're tiny with a small terror radius, and not only does it let you get the drop on survivors but it also lets you set up traps relatively near them while remaining undetected.
---
Make Your Choice is great because somehow people still forget to croucb
---
I can't say I like this system but literally anything is better than emblems and current amount of pips needed..
---
I won’t say that is fair of bad, I’m just gonna say that I do not play survivor so my opinion is invalid. But from my perspective it’s fine (obviously bias) 
---
It technically does fit with the recently leaked survivor...
---
I can only imagine the Mori though OwO
---
The sad thing is, I’m not going to surprised in the least when this becomes reality and it can only be used once. Hell I wouldn’t be shocked if this is a test run disguised as a bug! Adrenaline will be nerfed next, then BT. Calling it now lol.
---
You get auto purge if they are all cleansed which is why I don't bother going for purge until late game or end game
---
To get the adept achievement you need:
---
To get a merciless victory (double pip)
---
Using ONLY that killers unique perks (you can still use addons and offerings)
---
sleepy boy more like ugly boy
---
His arms are LOGS
---
did NOT know that im deleting this BUT reddit is frustrating me bc its like tumblr where its impossible to do anything right i wanna quit
---
While Legion was such a failure, I wouldn't call their DLC shit simply because the DLC also has Jeff and his perks. Distortion works great as a stealth perk throughout the first half of the game or even longer, Aftercare is the strongest aura-reading perk at the endgame, and Breakdown tells the user where not to go after getting unhooked, since it's not all too uncommon running into the Killer after an unhook. Put all those Perks together into the most metal dude in the game and you've got yourself a case where the survivor is far better than a killer from the same DLC pack.
---
It's a joke not a judgement, relax. 
---
Yeah I don’t have the dlc myself, but from what I’ve seen of Blood Warden it has a niche but when it works, you’ll be very glad to have it. Similar to adrenaline on the survivor side
---
i was rank 1 but now rank 5, im trying to figure out how to adjust my playstyle and perks to the new killer meta that prevents taking hits + pip changes; fyi ive survived/carried 80% of my games 
---
Gottem
---
By major glitch, I mean a glitch where I can't even play the game at that point. I do play more killer than survivor, so you are partly right.
---
You forgot your "Shitpost" Flair mate.
---
I had a similar match. Played against 4 people, I had an ebony mori equipped and every time I downed someone for a second time, they just DC'd wich is funny since I don't mori survivors untill they are on death hook, they always DC'd before I could pick them up. Since they DC'd, the last guy got a free hatch. He however decided to make a lot of noise, wanting to move on to the next game asap, I walked over and got tbagged. They runned to the hatch, jumped and right as their fingers werw about to dissapear in the void, I managed to grab em. Was the most satisfying hatch grab I ever had. In end chat they were all making fun of me since I couldn't mori them. Next game, I run into 3 survivors from the previous game, this time I didn't use a mori. I managed to kill the 3 people from last game without camping or tunneling, downed the last guy and gave them the hatch
---
Lol no I actually didn’t know they were called pips lol
---
I still don't get it how it works
---
The PTB wasn't worth it, clearly, as the game is more broken after it than before it. 
---
Is it anymore punishing then getting caught in the middle of nowhere against a Huntress, Billy, or Leatherface? Being caught in the middle of nowhere against a lot of killers is basically an easy down. 
---
Dbd is so broken and full of bugs nowadays that I find it so hard to enjoy.
---
Thank you that's what I was trying to find out. It's popped up 4 blood webs in a row now and I really don't want it, but the Entity wants me to take it I guess.
---
Tried quoting who? Cause none of that's in your post and again refer back to what o said theres direct counters to ruin and NOED. Decisive didn't have a counter. Killing 2 people is okay but not good enough to right out a huge post trying to make killers sound more op than they are. 
---
THIS NEW FUCKING RANK SYSTEM. 
---
4K WITH PIG AND GOOD AMOUNT OF BP? +0
---
4 ESCAPE AND ONLY A 3 HOOKS WITH MYERS? -1
---
WHAT? THE FUCK? CANT GO UP APPARENTLY, CAN ONLY GO DOWN. 
---
In the rare occasion that I play survivor, i do the same and as a killer main, I thank you. I hate it when they stay and then leave right before I can hit them
---
ruin and NOED are both hex perks that can get countered. DS had no counterplay and now it does after the fix. Back then there was ti many loops and double pallets making surviving not that hard. The survivors had control of the game. Now its more balanced and they are still working on it. Maybe your just an angry survivor main.
---
If they are SWF you're potentially fucked though
---
I know what the points go to, but snapping out of it from the doctor used to be considered an altruistic action even though you got survival points for it.
---
Only have to be sick on a survivor once and they will become broken eventually after a short time limit giving you a 1 hit down opportunity.
---
You can prevent fountain cleansing by not taking the buff, every survivor will become broken and giving you a 1 hit down.
---
Devs have promised a freddy rework too... and look where we are now. We’ll get it mid chapter patch if we’re lucky. I bet they arent going to touch legion at all. Just hope the switch release/ded servers/evil dead DLC distract everyone from the cash grab that was legion
---
Well done devs you are absolute trash. 
---
Only 2 rules must be followed. 
---
1. Use your 3 personal perks for that killer. Not allowed to take a fourth one.
---
2. No one escapes. They can dc mid game but none can escape by hatch or gate.
---
You can use any add-ons or offerings to make the game easier tho.
---
I can't even get to rank 1 pepehands
---
I really hope that the dedicated servers have aome sort of consequence for disconnecting. That or make Legion actually not be annoying.
---
THE NEW MATCHING SYSTEM IS SO SHIT. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE LESS THEN A MINUTE OF WAIT TIME BEFORE JUMPING IN A LOBBY. NOW I HAVE 3 MINS MINIMUM, 17 MINUTES IS THE MAX IVE SEEN. FUCK THAT.
---
Myer’s is one of the most balanced and well made killers in this game. You actually have to work to get your ability and your power varies greatly based on what tier you are.
---
Is this a apex joke or a DBD thing? Haven't played in a while 
---
Didn't he yoinked it from Monto? Tsk-tsk-tsk. 
---
hes pretty fun if you use him. I find him more fun to use than half the killers in the roster. If you like playing killers then hes worth a buy. Against him best bet is to hide as soon as you hear his terror radius, hes really good in chases and its better to not engage him like that. Honestly i use 
---
What con are you going to attend?
---
Me as Myers and a friend as Legion are going to be at Weekend of Hell in April. 
---
I'm not sure why it was considered an altruistic action but it wasn't bugged. It was designed that way from when Doctor was released to between Spirit and Legion being released, they made a note in one of the patches saying snapping out of it was no longer considered altruistic, because they were implementing deep wounds, so Botany and Nurse's no longer effected it. It just seems weird that since you're actually getting healed from this action that it's not considered altruistic.
---
&gt;reck
---
For me its the other way around:
---
Survivor main tries killer.
---
Now totally gets tunneling and camping.
---
Still think its BS, but now understands it.
---
Them's fighting words
---
Alright, this gen is done, oh hello fellow survivor- OH SHIT IT’S THE PIG
---
&gt;It's just that people on reddit literally have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to game balance because they're the types of players who choose left on T+L walls and still crouch behind rubbish tiles.
---
Im almost certain that theres a 90% chance the killers who do this or dont try any mindgames and then use NOED to barely secure a kill are on this subreddit
---
That would be so amazing,a game mode in a special map where everything is very dark except for some lights and the gen lights/exit door lights.
---
True, I understand the frustration with playing against a team though, but I never queue dodge unless they are way higher ranks than me, cause quite frankly... I don't want to be abused by 4 assholes when I barely know wtf I'm doing.
---
I stay every other time... The matchmaking is absolute garbage though. Worst in any game I've ever played. Rank 15-20s going against rank 1-5s is dumb as shit.
---
People just complain that they get killed in a game about getting killed.
---
Crypt tv fan i see glad to not be the only one 
---
Oh wow, I feel your pain 😢. I've been trying to get it on my Freddy and Spirit with no luck.
---
Why do you have Guy Bushy Brows from Naruto? Is Quentin’s really that big? 
---
I usually say gg and leave right away, as a survivor it tilts me on another level that’s I can’t say anything to the facecamping bubba i just encountered. Remember, you control if they talk or not in the post-chat
---
you forgot the part where they offer payment for the new content. 
---
Excuse me sir, but you meant her sparkling monument of a personality?
---
Of course, of course, her small, round, soft *personality*...
---
A lot of people find the mend action tedious as a survivor, also I've seen people who dislike that they can vault pallets and windows. Legion is also one of the harder killers to play, at least in my opinion, because they are pretty weak. So they tend to get hate on both ends.
---
I personally do not mind them, but every time I play as Legion I get tons of D/C's. So I just play someone else because it kind of ruins the game for me.
---
Nothing but respect for my season 11 winner
---
Use a flashlight and remove this please 
---
A thicc meme.
---
When the new survivor is more thicc than you so you gotta show them what's up
---
Okay, can someone start going to all the vomit-fetishist forums on the internet and letting them know about this chapter? I feel like we'd get a few hundred new players, followed by /r/deadbydaylight getting *really* weird about a month later.
---
This is amazing I need DMX as a survivor/killer, must be fully voiced and unique depending on the killer he's facing or survivor he's chasing. At least a few barks.
---
Thank you good sir. After thorough exploration, I’ve wandered into r/straightgirlsplaying (nsfw) and then r/canthold (also nsfw)

Kudos to the guy that stayed... Unless he died first... idk
---
As a freddy main I can feel this pain

No because they'd be survivor and the killer would be their friend in kill your friends..
---
😂 I watched it right after 
---
This is fucking gold op
---
Thank you for that clown input. I'll test it soon. 
---
This person said it way better lol listen to them
---
This more often than not the games we do the worst in are the ones we pip because we've done an all round of everything, this is especially bad in premades when for example I've been playing the longest so i run the killer around for as long as i can while my friends do gens so if it works completely to plan you'll find we'll barely pip or just neutral then compare to games where you are memeing and sandbagging eachother and you'll probably almost double :/
---
It’s plain bad for killers with instant downs like Hillbilly and Myers too, since chases get ended in half the time and you get less points for hitting survivors.
---
Omg, I did not expect that hahaha
---
Cleansing yourself while getting downed by plague makes it so the plague can’t pick them up.
---
v sad about this one
---
Thank you u/Dunesterr, very cool. :)
---
She shouldnt have had to lipsync for that dress alone.

Oh nice. An excellent decision.

I read "stares the shit out of me" for some reasons... Probably because we're talking about stalky boi in person I don't know...
---
Hah gaaaaaayy
---
We have no clue, but yes it has been in the making since I believe November of last year. If you browse the summaries of the dev streams it should be mentioned in there. Hopefully we should receive it sometime this year.
---
Its not any different than Billy, LF, and Myers. She's just another killer that has really strong basement plays and you should be very careful not to get caught down there against her.
---
That's some Baba Yaga shit right there.
---
Not pictured: the staring contest I had with him at the gate
---
I think that policy works well here. Fighting fire with fire. If you play fair, i'll play fair.
---
This is true. I guess what I want is for them to fix certain machanics that have always been an issue, but also make sure it's difficult. Rank reset is a bit silly.
---
*Visibly shook*
---
Ok. And no news about Legion being changed? I just want to play my favorite designed killers. Favorite designed meaning I like the way they look. I just recently finished getting the Susie outfit with Shards.
---
Do you mean with spirit? Yeah is a known issue that you hear the glass noise 
---
I think it's a step in the right direction, but maybe a misguided one. The problem with the Emblem system is it fails to stratify players based on meaningful reflection of their skill level. Before the player base pooled at Red, now they'll pool at Purple and Green. Which is somewhat good because ideally the majority of a player base should fall in the middle. But since the Emblem system doesn't do a strong enough job measuring skill level, we'll still have poor match making, which was why rank "didn't mean anything" before.
---
I do want ranking up to be more difficult though. I just wish the way that was implemented would be more nuanced, since this change did little to solve any of the problems.
---
I'd rather my friends and myself stay at 15 than play sweaty in a system that doesn't reward higher ranks.
---
maybe its people like you that make the game harder for everyone else, and ruin the game.
---
theres 1 killer, 4 survivors; which means it takes 4 survivors to fucking start a game. if we all quit what do you thinks gonna happen
---
instead of being like oh you're just mad, how about saying something constructive? how about camping your totems? the last couple of games ive had nurses proxying their ruin and she got a 3k in the first 3mins. 
---
explain that. 
---
ive seen the nerfs, from a survivor perspective, but let me tell you from the killer perspective. you have a counterplay to survivors doing your totems, you fucking go to them.
---
how is it fair to the survivor to always be the one losing something after each patch? like less pallets, sucks but i whatever. and i only bought dstrike in the shrine last week. so literally 750/800 hrs of survivor i played was WITHOUT dstrike
---
why am i portrayed as someone whos just mad and doesnt know what hes talking about
---
who are you to be so condescending?
---
Got a link to the original video?
---
And then maybe crossplay :D
---
No, it’s like a huntress standing at the beginning of stair case and throwing hatchets. Why would you stand in front of her like that 
---
How can you see their rank? (Asking for a friend) ha
---
A silent/invisible killer is a rogue? Come on. 
---
The eyebrows admittedly need a bit of work, but I'm also kind of doing a mixture of DBD Quentin and film Quentin, and film Quentin has somewhat big eyebrows :L
---
Because DBD runs on a peer to peer system, it won't keep you in a SWF's after a game until they add Dedicated Servers.
---
No, legion is a bad killer and almost every game 3 sutvivors escape. He's like freddy, a bad killer and unfun to play against. 
---
Why ask about my oppinion if you're just going to say i'm bad?
---
???? you're the counter to ruin and noed lmao are you kidding me go camp your totems and get free kills
---
Body blocking is not bannable unless it's taking the game hostage. If it were against the rules, they wouldn't have made collision in the first play rofl. Survivors can body block the killer too in certain cases that can be very beneficial as well.
---
&gt;U need long games for a double pip and u are most likely not going to get that going against survivors that just do genis while having perks like that
---
AFAIK, survivors also get punished for trying to genrush, they don't receive as many points (and thus pips) as they did before. This is trying to slow the game down (justalottabit).
---
And legion is a monk?? Implying some religious purity? Legion is the opposite. 
---
a simple fix would be to match People that "were" on a certain rank only with other People who were on a similar rank in the last season
---
Nah, I just saw everyone calling it "The Wood" so I figured I get specific.
---
Lol be happy of that, i got the same comments over and over again from a person stalking my profile after a bad game xD
---
Legion should be a berserker
---
*Laughs in Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, and other miscellaneous "crutch" perks.*
---
Isn't the adept just for getting 4 sacrifices?
---
Literally every killer can block the basement and has been like this since day 1 of beta DBD lol. The basement is dangerous, dont get caught down there, especially all fucking 4 survivors at once somehow.
---
I can, if You can describe be at least her pose, but now I have no idea
---
Her eyeshadow also slightly changes too lmao 
---
Oof
---
Just suck that a killer with enduring completely negate the perk, like at all. Outside of that, great change.
---
Have you played Rogues in literally anything?
---
r/unexpectedouija 
---
Nurse with no addons or perks is twice as good with spirit with a full build. This isn't an opinion, you are wrong with your placement. 
---
Unless the servers are only in the US or they go down minutes after they get released
---
Well you "could play", it just wouldn't be any fun. Same thing happened to me yesterday
---
Sounds like lines from H. Ag or S. Hape or maybe H. Illbilly or N. ightmare
---
I mean, you must be playing like a toxic PoS because I don't get DCs.
---
Careful that tree will really ffff.... never mind you get it. 
---
Well to be fair "altruism" by definition means, helping/caring about other people. Same reason self care gives survival points too
---
It’s harder, which I love. Getting a pip isn’t a sign of a good match- it’s the sign of going above and beyond. Stomping a weak team should be a safety pip- which it is now. 
---
The people complaining should never have been as high up as they were. It’s GOOD for there to be a challenge and for not everyone to make it to red ranks.
---
Does anyone know if this circle means anything? 
---
Hello there
---
Man, I almost never get d/cs when I play Legion, and I played Legion from rank 20, all the way up to the red ranks.
---
When the match ends it tells you next to their name
---
Play legion well???? only thing you do well is mediocrity. You're a serial underachiever. Go on /lifereddit and post about dressing your self in the morning.
---
I love how he is all torn up and bleeding in the first one and he is all like "eh, whatever"
---
I have not edited her at all no. Just the Skyrim stuff.
---
Where is this art from?
---
Guess I triggered some cheaty SWFs..
---
I’m not bragging, you claimed the legion is annoying, I’m saying I’m not a toxic killer. You’re clearly a toxic survivor if your commending people for quitting the game to avoid defeat 
---
For me, it's because Legion can exploit the chase mechanic and moonwalk/look down while still chasing the survivor. In regards to his mending mechanic, this means that the mending timer will go down and the survivor can literally do nothing about going down at that point.
---
Agreed, but maybe i'm just biased toward this system and I want them to try to make it work instead of making a new (perhaps better) one
---
I dont blame them, no offense 
---
It’s crazy 
---
Disagree- only doing one category means you did not have a good game, no matter how good you did at one aspect. Just doing gens shouldn’t grant a pip- likewise, just running in circles shouldn’t.
---
with the three unique perks
---
Yeah...yeah, on second thought, this is nothing.
---
more fit than a pole dancer which i am? 
---
but anyhow, you seem to also have a PhD in Psychology since you make such assumption. cause i happen to have major in Philosophy and a year of actual psychology studies that is how i make assumptions based on trigger words and phrases you used aka "you jealous" and similar nonsense. only one type of people uses these. 
---
you also seem to be delusional of how actually superficial and hypocritical you are since your very first message and you being the one to go personal with me when all i was saying that i dislike such figures and that they are in fact literally not objectively attractive according to math while Adiris has these beautiful perfect proportions. it's like music. you can dislike great symphonies but you can't deny they're harmonically perfect. and you can like shit cheap pop music but thinking it's in any way good is insane. and from very start i said that you can like it but it's not proportional or healthy. 
---
you keep on saying that i'm disgusting when all you know is my posts here. do you think it makes you look good? maybe to idiots. any person with a brain, not many of those unfortunate, would point out that you're bit stupid and overprotective. 
---
We are gonna live forever 
---
Cuz blood points 
---
Spine chill does NOT increase vault speed. Only repair, heal and sabotage. Enough said
---
Dont listen to people saying bring a mori. You have to get at least 3 sacrifices for it to work so you can do it with a green mori, but I would only use it on someone on their final hook. Do not mori anyone on second hook or more than 1 person. 
---
Uh huh. Camp totems so survivors can do gens without being pressured? Sorry but you should probably get better as a survivor 
---
Don't know in the context of the game, but irl typically salt circles are supposed to keep out/trap supernatural entities like ghosts or demons. Maybe its supposed to be something to do with the religious focus of the map?
---
3.14 (r*r)
---
MAYBE A BIT LATE
---
BUT THE FACT THAT ALL ADEPT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE STILL BUGGED MAKES ME TILT SO HARD
---
Someone draw that T-rapper
---
Is she crawling on her fours?
---
??? 
---
If all the killers quit (which we slowly are) who you gonna get to play killer? 
---
Right of course, I just meant I thought it wasn't related to pipping necessarily?
---
I have played 2 matches after coming back now and been on the reddit a lot today because am home sick and I have learned how bad ds is now 
---
Not sure if its related to the new map or Plague’s perks, but me and a buddy brought in toolboxes for Temple and they couldn’t be used on gens. Just hooks. Using it on a gen just popped you over to a different side of the gen.
---
Yeah that's my point. All you can do is run. There's no getting out of a chase when you're in a chase with her. Like the Doctor.

If you are having such a problem being slugged on the ground for 60 seconds then why not just fuckin' run unbreakable, something that lets you pick yourself up from dying state.  There is a counter to the counter, if it annoys you that bade just use a perk slot for it.  Or hell don't even run DS and just run unbreakable that way if they assume you had it you just get a free self rez.
---
Yeah, I believe it. The amount of people that think d/cing against a specific killer is crazy, too. If that was acceptable behavior, I'd just d/c every time I heard a chainsaw.
---
How do you have enough moris??? I swear I see a TTV every single game 
---
Yeah, I've been playing a while so I often see a lot of the same people. At least on PS4. 
---
I rarely play killer and when I do I suck, but I've bumped into at least 3 different high rank SWF groups a whole bunch of times.
---
I've just remembered some of their names I guess. All of them are toxic, they are the main reason I disabled messages from randoms - so no more nice messages from randoms either. Ah well.
---
I'm sorry am I missing something. At rank 1 you're fighting to keep rank 1, not rank up more, I see literally no problem with this. All you need to do is safety pip.
---
its from sponge bob
---
I always wondered if it would keep you safe from the killer but haven't been brave enough to try it. 
---
I don't think Legion will ever be changed, at least in the near future. While changes were considered in the PTB last time they were removed due to the devs feeling they were to overwhelming. Which does make sense. Honestly however Legion needs a ton of work to be fun to play and to play against. 
---
They just feel like a fly buzzing against your ear when playing against them with a full team if someone doesn't dc. Playing Legion as well feels like a boring chore most of the time as well. It feels like a very basic killer with little in the way of interesting gameplay. At least with Freddy there is really unique ability that he holds and the enjoyment of winning a game with a weaker killer.
---
Agreed. Just a nice way to end the game.
---
Im glad someone agrees, it’s ridiculous how much this community resorts to dc and deranking. Why make the game worthless that way? 
---
I’ve said this many times now but it’s not just for rank 1, it’s all red rank.
---
Well now I feel stupid..lol 
---
r/wooosh
---
I'm sorry, what's loss? I'm confused.
---
I feel like DbD is more blurry on PS4 Pro now yet FPS are smoother
---
There are some tricks to getting them adepts easy.
---
1. Rank reset. Wait a week or two after each reset to play killer, so all the good players have ranked up and thus taken out of the equation.
---
2. Wait for 2x bloodpoints weekends. Survivors are less prone to genrush (thus opening themselves up for 4ks) when they get more points each match.
---
3. Don't play killer for a few months, so you can derank to rank 20-19. Beating beginners should let you get your Adepts easily.
---
4. Try getting the adepts during a free weekend. Free players can no tricks.
---
It’s woooosh with four o’s r/woooosh. If your going to insult me do it properly.
---
I don't really think NOED is toxic I just wish it didn't have to give the killer a speed boost. But even more then that I wish it wasn't used as much.
---
And here I am going, “what is this a wrestling ring?”
---
I have like 10+ Ebony’s on MOST of my killers. I always grab them when they’re in the web lol.
---
Getting a 4k definitely should be worth more, I was trying to get adept shape and didn't just because someone killed themselves on hook so I didn't end up with enough points. 
---
Totally agree. I play PC with a wired connection and 2/10 games are green. Most are yellow ping. Some are red. It’s awful. 
---
This is the content I come here for.
---
" Hnngh. Entity, I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my asscheeks keep alerting the Plague. "
---
As it should be, red ranks shouldn't be a cakewalk to get through. This entire system encourages chases, running from the killer, extending games, it encourages the things that make the game fun. 
---
Oh, hi... You must really be close to reaching EW3 now, eh? *vaults*
---
People are so used to being rank 1 in this game because you could play like complete ass and still rank up. What other game with a ranking system is like that? I dont go into LoL and expect to be the best rank with no effort, I can't be grandmaster in Hearthstone or Overwatch without being really good at the game, I can't get 3k arena rating in WoW or someshit with no effort. Rankings should be hard and a LOOOOOT of people that were rank 1 before absolutely did not have the skills to deserve it. 
---
I hope Behavious doesn't back down because of all the whiners, because finally ranks are actually hard and that's how it should be. The only thing they need to do now is make the reset much less frequent. Monthly was too fast in the first place.
---
Until you get hit with d-strike 3 minutes after an unhook due to bug 
---
&gt;If you have enough time to teabag behind pallets and flick flashlights you have enough time to peep for totems.
---
Classic reddit killer mentality, its just sad at this point. I feel bad for you
---
Always on the edge to go infinite EW3. 
---
how can they do gens if you got survivors around your totem? and then you got one by the hook?
---
PC or console?
---
As far as I can remember it was like that a long time ago. U killed everyone and got merciless. But now u need emblem points for merciless. 
---
I tried killing everyone and I did it with the 3 perks but didn't get the achievement. 
---
PC
---
I get your point, but the skill checks give you altruism points because at the base of the game, healing is considered an altruistic action. I guess what I meant to say was that if you're infected and injured and you cleanse, you get healed up. So shouldn't the perks that effect healing also proc for this action? Like snapping out of it, waking up, mending yourself, and searching through jigsaw boxes don't actually heal you, but cleansing yourself while injured does.
---
Tbh it’s very discouraging and unfun for me. No matter what I do I barely even get a safety pip. It’s always been nice to see that rank 1 badge every time I finish the match, but now it’s just... upsetting :( 
---
i play killer. ill play killer. lmao 
---
Lmao yiiiikes my guy
---
Ah yes i do - [Here!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=naDfHKOZX6A) 
---
That's gay
---
There's also an official forum that the devs look at, fyi.
---
That's literally what a Rouge class is.
---
I'm pretty sure most survivors are thinking in their minds "If I escape, I win" not "If I spend X amount of time in a chase, do this many gens, this many hook rescues then I will pip and thus win, after I do these things I can die happily".
---
Just like for killers, most aren't thinking of emblems but rather "I have to kill at least 3 survivors to consider this a win".  What most people see as a victory or doing well has almost nothing to do with the emblem system.
---
With no addons she suffers hard imo. Still good but I think it hurts her enough to no be on the same level as consistent killers like huntress and billy.
---
I'm not arguing against gen rushing, I'm saying that now killer adept achievements seem overly hard to get because of how hard it is to get a merciless victory. 
---
Even more so if you compare them with the survivor adept achievements. 
---
So true. 
---
i think its two pip with the 3 unique perks 
---
I desperately want ranking up to be harder, but all they did this patch was inflate the pip threshold. This does nothing to more accurately reflect player skill level.
---
The problem with the Emblem system was that it failed to accurately stratify players based on skill. It failed to reflect actual skill in a meaningful way. Inflating the numbers did nothing to fix that problem. The system still fails to measure skill and still fails to match players based on skill, only now instead of pooling the player base at Red, it's pooling them at Purple and Green. 
---
The emphasis on harvesting arbitrary points to meet a threshold discourages variety of play-style and rewards toxic behavior. It puts power into the hands of other players to intentionally tank your score. We all know how toxic this community is- Survivors will happily sandbag their teammates to get them to depip, Killers will camp, even if it means losing, if it guarantees the player they didn't like depips.
---
And the real fallout here is that new players, especially Killers, get punished.  A Survivor may have pipped down because of bad matches (getting tunneled, sandbagged, and camped will earn you a depip) or because they have a play-style that doesn't earn them as many emblem points (gen jockeying, only running the killer while other players do gens, or actually doing dull totems which net you no emblem points.) These Survivors nonetheless may know the major loops on every map, how to pallet loop, how to mind game- all things which are actually a reflection of their skill level in the game that aren't calculated by the emblem system. Net result means there are now more skilled Survivors in lower ranks with Baby Killers. 
---
So to act like this is just the player base being unsatisfied is a bit dishonest. We want the rank to mean something. Just because they made it "harder" by inflating the numbers doesn't mean they made it better at placing people on a spectrum of skill level.
---
I used this example before, but this change made DBD "harder" the way some video games will have a "difficult" mode but the only change is that they have inflated the HP of the enemies. It's not actually more challenging, it doesn't demand greater strategy or introduce new hurdles, it just makes the game more of a slog.
---
I’m not going to read that wall of text but what caught my eye was how I am calling you disgusting and you are, do you not see what you’re typing? Yes I am personally attacking you when you’re being absolutely rude. Now just stop hating on others because you don’t like how your life turned out with apparently 2 degree but you’re a pole dancer.
---
past killers (legion and others) require only 4 kills. It might be different for the Plague
---
Maybe you aren’t a rank 1 player 
---
I’ve had someone spawn on my ruin, I just started the match, about 10 seconds later it was taken. 
---
Unless the killer has enduring. Then it’s completely useless. But i guess it forces the killer through 3 animations so that probably gives everyone else about 5 extra seconds
---
or Bard, because of the music addons.
---
oh really? can i get it please
---
i hope you don't say this like it's something wrong with that
---
also you can buy most characters with in-game IS
---
That's me every day I play this game as killer.  I want to uninstall after a session as unless I go maximum meta, or if I'm just trying to play a different killer where I don't have the usual game slowing perks on, then I just get absolutely trash canned and gen rushed before I can reasonably do anything.  SWF's just being the norm and not the exception certainly doesn't help at all, either.
---
Then I end up playing it again after a day or 2 and repeat the process.
---
You obviously haven't seen how many "NOED IS OP!!!" posts that are on here or how many posts complain about Legion, or Freddy, on and on and on. I'd wager to say that a good chunk of this reddit are survivor mains. 
---
"But NOED has a counter, so it's fair"
---
Then I still stand by the original point. You just need a merciless for adept plague. I’ve always needed a merciless for my adepts, at least I’m relatively sure I did, but if you say other killers didn’t need it, then I’ll trust it just because I have no way of testing that at present.
---
She has rusty shackels!
---
I think it can be a good way to use them sometimes. 
---
Yeah i agree, a majority of people on reddit are not high tier lol which worries me because plague is fine and there are people calling her OP, kind of dumb. And yeah killers need these buffs. I like what they have done as far as map changes and other things to kind of even the playing field. I think this game is getting closer and closer to being a balanced chance of winning for each side. I'm not sure if that's what you're saying. You say killers are "inherently op" i believe that killers SHOULD be inherently OP but they haven't been up until the last few patches. I'm not saying nerf survivors into the ground but in my opinion things are getting more and more balanced
---
You didn't use a mori right?
---
That's called bad survivors. Someone should always be doing gens
---
That's actually wrong. Survivor is the easier role because if all your teammates are monkeys, you get at least 2 gens done and find the hatch, which is a safe pip every game. Also, safety pips are a lot easier to reach with survivor than they are with killer.
---
Killer is harder because mistakes are punished a lot more than mistakes as a survivor. So as soon as survivors get somewhat decent, killer can be really frustrating.
---
I mean, I've juked a legion at a pallet before it was kinda funny. 
---
r/bonehurtingjuice 
---
A meme with style, my dear. Heck I’ll just say the plague has style too.
---
To be honest, I agree with you. Also unpopular opinion, I’m kind of glad they made it harder to pip. Don’t get me wrong, the emblems and ranks needs rework and such, but it makes you rethink how you play the game. Also, for a community that keep saying rank doesn’t matter — sure do complain a lot about not ranking up easily. 
---
Clearly troll shitpost
---
I want to see wholesome art where Plague and Nurse become Spirit's two moms.
---
Damn so that’s how you get the add on
---
People will always complain, I did see some people complaining about dedicated servers when it was announced.
---
It looks like she's Tree-posing to assert dominance.
---
It's originally a meme about miscarriage.
---
But the joke get over simplify so much that even "| || || |_" is just loss.
---
It become a basic pattern of everything.
---
The first panel contain one person, second panel contain 2 person one higher than another, third panel is two person at same height, and forth panel where one stand and other lie down.
---
For this image though, it almost not loss.
---
You are actually awarded more chase points for finishing chases quickly. Hitting a survivor gives 55 and finishing a chase in under 15 seconds gives 90 which is almost double. 
---
Yes, at any Rank. Trying to say that 2 Kills is a loss for the Killer is just Dumb
---
nurses would be too strong in general because of freddy and doctor and worst of all legion. Not even a point to mookwalking anymore. I think they need to rework the entire bloodpoint system. Maxing at 8000 in a category is bullshit. I'm great at taking killers on a chase. Ill have games where i max out my boldness halfway through the game and then be chased until i die or escape so i spent half the game getting 0 BP. I think it should max at 32k per game but you can get the points from any category. Like 18k in boldness and then the rest of the points spread out through other categories to a max of 32k
---
 A few are deranking because at rank 1 it’s no longer fun because everyone tryhards
---
The main issue is that if you want to save Shards / Cells by buying the full bundle you can't, because there are multiple versions of her default cosmetic that inflate the total price. If there was an option to buy the shirt and the pants for a reduced cost and skip the hair then I wouldn't complain, but if I want to get a discount I have to buy the hair. So I either buy the shirt + pants at full value or the full set and get an item I don't want.
---
Bad survivors, not a killer fault if people play like shit
---
I also agree with a lot of what you are saying, and also add that balance is being thrown off by swf.  I play 50% survivor and killer and notice coordination with coms play a pretty large part of the game now and us solo's are being punished the hardest. I dont really care about d strike or NOED, but when the balance shifts too much to one side, the solo players really feel it the most.  Swf can still negate and counter many perks and abilities through constant communicating where solos are just to be an eaiser target.  I don't think swf needs to be removed, but maybe it needs another bracket or ranking system to set it apart from solo play. 
---
&gt;ooking at reddit 
---
the game has 1 killer for ever 4 survivors; if the reddit reflected this proportion, you would have 25 killers per 100 survivors on this reddit. the fact that you think its half and half is proof that its disproportionate
---
This reminds me of that one comic
---
I think it's kinda stupid it's 100 AC ($1) or 1800 shards for super miniscule differences. It'd be better if they were brown rarity to be more justified.
---
But like. How? She doesn't really have detection, except for unreliable vomiting after a long ass time. You hide like literally any basic killer with her. Break line of sight, stop running so you no longer leave scratch marks, leave the area. 
---
Been rolled back a few times. Always got my bp back. 
---
Jane sounds like she's...*compromised* when she gets injured. It just makes her more memey.
---
why is that a real thing x)
---
To quote myself:
---
&gt;Rank didn't matter before. Now rank doesn't exist. :)
---
There's usually a hook there. I wonder if something happens if you sacrifice someone on that hook.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Me? i'm not saying anything about either side i was just making a joke lol it's impossible to know because not every one who plays this game uses this sub
---
This is pretty cool. It's like a class photo. 
---
The Hag hunches over in game tho so I feel like she's actually the shortest. 
---
You need to play more survivor if you really think it works like that at higher ranks
---
If any survivor ever just stands in that circle whilst I'm the killer, I can't touch them
---
Rank reset just happened. Some people are late to the game.
---
LOL LOL LOL.  Your logic is so flawed that it is hard to even know where to begin.
---
-You think the result of 1 Person playing 100 games is more meaningful than ALL results from TENS OF THOUSANDS of games. LOL.  
---
-Marth has Videos where he ranks up to Rank 1 as a Perkless Killer. By your logic that means Killer is OP BECUZ MARTH!!!!
---
-Marth in those experiments was using the Best Team In The Game that has won Multiple Tournaments.  Of Course the Best Player In The Game With The Best Team will crush anyone they play.  Marth also crushes people anytime he plays Killer.
---
*Your "evidence" is so laughable that it is hard to respond.  It would be like if someone was like "Killers are way too strong, I watched TRU and he almost always 3 Kills or 4 Kills."
---
It is embarrassing how much you do not understand Statistics and Math if you think 100 Matches from 1 Player are more meaningful that Tens of Thousands from Hundreds of Thousands of Players.
---
So cool just set it as my new wallpaper 
---
I would not be against it .. then again I don't Nurse and Plague would have chemistry
---
To be fair it's still really difficult at low ranks to pip. I mainly play Survivor and I'm only around rank 15 because I don't play that much. Since the patch, I've not even had a single pip in any match, regardless of how well it went. Under the old system I would have had a single pip for probably 3/4 of these matches and a couple of doubles.
---
Still working on how best to use her but a few simple tips,
---
\-I don't recommend puking them into broken unless you have them in a place where they can't move OR you have an effectiveness add on, other wise just puke on em once n smack em twice. If you're getting roasted in loops, puke on objects they're using so they will break faster
---
\-Practice aiming
---
\-Learn which loops are easier to land your vomit
---
\-Try to get everyone sick before you use corrupt because that's a minimum of 60 seconds where people won't be sick/getting sick
---
404
---
Well I guess you're right on that one.
---
The two of you have more problems than Legion with the shit you're spewing. Sounds like bad players making excuses.
---
Wow lmao thanks
---
this happened to me a few days ago for my first time ever trying killer at rank 20 after &gt;200 hours of survivor..
---
i ended up dc'ing and haven't touched killer since B| 
---
Just last night I had a match where a guy was looping me on the Myers map and it seems he didn't realize you can punch somebody over the fenced.  I've seen it in videos before and sure enough I took a swing and hit him on the other side of the fence.  I have never seen someone DC so fast, I swear he was mid backflip when he DC'd
---
I don't need to know your hours, I'm agreeing with you already.
---
This happened to me on The Game, except Micheal got a hit on me. Like his big body just landed on me within the first minute of the match. Loudest I've ever screamed in my life.
---
Stop?
---
Proxy Camp the last fountain and see if it works out. Just pick one and lock it down the best you can.
---
Just like McDonald’s ice cream machine
---
The plague after her first royalty check
---
I managed to get Adept Plague. I had to 4k AND get Merciless killer (aka get 2 pips)
---
I try to be the last survivor if I notice the trophy hunt and just let them knife me. 
---
I've been in that position for the trophy and cheap shit to ruin it is awful. 
---
Who?
---
\*Felt cute in this pic, might delete\*
---
Considering the probable alternatives when leveling up a new killer, PWYF is a hell of a lot better than something like Unnerving Presence 1 or Monstrous Shrine
---
I’m glad you feel the pain lol. There was the one time my friend and I were on a gen and she got scared. She crouches around a tree and at the same time she sees the Michael I hear breathing and I turn to see Mikey 5 feet away ready to touch my butt. I screamed so fucking loud, my heart rate rose to dangerous levels, and I yeeted over to a pallet and proceeded to stun him while hyperventilating. I was yelling at my friend for not saying anything and she was like “I was about to and you screamed!” 
---
Playing against Meyers is scary and I hate it. Considering that same friend will wish for a Meyers so I’ll get scared. 😑
---
On the other side of the coin, I've been gen rushed so hard by groups as of late that unless I do Sweat try hard builds and tactics the gens will keep popping instantly as I try to do anything on the map so unless I do said things then the game becomes borderline unplayable when I encounter said groups which is pretty much every other game.
---
It sucks for a solo survivor but, unless I do said builds I run a serious risk of a game just instantly finishing and being not even remotely fun for me since against groups by the end of the first chase several gens will pop.
---
Ah i see
---
you originally said there was no counterplay to ruin. if survivors arent doing gens or arent doing ruin, they're bad. you think gens are all right next to each other? how can they do gens when there's ruin? if you're there to camp ruin?  its a catch22, you're just low iq and probably low rank
---
Well, if you're getting face camped hard I don't think you would've pipped even under the old system. To the new systems credit, it does punish killers for face camping harder. It's almost impossible to pip if they face camp.
---
You're still gonna get those people that don't give a fuck and face camp but there's only so much that can be done about that I guess. In my own experience, I've ran into far less face campers than usual but that might just be a string of good luck for me. 
---
This isn't Friends by Daylight, bud. Act like a bitch, get smacked like a bitch.
---
Why are survivors so toxic in this game? 
---
oh no its mr x from RE2
---
Yeah I would’ve fucked this up by screaming then panic-sprinting the 2 centimeters to where you crouched to hide behind, left scratch marks and end up in a chase lmao 
---
What about Trapper, Wraith and Billy? :(
---
They do, but you suggested they shouldn't in which case they would remain injured.
---
Meyers and Bubba look uncomfortable taking this photo
---
I’m amazed that I didn’t panic in game bc normally I would have done a 360 and sprinted. 
---
For me I find red ranks way more chill, I can't wait to get past the shitfest that is purple ranks. It's the haven for survive with friends groups for some reason, I guess it's just commonly the average.

Your not allowed to have fun, or play what you have payed for (Legion)

not everyones 15 and hasnt gotten their ass kicked. ignore it most people r fine
---
ive played you before im freestyle1ttv
---
Well yeah I just meant the new system is so hard to pip and when you have those games where the killers a huge jerk you just lose all that little progress 
---
You know what... now that you mention it. I’d have actually done that lmfao
---
You did good. 
---
Lisa girl eating your organs, but still a skinny Legend!
---
Dark Mage hell yeah.
---
The whole "Meyers" is making me itch (it's Myers), but anyway this was the funniest clip I've seen in a while. Like, everything could go wrong if you panicked or were 1 second late.
---
I've been rank 1 on both roles already so yeah. 
---
Thank you. 😭😭. 
---
It honestly is better. Leaving should be optional. If I join, and you as the killer are sitting there with a red or high yellow ping, then why should I have to put up with you playing in McDonalds wifi?
---
You intentionally camp survivors.  Trash can bro....you did it for research?  Take that weak killer play back to rank 20 where you belong.
---
There’s always that one noob3 wannabe who can’t actually loop, you’re right 😂 
---
It gets full tryhard when the whole team’s actually good though
---
Can we find something in the middle? I like that it got a little harder, but uh... lol, this is a li'l too much. Love the camping penalty increasing to 16m. Also there are no rewards, still. Just throw a few BP/Shards our way, or maybe even allow us to select a few items/add-ons at the end of the season depending on rank.
---
Does simply getting a 4k not work anymore? I’ve gotten multiple Adept Killers even though I got Ruthless at the end. DCs and slugs still counted toward them for me. 
---
Dstrike is nerfed but mostly it's been moved to a more situational place. It's not a "get away from jail free" card anymore but a perk that is supposed to work against tunneling (they're not there yet, enduring works too well on it).
---
Everyone here agrees on the matchmaking system, you probably saw the bullshit on the thread of rank 2's and 15 meeting and all.
---
As a Killer main i think the dstrike change was good but overnerfed on the way, (i used to play that perk before but i gave up early on on that perk) they should have put the stun for 4-5s as before. And let enduring work on it or just don't make enduring work on that perk anymore.
---
You say we shouldn't cater to shit killers, but if those don't get a minimum of incentive towards being better and get too frustrated we end up losing killers for the survivors to play against (it goes the same way for shit survs btw).
---
I'm open to discussion if you disagree on one of my points feel free to tell me put forward arguments and all that good shit.
---
I 100% agree. Even if it’s just a day. I can’t believe so many people still do it since you already lose all your blood points and depip twice
---
Maybe 
---
No this is how it works if you get downed the timer still goes, killers have to ability to just slug you and conpletely make it worthless. Reasons i dont get why everyone was happy about this nerf to the perk lol
---
Oh my found the dumbass of the day. Heres your reward. YOU claim theres no counter and YOU say YOU cant do gens with ruin. I cant fathom how fucking stupid some people are. Seriously go read again and edit your comment so you dont look ignorant 
---
As a survivor, I'd be 1,000,000% okay with this.
---
I'd rank her as high tier B 
---
She's very good if the survivors are constantly drinking out of the fountains, but she becomes a little trivialized if the survivors don't. 
---
If you're a survivor, run resilience to abuse her no-mither effect.
---
I don't think noed is a problem. Gives me something else to do besides gens. Unless you're the legion that face camped me last night and had noed, then fuck you. 
---
Not the full thing but here you go https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5a5445adf0f20
---
This has been a great update honestly - massive console optimisation + infinitely better matchmaking + balanced and interesting killer and perks
---
Only minor complaint is that the map isn’t very innovative but overall it’s completely revived the game for me 
---
Oh yeah I misread nvm
---
" Cause none of that's in your post and again refer back to what o said theres direct counters to ruin and NOED. "
---
 low iq is low iq. if ur disputing that there are counters, then you're saying there are no counters.

At least they don't have **GOGGLE EYES**

[Toxic vs nice killers](https://i.redd.it/moo63pdcna1y.jpg)
---
Hey you asked my thoughts.
---
Except it isn't. The 3 second time is too short, and often survivors just go down again. Plus they can just wait out the time.
---
It’s not ranged and you can’t make it a ranged AOE attack like plague can. Try harder next time. 
---
Yeah I had a game like that the other day. Ruin spawned right in front of my buddy at the start of the game. And the cherry on top was at the end of the game, the killers noed spawned right in front me lol. Killer took it like a champ though, no salt in the post game chat. 
---
Games like that are rare for me though. I don't usually bother looking for ruin since it's better to just repair gens and push through it. 
---
The New Emblem System is Not Fair and Lacks Common Sense:  
---
\-The Fact that Killers are Supposed to try to Not Kill People Quickly is a Complete Theme Break, despite what he says
---
\-The Entire Point of a Rank System is to Separate people by skill level. If you keep destroying people and do not rank up then the purpose is defeated.
---
\-The requirements do not need to become more strict by rank since you are always facing higher Skill level opponents at those levels.
---
\-The Rank system should not force 1 particular playstyle  Having to literally compete for teammates for each precious unhook is really dumb.  You literally have to dive bomb hooks and beat your teammates there multiple times if you want a chance to Pip.  
---
\-Killers get screwed through no fault of their own if Survivors do not unhook a teammate. Survivors get screwed if a killer camps
---
Nothing happens.
---
:)
---
Direct counters. Direct counters. Holy fuck you are stupid
---
Thousands of hours later, we're all still here :)
---
Dude, I've been chased by the killer all game, escaped, and still not pipped, multiple times.  This system does not encourage anything that makes it more fun.
---
Of course people would cry about dedicated servers. It means they can't lagswitch anymore.
---
Unless you really want cosmetics or challenge yourself, go ahead and prestige. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend prestige. 
---
I can agree that some of her addons are OP, but her power bar being reset severely cripples her. Her power already has a 15 second cooldown at base before you can use it again, whereas Legion and Plague can use their power before their bar is fully reset. It makes her 110% movement speed even more punishing. 
---
It's too old and outdated in the current state of Dead by Daylight. 
---
If the killer is sitting on hatch best believe I am. Everyone complains about the hatch stand off because they dont want to take the time to do the actual counter for it. With a 25 % increase they can get done pretty quick if you're smart about it. Get each to 99 percent then pop them all at once not one at a time.
---
Well that killer would be quite the dumbass to still camp after the first gen popped
---
But it was the case even before the new matchmaking - there are simply not enough survivors for killers, so your comment about killers quitting is more than little exaggerating
---
Agreed.  Most of the people complaining are camping killers and immersed survivors.  None of you ever belonged at red rank to begin with.  Much prefer the new system. 
---
They could make it to where Survivors get Lightbringer when Killers lose Chaser for camping. Calculate your Lightbringer with "Generator Progress + X%" and "Killer Proximity + X%".
---
Shouldn't be that hard...right?
---
At least on the PS4 my friends and I used to wait 30 minutes to an hour to get into a lobby as survivors... now it's usually under 5 minutes for us to find a match. 
---
Two classes I’d never play (Samurai and Ninja) and one I almost always play (Cleric/Healer); interesting
---
At least Bubba knows you don’t carry pizza vertically!
---
My thoughts ***exactly***.
---
Sorry I'm Irish, It means phone! 
---
LOL, 4 Months is Outdated?? Since then there have only been more Survivor Nerfs and Killer Buffs. IF anything it is even more Killer biased then the data suggest.
---
Also, compare the Data from 4 Months ago to the Date from Dev Stream 86 1 year ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7t2omm/developer_stream_86_this_one_is_for_all_the/
---
**The fact that the Map Kill Rates Remain Nearly the same Strongly indicates the Data is still valid and does not change much over time
---
it was one of those 4 little hooded bastards over to the left! 
---
I spent my entire game mending and just couldn't complete my objectives!! *sobs*
---
I don’t get why everyone is bitching about the ranking system being hard when everyone wanted to be low rank.
---
Looks like he got the jump on you. 
---
Well are you really gonna run left behind for the rare situations where you're the last one alive? I agree do gens if they're camping but they'll probably get off once the first gen pops but either way you played the whole game with a waste perk slot because if the killer is camping you don't really need the 25% bonus
---
This is why I've always ignored points and rank and just played the way I want to
---
Again I had 0 issues even at rank 1 matchmaking is never terrible for killer except after the newest patch where it can take ages to find a match
---
This is me. Way more often than I like.
---
I recommend checking out his Nerd and Jock comics, they're pretty good.
---
Yeaaa i see what you mean but still legion is the worst of them because you can usually mend right after he hits you and goes after somebody else so you're usually pretty close to him
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
alright you toxic faggot fuck you
---
Is there any killer rank by power?
---
Now all you need to do is to not sleep for weeks and you will have the pefect cosplay
---
I don’t know what you’re going on about, getting caught in any situation is always punishing. Trying to dodge the Plague’s bloody vomit is nearly impossible unless there are barriers or walls in a perfect placement.
---
low iq trash
---
Oh so what you are saying is that you have to be gold or 1st place to rank up, so silvers (while 2nd place and bronze 3rd place reward you with BP but are not good enough for pips and ranks)
---
Where’s Mario ?
---
The distance is really piddly tho, with the slow down from the wind up it's practically the length of 2 lunges.  The huntress's hatchets are much more effective, even without the multi-hit
---
But that's not gonna change at all.  For the majority of people, if I say pip as a killer, 2 hooks on everyone, and they all escaped, it doesn't feel good at all it feels like a pity, or a pip from only 1 kill.  Even though yes, it's technically a win by the games rules, you will be fighting a mountain of a battle to convince people otherwise because it simply doesn't feel like a victory at all.
---
There is definetly pretty much zero reason to infect a Survivor unless you're putting them at max infection so they're Broken. I think the sickness should spread way more at lower levels of infection.
---
I like you calling out the comments before people can jump in. Thanks for posting.
---
Not wanting hairy werewolf huntress. What’s wrong with you op? ;)
---
cuz that would be too op blood points wise
---
Im confused, is that a joke?
---
I’m 90% sure the reason I’m so obsessed with David and Dwight is because of nerd and jock 
---
How the fuck is Legion and spirit so high and yet trapper is nearly last?
---
This is me when there’s no hex in effect and some bellend cleanses haunted ground which is the only hex perk the killer has
---
Rank 1 killer is the same as its always been. But red rank survivor is impossible. Especially because most killers tunnel and if they do that, everyone in the game will derank. 
---
Oh crap I think I played against you. I was a feng Min in a pastel skirt and her sweater with the blue pigtails that kept trying to juke you and failed lmao
---
Again you can track amount of ranting about killer's queue times increasing over last \~6 months and realise that your killers quitting statement is far from truth
---
No, I am trying to understand that you want to pip and level up with silver and below
---
Quality wholesome post
---
I should have warned you about crawling!
---
https://youtu.be/BasY65AOJ54
---
&gt;I just wish they would take a step back and really work on the core game without adding a "chapter". There's so much they could focus on and fix. Core gameplay mechanics to iron out, optimization, balancing, bugfixes. 
---
&gt;Fix the stuff you already have and then worry about adding chapters.
---
Rainbow 6 did this, it did make for a really boring summer. But the overall health of the game shot up dramatically. They fixed all of the things that really made me hate the game. I hope they consider this, some people will be upset but the people who stick around (and come back) will LOVE the game.
---
Yeahhh i mean he's harder to loop than other people but you can still run him for awhile. Like i said, there's a lot of things that make him annoying but i personally (my opinion) hate that's just a healing simulator. Mend n heal mend n heal. very annoying
---
not always the case
---
What about the pig :( the pig is my favorite 
---
H-A to the single G always be droppin and drippin those funky beats. Keep at it
---
 Bubba sad
---
They are deranking,  which is kind of bullshit. They'll stay in high ranks to get 4ks every single match,  and it's annoying. Once they can't anymore and get better surviors they depip to take advantage of the newer players that we are getting. I've noticed we have been getting a lot of them. 
---
if he would be looting the basement chest he would yell "PARTY DOWN IN HERE DOWN IN HERE"

And the balance department is a dead guy hanging from a tree !

...I completely forgot yellow map offerings existed. I still have brown ones on my Trapper, Hillbilly and Nurse lol.
---
Look, I agree with you if we were basing this on tap prowess, but Busta was able to take down Michael Myers with king fu and electricity to the groin. Maybe he’d be too powerful.
---
Because BHVR can't do Survivor Perks.
---
Calm Spirit also stops you from screaming from madness, clown gas etc.
---
Some perks are useless or weak like Deja Vu and Sabotage
---
But thanks. I already have Quentin’s perks aside from Pharmacy but Pharmacy is the one I really want. An emergency med kit with a gel pad and scissors? Yes, please. Plus it makes looting that much faster.
---
This gif causes me physical pain.
---
She's not tall. 💁🏻‍♀️
---
because that's whats realistic. its normal for adrenaline rushes to sort of wake up your mind and give you energy. adrenaline rushes do not magically remove sickness or madness in real life, whilst they do give you energy and can "wake you up"
---
Yeah i bring extra mori and farm with the remaining not dcing suvivors to suprise and reward them not bein utter shiets :D
---
Yes if a killer is shit it won't be the case, but if a killer and a survivor are around the same skill level the killer is always going to get more points and get them more easily, partially because it's almost impossible to max out the survival bloodpoint category.
---
[Me](https://i.imgflip.com/2usr03.jpg), as the OP
---
the yellow and brown ones still work, i have no clue if they're still weaker or they've made them the same value as the green ones. 
---
Ohh, i understand now. I misread the title
---
I prefer quality over quantity 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he depipped from that game.
---
Not really the same effect honestly, plagues fountains have the drawback of powering her up. Mending and getting full health isnt going to give anything to legion other than having to hit you one more time
---
i can see how the game would be more difficult at 2v1 / 1v1 at the start (gen wise)
---
but if the game has progressed even a 2v1 can outplay the killer with 2 dc's
---
in my own opinion survivor wise even 1 escape means victory, as with the new perk system the killer will have to try even harder to get the hook.
---
as for the too op on my part, i was picturing how Hook farmers would benefit more from this as they cause people to dc sometimes not always 
---
/s or no?
---
Because making no sounds at all from getting hit and from being in pain (which are two different things, besides...) would be too good for it to be just one perk. Using both forces you to use up two perk slots instead of using something else. 
---
I have noticed this a ton...It's so obnoxious. 
---
Original template u/ZombieHuggerr thanks once again are you still making these awesome templates?
---
Then the devs need to change it so simply pipping feels like a win, even if you didn't kill anyone. Idk how they'd do that, but it'd fix it.
---
The lack of missed attack cooldown is what makes him annoying. 
---
He pretty much dominates the 1v1 aspect. That’s why he’s annoying to play against. It’ll take time, but Legion will get you. No outplay potential. 
---
Just did you are right there is some jiggle my bad but I feel it's still not as much as Kate Denson.
---
There is supposed to be a hook in the circle but they added a few more spawns nearby and they usually take priority it seems.
---
Clown is Alchemist.
---
I'm serious. Everytime this gets posted people "reeee" all over the place to dismiss the comments. I dont care what Marth did in a few games. These are the facts on the game from the only people who have all of the actual stats...the devs.
---
I started this game as a huntress main and over and over again I kept seeing all these posts about how hard the game was for killers, but the challenge was why it was fun. Outplaying insta blinds, infinities, and vacuum pallets took actual skill. Now it's not even enjoyable to play killer because the survivors seem so useless and the hits connect no matter what. It is comical to see people ignore all of these stats and still whine that more and more shit for survivors need to be nerfed. Bad players shouldn't dictate the perks and add ons of the games. I sucked at first and worked to get better and overcome the teams. The challenge was the fun part, now it is a joke.
---
Because CS used to do something else before the buff.
---
He didn't DC tho.
---
You get used to it eventually... apart from Myers... Oh and Hag traps. And also the spirit... And a random chainsaw to face by Billy. Oh and don’t forget when you think you’re safe in a locker and then BOOM SURPRISE. Also the pig’s charge. 
---
Are you sure you made it face the right way?
---
Lol don't you have some survivors to camp scrublord?  What is your boosted ass still doing here?  Survivors won't camp themselves legend.
---
Shhhhh..... it's a joke
---
Nurse is the best killer, billy and huntress are great as well. They take time 2 learn. Dont just play killers bc of tier list. play killers that are fun! like i love 2 play wraith but he is one of the worst. experiment and find out what you like
---
Eh, you could've cropped out your rank and it would've had the same effect.
---
You just want everyone to know you're rank 1 with this new system.
---
I like the new system, it'll keep the super sweaty people like yourself at red ranks and the rest of us people who just like to have fun down below.
---
Love how Doc dressed up for the photo
---
&gt;when he takes your photo
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ydif14O.png
---
You win some you lose some, I don't see the problem honestly. In an Asymmetrical game of 1v4 shouldn't the 1 be the strongest and have the stats in their favor? 60% seems about right. I could play 10 games in a row as survivor and get out every time or not once thus the *joy* of RNG. Same as a killer I could play 10 games in a row and 3-4k each one or only get 1k, again what is the issue people are complaining about with kill/survivor rates? If anything we should be upset at obviously underperforming killers. Or indefinitely broken addons that haven't been touched in over a year. 
---
What about Freddy Krueger? He seems cool but apparently he’s absolute fucking garbage
---
He doesn’t have an increased movement speed at tier 3, just a longer lunge.
---
That's a terrifying joke 
---
I feel bad for you, haddonfield is the greatest map ever
---
Enjoyable meme. I know the community is never satisfied and I've been really enjoying the game but the one thing I wish they would add in is an option for people who are colorblind. I was playing with some friends last night and we we're doing kill your friends. One guy is colorblind and so at certain times it made it impossible for him to see our auras (especially in the cornfield) and so makes it impossible for him to play killer matches. That's honestly all I want from the devs.
---
Name: GlobGoGabLalab
---
I think mori’s are balanced as they still require work from the killer, a good survivor will usually never get killed by a Mori or it’ll be late game at least as you have to be hooked once then caught again.
---
Almost every game I play survivor where an Ebony is burned the killer ends the game with two kills, that’s balanced to me 
---
And there go a few more. What kindergarten did you go to growing up? I want to know so I can go there and learn to be as savage as you are.
---
Seriousy, grow up and try to seriously read something instead of charging and saying the first stupid shit that comes to mind. Your first reply tells me you didn't even bother skimming what I wrote before you smeared your shit onto my board
---
You must be playing against Bad Legions then. Breaking LoS doesn't really do anything. That is a great tactic against Mikey, but not Stabby Sonic boy. A good stabby boy won't lose you if you break LoS pretty much ever, nor give you opportunities to actually break it from a distance. This especially does not work if they are running bloodhound. A good stabby boy is going to stay outside of the chase range to let you bleed out, and then frenzy you when you are mending. A good stabby boy would moonwalk you back when that worked. A good stabby boy runs FMT to down you in 3 hits. A good stabby boy cuts you off and understands how survivors move.
---
No, people hate Legion because no matter what you are going to go down. It has nothing to with pallet looping, people even mentioned that pallet looping him while he is not in frenzy is still strong because he is slow as molasses.
---
Of course, I am also playing at high ranks.
---
that's fucking terrifying
---
im not 100% sure. but doesnt Memento mori mean something else? like i know they did not come up with it but im sure this is a ref to the Original 
---
I m PS4 player.
---
I got the 4k, merciless killer title, double pip, no mori, only the 3 perks from the character (of course), and still didnt get the trophy.
---
So, it is still bugged.
---
So if killers shouldn’t be allowed Ebony as an offering every 1 in 10 games, why should survivors get a free escape wen the play badly via the hatch in every game?
---
Hatch should not exist in the Game as the hatch mechanic is even more broken 
---
It doesn’t save more time if you know where the hex totems spawn
---
That's true but aren't there somewhere around like 9 possible totem spawns per map? Still you have a fair point though.
---
I read every dumbass word.  You admit to camping survivors.  From a killer main to an obvious baby that ain't cool.  Trash players camp.  Pipping with the new system is not hard for killer if you play correctly and don't baby camp and tunnel.
---
"Legion bad comment" ahahhaahahhaahhahaha
---
No hack.
---
Nurse is by far the best killer. Billy and Spirit are below her but a step above everyone else. After that, huntress, clown, vommy mommy, hag, and Myers are the last of the “good killers”
---
Good survivors can absolutely obliterate him if they play almost perfectly, but VERY little groups are that good. He wrecks newer survivors, but you can still play him against some better ones. Just watch some gameplays and see if you like him, but realise that gameplays usually show only good games.
---
4 months is outdated, yes.
---
No.
---
&gt; DS was by no means a "meta" or even "okay" perk against any killer worth their salt.
---
An un-counterable free escape from a killer, where you can start a chase back from where you messed up.
---
Remind me again why it's not even a mediocre perk?
---
There’s an oversight in the game where hex totems have a fixed spawn location. I don’t have a link to the guide but it’s on Steam.
---
I heard rumors they were going to Nerf Leatherface. I didn't want to believe them...
---
No he doesn't.  Just repair some damn gens ruin ain't shit if you're any good at all at this game.  Totem spawns keep changing too by the way and some maps are ginormous.
---
Thank you, I didn't know about prestige, it explains a lot of things.
---
I had this happen to me also, at the killer shack on Coal Tower, survivor jumped through the blocked window numerous times.
---
If I play Nurse against people who are green ranks (because matchmaking hates them I guess?) The survivors just sit on hook. Against Legion, they still get points.
---
All killers that choose to camp with gens up are trash.  I'm a rank 1 killer every month playing fair maining trapper, Wraith, Freddy and Pig with no NOED.  Playing killer these days is laughably easy.  There is no need to play so crutch and camp and yes you are trash for doing it.
---
Sabo used to be OP ya know, back before they changed hooks to respawn when sabotaged
---
puuuuuuuke
---
The doctor has seen some shit
---
He looks stressed out like “what am i gonna tell the missus tonight when she asks where my chainsaw is?”
---
OH GOD THEY'RE INNN THE TREES
---
I don’t see any whining about the killer being underpowered so this can’t be true 
---
It's better than just lazily playing and getting to rank 1
---
I love the good nature of this. You don’t even try to hide or run. Just goofin off. 
---
Yeah they’ve always helped me get my shit back as well.
---
This is just a Mom walking her daughter home from school as she tells her mom about the day she had
---
I once just stood behind someone in the basement while they searched a chest. They fuckin freaked out when they turned around
---
Isn't 60% kill rate like 2. something kills per game on average? That sounds good ngl...
---
In school map, ruin spawns in shack 90% of the time, which is broken as fuck.
---
Sorry to keep saying it but...thanks u/ZombieHuggerr!
---
Yes and no I don't think it need that I think it's bugged rn and the time is short even without enduring
---
You have a terrifying sense of humor.
---
I played survivor six times yesterday. Got that map six times. 
---
Hahaha! great!
---
Someone said you could do free moris on people in the circle which would be cool but unsurprisingly its LITERALLY NOTHING
---
# OOF
---
I love putting traps there as trapper boi/hag
---
Very well said. Thank you. Its quite frustrating to max out on boldness from chases do 3 totems and heal people and not get a pip because I only did 2 gens completely by myself.
---
&gt; supposed to keep out
---
Disclaimer: Doesn't actually work.
---
Right now? Idk. But before this new chapter you only needed a 4k. In fact, even  if you got Merciless and someone got out then you wouldn’t get the achievement. 
---
Absolutely. I love this change, personally. I just think this is the best second step. The proper first step is giving us a reason to actually be in and obtain red rank/rank one. I’d happily follow their rules for pips in red rank if there was something worth it at the end lmao. 
---
People are just mad that they cant loop more than 1 pallet ahaha. You spittin facts 
---
THE MORE YOU KNOW
---
My guess: Rank two killer versus low level survivor. Survivor found right off the bat after cleansing a totem. Got hooked and rescued. Then Moried.  Tis indeed sad. 
---
What has made it outdated, unless you mean that Survivors are even weaker now than the data suggests due to multiple Killers buffs/survivor nerfs since then
---
Hopefully rank 10 isnt better than rank 6 anymore
---
Considering the new emblem system (AFAIK) doesn't allow you to pip/gain as many points if you just genrush gens... it's only part of the objective, but not the entire objective. There's still other stuff to do, like totems, chests, running the killer around, unhooks, and being altruistic. 
---
Juggle or slug if everyone is playing optimally
---
People shit on slugging but dead-ass a DC helps survivors more
---
I like the new ranking system. In fact it should be harder. Not everyone deserves to be rank 1, but all of these salty players think they should be.
---
Chalk pouch ftw!!!!  Finally it pays off!!!!!!
---
Gen Rush is a thing, but only if the killer isn't diligent on checking gens. Check your gens. There might be Neas on them. 
---
You can forget about Rank 20. What about even Rank 3 having a 65% Kill Rate? I am pretty sure Rank 3's know about Scratch Marks

Juggling a survivor doesn't work if they know where the hooks are and get downed away from them.

Not really sure what you mean by averting aggro.

Slugging is extremely situational and rarely happens. If everyone plays optimally slugging is impossible.

Dodging ping is fine but let's be real here.  The vast majority of killer dodges have nothing to do with ping.

True, though that was a very long time ago. Sabo is still viable in swf, and even solo if you 99% hooks 
---
👌
---
Yeah after I made it I realized the information I put in it was incorrect so ya know.
---
Void approves.
---
Clown spirit down one hag pig up one. Still pretty close to my own. (Spirit is gimped without add ons) 
---
If doing Objectives is called Gen Rushing then Killers trying to Chase and Kill are Chase Rushing and Kill Rushing, right?
---
Here is a really old highlight of a game with a invisible hillbilly with no terror radius and a dwight head and no animations
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/112464661?filter=highlights&amp;sort=time
---
I need to get me that bear huntress set to really commit to the meme.
---
The spirit is very fun (in my opinion) and very powerful
---
Not necessarily if you’re too good you’re punished, forcing you to farm for the points causing unrealistic gameplay 
---
Genrushing is like 90% on killers everytime.  If you don't pressure gens and patrol aggressively and overcommit to chases what do you expect the other 3 survivors to be doing that you haven't so much as attempted to disrupt.  
---
You gotta try at least. Maybe after a couple minutes just say fuck it and do gens. 
---
Thank you void. But your cousin the entity was probably mad. 
---
It's raining (sadly not shirtless) Myers, hallelujah! 
---
If your theory about things changing so quickly is true, then how come the data from 1 year ago and the data from 4 months ago are so similar? If your theory was correct, we should expect to see large shifts in the data over time.  However, this is not the case.
---
What, there are other gays in this community? Lmao I thought it was 1% represent
---
Then don’t complain when a killer tunnels you.
---
Fs in the chat for Bubba...
---
Second cousin\* I chewed the dumbass out at the last family gathering for letting his baby killers out.
---
I was surprised how many times the killer didn't down you first.
---
Mourning Wood
---
Aw man he did it again?? No wonder I’ve been ranking up so easily. 
---
But in what way is he bad? I really don't get it tbh. He feels like a stronger Wraith to me.
---
But im not a trapper ;)
---
In a weird way it kinda forces cooperation on both sides, which seemingly goes against the point of the game. Killers have to chase survivors but not actually land any "dying" blows, or if they do, to not actually immediately hook them so as to give survivors time to heal the dying survivor. In turn, the survivors have to actively find the killer so as to stay in their terror radius and do things, but also trust the killer to ignore the sounds of generators being worked on or survivors being healed.
---
I don't really get it. It just sounds like the best way to pip up is to just farm and let the killer double-hook everyone and be in minute-long chases all the time while everyone stands around and heals before someone with a key finds a hatch for everyone to go down in.
---
&gt;When I'm there while someone is being unhooked
---
That's a pretty long way of saying camping. Which proves my point. No one unhooks someone in front of the killer unless that killer is already camping then they don't really have a choice now do they?
---
&gt;It also basically guarantees a free hook.
---
The old and new DS was used to prevent these situations with self proclaimed camping killers such as yourself. But here we are with a nerf to DS because "muh hook camp momentum."
---
&gt;Pretty nice strawman you got going on there, considering I haven't mentioned pips at all.
---
There's no straw man here especially since after the new update all you shitty scrubs can't even manage to even safety pip anymore. 😂 It's in direct relation to your "reasoning" that tunneling is "optimal." If it was you wouldn't be depipping with bronze emblems. Werid how they go hand in hand with each other especially since the old new scoring system rewarded shitty people for doing shitty things. Now it has been reverted to pre free red ranks for existing on the map and doing literally anything other than sitting in a corner afk. 
---
Nice edits that you added in by the way. It still doesn't help your case when you state that people are forced to help their team because you camp the hook like a bitch.
---
give him the good old slappy papper. Then shid on him.
---
Word
---
See it’s fine for killers, not hard to pip if you’re atleast half good. However as survivor if you have a team of potatoes you’re lucky if you don’t de pip. Solo survivor is harder than ever, gonna be seeing a lot more swf now.
---
“*THAT’S IT*! I’M GETTIN ME MALLET”

---
I WANT TO,WANT TO PLAY DBD I HAVEN'T HAD A DRIVE TO PLAY IT BUT I WANT TO. BUT IM JUST NOT READY FOR FLASHLIGHTS, VOMIT AND FACE CAMPS YET.
---
Exactly dude. She is not a good killer.
---
being good for new players doesnt make the perk itself good.
---
Wraith and Leatherface are good killers for newbies, doesnt make them actually good.
---
Urban Evasion is good for new players too, doesn't make it a good perk either (I will fucking fight you on this, UE sucks ass).
---
I only concider it genrushing if people purposely ignore hooked teammates to do gens. That's the kind of tactic that isn't fun for anyone.
---
Ofc don't need to insta rush for unhook but if someone dies on first hook and killer isn't camping then other survivors are doing something wrobg
---
Thing is the strat for good survivors is to not heal and just rush gens anyway, regardless of the killer. The strat against Plague isnt any different.
---
Do it again with someone waiting inside with the locker stun
---
Didn't cleanse a totem but wow your predicting skills are good
---
Been happening to me every game as bubba too.
---
Every time I see drag race content on here, my gaymer heart gets so warm
---
This is hilarious
---
Yeah...he like materializes out of thin air. And I was only half paying attention since we just started, just casually panning looking for the killer and/or waiting for the heartbeat.
---
I just made a post about the ranking mismatch - I am glad I am not the only one! It is definitely making this game harder to enjoy. Especially since I only play casually :\
---
From what I've gathered it is in fact community-led and was one of the early discords to be verified, granted a good bit of my info comes from a buddy of mine that's been playing for years and was in that Discord early on. Apparently BHVR officially recognizes it as "the Discord" for DBD, and that was enough, at least *at the time.* Discord may be enforcing it more thoroughly now that they've really gotten a lot of game integration going properly. But yeah I'd treat the discord as officially unofficial, and honestly I think BHVR is only really concerned with their personal forums as everyone on the discord mod team seems to be unrelated to the company.
---
Not with Small Game it don’t. Can find every totem on the map in less than a minute
---
Trolling (not toxicity) is part of the fun!!!
---
If you chill out as a survivor and don’t take it so seriously, DBD is a funny game
---
if ash becomes the next DLC , would be like a single player zombies mode or will ash jus be a survivor?
---
Who will win the staring contest? Place your bets!
---
And those wait times ...
---
Where is this circle?
---
Detective Tapp: I see, ma'am. I just called the Devs and they will do a rework. Right after they finish Freddy's.
---
When I see something called “Naughty Bear” I assumed it was a DVD and not a video game 😘
---
BBQ is always nice and make your choice is a god tier if the survivors are stupid i would go ruin but you said no totems so i guess sloppy butcher to make the game go slower for the last perk i dont have anything in mind right now so i guess that comes down to preferance
---
&gt; That's a pretty long way of saying camping.
---
It's not. There are many times where people try and unhook literally as soon as I hook, try and unhook as soon as I walk away, etc.
---
&gt; No one unhooks someone in front of the killer unless that killer is already camping
---
This is absolutely not true.
---
&gt; The old and new DS was used to prevent these situations with self proclaimed camping killers such as yourself.
---
That's not what self proclaimed means.
---
&gt; But here we are with a nerf to DS because "muh hook camp momentum."
---
Which has nothing to do with me, but I'm sure you can talk to somebody else about why DS got nerfed if you really want to.
---
&gt;There's no straw man here especially since after the new update all you shitty scrubs can't even manage to even safety pip anymore.
---
Not quite sure you know what a strawman fallacy is. It's when you bring up an argument that exists that I haven't talked about whatsoever, implying that I support that position.
---
&gt; It's in direct relation to your "reasoning" that tunneling is "optimal." If it was you wouldn't be depipping with bronze emblems.
---
I haven't even played killer since the rank update. I really don't get why you're talking shit like this when I'm talking about how optimal tunneling is.
---
&gt; Werid how they go hand in hand with each other especially since the old new scoring system rewarded shitty people for doing shitty things. Now it has been reverted to pre free red ranks for existing on the map and doing literally anything other than sitting in a corner afk.
---
This is mildly incoherent.
---
&gt; Nice edits that you added in by the way. 
---
I thought some elaboration would help you understand what I was talking about.
---
&gt; It still doesn't help your case when you state that people are forced to help their team because you camp the hook like a bitch.
---
This... is another strawman. I'm not sure you really want to talk about the mechanics at all, because all you seem to want to do is attack me.
---
Rank 3 spirit getting 12-17 survivors ... I felt like a bully when I saw that. I also waited over 10 minutes for that lobby and safety pipped because now killers are punished for stopping survivors too quickly.
---
Dont run it then. It's not wasted if you could use it in a certain situation. There are a ton of situational perks, unbreakable, ds, noed, lightborn, the list goes on. It is there to be situational. It doesnt need a rework it's fine. 
---
On PC there's an option for dynamic resolution adjustment so maybe they implemented a version of that
---
&gt;There might be Neas on them. 
---
Idk why but I just had the image of a bunch of roaches with Nea faces crawling over the gens when I read this. 
---
Lol trolling is toxicity but okay.  Keep sandbagging your teamates like a "legend" I suppose.
---
You fucking had me in the first-half OP.
---
The problem is people don't check around their spawn area. I play so many games where the ruin totem is literally beside a fellow survivor and they ignore it.
---
I think you misspelled "Bitch" in the bottom left corner. You're welcome.
---
Those are in the drawer. 😁👌
---
Ash stole it! The leak is real

---
The term itself is accurate and applies to the game. I usually focus mainly on doing gens as a survivor, and as a killer, I’ve had those games where 3-4 gens go off before I’ve even had a chance to look around. People will focus on gens and just gens, rushing the objective. I think the question is whether or not this is “wrong.” I don’t think it’s wrong, it’s never wrong to do the objective. I do think it’s a boring and annoying way to play though. The devs need to do something to fix the game in regards to that, so that survivors don’t feel this pressure to just focus in gens and get them done ASAP.
---
Situational, yet powerful, exactly in line with other situational yet powerful perks like Unbreakable and Deliverance.
---
I thought the new DS was supposed to not give you obsession from the start, only after you used it so killers don’t know you have it. Every time I have used it I’m the obsession from the start and I get chased until I’m downed then slugged. It’s worse then it was before so I gotta give it the shittiest rank possible. 
---
Ive only gotten the nee map twice.
---
Yeah i definitely agree hatch stand offs are survivor favored but my main point is left behind is a garbage waste of a perk slot
---
Why do survivors think killers have to follow their magical invisible rules 
---
one of the best counter perks to ruin. its not a 100% counter but I'd give it a decent 40% effective counter.
---
Shit happens
---
Good point but the legion can also run at whatever speed feral frenzy goes whenever he wants lol but yeah i agree idk. they just need to remove the mf
---
Gotcha. What is the no animals alerts?
---
well most other games also have casual modes. i imagine that bhvr wanted a single mode that "ensures" that people of similar ranks will always be matched together. which they couldn't even manage obviously
---
This was funny a hundred posts ago. 
---
He paid for it, he just had a perk that lessened the punishment he received.
---
I'd rather have it too hard to pip than too easy which was the last system.  Immersed do nothing survivors reached rank 1 before.  Baby campers reached rank 1 easily before.  These players never had any business being in red rank.  I don't think anyone would disagree that some tweaks have to be made but as a whole I love the new direction of the pip system. 
---
Hi, I am a 2000 hour player who plays both sides and also has a Master's in Data Science. Let's break this down:
---
Let's take a look at another example of stats not lining up with the developer call. This being early leblanc in league of legends.
---
Back in season 2/3 leblanc came to rise as a top tier mid laner in pro play. When played properly she was downright oppressive and forced out a lot of matchups. However her stat line on the public ladder show win-rates varying in the low 40%'s so she loses more games than she wins? So she is underpowered and needs a buff? No she doesn't. The devs rightfully nerfed her because in the proper hands she was too powerful.
---
In DBD, the survivor squad suffers from this same fate. When played properly, and not even in SWF, just all four players actually run to the gens and hold m1, the game goes VERY quickly. The problem is this is boring and worth WAY less points than being chased by the killer and saving allies. Therefore, people spend a lot of time dicking around. Alternatively, they are new players and are hiding WAY more often that they should be.
---
This is compounded by the fact that "surviving" does not equal winning in our game. Pipping does. I lost track of the 1000's of matches I have played where the survivors have at least 2-3 escaping if they want, but decide to go for the "no man left behind" plays because it is FUN. Hell I do it too when I play survivor.
---
Balance is often done with both veteran players (marth, jen, etc.) and new players in mind. If something is busted in high tier play, it is busted. Period. You cannot have something broken at high tier because it is assumed players are already playing near their best and means that thing is OP. They cannot simply "get gud" because they already are good.
---
However, if there is a disparity between high and low tier play it means you need to SOLVE THAT DISPARITY. The issue is not that killers are overpowered - but is that there is a MASSIVE difference between efficient SWF play and casual play. Especially at low ranks. How do we give players the tools to work better as a team without being on voice coms etc.
---
This was seen in another Asymetric game as well. Evolve. The monster absolutely shit canned teams unless they were high tier players then it was flipped. At high tier play the monster was at a disadvantage, yet people still called for nerfing the monster.
---
You absolutely cannot look at raw data and assume you know the answers to design decisions and balance issues without having further context as to why the data is playing out that way. If I did that at work, I would lose my job. Your goal should be to understand data, not read it.
---
Here's another thing - if you're unhooked while sick, you can just run up to a fountain and get a free heal.  It completely negates the time it takes to heal after being hooked, and it negates the , i think, broken status it gives you?  So please just let it heal the sickness, not a health state.  Her balance is thrown off.
---
Except that it's not a glock
---
I hide my very few porn DVDs in video game cases. Like anyone would check fallout 76 😶
---
I suspect they've simply utilized the spherical hitboxes of Huntress hatchets for the Purge ability, which are quite... generous, to put it mildly. There actually was one attempt to change them into rectangular hitboxes that more-so match the actual model of the hatchet, but they quickly had to revert that change due to community backlash (which, to be fair, was pretty reasonable given that it led to hatchets functioning significantly differently from how they did prior). But they could still just... reduce the size of those spheres...
---
Latency obviously plays into these things, as well.
---
Id like to think a double pip at rank 1 should be fucking hard to do. A perfect game required? Sure, what else is there to strive for? 
---
I think the only real offense here is still not getting a reward for it. Why even be mad at a ranking system if it doesnt give you anything? Its just the devs idea of you playing "correctly" and nothing more, so who gives a shit?
---
He needs a rework but so does freddy. Cause when legion is played correctly someone will walk out the match with 0 kills unless someone refused to mend
---
I had a survivor do this to me. I give him props and left him on the floor for his teammates to pick up lol. 
---
He tried it again later in the match but fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. He got hooked that time around lol
---
Huntress is the cutest Deadly Bunnymom. UwU 
---
He has to wait to hit people (dream transition), his power doesn't help him in a chase and is countered by one of the most popular survivor perks: Self-Care. How long survivors stay asleep is also determined by RNG. He has no hook defense or defense in general. Once the gates are open or the hatch is open there is very little Freddy can do even with NOED active. He's fun to play and has some fun add-ons, but he is very reliant on perks and add-ons.
---
I'm not reading any of that. Lmfao
---
The fact that you saw an just dismissing you over and over yet you invest that big of a response is almost as sad as the data you tried to pass off as relevant. 
---
Funny you mention that, a fallout 76 disc is right next to that one.
---
haha well i hate to tell you this bud but judging how balanced this game is based on how many kills you get at (im assuming you mean rank) rank 20 is not a good measure. What's important is how this game works when the best 4 survivors goes up against the best killer. Who has a better chance? I can tell you for an absolute fact that a few patches ago it woulda been the survivors. And may still even be. DS is in a good place now. People who need to be allowed to get caught 3 times instead of 2 times are the type who are mad about DS. With where DS was and, going even further back, how maps were, the killer was doomed. especially against 4 DS'
---
This is only valid advice if he lives in burgerland
---
DS is supposed to punish tunneling, but it doesn't guarantee it will stop it (if the killer wants you dead, you're dead no matter what). The stun time should be affected by a perk that lessens stun times. I don't see anyone fussing about being slapped down after getting up with Unbreakable or being hit down again after using Deliverance. The only reason I can see as to why people are this upset about perks working against each other is because they're extremely salty that DS is nowhere near as good as it used to be and is actually counterable now. 
---
I always use this combo. 
---
&gt; Never mentioned "thin".
---
Fine, would you prefer "average"?  Regardless of word choice, you're raising issue with her being big unlike the other survivors (except Jeff) who are thin.  
---
Can guarantee you the decision to make her big was more about giving her a distinct silhouette as well as making her visually unique.  Do you think it is a coincidence that most of the characters also have unique and different hairstyles or accessories?  
---
And you're essentially saying that a character that isn't thin or white is absurd pandering lol.  You say you couldn't care less about it, but these weird delusions you're making about how you think they made Jane to pander to big girls says otherwise lol
---
Lmao if you think jane is fat, oh boy
---
I mean I’m rank 1-3 survivor currently so that would have been fine for me had I been in your place but yeah I get u. Idk what’s up with matchmaking rn
---
haha you said WOOSH and REDDIT hahaha it’s realy funny because XD the woosh means that the joke went WOOSHH over your head XD XD lololol ahahaha and reddit is this really cool website LOL where i like to talk with fellow EPIC LE REDDITORS and we aAre all SUPER COOL LOL! XD and this is funny because XD on THIS REALLY EPIC WEBSSDITE LMAOO ROFLMAO XD there is this subREDDIT(a part of reddit in case u need explain because ur dumb haha XDDD) and on this subredddtt LOLMAOROFLXDDD LOLOLOLLLLLL XD we make fun of silly billys (XD) who dont understand a joke (HAHAAXDXCCC) they are SOOOOO SILLY AHAHAHA XDDDD
---
NEW RANKED SYSTEM IS EVEN MORE FUCKED BC NOW PIPPING IS RANDOM AND YOU'LL BE PAIRED WITH SHITHEAD SURVIVORS EVEN MORE. I NEED FRIENDS PLS ADD ME.
---
Didn’t even notice. I thiiiink camping bears vol 4 is in my 76 case. Appropriate for the nature of the game lol. 
---
PLAY SWF AND HAVE UR PAL RUN RIGHT IN FRONT OF A LOCKER THAT UR IN, IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM
---
even though it's a bug, it's still really awesome to see how killer animations look in third person, we can't always appreciate said animations because we are busy running away but now we can!
---
Ruin changed so even level one affects all survivors. But I agree about the rank changes. 
---
Dude what? Shes very obviously overweight, its not that big of a deal though
---
WHY WERE THE TWO BEST KILLER PERKS IN THE GAME BUFFED? IM A KILLER MAIN BC I HATE MENTAL SURVIVORS BUT WTF I DONT EVEN AGREE WITH THIS
---
I mean, i didn’t have a problem with playing against a rank 2, since my normal rank is higher than 14, but given the fact that the pip system is pure chaos atm... I just think the Matchmaking is turning more and more into a mess too....
---
Getting chased for the whole game and winning the game for all the other survivors  makes you de-pip because you only got chased and didn't do anything else. ***This is bullshit.***
---
Fucking good. Survivor should be about hiding. Not running in circles and dropping anvils on people’s heads
---
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS NEAR A LOCKER, AND GOOD KILLERS KNOW THE 'GO ONE DIRECTION FOR 5 SECONDS' TACTIC. SO CONGRATS ON THE CHAINSAW UP YOUR ASS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.
---
******WE****** ARE LEGION
---
Well the description specifically says it still makes you more likely to become obsession.
---
And if what you're saying is the case then nobody should start off as obsession if ONLY DS is in play in regards to obsession perks
---
A lot of killers are kinda boring to play but it just depends on the day
---
Looks like a Silent Hill boss Dwight has to encounter
---
So huntress isn’t the tallest anymore 
---
So survivors aren’t allowed to body block but killers are?
---
Not as soon. Think like this. You are in a chase and walking or UE away, get in a locker, and if they find you stun them and go away. I mean if you’re life depended on it going into a locker is viable.
---
Yeah that makes sense.
---
anyway you'll become pretty good with great skill checks if you do like that instead of spending minutes looking for the totem.
---
When data doesn’t tell the whole story or isn’t specific enough, I have a problem with it. 
---
Especially since this guy has been pushing this same info for a few weeks now.
---
Willing to bet he’s a survivor main who hates killer buffs. 
---
How can you control the other players on your team? You can’t tell them what to do especially since swf is toxic and cheating 
---
Nurse’s, Sloppy Butcher, Make Your Choice, and Surveillance (to at least give you some gen control). 
---
As long as the game isnt too laggy (ps4). 
---
There's two more when searching "choose your class" and sorting by relevance ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/search?q=choose+your+class&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)).

This isn't the work of Franklin's Demise. This is the work of one Ashley J Williams. I bet he has a new hand...Leatherface and Hillbilly better run!
---
Honestly even if it ingame it was as easy to see as it is here, my teammates would still step on it
---
always edging yourself.. yikes

When you bring stake out and any totems spawn on the map

Only if he does wheelies on an atv around the map

That would be a ridiculous advantage honestly 
---
Nice
---
Well, I don't think they're exclusive is the only thing. By all means, it makes sense. You SHOULD be "Gen rushing". But its the fact that your objective is soooo much easier then the killers, and even when the killer is doing very well, they can still not get more then two kills. This is ignoring things like insta heal, brand new parts, and flashlights/pallet saves. Thus, while you are indeed "doing the objective", doing the objective is too easy. If you get distracted by other things, your not gen rushing, and the games not as bad. Something should be done to make it so gen rushing isn't painfully punishing. By all means, you SHOULD be doing it. But that therin lies the problem. However, we then face balancing issues, and as im sure someone will say "just apply more pressure". While this is true for say... Nurse? Or Billy? Pretty much no one else can apply the pressure needed to actually prevent gens being done quickly. But then, should we make it harder, these two can become immpossible. Its an issue that does not have a simple answer. The point being though, that saying your "gen rushing" shouldn't really be an insult, more of a "man I wish your objective was a bit harder".
---
Yep, this is Akeria Davenport who is on the current season (S11) of Drag Race.
---
Then camping is just doing the objectives too. Whatever helps you win
---
But I'm nothing without this chainsaw.
---
Just because of that dress, bitch, you safe as fuck. 
---
theres a big difference between tunneling and doing the objective (in killers case its chasing). 
---
About a quarter of the posts on this subreddit are drag race related. The gays do love their horror games.
---
Wait aren't you the guy who poses as shirtless Myers In the other sub?

Can people please stop posting porn to this sub? It's beyond creepy.

You hear that grandkids? You’ll finally have a decent Freddy and then YOUR grandkids will see a legion that they won’t get shit for playing!
---
I like the new system tbh. Needs to be a little easier bc rn it’s too much but with the old system a brand new player could hit rank 1 if they just grinded games 
---
If you play killer with bbq it shouldnt take more than a week or two at most. I got kate p3 50 in a couple of days during the last double bp week we had.
---
Lmao where were y'all when my shirtless David drawing was being marked NSFW? 😂😂
---
The issue isn't that you need good emblems to rank up, it's that the emblems are flawed. If I'm playing Hillbilly and one shot each survivor within 15 seconds of finding each of them and their teammates hide and don't unhook them, so they all die first hook, I probably will barely safety pip at higher ranks.
---
#HMMMM
---
Just spend the 4$ for David and come to the survivor side
---
how do you know their names hmmm
---
hows that boot taste? 
---
So THIS is what P.E. teachers see when they ask you to line up... 
---
Oh yea, at low ranks he fucks shit up though, if you were to Buy DLC i would get myers he is lots of fun
---
Nope tell me how it’s powerful? 
---
I second this. Spirit is a lot of fun and quite powerful once you get the hang of her. (: 
---
no believe in urself 
---
On a scale
---
I'll take the mage, please
---
She's probably the second lowest.
---
Just get better at looping 
---
Is... he... in black Face?  
---
That’s cultural appropriation, man. Uncool, uncool
---
First game of the new system: 2 players DC’ed as I was playing the Plague (don’t know why that was abandon worthy)
---
I depipped. I didn’t even black pip. 
---
The second game I killed all 4 survivors with Billy within 3 minutes. I **BARELY** black pipped. 
---
That is a pretty piss-poor system if you ask me. 
---
I still want rank rewards
---
How the fuck is being able to get up all the way by yourself *not* powerful?
---
Either you're severely obtuse or you're just playing like you're thick.
---
Lol what is the point of ranks?
---
Supernatural taught me Spirits can't cross a line of salt.

---
Her name is akeira davenport and she wore a dress that looks like the new killer Adiris or more known as "the plague"
---
Hag is as good as spirit imo, but more map dependent, which is anything other than coldwind is playable.
---
That is really interesting to read!
---
Latency is of course part of the issue, but even in good pings this has been happening. 
---
It’s not powerful because you can only use it one time.
---
I mean it’s been obvious for a while killer is strong as fuck. Any really good killer playing A+ tier killers they know how to play will wipe the floor with anything that’s not a try hard swf 
---
You can't have it back until after class.
---
Now that I think about it, a lot of Reddit does seem kinda cringey...
---
Flashlight thiefs will be sad
---
I get so much ruin and bbq it's kind of  curse
---
Could you explain "doing gens, you?" please? I'm vaguely aware its a streamer thing but not much more than that.
---
how will you logically explain what totem cleansing and saving teammates is if you taök in killers terms?
---
Im committing to a gen if im like 70% done and someone is stage 1 hook. I wouldnt let someone die though for a gen, thats just messy.
---
The zoom tickled me. Why did the zoom tickle me?

---
And Rank 3 being the place where people are DC'ing and deranking so they can get better que times. Also the place where killers are most likely to use momento mori's.
---
Also, you can't just say "forget about Rank 20". You used (and your words exactly)
---

Yes, you go onto the next part of Rank 3, but lets not forget what DBD is at it's core, just at it's most basic level.

I think that if a match goes poorly, survivors are more prone to quit less out of fuck you and more so, well the ranking is going to depip me anyway. 
---
I love the song. What is it?
---
Why the hell would you buy the full set for the discount price when buying the 2 pieces you want is already cheaper than what you'd end up with after having purchased the full set?
---
Also there is no discount at all for purchasing a set with Shards.

Yes, which is why it's powerful yet situational... am I having a stroke?

If you have leather face you should start with him using BBQ and chilli it's a really good perk to get blood points.

Willpower that I could never possess.  You're a stronger man than me.  I would have raged.
---
That can't be true though, every killer talks about how underpowered they and how Survivors need nerf after nerf because 1 game last week they only got 1 Kill
---
Oh, i Was talking about solo survivors. Bond is such an amazing perk for solo players that is hardcore slept on
---
I had the same thing happen to me, it was also happening with the Unbreakable perk description for me 
---
If I see two injured survivors, and one is 1 hook away from death, and the other has never been hooked, who do you think I’m going for? And killers can’t exactly apply pressure like that, at least not the weaker ones. How can I apply pressure to 4 survivors scattered across the map doing gens with a doctor or bubba? Not every killer is nurse
---
Have to admit I play a little toxic sometimes, not flash and tbag but I'll hang at a pallet while a killer tries to double back a few times and self heal intermittently. I expect the face camp at that point with noed but it's implied if I'm dodging every hatchet/shock/frenzy/saw. I try to be the target of agro so I'm fine with it. Tbags are really asking for it though, normally teenagers so fuck 'em and make sure they die. They're normally bad players.
---
Couldn't be more wrong man.  That's advice from a killer main.  Those swf groups made me learn to play efficiently and make intelligent decisions in game.  I'm sorry but if you find swf to be this unbeatable machine I'd simply recommend practicing and playing more killer.  Once you learn to play swf you feel confident going into any given game.
---
Yes, the Hunting Horn.
---
Seeing the leaks the other day made me watch 3 of the Evil Dead movies in a row yesterday (I’d already seen the first one). They’re so great!
---
“I never even saw these assholes before!”
---
It's honestly best to just suck it up and accept that SWF is part of the game and isn't going anywhere.
---
You got Legion’s class wrong. It’s not spelt monk.
---
It’s spelt spastic

I know BBQ is fantastic for points, but is the tracking good on hag with her lack of cross map mobility? I have most teachable perks unlocked, so the extra bp isn't critical
---
Modern solutions to modern problems
---
What leads me to believe people are de-ranking at rank 3? Because I've been to Red ranks myself, multiple times and seen people de-ranking alot, not putting effort into playing the game or just goofing about and when I ask, majority say "I want to be able to play the game without waiting 30 minutes for a game".
---
Rank 3 was your example, so I brought up rank 3. Don't act like I said word for word "Oh, it's rank 3 and no other rank in the game, and it's always been like that."
---
Yeah but like I said before it’s hard to find the totems.
---
Also when the match matters most it’s active, and by those same standards the DS is active not as long by far
---
DS was only a problem who didn’t perform it’s counter (juggling, enduring, etc.) like
---
Cmon dude you’re blatantly one sided  
---
I know same and they expect you to just be cool with everything being unfair and act like they have god's right to be shitty to you.. :l
---
Claudette almost screwed you over.
---
Thanks

You attempting to defend good killers camping as a non mindless babystrat is just pathetic dude.  You are attempting to legitimize a rank 20 strat.
---
Does this come with a free dinner??? 
---
I think it’s called Two of Hearts!
---
Yeah how do you not double pip from one hooking everyone? Seriously you complain about something that does not matter and gives no reward.
---
Nah I'd rather hop lobbies so I don't get stuck with toxic swf with way higher ranks and get a fair lobby with normal people so swf have to suck up waiting longer ^-^

I like how they made it harder to get to rank 1. But when I 4k at rank 10, and derank from it, that seems a little brutal.... please make 3k at least a safety pip. U cant always win once the hatch opens. 
---
I *wike* it *bewwy mwuch* UwU
---
All the time!
---
You couldn't more wrong.. and well in my experience most swf are toxic and rq if you get your hands on them. Also no you're assuming again, I didn't say I need practice I said I don't like unfair boarder-line cheating in any game. Pls learn to read..
---
Big UwU
---
It really depends on what your definition of winning is. If you're trying to pip then it is only one of your 4 objectives and just rushing gens and escaping isn't likely to rank you up fast. You would need some altruism and some chaser. If your definition of winning is escaping then it is your main objective and probably the reason you're rushing the gens. If your definition of winning is getting a "perfect" game or 32k blood points then gen rushing won't get you anywhere near your goal. This is what can turn into an argument, because people disagree on what "winning" is on DbD. That being said I do think that tunneling and gen rushing are one and the same. It's not fun for the tunneled survivor and it's not fun for the gen rushed killer. What's worse is typically when a killer gets gen rushed they resort to tactics that survivors hate such as tunneling, camping and slugging in order to try and scrap up any chance they can to win. Therefore providing a crappy game for at least two people. The one person the killer found and camped and then the killer who was forced to play in an unfun way in order to try and get whatever scraps he can get. 
---
When you use google translate
---
What the shite are you blathering on about? They released like 15 survivors, and then one that's slightly overweight, and your mind jumps straight to "WOW THEY SHOVE REPRESENTATION INTO EVERYTHING" 
---
As someone who has a huge disdain for unnecessary representation, pandering, and the like, I actually agree with you for the most part. But this is a serious stretch. *I* don't like pandering, and my reaction to the new survivor was "Huh. Overweight. Neat." 
---
Me watching Saw 1 be like "DAVID TAPP IS BLACK, UNNECESSARY REPRESENTATION- PANDERING." Chill out. And also what the hell are you talking about with Jeff? He's got a beard? And... Look, I'm a bit confused. Is it the long hair that made you mad, or is the guy having grim reaper shirt? What are we complaining about this time? 
---
I believe the Data excludes Disconnects so anyone DCing to Derank is excluded from the data. Also, considering the Data across all ranks is pretty uniform suggests it is not a deranking issue, unless you are suggesting the people derank all the way down to Rank 20 and then keep trying to derank while at 20?
---
will dedservers fix it
---
Tunneling and camping is just killers "doing the objective" by making sure the person they hooked died. 
---

---
Always. 
---
Hey you have the right to babyrage about playing swf just like I do to tell you and other killers to simply man up and play them.  They really aren't as bad as you ate picturing them to be.  It's rare that you'll get 4 loop gods in the group.  At least a couple are usually weak.  I'm just tired of all the whining that soft killers do about them at this point.
---
Okay, thanks! Someone else answered to, but this clarifies it more. I guess I was just unlucky and ran into the three corrupted ones then incorrectly assumed all were corrupted. Yeah, that’s not bad at all really. 
---
I 100% agree with you when it comes to killer pipping. The game gives you a pip for a fun, interesting match and it's not difficult for killers to do if they know how to play the game well. 
---
My problem is with survivor pipping; it's just a little bit too strict, imo. I see what they're trying to go for and I think it's good to require survivors to do a little bit of everything (rather than being able to rank up for finishing three gens and running out the door), but if they either loosened the pip requirements just a little bit or gave some more points for chases I think it'd be fine. 
---
May you do a Survivor version of this please ?
---
What pip? 
---
LOL so basically you have no proof, as expected. Get rekt
---
I agree with the survivor lol
---
Funny that it only happens to Left Behind and Unbreakable, but not BT 
---
I usually do that, especially around rank reset, but it seems these good players don't rank up because of the new system either. Oh well, maybe I'll finally improve over time haha.
---
I hate to be a grammer nazi but BOI
---
Basement wraith build?
---
It's funny how familiar all this looks.
---
It cuts the speed at which a standard killer gains on you in half and against 110 speed killers they can almost never get you without bloodlust. Normally they gain on you .6m/s and .4m/s respectively. With haste that drops to .32m/s and .12m/s. Throw in a lithe or balanced landing mid chase and you can be very safe long enough for a gate to get opened.
---
Ick there's gotta be some kind of cream that can get rid of the neas if you do have an infestation, right?
---
It's me lol
---
I'm rank 17 and manage to double pip every now and then, I really don't see what the problem is
---
Same goes for flashlights, always put the battery first, then the low amp, that way the low amp adds the % to the battery as well as the flashlight, giving more charges.
---
I totally wish I could, but both perks are too strong to pass up. Devs should take a look at them. I
---
And I feel conflicted as a 50/50 player. I hate fast boring games. When the killer just gets looped by daylight and we escape with no chaser points I feel like I didn’t earn a victory sometimes. I kinda dunked a baby. Inversly, I hate games where I crush four surviors cause they’re potatoes. I’m like “hey do y’all belong here?” 
---
So I get why making uninteractive games less rewarding but also making every game need to be a big party interaction is going to make some games an inevitable depip for non-altruistic players and killers who don’t spread out their attention will not only hurt themselves out of almost all four emblems but cause everyone else to only safety pip while they derank. 
---
I fucking love this, might have to put Dwight on and do it, it just feels right.
---
Yea, pretty much. I would hear the warning sound but skill checks would not show up, so I failed every single one.
---
Small game &gt; Stakeout 
---
Or both...
---
Happy cake day!!
---
If it were me I’d flinch and you’d see my camera go straight up
---
I need to try this for luls
---
Because if its too hard to get into and stay at red ranks, then people will be pushed down to lower ranks and start facing people with a wide range of skill.
---
 Ok players will be matched with really good players. Really good players will get matched with potatoes more often. The new system doesnt really help anyone.
---
yikes :)
---
*Whihingh
---
Oh nice, thank you !  I'll check that out tomorrow (are you in the US though ? We might have a ping problem if you're in like, California, because I'm in the EU lol). 
---
Training seems like a good idea, see what type of gameplay makes you pip and what doesn't. Thanks !
---
Can never think of anything else when I hear that song.
---
It’s called Hooking and BBQ &amp; Chili

Stakeout is a better NOED counter.

Basically like this: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/home/leaving?target=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fcbm4bvqzO0w

Except it only happened to me on generators towards the end of the game, and I didn't experience the teammate status glitch.
---
Because leaks must have the spoiler tag. 
---
Doing this as Dwight is considered sacrilege and you'll most likely be kicked from their little good boy club. I joined Cult of Dwight due to this and I have to say, being an evil Dwight is much better. 
---
*too
---
Chainsaws scare the shit out of me so Hillbilly or Leatherface. I love Huntress and Plague so I'd def befriend them haha
---
&gt; What exactly do you need to know about chase mechanics when you're stuck at a jungle gym? 
---
Don't give them the fast vault to the window, if you see they're looping towards it you need to take the timeloss from changing directions and go the other way. A jungle gym in this day and age is just a regular pallet loop with a guaranteed hit at the window if you're playing it correctly.
---
I was so shook I’m surprised I didn’t lmao
---
“Shut the hell up, bitch.”
---
Made me chuckle, decent pun.
---
Literally crying lmao
---
I'm defending camping and tunneling as the dbd meta which it legitimately is. I'm not responding to you anymore because you are a fucking scratched record who either doesn't read or just reads the last line of anything I write and pretends they do
---
Yeah It is very annoying to rank up now, I'm a pretty decent survivor, but I don't go against the best killers, which result in low altruism and low chase or low objective. Which doesn't allow me to pip at all.
---
/r/donttalktomeormyson   
---
/r/meormyson
---
It's still easy to rank up in white/yellow ranks though, I've never had any issue either. It's the purple and red ranks that are very difficult now, hence people de-ranking to green ranks.
---
I live in the us, but I'm in the center of it. I play with a guy from Japan and don't have any issues since the new patch.
---
When killers complain about the survivors working on gens, they are usually just whining, but that doesn't mean that gen-rushing doesn't exist. A four man toolbox squad on discord with prove thyself, perfectly coordinating to rush down gens and split the map favorably is gen rushing. If they know how to do this properly there isn't much you can do as killer, because you've almost instantly lost the ability to effectively patrol gens on most maps.
---
I really like the Basement choke points. Temple and the Game has 2 of the best. 
---
After 800 hours I'm overwhelmed by the fact that the game is now so much more playable 
---
Oh shit you babies are still bitching over kill rushing? Lmao the entitlement never stops here.
---
Reminds me of yesterday when I was playing Myers smh. long story short I kept getting looped and flashlighted everytime i pick up a survivor. Didn't help that they teabag at the exit gate.
---
Trick or treat... motherfucker!
---
Look at #20 does it sound right-ish for a short description of your error?
---
Camping and tunneling is meta?  Jesus Christ you're pathetic if you think that. Camping and tunneling is for killers that are either too shit or too lazy to apply strong map pressure and end multiple chases efficiently.  I've been playing this for 2 years and it gas never been easier for killers with all the survivor nerfs the past 6 months.  I play the weakest killers, play fair and consistently win at rank 1.  You are pure trash if you think camping and tunneling is the meta.  
---
I\~\~ Think we did a pgetty good job soooo faar
---
Yea, thank you.

You're thinking of Detective's Hunch

Don’t worry I’m here
---
I don't have bullshit, irrelevant, inapplicable data like you did, you are correct.
---
Because low ranked survivors are morons.
---
I actually agree with this statement and stand by it strongly. And this is coming from someone who plays killer for 90% of their games
---
Its just a game bro 
---
It's pure crutch man.  No skill literally brand new player first game can camp.  Pathetic way to play the game and creates no challenge.  Luckily the new pip system came out to punish baby killers exactly like you.  You were devs intended audience with these changes.  Take the hint..
---
I'd say it's very good at lower ranks, because in those ranks you get tunelled for 90% of your games, but at higher ranks it doesn't happen as much.
---
Yep. These results are skewed. 
---
Because you posted it lol
---
Perfect! Thanks. 
---
LOL. Thanks for the laugh, the Survivor Seal Team 6 had me dying. I know exactly what you mean. When you try to play killer and Obi Wan Kenobi shows up to blows your head off with his odd bulb lightsaber. Meanwhile the survivor teammates miss the save, then get downed trying to take a hit.
---
What?
---
Reminds me of those old "when you see it" pictures. 
---
My heart leapt for a second.
---
Because it's not fun to lose. 
---
God please fix this fucking shit. It's making the game disencouraging. How am I supposed to play the game, do 3 gens and unhook people and still depip? That means I did most of the work and helped the others yet I get punished for it? It's not fair and honestly it's making me not want to play the game. I don't care about rank, what I care about is if the game makes me feel like I'm doing "good". The game makes me feel like I've failed or fucked up because I didn't do perfect games and that's just not fair. I did most of the work, at the very least I deserve ONE pip. 
---
Ooo so a stealth anti healing build with MYC sounds like a great combo :D Ty!

---
2). Behavior you cannot control killer actions and motives with emblems and ranks. This will never be effective and you need to stop pretending like it is by "nerfing" camping and pipping through emblems. If I want to camp and you will reduce my rank based on how long I spend near the survivor guess what I will do? I'll just camp them from a little further away. It's not hard, in fact I've done it in the past few games I just played to test it out. My emblem was not affected if I return to the hook in order to push away would be saviors which is not against the ranking system. I can tunnel without my rank being affected. In fact it legitimately helps me pip since I can just bully the first survivor into suicide or dc then play 3v1 which is easily a stomp and hook swapping means I'll most likely still get irrie sacrifices if none of them crack and dc or suicide
---
Every game, every time.
---
Legion players are scum.
---
Looked at their profiles before the match and saw a background of one of them teasing a mori on a survivor soo much that they messaged them and the killer saved that moment as her background. So I decided to do some petty karma. 
---
"How dare you not play exactly the way I want you to play! You need to spend money on the new DLC so that I can play against the new killer!"
---
Yeah what would be the best side? I mean as killer youd either be killing or being bullied. As survivor youd get killed alot but I think eventually you get to bully and your not alone
---

I do have one serious question, though. Is it true that if Survivors pull their Ethernet to DC it can *actually* cause an 8014 crash report on the Killer's end? 
---
Upvoted because cute doggo
---
I'm sure he got a ton of ambush dashes. Those can stack up if you get a lot of hits it's 500 per hit, then traps are a bonus
---
I bet you wack off to motherboards. lmao
---
Your downvotes should tell you what people think of your data. Take the L.
---
I dont understand how someone can live without spongebob in their life.
---
No one is likely pipping in that case if the killer couldn't do any of those things before NOED kicked in because survivors need to be chased, tracked, hooked, unhooked to pip. 
---
Like I said. She has potential. Of course, no killer really stands a chance with a team of gen jockeys burning through gens without Ruin or Intervention. 
---
Thinking about it irl I don't think someone would tea bag or pallet loop you 
---
hrrgg... Entity, I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks is alerting the killer
---
It wasnt a leak, It was put in the game. Do you know what a leak is. A leak certainly isn't IN the game. A leak would be here on Reddit.
---
Oh, you're totally right. The new ranking system seems to make both killer and survivors depend on the other side to pip, even more than before. Which makes sense, since it's an interactive game, but it also punishes good players. Killers who 4K too quickly also don't pip, which is ridiculous. If a killer keeps destroying survivors at a certain rank, he should definitely rank up and get out of there.
---

BBQ &amp; chilli(leatherface), hex ruin(hag), a nurse's calling(nurse) and enduring(hillbilly). There are many fun/great perks, but these are my favorites.
---
In the lower ranks it's still pretty easy to rank up as killer. Since the rank reset just happened there's still people that havent climbed out of their reset range. Give it some time and it should balance out. 
---
They had the right idea just bad execution like usual lol
---
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST I DO WITH MY IDEA?
---
Make Your Choice, Nurse's Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse + Any perk you want. BBQ for points if you want to level up more. STBFL for when a trap activates right as you hit someone. Remember Me for end game. Sloppy Butcher to slow the game down more, and is better than ruin in hag imo.
---
Thank you! I'm proud of them
---
Would be satisfying to punch a survivor
---
You know they're arguing in the thickest accents possible. Slang and curse words flying back and forth. 
---
Ninja! 
---
Myers and the Pig give me the best jump scares. Playing Coldwind Farms one game doing a gen and just as I turned to look behind me the Pig came around the corner in a charge about six inches from my character. Perfect combo of sound and timing to make me scream out loud.
---
Its like the trees in The Ashes of Ariendel!
---
LIKE I SAID, MAYBE THERES A WAY FOR YOU TO TELL THE DEVS ABOUT IT. NO IDEA HOW BUT THAT WOULD BE A STEP FORWARD. WHO KNOWS MAYBE YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO MAKE THIS GAME BETTER
---
Damn...didn't even think about that. Blood Warden is so rarely used. Wont make the same mistake again from now on :D
---
Bill has ascended

I read this how that guy in spongebob screams that

That actually sounds like a cool perk

HE NEED SOME PRESTIGE srsly tho p3 piggy is amazing

&gt; -INSIGHTS: Every. Single. Map. In DBD Favors Killers. Even the "Worst" Killer Map has a 55% Kill Rate (Rotten Fields). The Game remains the Most broken map, almost a guaranteed Killer Auto Win with a near 70% Kill Rate
---
INSIGHTS: https://imgur.com/gallery/sOIJDGo
---
Old as fuck list that's no longer relevant and the OP is a biased moron. The Game (Saw map) favors killers? With safe pallets everywhere and two double pallet rooms that lead into each other? Rotten Fields is a "terrible killer map" even though -yes I agree it can be annoying at time to find survivors- there's huge chunks of the map without any pallets or windows and the only way a survivor will get away is if they Dead Hard to a loop, have Instant Heal (obviously), or their team body blocks FTW. That's it. 
---
Terrible OP post. 
---
A leak is intentional
---
i feel that survivors need the speed boost when they become broken, just as they do when they are basic attacked
---
I disagree. Killer is hard as hell to. Shouldn't a 3k be at minimum a 1 pip? Half the 3ks I've gotten don't even safety pip. If I have to get a 4k to pip then remove the damn hatch already and give full hook points for a dc. 
---
actually it make you lose, specially with the new system that decrease your chaser emblem if you camp.
---
Put some clothes on you sicko
---
This brought me tears of joy.
---
You're just going to do it anyways! ( Nicely done, though!! )

Why do you think that? A leak is information trickling out when it’s not supposed to

I would if Reddit allowed me XD

Would depend on the Killer. Any sort of killer that has to actively aim would really suffer for that. Plague, Nurse, Myers, Doc, Huntress, and Billy would be worst off. Trapper, Hag, Legion, and Wraith could probably get away with it but that's about it. 
---
except it's not optimal.
---
"Gen rushing" is a valid strat even at high level. If you tunnel at high level you lose.
---
Lmao new DS powerful! Of course someone extremely bias towards killer would say this. A tunneling perk that doesn’t work whatsoever if the killer equips a widely used perk....get outta here with this shit...lol. It’s supposed to combat tunneling and doesn’t work, how the hell is that powerful.
---
To prevent other situational perks from activating, the killer has to do something. Whether it’s not camping at all or taking out the rescuer first to prevent BT,  not slugging to prevent Unbreakable, killing me before gens are done to prevent Adrenaline. Even Deliverance would require the killer to stand in front of the hook, and outside of end game why would you choose to do that unless the survivor is an Adam I guess. All that’s required to stop DS is simply slapping on an already useful perk. If you don’t see the issue there I don’t know what to say. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.

Bias confirmed lol

First I wouldn't worry too much about "winning" at first. Get used to killer gameplay and practice the basics of chasing and using your killer abilities. 
---
I recommend playing the killers you like at first. Use what you already know about playing survivor to your advantage like, where you would hide, which way you would run, etc.  I would work on chases and tracking first. Patrol gens to find survivors and work on getting a survivor downed.  Don't camp the hook when you get someone down and immediately start gen patrol looking for another survivor to chase.  A lot of skills are just knowing the maps and loops and how to end chases quickly. This comes with practice.  I would also break all pallets that are dropped to close down loops.  
---
Perks that help with chases and tracking that I would use if you have them; BBQ and Chili- lets you see survivor auras after hooking someone and up to 100% bonus bloodpoints; Enduring- reduces stuns from pallets; Brutal strength-pairs well with enduring and breaks pallets faster; nurses calling-lets you see auras of survivors that are healing near you. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
Thats really well done OP
---
See, even if you take the recent rank reset into account, that's what worries me. Competent killers facing average survivors get a 3k/4k quickly and when they do, the system punishes them for being too good. Which is ridiculous because if you're that good, you should definitely rank up instead of destroying lower ranks.
---
This shouldn't even be a shitpost honestly

Hahaha I’m glad someone else’s blood pressure is spiking just as much. I’ve heard heart attacks and DbD are the leading killers of firemen.

Lol did you really just make up a strawman to tear down??
---
I don't have a counterargument to this anymore, if any survivor running dstrike ever said this to me, I'd bring up the fact they're running dstrike, sb, adrenaline and sc. Then they'd argue pointlessly that 'they're not crutches you need them to be good and survive', which is funny because I rarely run self care. But i do use the new ds tho, it's good 
---
camping is a legit strat whether you like it or not dont ridicule someone for their playstyle ya it sucks its a game deal with it
---
There’s been an obsession every game I’ve played in since the patch whether anyone has an obsession perk or not.
---
I had a game where I was trapper and just hanging out with survivors farming playing musical traps. But one survivor got stuck and no one could heal him. I couldnt pick him up. I tried dragging them to exit with pick up vacuum but couldnt get them to escape. I felt so bad. 
---

---
I was playing on cold wind once and we popped a gen. My friend goes “salty look out!” I slowly turn like “huh?” Coming right for my ass was a chainsawing hillbilly with the new tinkerers. I cried. 
---
I’d rather be killer, cause as survivor you can be scared shitless (and fucking killed) but as killer you can only be frustrated when survivors piss you off or have a slight headache when they pallet stun you
---
I was waiting for this
---
That perfect “who’s the killer?”
---
Truly a top tier shit post
---
Claud mains be like.....
---
How did you take this picture, unless you are the hag. You were not crouching lmao
---
OMG your scream made me jump SOOOOOO bad lmao
---
Lol, what. Where's the punchline. 
---
I'm still looking to see if there are going to be a Cult of Dwights gathered at this circle all nodding their heads up and down repeatedly and the killer comes in and goes "What the fuck?" Oh and a Pizza box at the center of the circle would be gold.
---
I called it meta because it is the most efficient way to play. I played tournaments that were based around kills and basically every killer played around proxy camping and tunneling even the pros. I also have played this game for more than 2 hours so yes I diversify my game style and trust me, camping and tunneling is the meta
---
The only time they didn't camp was on spirit and legion. For spirit, it was spirit vs spirit. Legion on the other hand was a huge fucking flop.
---
I didn't camp or tunnel because like I said before I didn't play for kills. I didn't even stay by hooks because chasing full health is a lot more enjoyable than camping or tunneling but it's definitely the weakest way to play
---
You caught me, now give me your liver.
---
man i wish you could hear yourself theres no right or wrong way to play this game and just because someone camps or uses a perk doesnt make them trash they are playing the game they want too its like your saying someone that uses deadhard, sprint burst, self care are trash because they are clutch perks and before you get up in arms that i must be a trash killer ill have u know that im a survivor main
---
Yes it does. 
---
Yes.
---
*gets moried* 
---
Killer main too. Camping is unfun anyway lol. 
---
Or lag switching, that one deserves the camp
---
Yeah, but then your friend who unhooked you is now sick, which means he needs to cleanse himself too, which means now Plague has 2x her corrupt purge, which is very powerful.
---
*happy noise
---
I was obsession last game and the killer had no obsession perks and only one survivor had DS which wasn't me. 
---
Finally, some good fucking food.
---
The whole 'gen rushing' and 'tunneling' back and forth with killers and survivors I feel like started as an over exaggerated accusation for either side to talk shit. 
---
Doing the gens, even if it's fast, is not gen rushing. Just as going for kills isn't tunneling. But if you're letting people lose hook stages for gens or going after only one guy with full intent then that's gen rushing/tunneling. 
---
People just like to throw those around like buzz words to demean people they lost to.
---
New killer foreshadowing?
---
I feel really bad for the solo players too at green and purple ranks. I'm in a weird spot skillwise where I tend to struggle against the typical SWF groups you see at rank 8, but I'll usually 4K against the average solo team from what I can tell. In my past experience, solo survivors and killers like mysd would progress out of purple ranks and have a more even games in red ranks. Now I'm getting punished so hard in normal games and over half of my games are against SWF (I check profiles), so I'm having a hell of a time climbing out of SWF world. 
---
The only way you're ever getting banned for bodyblocking as a survivor is if you trap another survivor for an extended period.
---

---
iirc they changed it so people wouldnt tunnel the ds to get rid of it as quick as possible. Which all it's doing in reality is fucking anyone who doesnt have it because they aren't prepared to be tunneled 
---
Jajaja suck my dick biiiiiiiitch 😂
---
The new system didn't fix any of the existing problems. It still fails to measure actual player skill and fails to match players according to that skill. They've just offset the player base to purple ranks instead of red. Arbitrarily raising the pip threshold does nothing to address the meaninglessness of rank in DBD.
---
Quinten stabs the girl in the movie with an adranaline syringe to wake her up as freddy is about to kill her. Lorewise it makes sense.
---
This is by far the worst patch ever. Unplayable ranking system. Quitters left and right. Worst matchmaking system that for some reason takes 20 min for find the 4th survivor. Uninstalled until "fixed"
---
Yes. I turn the sound up to hear the ambient noises only to be deafened when I enter a chase. Thanks for the tinnitus, Behaviour!
---
How do you find the token in 30 seconds every time?
---
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable 
---
Games should be competitive for both sides.  There's zero counterplay to being hardcamped if you're the one on the hook.  Just a cheap way to crutch out kills man.  Both sides should have a chance each game.  You get way more bloodpoints and easier pip anyways not camping.  More fun too.  It's just a shitty way to play the game on both sides.

I mean someone has to be rank 1 to be paired with the rank 15s...

I haven't been in top form since I started playing then &gt;-&gt;
---
What's weird is when I play Survivor I find myself resenting Killers, and when I play Killer I resent Survivors. Even though I play both and understand what it feels like to be in their shoes, when I'm actually in a match I can only see things from the perspective of the role I'm playing.
---
Okay, but if you run this with Freddy, "Go to Sleep" from Cradle to the Grave needs to become the terror radius
---
Ah, okay. I haven’t been giving any bp to killers - it all goes to Kate since I wanted to get one of her skills for Feng. I’m bad, but I can at least hook people after trying a couple more trials. Thanks for the advice!

Can someone explain why he's called The Shape?

If legion is played in a particular manner it eliminates all counterplay (moonwalking+franks). Can you imagine having thousands of hours on DBD playing survivor, and getting dumpstered by a new player because one of his mechanics is busted. The mechanical problems with his kit have been acknowledged by the devs, but they have yet to do anything about it. By this point many people know of the problems with legion's kit, so many of those who play legion are doing so to intentionally take advantage of what is essentially an exploit. Due to the nature of the interaction it's not obvious from the killer's perspective that there is a problem with the gameplay, so you can't report a legion for exploiting what amounts to a flaw in the games chase mechanics. Nevertheless it removes all skill based counterplay and interaction from the survivor side of the game, making the game unenjoyable.  
---
Despite the problems Legion has, he still isn't considered overpowered. His biggest weakness is gen rushing. While effective, it is extremely boring. The meta solution to countering legion is to let him tunnel down the guy he's chosen to go after, while the other survivors sit there holding m1 and rushing the gens down. There is little meaningful interaction between Legion and the player he's chasing, and even less between the other players. As a result players will often DC the second they see him, knowing that they are likely to have more fun if they simply look for another killer to play against.

It was to keep conquering generals humble

Camping is the absence of a strat.  It's the great equalizer because it's something a first day player can do.  Zero skill involved and boring as shit for both sides.  Learn to end chases fast and pressure the map hard.  Games are way more fun with more bloodpoints and easy pip.

Because that is what Myers was referred to in the original Halloween.  In the credits he is called The Shape and not Michael Myers.

That would be smacking gens, breaking pallets and spooking survivors away from gens.

I know I mentioned NOED as an example, but I don't know why you replied to me talking about NOED when that wasn't the point of my comment.

My best run just a few days ago, my friend could solo 3 gens in the process. Basically I used a loop or L T wall ran the infinite window two times, went back. He pretty much chased me through the whole map. I even ran the shack as much as possible. I didn't have jungle gyms tho, shitty long walls and and L T walls only. I got downed just before the gates were powered and got rancord. He wasn't mad about it so props to him. My friend made it.

Dude, this cosplay is AWESOME (finally a cosplay that isn't from the legion)

Unless I'm mistaken it is due to Carpenter not wanting to give him an identity. Similar to why Laurie was not made his sister until the second movie.

As a low rank killer, it almost makes me feel good to see “brutal killer”. This system both pipping and matchmaking is extremely demoralizing

Next time around you do this you should run tenacity... makes for some hilarious "where did they go" moments. 
---
the killer isnt going to want to smack him then he will get hatch i think he just wants to give up and let the killer have the 4k
---
It's not a clutch. It's a good perk for having fun. It doesn't mean you're bad. I use sometimes just to get reactions at the end. Yet everyone runs with some kind of sprint, SC, DS, adrenaline etc. But those are fair. We should have a NOED day just for the survivors. 
---
Yup... Pisses me off. Especially if they are rank 1-5

Like, why send hate to a rank 10-15 killer when you play with you're 3 other rank 1-5 buddies?

Agreed, "Gen Rush" is a good term for describing a phenomenon, something that occurs due to the way the game is structured. A gen takes 80 seconds assuming no great skillchecks or failed skillchecks, each person can do one in 80 seconds. If your killer can't down someone in less than 90 seconds from the start of the game, you are going to lose HALF of your objectives in the first minute and a half. That's just the way it works at rank 1. 
---
"X killer just gets gen rushed" is a way to describe a killer's lack of pressure or that they take too long to get their pressure going. I'm not blaming the survivors but to claim gen rush doesn't exist is odd...it's been shown by numerous people in numerous places that gen rushing (Or ultra fast games) is a thing and can be reliably reproduced.   
---
Survivors are not toxic for doing it but this is why you see so many Nurse, Billy, Spirit mains at higher ranks because if you want to have a realistic chance of fighting "gen rush", you need more powerful killers who can properly apply pressure and keep them from just doing gens. 
---
I'd rather they make gens take longer and even give survivors some pallets back over what we currently have where it's mostly an arms race between stall (killer perks) and rushing (survivor perks/items). 
---
I don’t think kills is indicative of map favor much like I don’t think surviving a trial means you played well or that you’re a good survivor. 
---
A lot goes into a “kill”. A killer can get 4 kills from one perk alone. Doesn’t mean the map gave them an advantage. 
---
So you’re saying the killer shouldn’t check the logic for a free hook?
---
Some similar happened to me. I went to work on a gen, looked around and nobody was there. As I started working on it, Michael appeared and grabbed me off it. I nearly shit myself, it was not fun
---
Found the hag main
---
And then when you're hooked you can see all three of them UE on the other side of the map
---
It's a reference to a spongebob episode where a circle like on the pic is   a barrier to dangerous bears
---
Then you get the one game with killer running Hangman's Trick. OOF
---
Absolutely that's what I'm saying. That would be zero integrity and honestly survivor killer coop is reportable in game and that is basically a clear cut example of that.  That's like the dicks that you can tell are intentionally trying to block teamates at loops into killer downs.  As a kille that's on you to kill the toxic sandbagger.
---
This is some really low quality shit, dude. Step your meme game up. 
---
Guess you gotta prioritise some stuff and *gasp* risk stuff in a game that deals largely in risks! Who'd have thought.
---
NOED can be disabled before it ever comes into play and taken out as soon as it does. Enduring reduces stuns, it's literally useless in all other aspects of the game. Sprint Burst forces you to walk everywhere or risk not having it when the killer comes. The statements YOU have made are dumb, becuase you clearly don't understand the perks enough to be even making this conversation. And it's obvious you're extremely survivor-sided, and obtuse to boot.
---
I mean, then tunneling doesn't exist either right? I said in another comment, saying gen rushing exists doesn't have to be "blaming the survivors for doing the objective" but more that it's an observation of how absurdly fast gens are.
---
Which means you need a killer who is faster and stronger than most survivors to keep pressure up. Then survivors are annoyed they face the same 3 killers all the time, then killers are annoyed at how most killers are too weak to \*really\* be viable against solid survivors, etc.   
---
Vicious cycle and I really believe it comes from how wildly different the game length can be from game to game. You can have a 5 minute game then load another one that lasts 30 minutes. It makes balance hard. 
---
I like Bill too and Trapper is good but I’m not good at playing them lol
---
Then you should definitely like the new pipping system. No more potatoes in red ranks 
---
I’ve been using it with the Plague while I try to get better with her and even then sometimes everyone gets out! 😫 But survivors have been little bitches since the update/rank reset so I don’t feel bad about using it. 😂
---
And distressing, don’t forget distressing. 
---
Ripping  a person’s face off and wearing it is a misdemeanor in comparison 
---
Very much this. Getting one survivor out of the ASAP is one of the best ways to win as killer. But killers are expected to not do that, even though it's their objective, because it's not fun. And it's not, I'm not disputing that tunneling is super obnoxious.
---
But gen completion time is also obnoxious and it sucks that Ruin feels nearly required (if just to stop the great skillcheck bonuses at this point) on any killer who isn't one of the "big three".
---
I'm not sure uve experienced it from the other side?
---
A killer can only focus on one person at a time. With the right techniques, a chase can go on a pretty long time. And survivors can see or hear a killers coming from a distance.
---
As killer, you might be able to camp a gen or two, but what about the other gens? Even a 3 gen strategy isn't too effective, because it may slow down progression, but the killer has to commit to the chase in order to hook. And you know damn well that survivor is going to lead the killer away from said gens, so others can do it.
---
For survivors, strength is in numbers. Which is y killers sometimes tunnel, mori, or even camp. They have to eliminate someone to even the odds. I don't agree that gen rushing is 90% the killers fault. 
---
I got to the name of the perk and already chuckled loudly on the bus. Good job damnit.

---
No, it's a screenshot from a pic comparing all the killers heights
---
Lol noed can be disabled and DS you could miss. You see how similar they are but you still think they’re on different levels. Like cmon dude.
---
Also a perk that has no downside is just a perk that does something. Really the only perk with a downside is No Mither and maybe like the one where you let the guy get away as a killer I think it’s on Freddy. Anyway, if you’re gonna make that argument you have to specify 
---
You can carry the team as survivor 20k bp and still black pip. One time they hit me once while I already exited and it cost me just enough evader to deny me the emblem and pip. 
---
I agree, honestly
---
You know Paris, France? In English, they pronounce it “Paris,” but everyone else pronounces it without the “s” sound, like the French do. But with Venezia, everyone it the English way, “Venice.” Like The Merchant of Venice and Death in Venice . . . Why though?! Why isn’t the title Death in Venezia?! Are you friggin’ mocking me?! It takes place in Italy so use the Italian word, damn it! That shit pisses me off! Bunch of dumbasses!
---
Ps: not a hag fan, just saw this, thought it was off, thought of the animation, thought “wait a fucking minute or two there *BUCKO*!
---
Fair buff
---
Do survs deserve a pity escape with hatch? 
---
Right, it's an arms race. Devs should honestly look at how the disparity in game time is something that really harms the game right now.
---
You need Billy and Nurse as killer to combat the 5 - 6 minute gen time, other killers simply cannot compete. Survivors are VERY good at doing 5 - 6 minutes for all gens due to facing the above, extremely efficient killers. And the devs just keep balancing the symptoms (weaker DS, more hexes, more "time waster" killer abilities, etc) instead of sitting down to fundamentally bring game times to a more consistent average. Then you can nerf Nurse a bit or buff Freddy because you have a better baseline of how long a game lasts, you can argue that killer X is much too fast or slow at chases.
---
Sure, I can 4k as Trapper if the survivors give me plenty of time to lockdown half the loops. And I can escape 90% of the time if the killer isn't playing one of the big 3. Still not a healthy place imo for game balance.
---
A lot of people are missing what would be a super fun game type here; 2v8

that is called disconnecting before the match starts

---
Tbh, I don't expect the devs to make a pixel perfect hitbox for something as complex as the puke. It's just something that we'll have to deal with.
---
You clearly have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Either that, or you're more obtuse than I thought. DS depended entirely on whether the survivor missed it or not, with no true counterplay on the killer side. Now DS actually has counters to it. NOED has counters to it (what I literally just said in my last post). And a perk that just "does something" doesn't do anything else in any other area of the game.... I already specified everything. You're being thick. I'm done repeating myself here.
---
Not when 3-4 people are running it.
---
We need stricter penalties for disconnecting.

I played back then but I don't remember them being THIS bad....

I didn’t say shit about being top shit, I’m not even a high rank. I made a post about people quitting the game, something you seem all too familiar with. The legion isn’t broken, are they the best killer? Probably not, I also never claimed to be a legion fan, I just so happen to be playing as the legion this particular match. 
---
Get off YOUR high horse acting like you speak for the entire DBD fan base. Plenty of people like the legion, plenty of people hate him. The same could be said about any other killer. I never had malicious intent with my post, just commenting on how it’s shitty when three people in your game quit. You don’t know a thing about me buddy, but from your attitude and conversation with a Reddit stranger I can see you hype yourself up to be a pretentious asshole. 
---
Was 100% ready to see all the logic and reasoning put behind this post so I could disagree.

I managed to get to rank nine just after rank reset, but since the patch update I'm either stuck between 9 with 0 pips or 10 with 4 pips. And some games I've done an equal part to achieve all 4 emblems but the games like 'hah nah'. How good. 
---
They legit just took a regular human model and stretched the corner of the image to make Susie. Her proportions are absolutely disgusting if you actually look at them compared to survivors

It's the "wEll cAn yOu bLaME tHeM!?" posts, the ones trying to drum up empathy for players bitching out of a match and sandbagging everyone. 3-gen Doctor build, NOED Nurse, IR Head Huntress, Freddy + Black Box, killers using an Ebony Mori, any Legion build whatsoever, etc
---
Noed and you were bugging out, I would have just left

The time it takes to get to the fountain, get it, and corrupt purge on someone kinda breaks the flow.  Also you sacrifice the illness part of the power for that time :/

It's the "wEll cAn yOu bLaME tHeM!?" posts, the ones trying to drum up empathy for the players bitching out of a match when they don't like the killer and sandbagging everyone. 3-gen Doctor build, NOED Nurse, IR Head Huntress, Freddy + Black Box, killers using an Ebony Mori, any Legion build whatsoever, etc. I'm even starting to see mid-match disconnects be equivocated here with leaving a lobby, it's getting ridiculous. 
---
Yeah the game won't be balanced until every killer ever always gets a 4k.
---
I only tbag camping tunneling noed users 
---
Good wallpaper thanks!
---
Gives a whole new meaning to "give your girl your wood."
---
I was waiting for this post and I’m not disappointed. Take my upvote. 
---
Dammm Adiris lookin like a tall glass of water 
---
Yeah I know. I just kinda didnt like all of the calling out lol. Theres so much to consider.
---
when he escapes he shouts “Michael Myers is a killer shark in baggy ass overalls!”
---
Deliverance decisive

I Play "Miss Piggy", Where I Stay In The Basement Building/Room All Game &amp; Attack Anyone That Goes Inside &amp; Roar At Them To Leave If They Are Outside. I Have Consistently Gotten A 2K &amp; I Don't Know How
---
Would you tbag a sloppy butcher, nurses calling, bloodhound, iron grasp using wraith?
---
Meanwhile, I had a Legion game where I only got 2 just barely and that was me being optimal as fuck. Was I playing a squad? Possibly. But it could have just been how it goes.
---
But yes, continue to cry and make up bullshit that Legion breaks the game and all killers demand 4K every single time. Just like how survivors never demand that all 4 escape every single time or demand that killers play by their made up rules like a child. It just never happens, right? Cry more. 
---
Alien Dlc leak confirmed...
---
But I got good perks ;-;
---
That’s the crows
---
The game was perfect for me, till the messed up the graphics. 
---
No. 
---
The right direction is terms of balance is to nerf NoED now and doing something to fix the annoyance factor of Legion. 
---
Maybe help solo survivors out because solo survivor gets worse with every update. 
---
But at that point it’s not even gen rushing coz the killer would be stopping it, and the person still dies on first hook. It’s just teammates not having a clue (could all be solo and don’t know that someone else is getting chased tbf).

It's The Last Mask, same as Mother's Dwelling because they're the same realm :)
---
This huntress nerf is insane 
---
Thaaaaaaaaat sucks. And that’s also quite a pickle you got yourself into there...
---
I remember you from previous threads, you’re an Ochido fan boy. Give your flashlight a whirl, you’ll see how strong they are now. 
---
Sprinting Nea wants to know your location.
---
There is nothing else to do as a survivor in the start of the game though, your only purpose is literally doing generators until some other survivor gets hooked
---
Nope . Only perk I'd tbag for is noed. 
---
Face camping isnt a thing killer is just making sure he/she is dead lol
---
I'm not trying to pick on him; Billy is adorable and amazing!
---
I'm just saying he's not a very muscley person.
---
Oh this is brilliant 
---
It's literally a macro meme. It's the lowest of low effort.
---
Of course, got my chase daily anyway. David was a happy hatcher.
---
Epic
---
&gt;No.

Another piss-baby appears. 
---
Yeah,
---
I call it gen rushing when survivors make doing gens a priority. There's a huge difference between a normal pub match where players might wander, cleanse totems, open chests, or overall just be dunces vs a pro team like bombsquad powering exit gates within 4 minutes of the match starting.
---
I don't call it toxic, I just have to identify that survivors are actually doing gens and sorta amp up my normally lax play style to match the speed at which their doing objectives. So an example is I can't commit to a chase any longer than a minute if survivors are rushing gens.
---
tldr it is "doing the objective" but it's like the difference like doing hw due in a week vs due 5 minutes
---
You're about 2 days late.
---
I'll check it out in kyf .
---
I've surpassed Ochido in terms of toxicity, don't you agree?
---
Luigi Wins By Doing Absolutely Nothing! (sitting in the locker)
---
Ay man np
---
I play Killer and Survivor
---
They look like GMod NPCS that are idling 
---
This is good advice, thanks! Maybe I'll try killer again...
---
Yeah this is the ps4 leak that everyone was going crazy about the day of the patch. It's the Evil dead chapter.
---
&gt;you get face camped, dragged to the basement, and mori'd a lot.
---
aka the solo survivor experience
---
Lmao
---
Damn cheap rewards. Glad we have "better" dailies
---
See you in the fog ;*
---
You poor thing
---
I love how people find shit like this and think they are the first one to do it. 
---
You know survivors wanna have fun too you know?
---
LOOOL I'M DEAD by daylight player
---
To op for SWF
---
Get hit by as many pallets as possible to you can hear her cute squeak. 
---
Hilarious
---
HALLE-FUCKING-LUJAH!
---
Hmm... I've tried each of these strategys separately, but not together. Very interesting, I think I like this. Im going to try it out today:
---
Own a controllable part of the map.
---
Thin the heard by picking off those that are less good, or in an inconvenient position.
---
Eliminate pallets, (especially at chosen area of map), so it's easier later.
---
Each chase is its own game. If a survivor evades you for too long. They won that round, suck it up and move on. There will be another opportunity elsewhere.
---
I like this combo, I will give it a few go's. 
---
hahahah I want you as my teammate
---
but how long has Adrenaline given that effect? because if its been since Freddy got released, u gotta know Freddy wasnt always this bad
---
&gt;We need ~~stricter~~ penalties for disconnecting
---
There's literally no penalty right now, it's ridiculous. 
---
I play killer cause I have no friends, when I play survivor I feel alone :( 
---
They've already announced the new killer, Giant Nea
---
Should’ve noticed you were a troll by your name. 
---
I think insta heals are fine. If they're going to look at anything, I'd rather they look at keys (which are complete bullshit) and ebony moris (same thing). Buff the weakest killers, tweak the high tier ones, make some more perk improvements, and I think the game is pretty fun on both sides.
---
Either they should make it more usefull when you are the last survivor alive or they should make it less powerfull, but not everyone needs to be dead to use it
---
Oh, yikes.
---
Zac from League of Legends DLC? 
---
Last time I played this game was last summer. Just started playing again casually and The Purge/Legion both seem ridiculously annoying and op. I’m not sure if this is just that I’m not accustomed to them or they are legit overtuned but I haven’t beat one of them yet. I’ve probably played around 20ish games and only played against non Purge/Legion killers 4 times, those 4 I was able to escape.
