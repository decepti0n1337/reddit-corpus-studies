Why would respawn announce anything relating to dbd?
---
---
---
Legion is only bad when using his cheese addons and does the cheese walk
---
I didnt mind the 'seven seconds fedora man bad lol' meme that much, as I knew that it would cause dumbass survivors to be cocky when playing against me. Now that the meme is reworking my favourite killer, im fucking pissed.
---
u/chattywindow  made all these edits
---
You wouldn't buff him at all? I can respect that.
---
now I get why so many people want Shirtless Mike
---
Yeah, but that doesn't make it a good perk for her. It's the same as saying WoO is good for beginner survivors: doesn't make it a good perk
---
As killer, once you see 3 red lights you know interrupts are mostly impossible because there's less than 5 seconds left. So I'm saying it's not really a factor in the scenario.
---
I've been thinking about the way F13 does it, where (IIRC) campers can't run for too long without eventually losing steam and having to walk. Survivors in DBD should have something similar; nobody can run forever without stopping.
---
Shouldn't the people who play the killer the most and like him the best out of all the others have a say in it?
---
But they will start to run away either way if they hear the humming.
---
Do people actually bitch about a killer not using his power lol
---
That's actually not bad.
---
Reddit dude, anyone that doesnt think freddy is garbage gets downvoted.
---
Yea nobody is getting out of that basement
---
"I feel at home here..."

[removed]
---
Survivor main, ladies and gentlemen!
---
His rework may be cool, but the problem is is that it will probably fundamentally change his playstyle, which I hate. I main Freddy because I love his playstyle of spreading the pain and hit and run, and I'm scared that BHVR will rework him into being a shitty chase killer.
---
Some players get annoyed if the killer doesn't try hard enough, they also get annoyed if the killer tries too much. They just like being angry
---
He's just standing there... menacingly
---
That is literally stupid, that‚Äôs the point of bloodlust
---
Killers already have bloodlust. Just fix broken loops on some maps, the majority of loops are fine.
---
LOL no. Learn what pallets are safe and unsafe, break the safe pallets.
---
No loops are broken in the first place
---
thank you so much üòä
---
It ruined my game and I just got the spirit too
---
but with hex ruin every good gives no points and gets rid of some progress
---
Legion cosplay is the equivalent to dva facepaint and her one piece suit. Change my mind.
---
That‚Äôs all the survivors have to get away from the killers. With your logic used you pretty much want a small open field with 5 generators and hooks everywhere. No buildings, rocks or anything
---
Big oof
---
Could have just said you like using noed
---
She actually looks human for once lmao
---
Not sure if it's a way to "speed up" endgames.  That's not what the game needs right now.
---
You're something of a legend, you know that?
---
Are you okay? That ‚Äúremove loops‚Äù was sarcasm btw. Majority of loops are fine.
---
If plague has corrupt purge she can one shot the injured surv and injure the other.  Then easily down the other.
---
Oh stop... you'll make me blush...
---

---
^Go ^on
---
You need that much extra help?
---
dude's gotta camp when a dude's camp. I back him ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if a toxic survivor wants to play hard to get, I'll play hard to get rid of.
---
What are you? A shitty detective?
---
[**I saw here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gyimahk/comments/bcx7vl/99shopcitycom/)

I‚Äôm fine, just getting annoyed with 98% of killers bitching on reddit about not being able to get kills because of loops or pallets or literally anything they can think of bitching about

Nah, just getting it out there. 
---
I'm not too concerned with what you think about it. 
---
But, if you wanna keep on making assumptions, have at it. 
---
I know how some folks just loooooove to drum up drama.
---
Keep on, pumpkin.  ;)
---
Legion is poorly designed though, I have yet to see anyone give ample reason otherwise.
---
Yes really.
---
Damn straight. 
---
Glad someone gets it.
---
Freddy can benefit of unsafe rescues since he can double the pressue (but im not saying his defense is any good, i agree with his defense being one of the worst)
---
Makes it harder for the killer to patrol, and the killer will feel safer.
---
I'm not saying it's satire in the slightest.
---
You aren't listening, and I've become bored worth you.
---
You simply don't get it, and I don't have the time nor the inclination to sit here and incessantly repeat myself and explain it to you.

The others get it.

Read what they said.

At this point, you're not even talking about the OP.
---
Be gone, trash survivor!
---
I'm not the most experienced with her, but I love monitor and abuse mixed with whispers so you can check gens without exposing you are close until they hear the haunting sound. Mix with BBQ, hex ruin, or make your choice is beautiful. Still determining the best mix between those 3 perks.
---
Thank you! Stop taking shit so seriously, you come across as a dickhead. Nobody gives a shit about where Feng got her flashlight but thanks for trying to interrogate her for the good of the community.
---
Alright, let's go point-by -point
---
* We don't know what the changes will be, don't shit your pants just yet.
---
* Nurse can go through obstacles and down in 2 hits, true. However Nurse requires skill to get that down while Legion can tunnel you into the ground and/or abuse breaking chase and requires no real skill to get it.
---
* I'm fine with the Legion in theory, as a killer that attacks multiple people and "spreads the pain", but the way the power works is that if you try that you'll lose and everyone goes to tunneling strats. Maybe that's what the rework will address, gonna wait to see.
---
* Frank's is bullshit, Iridiescent heads gives you only 1 and 3 if you use a very rare infantry belt ( it's also neutered by any map with a lot of walls and the pinky finger requires you to directly hit the survivor with the bottle. Both of those have counters
---
* Billy's saw i agree with and I'm fine if they reduced his move speed when he revs, similar to Bubba's. Don't feed the Myers and keep breaking LOS, or jump in a locker if he tiers up. Nurse I have stated doesn't need more than 2 blinks, they can get rid of those for all I care.
---
* Freddy was nerfed near immediately while Legion they took there time before doing anything big. Once again, wait til you see what the changes are.
---
...........
---
Imagine complaining so much about long queues that you get shit matchmaking, and then complaining about shit matchmaking so you now have to settle with long queues.
---
I'm gonna start screenshotting every time I see a complaint about long queue times and compile them up at the end of the year
---
Toxic killer main! Gets called out and has to throw insults
---
As if being able to break a chase isn't a thing.
---
As a prestige 1 pizza dwight, this puts a smile on my face
---
Not vs a good killer. Not everyone plays p3 Claudette, dude.
---
Noice.
---
judging by how you have NO idea what I'm talking about and these made up rules you have, you are 100% a survivor main.
---
Here's the thing - I play both side. Main Claudette, main Pig. And when I'm Claudette, you wouldn't catch me dead (pun intended) acting a completely tactless fool to a killer. It's just plain rude. But its obviously acceptable to you because you're an edgelord, P3, crutch/exhaustion perk, sad about DS nerf, flashlight, toolbox SWF. tell me I'm wrong.
---
Nobody cares what you do in game, nobody cares that if you get teabagged you will face game them, nobody cares if a survivor loops you into a dead zone that you‚Äôll slug them and make sure they die. Nobody cares your a toxic killer
---
Reporting DCs does nothing because it's an automated system, also there is still a DC bug happened to my friend about 5 hours ago
---
Then maybe you just need to get better. Nobody said anything about p3 Claudette, dude.
---
You're still going?
---
Sheesh - this post really irritated you, huh?
---
Actually I like the power though grappling would be weird I think. The perks aren‚Äôt that great, shadows due twice honestly would be better for the survivor since you‚Äôd still have to catch them the first time and then when they come back, the 15% penalty doesn‚Äôt really offset the time you spent catching them unless you make it apply to the whole, though that would just make it a way stronger dying light. Mikiri counter would also be too strong since that‚Äôs just the enduring spirit fury combo into just one perk but without the conditional pallet breaking of spirit fury. The middle perk is cool though and the red light being smaller would be useful for mindgaming in general.
---
I think you're close, but need to be less focused on what the perk actually does and more focused on things that create similar ideas
---
Examples l thought of:
---
When you are nowhere near a toilet then feel the burritos kick in: **Sprint Burst** 
---
When you unplug your modem for 30 seconds and the internet starts working again: **Technician**
---
When you feel hungry and remember that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers and you grab them off the pot in your kitchen: **Botany Knowledge**
---
If this isn't already at the top of the list then I don't know what would be.
---
Maybe you need to get better in chases instead of suggesting stupid shit?)
---
Yeah, I don't think it works either, but eventually it might, so I'm gonna keep on keepin on till it does I suppose.
---
I play both, legion and Jeff get your facts lined up before you take your shot Phillip. I don‚Äôt use ds nor a flashlight, very seldom do I run a toolbox. Not a prestige at all no point behind it in anyway. Plays both solo and swf depends on if I have friends online. So try again though guy lets go for round 2, you lost that one
---
That‚Äôs the great part about legion, you don‚Äôt have to go out and blow hundreds of dollars. Relatively easy, and looks good üëç

No legit the Devs have stated reporting DCing isn't doing anything but filling up the report queue, they just throw out the reports because they already have an automated system that bans after 20-25% DC rate

---
The 20-25% might not be the most accurate, it was 35% 6-12 months ago but it's been lowered since then and that's all we know
---
Nope, since no licensed character besides Ash has more than their default outfits and Prestige skins
---
I just told a twitchy today that he was gonna get tunneled and then Mori‚Äôd. Well wouldn‚Äôt you know it that is exactly what happened
---
Looks nice
---
These don't seem terribly overpowered but they are a little powerful, thats why they are pink ranked. Also killers have pink mori's soooooo...
---
That looks like a LOT of work, but the end result 100% looks worth it. It looks exactly like the in-game version. Well done!
---
Either ‚Äúlegion bad‚Äù or shirtless myers
---
F
---
So a built in Franks plus a movement speed boost. Either your a special strawberry or there is an /s somewhere in here.
---
Nobody's calling it a "stupid fix" except you, dude. And I've said before that I don't have a problem with it. No backpedaling here. You sound like a fool.
---
Why are you here. And he‚Äôs already a bad killer without the broken addons, so they have to give home something after they nerf him
---
I‚Äôve always been curious, how do you and your fellow trolls fail to cringe when using emojis?
---
Very well written comment. I think the problem with the game currently is the way some play it. You see the same thing in League, Overwatch, and all multiplayer games to some extent. Instead of experimenting with the game and trying what works for them, they just copy their favorite YouTuber, streamer, or pro player and a meta forms. All perks/characters that don't reinforce (or exceed) the meta are immediately deemed trash and discarded. Kinda sad, honestly.
---
Yes but can you imagine Dwight having a 12 pack of abs under his shirt
---
Wrong about Doc. If he's in treatment, he can literally spam M1 and the moment someone tries to do a fake out save you grab them. No swinging, no missing, just a precise and unavoidable grab. I'd put him above LF here simply because LF can fuck up and get himself stunned, whereas against Doc there's literally nothing you can do.
---
Fair. I just want to stop loops to loops to loops that eventually last 5 gems worth of time.
---
When he is acting like he‚Äôs trying to keep his drink down makes me crack up everytime
---
You need to learn how to read. Everything here benefits survivors. Get over yourself.
---
Why do you suggest you ‚Äúfix‚Äù if you don‚Äôt have problems with looping, is that question too hard for you to answer?)
---
But legit tho what are these crutches you speak about, enlighten me
---
Probably gen tapping like i always get when i solo Q.
---
True but you get some games where the skill check comes up every 2 seconds and if you ain‚Äôt hitting it you regressing that gen allot. Now since they did the little bit of console optimization it‚Äôs been allot better on being able to hit them!
---
Damn right
---
I think they're just *ok* at best with no broken addons or mechanics being used.
---
Regardless they're still mega unfun to play against since they require the killer to basically just hold forward and vault stuff. Super braindead.
---
They look cool tho
---
Because I think it could be made better. Nice jumping from point to point since you don't have an argument anymore. I think I'm done responding to your rambling.
---
127 seconds anyone?
---
If you focus on pipping you‚Äôll lose the fun of the game very fast. This is why I barely play nowadays.
---
By ‚Äúbetter‚Äù you mean ‚Äúeasier for killers‚Äù. Strange that someone who is good at looping would want that ü§î
---
Can I suggest queuing frequent DCers with other frequent DCers? I have seen this idea bounced around in other games where cheaters were priority queued with other cheaters.
---
Nobody is trying to silence you. You're just entitled and impossible to please. I also don't remember seeing you here defending Killers when this game heavily favored Survivors. This game is more balanced than it's ever been, and the concurrent players are still high. Take your bullshit back to the official forums where you can circlejerk about this in relative peace.
---
Learn what pallets to break, how to play certain tiles, force pallets, stop respecting pallets, learn mind games and know what chases to take and what ones not to. Though I do think the new pallet changes were completely unnecessary, looping isn't a big issue for me as a killer. It takes some time yes, but eventually you get the survivor. Sometimes a survivior is just too good or a loop is going to take too much time so I just accept that and give up the chase, can't with them all.
---
Did you seriously just "I'm rubber, you're glue" me?
---
Jesus, you're lame. 
---
This is the last time I'll reply because this is seriously boring me, and I'm not playing your silly little troll games, so keep posting to your heart's content and play your games. And, at the end of the day, I'll be smiling knowing I'm done with this ignorance, and that you're still sitting there pining over my post, so desperate for me to reply that you just can't help but send some other smarmy message, and left unsatisfied when I don't reply again. I'll be smiling, and you'll be all butt hurt over a Reddit post about a video game.....lol....ah, I already feel much better. 
---
Have a good one, Scooter, and good luck with all that BS you're shoveling. I'll be looking forward to your desperate post here in a few, and just know I'll be laughing the second I see it. LOL
---
Whenever I see these it's kinda eh
---
DC's snowball. If I'm in a game and someone dc's early on, I probably am too. I don't wanna play a 3 man 5 gen game.
---
Then since I dc'd, someone else probably will too. Then you're just left with one person who is also likely to dc.
---
Did you not see John wick 2? That's the girl he fights in that movie

The age range of this toxic community has gotta be ages 7-16. None of you can make up any of your own insults or comebacks. It‚Äôs either you call someone a troll or say they live with their parents. Is that really the best you can do?
---
It‚Äôs something to make the endgame have more to do, or otherwise have more depth than it currently has. No actual idea what it is.
---
Legion will most likely get the Freddy treatment honestly. They are almost universally hated and will probably get gutted. Which this subreddit will celebrate.
---
I love scrolling to the bottom of these posts to read these ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
You.. you serious? Big lmao
---
Wow. Yes you really want a balanced game, enjoyable for all... apparently u are ok with survivors lagging and being it in impossible ways.
---
Ok, at least you took off the mask.
---
Thanks for answering the question (wait a second...), and I said troll because tbh most of the time people use emojis that is exactly what they are doing.
---
If he has Remember Me at max stacks with the obsession dead, all survivors are healthy, and one is already asleep, the end game is over. You simply do not escape unless he lets you. If they try to wake up you now have the location of 2 of them. If they don't try to wake up, you can see the sleeping survivor and prevent them from doing anything and find the others. 3 man endgame Freddy is rough. If he has Class Photo that's a GG
---
Or everyone is playing survivor. Console killer is a struggle already, and the toxic kids don't help. The BM on console is so much worse than PC. I'm just glad there's no end game chat at least.
---
Thats actually funny.
---
i'll dc if i saw a legion and nothing will change that
---
Yeah, they are her default outfits, the same way Quentin has his long sleeve and short sleeve outfits, and how Tapp has his cop and detective outfits
---
There is so much anti-legion pro-DC bullshit in this sub its impossible to tell the difference. Sorry for not seeing the dark blue in a field of black
---
In all fairness, there is zero indication of either players' rank..
---
Hey, great cosplay! How did you manage to do the mask?
---
I honestly thought I was the only one.
---
Did you vomit on them?
---
Yeah but the survivor is letting him hit em. The killer would expect more after the torture.
---
Looping and pallets are survivors' only means of buying time. Learn to run tiles.
---
People genuinely believed that they don't care and aren't going to fix anything and are all false promises. Shit takes time, and you have no idea what kind of changes and improvements they are making.
---
And before you say 'well they should let us know' - if they get half way through a new feature, announce it, and then find out that it just isn't working and need to go back to the drawing board, Ya'll will raise your fucking pitchforks and leave your snotty ass negative review. I know this isn't everyone but this reddit is so negative towards the devs and I hate it. Good to see a brief moment of positivity.

lmao bruh

Don't get your hopes up until the changes go live. Until then, there's every chance the rework will be bugged to shit or just a bad idea in general.

dumbest function: seeing the killer‚Äôs ‚ÄúsEcReT‚Äù offering before the game starts. Guarantee a DC before the map loads, or quick suicides upon first hook.
---
He isn‚Äôt op
---
*UwU
---
OP is a bad teammate.
---
You're wasting pallets, bringing the killer close to generators, and making it harder to win.
---
I don't think he's considered op, it's just that he's so annoying that not fun to play against him.
---
Thank you for the credit! I've greatly underestimated how horny the DBD fanbase is.
---
He's still D/F tier just really fucking annoying
---
Hey guys I really hate _____ but *proceeds to do the thing they claimed to hate*
---
Sure is fun to grind for absolutely nothing
---
Then don‚Äôt body block like a little bitch lmao
---
I was gonna be disappointed if I didn‚Äôt see this comment haha
---
Body blocking is toxic. Face camping is also toxic. 2 wrong don‚Äôt make a right. If you want to play the game of toxicity then all is fair. Just my 2 cents.
---
I'm just gonna take a wild guess and say you're the Wraith I played against
---
If there's grass, then you can counter it. If not, than oof
---
she isnt OP
---
she is annoying there is a difference
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you see he is really good at tunneling players so she will always win a chase 
---
but in that time any half decent players will be done most of the gens 
---
so like leather face its a weak killer who is good at one aspect of the game everyone hates
---
leather face is good for camping
---
legion is good for tunneling
---
It's always the Wraiths.
---
Teach her the wonders of sterilizing equipment
---
It really is, isn't it?
---
No since all games now have a disclaimer that you sign in the Eula stating if you have any conditions that might cause a seizure that you should not play the game. I remember back in the day when all that nonsense started and the game devs put a warning that would load up when the game started saying this and it freed them from any liability. So if you are epileptic you shouldn‚Äôt be playing any video games or watching certain types of Japanese anime. Remember when the simpsons did a episode about it?
---
It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs kinda a weird question to ask. Lol it‚Äôs like if I went to the apex legends subreddit and was like ‚Äúnothing against heterosexuals but why so many straights play this game??‚Äù
---
I do this because I can‚Äôt get into a fuckin game due to the longest of wait times on PS4. Rip
---
It's pretty difficult to use tbh. It's very jukable if you aren't just camping pallets or running in a line.
---
Just need some greasepaint and a shave, commit to the bit
---
Body blocking is not toxic, his dumbass should had hit you eariler instead of wondering why he couldn't hook.
---
Exactly! Finally, someone gets it.
---
Thanks! My mind went to ending the game. So glad it's not that
---
Username checks out
---
It‚Äôs either a bad time, or farming time
---
It's a new glitch people found
---
Also why do you have 1 mill blood points, use them
---
That is odd then. I dunno, it's an odd bug. I don't even know what causes it (don't want to know either, I'll live in bliss as I haven't experienced it yet)
---
Flair is the best part of this comment haha
---
Body blocking is a free hit. How is it toxic? You get a stack even for WGLF. The game wants you to do it.
---
wild glitch. also i'm hoarding them let me live my life
---
tunneling is when you chase a survivor for any amount of time
---
I main Spirit and knowing how she works can really make juking her easy if you know where she's coming from and the environment you can adapt to and use to trick her. Having perks like Poised, Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, and Iron Will can really screw with her too.
---
Was kinda funny ngl
---
Practice great skill checks, after a while you can hit them pretty consistently
---
My view on NOED will always remain the same. Its not. Fun.
---
But there's no point. 1 million is the cap so you are just playing for no reward
---
I absolutely HATE immediate unhooks. 
---
But to be fair, sometimes it's necessary in certain situations.
---
same thing just happened to me, except i was the only surv who was aware of the 2nd killer. apparently the others could only see the doctor even though there was also a nurse. i know this because she killed my ass lmao.
---
What would you say is the best way to counter the Ironworks loop with her?
---
They are majestic
---
Although my top post at this time is downvoted I seriously really do suggest you just play it that way. Yeah it does suck when someone is annoying but you also have to factor in your own enjoyment. You did buy the DLC, and you did buy the game. Remember that.
---
Tldr...
---
gg
---
But usually a bad time. Most killers have 0 sympathy if 3 dcs happen.
---
Imagine getting offended by someone spamming the crouch button...
---
Yeah. Totally isn't like Freddy is a good and viable killer who was memed to death. He'd be better with just a buff.
---
Lizards are legit af
---
üòÇü§£üòäü§£üòÇüòÇ The thought of every Legion bringing in P.S. just to keep the survivors his absolutely HILARIOUS!!!
---
They‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs either people thinking that annoying=OP or people immediately thinking of Legions with Frank‚Äôs+Stab Wounds Study or Nasty Blade+Filthy Blade. Legion is probably the worst Killer in the game who just happens to have two broken add-on combos.
---
Bart is me
---
It‚Äôs not though, blocking the killer from hooking is being a good teammate
---
Yes YES
---
I‚Äôd go with whispers instead of ruin. But that‚Äôs just me
---
How dare you try to help your teammate I hope you get banned. I'm appalled.
---
Killing is toxic and cheating, and should be bannable.

---
Nothing does her dirtier than Iron Will....
---
So, the game becomes a 3v1? 5 gens still have to be completed?
---
Also, you're no longer running from the killer or playing against the killer so it turns into a completely different game? You have your own little mini game down below? Doesn't sound like you're playing DND anymore at that point

I don't get it. I don't play Legion and I rarely play Survivor so I don't really get to experience the game with Legion I all. But I remember this sub saying that Legion was a bad killer and totally underpowered when he was released. Then it seems the sub did a 180 and survivors say he's literally impossible to play against or something? I don't know.
---
There are some killers that are worse on console than pc, but I wouldn't say any killers are better on console than pc. Freddy is just a super weak killer. That's why a lot of people complained. He's also unfun to play as/go against.
---
That‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôre *good*. If they play that way, they‚Äôre definitely assholes and impossible to beat, but the killer is viable. 
---
If you don‚Äôt play that way, downing someone becomes incredibly hard and there‚Äôs no chance you‚Äôll really get anything done. 
---
Poorly designed killer in every aspect
---
But if you're a skilled Huntress it you only reloads about a second faster. It's for baby Huntress's that can't hit their hatchets during chase.
---
All I can assume is a shrinking play area
---
Thrill, thrill, thrill!!! Use thrill of the hunt. Also use totem favored maps...
---
Totally agree with above. If you‚Äôre going to run any other hex perk I‚Äôd make it Thrill of the Hunt. Then you can at least know when someone is touching either totem.
---
Also, don‚Äôt make the mistake most killers make and go straight for your totem at the start of the game. When I play survivor and see a killer make a beeline for a particular area of the map for no reason, well guess I‚Äôm going to go cleanse that totem you‚Äôre checking on.
---
Thats.... fucking incredible. i love the clown. i want one!
---
They had a patch recently but didn't  fix this.
---
It displays the newest characters that you don't have, although I'm not sure what it displays when you have everyone.
---
LMAO
---
"Oh Hello Naughty! Are those survivors starting those noisy generators and keeping you up? How about you have a chat with those inconsiderate people"
---
Even if I dotha I still feel stressed
---
They're still weak just annoying to verse. It also doesn't help when half or more of your team DCs instantly.
---
üíÄ
---
Except ive had them since they came out.
---
The shape is fun. He is good for some jump scare builds :)
---
Trapper is lonely and just wants a friend.
---
The shape is really fun to play that's the first dlc killer I got. But it's up to your play style to be honest.
---
But is he really weak though? In my experience he‚Äôs not. I literally went from a mostly average killer to 4ks almost every round. If it wasn‚Äôt for this subreddit allowing me to learn the communities opinion of Freddy, I would have guessed the reason for the rework was do to an issue with being overpowered.
---
I‚Äôd recommend Stridor, makes haunting mid chase more viable
---
I don‚Äôt thing people give up items, offering, exp, and bloodpoints for a trend. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt want to play against him lol.
---
I know i just want your opinion so It can help make me a decision.
---
My pc broke before I got to play dbd on it and I‚Äôm currently to poor to fix or get a new one. If what you say is true I regret that I won‚Äôt get to test my Freddy against superior survivors and know where he truly sits.
---
these are the same pictures
---
100 times better than this annoying dude who posts his Legion videos and thinks he is the hottest shit out there
---
What makes him better?
---
oooooh, that's pretty
---
Making assumptions isn't wise. It's more likely going to be a timer of some sort so survivors can't sit immersed in the map to dick around after they have obviously won already. The end game is shit for killers, if you could see beyond your NOED hate boner you'd understand that.
---
It would be cool if there was a naughty bear killer in the game
---
Isnt he? üéÉ
---
Alrighty thanks for your input.
---
Just a funny mistake, the phrasing without on made the sentence sound a little different than usual.
---
 so is he overpowered or underpowered?
---
Hopefully something that makes the game end quicker. I don't run NOED because it isn't worth a perk slot, so if the gens are powered I'm ready for the match to end immediately.
---
Well when i play him survivors try and hide poorly. While on pc the just run to pallets
---
HaV nEvR sEeN dIs TyPe Of PoSt

---
Billy with NOED, went down trying to get him off of someone else and this is where I ended up
---
Dwight came in like a fucking hero though, unhooked, and Keyed our way to safety
---
Thank you all for your input, much appreciated.
---
Bodblocking in the basement or a survivor bodyblocking another survivor so they cant move, yes. Bodyblocking so the killer can't get to the hook, no.
---
Ahaha, exactly! PLUS, the totem x_x

---
Nice
---
Yeah I suppose so. Freddy took me to rank one so I‚Äôm played all levels with him. Red ranks definitely tend to know how to counter him better but maybe the surprise still throws them off. I really wish I could play Freddy in pc and truly test his mettle. Unfortunately my pc will remain broken until well after his rework so I‚Äôll never know the truth of it.
---
Just that annoying feeling when the killer is smart and break chase and legit not even 1 minute later someone else is down
---
I usually try not to bitch too much about legion, but since you asked I'll list a few things that make me not want to face them. This will obviously  be highly subjective.
---
- Legion's Power can easily be exploited by the killer player. Once they hit a survivor with it, they can turn their back towards the survivor and keep chasing backwards. The game will think the survivor broke chase and the mend timer will start. Once the power is back up, the survivor is guaranteed to go down, there is literally zero counter play to this exploit  (except pressing alt+f4)
---
- Speaking of counterplay, even when playing against a non-exploiting legion, it often feels as if your skill as survivor doesn't matter, since they can just vault over windows and pallets and are way faster than you are. 360 a smack, or even two in a row, it doesn't  matter. The attack during their power has no cooldown, so the killer player doesn't get punished for whiffing, unless they do it like 5 times in a row and their power runs out (this usually  never happens) I don't like having all of my agency in a chase removed
---
-Legion barely takes any skill to play. My previous statement somewhat also applies to a very good nurse player, but you at least gotta git gud with her first which will take quite some time. Not for legion though, they are plug &amp; play.
---
-Some of Legion's addons are giga broken right now, this is another exploit. I don't know too much about that one, since I haven't had it in my game yet, but - as far as I understand, it makes it so you take forever to mend
---
You may also wanna watch [this](https://youtu.be/oExzT4O0Ap8) to see the exploit in action
---
That is just based on how good survivors are. It does not make Freddy better on console.
---
Consider or try out Spine Chill. It fits my* play style.
---
Listen!
---
It hs saved me so many times or at least given me time to start running.
---
It gives me a heads up on killers like Wraith, Freddy (I hate this killer the most), and Spirit.
---
Also helps in juking the Nurse sometimes*.
---
And allows me to know if and when I might have lost a killer through "line of sighting" them.
---
I know this feeling and goddamn is it satisfying when the rage actually works out.

I only want a shorter timer and no pallet stuns when not fully asleep.
---
Agreed!!!!
---
slow the game down ‚Äújust a little bit‚Äù

Rank 21 is leaking

Practicing moonwalking, sorry bro
---
From my viewpoint Freddy doesn‚Äôt need any change but I could live with that.
---
The words ‚Äúcomplete rework‚Äù strike terror into my heart
---
Then you get hooked and find all 3 of those knuckleheads together, on a generator but still somehow getting nothing done.
---
Billy with NOED, went down trying to get him off of someone else and this is where I ended up, at the hatch AND NOED Totem.
---
I don't need a medal to know that I'm cool 
---
&gt; . &lt; Sorry for being cringy I'm just so booored
---
When you hear the chase music start so you look behind and Santa Claus is strutting his fat ass towards you.
---
Adding a cosmetic store was a huge boon for this game.
---
I mean logic wise he rite tho.
---
Dudes gotta have powerhouses for legs
---
The best part is he‚Äôs WALKING. Talk about peak physical condition. I strive to be just like the Clown when I grow up.
---
There are ways to use mechanics to play up both immersion and horror aspects, but this game doesn't do that.  Action is the most optimal way to play (being chased, dropping pallets) compared to never being seen (and the difficult part being the finding not the chase on the killer's side).
---
U could use Spirit‚Äôs Haunting Grounds to make fake totems. TOTH is also very spicy on Hex centered builds but always leave a non hex perk just in case. ( Exception being NOED because duh)
---
It doesn't look for horror like though.
---
they are ridiculous as they stand now, I can vault a window and get 2-3 steps in before they somehow manage to hit me from the other side of the window. Why should it be EASIER for them to hit people at windows in the first place? They are one of our only ways to break chase with the killer and they already have a system in place to stop you from abusing a window.
---
This is gonna sound stupid but I have to ask, why is Legion hated? I‚Äôm just getting back into the game and I‚Äôve taken a look at him and don‚Äôt understand his appeal except for his perks.
---
Find someone who looks at you like Tilted Myers does.
---
You keep track of where they are, you stay split from your team so deep wound doesn't effect multiple, if found you B-Line to the nearest pallet and bait out the frenzy and go for a stun, you take advantage of the no scratch marks when in Frenzy, if you get stabbed and they try to moonwalk you run towards them to restart the chase. You can't treat Legion like any other killer. You need to stay aware of where they are, keep the distance as much as possible so Frenzy won't be able to catch you and if they are determined enough to get you then you use the tools you have at your disposal to waste as much of their time as possible. I'm a pretty meh survivor but I can keep a legion busy in a 3-4 gen chase fairly regularly on most maps if I'm not caught off guard. It's not impossible in the slightest.
---
Thank you!!  I appreciate it!
---
I never understood why people think pallet looping and shit is "toxic". If its the only way we can survive, yeah we're gonna do it. Unless the survivor is sitting there just t-bagging and taunting you and being a total dick with it then no, they aren't being toxic.
---
that survivor that misses the flashlight save but still follows the killer to unhook you before they even turn around
---
that billy that laughs in evil then smacks you and chainsaws them
---
Little tip I used to get it done without prior planning: After rank reset (especially at lower ranks) you'll occasionally get games with those afk bot killers who just repeatedly M1. An indication they are going to be doing this if during lobby they keep going ready/not ready every 3 seconds or so.
---
If you see this happening it might be worth bringing a skeleton key that opens dark locks. Once you confirm killer is afk - message the others. This is how I got it :-)
---
Idl about you, but 6/10 times the killers always camp or hard patrol.
---
What he means to say is nice work I couldn‚Äôt have done better but I‚Äôm going to criticize you anyway apparently
---
Exactly, I completely agree.
---
Lmao
---
Painful
---
Understood
---
Honestly. I was waiting for the twist in the first one to be him referring to the survivors as the monsters and that he had been bullied as the killer
---
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahaha
---
That's a fair point, I just felt sorry for them when 3 survivors stepped on the same bear trap 3 times each
---
Was it the bloodweb glitch event?
---
[That was actually the original idea.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b7424y/i_just_realized_the_game_naughty_bear_was/) I mean, this is basically a weekly thing for me now, but we gotta remember where we started. I already know who the next Killer will be.
---
&gt; As for Mettle of Man, we have been closely monitoring feedback for it since it was released and passing it on to the design team. We don't have an update for this just yet and we also don't want to make any hasty decisions, but once we do have something to share, we'll be sure to keep you posted.
---
What about making it so that a lethal hit from Healthy (NOED, Chainsaws, T3 Myers) puts you into Deep Wound instead of Dying? That's a pretty drastic design change, but potentially more engaging for both players.
---
Yeah his entire profile is complaining about things so I won't take it too hard haha
---
Everyone who stays learns eventually, but it's nice of you to try not to stomp new players out of enjoying the game.
---
By myself.
---
If I‚Äôm chasing a survivor and I don‚Äôt hit him in 20 seconds I‚Äôm switching. I‚Äôll get him when he comes for his friends.

---
it means u can play the game for free and that the dlc are discounted price..
---
The ideology isn't. The execution is. It never worked, only on paper.
---
If you have decisive, you can escape after being unhooked and downed. Metal of man can also counter him. Borrowed time. There are perks that can counter him, but yeah, his chainsaw is very strong at camping.
---
no, a good nurse doesn't need ruin lol. same goes for billy, whispers saves you so much more time when finding survivors and it's not a totem that can be broken and remove a perk from your loadout for the rest of the game
---
This is probably one of the best things I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub. Superb work!
---
I'll need to see the bunz before I give you the munz
---
If it‚Äôs an objective survs should have a tracker to track how many dull totems are still on the map
---
I NEED MOBILE VERSION ASAP
---
I agree
---
all of this
---
no. please. never
---
Just another killer carried by Legion...
---
Arguably the strongest camping tool in the game, with the ability instantly down multiple survivors if they‚Äôre close to each other
---
Quality post
---
lots of options to get rid of perk tiers.
---
i actually like tiers TBH.
---
honestly, just lets us sell unused offerings, items, and add-ons for 100% payback. it will mitigate ALOT of grind without changing too much in the game itself
---
If somebody was looping the killer for 5 minutes 3 gens should be done at minimum. a good team can gen rush all 5 in that time.
---
Well I was rank 5 but cause of rank reset I‚Äôm 11
---
Nurse said fuck SWF
---
You gotta find perks that arent slightly better versions of others.
---
Will that matter though
---
Who in their right mind asked for this
---
Switch out decisive for spine chill
---
Yes.  Very much so.
---
Why Mexican?
---
Holy Jesus.
---
What is that?
---
What the fuck is that?
---
Honestly, at the time of creation I figured a number of people would be too quick to yell OP, so I tried to tack on some reasonable drawbacks for the brackets. If I were to rewrite it, it'd probably be something along the lines of missing both explodes a gen but you keep the brackets, hitting one installs them but still explodes the gen, and acing both installs them silently. I just didn't want them to be able to be used via doing a quick drive-by on a gen and installing them practically mid chase with no drawbacks.
---
Legion isnt particulary strong, just unfun, they made a killer designed to apply pressue to multiple survivors, and made them terrible at doing that, but great at just foxusing on a single person for ages at a time. They pretty much failed to bring the design to the game as intended, in multiple streams they have said Legion balance is on a knife edge, and thats why they have taken so long to address them,  the notes sound like it will be a more substatial change than just adjusting a few numbers here and there.  You don't need to see every balance change as a personal attack.
---
I was waiting for them all to diconnect
---
I once came up with a killer concept called The Clockmaker, and he has a perk called:
---
 **Hex: Times up ‚Äì** A Hex rooting its power in Time commands the trial grounds. Once a gate has opened, this Hex activates on a dull totem and survivors have 90/60/30 seconds to leave the trial grounds, otherwise the gates will shut and can‚Äôt be opened again until this Hex is cleansed. Any survivors trapped behind the closed doors that have not escaped are automatically sacrificed. All survivors still in the trial grounds automatically escape if you get trapped, hooked or not. 
---
I hope the devs are doing something similar to this just not in a hex perk form somehow.
---
Link to the Clockmaker concept in-case anyone wants to read the TL:DR
---

---
10/10 would pay for this
---
LITERALLY ME RIGHT NOW   
---
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Same, tbh. Killers get all the cool ultra rares, which yeah it makes sense, they're what makes each match different, but I'd definitely like to see more interesting survivor items and add ons to spice it up even more. Doesn't help that most survivor high tier add-ons are just better versions of previous ones, like syringe, skeleton key, etc. Highly unique mechanics make for highly unique matches.
---
Love hearing Doom 2016 music outside of Doom lmao. This video is amazing overall but extra shoutout for that good taste &lt;3
---
The thing about legion is that he isn't that good, just that he is the most annoying killer to play against and the upcoming change, whatever it is, will hopefully fix him.
---
Why is SWF often talked about like it's tunneling or camping? It's talked about like it's toxic or bad sportsmanship...
---
Her whole arc was just fucking weird and awesome.  Favorite part of the show.
---
There are 65 perks with 3 levels each so... 195 bloodwebs after you've obtained the teachables from other survivors.
---
Considering all the awesome stuff I‚Äôve seen on here, that means a lot! Thanks!
---
Main reason why I run lithe with dance with me. Or the Houdini build as I call it. See ruin get chased, lose chase hit gens, get angry at missing skill checks, still sit gens, get 2 two done. Then save and try to find ruin... in the end pray for hatch.
---
Lol he went through all that trouble
---
Send it to the FBI's cyber crime division
---
Yah but odds are that was because it was a more popular cheat at the time so people were getting banned for it. Once they got EAC I don't think they kept on investigating user reports because that is more staff dedicated to not working on the game. 
---
I figured those people that did the cheat would keep their profiles private to avoid getting caught since I have been told they can't do anything if you private your profile. It is also possible they just don't ban people for it if it was so long ago and they have not done anything else since but I don't work for them.
---
Lol
---
Legion is pretty terrible when played as intended.
---
110 movespeed is too fast?
---
I feel bad as a killer whenever I see this. Like, really, I hooked them literally three seconds ago, and i'm here kicking a gen/breaking a pallet/whatever the fuck i'm doing before I fuck off, would you mind waiting like, 10-15 seconds for me to piss off instead of fucking you and your teammate?
---
‚ÄúMost annoying‚Äù goes to legion now I think.
---
yo, you made this? it's really good &lt;3
---
Depends. Is their any perks you want from them?
---
Most Freddy players so far i talked to are scared of the rework as it would ruin the highskill highreward gameplay they like.
---
A killer never leave is prey on the hook when the hatch/gates are open unless he is on the second stage of the hook. Very dumb of him...
---
1. Rank currently means something as matchmaking is based upon it. I brought up my rank because, as a rank 1 Killer, my queue times are often quite long. Btw, the reason many are waiting so long is because there are few people playing Killer atm. This is because of MoM, audio issues and DC's.
---
2. Check Steam Charts, the playerbase has only been decreasing for the last 2 months. This same thing happened inbetween the releases of every other chapter since 8.
---
3. This game has recieved an incredible amount of support. You seem to forget how small BHVR really is.
---
Nah I really don't. I also dont care to assume everyone with a TTV in their name is a jackass. I just think people all want a community of their own and where people like them. Which is nice. And doesn't automatically put a label on you as a person.
---
Sloppy butcher goes well with nurse's so they'll have a longer heal time. Giving you more time to find them
---
Nice animal crossing music üëèüëèüëè
---
That sounds really good with my build, thank you
---
isn't it 192 perks since everyone has their own teachables unlocked at lvl 1?
---
I know this probably was not widespread at the time but I believe if you made a ticket they gave bloodpoints to compensate for lost save files based on playtime. There were instances where people lost their saves and did the cheat to get back their old legacy cosmetic (that they earned legit since they were not returning legacy to lost save files) and got banned even though it was just what they had earned. Generally player support is a better idea than just taking a save file better than your own but I am sure the situation was a lot more stressful in the moment when looking for solutions.
---
Also just some food for thought but unless you gave yourself billions of bloodpoints and 1000 items the save file cheat was not really detectable unless user reported (usually through their achievements or screenshots) so odds are unless it was a REALLY modded out save file someone turned you in. 
---
Lastly, you can choose what you value more in those scenarios, the friend or equal justice but most people probably just take the friend which is what /u/4lips2gloss is saying. Like I said I had friends that did the cheat and we knew but didn't report him because we didn't care. Likewise if we all cheated and some of us got banned and the others didn't we would not turn the others in for fairness we would buy the game again and play it if we liked it or we would just play another game. Then again he might not have been a good friend of yours but I don't know your life.
---
Yeah that's pretty much just a meta build.
---
Honestly as long as you have Self Care and an exhaustion perk your build is fine.
---
Either you are really lucky or you forgot the last time you were playing with hook rushers or against campers/tunnelers
---
Take 100 dollars to F off
---
Grow up
---
I thought tunneling was when everyone said fuck the hens, we gonna dog our way out.
---
Silly oh, bear.
---
Camping is when the killer is still on the map after hooking a survivor. (This joke isn‚Äôt mine)
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once
---
UwU
---
I know that it will likely drastically change his playstyle, which I do not like, as I play Freddy for how his power works and the strategies you use with him
---
I hope the buff legion into god status lmfao
---
Why does everyone love wraith as a character but hate his play style üò¢
---
This is fantastic! The time and effort really show, and you have quite the eye for detail.
---
Are you considering doing anyone else? 
---
My only suggestion would be about imgur, and linking an album instead of individual photos.
---
This deserves a lot more appreciation, keep up the amazing work!
---
Looping and using pallets/windows is the only way to keep away from a killer in a chase. Legion can circumvent that using his ability. 
---
On top of this his power, his power can see those in his terror radius that aren't effected by the deep wounds he inflicts. when deeply wounded it takes 3 hits to down a survivor (2 if franks mixtape add on is played) and you have to mend before the timer goes out or you'll bleed out. The problem with this is the legion can walk backwards and follow the blood causing the game to say youre not in a chase so your mend bar depletes.  You either let it go out or he finds you while mending because hes following the blood.
---
There's no counterplay.
---
Like I said, this was at the start of the bug, no one knew there would be compensation and yes I‚Äôm aware of why people were hacking to get back what they had earned but hey I am not a hacker so I didn‚Äôt go down that route. They were no longer my friend because like I said they knew what would happen if I had suddenly gotten multiple achievements at the same time and still went ahead with it without warning me hence why I wanted them to get the same treatment coz they were actually hacking (yea there was evidence hence why I said the steam mod of dbd also said they had hacked and would get banned). And the only person who really knew about me taking his save file was him so by that logic then (if he did turn me in) I would be returning the favour. Still not petty tho to report someone for hacking when I myself did not hack, and was fucked over by a friend at the time who is no longer my friend due to this situation.
---
Honestly. Like everyone of those things is something this sub complains about.
---
Hey, can I get a link too? :)
---
He‚Äôs doing his own thing guys, let him have it jeez...
---
I would do gens, but my dummy thicc ass-cheaks are stuck in the locker
---
First game after rank reset with the new dlc, had a blast!
---
DAUBENY
---
Consent is important mkay
---
I saw a whole new breed today, he was insidious in the basement waiting for someone to loot it. It took two gens for me to get curious so I went down because I horde items. I turned the corner and there he was revving it up as the heartbeat blares loud. That was an insane act I hadn't seen before.
---
Yikes
---
If I could buy this, I probably would.
---
I just suck and dont like losing. So thank god monto, noob, tru3, ussylis, and demi exist.
---
Bubba needs to be the next killer reworked tbh. With the exception of the few, decent LF mains, hes mostly there for meme builds, if you try and play him seriously at high ranks you get dunked on.
---
New players have it really hard on both a sides. I feel bad for them.
---
I have a feeling the legion rework will be underwhelming and still an ass to play against and the Freddy rework will be cool.
---
Rank 1 salty survivor that doesn't know how to go against Nurse but still acts cocky as hell. I would just tunnel the flashlight guy and camp him but what you did is beautiful.
---
 game: has one little tiny not major bug that will 100% happen in any game because no game is coded flawlessly

A good Nurse is one of the only killers who doesn‚Äôt need Ruin. There are so many better options to use for her.
---
Note: If I‚Äôm about to struggle or die, go ahead. That at least gives me a chance and makes the killer take time to hook me again.
---
imagine playing Billy and running NOED
---
2nd chance perks allow you to survive for the longest, so it makes sense to be the most used.
---
This is kinda everything summarized the best though. In a game designed to make the killer want to hook/kill and survivors survive you want to take what ever gets the job done the best. And unfortunately sometimes a lot of the good shit can be really annoying to face off against on both sides. I'm not good enough to offer a solution if one is even needed.
---
What if we compromise from god-pose Freddy to flexin Freddy? Will that be acceptable?
---
No.
---
Unless the spirit knows how to play in which case even slowly walking away from a spot will get you hit because she is fast af.
---
Sensitive to your breathing, and the sound of your blood rushing through your veins...
---
That's not even toxic. They're literally just playing the game. If they didn't tbag you or berate you through messages, they're not toxic. I don't know what you expect them to do, let you kill them?
---
Doesn't make it right or fair.
---
I have to use Ruin or else my games finish before I can cross the map.  I have to use BBQ to get a decent idea of where everyone is or else I'm at a severe disadvantage.  I don't LIKE using them but I HAVE to or else I'm just not as good as I can be.  I'm essentially stuck with a build I don't like, I'd much rather have Surveillance or Pop goes the Weasel or something other than BBQ, but you'd be dumber than dirt to ignore potentially 100% extra BP and wallhacks.
---
It went on the shrine once, then the devs realized they made a terrible mistake as they saw the Leatherface DLC sales plummet. Then it's not been seen on the shrine since.
---
I don't use Ruin for gen slowdown, it's pretty useless for it. I use it as bait. They see the skill check, they look for the totem. I then have a rough idea of where a second survivor is while I hook the first.
---
Any map with an infinite. I can deal with garbage terrain hitboxes and the septillion pallets they put on that one Autohaven map, but infinites are a guaranteed safe spot for the survivor unless you're Nurse or Hag, and there shouldn't be guaranteed safe spots in the game imo.
---
Does he get his own Barbeque and Chili just called "Honey and Honey"
---
Hah, thank you. Steam says 2,000 hours.

I've been a Nurse player since 400-500, though.

I used an offering that slightly increased luck. It probably made the difference

Whispers is great on huntress

Maybe as a skillset.

But most Freddies I encounter tunnel like mad, and that just not fun to play against.

So I go ‚Äúugh‚Äù every time it‚Äôs freddy.

I had some fun matches against Legion before so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

They're pretty bad but SUPER annoying, but if they use Frank's Mix Tape and Cold Dirt they're practically guaranteed a 4 man

if the other survivors said there wasnt a nurse they probably did the glitch with the nurse and are just trying to save themselves from being banned and reported

I liked how you used he and she

Well that was before people found out about his mixtape and oh god the double knife add ons.
---
I'm supposing the body they found was the Janitor that was killed by the gang &amp; buried near the town. Its unlikely that they finished burying the body fully &amp; even then its not unlikely that the body could be resurfaced if the police followed the tracks or investigated the area to find the body. Burying a body doesn't permanently hide the evidence.
---
The other 3 are other individuals as it makes it clear that Frank has not got ID. Not only do the other 3 characters each have their own personalities separate from Frank, but they also have their own cosmetics to show that their individuals. 
---
He met Julie at the village which is Frank's girlfriend then he met the other 2, Susie &amp; Joey at parties which were friends of Julie. 
---
While burying the body, the other 3 followed the footsteps of Frank into the fog meaning they were also brought into the same realm as Frank. The only difference is instead of all being considered separate killers, They remain as a gang under the name of Legion within the Entities domain. The Entity refuses to let more than one member of their gang into a realm with the survivors.
---
I do not believe this theory that the Legion has multiple personalities. Mainly because the characters are introduced separately &amp; BHVR refuses to create new killers that have serious mental conditions like I.D.

I once had a game against a Freddy where I was hooked in front of an open exit gate not even 20 yards in front of me (I was on the hill).  He did not have NOED.  A fully healthy survivor about 15 yards next to me waited out my entire hook phase, let me die and then took the hatch lol.  Fucking randoms man...
---
In a game where pallet looping is the best survivor strategy, and Freddy‚Äôs dream transition gives them time to reach those loops for free, there‚Äôs no amount of tracking or stealth that can make up for that unfortunately
---
if you play both blades with a mori and cant 4k you shouldnt be allowed to play this game anymore

I used [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7rsp6h/nvidia_freestyle_dbd_settings/) guide to change the colorsettings. The nvidia version in the guide is a bit older so the settings can be in slightly different places. The only con I've found with using these settings is that the red ruin skill checks are barely visible, so the counter that I've turned freestyle off when needing to hit ruin skill checks.
---
If I'm hooked and if there's only one other person I'll struggle until I see their aura static or crouching in one area. After that if I see them not moving I'll just kill myself on the hook to let them get the hatch. Feels better than actually getting the hatch yourself imo.

Holy fuck. I just ragequit the match after 20 minutes of being stuck at 1 Gen left.

A while back when I was being chased by a huntress as Feng Ming and my arms flew over my head and I was running around looking like an ape then I just got sucked under the ground and died.

Classic DBD.

That's second stage

Addons, that's it. Mostly just the infinite mend glitch and franks

---
Sometimes, I have the full intention to save the hooked survivor. I happen to come across the hatch, so I stop on it and T-bag 3 times to let them know "hatch is here" I can't count the amount of times teammates decided to give me the hatch after I did this. I am grateful at those teammates, but at the same time... I was totally willing to sacrifice myself to save your life

Can confirm, doesn't work anymore, I just got 4k as a new killer with a bit too suicidal survivors and no achievement, only progress towards the "use killer action a lot of times" one. (PC)
---
From what I've seen from the community, Legion is actually the most powerful killer with no counters.
---
Legion without franks/bugged blades and no moonwalking is the worst killer in the game IMO
---
how dare he find 18 swfs in 1 day
---
or when you watch youtubers play dbd
---
Just a short reminder: Outplaying someone is not toxic, the same applies when a killer just obliterates a team.
---
It may not be fun but it happens, like you said: You got the game yesterday. And you usually get 9 hooks. So what, you had one bad game and this makes you sick of the game? Just take the loss and move on, you will learn how to counter it eventually.

You literally just got the game yesterday but made a post six days ago about your rank 17 huntress match?

And all your reasons for "toxic survivor" have me believing this is satire
---
Hm I too think that MoM should get a change, don't know if perma broken would be the right option tho, but definitly a possibility. The biggest problem with MoM is that it just widens the gap between the high tier killers and the low tier killers so I think that there should be something that corrects that.

hate to say it, but legion is (are?) my favourite killer(s) . sure, they've got some major gameplay flaws, they're the most annoying pieces of shit in existence, and they lack counterplay... but, it's just kinda fun, y'know? moving at lightspeed, hitting fucking everyone and having nothing stop you. Best counter to cocky swf. plus, their cosmetics are fucking beautiful. prove me wrong.
---
Oh god. You know what? If it really is that great and gulags weren't bad then list me one country that has succeded with communism. Also the agism is funny. FUCK THEM YOUNGSTERS. That's literally every person over 24 when they cannot present a normal argument, which is called.... a [strawman] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) when you assume things I said that I didn't. I never said the communist ideology was bad. All I said is nobody executed it yet the way it was intended to be because..... no one is commited. No civilization didn't collapse under Communism. From the Soviet Union to Venezuella there was not one succesful communist regime/country. They've all fallen. But hey ho, you can always try. Oh and I agree with u/BobTheBox, that ending. Yikes.
---
**Straw man**
---
A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man."
---
The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition.  Straw man arguments have been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly regarding highly charged emotional subjects. 
---
Straw man tactics in the United Kingdom can be known as an Aunt Sally, after a pub game of the same name, where patrons threw sticks or battens at a post to knock off a skittle balanced on top.

I wouldn't consider it cheating. While it does give them an advantage, it's something everyone has access to, and it doesnt make them good on  it's own. 
---
Though I cant say if the dev's would. You would probably have to ask one.
---
&gt; Even Baby Legions can pull off 2-3k just with luck. 
---
To be fair tho: With luck you can get a 2-3k with just about any killer, hell I even got my Adept Hillbilly on my first ever Hillbilly game with only 1 succesfull chainsaw in the entire game.

The worst is when you're mending and he shows back up (heartbeat and music going and all that jazz), but the deep wound bar has run all the way out and if you let go you're down. If you keep mending, he downs you.

I tested, dark devotion does not work for frenzy hits

Lmao adrenaline is not broken outside of the wake up effect. You don‚Äôt get to choose when it triggers so it can either save you from death or be a complete waste of a perk slot. But I am curious to hear how you think it‚Äôs broken.

Huh, I 8 thought they shadow patched this. Was this KYF or online public?

9 out of 10 nurses I face are very easily juked through line of sight breaking or cut backs using walls. I even face some nurses who bring Ruin and that still doesn't stop them from getting crushed. 
---
If you are facing a nurse **that good**, leaving you no way to hold her in a chase (as you stated), have you ever thought the other player is just way better than you and he deserves those easy catches? 
---
Also, while facing these same nurses that take ages to catch me, I see my fellow survivors trying to drop pallets against them, vaulting windows or trying to loop them as if they were any M1 bloodlusting killer. 
---
Playing against nurses is exciting because it requires a different gameplay from survivors other than looping.
---
With that being said, I don't deny that nurse's power is borderline game breaking. I simply believe that people exaggerate when it comes to the nurses they face when in reality, they are the ones offering little resistance.
---
I know, freddy is so op, especially his broken perks. Fire up needs to be nerfed
---
Boy‚Äôs night
---
Personally the scene I found the most shocking in the whole tv show ( tied with the red wedding)
---
Sure is.
---
That's not the killers fault that's the communities.
---
Perk Enduring , face a wall when you gonna pick up someone , and perk bamboozle .
---
I would say first get BBQ and Chili
---
Next you should get ruin or surveillance 
---
After that I would say save the Best for last or brutal strength depends on the killer you are gonna play
---
Enduring en spirit furry is never a wrong pick but I would combine them in a build 
---
I hope this helps gl with catching the survivors
---
sure, cause it matters that i'm salty when it's a touchy subject and i hear same shit over and over.
---
Killers HAVE to have powerful perks because you know they're the 1 in 4v1 (there's currently no OP killer perks anyways). I'm not saying that survivors can't have good perks either, but there's a difference between perks like Deliverance and Distortion which are both good and balanced and Mettle of Man which is busted AND literally makes over half the killers no longer viable. The aura reveal is laughable at best because the survivor will just run to a pallet, instaheal, and continue the chase.
---
I'm gonna be honest, people that defend MoM have not played this game at red or even purple ranks. Killers are already pressured for time and a perk like MoM makes the killer waste even more time on one survivor simply because I hit them one too many times. One MoM is manageable IF you catch the person early. Once two or more people start running MoM it becomes absurdly broken and by the time the end game comes around it's basically a free escape. By the way, I hope you like playing against NOED, because I can guarantee you that it's going to start showing up (moreso than what it already does) in every game that isn't Hillbilly or Huntress because it's one of the few consistent counters killers have to MoM.
---
I want you to think about this when it comes to survivor perks: if four people run it, is it broken? If yes, then it in needs to be reworked. If not, it's fine.
---
Now apply that to line of thinking to other survivor perks. Does 4 people running self-care, distortion, deliverance, any of the exhaustion perks, adrenaline, borrowed time, unbreakable, and we'll make it break the game balance? No it doesn't. There's only two survivor perks that have done that: pre-rework decisive strike and now mettle of man.
---
ig I don't see a point being that angry killer I am a killer main but I just wanna finish games without people dcing
---
That what she said for the first few days, she's since gotten over the whole infinite life death thing.
---
They are still not wrong... Legion without Mixtape is only good at prolonging games without applying any real pressure.
---
wow you guys are toxic, its okay to disagree with his opinion but shitting on him is just disgusting 
---
downvoting this shit
---
Spirit - Lullaby, Haunted Grounds, Enduring, BBQ
---
Addons: Mother-Daughter Ring, Green Shoes(I don't remember their name)
---
Overall decent pressure and sonic mode
---
So they didn't fix the bug with the latest update
---
Imagine if killers had access to this many 2nd chances?
---
I like Huntress for the same reason. You can throw hatchets over them, which makes some nice mind game moments.
---
It's not even like pallets are useless against Legion. The stun knocks them out of feral frenzy.
---
New Hillary Clinton cosmetic?

Good God! how can someone be that talented !!!!

freaking love it

Or when you exist
---
Yikes. At least you're self-aware.
---
90 seconds. And after a brief period of movement they go away. 
---
Which means a survivor roaming arounf the map immersed can be extremy difficult to spot.
---
YES!!!! i am so satisfied!!!
---
I have a strong feeling that labeling a peripheral device that is allowed to connect to your console, cheating, on a certain game that your console allows to play would probably be extremely risky. I could be wrong though.
---
Thats the thing, the only thing they are really good at is being annoying. IMO they are fun to play, but annoying to play against. I wonder if they manage to change them to be fun for both sides, but i'd guess they'll turn them into the new freddy.
---
Reddit hive
---
I think OPs idea was really neat but could def use improvement
---
proceeds to self care instead of opening the door
---
It would seem so.
---
But they don‚Äôt fully heal them self. they just heal up to 99% percent and stop and continue healing when they get in the killer terror radios. This way survivors can run mom with out an actual penalty , that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard .
---
I think it's because Wraith is pretty black and white. You either stomp or get stomped. Not much inbetween.
---
or when you havent been born or have died
---
No. It‚Äôs slugging and they explicitly said it isn‚Äôt actionable. Holding the game hostage implies they can keep you there indefinitely until you are forced to quit (losing all your points). When slugged, your timer eventually will run out and you will die.
---
wait so cant you just 99% with bloodstained battery and immediately fix another? that sounds OP
---
I STILL get stressed out watching other people play
---
in other words, im sure next time i decide to give nurse a go it'll be another '4-survivors-teabagging-at-the-exit-gate-barrel-of-laughs'
---
Shirtless Myers be Daddy i cant stop Talking about him unless you sow my mouth shut and Even then ill mumble "Shirtffls mayrss"
---
As she was near opening the door it is better to go for the chainsaw instead of risking to only put the survivor in injured state with an M1, plus he was pretty far away to her which reduce even more his chances of grabbing her before she finishes
---
The reason I'm questioning it is because many games I've played prevent use of mouse and keyboard, leading me into assuming it's because it's the superior control scheme.
---
What bothers me is that they‚Äôre using the term wrong. In gaming vernacular, ‚Äútunneling‚Äù refers to overcommitting resources to a hard target. It‚Äôs bad because it‚Äôs a losing strategy. In this game, it should be chasing the same survivor for five minutes while all the other generators get done. What they‚Äôre confusing it with is ‚Äúfocusing,‚Äù which is exploiting a soft target. If I catch you three times in the first five minutes, sorry, you were a soft target.
---
Well. Juche now is just a fatass kid flexing his nuclear pp.
---
I like to use it when I see p3s with flashlights
---
you can tell at the start of the clip by the purple lightborn how sick of this you are haha. glad you got that tasty revenge bud.
---
good perk set i use for when im sick of swf is ruin, iron grasp, franklins demise, lightborn. never usually have to worry about tracking since after downing a survivor whatever hook youre closest to will have someone bodyblocking it. and they never expect you to chase one of them for the down while carrying their mate
---
That‚Äôs some BS, but I laughed anyway good escape. If he didnt get the 3K he would‚Äôve been so pissed at that
---
from reading so much about the game i found out some survivor perks got nerfed. why did the survivor perks get so much nerfs? also did killer perks get any nerfs? 
---
disclaimer: i've only bought the game on the 4th of april so idk much about the history of nerfs but everywhere in their forms and on steam i read that this survivor perk got nerfed but i never read about killer perks getting nerfed
---
inform me please and thank you
---
Do these games prevent the use of keyboard and mouse through telling you not to use it, or do they actually have a way to block you from using it? I'm curious.
---
BFG is the song name if I remember rightly. From the Doom soundtrack.

i need that, splash some blood on his chest too please

Yep that is what I expected
---
Look up Farmer John or Mondo when they play legion.
---
what is this infernal abomination i am witnessing?
---
The inverse of that goes against a solo survivor main. I‚Äôve been sandbagged or flamed in chat because they thought I should‚Äôve played exactly like them.  Survivors in this game lack accountability and blame everyone but themselves when they don‚Äôt escape or get points
---
Actually that's Shadowborn, very similar icons though! I love the extra FOV. I don't mind flashlights too much, I just bring a tasty Franklin's demise and s m a c c that shit out of their hand.
---
I‚Äôm new to the game too . The only nerf i know about is the decisive strike . I‚Äôm sure there have been nerfs other than decisive on both killer and survivor side.
---
Yep, it's a horror game, but it have almost no horror left in it after you get a hang of it. You kinda even get pissed of about people who crouch and run urban evasion. Survivors just have a bit too much power against killers, and killers themselves are at this point impossible to balance, especially with nurse being in the game.
---
I had a game where I downed a survivor, left him on the ground and went into a chase with another one. I downed the second one and I hooked him, but I lost track of the first survivor. 
---
Anyway I went into a chase with a 3rd survivor, downed him, and hooked him. I had BBQ and Chilli so I saw the first downed survivor at the other end of the map. The 3rd survivor insta killed himself while the 2nd did not try escaping at the beginning and was now struggling with about 15% left. 
---
I went to the first survivor as fast as possible and he was right by the hatch. I pick him up and he DCs. 2 seconds later the hatch opens. Thank you to the 2nd survivor who bought me that much time, what a team player.
---
Dude these are honestly awesome.
---
I see. Thanks for pointing it out.
---
Or when you are conceived
---
As a clown main i love this so much, fantastic work
---
I can taste the sodium
---
Shit, is the method still the same? Really wanna try this before they patch it.
---
What's the name of the calm song?
---
The games just seem to block the use of them. There's no message, and I've tried with a few keyboards and mice. It tells me they're connected but they don't actually do anything, and there's no way to remap keybinds for keyboards. At least as far as I know.
---
This is the newbie experience though. Not sure why you'd wanna deny it.

Really?? I made the adepts before so yeah, I didn‚Äôt know, thanks

People thinking OP finds Freddy broken or powerful. It's the same case as high rank people going against Nurse/Billy every day, super annoying and stale.
---
Why would I lie??? But someone said that it changed with the plague update so yeah
---
Thank god shirtless Myers will never be a skin
---
This is the only excuse
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not like killers have perks like NOED or Rancor or shit ton of broken addons or moris that could give you free kills ü§îü§îü§î
---
Doom Eternal is one of the two games I've actually been looking forward to this year.
---
I was told to Rip and Tear, until it was done. Turns out it's not quite done yet.
---
Thank you for everything! But I think (my honest 5cent) that you should put more priority on the DC's of both killer and survs.
---
Its becoming a very big issue!
---
Had this happen yesterday, all 3 of us other survivors got unhooked right in front of the Clown by this Nea with WGLF. The clown then gave her hatch and thanked her in the post-game lobby :(
---
It's not only this post, I hear people speak about Bamboozle as if it was a second Ruin or Noed left and right. I don't know what's the issue with it.   
---
I guess people just love to complain.
---
Why would anyone be scared of a frosty-eyed killer?
---
As someone who lives in the states, no, no it doesn't.
---
People I talk to on both sides of the aisle only think about Pepe when someone says "REEEEEEE", and only idiots believe that whole "Pepe is a white nationalist symbol" bullshit that was peddled out a couple months ago.
---
It's more the games themselves than the PlayStation. The fact that you get a notification that the console has detected the m+kb kinda lets you know it might work. (?) Games like fortnite (ew) allow mkb, they even have an extra options screen for it. But then games like Paladins don't.

Few days ago, I have noticed a problem with Dead by Daylight. My rank progress doesn't get saved. Every time i receive a pipe for a match, it gets lost once I turn off the game. What is weird is that bloodpoints, shards and level of account do get saved. It is just the rank progres (rank and pipes) that constantly go back. I've noticed this problem only with survivor. I tried to uninstall the game, and reinstalled it and it didn't work. I always wait until the auto save icon disappears. It is very discouraging, because no matter how much I try, I make no progress. I have never had this problem before. I think it started after the DLC and update with the Plague. 
---
Did anyone have this problem and knows how to resolve it?
---
You know, i watched a streamer play DBD and he went against a freddy. Hearing the song made me buy the game.
---
Since i've bought the game i had 1 match against a freddy... i hope for a freddy every survivor match :(
---
Faced a huntress with NOED and bloodwarden with a friend. She had my friend down and hooked the random so I could not leave then she decided to sorta act like a asshole in my opinion and just try throwing hatchets at me at the gate instead of just getting it over with, but then once she got me she hooked me and walked away and I managed to 4 percent off the hook and ran to the exit and got out and at the same time my friend managed to find the hatch while crawling so we both got it and both got a achievement for escaping when he completed a special gen
---
Welp... I never thought they'd make a vomiting killer, a hooded Speedy Gonzalez, and bring Ash Williams in the game.... so anything is possible. I would think maybe the werewolf would play like a feral version of the PIG and Legion combo with the ability to track..... seems overpowered lol
---
I kind of like myer's animation, because of how similar it is to what he did in the film. 
---
But aside from that legion is definitely the best.
---
Did i miss anything on that guy?
---
Removed please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Ah of course, that makes more sense
---
oh come on. they had same problems with any president. just now everyone is excited cause he fucks up in a funny manor. i remember as a kid the amount of puns about Bush jr in Russia was insane. his policy brought much more bullshit, it's just people didn't have such developed internet
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Frenzy is more like 130.
---
There's auto aim? I realise that his lunge is one of the longest but..... auto aim?
---
Still isn't an excuse to start belittling the person you're talking to. You started being very rude towards a person because they talked about an idiology, thats just not ok
---
ugh, you're right. i know it's my problem when i'm passionate about something.
---
but first guy is still an idiot who can't even recognize a joke =\
---
That gray beard is so sexy i want you to rub it all over my body, sorry if you‚Äôre taken lol
---
I thought you were talking about the Dwight bulge for a second until I read the other comment
---
Taking the game hostage would be stopping people from leaving the game unless they DC i'm pretty sure.
---
See basement blocking with killers.
---
Unfair? Yes. Cheating? No.
---
M&amp;A sounds bad on huntress but your argument actually makes sense, I‚Äôll have to try it out on her cheers
---
You can see how bad this subreddit is when you get downvoted hardcore just for saying what perks you prefer :')
---
yes. I figure, a penalty of 30% loss or so of the original fill would work.
---
Go stand in a corner or don't abuse his power and the exploit that comes with it. Either way, I DC the very second I see one. Idc of it's a brand new player using him or someone that regularly plays the game. I'm not gonna take the chance to let someone abuse game mechanics and I'm not going to find out or let them do it to me. I have better things to do with my time in the game rather than be tunneled for the entirety of it and be forced to run BACK to the killer to reinitiate a chase that's intentionally being broke by the killer. Fuck a bunch of that.
---
There have been nerfs for both sides.
---
No One Escapes Death didn't used to be a Hex, and lasted forever.  Then it was nerfed to last for 2 minutes, then it was changed to be a Hex.
---
Unrelenting used to give negligible cooldown decreases to your hit/missed attacks.  It was later buffed to have decent cooldown decreases, but was then nerfed again to only work with missed attacks.
---
Save The Best For Last was extremely good, and was basically a superior version of Unrelenting, which ALSO stacked with Unrelenting.  This created the "machine gun" meta, which made successful M1 hits have almost no cooldown.  
---
Play With Your Food used to give more movement speed, and was easier to get stacks.  Like, a lot easier.  I'm pretty sure there was no cooldown, and actually downing your obsession would "end the chase", granting you a stack.
---
Iron Grasp used to be insane, and almost doubled the amount of time it took to wiggle free from the killer, but it was also mandatory because of sabotaging.  Back in the early days of DBD, sabotaging hooks would permanently remove them from the game, so it was pretty common to have games where every hook would be sabotaged, and only basement hooks would be left.  Iron Grasp would give you a chance to bring people across the map and to the basement.
---
Brutal Strength used to be really good as well, but was nerfed because they globally made pallet breaking faster, which makes sense.
---
Those are all the major ones I can think of, so yeah, Killers have had their fair share of nerfs.
---
Ah when you decide to try as nurse they never expect it 
---
I like to imagine nurses like this like me have a bind to play heavy metal when they starts wrecking their shit 
---
MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING OOOOOOONNNN
---
Yeah, let's talk about shirtless Huntress instead
---
OMFG IT IS HEAVY METAL I SWEAR ON MY MOM I WATCHED IT FIRST WITHOUT SOUND OMFG HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Best thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub probably
---
his lungs have finally had enough
---
Wait the clown spawned in ?
---
Why aren't they looking into Plague buffs yet? She's widely considered weak due to her lack of pressure (forced to tunnel &amp; weak to loops) and the heal from fountains screwing her over massively.
---
Lesson learned: don't fuck with the nurse
---
why would anyone be scared of a killer?
---
Nerf monsters plz
---
Why is this 1000% me
---
"This basement isn't big enough for the both of us"
---
The higher I rank up.... the more I see flashlight wielding Claudettes lol
---
Of course not.... you could just hit them
---
Legion update... Waiting for my Killer main to be killed. :( 
---
And no, I'm not a toxic, mend making legion either.
---
Implying they actually see each other...
---
This is why I just never tunnel when I see this I just face camp the idiot that did it bc fuck that guy the other survivor the few times I've done it always say "thank u"
---
what about shirtless wraith
---
This is legit!!  Awesome work.
---
He just want to go bing bong
---
100% Evan would beat those punk kids 1v4, especially if he‚Äôs in shirtless mode
---
why is it a weird question to ask?! i just wanted to know:  *what in dead by daylight is so appealing to homosexuals?*  maybe i worded the question wrong.
---
They are not toxic
---
I love the 360 nice
---
I'm worried about them changing Legion's playstyle. Throw me a link to where they address that shit?
---
He's not a strong killer. To rework him would be complete dog shit.
---
I forgot about GoT and how fucked up it is. Holy hell
---
In my experience, they would often taunt you by tea bagging, or refusing to leave after the exit gates are open and purposely running you around or making noise notifications all over the place to mess with you. They're all coordinating on voice so it's easier to do that than if you were a random solo not able to communicate with your teammates. I never used to think survivors could be toxic until I started playing killer and encountered what was obviously SWF groups.
---
Yup, and it's the exact same now, just in a different way.
---
Awesome work! I can't even go about making a legion mask which is just a piece of paper pretty much
---
Come on gays of dead by daylight let‚Äôs get sickening
---
Are you sure it said "slightly" ü§£üòâ
---
Yeah
---
He just needs hugs
---
Imagine Clown x Leatherface combo holy shit
---
Hanging out.
---
Nice cosplays but also fuck legion but rly well done but also fuck legion I HATE IT
---
Woah. That's new. You should send this directly to BHVR, and maybe include your hardware specs, just in case.
---
Sounds like some weird fan fic you got going there.
---
Yesterday, I had a guy with adrenaline complain that I was using NOED. Some people are just so damn dense.
---
He is not. People just complain because he counters most of their perks and defenses. It sounds OP but it really isn't.
---
Yeeessss , he tears both of his quads if he tries sprinting lol
---
Undertaker or old masked Kane as killer lol
---
There is. It is because the weapon doesn't have a hitbox, instead when you attack a box in front of your character becomes active. If it overlaps with the survivor hitbox, then it counts as a hit. If a hit is registered, the camera auto adjusts so your swing goes through the survivor.
---
I found this information in the dev's stream 99, timestamp about 8.50: https://youtu.be/XSImRb9g8m4
---
This is getting out of hand. Now there's two of them!
---
I just got quad hatch escape last night. The only other hard ones are gonna be Myers 4K with his two ultra dares and possibly crawl out of the hatch.
---
In the words of Moto Moto, I like 'em chunky.
---
You didn't. People on here just don't understand jokes unless they're marked with /s or are otherwise made extremely obvious. Basically people on here just don't like jokes.
---
Survive With Friends
---
This is why I love scratched mirror myers. I never 4k playing it, but it feels so much more fun to spook people rather than blink/chainsaw across the map.
---
Weird, I could have sworn that my camera sometimes moves on his own and I end up hitting a wall. Either way, this hitbox should not be a thing on awake survivors
---
funny how so many people actually think there is no aim assist....probably full time survivor Mains that never played killer
---
You, sir, have great taste in music
---
You don‚Äôt need all the trophies for the platinum, just the base ones. But maybe you‚Äôre trying to get the game to 100%? Good luck, I will start to do the DLC trophies too now
---
Someone said that when your attack enters the survivor hitbox, you automatically look at them, maybe it's not called auto aim, but it shouldn't happen on survivors you can't hit
---
25 seconds? That alone tells me all I need les to know. This killer would be actually complete and total dogshit.
---
It's weekend and all the salty kids/parents are online
---
woops, it was also supposed to say it takes 1 use and you cant unhook during I frames
---
Making her default number of traps 1 and being able to reload at every jigsaw box might be quite balanced.
---
Amandas letter could just disable the reload and stay the same.
---
Survivors have always been very strong at high ranks, especially with certain perk builds.
---
Easy downvote.
---
Darn... oh well, hopefully when they fix the nurse bug for blink hits It'll also enable frenzy hits to trigger it.
---
I used to main Pig and Wraith, just do what I did and start learning Nurse. It's ridiculous how much more time you have to actually deal with all the free-escape stuff survivors have access to. I do every now and then play a Pig game and just get reminded of why I stopped.
---
In a vacuum, it isn't broken; however, all of the "second chance" perks become exponentially more powerful once they are stacked together.
---
I'm already seeing Deadhard, Adrenaline, Mettle of Man, &amp; Borrowed Time/Self-Care SWF teams. That means it can take up to five (5) hits to finally drop a survivor **already in the injured state**.
---
quality DbD post
---
Can you link us some of the threads?
---
You mean like Moris any anything that gives the Exposed status?
---
i'm only countin 3 here chief
---
Futility
---
I agree. His aim assist can be the fucking worst
---
Check his history. He is full of shit. He won't be able to link you anything
---
Like Nurse's Calling, Freddy Krueger, Scratched Mirror, etc?
---
Yeah when the Reddit hive strikes you are shit outta luck.
---
It would be annoying for survivors as the pig could constantly send them to search jigsaw boxes which in itself is a massive time waste &amp; is risky if the timer is ticking. It would extend the match significantly &amp; probably make her OP.
---
Could also be used to grief a survivor by forcing them to constantly have the bear traps on their head at the end game then downing them everytime they remove the trap.
---
It also removes the tactical thinking behind using the traps. Having infinite traps would remove the whole strategy behind using traps &amp; trap management.
---
RIP trapper
---
Yes
---
Doc with Frosty Eyes looks a little cool sometimes.
---
Anyone who DC's to noed is dumb lmao
---
Nobody is shitting on them though?
---
What does bbq and chili do
---
this isn't T_D or /b/, there's no need for "reeeeee" lol
---
Oh no, you've caught me. Gg. Neuken in de keuken.
---
welcome back.
---
Maybe, but Bricky is my favorite DBD Youtuber and he talks about using Hex: Ruin to slow the game down just a little bit as well sometimes, so that's just who I hear ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You think I‚Äôm not about to post a thread about a werewolf killer so I can be another throw away account? Also I‚Äôd love one tbh, wouldn‚Äôt even care how they played I‚Äôd play them lol
---
Suckin' While Fuckin'
---
If they totally reworked how the traps work, maybe. As they are now it would be too much imo.
---
Nah, red addons are shit. Frank's is the broken one.
---
I think it‚Äôs so weird you say things like ‚Äúfocusing on gens only‚Äù and ‚Äúgenrush‚Äù. What do you expect survivors to do? Dance around and let you kill them? We should make it so after a generator is completed a survivor has to be downed before any of them can be worked on
---
That what I was thinking but the more and more I think about it, it *very* easy to take off traps anyway so maybe it would work.
---
welcome to r/deadbydaylight
---
In a sense, not active always but instead allowing you to "punish" for example your obsession for getting away from you.  
---
Hell give killers a 4% too! If a survivor escapes through exit gates while in your view, they have 4% chance to instead be placed on the nearest hook.
---
I‚Äôve played on and off again here and there.  Never have gotten above rank 18 but once played a game where they sabotaged all the hooks any where close to the exit.  They then hung out in that area and farmed me for points because I couldn‚Äôt get anyone to a hook without them escaping my grasp.  It was one of the worst and most frustrating matches I‚Äôve ever played.  Afterwards I stopped playing for months.
---
How is sabotage handled now since they changed it?
---
Your an amazing nurse player
---
How dare u use m2 when playing nurse
---
We were all Brooke Lynn on that couch, burying ourselves in cushions.
---
I AGREE I AGREE I AGREE
---
The poor thing just wants her achievement.
---
*bhvr delet this*
---
I go with whispers bbq enduring and spirit fury
---
I like this idea because it would help survivors alot but I feel like the reasons devs wouldn't put it in would be to keep that feeling of vunerability on the person that is hooked. When you are hooked your life is on the line of the other survivors and you have to put your life into their hands. If they farm you that ends up being their decision on how they want the game to play out regardless if it's a stupid thing to do
---
Legion is good though. I hate them, but they are good. No counterplay means an easy 4K.
---
Plague: **heck**
---
the tall one so terrify
---
yeah, i know that it's dumb to say that. it's the game's fault and not the survivors'. i know that survivors are supposed to do gens because it's the only thing to do. it's the game's fault because there is nothing else to do and gens just get done so fast because of it. i am looking forward to the endgame changes and hope that they actually do something to make games a bit longer.
---
I guess you are right :(
---
of course, they are all developers *duh*
---
Please let's keep making GoT memes
---
Only time I don't get an entitled whine fest (or nothing at all) after an SWF 4k is when they decide to bitch at a teammate instead of me. Ive even been raged at for using Leatherface this past week.
---
just finished a game where i got my Escape Artist achievement !!! Thanks to the Spirit who watched me unhook myself and let me fix the last gen to drop me on the hatch
---
who ever you are Spirit, i'm still very thankful to you because you didn't punish me for unhooking myself i got to be a happy baby &lt;3! thank you so much x
---
I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. I‚Äôd love it and it could open the door to some super unique gameplay!
---
What if you start as a human with torn clothes and chains on your wrist. Obvious you recently escaped whatever prison you were held in. Because you start as human and have been tortured you too want to escape the night mare. You‚Äôre actually able to work with the other survivors! Five people working on gens! But then... you randomly transform into a werewolf losing all control. Super fast and powerful. The Claudette you were just helping repair that gen with is now running in fear. You can‚Äôt control the werewolf form and it only lasts a little while but is crazy op. You get points for escaping in human form or for killing all survivors in werewolf form and pleasing the entity. That‚Äôd be awesome!
---
So you mean punish survivors for doing their objective??
---
Tinkerer's is actually amazing on Billy, especially if you know how to manoeuvre through the forests and rocks.  
---
Nurse's, however, not so much. It's a good perk, but there are perks that better compliment Billy, like Discordance.
---
Hey ron
---
Lol wtf weirdo, dude has so many posts dedicated to werewolves
---
The smug 1% says this.
---
Lol this gibberish bug again at the end xdd
---
I mean lets be honest, it feels like 200% movement speed, my butthole always clenches up when I get chased
---
Amen
---
You play add-onless?
---
As I get better at the game, I constantly in around trying to get chased so that my friends can escape. I‚Äôll pull them off hooks and take hits. It‚Äôs why I run deliverance, although my plans don‚Äôt always work.
---
The cancer of the subreddit right here.
---
Can someone give context? Is he just trynna avoid ranking up or what? If so I kind of get it, doubling when trynna hover is rustling to say the least.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people bully nurse players. She‚Äôs literally the hardest killer to use by far.
---
at least not enough, sadly this is the case for most games
---
On rank reset he doesn't like to level up too quick as no one else does and then he gets no games.
---
Probably addressing something really toxic the killer did that would maybe justify them flashlight clicking. 
---
TBH Nurse probably WAS tunneling before the vid starts. But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with tunneling, they should just use decisive.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main so the video is very satisfying, but realistically the orange guy was probably saying something that would make the video less satisfying that the vid maker didn‚Äôt want to make a point of.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people DC. Sure, it‚Äôs frustrating to be the first one found, or to be tunneled, or whatever else there is, but what does DCing do in your favor? Absolutely nothing.
---
It isn‚Äôt lol
---
Hybrid Panda has a video of him playing mad grit spirit, you should check it out he did pretty well with it
---
*Previous 17*
---
This one does not spark joy
---
How do you get in lobbies like this?? I wanna try it so bad!
---
havent played legion so cant give an educated opinion on it. 
---
i imagine paired with iron grasp you can make a decent anti-altruist build but once youve downed one survivor with one on your back, they will probably back off for the rest of the game and not attempt body blocks anymore. 
---
more consistently useful perks like franklins demise, or make your choice would probably help out more for an anti-swf build.

Yeah, Pepe has nothing to fucking do with white nationalism so stfu.
---
(The logic is that you get out of the game faster and can find a different one)
---
Tired of not being able to launch the game due to the uproject error that starter some days ago, I have to delete the anticheat folder, verify files and download it again every time I want to play.
---
YOU ARE HUGE ! THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A HUGE THROAT ! CHOKE AND STRANGLE !
---
I agree. Though killers have quite some 2nd chance perks, too.
---
...  *Blinks* ....
---
BOI-
---
Now commit to your meme lazyness and do this for every single survivor.
---
The mixture of Animal Crossing New Leaf and (What I assume) DOOM 2016 OST's is brilliant. Well played
---
How do I get in lobbies like this?? I wanna try it so bad!
---
So is survivors having the chance to jump off a hook a punishment to the killer for doing his objective? Not sure where your confusion comes from.
---
Oh damn
---
P3 Neas either run the killer around all game or get hit 20 meters through a window and dc as a result of it.
---
I've had several people disconnect on their *last hook* the past few days. Letting go of thousands points because they can't wait a few seconds. I genuinely don't get it.
---
Spawning 3 feet in front of the killer and not DCing, true hero. 
---
What really pisses me off is when survivors DC when snatched out of a locker.
---
You're pretty much the only person who agrees with this. People have been begging for a Freddy rework, a fix to Legion, and dedicated servers for a long time now. 
---
But nah, "Just fix bugs lol"
---
He did two pip tho?
---
Few changes, the one I have a problem with is timer still goes down when mending.  Also, Frank‚Äôs Mixtape + Cold Dirt is annoying to deal with because it takes NO skills and the add ons have no drawbacks
---
Im sad that I cant give 2 downvotes for both legions
---
I dont usually dc, but when I dc it will be due to survivors who play bad and make me killed, like when they throw pallet when you are right next to you. They can just run away why make your teammate die
---
His frenzy‚Äôs actually a bit slower than Sprint Burst, Lithe, Adrenaline, and Balanced Landing.
---
140%
---
Imagine taking time out of your day just to be rude to someone
---
Didn't know the exact number. Good to know.
---
When used right, as Monto has demonstrated before, Iridescent Button is insanely powerful.
---
that was so clutch
---
It's a hard thing to do, cause there's no way to say if they just have bad internet or if the DC on purpose
---
&gt;or did people finally understand how to use them?
---
That's kind of what happened, only the best way to use him wasn't what the Devs had in mind. People discovered cheesy exploits, like moonwalking, and it was all over after that. If people use him the way the Devs had in mind he's bad, but if you use the exploits he's slightly less bad and 100% more annoying.
---
Imagine fanboying legion and cosplaying as them even though it is straight cancer in the game
---
Yes. It‚Äôs called a teachable perk
---
So basically if you level up a characters bloodweb to a certain level, you start unlocking their perks for everyone.
---
In this case, get nea to level 30 I believe and you can unlock balanced landing to go into other characters blood webs
---
For me the most mysterious ones are P3 Aces. You never know what to expect.
---
Yeah. It's a pretty good perk. It's a teachable from Big Bubba Sawyer.
---
b-but they aren‚Äôt.  Click on the full image.
---
Or when they get grabbed off a gen, found while thinking they're invisible because they're crouching in a corner or in a cluster of weeds,  loose a loop, realize they fucked up and the last 3 gens are right next to each other, the killer still wants to play normal when someone D/C's, get knocked down in the exit gates, realize they're getting mori'd, etc etc etc. I could do this all day lmao
---
no the smug 1% say self-care isn't good
---
and self-care isn't good
---
McLean confirmed it was 140%, not sure why the wiki said that
---
If they are dc‚Äôing on their last hook with the latest update then they are probably trying to prevent a depip. If you dc and restart the game the pips you lost come back.
---
Thanks for your help! Definitely will do.
---
Getting triggered over cosplay lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The toxic becomes the toxee
---
Getting triggered over comments lolüòÇü§£
---
You're obviously playing against noobs if you're winning chases with a 110% movement speed killer.
---
Rank reset was yesterday bub. Carry on tho. I'd be glad to take you in KYF and loop you 5 gens .
---
I have never once used a Nurse addon. I have around 80 of each. 
---
Along with being useless, they throw me off with their different effects.
---
Once you nail down vanilla Nurse, switching it up isn't a good idea. 
---
You will become your own enemy if you mess with the timings.
---
Sad you got downvoted. SWFs are one of the most toxic players in the game. Most don‚Äôt care about killer‚Äôs fun and  if their fun gets ruined they bitch about anything they can. The ones with comms are unfun to play against, too. 
---
Hell, I‚Äôve had one 3 man all force close DBD because SECRET OFFERING MUST BE AN EBONY. I‚Äôve had 4 mans get mad I have NOED even though I never got a kill because they all had BT and unhooked in front of me. I‚Äôve had a few 4 and 3 mans with DS.
---
I won‚Äôt dodge them unless I got against them before and they were on of the tryhard or toxic SWFs. If they force close to a secret offering (and they were streaming so I know) and they‚Äôre a 3 man I‚Äôll just have the random get unhook points or instantly dodge soon as one of them loads in
---
OK so the three perks that belong to any survivors or killer are called teachable perks. These perks are available to their respective killer/survivor at all levels. When getting characters to level 30/35/40 you will have the option to unlock their teachables and have them show up in the bloodwebs of other characters. If you have any more questions about it or don't fully understand let me know and I'll help you out some more.
---
Even though I play survivor far more now, I never understood playing a full game, then disconnecting on death hook. Like... dafuq, your game is about to end, and the killer still gets the hook.
---
Send a trained assassin to the doors of the people who dc, unless it's like a tank 30 killer with rank 1 survivors idk
---
Same goes the other way around, though. I went up against a tunnelling Billy yesterday. He was a terrible looper, which worked out in my favour.  
---
By the end of the match, I had been hooked twice, and he still went for me mercilessly. I gave him a cheeky, lengthy teabag before escaping last through the gates, and he got so angry in the post-game chat.  
---
It's almost worrying how not self-aware some people are lmao
---
No because they will eventually die.
---
My first step as killer feels like I'm drunk. Like, I'll try to walk one way and he walks another for a step or two while looking the way I want to go....then it's fine. 
---
It's like the camera doesn't correspond to my actual character model direction until about 1 second later.
---
Ok thanks for the info! If I do have other questions I‚Äôll go to you.

The aura read on unhook is already implemented on Jeff's Breakdown perk

Run up the Ante, DS, slippery meat and your favorite exhaistion perk.

Had a game like that today.. Killer chased me for 10mins and they just managed to finish the last gen (I did 2 and they did 2 before the chase started) just as I got downed... got facecamped afterwards since I ran him around for so long...
---
"Why yes, I do kill babies."
---
I think i will main Nurse...
---
They're delicious.
---
i know, it's a joke. 
---
the sub thinks Legion is mid-tier but i'll be damned if i don't get ez 3-4k on red ranks completely without perks and add-ons. even Rin doesn't do that for me
---
Whaaaaaaaattttt???????
---
Do you want the game to continue?
---
The developers and other staff want to get paychecks. Without DLC and cosmetics to sell, they aren‚Äôt going to stay in business long. You can‚Äôt stop virtually all income to a company for a significant period of time and expect it to survive unscathed.
---
They can, and must, work on both.
---
Currently you cant do anything. With the dedicated servers I hope for bans. 30 minute ban from matchmaking. Then 1 hour up to a permaban for DCing way too much,but they really need to look into their game for that,so that people ,who dont dc intentionally are not getting banned.
---
If your gonna ask me to not tunnel you/farm, then chances of you getting tunneled skyrockets
---
I think the sound of Laurie's landing in front of him woke him up.
---
I‚Äôd have to disagree.  I find with Freddy‚Äôs invisibility I am able to get close enough before they run that I can almost always get a first hit before they reach a loop. With other killers, survivors will often run on sight and I need much more of a chase before the first hit. 
---
If the survivors reach a pallet during the dream transition they often will throw it down do to the confusion of Freddy fading in and out a visibility. With other killers they likely get a few more loops before using the pallet. Plus with Freddy‚Äôs reach you can often easily hit survivors as they reach pallets and windows. 
---
In the event that a survivor does reach the loop first and is out looping you and wasting time, Freddy‚Äôs power lets you walk away and check some gens. You can keep an eye on the survivor that gave you trouble and attack when an opportunity to get the drop on them presents itself.
---
WHo gave you the order!
---
PSA: the survivors are supposed to escape
---
I aren‚Äôt think that
---
I'm always pleasantly surprised when I win using "underhanded tactics" and don't get salt for it. A couple of days ago I tunneled and killed this Meg, who was clicking her flashlight at me continuously. I was apologizing post game and justifying myself by saying that I got sick of her flashlight and she simply said, "I get it lol"
---
Jesus, do people care that much about rank in this game?
---
Perfect day for a GoT meme. Nice job.
---
How about shirtless doctor?
---
It hurts even more that you‚Äôre so worked up about it YIKES
---
Survivors are just straight up skins. So it really doesn't matter all that much. Claudette is obviously the hardest to see so technically she is the best. I only play killer and I never tunnel based on skin/character so I never heard of one character getting the short end of the stick in chases.
---
Not even pocket watch?
---
I really like that you changed the subtitles to black when it was against a light background. Thank you
---
Well duh. The point is survivors need to stop D/C'ing from just being outplayed. I pretty much never D/C as killer, even when I'm losing and everyone gets out.
---
1. Hatch standoffs, if the survivor and killer reach the hatch at the same time the survivor can‚Äôt jump in immediately cause the killer will grab them, but the killer can‚Äôt hit the survivor because it gives the survivor a free escape while the killer is recovering from the hit. So they just sit there, doing nothing 
---
2. Encourages poor gameplay, there‚Äôs been countless cases where I‚Äôve seen survivors hide and do nothing while the wait for everyone else to die off once two generators are done so they can claim the hatch and escape with minimal effort
---
Ace to prestige 3 lol, but if you really want my opinion Claudette or Dwight would be your best choice
---
The only thing that generally drives me crazy is when you play to the best of your ability and actually manage to hook them all at least twice... and they *still* do this. *That's* bad form.
---
I SEE SOMETHING FAMILIAR 
---
I have now gained stimulation by perceiving this photograph with my eyeballs
---
Are you saying an alt pig killer has instant head trap mori?
---
So he just isn‚Äôt allowed to give constructive criticism from a consumer perspective?
---
I don‚Äôt know jack about making movies, but I‚Äôm allowed to review and criticize that am I not?
---
Hunny, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù job to make sure you don‚Äôt fix the generators so no shit they are gonna patrol them. You should just get more people on the same generator or lose the killer and go back to the same generator. After some practice, you become good at it
---
I had a whole idea for completely reworking the way items are used in this game and I kind of like my idea for the hatch. It allowed it to stay in the game without being completely broken IMO. Survivors had a chance to escape via hatch and killers have the opportunity to stop them before they get to the hatch
---
__________
---
**Keys**
---
The hatch will spawn just like it does now but will always be closed and requires a key to open. There will be 1 (maybe 2?) key boxes per game. This key box is visible the entire game but remains locked until only 1 survivor is left. The box will then unlock and allow the last survivor to retrieve the key. Picking up the key will be fast just like pick up an item of the ground. This key will be used to unlock the hatch. The unlocking action will only take a few seconds to preform and will have back to back skill checks. (possibly with the hatch being this difficult to get the killer wont be able to catch the survivor jumping in?) I feel the hatch feature working this way can give the survivor the option to look for the key and escape though hatch or do the last 1-2 gens while the killer will have to protect the last gens + the key box + the hatch. Hopefully this would remove the hatch standoff but still allow a survivor to escape if their teammate made some really bad plays and all died.
---
Thats why i play nurse only.
---
I think the best part about this picture is frank staring at the spirit like ‚ÄúWTF?‚Äù
---
It's her power. She creates a static copy of herself and becomes invisible. After being visible again that copy disappears.
---
My P3 Nea, My main Bitch, always out for that flashlight save, or get the killers attention. She‚Äôs scary and feels like the strongest survivor.
---
My P3 Dwight, you‚Äôre right, the memes are in flight, not much for lockers though. Also out for them flashlight saves.
---
My P3 Tapp, why I got him there I don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs a mystery, but all the shit jigsaw, Amanda and Coleson put him through, I think he just deserved the 8-10 mill BP I sunk into him. 
---
My only prestige‚Äôs survivors (Killer Main)
---
People DC even more now because there's no punishment.  You DC restart the game and you gain your lost pips back.  It's beyond stupid.
---
Pretty much, if there's more than two killers per match the traps bug out
---
You gotta be REALLY bad to be a rank 30 killer
---
Finally we're talking about the real issues here.
---
Niqqa put his name on the meme *facepalm*
---
Rank 30 doesn't exist...
---
If you intentionally DC one game, you can be instantly mori‚Äôd next game.
---
Agreeing with the majority is easier than formulating a thought.
---
If you have BT and still go down you just suck.
---
One game I was playing, not even a minute into the match. I found this Meg and I downed her. The second I picked her up she disconnected. Honestly how much of a sore loser do you have to be to disconnect right when you get downed? Just because you were downed dosen‚Äôt mean you are gonna automatically die
---
Decisive Strike is a Laurie Strode perk.
---
L I B T A R D  
---
My God dude, you really are something special.
---
Meme sucks. Please remove.
---
I love when these get recorded because it shows the rest of the world how stupid they sound when they don't take dying very well. When I first started playing this game a couple years ago I used to think killers who facecamped were the most toxic ones. Experiencing and seeing swf's like this makes me wholeheartedly understand the killer's frustration in this game sometimes.
---
I‚Äôve quite honestly made a legion dc more times than I‚Äôve seen people dc vs them, he‚Äôs pretty easy to play against if like you said he‚Äôs not playing like hot garbage.
---
How do
---
Maybe she was afk and then disconnected, but because there's 2 killers the game didn't end.
---
Look how skillful it was for this player to get caught and then get off of the hook for no reason. Lmao killer needs to just get better respect those 4% upvotes over to me my dudes
---
It looks like such an amazing, welcome addition to the DOOM series, and honestly makes 2016 DOOM look lukewarm in comparison. I'm unbelievably hyped.
---
Kinda meant it as a joke but ok...
---
How
---
Or you can just deal with it and accept your teammate is a cunt.
---
Is there any possibility of cracking down on people who derank to farm noobs they have no business being matched against in yellow rank? The number of derankers I play against is actually insane.
---
Not at all.  He's had the game a day dude.  If you had no idea what you were doing yet you might think getting looped and stomped like that was toxic too.  I mean it's not and there is counterplay to the majority of that but still.  Just because I don't agree work him doesn't mean I can't empathize.
---
I think I called it quits around season 5 cause the story wasn't worth sitting through the gore and incest/rape
---
''Ez'' Said the one survivor that only escaped because of their rank 1 swfs.
---
Cunt
---
Worst part is that this both denies BT and due to hatchet physics goes straight through the unhooker and instant downs you mid-save animation.
---
Same logic applies: Killers that are getting smoked are admitting they're awful when they rage DC.
---
Tunneling as in chasing someone for ages, or tunneling off hook?
---
Probably that. Makes sense. She was attacking sometimes but that‚Äôs it
---
Idk this game is weird as hell
---
just had a match with me playing killer, the game started with only 2 survivors and i loaded in with 2 nurses. even though i couldn't use my power, it was still really fun seeing the glitch on my own pc and freaking out the survivors although letting them get out.
---
Sure, if I can block survivors who do the same.
---
I woulda just let him have it this is too common of an occurrence for me that I feel his pain
---
new killer?
---
Holy shit the Doom Slayer is a nurse main. Now I understand what "Death is not an escape" means.
---
you got downvoted but why else would the killer blur it out.
---
Every time a player DCs, lock their 4th perk slot for 5 games. If they do it again within 5 games, lock the 3rd slot, etc.
---
Nice houseplant.
---
Frosty eyes Legion and Spirit, what a nightmare of a game.
---
Yes I do, but regardless. The more content they create the more bugs they bring to us. THATS what I'm saying, they need to slow it down and focus on the important stuff
---
Would be nice if WGLF would be merged with We'll Make It. Some ability that would affect gameplay would benefit WGLF nicely, and We'll Make It doesn't merit a perk slot by itself
---
A few days ago our queue was over an hour and a half. We all dicked around and rewatched/quoted the full Samination parody series like 4 times.
---
3 of the four survivors said this to me on my 4th game of killer. I have now stopped playing DBD
---
I am watching it now lol!
---
Look at this guy. Counting. Pfffft
---
East Coast idiot here. 
---
No one I know thinks about Trump when people say REEE. What universe are you in?
---
I'm not joking.
---
*"If looks could kill"*
---
Oh my god, the ending! hahahaha
---
Have u not seen the posts on not only Reddit but other social media about this game? Ppl are pissed and just as u say without all that stuff the company wouldn't survive, there's also the fact that players are getting annoyed and getting fed up with continuous bugs and glitches that are simply not getting fixed. This too can cause not only a game but a game company to go under.
---
Thank you. I know what these things are, but i dont know the acronyms...
---
blacktose intolerant lol
---
Laughing when a kid sits something silly is in no way "shitting" on them. Like, this review is pretty adorable, and that (as well as sympathy) is the general reaction here. Did you even read the comments before posting this? Your reaction was the most intense and toxic comment in this entire thread.
---
To get the adept achievement, you need to achieve a merciless victory against the survivors while using all the hags 3 teachable perks.
---
Sadly because of the dbd ranking chages, getting a merciless victory is really difficult to do as you need to play in accordance with the new ranking system. 
---
If you did not get the achievement then it's unlikely that you achieved a merciless victory despite killing all the survivors.
---
That makes sense. It took me a while to figure it all out too.
---
Ok thanks, guess I'll KEEP trying
---
I disagree. I think it makes the game actually balanced. When the survivors are solo the game is in the killers favor.
---
Cancer
---
Methomas?
---
Nurse is incredibly hard to play. You get no warning of how far the blink takes you and it's all learned by feel. Have you even tried playing killer? Because I never mind losing to a nurse. The only nurses I've ever gone against are either Tier 0 or full blown autism and theres no in between.
---
*thunder sound*
---
I have saved this post to my bookmarks bar because it brings me great joy
---
As someone else said, the devs played with this idea but turned it down as it would become an issue just as bad with farming. This is a problem with the game's design. The treatment for this problem (but not a cure) would be to extend the few seconds of invincibility that the survivors get when they are pulled off the hook so they will have a fighting chance.
---
I didn't say it unbalanced the game, I said it gives them an advantage over solo survivors.
---
i finally got the god damn adept leatherface achievement after suffering and pain of 60+ matches
---
Thanks a lot man! Nah, I‚Äôm just a self taught artist. Lately I‚Äôve been shifting my focus towards SFX. I love it!
---
Fucking amazing. Would 100% shit my pants if I met you in the night.
---
Thanks dude!
---
Thanks so much!
---
The most memorable for me was the first time I had an encounter with legion. My friend was telling me how easy that killer was, but I'm not very good so how easy could the killer be? Every time I saw this specific killer I would loop him and lose him in the first second. I could tell he was getting frustrated and soon he only wanted to go after me. But try as he did he really was bad and he never laid a hand in me or anyone else for the rest of the match. Since then I haven't seen that legion killer in rotation much.
---
"ReSpEcT da fOr pAcEnT"
---
Clown all the way! Thank you:)
---
You are right. But all I ever see here is "Freddy buff" and "Delete Legion".
---
I do think these things needed to be addressed a long time ago, but fixing bugs is too broad. Of course they are fixing bugs but dedicating an entire time to only doing that will just make the player base angry. Take Rainbow Six Siege's Operation Health as an example.
---
It's A idea so I'm just putting it out there you don't have to go and just be rude
---
Very kind, thank you!
---
He already has a shirtless option.
---
What do you mean?
---
I think it would be more funny and more scary to not be able to see him
---
Legion is fun to go against, it actually makes a challenge. Wraith just fucks me side way.
---
No, people just like being contrarian with no real higher thought than "this popular trend is bad".
---
Slurs is an obvious one.
---
The best thing to try &amp; get past the ranking system block to adept is to allow survivors to unhook each other as much as possible. 
---
For example, when you teleport to a survivor unhooking another survivor, let the survivor unhook the other then down the unhooked survivor then chase the unhooker. 
---
It will net you more points in the long run while allowing you to dish out the punishment more equally among all survivors which will increase your progress towards getting the merciless victory. 
---
Kicking gens whenever you get the chance also helps you make progress to the gatekeeper emblem which will help you achieve merciless. 
---
Hopefully, they fix the achievements so that getting a 4k with teachable wins the adept rather than the merciless victory.
---
I‚Äôm convinced Xbox dbd is straight up dead. you literally see the exact same ppl everytime or you wait like 10-15 min or longer for a lobby just to see a 200ping no matter what rank you are
---
I think that is the exact point though. The power that your teammates have over your life. It is the exact power that you have when they are put on the hook aswell. You have the choice to try to save them, to leave them, to use them. Life is unfair and in the wrong hands yours could be ended early. Again I'm not saying farming is valid. But it is fair. I personally have been farmed way more times than I can count and it upsets me be that's just how it is. However I never farm anyone and if the killer makes their way back to the unhooked survivor I do my best to get in the way and even take a hit. What I'm saying is that your life becomes vunerable as soon as you get on the hook. I think that's the point and it should stay that way
---
Sure thing, but this video and your post did not address that.
---
You're right
---
They stop saying it when you 4k.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs easy, but sometimes you don‚Äôt get the trap off until your last box, or the Pig bodyblocks you in the basement and crouches so you die, or you don‚Äôt have time to heal and get downed again while trying to get it off, or it explodes. I just think it would be a bit too powerful and frustrating to play against. Plus, knowing when to trap is an important part of playing Pig well, and if you take away the strategic element of that you buff the bad Pigs more than the good ones.
---
Yeah but like, do people really have to be toxic when someone is learning the game?
---
I don't mean for them to just up quit everything and everyone focus on the bugs. I mean they can still make more content and improve things like design and art. But what I'm trying to say is they should slow down a little and give the bug team a chance to get rid of at least 50% of the glitches and bugs. That would make a lot of sense wouldn't it? I mean they would still be working on new content but at the same time we won't get overlapping bugs on top of us repeatedly. That or get a better bug team, I mean ik they are trying but it seems like it takes them months just to fix a few bugs, small ones at that. And when they do fix something it's usually small things instead of the things u see ppl post about on a daily basis
---
*Vile Purges everywhere*
---
Yeah and that's the problem: Even a Nurse that isn't that good but knows how to use her power even moderately well is able to get a 4k because she's just that overwhelming.
---
She's busted.
---
I legit went insane trying the exit gate one after a rank reset with a level 1 survivor.
---
Yes, but a killer could also notice the broken effect and intercept the now easy prey at the most popular unsafe gen on the current map. After 60 seconds, you'd cause the survivor to lose the add-on whilst maintaining the unsafe gen, at the cost of a time investment. Not to mention, it's an ultra-rare, so you wouldn't have Bloodstained Battery plays like that all the time. It's the same concept as powerful killer ultra-rares. There's pretty much no victory against a Tuft-Of-Hair Myers or Mixtape/Cold Dirt Legion, but the items used are rare so you don't deal with it all the time. Same would go for the battery, except even then the Battery only lasts for a single gen, not all match, so it wouldn't necessarily even be that game-changing, just occasionally useful to escape a 3 gen or get a difficult gen and make the rest of the match a bit easier.
---
Wish I had more than one upvote.
---
Because you agreed to play the game. Youre ruining the experience for the rest of the players just because its not going your way. Thats just being a baby. In order to get tunneled, you'd have to be caught in the first place. And if the killer is just beating the shit out of your team, theyre playing better and deserve the win as you deserve the loss.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bug you can do. She probably got bored and DCED
---
The same could be thrown back at that argument. Many ppl also like her as is especially the ones who main her. There's even some ppl among the devs who like her.
---
Fair, I misread what you wrote.
---
I‚Äôve had this before and im level 24
---
S H I R T L E S S M Y E R S
---
Here take mine, :)
---
You‚Äôre a joke, salty killer main here guys.
---
Not if you got Urban Evasion. 
---
It's a great perk that's useful for many things other than crouching in a corner.
---
It happens way less. I get d/c'd on way more as killer than as a survivor.
---
What a stupid fucking point to make. The fact that you think this correlates to siill already shows you have no clue
---
Try again.
---
No you‚Äôre right but a killer can easily ruin a game for everyone by having a shitty connection and making the game almost unplayable. Which causes most disconnects
---
I had 2 toxic survivors dc after i downed them, shows their loserism.
---
Ive gotten this a good bit because im newer to killer and am still learning. Like sis, im rank 17 and youre rank 9. You clearly know that im still learning killer and youre being a dick for no reason. Im so sorry you lived lmao
---
Her addons are getting changed?
---
Lag on the killers side not having it register
---
Wait let me get this straight, you want to explain with WORDS the timing? üòÇ
---
There's no reason to blur out slurs if you blur the name.
---
uh, sure? Like from this am I doing too early too late?
---
Not saying it's common, it's just something cool that some killers do. Is that really so hard to believe?
---
It is OP. This subreddit is primarily killer mains who think a lot of survivors are op.
---
They beg for nerfs all the time and never settle
---
nah happens too consistently for it to be lag
---
Too early
---
Yep, I play killer/survivor about 50/50. 100% of the made up rules are survivor sided. Killer isn't allowed to do anything resembling camping, tunneling, or even just using good addons. What are survivors not allowed to do? Oh yeah, nothing lol. They can bring toolboxes with great addons galore and it's considered fine and balanced.
---
That's all I needed, not the snarky comment before. Thanks.
---
Okay. keep ignoring the fact that there are broken loops
---
Just insta leave after the game unless you want the see the comments.
---
What exactly is a fog streamer? From what you said I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs streamers getting a badge or something from the DBD team, but what exactly is it?
---
The introduction of dedicated servers is very exciting for this game, but any game with dedicated servers terrify me
---
Do you have any End of Life plan for when BHVR inevitably stops supporting this game years from now? Will there remain any way to play this game without needing to connect to an official server that has since been shut down, or will the game simply... die?
---
Quality OC
---
Ran a toxic pig with noed for the 4 last gens, after getting downed with NOED she slugged me and t-bagged, all survivors left me alone in the match with her. But I had pre-nerf DS and she tried dribbling me to a hook, luckily I was too far away so I hit it and made a run for the exit gate. She almost got me but because she slugged me for so long just to tbag me my Dead hard came back and made it out alive because of it.
---
I still find DBD streamers an anomaly. You can only watch the same plays so many times.
---
The most furious tbagger is always the Bill who got mindgamed at a coldwind tile twice in a row.
---
That would be my ideal change as well. I also absolutely despise noed, but with the current state of the game it's kinda a necessary evil. Killers can't really keep up with the speed that gens get done at times.
---
I'm not saying that it's a good perk for the game, but I think right now it's not as bad as it's often made out to be
---
the investigation continues üïµÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs essentially a medley of popular streamers that have a little extra insider knowledge shared with them from the DBD team. These Fog Whisperers applied (I believe that‚Äôs how it happened) for the position, and promote the game in their own way. They get to know things about the game before the rest of us, get special content, and get people hype to play.
---
Best tip is to head straight to the furthest away gen.
---
Check the edges, if I'm a survivor I don't normally jump on a gen straight away. I'll wait for a bit and see if the killer will come over. 
---
9 times out of 10 they'll check the gen but not the surrounding area.
---
It's not just doc but I definitely see more dc s with doc than other killers. 
---
Surviour found 15 seconds into match due to screams 
---
Surviour down 30 seconds later 
---
5 seconds later survivor has did
---
Ok, but the point is survivors do it way more often AND it's worse when survivors do it because they're being wildly selfish and fucking over their teammates.
---
"You have no idea the amount of dead baby survivors behind me"
---
It was on xbox so they messaged me
---
Remove one of the tallies and it's perfect.
---
I definitely wasnt face camping, I'm just new to the game. Think I'll stick to watching it instead of playing
---
And this is a prime example of why you never BM a nurse- the rage you give them could activate their latent nurse abilities and then you‚Äôll all die.
---
Yikes, this shit kinda broken
---
Oh shut up. You‚Äôre probably the toxic SWF who body blocks in doorframes and them lises their shit when killed by noed.
---
To be fair, you have 4x more chances to see a survivor DC than a killer each game.
---
Not anymore its not
---
No Problem ! took a while to make aswell lol:)
---
Beautiful.
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Pant less Jane?
---
It only punishes people who tunnel. But I'm not even going to get into that. And yeah, I said that won't be a cure for something like this. I wouldn't mind for certain aspects of the game getting a complete overhaul like how gens work and etc but who knows what is on the devs mind nowadays.
---
You mean this:  [https://www.deviantart.com/jens56004/art/TheShape3200x1800-742376854](https://www.deviantart.com/jens56004/art/TheShape3200x1800-742376854)  :\_D
---
8 matches.
---
 out of the 32 survivors , 20 disconnected. 
---
Responses to why the disconnected varied between I don't care and its my playstyle I'll play how I want.
---
Sorry, I was using the poop jug. GG.
---
Is she stuck in the tree ?
---
Sorry to bother you guys. What's a good BP farming build on Survivor, for when there's no bonus BP events happening?
---
You shut up. You‚Äôre probably a noed killer who cries when they find your totem and STILL gets upset after being t-bagged for having noed.
---
Wait it‚Äôs something you can replicate? Hopefully they will patch soon
---
That‚Äôs at least from last patch bruh /s
---
What killer do you main?
---
Pig now has 2 bear traps base. More with addons.
---
All Keys can now open bear traps giving them extra utility. 
---
Removing a bear trap now makes a loud noise notification and drop them on the ground instead of vanishing.  The pig can see the aura of traps on the ground and can pick them up to reuse them. 
---
She has to put them back together so pickup time is close to the clowns reload if not slightly longer.
---
&gt; i have more muscle in 1 finger then you do in your whole body
---
uh oh tough internet guy lmfao
---
 For me, that meme usually just results in me accidentally chasing the same guy twice in a row, catching up and injuring them, then having to decide if I'm going to play cool against people who'll probably whine about tunneling, or play efficient because I've already injured them.
---
 When people do this, they remove the killer's ability to not tunnel on purpose, since when you camp and tunnel it's still real easy to find the injured clone, but when you don't, everyone heals and looks the same.
---
/s?
---
Haha
---
I usually make sure the game doesn‚Äôt reach that point. ;) 
---
And I don‚Äôt mind being outplayed, I‚Äôll simply report bannable behaviour.
---
Lucky woman or man ahahaha cheers ü•Ç

I usually make sure the game doesn‚Äôt reach that point. ;) And I don‚Äôt mind being outplayed, I‚Äôll simply report bannable behaviour.

LOL I have to laugh.

I mean if you go to rescue someone and they kick you for the shit and giggles, you leave them on their own fate. Easy as that.

Lol steel chair weapon.

Just remember one thing with teachable perks. They still show up randomly for other survivors, so level up the character that gives the perk first so that it's easier to get it with your main character. It's a terrible system haha.
---
As a crappy killer you can kill mediocore survivors for sure.
---
As a mediocore killer you can kill pretty good survivors aswell.
---
So please no Killer tears please.
---
If the survivor left was sandbagging and did not even attempt to unhook then I will struggle till shirtless Myers is a reality.
---
Please do üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Actually the first person to use the exact same perk build as me on nurse
---
Not neccesarily, if i hook someone take 3 steps their teamate comes to unhook them am I really tunneling if I down the injured guy again, and regardless why should i be punished for that?
---
As a killer main I take offense to this but it is really true
---
This is a fair point lol but you addressed the other side of it.  Other dude literally just complained about the exact other side of this because he says he isn't able to tunnel them lol.  Going as far to admitting he would disband the chase entirely solely because they aren't on death hook haha.
---
This is exactly like me! I was just playing with my brother yesterday running Adam with deliverance trying to make sure he could get some blood points which is what made me wanna post this.
---
I would recommend playing with a couple friends to get used to her base two blinks, no add ons no perks. Its a matter of practicing with blinking and immediately trying to hit your target. But since you have a lot of hours with killer anyways you might be fine to take her in to a normal game, i dont know your style so...
---
Shes mostly just a practice makes perfect character like any character. Though unlike the shape who can run just about any perk and do well or the billy who can rev to win, nurse is dependent on practice with her outplays on her blink.
---
Sorry i cant be much help but thats what i have learned from playing against her/ as her
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Watchardethas nurse tutorials, his nurse is litterally insane.
---
Dude the killer missed the 360 right by a hook. He downs her there and he doesn't even have to juggle.
---
I wonder who the toxic one here is.
---
I mean when a killer does it, the game just ends, and depending on how early they do it, they completely waste any offering you brought, and if they do it late also still cheat you out of points. Hell I've seen killers literally run Franklin's demise, hit you, then leave to also take away your item.
---
When survivors do it it sucks, and can just make the game far less enjoyable true, but you CAN still continue to play the match at least.
---
It didn't guarantee her anything. Meyers missed her twice right by hooks which would negate ds entirely.
---
WHEN
---
I do if they tbag while I'm Michael.
---
How does Myers missing before even contribute? He was gonna kill her but her DS stunned him so he couldn‚Äôt hook her.
---
Lol, no, If a killer wants to tunnel and has a decent amount of skill it will be nigh impossible to lose the killer,. But a bit like i mentioned if the team was any good they'd be finishing off the last gen and/or opening the gates within 5 minutes, you don't really need pallets if the gates are open.
---
Can we talk about Spirit for a second ? She's so THICC ! Please nerf Spirit's ass right now !!!
---
So? She still escaped only because of her DS. If she didn‚Äôt have it she couldn‚Äôt have made it to hatch.
---
High reward? Interesting.
---
Sadly, it seems nobody cares what the reason is, if they think they‚Äôre better they‚Äôll tell you. 
---
But hey don‚Äôt quit! Fun tip, you click on the speech bubble next to the text box you can hide the chat so you don‚Äôt even know what the survivors said!!
---
After all, a killer doesn‚Äôt concern himself with the opinions of meat.
---
Damn Susie you are one naughty girl
---
The first person found is THE most important survivor. It could make or break the game
---
Not at all but it gets better. Youll meet alot of good folks who make up for the bad. And the always fun sitting back and watch them argue with each other. Ive had a survivor say"Stay out of this killer! You did nothing wrong!"
---
nice post
---
Thing is, I'm on xbox. They directly messaged me. Only thing I can really do is instablock everyone I play with lol
---
They didn't have a choice. They dropped from the game. Like an actual dc. 
---
But the funny thing is, the person complaining here decided to dc as well cause I guess he didn't want to get hooked.
---
Smh no respect for the Kobe. A survivor gets that 4% you let them go dammit.
---
Also the other sides equivalent.  Ebony Mori, NOED Gamer camper saying the same post game lol.  GG EZ....ummmm well yeah did...did you expect it to be hard with all that?
---
I actually agree, I wasn't thinking of tunneling like that. My line of thought was more like focusing down the one person for an entire game instead of that occasion and I didn't mean to imply that tunneling isn't a legit way to play the game. I was thinking more along the lines of, "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."
---
Yep but she could escape with teleport
---
Is setting messages to friends only a thing? I only dabble in Xbox, I think that shit is unplayable at the moment lol
---
Yea, some baby survivors dont like playing against the Doc. I actually like it, maybe I'm a weirdo.
---
In a rush or something?
---
Oh, bother..
---
IF YOU GUYS ARE SCEPTICAL ABOUT AUTO AIM
---
 When you sacrifice someone and his body goes in the sky, try M1ing where the body would be if it was hanging. You‚Äôll automatically go up in the sky.
---
If you have problems with tunneling, DS can help you.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why I am sort of leaning towards Spirit at this point. There isn‚Äôt much to be done against Plague. Thanks!
---
Jesus, this is incredible! I hate how moist you made him look :_) I'm rightfully unsettled by how realistic it is!
---
Lol socko a mori!
---
Ah so I'm blinding during the animation and that's why it's not classing as a save. Thanks a bunch!
---
Is she hard to learn though? Lol
---
Yeah the FPS was so horrendous lmao, another reason I dont really play. PC cant run it either unfortunately
---
Living for the lore included, yaaaas
---
Spirit is much stronger than Plague, but she requires decent game sense and tracking. Also, her perks are better than Plague‚Äôs imo. I would recommend Spirit but in terms of fun, they‚Äôre both quite enjoyable so I don‚Äôt think either would be a bad choice.
---
She‚Äôs harder to learn than plague, but she‚Äôs not THAT hard.  Once you get used to her power it‚Äôs so good
---
Just recommend using a headset while playing, so you can hear more clearly because hearing is key with her
---
*The good, the bad, and the ugly music plays*
---
Haha yes
---
Uh do you play dbd? Missing twice caused a cooldown period for the killer which allowed Meg to get closer to the hatch. If he didn't miss either time then he could have dribbled her to a hook negating ds entirely.
---
Or try a different killer. Im a beast with like 6 of them but cant do nurse or huntress
---
Ah I see
---
Sorry, English is not my mother language. I was trying to be ironic. I was not saying I didn't believe, I was asking myself why would a killer do that to a survivor if they didn't do nothing kind to you, ever? If youre not able to hook anyone in a match, no survivor will sacrifice him self. They will tbag you instead, spamming their flashlights and make noises. You don't have to give the hatch to anyone nor respect the 4%.
---
If you would like to explain how Freddy doesn't fit "losing sight of survivor during chase allows you to see their aura," feel free to do so.
---
I never said anything about "how good killers have it." That's not what this conversation is about.
---
I usually just say "gg :)". But once there was this toxic survivor that was being the worst towards me and his survivor team. I might have lost it in chat when he said "EEEEEZZZZZ"
---
People see the doctor and they dc
---
Go for Plague if you don't want to invest time learning on how to play Spirit. Spirit is better than plague because of her outplay potential during chases. Plague's drawback is that survivors control your power via not cleansing making you a standard m1 normal speed killer. Easily looped and jungle jimmed to death.
---
Seems pointlessly angry, to be honest.
---
Weird because I hardly saw any d/c before my hiatus
---
Holy fuck how thick are you? If she didn‚Äôt have DS what would‚Äôve happened? She would‚Äôve been hooked. Why is that hard to believe?! If she didn‚Äôt have DS she wouldn‚Äôt have survived.
---
Yeah...a certain streamer promoted dcing against killers they didnt like going against.
---
This is just so fucking perfect man lol.  Best meme I've seen on here in a long time.
---
BP gain % penalty for the next match/matches.
---
It gets increased gradually how many matches youre getting the penalty, which can also be a different %
---
Until it reaches a point that youre getting banned for a day/days/entire week because some people dont give a fuck about BP
---
Awwww yeees. Nice work!
---
I feel like the plague could fit better to you. With the spirit you can easily mind game yourself as a beginner.
---
The plague is a very solid and fun killer, you should definitely try her out!
---
I couldnt care less about karma.
---
legion ok , but shirtless Myers wont stop
---
Don't worry. As per all changes it will get rolled back the following patch.
---
Long strides, not fast ones.
---
i agree with this, i was trying nurse and everyone would have gotten away but one decided to hang back and martyr herself just so i could get a kill cause she could tell i had no idea what i was doing on nurse.
---
Have faith dammit!
---
‚ÄúThanks, Tricia. Now here‚Äôs the weather from Mt. Ormond. Ollie?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI CAN‚ÄôT SEE A DAMN THING!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThanks, Ollie.‚Äù
---
Nah your good, irony and sarcasm too are very hard to communicate over text
---
Thanks for the input!
---
Also killer can't get disconnected from the host.
---
Ok I‚Äôll keep that in mind.
---
Good points. Thanks!
---
Good luck! :)
---
3 killers?
---
I wish there was a way to try them before you buy them
---
Then you don‚Äôt make any sense. How is op getting chased a full five minutes bad?
---
So thick that if the killer was me, it'd be a 4k I guess. Honestly she might have survived since he might have missed a 360 again. 
---
&gt;That Meg was dead no questions asked but her perk **guaranteed** her win.
---
&gt;What? No, if that Meg didn‚Äôt use that DS she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten hatch. She was **guaranteed** a win.
---
I only insta kill myself when i feel like the survivor deserves it. Most of the tine tho these last survivors are the once who hide in lockers, didnt do gens or got insta downed so i struggle until they get killed.
---
Justice must be done lad's!
---
Wish Jason was in the game
---
I‚Äôd cream everywhere if I had a match with Myers, freddy and Jason in one match lol
---
Spirit is easymode and overpowered (inb4 downvotes from insulted spiritmains) I think she will get nerfed in the future though once BHVR gets their head out of their asses and takes a good look at winrate per killer. 
---
Same goes for her "good perks" spirit fury is a way too overpowered not fun to play against perk which should get nerfed anyday now but considering BHVR being trash it will probably grant you some ez wins for at least 2 more years.
---
The problem is neither, survivor or killer, it's part of the community
---
Nah. She wouldn‚Äôt have made it anywhere close to the hatch if she hadn‚Äôt known how to run him and juke him. If she only relied on ds, she would‚Äôve been downed because the distance was too far to just run straight to the hatch.
---
Duhuuude, I‚Äôd be so fucking mad lmao *excellent*
---
I've had this happen to me but we were in the lobby forever, the game never started.
---
Idk I think Laurie just shanked ya
---
Its not fair by a long shot. I play killer more than survivor and its always this way. For the toxic players it doesnt matter what you do , 4k, 4escape, only 1 survived, 2 died. It doesnt matter if you play by their rules. They will always crap on killer. 
---
Toxic players dont make majority, but if Im gunna get shit on no matter what I rather get it from winning. And you cant get rid of toxic from a pvp game. They will bully or bitch no matter what. 
---
Best we can do is learn from mistakes, improve and just deal with it. I try to get them to discuss it with me.. like last night while playing Freddy, I was called sweaty after 4king. So I asked them what that even means. Not like I ran eboni moris on the best killers with the best addons.... im freddy, yall the ones sweaty tryin to survive a... freddy.. not still bitter or anything/s lol.
---
Hey Billy
---
That is fair. But I think this video explains what I mean. https://youtu.be/peFfFHqBk-c
---
Wow, great hatchet throw! Poor Survivor barely even left the hook and was already downed oof.
---
There's a good reason for that, David and Daniel ran out of material to write off and started having to write original content themselves (based off vague guidance from George).
---
Worse news is that there apprantly writing in a new star wars saga project.
---
Yup. Grr...
---
I didn't say he was. If a legion want to cheese it'll happen.
---
that‚Äôs why it was funny though. like super sarcastic.
---
kinda like, almost dying to someone in a moba and then saying ‚Äúnot even close‚Äù when you literally got away lucky with 1hp
---
A lot of people pull out their ethernet cords making them lose connection, but I don't know if it's most of the people who DC or a minority
---
/r cursed images
---
Agreed.
---
Good Legions will moonwalk at you to tick down the bleed and continue following. Eventually you have to choose between going down or mending and going down anyway.
---
Frenzy guarantees a down. Period. It is not counterable.
---
Damnit
---
I know! I think it's the sunglasses, reminds me of Ricky's classic pair of $3 gas station sunnies
---
Check 1/20 off the achievement!
---
Utter nonsense. You just don't lose pips when you DC any more, so people do whatever they like.
---
Ever hold down shift as a killer.. makes me feel faster. That and making race car sounds.
---
I was literally playing my first game of Spirit vs a team who had a DC. I was going to go easy while I learned Spirit's quest and not hook them. From the Claudette in the aftergame lobby "ez baby killer". At least the other survivor understood, and after I clarified it was my first game with Spirit and I didn't want to be sweaty Claudette shut up.
---
People are assholes, and when they take advantage of kindness, then I bring out Insidious Leatherface or Full Map Aura Doctor. &gt;;)
---
Oh shit, you're right haha 
---
Sorry OP.
---
I'm love him
---
Shouldn't go out of your way to insult people because they play a Killer you don't like. It's childish.
---
Don't let people get to you. If you want man I'll friend you and we can totally do some KYFs to get you practice in a non-sweaty environment. :)
---
haha funny shirtless Myers comment ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
tbh, I only DC aka rage quit if I get downed because of someone else. if the game just started and Dwight, albeit accidentally, body blocks the pallet or window so I can't escape, that really irritates me
---
I don't think you should quit. Sure, people are assholes from time to time, but in my experience it's a minority. 
---
I mean, you said it yourself: You're learning. Who cares if they shit on you? If they were that proud of winning against someone *who doesn't even know what they're doing*, then that says something about them. I know it's easier said than done, but try to not let it get under your skin.
---
Your best option would be disabling chat completely.People will always try to belittle you even if you did very well because their fragile ego got broken by you
---
i wish kyf gave you the abilities to try all killers and all perks
---
Teabagging is something that doesn't help you win. The only reason you teabag is to make someone else feel bad. Bad players tunnel and face camp because they feel it's strategically their best option to remove a survivor from the match, which is their primary objective.
---
One is the action of someone who will do anything within the rules of the game to win, the other is the action of someone who gets off on making other people feel bad.
---
Read it again. Not trashing the Plague overall. Just this play style. These Plague players don‚Äôt even bother going to fountains cause this way of playing doesn‚Äôt even require you to. Just puke, follow, survivor goes broken, hit. Lazy.
---
I don't camp, I just thought it was a funny meme
---
Let the salt fuel you.  Every time you get bullied by a toxic swf just let it motivate you to get better and 4k them next time
---
Unfortunately I have it on Xbox. And I'm sure you know how bad the Xbox version is. So it's not entirely the community, it's also the fact that the game is quite shit on console
---
Yeah, it's an unintended exploit. Killer has a right to be annoyed about it, but I don't usually report over it myself. (Did your other post get removed? Weird.)
---
Same actually. I had a Feng stay behind after she saw me totally blink into and not past the exit gate wall to cut someone off. I used her to finish my Nurse quest and carried her to the gate and thanked her in aftergame chat. The group was actually really nice, and you live for games like that.
---
PSA: Survivors are supposed to do the gens as fast as possible in order to escape, and aren‚Äôt supposed to get hit so if you chase them forever and can‚Äôt hit them that‚Äôs on you not them ‚Äúlooping‚Äù
---
I get this one all the time. Use addons to reduce frenzy cooldown. Then you gotta loop like an idiot who doesnt know how the game works to get your chase time. Oh noooo I cant seeem to caaatch you- checks stop watch-
---
I'm basing my opinions on characters by assuming they aren't exploiting. Even moonwalking takes at least as long as a normal chase.
---
Peace was never an option
---
to be fair you were playing nurse with ruin, shadowborn, and nurses calling (i dont count bbq cause it's use for bloodpoints)
---
Guess that should be their number one focus. Fix their broken game.
---
No wonder why people are leaving matches - don't blame them.
---
"After all, a killer doesn't concern himself with the opinions of meat." Man, hell of a beautiful killer quote. That shit ahould be framed.
---
Plague in vomit form in very mid tier and easy to loop...
---
Are you talking about jendenise? if you actually watched her stream this month you would know that from the previous rank reset she pretty much stayed rank 4-1 all the way until obviously yesterday. 
---
Of course it's very easy to hate on someone without actually checking the facts beforehand though.
---
Plague is one of my fav killers to play as survivor. Not even close to legion
---
It's not even about the player, the character overall has a toxic gameplay.
---
Thinking Libtard is an acceptable insult.
---
Nah that's the plague
---
When y'all quit using literally any excuse to disconnect.
---
You for using franks
---
When someone sends toxic messages I just say ‚Äúgg!‚Äù and queue up another game. Try to not let those games get you down to the point of quitting because there‚Äôs a good bit of fun to be had in this game. Run the tea baggers through the exit, ignore the chat, and queue up again. üëçüèº
---
Had a end game build(no noed calm down) and right as I hooked someone for bloodwarden my package arrived.   Got accused of face camping when really afk.
---
He *did* get buffed though after the PTB. He had a double stun when hitting someone who already had deep wounds. With that, he was very weak.
---
What is your solution? Don't vomit on players until broken? If you see a broken player, stop your chase immediately and run to the other side of the map? Break them and go to the opposite side of the map to get corrupt purge so you can down them that way instead? Vomit only a little bit and make survivor work their way up to broken status? There's no way to solve your issue that doesn't involve giving up on survivor midchase, and that's a damn good way to ensure you get no kills and win no matches.
---
Subscribe people who dc to duolingo
---
It's literally a different game from then. The focus of chases, of how pallets work, and so on -- everything is completely different. Even Hillbilly is a different character altogether. 
---
He did a great job of summarizing how much changed on the perk side of things.
---
Excellent use of the meme, if only you put each mask on each person
---
Legion is excuse enough.
---
That won't work if they heal.
---
Believe it or not, there are several viable strategies when it comes to most killers, and not a single one of them has to abide to your view on how they're "supposed to be played."  
---
Take this from a fellow survivor main:  
---
Grow up, dude.
---
Lol well I‚Äôll be damned that a killer main finally agreed with me lol
---
( softly ) dont.
---
Scare them with the hidden offering lol
---
Look at the title smarty pants.
---
If they won't swing, then hit them with a pallet or even stop running to reset bloodlust, then chase like normal. Plague is much worse at injured chases than nearly every other chase killer. (Legion excluded.)
---
the baff!
---
Right. Her corrupt form is amazing. 
---
so if she‚Äôs not using it then she‚Äôs putting herself at a clear disadvantage. 
---
Never interrupt your opponent if they‚Äôre making a mistake.
---
they were sure i had a mori
---
plague is just unfun to play against
---
I'd make it so each time a gen is done the timer goes down faster.
---
Might be a bit too op unless it's a well coordinated swf team though been then it would waste time easily
---
I like how Feng went FtM in this review
---
Ok, thanks for letting mr know!
---
This looks great. You did fantastic as well in capturing his old age with the wrinkles. The cracked and faded make-up over the forehead adds good detail.
---
Hey you guys I‚Äôm just gonna take a baff
---
Its time for an intervention Megan.
---
Huge fan of Evil dead but I passed on Ash. Why does Ash look nothing like Bruce? Did you guys get only get the character license and not the actor likeness? (That promo art looked great) Between this and your high priced clothing, you guys are making it difficult to give you money.
---
What am I looking at?
---
That‚Äôs an axe I‚Äôd be willing to take.
---
Not sure why the downvotes are coming in. Pig would be better off with a buff to the speed of timer progression and making it take a set amount of boxes to unlock it (2 in current state, 1 if they decrease speed of unlocking). The whole purpose of the traps are to delay obj progression after being hooked and like you mentioned, you can still do your own thing and wait out most of the timer. The traps need to tick faster making it almost mandatory for survivors to get them off before anything else, thus slowing down the game like they intend.
---
As a low rank survivor I kinda like being found first. I'm high rank killer so I am usually the best in chases compared to the others. Now if only they realize how to make a safe unhook.
---
Nah..... any killer that knows how to pressure survivors is the one to hate.
---
The progression meter after she lands the skill check.
---
It's not good for hatchet reload speed, because deerskin gloves do the same thing (and reloading times aren't long enough that it seems necessary to waste a perk for reloading). It can help pinpoint survivor who are in lockers hiding, but they're not usually going to leave close enough to you that the exposed effect will matter. 
---
Whispers is better for finding survivors, and an addon is better for reload speed. But it's not terrible if you're building her up and don't have anything better to put there.
---
yo that doc looks pretty fresh
---
some great skill checks
---
How?
---
This is obviously photoshop because the tally marks arent supposed to be there
---
*oh*
---
I only have Spirit so can't compare, but she is a lot of fun to play as.
---
yeah, he looks dummy thicc. 10/10 qt.14 would smash
---
I see no problem here. Why wouldn't you want this sexy beast in your match?
---
Just kind of reading through your responses on how this killer is "supposed to be played" seems pretty derpy, especially given how the majority of survivors don't "play as intended" via looping. 
---
I'm not trashing looping, survivors, or playstyles. I'm trashing your logic. 
---
Also, did you edit your OP to take out how you send vile messages? Multiple responses point out how you said that, but I don't see it. Are you a toxic person that goes out of the way to insult someone, then tries to hide it? If so, shame on you. You're part of reason this community is generally so toxic
---
you post the chat but you blur it out? what is clicky clicky?
---
But if you tunnel, 4k, DS, play legion or really just use any built in mechanic at all, someone will get butthurt. I feel like any comment is a clear example of r/kidsarefuckingstupid
---
That sounds useless to me tho, it‚Äôs just taking up a spot, I don‚Äôt believe her humming is directional and I never had problems finding people with her even in the red ranks, I don‚Äôt play her often nd was thinking of maining her that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt really know what to add to my last slot
---
Doing gens. You?
---
Spirit. She‚Äôs a top 3 Killer while Plague is in the bottom 3. Spirit does require some practice, but she is able to quickly down Survivors and surprise them. Plague can injure them faster and has unlimited hatchets for 60 seconds, but she is basically a 115% M1 Killer after breaking the Survivor and you can easily hide until her Corrupt Purge expires.
---
This new freddy rework is insane!
---
Thanks dude, very much appreciated!
---
Just played a decent plague, she killed my team pretty easily, I ended up looping her until she got too fast, but it took her around 2 min to down me..I'm not even that great and didn't have many pallets left to use..so I don't see the issue, Legion however is just annoying, you can loop and loop but eventually you have to just stop mend and pray.
---
I mean if she can hit that, she deserves the down.
---
Explain this to me please? Injured chases? I‚Äôve played since day 1 and I haven‚Äôt heard anyone tell me this. Fill me in cause I‚Äôm lost haha
---
You realize how weak Legion is, correct? Also, did Ash know that prior to abandoning his team and ruining the match?
---
Damn you still on this? Lmfao nobody forcing you to look at it.
---
They do beg for nerfs and stuff.
---
I'm a prime Meg example of how unfun I can make the game for the killer with my squad. The game is still balanced as it's ever been, but v survivor sided if the survs are playing well even vs an equally skilled killer.
---
Iron maiden is faster and you can't run out of it because it's a perk .
---
unfortunately the spirit (me) couldn't move. at all. and the plague couldn't vomit. clown was fine though
---
Beautiful Chuckle At The End.
---
It‚Äôs all in the context. It‚Äôs not too difficult to differentiate between BM and what‚Äôs not. Especially if you play killer often.
---
If you find tbagging after outplaying the killer to be ‚Äúplayful‚Äù then you shouldn‚Äôt have any problem seeing the facecamping as playful too. Just a game after all :)
---
Oh god! He turned... ASIAN!
---
That sucks, but imagine how much of a killer trio that could be. Clown and Plague would already work good together. With spirit they would be even stronger
---
There were a lot of nerfs in the early stages of the game to both sides. Within the past several updates it's been mainly nerfs to survivors and their perks and buffs to the killers. Although some survivor nerfs are understandable, it gets old having it done in every patch while having killers and or their meta perks buffed. Dont nerf one side and buff the other. Either or. It's been so frustrating that after 1400 hours I stopped playing the game. My mood had increased dramatically, but shout out to all on both sides who can stick with it.
---
You have to get Merciless Killer while using that Killer‚Äôs three unique perks. This can either be easy or nearly impossible depending on the Killer and rank you‚Äôre at.
---
if there are super toxic players I absolutely will at least proxy camp them fuck that
---
There are times where I get downed super early and feel like DCing. Those same games still result in pips.. I wish people would just be patient. It makes 0 sense to DC.
---
I might be remembering wrong but did they change Ruin as well? Unless I'm really remembering wrong didn't the green versions use to affect only 2 survivors and purple all survivors? Just noticed that even at green Ruin affects all survivors.
---
Yeah that would be a bit more balanced
---
You're playing as Legion, with the most annoying fucking add-ons ever, you show little to no empathy in the entire round. You couldn't even fuck around with the Adam for a few seconds because you were too busy sweating. You're being extremely toxic and I'm not sure you realize it. Legion is one of the most tedious and un-fun killers to play against. So in my opinon, you're in the wrong here. You need more empathy in you're life.
---
Basically the wraith....just no fog.
---
Ooof, yeah, that happens on both sides... and with the new match making, both sides get random ass players.
---
Still, I'd say keep playing. Imho it's kinda like playing a game like OW and practicing a new hero in comp. You're going to be bad for a while and people from both sides are going to give you shit for it, but practice makes perfect and you'll get better eventually.
---
Watched the first 30 seconds to realize it‚Äôs a 6 minute clip. No thanks.
---
There's also a ton of weak people who quit because the match isnt going their way.
---
Not my fault someone quit.
---
I've never disconnected on purpose. Not even once.
---
I find them an anomaly but not for that reason. I‚Äôd actually say DBD is one of those games that plays out differently every match and warrants an audience. But the community is so toxic and weird, they‚Äôre constantly playing off that and it makes for a lot of cringe while watching.
---
I main nurse on the killer side. People who talk about the "learning curve" as an excuse on why she's fine as is, don't seem to understand how long it takes to learn her. I became a pretty solid nurse player within 20-30 hours. Not thousands like many seem to claim. She is extremely broken in many ways, especially her add ons. She really needs to be looked at in that department.
---
Why not? Anyone against this is clearly one who rage quits themselves. Most other games have a penalty like this.
---
Make a whole montage of this.
---
Reporting is pointless
---
I had joined a pickup group after a good game, played 2 more games, both went well because we worked well together. Well, the player who started the group put LOL EZ KILLER after the match, so I left the group. They messaged me and was like hey what happened? I told them that it wasn't cool and bad sportsmanship and glhf. They messaged me a few more times apologizing and what not, but I don't really like the bad sportsmanship.
---
There shouldn't need to be an incentive to stay. This didnt used to have to be a thing in multiplayer videogames. I really dont understand where this whole reward me for playing your game nonsense came from. If people rage quit just ban them there's your incentive to stay if you dont you wont be able to play anymore.
---
What?I've seen a bunch of people have this bug when it turns text to just unreadable.
---
Like it should say "Fixing generators" but instead it is saying "Of cource im joking I speak german btw XDD"
---
‚ÄúStop camping hooks you tunneler!‚Äù
---
If there is no way for me to save them I just tea bag the hatch and hope they suicide.
---
Debatable. The point of him is to keep everyone mending so that they aren't doing gens. Eventually that time wasted works in the favor of Legion. He takes his time sure, but its because he has a global pressure around the map.

Nothing else I can do other than apologize on behalf of this game's shitty matchmaking system.
---
:(
---
I wish I could do this, but I get on edge and anxious when I go easy on survivors because they trash talk me and call me a baby killer in the post game.
---
I can't remember the last time those kind of codes were given away. Unfortunately - it would seem the sure-fire way to obtain them now is through eBay.
---
Thank you x)
---
&gt;the killer still wants to play normal when someone D/C's
---
That is fine, I don't.
---
Actually, no, that was harsh of me. You're just both becoming what you're complaining about.
---
That too.
---
Some Trapper buttfucked me and my entire team. We barely got one gen done because he pulled an Ace off and we kept going in fear of being next if we didn‚Äôt hurry. We all got put in the basement together bc he had BBQ and hunted us down. After we were all dead Ace said ‚ÄúGG LMAOO BABY KILLER EZ‚Äù He died first. The killed had a near perfect score while a Feng was the only to get to 15k bp.
---
I‚Äôm becoming a toxic survivor main? Maybe it‚Äôs for the best.
---
It's funny because I used to be a really nice killer (and I still am pretty nice) but after getting my ass kicked a few times and having the survivors teabag and mess with me, it just made me angry and not want to be nice in the future. Like I used to feel bad for killing them (lol) and now I don't.
---
Brace yourselves the DC is coming

Going back a few days, those of you that know the 600 upvote post, expect that next Saturday. An actual, quality shirtless David is on the way  ;D
---
They will probably add a crouch cooldown before fixing other balancing issues. While I dont agree with tbagging, this has just been a part of gaming since the dawn of the internet. Quick and effective. I think it is just something that everyone needs to be exposed to. Everyone needs to learn how to not be a salt factory.
---
Nice matchmaking
---
Why is looping not playing as intended?
---
Not gonna lie, this actually looks better then regular one. Good job
---
usually, i don't have a problem at all if the killer is running NOED but seriously now, how can someone run NOED on Billy?
---
[Templates](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols)
---
Not really, them teabagging isn't making it anyway harder for me to play the game, as I can do everything as killer normally and they aren't affecting my gameplay.
---
Them facecamping is making is so I can't do anything in that match, and everyone else in the match isn't getting any action either. It is affecting gameplay. It's not the same at all.
---
Nah man being raised in the sky makes me wanna kms even more. And I'm already dead by that point.
---
Guess who mains nurse.
---
I cannot imagine the developers thought of this game and the methods survivors would use to escape and thought, "Okay, so these kids are going to have to run circles around the same object in order to escape."
---
I'm not saying looping is bad, I do it myself, but I'm saying it cannot possibly be an intended playstyle from the get-go.
---
The only times I DC are when the game lags so bad that I never had a chance to vault or throw a pallet. Only seems to happen on console though. There‚Äôs moments on PC where there‚Äôs lag, but nothing like on console.
---
Every game now is just teabagging at the exit if even a single survivor gets there. It‚Äôs actually starting to get on my nerves.
---
It happens.......................... more than you think lol
---
Sounds like 80% of this community.
---
Nurse spirit and Plague
---
Idk who you're talking about, so I have no clue if they're a shitty player, but if you're purposely using the wrong pronouns for someone, well, you're just as shitty
---
whenever somebody DCs when downed, i always imagine the killer quoting the Cloaker from PAYDAY 2, saying "now go to the forums and cry like the little bitch you are!"
---
when i think about it like that, it at least makes me laugh, knowing that the survivor who quit because can't accept losing for whatever reason has screwed over his entire team and it's only minutes before everyone dies and the only way of surviving is to hope like hell that at least 2 gens were done so that someone MIGHT get out of this shitshow alive. 
---
is it really THAT hard to accept that sometimes you just die first?
---
But who is the ‚Äúfit asian man‚Äù? LOL
---
When you hit that Extremely great skillcheck.
---
When the survivors are at the gate and everyone is either at the gate too or already escaped but they're sitting there anyway just so they can spam click their flashlights and teabag you
---
TIL Jake is Asian. I‚Äôve always wondered but never done research, haha. 
---
It‚Äôd make sense for him to be Korean as Park is a SUPER popular Korean surname. Disappointed in myself as a DBD fan, lol.
---
Or you're wrong?
---
Ah okay, I can definitely see how it's a dick move in that context
---
I suppose they removed the whole grabbing idea because Freddy is invisible but still they should have allowed Freddy to grab survivors if there are in the dream transition state. Stops survivors abusing the transition to complete actions.
---
Because it recycles as you hit people.
---
I see tunnelling as something good if you‚Äôre able to last in chases. If the person is tunnelling you it leaves everyone else free to do gens. Tunnelling is not a good strat unless the person has been hooked before and you want the kill.
---
It's just her standard cosmetic with Florals.
---
This only happens with licensed killers tho.
---
Go on the store and see.
---
F you're talking about the extra cosmetic if you buy the chapter, it changes her white shirt to a pink floral pattern.
---
Really?! Awesome! :D
---
 Nea always points at killer
---
I guess crouching behind stuff is just as hard as breaking totems.
---
I'm not talking about in-game. I'm talking about the support page, where you can add additional information to a player report, and usually get an email back within a few days.
---
Nah - game too buggy.
---
Honestly her RBTs are a joke. RNG can screw you and every RBT could be disarmed after the first box, they dont even start ticking until a gen pops, and some SWFs will just 99% gens until their teammate finds the key.
---
Yellow rank noobs DCing. Wow. Amazing.
---
I think you did fine. You didn't multi stab people and you ran past one survivor in a nice mindgame. Props to you for being a good Legion.
---
That's cool. It's their game. They can play how they like.
---
Its because hes invisible. 
---
If they are in dream transition, they should let him grab.
---
I‚Äôm there right now.
---
Just wait until he finds out that for Day 100, u/ZombieHugger is going to dress up as Ace and recreate the meme in real life
---
This picture (and some of the posters in this thread) is a prime example of why the term toxic holds no meaning here anymore. 
---
Blocking the hook to try and stop a survivor from getting hooked, an action that is rewarded with "Protection" points and is rewarded by the perk "We're Going to Live Forever", and is countered by the perks "Mad Grit" and "Iron Grasp", and countered by pressing M1. Totally toxic.  
---
God forbid the survivors actually work as a team. Good teamwork is toxic.
---
i rarely play killer so i‚Äôm still in the bad ranks.. usually people never dc though i just feel kinda bad for them because i tried my best to not tunnel or camp :/
---
Give her a green addon that increases the keys needed to 2. Add a pink addon that adds 3 keys.
---
Dead by gaylight
---
It‚Äôs denies the killer hook points, right? If they disconnect before they get hooked, that is.
---
? As in it only works on one or two people?
---
rancor for the aura reading and mori
---
You need the survivors to stay alive as long as possible while also getting lucky enough to DC. You need 5k points (about) in every category in order to get Merciless killer. You end chases too quickly? Too bad. Someone dies/disconnects before the third hook? Too bad. You're able to kill survivors using the melee instead of spamming the power? Too bad. The achievement also has a generator multiplier, so if the survivors do more than 2 gens you might be shit out of luck. 
---
The only reason I was able to get Adept is by messaging the survivors and asking for help by offering to farm points before killing them/offering to join them in survive with friends afterwards. The achievements in this game are ridiculous to try in a real match. So if anyone helps you, always, ALWAYS, pay it forward when someone messages you.
---
....its just courteous to tell a survivor to put away any valuable add ons if you don't plan on letting them live.
---
The fact that you think Dead by Daylight is a competitive game is ridiculous.
---
Wat
---
Drag by Daylight üòÇ
---
You.
---
But the killer still gets the quitter bonus so it doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
Rofl
---
I mean if it was a perk.
---
r/comedycemetery
---
Trailer park boys !
---
Dream transition. Transition. Not state.
---
what are you talking  about?
---
Its a perk and it doesnt cycle through anything
---
Sure, you can "rework" Nurse, just as soon as you "rework" SWF.
---
It is not that he is bad in chases, but that he is the most notorious killer for abusing how the game understands a chase. 
---
Wound a survivor with Frenzy and back out of range to "end the chase," according to the game. Then you can simply follow the survivor who now has a timer ticking down and can do almost nothing about it. Once the timer is low enough, then it's up the Legion to press M2 again to catch up and catch the survivor while they attempt in vain to mend.
---
Deeeeeeecent!
---
It's almost as if the ranking system means nothing :thinking:
---
They really need to fix auras on that map.
---
Twechneckly, ds would have still worked if it was the new one, so it wouldnt make a difference
---
I think the best ‚Äúrework‚Äù she could get is have her blinks set in a pool each with a 10 second cool down(Maybe too long idk). So if she uses 2 she has to wait 20 seconds for both or 10 seconds to use a blink again. Doesn‚Äôt take away her blinks and still keeps the skill gap. But there does lie an issue bc it takes two hits to down so waiting 20 seconds between 2 blinks when she‚Äôs one of the slowest moving will be an issue. I‚Äôm not sure if they have even announced a nerf but I‚Äôm curious to see how they would handle it.
---
Hopefully Endgame Collapse does something to end that.
---
\*Happy Oinking\*
---
@vorahk thank you for the tips. As you mentioned in your reply, most of the things depend on luck. This is ridiculous from my point of view. When I grab for the second time they mostly go dc on my shoulder, sometimes a survivor gets dc before the game starts most of the time.
---
I‚Äôve honestly never had a problem with NOED just cleanse dull totems and it can‚Äôt even spawn.
---
And you got a 4K on haddonfield map offering. Impressive
---
Just break the line of sight
---
Isn't the person we're talking about a streamer...?
---
I love how that was your only perk too and it came in clutch!
---
The funny thing is they posted first, yet this post got more likes than the original.
---
N-word pass from Joey
---
Haha epic impact font meme bro
---
I can't get behind this. They're called achievements for a reason. You've got to achieve something, not get something handed to you on a silver platter. Farming in my opinion destroys a game just as much as disconnecting if not more. I can run from a killer with 3 survivors but if there are some survivors working with the killer, the game is ruined. The previous post is what participation awards are made from.
---
You were the one who started talking about OP being shit at the game, and then tried to make yourself look good by saying you grinded all the levels. Now that you notice it was a shitty point to make you say I am pretending this game was competitive? Are you really grasping at straws already? What about maybe trying to make an actual point and elaborate why you think looping for five minutes is bad?
---
Big oof mate
---
Quitter bonus isn‚Äôt as good as getting several hooks though? Or is it similar? Only played killer a few times, so I don‚Äôt really know. Doesn‚Äôt disconnecting deny an emblem reaching iridescent?
---
Why are you hiding in a locker vs a Huntress lol
---
That was hot. üòçüòÇüòÇ‚ù§üòò
---
3 blink nurse can easily ''outplay'' your breakings of LoS.
---
You think not killing survivors is the worst case scenario? LOL wait for facing a toxic 4 man saboteur tbaggers swf
---
I mean the incest is like the other half of the appeal.
---
Not sure if this is satire or not
---
Yes. Read my first comment.
---
It‚Äôs exactly why I run noed, you want to be all cocky and tbag all game, wait til that last gen pops, I‚Äôll get you lmao
---
What the hell. This game is weird as fuck lmao
---
I don‚Äôt stand off at pallets. Nurses can‚Äôt change direction while blinking so use that to your advantage. Anybody who babysits pallets is a toxic player
---
What if I hit the survivors a bunch of times, damage gens, break pallets etc. but don‚Äôt manage to acc kill them? Will I pip down?
---
Well, Freddy's getting one already. If they do it right, I'd say Trapper needs some tweaking. He doesn't need a rework, but his base mechanics need to be changed/buffed to keep up with the current game. His power is clunky, slow, easily countered AND destroyed, something no other killer has to deal with.
---
This so much. People are like a deer in headlights against this build and try to hide harder and use lockers when that's just playing more into his game. If anything SM Myers reinforces the concept of playing aggressively which will get you further more consistently than trying to be immersive.
---
Are you trying to redo cells line from tfs?
---
It is the furthest thing from satire.
---
Good for the killer
---
Yes, as is, it **needs** to be a hex perk
---
Gross. Nurse doesn't need rework. There are a lot of other things they should focus on.
---
They got what they wanted with Legion, they have already turned their sights on Nurse. It won't end until the game dies.
---
&gt; Iridiescent heads gives you only 1 and 3 if you use a very rare infantry belt
---
Iri Heads are getting reworked anyway, so that point is a bit moot as well.
---
Who else excited for the premiere tonight ü§≠üò¨
---
I would say Leatherface is the worse but Freddy is pretty bad. Leatherface chainsaw is too easy to dodge and just screws him over more than it helps. Any smart survivor will just hug corners or objects
---
Bad for the sandbagger. They didn't survive. They got hooked and nobody would attempt a rescue.
---
I love these messages. Just the other day someone messaged me thanking me that I played killer cause they‚Äôve been looking for a match for a while.
---
Back then survivors had legit infinite loops. There were plenty of good and justified reasons.
---
If it converted 100% of your progress up to 50, and maybe also gave a boost to recovery speed, it'd be really good. Even comboing it with unbreakable wouldn't be too op, because it's then 2 perks with the same purpose, and it still caps at 50.
---
death is not an escape
---
Blood Warden activates
---
I have literally never DC'd. If I get downed for the 3rd time, I have to wait like 30 seconds until I'm sacrificed and on my way to another game. People who DC are the biggest crybabies on earth
---
It will be harder to gather as much points that way, but it is most certainly possible. Keeping good map pressure is a fun way to do that, so you may want to choose a killer you can be everywhere with in that case.
---
I think that buff just happened like a month ago with that last big update
---
What do you mean everywhere with?
---
the Houdini: Quick &amp; Quiet, lithe, dance with me, perk of your choice/selfcare.. Break line of sight for just a sec and have a quick vault ready, the proceed to hide nearby after your sprintburst from lithe has run out with the added bonus of watching the killer loop around for a few confused loops before they give up. It's very gimmicky, but it did save my life at the end on multiple occasions.
---
Looks better than normal meg tbh
---
There is almost always 1 disconnector when I play nurse =(
---
&gt;getting dumb
---
Lol. Been dumb.
---
*oink*
---
Is it weird that I‚Äôm jealous that you at least got to this screen? Usually I‚Äôm stuck playing lobby simulator.
---
Once one DC's I can't blame anyone else
---
1. Sandbagging is when another survivor blocks your movement by standing in your way and squatting so you can't go around. This is usually done on stairs, doorways, or small openings. You wont' be able to pass until they move. If the killer is chasing you and you run into a sandbagger, the sandbagger blocks your exit, and the Killer gets to down you for free pretty much. 
---
2. Reporting does absolutely nothing. Same goes for giving kudos.
---
I‚Äôm surprised a lot of Pigs tunnel, you want them to go to Jigsaw boxes to waste their time
---
Both sides complain, it‚Äôs not hard to understand, lol.
---
its sad when i read these posts, i really hate that shit the killers have to deal with. being bullied by salty survivors to enable the killer to actually fuck us over, but i don't blame you guys because i see this shit happen every day (yes i play daily)
---
it just happened actually meanwhile the killer was amazing and i endorsed him
---
lil miss didn't want to be punished for unhooking me infront of the killer so she called him "bad" what you on about sis?? that's an unsafe hook. meanwhile the killer rewarded me for doing safe unhooks and gens by letting me go
---
Ooooooh lol my bad. Text can be confusing at times xD
---
Get rid of broken keys and replace with firecrackers
---
Legion will get some changes next week. Developers will very probably solve the moon walking thing ( would be stupidly for them to add some changes to Legion without solving that strat ). Most of the players know this and they try to abuse moon walking Legion when it still exist. And I don't know from where you find all these Legions. It's rank reset, so now people play all killers, because all becomes viable now. Starting with purple ranks, you will start to see just Nurses, Spirits, Billies and maybe some Huntresses.
---
I would say this would be fine ONLY if they do like Overwatch and don't allow you to give kudos to people on your friends list. Because then you can abuse it big time.
---
Its fine lol.
---
This is probably an unpopular opinion, but occasional DC or suicide from frustration is understandable.
---
It is VERY easy to get tilted in this game, especially if everything possible goes wrong for you in the first minute of the match. 
---
I had this one game today where me and another guy in the lobby used bloody party streamers, only for our 4th guy to get kicked out. I spawned really close to the killer, and got downed afterwards. No one was coming to help, and my party streamer was wasted for me. So forgive me if I kill myself off frustration so I can go get a drink and calm down.
---
or the killers who use a mori but they're moring you after you've been hooked twice
---
I honestly see maybe one Legion every 10 games as a survivor, if even. They aren't an issue for me
---
Once I level him up I‚Äôll see if I can find something like iron maiden - thx again for the tips let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt completely bottle this üòÇ. Tbh honest tho it‚Äôs rank 20, probably a lot of missed skill checks and less confident loopers, but we‚Äôll see ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wanna give a reason instead of repeatedly saying this with no argument or suggestion? I‚Äôm all for discussions about the game, in fact I wish they happened more instead of the current state of the sub which is 95% memes. But discussions usually aren‚Äôt productive for the exact reason we‚Äôre seeing right here. ‚ÄúNUrSe iS bRoKE pLz FiX‚Äù. We need more than that chief.
---
Groovy.
---
I know this is a shitpost but he screamed because of Iron Maiden the perk alerts you when someone leaves a locker
---
I will give a serious answer as a killer main. I don't tunnel at the beginning. But once the game it's getting complicated, the number of players must decrease, that's when i down someone that's on his death hook instead of someone in a healthier position. It sucks, but i want to win as much as you want to escape.
---
Lol  Thanks brother!
---
Most items are meh anyways
---
Now i‚Äôm against all kinds of bs said to killers/survivors. It‚Äôs just a game some people are good some are not so good at it. Some people try to go for the easy way, some hard.
---
But sir if you use Franklin‚Äôs when i had white ward and my favorite loadout. I-i‚Äôll call you a meanie!
---
Oh I usually don't, hell I don't even really play this game anymore, just saying why I respect those people a whole lot less. Mainly for this reason, Survivor seems to be just antagonizing the killer while the other 3 play an objective, and Killer seems to be just getting around and being annoyed until you catch one, then sigh as three smurf claudettes roll out of the woods with flashlights, so you're left to either tunnel/face camp, or accept defeat.
---
Then again, it's been a long time since I last tried playing, and it's definitely more fun to just watch the game than actually play it, so if it's not the same, don't worry about responding to this about that, it doesn't matter to me either way.
---
Huntress got served
---
Except it would have went off on the first pick up and he wouldn't have made it to the hatch.
---
Only way to make survivors who can talk with each other during a match fair is to allow the killer to hear them too. I see using mics in an online dbd match as downright cheating. If the characters in the game are communicating the Killer would hear them just like in a horror film or RL. 
---
It's not like the survivors have an item like walkie talkies or headsets themselves. Even If they did the Killer would still be able to hear them unless they whisper. Then if you have communication items for survivors you would need some add-on or offerings for Killers to be able to disrupt communication between survivors. 
---
When I play survivor, I never use party chat or any means of communication. Not sure how anyone can justify using mics as fair play, unless they included the Killer in their party chat as well.
---
Although I love the nurse. Do you think a killer that you can always win with if you‚Äôre just good enough because the killer denies the game‚Äôs mechanics is perfect?
---
survivors can't bodyblock, bring flashlights, be too good at looping, do gens quickly, bring any perk that is actually good, or have any sort of coordination without being branded as toxic in the eyes of plenty of killers. There's BS made up rules for both sides.
---
Hmm so it's not because of shirtless myers? 
---
Eh, fine pizza dwight.
---
Asking me not to camp is like asking the NWA to stop being Black
---
Oh absolutely, just don't be fooled by the rank reset right now omce you rank up a few times. Have fun with it and happy hunting!
---
She was actually pretty good but I think she got to excited in the end
---
I might have camped 4 survivors, but nobody wants to admit they camped 4 survivors.
---
Lmao my Pig is P3 and I literally just fuck around 90% of games and let everyone go. You nailed it.
---
Dead hard can malfunction sometimes. Sprint burst is shit , since the exhaustion nerf.
---
Lithe is way too situational and sometimes I want to fast vault killer shack,but don't want to waste it. 
---
Head on...is way more situational  than balanced landing, takes 3 seconda to activate and doesnt even work most of the time.
---
What exhaustion perk did I miss? Can't remember all of them.
---
The players that DC need to switch playstyle.
---
I went from totems and gens, hiding and being stealthy while getting all the saves, to finding the killer first and looping them until they DC or my team gets 4 free gens.
---
All my past games were shit, because I would depend on my teammates to loop the killer for a while, but they all die before I get a gen or 2. Now, I'm the distraction, and they get free time to do stuff, while I have fun and learn better routing.
---
No it wouldn't have. OP hadn't been hooked yet.
---
First time I DCed on purpose was last night.
---
Two pigs.  Enough said.
---
You could always just disable the post game chat completely. Just click the &gt;&gt; arrow and it stays hidden.
---
IT ISN'T. Balanced Landing is the worst exhaustion perk, excluding Head On. Some maps you literally cannot use it, and if there is its usually only one or two places on the map. Sprint Burst is the best exhaustion perk due to its versatility in almost any situation. Dead Hard can extend chases by a large margin, Lithe gives you a speed boot AND there is an obstacle in the way of you and the killer.
---
Balanced Landing has a good chance to never even be used. Every other one has a 100% chance to be used (excluding Head On and Adrenaline of course). That is the main reason why it is bad
---
What buildings? Haddonfield houses? You don't need Balanced to run those
---
The killer is still there.... why would you want to get up.... especially BILLY
---
I have done this while running balanced landing he couldn‚Äôt find me anymore and ended op leaving the game
---
Read my comments down below, i have mostly responded with a constructive argument. Im not bitching about the nurse being broken, i am stating a fact. I have already suggested a mechanic similar to the Spirit where u could only see scratches while blinking. AmA and I will try to answer as well as i can.
---
Not ez logic since the killer CAN reach over the pallet.  That is, if this game was realistic they could. Their hitbox extends passed it but there's a barrier preventing them from hitting through it. If what you said was true then there would be no way a survivor in the middle of throwing the pallet animation could get hit as it doesn't extend past the pallet, but it happens. Even if the pallet is halfway down.
---
  It doesn't defend you but it SHOULD. Otherwise windows, especially drop windows, are completely unsafe.
---
I have played killer. And you don't know how many times I call bullshit in attacks that I land. I just swing through every pallet and window and I always get a trade off with pallets and hit with windows. Very rarely do I not. What's the poitntof having them if you judt get hit through them anyways?
---
Oh wow, what a crazy new glitch you just found. You should make a video on this hot take
---
And they do nothing wanted me to heal them like wtf ... do gens
---
Yes. Exactly. Just because it's new, doesn't mean it's bad. Remember Legion? Hmmmmmmmmmm?
---
Sprint burst can be used in any situation, to dodge a hit from a surprise attack especially
---
I was trying out Ash for the first time. I couldn't wait haha
---
Release the Billith!
---
A good Legion using all the tricks allows them to chase you at a close distance while you bleed from Deep Wounds - meaning no matter what you do as a Survivor, you're either going down because of the bleed out timer, or because they've made enough distance on you that you're forced to mend where they can catch you. 
---
Since Legion can vault pallets and obstacles as fast as you can, there's no way to escape the dwindling timer and dwindling distance - so it doesn't matter what you as a survivor do, you'll be downed regardless of your juking capability or psyllium game. 
---
Against other Killers, with enough time or skill you can lose them or occupy them long enough on account of your skill. With Legion, your survival has nothing to do with your own skill, just the lacking skill of the Legion.
---
You just know they were whining and kicking like a child when they start calling you out for things they brought on themselves, trying to make you the bad guy. Total superiority complex if you ask me.
---
Last time I played survivor with randoms I did 3 gens by myself, rescued someone twice and another once. Got caught finishing the last gen. They left me. Didn't even try. I lit them up in end game chat. All they said was "lol, that's wut u get for playing altruistic." FUCK DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!
---
just use both :wink:
---
Did you know where the hatch was or were you lucky?
---
He‚Äôs useless without Franks or exploiting chases in my opinion he gets gen rushed so hard.
---
This is amazing Ty for sharing. Love the exiting!
---
And being an inarticulate contrarian doesn't make you look any wiser than the "majority" you seem to think so ill of.
---
You're mad at them for fixing things that need to be fixed? Lmao.
---
On some maps you straight up can‚Äôt use it.
---
she is scary
---
Idk why Self Care gets so much hate. It‚Äôs really good with Mettle of Man (another amazing perk).
---
Plus, 2 survivors being out of the game for 16 seconds is the same as 1 survivor being out of the game for 32 seconds. 2 survivors healing with self care = the same amount of time as 2 survivors healing each other.
---
Didn‚Äôt get em all - one escaped - but I still pipped up, thx to ur advice I‚Äôm not raging that I missed one üëçüèªüôèüèª
---
When I play them, I usually open with Frenzy then see if I can get a down quickly with a basic attack. If not, then I Frenzy them down.
---
We'll just have to agree to disagree. Nurse rework shouldn't even be in the conversation.
---
Maybe at the very bottom of the list, after the next 7 years of DLCs are completed
---
You're welcome! Thanks for making the best contributions to this sub. I honestly look forward to seeing them whenever they pop up.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I don't care legion equalize dc ! do you get it?  let me repeat LEGION EQUALIIIIIISS DC. 
---
not you get that, stop being a cry baby because this shit show killer is not fun and balanced.

I love using a splinter and getting DCs because survivors think it's a mori.
---
The stun reduction really isn't even that great. Sure you can help make looping at those specific places easier, but they are already really easy to loop. Plus that's only IF you get those maps. Eveything other exhausting perk works on all maps
---
I personally count to three, with ‚Äú1‚Äù being when they start to pickup, and ‚Äú3‚Äù being when I blind. The killer‚Äôs head will wiggle a little and then face forward in the position they‚Äôll be for the rest of the animation; it‚Äôs at this point you blind.
---
I tried, with words.
---
Wish I got $100 to chill at the gate I'd start doing it lol.
---
*I am the liquor*
---
i can't explain this but midway the pickup should be good
---
You probably watch the toxic streamers who hate him. Stop jumping on the bandwagon loser.
---
One of the only streamers I can think of that doesn't bitch and moan
---
No problem, friend.
---
Me and you literally had the same idea making a video to translate the dudes victor incorrectly üòÇ
---
Thanks! really useful!
---
It was a pun
---
r/woooosh
---
Yup, happend to me few times, but only with Billy. Was funny to see him downing survivors with the chainsaw :)
---
No. But in this case, the Killer had at least 2 chances to down here and he choked. This isn't so much a case as "There was nothing the Killer could do" as it was the Survivor simply outplaying Myers. Props to him. 
---
So I don't agree with respecting the 4 percent, but I'm in the camp of salty Killers who think that in this clip, the game gave the Survivor all the power and a bunch of free escape tools.
---
more like dumb billy
---
Only my eyes are hurt because Combat Ready looks level-independent? (+25% on all tiers according to the description) +We'll Get Through This shouldn't be that good imo, it's like Adrenaline for everyone at any time
---
Question, why is it when a Legion abuses chase mechanics for his ability it's the ultimate sin, but a Pig doing the same with her traps is all fine and dandy?
---
rip crispy boi
---
Might I ask who you enjoy?
---
Trailer Park Boys format? This sub has finally peaked. 
---
Take your upvote
---
Rank system be like: eh here's a silver
---
You just need the stairs in the killershack to get the boost. Most maps got hills &amp; buildings to jump off.
---
I still dislike sprinburst. It's definetly way worse than Balanced. If you can play really good , you can also pull of nice dead hards.
---

---
Tbh Dead by Daylight is less violent than Call of Duty and a lot of other games. It‚Äôs brutal when it comes to hooks but actually hitting survivors isn‚Äôt that bad because you‚Äôre basically just tapping them, they don‚Äôt have the cuts shown or anything while Call of Duty shows people blown to bits and then so many decapitations in those games, I mean they literally chainsaw people in DBD but they don't actually get cut in half, just a lot of blood. Less Sex Drugs Language ect too.
---
The same might be said of the P3 Claudettes wielding flashlights. Granted, they‚Äôre toxic a solid 85% of the time, but yeah.
---
It‚Äôs simple way to say that you‚Äôre an idiot for saying balanced landing sucks and that you don‚Äôt represent the community.
---
Ok, I'll tell you how I usually play Legion. This method requires some skill to pull off consistently, but it's super rewarding and satisfying once you can do it. You use your Feral Frenzy to initiate chase, to find survivors and to stall the game but never to down people. While bringing Legion to max prestige max level, I've realized that it's usually, even if you get looped, faster to drop the frenzy and chase people normally. But to pull this off you need to learn when you can stop using Feral Frenzy and that's absurdly difficult without any cooldown reducing addons. General rule of thumb is that you don't need to chase someone as much as you need to position yourself either inbetween the survivor and a safe zone (like a pallet or a god-tier loop) or wrangle them in a dead zone for them. Even if Legion moves at 110% speed, his ability to jump pallets and windows at will make him still very good at running jungle gyms and various loops like cowsheds. There are some loops where he struggles A LOT with this method, most notably the Crotus Prenn Asylum or some Coldwind Loops, but then again he requires practice to be effective with this. Knowing this allows you to snowball with Legion: Nobody heals, and even if they do they get injured again immediately, and if you can get the next down fast enough, they got timers on them, timers on the hooked people and you are free to wreak havoc (which is one of the reasons why Legion is strong). Feral Frenzy can also be used to spot people, which is never a bad thing to know. You usually attack again someone Deep Wounded in Feral Frenzy when their timer is low enough to do that, but you usually never want to end up in that situation because it takes a lot of time to do so. Perks that I would suggest running with this are Monitor and Abuse (which is excellent on Legion, expands the Killer Instinct Aura Reading and gives you more time before you activate Feral Frenzy to start a chase (since they don't notice you as quickly), HEX: The Third Seal, which makes the game so hard for survivors, given the fact that now they don't even see each other half of the time, in addition to all the timers they have on them; HEX: Ruin or Corrupt Intervention (the latter is better by the way) they both stall the game hard enough that survivors have either to find the hex and destroy it or power through ruin plus everything else Legion puts on them, Corrupt is better because it forces survivors to group up, giving Killer Instinct that much more value; last perk is Barbeque and Chili, Rancor or Stridor. All of these perks help you track people, in different ways: Barbeque and Chili is the snowball perk, hook someone, find someone else, down them, rinse and repeat. Rancor is more passive, but it gives you time to check on all survivors on a generator pop, plus the instadown + mori at the end is always hilarious (to do, not to recive), Stridor is more sublte: Mending survivors are injured but they also stay still to mend, giving Bloodhound less utility than Stridor, also people prefer to hide against Legion more than run loops and this gives you quite the edge in finding them. Addons that are worth running are Frenzy Duration and Frenzy Cooldown, Frenzy Movement speed is nice but not that great and the pins are quite bad. Cold Dirt is Legion's best addon in a mile, Frank's Mixtape is really overrated considering it doesn't kill people faster than Cold Dirt, Fuming Mix-Tape is terrible for being an Ultra Rare and the Iridescent Pin fucks with your head a bit, but becomes top tier once you realize that breaking god-tier pallets as Legion is still important. Stab Wounds Study is okish, it makes survivor mend earlier which is not good, as you want them to waste as much time as possible: run to a safe space then mend, is more time than mend outright where you are, but then again it's still quite good. The Blades are good but bugged at the moment, and constinuous stabs increase exponentially the time to mend, don't use them together it's an exploit, please don't do it. And that's a very brief summary on Legion, I'm also making a guide I would love to publish, but first I've got to wait the Dev Update on them. Hope this Helped.
---
I upvoted for good mesure, people are stupid **and** unaware
---
Ok thanks :)
---
Again, both of those maps are super easy to run without it. They are infinites within themselves, so I'd take something like Dead hard over BL any day. Plus then my Dead Hard will also work outside of those. And if I had SB I could just sprint other them to start looping them. Same with Lithe
---
PSA: You disconnecting is infinitely more satisfying than 4,000 hooking bloodpoints. Also, I get a quitters bloodpoint bonus. Thanks.
---
Ah ok makes sense. I'm not a killer main but if it gets quick kills I figured it would be efficient. But what you said makes sense, that pesky 4th survivor. I'm usually the third left to rot
---
I am the liquor
---
Those are clearly two 1 dollar bills, I think the Trapper is running a scam here
---
Kills them instantly
---
Yes and it would've been fair because the new one acts as a second chance
---
If the killer allows you to run around for 5 MINUTES then they obviously don't know how to run those tiles themselves, because even with BL a survivor can loop me around those places for a minute are best.
---
You also just said that you hated how all the other exhaustion perks make the maps so safe. So you're admitting that the other EP's do a better job at keeping the survivor safe than BL? Doesn't that make the perk worse than the other ones?
---
Ask not what the liquor can do for you, but what you can do for the liquor. You need to let the liquor take complete control.
---
I love rank reset
---
Or you can outplay a Nurse. I know, it's a weird idea.
---
I just really belive that BL is the worst exhaustion perk, and I want others to realize that as well
---
Normally players are a lot more savvy of his traps when they‚Äôre not in a chase. I think Trapper is good at ending chases by having preset traps at key spots like pallets, windows, and especially the killer shack because chances are high that a survivor being chased doesn‚Äôt have time to worry about where they‚Äôre running to.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs my point. Disconnecting (or killing yourself on the hook) means the killer can‚Äôt get their maximum 3 hooks from you.
---
Very nice guide. I would add Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia along Ruin to stall the game more. 
---
Good survivors won't heal though, which works for us, you down them instantly with 1 basic attack.
---
Sorry I meant downvoted! Anyways, this community is very touchy so when something doesn‚Äôt go their way, they will constantly complain about it. For me, I don‚Äôt want to deal with any trouble and rather make the game fun for everyone unless they are SWF groups clicking flashlights at me everytime I get stunned.
---
If you don't like Tru3, fine. I agree that he can be sometimes too whiny, but every streamer can be, especially in such a competitive and toxic game. So please don't post this shit here.
---
Thats 1 map out of how many? 
---
Also i did not mean you should fall down the whole stairs. If the killer gets the time to block you from getting up the stairs, you were doing something wrong...
---
Dead hard is okayish. Most people, I see, are just using it into either a wall or into nothingness.
---
*deranked green ranks
---
I was expecting nothing but blue arrows and people telling me to fuck myself but I guess I got lucky.
---
Try to keep in mind that every loss comes with a lesson that you subconsciously learn. Eventually you'll be making amazing reads and killing like you breathe. &lt;3
---
I used to main Trap daddy. honestly using the sack add on and hex ruin was most effective. youd start with an extra trap, or two, and then having ruin gave you time to set them all up, while collecting all the others.
---
I'm not sure why he doesnt start with all of them like Pig starts with all her RBTs.
---
Bug, I got one that said something like "Be chased by the killer for a total of 2 seconds with Meg Thomas", but it counted minutes.
---
That's the solution. People will either let themselves die on hook, which won't take long since they're likely downed at this point. Or the Killer will screw off, giving an easy win to the Survivors who can BP farm. Most good games have punishments for disconnecting. 
---
Most team-based games, where one player leaving breaks the balance, will force you to wait 30 minutes after you quit before you can start another game. Subsequent quits will increase that time penalty. And I applaud the games for doing this. This isn't a joke. Don't be a crybaby, and stick out the match.
---
Pull the Trigger Piglet
---
Well it seems the the traps are scattered so that he can trap random places. Yeah people like trapping certain places but i do like leaving a random trap in a field from time to time.
---
The same thing I would‚Äôve done
---
This is the survivor mind‚Äìset defined.
---
Alrighty whatever you say. I wanted to keep this civilized and not just start name calling. You don't need to bring unnecessary hate when people are just trying to argue their point
---
He's the idiot? You told OP not to listen to u/Biggie_Cheese48, and then when he asked for your reasoning you refused to give any. Your making me doubt that you refused to tell him because "he's an idiot", and you just don't have a good reason as to why balanced landing is good.
---
So don‚Äôt use BL then. 
---
Makes my game easier.
---
Around the time the arm starts to move up. Previous one was when the body hit the shoulder and the one before that was when the legs crossed.
---
I'm still waiting for them to let him pre-place his traps before the game begins. Like, during the loading screen, give him a map of what the trial will look like- and let him click in areas to place his traps there. Then, once the game begins, every trap is set.
---
I sometimes wait at the gate to get some extra escaped blood points, never to annoy a killer. I just finished a game where I fixed 3 generators, saved someone from the hook, cleansed 3 totems, and still didn‚Äôt pip. If survivors weren‚Äôt so screwed with blood points, maybe this wouldn‚Äôt happen so much.
---
Someone said I was playing ‚Äúhardtarded‚Äù after everyone DC‚Äôd. She DC‚Äôd as I was taking her to the hatch lol
---
their head blows up
---
Stfu weeb üò∑
---
BL'ing of the stairs leads to literally nowhere . Dead Hard usually helps me extend the chase for over a minute, people who Dead Hard out in the open are doing something wrong
---
Well, with killers paying $100 to fuck off, I think survivors will be much better off with bloodpoints
---
Instadead, they get a warning though it will start going crazy near the gate. The power is like a personal built-in bloodwarden you cant leave until you play the jigsaw game.
---
Killers meaning of trolling is looping them.
---
Also killers: tunneling and camping the hook just straight up being a dickhead &gt; survivor t-bag's killer cause he's looping or was able to escape from the killer &gt; survivor asking in end-game chat why killer was tunneling/camping &gt; killer: DoNt T-bAg Or Bm aNd I wONt TunNeL oR CamP
---
Lol. There's a lot of salt in here. 
---
Oh yeahhhh people TOTALLY play with their friends in goal to make killers angry. Couldn't be just because people want to play with their friends.
---
Well no, like I said it's either useless, like on say Lerys where there is literally only one place to use it, and it's in a horrible place to use it, or game breaking like say on Haddonfield, Mount Ormond, or Mother's Dwelling. I can't speak for the Survivors you go against as Killer or the Killers I go against as Survivor but from personal experience, as a good Killer and I'd say half decent Survivor, it makes certain tiles ridiculous.
---
Jake is a fit asian male though
---
*^Shhhh,* *^don't* *^tell* *^the* *^others*
---
Agreed, fun meme at first but now it's like the chad of the group. Annoying, buff, and won't fuck off.
---
rank reset? this is every single game i play on dbd since a few months ago and i dont even see someone be toxic unless at the exit gate
---
Very much so
---
Oh yeah good point
---
If you weren't going to argue a point then why did you decide to message here?
---
pretty sure i‚Äôve been in a lobby with them too lmao
---
Controllers have low sensitivity compared to mice since mice have the ability to be precise and shift fast at the same time so it‚Äôs nearly impossible to achieve exactly that on controller. This is also coming from someone who plays max survivor sensitivity on console. I played DBD on PC when it had a free weekend and i noticed it was much easier to turn precisely.
---
I planned on it but you‚Äôre the dude who made a post a while ago about balanced landing, which got a ton of comments. 
---
If you wouldn‚Äôt listen then, you won‚Äôt listen now.
---
Honestly at this point i'm just wondering how many times this type of thing is going to be brought up. Feels like this sub is nothing but whining about killers and whining about survivors and then sometimes you get some memes about it.
---
I play some games as a killer and i sometimes get shitty survivors that are toxic.
---
I play some games as a survivor and i sometimes get a shitty killer that is very toxic.
---
And the rest of the time i have a nice and fun game that i either win or lose.
---
Just don‚Äôt go to them at the gate. Let them come to you and you might catch someone off guard
---
Whatever happened to those bans they were handing out to those that DC?
---
**‚Äùlol u suck‚Äù** and then immediately leaves the chat
---
Tell me, is being useless only having maybe 1-2 places to drop down?
---
Spirit has way better perks but is a bit harder to learn. She's also way better than Plague. If you already play Trapper you'll be better with Spirit. Plague is just another M1 killer if survivors don't cleanse, and for that you already have the Trapper. With Spirit you have so many options and playstyles.
---
This dude irritates me too. Not sure why though.
---
I shot all the way back to Rank 15 and yep, Leatherface grinding a chainsaw right in my hooked face.
---
I won‚Äôt be ranking any time soon but at least I‚Äôll be rich
---
Is there an advantage to using that offering?
---
Lithe is the real MVP
---
braindead legion main
---
He ain't bad just annoying as fuck and only strong if playing the way he is not intended to, which is using a "glitch" for chases
---
This is to change the OP's mind. Not my mind. This will only help HIM decide. So please, tell me why you think it's good
---
Yikes.
---
I just walk around the map and hope that the killer ends my suffering. Oddly enough, I'm usually the last alive. I think the killers think I'm absolutely shit at this game and take pity on me and carry me to the hatch. Like no, you don't understand. Kill the fuck out of me. End my suffering. This shit is literally unplayable. If I'm the last alive thanks for the hatch though.
---
You're late to the party my man
---
We do a little buttdance before going our ways
---
Not really. If anything, you are at a disadvantage because you do not get any addons or offerings when using the offering. It's mainly a try-before-you-buy kind of thing
---
Why did you bring race into this? It's unnecessary and makes you look racist.
---
Except you have no idea how many totems have been cleansed and how many are still on the map.
---
Lithe is fun &lt;3
---
Yeah, it always freaks me the fuck out
---
Nah. 
---
You don‚Äôt listen and I‚Äôm not wasting my time. 
---
If you don‚Äôt see the value of the perk, then you‚Äôre not good enough at the game. Don‚Äôt use it. Doesn‚Äôt bother me.
---
Man I'm like 30h in the game, when some one do 360 I'm just like wtf stop pls
---
I definitely support a way of keeping track of totems, I agree there. Personally I‚Äôd enjoy an audio cue upon the last cleanse.
---
Okay. Thanks for clarification. I‚Äôll admit, ballsy decision of u to get the second hit on u. Most survs don‚Äôt do that, especially for randoms. However ur bodyblock is a rarity. Most go like this. Body block, loop til Daylight, pallet, flashlight, teabag at exit. While this is valid surv tactic, think of a killer‚Äôs view. U finally get a down after god knows how many pallets, only for Claudette to squat under the hook, then maybe Nea. It gets old very quick and as a killer main, it does tilt
---
For me this bug fucks my game as a killer when I see it. It literally makes all players, including you invisible unless they're still.
---
This is his biggest weakness, 100%. Always take Trapper Bag my brother, because it will always be like this.
---
I love getting Pale Rose, and seeing the 3 traps I‚Äôll never collect from the start of the game :/
---
Always feel bad for the rest of them =(
---
Specially now since they removed the being in a chase requirement
---
Ohhhhh, ok, I did not understand that. Thank you!
---
Has he ever had any real controversy i'm unaware of or something? I've watched him a few times and he doesn't seem to contribute any toxicity at all. That makes him ok in my book.So what's the problem with him other than some pretty subjective things, like calling him a crybaby?
---
But I just don't understand. You messaged here wanting to argue that Balanced isn't bad, but then when someone tries to debate with you, you just call them an idiot that doesn't understand the game? What's your objective here?
---
Fine, I'll just use Adrenaline, dead hard, mettle of man, and deliverance instead of BL.
---
Skrrt skrrt
---
I don't unless I'm using dying light with a green mori. In that situation if you're the obsession then I'm sorry. It's the perk mechanic that kinda forces you to do it otherwise the perk becomes useless.
---
Go for it.
---
Woogie boogie
---
All 3 remaining survivors run at the hook...   
---
\-After game-
---
"Why did you stay at the hook" "Why did you camp"  
---
Oh, I guess I forgot I can just spawn in a new survivor to find on the map elsewhere....OOPS...
---
If you play Legion.. Yes
---
I just dc if it‚Äôs legion. No reason to play with people purposefully abusing a glitched character.
---
I mean you used franks and on a previous clip you used the bugged Add-Ons and both of those can transform legion to a near top tier because he has no counter. You‚Äôre the worst kind of person in this game community.
---
no matter what i do my luck is absolute shit and i‚Äôm always the first to get found, the first to get face camped, the first to get tunnel and the first to get moried... yet i still play this game
---
Just don't go to the exit gates....I always find it humorous..  
---
I went and made a sandwich one time and came back and someone was still in the gate, as long as you don't acknowledge them who is the real winner here? lol
---
Pig mains the only ones that remember it's a game. And its been rigged from the start.
---
It‚Äôs annoying that people do that in both sides.
---
None they are all overpowered, ask any killer main
---
Usually happens when you leave them down to bleed out. I think he hooked them all
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken‚Äù And this has to do with Freddy how...?
---
For real though, obviously there are some of you there, uh... wild enough to main Freddy despite the state he‚Äôs in. But it‚Äôs very widely agreed upon that he‚Äôs the weakest killer (or one of the weakest, at the very least), and that he‚Äôs not at all viable against good survivors. Your viewpoint is not that of the majority of DBD‚Äôs player base, and BHVR‚Äôs job is to keep as many people happy as possible with their game. That means Freddy as he is now has gotta go
---
Shouldn't be that hard to implement? I'm not quite sure you know how that works.
---
HAHA THIS HAPPENED TO ME WITH JANE
---
As someone who's been using it for a long while, it's not so much how many places you can use it, and more so where that place leads into. Haddonfield houses, Mother's Dwelling's main building, Mount Ormond's main building can all be severely abused with BL. Maps like Iron Works Of Misery, Gideon, and Coal Tower all have decent BL spots as they can be used fairly safely and lead into extremely long loops. Maps like Lerys, every single Autohaven map, and Family Residence are horrible not because they have few BL spots, but because there are no good loops you can get too with the stun reduction.
---
This was near the beginning of the game where the chase took less than a minute for him to complete, he just simply didn't like the fact I saved my teammate. I'm also one to usually risk my life to save another, because nothing feels worse than someone who let's you die without even taking an attempt to save, IDC if I die again, any attempt is better than none.
---
Hot take: Killers are allowed to play the game anyways they want just like the survivors.
---
I never use stuff like instablinds and ‚Äúcrutch perks‚Äù but I will sometimes teabag to distract the killer from my friends when I play SWF because my friends aren‚Äôt too great at the game and aren‚Äôt as invested as me. If I get caught, that is my fault and I won‚Äôt get mad at the killer for facecamping me. I‚Äôll accept my eventual death and (repeatedly) tell my friends to work on gens instead of trying to save me. Just say gg in the lobby and move on.
---
Balanced Landing is straight up broken on some maps (Coal Tower, Red Forest, Haddonfield etc) and is too fun to use.
---
Dead Hard is the best loopers exhaustion perk, but isn‚Äôt as fun to use, and isn‚Äôt 100% reliable.
---
holy shit that sounds like ur playing against survivor wraiths
---
Japanese or Latin America players?
---
It'd be fine as a hex perk if SWF didn't exist. Like a lot of perks, on both the killer and survivor side, it becomes useless when voice-chat is in play. Making it a normal perk would only punish solos and do nothing against SWF groups.
---
What do you mean? Couldn't you just have the textures onn the areas where they should be, then leave it there. though if it wouldn't work, might not be that hard getting them on cloths? Still point stands, no reason to prestige, atleast for the cloths.
---
I am always first found. I do my best to squirrel my way out, waste as much time as possible, make the killer's life hell. That's part of the game. I will never understand folk who DC.
---
Ok. So places with just hills are garbage for it, right?
---
that's two dollars.
---
Yes it needs to be a hex, but the Blindness effect could probably use a buff, perhaps lowering survivors' FOV so it's harder for them to look around
---
You stop playing them until rework. I like their design too but I‚Äôm not going to take advantage of a literally broken character that BHVR hasn‚Äôt addressed glitches for for four patches now.
---
How many days until we can get that $2 turned into $100
---
pigs usually tunnel the crap out of the person they put a trap on 
---
they reverse bear trap is like a target to them. ignore everyone but the guy who cant do anything until the bear trap is off his head
---
Yeah it seems as if the bug with survivors starting right next to the killer and in line of sight is back again. At least I'm not holding hands with the killer as the match starts like how it used to be but I think it's a bit broken that within the first 5 seconds the match starts I'm already in a chase. I've seen people start within my line of sight when I play on my pig and honestly I'll leave them alone because I hate when it happens to me.
---
You've probably gone against weak survivors because against experienced survivors freddys gonna be left in the dust
---
I've started running Blood Warden. Now they start shitting on the ground and dropping their flashlights every time.
---
Trapper ran out of money after paying all of the survivors to fuck off :(
---
MoM won't be nerft until years later. They needed something to sell for the people who don't care for ash.
---
So you think if someone keeps running into lagswitchers, frank's legion, are stuck in a hostage doc game (which done properly means that you won't even get hooked) or get massive lag that wasn't showing in the lobby, then they should get punished for disconnecting? Because that's what is going to happen, the punishement is not going to look on case by case situations, everyone gets screwed.
---
&gt;giving an easy win to the Survivors who can BP farm
---
You can't farm if the killer isn't doing anything, you can only get objective points and maybe boldness if they afk and not face a wall as they do it. Nobody gets good points, and the game is awful. It's boring af, I've seen a ton of people disconnecting from farming games.
---
You'll see a ton of people quit this game if you introduce dc punishment.
---
Racism is about exploiting power. I‚Äôm what world do white people not have the most power/privilege? It may be prejudiced, but let‚Äôs not throw around the word racist, because this is far from it.
---
legion scum. fuck off.
---
I think nea is wearing bubbas Claudette mask
---
I don't get it. Is he bad because his description is the same as the description for the Iridescent Head?
---
You've never gone against me though. The killers on console are so bad at the game that it makes it unfun. They play every killer like it's a legion/leather face cross breed. They're also the ones that come to online forums and try convincing people that pallets and loops are "toxic." They're just a bunch of petty ass bitches that have to ruin the fun for everyone else because they're bad at the game. They're the same ones that will go out of their way to stand on the hatch for 45 minutes then follow you to a nearby gen then report YOU for "holding the game hostage." Hit me or let me go or more preferable, go fuck all the way off into oblivion. The ones that play killer on PS4 are some of the worst.
---
welcome to "steal my meme"
---
But you don't hit always, thats the point. Actually, I don't believe that you always landed cross-pallet attack either. I'm calling bullshit here.
---
If rank had actual rewards, people would still disconnect. The people disconnecting don't care about rewards. They care about their egos.
---
Finally got me a GPU (GTX 1050 Ti, pairs up nicely with my 1368x768 monitor for 60fps gameplay), so now I can play without the game looking like an early PS2 game. Also, I‚Äôm this close to unlocking BBQ as teachable.
---
‚ÄúI was left... Nobody cared! *sobbing*‚Äù 
---
Oof, I felt that. But also I laughed.
---
Flip flop is a different way to play. Just because it is new, doesn't mean it is bad.
---
He‚Äôs actually quite the opposite (but still underpowered) and that‚Äôs the problem. Survivors have 2 ways to defend themselves and extend chases; pallets and windows. Legion ignores both of them which basically makes him have no counter. Once you are seen by a legion, your life is simply put on a timer unless they suck at playing killer or play the way the devs intended you to which makes him a bottom 2 killer in the game easily. It‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs going to matter for too much longer as the devs have said that they‚Äôll be giving us an update soon on the legion changes that will likely go live with the next mid-chapter patch which should be in June I believe.
---
I don't know why, but it made the post less funny.
---
True story
---
always provide content, by talking about stuff, anything, to keep people interested.
---
This is me. If I'm running mom I have to go heal or I'm wasting 2 perk slots. Regardless of the killer.
---
That is true. He is a paid, licensed character. When is the last time you have seen BBQ on the shrine?
---
I don't hit always, just 80% of the time? Wow, yup the game is definitely not broken because I don't land it some times. Lol, if you're seriously telling me you don't believe me then you've obviously never played killer. You can go play yourself and swing through the pallets and see that you're gonna get most of the hits.
---
If you get tilted easily, competitive games probably aren't for you to be honest. I dealt with a glitched mend Legion a few minutes ago. I moved on.
---
It‚Äôs an ok peek but once you heal yourself your screwed.
---
I am literally checking my phone right now in the middle of one of these loading screens hoping in vain it will resolve itself - and this post comes up lmao
---
Found the Jen lackey.
---
Can we apreciate that Billy had Iron grasp and two hooks occupied to stick it to slugging play? Lol
---
This. People are saying MoM is ok, but that's just seeing it in a vacuum. Once you combine it with other second chance perks, it's stupid strong and needs to be nerfed.
---
Yep. I been wanting to try out Billy for a while now and I've gone through so many levels and the same perk that got absorbed the last 10 levels keeps popping up
---
&gt;as three smurf claudettes roll out of the woods with flashlights, so you're left to either tunnel/face camp, or accept defeat.
---
Or you can get better at the game and play around flashlight (face a wall while picking up, bait the pickup and attack the person going for the flash save while slugging the previous guy for map pressure).
---
The guy who is running after you and trying to annoy you is not your target for most of the game, let him do his thing and hurt their team.
---
You don't have to tunnel or face camp, you just need to get better at the game. I know it sounds snobby as fuck, but that's the truth.
---
I'd still rather respond, but I understand if you don't feel like talking about the game too much. Have a good week!
---
This happened to me once. Had no idea what was going on.
---
Thank god I left before it started.
---
Thanks to all the people playing who try their best - you are the best teammates!
---
Edited my initial message
---
With your logic, killers can claim the same thing. In a perfect world, nobody would disconnect. But just like the people who claim that camping is a legit strategy, there will always be idiots making excuses for themselves.
---
Usually if I'm at the gate I'm making sure everyone else is going to escape
---
I‚Äôm HOWLING
---
When Bob Ross does his thing and slams a bunch of paint onto an already perfect picture:
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Right. Perks are meant to complement each other
---
B-b-but i saw scratch marks! /s
---
Just don‚Äôt watch the guy
---
There's a difference between lag switching hackers and "my fun". Disconnecting because someone is using a killer you don't like is childish and you should be punished for it.
---
Yes, but it only converts 50% of your progress, meaning you have to recover all the way to have a half full wiggle bar. I'm suggesting it converts all of your progress, still up to 50%, so that you only have to recover half to get half the wiggle bar. Basically, just means you don't need to spend as much time on the ground to get a benefit from it.
---
Get a load of this guy
---
Probably they aren‚Äôt sure they will be able to get any kills other than doing that
---
It‚Äôs not racist, it‚Äôs stereotypical.
---
PC. Survivor and Killer affected in the same match.
---
Took in  yellow medkit with the green charge addon and the yellow charge + speed addon.
---
Could not use medkit to heal myself or other survivors.
---
Killer could not hook anyone. Killer could not drop me when he picked me up. Teammate stunned killer with pallet and flashlight and we still couldn't get him to drop me.
---
Had to quit the game to resolve the match as otherwise there was no way for me to escape and no way for the killer to sacrifice me.
---
This one was impressive. Have a clip as well.
---
How is this done, exactly? Can you DM how?
---
Now use the Crusader‚Äòs Zealous Accusations. 
---
Maybe in a way of some Survivor ‚ÄûRules‚Äú but the killer is a p3 LF and it misses or is dodged
---
Didnt the devs say it wasn't RNG to begin with? Even though it seems to behave exactly like RNG?
---
The hit should NOT land before the stun üòÇüòÇ You're obviously a killer main who knows damn well you get survivors downed by BS pallet hits. Once a survivor is on the other side of the pallet and dropping it, there should be a barrier stopping a killer from getting the hit until the stun comes through. You can easily still get a hit before the pallet drop since vacuums are gone, you don't need to make pallets so unsafe that you get hit through them anyways. It's unfair to the survivors.
---
In a DC punishing system there is no difference between them. You are still getting punished all the same.
---
If someone is abusing exploits and in-game bugs (Legion) or strategies that aren't aimed at winning but at wasting as much of the survivors' time as possible (hostage doc) then yes, I think it is not silly and lets you avoid a ton of displeasure.
---
I mean people complain about nurse all the time, its just that she's known to be difficult and punishing to fail with, legion is a bit inefficient but can almost never lose a chase.
---
Or was a ritual
---
Basically speaking, yea. If all you have is a hill with just a massive dead zone then it's no better than sprint burst or lithe in the same situation.
---
2 of the most broken killers and you‚Äôre bitching about perks? It‚Äôs not the perks fault you‚Äôre bad at winning
---
can't believe people still play this game
---
Insta death? Is that like attempting to get off the hook 3 times so you die fast? I don't see that as breaking the rules, or even as immersion breaking. Self sacrifice so others have a chance of escaping is a common enough trope in horror movies, and in the lore the survivors are returning from the campfire again and again. So there is a chance they know about the hatch. 
---
Also, if they're returning again and again there is a chance they hate certain killers that terrify them so much they allow themselves to die just to end the experience and return to the campfire. I'd assume the entity would gobble down fear induced surrender just fine.
---
Juke the killer and get him to use his ability, once he cooldowns sabe hooked survivor, either way if they play that way they suck and you should be able to loose them.
---
I'm still getting them for killers I own. I just got my third Pig splinter today.
---
Clown stereotype happened to me today but it wasn't a P3, looped him around 2 mins and camped a while.
---
Whatever you do, don't listen to the shitheels who say Self Care is "worthless" in 2019. Especially if you're playing solo, self-sufficiency is king.
---
Besides that, some of my favorites are Bond, Kindred, Balanced Landing, Mettle of Man (occasionally), Adrenaline, Lithe, Empathy, Iron Will, and Urban Evasion, depending on situation. 
---
Truly, at the end of the day you can make any build work, but having some of those could and should give you the edge when it counts. Best of luck.
---
oh no
---
he's using what the game provides
---
burn him
---
Please. I can‚Äôt even get into a damn game! Xbox on low ranks is dead.
---
That would be absurdly strong. He could complete shut down parts of the map and it negates his biggest weakness. Only swf groups would be able to do anything cause solos just wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle not knowing that an entire half of the map is trapped to high hell.
---
The killers get ds nerfed but it‚Äôs never enough üòÇ, they always want more nerfed to make the game easier for them, what perks do you want survivors running? Apparently nothing you want the matches handed to you, clearly you hate a challenge you‚Äôre used to getting everything you wanted handed to you and in a game like this it won‚Äôt happen.
---
Ahaha this build gives me life
---
Better than some of others out there to only complain, montage their best plays rather than a full game, and bully killers or survivors.
---
i 360 for lunch i have 1000 hours my guy
---
It honestly feels so good to be the kind survivor and then have the killer be nice back. Some people tho, I don't get em.
---
You can save the new ds too
---
It sounds like you got outplayed. The number of times a Survivor messaged me with "Wow you hit me from 10m away" when I finally caught them window vaulting at the shack is outstanding. And no, they just got owned. I clearly downed them.
---
Time to start a fundraiser for Trappy Boi!
---
Just do gens
---
I see the point, just kinda diasapointed
---
How do you even do this glitch
---
Any recommendations on wich to get first?
---
I hope you're right
---
I hope they do that last year nightmare shit
---
ONE GATE IS OPEN, ESCAPE
---
50
---
40
---
OH NO KILLER GOT A GUY, +30 SECONDS
---
You downed them on your screen you clearly don‚Äôt understand how latency and ping works do you?
---
Hillbilly is just so unfun to fight. He can practically be in five places at once thanks to his mega zoomies and even if he sucks at doing that he can chase you at full speed. If BHVR made him today he'd be hag speed for sure.
---
To be honest, I might see SOME extra bloody clothes for survivors as a bought dlc clothing pack. maybe two to four outfits for each survivor that are bloodied for like five bucks.
---
Eh. The traps could still be disarmed, and Trapper's not particularly good as it is, now. Might be worth giving a try. It's not too much to ask that against Trapper, you watch your step.
---
&gt;let's not pretend like it isn't EQUALLY as shitty when the killer hits the remaining survivors while they're already on the hook
---
How is that comparable? There's no consequences to hitting someone on a hook.
---
Staying while everyone is safe and the gates are opened is a complete waste of time for everyone.
---
yeah and bbq is unreal on him
---
&gt; Now they are in every game what the hell
---
Low ranked killers getting pissed at being looped by more experienced survivors.
---
Rank reset is dumb.
---
Pig has transcended all of us and is actively fighting whatever keeps them binded
---
The games not fun if you don‚Äôt take chances, cat and mouse is cat and mouse for a reason.
---
I mean, the person was on the generator with me, saw the doctor, t bagged, stood still, then DCd. 
---
The other person got downed and instantly left.
---
The only one I can say id believe got booted was the last one because I took a hit for em and then they just, dipped, so I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd just DC, there‚Äôs no way they could‚Äôve been mad in the slightest so them I‚Äôm not too frustrated over
---
HE FUCKING HAD IT, HE HAD IT! WE COULD STILL HAVE HIM!
---

If I got Ruin that is what I would do, that and Haunting Ground. I don't have it so I can't, but you can be REAL mean with Ruin.

My expectations are a bit higher than that
---
are you really this fragile?
---
I'm a Claudette main mostly. I've noticed how so many Claudettes are So. Fucking. Toxic. I don't get it?? Like, with me, I hide away from the Killer, average 2 Gens a game at least, and heal as much as I can. I run Self-care, Empathy, Dark sense, and Urban Evasion. My whole kit it to avoid the Killer and do Gens. What do Toxic Claudettes get out of being a piece of shit? I just wanna get out and gain those Gucci Bloodpoints. Why they gotta be so shitty? Gives me a bad rep.
---
Reddit makes you wonder, man.

Actually, I am cocky. You're probably right.

---
Jesus whiny much?
---
Because he was made with the original three killers and I‚Äôm guessing the devs just wanted 115 ms to be the speed of all killers because trapper and wraith have that speed but later decided against all killers having 115
---
I wish give props would actually do something. If the survivor looped me good then I want to reward them. If the killer does well and gives me a fun game then let me give him something plz! Maybe 500 iridescent shards or bloodpoints idk.
---
Yeah wtf is up with everyone being wraith now ? Played about 6-7 games yesterday and every single one of them was a wraith
---
Easy counter is just to put the gate at 99% then wait for teammates lol
---
You have every advantage in the books you‚Äôre bitching because the survivors finally have an advantage over killers and you can‚Äôt stand it. How many dead hards can you use simultaneously? Oh right 1. You‚Äôre complaining about someone using a perk after they get unhooked? Are you kidding me? You and this post is a fucking joke. How can you complain about perks filling in the gaps? That‚Äôs the point of perks you imbecile, you clearly want survivors to run 0 perks and just hand themselves over to you. You can‚Äôt stand the fact that behavior put counters in place so good survivors can beat your sorry ass
---
Let me guess, bronze/silver on gate keeper + being forced to slug resulting in "Brutal Killer"?
---
"Competitive game"
---
You want to know how I know you're rank 15?
---
The last DLC that had a very good / necessary perk was david king with dead hard, also has We're gonna farm forever.
---
Mettle of Man is very good on it's own, but it's main use atm is snowballing m1 killers that arn't bugged with it.
---
Head On is probably the weakest exhaust perk close to sprint burst.
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks)
---
I literally have to message them to leave. I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
I do this, but as a bp exchange. The killer gets a free hit, I pick up some points on the way out too.
---
Hard disagree. SC takes ages without botany knowledge and that's 2 perks just to make one useful. I've taken off SC from pretty much all my builds and my games have been better using different perks.
---
&gt;You have every advantage in the books 
---
**LOL**
---
You can also run bond or aftercare if you don't want to use up two slots. I usually do that and it works...most of the time.
---
As a meg main farming my WGLF 
---
You're getting off that hook, Start running
---
I like your flair
---
I‚Äôm gonna call it overkill and leave it at that
---
I hope it‚Äôll get nerfed in 2.7.0, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it became the main selling point of the DLC and remained unchanged for a long time, like Decisive Strike.
---
was having a discussion about this while playing against a Billy with my partner the other day and i was doing totems - they asked if i thought it was likely he'd have NOED, and i told them YES.
---
he ended up having NOED, lol. not sure why the prevalence but it feels like i'm running into it on a lot of instadown killers lately.
---
TBH if the Killer wasn't a lazy greedy dumbass Level 1 Flip-Flop would've done nothing .-.
---
*laughs in d-strike*
---
Let me save you the time, I'll just go ahead and stab myself.
---
LUL
---
Because he gets looped. If Billy was 110 he would be able to start a chase quickly but he wouldnt be able to finish it
---
The reason is because he can still be looped. Hillbilly's power lets him run insanely fast, this is true, however his mobility comes at the cost of turning sensitivity. You can use the Chainsaw to zip from one side of the map to the other and if you catch a Survivor in the open, instadown them, however in loops his chainsaw is useless except for mind gaming pallets. He needs the 115% so he can loop properly.
---
I do daily so try again scrub let‚Äôs go round 2
---
"WHO IN THE FUCK IS DOWN VOTING?"- Donnie
---
When ur revving the chainsaw up his movement speed is faster
---
Don't try to deflect from the fact that you ran a perk that's already taken care of with another perk, making it useless and stupid.
---
*FUCK OFF WITH THE FUCKING DOWNVOTES!!!*
---
One million
---
At least half the killers in the game are not viable against a 4 man swf of good survivors. I can't remember the last time I died to a Freddy, Trapper, Leatherface, etc. 
---
Again, it's painfully obvious to me that you're a low rank player.
---
I don't tunnel anyone off the hook unless I'm using dying light. The obsession will never change because I'm not a baby killer and I play as fairly as I can. If I see the person that was just off the hook, I'll walk away. If I see them again though, to bad. DS is dead by then. I've always played like this because I'm not a huge piece of shit.
---
i peaked rank 4 good assumption
---
In another news, water wet.
---
Putting toxic people in a different queue pool is not a solution.  I'm not a fan of overwatch but jeff from overwatch made a great statement that would fit this dbd issue: ["if you are a bad person doing bad things, we don't want you here.  We don't want to make areas for those people we just don't want them here"](https://youtu.be/rnfzzz8pIBE?t=180)
---
Yeah I'm sorry but a cupboard haha 
---
:)
---
It‚Äôs when you start swinging your chainsaw, you‚Äôre as fast as normal, but you gain speed the longer you swing your chainsaw I think
---
I love sassy Dwight that needs to be his new stereotype
---
It was an important change for Tirion though, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt of crossed the narrow sea and follow the targerian girl
---
im confused,, why are u saying this. because sexist remarks are normal and happen all the time? thats the point tho, they havent in this game
---
no thats like saying spirit hag and legion have never downed anyone with m1. Theres a reason perks like enduring bamboozle and spirit fury exist, theres a reason mindgames exist. All u have to do vs spirit is walk towards your own scratchmarks or mix it up, does that mean she needs to be 115?
---
Is that it? Had someone who was apparently a streamer dc on me last night, i figured that would be the easiest way to lose viewers but if the people who enjoy watching people play this game especially enjoy watching people play easy matches then i just dont know.
---
*bouhouuuuuuuuuu*
---
Yes I did thanks :)
---
40 Year Old Virgin reference  :)
---
Anybody else getting a bug where the wiggle bar isnt letting u walk as a survivor
---
When I feel like 360‚Äôing on pc I always plug in my controller. It‚Äôs easier with a controller. Are you sure your sensitivity is ok and that you‚Äôre moving the stick in opposite directions?
---
If you‚Äôre there to give me a free hit, cool. If you‚Äôre going to leave the moment I get close then screw you. If I feel the killer was good I‚Äôll do the first one. No t bagging or clicking, just waiting to take the down and fall out.
---
Legit garbage makes it to rank 1. If you peaked at 4 you're proving my point.
---
That works too.
---
I can‚Äôt even get into a normal game as killer! What‚Äôs with the 30+ min wait? Is this across all platforms, because on Xbox it‚Äôs shit
---
Am I the only one who has a problem with Evan's ear? The inner ear is like a black hole for goodness sake.
---
For controller It‚Äôs hard to get right. I‚Äôd say make it a sensitivity where you can look all around you easily still, but in a way so you can move your camera slightly in prep for the 360, then quick while you‚Äôre doing the 360. Watch the PC 360 tutorials and just look at the speed they go at when they do it and try and get something like that coz that speed is perfect for console too. I have mine at max sense on DBD but I can 360 with keyboard and mouse too so it‚Äôs easier for me to figure out.
---
Hag, Spirit, and Legion can all use their powers in loops though, Hillbilly can't. In loops Hillbilly is just an M1 killer. In loops, Spirit, Hag, and Legion aren't forced to just M1, Hillbilly is.
---
1. I don‚Äôt see how your argument on the whole veteran and new players make any sense. In any video game- such as big sellers, you play with anyone. Regardless of rank. Now, if DS fixes it all, keep rank since people obviously care. I don‚Äôt think your point of new players and veterans is really your concern. I think you benefit self wise with rank. 
---
2. I‚Äôve been on this game since release. I‚Äôve seen downfall on this game. Whether it‚Äôs people quitting due to the incompetence of the devs, the rank, the wait, the bugs, the lies, etc, there has been downfall. You‚Äôre only looking at steam. Which isn‚Äôt the only place people play this game. 
---
3. You‚Äôre right. It wasn‚Äôt a multiplayer game, however you said they are a small company. So are a lot of people who product better games. BE is Canada‚Äôs largest video game developer. Like I said.. I love this game. Shockingly this game came into my life at a really dark time, and it helps with my anxiety. With that, I won‚Äôt say I have supported a lot of the choices in this game. Hence why I am still playing it. 
---
This can go on all day. Let‚Äôs agree to disagree. :)
---
I don't troll but I HAVE been face camped against baby killers for not rolling over and dying for them. I'm terrible at chases so I'm sorry if you can't catch me.
---
Dude, try 30+ minutes! I‚Äôm still waiting as I type this!!!
---
Charge 10k BP if you DC via the menu.
---
That literally will never work against a spirit with ears
---
A good number of others stick around as a vague form of insult, so some killers take it that way. You should play however you want to play, as long as you don't cheat. I would prefer all survivors leave as soon as they are physically able to, though.
---
Okay so after waiting until after rest, I am still having this problem... any idea why?
---
Don't post this here, you will offense the killers circle jerk. Only whining about survivors is allowed here.
---
ok lmfao once they pull the pallet early the loop is useless first of all, ds counters tunnelling and they can just slug u and ds is gone. Also youre making it seem like good killers simply dont exist. Like as soon as you queue in to a good swf its gg -1 pip you will never catch a single one and in 3 mins the exit is powered and all 4 escape. No swf is that good, not u or ur "god tier swf" that never loses to any killer ever
---
I don't disconnect because all it benefits is the killer. Sometimes I'm really tempted to disconnect but I know that the only people I will be hurting are those in the exact same situation as me. The only time I will disconnect is if the killer slugged me and the other survivor has a chance for the hatch.
---
They used clips from DBD around 5 times though I like how they stayed away from the licensed characters, because if they see Michael Myers in it they get the point of the game
---
It all comes down to personal preference honestly
---
It sucks in all forms of sound much like a black hole sucks in all form of matter. 
---
How else would he hear those immersed survivors rustling the grass?
---
Was asking personal preference of the community.
---
Yeah, I agree. If someone unhooks right in front of me, I'll go for the injured one. Also yeah, if they're dive bombing hooks, fine too.
---
But I'm talking about those butthurt killers who somehow perceive you as a 'toxic survivor' for daring to run away for longer than they want you to. Then they proceed to face camp you, nodding their head up and down furiously, until you die. Those are the kinds of killers who need a reality check. I see this happen all the time, and fellow survivors have done nothing except be good at looping.
---
Sure, camp the toxic little shits who teabag, flashlight click and point at every pallet. But simply trying to survive doesn't warrant it.
---
Facecamping, or just camping in general is a waste of the killer's time. But it is situational, as you mentioned if there's only 2 survivors left, or when you've noticed the team is very altruistic, like a survivor being unhooked mere moments after you leave the area. In those situations, take a look around nearby forms of cover.
---
A complete rework is fine by me, as long as they replace him with Robert Englund &amp; make his power [THIS PLEASE](https://horrorfreaknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1-Long-Arm-Freddy.jpg)
---
Go to u/jens56004 he has donne all the killers in the same style
---
I understand im not saying its impossible. Im just saying I was 100% sure I thought someone DCd and he had twitch in his name so I went to his stream to see why he was mad. And his stream showed him just getting booted mid chase as soon as the killer hit him once.

Hag, legion and spirit all have different ways to close the gap or mindgame at loops. Ending a chase with a 115 killer without using your power is very difficult. Not to mention 110 killers without their power cant even mindgame a simple double pallet that spawns on macmillan.
