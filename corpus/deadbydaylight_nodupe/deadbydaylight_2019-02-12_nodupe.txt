Did you hook someone first?
---

---
---
---
I play both around 50% at rank 1 and I hate from both sided for the same reason.
---
Long story short: if you’re good enough as survivor you don’t need it and it only encourages rat playing, poor participation and a giant waste of time.
---
Yup, tried on two seperate xbox's, signing in and out of both accounts. And it seems like my save was completely overwritten by hers. Only difference is I kept all my cosmetics and got none of hers but all my perks/items/addons for every character was replaced by what she has. My shard count didn't change but my blood point count changed to what hers was.
---
&gt; Because running the perk causes the person to guarantee save and protection attempts.
---
If you *need* the incentive of a WGLF token to unhook someone, you're a bad survivor.
---
And yet many people run WGLF *without* borrowed time (or even We'll make it) and "save" the survivor directly in front of the killer.
---
It has no gameplay benefits and its current inclusion causes negative behavior from survivors running it more often than it encourages helping your teammates.
---
Though a friend of mine did bring up a great point. WGLF is the only survivor perk in the game currently that lets you play as a killer.
---
I think the Predator would work quite well. The Alien is a little too animalistic for it to work, and it wouldn't make much sense in a regular horror setting.
---
the hatch closes??
---
I'm not seeing enough movement
---
I love Impractical Jokers so much, I hope the show keeps going forever. 
---
The thing is, I can't imagine what his power and perks would be, I could imagine a great map though tbh. But how on earth would The Predator work do you think?
---
Especially when they dont have ruin! I've had two Michaels do this and both had noed
---
Idk
---
Jake park
---
True and Tyde agree a little on starting survivor. Tyde recommends starting with Meg, Claudette, or David. Meg for Sprint Burst, Claudette for Self-Care, and David for We’re Gonna Live Forever. Meg and Claudette would be easier to learn on since their skills are pretty strong, but David’s WGLF helps reduce the bloodpoint grind a bit. 
---
Play tutorial u will find dwight in locker.
---
Totally agree, the Predator could potentially work, well the Wraith has invisibility already.
---
The Alien not at all.
---
Quentin is practically me in 10 years (minus the methhead look)
---
I had a game yesterday where spies felt like a crutch. It was kind of laggy so I had a hard time keeping chase, but spies would keep helping me get back on track. 
---
I love this for the simple fact it's one of the first three Total Drama seasons 
---
i think they should change it so if you hit decisive strike, your wiggle bar goes up by 50% and the killer is stunned but still able to walk, just like if he attacked a person
---
Yeah it happens from time to time. Had it happen to me got unhooked in the killer’s face and bam down. 
---
oh when ruin lasts for 5 secs
---
I found the toxic survivor
---
i am gay but no homo luv u too
---
Same... but still #nohomo
---
r/drumpfisfinished
---
This one wasn’t as good, the swf joke dragged and the spirit joke was bad. The beginning and end was good tho
---
I would rather have borrowed time if a teammate was getting camped, but if hes not, there is no reason for me to get aggro by the killer and getting hit for no reason just because I want to save someone off the hook
---
It would be great for an arcade mode
---
Do you mean his personality while hes interacting with marks doing the tricks? I actually think he’s really good with that, maybe not to the level of bullshitting on the fly like Murr can, but he gets people to believe the most ridiculous things! I mean, he kinda has to act low-key to get people to buy into the tricks
---
It's probably just so people don't get as high as red ranks, like maybe they dc once every few games just so they stay around the same rank 
---
For the lack of FOV give him killers vision, so survivors are highlighted like when you stalk with Myers, or with Freddy's dream world when they are asleep
---
But Shaggy’s power level is too high. He’d be OP.
---
Honestly I think they need to both be made obsolete, while self care wasnt made obsolete it's now better to find someone else than heal yourself. The same can be said for other perks for killers but honestly when the strongest killer perks are Hexes that can be taken away easily there needs to be a strong hard counter to decisive 
---
Ace looking at himself in the mirrors omg. I love it. 
---
Please tell me you meant to say "a fucking cute cat". Your wording sounds... worrying. 
---
Try an animal shelter. Many loveable ones there. You might want to look up the different races beforehand though. Would be a shame if you got a cat you can't handle because it's too energetic. It's a common issue with bengals for instance.
---
Like zoinks!: Upon entering a Chase, you run in place for 1/0.5/0.25 seconds, after this you gain a movement speed boost of 175% for 4 seconds. Exhaustion lasts for 80/70/60 seconds. 
---
Not sure if this is any good, wanted to make a perk that fits shaggy.
---
I always like seeing positive stories about other people. There is one thing I do nit like about this story though, and it was, "maybe he's a nice killer? Impossible, there are none." I just don't like seeing people generalized. 
---
I have seen a few of those. Agreed.
---
She THICCC

I actually get games playing as Nurse where the survivors tend to let me get some blink practice in. I know I’m not going to secure a kill. THEY know I’m not going to secure a kill. It seems to be one of the few things console players, both survivor and killer mains, can find even ground on. I’ve been playing Nurse more lately, even getting a decent number of 4K games. One time, I was up against a toxic SWF group on Red Forest (they used an offering, so I knew I was fighting on their turf, for better or for worse) that was just disrespecting the heck out of me because I was playing Nurse. They’d heal up right in front of me, and wasted time running me around instead of doing generators because they thought they had easy blood points, seeing as how we were in the red ranks. They ended up giving me enough time to get into the swing of things, and once I started downing them and getting a few hooks, they began to scramble around in a panic. I ended up getting a 4K, and after downing the last two survivors with the gate open, I furiously nodded my camera up and down to get a bit of petty revenge against the tea bagging and other abuse I endured throughout the game.
---
I quickly got added to a group, and I was expecting a very angry message. 
---
The message read “Yo gg, you did good with the Nurse”. It actually warmed my heart. 
---
TL;DR: A toxic SWF group on console bullied me as the Nurse, only to offer me praise when I ended up getting a 4K. 
---
With that said, I sincerely encourage people playing against console Nurses that clearly don’t know what they’re doing to at least let them get a few swings in. You’ll feel good that you did, and they’ll appreciate it. 
---
Zoinks!: once per match the survivor can enter a locker and emerge from a locker elsewhere on the map.
---
I promise to never dodge, if using the Trapper.
---
Jake. I just want to abandon society, live in the woods and be left the fuck alone
---
This was amazing!
---
Would need to remain invulnerable or make the killer run in place as well.
---
If you're as good as him you can play however you want. If you're not him, you need every edge you can get. 
---
I love this hahahahahahaha, would be so broken though lmao
---
&gt;It was a joke.....
---
For you, maybe. I've seen a lot of people actually saying this in a serious way. Probably these are the idiots upvoting your reply. 
---
Nah.
---
You can tell if it is a single or a SWF. A single will load in, followed by a few seconds, followed by another single. A SWF will load in all at the same time.
---
Creeper's ok but I'd rather have the guy in the glowing dive gear
---
Progress bars need to come to a complete halt during the dream transition. It's stupid that Freddy can sleep someone and they can just continue on stuff in his face, and all Freddy can do is stare at them. 
---
Oh, my sweet summer child
---
perhaps something like her kicking a gen causes it to burn, which when a survivor touches it it sears them, and gives then some sort of effect (like burned, which causes them to wince loudly in pain for maybe 20 seconds after touching the gen). and maybe her first perk (wheres my mommy) gives the survivor and "out of breath" status effect, which is an effect that give exhaustion, which is recoverable while running, and recovers at double rate while walking. Perhaps the let play perk could make survivors who are doing actions in her terror radius get revealed, or make her terror radius disappear when she start a chase (maybe make it a hex perk). Maybe change the I hear you perk to something called "neglected" which the longer the killer goes without a chase the faster they get, until the find a survivor, where the slowly get slower until normal speed, it insta resets if you hit someone.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what do you guys think of this?
---
Norville "Shaggy" Rogers having obtained power beyond that of a God met with the entity and after a thorough beating of the latter decided to further humiliate the entity by "playing it like lame game." Shaggy doesn't even require 1% of his true power as he knows with a surety he won't be needing it. The entity reluctant, but also fearing another beating was forced into submission by the Shag-man, immediately allowed Rogers to dominate it again and again, lest it feared its erasure in entirety. 
---
I had someone use a decisive when I was literally 10 steps away from a hook. It took me 2-3 minutes to just catch them. Totally ridiculous.
---
That's under the assumption that you're working together. DBD isn't a team game, your main objective is to survive. You can choose to cooperate or create your own objectives, a surviving is your only objective.
---
That being said, Sprint Burst is the best exhaustion perk to that end. Your negatives are in regards to cooperation with the intent of everyone surviving. 
---
I know that those people exist, I just hadn't faced them until this now. Just before this game I played against a Doctor in what was pretty much a 2 vs 1 (one DC and one super early kill) and still we managed to survive for a fair amount of time.
---
I felt that I totally deserved that win, but the killer hooked us anyway. This Trapper was really my first encounter with a nice killer. 
---
Thank you for this. I love total drama island as a kid
---
Hurts? How? Just play one more game... You seemingly have no gripes with playing. 
---
This is awesome! Great job!
---
I actually use thrill exclusively on nurse and billy just for points, also the satisfaction of killing the occasional idiot who wants to die over 1000 bold points that just keeps going back to the totem without doing anything else.
---
And you really think anyone's going to listen to a dumbass brat who just goes around being a little bitch and telling people to shutup?
---
iconic
---
To your comment.
---
&gt; and all 16 run DS
---
The names of those 16 players? Albert Einstein 
---
Almost looks like a Dwight tattoo you have there.
---
“Killing myself would be a bigger challenge than killing you guys was apparently”
---
 Nea wild go straight to hell 
---
Not possible. Pretty sure.
---
The names- Tiny Tim 1-16 
---
That was hilarious. Props on the editing and glad you met a friend!
---
Removed. You **must** credit fan art to the original artist.
---
&gt; Nah. 
---
&gt; Nah to what? 
---
&gt;Nah
---
GG outplayed
---
Ok, cate to elaborate?
---
GG baby commenter
---
I found it funny.
---
Everyone gangsta until the nurse starts moving faster
---
Me and 3 other red rank survivors went up against a Billy playing their very first killer game the other day. Felt so bad for them! Told them "it gets better" as if they were a LGBTQ teen needing confidence to come out lol. Just didn't want them to never play killer again.
---
Me too. I think the grind was far too tedious to get the Feng and Ace Cosmetics
---
This was hilarious! 
---
Im a level 7 and its only me and 1 other person (level 5) its still ridiculous that i have to limit myself to abunch of trash randoms 
---
I think you're missing a few dozen perks lol
---
I’d second this, I love Myers and Pig. Myers is so fun to play against and pig fun to play as
---
It’s a great perk for the overall goal of the game (grinding), terrible for actually playing the damn thing. 
---
What's the point of posting every perk when you can only use 4? The list has 12 perks which is more than enough. There are few that would be good on individual killers like Hag and Make Your Choice, Doctor in Game Map, etc. but I think these are the best choices.
---
Lot of perks missing lol
---
I run wglf, we'll make it, and botany. Makes my loadout basically useless for myself but I get them BP that I desperately need as a relevatively new player with being the least potentially scummy of a BP farmer.
---
A nice buff for wglf could be like either faster unhooks or even a small boost in healing temporarily. Like we'll make it but not as strong. 
---
I love the enduring/spirit fury combo. Scares the shit out of me whenever it happens
---
I would but every time i play i get like no points idk why ill get 3 kills then the last will get hatch
---
Dead meme bud.
---
If I'm understanding you correctly it's called a portrait painting. They're really hard to get right because even a small mistake will look obvious. Our brains know faces really well.
---
It is really fun though, especially when you get a little better at it.
---
Needs more Franks
---
Hahah I get how you felt I wanted to do the same thing
---
When I’m the last survivor and I’m caught by the killer and it’s obvious that there is no way I will win any chase or be able to do 2 gens to get a hatch I stand there and let the killer decide what to: hit me and take me to the hook or whatever it is. Sometimes they hit the gen to let me finish it, or hit them with pallets or find the totem, or they slug me and kill me. One game a Mike let me finish a gen to get to 3. But he didn’t want me to find the hatch, he kept hitting a gen and I would let him damage it. Right before I finished it though he came to grab me but I had stopped doing it and he stabbed me instead. He took me to a hook and I died. I still enjoyed that he let me do another gen! But then I actually felt bad because he wasted his Judith’s journal (I think he must have killed the first person and then the other 2 dc’d). He could have easily killed me unless he couldn’t get to tier 3 with just me. 
---
I go by the best unwritten rules of this game:
---
1 - Play how you want to play and enjoy the game.
---
2 - Respect is akin to Newtons 3rd law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Ergo, if you show no respect, don't expect any.
---
3 - The Killers role is to kill, the Survivors is to survive... **Both by any means necessary**. Hate the game, not the player.
---
4 - When the gates are powered... **Anything goes**.
---
5 - You paid money for a multiplayer experience, and thus aren't entitled to win every match. Anyone who takes umbrage to this should stick to single-player games where-in you are entitled to win for the money you paid. Being salty because of a lost match is unbecoming, embarrassingly juvenile, and toxic to the communities reputation. We're all people pitting our skills, strategies, and knowledge against each-other. If you lose and have nothing good to say: Leave a "gg," calm down/lick your wounds, and move onto the next match.
---
6 - (For PC players anyways) Post game chat can be closed using the "&gt;&gt;" in the lower right of the chat box, and will remain closed until you either open it again or restart the game. No one deserves abuse, so if you find yourself frustrated over excessive endgame chat toxicity: Just close it, and continue enjoying the game in peace.
---
My advice is to adopt these rules yourself, but if you still want to be a generous killer and ignore rule 3, follow rule 6 as no matter how nice you are to the survivors, they'll still shit all over you in post game chat. It's amazing how ungrateful or toxic survivors can be when you're just trying to have fun and give them a fun experience. 
---
What's the point of killer tier lists and shit if you can just play nurse? Dont call it a tier list if you're just going to only list perks that you think are the best lol
---
its also illegal how rare these appear on my bloodwebs. leveled trapper up to lvl 40 because i got the "kill someone with your hands" quest for him. well. didnt event get the shitty mori.
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring isn't just M1 chases. In fact its even stronger for insta down killers since they get a down out of that Spirit Fury use and not just a hit.
---
If you buy 1 of the 3 items in the set you pay full price for that item. You can't get the 10%off if you but the other 2 afterwards. 
---
If you buy all 3 at once you save 10%.
---
Nothing is on sale except full cosmetic sets.
---
It's not really a sale, because it's always that way.
---
The reason why I compare them a little is because both reward the player for fucking up that’s pretty much all I compare with both. 
---
It doesn’t work sometimes, it’s true. Most of the time it will though. 
---
Follow these, enjoy the game, and use rule 6 if feeling abused in post game chat to relive the frustration while learning how to play killer. Players never show any leniency when using all of the games available mechanics for their advantage, and you shouldn't ever feel shitty for taking advantage of them when playing either side, or feel frustrated when they are used against you (Rule 3). To me, survivor is easy and relaxed play for most of the time, but killer is always a challenge which is something I crave. You get hate from both sides in either role no matter how good or bad you play, but you don't deserve abuse while you are learning to play and trying to have fun. Nurse is currently the killer that has the highest learning curve, but also the highest rewards for putting in the effort to master. It really made me feel accomplished when I earned that skill level, and you shouldn't have to take abuse and discouragement from anyone while you are getting there. 
---
Have a good time buddy, take advantage of the games mechanics in any way you want, play how you want to play, and don't let anyone discourage you.
---
I play nurse on console, it’s not too bad tbh. Of course, PC is definitely better for every killer and survivor. 
---
Apart from all the other things that got pointed out, BBQ Should be A tier not B tier due to how important the auras are for momentum
---
I have found my new fetish
---
I didn't mention noed at all in my comment... literally not once. Im talking about camping
---
Yeah it’s happening to me, they don’t show up on my HUD either. (PS4) Idk if that means I’m not getting the event points though. I have all the coins now so I don’t check.
---
What a stupid fuck lol.
---
I think whispers can be a huge hindrance sometimes. If you know someone is there but they're hiding really well it can waste a ton of time. I love toying with killers that use whispers because I have Iron Will. Urban can counter it well also.
---
Also if you know someone is there but you dont bother looking for them, why even use whispers.
---
This sounds all kinds of fucked up. Normally they respond within an hour if it’s in normal business hours.
---
I think BBQ is still A for high movement killers like Nurse, Billy, Spirit Grab etc. but for a killer like Bubba it still give information but the auras are the only item that's reliable now since it can be outplayed by lockers. If Bubba, makes the wrong assumption that the survivors are within 40m's due to no auras it can cost a lot of wasted time.
---
What happened to nerf it? 
---
Yeah, with addons it's possible to do that.
---
Discordance has entered the chat.
---
But yeah I get what you mean. It’s really that that fun when you realize the formula.
---
Gen rush and loops. 
---
When the other 3 are gen rushing, you’re trying to catch a guy running through a jungle gym.
---
It’s nobody’s fault. That’s just the state of the game.
---
Dear god
---
Oh I didn’t make it just pointed you towards it. 
---
Global. But you can adjust as you see fit. I play at max sensitivity and that’s probably why I’m disoriented every time I hit a survivor as legion.
---
Lol well thanks for letting me know then
---
Also that vigil doesn't make sense. Granted it doesn't now. 
---
That's my thing neither belong in the game, there's tons of stuff to get the exposed effect from before ever hitting end game (devour hope comes to mind first) which in the case of clown is hitting someone with a bottle directly and takes a bit of timing and practice 
---
Ace doing the finger gun like “You do you, son” is so good
---
But is it better than Discordance? The early pressure it provides and awareness of high impact generators has always been stronger for me even though I often use BBQ when I'm not feeling sweaty since I want the BP.
---
Ah, no worries, Carry on my wayward son
---
There seems to be something wrong with grabbing in general at the moment.
---
Do you have a set of abilities that other killers aren't playing with? I'd love to hear how you find a survivor who isn't working on gens, isn't running, and isn't idle without Whispers.
---
Wtf was the poultry doing there? Cold wind Farm match?
---
Nea ends up in Hell and Claudette, well we don’t know. Nobody saw her leave.
---
What does she do in chases? Teleport to her traps and miss?
---
Only took about 70 hours... haha kill me
---
Sorry it just doesnt look like a joke 
---
Then I guess to fix that a game chat should be implemented right? That way friends don’t have to use a third party comm. but then that would allow random people to communicate with one another and once again the problems of a killer intensify. 
---
Thanks for the reply, hopefully I'll hear back tomorrow, will post an update for any that may care and also be affected by this situation in the future.
---
Captain cutlers ghost
---
&gt; Remove We'll Make It. Put maybe, half to a third of the effect onto WGLF. 20/25/33% heal speed after unhook for 60 seconds. Done.
---
Imagine sacrificing a great perk just to make an awful perk mediocre.
---
Matchmaking works by searching for a Killer who’s ranking is close to your own (or the mean of your group’s). It also takes into account your ELO which … without going into too much detail, it tries to match players that win more together (and players that lose more together). If it doesn’t find a match, every few minutes it expands the search parameters. Players who have been waiting longer have a higher priority. Eventually, you’ll reach a point where it just throws you into the first available match no matter how unbalanced it is. 
---
Nah man, Mr X fits better
---
I've had the same problem, but restarting the app seems to work
---
I think the swf joke in its entirety was funny. A lot of people act like every swf plays just like that.
---
Colorblind here too. 
---
I don’t even bother with trying to see hex.
---
I’m basically a permanent Freddy main cause the outline on this game lol... I can only imagine how you feel too
---
Facecamping sucks.
---
imagine thinking that and believing you’re in the right lmfao
---
If only people weren't assholes. rip
---
Do you mean game developer?
---
Prolly the type of guy to shit on a killer if he doesn’t leave you the hatch but does the same thing if he gets the hatch and calls him trash
---
How could the heartless freaks massacre Franklin 
---
I appreciate the explanation. I guess every system has its flaws. Generally, I find the matchmaking fair, but yeah, every once in a while... oy. Not fun. 
---
nope, it said game director 
---
Ok. I've never heard of a game director,
---
quickly pull the plug on your router and plug it back in. Whoever is in the game when you do will lose all their points but you will not, because it is technically them leaving the game.
---
If your team is decent, he lost at least 3 gens for that so its a good thing. 
---
I think the real crime is seeing someone slow walk or crouch up to you while you’re on the hook.
---
This. I once, quite literally, took down an entire 3-man SWF French team because they DESPERATELY tried to cleanse the totem I had.
---
Just TOTH.
---
On the Doctor.
---
With both Calm add-ons.
---
And Distressing.
---
The snowball was actually an avalanche. Moral of the story is, cleanse Haunted Grounds for me bby plz and thank you.
---
It's only good if you have A.) Ivory Mori, or an Ebony, but really an Ivory, or B.) Tombstone Piece on, get this, Myers.
---
Personally, yeah, I would definitely argue that it is stronger than discordance. Discordance is a good perk don’t get me wrong but BBQ gives you awesome information when you need it the most in order to know what gens to pressure, who’s an easy target, who’s still self caring in the corner of the map, who’s near a good loop and who’s in a dead zone, etc.
---
Discordance is a great perk but I just feel like it’s outclassed in usefulness by BBQ
---
Best feeling ever.
---
Are those Nea mains on your arm?
---
Same!
---
I had 2K, one guy escaped and the other one was at the gate waiting (not tbagging), so I place a trap,and it took 15 mins,yes 15 mins until he decided to step in it.He was disarming then while I was standing far,but I kept coming and replacing it until he finally got the message
---
Wholesome daily ritual story
---
If you don't get hooks as killer you aren't gonna slow down gens anyway. As long as you sprint to the nearest gen being worked on you can absolutely pummel gen progression. I always get use out of it too, especially when the survivors CAN'T. LET. THE GEN. GO. and have to finish it before moving on. I've had times where a team was trying to do one gen, but i kept getting hooks and bopping it, and by the end they still didn't get that one.
---
I think it is honestly better then ruin most of the time, it's waaaaay less dependent on RNG.
---
Lol chill your brain you salty idiotic kiddo I was joking
---
Oh wait a Trapper..right lol..didn’t mean to touch your noed
---
HAHA LOL CALL AN AMBULANCE AND HOPE YOU MAKE IT 😂😂😂 YOU’RE GONNA BE FINE SIR

NOED is too high. You are missing Save the Best for Last, Blood Warden, Haunting Grounds, Bloodhound, Stridor, Lightborn and Spies.

Doctor is the only Killer with a built in detector. Aside from that, Whispers is the only other perk that really makes a difference. Add-on wise, Wraith has one for seeing auras while cloaked, Myers with his mirrors and *sometimes* he can stalk through objects, but aside from that Whispers is what you need.

You can't die if you don't play
---
Man ever since I made this design it's taken left and right.. Any ideas on how to stop that?
---
Are you saying wraith and doctor are op? Lol
---
I don’t want to sound like a edgy killer main but at rank 15-10 survivors are toxic in fact most people are and it sucks that we gotta deal with it
---
Hey Thanks!
---
haha thanks!
---
It's not very effective since it doesn't stop the gens from being repaired in the first place and can be rendered useless if you can't get anyone with it active, assuming it is active shortly after activating it. **Assuming** you can get all 4 survivors with it before anyone breaks it or leaves.
---
Can we not get political here?
---
I don't even use NOED, I'm just tired of hearing about it.
---
And if you call that a joke you need to work on your comedic timing, friend.
---
That scared the hell out of me 
---
If you run insidious on Wraith you’re a disgrace
---
The wraith yes just bc of his speed boost. Doctors mid game is annoying bc insanity hurts you for skill checks. Both are probably the easiest killers to use. And thats without perks. Mike is a close 3rd imo
---
I'm commenting a lot but you seem to be confused. How is Freddy a good killer aside from "But muh tracking".
---
Never stop posting here OP 
---
Ive said it before and ill say it again. If a match goes longer than 10 mins without a chase, then the killer automatically gets whispers.
---
I watch my hits go straight through people. 
---
Credit to samination for the legion art
---
This editing is amazing 😂
---
This is the best thing ever, thank you for your work
---
Is it just me or when the Doctor comes into frame does it look like he's riding a tiny tricycle through Lery's? That's my new headcanon.
---
Oh I never said they were good I said the BM the most
---
Ps I’ve been at rank 1 because it’s hard not to be there 
---
send help
---
Ignore the survivors in chat. No matter what you do they'll bitch and moan. Just laugh them off and refuse to engage in their chattering.  
---
Now saying Hag and Spirit require no skill is funny. Those two are all about mind games and predicting survivor movements. In the low ranks where everyone runs over Hag's traps, and where nobody pays attention to Spirit's phasing noise I could see how you find those two easy. But once you rank up survivors become more intelligent and won't go down so easily. 
---
Billy and Legion are the EZ killers. Billy with instant chainsaw add-ons is a joke. 
---
Do you do funny dbd content on your YouTube?  If so can I get a link? I'll defs watch
---
The other day i played against a trapper and i cleaned 5 dull totems, once the gates powered he walked right up on my back and nodding whioe chasing me then m1, i took the hit and ran out, turns out he had noed lol.
---
He. Was. FURIOUS.
---
Hah, that's perfect. I didn't think of it like that. Any chance to put in some f i n g e r g u n s in my memes. C:
---
Jake there was obviously signalling David to swap his carried item to a skeleton key at last second. 
---
Pictures of those tattoos? They look damn good 
---
Maybe that'll be one of the upcoming templates I do...
---
I only wish the ending ended at the opening screen with the campfire haha 
---
I find the later in the day it’s gets the longer the queue times are. It may be just me though. 
---
When the creepy guy in a bar is trying to get past a girl
---
That would makes sense but with the inconsistencies of DVD’s lore anything passes.
---
Something should probably done, so fucking lame 2, maybe 3 killers are usable while the rest get shat on because they simply cant prevent gens from being done. You cannot be everywhere at once, chasing someone? 3 on gens. Downed someone? Someone tries to help, 2 on gens. Move and watch the get unhooked or stay and watch gens get done. 
---
When Ruin has to be a absolutely mandatory perk, gens need a serious rework. Make survivors find parts for the gens or something, noth sucks worse than starting the game, looking for people and watching 2 gens pop after 1 minute 
---
No but to make others suffer 
---
It’s fine for me both killer and survivor, I’m rank 1 both so maybe that’s it
---
I was considering getting a ps4 pro because I thought there would be no frame drops. Guess I need to sit on that a little more. Thanks for the tip.
---
Could have been SWF
---
For survivor i think alert is probably the most meta perk, really helps with outplays
---
For killer i love me some 3rd seal
---
Mmm... Idk. I feel like breaking out of a killers grasp once doesn't compare to getting tunneled/facecamped. Both have their counterplays yes, but idk I gotta say dl is the more annoying of the two.
---
When I was new and complete trash at the game. Yes, I'd facecamp the dude tea bagging me and let everyone else walk. Not anymore. I dont like to camp or tunnel, I feel bad breaking gens near by a hooked survivor, but hey, its gotta be done. 
---
Yeah come to think of it they did DC at the same time 
---
Console pleb. Big mistake. 
---
I found the person who only plays Survivor
---
No better feeling then when devour hope has 5 tokens , they down someone and the second they do, you break devour hope . I'm sure the survivor pissed themselves and the killer is now crying in a corner.  
---
Fair enough
---
Honestly, this is what I was wondering as well.
---
Not only is it 2 people for half the time vs 1 person for the whole time (and thus the same speed), but there is the extra time to find that second person to help, and then after they've found each other they'll usually head to the same gen, incurring a -10% repair penalty each as well. 
---
The main downsides for the Self Care side I see are that you use a perk slot, and it means it takes longer to be 'safe' again. Now, if we're talking versus Pharmacy, the perk slot is no longer in the equation... but Pharmacy also requires you to find+loot a chest, which is also time. 
---
So wholesome. I love it.
---
Also cause Dwight is a nerd and nerds go in lockers.
---
Huntress is close behind in terms on dificulty on the console for me. But there's one trick I use which consistently works with her. Baiting a pallet and then hitting them with a hatchet. You have time to aim when they drop it. With Nurse, after a bad blink and wiff attack always lose them because the turn speed is so slow.
---
Dude you can’t just repost someone else content, even if you say who’s it is it’s still reposting, like the modern reaction channel.
---
Disconnecting on the pig during her year? Shameful.
---
That hatch location is always either clutch or die for me
---
its one time and doesnt end the game early
---
When I play killer unless I REALLY need the points I’ll just waddle around looking for the survivor, I count it as a win if a survivor gets hatch
---
I like Save the Best for Last as well. Being able to stay on survivors' tails, even after a successful hit, is huge.
---
When is it my turn to post this?
---
Dying Light doesn't end the game early either
---
Because depip is more valuable 
---
Triggerable aura reading within 40 meters? Maybe it last 5 seconds and has a 30 second cooldown? It’d be hella cool but he’d need to be 115 speed or else he’d fall with the other killers that have good tracking but no chase game.
---
it kinda does it requires you to tunnel someone
---
agreed!!! really loved that game, it’s the best i’ve had in a while, i’m sure the other players realized they messed up real bad with the comments lol
---
Im dying over here 😂
---
Anytime I'm playing killer and the survivors get two or more disconnects I try to be nice but they never understand. They run and don't pay attention to the fact I'm not even trying to hurt them. 
---
Today, I had a Dwight and Meg get screwed over by DCs so I tried to get in front of them, then walk to the vessels to show them where they were and they could take them. The Dwight just blinded me with his flashlight. That pissed me off so I killed them. 
---
Legit where can I buy this 
---
For diversity? :) Also maybe you'd probably be more ok with losing to someone who's skilled then someone using cheap tricks. I know I would.
---
I like this. I like this a lot.
---
When you see feng in that event dress.. you know it’s game time. 
---
Thank you. Exactly what I was thinking. Hell I never run ds fuck that
---
I think you just need to learn how to play around it
---
its a boring ass perk people expect the obcession to be the looper not the claud also one of the only ways I have fun now is perk roulett
---
I can support this.
---
Either that, or lightweight and calm spirit so you can just run everywhere and still be sneaky. 
---
We were lucky during the Ps plus times and got a new killer, so it was way easier than it should
---
Meyers is so funny when they stalk lmao. 
---
I was playing with a friend who just got the game and after a few mins he goes “why is this guy just standing there looking at me”... cue t3 Meyers music and him insta going down
---
I’d run it, if only for fun with the friends. 
---
Except it means every second you can get on a gen is *that* much more valuable
---
I also got a Freddy daily worth 3000 Bloodpoints and a Billy daily worth 2500.
---
Ive invested 600.000 bps on freddy and now I have another favourite killer (I main hag and my 2nd one is billy). Ive learned how to play him properly and Im glad to say he is a good killer. Having tons of fun trying builds (insidious is hilarious) but Im still spending on him all my bps until the new killer is revealed.
---
I'm still learning the ropes but I sell it on my etsy shop:
---
https://www.etsy.com/listing/682115921/dwights-pizza-dead-by-daylight-t-shirt?ref=shop_home_active_1
---
Myers is the best killer in the game in my opinion. 
---
He is the only killer that can scare me at times because he's the only killer you can't hear coming from a mile away. You might start a match, think you're off to a good start, and find out Mikey was stalking you and is already at tier II. Going against him is when the game is at its best. 
---
Yes? No? It doesn’t stop gen rushing but it punishes them for doing it. I see where you’re coming from but it doesn’t actually stop genrushing unless they do the totems, and often the “counter” is just getting the slug 4K because they rushed the gens. Theoretically it’s a counter to gen rushing but it’s more of a suicide bomb, you gotta almost lose for it to work.
---
If it's opened with a key, then it will close after a certain amount of time
---
I play solo so it's damn near impossible to get it done
---
The pain of saving all that money.
---
I have to stop at 6 coins. There is no way I am having any part of that bullshit anymore. 
---
Rank 1 legion games are usually 2k and nearly max points.
---
I have yet to have a single DC while playing legion at rank 1.
---
Holy shit that’s an old screen shot
---
Read this and my brain autofilled ooo as order of operations, was definitely a good chuckle
---
I mean.. how exactly did you frame it in post game chat? They could have taken it as you being toxic and telling them that they were bad so they responded negatively. Especially since you got a 4K.
---
I’ll give a bad nurse a kill end game if they don’t use noed, if they do I’m out but if you’re legit learning her, I know the pain and I’m happy to give you some points. 
---
I really hoped I wouldn't ever have to see this. This happened to me as well.
---
I went to help my gf earn bp, her save file was copied to mine and I lost my save file, this happened quite a bit ago.
---
There's nothing you can do about it, in terms of getting the old save back. I'm not entirely sure, but I think if you put in a support ticket to bhvr theyll give you a bit of bp for compensation as the account did technically lose progress, I just decided to make a new fresh account for dbd, so I wouldn't know if they will 100%, but support tends to help in some way in save file related problems.
---
4 games with everyone running it? No that's called a perk being overpowered and needs brought back in line. You dont see every single killer running NOED, or BBQ. You see tons of hex ruins (the easiest perk to be countered ever) I've also seen quite a few run discordance recently. But not enough to say welp those are overpowered and need brought back in line with the other perks. As I stated in this thread DS should be accessible strictly to the obsession so if you are in a swf group your best looper should run it 
---
Yes, uh, why is French relevant? 
---
Crazy, I've had a couple games where someone d/c's. Out of ten games, only 2 were games with no d/c's
---
&gt;Runs Lightborn
---
Nea: wtf game broken pretty good job so far. 
---
Is Legion actually considered the worst killer? He kicks my ass even though I've only versed him 3 times. 
---
Oooo that's some spicy shit there I can actually see that as something creative and fun 
---
I like the lighting on the hair
---
but he’s so hunky and carries around this weird leather case made of human skin, which he made himself, we found each other on Etsy Mingle.
---
He is chill as fuck. I’m a fan. 
---
&gt;Sees Nea with Flashlight
---
&gt;Runs Lightborn, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Franklin’s Demise 
---
Show me that clicker girl
---
If you look at my profile is should be the one of the tops. Recently uploaded it 
---
I have this exact build for this one situation. 
---
Dwight, because I’m sub-par at everything and everybody hates me
---
Damn, that's a lot of points. I stopped at 6 on ps4, 3 pc. In the end I still got 9 lol
---
I love wasting firecrackers, but I would never troll a teammate like that
---
I miss my DS 60% of the time due to both the 20 fps on console and being rusty at the game.
---
The moonwalk caught me by surprise. Actually "pffft'ed" spit everywhere.
---
I should use that. lol
---
I was lowkey hoping it was gonna be a Wraith.
---
I'm thinking of making some fan chapter type things, I know they'll never be official but it seems like it could be fun and help improve my writting
---

---
What is happening here? Is this a console lag switch? I tried posting the video but the auto mod says you can't share bugs... 
---
Rank 8-5 where I sit as killer, refuse to play survivor because I'm stuck in rank 15 hell with people constantly dcing or killers magically finding me and face camping me from the start
---
No. It isn't ok to dc period. 
---
Legion is a part of the game. The devs made him he's not cheating he's intended. He's annoying but that's not a reason to ruin matches for other people.
---
That actually genuinely scared me.
---
I’ve never died to legion on console 
---
Just because he’s “Part of the game” doesn’t mean that he’s completely annoying to play against he breaks the games mechanics with an irrelevant drawback you cannot beat legion if he finds you the chase is over 
---
Why feel bad? You're the Killer! 
---
Technically yes, but he just posts all of the clips that he posts here on there as well (maybe some extras tho, not sure)
---
Regardless, [here's his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTKBkZvnscYPDGqpAnbvzw)
---
Same with nurse only difference is legion is easier to play.

here you go
---
What time does it end PST? I'm off at 3am and need 400 more moonrise points to buy fengs skirt. 
---
Nah, Phantom Virus from **Scooby Doo: Cyber Chase** would be more thematically fitting for a video game enemy.  Could make the game glitch out, temporarily unspawning pallets, turning windows into solid walls, or making solid walls vanish so he could take shortcuts.  Obviously it would operate on a timer, only work in a limited range, and only 1 or 2 glitches at a time.
---
Your overall performance in each game is rated based on four emblems. The better quality, the higher the rank bar fills up. When it fills past the notches, you either get 0 pips, +1 pip, or +2 pips. 
---
That's essentially it in simply terms. In depth, it's much more complex.
---
Jesus it’s not even that good of a torch
---
I've only ever had that happen to me in the house on the new map. Unfortunate to see it can also happen on another map.
---
Yes.  Also there’s this one section on the upper level that sometimes won’t spawn any hooks, meaning that if a survivor runs into that section then you literally can’t get to a hook in time and they are pretty much invincible.
---
Why are you healing in the basement? Why are you wasting precious time healing in the most tactical hook location on the map when you damn well know every killer will probably race straight back to the basement to ensure they can get someone else on a hook before they get too far away.
---
TDI was my literal childhood and to see this literally made me bust my gut laughing. Dude, this is awesome!!
---
What an odd map
---
Because you saw that saiyu said that BT is only good against shitty killers and joined the circle cry.
---
&gt; God forbid you dare to suggest camping is a shitty &amp; boring thing to do and isn't a gReAt StRaTeGy on this subreddit.
---
You know that's not what saiyu was doing. They were shitting into a paper bag and leaving it on a doorstep by saying BT only works on shitty killers.
---
Neither of you were "just" pointing out that BT only works on camping/tunneling killers. That would be a stupid point to make anyway because everybody knows what BT is for and people that play this game know that camping/tunneling happens in almost every game that goes to powered gates for good reason. But even then, had you been able to make that point without bringing up how much you don't like camping in a thread about perk tiers I could have left it.
---
Well The Situation going down long time for tax evasion so it’s ok to return focus back to the game.
---
the first three should be the only acknowledged three
---
This is over the last few days, was never an issue before. I have great internet and I'm hardwired... I hope it's being fixed. 
---
Ohhhhh. Well, i never tunnel/camp unless someone's gone afk
---
It’s not often with me, but I’ve experienced it I think twice now. Once, I ran across the map to unhook, froze in front of the killer, and then all in the span of two seconds I was back where I started (no heartbeats ever during this whole situation), hooked, and didn’t even get a chance to stay on it. I just died. I was LIVID. 
---
Ubisoft let players get a small amount of R6 Credits if they’re a little bit off a cosmetic they want.
---
What’s dead may never die
---
Depends on the factors. Am I using BBQ with 4 25% bonuses? Am I maxing all BP categories with BBQ? 
---
Considering I typically get around 30,000 BP with BBQ per game, each game is roughly 10 minutes, 60 minutes in an hour for 6 hours......1,000,000 cap would be reached after 36 ten minute games with 30,000 BP each game. Unless my math is bad, which it probably would be since I hate math and suck at it.
---
It applies until they are healed fully.
---
Get leather face. BBQ is amazing, LF isn’t horrible (he’s about average I’d say), and he’s cheaper because you only get a killer
---
Hillbilly
---
Distressing, Coulrophobia, Sloppy butcher and Whispers
---
NO HEAL
---
Probably not the most urgent candidate for a buff as far as survivor perks are concerned, but I see what you're saying.
---
Still, I would prefer if it worked if the killer was *within* a certain distance, not outside of. The point would be to see if you're about to get attacked at the hook, not just see the killer far away and tell your teammates where he is. The counterplay for the killer would then be to leave the hook, which should always be encouraged.
---
Fair?
---
Lockers hide auras so just hop in one when someone is about to get hooked and you're good, plus gen auras are even darker now so hiding behind them is even better
---
Yeah but they see a lit totem and become scared its something, and always try to cleanse it.
---
Got any spare buttons on your mouse you could bind to?
---
&gt; I feel that I am qualified to talk about this killer. 
---
Because you've mastered the easiest W key killer in the game?
---
&gt; Hopefully this long post helps with some counter-play. Or someone learns something. Or I get complimented 
---
Don't mean to sound like a dick but I highly doubt you're going to be complimented for being a Legion player. Majority of the player base despises that killer and frowns upon people who attempt to justify it as valid in the current meta, or in general. There's hardly any counterplay, and what you've told us to do is basically "play the game and get downed lol"
---
Good on you for taking the time to write this all out but it's stuff a lot of people already know.
---
...you can close it by hitting 3 little arrows, really?
---
Yeah, but Im not about to give them points if they do come back. Those crows are loud ASF and it's rude to your team to make them do all the work then try to take a lamp/do a door.
---
You don't get the points if your team carries you.
---
When you think they’re doing a gen and then look closer and realize theyre just crouching 
---
Killer or survivor? If killer what killer would you prefer to main
---
BHVR aren't Ubisoft. As someone else said below, it's made specifically so you don't have enough so that you buy more.
---
Ugh i really dislike Myers 
---
I use left click/right click for run and crouch. 
---
I was not rude to him. 
---
I love puppers, he’s one of the very few streamers I’ll actually watch. Seems like a legit nice dude.
---
Hang on hang on hang on.
---
She’s too short? We have tall and average killers, and no short ones yet. Chucky could definitely be there
---
Do you know your a bit racist? 
---
Thank you very much! XD
---
Could go an Identity V type route for very small killers.
---
i do agree with your breakdown of the ranks. however i’ve been rank1 for a few days (try not to be rank 1 so i can find games) and seriously feels as though i’m back at rank15 again. it’s a mixed pot.
---
i’ve been here since the start and i can safely say rank doesn’t mean squat. 
---
Well technically they camped too.
---
Best and second worst*
---
You know what I’m up to with TOTH? Farming bloodpoints. 😀
---
Autodicdicdic
---
Happy cake day 
---
[removed]
---
Nurse and Huntress. Billy and Leather stress me out in the chasees and Myers just flat out scares me.
---
A doll is humanoid. Just a smaller one.
---
They have Tall and Average killer options so surely they plan to add small height one day. 
---
That moon walk tho 
---
Thanks friend 
---
Some people play him to annoy and ruin matches for other people. 
---
I said nothing racist, child.
---
I had this just yesterday. But it was a Wraith. I cleansed all of the Totems in case he got NOED. He smacked me and I could tell he was expecting me to get down instantly.
---
It’s a good thing that 4 people had their match ruined and time wasted?
---
Borrowed time-self care-adrenaline-balance landing
---
did defensive strike originate from demi?
---
This deserves gold.
---
It is actually the ground from the lobby. 
---
I got the 6 coins for the two survivor sets and I’m done. I’m killer main but the huntress set is kinda meh for me. Plus I don’t play huntress and she’s level 1.
---
1v1 is actually easier with 5, IMO. Either way you have to do 2 to escape, but with 5 gens that's 6-7 places for the Killer to check, as opposed to just 3-4.
---
classic hahahah
---
This map makes salt for both sides. Lol
---
I didnt know the ending but as soon as Feng started teabagging I instantly thought "Oh, honey, you done fucked up."
---
WHAT DOES THE WORD MOOD EVEN MEAN ANYMORE?  THE KIDS ARE STEALING OUR WORDS.  REMEMBER WHEN LOW KEY MEANT LOW KEY?!
---
Makes sense though, he was literally all that DLC had to offer and as such was not a chapter.
---
I mean I’d you wanna be a bit more accurate to the movie wouldn’t it be a billy/leatherface
---
Yeah but the point is... they would have to make entire new animations to fit this new small killer model, and that is expensive. Its also the same reason why we wont see a killer that walks in 4 legs like an animal.
---
As a survivor I grew frustrated with the playstyle and found it incredibly cheap, so as killer I refuse to. The worst I have done is go after someone when they haven't even waited for me to leave the area to unhook, that's really their error because I don't stick around at all. I try not to tunnel either, changing up chases seems to throw off people and that's better, in the long run.   
---
If there's BM, chances are I will guard the hatch though. Normally I give it to people. 
---
Dude bakes cookies and puts sub names on a tree for christmas, I was surprised at everything he does
---
There seems to be a bug with pallet saves at the moment. Twice, I've gotten points for stunning the killer, but they didn't drop the survivor. The pallet merely displaces them instead.
---
Most probably 5 pm this Wednesday since most things (daily rituals and shrine reset happens at 5) so it makes sense for it to end at 5 
---
I'm pretty sure I outlined the problems of balance in this game clearly, then you took a turn down a different line of argument.  Can't argue on the internet: nobody has been through philosophy 101.
---
Cap your FPS, from what I've heard, the game can get significantly desynced if it's uncapped. It might help, I believe it's in your Appdata, Local, Roaming, filepath or something, called WindowsNoEditor.INI Basically a config file. In it you can cap your FPS to 50 or 60 and hopefully it will help out  
---
Unless you're on console then I'm sorry for your loss. 
---
Hmm. That means I’d have one more night. Would love to have some sort of confirmation on this. 
---
Normally with events the game will give us a countdown. Weird we’re not seeing one here. 
---
even without factors like B&amp;C and BPS? 
---
Or teleport and hit???
---
I was Billy in one game against 4 toxic survivors, they did so bad things at me and there were only 2 gens left and I have not even downed one of those vermins.
---
I was about to quit the pain but then NOED and Blood Warden made justice
---
No One Escaped
---
I'm pretty sure it's at 5 because literally every patch or change gets added at 5. Or it could be the fact I'm a console player so we get updates later (I don't think we do at least)
---
Would fit better with the toy story claw
---
hmm I think he meant Hangman's Trick bc that would have been waaay more useful for the hook sabotages
---
Now when we see a SWF groups bloddy Claudettes flash light we think nope if I join this will be an awful match. 
---
Please run borrowed time also.
---
Är svensk men fattade inte att ni pratade svenska förrän typ 35 sekunder in i videon.. var fokuserad på att kolla efter wraith i bakgrunden haha
---
happened rn killer dc'd lmao best feeling ever
---
How lol
---
Correction, *Remember me*
---
there better be a pizza what sweater soon
---
And ruin isn't? If it lasts more than 10 seconds chances are they weren't great survivors you were going against anyway.
---
If it's about 3-gen strategy, it's not holding a game hostage
---
Clean the totems. "It takes too much time" is a shitty excuse considering how fast gens can be done.
---
For one thing you should try to get survivors to do gens on only one side of the map. That way when it gets down to the last 1 to 2 gens, they’ll all be really close to one another and it’ll be so much harder for them to do gens.

Legion with a M O R I
---
aka hell
---
I was the obsession and the killer had rancor, he downed me and then stood at my corps until 3 more gens were done and then moried me
---
Nah it just means you’re a good player. Good on you
---
dude you're bordering on verysmart
---
I have only one suggestion for Pig mains: watch PsychoScorpionz. Learn from him.
---
What? Lol both are near bottom tier killers. Wraith needs add ons and good perks to even make him viable. Please try to use wraith and consistently do well at high rank
---
My main build for now sloppy butcher,myc,nurse calling,bbq and chili but slow killer  hag or legion finding and tracking sesion to painful.
---
your exactly right normaly its to mindgame, but in legions case its to abuse a poorly made mechanic.
---
seriously did the devs not stop even for a moment and think "players might try to abuse the blead out somehow" by canceling chase.
---
Ruin isn't a win more perk because its effect is immediately in play and the longer it stays up the slower the game goes no matter what.  
---
Pop Goes only slows the game down once you hook a survivor and kick one specific gen.  If you're relying on it solely to stall and it's working, you were going to win anyways. 
---
Uwu
---
Do you have lag meters on console?

Cause If people load in on PC and the survivors have 300 ping, I'm not playing that match. lol. 
---
Jeff died on the hook for our sins
---
Can we talk about legions clothes for a sec? "fairview 1996"
---
 uwu
---
Thank you :D
---
Swap nurses calling for enduring or brutal strength. Same with bbq 
---
I think the killer may be from medieval times
---
Only 25 upvotes? It must be the power of an enemy stand 
---
The max token benefit for the Obsession is 2 (3 is death), which adds up to 50% on rank 3.
---
I increased the max penalty to 30% to compensate for how Killers won't be able to quickly kill the Obsession with a Mori or Tombstone add-on.
---
Obviously depends on each persons values.
---
I know as this killer I would just savagely murder you because I can't be bothered to spend the time to let you repair gens and leave.  Even if the person focuses on the gens (they never do, they always try to play around) it can take 5+ minutes of boring ass game play.
---
To me it's a waste of both our time.  I want to play the game, not a BP farming simulator.
---
if I've been lead to the hook by a healthy survivor, and they unhook so I cant quickly down them, im far more inclined to target the much easier target, even more so if the unhooker is the obsession (or the hooked already used their DS) so I don't have to worry about DS.
---
if he didn't want me to tunnel the guy of hook, he shouldn't of unhooked literally in my face
---
I don't see why my loadout is upsetting you considering I didn't play against you with it but whatever man
---
Man, I never give survivors the hatch, except ofr this one time, where I slugged a Meg so a Claud couldn't get the hatch. I looped around the meat three a couple times and was about to down her but she started point somewhere. She signaled to follow her so I did. Brought me to the Meg I thought was long gone. I killed the Claud and gave Meg a free escape
---
what a virgin
---
Ya I love that salt every time I kill lvl 2 lv 8 survivor they trash talk in end game chat. They forget how they teebag every pallet. If they survive they says Noob killer hahahaha.... if they die they says Camper and tunneler.. they don't need to teach killer how to play this game lol. Killer job is to kill no matter how he/she plays they have no rights to make judgment hahaha....
---
Usually it’s because the lungs are bad. If everyone’s in the red I’ll just drop the lobby because it’s no fun for either of us. Occasionally if I smell SWF and I’m just not in the mood to deal. 
---
As a meg main I can confirm that this is an accurate representation of what it feels like when running.
---
Haha I love those 
---
Yeah; I'd rather not have it. There would be so many salty players whining and complaining
---
Well now I know it's not just me.
---
The Spirit's looking like "H-hey stop that!"
---
Still happens at rank 1. I had a Dwight in my lobby yesterday that  hid all game in lockers and jungle gyms except when the killer was far away he would run over to unhook you and run as fast as possible for the closest locker.
---
Perfect, thanks. Hate sharing reddit videos links...
---
What part of 'stop commenting' is your faulty brain having trouble understanding?
---
Noice!
---
It gets better at rank 1 “I promise”. Even with Kindred I can’t keep some absolute potato teammates from ignoring me on hook or two people running in at the same time cause “muh WGLF stack”
---
Is there counter play to any killer chasing you going the exact same route you do? no there is not, legion just gets the hit faster. afterwards the hits are harder to get with legion if you use feral frenzy since you don't see scratch marks and you have to hit 3 times with feral frenzy when someones in the deep wound. 
---
Can’t afford one mate
---
I'm trying my best :) 
---
Maybe use some actual statistics - at rank 1, the average escape rate is 40% - that means 1.6 survivors get out, while 2.4 survivors die. 2.4 is pretty close to 2 kills, and it wouldn't be hard to raise the survival number if people stopped using outdated meta and did generators.
---
I'll say it again people - selfcare is shit; you can still do generators while injured. Just use Adrenaline.
---
Thank you man ❤️
---
iron will is really strong against legions since i always try to hear the survivors either healing or crying. if you remove one it buffs your chances of not being found again.
---
in my eyes, he's keanu reeves with much longer hair and a huge beard
---
That was actually my thought when I searched for him! 
---
&gt; As a pig main, I have to agree that she could use a bit of love. She is a low mid-tier killer at best
---
Best Pig main I know puts her in 5th place (after Nurse, Billy, Spirit and Huntress). That's not low mid-tier in my eyes.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it :D
---
Moonwalkin' R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick
---
Interesting. Is 3 escapes fair then? What should the last survivor to leave do, sacrifice themselves to the killer if they've got any human decency, or does it only work the other way around?
---
Dying Light is really strong in the emotional side. It has this feeling of a candle or lantern being snuffed out by the darkness, this being of pure evil.
---
In the game world, that 2 minutes into the game DC feels more like a lava lamp being yanked out of the outlet.
---
Just started using detective's hunch...it's pretty badass imo. 
---
&gt; The Dead by Daylight team is happy to celebrate the Lunar New Year with the Moonrise Event. From January 30th (19:00 UTC) to February 13th (19:00 UTC), this event will give a chance for Killers and Survivors to experience new gameplay, new goals, in-game themed decorations and additional items in the Bloodweb.
---
Source: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/44395/moonrise-event
---
Except they did: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/44395/moonrise-event
---
Nah, thats not immerse clothes so it cant be
---
Lmao never saw someone that complains about some shitty perk that nobody uses and says that ds is ok
---
If everyone has stayed, then escapes are earned.
---
But DC at the start of the match puts those left behind in an unfair, impossible win situation.
---
Think before you try to interject with an idiotic statement like that.
---
I’m constantly reminded that 100% of my angry and salty messages come from survivors who are upset I didn’t follow their made up rules for the game. That’s regardless of being a killer or survivor too. 
---
I just got into the habit of responding to any angry messages with “Thanks for playing Dead By Daylight with me. I hope your next experience is more fun” and just leave the message afterwards. And people will go to some wild lengths to voice their frustration. It’s wild. 
---
Its 2019, do people still care about him? 
---
*Out
---
I love her
---
At Rank 1, I'm often completely baffled at how many survivors will unhook someone right in my face, not even giving me a chance to leave.
---
Unless the unhooked person did something ultra annoying, like flashlight click macro, or teabag at pallets, I never go for the easy down, I just knock down the sandbagging idiot.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
But DC at the start of the match puts those left behind in an unfair situation.
---
The fact that you think these two things are comparable is hilarious. Keep grasping at those straws.
---
oh no. 
---
I mean a 2k by definition is a win for everyone. But yea prolly a case of someone who hit red rank bc they play a shit ton rather than skill and got an ego
---
A bloody Claudette cant do shit with a flashlight bloody Claudettes are OchiDo fans..
---
Shmock &gt; Blood
---
Plus its better to have 4 players chase you than doing gens, guarantees a 4k
---
Underrated comment of the night
---
3 gen doc is super aids to play against which is prob why they were mad but no, it’s not bannable. Neither is the survivor sitting on the hatch because they aren’t actually doing anything to hold the game hostage, they’re just ensuring they escape. 
---
Wait? It ends today? The wiki says it will end on 13 February
---
Blasting earrape music
---
Both of your legs must be broken with all those crutches holding u up
---
It hurts my eyes so I just don’t play her, they’re prob never gonna change it tho and tbh it really needs to be super disorienting for her to be balanced so I’d just find another killer to play
---
Try to look away, or look into a wall and if they bodyblock the hook just hit them straight ahead.
---
I love to face jukers, cause i always seem to kill them all
---
Because they want to?
---
I also enjoy your downvotes every time I reply to u. Thx :.)
---
No worse than slugging for a 4k
---
it's a very cool and original logo.
---
Because they want to derank but don’t want to ruin the game and make it a 3man with 5 gens 
---
Simple solution. Don't use NOED
---
Slugging for a 4K is a cunt move. You’re just wasting one survivors time for points you don’t need 
---
I mean even a rank 1 will get downed by a rank 20 eventually
---
That, too
---
What an insightful post totally not meant as a pointless bait. Thank you, very cool
---
Assuming you were 3 genning them no its not bannable its just boring af and results in a 30 minute match
---
I answered your question fine, you just chose to act like I didn't.
---
Killers don't have team mates who can disconnect and swing the outcome of the match into the hands of the other team. Survivors do. Your interjection was redundant, regardless of what point you were trying to make.
---
Run along now, bye bye.
---
Yea, killers pretty much always pip even if they get stomped and survivors have gotten a ton of nerfs
---
Thanks. does 4k mean 4 kills?
---
It's a lesser complaint, but people still complain about it. It's because getting a hit in Feral Frenzy reveals all survivors nearby without Deep Wounds. 
---
“I’m not very good so it must be the games fault”
---
we have the same computer 
---
Bc he has zero counterplay once he finds you so the game is a boring crouch fest 
---
My dog’s called Luna :D
---
its all subjective. people are sensitive who play this game so they expect you to let them go. i just sacrifice them and get the game over with cause im not wasting my time watching them do 5 gens
---
No, it’s not a pun, that’s genuinely what Bill and Bubba’s dlcs are
---
I agree. If you see that you get genrushed and can't apply enough pressure to survivors (depends from game to game), then choose the closest 3 gens and protect those. That way they won't have peace.
---
Another good way to buy you some time is to use Hex: Ruin (Hag Perk). Ofc people can still rush through gens or just destroy your totem, but not all of the survivors are good at that.
---
If you manage to scare them away from a gen then the perk Surveillance (Pig Perk) comes in handy. That way you see regressing Gens with a white aura and if the regression ends they are marked yellow for a specific time. Plus you hear the repairing of a gen 8m further (good for spotting)
---
Hope you can use some of that
---
Apply map pressure, if you chase near another survivor hit them, if you chase a survivor past a gen being worked on, switch targets. If you just chase/camp one guy all game the other 3 just drill gens out
---
DU GAMLA, DU FRIA, DU FJÄLL HÖGA NORD, DU TYSTA DU GLÄDJE RIKA SKÖNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't think we'll get another double BP event until anniversary.
---
The thing is I've played a LOT of multiplayer games before DBD and before I started playing it I didn't have any more than 5 comments on my Steam profile. Now I have 87.
---
Guess how many of them are positive comments.
---
About 10 hours in my experience
---
I've just started playing huntress and damn the hatchet throwing is so much fun. Yesterday I somehow managed to down two claudettes from a distance during an unhook and nearly had a heart attack haha. I still miss most of the time but I'm really enjoying practicing
---
good job. I really like your drawings
---
I mean its still shitty and promotes tunneling the fuck outta your obsession
---
If hit them through the palley and then the pallet breaks you recover an hit them again straight away it's almost as good on insta down 
---
OWO yesss
---
It took me about 600h to become decent, I have about 950 and still have room to improve 
---
A big reason why it took me so long was because I spent about 200hrs watching Tydetyme so I didn't actually learn anything and just played bad for those 200h
---
No UK shipping 😭
---
Damn nice shirt tho pal!
---
If you only focus on holding 3 gens and don't play to kill the survs, then yes, you're holding the game hostage.

Alright, why exactly is sharing a common opinion regarding camping a circle jerk? It's not like either of us rejected the possibility of talking about the topic, we just gave our arguments for why camping isn't a good strategy and is considered a dick move. In a proper circle jerk we would tell you to shut up/fuck off and prevent any discussion. 
---
&gt;They were shitting into a paper bag and leaving it on a doorstep by saying BT only works on shitty killers.
---
They said it works on shitty killers, you on the other hand provided no arguments for why bt is a strong perk, you went straight to personal insults. I'd say you provided way less to the conversation than both Saiyu and I did. All you did was insult our inteligence going on how stupid we are and saying our posts are low IQ whining.
---
You ignored the fact that in most of the situations people camp not because the gates are powered and they have no other options, yet you act like this one situations invalidates everything we've said. Besides this one particular edge example, BT is almost exclusively useful only against people who tunnel and camp, aka people who aren't that good at killer.
---
Regardless of all of that, we are still talking about the usefulness of the perk, so it is very much relevant to the topic. Just because we have an opinion you disagree with doesn't in any way, shape or form make our posts irrelevant to the topic.
---
&gt;had you been able to make that point without bringing up how 
---
much you don't like camping in a thread
---
It's a comment thread on a forum, we are free to share opinions that are relevant to the topic, which they very much were. 
---
I recommend LF. Even if you don’t like playing him, he has good perks and you would benefit from just pumping bloodpoints into him! 
---
1.4k is not a low of hours for someone that's been playing since alpha
---
Just Awesome.!
---
This is code for killers on console. If your the last one and your team left then they let you go
---
Just before legion came out i used both bc i wanted to make a video on how easy they are to use. Both were low leveled so no perks and i started in rank 10 and ended around rank 3. Every game was a 3 kill for sure.
---
Whst computer is that , it kinda looks like mine
---
How many times do I need to say I'm not here to discuss exploits, I'm here to discuss countering DS. Are you slow? If you follow the comment chain then this is about countering DS and talking about exploit would just derail the topic, so why are you derailing? If you really want to discuss exploits then PM me or something and stop being annoying.
---
For accuracy, she must scream throughout the entire match before finally transforming
---
Is that... a motherfuckin jojo reference 
---
if youre a console player, stay of her, stupid 25 fps and turning around to hit someone isnt possible alot of the time
---
Once you get bloodlust 3 i doubt it. Maybe some farm maps 
---
Give me a damn subscribe button so I can't miss your art, please.
---
LoL? people still play that?
---
You sound like you would fit it in r/iamverysmart 🙄
---
Do you realize that the killer is also being punished for those DCs for no reason right? He doesnt get to play the game as he wanted either. Im a killer main and let me tell you having a survivor DC sucks for me too.
---
And in this case, he is not earning any bloodpoints, any bbq stacks, has to stay for 5 entire gens being done by a solo survivor, probably loses rank anyway. Yay so fun and fair and exciting.
---
**Why are always the killers the ones expected to be the ones being decent?** The actual decent thing to do here is go to a hook,  wait to get hooked and move on to the next match to minimize time lost for both parties because this is a videogame meant to be played and not a farming simulator.
---
Oh right vaulting doesnt prevent BL. My bad. Yeah eventually he will catch up
---
Definitely better than the last one
---
what show is this from?
---
And that is not the killer's problem.
---
its easy kills. you dont have to think about anything so if i camp i just do it because im too tired or dont want to concentrate on chasing. thats my guess for why people camp
---
XD I really like Jojo series when i was a kid.
---
Different for everyone. Blinks are less "what you know" and more "what you *feel*", you dig?
---
Only so much can be taught, the rest is muscle memory that you just gotta grind for.
---
I almost always see Dwight’s doing this when they have bond  
---
Leatherface mains + Insidious + basement 
---
75 sensitivity allows for 180s but it's still pretty hard. At 50 (default) you really can't do it unless you turn mid blink (which you can't even really do that on console as the turn sensitivity drops when you blink) 
---
Killer can theoretically protect gens around basement and then hook you there. That is what I would try to achieve.
---
From his characters left side. 
---
I was just about to get 5 stacks but out of nowhere Claudette cleanses it 
---
I play equally survs and, like, 5 different killers, and I used to care about some unwritten rules while playing both sides.
---
But in the end, nobody cares about these rules, and frankly, I couldn't really get angry at STRATEGIC camp/tunnel while playing surv, since, cmon, the killer wants to achive their goals and this game was never meant to be walk through the flowerfield.
---
As for camping? Sure, camping the whole health of the first person who you found, at 5 gens to do is just bad for killer's BP and bad for the surv who get, like, 1k points and de-pip hard. But there is a thin line sometimes, between bm camping and strategic camping. 
---
It is discouraging when you get messages accusing of "toxic" camping, after a long match where you spend zero seconds near the hooked person, but at endgame you hook someone at 2 open gates. Like, really. What is my goal now except for securing that kill? This considering I wear no endgame perks and I don't want to since I already have at least 2 kills at that time, while having everybody equally hooked before (gib me my bbq stacks :D). If you tell me reasonable goal for this moment, I'll gladly take it. But there is none, and thats where I get tons of salty messages accusing me of camping.
---
As for tunneling. There is a thin line too. Do you wear Iron Will? No? Then please, oh please, play killer once, with good headset. If I hook you, proceed to kick a gen nearby, you get unhooked while I am still in proximity and haven't commited to any other activity, should I just ignore the fact I have 2 people there? Please don't treat killers as mindless bots, of course we are going back there. And the trick is. I CAN HEAR YOU MOANING BEHIND THAT ROCK. So, it sucks, I know, I've been there as surv; the person who unhooked you might be like 3 meters away, but if I visually miss them, you are the target cause I hear you. 
---
Got salty msg once, simply because I found only the same person over and over again. It was light colored, perma injured Laurie, who tried to hide behind trees that were too thin to cover her whole body. Accused of tunneling. Like, dude, git gud.
---
tl'dr: please don't equate "camping and tunneling" with "toxic bm", these have their strategical uses and if we do equate them, we end up calling out every killer toxic unless they play like idiot bots who get pitiful amounts of BP.
---
so tip with your first point: You should not care so much about kills. Hook someone, then go try and bully gens. The more you chase and hook people the more points you get, the more pressure you put on the others, and the better you will get. 
---
Now there are times when you do need to secure a kill, and you have two options: know your terror radius, and walk away until they are outside and then come back for the kill, or play a killer who has an instadown.
---
For your second point: It depends. I've been playing at red ranks for 2 and a half years now and I still consider myself shit. In this game you *will* lose sometimes, even if you play perfectly. Survivor is just easy to escape with, accept that and keep going. Winning is not a realistic goal to shoot for as killer, if you want to have any fun play for different reasons.
---
As a doctor main I prefer Iridescent King to annoy everyone 
---
He activated maximum overdrive and got next to Puppers in a blink of an eye. 
---
Shes reaching max toxicity levels.
---
I actually never drop lobbies (because I don't really give a fuck) but understandable reasons to do so are:
---
* Red Ping
---
* An obvious SWF
---
* Multiple Flashlights
---
* An obviously cancer survivor (Prestige 3 Claudette named HOOKMEDADDYXD with a flashlight)
---
* Dweard
---
* Obviously foreign name (Can lead to bad ping).
---
This really doesn't make sense in way, shape, or form.
---
- These 10% off discounts are for buying the whole set. If you buy the three items individually, they're 1200, but buying the set is 1080. It's literally 10% cheaper. It doesn't magically make the offer not there if every item has the same deal on, you're still saving 10% by buying the bundle.
---
- Even if you're looking at this as a one off sale, if a store has a weekend where everything is 10% off, then you're still saving the 10% by buying that weekend? Having a 10/20% off weekend is actually pretty common, and it makes sense to advertise that lmao.
---
I don't get what your angle is.
---
Nurse on console is rough due to the garbage sensitivity for controllers. So it's probably gonna take you quite a while.
---
killer main spotted :p
---
*hits blunt*
---
Breh.
---
Looking up or down helps you change floors. It can also change your Blink distance too.
---
Dying light is a win more perk. If you manage to tunnel a survivor to death quickly then you likely don't even need dying light to capitalize it and conversely,  if you can't kill the obsession before gens are almost done then it won't help you much either.
---
Oooh he wants that booty
---
ZubatLEL memes in Apex these days
---
Yeah he does but VOD‘s or his Youtube Videos are still there.
---
He said he‘ll return to DBD eventually.
---
well he is raginghardon420.
---
I got mine this weekend gone! I put off and put off and put off Rank 1 killer as it was so stressful on my last attempt. Cracked it w legion and am now stuck at R1 consistently 3-4k ing w Leatherdaddy! Yeayyy!
---
I'm still going to dc against legion. And they should get rid of both noed and ds. Wow surv main. Wow killer main.
---
I am better at 1500 hours than I was at 1000, and better than than I was at 500. I would say 200-400 hours is when you should have a good grasp of things, and a decent loadout of perks. (The grind is insane, for killers, defintley get BBQ asap, along with Nurses, Ruin if you need it etc.)
---
Learn how emblems work, kills actually don't give that much, and its always better to hook/chase/hook than to camp, sometimes its not even worth hooking when you down someone if you think you can apply yet more pressure, survivors having to heal, get people up from the ground, make rescues, it all draws them away from gens, into areas of the map with less pallets.
---
 You want to be as busy as possible and if you devote too much time to 1 survivor, you are being led away from where gens are being done.
---
Aim to get at least 1 hook by the time the first gen pops. be aware of locking down a 3 gen.
---
Don't worry, 9 hours is nothing in this game, keep at it, don't let any BM get to you, when you feel competent play as much survivor as you can to help get a rounded idea of what both sides do.
---
Good luck in the fog!
---
Yeah. It's upsetting to go against those killers, but I would blame the game for allowing that more than the players. But they said camping is a viable strategy or something, so that's not changing.
---
Don't think hes bad for the community, he did get busted in the past for hacking. I'm a fan of his YouTube content, not so much for his streaming, his chat/fans are to put it nicely not my speed.
---
he dm'ed underagr girls for nudes
---
I had the same thing last night used a bloody party streamers, three people disconnected and the killer helped me get all the gens, a lantern, chests, pallet stuns, both gates and a hatch escape. 
---
Ended with 44k BP and a Rank up thanks to him. 
---
I would just kill them and expect the same decency if I'm the survivor. The game is not meant to be fair, the killer is supposed to kill mercilessly, regardless of the survivor's (and his own) no and pips.
---
You don't :)
---
Lmao that’s a good thing?
---
LOL
---
Is this the same Cows who played csgo?
---
Back when saboing was kinda meta
---
Haven't finished it, but I bet it's legion.
---
Never mind 👌
---
Not a good nurse myself, but have you tried using the addon that shows you the landing point for the blink? I've heard it helps you get a better feel for how long to charge your blink
---
3 genning as doctor is not holding the game hostage, it's super unfun, but the survivors can progress the game whether it causes death or not.
---
Hatch standoffs are not holding the game hostage, or at least both sides are equally guilty so neither one has grounds to report the other.
---
&gt;Give Awarkiller had bloodlust, if he didnt flip it he would have got hit
---
Not the last time, just before the video ends 
---
Yeah its a gimmick, and its a gamble. But it's interesting.
---
Sure, it's one way. And you know how it'll be exploited? You'll see survivors who will run to killer, will be downed instantly and die on first hook. Yes, a little longer than straight up DC on game start, but they will derank, and you won't be able to punish them automatically.
---
The editing on this video is magical. 
---
????? the killer was like 2 meters behind him????? if he didnt flip it he would have died
---
&gt;who cares. I'd rather them focus on balance and fixing broken shit in the game then pump out yet another killer, There's enough killers, survivors and perks in the game as is. If you're "bored" then it's a shit game because at it's core, the game should keep you interested because it's fun and engaging. Not because of some carrot on a stick "what's next" every 6 months that introduces more issues and broken shit because they're a small team trying to spread itself across doing too much at once.
---
That's what the mid chapter patches are for. New chapters are meant to keep the game fresh with new map, new characters and new perks along side some reworks that they can sneak in. 
---
Mid Chapter Patch is all about balancing and fixing bugs but, they are not reddit so they take very careful steps towards making changes to their game instead of just "nerf this, buff that". 
---
&gt; For how hard it is to get a kill with a reverse bear trap, why does it give less points than shocking someone as the fucking doctor?
---
I would say shocking survivors is your job as a Doc, getting a kill with RBT is an accident.
---
But its better than nothing and it takes more time away from the killer.
---
Just completely ignoring the problem because "they just abuse it another way" will certainly not solve anything
---
For sure, it's efficient enough to see facecampers at rank 1, so I think it could be punished just a little more.
---
How often do you play killer &amp; how far in the killer ranks have you gone? Just curious.
---
I found it in the Playstation Store https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP3367-CUSA08032_00-CHARITYCASE00000
---
Love playing Freddy. Used to main him, he's just so unique compared to all other Killers.
---
Yeah, but it shouldn't be quite so easy and effective. It would be nice if people just wouldn't camp, but the only way I could see people moving away from camping, would be if it pretty much cost every other survivor escaping to ensure that one kill.
---
 Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves 
---
1. Yes it does
---
2. Yes the timer begins.
---
3. The timer does not reset for traps unless you put a new trap on a survivor.
---
4. A timer will only start when a generator is complete or automatically if all 5 gens are complete
---
5. It is very difficult to get a reverse bear trap kill because it's basically rng. Good addons to run to help getting kills are tampered timer (decreases bear trap timer) and last will (adds an extra jigsaw box)
---
There is. It's to make you mad.
---
&gt;Even all 3 never leave gens, the hook timer will go out before they can leave, easily allowing a second kill to camp. It's the whole reason you see this, even at high ranks, you can still pip by just facecamping.
---
Which is why you need to use your brain + borrowed time and swap places with the hooked guy to buy more time to rush gens.
---
Camping is easily defeatable with the right tools and strategy (unless bubba with his chainsaw revved)
---
The Myers knows what's good. I got in a match where everyone dced except for me and the killer put me on the hook anyways :(
---
CLAUDERINA
---
We care enough to get his pedo ass banned whenever he pops up.
---
If survivors play smart, it's pretty much like this now.
---
There's a ping max you can set in your steam settings, but it only goes as low as 250.
---
Killers who don't like running infinites and getting BMd when doing poorly make me lol. If you don't like the way the game works don't play.
---
A CHICKEN RUN MEME?! Life = complete
---
also added: a mori animation for a vessel
---
Yeah I've had that happen to me as the killer. It was the same pallet too. Luckily I was playing as Billy so after a few attempts at trying to chainsaw the pallet it allowed me to do so. 
---
I would presume Leatherface could cut his way out of the pallet too. The Nurse and Hag should also be able to use their ability to get unstuck. Everyone else is fucked. 
---
 
---
The difference is immediately noticeable even on the title screen for the standard vs pro. The upgrade is arguably worth it, assuming you don't plan to get a PC shortly after. It's really only Nurse that is unplayable with a Pro, simply due to how her mechanics work and the turning speed limit. Honestly if the max turn speed was 5x the current it might work. If you play other games, the Pro is worth the upgrade. Otherwise wait until the next console generation (probably within a few years) or get a PC. PC parts go on sale often and most of the parts for my PC were heavily discounted. Unless you'll be leaving behind a bunch of friends, it's worth the investment in the long run. Cheaper games, smoother experience, better graphics, less crunching on aim assist and similar features.. it just feels more natural and functional. I can't stress the differences enough. It's hard to even consider booting up my PS4 Pro because the difference is like night and day. I still have so many games to finish on the PS4 but... god the FPS is just staggering
---
Looks like the perfect time to kobe and I know you wouldn't want to break your space bar.
---
After one killer did that with me and a friend, I started doing it too, if I see people disconnecting. It's not really fair to play that way and the survivors are always so happy. It's a nice feeling, that you may just have made their day a little better :)
---
Yeah I know that we have to consider timezone and stuff but I am wondering why they are writing 13 February on the wiki when it isn't the 13 February. Neither in UTC nor in any of the timezones in Canada. And I am using UTC and the canadian timezones (iirc Central time is one of those) since these would make the most sense for an announcement: UTC because it's the "World Time" and Canadian timezones since BHVR is a Canadian dev studio. I mean if it ends today: Ok it's fine, but I still think it is a little strange.
---
idk why i just love frank's voice HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
But the insidious facecamp completely counters borrowed and allows them a grab if they want. Usually they'll just let the unhook go through then rehook right away to quickly get the first kill. I see it semi-frequently, and there's really nothing that can be done.
---
*spirit grabs you out of nowhere*
---
As a Legion main, this is me every time 2 people dc before I even have the chance to get my devour hope/BBQ stacks off of them and I’m left farming with the other poor souls.
---
It doesn't buy quite enough time, especially with Ruin, unless the first chase cost Ruin+1 gen maybe.
---

---
Then you need to wait for TR to unhook... bait the killer out of his idle position. Use your brain. 
---
Nice hahaha
---
Puppers is always so chill about things, I enjoy watching his streams 
---
Yes, but it's highly disproportionate given how hard one is to do as compared to the other. Using the diodes, you can easily generate 2k BP in one chase just by having good reading skills, whereas you'd need to kill all 4 survivors just to get that same 2k. 
---
Yes, but if they make the smart play and don't move, it's gg. They get a kill for doing nothing, and you've spent your time trying to bait them.
---
Your friendly neighborhood Dungeon Master agrees. 
---
&gt;Love playing Freddy. Used to main him, he's just so unique compared to all other Killers.
---
Whats unique about him? or more specifically, his gameplay? He walks and press M1 after X seconds.
---
Hahahahahah well deserved, and this is coming from a survivor main 😂😂 absolutely no need to teabag
---
That my good fucking sir is amazing on a new lvl of omfg I love it.
---
GG WP best killerboi
---
Doesn't LoL still have the largest tournament scene in gaming?
---
I know it got overtaken by Fortnite a long time ago in popularity, but no one likes watching Fortnite BR's tournaments because everyone hides in buildings like scared mice.
---
You don't "do" kills with RBT. You get them if survivors are unlucky (or if you tunnel, but that's another subject). And getting a lot of BPs for getting lucky is... unnecessary.
---
They are mainly talking about Ochido and other people who bm or whatever.
---
I bet he cut right when he got downed.
---
Definitely making chapters sound really fun I thought about a survivor idea but I'm pretty sure everyone would hate it XD I say you go for it!
---
Even though I main legion I agree, I’d love a rework 
---
I love you all, even without having smoked. 
---
Yeah I think they can definitely make it work too 
---
Alright as a console Nurse short loops are and will be your demise. Just make distance by walking or blinking away. It helps at the start but I’ve seen some people consistently get short loop hits.
---
I dunno the swf joke felt too long and the spirit joke was plain unfunny
---
to be fucking honest dude the camping ahasnt been as hard as in the red ranks
---
^
---
I lost it when he starts to moonwalk.
---
Cool
---
Another roost of a post that got over 100 upvotes. I love Reddit.
---
it is ok to dc against legion. i encourage it actually
---
Puppers is such a wholesome streamer. Dude looks like such a hugger as well. Much love to this man.
---
Expanding on that the totem for the perk does not activate until all the gens are done so sometimes the situation will happen where someone is cleansing a dull totem before NOED even activates and the last Gen is done and the totem you were cleansing turns out to be NOED and you cleanse it in a few seconds. 
---
so im not allowed to “ruin matches for other people” meaning i have to stay in my match which was ruined? doesn’t sound fair to me
---
I hate having them all pop in the lobby at the same time, even solos. I have to just eat it now because I can't be sure, and not kidding, I got ***THREE*** rank 2's queued with a rank 19, as a rank 10 killer. And the rank 19 was full meta build too, so that match was especially painful. I know generally rank doesn't matter, though it's just icing on the cake when you have the deck fully stacked against you and get bullied all game. I only have like... 5 killer teachables and it's a gut-punch to get something like that. I wish it was avoidable again.
---
If the bear trap gave a high amount of points you'd get toxic killers cheesing it for points.
---
You dont actively try to kill a surv with the trap. Its a pressure game.
---
Fine but the posts are annoying
---
so is legion but i still see him in the game
---
Is that a fucking onion as the Polish Hussar Bee's weapon?
---
&gt; but with the old pallet ratio complete with the vacuum.
---
How would that balance it? 7 survivors vs 2 killers is already tipping the power towards the survivors but giving them the overpowered vacuum pallets would be overkill?
---
So is killers hitting my but killers still in the game
---
Anyone know GMT?
---
yep
---
This meme is outdated. Flashlights are a joke now. You just better go in without an item and don't risk getting dodged then pick up some firecrackers from a chest.
---
PSA also, gens cover your aura too, so hide behind it for 6 seconds or if in open walk one way for 6 then about face and get back on that gen instead of running to lockers every 5 seconds
---
firecracker are bad
---
Because it is just 'ok'. The only time it's 'amazing' is when the exit gates are open. Do you know how many times I've seen a DS user get downed seconds after using it? Literally 90% of the time. Then the killer tunnels them and facecamps just because they used a perk the devs made. Dying light is rare to see compared to DS yes, but when it is used the obsession better not be found otherwise the game is over for them. 
---
Yeah, you could do this, but i think it's not annoying enough for the killer. I wish back the good old times with insta-flashlight... Mmhhhhmmm, completly balanced
---
hella sandbags lmao, see someone in a locker, quick enter it, killer comes and searches it, and now the other survivor trying to hide is on the hook.
---
Dwights gonna Dwight.
---
Me playing Legion when I finally get my Devour Hope stacks.
---
Oh yeah, the brown clothes and the green clothes as well.

---
I'm not sure how reliable this website is, but it seems to be pretty accurate from what I can tell. 
---
So you can take that "PeOpLe StIlL pLaY tHaT?" attitude and put it on a shelf because League is still the most played game in the world, or at least in the top 3 of the most played games.
---
she can literaly just stand still, and look where the survivor goes, then adapt to that and bam, no chance for the survivor
---
If she’s standing still and waiting to see where you go then walk in one direction and switch after a couple seconds once you think she’s phasing. It’s a game about predicting your opponent and playing accordingly, she has some tools to track you but it’s still easy enough to throw her off if you can predict her.
---
Just because the default survivor tactic of pallet looping tactic doesn’t work doesn’t mean she ignores game mechanics, it just means that you have to use your head instead of some piles of wood. If you find yourself constantly struggling against spirit then see if you can work iron will into your build, it’s a good perk even if your not playing against spirit so it’s not like your at a disadvantage against other killers for running it.
---
I don't know. What's unfair now? Just assume that there are at least two survivors who are in SWF group. According to devs stats you'll be right like 80%+ of the time (if I remember correctly).
---
You all should've dc and not letting the killer get the points.
---
He’s gotta return some videos.
---
This is why I use agitation on bubba... also for basement time!
---
I ran this, Ruin, and Haunted Ground last night as Spirit, just because those are what the Bloodweb kept giving me, lol. It was utter pandemonium when my whole screen was red with locations and they were all constantly popping off, hahaha. They eventually got them all, but only one or two gens and I sacrificed them all in the end.
---
that lucky...
---
Lmao I did this with Doctor yesterday. 
---
Yeah that thing is dope but it’s a very rare addon, and it’s better to learn without it just because if u use the flannel and base your blink distance off of that in other matches then using any blink addons at all is gonna seriously throw you off. 
---
holy fuck man, this that guy that made CSGO videos like 4 years ago?
---
Could be a wraith though
---
Blah blah r/dbdgonewild blah blah
---
its only 66% speed instead of 50. not that much difference.
---
Real men use no mither
---
True but it’s not as much of a concern if he gets close anyway. I’m more worried about Michael stalking from some area 😂
---
As a general rule I believe rank means something, but it's too whitewashed and cluttered on the top because it's too easy to rank up. So at the end of the day there are a lot more people at rank 1 that don't reflect the perceived skill required to be rank 1.
---
Honestly just re-scaling the depip/safety pip side of things/making a 2 pip super hard would do wonders, as well as increasing the rank ladder. 
---
I used it. It's works well for finding those hidden totems.
---
I've no idea, I didn't bother clicking your link :)
---
Noob3 isn't actually as toxic as other players tbh. He does have his moments which kind of piss me off but I enjoy most of his content.
---
That I would like.
---
For this, i really love quoting Saminations parody:
---
"Why???"
---
"You nerds don't get it, no mither allows me to- AHHH"
---
Someone needs to show it to Mcote and the crew. This is too funny.
---
He’s gonna get banned there and then he’ll move to the Switch version, then he’ll move to the mobile version, then he’ll move to the board game version, then he’ll move to the book version, then he’ll move to the cave painting version and then eventually, he’ll move to the IRL version and still get banned.
---
He’s like a cockroach
---
Cancer
---
When I can't hear the heartbeat for over a minute I assume it's a Trapper or a Wraith.
---
Nope. You just gonna have to do gems or wait to be killed. That’s why DCing is toxic .
---
Awwwww, I love this Myers 😍
---
Complain about every minor mistake as if everyone plays 100% perfectly 
---
this is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while
---
Depends on the angle you are crouching at compared to the killers location behind the gen 
---
So we acting like ochido is a Bigfoot now?
---
I don't run it because I miss it so much. I carry urban evasion or P E B B L E
---
Wow... F to pay respects.
---
They’re wasting their time on their day job, this is what they should be doing as a living lmao it was great
---
It's a shitty game, stop being triggered. Lol is trash
---
Thanks to people like you I can start BBQ-snowballing as soon as the game starts
---
How come in the video 3 if them Dc’d, but the hatch opened. I think I’ve had times where people Dc and made it out the hatch.
---
Camping is only efficient when survivors let it be . If they just all go and do a gen they can pop 2-3 by the time you die on hook. Most of the time the killer gets more kills from it when survivors run up and just try to wait around the hook doing nothing or try to make a save without borrowed time. 
---
If the killer who relies on camping constantly only gets 1 kill they will eventually stop or keep losing. I definitely understand how frustrating it is especially if you get caught early and with how long wait times are with this event going on but it’s really not that good of a strategy 
---
I got stuck in the pallet with a survivor as Nurse yesterday. I hit them and downed them, blinked to freedom, destroyed the pallet and then picked them up. As long as your killer has the power to escape it’s a new nerf for survivors lol
---
I love it
---
Every SWF survivor should have a SWF icon attached. That way you'll know how many are SWF.
---
Yes Iam the same Cows! 
---
Perfect.
---
The tunneling aspect is hard to eliminate, but with this version at least you need to be hooked 3 times for the Killer to get the maximum bonus.
---
Seems better than getting Mori'd/Tombstone'd asap.
---
⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆ 
---
This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.Be careful, friends! 
---
Damn, okay, guess I never saw a message about this. Thank you!!
---
Noob3 plays a little toxic but it's good natured toxicity if that makes sense.  He's just messing around having fun and he doesn't disrespect killers or talk shit and if he gets camped he laughs it off.  Ochido on the other hand...truly believes he has never received a single hit or down in the game that wasn't the fault of bad coding or bullshit hitboxes, insert additional bullshit excuse here...and goes out of his way to make killers feel like shit both during and post game.  He's the type of toxic that's bad for the community.  I think most people are fine with Noob.
---
and the killer just looks up?
---
If they DC the hatch spawns instantly. I've had so many coordinated SWFs do this. I honestly do not care about 4k's so i don't slug the 2nd last person but if i know where the last guy is (after hooking the 3rd), i know where the hatch is and i know i can get to them before they get to the hatch, of course i'll try to kill em, then the 3rd guy DCs and boom, instant hatch escape.
---
How is that not cheating/exploiting a game mechanic in an unintended way?
---
You're right, it's much worse
---
This is false. The hatch opens at a normal time, with each DC counting as a kill. With 3 dcs you need to repair 2 gens to spawn (and this open)
---
Lol thanks for the laugh. Great way to start the day.
---
Standing here staring at a hook WOOT!  This is such a fun and engaging experience, truly edge of your seat thrill ride gameplay WOOT!  I don't know if this is more exciting or skillful probably skillful WOOT!  SO MUCH FUN!
---
Mama Mia 
---
Legion is not fun due to the single fact that even if you're the best survivor in the world, someone semi-ok with legion will always down you since he can practically ignore pallets, windows and if he moonwalks or proxy chases it's even worse. Bonus points if he has franklin's mixtape.
---
I don't do it, since i find it quite boring and a waste of time but there's nothing wrong with securing the 4th kill, it doesn't break any game rules (except those "rules" set by whiny survivor mains...), unlike DCing which is a bannable offense. And DCing to *instantly spawn the hatch* is an exploit &amp; cheating.
---
Thanks
---
I prestiged but

Sloppy butcherer, coulraphobia, knockout, noed

I just wish they went back to old harder pip system for killers when it was solely based on hooks/kills.  Face camping filth had such a hard time ranking up back then they typically didn't move past ten ranks because even if they got a 2nd body it usually was just a safety.  There are now so many campers at rank 1 it's disgusting.  It used to be that if you got to rank 1 survivor you'd face better killers but they'd typically play fun competitive games.  But now.....not so much man.  Lots of camping trash in redranks these days.
---
Survivor will get absolutely no points for doing this. They might as well DC too if not wasting the killer's time is the"decent" thing to do. Killers already get DC points and that's the fastest way they can get to the next game, so they would still get a lot more out of it.
---
You want even slower lobby times for survivors?
---
Superman Nicholas Cage is the best cosmetic.
---
The worst part for me is that Ace is supposed to be lucky
---
I'm at rank 1, and the level of play there is still really bad most of the time.  I die about 80-90% of my games.  Why?  Because balance.  You can say, "you're bad, get good.". But then why am I rank 1?!  Shouldn't you place me with others of the same skill?  Also just realized, literally yesterday, independent of your comment, how bad self care is.
---
Yes, this bitch will leap from tree to tree. has thermal vision and can shoot you from across the map!  /s  
---
All jokes aside, would be pretty cool :P
---
He used to be buddies with OchiDo and play with him a lot. If you watch his old videos you'll see the kind of stuff people mean. Over the past year or two though his attitude has changed immensely and he no longer does a lot of that stuff. He cut ties with OchiDo I think when he came about that he would harass underage girls. I enjoy No0bs content and his streams, the only thing that ruins it are the sheer amount of people that ask to have sex with him. 
---
Mate, you're either completely exaggerating or talking complete nonsense.
---
Regarding the surv: If you finish 3 gens by yourself, you already have iridiscent in the objective category. In that case, you only have to survive for more than 5 minutes to gain a silver emblem. So you have 6 points, which already yields you your safety pip. And we're assuming that you get no emblem in any other category, which is impossible because if you do get points for stealth too, so even if you're never chased, you will still get points for the evader emblem. Now, if we assume you also unhook two survivors which are safe (so you don't farm them, that actually loses lot more points than you gain), you will get at least a silver emblem. Add those up: Iridiscent objective, silver benevolent, silver unbroken and let's just assume bronze evader if you've been away from the killer all the time. That's actually 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 point. These are 9 points, which actually gives you a pip, even tho barely.
---
Regarding the killer: That is nonsense. If you kill only one person, you will only receive a bronze emblem in devout. That yields one point towards the pip. That makes it absolutly IMPOSSIBLE to gain a double pip because you need at least 14 points for a double pip, but the remaining three emblems can only yield 12 points. If you kill two survs, it's possible, but barely, you'd need iridiscent in every other category and honestly, if you have that many emblems you probably have more kills too. 
---
I think you're not really objective on that topic. I know you're a new player, but what you said is basically impossible.
---
No, imagine how much dodges would have.
---
Thanks!  I studied arts and culture at a high tier University.
---
Finally the event is over tomorrow and there's going to be a rank reset. There's way too many rank 15 survivors on rank 1 right now thanks to these things giving them a point boost that in 99% of the cases becomes a free pip up. I even noticed that it's almost impossible to depip as survivor now unless maybe you get downed in the first minute of the match and camped/tunneled.
---
I know "rank doesn't matter", but woo I made it to rank 1! Being the dumbass I was, I thought for some reason I had to reach rank 1 and get 5 pips, so I was at rank 3 thinking it would take forever. Played casually with some friends, who ended up being sacrificial goats by accident, and helped me reach rank 2. Was one pip away and landed in a super close Legion match. I pulled off various hook saves in hopes it would help me pip, and it did! Guess I lucked out in having a non-camping Killer. 
---
And ballons?  Really?  What are ballons?
---
Right, but this specification is applicable to all killers.
---
Discordance, Monitor and Abuse, Stridor and BBQ for the points.
---
yeah i just to the hook and point. momma raise no bitch
---
No it is not. Gen Rushing is countered by perk that slow the game down, like Sloppy butcher, Ruin.  
---
Gen Rushing is countered by you being able to end a chase quickly, forcing half the team to stop working on a gen.  
---
NOED rewards you one kill because you sucked the whole game.
---
You can use it to pretty accurately determine the location of a survivor. With some simple movement at the edge of Whispers range you can reduce the area to a quarter and then just walk for 7 seconds (115% speed killer) into that direction. 
---
I play Whispers + BBQ so I get to start my first chase super quickly (with Whispers) and then bounce from BBQ to BBQ. Amazing combo! Billy btw
---
Lol dude if you're here to defend the use of mindless camping with gens up fuck off man.  That shit had no place in red ranks.  That's how rank 20 killers are supposed to play since they haven't learned to play the game yet.  You got no excuse to pull that crutch ass shit anywhere near rank 1.
---
Finally! *A weapon with layers...*
---
And then they pick you up, you miss your Decisive and the SWF drops the firecrackers too early so you're getting camped. Your gen rusher friends finish the gens but can't unhook you so they leave with their sweet 12k points.
---
We need an alien life form in this game and I think he’d be the coolest 👌
---
No0b3 has been busted 2 times in the past. 1 time for hacking his legacy skins and another time for griefing. He had toned things down quite a bit and is highly skilled at the game. 
---
With that being said, I  personally dont enjoy his content. Nothing against him, just not my cup of tea. At least he doesn't smurf and depip.  Content creators that do that to bully lower ranked killers make me sick.
---
Yes, heja Sverige, heja Stefan Löfven, heja dbd
---
Knowing how chill Nicholas Cage is he'd probably agree to have his image used in the game for free or a nominal fee.
---
You should’ve slow vaulted to get him out 
---
You cannot get a RBT kill by tunneling 
---
I don't think the firecrackers have worked on me once during this event. Like I'm not trying to say I'm some skilled blind dodger, I fucking suck, they just don't seem to work very well.
---
I get so much shit for using NOED on Legion
---
It would be nice to know at the end at least 
---
I imagine T3 Myers as a Telepath(Nightmares are underwhelming unfortunately) and T1 Myers as a mimic.
---
This movie was releases like yesterday. Boi is the meme comunity fast.
---
Where the hell does that name come from lol 
---
It’s the same with killer honestly, so many killers that play like rank 20 are in rank 1
---
He sounds like Morty
---
The context is the most important part.  3 gen strat is one thing, but not going after a survivor when he isnt even running away just so you can camp the gens is bs. I had a doc that did this to me and the match lasted 47 minutes.  In the end,  I  ran to the basement and searched a chest, got a purple key and all of us got out via hatch. Then the doc has the nerve to say we held the game hostage. Lmfao salty bastard.
---
&gt; You cannot get a RBT kill by tunneling 
---
Not if you crouch-chasing them
---
Ha, nice. It is actually insane how much you start to rely on the sound for skillchecks. I sometimes have matches where I feel that the generator just randomly exploded, until I noticed it was Huntress Lullaby. Tbf, one of those matches was against a 4 blink Nurse, so I had other things to pay attention to
---
[THIS IS AMAZING!](https://youtu.be/JgkiC0ou8tk?t=7)

---
I'd be jumpscared as well! That Dwight just flew into your face.
---
It the killer was wraith be careful.
---
Make it with a +100% Blodness BP effect on top. That BM gonna get you killed lol.
---
Sure. I am not aware of how the current situation is with survivor smurfs since I've only experienced the survivor side yesterday.  
---
But it is probably the same problem for newcomer killers when they enounter smurf survivors with end build perks.  
---
In all these matches I had yesterday only a few survivors seemed to be smurfs or some sort of experienced players. Nonetheless most of them died or quit the game very soon, there was no big advantage.
---
Prestige 4 Claudette confirmed? Defo lobby dodging this.. 
---
That was happening since the event started
---
can get 1 mil from just 20 killer games. i could easily play 20 games per day (not always killer but makes no difference) and i usually do, so about 7 mil i would guess
---
A moonwalking myers are always okay in my book. 
---
250 winters on meg, 200 winters on nea, 40 chinese on claudette

Yup, i'm pretty much dead now

*gets downed near hook*
---
*gets dribbled*

Aside of that, he can only use it one time
---
i would like to introduce you to our hairy friend Jeff
---
Before the pip rework i always ranked up every game, no exception. I could fuck around as much as i wanted and it didnt matter. 
---
chapter 11’s killer will be the oldest in history. i doubt there will be magic
---
I came from League after playing the game since season 2. Trust me dbd community, y’all could not hold a toxic flavored candle to League’s toxicity. This community is not worthy of the nonsense that happens in Leagues community. At least here people being verbally offensive is quickly punished. 
---
I still remember the fact that League’s punishment system was removed, literally replaced with nothing for years, and the automatic system they hamfisted into place couldn’t catch someone for months. People could grief, troll, verbally abuse you over and over and blocking people would still let them join your games in matchmaking and the ranked system there was tied to actual in game rewards so you just got to deal with Toxic Tammy flaming you all game. 
---
Take several seats, DbD. 
---
Its completely unbalanced
---
Like I'm not even scared of the Michael it's the goddamn downed dwight falling from the sky lmao
---
Thana, bloodhound, monitor &amp; abuse, discordance.
---
Y’all still using perks in 2019? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
That doesn't happen like at all. Most people won't buy a new account just to never get past rank 15. If OP is in fact talking about 2nd accounts then they are heavily overestimating the ammount of them.
---
I may be mistaken but I am sure I heard somewhere that you cannot de-rank past 15 to stop people just going all the way back to 20 to smurf?

I don't think your time ban system will work on DBD. Although effective on Rainbow Six it still has massive complaints due to the fact you may DC for reasons not of your doing and then you have a ban. Rainbow servers are a million times better than DBD so in it's current state so many people would be complaining about getting banned for lagging out games or glitching etc, or what if a killer/survivor takes game hostage so your only way out is to DC and then you have a ban? Maybe when they have dedicated servers it could be a good deterrent but the other reason it kind of works on Rainbow is that when your banned from ranked you can then still play casual, keeping you on the game, this isn't the case with DBD so more people would be frustrated and just turn the game off.   
---
You also have the fact you can de-rank by simply not playing, if you hide in the basement for example as killer and move about so your not technically AFK you will de-pip every game.   
---
Smurfing is an issue on almost every online game as some people just get lols from feeling godly. Personally I have only de-ranked to be able to get games or with killer so I can learn the more complicated killers without being against red rank survivors. I think DBD would need to tackle it in a unique way such as making it so you can only use level 1 perks from rank 20 to 15. Technically your supposed to be learning the game so it shouldn't affect new gamers too much, especially if they make it so the bloodweb doesn't keep giving them higher levels of the same perk, and the most important factor that it could deter high rank players smurfing down if they can't use the best versions of their perks. 
---
It's unreal, how is she generating so much power?
---
WMI is only good for faster heals. If Killer comes back to the hook, you won't heal fast enough anyway. If Killer doesn't, then what's the point anyway?
---
The Leader doesn't buff repair speed and therefore only useful for healing.
---
Self Care is still a must-have.
---
What's so good about BL? How is it better than any other exhausting perks?
---
Yeah it's a series, but apparently there was a movie released too. I forgot the name of it, but a quick Google search should be enough. :)
---
Dumb question, second one today, but, what is rancor?
---
:O
---
I've been against a lot of billy's lately with thrill of the hunt+ruin+haunted

It's easy to counter in a swf, but when you're with a pug it's pure ass, even touch a totem and he's on your butt in a heartbeat

It does but its marginal. Like when a killer dcs at the start of a match you get 5000BP
---
Can confirm, I fucked up. It was hangman’s.
---
Be careful offering ID's some may class it as witch-hunting which can get you banned.   
---
Sound's like a really lame game and probably 2 people working together, so the Adam is just dropping in and out of lobbies until he is in his friends. 
---
On the contrary to popular belief small game doesnt always work since it only works within 10 meters. 
---
Source: i run it myself
---
I may be wrong about it, but I don't think the lantern bonus affects your overall game score. I always see at the end of the game gaining some extra bloodpoints for taking the lamp, but I mostly get the same score regardless if I took it or not.
---
At least for my experience it works like that David King perk that gives you extra bloodpoints at the end of the match, but doesn't increase your overall score. 
---
Lmao fuck that guy.
---
The recent change that doesn't allow survivors to see the killers loadout enforces this. I admittedly called out the killers perks to my friends when I died, but now, we find ourselves playing much more carefully. Never know if it's the Devour Hope we are looking for, or the Haunted Grounds that will fuck us over. xD
---
I have to say, i've only played 2-3 matches of LoL. i could just not bear with the fucking toxic shit the entire match my fucking god.  
---
This game has it downsides but at least it ain't during the match LOL.
---
Yes, it happened to me two games in a row last night. When in the lobby, I clicked the event emblem on the right and it was fine but then my bloodweb glitched the next round so I just ended up closing the application and restarting and it was fine the rest of the night. 
---
for addons, omegablink, ataxic resperation + catatonic boy’s treasure
---
Ye thats insane, always feels good to get some recognition in a community where I'm brand new!
---
K.
---
120 seconds? As a killer it feels like 2 hours while the gens take 2 seconds
---
People are waiting for the Blu-Ray tho.
---
I think he's talkig about the DVD/Blu-ray release.
---
Lol fr i use it bc smurfing in ovw is bad and an actual problem but i always wondered who came up w it as well lol 
---
The swf joke was ok for a little bit, then it just become a long dragging joke. He could’ve used that time to expand the huntress joke, have huntress and tapp “having a tea party” and huntress think he’s “her little friend” 
---
I agree, that would’ve made the spirit joke at least a little funny. The legion joke was funny though
---
Nice write up 👍 
---
Tbh ds is only a problem on good survivors otherwise it only adds a few seconds to the chase or if you are in the corn lol adrenaline bothers me more just because it makes the end game even easier for survivors. Get downed? No problem I’m right back up and full health running fast and if more then one person has it good luck stopping a gate from opening before you down that same person again. 
---
Noed to me is more a counter to that along with helping if you had a bad game since really noed can get you one hook and then the rest of the team could just leave because the gates will be open, you only get more kills if they come for the save 
---
When you use unbreakable but the Killer is slugging and everyone's too damn close to you.
---
"My Time has come."
---
I'm with you for the most part, i really don't care to much about dub, but i don't mind watching it with subs though. I get what you're saying though.
---
No but you have to admit that he’s good. And his addons are petty good too. But your not wrong. 
---
Captain Mangareca?
---
ptb will open 2 weeks before the chapter is released, and that is sometime in march.
---
\*Downs Bill\* 
---
\*Sees another person\*
---
I'm not stupid, this Bill is going on the Hook first!
---
When you run 4 no mither but the killer has Thanataphobia
---
also the killer will be from further back in history than any of the killers so far.
---
Jeff is just fat as shit and breaths heavily after sprinting for two seconds. Feng meanwhile cries like a baby while in dying state.
---
She also has some of the loudest totem cleansing sounds in the game.
---
Not a bad idea. That’s kind similar to what someone else was saying I think. Similar to borrowed time, but for the rescuer. 
---
Sometimes the game does not give a shit if you look up and you get blinded anyways.
---
I cannot believe we got downvoted into the negatives. This subreddit is fucking mind boggling. God forbid we just play the game?
---
Either I walk around blind or I let the person who's obviously right beside the hook get a free unhook. I'm not going to go "welp no BBQ vision time to stand right in front of this hook until this survivor dies" but I'm probably going to be roaming around the hook as opposed to going to blindly search for other Survivors.
---
I like the quality of your shitpost
---
Not gonna lie, when you get a game with a meg wearing the gray outfit and the hat with braids they’re always potatos😂
---
Fuck, thanks!
---
The only reason I use NOED on my Clown is because I just Prestiged him and am lacking any good perks. (Namely Brutal Strength.) Clown is pretty much the only killer I use NOED on now, and I often swap it out for Franklin's when I see multiple items.
---
prob a bit of both ^_^
---
For real! We're just killers being killers, so it's toxic to play the game as it was intended?
---
Thank you!
---
you don’t have to blindly search lmao. there’s generators which survivors tend to do, go to them and you’ll most likely find one instead of making the game fucking boring for the hooked survivor and yourself.
---
No problem.
---
Why do you say that?
---
Better*
---
just because there’s no other perks doesn’t mean you should/need to use it. i’ve never used noed even when it was one of the few perks that i had. it’s just a disgusting perk.
---
Lmao that killer and the edit 
---
You cannot follow people around at 92 percent speed and you know that. And no one does that. At all. Ever.
---
Oh god...
---
At the end it would nice, yes. Even as a solo survivor I would like to know (and when I die, not at the end of the match completion) 
---
I'm playing on ps4, maybe this is relevant or not, I dunno.
---
I honestly have zero problem with what you're mentioning. I started as a total newb a week ago or so and all my knowledge was based on the in game tutorial, didn't even saw a video or anything. 
---
Started as a survivor, got oblitareted for like 5 or 6 rounds, puzzled. Couldn't for the life of me properly avoiding killers, didn't know about objects function and selected almost random perks (probably started with a tricky survivor). When I first escaped I almost couldn't believe it ahah. Tried killer when I was rank 18 with survivor and had a far smoother experience. Didn't get that camping generators was useless at first, so it took a while to get decent scores, but had a pleasant experience so far. (yeah, figuring that the game is not ultimetely about escaping or getting a 4k helped me a lot into being a better player overall)
---
I maybe got the feeling that the matchmaking wasn't as fair as one could hope, but never got a negative game because of that. Playing with strongest player is useful after all.
---
I agree on the disconnect front though. Expecially survivor disconnect a lot just when they're about to get grabbed or hooked. It's a bit annoying, but you get extra point as a killer because of that. It's definitely annoying when you're a fellow survivor... 
---

People are so mad about your perks, Its not like ever used a syringe. Good on you for doing you
---
pretty ez
---
Skeleton soldier couldn't protect the dungeon, a Korean webcomic, a good read.
---
I think your last point about using countries as code names is the answer. They revealed nothing and just used it as a gauge to see the hype for a new killer. 
---
This subreddit gets worse by the day. I'm genuinely concerned that devs will act on survivor main salt
---
its coming in march, ptb will open 2 weeks before it. the killer is from furthest back in history than any of the current killers.
---
NINE NINE!
---
Of course. There are zero clips with such kills, it's all just my fantasy
---
The best survivor hands down.
---
My theory is they broke the sound on purpose to buff it considering they aren't too useful.
---
Or these devs actually don't even run a single test when reintroducing items in newer game versions and the engine update broke it, this one is more likely.
---
By the way guys, I'm a survivor main... just throwing that out there.
---
Correct.
---
This is literally the solo survivor experience
---
And let me guess: Decisive Strike is perfectly balanced because it's one time use or you can dribble or something.
---
Look: don't blame the player for a mechanic in the game. If it exists and it's the best option I have I'm going to use it. I'm not going to use fucking Fired Up or Monsterous Shrine when I have better options at my disposal.
---
Don't like NOED? Take Small Game and cleanse dull totems, or get better at stealth. Don't cry about someone picking one line of code over another.
---
Legion tho?
---
Why do survivors think the killer has a duty to let the 4th person out?
---
It affects the rank scoring. I've noticed that after my character got killed super early and I safety pipped with a bit over 6k points. 
---
never said decisive was balanced but ok
---
the only reason people ever use noed is to win, so you only play to win instead of having fun. going around the map holding e on totems isn’t fun so i’m not going to do it.
---
Wow, all these clues really add up.  
---
So the next killer will be the oldest killer by "a long shot".  Now we all know that long shots are typically used in film, and one of the most recent examples is Alfonso Curon's Roma.  Roma translates to Rome. Which points to Roman times.
---
The leaked flag was of the country Mala, Mala in Greek and Roman literature translates to "bad woman" this doesn't really point to anything.
---
HOWEVER,  the PTB could be at the end of the month, and two weeks after that would put the chapter release at the middle of March, also known as the Ides of March.  I'm pretty sure the next killer is Brutus, next survivor is Julius Caesar.  Wait, I guess Caesar didn't really survive with those 28 stab wounds.  Eh, it's good enough I guess.
---
Lmao this. Was literally gonna write the same thing.
---
But then the killer picks you up as soon as you get to 99%
---
I completely agree with DC penalties- if your internet is kicking you off more than once an hour, you shouldn’t be playing a multiplayer game. 
---
Are you on pc?
---
i played a game where there was 3 gens left, teammate just got put on their death hook and i was in a locker to avoid bbq. the second the death animation finishes, the hatch spawns directly next to my locker. i recorded it too :D
---
Damn dude I'm a nice dude when I play killer for dailies but I have low patience. I probably would have just disconnected or killed you and apologized for the game being broken shit. 5 gens is a long time to wait.
---
The game is the best map for nurse.
---
I remember playing so much call of duty in high school that I'd hear gunfights off in the distance or other things from the game lol. I feel you.
---
This would only create Lobby Simulator 2.0
---
They always do a PTB at the end of the month, they've done with Curtain Call, they did it with Shattered Bloodline and then with Darkness Among Us, I have not a single doubt in my mind that we will be getting the PTB in the last week of Feburary.
---
vessel bloodpoints aren’t capped, and it’s like 1500 for each vessel destroyed. some of it could’ve come from that.
---
If you die 80%-90% then you don't do enough generators. 
---
To not die, a team needs to do 5 generators. I escape 1/3 of my matches because I always aim to do at least 2 generators solo. So if I die 66% of the time, at rank 1 (which doesn't really mean much, its not hard to get here), I think that's fair.
---
Perhaps not the 5000 escape with vessel points. I'm talking about the 1000 pick up vessel and 500 vessel carried points.
---
Nea: "I always was."
---
Leatherface for double bp. If you don't care about bp and just want to have fun i'd recommend spirits dlc. Adams deliverance, spirit and her perks are really good.
---
Only 3-4 killers are strictly ptp and I highly doubt that this is the only reason anyone plays the game.

Pallets op please Nerf /s
---
Then do more generators.
---
Also, if you realized only yesterday that selfcare is bad, then you are not very good at playing survivor anyway. Maybe try playing games without self-care and focus on gens, you will see you will win a lot more matches.
---
Running won't help us now.
---
*we are **fucked***
---
That was a super intense game. And quite a lot of fun!
---
That salty person was just tense from all the exciting action. 
---
In the end, we all had a good time and I hope someone learned to be more constructive. maybe not that salty person, maybe someone watching...
---
You missed one of those rare opportunities to search every chest for flashlight/firecrackers to screw with the killer... But then maybe he gets out...
---
Why does everyone like dead hard tbh it’s overrated
---
Can we get this person banned ? 
---
Make your Choice is another good Perk that can go in "Other".
---
I stopped using SC.  I think this will give me more time to do gens.  But I'm still bad:. THIS IS NOT IN DISPUTE.  What bothers me is that I'm bad, dying every game, and in rank 1/2

Lol yea
---
A nightmare on elm street. Best killer in the game

Same here, chasing or getting chased in almost every dream I have. We mad?

Can we stop with the Nea is a killer meme please?

**you are already dead**

Yea, people made up rules, and if you don't fallow them you toxic... Who cares about your made up rules? I play the way I want. I wanna camp, I'm gonna camp. I want to flashlight save and teabag and use decisive strike, I will. It's in the game, and people will use everything in their power to win.

Ew, COD Ghosts Michael Myers

---
Rank is just a measure of how much you played this season. Yes, better players will rank up faster, but the ranking system doesn't really separate the great players from people who just play alot.
---
Play a survivor match and aim to do 2 gens by yourself. If your team is somewhat competent, between the 4 of you, you should be able to get 3 done together. Also, iron will is amazing.
---
As a Dwight main I resent this, but as a DBD player I understand it. 
---
Because of the setup of the game, some survivors gain a bit of a mob mentality.
---
It's easy to pick on someone when they're on their own, and you have 3 friends to back you up.
---
Here we go again, get off it, I’m done dealing with you- keep being a rude pos who can’t just admit being wrong. Acting holier than thou after trying to act as if you didn’t bring up the shit that “ derailed “ the topic.. like the comment chain is right there ... everyone can see it lmfao idk what you’re trying to accomplish.
---
Survivor: "Killer why are you committing to hatch stand off?"
---
Killer: "Why were you?"
---
Nah, Feng with turquoise hair
---
macmillan map is the best for hiding, so I love those as an immersive claudette. I prefer maps where I can use to hide a bit, as I don't like to loop killers - I prefer to just lose them quickly and hop on a gen. 
---
meat factory is the worst (most annoying for me, rather), cause not many places to hide. and it's hard to know if the killer is on the same floor or above. And playing against the Doctor is a nightmare...
---
every other map is really about preferences. 
---
It's when I safety pipped with a ridiculously low amount of points I've realized how much impact the lanterns have on easy rank up for survivor. The event is almost over so there's no point getting to the bottom of this. The thing that's certain is there's currently a lot of boosted survivors in the high ranks. You can be in the red ranks and still get a survivor that runs in a straight line or gets downed under a pallet and crawls out of it as I'm about to pick them up making it impossible for their team mates to pallet stun save them (it was a rank 6 survivor that did that in a match I played today, by the way).
---
I run iron will, adrenaline, empathy, dead hard
---
Some maps are more favored for killers like Gideon, Macmillan Estate, or Lery’s. 
---
The stronger survivor maps are Pale Rose, Haddonfield, Springwood And Yamoka Estate. 
---
That’s all based off escape rates/kill rates. 
---
I would usually run Ruin, Barbecue, Monitor and Abuse, and the last one is difficult.
---
You can use Stridor / Sloppy Butcher / Bloodhound 
---
The second stays up, but it becomes a dull totem.
---
the cornfield maps and swamp are some of the hardest for me as killer - due to visibility. everything else I'm totally fine with. 
---
If you’re blinded you drop the guy on your shoulder, what are you on about? If you can move your head up that means you’re vulnerable to being blinded and dropping the survivor. The point of my original comment is that looking up is inconsistent and can sometimes not prevent blinds. 
---
I doubt it, he was being very dickish during the match.
---
I've got this problem where I keep accidentally clicking the right mouse button, basically making flashlights and especially firecrackers unusable for me because they'll activate at the worst moments. I'm not sure if this is an issue with my mouse or my controls or what, since I changed my run key to the middle mouse button, and that's often when I accidentally right click. Should I get a new mouse with more buttons on it or something? 
---
who do you have - and who do you not have? 
---
without knowing, I'd say Spirit. She's pretty fun to play as - and is good at chases and mind games. 
---
Which ones do you not have? 
---
You can on rank reset. Not for long, though.
---
Entitlement. 
---
Found the guy who plays as only killer 
---
Killers who kill survivors are rude AF. Give survivors guns!!!! &lt;/s&gt;
---
As Nurse, can you blink and do a locker check before fatigue? 
---
No sense of humor at all. Snowflake.
---
Yeah, because killer main streamers never derank.
---
Ha!
---
\*sees Doctor in title\* 
---
\*Sees 3 Gen Strategy mentioned as banable\*
---
It is not banable and you're doing Doctor's Work. 
---
I'm a Doctor main and Pallet Town Map sucks!
---
Do you know how many times I have had chases lasting 40-60 seconds after I hit the DS?  DS at the hands of a good survivor is lethal. Considering that the killer doesn't have tier 3 enduring.
---
BBQ&amp;Chilli is probably the best perk as finding survivors, especially on Billy/Huntress.  
---
Make your choice, Brutal Strength, Whispers and Save the best for last are too great to not be listed.
---
Is body blocking as the killer on the basement steps considered an exploit in the sense of no counter play or do we just chalk that up to "that's why you dont want to be hooked in the basement?" 
---
In my defense, all the survivors were alive and the gates were open.
---
A pallet stun is 1000 points. A chase is 1000-2000 I guess? Let's say I managed to fix a bit of a gen (1000 pts), cleansed a totem (600 pts), 2x pallet dropped on killer (2000 pts), downed (1000 chase points), and you already have almost 5k points.
---
Yeah. They are drastically different. DS is an unfun perk that affects the killer for 1-2 minutes, but camping is an even more unfun playstyle that affects survivors the whole match
---
Most of the other folders are named after characters and have their store cosmetics in them. Huntress, Ace and Feng have their Lunar New Year 2019 cosmetics in their own folders. Last year's LNY event's contents is in a folder simply named LunarEvent.
---
No. You either attack/grab, make another blink (if you have any left) or enter fatigue.
---
Call the police and tell everyone freddys back
---
cause U ded 
---
If you expect Survivor mains to not be hypocrites, you're overestimating them, drastically.
---
HALLELUJAH 
---
I didnt say that this guy called Camping toxic....learn to read dude.
---
I wrote its often considered toxic
---
Yeah, i'm the immature one here. Keep telling yourself that. It won't make it true though.
---
You'll get shit for using NOED on anyone.
---
How do survivors moonwalk out of the exit gate? I've tried myself but keep turning in the direction I'm moving
---
i saw you delete your comment, buddy. maybe you should proofread your shit.
---
More like No Mither with Object of Obsession
---
if its the end of the game, what else would he do there m8?
---
I don’t understand how Freddy’s a bad killer
---
Bloodhound, BBQ, Ruin, Franklin's. I occasionally switch out Franklin's for Sloppy or Thana.
---
read my new response. mixed that up
---
Ruin-Franklins Demise-Bbq-Thana
---
          Sloppy
---
why don't you post your old comment, "m8"?
---
cause I made a mistake and deleted it?
---
But feel free to answer my question 
---
Quentin, as he is more or less an unimportant character in the movie until Freddy focuses on him.
---
His ability doesn't help him in chases and only cripples him. That's how.
---
okay, then read the response i just posted, i just answered it.
---
"When Self Care is used in Tier 3 and is successful, Self Care becomes Instant Heal for 60 seconds".

&lt;333
---
No you didnt. 
---
What else should he do with both gates opened?
---
Original art by Randowis.
---
Both op and the other made a point, camping and boring and so is decisive. Neither were toxic to each other but shit kids these days think looking in their direction is toxic
---
**Ormond**
---
All around terrible killer map. Frame rate issues. Lots of structures with great loops and lots of pallets. Pretty large map. The resort in the middle is great for Balanced Landing and has tons of hiding spots. 
---
**Yamaoka**
---
A lot of killers dislike it because of the reeds everywhere, but it's not too large, the gen placement is easy to control, and there are not many pallets. You get stuck on shit a lot tho
---
**Springwood**
---
Not a great killer map, but not as bad as it once was. Hook spawns are sub par and it has some really long, annoying walls that you don't always expect. Gen spawns are fairly easy to control tho. The school is great for survivor loops. Has an annoying house or two to deal with including a house basement
---
**Red Forest**
---
Pretty well balanced imo. Large map but the gens are not too hard to control. Has some frame rate issues. Has a lot of good spots for Balanced Landing and the house is good for looping, but the loops are not that bad to deal with otherwise. Good for killers that throw stuff because of the hills as well
---
**Lery's**
---
Best map ever. Just loads of fun on both sides. Tons of juking and mind game potential. Gens can be hard to find for survivors though. Not many pallets. Bad for some killers like Billy and Huntress
---
**Backwater Swamp**
---
Two different maps here: Pale Rose and Grim Pantry.
---
Swamp tends to be popular with survivors because of all the debris and foliage. Has some frame rate issues
---
Pale Rose has a lot more foliage in it, but it's more free of debris and junk than Grim Pantry. The ship is a decent looping spot for survivors but not great, and you can usually count on finding a survivor working on a gen on the ship. There's also this little boat with a gen on it that's petty easy to catch people out on. Then there are two other structures that are quite good for looping on opposite sides of the map. Gen control ability is meh
---
Grim Pantry has some good spots for Balanced Landing and the main tunnel like structure is a nightmare to chase survivors in and finding a hook is kind of difficult if you down someone in there. It has two good looping structures kind of similar to Pale Rose. Lack of foliage and it's easy to catch people in the center of the map if they go there.
---
Swamp tends to have better totem spawns than other maps
---
**Haddonfield**
---
Worst killer map. Just garbage. Balanced Landing city, tons of hiding spots and two story houses. Not a lot of pallets but the routes are extremely survivor sided. Really hard to control gens, but hook spawns are good. Trapper and Hag can do pretty well here tho and Huntress can get great throws if the player is good
---
**Crotus Prenn Asylum**
---
Two maps here: Disturbed Ward and Father Campbell's Chapel
---
Both large with spread out gens, but they're moderately easy to control. But if survivors do the gens intelligently, big oof for you
---
The main structures in both are okay for survivor looping, with Disturbed Ward being better. The Ward has a number of good pallets inside it and the Chapel is easy to cut people off in.
---
They both have a good number of standard looping structures, but none are particularly difficult to run
---
**Coldwind Farm**
---
Bad killer maps, but not as terrible as Haddonfield because the gen spawns are better and there tends to be more open space. Most frame rate issues of any map. Some survivor cosmetics just disappear in corn and with scratch marks still being wonky they can lose you easily
---
The tiles are see through so killers lose a lot of ability to mind game structures.
---
There are 5 Farm maps: Fractured Cowshed, Thompson House, Torment Creek, Rancid Abattoir, and Rotten Fields.
---
Cowshed and Fields are the only ones that are truly difficult. 
---
Cowshed: Lots of corn, lots of pallets, the Cow Tree Loop is right in the corn. 
---
Fields has so much corn. Just everywhere. It's easy to get lost in it. If you break a pallet at one of the loop structures at the map edges they can take off and disappear. But if you find them in the corn and are patient, you can down them because it's so open.
---
I can explain the other 3 maps there more later, and I'll get to the other two realms later as well. Sorry I had to stop  
---
i literally said im not talking about the fucking gates, smart one, and you chastise me for being unable to read
---
I dont know if making Franks baseline is the best counterbuff to making the power end on hit. But I think that change, with an apropitiate buff to some other element of his kit, would be a good direction. 
---
Lmaoo
---
i completely agree, everyone thinks everything is toxic. i wish the community wasn't this way, but i guess people don't like losing
---
This speaks to my survivor soul 
---
I remember seeing one on tumblr and it said "you're hotter than the fire that killed me"
---
Yeah, it helped me a lot after I saw someone suggest it. It's essentially impossible to track them when they get close to you or 360 otherwise
---
You like jazz?
---
Forgot that ! Will edit it right away, thank you sir
---
Alright, thanks.
---
this discusion is running into a deadend.
---
the Core(at least from my perspective) was that Camping while both gates are powered? That question is still unanswered
---
360? I think the ps2 crows have gotten stronger and have begun to infect more textured surfaces.
---
Let Jesus-Jeff into your heart, he is the one who shows us the path to the light 🙏
---
I think it depends partially on the killers ability to see the survivors in the bamboo
---
Kind of. I also think it's funny to get them to waste time on nothing
---
Anyone who takes the game atleast slightly seriously. It's not hard to be a decent-good survivor in this game. I am not even talking about the really good ones who know to loop really well like Noob3 and Puppers. 
---
Horrible... imagine trying to stab someone that looks like they’re teleporting 
---
I would just like to point out how painful mountain dew is when it spews from your nose.
---
no, i said complaining about DS is immature. how do you manage to get everything wrong?
---
I never said that. But don't sit there and act like this wasn't a big fad among survivor streamers in a way it wasn't with killers. That's so disingenuous 
---
Look it up
---
Another killer main who thinks he’s hot shit for playing killer
---
I don’t use NOED because it’s a cheap crutch just like how I don’t use DS or insta heal as survivor because it’s a cheap crutch. I don’t even use items as survivor because I consider it a bit unfair unless I get a non add on item from a chest. And I don’t think dead hard and self care are crutches. Dead hard is predictable after a person fools you with it once and self care wastes the persons time even more
---

---
OP, how dumb must you be to mean that DS and camping are the same thing. You must be one of those noob killers who resort to camping because let's make it clear, you ain't getting kills any other way, haha.
---
Legion is quite strong in fact. You can't hide from Legion and pallets and windows are useless against them so there is actually no way to counter Legion and Frank's mix tape is currently the most broken killer add-on in my opinion. Also, if they tunnel someone, it's a guaranteed down, unlike other killers who can be looped for 5 gens.
---
pocket dimension time
---
You sir are the problem. Leave the lanterns until the end. Otherwise they get wrecked.
---
If they are allowed to complain about camping, why can’t I complain about DS?
---
I was thinking earlier that ds is most scary for people like noob3 and monto and people like that. But from all the hours I've played survivor, it's usually a waste of a perk slot for the people I've played with
---
To moonwalk, the the camera so you see your character’s face. Then you hold Shift (or whatever your sprint button is) and then hold W. Immediately after holding W, mash A and D rapidly to maintain your character facing the camera. Use A and D to correct your character so it doesn’t flip around
---
complaining about DS and then proceeding to facecamp.
---
Which he didnt mentioned at all....he only said he Camped after both gates were powered and where die he complain? he just responded in the way the Survivor complained about him 
---
5 Blink Nurse vs 310% Speed Billy
---
As a survivor main, I still believe that the killer should win hatch standoff. It’s the game of whoever finds it first.
---
Damn, another Killer that is a pain to play on xbox.
---
&gt;  ffs all of them made a 3 hour video defending it!
---
If you're talking about Tofu's stream, then there were at least 2 killer mains (I don't watch Tofu enough to know of he's killer or survivor main)
---
And even some of my favorite killer mains deranked on purpose (like ending stream at rank 5 and starting next at 10).
---
He camped after the gates were open. What was he supposed to do at that point?
---
Boldness: Plus Ultra
---
okay bub
---
Oh sorry I didn't know Billy's addon but I looked it up and now im scared lol
---
I feel attacked.
---
he said "you made the game not fun by using decisive strike", can you read?
---
Just keep clicking that downvote button. You sure do like that a lot.
---
wah downvotes
---
OP is lucky, best to not sleep anymore 
---
If he body blocks and forces you to DC, that’s reportable. If he just kills you, it’s tactics.
---
*nnnnnyyyyooooooooommm*
---
Oh please no; not until they fix the framerate on consoles.
---
Sure Nurse is hard on console, but Legion would be unplayable like this given how the game turns into a slideshow when you activate Feral Frenzy.
---
IF that's fixed I wouldn't mind having the power end on a miss, but Frank's should not be made baseline because there's still no counterplay.
---
You mention it'll have the same counterplay as chainsaw charges and blinks, but neither of those are like Feral Frenzy or this change to Feral Frenzy. Blinks require the Nurse to outhink her opponent (and if she can and has three or more blinks there is no counterplay). Chainsaws require time to charge and steering to connect. Feral Frenzy just makes the Killer go fast. 
---
The only thing changing with this is that the Legion is punished for missing. That's not counterplay; that's making the Killer harder to play (that's not necessarily a bad thing; since Feral Frenzy is stupidly easy to use).
---
&gt;420
---
Wow this guy smokes no wonder he is so hard
---
It's fine if you are running the Xbox One X and have a good TV or monitor.
---
.....
---
the Survivor started the conversation. okay?
---
He complained about being Camped. okay?
---
The Killer responded in the same manner, most likely as a joke.
---
No, it's against their made up rules. Do what you want, aside from cheating/hacking.
---
The fps is fine on xbox. I have an s and an original with no issues.
---
Sure, Premonition is better at telling you the Killer is in a certain direction, but it doesn’t tell you the Killer is coming towards you. Premonition has a huge range, the Killer could simply be walking past. It also has a cooldown. Spine Chill has no cooldown and only activated when the Killer is 100% coming for you. 
---
Actually it could of been a swf group timing an unbreakable get up with a gen or the guy got lucky idk lol 
---
Look down before you swing, too
---
Premonition &gt; Spine Chill. 
---
Any day. 
---
Also, it’s not an aura reading perk. 
---
Also also, T1 Myers trumps ALL detection perks, yes even spine chill. (Check the Trivia on the Spine Chill wiki page)
---
You need to do more research before you post again, kid. 
---
Here we see a Meg in is nat- OH FUCK SHIT IT'S A MIRROR MYERS WHAT THE FUCK HOW DID THAT HIT ME FUCK THIS GAME *DC*
---
I don't think it could work.
---
Wraith is secretly cloaked with double windstorm and PWYF
---
It's the best trapper map. Any other killer not so much. Claudettes are super hard to see in this map.
---
Ok?
---
i just give the last survivor the hatch, i’d rather get on to another game
---
Still doesn’t tell you the direction the killer is coming from, which could be hell if your are inside, playing in the Game, or surrounded in any way. In which case, you’ve still got eyes if you’re out in the open. 
---
I don't care about hatch standoffs because as a survivor, I just go for a generator and start repairing it. When/if the killer comes for me, I run some loops and then head for the hatch. If he tries to standoff again, rinse and repeat. Doesn't always work, but I get more BP/emblems and that's all that really matters.
---
I definitely don't ever expect the killer to give me the hatch because "I deserve it".
---
But he did that to make a point about the other person's silly logic 
---
I mean it still heals them one health state, so they would still "pop up sprinting" if they were downed when adrenaline triggered. They would just not be at full health. Hopefully I'm understanding your question and making sense.
---
Maybe earlier in development and at release the fog was thicker, thus making totems and chests harder to see? Thats all I can think of.
---
Its playable, except on ormond.
---
Removed - No salty messages
---
is that an SCP?
---
bet
---
if someone can explain to my technologically illiterate ass how to record on PS4 with audio recording I'll go ahead and do it this weekend 
---
That still doesn’t help the current situation. The fact remains that it’s not something survivors need, but we’re still forced to spend BP on if it’s the only path to something we need. 
---
I do disagree with OP’s post, but you’re really coming off as an asshole, which was completely unnecessary. 
---
Also, you are wrong about T1 Myers. Spine Chill does not detect that. 
---
I think that happens if the blind goes off while you're still in the pickup animation. You'll be blinded, but you won't drop. Same thing happens if you're blinded in hook animation, the drop won't override a different animation so you're both blinded and carrying someone.
---
Most games even at Rank 1 are casual. A DS giving the survivors a minute of time advantage means jack shit if they already waste five times as much through other means. It's like having 4 Blinks/Omegablink on a nurse that plays like shit. The tool can be as overpowered as it wants, how the player uses it determines how effective it will be.
---
I slipped on the T1 Myers, but the other ones are true. Which includes M&amp;A T2 Myers.
---
Premonition is discount Spine Chill. It pops off if the Killer looks at you and then goes other way, and because of the cooldown you think he is coming and you waste your time, ultimately mindgaming yourself. And also you are left with one perk less for the duration of the cooldown.
---
This doesn't happen with Spine Chill. By how it pops you know if the killer looked at you and went the other way, if he is patrolling the area or if he is going straight where you are.
---
Premonition is for people that don't know how to use Spine Chill, which is fine. And I know because I was one of those people.
---
Yea you’re good I understand. I was just saying I swear people have popped up fully healed not in injured like it normally does so I was wondering if there is a perk combo that does that. After thinking about it I think I just got hit with the unbreakable get up into adrenaline pop at the same time which instantly healed them
---
That is dedication. I managed 6 coins as survivor only, with maybe 6 games of Kill Your friends mixed in. That was roughly 45 hours of play to get. Do you have a time estimate on how long it took you to get that?
---
I just wait for a bit. They do few turns, when runs straight, this is when you strike. Just don't be trigger happy.
---
You are directly on top of it
---
I use it if i get a p3 claudette in my lobby. I wont let her hide. Shes forced to do gens
---
I made a mistake and fixed it giving you credit, but my point remains the same. You didn't address the fact that the cooldown of Premonition makes it very unreliable compared to Spine Chill. You also didn't address the point I made about how to read Spine Chill. And you didn't address the fact that the reason everybody runs Spine Chill is not the bonus.
---
Yes, the bonus of Spine Chill is useless, but that's not what you say in your post. You say the whole perk is useless. Which I think is obviously wrong because that's not the reason anyone runs it.
---
You get personal very quickly, not somebody I would like to have a discussion with if that's how you go it. I'm not interested in you or me, I'm interested in the issue discussed.
---
Yeah, DbD trumps LoL easily in regards to toxic behaviour. Could have to do with League of Legends actually banning you somewhat more reliably than DbD for being a complete ass. Both games have their toxic cultures. L9, old tyler1 and more for League and stuff like Ochido and more for DbD. Having played both games, never went people as much out of their way to insult, flame and hurt others as in DbD. 
---
Haha I didnt end up getting the last one. I just thought that was funny
---
lmao
---
i like ur name uwu
---
OoO players like me intensifies
---
i have never played this game, but i always enjoy reading memes from a really specific community and trying to figure out what the terms mean. its a fun look into the nickname culture of certain groups
---
Ends at UTC 19:00, which is 11am PST.
---
once i had 1 hooked person and it was a whole team trying to save them with flash lights, fire crackers, baiting, etc, next to the exit as it was open. Ended up trying too hard to save 1 person and they all got hooked at the end, one of them almost crawled out too
---
You’re gonna have to start chasing and hitting someone eventually. And when you’re occupied with one survivor, then everyone else will just fail a single skillcheck and then they’re out of the dream. At that point they will proceed to rush the gens against Freddy. Its just too easy to get out of the dream state.
---
Then you can't run Dead Hard or Resilience with No Mither. Your change makes this perk even worse.
---
What happened to his other eyebrow though
---
It IS the end. He's escaping, plus NOED is up. 
---
Legion
---
Yeah legion is strong and unbalanced, most legion mains are mentally handicapped though. So it balances out
---
Yeah, “specific direction” was definitely poor phrasing.  I’ll change it to “coming specifically towards you.” 
---
Sure, Spine Chill won’t be useful in every area on every map, but it’s definitely more often useful than not.  Lery’s and The Game are definitely weak maps for it, I think it holds up rather well on most other maps though. On other maps, with most generators, there are going to be one or two clear directions of approach so it should be pretty easy to figure out the direction of the Killer. For other generators that aren’t as cordoned off, there’s usually a better line of sight anyways. For generators like that, neither Premonition or Spine Chill are that useful. 
---
Oh no, I get you 100% on that one. When I play killer I sometimes let them have it, but when I feel like it. Not because anyone "deserves" it. I definitely wouldn't give hatch to a deadweight.
---
I was just saying why as a survivor I would just avoid the standoff to begin with.
---
r\rule34. Lots and lots of r\rule34
---
Everyone who says they played LoL for 5 games and quit really don't get the idea of what toxic LoL is. The people you are playing with are most likely smurfs that got banned off their main for being toxic so they don't care about those accounts. Mix this in with people that just don't care about the game and leave on a whim and early leveling in LoL becomes terrible. Later on the toxicity is more spread out and you only see a monster of a human being every so often but they don't last as long as they used to anymore.

Killer
---
Hide in lockers or hide behind a gen (not that reliable anymore but it can work) or get in range (Hear the terror radius? You're good to go) or fake your direction (During BBQ you walk one way but actually go the other way) or just let it happen since someone needs to get chased/shown or the killer has no incentive to leave the hook (if everyone hides, killer might think they're all near hook).
---
Spine chill also increases vault speed along with resilience which can be a pretty interesting combo 
---
I’m okay with map offering tbh. But trading in for shards or 50% BP would be nice. 
---
Some people messing around and having fun in a game is cringe now?
---
No, I’m pretty sure they’re randomly generated for each person. You can get daily’s for dlc characters, so not everyone can do those...
---
Not with all that foliage it isn't.
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
I know how to loop and when I use that combo is for gen jockey purposes, so I'm the guy that pops 2 gens in your chase and tries to get the team to not 3 gen themselves. Usually those immersed killing machines don't have either perks. 
---
Crawldettes with Urban have killed more survivors than moris and NOED put together.
---
you’re an absolute legend, that window juke at the cow tree was godlike. i luv u.
---
Instant karma
---
Well it sounds like you get it but the typical immeserd do nothing and I mean NOTHING team killer build is Urban with Premonition 
---
The worst is when teammates commit to a generator with ruin active. I died on first hook because they all committed to a generator with ruin still up. The best part: all of them ran borrowed time.
---
i’d main a speedo dwight 100%. 🥵
---
Was it against a Huntress? If so it probably was.
---
Blocked all the way to the lamp then she started winding up her hatchet and I basically went "Fuck no, I ain't dying for this" and peaced out lol.
---
It's the other way around for me
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: Once a survivor enters the struggle state on a hook, if they are not rescued within the time it takes to gather 300-400 survival points, the "A button" prompt for the quick-time event will briefly disappear and the survivor will die. The majority of times this happens around the 353-371 survival points range.
---
Screenshot/Video: N/A
---
Steps to reproduce: Get hooked twice and wait to be saved until the 300-400 survival point time.
---
Expected Result: Player would survive and still be able to be rescued from the hook.
---
Actual Result: Player dies on hook even though they are clicking the "A" button for the quick-time event.
---
Reproduction Rate: I have now had this occur successfully 11 times in a row.
---
You sound triggered
---
This is GENIUS.  I fucking loathe immersed Crawldettes.  On going to start doing this.
---
Is this Dead by Daylight, or the Sims 2 on low quality?
---
In all seriousness, Keys are apparently only for people with functioning legs.
---
You need to study sociology
---
I just got my last one.
---
Honestly I usually make sure I down the person who got unhooked, but leave them there and chase the idiot. Denies the safe unhook points, hurts their medals, and hopefully someone heals the downed person while I’m chasing the other one.
---
Yeah that's definitely true. I'm just not sure what perk to swap out for it, because I really like my current Hexes. I do feel like having Ruin with those two Hexes will be really nice, but I dunno. It takes so long to get shards for me, I'm just worried another perk I want will pop up and I won't have shards or the time to grind them out... But I think I will get Ruin now that I'm thinking more about it. Thanks
---
Wtf, I can't believe that there are people saying that this isn't holding the game hostage lol. It's extremely hard to find a survivor without whispers, they can literally just hide in a good spot and stay there forever, making minimal movements when they see that the killer is near. Doing this is completely against the concept of the game and just makes the killer and the survivor waste time when they should be having fun.
---
It's the same as body blocking a survivor as a killer for a really long time. There is nothing you can do and you are ruining the experience. Both actions should be banable. 
---
I love Kaye taunting Meg.
---
What I want to know is the specifics of when my aura disappears.  Does my aura fade as soon as I interact with the locker?  Or does it go away once I'm still and in place after the doors are closed?
---
It affects all actions. They’ve said it in a dev stream and i and many others have tested to see if it truly works. Give it a try for yourself before simply saying someone is wrong. 
---
Jeff is louder than Feng. It's not even a debate. But Feng  the loudest when cleansing totems.
---
No mither just needs to be 100% silent with a BP boost, it honestly shocks me that its not silent. I like to run it all the time But im not wasting a perk slot on Iron will Bc if you are running NO mither you need your fucking perk slots
---
They are still working on the matchmaking update chill the fuck out
---
It's interesting honestly that because of two people we now have the term smurf
---
Why did you post this 3 times lol
---
It’s IN the perk description as to what it does increase. 
---
What, were you sitting there with a timer to see if your vault speed was 6% less when the killer was looking at you? I doubt it, as it would make a fraction of a difference anyway. 
---
you could change the use item button to a key on your keyboard, maybe swap it with space for skill checks on RMB?
---
That's why I main him &lt;3
---
So let’s see here, no, no anddddd no. 
---
Admit being wrong on what? That dribbling doesn't counter DS well? How so?
---
It took me a minute to realize that those were all barbies and not women with an over-sized super statue.
---
try playing killer sometimes and see all the obvious hits that somehow miss. Or the hatchets that fly through people's bodies 
---
I am normally a rank 1 survivor, But i had to force de rank during this  event. The amount of DCs at rank 1 is fucking insane. i played for around 3 hours with a friend and not a single game went by were Someone DCs before the first gen is popped
---
Damn..how intense are the chases? I would love to get chased in my dreams.
---
Is this your own personal list? Like tier list of killers that you're good with? Because spirit is A tier at least, so that makes sense why she's a question mark for you. Doctor's power only stops loops if the survivor fucks up and tries to vault/throw down a pallet knowing the doctor is about to zap. If the survivor is just paying attentino, they won't get stopped. Stealth isn't what loses you games as a killer. Leatherface above Wraith? I'd like to know why. Not that wraith is amazing, he's pretty middle of the pack, but Leatherface shouldn't be in B tier. He is an m1 killer, and it's pretty hard to get even decent survivors with his chainsaw. If there's no D tier, I think pig belongs in C. And yeah, legion is just annoying; I'd leave it as a question mark, too. Nice list.
---
All might in his weakened form does not have eye brows 
---
^(dat ass)
---
Legion just fucking books it at 132%
---
+ruin +huntress Lullaby at the swamp, well i guess nothing is going to get done today
---
Youre being a child yes.
---
2000 hours to get 2 kills with wraith 
---
I’m cry laughing and I play claudette all the time 😂
---
I can tell you his shoe size is tiny though 
---
The house at the end of the street (far right if youre standing in the strode house) on Haddonfield does it too.
---
Is this some canon love triangle? I hope so. 
---
Use it with haunted ground.
---
I only got the 8 coins myself but I'm cool with that.  I hate Aces new shirt anyways.  He looks like the only member of the Lonely Hearts Club Band that wasn't good enough to make the album art.
---
Yeah, they were going to release it with Legion but when they did more tests they found a lot of things that was unacceptable to them so all that's being done right now is polishing the system so just be patient
---
Amazing as always ... this art is something that should be getting recognition from devs
---
Also they barely mentioned this new matchmaking system 2 months ago. Whole year my ass
---
How many hours in OP
---
You’re the one not helping your case, it’s called busting each other’s balls man! You never seen a practical joke and thought it was funny those are worse than a bit of harmless namecalling. Seriously how old are you, your logic seems at par with someone in their teens, or that of a pretentious douche sitting on a high horse soaring above all of humanity Jesus Christ dude. 
---
Because with Freddy you not only need to constantly pull them in the dream world, his ability doesn't help in the chase in any way.
---
Honestly, I am starting to think that killers get higher rarity items more often than survivors. Would make sense for the devs to do that since they are always used up for killers but only used up around 50% of the time for survivors. 
---
What don't you like?
---
I don't get why ppl cleanse a hex totems if there is no ruin yes maybe it might be devour hope but it will be smart to wait and see instead of getting exposed for the whole team
---
Well, it's a list based on my personal experience really.
---
Premonition is on cd the whole freakin time, it goes of every time the killer is walking across the map.
---
Good survivors know where the killer is anyways so no use for a perk that tells you what you already know.
---
One of my friends mains Claudette, has never changed her build since August, only plays as an immersed baby and actually complains when people do the literal same things she does and I’m constantly like......the irony. 😂😂😂😂
---
even better yet, you realize 3 gen lock downs are ALWAYS the fault of the survivors right?
---
When you understand everything without subtitles. Swenglish on point 😂 10/10 redigering. 
---
Hey, i know that show!
---
Gotta get that 1k bloodpoints
---
Pig B tier, doc B tier at highest, Spirit A tier, leatherface C tier
---
Good point.
---
I love this. Save yourselves!
---
Never understood why people get so angry at someone patrolling after the exit gates are open, there is literally only one thing left to do in the game.
---
Bold of you to assume Herman can't beat Phillip's ass
---
To start, billy is not nurse tier. Bump him down.
---
Hag and huntress should both be a tier above clown so drop clown a rank and doctor should not be in a class as he can not compete with huntress, hag, or even clown. He should be at best B rank.
---
Bubba is arguably the second worst killer in the game and does not belong in b tier. 
---
Pig and wraith should be moved up to B.
---
Spirit should be in either s or a tier and legion could be c tier or f tier depending on your feelings towards it.
---
I take them on a case-by-case basis. 
---
Not everyone is worth going back for. 
---
this is literally just metal gear
---
*"Camo pattern designed with hunters in mind. Pasted with photos of tree trunks and leafy branches. Effective when pressed against trees."*
---
you have to be fully inside with the door closed. If you're in the animation you're still visible and they know you are currently in the locker.
---
Yea people tend to think there isn’t two sides to the struggle
---
This is why Claudettes get mori’d
---
It's a tight race between Billy and Nurse, no one quite sure who would win... but then it turns out the Hag set a trap at the finish line and so nabs it from beneath their nose.
---
Its 3 different ones
---
I never made the claim that it was a decent boost you fucking twat monkey. You are putting words in my mouth to make your, “argument,” seem at all valid. 
---
As said before, you are a complete waste of my time. That said I’m done here. Enjoy running premonition over spine chill as all rank 20’s do since others opinions clearly mean nothing to you. 
---
This is me but with Legion after playing Amanda. 
---
if you hear the whoosh sound then sprint away for a few seconds then just walk and dip behind something to lose her 
---
When she stands still you start walking to either get distance if she tries to mindgame or avoid her if she phases 
---
Learn to format.
---
Clown can stop loops better than huntress, I've noticed a lot recently that a ton of obstacles are too high to hit a survivor over them not only that but I've watched people duck under any obstacles low enough to have hatchets clear. Clown is an easy A tier imo and that's the thing tier list are completely opinions, just like the difference between console and PC tier list are different. Nurse on console is worse than freddy because of the nasty frame drops, billy is useable but not like on PC making him at best b tier again (my opinions based on the version I play)
---
What about premonition though?
---
This is nonsense. So nobody can loop in your games?
---
Lmfao eyyyyyy!!! That was a diamond in the ruff back in the N64 days, love me some Buck ❤️🐝
---
That's why you don't use it on Bill
---
S - Nurse and Spirit
---
A/S - Hag 
---
A - Legion (trash but can't lose a chase)
---
A/B - Billy, Huntress (depend on map heavily)
---
B - Doc, Trapper, Wraith
---
C - everything else, they don't have tools that directly help the chase
---
S: Nurse
---
A: Hillbilly, Spirit, How
---
B: Hag, Myers, Clown
---
C: Leatherface, Trapper, Wraith, Pig, Doctor
---
D: Legion, Freddy
---
This is my opinion on the tier list. I'd say that the Hag could even be up at A and clown can be C but it's mostly accurate imo. 
---
No that’s with BBQ and Chili for sure. And some puddings//streamers here and there. 
---
If you add two more letters mala becomes malaka which means wanker so maybe the new killer jerks off. Adds up with the &lt;&lt;by a long shot&gt;&gt;.
---
Yep. Every time I use insta hatchets I get DCs. Cowards!
---
Also a Doc main the shock is insanely niche as most vaults/pallets are too safe if your survs have a normal number of chromosomes
---
Am I crazy or is the clown's hand reversed?
---
There are some other windows that are also bugged
---
Oh hai SCP-106
---
Besides the meme they are incredibly bad on their own and even worse combined since they make steering incredibly hard so unless you're out in the open like rottenfields where you have no structures you'll stop more often than you would normally gaining less distance because you'll have to stop more often. Also the charge time.... yeah
---
He was bad and didn't understand what was going on. Some survivors are like that and there is some cross over with toxic people. Just move on and don't let it get you down. 
---
Actually with this recent buff I consistently get more on killer.
---
I'd rather have them destroy the gen than urban evade in a corner, better to try than to be a completely useless shitstain on purpose.
---
I know hillbilly can go up to 310% with his engraving addons, but I am really wondering how fast spirit would be with her mother-doughter ring and with her Yakuyoke Amulet. Does she have the potential to go fatser than hillbilly?
---
Got a 3k my first nurse game on console at rank 8. She's really not that bad. Learn how to blink and just end the chase quick to avoid losing them.
---
Legion is definitely A or higher like it or not. He has no counterplay.
---
Play Old School Runecape.
---
&gt;purple Flashlights
---
To this day I don't understand why the color matters, it's functionally the same as yellow or green, and flashlights only do something if the killer makes a terrible play.
---
Mint Rag for the win
---
Idk I generally don't die to legion unless he runs Franks mixtape. Just stand at a pallet when he chases you and let him stab you and get a free stun on him and run away. He won't be able to see where you ran and it'll end his frenzy. 
---
Playing without Dooms feels like ass tho
---
I heard he was a really toxic player but I got into watching him somewhat recently and he seems fine to me. Maybe he was toxic as hell in the past so that could be why.
---
If he has bloodhound he can just stare at the ground and follow it until you die. So broken.
---
You can read my discussion with OP (at least I tried) on the replies to my comment, I explain why Spine Chill is better, but tl;dr: spine chill doesn't have a cooldown, so you get information in real time while with Premonition you get information one time and then you're basically left blind till tje cooldown ends. If it pops and the killer decides to turn the other way you don't know.

They’ve been talking about fixing the matchmaking for over a year and have said numerous times that they are working on it. It’s been well over a year, you simply missed the previous times it was mentioned.

Billy is for sure above hag, hag is amazing but she is not at the same level as billy if we are talking about potential. 
---
Does botany knowledge affect the rate in which you heal yourself with self care?? Or is it only when healing others?
---
You can free the killer *usually* by slow vaulting while injured. Ideally he grabs you and the animation teleports them out.
---
The downside is now you're on the killer's shoulder and they might not know you let them out on purpose...or might not care...
---
The problem with ranking legion is while he is uncounterable, he can not consistently get more than two kills against good survivors. He will almost always get two kills but anything more than that is a challenge without franks. 
---
I think I was kind of same around that time ... these days I am between fuck it and well maybe game or two
---
meg mains as is
---
It’s funny haha
---
I can't believe you found a photo of me.
---
No one left behind! Fly my pebble! 
---
The problem is that survivors experience significantly more bullshit from said struggle than killers do. While phantom hits do occur for killer, it is much more common for a survivor to get hit by something they shouldn’t than for a killer to miss something they shouldn’t. 
---
You’re*
---
But.... if you get hit unfairly that is directly affecting the chase. 
---
:(
---
Aight.

Yea, it just does not bother me much, the only time it does is when I use dead hard and I go down with exhaustion

LoL is still the largest E sport, by far. As for popularity,  it is still the most viewed game on Twitch some days, although Fortnight does beat it out pretty regularly.
---
I feel you. Some killers just get toxic over the wrong stuff but it seems like these survivors were actually toxic. Especially complaining in the post game chat about camping.
---
oof
---
\*sees red lamp
---
# PRETTY SURE THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE
---
So you camped and wondered why the people you camped were toxic?
---
So far 10/10
---
Not at all, i know exactly why they were toxic. But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I want to rank up just as much as anyone else, i've only played the game for around 200 hours and SWF bringing a rank 2 into the game aint that fun. 
---
Been bugged for awhile, I quit using it because of this. On PS4
---
every single flashlight is 1.33 seconds, this speed cannot be altered. 
---
I got face-camped at Springwood for flashlight saving three teammates and blinding the killer as he vaulted the picket fence. I deserved being face-camped in the basement and willingly accepted my punishment. 
---
Yeah one person came close to making me drop somebody with a corner of the shack. Still no dice.
---
Did someone combine Shrek with Gollum?

Wheelchair + helmet 
---
Be nice to your killers, and they will be nice back. Less "GG ez baby killer" and more commending good killers and helping bad killers. Behind our ranks, we are all just people.
---
Well if you can't see that...
---
Sorry to tell you that but you've to consider that it's still an asymmetrical 1v4 game. Balance-regarding design is a totally different thing for Killers than it is for Survivors. Simply because the Killer can't be at several places at the same time and Survivors are able to stack perks/items/add-ons, something Killers obviously can't.
---
Sure, Ebony Mori's dumb, can't deny that. But a 4-man BNP squad is much more of a free win than a Killer with the ebony mori is. If we're not talking about the primal version of both, then it become's quite specific.
---
But there's a reason they nerfed/changed both after all. Ebony Mori enabled much too fast gameplay as a Killer could take that Survivor out of the game immediately once s/he's been downed. But having atleast 3 out of 5 gens done after the first 30 seconds ingame is atleast just as bad.
---
This is the very reason why they slowed down Ebony's domino-effect so absurdely fast, and this is also the reason why the nerfed BNP extremely. It's not fun to play against while leaving your opponent/s absolutely chanceless if they haven't the busted counterpart.
---
Huntress isn’t the oldest killer? I thought the OG killer trio were the oldest being recruited in the 1800s. Sorry I’m kind of deep into lore so I just wanted to point that out
---
Nooo how did clauds become the new Dwight's lol
---
For the sake of this games community I really hope the next COD doesn't suck. Hopefully it'll siphon some of these children away. Doesn't seem like Apex is doing the trick.
---
well the killer (poster) said if you loop all game or are SWF, you get camped.  i guess the survivor were suppose to run in a straight line?  I bet he killed 2 of them camping :/ 
---
How did you get here?
---
All I can say is Gideon Meat plant for survivor, if you know that map like the back of your hand, your lethal against the killer and super easy to find the hatch!   
---
Once you are a still. You have to time it right. If the hooking sound plays at all before you are sealed inside, it doesn't work.
---
Idk dude. Spirit is an upper killer for sure. Billy is around mid for me and huntrees and nurse are closer to the bottom. And thats just going off base killer. I main clown and my perks for him are strictly for annoying survivors.
---
I mean I played lol for a long ass time too and it was way more toxic. People constantly isn’t, throw games on purpose, and the amount of slurs and death threats in a single lol game rival the grand total I’ve seen in dbd 
---
when you run the killer around for 5 minutes and you're playing solo cue and your other teammates have not gotten a single gen done
---
Got my first Kobe ever the other day, only for spirit tonimmediately appear and rebook me 
---
I'm pretty sure it does

who would win

one explosive boi vs one killer looking up lmao

The bottom text should be at the top.

I would t mind it if scratch marks worked.

Wait there's a capon how gay David makes you?

Prob not, it would be really unfair for console players 
---
I started playing on ps4 in January of this year so I'm still pretty new. What exactly is wrong with console version? I haven't noticed any issues but then again it very well could be something that a noob wouldn't be privy too. 
---
And in turn Philip will leave Sally for Rin.

Natural invisibility.  Always a gamble whether you are playing against a troll or a potato.
---
For the bare purpose of information Spine Chill is superior to Premonition in almost every way. The only advantage Premo has in comparasion, is the specific direction info it gives. But that's about it.
---
Spine Chill is obviously more consistent as it doesn't have any cooldown. Depending on the map you definetly won't need that direction hint from Premonition as you can...Y'Know...Just use your eyes. Spine Chill is also more effective as it can't be fooled by random Killer movements. Meanwhile we've a good amount of Killers that have no issue with getting below that 32m radius or simply synergize pretty well with M&amp;A. Meaning Premo might just be triggered because that Killer happened to walk around in that 32m radius even tho s/he didn't even head for you in the first place. Spine Chill will remain active, when a Killer is literally on their way to the gen you're sitting on, you'll recognize that as the perk will remain active for a suspicious amount of time.
---
Another reason why Spine Chill is more efficient is that it might also help you out in chases. When it comes up to mindgame-heavy spots that rely on Line-Of-Sight block, it might be handy to know when the Killer looks directly at you and when s/he doesn't. Or as a "green traffic light" to roam around more safely with the Killer being more or less closer than you comfort allows.
---
But I must also admit that the 2nd effect is kinda unnecessary. The only thing is does is adding some extra cheese against Freddies but that's about it. Against a Doctor with a good set-up it might actually even become a disadvatange. I think they just wanted immerse a bit with that effect. You feel that the Killer is staring at you, causing you to get nervous and hasty (which's the reason for faster action speed and higher skillcheck chances). You must also consider that this perk has been a thing since the very beginning of the game.
---
But yeah, when it comes up to Premo and Spine Chill I definetly think Spine Chill is much better. Simply due to its versatillity. Premo is literally a perk for nothing but lack of perception and more or less an enforcement of stealth-play (like, why wouldn't you attempt to stealth when you're running Premo?). These "immersed" Survivors that crouch around with Premo and Urban 24/7 while not getting shit done due to being muuuuch to cautious is beyond me anyway to be fair. The game's become annoyingly long, end mostly bad for the Survivors, and the folks who're actually participating at attempting to get out are pissed because they start to recognize that it's been a 1v2/1v3 the whole game anyway.
---
vs Windstorm Wraith vs Sketchbook Legion
---
Correct, the gates were open. 
---
going faster doesn't make steering harder? you're just faster, so you need to react faster. doom engravings + moonshine is a great combo btw.
---
I used to do no add-ons, but honestly Doom engravings are so fucking good, they allow you to do stuff otherwise completely impossible
---
Damn, beat me to it
---
Accuracy does nothing, blind duration doesn't affect killers with functional ears.
---
The first thing I’m not going to do is look back 4+ months of this subs history for the last (definitely not the first) time this was posted, but what I will do is make you aware that this specific format, down to the top half which you so painstakingly put into MS paint, has already been posted. We’ve seen this exact meme already and I’m not enough of the meme police to go Sherlock Holmes’ing for the ancient source. Just collect your repost karma and go 😂😂😂😂
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's always the same distance, is it not? It's not like you're literally throwing a projectile, it goes through walls and barriers.
---
According to the wiki:
---
"*Once the Perk is activated, press the Active Abilitybutton while crouched and motionless to throw a pebble, which creates a loud noise notification for the Killer at a distance of 10/15/20 metres.*"
---
"*Thrown pebbles do not collide with walls and objects such as lockers and hence will only create noise notifications upon colliding with the ground or floor.*"

---
Okay, step 1: hold m1 for 80 seconds because thats fun
---
Step 2: do it 5 times
---
ah Lovely! im hyped
---
Just bc it's a strat doesn't mean it's not toxic. Looping all game so the killer has no chance of hitting you while gens pop is a dick move and obv gonna piss people off. See how that sounds?
---
Items, I never use them, should I use them more. I'm intrigued to run an Ace/Plunder build for the fun of it, but I honestly have no idea what items and add-ons are the best to use with each other. Right now I pretty much look for a chest for the sole purpose of collecting it. 
---
Don't worry, it's just Chungus piping in his hot off the presses FOX News survivor bias. 
---
Having no counterplay doesn't make him a good killer. His ability gives him guaranteed downs, but without Frank's it takes so long to do so that by the time you down someone three gens are done and a fourth is being worked on.
---
i dont think theres a way to find out on ps4 but im certain its about that. maybe more im not sure tbh 😭
---
I've had it recently where I'd blind a killer with a flash light and they don't drop the survivor. It say killer blind though. The same when I used a firecracker it said killer blind but didn't drop the survivor.
---
i looked it and saw nothin :(
---
But, Spine chill is so much better than premonition? I'd argue that though spinechill isn't meta, it's still much more viable than premonition.
---
thats not even necessarily their fault, theres just not enough people playing solo to fill up all the 3 man lobbies out there... 
---
Why do people sit in the exit gate a foot away from leaving until the killer sees them? It's a waste of time and pretty toxic if you ask me
---
don't try to downplay the toxic things people do in dbd though, its not a dick measuring contest
---
I don't know. *is it*
---
lolol both sides are toxic.
---
Except looping is literally the only strat survivors have, killers don’t have to camp
---
Stuff like having people be able to continue on shit when they're in the dream transition, being able to do nothing when I've downed my obsession and two awake people run up and start healing her until they finally fall asleep, and Freddy's swipe auto-aiming into awake survivors for a 100% safe bodyblock, means Freddy has some extremely major weaknesses.
---
I have as well. But that's not every game. Sometimes I have good teammates, sometimes I have bad teammates. 
---
The only crutch I consistently see is adrenaline, and it’s pretty debatable if that’s a crutch because you basically need it if you’re taking agro all game 
---
thats because the REALLY sweaty swfs derank on purpose to bully low ranking killers

Math is bad civilization

There are a ton of [videos and tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ) that helped me out a ton when I was learning how to play killer. I'd also suggest watching streamers and other high level games, as you can pick up a lot of good information and theory from them.
---
At the end of the game? Yeah, that's pretty much all they have left to do. And there's a difference between counterplay and something that has no counterplay in turn, unless the user makes a mistake.

I’d say start the trail as normal but can’t heal from injured state

Survivor aura is brighter than gens, so anyone trying to hide behind them hasn't really been able to at least in my experience

---
What
---
Didn't they change it to where you can't use OoO like that, because it's flat out broken?
---
Unless you have an injured survivor right next to you or in a chase further away it doesn't hurt to chase them out. But at that point it's pretty much over.
---
The only survivors I see on gens are ones on the side. If you block the field of view between the hook and yourself with the gen they can't see you

I agree man he's weak. I won't disagree with any factual info. I usually do very well even against higher SWF groups/randoms teaming up. Have I been burnt badly? Yes. Have you seen Freddy's face? But in all seriousness yeah I've had 0-1 kills before. More often than not I get 3/4K. Freddy is viable and can handle high ranks if you know how to handle it. Just the other day I had a 39k game with Freddy and with all bonus it was close to 62k BPs.   
---
Legion. I was in a KYF with newbies and they got 2 kills because spamming M1 or R2 requires no skill. Shit killer for low IQ gamera.

---
It's a one time use perk. Id hardly call it a crutch since most games it gets used I'm just already healthy and just use it as a speed boost to an exit gate.

“Can not attack survivors until a survivor sees your face. Once a survivor sees your face you are allowed to attack only them, you gain +10% movement speed and the survivor suffers the ‘Exposed’ status effect and can be seen through walls for the duration of the game.”

Agreed. Thanks to Spine Chill, I’m able to play mind games with her - and urban evasion away as she’s phasing to me hehe

I just wish they hurried up and made it so that Freddy wasn't so extremely easily abusable like that. This shit should've beeb fixed week 1 or 2.
---
Hate to break it to you, but no. 
---
Do you know why so many survivors DC when they know an ebony mori is in play? It’s because they don’t feel like playing a wasted game. Instead of getting hooked 3 times, it’s now only once. You’ve severely limited you chances at a win. So why play? 
---
But good lord. The mere idea of survivors having an ultra rare add on that insta-repairs gens? The idea of the killers change to win being greatly decreased? Well that’s just insane! 
---
Or not. Maybe it’s just being a hypocrite.
---
A 4-man BNP squad means that all 4 survivors would need to first acquire an ultra rare add on. Now if all four go in they can only insta heal ONE gen. *slow clap*
---
Killers however get one ultra rare and get to do the equivalent of wiping the pieces off the chest board (unless they truly suck). 
---
It’s a game that has a 1v4 balance. Survivors do not have a single pink item that’s anywhere near as strong or opportunistic in-game outcome as Ebony Mori. Period. 
---
We get to affect mist more than killers. Whooptie do!

is it just me or are getting the same try hard swf group multiple times fun, its more of a challenge
---
Not trying to hijack a survivor's post, but my favorite was when I downed someone how blind from firecrackers; I couldn't believe I made that shot
---
Move around stuff, vault a window, if you feel she’s right on your ass then throw a pallet down and try to stun her. She can hear you but unless she’s close enough to get collision or you’re running through tall grass she doesn’t have your exact location. The whooshing does get louder the closer she gets to you so try and throw her off by moving down odd pathways and doubling back, spin out if you think she’s gonna unphase, just general unpredictability is your friend at the time.
---
If you’re at a loop or tile already then it’s up to you to predict what she’s going to do, you’re not going anywhere so you don’t need to worry about a ghost riding your ass. She can’t be looped like normal yah but that doesn’t instantly make her broken.
---
[not really what you asked to but this Hag game is one of the funniest I've ever seen](https://youtu.be/ITh_o3njSJI?t=338)
---
So last night I decided to do my first Normal match of LoL (Draft Pick of course) with two friends (they sit around high Bronze-mid Silver) after not playing the game for over a year outside of "warming up" over teh last few days with some ARURF (which is a mindless shitshow).  
---
I was Ziggs mid versus an Akali who had _quite_ a lot of playtime on that champion.  Meanwhile our bot lane consisted of a braindead Lucian and a ragey high Silver Vel'koz support who started berating me for not following Akali when she roamed bot to of course kill them (and this was after pinging multiple times that she was MIA mid).  
---
Needless to say, the game snowballed out of control and the Vel'koz + enemy team was regularly talking shit.  Near the end of the game (which took 30+ minutes because low elo players have no idea how to close a match without giving free shutdowns and extending the game by 5-10 minutes) they were of course BMing with emote spam, flashing mastery emotes, etc.  By the time they got to the Nexus and the game was obviously over, they deliberately waited until folks started respawning so that they could kill my teammates at the fountain, all while still spamming emotes/etc.  So that was 30-40 minutes of time wasted in a game where no one could really do anything and we had an idiot teammate who wouldn't stop feeding + getting super angry at everyone in chat.  
---
In Dead By Daylight that shit doesn't happen.  If teammates are idiots they die early.  If Killers are toxic the match tends to end fairly fast unless they go for a slug.  Also of course you can disconnect from any game without consequence (if anything you get benefits from it because rank is a joke and the higher ranks just lead to more tryhard Killers and Legion mains) as long as you don't do it too much.   Matches only last ~10-20 minutes at most in DBD, whereas in LoL it's upwards of 40-50+ minutes.  DBD matches are easy to brush off and with MLGA you can even put toxic Killers on your block list if you really want to.
---
To say this game has a more toxic community than LoL is ridiculous.  It's nowhere near as bad as the shit that happens in LoL, and even when things do get bad you can brush it off so much easier because matches don't last very long.  
---
I had a match that had 2 gens left and i was the last survivor. The killer was camping the hatch so i 99% both of the gens then popped them both within seconds of each other. The killer walked to each gate, then back to the hatch and stayed camping it. I opened one door, and as i just opened the second one the killer started chasing me. I looped him a bit, scared of being NOEDed and made the hatch. "You have been added to a group" on ps4 and in came the most salt ive ever had. If youre going to just camp the hatch there are other ways to escape. You just have to pick up your balls and make the commitment to outplay instead of outlast the stupid hatch standoff. Needless to say i got a shitload of bps for the match 
---
that doesnt make any sense what lmao? killing is the objective of the killer, so slugging to kill is following the objective, hiding after the gates are open isnt following the survivor objective.
---
Idk why people face camp tbh. They should be proxy camping so they have a chance at getting even more points. Unless the guy is directly next to an open exit I don't see why face camping would help you win. 
---
Yeah, i did this too one time as Myers EW3... God, only remembering it is so satisfying
---
Looks to be the easiest daily I've ever seen. 
---
#1 Legion #2 nurse #3 spirit
---
Fuckin nurses? wtf lol 
---
At that point you’re not likely to win, you’re just cutting your losses and getting a kill.
---
Doctor's might be slightly easier, since you can spam all 4 shocks on one survivor. 
---
the point isnt being made about the doctor though
---
It's funny how differently time feels in different roles. I really want to measure my chases as killer and survivor to track which felt satisfying and which didn't on both sides and compare the durations.
---
brutus as a killer? I mean sure but I don't see how they could really make him "scary". This is a horror game after all.
---
Then you say one more game again but 2am turns to 10am
---
Well then, I suggest we take another stab at this.
---
Ok
---
*internal screaming*
---
The timer stops when they're downed, though, so... How can you 'cheese' the bear traps? And how are you supposed to get deviousness points as the Pig if it's random chance for getting a bear trap kill? 
---
as long as you're not downplaying it, I'm just wary of CERTAIN people when they talk about toxicity like "ay bruh i played cod im a holocaust survivor" and they go and call everyone pussies because people have the AUDACITY to claim that **toxicity is a bad thing** and they start to fetishize toxicity. but yeah teabagging and clicking isn't a big deal. 
---
I don't mind normal camping when the exits open but when they're literally touching your face with theirs until you die its like ''Really tho?'' To make it worse my whole team was injured anyway -.-
---
Yeah still tho you can proxy camp and have a better chance at someone coming for the unhook while you're nearby and you possibly getting both. 
---
Idk I guess I just play both sides a lot and see little value in actually face camping even if I am going to lose. 
---
Oh, up is Adrenaline, left is Sprint Burst, down is Unbreakable, and right is Quick and Quiet.
---
I call it the '3 person glitch'. 
---
Unless a 2nd player leaves the lobby, the matchmaking servers has a brain fart and never progresses further. 
---
This only happens when you get 4 survivors and one leaves, not when you start with 3 in the lobby. 
---
I’m sorry that sometimes the killer isn’t useless.
---
Entitled survivors are hilarious.
---
idk about 096, and 504... how would tomatoes make a good killer??
---
Because we've got some folks with major victim complexes that think DBD is somehow worse than LoL.
---
Exactly, which gives us survivors a lil hope.  However, with legion he’ll just smack you a bunch and moonwalk at you so you can’t mend...
---
I use it for the speed of vaulting
---
If you'll just camp anyone who doesnt run in a straight line how is there any point in them being nice?
---
NPC's have invaded the forums.
---
I just love how triggered ive got you, btw not reading the shit you wrote lmao, have a good life
---
Aren't there messages from Benedict Baker set in 1894?
---
Yeah, survivor lobbies in swf takes hours ob console, and killer is instant and gives way more bp,
---
Premo 1 is soo OP. The 60 second cool down and 12 meter range is too powerful /s
---
Must 99 all gens for Max points!  Glad to hear you spent the time being gods in the killer arena!
---
I always thought it would be better if the daily was generic with bonus points for a specific survivor/killer. 
---
The annoying dalies are the ones like open an exit gate with "specific survivor". At least with this change you could do it on your main survivor rather than a level 1 random survivor 
---
No for sure it sucks. I'm not trying to say it's ok for them to make unfulfilled promises. I read a while back that console bans are active so it seems like a weird use of manpower when  the core game needs some optimization. 
---
How? The survivors objective is to survive, and hiding is a way to survive. 
---
Template?
---
I always bm, i love salty killers,so satisfying, well, when they dont catch me because of bullshit like this
---
Buddy...it affects vaulting speed. Look it up. So does resilience.
---
No. As Rank 1, even at desperate times there isn't a need to camp or tunnel. If the survivors got all 5 gens and about to escape, it's the killers fault. Not theirs.
---
I would suggest Spirit just because of Spirit Fury. It is such a badass perk for killers who want to just hulk through pallets/don’t have the mobility to wreck them. Enduring Spirit Fury is my core on a lot of killers. 
---
LOL, the Clown salute was kinda bad ass. 
---
Usually only gotta M1 2 gens and get the hatch, not sure why they didn't!
---
So grabbing someone when they go to unhook doesn’t exist? Standing right in front of the hook doesn’t exist? 
---
Countering looping is a joke on like half the killers and easy to do on the rest, countering facecamping pretty much requires a 4 man with specific perks 
---
Except they literally did? If you get infinited you ran it wrong 
---
Yea....
---
I want that smug clown to be my steam profile for a long time.
---
It's not reportable, but everyone is going to think you're a dick for doing it. Basement is already annoying enough as is, where if you get rescued you then have to run out of a long hallway just hoping the killer didn't decide to come back for you guys (usually always do if they're not currently in a chase). And it's even worse on some maps like coal tower.
---
In my opinion it is an exploit to body block, and it baffles me that it's still in the game. And the devs saying that it's fine to do it as long as you're trying to wait out borrowed time is extremely dumb to me. No skill required, guaranteed kill (with some killers more than others), not fun for either party (unless you like being a dick which a lot do so, point nullified).
---
It's one of the only games where the action is the same but the only thing making it reportable is the intent. Only reason it's reportable is because the killer is "holding the game hostage" meaning you have to DC, lose your bloodpoints for that game, and lose 2 pips cause you literally can't do anything else. 
---
Also, killer camps or always patrols an area? Just use borrowed time! Except the exploit completely "counters" it.
---
"But that's so situational."
---
Borrowed time is already a situational perk its dumb to have extra layers of situational uses. 
---
If it's a certain killer and you get put in basement a lot of survivors will just say "screw it he's dead" even if it's your first hook.
---
Honestly I think this is the reason so many people hate The Game, because you can't tell if the killer's coming to the gen you're on, or is below/above you. Luckily, spine chill kinda solves that problem.
---
All perks are crutches. 
---
Slippery Meat, Left Behind, Sole Survivor are the only perks REAL MEN use. 
---
/s just in case any of y’all can’t comprehend sarcasm. 
---
Yeah, I mean, if being "toxic" is evading the killer, isn't it just playing the game?
---
Legit nobody asked for this ship. 
---
Yeah I checked out a couple of Ochido's videos when I made the post, that guy needs to just calm down.
---
I wish to spread your word to the console realm.
---
Imagine being this wrong. Everyone knows that maximum drifting TurnBilly is best Billy. Thompson's Moonshine Spiked Boots till I die
---
There definelty aren’t any infinite loops left in the game. Idk what you’re arguing the devs literally removed them 
---
I found the [exact image you used](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TZ4Sxv3HC74/maxresdefault.jpg) for Michael's Mori by Googling "Michael Myers Mori." It was literally the first result.
---
While I couldn't find the specific "Just girly things" you used there have been countless "when he holds you tight and won't let go" or "when he lifts you up" (and hooks you) posts on this sub.
---
You can paint the Stary Night with Green and Magenta but it's still the Stary Night.
---
Idek what you’re arguing, camping is toxic lol nothing you’ve said disproves that
---
“We’re not tools of The Entity or anything else.  Unhooking was the only thing I was ever good at, but at least I always unhooked for someone I believed in.” 
---
Carb Tuning Guide Thompsons Mix feels pretty damn good too, actually Tuning Guide with anything feels good let's be honest
---
Never seen before
---
Nurses? On legion?
---
Stuck as 34 points, did gens, escaped, hooked etc, finally noticed this:( 
---
Sad to see im not the only one
---
By that logic the killers objective is to hook survivors, which slugging doesn’t do
---
&gt;As soon as I flip this switch the world is going to be as toxic as us!
---
You could follow at a distance like some people do with legion to cheese and avoid them interacting with the saw boxes, and you get deviousness from crouch-attacks too.

*killer's
---
That requires leveling Freddy up or shrine
---
Therefore you won't get banned by one single disconnect.  
---
I'd say that you would get a warning and later on a timeout if it happens multiple times in a certain timespan.  
---
But you are right, it happens way too often that you're getting kicked while loading the match..
---
As if higher ranks bother healing when playing against him 
---
Dwight, not popular, not good at sports, under average grades and a laughing stock
---
It’s only bannable if you completely ignore the Survivors. If you try to kill them while keeping the gens locked down then it’s fine. 
---
&gt; in DbD if your account isn't private it becomes an open wall for whatever insult a player feels like throwing at you and you have no choice but to see it and choose to remove it.

You know you can make your account public on Steam and keep comments to friends-only, right?
---
Survive with Friends
---
You're talking about a game where teabagging is not only commonplace but encouraged, where farming your teammates, early disconnects and camping off the bat run rampant. Both sides of the game are at constant war with each other and god forbid you have an opinion that goes against your preferred side or your head is ripped clean off. The matches may be shorter, sure, but people will sit there in the lobby doing nothing even if they die early just to tell you how you should kill yourself because your mother was too stupid to swallow.
---
At least in League, trolling your team and being an unrepentant asshat are reportable - and by that I mean their reports *actually do something*. I'd take their community over ours any day.
---
Yea, I know this is NOT a repost because you have jeff. Good job on this by the way. Keep up the great work.
---
Does it take anyone else a long time to find a game as killer?
---
I just started playing recently and I'm pretty low rank (18) but it took me 30 minutes to fill a lobby and I just wanted to know if this is normal
---
Game should be called Dead By NOED
---
Probably myers 
---
noice
---
I don't think you're playing DBD then, you might have mistaken it for Roblox.
---
Huntress. Everyone wants to smash her.
---
My friend doesn’t even need the gold coins anymore but she still keeps grabbing lanterns just so I can’t have them. The beginning of the game is always a wild scramble to get a lantern for both of us.
---
I wish they had instead of a daily mission have a weekly list that offers a mix of killer and survivor genetics with one or two specific and bump up the reward to more BP and a small number of Iridicent Shards. Like imagine getting a list of 8 challenges that progressively get more specific as the list goes down. 
---
*Complete Two Full Generators
---
*Hook Three Survivors 
---
*Heal survivors for 3 Health States
---
*Mori One Survivor
---
*Stun a killer with 3 or more pallets in one game 
---
*Injure 2 or more surviors within 30 seconds
---
*Survive a trial with 2 or more Iridicent emblems 
---
*Kill all four survivors with 3 or more Generators remaining
---
I vote Myers as the most fun to play against. 
---
Here's hoping it's Pinhead (since he is very old). I would like to see a new licensed killer WITH prepared approvals for cosmetics.
---
Flashlight and ds are standards. NOOB standards.
---
Yes he can, and no it doesn't. Once grabbed, you're asleep too.
---
I've never sensed such sexual tension from a post before
---
**Stalking charge intensifies**
---
How so? It's not an FPS, you don't have precise aiming, not even with huntress. Plenty of PC players play with controller.
---
*FUCKING NYYYYYYYOOOOOMMMM*
---
Why is unbreakble different?
---
Actually Nurse walks (floats?) at 95% and some killers go at 105%
---
Is it weird that I think it’s fun to go against Freddy? He brings a new element to the games and brings a kind of uneasy fear because you can’t see him.
---
r/woosh
---
TIL Billy is the anime kid in school
---
I can only do ones of shirtless Myers so many times ;-;
---
Tum Tums
---
Replace it with the Benny Hill theme.
---
How exactly do you see this ability functioning in a match?
---
I really like these! I think they need to get more creative/ add some in. It feels a long time since the daily rituals received any love at all. 25k bloodpoints is pretty pitiful considering playing killer with BBQ you can get around 50k in one game....
---
We've figured you out again, Riddler!
---
Except killers kinda have to tunnel sometimes to win
---
Sounds risky. Would create too many casualties
---
The “strange world” is the eleventh chapter of deadbydaylight. Welcome to your new map, the pocket dimension. A world entirely created by the killer, this map is characterized by long hallways, slimy ground, and seemingly endless rooms. The new killer 
---
“The old man.” Corporal Lawrence was a quiet and strange man. He seemed eery everywhere he went. Once he went on a night operation in the trenches of world war 1 and came back changed. That night, everyone in the trench was dead. The scp foundation contained him and was named SCP-106. But one night, he escaped, forever. 
---
The old man is an abhorrent killer, able to use his power “corporal’s curse” to walk through walls, pallets, and vault points at a slow pace, at cost of his meter, which builds up slowly. He is also able to put down traps, where survivors will slowly build up damage that cannot be healed, leading up to being injured with the mangled status effect.
---
The old man’s perks are:
---
Object class: Keter
---
Your nightmare inducing abilities have gained you reputation among the damned, generator progress inside of your terror radius is reduced by 20/30/40%
---
Special containment procedures 
---
You shall contain them as they contained you in your past, when there is one generator left, generator progress is reduced by 25/50/75%
---
They are toys
---
You like to play with and torture your prey, upon losing a survivor, gain a speed boost of 3/5/8% for 5/10/15 seconds
---
Your new survivor is Researcher Talloran. Talloran was the lead scientist into SCP-3999, supposedly a godly figure. When the world was reset, people assumed that Talloran had taken his own life to restore the world. Instead he had been taken, when a strange fog appeared in the containment area.
---
Talloran’s perks are:
---
Indefeatable: you have been through worse, upon stunning the killer, sprint for 150% of your normal running speed for a maximum of 3 seconds if not exhausted. Gains exhausted for 60/50/40 seconds
---
“This is pathetic. Your pathetic.”
---
Body of steel: This pain is nothing compared to what you’ve been through. Upon getting unhooked, you immediately heal up a health state if all generators are powered. 
---
“ It was the worst pain I had ever felt, but I survived.”
---
Ingenious: your genius allows you to find use in things most would not, item consumption is reduced by 30/40/50%
---
That took too long to make
---
Pc gets way better frame rates 
---
Tunneling is not disconnecting. One is bannable- the other specifically is not. Tunneling is a play choice- disconnecting is taking the ball and running away.
---
That's because they are *very fucking annoying* to play against.
---
&gt;You have 100% chance of escaping
---
i dont even know what this means...like you escape the match? From their shoulder? From the hook?? 
---
Match and Shoulder seems too strong and from hook is just like a worse deliverance

JULIETCAKES YAY i was waiting for you to post another drawing :3 im still looking at the one you drew about my vid lol. They are so charming.
---
Hex totems spawn in the same general area for each map if there's only one. When you run 2 hexes, the totems may spawn elsewhere. They might find your DH, or your Ruin, but probably not both. If they find your DH first, they'll keep looking for ruin, which slows the game down even more.
---
the only reason i ever run it is because i literally do not have anything else, im not about to run tier 1 thrill of the hunt
---
I love playing clown but I imagine people don't like playing against him
---
I was half expecting that cat to just charge into the screen and drop everything 
---
Its my favourite add-on, fuck the primer bulb, engravings is where its at.
---
You seriously don't have any decent perks? That's a massive rip tbh
---
Lol exposed
---
not unlocked no, its literally a curse i wont get ruin till like level 80
---
What about Enduring or Nurses? 
---
That’s wild. So, are the totems’ random spawn on like the same algorithm or system that like, say, the hatch would be? Because, if so, I’ve been looking for both by literally just wandering until I hear something like a dummy. Haha
---
You can’t use a toolbox, a map, a flashlight, a firecracker, etcetera, either.
---
It’s an intended mechanic.
---
Mouse
---
This one is very nice, I like the light pink :)
---
i have been seeing the shapeshift mechanic thrown around and i have to say, I don't want it. It is  very unoriginal and not fun to play as or against. 
---
Also, no more registered killers, i rather have the devs use their creative minds to make original killers with unique mecanics.
---
and another thing: two clowns, really? 
---
Sorry, OP, it's a bad Idea. The only registered killer I believe can be in the game is Pinhead.
---
Add a speed boost to Clean escape and you got yourself some solid perks here!
---
now i feel bad for not letting my cat sleep in front of my tv :(
---
Piggy
---
Well, what if the killer can choose specific objects or players to change into? Such as chests, environmental objects or even generators as well as survivors. The killer can make an attempt to attack someone while shapeshifted, but a miss results in a long recovery animation. I don't really see why it would not work since TF2 has had the spy mechanic for years and even squads can have trouble spotting them.
---
An alternative would be a poltergeist killer that can possess and tamper with generators. That's another idea I had.
---
Billy never tires. His signature perk is unrelenting.
---
If your 3 teammates are teabagging an inch away from the exit and I catch you that's really the only thing I have left to do other than completely lose
---
Yeah, the problem is the frequency of failed loads/disconnects from host. Normal gameplay would result in compounded bans and many would be unable to play for extended periods through no fault of their own.
---
I appreciate your opinion, but how would Pinhead work better?
---
So, look at other killer abilities and what they do. They assist in ending chases and locating survivors. This does neither of those things.
---
And I don't know what the point of tampering with generators would be.
---
Should be Franklin's Demise, instead of Nurse's Calling. NC doesn't work on mending.
---
Cannibal has no speed compared to hillbilly what is wrong with him
---
-3-
---
It's been happening since the event
---
no, you're just sensitive.
---
Too much chili man
---
Possible save and flex time 
---
i-
---
So more or less what any killer runs?
---
I mean, 360'ing and moon walking are easier on lower frames, especially with a controller
---
Well tampering with generators would assist the killer by making one generator unrepairable for a couple minutes, allowing the killer to narrow down their search.
---
What ideas do you have?
---
Both wrong
---
Imagine turning into a chest and sitting there for 5 minutes as all the gens get popped
---
That's literally his only positive
---
Legion freddy and doctor seem to be the killers people have the least fun with. Aside from doctor, I like going against both. 
---
I wouldn’t call DS “vital” but yeah I agree that the Halloween chapter is probably the way to go.
---
Oh my god he's just so fun! Like how can a killer be fun to play, and be against 
---
Haha, yeah. honestly I thought about it and between the likelyhood of if being HG and the consequences of it (which are rarely catastrophic) I just decided to cleanse everything. With the caveat that if I have doubts like when it's a spirit and there's no ruin, I will try to do it when the person being chased is already injured.
---
Hag. I was given hell and I shall give hell. &gt;:D
---
As for gameplay survivors, not lore, I hope I'm a cutie pie like Adam.
---
Excuse the fuck me Claudette isn't ugly??? She's hecka cute???
---
Why wouldn't they?
---
Depends on the platform I guess. It's never taken me that long on PC. The event was causing long queue times for survivors, not killers
---
No it's coming with the Chucky chapter
---
And you're part of the problem.
---
I'm not aware of a rank 15 limit being an actual thing. I've just looked up the rank reset table on the official wiki and found no hint about it. Also, I can't think of how those rank 19-17 killers had all these endgame perks from different killers without being in lower ranks before. 
---
Basically you are right, but if you disconnect way too often in a certain (short) amount of time then it's a bit reasonable to get a timeout.  
---
To prevent any false punishments I've listed the warning and a short ban as second warning as an idea. They probably need to implement some kind of system to analyse whether it was a disconnect on purpose after a specific action ingame as well.  
---
Also, they could introduce the possibility to reconnect to a game in the first 2-3 minutes if you got kicked while loading the match or whatnot.  
---
There are many ways to fight this immense disconnect problem instead of letting it happen almost every game without any punishment.  
---
These are only timebans no permanent bans I was speaking of and I think it's more frustrating for the 3 other survivors and the killer than for 1 survivor who either abused the system and got what he deserved or got kicked by internet problems who has to wait 0-30 minutes maximum.  
---
In my opinion deranking in a certain amount is okay but it is not okay when I have to play as newcomer against rank 1 killers with 800 hours of playtime who deranked down to 20-16 in order to wreck the game in 2 minutes.  
---
I really like the perk idea you've described, it might really help against strong derankers.
---
This reminds me I don't do Myers Moonwalk near enough. There really is no way to lose with Myers. Even if all 4 are at the exit, you can just do that and win by default.
---
I hate going against doctor the most
---
Spirit, fun killer, fun perks. Plus with adam you get the diversion perk and nothing, NOTHING beats the pebble.
---
That girl does not take pallets to the face very well
---
He looks very different and would have his very own identity in the game. At least I believe so. But like i said, I rather have original killers. I just don't want another Cannibal &amp; Hillbilly situation. Big fan of them both, but two chainsaw killers really whips my nae naes. 
---
The only positive thing about him are the perks and the movie.
---
Like Survivors give two shits I the Killer's having fun, lol.
---
I know, I didn't mean it negatively. I like the idea.
---
Nice dead hard
---
They worked on me once *while* I was looking up. Still not sure if game was whack or if I just wasn't looking up hard enough.
---
No :(
---
I like playing against him, the dizziness of the gas makes me feel hopeless against the killer, and of course at that point I kinda am
---
Probably the single most basic rule of this game is to do generators.  This is why everyone gets made fun of for not doing them, and ultimately it's why teams lose.  In red ranks vs a good survivor team, generators are absolutely crushed in about 5 minutes.  I have stopped using self care and started focusing more on generators, and I've noticed that we almost always get to one gen or exit gates powered when everyone slams gens.  But it sure is fun to follow your teammates around for flashlight saves!
---
Can't be any more annoying than facing a swf toolbox multi genrush squad...
---
I mean, this is a gaming subreddit. You should expect gameplay, amirite?
---
I’d say tapp, he has some decent situational perks 
---
The perk is supposed to warn you when the killer is coming. The extra percents are there as more of a "I just need a little bit more progress" type of thing if you decide you want to commit. It's not that bad, definitely not one of the most useless at least.
---
That means that he might mess up skill checks more
---
Because he's easily the most balanced Killer.

Escape plan would be too strong against SWF, when playing against them you have to slug so much, especially when the survivor is under a palet or if they have flashlight/firecrackers. 
---
you can only remember if you survive.
---
DARN
---
It makes survivors slightly more visible but it also makes the killer and killer things slightly more visible as well.

Stealth Killers, bear traps, totems maybe etc.

Nope, totally lost.
---
I’m still lost as to wtf I was reading...
---
I think you can link guy I PSN Account to your YouTube one and have it upload when you hit share.
---
Very solid m8
---
Ardetha is great to watch if you want to improve your gameplay
---
Ace, hes ace
---
Someone explain 
---
Sally would not be able to get into any sort of relationship, regardless of who it is with, because the whole reason she's even in the entity's realm is because she got so depressed after her HUSBAND died. A widow like that would never get into another relationship and it certainly wouldn't be with someone like Philip. This ship makes no sense and the fact the devs want to make it canon shows just how much they don't know what the fuck they're doing with their game. Both lore- and gameplay-wise. 
---
Killer tunnels survivor
---
Survivor dcs 
---
Killer guess I don't need to tunnel them anymore
---
LMAO. What else do you expect them to do? The game's over. They have no reason to leave and let you escape. Get over your entitlement, dude.
---
2 questions. 
---
1. Whenever I play against pig, I can never seem to get reverse bear traps off my head even when I search lots of jigsaw boxes. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Do you have to do all the skill checks right in one go?
---
2. What else do keys do besides unlock black locks(the hatch)? What are dark locks?
---
Ruin and Nurses? Seriously? It should be Franks Mixtape and Bloodhound
---
It's a community of writers who write about (fictional) supernatural things, or 'anomalous' as they like to use. Places, objects, creatures, events, there's all sorts of great stuff in there. Everything from humor to psychological horror.
---
You should post this, get more attention 
---
I really love Myers, both when I play him and when against him. 
---
Play with your Food, Remember me, Ruin, and I'm not sure for the last one.
---
I find it hard to focus and see where I'm going in the dream world because of how white it is
---
r/woooosh
---
If I see no one making an attempt to save me and I know the killer isn't camping, I don't bother struggling.
---
But I also don’t know hahahaha
---
r/selfwooosh ?
---
Multitasking is simply absurd. It removes an entire method of slowing down the game. That would instantly be the most meta and most powerful perk in dbd
---
So, how do we have to know that you used no blinks?
---
Huntress; if she's bad the game is a blast, if she's good then the game is a great challenge.
---
Proxying with the exit open and more than 1 Survivor left is no different than standing in the corner and staring at the wall. The person on the hook *will* get away and it's unlikely you'll catch someone else without an insta-down.
---
Listen to the cat. He is giving you clues about the game. Plus, you are getting one more perk "spine chill." I need a cat. 
---
Maybe, but if she runs out of traps or they get burned, she's literally an M1 killer at 110% movement speed. Not that good.
---
I did this for fun, I might post it if I refine it and make the wording better and stuff
---
Posts like this (OP's not yours) annoy me because I have a HybridPanda mindset when I play where I try to distribute hooks more or less equally among survivors. This means that my games often get far along so there are times where I'll be doing really well and have everyone on death hook and once the first person dies the other 3 will just jump out through hatch because the SWF squad found a key and were able to get a totally undeserved win. That sucks.
---
And on the other side if you play to just get people out survivors whine and complain.
---
There's no winning here
---
Ikr....
---
I don't like how Ace's perks are luck-based. Luck is the most useless thing in the game
---
Tapp's perks are token-based (which is decent) but Tenacity would be good if the killer was too oblivious to pick you up. 
---
Quentin's perks (while ranging from mediocre to good) is the most useful out of the 3. Vigil is good but could use a buff.
---
neither
---
like i have them but not in my bloodweb
---
Haha, that's awesome. Good going.
---
Oh rip that's unfortunate 
---
This is the positivity this community need
---
That's pretty annoying as well. Although you at least have a choice of going up against a sfw, compared to an iridescent hatchet huntress.
---
Survivors are 4.
---
Killer is 1.
---
So if the killer takes all the fun, and make the game unfun for survivors , he's the one selfish. :)
---
I’ve had maybe like two survivors pull off a perfectly timed firecracker blind that made me drop the survivor.
---
Build idea :
---
Use insidious when you put surviours in tier 3 
---
And act as a illusion 
---
Works EVERY TIME 
---
Myers. Everyone seems to enjoy versing him and he's just as fun to play. One of the only killers that seems to universally scare players as well, he's thrilling. 
---
Patience, it refreshes at 12 AM UTC.
---
I don't like Leatherface at all, thanks to how everyone I have come across tends to play him.
---
isn't tunneling just chasing survivors?
---
I think it’s like 3 minutes
---
Wow. Someone got maaaaaad triggered here. 
---
Let's address your issues, besides the bad grammar and spelling. Going to skip the sentences that make zero sense.
---
"you're actually really very inexperienced or a massive hypocrite"
---
OR you're simply unable to refute my point appropriately, as the evidence would suggest.
---
"The games are too short-termed for mori's to be an actuall well-placed thing."
---
That's just factually inaccurate, especially given the extensive list of game slowing mechanics.
---
"Everyone enjoys the idea of Killers being able to kill Survivors by the hand."
---
Pretty sure about 1/5 the people playing in a single game actually enjoy this. Can you guess which one it is? 
---
"You don't even save time as the animations are actually taking longer than many people might expect."
---
And yet you still shortened one player's game by half in doing it.
---
"they're NOT MEANT to promote blunt gen-rushing"
---
The item literally 'rushes' the gen, or did you somehow miss that? Also, there's no such thing as gen rushing, unless you mean "survivors doing their objectives".
---
"The new BNP is there to provide a burst of repair speed when it's NEEDED"
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with what I was talking about. I was making a comparison between ultra rarities and how they affect the game, and you missed it.
---
"ONE Killer versus FOUR Survivors"
---
And as such, game has to be balanced for that. It's not "one guy gets it ezpz because he's solo".
---
"I've been playing this game since the official release"
---
A claim that any tard on this forum can make, and one that I highly doubt. Nevertheless, having played the game for an extended period of time does not infer in any way that you understand game balance. 
---
"But maybe it's just me"
---
*gasp* someone is making progress!
---
"just desire more Survivor buffs"
---
My original post was about CLEAR REAGENT being removed from survivor webs. You started down the path of "wahhh! Killers can't clear out all the fog!"
---
No, it acts like a sabotage so it's for 2 minutes
---
shirtless Myers. 
---
at high ranks as killer, don't mind if i do
---
Yeah but that’s the problem with this game. Someone is annoyed for one second = DC 
---
I shouldn’t have to protect survivors feelings and ensure they have a good time during my process of choosing my addons lol
---
And I mainly play survivor, insta down hatchets aren’t even that bad.
---
People who think legion is ok think balanced means “impossible to loop every survivor I see goes down not matter how bad I am”
---
thats what i mean, getting LOS on the survivor is easier on pc 100%. so i have to be more cautious. but yeah i think hes extremely good to watch if you’re newer
---
Leatherface for BBQ
---
Great tips
---
Amazon prime bout to steal that borrowed time....
---
115% for most. 110% for Legion, Huntress, Hag, and Spirit. 105%(iirc) for Nurse.
---
Basically. Apparently all killers on this reddit have rose tinted glasses super glued to their face so they think only survivors can be toxic and that lobby dodging is somehow different than DCing vs a killer you don’t wanna cs
---
I love it, but that hand in the last panel is just creepy. Could you imagine if his hands were backwards?
---
Derank.  More fun.  Not as much trolling.  It’s still there and will always be though solo queuing. 
---
That made me laugh out loud, nice spook!
---
DRIFT KING BILLY
---
skill checks on right mouse button seems easier than spacebar
---
I still get infuriated when you could've just smacked the survivor when he was damaged but instead you threw a hatchet at him 
---
Rejoice, my friend, for every upvote you receive is a brethren in faps. You are not alone.
---
So I get in a locker while injured and Claudette keeps trying to get me out.. the killer sees her in Bbq and comes straight to me!  Lol
---
she's from russia of course she's flexing
---
Fucking Evan. 
---
SLOW IT DOWN BABY
---
Why not?
---
And NOEF
