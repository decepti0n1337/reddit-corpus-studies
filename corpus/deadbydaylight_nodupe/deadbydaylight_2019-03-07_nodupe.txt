McLean congirmed in stream that new Fired Up goes up to 7 tokens - it includes the two extra gens that aren't necessary to escape, but activate once the exit gates are powered. 
---

---
So, actually, the end percentage is 21%, not 15%.
---
Same thing happens to my pal on PC. We restarted the computer, uninstalled and reinstalled , rest the internet but none of those have worked
---
im stupid for not noticing
---
Second, I need to conduct thorough research on this matter so that I may better understand how this will affect the future of the DBD meta.
---
I doubt people will agree with me because everyone likes to get overly mad at the game anyway. But if Jason ever comes to the game. I want him to be the most OP killer ever. I don't know how but I would love to see that. 
---
McLean confirmed in stream that new Fired Up goes up to 7 tokens - it includes the two extra gens that aren't necessary to escape, but activate once the exit gates are powered.
---
...yeah, that’s why I commented it.
---
Yeah I'd imagine that would be a good counter . A perk that causes you to scream and a perk that negates it.  
---
This kinda makes sense though doesn't it?
---
How do you know when you absolutely have to?
---
Nope
---
we just hate legion tbh
---
Its been littealy less then a day. Give it some time first. We dont know how she will play out in the long run. 
---
I think she seems at lest mid tier at least. 
---
Yaaaay &lt;3 That's really great work :D
---
I love Wraith's character design and his cloaking ability, yes it's not amazing but I enjoy it. At higher ranks you have survivors with all perks and plenty of experience so catching one usually equals one generator per catch unless you have ruin to secure 1-2 hooks before it gets destroyed or you play as one of the strongest killers like Billy, Nurse and Spirit. 
---
so u gonna say to a player where to stand?
---
if a killer is camping do gens and escape if u are on the hook or wait until u die to give your team few secs or disconnect and find another game
---
when i play as killer or a survivor and dont like something i disc and move on to another game
---
is like telling killers not to dodge swf groups
---
they will do whatever they like
---
If not affected and unhook you can infect them?
---
On hook*
---
You literally just said it trashes those 3 seconds. How is that fine?

I agree with this statement 100%, I was going to follow a guy  who was playing killer until I went on to his stream to see him talking shit about me for hiding instead of working on a gen that he was watching. The only other survivor was wandering around the map looking for a medkit while I was trying to  finish the last gen. It sucks when you have survivors talking shit on stream for not being able to butcher them all within 2 minutes and it also sucks when you have killers talking shit on stream for being scared in a game that's supposed to be scary &gt;.&lt;
---
Finally
---
It's real bad. Nobodys gonna get footage because it's not going to be used often at all
---
Being denied a double-pip as a result of the bullshit Hatch is bullshit, and is gonna tilt me so much!
---
Y tho?
---
The height isn't the issue, it's the width of his head. Imagine trying to look around with trees around you in a chase and having your pyramid nose hit a bunch of trunks
---
Tier of killers that are pains to deal with, especially at rank 1 (ascending order):
---
- Nurse
---
- Hillbilly
---
- Huntress
---
- Spirit
---
- Doctor
---
- Legion
---
- Hag
---
- Shape
---
- Cannibal
---
- Wraith
---
- Nightmare
---
- Trapper
---
- Pig
---
- Clown
---
Break line of sight.
---
I've been watching tru talent and he has been playing horribly as her.
---
After watching zubat for a but, she seems much nore balanced. I think we just gitta give her a try before we rule harly on any buffs or nerfs
---
Bull fucking shit hahahahha. EVERY time ive EVER seen a survivor DC its because they failed to PURPOSELY be toxic and bully the killer. Its because they fucking failed at being assholes on purpose and since they cant have their way they rage quit like pussies. Quit pretending you dont already know this.
---
Nah man I'm good, Ill keep on truckin and hope the punishments get more severe. And thats that.
---
When every game has the gens get done before my second hook.
---
Yeah you can puke on them while they are hooked or down to infect them. I did it just to test and it works.
---
I'm glad you like it that much! &lt;3 your comment made me so happy 
---
Rofl so what, whatre you gonna do about it homie? PM me for address if you want.
---
She just vomits into the mask and it fills up and leaks out of the sides, covering her face and chest in her own vomit
---
Ah, I guess I just don’t remember it being that way last time. I didn’t play the ptb too much
---
REAL TALK DO YOU NOT BUY THE PERKS THERE?  I FEEL AS IF PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH THIS DONT DO THIS OR JUST HAVE EVERY TEACHABLE UNLOCKED 
---
If anything's gonna change before release, it's this. Pretty much every Killer-main streamer has pointed this problem out. 
---
A perk counters another perk. It's fine.
---
You are looking at the endgame wrong. There are two places killer will check. If you don't know how to play immersed and hunt totem I do not know what to tell you.
---
NOED is not even close to the strongest killer perk. I wouldn't even put it in the top 10. It only affects 5% of the game, only catches bad survivors and has simple and clear counterplay.
---
&gt;but if the strongest survivor perk gets changed he strongest killer perk should too
---
That's not how game design fucking works. You change things that need to be changed because they are overwhelming or unfun, not because they are the strongest tools.
---
You know what gets me about survivors? Everything they complain about can be played around if you learn how to, but for some reason some of you just don't. you would rather whine that "OK, this thing has got to fricken go" when it is strong or challenges your playstyle.
---
This should have been with Jane
---
Thats obvious
---
I mean, I think all Claudettes I will see when the cosmetic releases will be using that cosmetic.
---
I wonder if the DBD porn sub will have vomit porn now
---
What the actual fuck. This is literally exactly what I predicted when talking to a friend when she was announced. Holy shit. 
---
This DLC is nothin but Legs and Ass...I'm pleased.
---
PINHEAD.
---
I get insulted either way it seems, a week or two ago when matchmaking was horrid I played killer (rank 18) against a group of rank 2-4's so I decided to meme instead. I just insidious camped my hex totem and nothing else. They all got away and thanked me for a good time. Next two matches I did the same thing and got shit on for it because I wasn't playing how they wanted me to. I will say the last match I did get a 3k and that was hilarious since I wasn't even trying....until they cleansed my totem that is.
---
That I did not try, but will test next time I am on.
---
Was it Kill Your Friends mode or normal PTB?
---
Putting them in alphabetical order just like the perks? Monsters
---
No no no, we need Herobrine
---
Pretty sure I saw the auras of survivors that equipped Calm Spirit.
---
Nah, not in a game where nothing but a bit of time is lost at worst. 
---
Again, once they add anything relevant to the game in terms of rank then yeah, sure, but right now rank is just a number and literally nothing else.
---
to test the new ranking system with a killer I'm actually good at.
---
Survivors are almost always forced to let noed happen. There’s no prior indicator of it, and if more than one person want to escape, they’re going to have to do all 5 gens.
---
Killers whined about DS because if you wanted to deal with it you had to run enduring. Now that DS is getting changed, I feel noed May be worth looking at changing
---
I dislike how underpowered she is tho...
---
I can't play the new thicc killer if I get no kills, otherwise, what's the point of the thiccness?
---
nope, has no effect, like the hatchets
---
Ghandi will be nice. Power will be nuking survivors.
---
The problem with the PTB system is it isn't just how good you are, it's if you got the opportunity to get the pip.  If a survivor suicides on the hook/dcs before second hook, killers CANNOT 2 pip.  If they get 2 gens and one survivor dcs, the killer CANNOT PIP AT ALL!  If your team doesn't get downed, you CANNOT 2 pip.  It's possible for all four survivors to do the gens and escape without being hit once and not pip.  This is obviously not intentional as the ranking system still wouldn't reflect skill, just luck on getting games that you were able to pip in.
---
This makes me want to plague all over my screen. 
---
I stream DBD, but dont have TTV in my name, and I am usually very complimentary. The people who watch my stream dont want to watch me bitching. They want to watch me enjoying my self. I am sorry to see that happens to you often. Just bring Moris with you! 
---
My guess is that the scarf is weighted incorrectly, so it causes the parts that aren't weighted to be drawn to the origin of the model (an area around the feet)
---
what should the numbers change to? im thinking like 7%increase per gen done. so that way it isnt better than brutal strength until the 3rd gen is done
---
His backstory doesn't exactly explain anything related to his power nor the looks. He must've been normal looking while working at the scrapyard, the bell is not explained, his weapon is his old Bosses spine and skull that he took as a souvenir. Which also didn't make sense because He didn't mind crime to happen as long as it wasn't him doing it, so when he found out he was involuntarily involved he went 'ballistic' which is the complete opposite of his character backstory, just doesn't make sense. I guess they just slapped some meh story because who's going to read that anyways and went with the flow. 
---
Probably just an issue with the engine update.
---
ye, the idea behind that, to make it harder to get to rank 1 is good, but it needs tweaks
---
Oh okay, thank god.
---
Who am I?
---
🤢
---
🤮
---
Well, you god-tier dipshit, when a company allocates resources for cosmetics they drain their coffers which would allow for money spent on actual *important*  things like bug fixes, and optimizing gameplay.   
---
I know shit-for-brains Simple-Jacks like you cant understand that money isn't infinite, so I'll forgive you, and sentence you to 1 day of studying how ecoomics works.   
---
Fuck off, prick.
---
Can someone fill me in on why it was changed? This was out of the blue imo
---
Easy there, Satan.
---
Then the answer should be obvious. Everyone wants to play the new killer, meaning there are much fewer survivors to fill the lobbies.
---
I want a flex offering instead, so all of my killers now flex in their neutral stance by just playing the "carrying survivor" animation.
---
Buff boys.
---
HERETIC!!!
---
&gt; Survivors are almost always forced to let noed happen
---
Survivors can literally disable NOED before it's ever activated, so no.
---
No. The numbers were joke and almost no one uses them even if they are a legion. Tganatophobia managed to slow just a few seconds and you always could just ignore them unless no one healed in the match.
---
I mean, it doesn't just heal you. It gives the killer the opportunity to literally become a ranged leatherface. However, the ptb has been out for less than 12 hours. I think that it would be best to wait at least a day or two before declaring the new killer as being anything other than new.
---
The description says “will tell and reveal their aura to the killer for 5 seconds”
---
A perfectly spliced video
---
Happened to me on normal PTB match.
---
It's almost like the ptb is made for feedback to help them optimize it, perhaps you should post on there actual forum on the ptb feedback maybe
---
Eesh. That ain’t good. 
---
If you’re just starting out it’s a great buff, though. Still don’t have both (or either) of those perks on all my characters. 
---
I really miss the chapter-themed cosmetic sets we used to get. 
---
The Fog Traveler set was carnival themed and featured a lot of characters. The Grim Matsuri set was Japanese themed and also had really cool looks for a lot of different characters.
---
Then the legion chapter and this chapter just had random crap for 2-3 characters 
---
Oh I know that. My issues with it is, rank means literally nothing. I get better players on my team at rank 7 as opposed to 1. The higher you are, the worse games you get. There is no incentive to be a higher rank, so people will derank to have much better quality games. That's what is wrong with this system. I'm sure there is more wrong with it too, but this is just what comes to mind.
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Way I see it is that it should respect people’s time; regardless of if it’s game 6 out of 12 or 1 of 3 in the night. Respecting people’s time is important. Maybe bans are too much like you say- but I feel a timer between games would make people think “ is this worth the 5-10 min wait” 
---
I was playing against plague with a buddy and nobody ever seemed to be injured because the fountains heal which is really strong for survivors
---
It’s not alphabetical, the wraith is second on the list lol
---
wHaT tHe fuCk thats cool. but how?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i actually preffered it as it was before. then i could choose when i wanted the fast vault
---
Yeah I was solo so idk if it's only a solo thing. 
---
I think he was making it more complicated than it had to be and was just trying to be too fancy with it. At her worst I think she’s a mid tier killer and with a nerf to survivors being able to heal at the fountains, or at least increasing the time it takes to do so could put her in the higher tier of killers. 
---
Normal. Lol. Weve gone passed kyf tier bugs
---
It says "reveals current location"
---
YEAH, WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH HER HITBOXES?
---
Riiiiiight. Those three aren't Chad enough to have ultra Rare add-ons. 
---
Especially with this new survivor, “haha lol dummy thicc guys” Jesus Christ it’s annoying
---
By 4% speed increase. Cool, I guess, yipee.Not that I’d ever use it on either of them.
---
Give me your amenities, bitch.
---
One thing I think I'd recommend is reducing the particle effects you can see while using vile purge. I like the move, but I can't even see where I'm shooting it right now.
---
They are giving it the same treatment as noed, except noed is a stronger perk in a game where they both activate, so it’s not as big of a deal really. 
---
Killers with less game time to have rank 3 is the target, and with no cleansing speed debuff from thrill, it just helps out newer killers when they decide to try different stuff from their mains. 
---
When BBQ is the only one console players can't get for free
---
If it did it's a bug because the perk just like the doctors madness makes you scream and calm spirit stops you from screaming
---
Maybe he’ll be “lucky” enough to not run into her 
---
This guy I mean: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ay3dfb/i_want_this_as_a_new_meme/ Also props to everyone who predicted this despite people being like, “you haven’t seen her in action yet!”
---
Unless you’re still pretty new, like me, and you’re stuck with a tier 1 version of those perks for way too long 
---
Usually about 2 weeks if I remember right. Maybe 3?
---
At least you get it somewhere.
---
Yeah that's been my experience so far. No perks vs good survivors.
---
 I finally got a 3k game recently, and still got a depip lol.
---
Yeah it's pretty useless unless you want to get bonus bloodpoints and still one shot down that's about the only use for it though
---
The way he said it I’m pretty sure he’s at the hatch waiting for the Claudette. 
---
Gore warning, maybe?
---

---
Well..for one...think about how much work she has to acaullty get it. She needs to hit someone with the first power, then she has to wait for them to cure themselves, then she has to walk over to it and get it, then she only has a limited time to use it. Its like a less reaible Tier 3 myers 
---
Gotta make sure no one is fucking with the patients in the hospital.  
---
That's Dr. Carter's job...
---
they need feedbacks to know the new system sucks?
---
No, not really. The new decisive only goes on the one person that was unhooked. And 60 seconds is super easy to wait out 
---
NOTE: YOU ARE NOT AT WAR
---
Forgive me ~~Father~~ ~~High Priestess~~ Entity, for I have sinned
---
I wouldnt see this as a issue for solo survivors, if the perks were covered, and it was kinda hazy so you couldnt see exactly where they were on the map. Itd give newer players as well as some people who want to learn to play killer
---
E_blanc
---
its bhvr ofcourse they dont test it at all
---
BP reduction on screen and show the BP goes to the camped player for each second they are camped. 
---
Yes, because you can clearly work on a gen while being chased. 
---
So I haven't tested it yet... but if I vomit on a locker someone is inside.... do they get ill?
---
Regardless, that's 125 points right there.
---
I do agree, for ruin I never saw much reason to run it unless I had the Tier 3 version. Just makes it more accessible to all killers instead of only affecting 2/3 people.
---
Thanathophobia is all but useless. The best thing is to ensure that survivors stay on one side of the map, so when it comes down to the last 1 or 2 gens they’re in a really small area. 
---
Survivors always yelped when they fell from high places :p 
---
Anyone knows which are the additional effects that the killer gains after interacting with the pools?
---
Seems interesting
---
Yeah, that’s a good thing
---
But.
---
Once again, people who camp don’t usually care about those things lol
---
The only ones who would care are newbies who camp because they still aren’t used to the game and don’t know what else to be doing. 
---
The experienced people who camp are either trolls, don’t care, or stupid as a stone lol 
---
To be totally honest, and let's all admit it.... rank is pointless in this game, so who cares? 
---
I'm rank 1, but does that mean anything?
---
Nice, thanks.
---
The actor for jeepers creepers is a predator so we will never get a chapter involving him
---
Watch out I think Jeff-Jeff likes you ~~why does this sound like fucking Jack-Jack from Incredibles~~
---
If your headphones are uncomfortable you're using the wrong headphones 
---
With the new changes you’ll actually lose BP in the chase emblem for every second you camp. 
---
I’m all in for making it harder to rank up but this is too much. Right now it’s completely dependent on the other side as well...
---
Braindead survivors, easy 4k? Safety pip
---
Killer doesn’t chase you all game? Depip/Safety pip
---
Killer doesn’t hook anyone so no hook saves? Depip/barely a safety pip
---
Killer chases you all game? Depip
---
At least with the current build you can still safety pip/pip if you get chased all game or if you get an easy 4k.
---
The PTB is actively punishing you for being good and/or the other side being terrible.
---
I hope they change this up or flat out return it to the current system.
---
At the beginning of the fall? 'Cause I know they make a grunt when they land, but now they yelp when they start falling.
---
Idk, just wanted to say something lol
---
Seconded. If somebody DC’s during a game, a random generator should be instantly completed to help the survivors out for the loss. 
---
"Three Thicc Latinas get penetrated from behind while Babylonian Princess watches."
---
I want to call out the Thirst. But at the same time, I too, low-key thirst for that beautiful pirate treasure.
---
I feel conflicted.
---
I feel like Corrupt Purge duration is probably pretty good.
---
But that does very little (not saying there should be more just that we should lose rank) 
---
I’m saying if they dc during a game, not before. Pretty big difference. 
---
They even detailed in panty lines it looks like.
---
Not every killer has to have similar type of strength. 
---
Everyone wants to play the killer, of course wait times are going to be long.
---
Oh? 
---
You know what would solve is problem? Dedicated servers... if only the devs had already announced those were coming. Oh wait they have!
---
Yeah, it's annoying... for everyone including the killer. But lets be real, if you're losing rank and "getting destroyed" it's because you're shitting your pants about the fact you're a player down rather than just playing as normal. A 3 person game means the equivalent of 1 generator has already been completed for you, if you actually play properly and do some gens (and avoid the killer) then getting the second gen necessary to get the hatch is do-able.
---
Do you suddenly find that you're always losing rank/getting destroyed if the Killer gets an early kill and you're down to 3 people that way too?
---
okay i cant fucking access the ptb but i want to play plague, can someone help
---
Yea, I feel it. I’m just mad because I was in a game where someone left and I lost rank.
---
Now there is no excuse to give Freddy various "bitch" lines when mori'ing someone.
---
^^yes ^^i ^^know ^^license ^^contracts ^^are ^^a ^^thing
---
Idk if you were around when Freddy came out but initially people were saying his power was OP so they nerfed him and how he’s arguably the worst killer. So far, I think this killer is great and I think the corrupt purge is fine. It isn’t OP and can be dodged by hiding around boxes, rocks, pallets, etc. If anything, they could maybe slow her slightly when she’s using the corrupt power but otherwise, I think we have a great killer.
---
True, but it comes straight up oppressive lol. I've been running it on Hag and her ability to set up around 3-4 gens and bring the game to a complete snowbally halt with Surveillance is insane.
---
Okay
---
This is like some scooby doo shit. Survivors go in one locker, pop out another. 
---
Not the actor but the director 
---
I'm sorry. I cant find anything on it. Would you mind providing a link? I gotta check this out.
---
I got 3k and a depip recently. I don't think I've had that happen before.
---
Also, the hillbilly and cannibal both have the exposed effect (insta-down) with their powers (chainsaws). Technically their main weapons are their hammers. 
---
Y'all gay. 
---
i apologize for saying it in such a dickish way but thats literally the point of "public TEST build"
---
"latinx" isn't a thing, stop trying to make it a thing
---
This is a great idea. How many times have we walked across to a gen at the start of the game and they're already popping?
---
Not like it's a big deal anyway. Literally all you need to do is just hide in a locker as soon as someone is downed and you're safe from it. 
---
Lol I wasn’t complaining, I play killer
---
once saw a wario as golden ace too lol
---
Okay 
---
It does, however, prevent Play with Your Food from losing stacks. Hatchets also used to do this until a change was made. This change will probably eventually happen here as well. 
---
I mean it's such an awfully designed system I'm shocked it has even got to the point of ptb. Also I'm posting this to a forum they no doubt read and that has a community of 95k, so it's not exactly worlds apart from what your suggesting.
---
And thats why OP is on a FORUM talking about the changes on a TEST build talking about what should be changed BEFORE it goes live. 
---
Yeah, they also have "mansplaining" and "manspreading" on there too, so I prone not to take them seriously at this point.
---
I get that, but I want to play her now... but she's unplayable right now...
---
Sorry, but yeah that's the reason we never will have jeepers creepers
---
Otay
---
Not true about the “don’t watch, can’t affect”. If streamers are creating and environment where they turn a blind eye to their community hate spamming someone, that could have physical repercussions. I agree with you generally but words can and do have an impact 
---
Freddy be like 
---
B I T C H Y O U T O U C H M Y S P A R K Y A N D N O W I M M A E N D Y O U B I T C H!!
---
you could also do it with 7 and 9 i think, and it happened to me a lot of times, however i think they should add the option to able it or not
---
How about you grow up and just accept that it happens? This change to the emblem system already fucks Killers over as it is. If he's camping, he doesn't care about pips anyways.
---
If no one gives them feedback, then the assumption is that the change is accepted. But, if you do give them feedback, make sure to be thoughtful.
---
If you say, "your new ranking system sucks. fix it". They'll most likely shrug and disregard. But if you say, "I don't like the new ranking system because it punishes me for X when it should be doing Y" they will definitely listen and take it under consideration.
---
I know this because I've worked on high profile projects as a developer with passionate audiences.
---
Yeah it only prevents screaming. It doesn't say it prevents aura reading.
---
A bottle of Shasta\* and a pat on the head  
---
\*errata: you must retrieve and pay for your own Shasta.
---
Pallets seem to be a big deal for me. I don't really get stunned a lot its just breaking them and losing line of sight. I will try to get those perks. 
---
Question, what do you mean by ardetha? 
---
I change the name of the movie so I can skip it completely when I load the game.
---
wait no, i think he's onto something
---
Yeah but this perk no matter what it says at the moment causes you to scream revealing your location it doesn't do aura reading
---
[The most brutal gift The Entity could possibly bequeath any of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBoesEFWZnM)

---
Im running ruin and bbq already. The people who want to gen rush usually cleanse my totem pretty early on to get rid of Ruin. 
---
ffs, she's not even out, it's the goddamn beta
---
Thank you. I am an altruistic player so I often run bond to find people to help on gens or heal. 
---
*Loud muffled Screaming*
---
It doesnt help when the cleanse it after the first gen. Hooking people helps but if i can't get to where i know the rest are they finish it. If it helps describe the situation im a low rank getting put against a lot of high ranks. 
---
Whoa relax. I’m just stating how I feel about the situation. I can state that I don’t like something about the game. 
---
And I don’t l think it’s a bad idea honestly. I’m a killer main when I’m solo (I was reminded why I dont solo survivor today). It’s fairly simple and survivors can’t ruin your game in the same way a camper does.
---
Just don’t think it’s fun to play like that for anyone.
---
There should be a certain timer on it, though. I still think Survivors should be punished for that one jerk who rage quits right before death hook. That's extremely unfair to the Killer, I feel, if all other survivors are *rewarded* for that. 
---
Too bad they're just decent. 
---
After playing her for a few hours she's just a delayed huntress.  
---
Maybe tweak her vomit to damage survivors if its on a gen/pallet/window vault .
---
Allow the vomit to hurt survivors if they dont cleanse
---
Also if you focus on genes while corrupted there's hardly a penalty to it so maybe Everytime they cough its an immediate failed skill check. 
---
Also hard truth pill right here, the plagues ability is literally legions .
---
Get hit , run away - mend or cleanse 
---
At least the plague looks dope and I love James 
---
Not true. If gens are done in five or six mins when I've been hooking and slugging its a rush. 
---
I was wondering about that. I was trying to not use the blood fountains to see if I could force survivors to stay sick, but ai guess that won’t work.
---
Lol. More like destruction 2. Only 49 more palets to go
---
*Yells in John Carpenter*
---
Crate of gears is nowhere near useless
---
Just went back and checked and it is the same as a madness or rancor blip it shows the current location as if they were screaming so calm spirit would indeed counter it since it isn't an aura reading perk
---
I can get a lot done if there are only one or 2 gens left. If they are close that is. 
---
I’m kinda scared that they probably would make her booty smaller😱😤
---
I swear the stunned me and i dropped and i dropped a auric cell. 
---
The instant heal at the pools should be changed. To me it feels like getting to someone to tier 3 madness as Doctor but having the survivors instantly heal when they snap out of it. It causes absolutely no slowdown.
---
Michael asserts enough dominance as it is.
---
Wholesome killer 101: make sure to meme and reference in the post game chat. 
---
Really? Im a S main and my god hitting r1 on survivor is so easy its not funny. Killers need a buff to make it a lvl playing field.

LOLOLOLOL

*its not FUNNY!* :’(
---
Pc, Xbox, what 
---
Literally all of those can be done by all the survivors. And even good killers can be genrushed, so... not sure what your point is there.
---
To be fair,she is the first character in the game to speak a sentence out,even if its a language no one understands
---
Dang, I was hoping it would last longer.
---
Running BBQ and Iron Will. Fuckin meta.

*swinging on a hook, covered in vomit and the blood points I haven't even got to spend yet as I'm vommited on repeatedly for one cheeky escape*
---
Yeee
---
I still get splinters and have all the killers &gt;-&gt; is that a bug
---
sorry about the awful, god awful screenshot quality... :(
---
You know, if Karen would have just left the kids we wouldn't need to watch them so closely
---
No one likes a spitter. 
---
- 115% movement speed + 32m terror radius, so usual stuff here.
---
- When she pukes on survivors, she makes them sick. Sickness has 2 tiers. Don't know the exact numbers, but the switch from sickness stage 1 to 2 speeds up if you vault, sprint, and presumably a few other things.
---
- She can puke on objects to infect them for ~20 seconds. If a survivor uses that item, it's as if they got hit by her vomit once.
---
- She can puke on already sick survivors (or they can use infected objects) to speed up the sickness even more. A single puke stream can hit multiple times, so with certain add ons (maybe even with perfect aim as "vanilla" plague?) you can send someone straight to T2 sickness in one go.
---
- Stage 1 only makes your survivor cough, that's it.
---
- Stage 2 makes your survivor broken (unable to be healed), they start vomiting (which is louder than the coughing) and they turn anything they interact with infectious.
---
- Survivors can cure their sickness from fountains, which cures both their sickness + their injured status
---
- After they use the fountain, it becomes corrupted + can't be used by the survivors again, unless the killer uses them too
---
- The killer is informed with a sound when a fountain becomes corrupted, so also doubles up as telling you where a survivor is.
---
- The killer can use a corrupted fountain to change her vomit to instead deal damage for... some time. It no longer infects survivors, but acts much like a huntress hatchet. Survivors are informed when this starts (or refreshed), and can see the killer glowing when active. No sound byte to tell you when it's over, though.
---
- This one can TECHNICALLY multi-hit, but the survivors I-frames after getting hit prevent it in most cases that matter (be prepared to see some seemingly bullshit double hits sometimes though) + can hit multiple people per stream. It's REALLY strong.
---
Honestly, people saying that the fountains make her weak don't seem to realise how strong her damaging puke is. Her regular puke is a SORT OF free-ish hit to start chases (it's hard to consistently get straight from 0-100 infection, and you might have to chase for a while otherwise), but the empowered version can down even healthy people super fast. Staying in the broken state is POSSIBLY a way to deal with her, but 1) it involves nobody else giving her access to corruption, and 2) she's still a 115% killer, so being broken all the time leaving plague everywhere (making stealth much harder) is risky.
---
Honestly I think she's strong. In a really good place, but it's still early days.
---
Thanks! This was really helpful. By the way, apparently you don't lose pwyf stacks if you puke on people. So you can be a 130% movement speed killer and able to damage people. They'll probably patch it tho
---
Lmao, thats awesome. Only knowing to quick swipe made me really good at reading were gonna run to.
---
It doesn’t take 4 people to go around map cleansing totems, chests lol. Also killers got addons / perks that can actually give them to having map pressure. Still Gen rushing doesn’t exist for Good or bad killers. 
---
Huge buff for thanataphobia wow! Tier 3 perk with all survivors injured is now 24%, that's practically Dying Light but applicable more easily!
---
Well if you still haven’t played the tutorials, play them now! You get free bloodpoints for completing them. :)
---
Not everyone has that kind of playtime my dude.
---
PC and PS4
---
"Childs Play" remake comes out on June 21st... Its ment to be.
---
You should play both tutorials, they're really quick and give a large amount of bloodpoints!
---
Oh nice. I’ll add you on ps4, my name is SlyMisterFox. 
---
Oh, neat. Thats very considerate of them. Who knows, maybe theres something that I don’t know about survivors.
---
Yep, my friend payed the same dude to make him one. 
---
Awesome thanks man
---
Why is this guy getting downvotes? All they did is miss a reference. There's a similar meme in the prequels so the confusion is understandable.
---
Hahah, nice
---
just as you counter leatherface, you can take sharp turns and lose line of sight to not get puked (you can also just make distance because the puke range isnt very big) 
---
Mama Mia that was a close one
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that could cause female Survivors to temporarily lose their running animation after pulling down a pallet.
---
RIP skating.
---
[**Saw here**](http://fun5.teesteam.xyz)
---
Thanks! Yeah she seems pretty strong(unlike spirit and legion on release). BTW m2 does not consume pwyf stacks. Alongside the red puke, that'll be devastating to have a 130% speed puking killer that can down survivors. Will probably get parched like the huntress pwyf hatches 
---
Yes they do.
---
You’re right, d strike was op and it needed a change. Self care was very strong and it got a very needed change. Noed didn’t expose people until t3 purple but behavior made it so everyone gets exposed at all levels. Noticing a theme?
---
Are you saying that 6/10 games survivors cleanse all 5 totems because I’m respectfully calling bullshit. I play survivor mainly, and I cleanse the totems I see but I rarely go totem hunting when there’s no active hexes and gens to be done. Should I spend time on the perk that may or may not exist or the objective that I am required to do in order to escape?
---
The mods here don't follow their rules unless they dislike a post. 
---
Neither is the frame rate :'(
---
McLean was on Jendenises stream today and said its a buff. He mentioned theres more thean 5 gens, theres 7. Once all 5 are completed, it goes up to 21%. 
---
The wording just makes it sound weird and people don’t take into account the other two. 
---
That's Neil Breen, he is the writer, director, and star of his films. They are.... Something else....
---
If you read what I said then there was no point in restating it unless you were trying to say you agree with me... which you could’ve done better.
---
Anyways, I wasn’t trying to insult you. Apologies if you felt that way.
---
Back to the game. I imagine they are just like “I gotta secure this kill”. I get it, being a killer can be hard (I’m a rank 1 killer btw), but I see why people complain about killer. I’m all about the bloodpoints as a killer so I play fair (in my opinion) and I give others the chance to play.
---
THICC
---
They explained the turn to darkness in the stream, but I'm not sure if its visible in game
---
Maybe im just unlucky, but yeah. Either they cleanse all the totems or they pop it before anyone gets found.
---
And NOED has been overpowered before. They changed it. Now it is not.
---
&gt;Should I spend time on the perk that may or may not exist or the objective that I am required to do in order to escape?
---
If it is bothering you that bad, maybe you should.
---
He’s a DBD content creator 
---
All the posts about how one person can't cleanse all the totems to avoid NOED would like to have a word with you. 
---
Of course genrushing exists, for both good and bad killers. Multiple gens can still pop simultaneously during the first chase.
---
My friend still won't stop struggling when he's the last alive and so killers always hook him. He doesn't understand why killers always seem to give me the hatch despite explaining that you're not supposed to struggle lol. Killers aren't usually complete assholes, and if you accept your loss with dignity a lot of them will respect that.
---
I'm guessing the Plague drove her mad? Kinda like syphilis? I dunno otherwise...
---
* Fixed an issue that caused the Trapper's Logwood Dye and Tar Bottle add-ons not to darken traps from Survivor point of view.  
---
you gotta be kidding me, does this mean i've been wasting an addon slot this entire time whenever I played trapper
---
Usually because they wanna try the new perks on some of the other killers. If they aren’t doing that they’re just an asshole
---
If you're new it's important to pick a survivor with good perks like claudette or Meg, while staying away from survivors with crap perks like ace and Quentin. Other than that, no reason. Survivors are just cosmetics 
---
That’s not a standoff, he’s alone at the hatch...
---
Same struggle other games face and they seem to do ok. Dead by daylight not making enough money is not the problem either, they have skins and killers/survivors which are purchase exclusive. The idea they couldn’t afford it seems a bit far fetched to me.
---
Just because he doesn’t see the survivor doesn’t mean she isn’t nearby. She could just be hoping he leaves thinking she’s working on a gen. Ergo still a standoff. 
---
It's crazy I got 2 survivors killed early game and killed the third one at end game and I de piped one away

Are we not gonna talk about how the Plague's teeth and esophagus must be completely fucked up due to how often she vomits?
---
The Halloween dlc is actually good, Laurie is cool and Myers is awesome. People actually want it whereas nobody wants leatherface but his perks are sick and he has bbq so ofc they're not putting it in the shrine. They want their sweet money(watch it be in the shrine next week because I said this)

its only buffed when all gens get done tho

did they actually nerf fire up?

Surveillance is pretty dang good, but honestly, I'd use Overcharge over it. Yeah, it's a gamble perk where as Surveillance guarantees you to see what's going on where, but I like to roll the dice a little!
---
David and Jake got cosmetics with the last chapter (and Jake for the last three chapters.)
---
When you're sick, and you reach maximum "sick", you get the broken status effect and are injured I think. Interacting with the pool allows you to "insta-sick" someone to maximum "sick" effectively being able to damage a full health survivor to injured with one vomit (I believe)
---
rest in piss
---
Yeah you go in knowing that best case scenario your gonna get one or two hooks in before it’s gone. Potentially you could go overkill with the gen protection and get perks like surveillance and Overcharge or Pop Goes the weasel to supplement Ruin. 
---
I don't see how that is an exploit
---
Really? So she's the first acolyte of the entity in a way... hmm... interesting.

except doing that as pig isnt viable at all, why do you want to nerf meme strats
---
Oh cool, like a normal person 
---
Ruin is pretty annoying at all levels as it was, bc it was still effective at slowing down gen completion. I rarely see baby ruins as it is, but I see goddamn ruin in almost every match. Lil baby ruins are like lil precious gifts that come along once in a blue moon. A buff for Ruin is unnecessary, especially with the new gen-f♡◇♧ing perk about to be rolled out with the plague that will surely become meta.
---
Ok
---
Use landscape mode on mobile, then whenever a Skillcheck appears press  the empty background.
---
I agree with this, it's a nice change and it makes noed less of a pain in the ass. I also really like it because in solo survivor no one cleanses totems, so noed is pretty much guaranteed.
---
Personally, I think noed in swf is fine. If you're playing swf on coms and don't cleanse totems, you have no one to blame but yourself. In solo however, they do not tell you how many totems are left in the map(that needs to be base set in game) and everyone is super uncoordinated(3 survivors go for the save because no one knows who is going and who's doing gens) so cleansing all the totems takes a lot of time. So noed on solo is annoying asf
---
To the naked eye it seems to run at a full 60fps in the tutorial.  Very smooth.  Was kinda painful when they introduced the tutorial and you'd do that then go into the regular game and it's back to 20-30fps chop fest.
---
that's a good point, they're trying to fix their flawed game design I guess! tiers were always awful
---
*Ebony mori* "Its prime time bitch!"

Mmmm go 👏👏 and get that 😍 Mummy 😍 🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯👌💯🏃‍♂️💨

McClean said it's not a nerf it's a buff. It now counts all generators when they;'re completed, as in, all 7 generators on the map count for this perk making it's max 21%. WTB developer notes so we can get this information outside of being in random streamers chat when McClean says these things.

For real lmao.

Thanks, I really appreciate
---
If infectious fright becomes meta so will calm spirit. I’m ok with that.
---
You realize by the cleaning speed remains the same they mean the debuff doesn't go any higher. They didnt get rid of the debuff completely it just doesn't go higher. Then again if you read it in the actual PTB I'll apologize since I dont get internet to check it in game till tomorrow.
---
Yep, on the new map. I played against the anti-vaxxer and kept changing lockers on her. It was fun.
---
Yep, after mouse binding is ready, I'll add support for controller
---
"lets reward you for killing them as slowly as possible" ?

This killer just seems silly, it's Mori, her ability, the way she looks it just seeks out of place, some missed opportunities. Her ability is really weird and I didn't know someone can puke 20 feet far

Yes but the vomit goes away in a few seconds so is not like it matters much. 
---
I need to see Jane and Dwight wearing their where's Waldo outfits. 
---
It’s not a standoff until the killer sees the survivor. Until that point is reached the survivor can play against the killer without risking it all if they leave the hatch. 
---
When people get downvoted for saying okay. Thanks guys.
---
It's just random made up shit btw 
---
And? In a long run its still a buff. Im more so talking to those acting like it was a nerf to all stages and only gave a 1% buff when they were all completed. (15%). 
---
This made me laugh lmao
---
I'm going to miss that obnoxious intro. 
---
BY THE POPE
---
The mechanic is not new, but the red bar is.          
---
Yes, that is why you see a red bar.        
---
I'm not sure why they are punishing teaming up. Perhaps it's due to some of the advantages I mentioned on another reply: you know exactly where your teammates are and it's harder for the killer to find you all since you're in the same location compared to being all spaced out across the map.          
---
Yes, I believe the modifier does decrease efficiency with more people. Each person does 80% repair speed when there are three of you (240% rather than 300%) and 70% if there are four of you (280% compared to 400%).

---
Does it look like it?
---
Jesus asserting dominance
---
I would say a big part of why no one talks is immersion, rather than localization issues. Having English voice lines while the game is in French or having someone speak Japanese while you're reading everything as English happens all the time in many games and other media. Having a lack of direct prepackaged voice lines helps each player express themselves entirely through their actions. Each Laurie or Trapper you face is an entirely different character than the one before.
---
Would be cool but also way to overpowered
---
You've got to admit, in most cases.. They Have greatly improved.. 
---
Yup
---
Close! The new killer lmao
---
One of the main point of running kindred is if you are facecamped The survivors  know to just do gens though 
---
Damn, I get games in like 5 minutes
---
But it does infect the totems for about 30 seconds I think.
---
Current PTB that I saw has the time gens are locked out at 80/100/120 seconds.
---
It’s a joke ); 
---
That's like a thousand
---
They should've typed "Fixed the audio level of the Halloween music during the camera intro when loading into Lampkin Lane", then made it even louder lol
---
Squad Goals.
---
&gt;To amass Bloodpoints, because you have to grind the Bloodweb on PTB for some reason
---
That being said the reason I don't touch the PTB is because there are some *wonderful* people who view it as "time to stomp noobs who have literally no perks with my OP killers and not lose my OP addons or offerings." The thing that turned me off the PTB was a match where I went against a Hillbilly running Purple addons, top tier perks, and an Ebony Mori. This was during the Spirit PTB so everyone was playing Adam with level 1 Autodidact and level 1 Diversion figuring out how those perks worked.
---
3 people DCed. The person he moried and two others. I just went AFK after that. Uninstalled the PTB immediately afterwards.
---
You should just have 10k Bloodpoints for free when the PTB daily starts.
---
Fire up is a core part of his Myers build. I'm not sure why. It was never that great to begin with and I know he has better perks to use but for some reason he believes that fire up and bamboozle is mandatory for killers.... He gets caught up on the T&amp;L loops so much and always takes the longest way to end that jungle gym loop. He gives survivors a free escape through the L wall every single time and wastes so much time at them. I like the dude but damn that shit annoys me when I watch him play.

ty, I'm glad you found it nice ;v;
---
Selling my soul to never play on Sheltered Woods ever again.
---
Yea I’m ok with it. As a survivor player I kinda think ruin is underwhelming. The fact everyone feels they have to run it makes me think something in the games core is very wrong
---
Imagine if Legion actually had the ability to look like one of the survivors in the game (maybe the obsession). Where they could pretend to do generators  and things that survivors do. Sounds scary asf
---
FUCK THE MATCHMAKING OF THIS GAME

I'M A NEW PLAYER AND CERTAINLY NOT OF RANK 10 OR LESS, BUT I FOREVER GET MATCHED UP WITH RED RANKS AND GET ABSOLUTELY SHAT ON....

New candy man is in the works? Halloween sequel came out last October? Hate to say it but this likely doesn’t mean anything.
---
I like the phrase when Monto says it, but now that it's been acknowledged as a little meme everyone tapes the "just a little bit" part onto the end of every sentence. It looks forced... just a little bit.
---
Wonder how he saw me with no eye holes 
---
Still awful either way. Having the exit gates available is game over for any non-endgame build, and most of the pallets are likely already gone by that point so you won’t be using fire up much at all.
---
I played these guys last week! Good game
---
Also probably die
---
I also thought this, but I remembered from other games that T-bagging usually isn't a friendly thing, so I stopped doing it thankfully.
---
ty and I definitely might do it, I already have a few ideas on how I wanna do certain characters ;u; 
---
Like a fuckin sprinker if ypu just look up and spew
---
dc
---
There was effort put into this 
---
I honestly love that perk so much, it definitely became one of my favorites x'D
---
Honestly, I think the best killer rank system was the victory cube. It was based on your results, your kills. Not if you kicked a generator.
---
New pip thresholds though

why

---
Healthier for the game but DS is now a shadow of its former self. It’s akin to deliverance now, a “get me back in the game” perk with conditions to meet. 
---
It also now does something when only 1 gen is done
---
You're missing the point. Indeed, there *are* 4 other players than the killer. Somehow, a killer needs to deal with 4 people at the same time. I explained in the main post that you don't have time to hook one person, leave and hook another, and vice versa. You can't just say "Just don't tunnel and camp" because not doing it doesn't work. As it is now, Survivors have the tools to win most engagements with killers, and now the devs are taking away some of the core strategies that allow killers to win without giving them anything in return.
---
I'm not saying that the fun of survivors doesn't matter, but killers need the tools to be able to win. 
---
That’s even worse!
---
Do you even play killer
---
That’ *snot* a bad idea 
---
Therapy
---
Not bad.  I will be buying a few of these.  
---
I stream and it depends on what level of bullshit I deal with, if it's a good spooky game they get compliments. If they are a giant dick and camp and shit, I'm gonna be a bit grumpy. Some of my best friends are former killers. 
---
I thought I was having a stroke reading this post title
---
Maybe not for this guy
---
With her placement on the roster select she's also pushing herself on Myers and trying to get Huntress out of the picture.  What a JEZEBEL.  
---
Srry man bad english
---
Legion IS weak, only thing that makes him strong is franks mixtape and how obnoxious he is to play against.
---
unfortunately 😔
---
Should’ve replied “You’re”
---
I got them as fellow survivors once or twice. They got down pretty quickly. Overall not impressed. 2 out of 5: Would not recommend.

Every survivor ever: “I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that”
---
Hey can someone explain this to me? All I'm seeing is a default Jeff
---
pull out the gun
---
its a nerf because its a lesser amount during prime time of the game 2-4 gens completed after 5 its game over
---
1.1. *uses "his power is bad" as an argument as to why Freddy's power is bad*
---
1.2. No, they aren't. They take way too long to make a deadzone of any sort of size, and they have no stall to back it up. Freddy does, which makes him better at setting deadzones up in time.
---
1. Disagree. B tier is where I draw the line at viability. Of course every killer has counters. Even Nurse does.
---
2. Sprint Burst exists, this is true and perhaps the only time Freddy is not guaranteed a hit or pallet drop. However, you don't lose anything by sleeping them. They are now off of gens and exhausted, and you can go do whatever while you wait for another opportunity to sleep them again. And by the time they wake up (which you admitted doesn't take long) they'll still be exhausted, meaning you can come back and transition them again to get a hit or pallet drop. Clown is good at getting pallet drops, I agree. But he simply can't do it fast enough, and it's not even his fault - it's the fault of bad game design and map design that screws him over.
---
8.2. It's meant to be an anti-loop ability, but the slow you get from the bottle simply does not cut it. It doesn't make chases that much faster, so the result is a mediocre chase-based killer with nothing else going for him. Nurse, Billy, Hag and Spirit have mobility. Huntress has insane chase and some form of map presence in the form of crossmaps. Freddy has stall. All of Clown's eggs are in one basket - chasing - and his power doesn't help him chase effectively enough. If there were less pallets? Yes, Clown and Bubba would be significantly better. If gen times were balanced? Also yes! Clown and Bubba would be good. But as it stands, they cannot chase fast enough - and you NEED to chase fast if you have no other forms of pressure - to be a good killer.
---
8.3. Since when? You used Sprint Burst as an argument against Freddy, so I'll use it as an argument against you. I'll also use the argument of "survivors have eyes and most maps are open" against you.
---
1. Not putting Hag in Playable Tier? Disagree. Heavily. You value chase power over anything else, yes? Hag has very similar chase potential to Nurse - the only difference is that she has to set up her web. But let me tell you as a Hag main that including 4-5 gens in your web is not hard in the slightest, even on larger maps. And if a survivor triggers a trap in your web? Game over. Then the other survivors have to venture into your web to save them, and if they trigger a trap? Or you find them? Game over. 
---
Putting them to sleep isn't bad for Freddy either, because it wastes their time. Each transition is likely (perhaps not guaranteed, but extremely likely) to net you a hit or pallet drop.
---
Freddy can force drops and get ez kills just by M1, giving him pressure while he is making deadzones. Clown has no answer to someone who is simply camping pallets. Yes, he forces them quickly. Is it quickly enough? No. Nurse has an answer to forced pallets. Hag's answer to forced pallets is to catch them before they even get there with an ITH trap. Billy's answer is to chainsaw it and move the phuck on, because he'll find another survivor in a worse position thanks to his speed. Spirit's answer is to mindgame the pallet. Huntress chucks a hatchet. Freddy does not have a direct answer, but his stall means that he doesn't need one. Clown. Needs. Stall. To. Create. Deadzones. He cannot get a down against experienced survivors without deadzones already up.
---
Freddy's slug is amazing, because if they walk up to the slug and heal them before you pull them into sleep, you get two people asleep. His inherent Deerstalker means that you can safely leave slugs on the ground to go harass and sleep other survivors, then come straight back and hook them when you have some time to kill. Works with any amount of survivors.
---
How so? What is your overarching goal as Freddy? *How* do you win?
---
Billy doesn’t have any so he could use some
---
I didnt know he was getting one this chapter I'll have to hold my money till I see what it is I was thinking about getting his halloween one.
---
Agreed.
---
Throughout the game, yes. You get 1% speed after all generators are done, but you have less speed throughout the rest of the game. 
---
I was scared for a moment after hearing that devs won't help if eac do the ban thing
---
From what I'm hearing, it's an awful system. I play on console so I don't see any of this stuff, but this seems to be too punishing for most people from what I hear. Saw the patch notes and man, they made ranking up a fucking pain in the ass.
---
You spend the time walking from a fountain to a target which loses at least 15 seconds...
---
It's so the killer doesn't have to stand there and do nothing the whole time. The struggle points are just an incentive to not kill yourself on hook and let teammates save you.
---
Freddy's taking the right out of my mouth!

Downtime In The Fog: Poker Night. 
---
Unknown to the surviors in the realm of The Entity, some of the murderous killers attempt to hold onto their human backgrounds. Frank, Evan, Kenneth and Anna could find spare moments to look back at sense of normality to hold poker games against each other. In a smoky shack in the far corners of the Fog, they could meet to take some of the edge off between trials of murder. 
---
Frank flung his cards onto the table, a messy combination with no winning luck. “Fuck. I never get any good hands. How can I keep losing like this?!” His trusty knife sat in a pile of other objects everyone used as betting collateral to Up the nights Ante. Kenneth let out one of his trademark laughs from deep in his stomach, taking a long drag from one of his cigarettes. 
---
“Kid, you couldn’t murder butter with the way you use that knife. Let the real men show you how it’s done.” He reaches forward to turn over the River. King of Spades. Kenneth’s hand held the makings of a three of a kind. Tonight he may actually beat Evan. 
---
Across from him, Evan truly mastered his poker face. He used his mask every night but could read the others like a book. He lifted his mask for a moment to take a drink of whatever strange concoction Kenneth brought for the evening and pushed more chips forward. For a brief moment, you could catch his grin spanning across his face like a twisted Cheshire Cat. “All in.” His voice was rough and powerful years of barking orders and metal twisted into him gave him a commanding voice.
---
Eyes shifted to Anna next. She was always the quiet one at the table. No mindgames, but she could play powerfully when she had it. Seeing that king made her heart race and she unloaded a pair of hatchets and slid them onto the table, not a word to be said. 
---
Kenneth wasn’t going to get cheated out of this nights hand. He’d been bamboozles by these buffoons too many times. While he leaned back he silently opened a bottle of his strongest tonic, trying to get some of its pungent odor into the heads of his opponents. His heartbeat quickened as he leaned forward to grab the last card, hoping to ‘accidentally’ knock some of it over to cause a distraction. 
---
“Don’t play is like idiots, I see that bottle, fatass!” Frank reached out for his knife, leaping onto his chair in exclaimation. Evan stood y’all and fast, Machete at his side. It didn’t take long before everyone was armed up and tensions were high. In the second before the next reaction, the air was filled with smoke, tonic and high Adrenaline. Kenneth’s lips widened to a fat smile under his facepaint. He smashed the bottle on the table and a wide cloud of gas quickly filled the room. 
---
No one could really tell what was being punched, stabbed and choked out that night, but they knew this wasn’t as bad as some of their other nights. 
---
Ehhh I mean, you just go for the person unhooking not the person getting unhooked? Even at red ranks I *usually* try my best to make things fun for the survivors. Unless the person getting unhooked has been a total toss pot all game, instantly downing them again isn't fun for either side. 
---
so its slightly better but only when the exit gates are open and worse before hand, off-brand brutal strength has been nerfed
---
Unless the wording is deceiving, are we going to gloss over the fact that Devour Hope now just gives you a speed boost at 2 tokens?
---
By the sound of it you just get the boost permanently instead of just after hooking.
---
I also lobby dodge them. They’re always the most toxic while also running easy perks. It’s weird how they have giant egos, but run things like DS and BT and stuff like that. 
---
And, on top of that, they’re usually with two other people or even a whole 4-man SWF. Noooo thanks. 
---
Oh no, it's broken on both killer and survivor side. It's now just a pain in the ass to even safety pip, let alone actually pip.
---
Hopefully won't come to live.
---
its still shitty brutal strength 
---
She's actually well-balanced, in my opinion. Out in the open, she'll get one good puke (75% of one Purge and you're broken) then down you. She can be looped about as well as most killers. I am really excited to get to play her, honestly. 
---
literally why
---
&gt;you need all gens done to get the same vault speed as bamboozle and it wont even block the window "OMEGALUL" 
---
Fire Up is not a solo perk, it is something you use in combination with something to make it better, like Brutal Strength or Bamboozle. 
---
Does calm spirit silence puking noises? 
---
not enough gay shit
---
Noed was overpowered in the sense of brand new parts were overpowered. It needed a change to become something like a hex totem. If a perk on its own can routinely give a killer a free kill, it needs balance. Just like how dstrike gave survivors a free escape and needed balance. I don’t want to delete noed, I’d like to see it slightly toned down so other killer perks can feel more viable.
---
i hope all the people that were bitching about bdsm dwight and shirtless myers arent offended by this too lmao
---
I want to try that
---
is there any way to download the beta and play normal dbd while its downloading? 
---
Wraith and Freddy.
---
Get a 4 man to stack Kindred. It was amazing before at 40m, now its 48m?
---
In love
---
It's 10 seconds after hooking according to the description in game. 
---
I wish skill checks were actually this smooth in game, you need to simulate the jitteriness that happens in game lmaoooo
---
I think PTB version should just give everyone 1 mil BP and all teachables unlocked. Or alternatively give us public matchmaking for KYF where all perks / addons / whatever are unlocked.
---

---
As I said in my post,  I know that'll happen. But some of us can get away,  or at least get the extra struggle points everyone else gets. Is all I'm saying. It doesn't take long at all,  literally a extra min if that. 
---
That was not an issue that was a feature! D:&lt;
---
Can confirm I was the Mario... We also wore better pants.
---
Had a huntress follow us all around, just playing games. In a party of three we thought we had a chance to get the trophy where everybody escapes through the hatch
---
Messaged the random guy what our plan was.
---
He said “ok kewl”
---
We repaired all the generators and found the hatch...
---
“Crap we need a key!”
---
We let the random guy know our problem
---
“I’ve got a key”
---
“Guys! ‘Jared5739957626’ has a key!!!!”
---
Then we escaped. It was such a moment
---
"LUCK SACKS" made me lol. 
---
I'm that person that never stops playing Myers and joins PTBs just to continue playing Myers and fuck with people's expectations
---
I tried it out by my self to use a own intro  but after the intro i got a eac(Easy Anti Cheat) message and the game closed. Did u use a bypass or did they changed their anti cheat? 
---
the only guide is this
---
dont buy this game
---
Yeah yeah because those who play killers snafus think that killers are weaker than survivors.
---
No that is a pc exclusive. If you own deathgarden and dbd you are given that mask. But deathgarden hasnt went to console yet.
---
I’m curious to know what happened
---
Dwight will get Head On orgasm! 
---
No I'm not. You are not meant to 4k each and every time. Or winning everytime. 
---
I sometimes get 3k with Trapper and sometimes 0k. Never have I felt the need to tunnel or camp. I drop them at the hook and I leave.
---
You want the killers to get the easy way to manage 4 people. It doesn't work that way. It is difficult but you are already stronger and faster than the survivors. 
---
ok, I was ready to have a heart attack if it was accurate to how it was worded in the notes. Getting an overall speed boost after the 2nd unhook only to easily snowball into insta-downs and Mori's didn't sound fun.
---
The last two gens do count.
---
Wow, that's actually pretty slick!
---
It's honestly not that impressive IMO. She knocks them down, says some stuff, grabs them, pukes in their face, and the knocks them down again.
---
I would've loved if she said more prayers and The Entity stabbed the Survivor in the chest or something. Or if mid prayer she puked all over them.
---
Hope they make the Mori better for final release. We went from Clown's "I step on your head a bit", to Spirit's "omae wa mou shindeiru", to Legion's street mugging fight, to a Mori I honestly think is worse than Trapper's.
---
Ah, didn't catch that you were using the female qualifier. 
---
Except I’m talking about their power not their weapon. It seems like nobody actually took the time to read what I said. 
---
i mean isnt he? how do you counter a killer who just guns you down so easily without rushing lol. the new perk is just going to make him even more disgusting.
---
Say "Harder daddy".
---
Barely even a buff. All they did was give it qol 
---
Quick &amp; Quiet doesn't always guarantee a successful locker juke. Also, Enduring exists.
---
Or there’s always the intended purpose of escaping the basement after a risky save. I don’t know how many times I’ve been stuck in the basement wishing there was a way to stun the killer after a save. 
---
"This fucking killer is actual trash ^but ^I ^suck ^worse ^so ^fuck ^him"
---
-Every toxic survivor ever
---
I doubt that's the "intended use", but that could be a thing.
---
it is for people who think it actually matters. latino is what every nonamerican born hispanic person uses.
---
Dat Franklin’s do. That flashlight’s staying with Bubba. 
---
&gt; Latinx 
---
lmao.
---
Testing the new perks on killers would be why I would. The one that gives out my terror radius while playing Myers for example. Run that with Knock Out in EW3.
---
Is that supposed to be a pun(holy shitpost)?
---
We'll see how people adapt. At least "gen rushing" and camping will be far less viable (if at all) at high ranks, which is good, I think.
---
wtf
---
I don’t see what else they could have had in mind when they made it. All the new perks have been reactionary to common problems players have been having. Plus all the top streamers and YouTube came to the same conclusion. So I’m sure it was in fact the intended purpose. 
---
I’d continue to look for more recent YouTube videos from established players. TrU3ta1ent is pretty prolific and gives you plenty of gameplay to learn from. OhTofu has some really helpful videos talking about how to run tiles. 
---
Generic starter advice: 
---
Don’t think surviving is winning as a Survivor. You want to be repairing gens, cleansing hex totems, healing and unhooking teammates, and wasting the killer’s time. Don’t play so scared that you spend time basically hiding for large segments of the game. 
---
Buy Leatherface as soon as you can afford him and level him up to unlock his BBQ &amp; Chili perk. He’s a good killer to start out with anyways, and that perk is so valuable to help you grind. Don’t be afraid to give up chases with skilled survivors while you’re getting better. 
---
Have fun and be patient with yourself while you improve!
---
I just left. I think they knew I couldn't pick them up so they held the game hostage for fun. Kept my add-ons at least.
---
try looking up YouTubers like Monto, for Killer Gameplay or Noob3 for Survivor 
---
Well it’s certainly not Jane either. She sounds like she just ran a marathon after like 2 steps. 
---
This so much. Don't even get me started on the corn.
---
Wanting to stun the killer with a locker in the basement isn't exactly a "common problem". I can't think of one time I've wanted a locker to do that. At any rate, the basement should stay, you know, dangerous. 
---
Spread these cheeks !
---
I guess it's hard for a lot of survivors to not see the Killers as AI, and I sorta get that, so out of nasty habit some peeps start casually shit talking forgetting they are actually going against a real person. But I admit I do the same thing against survivors too, instead of saying the player's actual name I just end up saying whoever they are playing as.
---
I came across these same guys!!! Took a screenshot as well, at least probably the same dudes (named and dressed the same)

I don't think I've ever seen a Michael with NOED. Maybe a few times. How is this true at all?
---
128m is unlimited, maps aren't this big.
---
Not wanting to. But needing to stun the killer in the basement. I bet if you took a poll on how many people have, on several occasions, gotten trapped in the basement after a dating rescue, you’d feel really silly for saying it’s not common. 
---
He could just be Japanese. 
---
How in the world...?
---
THAT IS SO SAD
---
Uh, hooking people until they die? I don't understand the question.
---
So is this gonna ruin my fire up, brutal strength, and bamboozle combo on Myers?
---
Mmm, no, I wouldn't. Also, you "bet". So you're just pulling what ifs out of your ass.
---
And so when you bring up a point, it's "wanting" to. But when I refute it, it's suddenly "needing" to. Nah. 
---
Who is that Nox guy at the top left? Also I have a 17 inch anus pls respond
---
It’s actually 21% now that it counts all 7 after the fifth gen is completed
---
Kind of a bug, you only stop getting splinters by purchasing the DLC with money, if you buy them separately with auric cells it doesn't register in the game files that you own them. 
---
Something you "FUN" advocates keep forgetting is the killer and the survivors are COMPETING.  As in, we're fighting with each other.  We're not holding hands and singing about sunshine and rainbows, we're fighting to come out victorious over the opposition.
---
It cannot give a free killer. Killers still have to catch you. Your team still has to not save you. It doesn't just kill you. NOED is not a good perk, I do not know what you don't understand about this.
---
I don’t take anyone seriously who says “nah” at the end of a sentence. It’s like a poor attempt to sound cool. 
---
after seeing the 5000th post about Jane and thicc in the same sentence it feels like I'm stuck in Doc's tier 3 madness and I am losing my mind here
---
if only. im assuming he was just mad cause it was gay shit and not this.
---
1.1 ??? I said other killers have better powers.
---
1.2 They take the same amount of time as freddy. As long as it take for a survivor to drop a pallet. Clown's power is actually a portable temporary deadzone. Stall is not good if you cannot chase.
---
1. No. The best survivors will always win unless it is Nurse or Spirit. Sometimes billy, map dependent.
---
2. Freddy is not garunteed a hit or a pallet drop if there is a window or the survivor starts running loops.
---
8.2 bottle slow is not bad unless you hold it. Bottle actually gives you free hits and pallets unlike freddy. Chasing is the only basket you want eggs in, because it is the only thing that really matters. Stall, Mobility, presence, all of that is not good unless you have chase. I do not know why i have to keep fucking repeating myself.
---
8.3 If a Myers or a Pig plays correctly they can get hits or gen pulls before the survivor even notices, unless it on a gen in the middle of nowhere.
---
1.Hag has counters. Nurse and Spirit do not.
---
Wasting their time is not as impactful as wasting yours. You are on a time limit. They are not.
---
Everyone can bait pallets like Freddy. Stall is not good without chasing.
---
You get two people asleep, one is gonna get away because freddy can only chase one person at a time. Then they get back on a gen and you have just missed out on a hook. Sure he can break off of a slug to go chase, but if someone decides to heal that slug you lose it.
---
Same!
---
Because maybe I see every Myers run NOED? People seem to agree. 
---
What ? Im not angry at all, sorry if I sounded that way
---
"Maybe I need to grow some thicker skin, but I'm just so sick of this. Why would I want to play against you when I know that you're just gonna be talking shit about me the entire time?"  
---
Fuck that. People shouldn't be assholes. I'm completely with you on this, it's not cool.
---
If it doesn't stack what would happen if a player runs Fire Up and BS,  one of the perks can't just sit there being useless. It's like Unbreakable and No mither, they do the same thing but they work one with another (you recover faster with unbreakable)
---
REPORT THE ASSHOLE.
---
I understand that I disagree with you. I just got out of a game where the killer turned an open game into a 2 kill. I got smacked down, and shortly after my teammate did. No one could get close to healing me, and I bled out. Tell me how that perk didn’t kill me. Their enduring didn’t kill me, their overwhelming presence didn’t kill me, noed singlehandedly secured two kills.
---
Talk to anyone who has ever faced off against a noed and they will tell you that it is a crutch perk that gives killers free kills just like how DS gives survivors free escapes. Except DS gets changed (as it needed) while noed stays the same.
---
Killers still have to catch you, but they get more movespeed and by end game, most pallets are gone. They will catch someone.
---
My team doesn’t have to save me, sure. That results in noed killing me singlehandedly.
---
Noed is an amazing perk against solo survivors at non red ranks (aka most of the population).  Ask any survivor which perks they think are the worst to play against. There’s a reason survivors bitch about it so much, just like how killers bitched about DS.
---
Pro tip: Crop your image to remove the TierMaker logo cause everyone knows where you made this shit.
---
From top to bottom left to right:
---
#A Tier
---
* **Hag** - Best Mori in the game by far. It's so gloriously visceral and is the only one that creates proper gore. (Even if the "body parts" look kinda goofy if you see them too many times.)
---
* **Freddy** - Just too iconic not to love. The look of obliviousness on the Survivor before the claw goes through their chest is beautiful.
---
* **Spirit** - Very similar to Freddy but with a lot more violence. And of course weeb memes.
---
* **Legion** - A nice proper brawl with the Survivor that really captures the feel of Legion, and how they're much more inexperienced as Killers than the others. They're just dumb kids with knives and as a result they take awhile to kill you.
---
#B Tier
---
* **Nurse** - Violent yet strangely elegant, especially at the end where you see some of Nurse's remorse.
---
* **Myers** - Very classic and clean. Love the little struggle from the Survivor and how little empathy Michael shows. I just wish you could pin the Survivor to a wall or something if you did the Mori close enough to a wall.
---
* **Leatherface** - He does the Leatherface thing, is really all I can say. It's a point-for-point movie kill from a very iconic horror movie.
---
#C Tier
---
* **Billy** - Leatherface's Mori, but since Leatherface does the Leatherface thing it's much more fun to watch. Billy does a very generic "chainsaw murderer" kill.
---
* **Wraith** - Love how he drags the Survivor back, and the whacks on the Survivor's back are nice and violent. Wish the cuts looked better.
---
* **Doctor** - Kinda just grabs you. It's painful to imagine but watching it he basically just stands on you until you die.
---
#D Tier
---
* **Clown** - Steps on you a bit. The reason it's the highest in D tier is because of how much personality you get to see *after* the kill. Taking the finger and giving it a good succ adds so much to the Doctor as a character, but the actual act of *killing* with the Mori is very boring. On the bright side you can spam it to step on a Survivor's head for awhile.
---
* **Trapper** - Worse Wraith Mori. The lack of the drag just erases so much flavor. Also I don't know why but the Trapper mori just feels less interesting. Maybe because he's way less brutal with his machette when compared to Wraith's weapon.
---
* **Huntress** - Hits you with an axe. It's too clear to really be entertaining. She just goes through the motions. The hits to the chest somehow simultaneously makes this Mori better and worse. It's more violent but it also feels like Huntress is being dumb and wasting time. I would've been fine with her just sticking the axe deep into your skull, and then maybe having a bit of a struggle to pull it out.
---
* **Pig** - By far the worst Mori. It looks great from first person but in third person she basically just walks up, misses a stab on you (and hits your hand) before slicing your throat. It's very boring and uninteresting to watch, and the blood splatters in first person is the only thing that makes this mori entertaining as the Killer.
---
Also if you're wondering [Plague's Mori](https://youtu.be/3kcfWc3SChc) is D tier. Below Clown in my opinion since there isn't even any violence to it. The entire thing looks really cheesy and the way she pukes on the Survivor's face is more comical than brutal. I really wish they had done more with her praying or made the puke much more brutal.
---
I think 128m about covers the entirety of most maps. There may be a couple of exceptions for some bigger, weird shaped maps.
---
You sound like a bratty teenage girl. 
---
Its pointless. If you struggle off the hook in that situation you're just jumping into the killer's lap, and if you dont youre just wasting everyobe's time.
---
I feel it may be another Doctor situation, albeit maybe a little more viable at least. We will see in due time though.
---
While I agree  Amanda's Letter  is shit most of the time...  
---
it's great for trolly/meme builds. Amanda's letter on larry's. you can even get some gen grabs with it since your terror radius stays suppressed for about 5 seconds after uncrouching. 
---
Sweetie... [that means nothing](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2015). In 2015 they added an emoji to their vocabulary. 
---
Like the other guy said, languages derived from latin have gendered terms. Don't butcher the language cause less than a percent of people get offended by it.
---
This is why you should always play as the Huntress. You can still attack players when they’re beyond your reach
---
Gotta keep survivors on their toes
---
I love Clown and I love the *end* of his Mori, but the actual kill is just "lol I steppy on you."
---
I CAN HEAR YOU BEHIND ME, DON'T EVER STAY BEHIND KILLER. OR I SHOULD SAY MOVE, GRASS IS REALLY LOUD, YOUR BREATHING TOO.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ay8q0z/opinion_all_moris_from_best_to_worst/ehz39q2/ None of the tier lists generators have the new Killer on them.
---
I think it's too clean to be properly entertaining.
---
stun time on that must be 5 years
---
I just face camp twitch steamers and watch the post game on my second monitor.
---
Nothing more fun than watching a pig squeal. 
---
Let's bring back Victory Cube?
---
Vault hitboxes because the killer is able to hit you from 10 feet away?
---
&gt; stronger
---
lol
---
They not ready for that drip
---
Well I’m not gonna lie it’s better then what’s on the PTB 
---
I just want Bad perks( Such as fire up) to be good by themselves instead of relying on other perks. There are already perks that don't stack such as monitor and abuse and shadowborn, so it wouldn't be the first time that a perk would just sit there and do nothing.
---
Dwight's homeland

LMAO dude I'm sorry but that isnt true

You must be fun at parties.

"*taps head (with a loaded pistol)"
---
This new ranking system is going to drive me nuts.
---
My biggest peeve with the current ranking system (Killer ranking in any case) is that it doesn't reward effort put into the game. I have had countless 20-24K BP games give black pips and my highest BP black pip game was 26.8K. Nearly a 27,000 blood point game ended in a black pip. I don't farm and earn my BP by beating the hell out of people while also doing what all I can to win. It pays nicely in BP no doubt but after putting that effort into earning those points and being told you lost fucking sucks the fun out of playing.
---
And what Iv seen of the new ranking, I am going to hate it 100%. 3 kill games are not easy in higher ranks, it takes damned good gameplay to earn those kills against good Survivors. Even more if you aren't playing meta perks and/or a top tier Killer. But Iv seen SEVERAL videos of 2-3 kill DE-PIP games. Not black pip, de-pip! That's simply horse shit.
---
I need, a lot, more time to fully understand the PTB ranking changes. But first impressions went horribly. Hopefully it is just another bug. Plague not earning Chaser emblem points for dealing damage with her power is one example and one that should be fixed. But those end screens are screaming otherwise.
---
&gt; It takes the risk away from locker juking
---
Not with the 3 seconds to activate requirement it doesn't. 
---
Scientific denialism isn’t really political but a’ight
---
I'm just gonna keep playing Nurse until they pull their heads out of their asses. If they nerf Nurse without balancing the rest of the bullshit, I'll just play something else.
---
*Trapper and Wraith above anyone*
---
ishygddt
---
Every game duhh
---
So everyone is supposed to play X survivor and X killer only in the ptb? No experimenting with new perk combos across killers, no testing to see what broke (cus more than likely something has) and no adapting to a potentially different meta in general? 
---
Fuck off
---
Turns out they gotta both get angry about gay, and white knight for a fictional character after all 👌
---
Ppl dont seems to realise how strong she is. Atm she doesnt have the right perks because of the ptb, but waw.
---
Give her Bamboozle, corrupt intervention, thanathophobia and sloppy butcher. Combined with increased corrupted purge addons and you got a beast of a killer.
---
I put her on the same tier as spirit.
---
One of the YouTube channels that does compilations of streamers playing games, with this one being specifically DBD, had pug on there just sandbagging the shit out of teammates (not his friends) and laughing his ass off.
---
I don't know much about him, or if this was just a thing he did a couple of times, but it made me never watch anything from him.
---
It's not really about being offended. If you want to be offended, then I think gendered language is pointless and silly.
---
When other people can play killer well and you whining about how hard it is, what else does that imply?
---
Alt f4
---
Then don’t try speaking the language. Too hard?
---
I can’t take this seriously when trapper wraith and maybe billy aren’t the bottom
---
And 11/10 wraiths.
---
When I catch HybridPanda's stream, I'm going to sub with a Prime sub, since I have Amazon Prime. He seems really positive, and I've been following his YouTube for months now. He is really entertaining, as is Puppers.
---
When she hits the survivor it sounds like the Trapper hitting a pallet, shouldn't it sound a little more....fleshy? 
---
Dwight mains: *cums*
---
In the PTB I instantly dc if it isn’t the new killer. 
---
:D What?

When you’re so bothered you out out the “why’d you bothering replying” card in a childish attempt to get the last words in because you’ve lost the conversation. Ecks Dee

Um wraith and billy not bottom tier and clown and huntress bottom tier? Are you ok? Blind? Dumb?
---
Cool thing you can do is use it to stun the killer if you see them making their way towards a hook with a locker nearby. This stun WILL free your teammate if the stun lands.
---
So you see one day on dead by daylight perfect game btw I was running from the killer vaulted into a locker and they hit the locker and it hit me cause hitboxes are God tier
---
Looks like my 7th grade math teacher.
---
Gave me a zero for getting a tutor, and I’ll never forget that.
---
They might also have to pay Jackie Earle Haley to do the lines. We sure as shit aren't getting Robert Englund.
---
Both things don't have to be mutually exclusive. I believe people really do need to develop thicker skins for their own good, but that doesn't also mean people should get a pass for being dickheads. From what OP said, however, I don't think he sounds like a thin skinned whiner. I also would not appreciate someone broadcasting a game I'm in, and just talking mad shit about me the whole time, especially if I'm having an off match and getting molested.
---
FUCK YOUR TOXIC ASS 3 CLAUDETTE SWF GROUP I WILL QUEUE STALL AND DODGE YOU ALL DAY IF I HAVE TO JUST SO YOU DON’T GET TO ENJOY TROLLING KILLERS. KILLER NERFS BUT NO SWF NERFS = NO PLAY FOR SWF

No one is asking for every game they play to win with a 4k. What is being asked is at least let us use our strategies and not force us to play in an inefficient manner.

I really, REALLY doubt it

Hopefully if you buy/preorder DG on console you can get it, I really like that mask.

I like to play jump scare myers if they seem solo, if they have more than 2 flashlights I just bring my dick head LF build or some sort of insurance to deal with toxic streamers. Sometimes I'll just dodge just to ruin their stream just to blueball them right when their e-cock is about to blow
---
Not because I'm bothered, but because I'm genuinely wondering why he bothered to reply if he truly didn't care. Sounds like he cared to me. Besides, if anyone's childishly trying to get the last word, it's him.
---
THESE NEW PALLET HIT BOXES ARE PISSING ME OFF. WHEN I FINALLY MANAGE TO FIND THE HIT BOX AND THE GAME GIVES THE PROMPT, IT DECIDES I'M CLOSER TO THE KILLER'S SIDE OF THE PALLET AND ZOOMS ME OVER SO I'M THROWING THE PALLET DOWN WITH MY ASS PRESENTED TO THE KILLER LIKE I'M IN A GAY PORN. 
---
FUCK THESE NEW HIT BOXES, SERIOUSLY.
---
I’m glad the buffed thanatophobia though. It’s a soft counter to gen rush. Maybe Sloppy Butcher, Ruin, Thanat and whatever tracking/utility perk 
---
Saw that. 😂
---
The main argument is localization but screw it, I don't mind hearing other languages if it means we get Freddy's voice. Overwatch does this well. 
---
Honestly I haven't subbed to anyone and dont believe I will, I cant ever catch an ardetha stream and he's probably the only killer main I could say has made decent points for both sides of the game and isnt an ass about everything 
---
Net-10 killer needs a nerf. Too OP. 
---
He spawned in that tree and couldn’t move, not his fault

She got the last unique outfit that was NOT tied to an event in frigging **August 2018** (Sci-Fi Feng). Meanwhile Ace also got a CNY outfit and now he gets yet another new unique outfit.

My dude this subreddit is so full of nothing but obvious children it's impossible to believe that the average age of this sub is more than 14.

Haha the banners were the first thing I checked and I slightly panicked when I couldn‘t find them. I was afraid that BHVR stopped putting the new skins in the PTB. Thankfully the individual customization icons were still there!
---

They removed heelies wtf
---
Ikr. "Hook gymnastics" aren't used enough
---
The Prestige icons are usually in the DLC customization folders. Each character has their own folder with their name (e.g. Nurse, Dwight) for all the skins and then there are folders for just the DLC (named after the Codename, Demise of the Faithful was called Mali) with the default outfits and Prestige clothes. 
---
Eh I think it evens out. Good nurses suck to play against but bad nurses are fucking hilarious to loop around some tires for 5 gens 
---
I agree, I've only played survivor and I felt like it was a bit much. I understand not wanting to make the killer OP but right now it feels like as a killer I would be tempted to tunnel the survivor I just purged so they can't heal. Because even if you hook them they can still instaheal at the fountain if they are infected after unhook.
---
Streamdad is also very nice, the only guy who has a family friendly DBD stream and tries to help women with ovarian cancer.
---
Highly recommend him.
---
I’m gonna get hate for this but don’t watch tru3ta1ent if you want to get serious and reach rank 1 quickly.
---
Tru3 is a decent killer but his ego is huge and makes this game look so much harder than it is, he considers basic mind games as “optimal movements” and thinks any average survivor is SwF. 
---
Mostly rank 10 killers watch him and worship him, if you dare give any criticism against him you’d get bashed. 
---
If you want to REALLY get good and become a god killer wuite early on, watch Zubatlel, ScottJund or FunGoose - Best killer streamers out there, zubat being the best of the best.
---
Don’t worry. I play red rank as clown and face camp every game so I can give you that spicy variety you long for in life
---
Just wait for new chapter. With the changes to Emblems system you'll have zero problems with "undeserved" pipping
---
Yes.. for science.. 
---
Guess you aren't a fan of KFF but I'll tell you its finger licking good
---
I don't think so. Once the killer has interacted with the pool, her puke doesn't make people sick anymore, but straight out damage them for the duration of the timer. So she can put people in the dying state with puke. 
---
THOT FARMER
---
But what if you actually want to win
---
It used to be but streamers and youtubers seem to have changed the meaning and so everyone else followed suit. I still use it to signal they are close by but the only safe way to know is just ask the team before it begins.
---
Ruin buff really? Along with the unnecessary DS nerf. Devs really trying to get good with the entitled killer mains.
---
I USED PARTY STREAMERS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO LEVEL UP A CHARACTER AND THE KILLER DC'ED THE MOMENT WE LOADED INTO THE MAP. 
---
I'm a survivor main at Rank 2 and I definitely feel like it's in favor of the survivors right now. So far I've only had 3 matches where I've seen the killer get any kills, and I was only sacrificed in 1 of those. The fact that I escaped in a match where I was the Rancor Obsession had me shook to my core. 
---
what do you mean? 
---
Can’t say I disagree, there’s quite a few people o. here that just make you think.

Let all of the little Dwights run free in this sacred land.

I was watching his stream one night and he was talking about how toxicity doesn't exist and that people needed to stop being babies and blamed it on a millennial attitude. Dudes just one of those kinds of dicks who thinks being an asshole is cool. 
---
For OP: Yes tru3ta1ent looks at DBD from a competitive standpoint. Watch who you want, monto does fun builds but isn't great for learning, Tydetyme does lots of info rich videos but has his "My opinion is fact" ego, No0b3 knows what is viable and uses it. They're all great in their own way  (unless it's the one who shall not be named.) 
---
u/54321rome I don't know what your experience with tru3 is, but any "bashing" is mainly to those who want to stir things up in chat. Like talking about how DS doesn't deserve it's nerf. Tru3ta1ent has his opinions but they make sense to me. He's got agreeable evidence. That's my experience.
---
I've learned thar a Dwight without glasses is universally evil and scares people away. 
---
Next time he will have his glasses. For now, we'll let this meme burn in the firey pits of the basement. 
---
the "debuff" is being healed by the fountains? lmao
---
Oh ho, you'll take your Billy and Nurse 100% saturation and you'll LIKE IT.  
---
It's a sign the killers are balanced. 
---
Aye cheers mate,any upvotes are appreciated.
---
thanatho and sloppy butcher are one of the worst perks to use on her. The sirvivors get an insta heal from fountains.... if you didnt know
---
&gt;This killer decided to slug me, the last alive, and run around the map as I bled out. Completely and utterly wasting my time 
---
Since this is PTB and you don't lose anything, I'd just DC at this point. 
---
I would like to be hopeful and say it was smoother, but it could just be placebo. They definitely changed *something* in terms of the way the game runs though. You can tell because when you Shift+Tab to bring up the Steam overlay, the game seems to jitter for a second before opening the overlay and it never used to do that. 
---
Then stop missing your hatchets.
---
Use iron maiden and whatch survivors DC. Its alot of fun.
---
The DBD one right?  That was some quality shitposting with that one
---
Seeing how this is on the PTB, it could very easily be the servers having too many players, it happens quite often with test builds. Have you had this issue on the live branch recently?
---
That guy had the opportunity to cj tech and just goofed instead.
---
Wow it's like what I just stated went through one ear and out the other. I sat and watched people barely safety pip all day after really good games. Sorry but that's not "oh it takes skill hur dur" it's called the fucking pip system at this exact moment in the ptb relies on rng and the other people wanting to rank up.

HACKS!  /s
---
I played a bunch of games as plague then I took spirit and piggy out for a test run. I main them and I wanted to see how the new perks (killer and survivor) worked with them and see if any of the new stuff bugged them out. 
---
Thats what the PTB is for, right?
---
Ahhh I was wondering what happened with the Plagues followers that also got taken up by the entity. They’re with her... in spirit. (Read character info for lore)
---
I did, there was still 4 gens left anyway
---
&gt;All
---
&gt;2/3
---
Pick one. 
---
That is literally my point.... The new DS is garbage...
---
oh
---
So every single noob cant get into red ranks for just playing a lot  
---
That is what we needed all this time. Games are actually going to be kinda more balanced in terms of skill levels
---
Me and my friend did tests on the PTB today, but we don't even rely on real games to do it... we usually will test what we want in a custom game to get basic questions answered, and then try to play some games.
---
But even on Survivor side it can get annoying- played against a lot of killers besides Plague.
---
im sorry but you wont aoe anyone above rank 10
---
Not how you use semi-colons
---
Many survivors are not even SWF. You can't balance the game to prepare killers against 4 man SWF when the majority of survivors don't even play like that.
---
Yes there will be winners and losers but there should still be a balance where survivors are not completely sitting ducks for killers to pick on easily. Again, I'm not taking about SWF but the average survivors. 
---
TIL. I’m always frantically searching for a killer perk on “Kill Your Friends” because I rarely play killer and don’t recognize all the icons. If this is the case, thanks! 
---
I heard someone say you don’t get sick until you leave the locker (if it still has the vomit on it by then), could be wrong though 
---
That's a quality meme
---
what’s wrong with the new killer?
---
To get the epic "ruthless victory"
---
# Voiceoverpete4president
---
Ok but you wanna know what is EVEN better?
---
Getting down near a pallet and a total genius player drops it to stun killer while you are still down, not picked up by the killer.
---
But i've just now had several 4k games and didn't get a pip
---
I've seen a killer got 2 kills and 1 person dead on hook and *de-pipped.*
---
Yeah, make pipping harder, but not THIS much harder.
---
Boo - Kenneth's mori needs to be higher. 
---
What else would a big fat drunk disgusting clown do but stomp on your head and snack on your finger?
---
Yes
---
Not even gonna lie im in red ranks and this STILL happens and what even better is when they decide hey I'm going to drop this mid animation I wish I had the iq of them they out here making plays.
---
That explains why my numbers are low when I stream. :/
---
The one idea the devs were floating around was if the killer is within x range from the hooked survivor then the entity has its progress slowed. Add a second survivor to the mix and the entity progresses normally. 
---
Yeah and there still has to be at least 1 dude who's looking for the hatch instead repairing the last gen.
---
Plumbers don't were ties
---
I didn’t know that the during the closing hatch phase survivors needed to complete another gen which would be suicide if the hatch was closed by the killer. I think closing it is a step in the right direction but reopening it should be easier then doing a gen. Maybe have an small animation to reopen the hatch that maybe alerts the killer or maybe it reopens every 30seconds or a minute. That’s all I have at the moment. 
---
Just gonna say it left behind op perk of course 
---
While in game I don’t have an issue with it... if I’m ever in that situation in real life the most surefire way to get me to stop moving and scream “Just kill me!” is vomiting on me and making me incredibly sick... no thank you.
---
Very efficient birthing hips. 
---
And I am also seeing Myers players with NOED
---
*WTF?*
---
Or other killers but with Rancor AND NOED

---
To jog your memory. This is wild, I knew I'd find you again if I kept using semicolons!
---
Not arguing, just trying to pass down some knowledge. Good luck tho
---
I say hex ruin is just a way for survivors to learn how to time their great skill checks. Not overpowered, just a small obsticle made even smaller by bad hex spawns. Nerfing it would just make it easier to ignore.
---
It's a little icky but I think it's more cool than anything. I really love her design and I think that her vile makes her a bit different from other killers. I can't wait to play her!
---
Only if you leave while its still got sick all over it. Won't spread to them just being in it.
---
Plague isn't Freddy tier, so I'm sure you'll find many survivor mains who disagree with you.
---
Just pretend it's food coloring or something.
---
YOU DID AMAZING!
---
Yeah it's the meta freddys and Michaels with noed also fun fact I got banned from the dbd discord server 
---
Out of curiosity, what particularly inspired this?
---
Thikki Lake!! 
---
My cousin might have to quit the game, he gets nauseous by the sight or smell of puke, and when the PTB came out he puked halfway through the game. XD
---
Puke doesn't really bother me though.
---
Didn’t even downvote you, but eh believe what you want
---
I mean if you were not exhausted and got in a locker then jumped out i dont see the problem thats still hard to pull off. Dead hard was the one i was thinking about but still just waot then hit them
---
I would have preferred an actual TLDR but I digress.
---
Emblem changes: agreed. Devs want to make it harder to rank up and get points as Killer whereas a Survivor can literally fart around and still rank up. 
---
DS changes: I don't agree that it's a buff. Just slug the guy who got unhooked if you're unsure. If they nail you with it anyway it's just like a guy getting away because of Borrowed Time. They're going to get away. It's just going to happen. Devs don't care. Devs want to reward bad players. They want to reward idiots who hook rush even when the Killer is right there. If gates are open then fuck the Killer. That seems to be the dev philosophy. 
---
The key problem is still the same; not enough time in general because of pallet lands, loops, and gens are done too quickly. 
---
I've lost a lot of energy to complain about these shitposts. It might just be that it's 1:30 AM and I should sleep. But with my flair reading "Legion's Lawyer" this kind of crap makes me upset.
---
I don't think Legion is an inherently flawed concept. The idea of a Killer who can vault pallets but doesn't down you immediately isn't bad. It's not a concept that is inherently flawed / unfun or one that can't work in Dead by Daylight. Put in massive layman's terms if Nurse is allowed to exist then Legion as a concept can exist as well.
---
The main problem with Legion is not "durrr OP power durrrr no escape" like all these "Hi I'm Rank 20" shitpost make it out to be. The bugs and exploits get rid of their only weakness (time management) which has boosted them to overpowered levels. There are other issues too (I still stand by my opinion that Legion's power is objectively the worst baseline power in the game) but the Moonwalking exploit and addons like Frank's Mix Tape is what's pushed Legion over the edge. 
---
I do agree that it's a problem that Feral Frenzy downing you is basically an innevitability, since the only way to stop Legion from getting one of their 4 necessary hits on you is to pallet stun them. There's a finite number of pallets on the map and even when you do stun them they can still continue chasing you. You **shouldn't** be able to down people with Feral Frenzy alone. Does this mean that I think Legion should have 115% movement speed normally, and not injure a Survivor with the Deep Wounds stab (but simply apply DW)? ...Well, yes maybe. Unless you're garbage you're basically guarenteed a down on a Survivor. I've seen some comments stating that Plague's power is Legion's power done right and while I don't entirely agree I do see where they're coming from. Making Deep Wounds gradually slow you down or make you unable to be healed (broken status effect) would be good but ultimately the Killer needs an actual reason to break pallets which they currently do not.
---
I think as they are currently (long down time but very reliable in getting said downs) they'd be fine overall. Still unfun but no worse than Freddy's inescapability. The problem with their current rendition is the exploits, but their current rendition as a while is very flawed and could use tweaks. The core idea is fine but it needs a lot of number and effect tweaks. It's not like Freddy whos current kid I honestly can't defend in any capacity.
---
People find shit talking funny when they are watching it. It is the same with fail compilations on youtube, people will find them very funny to watch but if you are part of one it is a different feel. 
---
Also some people are just really negative and like to moan about any inconvenience anyway because that is how they are. Sad but sometimes true.
---
I would just try not to take it too personal since they aren't insulting you because they know you but because you are an enemy in the game. It isn't right but a lot of people especially younger people just shit talk in any game if you don't fit the mold, that goes double if you are an enemy. You can't please everyone especially when you are the 1 in a 1v4 game so just play to please yourself and let them whine about it.
---
You are more blind than a tunneling Freddy if you think that Hillbilly's Mori is the same as Trapper and Wraith. Trapper and Wraith are very similar and I do agree that they need to be changed, but Hillbilly's is completely different.
---
Your poor cousin!
---
I think I'll get used to it. It was just an overload of gross and gagging this afternoon.
---
Quality of shitposts has risen in just the last 8 hours. +1
---
Good idea.
---
I'm so sorry, how could I have been so blind? Time to commit honourable sudoku

I think she is really cool too. She is absolutely fun to play. Getting the aim and spray right is a bit tricky at first but easy enough to get the hang of. 
---
Thicki Lake...cmon make this a thing. She has a talk show is Thick... it works.
---
Ah I didn't realize it gives warning beeps passed the gates. Thanks for the info!
---
This „Med-Kit“ is since 2016 in the game files. Maybe and old idea. 
---
I used to have emetophobia so severe that I couldn't even look at the word "vomit". I did a lot of exposure therapy (to the word and fictional vomit). So, I should be okay. It's been years since I had it so bad.
---
Urghhh but I felt some anxiety while watching a video of gameplay. I guess it'll help give me more exposure. :-P could be a good thing
---
This was a successful game for you 
---
Didn’t you know? Complaining is the meta in this community
---
Myers isn't Freddy tier? And everyone loves playing against Myers. Fun to play against and Viability are two different things..
---
basically, what they did with most of your mentioned perks is, that you dont need to hope for the tier 3 perk, to get an useful perk. you get the full effect at tier 1. this reduces the grinding you need to get a decent set of perks. a good change imo. its questionable if bbq needed the change, but i appreciate the other buffs (yes ruin too)
---
the thanatophobia buff seems a bit strong. before it was barely viable (imo) and you needed sloppy butcher to make it somewhat effective.. now it may be a perk that you'll slap on your build, just because its strong....
---
but yeah. fired up early game nerf and late game buff just doesnt seem right. already underused perk that is even more niche than before. well. now all freddy perks are useless until endgame. maybe that's an active decision? 
---
Look at adretha’s replies to no0b on twitter and tyde does it with every killer

---
&gt;Your idea of efficient manner is at the expense of four other players, who BHVR also have to serve.
---
All games have rules, especially one where it involve multi players. The idea is making sure most players get to enjoy the game instead of it catering to one specific group or individual.
---
I think people like you are the problem with this game. Even though the devs are at fault as well because they designed their game with a "Everyone is a winner." Participation Trophy bullshit. They want to reward bad players (such as yourself). And the weird thing is that the other two Slasher games have the same exact philosophy for some reason. They believe that the bads need a million 2nd chances. Hence: Decisive Strike, Unbreakable, Deliverance, the Hatch, Instant Heal, the Key, etc. 
---
But people like you especially fester in this fucking game and demand that everyone caters to you and nothing can be "un-fun" I.E. challenging. Even though this is a fucking 1 V 4 multiplayer game. I have no idea where shitlords like you come from, I assume from the depths, but you need to be told how wrong your opinions are and that you are a shitload. 
---
Apply this philosophy to any other online game and see what happens. Any whine, any Survivor Main, I fucking dare them to cry in any other community and see how long they last:
---
"Headshots are unfair! Please nerf devs!"
---
"Fireballs in Mortal Kombat are unfair! I'M NOT HAVING FUN!"
---
"I keep getting bad team mates in LOL! FIX NOW DEVS!"
---
"ROCKET JUMPING IS SO CHEAP AND NOT FUN! NERF NOW REEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
---
Shut the fuck up you cancerous piece of shit. 
---
Record your reaction when you get mori’d by her. It’s pretty great. Lol

Thank you
---
&gt; Those changes wont go through
---
Personally, I'd like to see them go through for a month or two to see how people adapt. It's pretty clear that current playstyle (do gens as fast as possible and get out; get survivors out of the game as fast as possible) won't be viable with these changes. It'd be interesting to see what would be a new red ranks playstyle (if there'd be red ranks players at all).
---
Thing is, I don't think PTB is the best indication of how live build would play out. And with less than a day of play it's too early to say ranking is too hard. It's too hard without changing your playstyle, that's true. But is there a way to play to get to red ranks? That's a question that won't be answered on PTB, I think.
---
How is Hillbilly’s completely different than theirs? Elaborate. Because he uses a different weapon? That’s what makes it different? Lol OK.
---
Why did you bother staying once he caught you? It's the PTB, just DC.
---
you did not say "a tiny one of them is for dbd", you said "one of them" as if that was one of the main factors, you understood it, i understood it and whoever read this understood it, so stop trying to play the "smart guy"
---
Actually with r/gaming trend I was expecting Skyrim beginning. When you wake up in a cart
---
I just got done with that. At 13:45 in the video how did he get a corrupt purge without going for a fountain? Is it actually because a gen got finished? If so, was that the result of an addon?
---
Hate to break it to you: I'm watching his stream right now, and he likes the killer.
---
This is a request not from a Legion main or a salty Killer main or a Rank 20 exploiting bugs for free wins. This is a request from someone who just enjoys this game and loves its community.
---
#Stop making "Legion sucks" memes. Stop upvoting "Legion sucks" memes. Stop encouraging lazy reguritated content with zero effort put into it.
---
"This character isn't fun" and "this character is bugged" are not funny. You can have a moment of "ha ha yeah I agree" but just putting the statement "Legion is unbalanced" as the caption to an ["I agree](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/and-thats-a-fact) [with this statement."](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lisa-simpsons-presentation) meme or the statment "Legion is fun" to an ["I disagree](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/well-yes-but-actually-no) [with this](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-you-delusional-do-you-suffer-from-a-mental-illness) [statement"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wait-thats-illegal) meme is not funny or interesting. You're literally just stating facts and getting upvotes from mindless Redditors who upvote anything they agree with.
---
At least the "Freddy sucks"(/"DARN") meme is a little funny due to the schadenfreude of how awful Freddy is, but even those memes are low brow. Just going "this thing in the game is bad everyone please clap" is a lazy regurtiation of content for the sake of free karma. Yes this goes to "ha ha campers", "ha ha NOED", and "ha ha toxicity" posts. Saying something exists isn't a joke. The only people who think that stating something exists is a joke are 3 year olds who find anything funny. If you're a 3 year old who thinks another kid shouting "BANANA" is the most hilarious thing you've ever heard then go right ahead and laugh at them. But Dead by Daylight is a Mature rated game and you shouldn't be playing it if you're 3 years old.
---
Can we stop upvoting posts that state the blatantly obvious? It just leads to saturation of lazy uninteresting content which drives away new people and further contributes to this sub being seen as a joke.
---
honestly as disgusting as it sounds, i expected her to drown the survivor in bile by vomiting straight into their mouth. This is kinda meh
---
If they want to play a killer that isn’t the new one whilst using none of the new perks they shouldn’t be playing on the PTB
---
That's the issue with people and it will truly be the issue, everyone wants balance and will say x and x are broken but when looked at the top players they are balanced.
---
Why is it not good against tier 1 Myers?
---
You'll need it to get a flashlight save lol
---
civ 6 baby 
---
The fact that people are not pipping at all when they have gold in all four categories is crazy. So like is this going to cause a major increase in boosted players? The ranking was already mess when red and purple ranks were matching with rank 15 killers.
---
That doesn't make any sense. Theyre 2 different types of gross. People can be disgusted by one but not the other. 
---
The removal of the missed attack cooldown was like 8%, which is not noticeable in the slightest. Not like it matters also anyway because you will go down when they hit you so it’s not like they will catch up to you
---
If someone gets a perfect game (32k points) that deserves a double pip it's a perfect game for killer (not sure how easy that be as survivor) which is kinda rare but can be done
---
hahah all good. It was the first thing i thought. Most of the games player base is younger than me so maybe won't get any mileage.
---
Why not both :D
---
I love when this happens and love doing it also. It’s refreshing to just have some fun from all the face campers, tunnelers, saltiness, etc
---
I played a lot of left 4 dead versus as a boomer and spitter, so no. im excited for it.
---
top meme
---
scoring is wrong, i play to pip not to score. for BP's i take boost perks.
---
2.5 gens, an unhook and full heal and then i can get chased for 30-45 seconds and its a pip no problems. With the new system 11 bits of pie isn't gonna be much harder ill just have to loop the killer which i avoid more than i need to.
---
Kindred is one of my usual perks so I love that it got a decent buff. Open-handed makes it quite silly though.
---
Thanks! I was looking for them but i couldn't find
---
Because when you are being chased and run around a corner, the chase can be broken for a few seconds - during this time, although the killer is following you, the game doesn't recognize it as a "chase" so when you go to vault, you don't get the speed boost.
---
I think you can't tell the diff between facts and opinion. Besides SWF is not an indication of top tier player. Not when they have methods that other players can't use. 
---
Oh, don’t worry about the fps. You’ll be lucky to get into max three games for the day,
---
Can confirm, Freddy was ass cheese from the very beginning
---
I can go from rank 11 to rank 1 in a day if I play solo. When I play swf I rarely pip since team is too efficient. 
---
So 2 pips for farming game? Please, no.
---
Erm, you are the one who's whining that killers can't win easily.
---
Why don't you listen to yourself, you piece of shit? 
---
OP got down voted because Survivor Mains insist that Gen Rushing doesn't exist. Okay then.
---
Sadly, there's not much you can do. Your best bets are:
---
Use Ruin but it's not that great. It does "something" at the least.
---
Corrupt Intervention might be good. It's the Plague's level 30 perk and looks like it will help. But you have to wait over 2 weeks for the new Killer to drop.
---
The buffed Thanatophobia might be OKAY now. But, again, you have to wait over 2 weeks for the PTB to be over. Even though the majority just play the PTB day 1 and then jump onto the base game on day 2 and stay there. 
---
Isn't using perks to counter bad game design fun? 
---
Oof, hit a nerve, it seems.
---
I’ll be sure to go study some ‘ecoomics’, them.
---
Honestly same
---
&gt;severed toe
---
*clown heavy breathing*
---
Everyone’s there to play against the new killer so it’s not much of a surprise.
---
I thought that said monto 
---
I don't doubt that. Just saying that "32k BP has to be a double pip" is not a good way to think about ranking up standards.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted, I've literally had that happen to me after getting stunned at a safe pallet. 
---
The healing animation can be interrupted by vomiting, using a fountain reveals their location, AND you can just use the fountain they corrupted, so it's a bad idea to try on the Survivor's part, but it is possible to do a clutch fountain cleanse immediately after breaking chase.
---
I had the same problem I tried everything but the only thing that worked for me was reinstalling 
---
I played with y'all a few weeks ago, it was a fun game even though it was a 3v1 vs the spirit (on clown map). I think she got 2 hooks after a few flashlight saves.
---
Great to use while youre waiting for a lobby. Good work OP
---
Because Jane isn't fat she just has a giant fucking trunk.
---
Yeah screw people who want to know how the new perks and and tweaked perks play on their mains.
---
How dare a Piggy test the new obsession or a Legion test the tweaked Thanatophobia.
---
No this post totally doesn't make me come off as an entitled douchebag 
---
Did the ranking system change? Wtf what changed?
---
Work through it at your own pace. As someone who still cant face the clown, it's ok to have something you can't quite handle. It's only human man
---
Or they tunnel and camp you on fucking ptb 😂😂
---
Dwight is with David tho....
---
"Delicious"
---
Lol
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
At that point theres nothing a person could've done better
---
That guy has chopsticks. 
---
Lol we're at a point where SWFs are considered top tier player just because you have bad experience as a killer against them.
---
Newsflash : we all do when facing SWFs. But their strength should never be considered base level of most survivors. This is one thing that BHVR thankfully understand so far regardless how whiny killer mains can be at times. 
---
TWITCH STREAMERS WHO DEDICATE THEMSELF TO LOOPING AND TEABAGGING ARE SCUM CHANGE MY MIND
---
Go to your steam library, right click on dead by daylight, go to properties, local files, and click "Verify Integrity of Game Files". It'll run and probably reacquire the glitched file. 
---
I wonder if this is actually part of the map or just so people can test the new perks
---
I know tyde isn't particularily "bright" with killer tierlists, but there hasn't been a single good killer (on release) after huntress. Spirit and legion were shit when they were released, and prior to that we only got a bunch of m1 killers and most of those came when the game was very survivor sided. 
---
Also he likes the new killer which makes me think you only mentioned him out of spite. I'm not a tyde fan and he has a few very controversial opinions, but the dude definitely doesn't deserve this much hate.
---
But Legion sucks...
---
Its the same for survivors. A killer never hooking anyone and you cant pip. 
---
&gt; Your idea of efficient manner is at the expense of four other players, who BHVR also have to serve.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; All games have rules, especially one where it involve multi players. The idea is making sure most players get to enjoy the game instead of it catering to one specific group or individual.
---
Do you even look in a mirror? I'm being rhetorical, bud. We all know you don't. The point of a competitive game is one side wins. That's the fucking point. The losing side doesn't get a participation trophy at the Super Bowl, breh. I know you think you deserve that participation trophy but that's now how real life works. Now be fucking quiet and stop whining when people don't cater to your bullshit. 
---
Hahahaha XD WTF
---
Or Clown as Wario
---
Nah dude. Hurling an axe into some Fengs face feels divine. 
---
She's the most deserving of my sympathy. Ik she wasn't killed by her father, so that's still second to me. I simply really like her lore. A devoted priestess who was corrupted. There's a beauty to that. And the irony isn't overlooked
---
FPS still dips to single digits at the worst possible times. Don't worry, an "expansion pass" is coming soon. In the meantime, buy the DLC!!! XD
---
Is the ptb out?
---
Ruin wasn't buffed, all they did was make it less annoying to level up. Both tier 3 ruins are the same.
---
I'm sure David can find better, more suitable partner.
---
Let Dwight be happy with his lady love. 
---
The worst part I think is that mods like him. 
---
Unfortunately yes. Just think about all the influence he has on new players...
---
Thanks, I just had a game where I chased a laurie around for the entire game because I suck at chasing, managed to hook her, then the doors opened and she was the only one I could see so I hooked her again? Then the entire chat shat on me. Can you disable it? I can't find a way to
---
&gt;cheecks
---
Bro call me mystic meg or something and true you didn't say if it's a good or bad thing, but my spirit guide Indian Cheiftain Runs with Scissors is assuring me you think it's a bad thing.
---
I think monto monto likes you \*MONTO WALKING TOWARDS A HEX:RUIN\*
---
Only real men use no Mither.
---
I don’t know about that. A lot of their stories are sad and deserve sympathy.
---
Billy was basically bricked in a room his entire childhood and neglected. The Huntress was (albeit unintentional) abandoned at a very young age when she lost her mother. The nurse went crazy after losing her husband and working in an asylum. The hag was kidnapped, abused, and tortured.
---
I’m not saying she doesn’t deserve sympathy but a lot of the killers have a sad background that deserve at the very least pity. 
---
Man you must be versing some shit survivors if you think killer is strong I'm sorry man
---
There is no such thing as Lady Love and dwight. 
---
No.. because you should never balance a game on the average player as I've stated multiple times and will continue to state. Which means balancing around optimal play. Sorry but stop you have 0 clue wtf this game needs and probably barely crest above rank 10 as a survivor and killer.
---
Sweet as, I can hit the snap out skill checks so I should be able to hit this 
---
I like how head on is a teachable
---
5 Nights At Freddy's
---
Read carefully before jumping to conclusions.
---
I mean, I expect a whole lot of Myers' to come with Infectious Fright. Such a good perk on him.
---
Killers are weaker than survivors if they know how to do gens and sort of know how to loop.
---
If everyone played a normal game. If it was a 5-man farming game, do you think 2 pip for everyone is a deserved result?
---
My fav game of all the time! 
---
He was better when he actually enjoyed the game. And before the whole self-righteous twitter deranking rant/argument.
---
Unfortunately you can´t. But you can leave as soon as the game finishes. Also you should disable the option for others to comment on your profile if you´re on PC. But as you´ll learn, you´ll get better and you won´t need those tactics anymore :)
---
RIP BBQ stacks :'( Part of me always dies inside seeing this...
---
You watched this for 30 minutes on a PTB match?
---
Does anyone agree with me that Dwight players usually hide inside lockers? Ha. Ha. Ha. 
---
Wow, ya, it looks really good. Good stuff doesn't get upvoted though.
---
Yeah this is why the dev will never listen to you because you have God complex and know it all attitude. But continue raging on. 
---
Eh, survivors overall don't generally think nice thoughts about the killer. I'm a killer main and even I view the killer as an asshole in over a third of the survivor games I play, but there's usually no hard feeling involved.
---
I remember a game where I played Spirit and wiper a team with only one gen complete, one of the survivors was a streamer and I watched the vod of the match after playing it. They called me a sweaty killer/tryhard several times in the match (which I never understand; it was red ranks, aren't you meant to try your best to win?). However, when I went back to their livestream afterwards to say hi, they ended up being quite nice and apologising.
---
If someone is sending hatemail or just really insulting you in postgame chat, that's going too far, but if you down a streamer and hear them cuss you under their breath when it happens in the vod, that's mostly normal behavior
---
Did they revert the stun time change? Old decisive was 4.5 seconds, and the new decisive perk description that I saw when the announcement was made explicitly said 3 seconds 
---
the pig and Claudette are also together 
---
More like the killers I face know what they are doing in comparison to those who won't endlessly about survivors being strong when survivors have been nerfed non stop in the past year and half. 
---
Ah yes and here we see the over compensator. Attempting to show off that a girl with very bad judgment of character and self esteem and probably some daddy issues was sad enough to let him do the fuk for 9 seconds before he just couldn't take it anymore
---
... it took me longer than it should have to realise the face on the left was the new killer and not a trash bag. I was so confused 
---
Could have been a detail I missed. I still haven't gotten home to play. Makes sense I get OT the day PTB is released. 
---
My only problem with her mori is that thr lines sound funny and not intimidating.
---
Well you have to test Head On somewhere.
---
Are you dumb? Just asking. 
---
And then Luigi Dwight wins by doing absolutely nothing.
---
And by that, I mean hiding in a locker the entire game.
---
Perfect characterization.
---
devotee's a.ulet + Worship tabelet is gonna be nasty,she has full movment speed while having her puke charged, so she will move faster then 115 movmentspeed!

Ardetha?
---
Haven't heard that name in a while, not ever since the walking tantrum of a girlfriend banned me for making a joke at her expense.
---
She looks like she's been hanging out in Las Vegas for the past 84 years.
---
This has been in the game files for absolutely ages.
---
Elaborate.
---
Depends on price I’m in love with the Astro a40tr but that may be out of people’s price range 
---
I play the older killers in PTB for a daily so I have more bloodpoints to put into the new killer
---
`Fixed an issue that caused Bitter Murmur not to show all Survivors' auras when the last generator was repaired, and for less than 5/7/10 seconds respectively.`
---
AH HA! I fucking KNEW it was bugged. I thought I was going crazy. Thanatophobia getting buffed is pretty big as well, but I'd still like it if they just made it so that it still counted dead survivors.
---
Those pip changes and killer emblem changes are going to be brutal. 10 hooks? Really? In this economy? Did the Lunar Event hooking shenanigans not teach them anything? I wanted to get to rank 1 but I don't know if I can get there before the patch. Post patch seems like it will be terrible trying to climb. 
---
This is some Jimmy Screamerclauz shit
---
imo plague has pretty boring add-ons. too many generic and too few interesting ones. 
---
you can interact with corrupted pools. they give you the damage-on-puke buff for a limited time, but lose their corruption. they get corrupted again, when a puked on survivor cleanses himself at one of those pools. so its not exactly from the start of the game, as you have to walk to the pool. not sure if you see the aura. 
---
saw iridescent seal on stream. it didnt feel strong. slower movement and shorter damaging power just feels bad. maybe it requires a different setup though. with something like discordance you can damage a group of survivors in no time.. when they finish the gen, which they shouldnt. we'll see how strong it actually is.
---
(hello again :3)
---
I agree, but you’re also kinda an idiot if you sit in a idle game for 30 minutes just leave and join a new one within 2 mins
---
Hmm let's see... I'm not the one who created a thread stating that survivors are OP and need to be nerfed even more than they already are.
---
I'm not the one who wanted to 4k each time or to make my life chasing survivors easier by demanding the dev to cater to my needs and me needs only while ignoring the other 4 players in the game.
---
No. That's you and some killer mains here. 
---
Oh!
---
Here (at least in spain) Being curvy is like being "fat" but in shape. I know it does not make sense but in my head it does XDDD 
---
The new ranking is definitely the stand-out fail of this patch. Not changing requirements for killer and survivor is going to widen the skill gap tremendously at rank 1. 
---
I don't know how/why they thought this was a good idea, especially the Gatekeeper changes. Ayayay...
---
You're the one who admits to insulting people in the "heat of the moment". Grow up. There's a reason I called you a dick head. However, there isn't a reason for you to insult people for simply playing a game.
---
I think I mistake by picking Nurse first. "She can blink? That's gotta be strong."
---
And it was. Still is, actually.
---
I also like the bug where the killer goes into flexing mode when you pick someone up who DC's on your shoulder. Being chased by a flexing Hag was hilarious xD
---
There is a big Balance Problem between New Survivor (no Perks no Teamplay) and SWF with all the sweaty Perks + Ultra Rare Items.   Imo Self-Care and atleast 1 Exhausten Perk (like Dead-Hard) should be baseline for every new Player and THEN you can balance Killers arround it. If you think about it that new Survivor can take 2 Hits to go down than 2x1 to die = 4 Hits vs "high level" Survivor who need atleast 3-4 (Dead Hard / DS) to get your first Hook and if you let em escape they heal up and after 40sec they are back at 3 Hits just to Hook em.
---
Haha would like to have that one too!
---
It's to discourage Killers from tunneling/camping because it makes players quit (schoking). It's not harder, you just play like a cunt and the devs decided to not reward you for it.
---
Why only females? That's pretty fucking sexist
---
You’re better off turning off messages, trust me
---
Essential oils
---
Let me guess you think letting yourself die on first hook is perfectly fine?
---
Thank you, kind internet person \^\_\^
---
But you can see Rancor the entire Game... or why else would you see the Killer whenever a Gen is completed?

Green Mario also known as a second Mario. Mario Brothers.

No this is a child from Karen.

That's why she got the plague

What are you talking about you can 
---
Cries in PS4
---
Ace is pretty quiet, as some of his sounds is just sharp and quick inhale exhales like he's trying to cool hot food. 
---
Tapp is pretty quiet but it fairly noisy doing everything else, cleansing totems has him just HRAAGH at random times which doesn't make sense. But he generally blends in better in his all black costume.
---
Not in console tho 😢
---
Dropping pallets early is the only solution. Not ideal I know, but it's something.
---
It happened yesterday, not sure what time for you but afternoon for me. I was a Laurie with the ugly purple Outfit though.
---
I think I’ve only said this once or twice, but to answer your question of what you should do is: git gud. 
---
Spirit is amazing, Legion is broken good with the right add-ons (but weak otherwise, fair enough), and Pig isn't terrible either.
---
I get slow downs and lost frames. Someone will be infront of me and suddenly they are like 6 lunges away. I'm using lunges as a unit of measurement here
---
To make it not braindead to get to Rank 1, but since Rank literally means nothing and doesn't give you anything for getting it, who cares?
---
I don't think Tyde even said anything yet about the new killer. Except that she could potentially compete with Huntress. 
---
&gt;he only likes killers he can get an easy 4k with.
---
His favourite killer is myers FFS. I'm not going to argue about the "2k is win"-meme. It's completely on you what you perceive as a victory. I personally think the best killer players should be getting 3-4k nearly every time and the best survivor teams deserve to escape almost every time.

They only get ill upon leaving the locker while it is still infected. If they remain inside and wait out the duration of the vomit, they can leave safely.

I´d like to see a source on that.

The cleansing fountains are made from essential oils

Still looks better with clown but nice job anyways;)

I talk shit the entire time i play games, even about bots and npcs. It feels funny to me, and makes people i play with laugh, so its just become habit. Not that i ever really stream, but if for example i ducked into a locker and the killer walked by, and i say some shit like "gotcha dumbass, im the sneakiest man on the planet" i don't mean anything by it. That's just me. I had run ins with twitch streamers who told me to kill myself in the post game chat. And its just like, wtf are you tryna get banned on dbd and twitch?
---
They have the rights to the reboot freddy. Im sure it they used roberts theyd have to aquire additonal rights. I really wish they charged more for him and gave us both in the form of a different outfit
---
DC
---
I mean, if you don't lunge at a straight line, you cover less distance, which makes sb better and exhausted doesn't mean easy to catch
---
But tbh it's not even worth it to ever use the ambush attack when you can just uncrouch and go for a grab. 
---
I did not really comment about killer emblem changes, it was about pips overall. Its now easier to fall out of red ranks, both killer and survivor
---
lmao I would defend ardetha but I dont feel like typing and I still feel a it of Ranchor to what he djd
---
&gt;after being fully infected (which takes kind of long) 
---
So after watching Marth and trying it in game, I realized that if you keep puking on the survivor, it keeps building more sickness. IDK if it was from addons or what, but if Marth got a full (or mostly full) stream on a survivor they would be insta-broken.
---
She is slowed down while charging, but while holding it she is not slowed down. What Marth did and what I started doing was while chasing a full hp survivor, keep your stream held when you can't get a hit with the vomit, and keep vomiting when you can. Especially if they do a vault, you can get a big nasty stream on them as they are coming up to the vault, during, and after.
---
This isn't the end-all-be-all of strats (gotta judge when there are time its better to just smack for first damage instead of puke) but I had better games once I realized that more puke=faster sick.
---
I originally thought that only way to get sicker faster was from them running more, not from more puke.
---
I, Kira Yoshikage, just want a quiet locker.
---
Nice Q&amp;Q reference there too.
---
Tombstone always worked when I play Myers. 
---
I'm so glad I'm not alone I was super pumped because I farmed up 1 Mil then I get on the PTB and I have 8K like woohoo lucky me
---
Because I have a ton of ultra rare addons and black wards.
---
WTF does toxicity has to be with being a millennial?! The mental gymnastics man.
---
Even with the depip protection beyond r15, I was still hitting 2k+ hours players when i first started. Playing killer is hit and miss even at low ranks and BHVR doesn't give a shit about people intentionally deranking, i see it in every third or fourth game.
---
Drop pallets a bit early to play round it. Or have anecit ready
---
 No it might be my fault that's why I asked this cesspool of angry killermains like yourself for advice only to hear 'gitgud' which btw, slowclap for the originality, slowclap for being the funniest guy on the subreddit for a whole second, you should go into comedy for that one.  
---
Do you even read what you write, I come here for advice and you accuse me of not looking for advice, you fucking braindead scumfuck, go back to playing legion retard. 
---
there could be more animations to make it even better, but how fun is it, if you grab a toxic survivor and just puke him into his face? thats build in BM!
---
Do you even read what you write, I come here for advice and you accuse me of not looking for advice, you fu king braindead scumfu ck, go back to playing legion r etard. 
---
ABC
---
UPPERCASE PLEASE!
---
ALSO THAT IS NOT A GOOD USE OF YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL!  
---
SPEND IT ON SOMETHING MORE WORTHWHILE THAN DEAD BY DAYLIGHT!  
---
Leatherfaces are never fun to play against haha. Most basic 2D killer in the game, nothing special about him at all. Only thing that is almost as boring is Clown.
---
Delete 
---
Git gud scrub
---
This is exactly why I stopped watching him. I was there to watch him and learn a bit but the entitled GF had to be in every stream with her delusions of grandeur, banning chat if you looked at them funny. 
---
Panda, Hexy and Tru all have partners, and they leave their BFs alone when they’re steaming because they are literally working and making money. 
---
My stand,『HELLOWEEN』, will be the judge!
---
How about...... no
---
Yeah without the corrupt buff just keep puking. Chase holding m2 and release when you can get a good stream. Depending on the situation (some loops its harder to hit them with puke) you can get them broken fairly quick. 
---
When they are broken they don’t get the speed boost like a normal hit would. Then you become a 115 killer with one hit down.
---
With the corrupt buff, you do the same thing (holding m2) but you get hits with the puke instead. It’s like huntress hatchets but easier to land/aim and time limited instead of charges. It’s worth it to pick up the buff during the chase if it goes by a corrupt pool, IMO. 
---
Freddy can never catch a break sorry buddy
---
Hex: Blood Warden 
---
Exactly!
---
This update is good. It encourages interactions between all survivors and the killer. Rank 1 games will have good chases. On the flip side, there will be little to no Camping or equally immersed Claudettes waiting for the hatch to pip since that is punished.
---
Can't wait for it to roll out - now I actually don't mind being at R1.
---
Y is my pp hard
---
Got a case of the bad luck.
---
You mean the puke effect around the screen? I get that it hinders your view but you still got 75% of your screen to start looking for those cleansing spots
---
I agree that the huge requirement to not depip at red ranks is a bit overwhelming and counterintuitive, but to be honest it's probably to put in rank rewards without EVERYONE getting the rank 1 one every time.
---
I do feel like since your gameplay is affected by the other side, the requirements to pip are fairly insane. A tunnelling killer denies you contribution to objectives and altruism for instance even if your chase and survival gets maxed out. This system will only exaccerbate issues with matchmaking at the extreme ranks, high or low, as it'd take a brand new player or an absolute freak to maintain either. It's going to be a mess of most of the player pool in the mid ranks making for very uneven matchmaking.
---
I was just responding to OP bitching that slugging doesn't rank them up, which is a different aspect of the changes entirely.
---
I think it’s too harsh atm. Watching killers give a “good game” with no tunneling, slugging, many chases, many hooks, etc. end in 2-3k and still depip.
---
Yeah it does now, it (probably) didn't at launch.
---
Oh don’t get me started on Tyde. While I do like him, he acts like survivors kidnapped his mom and sold her into an underground sex traffic ring. That’s one jaded dude. 
---
I do like that Panda wants everyone to have a good time, I just really wish he would stop putting emphasis on adhering to these silly terms that aren’t even indicative to how he’s playing. It just helps spread false narratives on play that shouldn’t be categorized in what’s deemed to be tunneling, camping, or overall toxicity.  
---
When he talks about values in the game is the only time he is right. He cries about balance all the time and is encouraging noob killers to cry about balance rather than getting good. This makes discussion with those type of players really difficult because you just can't bring anything up without getting called entitled. Take a look at his comment section. Circle jerks are always expected but it's on a whole new level there.
---
This can only exacerbate the issues of extremely low/high rank queues being insane. It's gonna be a ridiculously stressful exercise to get high ranks (like if they add rank rewards) and you're completely fucked if there's 1 DC, if someone gives up on hook, or if a killer tunnels you preventing objectives and altruism, even if you live.
---
Right 2 perks counter every pallet on the map, good it's basically like vsing a legion except you don't know they're a legion untill it's too late. Seems balanced? I love how a new killer just straight up buffs every hillbilly like they needed it and literally nobody before me seems to complain about it.
---
Agreed, though I can see Suki_Izumi's point too. Maybe it'd flow better (and make the mori a little quicker) if she was saying the prayer WHILE picking the survivor off the ground, right before she blew chunks?
---
I do as part of a build: NOED (or Rancor), Haunted Grounds, Iron Maiden, and Make Your Choice.
---
Combine with Fragrant Tuft of Hair for when you really want to send a message.
---
Yeah probably because a majority of people think you're wrong and specifying after release when spirit is probably 3rd or 4th best killer makes you sound dumb
---
I would absolutely love that, please do consider doing that! Your art style is so cute
---
Bbq n chilli, worth investinh in lf just for bbq
---
Loving it. Atta’ boy by making this
---
You spawned as a crow.
---
Tbh they should just hide it. 
---
There is no rewards or point to in us actually being able to see it.
---
There is some point to the system existing as they do use it for light matchmaking but overall there is no reason for players to be able to view it.
---
Pips in general were adjusted. Unless you're blitzing gens, saving people left and right, winning every chase, and escape at the end, you're probably gonna safety pip or depip in red ranks. Likewise it's hard to depip as you go lower.
---
The issue still comes that that means a hugely varied skill level is going to be sitting in the mid ranks leaving incredibly unbalanced matchmaking still. It essentially takes all the issues from people intentionally depiping and makes it the norm: long queue times followed by unbalanced matchmaking at both extreme ends of matchmaking, and random matchmaking in the middle where you could be against a god tier player who doesn't feel like ranking up, or a brand new player that just got their hand held up to rank 10.
---
Concept is cool.. but i think she is a bit overtuned
---
Plz make this NSFW. This is disgusting to see
---
I have at least 200 hours on pig alone and this new killer I feel like is gonna be amazing
---
Because players asked for making it harder to reach rank 1.
---
So higher rank you go, the harder it is to safety/pip.  
---
Hell yeah Electric Wizard
---
I am glad to admit spirit is maybe better than billy currently.  But when she was released she was trash and i have never stated anything else. The amount of people agreeing with me is irrelevant in an argument. 
---
Mario Brothers fuck Waluigi with flashlight
---
So far my favorite build is the endgame build. NOED, Blood warden, remember me, and rancor. I normally use my traps throughout the game just to slow them down a little bit. I normally try and kill my obsession before the gates are powered, but if not you can just rancor them.  
---
Yeah but closing the hatch would make it killer favoured if you know what I mean. The killer would still just camp the hatch or return to the hatch just before but it opened. Which would mean the survivor either jumps in and is caught or the killer closes the hatch and the survivor has to win a chase and not be caught when the hatch opens again. 
---
Really because the post is about how these streamers react to killers not being nurse tier. And my response to you is that you're wrong, 3 killers have been released that are good. You said no killers have been released since huntress that are good, you are wrong. You are also alone in your view that spirit legion and clown are weak and not good killers. It's not an argument because you are just spouting your bullshit opinion that no one agrees with.
---
Don't see how but ok
---
Might be a good idea
---
what are u talking about? shes as thicc as a stick
---
Wonderful.
---
I hope this inspires you to do The Shape next:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjQyCs-toos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjQyCs-toos)
---
yes
---
That also happend to me today xD
---
Meaning he/she/it cannot survive against her, and thinks she is overpowered 
---
Suuuureeee
---
I think they meant overpowered. Probably regarding how you can down several people in a few seconds if you got the corrupted fountain even over objects without much precision. Spray and pray.
---
I am arguing that his reaction to calling killers on release has been justified after huntress. I have said multiple times spirit is good nowadays. Can you read or do you need me to articulate even more clear?
---
BBQaC - it makes the progression go twice as fast, so should always be your first get for efficiency sakes, plus the aura reading can be nifty. 
---
Enduring would be the next get, it’s useful in a myriad of situations, can be universally used on all Killers (minus maybe Nurse) and can reduce the annoyance of DS (RIP). 
---
Then it’s a toss up between Nurse’s Calling (Nurse), Ruin (Hag) and Spirit Fury (Spirit). Ruin can be a game winner if it stays up, it can also be a -perk if it gets broken quickly. But i’d probably go for that next. 
---
She seems balanced, not overly strong or weak. It was good that that gave her the standard 115% ms otherwise trying to catch survivors with the purge would've been a liability in power and a pain. I think it's okay that survivors can fully heal at the fountains because there's a fair trade off there with giving your power a huntress-esque ability to injure and down survivors from a distance. She is also definitely a huge upgrade from the legion in terms of balance and fun for both sides. I hope she doesn't get nerfed and she doesn't need any sort of buff in my opinion. Devs did good with this killer. 
---
Awww Claudette so adorable 
---
I use Starbucks employee apron (the green one) for the lulz
---
I wish Feng had some decent clothing, instead of GLOWING NEON HAIR IN 3 DIFFERENT COLORS
---
Meg has cool clothes, but I think her hairstyles are lacking
---
Nea has cool clothes and some cool hairstyles tho. Also a killer costume
---
Kate has a cool hairstyle (the one with shades), but her clothes are... sad.
---
As a Fengy main, I used to hate her cosmetics too. I still kinda do, but things got much better after I paired the black &amp; white plaid skirt with the dark blue cardigan and her default hairstyle for the ultimate schoolgirl look.
---
We still need Bunny Feng though :l
---
I like Monto.
---
Yes, but unless he's talking about hard numbers and values I ignore it.
---
I also try to ignore his background gameplay, because 80% of the time he's tunneling somebody to death or patrolling the basement.
---
Sloppy Butcher is a decent neutral perk, no matter the build.
---
Upvoted for the godly perk selection
---
Not to make you look like a complete clown on the Internet, but it's actually the other way around! The TTCM makers were big fans of DBD and based Leatherface on Hillbilly. It's actually a really common mistake tho, so don't sweat it :)
---
Well too bad we are talking about killer viability and this is a post about these 2 streamers crying for nurse and Billy tier killers. Then followed by you spouting bullshit that a single good killer hasn't been released since huntress. Being wrong is hard for you clearly =/
---
If you’re stupid enough to be within close proximity with other survivors after the clearly audible **DING**, then you deserve to get floored. 
---
I go stealthy whenever I hear it, I rarely have to deal with it. Treat it like a mini Myers Tier 3 and you’ll be golden. 
---
You know what, I'm just fine with that.
---
Akkadian. I'm trying to decipher what she's saying. 
---
Reading this gave me a severe aneurism
---
Yes. 
---
It's your account from about a week ago.
---
He puts hag at D teir based on his own awful hag gameplay.
---
When presented with evidence of her actualy being good or even top teir he refers to his play and thus hag is still trash.
---
In the hag buff vid he unironicly called shoe her best addon *the addon that removes her teleport*.
---
Glad to know you're not only a master philosopher, but also a medical expert!
---
Tyde has a tendency to refuse admitting he is or was wrong about something, even if he is, in fact, wrong.
---
It’s a highly limited range, there’s no long range snipes like the Huntress. It’s equivalent to clumping up against Leatherface or Legion. You know that’s a bad play, so you shouldn’t complain when it happens. 
---
I agree though, people are still learning. Which is exactly why they should heed the advice and not clump together when The Plague has corrupted spew. 
---
I bet you can even say that they are some *pesky plumbers*
---
It's a shitload of boring a generic add-ons, if you ask me.
---
I was expecting a lot of "if fully infected, survivors become exhausted/blinded/hindered" etc add-ons. 
---
Talk about getting disappointed. Good job, developers.
---
Feels like such a waste but I guess it's the only way to deal with it, I wish sometimes the entire DBD-community would just have to face Hillbilly's for the next 2 weeks and see if people still think it's balanced, thanks for serious response anyways.
---
The opportunities..
---
Then the killer is a Huntress and it's all a waste.
---
sigh *Unzips dick*
---
As you can see I've tanked a good 30 downvotes for even asking how to counter it, let alone complaining about it. That's why I think nobody here discusses balance, unless ofcourse it's a bunch of killers circlejerking DS because they just parrot anything truetalent says. 
---
her skirts r just so terrible it hurts &gt;&lt;
---
Seemed pretty long in the videos I was watching and that it is over everything. Yeah not 1/2 across the map but in a chase theres not many times they wont he able to hit you with it. I'm just hoping it doesnt turn into another legion situation. I want the game to be fun, but I feel like they're running out of potential powers so they're just mixing them lol.
---
Why tho. There’s supposed to be a difference between t1 and t2
---
Underrated comment
---
im trying to replicate the ingame physics for her chest , and i think it cameout well.. i will post teh video once its done rendering..
---
I don't think either killer change is that significant, I just think it's dumb because now most feedback about DS is far more likely to be drowned out by cried of unfairness.
---
Most discussions already got a lot of "If DS is nerfed, X, Y and Z killer perk should be nerfed too." Instead they've buffed 2 of the most common killer perks at the same time which is just asking for complaints, however small the buffs.
---
Love ur posts
---
Saw this one coming a mile away. Most really coordinated survivors don't heal so that they can stick gens anyway.
---
No
---
I wonder why BBQ isn't 128m tho
---
Happend to me today, i just spawned up there 
---
You can’t do it over high walls, so jungle gyms can still be a pain. Plus the hit box is really janky, so sometimes you will ‘hit’ someone and actually just waste a lot of time. 
---
I like her power, it’ll need some tweaking but it’s **far** less oppressive than a moonwalking Legion. I explore you to play the PTB on both sides to fully appreciate the Killer gameplay. Watching videos is fine, but don’t let that be what develops your opinion. 
---
People will go crazy on either saying shes op or to weak.
---
Give it some time until people figure out how to play her and how to play against her.
---
I absolutely love the new killer but I appreciate the meme lol
---
The issue comes from only looking at those add ons from the perspective of "will the RBT kill a survivor?"
---
One extra box, it helps for that. It's more to search, more chances of getting interrupted, more chances of chases being near boxes you need.
---
The important value to consider is that even if they have to search one extra box along the way, that's a large chunk of the map they have to run + search time. It adds significant value to Pig's stalling which is the *primary* goal of RBTs. 'Game Over' is just a significant enough motivator to make sure they don't ignore the trap.
---
Nice work, once again
---
Depends on the killer. Some perks work better on some killers than others. Monitor and Abuse from the Doctor is great on (the Shape) and the Legion, but pretty meh on most other killers. Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher are both perks that can prevent healing rather nicely, extending the game and makin' your life easier. Perks like Bloodhound are better on killers that struggle with tracking, like the Spirit, versus killers like the Legion, who can use it for cheese. Stridor is really nice on the Spirit. BBQ from Leatherface is amazing for information and bloodpoints, and Ruin, while so-so on some maps for how quickly they get broken, are god-tier on some other maps (Lery's, the Swamp maps).
---
A personal favorite is Franklin's. Generally useful, annoys survivor, situational.
---
My man! (Or lady!) 
---
Awesome! Thanks for the clarification. And keep up the good work!
---
If you know what you’re doing she’s pretty over powered. Since her charge is near instant, no cooldown and half a second of reduced movement speed all she has to do is ride ass to instadown you. On top of this her blood vomit has ridiculous range and there’s very little hope of avoiding it since it’s a god damn fire hose. To me she’s basically huntress and legion blended in to one killer.
---
I disagreed with the points he made, but despite that I adore the new killer and don't think she's terrible at all
---
Im sorry but if the survs just play dumb and cant hold a chase, am I supposed to LET them do it? It's supposed to back and forth, if they dont well I shouldnt have to play bad on purpose, it's their fault for being bad. Same goes both ways obviously. 
---
What’s so unbelievable about it?
---
The streamer privilege! I tend to bring a Green mori - for the content. 
---
*shoots*
---
Some context, everybody except for the Killer had massive player models like this. I didn't get a chase to ask the others because the Killer instaquit in post-game. I hope this gets fixed before it hits the live servers, /u/not_Queen_bhvr 
---
Plagues not weak, She's solidly Mid-Mid tier without addons and High mid low-high tier with addons.
---
&gt;The instaheal makes no sense
---
This i agree with, The fountains shouldn't raise your healthstate it should only heal your sickness and broken status.
---
&gt;the plague is not a problem at all for survivors and its too long to take them down. 
---
Not if you use it properly. The closer to the survivor you are and the more of the vomit you hit them with the faster their sickness builds. If you're point blank and hit them with almost all the vomit then you instantly put them into broken and injured status, this is done without giving them a speed boost. Then you use your 115% movement to instantly catch them and smack them down.
---
Because it's awful to play against? 
---
Maybe you consider it a meme but there is nothing the survivor can do against it.
---
Playing as her, I feel she is fairly balanced. As long as you have access to loops and vaults when she is around, like most killers, her vomit is not a big risk. When you are in the open, taking a fully charged is basically a free hit with no speed boost leaving you open to going down quickly. I feel the instant heal fountains help counter this affect. I just hope people actually give it some time, watch other people play and learn how to play/counter before we start a riot of "Broken/OP" like we did Freddy.
---
They need to change it so the fountains remove the sickness and broken status, then it would be perfect. Or if they insist on it healing them then make it a 15-20 second action and notify the killer when they use it.
---
I'm sorry about that. We ended it quite a long time ago so you won't need to worry about it anymore. If you'd like I can unban you but I completely understand if you'd rather not bother
---
Idk about you buy I like getting to play the game when I play a videogame, and I'm getting none of it against Legion. 
---
I might stomach a regular Legion, but if I start getting moonwalked or frank's mixtape is in use I'd rather DC/die on hook.
---
TBH though Spirit was weak when she first released, they gave her like 3 updates after her release to bring her to where she is now.
---
How is it big risk? Lol it’s all reward just take the half second to charge it and hold it while running are full movement speed again.. wait till you got a clear shot, unlock full stack and instantly down the survivor. 
---
&gt; Most of the time survivors get find the key in their first box anyways 
---
Haha since when??
---
Which it's not &gt; followed by "because the other sheep of this subreddit say so" fuck outta here with your fucking brainded sheepmentality.
---
Same thing. 
---
Excuse me, WTF
---
Nurse is a pain yes, but there is at least somewhat of a degree that the Nurse needs to be decent to actually kill you, otherwise you can just juke the blinks most of the time. 
---
Legion has no such Skill floor as the game gives you everything you need to win with him, your told where survivors are, their is no timing required in jumping over vaults, you can miss your attack as many times as you want since the swing recovery is so short, then stack on Franks Mixtape or just the moonwalking exploit and its basically impossible to avoid even the most dense legion.
---
Add diversion to that.
---
Brilliant, you should do more of these.
---
TBF, he's not wrong. Spirit Fury isn't OP. It's good but not something that's impossible to play against. Also, while the person you're responding to sounds like a dick, he's not wrong, you have to get better. You counter SF the same way you counter Billy, by looping. Just don't drop the pallets unless you absolutely have to. Spirit Fury only gets use from you dropping pallets. Also, if you're the one in the chase, pay attention to how many pallets have been broken. If it's 2 (or more) then realize the next pallet stun you go for won't be a long enough stun for you to get away. If you drop the pallet before the killer is close enough for the stun, SF won't trigger. 
---
That's better than leaving moonwalking in the game? I'd rather have get stabbed like 4 times by his power than have literally no way of counterplay to getting moonwalked.
---
Yes, bhvr hire this guy.
---
She’s just too god damn thicc
---
Why would you throw down every pallet that early into the game? 
---
Thank you! 
---
Woah that's dangerous
---
Karen, let me see my fucking kids.
---
BBQ&amp;C, ruin, M&amp;A, sloppy butcher, make your choice, enduring and nurses calling if your gonna be playing Myers and spirit a lot. 
---
&gt;nobody before me seems to complain about it
---
That should be your biggest indicator that it's not as strong a perk as you're making it out to be. 
---
Well it kinda does reward it and kinda doesn't, since if you completely shit on the survivors at the start of the game and down them all early then you get punished.
---
How TF can anyone say she's under powered I've seen videos of people downing multiple people in seconds if that's not strong enough for some people tgen you might as well trap the survivors in cages for the rest of the match
---
Claudette: **It's over Adiris, I have the high ground!"*
---
Plague: **YOU UNDERESTEMATE MY POWER**
---
I like that you used emplore lol. Yeah, I plan on playing the PTB and I always play both sides with it. I've just been busy with work and havent downloaded it yet.
---
they should take out the aura reading for a week to test this, because i just cant believe it. A lot of killers would drop it, especially in higher rank.
---
Just go into KYF and read them, that's what I did.
---
You've been extremely combative with anyone that challenges your opinion. You're toxic with your responses to even suggestions on what to do and then keep using strawman arguments like bringing up DS to support your stance. This is why you're being downvoted. Not because of some circle jerk, but because of your attitude. 
---
You are excused, WTF indeed...
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor and play plenty of Billys. You're making a mountain out of an ant hill. 
---
She'll have a standard m1killer build. Nothing do do with healing in her build though for sure given how survivors heal at fountains.
---
Nurses/sloppy etc wonr work.
---
Probably standard
---
Whispers, bbq, enduring, sprit fury, ruin , brutal strength
---
Her mori translation is "can't help being A gemini"
---
Shhhhhh. It's circlejerk hate time. 
---
Don’t forget her thoughts and prayers!
---
ye if it myers i totally get every totem i see and hope other do the same. just like wraith
---
Two Claudettes, one plague 
---
Apparently 12
---
*Stay there*
---
On red ranks billy is a regular visitor.
---
Besides that,as the other guy said, Spirit Fury is usually run together with enduring.
---
Honestly, enduring is much worse compared to SF since it allows all 115% Killer to simply disrespect pallets anyways.
---
SF is simply the cherry on top
---
Besides dropping pallets early you can try to keep track of how many pallets have been destroyed,which is rather difficult unless you run alert
---
Never drop the pallet if you run the risk of getting hit in the process.
---
The stun recovery is much faster than the hit animation from the killer.
---
Its literally like being exposed.
---
If you drop pallets early you create a barrier between you and the killer
---
He can choose to destroy or walk around it which offers you the potental to dance around it
---
By doing that you already wasted two perk slots
---
With a semi competent team you can easily abuse this.
---
Yes loops are slightly less effective,but two wasted perks is a huge gain.
---
Sick
---
most pallets can be ran around 3 times, so count each loop and on the third, try to fake it (stop at the paller and then run around again) or if they're close, throw it down. watch utube vids and/or maybe use Windows of Opportunity, good perk for looping.
---
or, you can work on your stealth and make builds to break chase, (lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet, iron will, calmspirit, urban evasion, light weight etc)
---
Im 17 so... idk...
---
Well that's very mature of you
---
I c what u did there 
---
🤣 I was waiting for this, seriously though ? Ir you don't know
---
27 here. 
---
Honestly why not have the Emblem be based on the actual Healthbar of survivors on the Hook, so the more the bar goes down the more point you get, bam at least the asses that suicide on the hook let the killer still get their points, shoot i don't understand why DCing isn't just considered a killer outright aswell.
---
Also i guess your not allowed to rank up if you use a Mori in a match?
---
Thank you fellow scientist

She's fine but there are a few things I'd like changed. Fountains should cure plague and broken but not fully heal and in exchange corrupt purge is a one time use or the meter burns faster when you use it. Dark Devotion is absolute ass as it's very situational and survivors will still hear the killer's heavy stomps if they pay attention. Her power doesn't seem to work on totems or exit gate doors either. Also one complaint for the survivor, Poised should only work for gens you complete because randomly losing scratch marks for 10 seconds in a chase is ridiculous.
---
If you look at her face when selecting her in the lobby you can see her teeths and they are pretty fucked
---
The average age of gamers in general is a little over 30, IIRC, and this is not really a game that most parents would be okay with buying for their little Timmy or Tammy.  
---
I would argue the younger DbD players are typically 15, while the average age is probably close to mid-20's.  
---
Purely speculation, of course. As far as I know, there is no data to go off.
---
I do know, she is pretty powerful if you know how to aim her vom stream. I, however, have the aim of a potato.
---
Playing as survivor, the mechanics are pretty cool, similar to The Pig with RBT being removed, however any cleansing pool  can be used, but becomes unusable for a period of time after use.
---
"I don't recognize it so it must be nothing"
---
Yeah it's almost certainly sumerian or akkadian or similar
---
red ranks gets me away from people who just bought the game away from people who only have like 20 hrs in the game. so that way im with people and facing people that actually have a decent perk build. have you played during rank reset the amount of potatos increases a lot because we get closer to the starter ranks.
---
😭😭😭😭😭
---
Ok thanks :)
---
Exactly!!! Like come on, literally every other survivor has gotten a unique outfit since then. 
---
It’s not like she’s an unpopular survivor, either. I see tons of Fengs.
---
Holy shit that's for Real?! LoL
---
But why 
---
ok? 
---
Kate’s hair is way too short ngl 
---
Never stop vomiting
---
REEEEEE
---
Wait, isn't Jane Latina...? Curvy + Romero. I don't understand why you would think it's slightly racist to cosplay as Feng but Jane is fine, based off your logic then?
---
As a latina, I really don't care, but you're more than likely better at cosplaying the other characters since you're fair skinned, than if I were to try cosplaying Meg , kate, or Nea (white). I'm olive skinned, dark hair, with Latina goodies so i'd look ridiculous. 
---
All I'm saying is own up to it, don't throw the racist card or say it was a shit/joke post. You wanted attention for your cosplay and you got it. That's all good. It's cool. Kind of the point of cosplaying, isn't it? 
---
I'd guess around 18-20. I'm 33, so definitely older than average. 
---
I’m turning 20 this month
---
That would be dramatic
---
🤣 potato aim lives among us all, and I assumed she would be fairly powerful,what about her perks ?
---
This is incredible 
---
"We"? Pretty sure you're alone here judging by the downvotes. Lmao.
---
Timetables check out. 
---
Haha same! I always watch the vods after the match. 90% of the time the killer is bitching, but in some weird cases they actually praise me. 
---
Weird flex: https://clips.twitch.tv/SparklingAssiduousCoyoteUWot
---
I think all they’ve said about it is “it’s harder because the hoodie and hair would be separate.” Not sure if that’s true though.
---
They could just make the hoodie down...but you know. Bhvr said fuck feng min lives
---
You will get caught and hit its inevitable, what takes skill it wasting the killers time for as long as possible so your team can get work done. 
---
I would of been happier with small insects or something, 
---
I hate how streamers always DC, even if it's just from seeing a killer they don't like. They're fucking over their whole team and ruining the game because they're entitled and usually with at least 1 SWF who also DCs. There need to be greater punishments for DCs, I'd argue for bans if it's consistent and deliberate 
---
28, but I identify as a 21 year old. 
---
When I first got into DBD he was one of the first content creators that I stumbled across. I watched him for quite awhile but it got to the point where this made him unwatchable to me. 
---
Consider it done!
---
The name sounds familiar and I don't recall ever hearing anything about you being banned so chances are I wasn't even informed. I read chat through bot and not Twitch itself and the bot doesn't inform me about any commands being used.
---
Sorry again man 💕 I just want this community to love each other! I've changed a lot since how I was when I first gained traction 💕
---
Why not? lol
---
fully automatic assault vomit. bitch needs to get whacked in the tits with the nerf stick.
---
Pretty sure Meg has the most cosmetics out of everyone in the game. 
---
You know they can see you if they hit another survivor in Feral, right?
---
Emetophilia 
---
Nice pants :D
---
Ik thats the people who likes to loop and who have builds for that but my builds are more for gen rushing
---
🤣 hilarious, the best part is I made a post saying she would be OP and people got mad and slammed downvotes, oh well hopefully shes fun to play 
---
The top panel should honestly say “Any streamers/youtuber first impression or reaction to anything in this game” 
---
Any of them are entertaining sure, but every last one is either a drama llama or have hard biased opinions that shouldn’t impact your decision to like or dislike a character. 
---
This is how they'll "fix" match making. Make everyone rank 10 and no more waiting. /s
---
sounds like commie propaganda to me
---
He uses it as a joke, nothing else.
---
How is the generator perk I dont remember the name 
---
While I think one guy here is kinda harsh, I get his point, this is a game about killing helpless survivors, I dont think we should be too concerned about triggering people 
---
25!
---
I guess we'll see then
---
It's good for small maps, slows the game down at the start for 80-100-120 seconds.  Gives you time to track down survivors.
---
Thanks I'll try and look for them
---
Why only small maps? Its sound very useful to me 
---
Maybe it is too harsh, but I would rather it be too harsh than the passive system it is now. In my first month of playing survivor I got to red ranks.
---
I hear this a lot. Wanna tell me why?
---
If you find every surv in the same area, and down everyone fast, then sacrifice them since theyre all on the ground, the system would depip you for not giving them a chance, despite them being at fault, THAT is my problem. The system tells you to not punish their mistake, and just down and hook 1 of them.
---
Again I'm talking about design here, personally I like the change since I can stay in purples without having to derank or anything, but it's still an objectively terrible change.
---
I doubt they’ll buff her. Or if they do it’ll go with a nerf at the same time.
---
The killing is presented before you even start the game, so you can just not buy the game if it bothers you. What about all the people who can no longer play survivor in case they run into the Plague?
---
It's a step in the right direction. 
---
I know, I was reffering to anyone that thinks she needs a buff

1.9.2 was the worst time to purchase the game
---
He was one of the first content creators I watched too. He's how I learned what Keys and Maps are for.
---
I still watch his informational stuff sometimes, but never any of his livestreams or gameplay.
---
Ask for the sweet release of death. But that's what I do in every situation so eh
---
If by "right direction" you mean the edge of the cliff then I agree
---
Anyone else have the feeling that this killer is the second worst idea the devs have had? (We all know Legion was worst)
---
&gt;Killer vomits on survivor and hits them
---
&gt;the survivor runs away and starts to get healed 
---
&gt;the plague "so it begins"
---
That’s true. Oh well I guess we’ll have to continue the long hatch chase until the devs think of something to make it more even for both sides. 
---
And here I am, complaining to my friends about how I do not find the puke gross enough and it's too cartony for my taste. She just inhales air like she's surprised and then spits some green juice or blood, I was expecting some BLUARRGHH UGH MP COFCOF, like I really wanted the puke to  be yellow and putrid and for she to be making sounds that make you sick, she should suffer each time she pukes still she's a romanticed face of sickness. I understand why you can find it sick tho if you are too sensitive, but its the same story as the clown. They are very toned down for what they could (and should) have been for a horror game.
---
Ranking up right now is a joke. It is way to easy to rank up. In my first month of playing survivor I got to red ranks. 
---
Now it is really fucking hard to rank up. This is a step in the right direction because the devs understand that ranking up was too easy - the next step is to find the perfect middle ground. How about you stop being so pessimistic and accept this.
---
What are your specs?
---
What is your windows version?
---
Are your drivers up to date?
---
Did you verify integrity of contents?
---
You could always play Claudette and go against the stereotype! For the sake of fashion!
---
I guess Plague really likes playing with her food if she keeps throwing it back up.  
---
Wasn't Ace's last new one not including the CNY also around July/August?
---
24 
---
Or you could not message the killer crying about how he/she played in the first place...
---
Me neither XD
---
Spiders! Or cockroaches.
---
And thats balanced. :) a free out of jail card isn’t 
---
Ahegao 
---
To summarise:
---
This was the original Howling Grounds event, a lunar event similar to the recent one in January.
---
There was only one cosmetic reward per side and the killer one was frankly a bit shite.
---
This was a time in which pallet vacuum still existed and pallet hitboxes were the size of Japan.
---
Along with this, there was a flashlight and pallet change that made it so there was no timing involved. You could blind or stun a killer at any point during the pickup animation, no matter how early, and it would play the entire animation BEFORE playing the entire stun and drop.
---
And on top of that, the bugs in the game were horrible. Certain perks flat out didn't work, and every game had about a 30% chance of hard crashing on the loading screen. It was hell.
---
They sound like an idiot but at the same time you sound like a baby. 
---
Yes it was, but don't you get nostalgic at all? 
---
Haven't you ever wanted to play a game on ~~Hard~~ Impossible Mode?
---
This is a problem too, I think benevolent should also get points for every survivor that escapes, not just unhooks. It's stupid that the survs would have to let them killer hook them to pip. 
---
And if someone does heal and she suddenly has the damaging vomit, just treat her like a T3 Myers and avoid her for the time being.
---
And if you do happen to get caught, treat her like an Iri Head Huntress and I wish you the best of luck lol
---
Nah she looks promising I'll buy this chapter for sure.
---
That’s a good question. I for one hate this new system on a killer. I feel it’s hella nerfing blood points . Gen rushing is a start and the shorter a game is the less points you get. How the hell am I going to chase a survivor and keep their swf group from bull rushing generators while I’m being looped to eternity? 
---
They punished camping killers: well that’s good minus the fact most of the camping killers aren’t doing it for BP, they do it because they enjoy upsetting people ( actual words from a camping Myers I had the....”pleasure” of playing against ) 
---
All and all it feels like they are taking the shotgun to killers that even feel a remote shard of pity and give the last man the hatch. Unless your a serious try hard ruthless person you won’t ever see red ranks. 
---
Idk, it's odd the add a puking killer...
---
Last time I checked, killer adept achievements require you to do 4k, getting merciless killer is not obligatory. So no, it doesnt
---
What else would they do rats? If they did a horde of rats dishonored would probably sue due to them having done that first.
---
Not all of them are killers by choice. Look at the Wraith, the Nurse, etc. Some are there because they enjoy killing (MM) others by force. She prayed to any god to save her and the Entity answered.
---
Still the stranger of killers
---
We all did want a plague related killer to be fair. Maybe a plague doctor but still this works
---
There’s definitely a certain point requirement. You can’t just bring a Mori and 4K or anything like that, unless you do a lot extra. I believe the actual achievement description is ‘achieve a merciless victory’ or something like that from the old ranking system.
---
Go google a list of phobias. For everyone you coddle avoiding vomit you probably scare off people afraid of breathing toxic gas. Both options probably make a germaphobe equally distressed. And in the end, the amount of people who legitimate quit the game because of issues with any given killer is probably close to single digits. You can't please everyone, and you can't make designs with kid gloves on to cover the thousands of possible irrational phobias any possible design could trigger.
---
*Huntress

I feel as if a plague doctor working in similar Manor of the plague would be nice. Only, without the puking part

Lol. Hell yeah. Rise up brother. I ain't complaining or criticizing like every single other comment. Let's do this. Because it's a game. Not something to be taken seriously. 
---
I love this LMAO
---
Gotta satisfy those that get off to two girls one cup somehow.
---
Not impossible to get a merciless, you just need to 4k with no gens done, and make sure that you at least 3 hook each survivor.  All chases must be less than 15 seconds, and you can't use insta downs otherwise you won't get enough chaser points.  Bear in mind it's possible to get a perfect game (32000 BP) and not get a merciless victory.
---
You think that was bad? Go back to 1.3! No sound 30 pallets, vaccums, infinites! Instant bnps and blinds. You kids these days have it easy!
---
I shake my old man's cane at you
---
Sure, sure.  Just remember to stay hopeful enough to buy our DLC along the way.
---
Did I mention that each incremental change comes with each DLC release?  You'd just as well buy each DLC as it's released and be ready for the full framerate fix!  Stay hopeful!
---
Fixing something which should never have been broken is a perfectly acceptable marketing gimmick to sell more DLC.  In the meantime, stay hopeful and buy more DLC.
---
Where is that 5 minutes Shrek meme for DbD?
---
Isn't it worth it to reduce the amount of people affected, even if we can't help everyone?
---
It's a small payoff, but it's an even smaller effort.
---
im pretty sure this counts as holding the game hostage 🤣
---
Would gas be any less scary than vomit?
---
What the hell is even he saying? Lol I don't even. 
---
But yeah, I generally have pretty good experiences playing against streamers. The bad ones are usually in a decked out SWF. Most people with ttv in their name are just smaller people looking trying to give awareness and are just genuinely having fun, in my experience. 
---
Since we're sharing, [here’s a time where i did mori a godly (but big bully) survivor lmao. ](https://youtu.be/ZPGAlZmktWM)
---
No offense to our boi tru3 but he was playing her really bad. I watched play for about an hour and he rarely used her power unless he had addons or corrupt purge. I would honestly say she is strong and could be either A or B tier.
---
"Delicious."
---
she needs to be tall to arc that *vile purge*
---
only got a 2k, the other 2 Got out 
---
I'd rather have them take this advice for the newer maps instead of using their time re-doing older maps.
---
I agree the map is good.
---
That was basically the time when any kind of stun during the pick up animation would stun the killer and free the grabbed survivor directly afterwards. That change went down in history as the worst change that the devs had ever made, it was reverted after 2 days if I remember correctly.
---
Parabéns! Não acho que teria a tenacidade para alcançar um feito como esse :P

110% or 115%?
---
you know thats reportable?
---
In 2 weeks. 
---
Patch works on a 6 week schedule:
---
You get a new killer, 6 weeks after we get a bug fix patch, 6 week after a new killer and so on.
---
Before every of these patches, we get a 2 week play testing on the ptb. 
---
prepare for some Reports lol
---
Am I the only one who kind of liked the random on/off chase music? It made the game more- I don't want to say fun, but I guess the word I'm looking for is intense. You had to CONSTANTLY be on the lookout for the killer- Idk how many times when playing with a friend, we would think we're doing fine, only to turn and see Hillbilly mouthbreathing at us through a window. Not to mention thinking you're all golden and suddenly wild intense chase music and no one's near you but a Nea. Probably unpopular opinion, but I thought it was fun. 
---
Eh, good point, but Huntress or Plague take em out.
---
Still not as bad as the patch that let Survivors flashlight stun the Killer out of the hooking animation. That was hell.
---
It has a minimum range, not a maximum one
---
115
---
**G A R B O**
---
Playing Legion should be reportable. Lmao. I'm not actually going to do it... Sounds funny af tho 
---
115% I believe
---
20
---
When I tried getting the adept achievement with spirit, I ofc used the mori given to me by rancor, and yet I ended up not getting the achievement despite getting a 4k...
---
So even 1 mori is risky.
---
well, you seem weird....
---
I think she’s pretty strong, but it could be because she’s been out for literally only a day, but already it seems like she has a high skill ceiling, and is very dangerous for survivors in chases. I’m not too sure about the fountains healing people though.
---
Yeah he’s been playing her in a basic ass way And he’s just been complaining about EVERYTHING. Saying she’s weaker than the pig? Nah
---
Watch his new YT video. He learned how to play her a lot better now. 
---
Spies from the Shadows now actually recruits one survivor, changing the meta!
---
Okay. Cool. Thx
---
DECISIVE STRIKE IS NOW THE MOST WORTHLESS PERK IN THE GAME.
---
ITS NERF HAS EFFECTIVELY KILLED ANY POINT IN USING IT. THE NERF IS GOOD *IN CONCEPT*, BUT IN EXECUTION, IT HAS MADE IT ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS TO RUN THE PERK. EVEN NO MITHER YOU COULD ARGUE IS MORE USEFUL THAN DS BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY COMBINES TWO PERKS, IRON WILL AND UNBREAKABLE, INTO ONE.
---
MY PROOF? TWO WORDS:
---
MEMENTO MORI.(/intensifies)
---
GG, DBD DEVS. GG.
---
Because killers that camp dont care or understand pipping and it wont do anything to curb the behavior? 
---
Yeah I actually kinda agree with you. It’s definitely an odd choice. It’s not like the game is super serious, but it seems kind of... out of place. 
---
Fuck Evan and Herman though
---
Bamboozle 
---
dae freddy sucks and that DS is OP? 
---
PC numbers are still massive and its one of the top 20 played games on steam in terms of online players (currently 16th and 22k+ players online)
---
&gt; FUCK PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE HATCH THAT I OPENED MY FUCKING SELF.
---
YOU CAN TAKE IT TOO IF YOU USED A KEY
---
Legion bad, haha
---
As a fellow Megan I agree with this statement
---
So you sound like a survivor main. Have you ever played killer? You do realize that they queue up instantly? And as you know survivors can wait a long time for a lobby. So unless they are the best at timing completely different queue models, AND the killer and survivor are compatible ranks......... your theory is invalid. It’s called *farming.*
---
People who are Green ranks have the same skill level as people in red ranks; red ranks only indicates how many hours your play, not how skillful you are.
---
MAYBE HAVE AN INTERNAL TIMER START ONCE ALL 4 SURVIVOR SPOTS ARE FILLED.  IF THE TIMER STOPS IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS, THEN IT CAN REASONABLY BE ASSUMED AN INTENTIONAL QUIT. 
---
It's one less loop per loop at most to neuter the perk, not exactly the difference between having pallets at endgame and having them all used up by 2 gens.
---
Also Boobs, she literally has the largest rack in the game (with a tasteful sideboob on the lobby screen too).
---
Solid meme
---
*Pallet slam*
---
But is Legion as fun as the Spirit
---
They should, iron will and the new calm spirit bugs me though, I feel like not screaming from being hit should be part of iron will.
---
Lol, your mad...
---
I noticed that a lot of people either not using her vomit or too reliant on it.  You need to treat it as additional resource to your censer.  If the survivor is close to you, then hit it normally.  There's no reason not to, especially if they are already infected quite a bit.
---
But yeah, she's fast and strong.  I think most importantly, she can stop loops or at least present you with parting gift if you manage to get away from her.
---
OH ILL JUST TAKE ONE KEY OFF OF THIS *HUGE* KEYRING I HAVE AND POP OPEN THE HATCH 
---
Jane is the entity confirmed.
---
My friend also had this happen to her. I think it might just be a lighting bug possibly but it’s still weird. 
---
30 here. Shoot me a message if you want to swf sometime on ps4.
---
Yea, let's also remove killing, that triggers some people, so like, change it to something where they don't get sacrificed, but ride away happily on a rainbow. That would even change the gameplay, so why not implement it?
---
Because there shouldn't be anything scary in a horror game, let's actually just remove everything, what if someone gets triggered?
---
It's a horror game, there is going to be gross and scary shit, even Dead By Daylight is fairly tame in its "scary" content. 
---
nurse op, freddy worst kill eh.
---
&gt;tfw you’ll never have a qt Amazonian Babylon nurgle priestess waifu

Why even live?

Whhat wow
---
So do you really think the Plague isnt that good?Console pleb here so I cant try her myself but watching Zubat play all day yesterday she seemed ridiculously strong. Also watching Scott do a complete 180 flip throughout the day was mildly amusing. She basically functions similar to the Billy chainsaw except adds an annoying and obnoxious status effect on to you which when you cleanse it turns her into an easier to use huntress with a 115% movement speed. Its like damned if you do, damned if you dont. Cleanse yourself and buff her or just stay broken and power out gens but when she comes for you you’re basically screwed.
---
Of course, too early to tell and all but its eerily similar to Legion, except actually strong. 
---
What's purple hair got to do with this?
---
The rest I kinda get, but the hair?
---
Well that’s good to hear, when I was watching him it was pretty rough.
---
Obviously not, but the facts in this post cannot be ignored.
---
Bloodpoints has nothing to do with depipping. It's about Emblem points and the changes to ranking system that are on PTB.
---
Yeah, not ideal for sure. Save up your BPS and when 2x BP happens cycle through your characters and use them all. I can generally get a ton of BO this way. 
---
If you play Killer, setup a good doctor farming build. I can get 60-100k a game with mine. If you need help with the build let me know. 
---
Yes, as soon as you do any action/movement you go from invisible to transparent.
---
Kiddo was meant as a term of endearment, I apologize if it offended you. Nowhere in my post did I act as a tough guy, was trying to have a clear and conciese conversation to try and understand your opinion and outlook. However all you comeback with is cliche "u mad bro" &amp; "i got reacts on the internets I'm an edgelord master" style comments.
---
So again sorry if my assumption of you being younger then me offended you and sorry I wasted your time trying to have an actual conversation and didn't get angry.
---
Now that is a lie
---
Her phase had directional sound and her husk sparkled while using the power. They removed both and now she basically has no counter other than guessing and hoping you’re right. So technically he has a point but its useless because Spirit is in the Top 3 now.
---
Heard they’re planning on doing that when dedicated servers come out.
---
Not the person you are responding to but I can give my experience. I got a 3k and the last survivor was dead on hook. There were 2 gens left and she left through the hatch. I never camped or tunneled the entire time (I'd even let survivors go so I could infect more people). I fucking de pipped. This new system is trash.
---
Yeah, I wish you weren't forced to unlock teachables if you want to continue to level up a Killer. If we had an actual choice then we could avoid unlocking a bunch of shit tier perks. But it was a very deliberate design choice by the devs to force us to grind more. Either that or just not play Killers with terrible perks. 
---
Not sure but would guess 10-30 seconds
---
The good old "no u"
---
Weird. Guess I'm just super unlucky. I've never gotten one after ebony use. But then, the adept achievements have always been a bit buggy. 
---
Hm, I see. Thank you for clarifying
---
It's too harsh for its own good. I just played for 7 hours and got a grand total of 1 pip between both sides. I safety pipped on a 4K where I 3 hooked 2 survivors, 2 hooked the other 2. I safety pipped in games where I never got hit and did multiple gens. I depipped on a few 3Ks and a 4K. The one pip I did get was from a billy who wasn't hooking people and was only farming hits all match and even then in the farming match I barely pipped.
---
No. No one would say that. Stop saying it.
---
BPS: Bloody Party Streamers. They are a offering to double everyone (killer and 4 survivors) blood points (BP) in the lobby. So during 2x BP events you’ll get 3x instead of 2x. If the entire lobby uses them you get 6x BP.
---
Good build for killer farming:
---
BBQ&amp;C (4 stacks gives 2x BP)
---
Distressing (gives 2x BP in devious, and makes your terror radius huge)
---
Unnerving Presence (makes skill checks harder in your terror radius) 
---
Any fourth perk you’d like.
---
Focus on maxing devious first as it is normally the hardest to max, then after you hook everyone once or twice just run around hitting them and chasing them around. Watch the circles on the left of your screen when you get bloodpoints to see what you need to focus on more to fill that section. 
---
I watch a ttv who rarely dcs so they don't always DC 
---
GET A NEW JOB
---
Why? In a chase while being EW3 you will have a 40m terror radius. It couldn't be better on him imo
---
crazy idea here, but have you tried not giving a fuck about what others think/say? F them. Play the game the way you want to, say gg and insta leave the lobby. nothing good ever come from post game chat. just my 2 cents anyway
---
Thanks bro for the explanation 
---
Best add ons are the effectiveness of Vile Purge. They make it insanely easy to make a survivor broken. Think Franks Mixtape for Legion. Instead of 5 hits to down its 3. Instead of a perfect stream hitting a survivor its like 1-2 ok ones to break them.
---
I think you are confusing me with the person you were fighting with. Again, proving my point. 
---
Ok well lol. I hope they'll fix that
---
I miss old dbd, the dbd i fell in love with,  the dbd that had op survivors instead of op killers
---
The amount of downvotes tells me that there are people on this earth that SOMEHOW don't see the joke in this post and that amazes me.

Congrats, what are the 2 hidden trophies lol im at 80% 
---
So i’m a red rank killer at the moment. With 3 kills shouldn’t I at least get a safety pip? 
---
Same thoughts as you, however I got a question: Do all Devour Hope tiers give survivors the exposed status effect on 3 tokens every tier now?
---
The nurse grab one was the hardest for me. After two weeks of playing her I loaded in to a game with one person. I said i'd let her leave if she let me grab her and she did. I've never felt more satisfaction in my life.
---
I wouldnt say the average age of gamers is 30, thats way to high, just remember fortnite minecraft, and all other games kids flock to
---
The Entity started importing crows from Oldtown. Spies from the Shadows can now tell the killer if the season is about to change.
---
They effect skills checks differently but will both apply at the same time. I like overcharged instead of ruin as when they find ruin it’s gone. 
---
If you want to stall the game without ruin, find 3 gens that are close together so you can patrol them easily. Between unnerving and overcharged you will know the second someone goes on a gen and can go straight to them. They will burn through the first 3-4 gens very quick, but they won’t be able to finish one of those three without you harnessing them. Just don’t go too far in a chase or else the other survivors will sneak in and complete the final gen. 
---
This is disgusting lmao.
---
This is hilarious!
---
Just 4 questions. Age, killer/survivor, main character, rank. If you play killer/survivor equally, just take the survey twice. Nothing serious. I just wonder if there's a correlation between age and preferences/ranks, although I might never get enough data to find out. 
---
You don't want that.
---
Knowing what people know now the game would be a shit show.
---
Double pallets on every tile
---
ALWAYS fast vaults for just holding shift
---
Machine gun build
---
Trapping under the hook
---
I could go on
---
Didn't read username read the reply is this a crime? I assume a reply to me on a thread with someone is from that same someone not someone else who feels the need to interject their offence.
---
Never in my life have I used kiddo as an insult or a term of direspect.
---
What one takes as disrespect varies like beauty which is on the eye of the beholder.
---
 It didn't seem to offend him but offends you so much you feel the need to reply? Sorry if others have belittled you and hurt you so much you feel the need to keyboard warrior on behalf of a stranger who wasn't bothered enough by the term to mention so.
---
Maybe take your own advice and get some fresh air.
---
Shes b tier like most killers. Pretty balanced
---
They need to make timeout for people who intentionally DC like Cs go does , temporary BANS people
---
TEMPORARY BANS
---
Ok and how do i know if someone is on a gen?
---
Admittedly a different realm would make a map feel even more unique. However, realm largely only dictates atmosphere, and what kind of objects one might encounter in said realm. Now, the atmosphere in DbD is made up of 3 things: Sky color, lighting and all objects inside. If a different realm had to be made for every killer, what would certain ideas be to use for a different realm? Remember that they have to be playable and somewhat realistic. E.g. a realm with a pitch black sky and thick black smoke sounds very cool and scary, but would be incredibly difficult for the killer (and probably survivors alike), while a realm with a bright pink sky would seem very out of place. -- Additionally, if a map is entirely enclosed like the game map, where outside lighting and the sky are hidden, what's to say it's in a different realm per sé than another map, if there is no real indication of that being the case (aside from the intro screen text, but the text should be conform to the realm, not the other way around)?
---
You mention that you love (or hate) the maps for what they are, and changing them would devoid them of their classical feeling. With that, are you completely against the idea of ever changing them, or would you possibly be open to the idea, and like / dislike it depending on the result?
---
That's bullshit reasoning. Of course you don't "have" to play nice, but you *should* play fair. Even if most survivors don't give you a "gg", so what? That gives you no valid reason to shit on the rest.
---
You can do it, sure, go ahead. But don't act like you were somehow in the right or justified to do it because some other survivors are dicks.
---
The achievement has always been 4 survivors die.
---
They can be sacrificed/mori or even bleedout. 
---
The perk lasts for 2 minutes. Since it forces survivors to go to a certain half of the map, they are already building a late game 3 gen strategy for the killer, as they will likely go to nearby gens upon completing their current one, but since it forces the survivors onto one side of the map, unless they actively cross the map again, the above scenario will occur. Either way, it forces survivors to search for a generator that isn't blocked. On top of that, even when they finish a full gen, the perk may still have some time on it before they're unblocked. It seems very good.
---
Hm. Can't say I ever encountered this, sounds like a stereotype. Maybe it's a USA thing.
---
After you kick a generator, Overcharged will give you a noise alert if they miss the skill check when starting the gen which is a very difficult skillcheck. 
---
If they manage to hit the skill check, unnerving will make it hard to hit normal skills checks which will give you another alert. 
---
It’s great to practice in KYF if you have a few buddies to play with. If you don’t and are on PC, PM me a message and I can show you in game. 
---
I’m 28 and most of my friends that play are mid or late twenties. I’d guess the average age is early/ mid twenties
---
Absolute overkill lol
---
Yeah, sorry about that.
---
The problem for me is that in my current living situation I have to remain pretty quiet at all times, so it's pretty hard to sound excited when I have to be quiet af - it just results in something that sounds pretty forced even though my excitement is genuine - I'm just not able to portray it properly in my current situation.
---
Wow, two idiots in one message. 
---
I think a perk consistently doing it's job is better than an RNG perk
---
They finally colonized mars! And have internet apparently
---
I’m going to start saying this now post game, thanks
---
For some reason she wasn't clicking for him. Fair play to him. I had a few killers that didn't click for me either right away. Even following advice. Sometimes you just need to play them for a while to you figure out their rhythm. 
---
I mean, there are studies proving that the average age of gamers is over 30, but okay.  
---
Your source is not a source, just an example, and it does not by any means define the standard / average beyond being one number among millions.  
---
[Here's an actual source.](http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/EF2017_FinalDigital.pdf) It's a study made by the ESA in 2016, wherein they state the average age of a gamer is 35, and that there are more female gamers over the age of 18 than there are male gamers under the age of 18.  
---
Children and teenagers are a minority in the gaming community.
---
Can't argue with science. Gotta love Amanda.
---
Needs "neither" (or "both") in Main category. Many people play both a lot.
---
I had a survivor in post-game tell the killer to “plague me, daddy”.
---
So you’re saying the Plague is Jenny McCarthy?
---
THEY'RE IN THE TREES!
---
Don't they usually drop a Double BP weekend not long after a chapter release? The last one was at Christmas, so that would of been 3 months by the time chapter 11 is out (Maybe just wishful thinking)
---
Plus she has a perk that is anti gen rush. She's gonna shake up the meta a ton, no matter how they tweak the numbers.
---
Hi there, please refer [this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aybwmj/whats_the_average_age_of_dbd_players/ehzw8x5/) I made to another person.
---
Disagree on verticality because dealing with Balanced Landing can be a bitch and Haddonfield is just AIDS. 
---
Not unless the devs fix it and actually slow Survivors down when they drop down a certain height. Like you get slowed down for 2 seconds instead of a fraction of a second. Then it'd be fine. 
---
I'd like the snow plow loops in Mount Ormond to replace the ones in Autohaven Wreckers so they're long and insanely safe loops. 
---
I wasn't around back then. Someone provide me with context.
---
Bet you Luigi died first.
---
The new Trapper outfit is cool af. But it sucks that it's for the Trapper who is probably the worst Killer in the game. :( 
---
.... take my vote, you horrible bastard.
---
You're missing the point I was making completely. This isn't about whether the cooldown reduction was actually noticeable or not on old NOED or even NOED as a perk itself.
---
It was that BHVR can actually weaken a perk on the only Tier of it that matters, and people will still see it as a buff because the previous two tiers are now at least usable. 
---
I saw this somewhere else and it fits here, imagine if self-care only actually allowed you to heal yourself at Tier 3. Tiers 1 and 2 just gave the efficiency bonus for medkit healing. You would feel like those first two levels are a complete waste of space. 
---
That's the feeling BHVR is trying to eliminate by streamlining these outdated perk models.
---
Theres too much info to post in a comment, the best starting point would be to watch good streamers and youtube tutorials. 
---
You can Google or youtube search this stuff:
---
-Learn to recognize the difference between "safe" and "unsafe" pallets. Safe pallets can be looped (and shouldnt be wasted). 
---
-Look up how to correctly and directionally run through the common map obstacles, I.e., the killer shack, pig tree, T-walls, jungle gyms etc. Learning how to effectively navigate these specific structures will allow you to transfer those skills to other map tiles and structures. Chases really boil down to map knowledge amd ring-around-the-rosy. 
---
-In general, in a chase you want to run toward the middle of the map and buildings, create distance and break line of sight whenever possible. 
---
She could be looped before the buffs and the cooldown in phasewalking was attrocious, also you could tell when she was gaking , as the husk started glowing in blue if she used her power. Now she can't be looped, but phasewalking is a mutual mindgame for both the survivor and the spirit. I like her now
---
The locker and OoO thing was straight broken, through.
---
They never mention it.  
---
Most likely will be adjusted so that it takes stacks away when she uses the vomit that injures survivors. I think that gameplay is interesting for her though as it requires her to make people cleanse to work effectively and keep stacks. 
---
Adepts requires Merciless **Victory** and not Merciless Killer. You will only need to 4k.
---
THERES A THING CALLED IM THE ONLY ONE DOING ANY GENS AROUND THIS PLACE WITH RUIN UP MY ASS AND SOMEONE ELSE GETS THE HATCH, NOT EVEN ATTEMPTING ANYTHING!
---
This is very very accurate 
---
Walking backwards while following sounds and residual scratch marks/blood on the floor? There aren't many solutions to that other than slowing down killers movement speed while walking backwards, but that would mess up every killer and much of their mind-game potential. If anything should be proximity based it should be the chase mechanic. Currently the chase mechanic is sight and proximity based, seeing the survivor on your screen and having them within your terror radius = chase but if they also added: If you are within less than 8 meters of scratch marks or the blood trail after initiating a chase, then the chase is still on, then moon-walking would be much less effective. With legion however, this just means they take a few steps back away from your trail, let the chase end and then go investigate the area they saw you run in, and if you are mending, will likely find and down you anyway, but at least then you'd get some distance from them. 
---
It's really hard to balance Legion, but I know there's got to be people at BHVR working on a solution. We'll just have to deal with them as they are in the meantime.
---
Your just sad. 
---
I’m not sure it will help like people think it will. People are still gonna have terrible connections. I’ve played against survivors so laggy they skip so much they get a double dead hard.
---
Absolutely. Having won several high-profile tournaments with a monetary prize, a lot of perks that seem powerful like DS just aren't at the very highest level. Since it has pseudo counters like dribbling, and the fact that it can be used up fairly quick, it just isn't worth it compared to some other perks. Depending on the killer, OoO can very well completely break a killer's power, such as Wraith, Trapper, and Hag. Survivors know where you and your traps are and make it almost impossible to get a foothold. DS now is actually going to be extremely powerful with NO counters as well as popping up at a crucial time that the killer needs to eliminate someone.
---
(My team is Instant Dodge for those who care)
---
Tyde's wife took over for a video once and she seemed chill. Monto's girlfriend even joins his game/videos every now and then. She's more of a partner in crime.
---
I really dont understand how legion gets more hate then Nurse, Spirit, or Hag. 
---
Not defending them, but id much rather play against legion then them. 
---
i mean its not even having thicker skin for me, i honestly dont care what a bunch of random people from the internet think or say, couldn't care less. i learned early both sides will cry and be toxic if they don't get their way. killers dont get 4ks? muaah genrush. survivors get killed? muaaaah camping tunneling. even if they trully gen rushed, camp , tunneled and whatever it may be, it's done, post chat ain't fixing shit. toxic people will still behave in a toxic way , after all it's said and done. you just can't change people over a post game chat because you mean absolutely 0 to the person you are speaking to. i don't mean to sound like i don't do this either, sometimes i see myself trying to debate reason with random killers/survivors. i'm wasting my time really.
---
Then why did you tell them to not dc? It’s a good rule of thumb to not dc though.
---
I’ve been working on the platinum too, congrats!
---
That game is a decade old and I'm sad now.
---
I’m surprised there weren’t any jokes involving a kitchen. 
---
Get BBQ &amp; Chili off off Leatherface first. 
---
Everything else comes second. Get LF to lvl 35 for teachable BBQ. 
---
I like it. This will determine who are the real Good players from the mediocre ones. Same for killers. So only the best will get to r1 
---
He doesn't know, that's obvious xDDDDD
---
It depends on the killer/survivors. Generally 15 minutes if they aren’t very good. A decent group of survivors can clear most gens in like 5 minutes. If the killer is decent, he can pressure the survivors and make the game last a bit longer.
---
Generally speaking though, good survivors can clear gens quick.
---
Yeah, it happens on both versions of dbd
---
They should just remove rank entirely. It's never mattered. It doesn't even matter for match making as the system does whatever it wants any way. I will never understand the people that care about pips. 
---
Of course it’s a Claudette in the tree. 
---
They also aren’t hurting or attacking anyone here. Why downvote someone for doing nothing? Just makes people look petty. 
---
It depends on other Emblems.
---
You think? I just tought of it as a neat little feature.
---
So maybe like making his reappearance or disappearance time take longer? Or maybe he becomes considerably slower when cloaked. Like, really slow.
---
TydeTyme= Moron who sucks at the game 
---
I HATE IT WHEN KILLERS HOLD THE GAME HOSTAGE AND DINT TRY TO HIT YOU IN THE END EVEN WHEN YOU STOP. IT TAKES ME OUT OF THE IMMERSION AND WASTES MY TIME. IT DOESNT EVEN ADD THAT MANY POINTS AT THE END FIR FARMING PURPOSES AND ITS HAPPENING THE MORE I RANK UP (AROUND 5 AND 6) THE END AND THANK YOU! 
---
For real? God, I would hate to face a Spirit with that add-on.

Omg what the hell
---
No thanks I would never want the player base segregated by payable map packs go to CoD for that one my friend. 
---
Can plague put you in the dying state by just vomiting? Genuinly don't know
---
And yet lots of people who get in my lobbies come hang out with me after the match. Interesting...
---
I stream on twitch but dont put ttv in my name I promote myself after the stream
---
I only have like 100 hours played and from experience sometimes skill checks can get a little bit laggy I know, but overall it was pretty fine for me :))
---
Epic.
---
The sounds from coughing and vomiting sounds like something Calm spirit should cover. Instead of Iron will.
---
Very strong. 
---
Anyone older than 34 haha

Feel like I'm the only one haha

Nani?!

Thanks, those skill checks will be added next week, I already started working on them.

And it’s well worth the read

Sounds like a fun-gi

Remember the bug where the nurse had to wipe her blade and then go through the stun animation after hitting a survivor after a blink?  
---
I got a 4K during that week. Unfortunately shadowplay failed me, but man it was glorious. I think it was coldwind farm too.
---
Thanks, I really appreciate :)
---
I thought it was the new thicc survivor...
---
New steam name, just need to explain to all my friends I don't have a weird fetish
---
Just played a match yesterday where only three survivors loaded in, don’t know where the fourth went. The other two disconnected as soon as they were hit. The Michael just followed me around, getting chase and stalking points while I did enough gens for the hatch to spawn. They were a good person.
---
Thanks, I really appreciate!
---
Because they wanted to test updated perks that they don't have on the new killer
---
PTB should just have everything unlocked. How are you gonna test shit if you can’t even unlock it?
---
NSFW bro or it might get deleted
---
I’d absolutely set it as my name, but I’ve got my crush on Steam and I’d rather he not assume I’m into Two Girls One Cup lmao
---
Some dude spawned on top of a rock in a hill and we just had a staring contest for 20 mins
---
First of all, play by your own rules. You’re the killer, your job is to kill. If you try and play by these arbitrary rules, you are **purposely** handicapping yourself. After 500 hours of playing killer, I can promise you no matter how nice you try and play, survivors will accuse you of doing something they didn’t like. You can’t please everyone, so play what works for you. If the survivors don’t like it, they can go play generator simulator or something.
---
That being said, you don’t want to be a douche in game. Don’t BM, don’t cry, just say GG and move on.
---
Also the sound man. I remember Truetalent played some games without headphones because there was no point in listening. Survivors made basically no footstep sounds, even when running.
---
Maybe something close to nurse speed and he would also be 110% in normal form
---
The I agree to most of your points. I was going to try to replace make your bones he’d with a new trait called Underhand deal. Which when hit changes 1/2/3 random perks with other perks. But I thought that would be counter productive.
---
&gt; If the survivor is close to you, then hit it normally. There's no reason not to, especially if they are already infected quite a bit.
---
If they're close to you, just hit them with all the vomit. It puts them into the injured state and the survivor does not get a speed boost and you do not get an attack cool down and then you can *easily* m1 them into dying state
---
*4 lockers open at once with 3 dweards head on inside *
---
Ds isn’t even toxic anymore why use it as an example
---
You didn't have to time pallet or flashlight saves at all. You could blind/stun at any point in the animation, then it would play the rest of the picking up animation and right after that the killer would drop the survivor. The Brand New Part add-on allowed the survivor to instantly complete a gen. Pallet hitboxes were huge. There were pallets everywhere, like 5 times more than the amount of pallets now. The maps had tons of infinites.
---
With what I’ve been seeing, if you use corrupted purge you can put people in the dying state. If you use vile purge, it just makes them sick, and if you wait long enough they become broken. 
---
yes, same on the Doctor
---
That’s cool man, if one or two viewers is a huge benefit for you, keep doing it.
---
Maybe they were intimidated by that rad sweater
---
WELP, LAG SWITCHER AND FACECAMPER, WHO WOULD'VE KNOWN, FUCK THIS GAME AND ENJOY YOUR REPORTS!
---
You're
---
I’m 34 myself. Don’t tell me we are the oldest??! Lol 
---
I spent a lot of time on this killer and i would appreciate any suggestions or improvements you would like to give.  I never intend my suggestions to actually be implemented in DBD but i like making these just in case the devs anonymously need some small and quick ideas.  Plus, these are quite fun to make as the bio is my favourite part and a split personality killer has always been my biggest interest.
---
You can give it a try now on mobile, just use the landscape mode and touch the background when a skill check appears, it is not ready yet for mobile but for now it does what it supposed to.
---
r/woosh
---
Well by definition of screaming you csnt do it quietly. Grunting and things like it can be controlled and are not associated with a set volume other than "louder than nothing." 
---
So I think the doctor screams would be the only known exception. If they were to make it cover a large amount of noises, of which I would agree with OP.
---
i wanted to try the new killer and then at the 5 second mark every surviver changed to P3 chars with 4 flashlights... 
---
He's like Nurse, except takes zero skill to use.  He can vault pallets and windows fast, so they're basically useless against him, just like Nurse.  When he hits you the first time you begin to bleed out and must mend, all other survivors who aren't affected by his bleed are revealed, and his sprint guage is refilled every time he hits someone who isn't affected by his bleed.
---
You basically just find someone, sprint to them, hit them, and keep sprinting behind them until they're down.  Its literally that easy.
---
Calling the DS change a buff is completely disingenuous.
---
The ranking system isnt worth arguing or complaing over. Rank doesnt matter as long as SWF, hillbilly and Mori's exist. 
---
New players should be segregated from the rest while they learn the ropes, toss the rest in together.
---
God, I just wanna bend over spread my ass cheeks and have her vomit stream up my ass. 
---
You'll need to m1 someone between your corrupted puke period. If you dont m1 people on purpose to keep the PWYF then you're giving up on a lot of pressure for free.
---
Yeah I'd replace a lot of the mediocre ones with stuff like that. It takes time to be fully infected, I'd love to see similar addons to those of the clown, but maybe hindered would be too much.
---
How right you are.
---
Doesnt his power have a cooldown though and wouldnt he get stunned still with the mixtapes? He have to hit surviours 3 times right? 
---
Yeah, it bothers me a lot seeing how some people behave on stream. Like I get a little trash talking, that's usually all in good fun, but people take it why too far sometimes.
---
And nurse
---
Yea I just played LF in red ranks. 2 people DC’d, 1 person just killed themselves and the other stuck it out. I wasn’t even playing meta perks or meme builds, they were just bad survivors. This was on swamp too.
---
Like, why even play? If you’re just gonna DC because you lost your edge, why not just go play a campaign game on easy mode so you don’t lose.
---
Hm, that could work.
---
Chris Hansen, 59. Why don't you have a seat?
---
You want the side with 4 people on it to be more OP than the side with one person on it?
---
the way you photoshopped her in is nightmare fuel
---
BHVR has been pretty good with patching killers before release, due to PTB feedback, especially Spirit and Clown. Legion though... oh boy.
---
i know not enough clown
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
Yeah I agree, another problem for me is that strategies that limit bloodpoint gain like camping will greatly affect if someone pips now. Unhooking people is practically necessary to pip now for the survivors, and camping and other strategies of that nature will not only makes the scores lower for everyone in the game, but most if not all of them will depip.
---
Honestly I have met 2 ttv streamers and they were pretty nice not toxic at all etc though I played doctor (my main) 
---
Go kill some survivors after you're done grinding that axe ;)
---
Well, swarms of rats and plague aren't things Bethesda could claim copyright ownership of. I mean, they could try, but I can't imagine that lawsuit going anywhere.
---
i dont think that she stores it in her mouth. if she did she would look like a frog, i think instead she mentally preps herself to throw it up directly from the gut.
---
So you haven’t gotten a proper answer yet. Rank 16-20 is a special bracket where new players are. There’s a very limited amount of players. Wait times can be like 20 minutes for a trial.
---
You just have to wait and pray to the entity you don’t get a bugged lobby. That’s the only way until you get to rank 15.
---
Where is Mathieu
---
Snooch.
---
What the fuck
---
Hhhhh that Claudette cosmetic is so pretty I can’t wait to only be able to afford one part of it *sobs*
---
Jane looks lovely too!!!
---
Damn, you must be one lucky son of a gun. Lol 
---
Sometimes you don't even need to use the Mori. My ultimate power move is to bring an Ebony and never kill anyone with it. Or go halfway through the animation and stop...show I have it, and yet don't use it. Even if I lose, I show that I had that power...and yet, did not use it.
---
I’d say 14-20
---
Not to mention the matchmaking issues this will cause.
---
So people like Monto and tru3 talent are mediocre?
---
Like I said. Hard pill to swallow. Don’t take it personally bro. For what it matters, I’m not anti-streamer or anything so good luck on your stream.
---
The hound mask was amazing 
---
Another one bites za dusto
---
good son real good maybe even the best
---
You realize it’s literally impossible to pip as a killer on the PTB once you’re ranks 1-4 right? The system is completely buttfucked right now.
---
Unforgivable, give it back or we riot
---
Lighting bug? If there’s no directional light, everything will be just black (that famous The Game bug that Noob3 had). If the lighting is too intense (I doubt it could happen during loading), crows might get absolutely white, but everything else should too.
---
On this picture you can see crows having lighting on them, they’ve got dark and bright spots. Texture bug would make them magenta. I am pretty sure it’s material being set to default instead of custom.
---
Remember Me: Everytime the obsession is healed you lose a token
---
Read the patch notes. Says it's permanent now.
---
Do you play a ranked mode in ANY OTHER GAME and think you’re gonna rank up based on how fun you make it for the other team? Ranking is based on how well you perform. If you’re getting slugged a bunch it’s because that was probably the correct thing to do to win the match. They shouldn’t punish killers who play optimally against survivors that don’t. They should DIRECTLY challenge the things that make camping and tunneling unfun, and any other strategies that might be unfun too.
---
*proceeds to vomit all over the tree*
---
I have not been having trouble with her, even though she’s new. She also has a short slow down when she finishes vomiting. The only place that is annoying to loop her is at short walls and she has her red vomit. That can be tough, but other than that, her power isn’t too dangerous unless you’re in the open and she can hit you with a full stream.
---
So...if say, LF was to facecamp one survivor then everyone will either depip or safety only? Even if you do the gens and escape?
---
Makes sense to depip the killer but survivors too?
---
Could.be better if you just treat it like a passive. Don't go out of your way to find the obsession, but if you do, puke and run 
---
I'm on console and it just says 4 kills. Nothing about a merciless. I wonder if they're actually processed differently. 
---
That is not newer players. The gym gimnatics mean DIFFERENT things in different regions. In Russia, Korea and Oceania wawing your hands means “save me” and staying still is “killer is camping”.
---
Hmmm.....thats actually pretty interesting
---
\*laughs in killer\*
---
Imagine finally downing that pesky teabagging survivor, picking him up, only to have someone run up, flashlight you mid animation, and you were to drop the survivor as soon as  the animation got done... no timing required... just blind during the animation and the Killer would drop the survivor... and I think that was also the time where it still required 5 vaults for a Window to get blocked off... not so fun times..
---
What sloppy butcher buff?
---
When they said "oldest Killer" they werent talking about the Person... the were talking about Bacteria!
---
That's why you go and cleanse
---
It was buffed a bit ago making it more useful
---
Sadly yes, because the emblem system is reliant on many factors, unhooking survivors is huge for the system. Usually you'd safety or pip if you did everything else aside from unhooking, but now I really don't see a work around. I'm convinced that this is what the new scoring is like in a predicament where a killer decides to camp.
---
oh ok let me just cleanse in the middle of this chase oh wait I got downed because I couldn't see anything
---
Oh ok gotcha. But without the addon hes pretty meh?
---
I doubt people will get banned for exploiting in test build.
---
If you are going to quote me, quote the whole sentence.
---
&gt;the next step is to find the perfect middle ground. How about you stop being so pessimistic and accept this.
---
I said the devs are working on it. Calling people moron and making shitty threads like this isn't useful feedback.
---
Can we get an F for trappy boi
---
How about getting blinded from behind lol
---
Please sir, may I have some more. 
---
It was because it took us a minute to get used to legion and start pushing shit...only then we realized how broken legion reallllllly is. I remember the first week everyone hough he was so weak.
---
The vomit is far more frequent and easy to use than ever so slowly building up your power while also needing a specific add-on.
---
I'm a legacy player with 1600 hours in the game, I understand how to do chases and I play both killer and survivor. Losing the entirety of your border is a big hindrance to survivors since you basically have to swing your camera around way to focus the direct center of your screen on the Plague or the area you're running to. So many chases rely on seeing the killer's red stain at the edge of your screen, and when you completely take away the edge of the screen, it really messes things up.
---
BLEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE
---
I KNOW WHAT YOUR FUKING TALKING ABOUT! THREE TIME IN ONE GAME MY HACHETS WENT THROUGH A SURVIVOR! HE WAS LOOPING A TREE SO I SWITCHED DIRECTIONS ON HIM AND DESERVED THAT HIT! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!
---
I KNOW ITS THURSDAY BUT STILL!!
---
Part of why he's getting them down so easily is the green add-on he's using.
---
But I agree. 
---
You can cheese the Vile Purge very easily. and get injured/broken without the survivor being able to do much about it
---
And survivors can run around the corner from Corrupt Purge, and you miss, but you can still get them because the duration of a single attack is long enough to get around the corner
---
&gt;machine gun build

*Laughs in Huntress w/ Tinkerer*
---
That shit was the main reason I mained her. So much fun.
---
THANK YOU
---
She is overall bigger than any other female survivor. She is fatter than them. Nothing wrong with it, she just is.
---
Def bug, this only happened after I downgraded from the test server
---
Ugh yeah. I have this problem on PC. On PS4 I'm like rank 6 killer, on PC, I'm rank 20 &amp; decided to reinstall for the PTB (I started as survivor on PC, then switched to playing mainly killer on PS4) - I get instant lobbies on PS4, and its impossible for me to get a lobby on PC, especially on the PTB.
---
I'm at the tail end of a millennial, I believe (born in 82), and I've sided with people who say that there are too many people with thin skin, and who whine about not getting their way.
---
On the flip side, I also know that there are an awful lot of people who specifically go out of their way to harass, exploit, and project faults on others. Honestly, for every "whiney snowflake" millennial, I've known 10 who are insanely hard working, don't complain, and receive far less than the generations before them.
---
I don't mean to go off on a tangent, but it really does feel, at this point, that the whining about millennials whining has become the loudest and most obnoxious whine.
---
There's like 6 pools. If you're puking on Survivors that much and *not* going to power up it's on you.
---
absolutely cursed
---
If it were a typo, why specifically mention devour hope in the patch notes? Nothing else was changed about it
---
Does this ubfuck the friends list?
---
It's consistent across every tier now.
---
I can't remember how the original worked, so tought it had something to do with removing one of the downgrades of tiee 1 to 3
---
Oh I see now. They are pure white like their models withought any color. Wow. Really shows what state this game is in?
---
This is the first time I’ve felt sick about her ability. Job well done.
---
And you said "if you're planning to buy a pc just to play dbd then don't" which is not what I said,I indeed didn't say a tiny one of them is for dbd which is what I meant and I apologize for that but you misinterpreted what I said too and made it look like the only reason I'm buying one is for playing dbd so no, I'm not trying to be a smart guy. 
---
Truthfully, I still find legion laughably easy to beat. If he wants to take the time to stick on someone down in the course of a chase, without Frank's Mix Tape, he's going to lose 2, maybe even 3 gens in that chase.
---
For one player, escaping a chase with Legion is probably going to be impossible over the course of a minute or two, and that is really shitty for that player. However, it almost always assures Legion is going to lose pretty badly.
---
Essentially, the mechanics to chase and down someone for Legion aren't really fun because they're kind of brainless, and almost assure he's going to lose the game overall. For the person being chased, it's not fun because unless the Legion really screws up, you're not going to get away.
---
The internet is a big place bruh
---
Its kind of weird that there's people complaining that the currently live ranking system is "too easy" and now they made it super hard but not in a good way.
---
It can be a fun thing to try, tho it costs you a perk slot so I don't think it will be strong.
---
Thank You!
---
Uh? Legion is actually very weak, he's annoying to play against but he is not strong unless you have frank's mixtape.
---
Same it's when I started the game and on top of that I tried maining nurse. She'd wipe her blade and then get stunned after every blink attack. I just thought nurse was bad and everyone was joking that she was good
---
what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
bamboozle all the way. excellent for juking. agitation is shit unless you're pairing it with mad grit or something
---
I understand now thank you
---
Did spirit ever even kill anyone? I’m blanking on her lore 
---
First, every jigsaw box has a 50% chance to remove the trap with the exception of last one as it will always remove it. This has been shown by statistics where a redditor checked over 2000 traps and their effectiveness in the game( you can search for the post if you want). This, while being better than ruin isn't enough to win against very good survivors, due to pig's lack of chase potential. 
---
Pig's crouch -&gt; grab only works if the survivor can't see you coming, which does happen, but you're lucky to grab a survivor twice a match as grabs are client sided, meaning you can let go of the gen on reaction. 
---
Pig's power is almost useless in chases, the only thing a survivor needs to do is to leave the loop if they see you crouch. Also this only works in very small loopsand if there is no vaults. Actually the only way it works is if you crouch and then immediately continue to chase normally to make them leave the loop but even this only works if they can't get to a vault or a loop.
---
Don't go by sight go by sound. Invest in some good gaming headphones and just focus on the heartbeat. Dont just run until you think shes away, run until the heartbeat drops down a bit then work on changing direction and sneaking to the fountain. If her main thing is the sickness, then they're gonna make it good. If it only fucked with like 20% of your screen you could still easily get away and the killer would be pointless. Don't focus on where shes at. Focus on areas you can escape through or at least break line of sight with
---
It's free real shards
---
Git-Gud
---
No. The spirit wanted to kill one specific person, and in death was promised the opportunity for that revenge in exchange for service to the entity. 
---
Obviously the only place the game could put you so you were out of line of sight of all totems, balanced!
---
Why the empathy nerf?
---
Agree, a time that starts when  there has been no activity for a certain amount of time would be ok
---
That is true... but it might be a little too situational
---
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN I VAULTED THE WINDOW AND WAS ON THE OTHWE SIDE AND I STILL GOT HIT IS THIS A NEW THING OR WTF BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAPPEND 
---
all the more reason to make people want to stick around
---
Ainda bem q é separado dos troféus do jogo
---
Yeah but who watches mixer?
---
It was a little feature for Solo survivors, for sweaty SWF groups, the entire team effectively always had eyes on the killer.  Sweaty SWF is why we can't have nice things.
---
*Notices player having fun* OwO what’s this
---
Getting super flu is no joke.
---
/r/punpatrol here hands up where I can see them! 
---
Anyone who likes snoop dog i guess lol
---
Bamboozle is great for some maps that have infinite window loops but rarely do I seem them and even then you have 16 seconds before the effect runs out. So far from my experience as killer its only consistently good with the shack as you can instantly remove the pallet but other than that I think its more fun to save and buy a killer you want to play.
---
Shards are not hard to earn. You could buy the perk then just save up to buy a killer. Killers a permanent whereas the perk is temporary. 
---
I need some context to what the hell is happening here.
---
Oh, mocking it has brought some funny memes. I just meant the original intent seems like a fishing for pity points and a victim complex.
---
I have about 300 hours and did 80% off the achievements 
---
Is this what tier 4 Iron Will looks like?
---
I can't decipher this. 
---
"that was good, he went upstairs again"
---
Yeah, if the original was genuinely made with no irony, it sends across a real douchey message. It's like when people saw that Zootopia comic centered around being pro-life and made a shitload of memes out of that. 
---
Can she puke on demand? The fuck
---
So that hopefully you do something that catches the attention of The Entity, and you get transported to a paradise where a sexy giant woman pukes in your mouth all day every day. When that gets boring, then you have a big strong silent man lift you up and lovingly inserts kitchenware in your body.
---
Nah. This sub is extremely circlejerky when it comes to content creators. Once you're deemed as BAD everything you do is BAD. I personally find tyde's tierlists hilariously bad and am not really a fan of ardetha, but i can enjoy their content regardless
---
When you enter PTB the game makes a copy of you save file and uses it independently. So, any bloodpoints spends you will do in PTB will be reverted when you return to live build. You won't lose anything (except the time spent on playing PTB)
---
Was a joke buddy lol
---
Ah-haaaah. Understood sir/madam.   
---
I didn't know other regions/countries had their own interpretation of Hook Gymnastics.  
---
This would also contribute to the confusion.  
---
I'm a relatively newer player, but I have been watching people play the game since Beta.   
---
Since the Beta, the consensus has been:-  
---
Waving on the hook means: KILLER IS CAMPING, STAY AWAY (unless you're running BT)
---
Staying motionless on the hook means: It's safe to unhook  
---
But at this point its semantics, folks are gonna do what ever they wanna do.  
---
Stay safe in The Fog.
---
Now to add vomit meg to it. 
---
So if I were to put like 300k blood points onto Jane, I wouldn't actually lose those outside of the ptb?
---
Agreed mostly. I think it's a little annoying she can just hold her power and wait until almost point blank range to get easy broken but that's mostly fine.
---
I didn't feel like mentioning it since 128 meters is a very long range, it will be very unlikely to not be able to see an injured survivor at this range and I think they nerfed it because it overshadowed other survivor aura reading perks. Overall, I see it as a good change because now, tier 1 and 2 aren't useless 
---
Killer.
---
Nope. You wouldn't! But you'd have to spend those BP again because it doesn't carry over.
---
Shadow we both enjoyed 1.3 wutface. I see you’ve joined their ranks though ;(
---
I’m 22 so i would guess between 17 to 30 ?
---
Next level Claudette hiding strats. 
---
Pretty much same story for me. I think Tyde’s tier lists are ridiculous, but putting words in his mouth is something I won’t just sit by and let happen. Ardetha has said multiple times on stream that he loves the new killer. 
---
I watched Ardetha depip on a 4k because he used a mori
---
I grew bored with Nurse, and was finding myself having a lot of fun with Spirit.
---
I will say that one thing that drives me crazy as Spirit is that her power recharge can really screw you over if the survivor gets lucky with a guess on where you'll go, or you mess up what you're trying to do. It's like... really punishing.
---
Been asking this same question for a while now.   
---

---
Bottom right is killer ping I think, player pings are next to their usernames.
---
This is what a PTB is for,
---
I commend you, you pretty much have been playing in 1.0
---
Bamboozle is nice but a killer is better.
---
(buy the clown, level him up and get bamboozle. 2000+ iq) 
---
I dont get it cause im new to this but soon i will
---
Ranking up was somewhat too easy, not always as said already for Killers, but most people didn't say that from what I read. They said ranking up was worthless, meaningless, or just not rewarding.
---
That's simply wrong in my opinion. Ranking up and keeping in higher ranks every month always had a meaning to it. It shown you put effort into playing the game and with that effort it should be a tell that you are also a skilled player. Rank also resets every month, so it shouldn't be THAT hard to do with looking at how much time it takes to rank up.
---
Takes 85 pips to reach rank 1 from 20. That's 85 games at 5-10 minutes each, or  7-14 HOURS of pure gameplay. Not counting lobby times, blood wed leveling, playing dress up with cosmetics, load times, or anything but pure gameplay. Needless to say that ranking up for the average player can take quite the chunk of time at maybe 1-2 hours a day. This also isn't counting for depip, black pip, or double pips. Often adding even more games from how often you can earn black pips more than double pips.
---
Post reset. Id say it takes around 50-60 pips to get back to rank 1. Even that is at least 4-8 hours at 5-10 minutes a game not counting anything else. Not as bad as before but still take a good bit of time most people just don't have within a single month. So ranking up shouldn't be that hard.
---
But this system in the PTB is just fucked! Compared to the current system you have to double pip, to just get a pip at high ranks in the PTB. That's not super hard. That's a slap in the face and not sustainable for anyone.
---
🤮👍
---
As long as I'm not losing anything then that's fine by me. Thanks!
---
Big daddy stabby boi because he is a spoopy overlord of jumpscares and “oh shit!” Moments. He’s just fun and has many fun add ons to mess with
---
The wolf in little piggy clothing Amanda. Like Myers, she can jump scare and is just fun
---
Bing bong boi- reasons up above as well
---
The Japanese schoolgirl spirit- she’s just awesome, freaky as hell and I love trying to get better with her ability 
---
And last but not least, I know she isn’t out yet,  but plague will definitely be a character I play. I just know lol, so awesome 
---
That's great to know, thanks! I guess that means I wont earn any blood points either, but that's okay 
---
Then I guess you won't ever play again because they've said they won't be increasing gen times.
---
The current version of the game is the best its ever been for killers so if you feel like its a "huge joke" then maybe you're just not very good?
---
Don't insult my boy Bubba like that, he tries his best damnit!
---
This isn’t even funny it’s just gross 
---
also the ptb is a earlier saved profile of you characters i know this because on the normal servers i have ace level 40 but on the ptb he was 32 so if you have accumulated all those points very very recently you wont be able to use them
---
Hitting great skill checks aren’t hard to hit. If they killer has ruin I just go through it.
---
Run a bunch of gen slowing perks, hell even the new killer has one
---
Run the new one
---
Ruin
---
T-phobia
---
Maybe dying light? And tunnel the obsession , idk lol
---
The Plague is weak because of the instant heal survivors gain at the pools. It doesn't slow the game down and it doesn't incentivize you to use the vomit if they just heal extremely quickly. There's no point in becoming broken if you have to leave the survivor you're chasing. Imagine if I were to shock someone to tier 3 madness and hit them and then leave to attack someone else. They snap out of it but then they get instantly healed when they do it and go right back to the gens.
---
Having access to the corrupt purge isn't enough because the survivors aren't slowed down unless you hook someone.
---
The pools should cleanse the sickness and the broken status but should not heal the survivor.
---
possibly, but I think thats a good thing, given that the Survivor adepts are insanely more easy than killing 4 People :D
---
Killer, bamboozle is a decent perk but you'll get better results with enduring+spirits fury.
---
Seems more efficient to get the killers - then you have more content and access to 3 new perks if you want them.
---
Exactly \^.
---
They don't care about points, kills, pips... They just wanna see the world burn.
---
Note to self: mocking baseless critism from morons on the internet is "thin-skinned." Good looking out, random man!
---
I got into DBD cus I heard some people in a party playing and it sounded like fun. I used to play F13. It was a fun game buy got VERY stale almost off the bat. There wasnt much in the map department. Counselors were annoying. The hide/run system was buggy. And from what I understood, the developers didnt expect the amount of players fo from release on through another 4 months public matches were TERRIBLE.  The only way you could get a match was finding people on looking for group posts. Also, you weren't guaranteed to play Jason. So you could play a whole day and chances are you only play Jason 1 or 2 times. 
---
The only thing I loved in that that I wish was in DBD was the talk system. In F13 you could only talk to people nearby or go find a radio. DBD I see too many people OBVIOUSLY in a party and trying to use some guy to distract me while their buddies did gens. Even when I play survivor i feel like it'd be cool if you could find a radio to talk rather than just 4 dudes constantly trying to give updates on my location in a party.
---
Gladly 
---
no they should because the killer can pick up the corrupted water and become huntress 2.0 for 30 sec.
---
No question. Definitley don't think it's a bad thing. Of course that would happen after I finished them already. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20JgdGvx-9I&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20JgdGvx-9I&amp;feature=youtu.be) from a monto highlight vid, the feng face is at :38 secs in
---
traduced in: next time place a smol billy somewhere in the video
---
Wtf
---
i think just making her 110% movement speed is enough. yeah tweak and improve hitboxes and such but i think the 110% makes sense with killers that have ranged attacks
---
You are a God among men. 
---
Sounds like projection mixed in with some good old victim mentality
---
[Americans be like](https://i.imgur.com/JFz4waG.gif)

Nightmare fuel
---
Well even if your not seen, Legion can find you from hitting someone in frenzy
---
*Dwight would like to know your location*
---
You know nobody means the chest xD
---
By that logic killers shouldn't be able to break pallets nor go through windows. Any killer can be "ốp". 
---
Just. Let. Go. After. A. Failed. Ruin. Skillcheck.
---
It's not that hard.
---
Pig because she is smol and makes a cute squek when hit by pallets
---
Karen is sick of her husband and her husband is sick of her.
---
Thank you! :)
---
No but both increase FoV
---
She's so average it's... sickening. 
---
I know, I’ve played a few matches as him.
---
I just have to pay attention to my team as well, for example, when someone is attacked, I make sure to keep moving and out of range.
---
Does it always work? No, but that’s just the name of the game. Things aren’t always set in stone, game plans always go to shit lol
---
That’s just the fun for me... I think sometimes everyone focuses too much on finishing the trial and forgets to just sit back and enjoy the thrill/scary ride.  Win some or lose some, even if a killer catches me and face camps me, I still have some sort of fun... trying to alert the team while they pop gens and struggle as long as I can, the first chase is also a thrill
---
But legion in general, he’s the opposite of the other killers, in that he can chase you like a survivor lol, so rules get bent and it makes for a wild encounter
---
I try to just look at the positives and have fun with it, so far so good
---
found the guy who can't hit great skill checks
---
You got your Friday the 13th in my Dead by Daylight
---
Was literally painful to watch his early games.  "I don't understand her power yet!" *proceeds to use m2 once per match*
---
Lol @ DS being a dead meme
---
Personally I save my shards for cosmetics because I usually just end up buying the DLCs.  There are some cool looking cosmetics that you can buy with shards for a limited time available right now, each piece is pretty expensive but 8k should be enough to get one item. I got David's hot pants and I'm happy with the purchase :)
---
I really do like that squeak as well. By far the cutest thing in the game
---
Virtual machine.
---
Yeah, but Nurse has a learning curve, and there's a huge difference between a good and bad Nurse.
---
Legion is pretty brain dead, you just sprint and stab.  There's no timing or anything like there is with Nurse.
---
Yes so basically if someone gets unhooked right in front of you and you vomit on them you now kinda have to go after them because they’ll just insta heal. In that specific situation you’re kinda punished for using your ability 
---
if the mori's had actual gore, even the removal of body parts it would make every mori infinitely better
---
They aren't going to increase gen time but you can use gen perks even tho ruin is a super stupid thing they added into the game since its  almost rng if you get rid of it
---
Uhhh what the fuck 
---
"Ach, goddammit! Son of a bitch!" 
---
Plz where can I get that Claudette face 
---
Well, if a survivor uses it to heal then you see with which pool he interacted with and can use it to get the buffed plague.
---
Thank you! 💕
---
Idk i find feng cuter but not in a attraction way 
---
Ruin, overcharge, tinkerer. Theres perks out there that help slow down the gen speed. Also, as killer you can influence the gen time and what gens they can get to. Played a game that was about 45+ min long with me at the end defending 3 generators next to eachother and just scaring off survivors by shocking them and hitting them with the punishment stick. The generators only go too fast when it's a group of 4 in a party and 3-4 run over to the same gen in the beginning and get it
---
Nurse also takes some skill
---
Pig, because she is the only female killer who speaks English, showers regularly, and isn’t an animated rotting corpse.
---
(In all seriousness, I’m not attracted to any of them sexually/romantically.  She’s just the most attractive purely by default)
---
Just played a match against a Spirit with those fucking beads. I know understand the pain
---
same here, but a bit different. I am somehow a rank 3 Killer, I mean I play killer often but not as much as survivor, and i'm a level 40 leatherface and level 30 legion and also level 20 trapper (those are my mains) but I often suck at playing killer, I often mess up in games and end up getting maybe 1 kill or 2, usually at least 2-3 survivors escape from me, and I'm usually either getting brutal killer or entity displeased, or sometimes a ruthless killer
---
I would like to believe a killer shouldn't be punished for using an ability. Still leaves me with a lot of concern. Especially when killers get punished for tunneling. Which I think this will lead to.
---
It is a good counter for newer players but trust me once u get used to it its not hard to hit the great.
---
And that's all it is, just a heated moment of anger, usually misdirected, but I'm not on the post game chat screaming "KILL YOURSELF TRASH!"  
---
..Or like Gearbuster, deliberately playing in a manner that causes the game to be unfun and ruined for others.  
---
What perks do you think are “OP”? 
---
uhhh isn't killer tiering just subjective opinion making?
---
It was a joke damn relax 
---
Hope so. Probably my only gripe I have at the moment.
---
Survivor mains already called for nerfs on day 2
---
ResidentSleeper 
---
When the achievement was added Nurse has 3 blinks in her base kit, so it was obviously designed around that
---
Very mature of you you indignant little dumpster fire 
---
As far as I can tell, the ptb is already randomly deleting half the survivor sounds already (including fast vaults, whimpers, vomiting), without even needing a perk! 
---
  
---
Jokes aside, I'd say take Iron Will off the table, as eliminating pain sounds is already very strong, and letting it block sounds from secondary effects is too much. Imo.  
---
It fits well with Calm Spirit, which already effects madness and intoxication, so why not sickness as well?  It needs to stay up to date with killers if it's going to be at all viable.  It's already pretty risky, as it doesn't do much vs most killers.  Hell, I'd even say it'd be OK if it did or had a chance to not show your splotch to legion in frenzy as well. 
---
I never said he was op, All I'm saying is that when facing a Legion, Winning chases isn't really an option
---
It makes a part of it harder for him to use, but it still shows you a visual, so it's not foolproof (unless they changed that and I missed it). 
---
its ok, atleast its gonna be hard and a challenge
---
You have to be pretty bad to lose a survivor like that tho
---
Not to fanboi but if you want a streamer that actually gives a rational opinion with legitimate facts and counter-points of why and how the killer's power can be applied, watch ZubatLEL. 
---
No one else I watched was quick to pick up the logical applications for Plague. He was a little biased until he played as survivor against her as well but he quickly corrected it once he did. 
---
She's a solid killer. 100%. Great addition to the game. Probably just a tweak or two to be done but she's gonna be fine. 
---
He’s our special little boy
---
With her green add-on that moderately increases the effectiveness of Vile Purge, if she finds you anywhere where there isn't a wall, you're going down fast and there's nothing you can do about it. That's a problem. And if there is a wall and she has Corrupt Purge, you're fucked because the attack can miss but the duration is long enough to get around corners and still hit if the survivor jukes it initially
---
For every other attack in the game that puts the survivor into injured state, the survivor gets a speed boost to escape the killer. That's not so with Vile Purge. 
---
An unlike the chainsaws and T3 Michael, you really can't juke it and 360 out of the attacks because you just cheese it and swipe from side to side
---
Philip... Tall, dark, and handsome... also he seems sweet
---
Not drop every pallet that you see every time you see it instantly find fucking window loops you can fucking live without being able to loop a killer for like 1 minute straight every so often 
---
20% chance to hit a great? Lol yea come back when you actually learn how to hit skill checks. Also yea, do the totem is a good counter argument because if how easy that is to do.
---
I think that went on calm just to give it some extra element that works on ALL killers, instead of just doc &amp; clown.  It makes more sense on iron will, true.  Not sure that it means much anyway, though... The killer knows when they hit you, so the scream is kinda immaterial. 
---
Even louder than the trapper’s trap sound being snapped 
---
Exactly! Not saying it's a bad or "stupid" idea, I just don't see a way currently that Ghostface could be different enough from those two. 
---
“The heal for deep wound is short” - and easily applied to multiple people. Also requires an extra heal to return to full health. 
---
“No map control” - runs at a good pace during frenzy and causes survivors to have to mend or else they are downed. 
---
“Only discordance as an aura perk” - there are such things as ‘teachable perks’, not only that but discordance is great for early game pressure and multiple hits per frenzy. 
---
“While not as skill intensive as Sally” - understatement of 2019 so far. 
---
“NKOtB are not brain dead” - keep telling yourself that. 
---
“... with 3 weeks of experience” - and that sums up the post! 
---
Flashlight ready in hand. Uhuh...I see through your lies 😏
---
“Nice of The plague to invite us over to Russia, eh Luigi?”
---
“I hope she made lotsa **VOIMT!**”

I'm all for shitting on anti-vaxxers but goddamn this is the 100th post about it.
---
HAHAHAHAHHAHA HOLY SHIT did you just use the fact that your rank 1 as an argument XD absolutely pathetic 
---
I think it would be a buff for the pig if she would also get an easy to hit damaging projectile in exchange for the heal.
---
She ends chases *absurdly quickly* even with the pools giving heals. And if you run the add-on that moderately increases the effectiveness of Vile Purge you get them into the injured state in one Vile Purge attack and m1 them into dying state not even a half second later. She's a very, very strong killer
---
she needs some kind of small nerf for being able to injure survivors with her bile so fast (it doesnt take much)
---
Maybe if you find out they have it maybe I don’t know DONT STUN THEM WITH THE PALLET holy shit XD
---
Which one is that? I don't know the names of kills I don't play.... Sorry.
---
The devil is behind him
---
All with head on! Imagine the killer grabbing a survivor out of the locker and another survivor stuns the killer with it. 
---
"doesn't do anything except break them" so essentially gives them the exposed status while also making a ton of noise? 
---
That's the way it is for all M1 killers. Problem is, he sucks without addons more than the rest because you need to hit them 4 times. that's double the normal M1 killer hits. During frenzy, regardless of whether you hit them or not, you still endure the stun when your time runs out. Base it doesn't recharge fast enough to chase for any lengthy period of time, so you need to be ontop of them like the any normal killer would. The doctor may eat more  pallets(legion can eat pallets too), but he doesn't get stunned on a timer. Even then, he only has to take the basic hit stun twice rather than 3 times(not including the first hit with frenzy because no cooldown on that). legion cant see scratch marks during the frenzy, so losing him is easy on maps like Lerys. Last but not least, not a single exposed status effect nor nurses calling works well with his power, so he essentially is just a M1 killer at that point. The best his ability can do is make people waste time mending and/or healing.
---
I really don't understand &amp; care the all buzz about this ranks system. I'm a regular dbd player with both side experiences, throughout the time I play I faced a lot of players (killers/survivors) giving a too much of a big damn about ranks system. I mean it gets you nothing! literraly NOTHING!
---
Yet you guys still argue about it's being too hard to pip. Why do you want to pip so much? to deal with the tryharding slugging nurses or urbanly evading survivors?? At the end of the seasons you derank to 5-6 ranks below only to get nothing. I DO believe pipping should not be that easy either. Everyone especially survivors can reach rank1 only by playing 3-4 hrs per day for 1 week. People need to earn their ranks by playing good not by plating a lot...
---
 I believe that thoose harshness on thoose games makes you a better player. For example all the players used to run exhaustion perks, after the nerf of the perks almost half of the players let them go so did streamers. And you know what? they adapted! (so did I) 
---
Long story short, it's never bad to try new things instead of non working usseles systems. We all just need to gid gud unfortunately.
---
I think it's cool, but the dialogue just sounds like simlish... 
---
I actually would mind if the studio made a Battle Royale game, there is still untapped potential for the genre. The reason it sucks so bad is because many of the games are copycats or uninspired. I'd love a licensed game based on the novel "Battle Royale" for example or a horror game that pic everyday people against each other in a Manhunt kind of fashion. I'm curious to see where this goes. 
---
Killers don't necessarily need to be actual murderers.  Spirit didn't kill anyone before she was taken, either. In fact, both Spirit and Plague made a deal with a higher power, in this case the entity. 
---
Oh boy so let’s add a fixing stun to the killer and make her slow and absolutely execute her yeah that sound ducking fun 
---
If they're going to keep the new scoring system (hopefully they don't) they absolutely need to remove rank reset. The grind to reach rank 1 now will be absolutely ridiculous and to drop back to rank 10 every month would be horrendous. 
---
I personally didn't have an issue with the current emblem scoring system. Yes people who didn't belong in rank 1 managed to get there, particularly survivors, but this meant that not every game at rank 1 was a horrendous sweat-fest. Weaker killers are actually viable and survivors don't need to play optimally. Hell, killers could even play nice and let everyone live and would still black pip or even maybe get 1 pip. The new system will just lead to ultra sweat. Rank 1 will only be meta Nurse/Billy/Spirit and the occasional iridescent Huntress against 4-man SWFs with insta heals and green toolboxes. The amount of RNG in this game prevents it from being properly competitive, so why bother trying? Just make it fun.
---
I agree, it should definitely be a perk for the killer ;)
---
Take off that Wraith flair, it's obvious you don't play killer enough to see how fast gens get done. 
---
She's middle of the road but the insta heal fountains and corrupt purge need a bit of work
---
He is bing bong boi
---
That was also a thing back then.
---
Low key the guy should post it here so we can use it for our desktops
---
Her ability is not weak at all. Vile Purge can get a survivor into injured state by default with just two direct Vile Purge attacks, and with the green add-on that increases its effectiveness it only takes one, and because the survivor doesn't get a speed bonus from going into the injured state like they usually do, the killer can m1 them down literally immediately.
---
And if they go and heal then she has access to an attack that can reach around corners.
---
She's one of the strongest killers in the game
---
With a bloody clothes
---
It can happen. Again I'm only three weeks in so I'm not super great.

This is a post a month ago with 500 traps. You can clearly see the pattern here. 500 traps would be enough to see if there really was 25% chance.
---
&gt;If you're good with mindgames she is good
---
Well whooptidoo, any killer is good on basic tiles if they know how to. Pig is no exception, but has no additional mindgame potential to that of a trapper
---
When the interaction time is roughly five seconds with a pool of devotion I'd argue otherwise. Killers need to slow down gen progression as much as possible. This in particular doesn't help The Plague and the pools should just cleanse infection imo.
---
Reminds me of that one scene in Tenacious D where he screams that guys face off.
---
I can just picture the plague going .. "Sorry!" And the survivor just gurgles lol
---

---
Most underrated comment on this thread. 
---
I've played since beta, and I remember when you couldn't even damage generators!
---
Well yeah that's what I think because the stun comes from the scream. I mean sure he can still get you with the moving skillchecks and put you in tier III so you can't use your items but yeah I'd say a good part of his power is to make you scream
---
Yep I'm hoping they remove that. It's a pretty ridiculous mechanic. 
---
IM SO UPSET ABOUT THIS 
---
There is also those few players who are running nurse with meta perks and a mori with omega blink just there to ruin the fun. 
---
She is super strong though when she absorbs the corruption or w/e it is afterward. She's like the huntress on steroids and she can still M1 you down if need be. I think it's fine tbh
---
My first game was against a insidious basement camping leatherface lol
---
All praise Jane, the thiccest of the thicc. 
---
Generators are boring to do for survivors, and if survivor gets too boring there won't be anyone for you to kill.  The devs are moving in a direction that shows they want to slow the game down without just adding more progress bar, which is much better than just slowing down gen speeds.
---
Just take it twice as he said in a comment 
---
Try using sentences. It'll make communicating like a human much more easy.
---
&gt; her vile isn’t that hard to dodge it’s a hell of a lot easier to dodge the tier 3 Myers
---
From what I've seen, not at all. 
---
&gt; wow she can injure you without giving you a speed boost oh boy that’s so bad
---
...It is. Like, there's a reason that survivors get a speed boost when they're hit by an attack. Did you not know that?
---
&gt; well to do taht you have to hit them with a perfect vile hit or hit them multiple times giving them plenty of time to get away and do something about it 
---
Getting a perfect hit is so fucking easy. You only have to be a few meters behind them and without the add-on it only takes two Vile Purge attacks.
---
&gt; every survivor gets an insta heal against her
---
This only matters for survivors who get unhooked and are still infected. Otherwise you go down in a chase and the existence of healing fountains doesn't matter. Because you're down. And the healing fountains then gives the killer access to an attack that can *hit around corners*. Survivors who are injured but not infected cannot use them, either
---
You can be offended and sarcastic all you want. You're just not arguing against my points, and that's the end of it.
---
I managed to get a lucky Hillbilly chainsaw by immediately flying to the furthest gen from where I spawned. Ran right into a TTV Feng Min, and she DC's, followed by her 2 friends.
---
Spent the next 5 minutes watching the last guy do two gens so he could hatch escape.
---
I don’t mind if They do but I do mind if they don’t even use any new perks...
---
Infection is ridiculously easy to apply though and it is also pretty easy to apply the broken status effect.
---
I feel the killer is in a decent spot right now and I like that survivors have a choice to use the fountain as a heal but as a tradeoff he reveals his location and the killer gets empowered. 
---
I agree because its stupid for a perk to be that powerful and for people to argue "Its destroyable" whenever it spawns into a random place on the map. Its rng to find it and its absolutely stupid for it either to be destroyed early on or for it to take super long to find the stupid thing. 
---
And its not easy to hit the great skill checks for everyone because that often depends on lag/ping and its small compared to the good skill check window.
---
Practice.  Let yourself get found.  Watch survivor mains play.  One mistake I often see during loops is folks going ring around the Rosie, near another loop, getting hit, and then dropping their current pallet instead of heading to second loop and savi g the firdt pallet.  Also see people completely waste their free speed boost, either running into a corner, or immediately jumping a vault, etc.  If you drop a pallet and it's not a killer who can hit around it, FORCE them to break it.  Last, with spirit fury, don't be greedy for stuns.  You're better off dropping it a tiny bit early than looking for the stun.  Also, practice losing them.  Keep trying to slip out of sight and hide "in plain sight", in other words, figure out how to exploit a killer's shitty field of view.  That is how you eventually lose em.  Play killer a bit and get a good sense of how the world looks from their eyes.  You'd be surprised at how little vision killers have. 
---
Everyone who isn't affected by his wound is revealed when he hits someone while sprinting, so he has very good tracking, and his sprint is fully recharged when he hits someone new.  You can put any perks on him you like (don't have to use discordance), and with perks like thanataphobia, hex: ruin, and sloppy butcher he's a proper pain in the ass.  With his vision he has great map control, the strat with him is literally to control the map by hitting a survivor, then running to another and hitting them, and so on.  Then once all survivors near you are delayed you stick to one and hook them.  He's like Freddy, delay the game as long as possible and wear down the survivors slowly.
---
His main weakness is that it takes a while to kill a target, so once exit gates are open he's weak, but his chase is the best in the game along with Nurse (except his chase requires zero skill to use unlike Nurse who requires timing), as he ignores every tool the survivors have with his ability.  Also, NOED makes this a moot point, and will delay survivors even longer if they cleanse all 5 totems.
---
You can still hear wounded survivors while they're healing, and they're forced to mend or go down, so they can only wander away so far.  
---
His counter play almost requires SWF if the killer is actually good, because its all about staying far apart and rushing gens.  This is difficult to do when you can't communicate where he is, or who's going for a pull, ect.  Meaning lots of time wasted with the lack of coordination.
---
What makes him brain dead is the fact that his chase is so strong and easy to execute.  
---
What is the item? 
---
Do you mean this achievement "Shock Therapy" \*Repair the generator on the second floor of the Disturbed Ward and live to tell the story.\*

&gt;There is a new killer I want to see on the ptb so I download the ptb, then for some reason there are people playing other killers. I mean just play thr plague please, I don’t care about your stupid old killers I am litterally here to test out the NEW stuff on the ptb.
---
&gt;Just this.
---
Every PTB is the same story "*wHy ArEnT yOu PlAyInG tHe NeW kIlLeR*". It is called public test **build**, not public test **new content**. 
---
Currently I am playing as Billy and Nurse to see how the new DS will affect a normal gameplay and if any of the new perks suits them. While I am at it, checking how the new emblem scorings are responding to a 4 minute nurse game.
---
It wouldn't surprise me to see people playing Legion to check the new Thanatophobia.
---
I also wanted to see how Nurse was dealing with multi level blinking in the new map. 
---
I played the new killer for a few matches, now I want to see how the whole build will affect other killers and mechanics. 
---
There's a whole generation before this one that grew up playing video games from their inception... Many of whom still play.  You're probably not wrong that there's more in the current generation, but they're also spread out into mobile only gamers who didn't exist for the previous generation.

Sophomore year at Loyola, Bill and Nancy go out for tacos. Little does he know, Paco’s Tacos had kept on using Romaine.  Five hours later, Bill’s having ‘Nam flashbacks in his bed.

He thought he had pushed in out of his mind and that his nightmare’s were just that, nightmares. Until now..

finally i can see again
---
I need it.
---
Agreed. Imo if they make the ranking system a percentile system, that be fun. Then it won't be impossible to get to rank 1, but being rank 1 means u r top 1%. 
---
Previously anyone could get to red ranks by just playing kinda dumb  
---
The corrupted vile only injures them but if the insta heal wasn’t a thing then she’ll have a chance to down them if she’s near the fountain they used. Now the broken part is when the survivor hits maximum sickness they become broken and I believe it lasts until cured
---
As a hag main, I love running into players like you. Livers with a high salt content taste the best. My opinion is formed from my own experience teaching rank 1 on both survivor and killer multiple times over multiple seasons. You want the serious answer on how to deal with spirit fury? Practice looping. Stop sitting beside a pallet and waiting for the killer to come up so you can drop it on them. They have to break 2 pallets minimum before they auto break one, so learn to loop effectively and waste their time and drop the pallet without stunning them. This is such a basic and obvious counter that no one here can even take you seriously. You aren't tanking downvotes because "lol killer mains". You're tanking downvotes because you're being a fucking man child with a victim complex. As many people have already said, "git gud skrub"
---
A proper working atmosphere
---
Beautiful.
---
I had a rare chance to do this last night and took the opportunity. I was playing hag to get a quest done and ended up doing well from the start. One of the 4 survivors dc’d out of nowhere and things started to snowball quickly. When it was down to 1v1 I figured the survivor would find the hatch but caught them at a gate and hit them with noed (sorry!). Without hesitation I picked them up and dropped them at the exit. Feelsgoodman.
---
Basically they just created a copy of your save file. That’s it. Do what you want with the spare save file cause nothing will happen to the original

I like the mask. It just shows who wasted 40 bucks though. Like ill get people who comment on it saying i wasted my money since the game was DOA.

"generators are boring to do for survivors" lol, then dont play the game, easy fix.
---
Love me some Hag. Even if I'm not in range to teleport I really enjoy when someone runs over my traps nowhere near a genny. Cracks me up every time.
---
Again, on power loops she can completely shut them down. Even if the survivor runs away from the loop, the ambush attack can still often reach them. No other killer can do this.
---
500 traps is not nearly enough to see the %. When dealing with probability you require a VERY high sample rate. As someone who mains Pig, having used thousands of traps, I am telling you there is 0 chance in hell it is 50%. In fact just briefly looking at that page and the numbers listed that doesn’t even seem to be how math works lol.
---
I explained what makes her strong, you throw false information at me. I pointed you to PsychoScorpionz (who is a fog whisperer btw), go see what he does and how easily he sweeps the floor with Pig (and he’s not even a tryhard). Personally I disagree with how quickly he uses traps but he still does very well and no other streamer I’ve seen comes close.
---
“Guarenteed SWF”
---
“Toxicity and vitriolic playstyle”
---
“[this is the] successful criteria....”
---
yeah sounds like bull shit boogeyman non sense. Actual popular survivor streamers like Puppers/Noob3 don’t fit that stereotype at all, its just some myth because people would rather try and play victim than just admit they’re the assholes. Like just admit you have an irrational hatred for twitch streamers instead of using mental gymnastics to convince yourself that you’re not in the wrong.
---
Its even worse when you realize that most of the popular streamers and youtubers for this game mainly play killer. Tru3Talent, Marth, Zubat, Scott, Ralph,Umbra, etc etc. There are like a handful of survivor streamers and most of them dont do what you’re describing. So this idea that “twitch streamers for dbd are muh toxic!!” makes no sense and is some random thing reddit killers make up to justify them playing like assholes to some random person they see in their lobby with a certain word in their username.
---
The Plague of Athens, broke out in 430 bc and lasted 4-5 years.  It WAS a pustular rash disease, but they've never been able to determine an exact culprit. Smallpox, Plague, typhus, and arthropod borne diseases have been speculated, although typhus has been knocked down in likelihood as it was already very prevalent in Greece at the time (meaning it'd be much harder to see an epidemic of it). 
---
Apparently spacing on the phone died so sorry about that xD
---
Zubat is super toxic though. Not exactly an ideal teacher.
---
Hey guys. I feel like our latest killer is one of the most interesting from both story and mechanics. I'm curious what backstory BHVR will give to her, in the meantime I felt like I had to give it a shot and try it myself.
---
I hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to criticize it whichever way you please.
---
Regardless of the mask or not, I’d still buy the game. The concept interests me and I have hope for it. As soon as it’s available for console I’m buying it.

No. 
---
Allowing Calm Spirit to severely handicap the killer powers of two seperate killers to the point it handicaps a part of their play is overpowered. Calm Spirit would become heavily meta because if you're up against a Doc or Plague, you're at a significant advantage - not to mention the other situations in which it can be advantageous. 
---
Sorry. 
---
Myers because dynamic audio is the future of videogames &gt;:v
---
You're already better off staying sick and just doing gens. 
---
Yeah you can pick them up, the Broken status effect merely states that you can no longer heal or be healed to full. Practically speaking and game-wise, would be too OP if it didn't since she can puke on Dying State survivors and the status effect is permanent, that is, until you disinfect from a fountain.
---
Campy piggy.
---
Well then it comes down to how fast you can cleanse the sickness and from what I've seen was about 5 seconds. Which I think is way to fast. I'd be comfortable if it where closer to self care times. 
---
So you puke your opinion on others. Thats gross.

The playing field in this game is the wild fucking west. Until theres some rigidity in the balance, the ranking system is meaningless.

Get the killers on a reasonably level playing field, get rid of the obviously OP and unfun add-ons and mori's, address SWF and the bullshit advantages it provides.

While crouching, the pig is still audibly noticable if you listen closely

If its only active for 60 seconds, along with the steep and niche pre-requisite and the fact that it is still a one-time thing the stun time should be atleast 4-5 seconds IMO
---

I love the fact that they’re a so many people debating, but no upvotes, either people are equally split on this or no one cares.

Wait how did they nerf camping?
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with generic addons. Legion and Spirit also have a bunch of "increase a thing"/"decrease a thing" addons. Thing is that along with those they also had addons that changed the power in different ways. Spirit had prayer beads as well as the addons that increase passive phasing (which are completely useless but hey they exist) or give you movement speed after phasing. Legion has Stab Wound Study and Frank's Mix Tape.
---
I think Plague's addons offer up different playstyles and personal preferences, similar to Legion and Spirit. Running PoD Activation Time vs Object Infection Time is a similar choice to running Duration vs Activation Time on Spirit, or Duration vs Cooldown on Legion. It's just that looking at them at an initial glance you don't see anything that properly changes up gameplay like the addons for Doctor, Myers, or even Clown.
---
Her butt went to a different galaxy!
---
**HIT THE BRICKS PAL YOUR DONE**
---
3 or 4 seconds is a lot tho, thats all sloppy butcher adds on to normal heals, and if eaxh survivor has to only search 2 boxes for all 4 traps, then thats 24-32 seconds that add-on gives you. That's a lot time in a game like this.
---
Is she really taller than most killers, i.e., can see a bit higher than cornfields? That would be a first, and would actually help her using her ability.
---
Well when you misrepresent what I argued, then yes, but I'm comparing debuffs and cleansing effects/times. So five seconds for a insta heal is pretty bogus. I guess Plague players will have to leave pools of devotion corrupted so survivors can't insta heal. Obviously there's more to it than how we are simplifying it, but I would like to see an increase to the cleansing time do to the heal. Or remove the heal and keep the five seconds.

I can't be bothered going through everything on your post - but i'll do a quickie.

1. I never said Discordance was great full stop, I said specifically for  early game pressure (please don't take points out of context), in fact the reason I brought up 'teachables' is for that reason exactly. 
---
2. Wraith has a little map control, it's not like he has 0. 
---
3. There is a big rift in the thought process required between say a good Hag and a good Legion. Don't kid yourself otherwise. 
---
4. If you genuinely think that hyperbolic statements such as your first point (I.E you think at Rank 1 Legion can never chain frenzy hits) helps your position at all - then you're misguided. 
---
TLDR: Inexperienced players have a right to an opinion, experienced players have an equal right to challenge them. Don't get your panties in a twist that I don't have the patience nor empathy to be kind when someone chats utter bollocks - including you, Mr Exaggerate.

I had one Twitch Streamer in the Basement, and found the second one hiding in the Locker down there, I dragged them over to the Hooked Survivor and Mori’s them right in front of each other as the other one was dying on the hook.
---
They both added me after and showed me the edited clip, they were both laughing super hard and got a good view of me and the other guy being Mori’d. They were super nice and thanked me for the “free show”.
---
That’s probably the only positive experience I had with Twitch. Most Streamers try too hard to Teabag/Loop to keep their viewers “interested”, and I’ve had several disconnect before my Mori has finished.
---
Thank you, I will. Really hoping to get at least a thousand respondents. 
---
I know I've seen it. But it made no sense in my opinion. 
---
Like for real who destroys a tank with a pistol lmao.

YIKESS...
---
Should be Calm Spirit. Calm Spirit's current only use is to counter one (and a half - technically counters Clown since you won't scream and cough when hit by a Clown bottle) Killer.
---
Given the fact that CS also makes you cough less when hit by Clown bottles making puking quieter against Spirit would make sense I think.
---
I mean, they did say they based it on the hatchet code so there was some precedent, but yeah, probably still a bugger.
---
More like the Trapper is literally across the room and BOOM stunned
---
You can also get these perks from the store (I believe 1k or 2k shards so like 5-10 levels) and use them across any killer without having to level up as much. You also shouldn't have to run perks that make survivors weaker. People should stay mangled once they get a hook through a lung after getting slashed. A camping first aid kit shouldn't be able to heal someone who has had 2  hooks pierce their chest and have them jogging like nothing happened. 
---
This is a game my friend. There will be some suspension of disbelief. Like you would in a play or movie. Plus, some of the gen perks are OP on their own and are fun as shit. Like having your radius drop to 0% when a gen hits 80% done and highlighting the gen that's almost done. Or overcharge that pretty much cuts the skill check zone in half and if messed up, causes an extra 15-20% regression when failed. It's all part of the game. If you want some help, let me know what killer you usually use and I may have some suggestions on what to use to counter survivors 
---
Ah, the good ole' days. I miss 10k pipping.
---
"Don't be an ass, Francis."
---
Honestly, yeah...probably right. The puking does need a bit of a nerf

We play casually and joke around the vast majority of the time, and we both still hit rank 1 every single season because it so easy.
---
Just think of how many games you've been able to achieve the top rank in, and how long it took you if you did.  Now compare that to hitting rank 1 in DBD...Its a joke.
---
I don't find it acceptable for a killer to be just " halfway decent." Especially when Behavior keeps making it harder to be a killer. 
---
Just the way you describe plague makes her sound like she won't be impactful to game, and I'm sure she'll be atrocious on console. Do to everything and anything causing FPS drops. 
---
No one's crying it was just very illogical. 
---
I like the sound of that. League of legends does it as well. Makes you wait for a certain amount of time before you can Re queue for another game. It starts off small but scales up over time until it reaches 30 minutes ( I believe? I haven't really been exposed to this) for your next 5 games. 
---
I think so
---
I know I'm just telling Buzz to because the age old Woody vs Buzz 
---
I think I it fits her though since she’s a priest 
---
I always type “Open your mouth guys! Let’s catch a snowflake!” before we load into the game 
---
Can go does if for a week if you intentionally die in the game for every round 
---
Don’t heal and gen push.  Only mend deep wounds.  They aren’t terribly rotten games. I have a worse time playing against the clown.
---
the guy got downed, what a baby survivor.
---
Jesus dude, the killer’s not even out, technically.  Survivors always struggle to adapt against a new killer at first. Don’t worry, you’ll adapt and in no time, you’ll be butt dancing at the exit gates. 
---
Well... Amanda was a heroin addict so take that as like...
---
Oh lol
---
Guys, her canon name is Vommy-Mommy get it right
---
She feels balanced, but thats not saying much when nurse, hillbilly and spirit exist
---
*awful, not even top tier easy to beat any day of the week
---
As OP as it sounds it would be kinda fun as a nurse. Imagine omegablink + distressing + this perk... Would be so broken.
---
So you cleanse your sickness, stay injured....and in return grant the killer a very strong power? Why would anyone cure, it would be broken and stupid. Now you’re left with a boring killer as a result.
---
THIS IS GOING TO HELL IN A HAND BASKET REAL FAST
---
Theyve been nerfed but they are still overpowered as hell lmao. Gen speeds and second chance perks are ridiculous rn
---
The Plague on the left screen also has some of the upcoming cosmetics.
---
Gameplay wise, it's not as interesting as her powers are basically a mash-up of a Doctor's AoE delay x potentially weaker version of Hatchets mixed in with a non-lethal version of Pig's reverse bear trap mechanics. So she's boring in essence of gameplay.
---
But she's *so rich* in meme potential.
---
I’m not necessarily for or against balance changes to her but I just wanted to point out that a great number of even veteran players (killers and survivors alike) thought Freddy was OP when he first came out. All and all I’m gonna wait for people to adapt to her and figure out how to play as and against her before I make a statement about balance
---
If I start seeing a streamer DCing just because they don't like the killer, I'm not going to watch that streamer anymore.
---
There is one fatal problem with your plan. Dwight had to leave the locker for the perk to work
---
Oh yes my dude !! I've seen more than 5 memes in this subreddit in less than 5 minutes 
---
way more pallets on the map, flashlight and pallet saves were very easy, pallet vacuum. It was pretty awful.
---
Spirit has the best ability to be scary. I put her up there with myers on fun factor. A good killer playing spirit will absolutely massacre a non communicating team.
---
Self care is 25 seconds last I checked, and I'd think a 10-15 second cleanse timer would be acceptable with the insta heal, or maintain the 5 and remove the insta heal.
---
I've seen a bit and I'm going of what I've seen. **Maybe** it was their first time with The Plague. 
---
If you want a great perk that I personally think is a necessity for most killers then take bamboozle but if you really like the new killer then I’d say that’s more worth it 
---
But if it works then it's perfect.
---
Thiccc
---
Wait. What if I just suck in general. 
---
Game identifies if you commit suicide in game or if you get killed by player 
---
I think they should just reduce it a bit. It's really a pain in the ass imo
---
It’s supposed to be a pain in the ass, difficult to play with, force you to go cure yourself.
---
It’ll work for Dwight, cause every Dwight has to migrate to any other locker.
---
Iron maiden activates....
---
Screaming intensifies
---
Me oh look he slipped 
---
It's a bug
---
Myers is not for platinum. He is DLC
---
I like it , especially since it sounds religious in a way.
---
Claudette flashblinding and teabagging killers from unreachable heights. New level of toxicity obtained.
---
Or you can just go drink tf outta those pools and start murdering people with your puke. Someone instahealing themselves just so the killer can get godmode is one heck of a trade off for the killer. 
---
I like it as is just because the survivors have to make a choice about whether they want to empower the killer and then the killer gets good use out of the pools depending on how effective of a player they are
---
Calm spirit counters the Doctor as well. It also counters the new perk where it shows your aura if near a downed survivor.
---
I always do the same thing. I'll keep a note of which streamers I played with that night and will watch VODs of the match from their point of view. It really helps to see what mistakes I'm making.
---
It's also cool to see when you play with someone that has 1000+ viewers - it's almost like \*I\* had that many viewers. lol, Last night I played against Sequisha and his whole room (1100 viewers) was ragging on me for playing nurse during the PTB - but I was just doing a daily to get PB to level up the new killer. lol
---
Jeff be like who TF is this twerp
---
Yeah but you wont even notice cause she's not on discord with him.
---
Thanks for the help
---
I'm well aware of that. But having a damaging attack that does not give the survivor a speed boost is a problem, full stop
---
Come back and tell me this B's when you get a cosmetic
---
If you're shit at her, yeah. You can say that about nurse too, just because the player playing them is bad doesn't mean she's bad.
---
These bugs are actually incredible. Like,what changes in a working code could produce such mess? 
---
Oooh suicide. Got it. 
---
Stop....
---
Get some help
---
mad cuz bad
---
So I can escape and win and de-rank? This is bad for lower rank killers. 
---
Yeah, but it doesn’t matter to anyone who instinctively plays toxic.  Regardless of winning or losing, they’ll be toxic and talk so much garbage post game. 
---
Wow, that's some really good art 
---
Would you rather fuck a heroin addict, or a literal rotting corpse?
---
Lol you get shit on no matter what you do, theres no deserving anything. Just start every match at max toxic, the only idiots are the ones who thinks its worth discussing.
---
A regular woman's booty claps, Jane's booty thunderclaps.
---
Tbh the voice acting sounds really bad 😬
---
But people forget to mention that Legion's ability has a pretty small duration unless someone u Legion is slow as the huntress and spirit in their regular walking speed, they can't see scratches left by people running and rely on either blood trails or the heartbeat/vision effect they have where they can see others inside their terror radius.
---
Legion can quickly hit one person twice in a row and suffer the stun but will have to catch up to them to hit them the third time.
---
Personally I haven't seen what the big deal is playing as and against Legion.
---
SWF players have been speaking to each other since almost the beginning.
---
Can we get a template? thanks
---
Ranks also come into play on wait times. If your not 15 your in a fucking lobby for 30min 
---
Even worse you got idiots DC and shit in post chat about how you are the problem
---
Ffs 
---
I don't think you know what crossplay is.. This is a mashup ^^' crossplay is when you cosplay a character of another gender. Ex. I'm a woman who cosplay as a man.
---
But yeah, it's fun tho ^^
---
Dont level clown or coulro will show up in your bloodweb. Just get bamboozle.
---
This post was made by locker gang.
---
3 minutes is a little late to DC due to the map. Probably got looped and couldn't handle it. RIP party streamers 
---
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY A GAME AS KILLER OMFG
---
Sure 
---
D's deliverence/kobi and breakdown 
---
Fuck you clown I'm making you work for this ass
---
-Jane 2019
---
Spirit is a top tier killer. So if you’re getting your ass handed to you, you probably just need more practice.
---
Gives me an idea on how to change the meta and reduce the grind, just start combining similar perks aside from calm spirit+iron will though this might create potentially OP perks so maybe not.
---
yeah PTB killer wait times always suck cause everyone wants to try the new killer
---
Thanks for being humble and reasponding to the critiques in this post. Lots of respect.
---
I've also suggested making the cleanse slightly longer, but since we are hung up on the antiheal, well, who wants to run around with the broken status effect? I don't think what I've suggested would make her broken let alone boring. This is an asymmetrical game right?
---
ooooooh, that's low LOL
---
Thank god Im not the only one that thinks that this idea could somewhat work
---
thanks
---
IDK where to post it xD

You want to nerf one of the only game stalkers killers have? What?
---
Added my response, putting my name here to see the results later
---
My people!
---
Well something similar happened to me against a myers but i got teleported back to the basement of a house and got hit twice there
---
It's only a visual thing. Once you exit back to the menu screen, you'll have gained that pip back.
---
The only thing you lose when a killer DC's are the bloodpoints you gained during that game, and the pips you may have scored.
---
**You do not go down a pip when a killer DC's.**
---
Thanks man, I acknowledge I was reckless and rude in the past and accept that that has likely stained people's image of me - I'm just hoping people aren't too turned away to see how much I've changed 💕
---
Yeah but from what it seems, alot of gamers stop playing or calm down alot with it after they have families
---
*Low toned piano intensifies*
---
11 😬 prob to young to be have 1,500 hours in any game lmao
---
You're only supposed to get it as a survivor but it was bugged for a while where the killer would get it and survivors won't. As of now it seems to be triggering properly.
---
Oh. I didn't even bother to look at that...thank you so much! 
---
What does High mid-low high means? 
---
Yeah, i used to complain that killers were bad and survivors were op, since that was how it was, but id rather have op survs then op killers
---
Kinda upsetting her vomit doesn't summon a horde of zombies  
---
Survivors can be op. Its possible for me to not even see another survivor. If people hide well nothing will reveal them. 
---
I don’t get it. What is going on in the bottom picture
---
Is she saying real stuff or is it just gibberish? 
---
This post was inevitable.
---
cant wait.
---
&gt;not even worth running
---
Fuck off. It’s meant to be anti tunnel after the rework. It’s still very much usable and if you genuinely believe it’s unusable now then you are a fucking moron. 
---
It depends on what the definition of OP entails, though. Fun is also subjective, so I'm not sure I can comment on what you and your friends felt was fun, but as someone who played a lot of killer in the beginning, there was nothing fun about getting looped for days, and then getting pallet slapped by a teleporting survivor with a stun range of 5 meters.
---
This is what led to only a handful of killers ever being successfully use at high ranks against decent survivors.
---
I have struggled to maintain a Rank 1 as killer when not playing Nurse or Spirit, but each month I keep accidently hitting Rank 1 as survivor. Something is pretty off about that.
---
Also, killers feeling helpless also feeds into the stupidly obnoxious behaviors of camping and tunneling people.
---
Honestly her ass just weirds me out.

Frank can't be a survivor because he is a dick
---
The gens are all finished and the exit gates are likely already open, so I'd say trying to lure in the untrapped guys
---
Thats a risk we arent willing to take. 
---
LET ME IIINN ENTITY!!!
---
Yeah, Janny! Survivors should get the insta-heal midchase! Wait, what?
---
Oh piss on you calling me exaggerate then deliberately exaggerating what I say, of course hitting two survivors in a row is possible at rank 1, it's just very unlikely because survivors don't really group up against Legion; of course Hag is harder to learn than Legion, she's like top 3 hardest killers to learn, someone like Myers, Bubba or Wraith are just as much as a nobrainer than Legion. Just because you feel entitled to spewing your opinion it doesn't give you the right to answer so rudely. If you want to answer to someone, correcting them or whatever, there are better ways to do it. If you don't have the time and patience, I have neither of those things for you, I will just say this: your horse is so high it might as well be a giraffe.
---
Lol.
---
She has assumed her final (thicc) form.
---
(an actual response with numbers) Healing used to take 12 seconds. Sloppy Butcher made it 16. In a single patch, the base healing time was changed from 12-&gt;16 seconds, and Sloppy Butcher then makes that 16-&gt;20 seconds.

I was just gonna say Ive been playing since august but i had a feeling people would tell me i havent played long enough to have an opinion. I have no clue how many hours i have in game so this was the next best thing to show Im not just casual and my opinion is valid to these people who think otherwise.
---
Oh didn't see that. it is okay then. 
---
I'D LOVE TO BUT MY ONLY KILLER WITH GOOD PERKS WAS NURSE UNTIL I PRESTIGED HER TOO, NOW IM STUCK WITH A FEW SHITTY UNLEVELED P1 KILLERS AT RANK 1 AND I AM STUCK IN THIS ETERNAL LOOP, BUT THANK YOU FOR THE FUCKING ADVICE, I'LL PROBABLY TRY IT WITH BUBBA 
---
YES, MY FORMAT IS CATCHING ON
---
*oinks in disapproving tone*
---
Dude, I have that exact same headset! It's terrible for console, an uncomfortable, janky piece of garbage. It has no mute button on headset and does not have the option to hear yourself through headphones...Wallpapers cool though.
---
Hag was nowhere near as good as she is now and it involved Survivors playing Muddy Splinter after getting it in their bloodweb which forced the killer to play Hag with no addons.

 DEEP lore theories incoming.

Self care is I believe 32 seconds to be exact.
---
Trust me, watch someone now who’s become used to playing her. I personally am not a fan, and don’t think he’s that great of a killer, but watch Tru3 with her now. He’s doing nothing that requires great skill, and stomping on people.  You will see exactly why the healing is just fine as it is, and why Purge actually needs a bit of a nerf. When it’s corrupt you can just shoot damage vomit over and over and down people. It’s ridiculously strong.
---
That Ace looks like the kind of guy to pick the preschool map...

This is a new system? I thought it was a bug, I 4k’d with 2 gems done and de-pipped.

Those neon colors will get you killed.

I was hoping Michael would just roll in and murderize both David and Frank, it's not like he would care whether Frank was a knife pervert or not

It was the plane that flew overhead moments later that actually blew up the tank. The meme is that his handgun was completely ineffective.

Cleansing totems, you?

Lolololololol 
---
Hitting people
---
disapproving? :(
---
Imo, I was able to get to rank 1 by literally living on Tyde's channels and Twitch streams. He is educational. He is very opinionated though, and I could see how some people might take it as him being rude or something. If you want knowlege of the game, he's pretty good to watch. 
---
I have stayed rank 1 and learned to loop and keep up with really good killers by watching No0b3 tho. 
---
You seem like the toxic troll for disconnecting 
---
Bill is a character from the game Left 4 Dead which is a co-op zombie survival game, Boomer was one of the special infected types that would puke on you much like our lovely Vomitress does.
---
Well, he was dying and desperate for a last stand. I don't think he actually believed he would blow up the tank, which he didn't, as it was the tank buster plane that actually did the deed.
---
No it's not a bug, they made changes to the pip scoring and some of the killer requirements for specific emblems.
---
The devs are definitely biased. It's obvious they picked a side and are sticking with it. The whole thing just makes it seem like they don't give a shit about half of the community even though killers can't kill if there are no survivors. It's all very frustrating and sad almost like being in an abusive relationship. 
---
Still don't really give a shit about the ds nerf though.
---
I've started using small game, its the most op perk in the game.
---
Granted the bbq really doesnt change a whole lot anyway since most people just jump in a locker or run distortion/ are close enough so its not so bad. Its just niether of these 2 perks needed the buff. They are already very powerful perks and you see them in pretty much every build at rank 1. Now with these changes you dont even need tier 3 for them to be pretty much just as good meaning the people who only have ruin or bbq tier 1 will just add to the pool of people who only use meta perks. Its just such a stale meta at this point and these buffs dont help. Honestly we probably wont ever get out of it and every game we play till the game is dead killers will only run perks like these bc they arent buffing worse perks 
---
I've found that the best combination for Ace is the Red Suit top with the Lunar New Year Pants. 
---
I also use the hairstyle with shaved sides and sunglasses. 
---
Slickest Ace that puts the new shit to shame. 
---
Id give gold, but im on mobile at work. Just know I love you.
---
Awesome now all the sweaty are more likely to ruin lower rank games more than before.
---
The third person on the other side blew it up and you just can’t see. 
---
Nurse is bad in the wrong hands
---
Freddy can be amazing in the right hands
---
The killer plagues' base kit is fun, strong enough, and personally I think it's fun to play against.
---
Tier ? Yet to be determined
---
If you're serious. Bill is from Left 4 Dead, a zombie game. That fat thing in the bottom panel is the Boomer. It vomits on you and causes a horde to spawn and aggro on you.
---
You can thank Ochidouche, Noob3, and AngryManchild for most of it.
---
Which makes it even better
---
I hope I can say this without being downvoted to much as my lowest post on this sub is a "0." I have about 120 hours on killer with about 40 hours on killer. I'm probably not as good as some streamers because I usually run away from looping because I don't want to play mind games with survivors.
---
The point is as a rhythm based killer, DS really did get in the way. It was like being hyped up then realizing I just killed the obsession. That pretty much meant they had DS. Basically it disrupted the flow of the game. I even been in games where I have been hit with 2 -3DS recently. Might not sound like a lot until I played back in 2017 when I was against 4 DS.
---
I never expected there’d be a day we had to explain L4D stuff. 
---
I feel old. 
---
That's what it's *supposed to be*, but it doesn't work that way.
---
Somebody tested this twice, each time with a sample size of around 500 traps, and both times the data was a near perfect match for traps being a 50/50 shot.
---
You're not sick. In an overall reason for killer is the sacrificing part that gets me.
---
20k for cosmetics. Its super hefty amount tbh 
---
Oh man I love people like you
---
Claudette: Don’t try it.
---
87% of sacrifices I masturbate to. 
---
PedOchido and Douche3 😉
---
I really don’t get why killer mains say survivors are OP. I do well 95% of the games I play as killer with all killers. Only occasion survivors are OP is when they’re in a SWF and they’re smart
---
Dude. You’re telling me. 
---
This comment I made has been stuck in the back of my head since they changed her sounds around the husk. 
---
Now that someone has called me out, I can be put to rest. Lmao. 
---
I agree, but really like the idea of being able to heal at the fountain as a fair counter to the vile purge. I think they should change the fountain time to be comparable with how long it takes a survivor to remove a reverse bear trap. Then the Plague could have add-ons (like the Pig) to reduce the time spent to cleanse yourself. 
---
Im gonna guess 16-20 is highest
---
I love when I’m oblivious to the joke and try to explain and get passive aggressive comments back :)) it feels great 👍🏽
---
Poyo~
---
Her ass is as big as her torso, you don't think that's weird?
---
game would be over in less than 30 seconds lol
---
"I can't get over how FAST they all are, it's not even fair. I'm calling zombie bullshit on that, you know? They're not...ALLOWED to be so fast."
---
This times 100!
---
What I think is that survivors are OP (except against a god nurse) , but only as a 4 (possible 3)-man swf. Having the communication can lead to so much more efficient gameplay, but when only as a duo or solo playing a survivor is really tough. So when the devs are trying to balance the game either survivors will be buffed or nerfed depending on how many friends you have. This is the main problem which a simple comms or chat for survivors should fix, but that'll prob never happen since it also generates a lot of toxicity where there is already enough of in this game. 
---
You do realize that the newest patch also has survivor perk buffs right?
---
fucking christ, survivor mains are whiny
---
This. I cant tell you how many times a totem got me killed. Survivors shouldn't have to open the exits either. BHVR pls!
---
You got lil pp.
---
/r/woosh/
---
My bad man. I honestly have never played it
---
That would really really suck. And i think they are gonna rework/nerf sc again bc they tried with the 75/75 heal speed to you and others and it was too powerful i guess
---
Yeah we're gonna need that posted here.
---
&gt; I feel like this Ruin change was very unnecessary but who knows, maybe they plan to nerf it soon
---
No, the devs are finally moving away from the fucking absurd tiered perk system that never should have existed to begin with
---
How do you flail arms? PS4
---
FUCKING DELETE LEGION! FUCK THAT STUPID ASS PIECE OF SHIT KILLER. ALL OF THEM ARE THE SAME, RUIN, BBQ, NOED, SLOPPY BUTCHER. I REFUSE TO SAY GG TO ANY SAD EXCUSE FOR A LEGION MAIN
---
Honestly I couldn’t even see you for like 10 seconds
---
I HAD A FEW GAMES AGAINST THE EPITOME OF A “FAIR” TOXIC LEGION. POPPING FRENZY AND SPAMMING LUNGE TO FLY ACROSS THE MAP AT MACH 7 AFTER MY TIGHT LITTLE NEA ASS.
---
Literally every other post here is some survivor main fucking crying and whining 
---
Wait, the splinters spawned in the survivor bloodweb? Jesus that’s fucking stupid.
---
Unionize. They can't keep getting away with it.
---
aaa, ty so much T//T
---
What kindred? I didnt see much else. Oh they changed the text of empathy lol
---
I'll believe dev's word over you quoting 'somebody' with no footage presented here or proof of any kind
---
Good for you.
---
You're better off staying sick because the puke does next to nothing, and more to the point 1 has zero effect on your ability to do Gens, vault, drop windows, hide, etc. 
---
Oh sorry, Im a pc player and i didnt remember that on  console dlcs achievement arent necessary for the platinum 
---
I'm going to be doing more on the channel with different games. If you all like pokemon, animal crossing and other horror games. This is my first time doing this so please keep expectations extremely low for now lol
---
But yeah i'm excited to see what happens! I'm uploading a 2nd video right now, and hopefully i can get another one up soon. Maybe on a switch game. I just don't know which one yet.
---
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy lives to read this too
---
Idk, I'm retarded and always cash-out my shards on the shrine. 😂
---
fucking lol yeah the people who gave us insta blinds and infinites and pallet vacuumes etc are killer biased
---
fuck off
---
they're actually fixing the game
---
I'll tell you rn , if you start from zero today you'd have to play over 8 hours a day to get 9k shards by the time dlc is released.
---
Sure, doesn’t change the fact about those who run noed or end game builds. 
---
Cute 
---
ARE YOU SERIOUS!? AS KILLERS ARENT BROKEN ENOUGH AND ALWAYS BUFFED WHILE SURVIVORS GET NERFED INTO OBLIVION
---
Some people think he looks like a crack addict unmasked but Frank is super handsome to me. I'd totally date him irl...if he wasn't a killer, wasn't as out of control, and wasn't possibly psychopathic as the lore makes him seem. Also, if he wasn't already with Julie.
---
It's not all his looks. I like that he's into music, played basketball, like his style, and somehow him being Canadian is a turn on (idk why, just the idea he's from some rural Canadian mountain place. I'm Californian from the coast with barely any experience with snow)(So, the different background + different country is interesting). 
---
A nice version of Frank is my dream boyfriend :-(
---
How so? Like I've seen plenty of ladies with phat booties. 
---
according to the wiki you will need to reach somewhere in the 35-49 range(doesn't say exactly where for some reason) to get 9000 and that will take around 217 games on average(but that can change based on how well you do each game and if they are first wins of the day or not)
---
CAN I MAKE A RULE OF NOT SAYING GG TO A LEGION? 
---
Eenope 
---
*cries in spirit*
---
I’m calling BS. Myers’s stalking in the corn?  Not going to happen. Even if it’s just a pallet. 
---
Shitty map, swf or whatever ur still gonna get decent bp. My guess is an artificial rank. He knew he would depip 
---
hero of the day
---
You fucking lied about survivors perks lmfao
---
Also, making tier 1 and 2 match tier 3 in some way is not a buff to the perk
---
hopefully the soon end the tier system and all perks just assume the tier 3 use
---
You are correct, 41% 
---
Maybe but I'm level 40 ish and have 8k. Getting to 20k isn't much of a grind. 
---
Neah, I love him as a killer.
---
It's good man. L4D is a great game (I have like 800 hours on L4D2). If you use Steam, check it out. It's fairly cheap and still has a fairly active player base.
---
As the plague you want them to get cleansed.. Also the new killer is balanced for all I can tell.
---
However the new survivor isn’t, her thiccness is too much 
---
Well it’s suppose to help stall the match considering how fast they can go and the insta heal kinda ruins that aspect 
---
We don't need to be melodramatic, we aren't killer mains. 
---
The game isn't unplayable by any means, just not engaging for the survivors. There's no more "maybe I'll get away" feeling in chases anymore, its simply "how long can I run before he gets me". 
---
The real kicker for me is that, regardless of how shit survivor feels, killers will always fall back to their victim complex of "killer is so stressful and so much more skillful than survivor, woe is me". Is killer still going to be seen as the stressful role when it inevitably becomes the easier role due to being the "power role"? We'll have to wait and see. 
---
I still play a couple matches now and then, solo survivor because my friends stopped playing. It's the only game that had this sort of aesthetic and gameplay unfortunately.
---
&gt; according to the wiki you will need to reach somewhere in the 35-49 range(doesn't say exactly where for some reason) to get 9000 and that will take around 217 games on average(but that can change based on how well you do each game and if they are first wins of the day or not)
---
&gt; also really depends how much you play survivor/killer and how much you like the perks and playstyle of them
---
You need exactly 46 levels to get 9.110 Iridescent shards	
---
1.0? As in like the first version of the game? Its definitely not as hard as you think it is, I usually get 4ks or 3ks.
---
Can you actually respond more than once? It says "Submit another response" 
---
link the video
---
Yeah it seems easy but if you’ve always lunged it will be difficult because there is a lot of things you can’t do
---
Yes you can
---
Clown is pretty thick.
---
He must enjoy his job lucky him
---
you cannot heal, use flashlight, do gens in tier3, and him running around with yellow addons can easily get you to mad3, so not "almost completely"
---
HA HA HA HA *wheeze *cough 
---
It’s much better than having a killer take no skill and still doing what she does. 
---
I think it would depend on the killer. Sometimes first person wouldn't fit the mori. 
---
YOU FUCKING SERIOUS LOWER CASE PIECE OF SHIT GET THAT OUT OF HERE
---
Im a bit nervous to start lunging, after playing for so long and just quickslashing. Might mess with my groove.
---
There are differences, but they are smaller than before. It's a game design choice and benefits newer players only. So there is not really a reason do complain. I wouldn't even call it a buff.
---
So, different topic, I shouldn't Horde the shards then? 
---
Yikes. Luckily I had around 1800 shards before I hit devotion 1, so maybe that will help, even if just a bit. But if I remember correctly, console has later dlc releases so if I'm correct I'll have a little more time. I hope. 
---
Ah cool. Curious to see the full results when you have enough submissions.
---
Yeah let's nerf the Perk due to a theoretical situation that is honestly going to be pretty rare anyway.
---
Just play around for a bit so you don’t get mocked 
---
Awww, that's so sweet!! :-) That made me smile!
---
Maybe lag but, imho, it is fine. 
---
In some instances you're right but I just hope future mori's (since they haven't been made yet) won't have this issue. I think seeing things in a different point of view before we start judging what could and couldn't work should be important before saying flat out they won't work
---
Thiccest is Hag 
---
im not saying its good, im saying its better than watching the dude rage about it
---
Eh, not to worried about that. I’ve been kicking ass without a vital tool for this long, I’ll be doing even better. :)
---
I have to ask if you are menstruating or not so I know if you are serious

---
Kink?
---
How did they get there?
---
😳 you're welcome. Have a good day. And thank you for not taking it weird.
---
Honestly, you need those toxic players tho, that way you can truly appreciate the non-toxic ones. 
---
It not crutch, it clutch
---
SOME PEOPLE REFUSE TO USE SPRINT BURST WHEN THE KILLER ISNT NEAR YET
---
Hold on, WHAT?!
---
low end-hyperx cloud core. its the best bang for your buck. high end-sennheiser anything. sennheiser is the very best, or at least top 3 while still being extremely affordable.
---
Is that... how'd that happen?!
---
"I fell"
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Yeah that’s fair.
---
the pc137 or whatever they sell on massdrop is like $120
---
Do you believe your own lies? All stats the devs have ever realeased have always shown Killers to be favored. Killers are favored on every map and at every rank.
---
Excuse me, but can you draw an arrow or something?
---
Did you actually spot her?
---
Nah. You should horde if you feel like you would be wasting them by not getting what you want. If no perks are around that look good then maybe buy a outfit or killer if you dont have one. Either way if a perk did pop up you wanted you'd have 7 days to get 2k shards. 
---
No one ever denied problems on the killer side. However, you're deliberately choosing the most extreme examples that have been corrected quite a while ago. Most of the survivor nerfs and killer buffs nowadays are just not justified. They're just ruining the gameplay for half of the community for the sake of handing shit players a kill. And to be clear: THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE UPCOMING DS CHANGE. That one is ok.
---
I want a shirt that says SMUT! Is there a pornHUBE one?
---
I was only talking about the victory cube for the killers, Survivors are going to be more complex and will need a different pipping system.
---
I HATE THIS, MY FRIENDS AND I GET A RAINBOW MAP AND SKELETON KEY AND OF COURSE WE LOSE OUR WHITE WARDS WHEN THE KILLER DC’S
---
Buddy unless you wanna get downvoted you should probably so /s
---
Literally... people in general act like they’ve never seen a person who’s not got the regular thin body type 
---
From now on everytime I hear that *snap*, I'm going to imagine it's just Ace running up &amp; slapping Trapper's ass.
---
Lotta meat on her bones 
---
Should've put his hand in his pants
---
I hadn’t.
---
I *THINK* I see her, Claudette being higher than she should be? (Could be a Feng, I can only see black hair)
---
I made emojis outta all of them for my discord server 
---
Dlc drops same time for everyone.
---
Ptb is another thing entirely.
---
Not everyone is immersed.
---
i.e. it's not worth it, as fun as the game can be it actually will work better for everyone (arguably) if you work one minimum wage hour instead of grinding for the shards (I can't seem to convince myself of this, of course, because I'm stupid, it's not always easy to just find work, and I like to earn things but the game really ins't in to earnables except for certain events or gross cosmetics).
---
And if anyone wants to know I calculated how long it would take a new player to grind to get one of those Christmas Sweaters at 4500 shards and the est. time was about 50 hours. 
---
4500 x 2 = 9000 shards = 100 hours (at 50hr/4500shards)
---
It was a major criticism I had of the Christmas event that people new to the game (everyone really) couldn't feasibly earn A GIFT on CHRISTMAS.
---
Also Devotion needs some sort of change because going back to level 1 just hurts you, see also prestige. Blah blah blah, I like DBD, but when it's not event time I feel like it's pushing me away from playing because there's no real end-game (or it's all end-game) or winnables that I'd like.
---
Clown was the only killer not released on time.
---
Honestly as a killer who will tunnel and camp you if you wanna be a teabagging shithead, your rage only feeds me. Your hate gives me strength. Your salt tastes amazing on my fries.
---
RIP OFFERINGS AND ITEMS
---
Kate will always be best girl
---
Do you even tried new DS? After 60 seconds this perk is gone and killer with a little IQ will just slug or ignore you for 60 seconds. I had it yesterday in PTB for like 3-4 hours in red ranks and i didnt have a chance to even test it. So its now completely useless. Maybe it will be useful in like green ranks or lower cuz killers tunnel there like crazy.
---
WHY DID A P3 RANK 2 CLAUDDETTE PLAY LIKE A LEVEL 20
---
SHE HID FROM THE DOCTOR IN A HOUSE WHEN SOMEONE ELSE WAS BEING CHASED
---
SHE RAN AWAY FROM THE PALLET WHEN SHE WAS BEING CHASED
---
GOD BRING US THAT NEW RANKING SYSTEM
---
Too bad the chainsaw hitbox is the size of Jane's ass.
---
and pig. thanks though homie, I like your screen name
---
Lmao what? Killers have never been favoured lol
---
Holy shit Left 4 Speed, an absolute classic 
---
Age 35+ that's a pretty large upper limit. 
---
50+ here
---
Dont lie to us I know you are just really big and made it look you were in a tree
---
I really do not understand what you’re complaining about.
---
&gt;Its just niether of these 2 perks needed the buff.
---
The perks did not get a buff. They’re more like quality of life changes that make sense. Normally, the difference between perk tiers is effect percentages. However, some perks are completely different to their Tier 3 counterparts, like Devour Hope. Tier 1 offers only the 5 Token Mori, where as the other tiers have Exposed and Haste. It’s almost as if they’re different perks.
---
The same thing occurs with Ruin T1. It only affects 2 Survivors, which could actually be stronger than T3, because now only 2 Survivors have a reason to look for the totem instead of 4. Imagine people running Ruin T1 and refusing to level it up to T3 because it effectively lasts longer on 2 people than 4? That would be poor game design. 
---
Overall, all these perk changes make absolute sense. The perks should be consistent, rather than completely different and weak variations. 
---
I'm probably biased because I'm only playing solo survivor, and you're correct it's a miserable experience. And having that experience when I play and then coming here and seeing the 974th post about how stressful killer is just makes my blood boil.
---
The game is only over too quickly I've noticed when survivors manage to outmaneuver the killer. No one thinks the game is unblanaced if the killer got a 4k before the 1st gen was done. Idk, just an interesting anactode I've noticed. Probably means nothing.
---
I appreciate your response and also for pointing out that the experience can be garbage for both sides. I'm pretty biased in my comments lately so your response is refreshing.
---
Oh well I’m going to delete that comment cause I’m getting downvoted for it too much.
---
This was a confirmed bug. I believe it's fixed now. You are not supposed to lose items when a killer DCs, unless you dropped the item somewhere (e.g. Franklin's Demise).
---
Didn't want to see that
---
It still holds up, at least. Been playing it again with a friend recently and it's still loads of fun, plus custom levels and mods add even more replayability. ~~It hurts there'll never be a three, though...~~
---
They buffed ruin? In what way
---
I know they buffed thanophobia which needed a buff tbh
---
They are reworking it all so it wont be out for a while. I think its still in early access mode
---
I did! 
---
Adrenaline is the most powerful perk in the game, it allows survivors to rush gens while injured with zero consequence. It needs to just be deleted like old tinkerer
---
in what language?
---
If I'm not mistaken this is Jeff's (QA dude) wallpaper.
---
Wow, okay then.
---
haha, you answered too quickly, there's a breakdown below, there's got to be some other way to help the community and not have to waste 100 man hours (that's actually something the game should really pay people for, I mean if you look at it that's nuts, and there's no single-player really), in the old days you could mow a lawn or something, nowadays they have apps that allow you to do menial tasks like that, just don't get sucked into anything... Is my advice. Good luck. It's not worth the life time trade. People should value their time more.
---
How in the world did she get 3 kills
---
Don't take it personally. 
---
Don't tell people how to play.
---
YOU CAN TEABAG AS THE PIG. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE TIERLIST THEORISTS SAY. THAT MAKES HER TOP TIER
---
Wish i had a pc that can run this. 
---
SURVIVORS ARE FINE AND I'M  SAYING AS A SURVIVOR MAIN I WANT TO BE SCARED.
---
no
---
haha I know I know, you did a smashing job again!
---
What makes you think that attacking DBD content creators is okay??? Monto is by far the BEST content creator in this community. His funny random moments are infinitely better than any other streamer or whatever sooo yeah... Whatever floats ur boat hun 🤣🤣😂
---
She's flat on both ends
---
&gt;This is just blatantly wrong. At least 10 counters to DS exist. To say 0 exist is just a lie.
---
Nice joke. 
---
I DON'T WANT TO DEPIP JUST BECAUSE THE KILLER CHASED ME FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN PROCEEDED TO FACE CAMP ME FOR THE DURATION OF MY HOOK
---
The Boomer was in L4D1
---
New Survivor perk - Thiccness Overwhelming: Whenever in a 50 meter radius of the killer, your thicc booty draws the killers attention to you, forcing them to look at you until you leave the 50m radius.
---
New Killer perk - Switcheroo: literally alters the killers sexuality. sorry trapper, your gay now, no Jane for you. However, if a Jeff runs this perk it affects every killer regardless of sexuality. For reasons unmentioned.
---
MAN, WINNING A GAME, ENJOYING IT FOR THE FULL DURATION OF IT  AND PISSING OFF AN ASPIRING ASSHOLE STREAMER? I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM HERE
---
If you vomit on the enough, do they always become “broken” and get injured? Or is that an add on?
---
“Oh god no, Bill’s dea- WEAPONS HERE!”
---
I’m planning on running ds more now. I have build ideas I think would be fun with it
---
I have tried it, it is meant to stop tunneling. If they are ignoring you that is plenty of time to get healed up, and if they are slugging, you can get back up either with unbreakable or by your teammates. Also, the killer has no idea if you have DS so I doubt they will slug too much. 
---
It is not completely useless like you do boldly claim, it just has a different purpose. It’s meant to stop tunneling, not give you a get out of jail free card. Look, check out these videos about the DS rework
---
[Ardetha’s video](https://youtu.be/F_H3IcM3M5k) 
---
[King’s video ](https://youtu.be/tX2G8dscJTA) 
---
[Tyde’s video](https://youtu.be/Ic8AEXwXC1o) 
---
Outside this, there are plenty of streamers who have said, on stream, that is still usable. It will be useful at all ranks if you hate tunneling. 
---
Yeah I'm getting a connection error, servers seem to be down.
---
Nea is my faves but Kate is just so nice!
---
I was crouch walking against a Trapper, and it never gave me the ‘Press Button to Disarm’
---
Yeah they’re reworking the game, and I’m excited to see what’s in store. 
---
Bless honestly 
---
No, they’re only in the free section on the list because you’re in the ptb
---
Honestly I think I just have PTSD from that one time I watched an OchiDO montage to see how bad it is
---
yup me too
---
didn't use it before, might start running it now though, good anti tunnel perk
---
Steam is down
---
This guy gets it lol 
---
If they nerf thiccness people will riot
---

---
DAVID IS NOT GAY
---
No fucking way 😂
---
Crusty, oozing deliciousness
---
Wow!
---
Death is not an escape...
---
The plague isnt good yeah
---
&gt; No hate to Monto
---
Are we talking mechanics or ethics here? They do not necessarily align. 
---
And how exactly is he toxic?
---
It would literally kill this game. I despise playing against or with immersed babies because of how boring and slow the games are
---
Damn, I thought ‘the Nightmare’ was based off of Scary Terry.
---
Nah I don’t believe it. Your first theory was interesting but I think you’re grasping at straws. 
---
Next thing you’ll say the girl from Saw is in this game too...
---
No way my boy Sharp Hand Joe resembles this clown. 
---
You don't need to wait, just vomit on them some more.
---
i dont get why he was saying she is weak
---
Plus it ruins the other part of the trap, trying to kill them
---
no problem
---
Actually 1 fully charged purge if you hit them fully can put them in broken state so if your good at aiming it its a free down. I can see her being more hated than legion tbh 
---
I don't purposefully tunnel the trapped person, but I will harass them just enough to make it threatening. You'd be surprised how little work you need to put in to have a decent chance of getting a game over.
---
Probably bc the sickness doesn't do enough, the insta heals from the fountains, the puke on the objects goes away too quickly and the audio cue from the Corrupt Purge means that survivors know when to be immersed
---
- DS was stupid busted, 4 people running it (esp if they were on comms) was gg for pretty much any killer
---
- Ruin and BBQ didn't get buffed. At all. Neither did NOED, for that matter. Or Devour Hope, or M&amp;A, or any of the other perks. The perk tiers were altered so people don't have to grind so hard. That's it. Thanatophobia was buffed, Spies from the Shadows was nerfed.
---
- Survs have been getting nerfed because people can still do this shit pretty effectively https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5fBkJ9Z_ds 
---
You see the time on that video? Gens can be finished and gates powered in 3 minutes and 55 seconds. And that was perkless. All of that can still be done today, only slight difference is no pallet vacuum, which, lets be honest, wouldn't have added much time.
---
My fix is to make the game more even for solo survs and SWF. Can't balance the game properly when there are still two wildly different versions of the game being played. If you're struggling, I take it you solo queue, and you have my sympathy. Hopefully they give solo survs all the information benefits of SWF teams soon, so that this game can finally start to be balanced.
---
LIES!! nothing but lies! Clearly the nightmare is an original IP created by BHVR. How you came up with this comparison is beyond unthinkable!
---
I've had many games in which the trapper didn't darken the traps but they were completely invisible. When I find out it's the trapper I always look at the floor but I always get trapped anyway.
---
I mean, Clown isn’t a corpse, just a thought.
---
https://i.redd.it/bz9qfcrl3rk21.png here ya go 
---
Ah. Good to know someone else is a man of culture :P
---
If you ever get your hands on it, would you mind sharing it?
---
Thanks!
---
Good, I would be pissed if they postponed a chapter to fix a bug that happens once in every 15 games or so and you simply can queue again.
---
Head On + Dance With Me is going to be the way to go 
---
The game is super active. They're testing out new matchmaking stuff so that could be way. Also lobbies sometimes glitch. It could be a lot of reasons but player count definitely isn't one.
---
Ah that makes sense, thanks!
---
Players really expected her to be like Freddy in a way where you debuff everyone and just go on with ur business.
---
Infection doesn't slow down survivors or make them stop. They become broken, infectious, and vomit occasionally. Since you can still gen rush at the exact same speed during infection, the tracking is about the only real effect it has.
---
Yeah I was hoping that as well, my way to buff her is make the sickness do more IMO. Maybe give different debuffs at various stages, like Blindness at one and Hindered at the end along with Broken.
---
THE NEW PTB RANKING SYSTEM IS WORSE THAN THE LIVE ONE. 3K=DEPIP, 3 SOLO GENS AND ESCAPE = DEPIP. LOLWUT
---
How dare you talk about my son that way
---
It's 14xp per shard, no matter what level you're at.
---
9,000 shards is 126,000xp.
---
you gain xp at aproximately 1 per second in game (probably a tiny bit less), with mitigating gains after around the 5 minute mark. About 2,100 minutes of in-match time, or 35 hours. That's excluding time between matches, and assuming your matches end before the xp gain tapers off too far.
---
You matches probably won't be so perfectly timed, but I'm also not counting the 300xp daily bonus from playing your first game as each role (don't forget to collect those each day), nor the tiny 3 to 12xp bonus from your highest emblem, so it probably works out to close enough.

Enjoy.

No. If he was the first to do it then copycats are cropping up because of it. Ive seen about 3 or 4 channels doing it. 
---
THE KILLER WAS LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP CHASING SOMEONE ELSE. SHE USED SPRINT BURST TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE LATER IN THE GAME. WHY NOT ME? WHY DOES SHE HATE ME? AT LEAST HEAL ME ONCE YOU'RE DONE.
---
_Random Notification coming from the roof of a House incoming_
---
Trapper : "Be careful, fellow killers. Dwight 2.0 is here and she can hurt your forehead 
---
Clown THICC is always an option for sure
---
around like June he was known for it because it was great clickbait. I don't go exploring for new channels though so idk
---
I saw the glasses and thought they were fake? Are they for real lmfao. They look ridiculous.
---
"So I can brush my teeth"
---
"Why are your teeth so big, Mr Trapper?"

 All the better to eat you with, my sweet! 
---
Wasn’t L4D2 a prequel?
---
Legion=DC
---
I feel like if you have the broken status, it shouldn’t insta-heal, it should just remove the status effect and allow you to be healed, but without the broken status, you are healed.
---
Ooooo, that’s nice. 
---
The Boomer is clearly visible in the bottom panel
---
His lower half’s still in the dream world. 
---
Hot, very hot
---
yea same. it wss loke a thing. no voice chat, no dialogue. just screams, grunts, groans and moans
---
It's too situational to be useful.
---
Nice Commit, he must have been really triggered, did he DC? It happens to me once in a while, Game starts &gt; 4 seconds find Hex &gt; Destroy &gt; Killer DCs or I get facecamped.
---
I started to get a lot of the popular streamers in my Qs late at night and marvelled at how they could run a killer for what seemed like forever, but when I tried, I'd get two hit really quickly despite mindgaming.
---
So I turned on their stream and watched to try and see what I was doing wrong. A lot of them run Dead Hard to give them a boost of distance from the killer, even if they aren't about to be hit. I'm still learning how to use it as well as they do but that alone is a big help to gain a tiny bit of distance to keep the loop going and to avoid a hit if the killer catches up to you in the loop (obviously haha)
---
😅
---
In Karenist

Tru might be the only person I follow quite regularly but fuck, I hate what he says a lot of the time
---
So, did you bring Self-Care?
---
Watch his day 0 stream of ptb release to get the full picture 
---
I remember when survivors were aslo able to have bear traps, did nothing but was funny. 
---
I do but now I want to know more....
---
LOOOOOOL
---
I could see that.
---
Also there is a big right now, if they are cleansing in the fountain. And you hit them instead of grabbing them, they fall into the fountain and you can not pick them up:( 
---
oh shit i just got wooshed
---
they're not biased towards either side. they're just not good at the game.
---
The borrowed time XD oh i remember that perk. 
---
I just love these please keep on researching
---
So what we seeing is the actual size of are hitboxs?
---
Number 1 - OINK!
---
Jane has too much background.
---
I appreciate your post makes me see I really shouldn't get all wrapped up in it and just enjoy it for what it is. I've just been getting frustrated with the game lately. I will try to change my mindset and if I cant then probably take a break.
---
he can't be saved
---
I don’t need people calling me racial slurs to appreciate someone who simply says gg in chat. 
---
Yeah, these trophies are so bugged. But me and my other friends didn’t have an issue in this one so I wasn’t sure. Thanks
---
You can catch a lot of people off guard with crouching. Umm trap near the end of the match, if it gets that far, so they waste time at boxes. 
---
You can hide but you can't run, bitch!
---
If it makes you feel better my friend who is usually my source for DbD News told me she was quoting Beyoncé Lyrics in actual Babylonian and I deadass believed him for an hour or so 😩
---
I played a lot during that time, but I honestly don't remember anything about it.
---
I should stop drinking.
---
Tbh I would say it’s a little on the weaker side since it has so many requirements now AND it can be completely countered by enduring, but it’s better this way. 
---
I'm quite drawn to the doctor - I don't give two hoots about whether I 'win' or how many survivors I manage to sacrifice, but I just enjoy how he almost constantly laughs and seems to enjoy everything about the match, including messing with the survivors, causing chaos and confusion, and being kind of mischievous. and it's a lot of fun to practice the zaps before a survivor can vault/throw a pallet. and when I'm playing against him, I love how he walks and ugh ... generally his entire authority-esque appearance. 
---
**sighs** *unzips*
---
I get the pun. Still she is fine. 
---
Haha, L4D2 came out when I was 6 years old, but it is still one of my favourite games.
---
Michael's\*
---
Idk what's more dangerous. Freddy or showing the reddit community that you're a girl. See if you can lock your inbox to receive zero messages lol.
---
Way too much cottage cheese.
---
I actually learn a lot switching. I learn a lot losing too. "Oh, didn't know that kind of loop existed in the game. Noted", etc.
---
Oink~
---
Am I doing it right?
---
Maybe p4 claudette? 
---
ruin didn't get a buff, it was a rework. bbq isn't run for any other reason than bloodpoint gains, new DS should be an easier skillcheck and a longer stun.
---
Nah.
---
Freddy's entire presence in this game is how much of an endgame beast he CAN become.  If freddy has everyone sleep by the time gens are done, its a gg.  If you have Noed, it can't be safely cleansed, you can see anyone touching the door,  you can slug like crazy and have built in deer stalker and if you happen to favor blood warden and fully stacked Remember me AND his action speed addons, namely his swing chains and jump rope, then you just trapped them with you for 200s, meaning you honestly can toy with them and if they do manage to do open the gate after that long ass time, pop one of their friends on the hook and saunter to the exit gate wearing the biggest shit eating grin.
---
Everybody else save for Amanda, pretty much can only rely on praying they chose the right gate to check.  Disrespect Freddy's weak ass base 7s transition all you want, I know I do and I main him, but his endgame, should he see it up properly, is that bullshit and should be feared.
---
Lol fam if you saved up $1 per day you could just buy the dlc. 
---
/&gt; Claudette
---
That's a yikes from me mate
---
Did one for each role because I like playing as both survivor and killer. Will be interesting to see the results of this
---
Ouch. Joke almost lands solid, but you used the wrong freddy 2/10.
---
Swap him with Nea so she can finally take her rightful place amongst the killers
---
Also, they've also expressed that excessive gore could/would get them banned in some large countries.
---
I've been told by a dev that it's a bug. Its meant to be more semi-transparent and not be fully black. 
---
All too often. They're always the ones running the killer right at their team mates too.. Lol
---
You're being really weird right now. Nobody attacked Monto, and you're the one acting like a child. It's like you don't even have reading comprehension beyond a third grade level.
---
Omg.   That is all. 
---
Ah.  Thanks for the clarification.
---
It still seems as though there are times where that kinda thing just happens, though, without any intent.  If there's a 3-dude SWF with a random plus-one, then they're all communicating, probably hanging around each other, working on the same generators, etc., leaving that odd-man-out to fend for themselves.  That being the case, I'm more likely to find myself chasing the loner, not because I have some kind of vendetta, but because I'm not that experienced, and the other folks are cooperating more completely in their efforts to avoid me and escape.
---
But realistically I don't see myself chasing down a single dude throughout the entire game no matter what he's in there doing.  "Teabagging?"  Why would I get mad at someone who's essentially just moving some pixels around on my screen in a certain way?  Don't really understand it.  Just a game, man.
---
It takes place 2 weeks after if i remember right..
---
The good old days when a brand new part on action button would complete the entire gen. Me and my friends finished 4 gens in 30 seconds
---
Honestly, I’d say only 10.6/10 wraiths
---
But don't crouch to little
---
Wait a girl. guys it's a girl. Hey hey. Wanna play DBD with me. We got one spit open. Hey hey a girl. Look guys. 
---
Also use 1/2 in the begin to slow it down
---
Now you are reaching 
---
Dedicated killer main and even I find you repulsive and childish 
---
But what her toes lookin like? Can Larry get a peek at them piggies? 
---
Her **thiccness** is overwhelming the trapster. 
---
why i read that using trapper voice from Samination
---
I bought TF2 when it released. Same with both L4Ds. 
---
**sips monster ultra zero**
---
I feel like they only put this in for the plague to chain puke them all
---
I never dash when survivors are doing gens or totems since theres a chance you can grab them.
---
Addons I mainly use the leather straps and either the last will or the blind mask.
---
Crowdette? 
---
SUPER HEALSSSSSS
---
Gonna use it after it’s updated since it won’t be broken anymore
---
He's so picky about fingers but look at his! That man has never seen a bar of soap and should be ashamed for making me feel bad that only one of mine is pretty enough. 
---
And the vicious cycle continues. 
---
~~And it will continue until Killers become the master race again~~
---
Yeah, but you don't have access to the damaging version often.
---
Plus good Survivors are gonna abuse the heck out of  loops to block your vom.
---
Yeah I'm disappointed by this as well, I've got at least 3 killers that I've intentional kept DH at T1 for having fun fucking around with surprise mori'ing
---
I can totally understand that and in cases like this I usually have to say it's the SWF group who killed that random anyways; after all they're just sacrificing that poor person.
---
But yeah I don't get it either. I mean, if it's excessive with constant flashlight spam (you know, that annoying click sound?) then yeah, at one point I'll get irked and chase down that guy to death. But even then I usually leave the hook because it's just stupid to rob someone of a game.
---
You seem like a chill person, so I really hope you'll have more fun matches than toxic ones in the future, TBH. Have a good one, m8.
---
Very nice! Got the proportions down to a tee!
---
uwu
---
Counterargument : Ruin is ok, DL and others needs to be buffed.
---
You are welcome.
---
She is thicc, but I don't like it like that :) Just imho 
---
y u bulli mi
---
I find it funny how you were like “okay sure” this games got so many toxic players on both sides 
---
She has an advantage during chases due to having a smaller height than other killers allowing her to have extra mind game potential at loopss
---
Crouching is very good for sneaking on survivors at the beginning of the match but I woudnt ambush without addons for it incase you miss the attack. I prefer to uncrouch. Uncrouching maintains your stealth for a few seconds which can allow for a grab or guranteed hit. 
---
Use your ambush in short loops and rapidly change direction. Its a mind game Ive seen done by Ardetha and Tru3, both of which have good examples of pig plays where they ambush and use the extended lunge to force a survivor to abandon the loop or get hit. 
---
The bear traps are excellent for slowing the game down while you hunt the other survivors. When a gen is completed, the survivors traps activate giving them 2.5 mins (depending on addons) to search through the jigsaw boxes. If they dont find the key they die. The big thing about the bear trap is that it auto kills survivors when they try to escape the exit gates making it powerful end game material. 
---
Survivor traps dont go off if they escape via trap door.
---
Perk wise I like whisperers which can allow me to identify which gen is best to ambush. I also like to combo monitor and abuse so that when whispers triggers I dont immediately alert the survivor of my presence. Most chasing based builds work like brutal strength and enduring. 
---
End game builds such as Noed, remember me and blood wardern is really strong on pig because of her traps. Surveillance can be great for maintaining pressure on gens and tracking survivor activity. Great if combined with Brutal for faster kicking of gens. 
---
You might find chasing harder to deal with as both huntress and legion dont usually get impacted terribly with pallets. Pig will allow you to get used to chasing survivors through pallet loops and practice mind games. You also have 115% movement speed which you will very much notice when comparing to both legion and huntress. 
---
Pig is a very good killer to pick up. Very versatile with both stealth and time increasing power.
---
Yeah...you do those math puzzles!
---
That’s probably who I’m thinking of
---
Height doesn’t apply to speed in any way. Some of the worlds tallest people can’t actually run at all. 
---
The main reason huntress is faster is due to the entity’s influence and power that he gave her. Same goes for every killer. 
---
If somebody dcs from a match the other players should keep their items/offerings, not be susceptible to depip, and the person who dced should not be able to queue up for like 30 min or something. 
---
It's like the foreign exchange student who just learned the word "bully" 
---
OKAY SO, UNPOPULAR OPINION
---
I FEEL LIKE THE NEW KILLER IS AMAZING FOR KILLERS AND LOOKS REALLY FUN TO PLAY, BUT I ALSO THINK THEY’RE TO OVERPOWERED AND COULD USE A MINOR NURF. NOT A BIG ONE THAT WILL MAKE HER FREDDY LEVELS OF BAD, BUT SOMETHING. MAYBE GIVING HER A SHORT COOL DOWN ON HER POWER OR HAVING TO ACTUALLY AIM IT? BECAUSE CURRENTLY IT HAS NO COOL DOWN AT ALL, PLUS YOU CAN JUST SPRAY WHEREVER AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS HITS THEM. IDK MAYBE IM JUST WEIRD OR SOMETHING, IT JUST SEEMS NOT THAT GREATLY BALANCED. AND I’M ALSO REALLY CONFLICTED ON SAYING THIS, BECAUSE I KNOW IM GONNA GET MOBBED.
---
ANYWAY, 
---
THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS?
---
You guys say things like NOED and BBQ are buffed. They aren’t buffed, they are just more effective at lower ranks. The inevitable tier 3, which is what most people have, is the exact same. 
---
Second, DS was a bull shit perk and you know it. Every toxic survivor used it and now these toxic fucks are screaming in agony their crutch is nerfed. 99% of my DCers seem to be DS users. Big surprise right?
---
Good, I hope all you toxic fucks quit the game. Go back to call of duty or wherever you came from.
---
The start of a destructive relationship
---
Yea if you want minimal infection
---
You need to walk right up on the target and give them the full load for near-instant exposed
---
I like that idea a lot. o.o
---
I just want David to have more/better cosmetics :(
---
ohhh miiii o.o
---
Hmmm.. possible, any clue who trapper could be loosely based on? 
---
works as intended
---
Wi-fi is a thing, lag switching is a thing
---
But more importantly steam went down for like 15 minutes around the time you posted this so that was just a coincidence 
---
Sometimes I get anxiety that someone will talk about me on their stream and I'll get targeted for it lol. I've seen a decent amount of streams and I try to only follow the ones who don't seem like dick weeds.
---
Most notably to me is the claudette face, which would be Jeff's profile XD
---
I play to have fun, I play decent nurse (Xbox) people seem to become brain dead when they actually get hit from a nurse. I find it funny the difference the killer makes to people
---
fedora man bad
---
The plague is weak. This not means nothing. This man can do a 4 man at rank 1 drunk and only with M1
---
That's Mrs Fairfield for you! 
---
Watch this: https://youtu.be/qnwdPlx9yR4
---
i feel the same way. it is almost unnoticeable at normal speed.
---
People do main him. Just like people main Legion for some odd reason.
---
me too. the spirit’s and the hag’s are always a pleasure to perform.
---
Don’t worry I got this
---
Maybe he's super into it and you never would've found out otherwise!
---
I still feel like they need to change the instaheal aspect, if you have the broken status effect at the very least you should still be injured after purifying.  She seems like a really fun killer already I'm just nervous about her having a high skill cap and I want to play her but I'm also a very casual gamer.
---
DIED RIGHT NEXT TO THE ESCAPE TRIGGER IN THE EXIT GATES FROM A PIG TRAP. QUARTER SECOND MORE AND I WOULD'VE ESCAPED. NEARLY UNINSTALLED.
---
Agreed 
---
I watched his stream today a bit.
---
Tru3: "Oh, these guys picked these perks, they definitely knew they are going against me as the Plague. Probably a snipe."
---
You literary are playing on PTB. OF COURSE everyone are playing as a Plague.
---
The other game was when when he faced the team on Mountain resort. Team was doing good and Tru3 was doing.... you know, not that good. Team was called obvious SWF, Balanced Landing was called overpowered, loops immediately became infinites and everything was against him, obviously. 
---
Every time survivors (any survivors) were doing moderately decent (not even good), they were called GODLIKE EU survivors, Tru3 wiped the sweat off his forehead and very passionately stated that he is going against best EU survivors and he must do his very best to beat them. From time to time he would yell in excitement while... performing a basic moonwalk or to get a lucky play and you can see how proud he is of himself.
---
I watch him for moments like this, to be honest. Sometimes it is a bit cringy, but mostly adorable. I have a little nephew, and from time to time they have cooking classes in school. He brings home burnt cookies and his first relatively complex dishes. His parents (and sometimes me) try them whenever he gives it to us. The look in his eyes and eyes of Tru3 is very similar at those moments. Cookies are not very good, but how would you ever reveal it to the little boy. Tru3 is the same. He does not need the truth, he does not want to hear or admit the truth, he just wants pats on the back and to hear people saying that he is making GODLIKE plays. I guess for each their own. 
---
On a side not, I am yet to see someone else's ego bigger than his. 
---
It does count the last gens, from what I've heard. Looked like a pretty fast buff when I tested it.
---
I would wager very, very strongly that he falls into the “doesn’t shower” category.
---
Oh god, Now i'm scared
---
And it makes perpetual poop 
---
yeah true it just feels nice to me to have a number by my name.  i know it doesnt mean much but dont you think it could hurt the game?  the que times at rank 1 are already terrible
---
They look like legion then
---
People drastically over exaggerate the frequency of uber coordinated 4 man SWF groups.
---
yeah but ive had multiple 4ks where ive not even safety pipped.  doesnt that seem a bit much
---
Yikes.
---
we need fingerguns
---
It really is. Play it and it's awful. I get 3 golds and I don't pip.
---
to poke trapper's ass obviously
---
Ironically the people I see who wear the neon outfits are often dedicated loopers trying to get attention so the killers don't notice the people doing gens.
---
Rank matters at low ranks. I would hate to be in Rank 15 again.
---
It still bugs me that he has no blood in his hair when Adam and Kate do.
---
Change that pistol to a water gun for how useful new DS is.
---
Is that what the obnoxiously loud sound I've been hearing is? Who thought that was a good idea?
---
Legion is only op when he moonwalks if he moonwalks and has bloodhound than gg
---
That’s my OPINION
---
But there's literally, in order, Clown, Meg, Adam, Jake, and Bill. Why would the mods remove this?
---
^(/s)
---
bulli boi gave you some solid advice, now let me share you some personal builds. They are not the most efficient, but are the ones I think gave me a lot of fun and are focused on stealth instead of chasing and are somewhat risky.
---
Whispers + Devour Hope + Nurse's Calling + Sloppy :: I've played a lot with this one before Legion came out. Whispers would let me know when I'm next to a Survivor, so I could play full-stealth Pig. Run while it's deactivated, crouch once it activates, so they never experience my TR until I'm actually chasing them. Whispers also helps in knowing when someone is trying to cleanse DH's totem without needing to come close to it and, now that it gives you a perma 5% speed boost, you get to be a super fast 120% Pig with a faster "crouched speed". Crouching allows you to see auras, so NC works wonders, especially with Sloppy since they will spend a lot of time trying to heal themselves. Keep them busy healing themselves as much as possible so they're pressured into either doing gens or healing only, take advantage of always knowing where they are, running while they're not around and crouching to approach the prey quietly and manipulate them into finding others or hooking them asap if they have self-care. If you can get to keep DH until you get Exposed, they will find themselves in a very tight spot.
---
Huge hint about ambushing: Remember that uncrouching is good for surprising survivors, NOT AMBUSHING. You got to a gen with a Surv? Don't ambush. Uncrouch. You get to attack just as fast, but you trade the speed boost with a LOUD warning for a much stealthier and quieter unsheathing of your blade while in normal speed. If you're in the beginning of the match, you can even get some gen grabs from Survivors that didn't spot a Jigsaw Box yet. ambush is a good tool for being offensive in loops and a poor (albeit very fun) tool for surprising Survs.
---
Surveillance + M&amp;A + BBQ/DH + Whispers :: I like to use this one now. DH and Whispers I've already explained, very fast piggy for good map pressure in the PTB. Now, M&amp;A and Surveillance... Surv is so good. It works wonderfully with Piggy, it's almost like free hits. Hit a gen, run away without crouching, they will think you're far off because M&amp;A is hiding you and come back to the gen, then if you see the gen turn yellow you crouch and come back. Free hit. Be more aggressive in chases with your ambush, if possible, so they won't think it's strange for you to crouch and disappear if you are mid-chase and a gen turned yellow. Also 3-gen strat is extremely doable with this one. If you get a 3-gen, they will never get to work on a gen without you allowing them to.
---
I'm very interested in trying Dark Devotion + Discordance + Nurse's Calling + Sloppy/Surveillance/Whispers. The changes in DS made me think that this could lead to the interesting, altho very situational, case where I can hit my Obssession (which can turn out to be more than one Surv in one trial, thanks DS) and then chase the other Surv without a TR.
---
I'm not sure about getting rid of the instaheal. It punishes her enough if she tunnels them to the fountain, but isn't overbearing enough that she's set back since she can then use the same fountain to just get ranged damage.
---
The overall fountain mechanic is actually really well done, seeming fair for both sides
---
Careful, last time somebody said a perk should work on a killed’s power because it works on doctor they fixed it by nerfing doctor. 
---
Huh, I might give it a shot then.
---
That’s because you’ll very rarely (less than 1%) find 4 SOLO survivors who know how to abuse the game. You’ll find 1-2 at max who are optimal. 
---
But in a real SWF, most can loop well, know the map layout, and juke well. That’s the problem. 
---
Playing killer made me hate survivors.
---
Playing survivor made me hate survivors even more.
---
Really doesn’t matter imo. A killer is meant to kill.
---
If I’m ever gonna let someone go it’s never going to be for hitting a 4% dice roll. I only let people go if another survivor DCs, we’re in a hatch stand off or farming/rituals
---
Machine gun Huntress is what every killer was basically like
---
I tunnel/proximity camp everybody so it doesn't matter. /s
---
the fact that the game used to be worse isn’t an excuse for it still being bad, even if improvements were made
---
Where is this rule written?
---
A: Amanda's Secret Sucks. B: If You See A Trapped Survivor Unless Their Timer Has Started Don't Ignore them. C: Jigsaws Annotated Plan &amp; Jigsaws Sketch Are Pretty Much Her Best Addons, Don't Use A Rule Set No. 2 If You Don't Have Either Of Them. D: Statistically Survs WILL Get Their Trap Of On First Box, The Odds Are Not In Your Favour. E: Don't Trap At 5 Gens Unless You've Downed Survs 3-4 Times. F: Patrol Boxes &amp; Gens
---
TLDR: \*Oink\*
---
Pretty much play both equally and i never felt an obligation to let them escape or demand the killer to let me escape. 
---
fuck that rule its not based on skill just luck
---
Dude, never call someone a hacker at a TEST BUILD, because test builds are for TEST, and this is a spawn glitch, it's happening a lot
---
It's not. It's just a general thing I've seen the community bring up and survivors complaining about in end of game chat. 
---
I can see where you’re heading.
---
As a killer main, I’d gladly go back. Hell, I look forward to rank resets
---
You make fair points. Especially with the fact that survivors are the same as far as perks go. I accept its just a quality of life change. But how about instead of them focusing on the perks that are already viable they focus on the ones that nobody would ever use unless they are meming. I get every perk cant be meta but at least make it so that the majority of these useless perks are useable 
---
It’s also a soft tell of where a survivor is, isn’t it? There’s no audio queue but if you see one light up it’s a giveaway there’s a survivor there. 
---
I respect the 4% if survivors in my match don't cleanse my hexes when I get a bad spawn.
---
A few weeks ago my friend found a way to get us to play 1.0 DBD... holy shit doesn't even beginning to describe it. I went to blood lodge on purpose and dear god... HOW WASN'T THIS GAME DOA? I give mad props to the devs for fixing a product that had no right to keep existing today
---
It was impossible to even come close to winning against a cheating killer during that time. 
---
Also i acknowledged survivors being busted. The majority of my comment was talking about how survivors were OP back then.
---
Don’t mind me asking, but what is the original format for this meme? Just curious, that’s all
---
I honor it by taking them to another hook. The first one was obviously faulty.
---
Ayy. I can tell she's gonna be the biggest waifu of the game.
---
Sorry Feng and Kate.
---
If this was the wow sub reddit, everything would have a post complaining about elemental shamans, demonology warlocks and shadow priests being underpowered tbh. Then again, I haven’t played in awhile soo who knows lmao.
---
Oh, sure. Then you'll have 6 matches where it's an empty perk slot.
---
It’s just a meme calm down
---
YOURE RIGHT, AND NOW THAT I'VE HAD A FULL 24 HOURS TO CALM DOWN, THERE WAS NEVER ANY NEED TO GET SO WORKED UP ABOUT THESE MORONS. I WAS JUST HAVING A ROUGH DAY AND THE SHIT-TALKING SORT OF PUSHED ME OVER THE EDGE.
---
gotta make sure people get quality hooks
---
These are very good changes, probably enough to the point that they'd work over a complete do-over (which Freddy doesn't need). Also nerf Adrenaline, Unbreakable, and Self Care (and No Mither, but who uses that?) to no longer give free wake ups. And Distortion and lockers (auras). Also make it so that Freddy's swipe no longer goes into awake survivors, and that Freddy can no longer go into the successful hit animation right as the dream transition ends but he doesn't actually get the hit so the survivor runs off like nothing happened, and he'd be good.
---
It has some use if you run it with quick and quiet.
---
Ironically they usually survive until the late game and are the only ones and if you need more gens done you won't hide long with blue or pink hair. 
---
Freddy actually works best if you don't tunnel.
---
How a shirt gonna come with titties?
---
With the right perks he can be fun to play. The Spirit Fury + Enduring combo really does a lot to improve basic attack killers.
---
And yet tombstone Myers gets to keep his still. Obviously the corrupt plague is more OP than a fucking INSTA-KILL...
---
Omg that’s fucking hilarious! I bet Mcote has PTSD after that day! 
---
