Playing killer is usually no fun at the high ranks. Rank 20 to rank 15 is quite fun most of the time and more balanced. Usually if you see for survivors load in at the same time I would skip them. Especially if they are bloody or decked out with items and stuff. Playing as killer is the best way to level up and make blood points though. I'd also recommend turning off post game chat or blocking the survivors if they talk shit. Win or lose expect them to gang up on you sometimes. But my best advice for playing killer is to dodge survive with friends groups. There's a small chance it's just friends having fun together but more than likely it's going to be a group that makes the match miserable for you. Solo survivors are much more respectful and usually more fun or forgiving

---
---
yes ! like "you'll see after my rework"
---
Knowing the direction the game is heading, its probably going to be battle pass exclusive.
---
how to delet someone's post
---
So about that crow....
---
Seems like the whole team was shit, considering two of them were doing jack-shit, crouched while the killer was already in a chase.
---
I recommend watching Monto on Youtube. He uplods ALOT of DBD videos mainly focused on perk builds &amp; he has a whole toxic killer series &amp; it's pretty cool. 
---

---
A toxic perk build he did for Legion was Bloodbound, Hex:Ruin, thanatophobia, &amp; Sloppybutcher &amp; for add ons he used iridescent button &amp; frank's mix tape.
---
I would say 6-7, but towards the end of being on pc I was getting 4‚Äôs and 5‚Äôs. I‚Äôm a basic ass Meg generally lmao
---
I know how it looks üòÖ. The other remaining survivor was seconds from dead on the other side of the map and I knew the trap door was nearby so I figured I‚Äôd have a better chance of surviving waiting the 20 seconds it took them to die. The crow genuinely showed up seconds before the clip began recording.
---
I deleted this post because of the unnecessary anxiety it caused. Please do not contact me about it unless you would like to see the original photo. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but please please understand I just wanted to share something happy.
---
He's the main character of the first game, and his son is the main character in the second. He kills himself or goes crazy in either of the endings of the first game, and his recordings are all over the second.
---
His power doesnt help in a chase, and while you can play him well, it takes a lot of know how and skill for a lesser reward than other hard killers.
---
I like playing as The Doctor or The Hag.
---
Bring yellow flashlight with no addons and killer wastes a perk.
---
BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring.
---
cool ill give em a try ty for the resoibse L(
---
awesome thanks
---
The main reason he is not as good at higher ranks is because
---
1. He needs to wait 7 (I think) seconds in a chase before he can hit a survivor
---
And
---
2. Survivors at higher ranks will instantly run to a gen or survivor after a chase and will break dream world making his ability to see survivors out of terror radius not work or once the survivor gets on hook dream world is broken
---
But more importantly it‚Äôs that his power not only doesn‚Äôt help in a chase but it actually takes away from the chase
---
DbD's gonna start re-queuing when the dedicated servers are out.
---
depends on your rank, freddy against rank 20 is one of the best killers since they don't know how to use windows or pallets effectively and they don't see you coming because you're invisible... but he's the worst against good survivors
---
If they were very very well hidden it could be a lot easier to find them because survivors know the qualifications of where they can be placed (looking out for more hidden away spots)
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Offerings for the hatch? 
---
I know some players will drop an item as a tribute to the killer in hopes of some mercy. It works sometimes. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
yeah, those flashlights have like no counter to them, especially purple flashlights
---
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH
---
I know that! But i tried it in-game as an actual perk icon and you can barely see anything :\\
---
Okay that's what I kinda though but never would have thought of that lol that is funny to me xD
---
There is no grievance on the survivor side. It's free. Like I said to another guy, 
---
"Hypothetically, let's just say you're not a good survivor. Okay, then all you have to do is run your two get out of jail free cards (Dead Hard and MoM) and then if you still suck and get hooked, just have deliverance and DS. Not only is that an automatic pull off the hook, that gives you 60 secs of invincibility bc no matter what you do, if the killer catches you in 60 secs, you're free. AND that is on top of you getting your replinished dead hard from getting unhooked. It's literally so free as a survivor that you can run no mither and still escape and rank up. I know bc I have done it as a survivor main."
---
you have maps in your favor, comms, swf, safe loops that killers must break to lose their bloodlust and continue chase, and stupid ass nerfs that don't do shit. Seriously, I love how they nerf DS (which wasn't even a nerf bc now you get 60 secs of invincibility. Still needed tho bc of tunneling) but then they're going to put MoM in the game. Oh okay lol. Just run your insta heals, MoMs, DH, Delieverance, DS, and that kind of stuff and you'll do fine. Yes, I know killers have those things too like Moris, iri hatchets, NOED, etc. Those should be out of the game.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;blind survivor  
---
&gt; with a cane that can reveal the hunter to everyone for a few seconds and is able to see him through walls by default with the disadvantage that everything around you (except nearby pallets) is dark and can only be seen with the sound waves your cane makes while you walk/run. You're completely blind while crouching
---
an interesting point, however identity v and dbd work together so I wouldn't say ripoff
---
*gasp*
---
How could you place my precious trapper so low?
---
^this shit right here
---
Now, they only have to work on gens to find them. Why would they ever do that?
---
I understand what you're saying, but every game will eventually have players learn spawn points. That's not a reason to not improve them when they affect the game.
---
I didn't give you permission to post pictures of me.
---
They made you lose 4000 Bloodpoints #Value!
---
Well....then you get destroyed 30 seconds later
---
There's just a slight difference: Hiding in lockers to counter a tombstone is a intended way of countering it, trapping a survivor in order to tombstone him on the other hand is exploiting the hitboxes to bodyblock. Which is very reportable
---
It‚Äôs honestly the most wholesome thing when it works. üòç
---
&gt;"Her not being able to hear anything due to the game not working pretty often doesn't change anything about her being able to hear you or not."

[Meg be like...](https://pics.me.me/when-you-accidentally-say-t-gay-please-dont-kill-me-im-55086210.png)
---
A part of me has always wondered if the original killers would get new moris because compared to practically every other mori, trappers is kinda sad..
---
ok which one of you made this
---
Nothing tilts me more than stuff like this, tbh. I hate when I get a down, and they just spring back up immediately after the recover animation starts playing. Even worse if I've been playing a slug build, and three survivors pop up in a tight little bundle, and the last person heals to full. And then they all heal each other before running off.
---
Nobody's fault but my own for not killing them earlier, but I'll be honest. It feels like you can't win against survivors sometimes, since they'll just accuse you of tunneling or camping if you try to actually confirm kills.
---
True, the most frustrating part is, with the greatly diminished # of pallets and the weird algorithm that likes to spawn them on one side of the map, a survivor just pallet spamming away.
---
Any completed gens being undone is arguably even more absurd then the reduced speed. 
---
Imagine having to go from 1 gen to escape all the way back to 5, but now with one less player. That'd be the most frustrating killer perk out there.
---
I get the feeling it‚Äôs swamp idk why
---
We have no way of knowing. Prob not though
---
ive always wanted to try her but i never had the skill to haha i will start watching some guides and hopefully improve my spirit game ty ;p
---
How does it even work lol like do they just guide you to the hatch?? How do you offer something before they kill you??
---
I prefer killer, and sure it can be annoying at times.. but it‚Äôs when you do really well that makes it worthwhile imo.
---
You don‚Äôt even have to win to have a good time, if you out play a survivor it can be super satisfying.
---
&gt;I love how they nerf DS (which wasn't even a nerf bc now you get 60 secs of invincibility. Still needed tho bc of tunneling)
---
Do you not understand where old decisive was? Where if you were the obsession you could just stab right on off after the first grab? What Happened to decisive was a rework, not a flat nerf. It was a nerf for the obsession but a buff for the non-obsession. But overall it was a net nerf. And in fact the rework was so fucking bad it needed buffed a patch later. 
---
&gt;Oh okay lol. Just run your insta heals, MoMs, DH, Delieverance, DS, and that kind of stuff and you'll do fine.
---
The only BS there is MoM. Deliverance isn't a god tier perk. It has downsides and requires you to not be the first one hooked. 
---
&gt;Yes, I know killers have those things too like Moris, iri hatchets, NOED, etc. Those should be out of the game.
---
What I literally said was "when Surviviors complain about that shit they are met with downvotes, insults, and hate." yet my issue is, why is it all the Survivior crutch shit is getting nerfed but crutch shit for killers doesn't? Remember when Iridescent head was indirectly nerfed by the infantry belt nerf? Remember how Tyde Thyme lost his ever loving mind about that? Or NOED, a perk that only bad killers run, is always met with "git gud" or "jUsT rUn SmAlL gAmE". Or Moris? A no counterplay shitter of an offering? Come the fuck on dude. I main Nurse so take my opinion on what's OP with a grain of salt (even tho I'm the first to tell you she's OP), but Moris are the epitome of overpowered. 
---
But why is it when Surviviors say that,they're met with hate. Is it bc they're full of shit or is it bc the killer playerbase is sadly full of entitled shitheads. 
---
Gee idk. Considering we have Tyde Thyme and his circle jerk fanbase calling people who don't think Hag is D tier retarded, I think it's the latter.
---
This is what you miss when you don‚Äôt sort by new
---
Idk if this would work, but you can get an assassins creed blade prop off of amazon for 12$ it‚Äôs basically the same thing. Plus it would be under the sleeve I‚Äôd imagine.
---
Hope this helps, sorry if it doesn‚Äôt!
---
Noed and ruin , yes Can confirm it
---
Blind survivors? Forget that, you could actually look for Blendettes better.
---
YOURE THE HERO THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS

Cause of death: Squadette

Alright there, Ted Bundy...

You drop the item. And usually they'll knock you down and carry you to the hatch, and then just drop you on top of it.
---
you counter it by not bring items, EZ

---
I am the manger would ruin dbd. Killers would never be able to cut off or mind game survivors as you would always see the killers aura on every loop.
---
I only got the game recently but I have been following DBD for quite a while now, and it seems that for most people the real reward/goal is to farm bloodpoints. With that in mind, I‚Äôm more inclined to agree with you, because doing nothing all game and exit through the hatch is way less rewarding than completing objectives.

---
With Freddy being reworked, he's probably gonna be up there with Myers.
---
How is coordination gonna stop the hunter from just shoot the scavengers, haven't played the game so I don't know it's mechanics, but hunter seems very easy to play
---
Yes
---
There was a temporary ‚ÄúRift‚Äù that would be like a seasonal battle pass gig and the archive would be the permanent progression towards X cosmetics I believe
---
Lol you suggested something and someone disagreed, no one insulted you,  and for some reason that makes the community toxic and unwelcoming?
---
The Mori is a reward from the entity, lore-wise. For being a good little killer, the Entity lets you sometimes kill someone yourself. But there is one killer that can kill you instantly where you stand, without hooking you once, without downing you once, without even hitting you once. He doesn't give a rats ass what the Entity wants. He is pure evil, the man, the myth, the legend, Michael Myers.
---
It's basically just juking, something some people in dbd have warned for a long time instead of the core game mechanics being looping, seems like a win win, everyone gets what they want.
---
I declare this fat dude the new face of dead by daylight
---
Sometimes when I play killer my internet just kicks me off and I get to no network connection
---
Uncensor the redditor
---
Open handed is fine as is imo
---
Why did you block his name out. He‚Äôs a hero
---
Please tell me what possessed you to post this
---
Yep
---
A while ago I played Doc for the first time in months and forgot I had NOED on, I was closing in on a survivor at the end and their Adrenaline popped, so I just kept chasing and they lead me to their other two remaining teammates and I ended up downing them all at the exit gate
---
They all messaged me afterwards to call me a baby killer and tell me I'm a scrub for using NOED and blah blah blah. They were at least a 3 man SWF all running Adrenaline, Dead Hard, insta-heals, etc.
---
Where the fuck did I ever call locker jukes unfair? I said you're a dick if you do it only to deny the Tombstone with no hope of escape. And you are. I never said it was unfair to do it as a method of escape. Stop trying to fucking strawman.
---
Before the Endgame Collapse was implemented you would've lost as soon as you were all slugged. The EGC is meant to put an end to hatch standoffs and people stalling matches as long as possible
---
It doesn't look like he has Bond. Maybe it was just an accident. Unless he was using another teammates Kindred?
---
Same but I do that with feng lol
---
Number 15: Burger King Myers.
---
So extremely off topic, but I'm going through the "shredding" progress for the first time in my life. You obviously have pretty hard, as your abs are that distinct. Now I'd seriously LOVE if you have me all of the advice you to could to getting those. I don't trust online that much. Thank you by the way
---
Did you misstate in your first post? The thing you linked says the exact opposite of what you're saying, as does the text you copied.
---
It was broken for a little while after Plague's release. Pretty sure they hotfixed it a week later.
---
‚Äîan actual clown
---
oh
---
Survivor dcing actually does hurt the killer. And people dc because there is no punishment
---
I've never liked him. He gets too mad and dumb things and fights too much with people in chat
---
It‚Äôs the Shrine of Secrets in the store. Every week, 4 new teachables (2 for survivors, 2 for killers) are available to purchase with iridescent shards. Bloodpoints are awarded for perks you purchase with iridescent shards if you already own the teachable.
---
It indicates,that you are now working like 1 1/2 survivor,instead of 2 full ones. Its kind of a nerf,but you are still doing gen faster than alone.
---
As Survivor I see killers lunging long after I vaulted or swinging like the pallets not even there. As Killer i get alot of hitmarkers when I clearly missed them.
---
You're right, you did say it was dickish which is equally fucking stupid if you don't believe body blocking someone is.
---
excuse me? ü§ß

*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES IN SURVIVOR*

SO CARL‚ÄôS LIFE IS BASICALLY WORTH 3 BUCKS TO YOU????

WHY DONT YOU TURN AND TWIST THAT BLADE SOME MORE!
---
Again, this does but a smile on my face
---
I think it's a good idea, if the killer can have an ebony mori this isn't any worse, in fact maybe we could replace ebony moris WITH this
---
Dude I literally posted the exact same thing a couple hours ago with Claudette. 119/120. I swear this shit is rigged
---
all im going to say to the killer part is: yes.

It means you got a kid and half of all your paychecks are going towards child support

Honestly the entitiy fits in well with Lovecraft style creatures as they are not inherently "evil". They just do shit to do shit. The migos would pop into our reality pluck a few people and poke their brains just to see how they worked (which the experience drove the subjects to maddness) but they didn't do it will malice, just curiosity.
---
This is a cursed image

Fuckable?
---
i mean iirc most of them weren't even bad people, they just had something happen to them that pushed them over the edge
---
I once had my antivirus software pop up, tab me out of the game and killed me struggling on hook
---
Haha üòÇ
---
I only get mad at Pigs who tunnel Survivors in RBTs, and only because it's an insanely stupid way to play one of my favorite Killers.
---
I like him but recently been taking a break from him because of this.
---
Also, he‚Äôs taken up yelling/singing a lot more recently(especially when playing survivor) which makes his accent really annoying.
---
And he‚Äôs like a broken record when he says certain things and acts like he‚Äôs the only person that has the ideas he says.
---
Remember me sucks now, why can't the devs have a little more grace before destroying people's favorite perks
---
Shhhhhh don‚Äôt ruin the fun

I‚Äôm gonna have to be that one guy and actually explain it.
---
Calling someone ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äô isn‚Äôt exclusive to DbD. It‚Äôs a term people use for a sexual partner who is the dominant, like a ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô. They‚Äôre memeing by making their names ‚ÄòMori me Daddy‚Äô or something

God part of my soul withered explaining that

I know, right?

I wonder sometimes.

Adam is like ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt %#&amp;$ing send me back out there.‚Äù ):

Wow, he's a fucking loser then.

No need to be agro amigo was just a question

I think it might be because it came off as sarcasm? That‚Äôs just a guess

I'll check soon tyty

totally agree.

Looks like citizen from Half Life 2 for me

i personally run make your choice, thrill of the hunt, nurses calling, and either devour or ruin. works pretty well for me.

I was thinking about this the other day, but mostly as just a thought. I couldn't come to with any neat abilities or anything.

Well your answer will come in a few months once we get more lore.

I‚Äôm just excited to possibly see a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doctor doing what he did before being pulled in.
---
Small Game is fine
---
It did, though. They added a huge bar up at the top when it‚Äôs open that once it gets down to under 1/4 Bloodwarden says ‚Äúyou should have left 2 mins ago, why didn‚Äôt you leave out of the open gate?‚Äù
---
Body blocking them to hold the game hostage? Abso-fucking-lutely. Body blocking to activate your Tombstone? Fuck no. Context is important when you're not a hypocrite, FYI.
---
Im not angry
---
And this is my awnser
---
That's lit
---
It's based on points.
---
Idk if its a mobile device but it runs pretty smooth on thr video, and also you will need an expensive phone to play that
---
Sometimes they lead the killer to you on accident. The amount of times I get hate mail from other survivors thinking I purposely lead the killer to a jungle gym or generator is getting problematic.
---
oinker?
---
Using shrine for perks: I sleep
---
Using shrine for BP:  REAL SHIT
---
If they dont make it free no one would play it probably, you already need a good phone to run it and finding out ur phone cant run it after u buy it is very sad
---
How am I their sexual partner after the game though? "gg daddy"
---
Trapper is way better than leatherface dude, not even close
---
Was this entire thing not childish though? I mean really
---
Nah fam, you run Franklin's when you see a group with items. Waste of a slot if they don't have anything on them.
---
When you misspelt a word in title and can‚Äôt correct it.
---
No, you can get every perk for every character as long as you unlock the teachable perk from the original character. Best perks are kind of an opinion, it also depends what kind of player you are, stealthy or really aggressive in your face. Also, are you a killer or survivor main/player?

One could say you sometimes Monitor surivors... And sometimes abuse them.

Intentionally left out the part where you become a snarky cunt in the post game chat and yet act like "oh poor me why is he mad". He wasnt wrong with his assessment of you lol
---
That's the same thing everyone else was saying. Seems we were all just disagreeing over how to word the same thing.
---
thanks!!
---
Survivor, im nea karlson, she is all i play but i have lots of perks on her? I thought she only has 3 teachable?
---
I can send you the full vod with time and everything, the only thing i typed was the thing you see in the video, but guess again.
---
I don't get why he gets mad when people tease him about SWF????   He should just own it like he owned fookin deadhard
---
‚ÄúYou gotta pay the troll toll if you want to get into that boys hole‚Äù
---
Just throw the whole thread out.
---
An exploit isn‚Äôt a counter dumb bitch.
---
I'm tired of people making this meme argument about clown, clowns "slowdown" is for a microsecond and it's barely anything, it's so irrelevant I don't even know if it's real. And it does not "counteract" his entire power, that's so ridiculous, his power gives a 15 percent debuff to survivors for multiple seconds if they touch his cloud at ALL, that's not even counting if they're just running in the cloud, which stays there for a while might I add.
---
[What it does.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Tuft_Of_Hair) It's basically an infinite NoeD, all game. Only caveat is that it takes forever to charge.
---
Only if you put traps in bad places lol
---
That is a swf squad. (Survive With Friends). The best advice I can give you about this is to expect a loss if the group is organized. There isn't really much you can do about swf squads if they are efficient and have good game knowledge. Just take the L and move on.
---
What??
---
they gotta add nightman as the killer
---
You were being a cunt from those 2 comments alone, if you dont understand that then unfortunately you're socially inept and I cant help you with that over reddit. Maybe stay outta that porn DBD you post in and you'll have your head more straightened out
---
This is a known bug, and they said they plan to fix it with the next update.
---
As a note, you can retain all your rewards from that game by disconnecting from the internet, and then reconnecting once you get to the results screen. This should reward you with everything besides that last sacrifice, as if the game had ended normally.
---
for me it‚Äôs 5pm on tuesday

If you like his aesthetic go for it
---
The one think he has going for him his that he‚Äôs arrogant and has past war exp that would maybe help with someone like trappers traps but when it comes down to a scrap he‚Äôs out powered

Endgame collapse is fine.  It certainly beats the hatch stand-offs before.
---
Oh? For Identity V or Dead by Daylight? Either way, that'll be a cool feature!
---
 "the action of furtively trying to find out something, especially information about someone's private affairs."
---
Taken from the dictionary, nice try again tho.

Yeah it sucks. Good thing is that it‚Äôs double blood points soon

Hey, dumbass, do you know what furtive means? Google it really quick, I'll wait.
---
‚ÄúYoU dIDnT kiLl Me So I WoN‚Äù
---
I almost pity the people who say things like that unironically..
---
DC‚Äôing for any reason other than hacks, exploits, or real life obligation screws over everyone else in the match and displays nothing but poor sportsmanship
---
You‚Äôre the same bitch killer that gets mad when a SWF Group body blocks you from hook then. Salty af in post game chat too breh. Don‚Äôt talk to me about hypocrisy either.
---
Why would you walk instead of run when you got hit
---
Agreed. But you‚Äôre preaching to the choir. The Lead Community manager is a moron. She literally got her job by streaming the game when it first game out. And she likes to make comments like, ‚Äúhaha I can hear the survivor mains complaining, ‚ÄúTHATS TOO OP!‚Äù It‚Äôs her job morn than anyone to listen community feedback and relay to the proper dev team and it really doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs done much.
---
Yeah ruin is a good hex to have since it stops gen rushing. I think there should be more tutorial videos on YouTube that cover overall good survivor/killer perks and good items/add ons to have.
---
Doc did it for the torture. Not to be a good guy.
---
Doc was a cruel and sadistic man using his victims to further his discovery in controlling the mind with pain and suffering 
---
Sure he did it for his bosses who needed it for a good deed,  but Doc wasn't in any way a good human being
---
wHaT is that
---
&gt;Almost all hunters run Detention \[NOED\] because they 100% have to.
---
Almost every (high-tier) survivor runs Borrowed Time (Adrenaline), Broken Windows (Lithe), and Tide Turner (Borrowed Time), in every match.
---
Yes, it has some balancing problems, but so does DBD. Both have "meta" characters, although in DBD it only applies to killers since survivors are just skins. 
---
Mercenary is a guaranteed save, but that is the entire point of his character. He can't cipher rush and once he gets downed from a save, it's difficult for him to get back up again. Perfumer, nothing to say much there, her item is powerful if it is played right and the hunter isn't able to quickly injure her in the cooldown. But you just need to learn when to stop wasting your time. There is a teleport trait for hunters that allows them to travel across the map to any cipher  to quickly switch targets to more vulnerable characters, such as the Mechanic. 
---
I do agree that they should add something like addons to the game to spice things up though.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Without blocking the person in a corner, YOU WOULD HAVE A CHANCE. Just like like how I explained earlier, but you obviously lack a memory as well as brain cells. You are a hypocrite as well as illogical.
---
That's hot
---
It's sad

Not bloodpoints, emblem points. If you mouse over your emblems it'll give you a point breakdown and you can see exactly  why it is that you didn't rank up.
---
More like:
---
"I would rather die than let you kill me!"
---
**Loses all blood points
---
I got Escape points every time

Billy is probably the most balanced killer in the game unironically

Left stick is move, right stick is look. If you're running forward, the left stick should be up. Keep holding it up and wheel the right stick/camera around until the camera pans to look behind you.
---
That‚Äôs a Bloody Party Streamers offering. It gives everyone in the match double Blood Points! You can stack them if more than one person brings them into a match, as well.

Ring spirit when?

Certified bruh moment

You can hear it. In fact, breathing is also louder. Theres also a perk that notifies when someone goes in a locker.

Guess that Plague wasn‚Äôt listening out then.

Sounds like he earned that lol
---
Its a good thing we‚Äôre not friends bc I would smash that on the floor
---
Yeah I wasn't sure about Breaktime, I just wanted a perk that made you really slow like a fat guy lol. I like your idea better for Extra Shift though.
---
Haters gonna hate. Good percentage of people can‚Äôt even draw good stick figures. It‚Äôs cute, OP.

There needs to be a significant penalty for not cleansing. I wouldn't even mind Corrupt being a shorter duration if the power had even a little bit of stall
---
I love how all you negative assholes downvoted my comment when it‚Äôs the main perk I use üòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs broken. So survivors have to pretty much ditch everyone else in the match at ANY POINT once the end game starts to escape? So let‚Äôs pretty much remove the chance of getting and iridescent or gold in altruism because they shouldn‚Äôt save others when the end game starts?
---
And MOM, and DS are OP lololol paaallleeaaasee

Oh bad cough there my friend. It speaks truth though.

[Literally just googled the comment lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b5ns20/credit_idea_billmurrie/)

You gave me a what if scenario and I responded to that what if scenario. You are now saying many more what if scenarios. Here is where you and I differ and it is why we severely disagree, you say it‚Äôs easy to run the killer around it‚Äôs not even funny, I say yea it is, when I play survivor it is. When I play killer it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to run me around. Our skill level is clearly different, so of course we won‚Äôt agree about this. Now you are saying deliverance and DS are an instant get off the hook and a guaranteed second chance, where do you get that from? If you‚Äôre first downed and hooked your deliverance is over, completely wasted and it‚Äôs wasted if you don‚Äôt get a safe unhook. DS, you have to successfully hit a skill check but also you are dependent on the killer finding you within 60 seconds. If you decide to tunnel a survivor (understandable if you didn‚Äôt see the other one) then that‚Äôs on you, you are giving them that opportunity to escape again. Dead hard, you struggle with dead hard? Then I can‚Äôt help you there. That‚Äôs the easiest perk to counter. Mettle of man, that buys them like 5 seconds of time. That‚Äôs hardly a powerful perk. And you get something out of it too!
---
All killers agree about haddonfield do they? You just said you‚Äôre a survivor main and it‚Äôs clear to see you‚Äôre a bad killer. I‚Äôm a killer main and I‚Äôm also another player and I disagree so where‚Äôd you get that ‚Äúall‚Äù from? And you said another what if scenario! You‚Äôre the one presenting them and then I‚Äôm not allowed to respond with the same what if responses? Survivors are the ones who dislike Haddonfield more mostly because if you burn the offering and find a Myers, wraith, or spirit, no one wants to play that coz it‚Äôs genuinely scary and also difficult. And it‚Äôs situational that you even get the opportunity to use your balanced landing (just like on every map) and if you encounter an insta down killer then you may not make it to a window. Also clown is a pain in the ass on that map, legion is even more of a pain in the ass for multiple reasons too.
---
Why would you waste a perfectly good perk spot with a perk that can be rendered useless instantly.
---
Neat. Now I can rewatch myself pulling down pallets on the wrong side lol. There's lots of little QOL features in Identity V that I like a lot, such as being able to view data for past matches, seeing my win rate (split by character even), an escape button if you get stuck, and Just Desserts for people exploiting unreachable places. Wish DBD would implement some of them. The game has its problems, but it's way better than my initial impression of it as a "Chinese DBD knockoff".

Not entirely true. A bunch of killers accepted the call of the Entity, like Spirit and Hag. Some needed to be compelled, I'd argue Wraith is an example of this since he never wanted to kill anyone, and only killed Azerov bc of what he made him. 
---
But Spirit, Hag, Micheal, Freddy, Clown, they all definitely accepted the call
---
Oh damn, link it to me. Thats kind of cool.
---
Also, I did come up with perks for both Survivor and Killer but I didn't include them because I didn't want to put too much in. Maybe I'll redo this later though and attach them. 
---
The range for the explosion was 4 meters but I think the range for the throw itself would be similar to the clown (maybe a bit heavier, possibly having a rolling motion to it).
---
Triggering MoM should just permanently block the hatch for you
---
What DBD needs is an Escape button/Just Desserts for sure.
---
Thanks lol. Sprint Burst can be a nuisance to some people, so I included the change.

My inner killer main is so salty right now. Why you no slug! Why you no slug!

Lmfao!
---
I liked the idea of them sticking but I also want survivors to be able to interact with them. Which is more reasonable when they're on the ground. It was the one big flaw of my idea imo.
---
I like your perks though, mostly the survivor ones. Some seem kind of "keyboard smashing" or toxic like "1 hit hero". I can only imagine some claudette t-baging the exit gates just to show you she can stand the extra swing. But you also had a lot of more art.
---
Though our powers aren't really comparable, mainly because yours seems to be built for dealing with issues directly in The Lost Spirits path and The Dutchman has an area denial tool that could be used to mindgame loops.
---
i know!! i watched it all happen and i felt awful lol
---
As others said, the analog sticks. It certainly takes practice though to do efficiently. Taking your time to better learn the map layouts will make a world of difference in the future for you. A good place to practice is the cornfield since it‚Äôs mostly wide open.
---
THAT is incorrect. 6000 deviousness is more than most m1 killers get in a average game
---
There are a numerous amount of perks to give the Exposed status effect. It could have been Devour Hope if it was a Hag

Thank you for sacrificing karma for making me laugh

There‚Äôs no perk that makes the Wraith‚Äôs Bell silent, only the one ultra-rare add-on. He was probably either laggy enough to the point where it messed up sounds or sounds were buggy for the match. I couldn‚Äôt see a reason why somebody would change just wraith‚Äôs bell sound.
---
[Look at the schedule](https://i.imgur.com/GlCCALX.png)
---
I mean it might but that would be insane. Take pig. You get 500 per trap and 100 per dash attack. That's 2000 plus maybe 500 more from dashes. If it is like that it would be a bloody nightmare on killers that arent doc huntress nurse etc.
---
So, what makes him the saltiest ever, besides the fact that he was hardcore gunning for this guy after he took out the Ruin he spawned right next to (BHVR, thought that wasn't supposed to happen anymore, btw?)?
---
This was a Rank 2 Killer, who was running an Ebony Mori no less. You'll notice at about 2 minutes into the clip there, he downs him again after we got him off the hook. And he keeps swinging at him for some reason. I'm not sure if the game was glitching, or he was just so pissed he couldn't hold the button properly or what, but...yeah. He doesn't mori him, eventually picking him back up. 
---
And then proceeds to chase him the entire match, blatantly ignoring the rest of us, in plain view no less. 
---
Unfortunately one of the other two, for some reason, actually went down in the basement at the end there to save poor Dwight and feed this toxicity. And yes, the one at the end of the clip running towards the gate did get out just fine.
---
A couple days ago I had a meg teammate who had green medkit with both insta addons, dumbass

*why can't weeee be friends*

---
I keep bringing it up but abiut a year or more ago there was this long, whiney ass rant by a redditor about telling other DBD players to stop asking for/expecting/joking about a killer that looks and acts like a Survivor. And sure enough Legion came out, for some CRAZY reason everyone forgot. I did not. I still can't find that post.
---
According to the wiki Deviousness/Gatekeeping is tied to generators, so you might be thinking about Hunting/Chaser
---
It was already changed. It now is 75% instead of 25%(if i remember correctly). If the killer camps the hatch instead of closing it, this perk would be useful.
---
Honestly, I really wish it does. I wish Left Behind did something where it was like Hope, but it only activated when you are the last one alive, and stays indefinite.
---
So could a skill check screw you over if it appears as soon as you are about to press space?
---
Make Your Choice is a popular perk on Hag.
---
I can be yuor ankle or ur driblle
---
Im pretty sure thats a perk.
---
danny deleto
---
The only killers with insta down ADD-ONS are Micheal Myers, The Huntress, The Clown, &amp; technically The Trapper but it's only for his traps. 
---
Any other player is most likly using Devour Hope.
---
Yea you are right, my pirate killer works like a hillbilly+huntress while yours is like a clown+trapper
---
But nonetheless we both got awesome ideas and hopefully one day we get a pirate killer in the game
---
all i see is feng min with a bun
---
don't bother, in the eyes of most people on this reddit they can't fathom any other reason a survivor would want to stick around during End Game other than to teabag.
---
Should make a "Cowabunga it is" version
---
Did you murdered them? Did you touch them in a bad spot with Killer? Can honestly say I've not seen that kind of hatred so far. You must have really pissed them off somehow.
---
All I can tell you is to keep playing. I watch Ochido's videos too &amp; they've helped alot with escaping a chase. Also perks that can help with escaping also. I recommend watching Monto on youtube if you don't already. That's the best channel to watch for perk builds.
---
Yah they do that shit all the tome and thinking is a SWF when we all load in together and it‚Äôs 100%random most games but I keep telling myself allot of little kids play on PS4 and don‚Äôt read any of the devs post or peoples post on how we load in together sometimes. I‚Äôm rank 6 and wait times have been 10-15mins for survivors, rank 7 killer and I keep getting rank 13-15 survivors
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Current Freddy
---
Genuine question: How long you been playing for?
---
Not gonna fight on some somewhat opinion based choices but there is no way LF is better then Wraith, at least Wraith can move around the map fast, he has a mind game potential, built in insidious (if you‚Äôre gonna be a dick) and he doesn‚Äôt have a bright yellow apron meaning he isn‚Äôt spotted from a mile away...
---
A lot of other things is just opinion based but it might just be me in denial that Huntress isn‚Äôt that great because I main her, Hag and the Nurse, Myers is typically my 4th pick, I just see him as easy 4k‚Äôs that take no effort similar to Hillbilly but I‚Äôm on console so that might be a bit different on PC where the survivors actually have a brain
---
I see.
---
Not a Killer main, don't do salt over a match. But go ob, keep revealing your lack of actual argument.
---
I remember the Dwight, he looks fine, never paid attention to Jake tho lol
---
I was playing survivor, wasn‚Äôt toxic (unless 2 360‚Äôs are Toxic) and had good chases and did gens. Was a twenty minute game. He hooked everyone twice. And got a bunch of trapped survivors (forgot to mention he was trapper) everyone escaped. After the game I sent the ggwp and then BAM
---
 No trapper S tier
---
hmmmm, myers hould be on B, freddy on D, clow on C and pig on C

All DC‚Äôs should be a black/safety pip. For killer and Survivor

&gt;You're dumb as hell.

I'm dumb as hell? Remind me which of us is going on about a hatch that doesn't exist? I've already specified I'm talking about a scenario where escaping is *literally fucking impossible* on more than one occasion. JFC.

Probably one of those Killers who thinks everyone escaping is a loss and becomes emotionally crippled when it happens.

My wired mouse shit itself right at the start of an Apex match. Don't know what happened.

Hahahaha I'm sorry, but the spelling

you forgot to add 76 to represent this game's many glitches.

Really? I don't mind Haddonfield as Killer. Bit annoying, sure.

Coldwind Farm Rotten Fields on the other hand, that map can burn in hell when I'm Killer.

You're allowed to use absolutely whatever you want, if it's been put into the game.

This sounds like it should have been implemented already especially with as many DC's as you get.

Please for the love of GOD, delete this.

Imagine if ur repair speed was 100% and if someone joins u, u both go down to 75% speed. Ur both repairing slower than you would as individuals, but the decrease isn't so significant that the combined effort of you both doesn't outweigh it

Ted Bundy actually had a huge fascination with dead women and was a necrophiliac. He spoke about it himself in interviews once or twice and his ex girlfriend reported that when they slept together he‚Äôd ask her to not move or make a noise and pretend she was sleeping. Dude was all sorts of crazy.

I've played on console, but made my move to PC recently and have no dlc yet so I thought what the heck lol

I agree, but I constantly get shit on for using what I want, so I feel like I'm doing something wrong. When I was newer at the game, I used NoeD but I got shit on so I felt like I had to stop using it. Now that I unlocked Rancor, I thought I'd check it out, but apparently I can't use that either.
---
I'm just really frustrated. Like the survivors will say "sure, Facecamping is in the game" but that's a dick move. So how far are all these dick moves? What is considered a dick move? This is getting too hard to keep track of. I feel like I shouldn't use any perks again.

&gt;"Ghost Face launches June 18th on all platforms. Be sure to tune into the Third Anniversary Stream this Friday for the full reveal."

That end game chat must have been beautiful
---
I know it's frustrating. But a lot of survivors aren't going to refrain from taking flashlights, Mettle of Man, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, or a bunch of other things that are going to be upsetting for the killer to go against. As long as you don't play like a dick with whatever you bring (tunneling, i.e.), then I say use whatever you want in good conscience, and just prepare for potential salt. You could run no perks and no add ons and if you play well against someone that has a stick up their ass, they're going to find something to ridicule you about anyways.

Save it for r/dbdgonewild
---
A lot of wrong information in the comments. For every extra person on the generator you repair at -10% speed. 2 survivors mean you‚Äôre both repairing at 90% efficiency, so 180% total. 2 people working on a generator from start to finish can complete it in 44 seconds with no great skill checks or toolboxes. 4 survivors doing 1 generator means each person is repairing at 70% of their normal speed, so 280% efficiency total.
---

Pizzeria would be too small, fmaf is cringy, we dont need more 12 years old children, r34 would explote for one animatronic, the yellow one, and the game would be sad

The power is too complex - why would survivors need a hall pass. And to open an iron desk, survivors require a teacher's key. This is not realistic as this is a fast-paced game with a lot of chasing.

I literally just did that, just to see what would happen.

[This was my backlash](https://i.imgur.com/dKgnroU.png). I used NO perks, NO add-ons, and when I hooked somebody I ran to the opposite side of the map. And I avoided everybody I ahd previously hooked to avoid tunneling.  Apparently I'm a baby killer and they just feel bad for me. There is literally no winning.

We get a new chapter every 3 months which includes a killer. It also usually includes a survivor and map.

Dont use ruin on Spirit. Never used it even at red ranks. Shes hella easy and OP so use a more fun perk. Pop the weasel is great for slowing gens down since she can get from gen to gen quickly.  Bbq is very strong on her, nurses calling is another I like to use.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I was about 40 seconds off. And to be fair, this footage was from a month or so when I just got the game and was still terrified of facing the killer. I‚Äôll admit I was a bit cowardly by hiding for a short while üòÖ

My point exact. I have a bit over 3K hours in the game and it's just something I've had to come to terms with. Do your best to play with other peoples interest in mind, as far as tactics in the game go. Who you chase, when, why, etc. Try not to camp or tunnel. Play with whatever perks and add-ons you'd like, try to play in a respectful way, and try not to take to heart any of the shitty things they say in post-chat.

you realize it can only happen once per game right? if someone is hooked during EGC, blood warden will not last until the end, and survivors will be free to go. there is literally nothing broken about it.
---
It‚Äôs funny how obviously yellow some killers are. I see a thread every day asking, ‚Äúcan I do this..‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to play the way you want to play. Whether you play NOED Ebony nurse or Freddy, survivors will always: rage quit, cry, give you salt, whine, teabag, BM, and accuse you of shit because they suck.
---
Just play the game dude. If you plan on ‚Äúplaying by the rules‚Äù, guess what? You‚Äôre purposely handicapping yourself and you are going to be bad.
---
I don't enjoy running it either because it feels pretty cheap
---
Normally what I do is go for David and get We're going to live forever and then work with whatever seems fun using that.
---
That "fat dudes" name is Carl the Cashier &gt;:(
---
lol shut the fuck up
---
Damn
---
Darn
---
Rin deserved better.
---
Honestly either I'm a good Leatherface or something but I don't think Leatherface is a bad killer. So I think the current Legion is too weak sooooo yeah Legion. Also I'm a legion main lol
---
edgy but this is the start of shirtless ghostface meme now. So future legend
---
Nope. Tons more coming. Welcome to the game, though.
---
It looks like a YouTube creepypasta......

I usually tell people I hope they feel better soon. with a &lt;3

W-why is Claudette holding one?
---
I had hoped some semblance of sense might finally slip into your brain, but apparently I gave you too much credit and you're just too stupid for that. I mean, you're even too stupid to realize the hatch can be *closed* now, and you want to call me dense? Hilarious. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So, the Freddy rework is real?
---
This guy is acting like NOBODY else does ANY of this Bahahahah. OH because hes willing to do it in your face and not be afraid to show his emotions hes the immediate bad guy, holy shit this sub is full of huge hypocrites its laughable. Everyone gets upset as killer at a good group, everyone acts like they are the best survivor or killer, everyone makes assumptions (Duh) and I assure you all of you act like fucking idiots all the time when you DC and nobody knows about it. Rofl, get the fuck over yourselfs holy shit, hypocrites all over the place XD
---
Everyone up in here is acting they too wouldn't hate other players after 4k hours of playing with such infants in a game thats no longer fun for anyone even new players.
---
What we should REALLY be asking ourselves is why do people WANT to click on something that will possibly be extremely toxic. Why do we enjoy seeing others be awful pieces of shit that should be put out of their misery. Thats the Tru question.
---
Rancor isn‚Äôt even good tbh. He would have complained about anything. Heck him, and heck complainers.
---
If you dont tunnel how do you keep up with survivors that can get 5 gens in the same amount of minutes. Especially with SwF. Run ruin and they just take an extra small bit of time cleansing it.
---
Well technically it's a ghostface dlc not a scream dlc ;)
---
That's a bit tricky, since bonnie and chica both act the same way in both 1 and 2. If we would implement it though chica could utilize her cupcake as a disabler of sorts, she places it on say a generator or chest and as soon as a survivor try's to touch it, the cupcake morphs into the night version, clamping down on the survivor and acting as a beacon. Bonnie's could be a basic killer at first, think wraith. Except each time a pallet is slammed his upper face becomes more loosed, until it falls off completely, in which he gains faster attack recovery speed at the cost of a longer stun time. Then theres freddy, which is trickier to think of. One idea is fo make it so he slowly gains stronger as the match wears on. I dont know how exactly, generators come to mind with making it so he becomes faster, quiet and eventually stronger, till once one gen is left he essentially can one shot survivors but terror radius is replaced with his music once the power is out.
---
He just hates toxicity, that‚Äôs about it. He wants to make a difference, but is a very difficulty goal that seems to tilt him a lot. Great guy tho
---
Shhhhh.... Let people have their fun
---
I'm not even gonna touch the part where you downvote for absolutely no reason. We'll just leave that be.
---
I didn't imply anything. I didn't even hint at anything. I said exactly what I said; "survivors make the killer look like an absolute joke in that game.". It's literally right there. I never said the game has balancing issues, I said the survivors make the killer look like a joke. Period. It's right there. 
---
I'll copy and paste it one more time "survivors make the killer look like an absolute joke in that game. ". Okay, now you can downvote and walk away without learning anything again for the 1000th time
---
About that....
---
Franklin‚Äôs + Bloody Coil Trapper. 
---
Franklin‚Äôs Hag. 
---
Just watching people go back into danger for an item is hilarious.
---
I've got a few people by pure coincidence of running into them
---
If you are asking witch is the new lowest tier killer there are plenty to choose from. Wraith, trapper and legion are all in the lowest tier and it will probably be one of them IF it will be any at all. Most likley will diferent people consider diferent killers to be the weekest
---
If one survivor escapes with 4 generators left on the map, who really cares? You completely kicked their asses and one of them gets a pity escape, no big deal.
---
Besides, if there are that many gens left and only two survivors, just slug if you care that much about the 4k. It's not like you're in much of a hurry at that point.

Trapper smells like a man - sweat and hard work. bit of that scent rich people have too cause he's a wealthy boy:3

damn, getting hot in here?

well i thought the reason why carl isnt coming is because his dead body was shown in the trailer because normally the survivors dead bodies arent shown if they are gonna be in the game
---
That is a thicc border

But I like legion :(

Ooh spicy I'd pair it with Whispers so I know where to seach

yeah, unfortunately Daddy :c i mean Trapper will be the least power consistent killer. i play him pretty often and have to say these days i do much better with Bubba whenever i get the daily or want to be a cunt to Blendettes.

That guy is a moron [who is also now claiming I'm harassing him, btw](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bw65ny/its_really_sad_that_there_are_people_who_revel_in/epxlvto/). No idea where he even got the idea I'm a survivor main from. I'm a 50/50 main. I know how hard the Michael achievement is and I know for a fact that the killer in my game did not deserve to be handed it.
---
I know I shouldn't have to keep coming back here to defend myself. I guess I'm just annoyed that someone would do something as pathetic as screenshot comments from a subreddit just to post the screenshot in the same subreddit and beg for validation and try to start a pitchfork situation against me (and yet, I'm harassing him?)

Thanks for not being an idiot :)

u/vreddit_bot

Watching that hurt my heart a little. Poor guy just wanted a kill
---
He looks just like a survivor, I sometimes only notice its him when hes close enough for the red light/Heartbeat. That person was wrong, thats all that matters.
---
It gives you bloody cosmetics and supposedly a better chance of rarer bloodwebs items (based on tests it‚Äôs pretty negligible). If that interests you, getting to prestige 3 before going for all perks will save you bloodpoints.
---
Late reply, but I do think fiscal stinginess has a lot to do with it - in the anniversary livestream, Mathieu Cote essentially said the rights to the mask were all they attempted because that was the most iconic thing about Ghostface anyway. 
---
I love DbD, but Behaviour is still the company that stole code from Bethesda to make a licensed game for HBO.  They're pretty shady people
---
You don't tombstone correctly rofl. But you also brought even another huge source of variability to the table with different maps. Certain killers lose tons of power on a certain map and gain tons of power on others. All I ever said is that these tier lists are largely irrelevant because they can't possibly account for every variable, and even if the account for one variable, that still isn't useful because players don't always use that variable.

It‚Äôs a meme I made while high I wasn‚Äôt putting much thought in it

THEY ARE GETTING TIER 3 OFF EACH OTHER

I always meet toxic messages with positivity. Sometimes the people don‚Äôt give a shit and co to us to be toxic, but there are some people who genuinely become more positive. It‚Äôs nice to do.
---
Lmao so instead of indicating it with a yellow bar which is a good thing, they changed it to a red bar which usually means bad things.
---
Or they are just horny teens.
---
I‚Äôve been to rank 1 plenty. I‚Äôm just not brain dead enough to blame shitty map pressure and bad game mechanics on one perk.

---
"Ghostface?  You mean Scream?"

"You wanna get sued, boy?"
---
Obama but with slender man's proportions.
---
I'm honestly surprised we're getting Ghostface after getting Legion. I know DBD has wanted him for ages but I kind of assumed Legion was them giving up and making their own version. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, though. We've got both Hillbilly and Bubby, after all.
---
I didn't watch the stream, is there any word on the Survivor? Cause if it's Sydney, and she looks like Neve Campbell, I may actually need to get her.
---
So true
---
For number 3, it really just defeats the purpose of borrowed time. Borrowed time is so you can't hit the person straight off the hook, but if the killer is already led away from the hook and the person is saved, why would one even need borrowed time?
---
Ah, guess I got the 2 confused. Thanks.
---
What?
---
u/PraiseTheStu000
---
That sounds awesome with her hair flowing down in front of her face
---
You might be, but at this point I'm convinced that killers would lose their mind if their totems are able to be found at all considering some of the change ideas I've seen for totems (like letting killers place them wherever they want)
---
Or legion doing knife tricks but ends up cutting their hand and gets angry about it

It is closed or it doesn't exist. Which is it?? You are brainless as hell and keep moving the goal posts to fit your narrative. If he is trying to tombstone me then obviously he didn't go close the fucking hatch. You are dumb as hell!

Don't fucking put words in my mouth rofl I never said adrenaline was some end-all-be-all reason for survivors being OP. Don't even try to say that I did. But 4 people having adrenaline is very very strong and adrenaline in general is very strong with SWF groups.

---
(Reads Unrelenting) ...Rest in peace, my dear machinegun. You were too good for this world. 
---
In all seriousness, I actually think the majority of your ideas would make sense on paper but I'm not entirely sure about in practice. 
---
Part of the problem is that a lot of these perks suffer from fundamental problems that lead to their general disuse. Distressing, for example, isn't worth it because it gives Survivors more time to react to you rather than less, or Spies is an extremely distracting perk to use due to the constant noise notifications. 
---
Though if I could offer a suggestion for PWYF? Just make it so that hitting the Obsession loses all stacks. Otherwise I think the idea of losing stacks when downing Survivors is a damn solid suggestion. Tie it in with STBFL a little more, though
---
i literally main wraith and i dont have even the slighest problem with flashlights
---
fuckin way she goes
---
He‚Äôs a very hot or miss killer and I have no clue how people do well with him ahaha but I‚Äôll definitely practice with him and see how it goes ahah
---
camp the gate not the hatch
---
Dwight looks fine, good looking even, Jake? I dunno whats going on with him...
---
No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity, Left Behind: No Mither is "Hard Mode" while making Self Care and Solidarity unusable, also Left Behind is so niche it might as well do nothing.
---
Myers: Judith's Tombstone + Scratched Mirror (sure you could go Vanity but considering the Killer is probably going to try then you'd move faster due to EW2 I think?)
---
Beast Of Prey, Distressing, Infectious Fright, Monstrous Shrine: Beast Of Prey isn't usable, Distressing for that slight terror radius increase, Infectious Fright being practically useless, and Monstrous Shrine would probably never work unless a Survivor is sticking near the basement for whatever reason.
---
"Survivors make the killer look like an absolute joke" how does that not imply that survivors are stronger than the hunter? You further go on describe how powerful the survivors are, about how they can "extend chases for days". How hunters are forced to run NOED/Detention because otherwise they'll lose.
---
If survivors make the hunter look like a joke, the game has balancing issues. Period. It's right there.
---
*why can‚Äôt weeby friends*
---
Same with legion imo but not as weak aha
---
Nani the fuck?
---
It‚Äôs working now but very sluggish. I can only connect to people who are from different countries than myself as well
---
A survivor has three stages they go into while on a hook. If they get hooked and X amount of time passes, they go into second stage which is the struggle stage. If struggle stage runs out, it goes into third stage, which is death. 
---
Whether a survivor dies on their first, seocnd or third hook depends on if and when another survivor unhooks them. If you leave the survivor on the hook for too long, you risk them going into the next stage.
---
So if I'm a survivor and I get hooked, and don't get unhooked until my struggle stage begins, then that counts as having been hooked twice. I will die on the next hook, which for you will be the second time you hook me.
---
But at the same time don't underestimate a killer's resourcefulness.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get good at pig and I can‚Äôt seem to make use of her stealth properly but imma keep trying ahah
---
The killer doesn't have anything to do with it. 
---
Sometimes people are left on the hook until stage 2 or until they die.
---
Or maybe they were trying to attempt escape of the hook.
---
2 possible reasons. Mostly likely is they were the last survivor left alive and the entity automatically kills the survivor under this condition. Other is they are just giving up on the hook or were left too long on the hook and went to phase 2.
---
That build sounds OP.. I'm gonna go complain about it on the forums ;(

Yea burns are bad because I can often end up closer after the stun if I make distance while they shine the flashlight. It‚Äôs definitely an inconvenience and when timed right can be strong, but most of the time it‚Äôs just not worth it

There's also just old fashioned ones where you plug in the tiny USB adapter and the keyboard connects to that. I never went back to wireless keyboards though after I had batteries leak inside one.
---
Dude, you understand all wrong. Let me explain. The Killers win when survivors get salty at them, because that means they played great üòâ.
---
Ignorant players will do that. That's just survivor mains for you. If someone just plays one side they usually get super biased and play with you like you are their sworn enemy. Not everyone is like that  but some are. Survivors can be greedy ignorant and toxic. Killers too.

---
As far as I'm concerned the only change Borrowed Time needs is to activate based on Killer proximity as well as or rather than Terror Radius so that Wraith, Pig, and Killers with Insidious don't get free license to camp and tunnel off hook.
---
As for your problems with BT, they can be solved by just going after the person making the save rather than the person being saved. No. 3 and 2 in particular should let you down (or at the very least get a free hit on) the savior if you go for them rather than the formerly hooked Survivor.
---
It‚Äôs really good for punishing greedy survivors as well.

Maybe you should try to play Billy, then you will love Rotten Fields.

Yes.
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed this until now.

It's supposed to work that way. Sometimes if a killer quits a little early it will still give you points if someone scored enough and if you weren't going to pip anyways or you didnt have time to you wont.

That's super shitty.

For your first three games facing a killer you get a tip about it. I also heard it does it at below rank 15 but cant confirm that one.
---
To be Frank, I rather liked your pun.
---
You 're a moron.
---
Simplified it would be a bonus for wining against a high score survivor team. I think a matchmaking system would help making the calculations taking trial duration and bloodpoint disitribution during each timeframe based on action, plus rank at the start of the trial for both teams.
---
But it would kinda turn stalling killers into walking B&amp;Cs...
---
Reverse card
---
Also, Devour Hope kinda exists, so the concept is there and it would have insane synergy...

Dayman as survivor

Now that's the buff Legion needs, why use a knife when you can stab people with your face?
---
It's definitely killer-sided in that situation.  Survivor can't really freely look for it like the killer can, and gates spawn right next to each other probably 60% of the time.
---
I've still never seen any final survivor manage to open a gate.

True but still don't feel like I should get down voted for it but I mean can't do anything about it.

I think BT is relatively okay. Maybe change it so the timer doesn't pause when being chased.

If anything needs changing, it's the unhook immunity survivors get. That should not exist at all imo. Unhooking properties should not be survivor-sided.

I mean yeah. I‚Äôd DC from a prayer beads spirit.

it really doesn't, it's usually people just screwing around.
---
Better yet; when they relentlessly tbag at the gates, not realizing that blood warden is in play
---
Why can't weee buy friends?
---
Ash, like many others, is fucked against the doctor.
---
Whoa, dude. Why are you being so aggressive?
---
Sorry if anything I said stuck a nerve. Def was not my intent. Though, you...may consider seeking anger management if that really set you off o.O
---
Playing killer is SCARY. Ill just stick to whats easy. ROFL
---
killer could have faced the exit. a few times i have seen survivors with flashlights actually leave because they forgot that's how the exit works, lol. prevents you from getting flashlight and you still get to pick up!
---
No no this this the 
---
*survivor can commit seppuku* perk
---
‚ÄúSuicide is badass‚Äù
---
I use Rancor in combination with Save The Best For Last and Play With Your Food for a funny "One Punch" build where you insta-down and Mori the obsession after ignoring him all game for STBFL and PWYF tokens. 
---
IMHO survivors can use bullshit like Mettle Of Man with insta-heals. If they run that, they have to accept the fact that since MoM is an obsession perk they can end up being hard-countered via Rancor..
---
The chest
---
Except insidious oh bubba as everyone reports me for it :(
---
No just dont tunnel
---
This is way too wholesome for dbd
---
I just really want a mall map :(
---
Thats just it. Against players that Are good, I can't catch. Otherwise I'd gladly give them some toxicness back. But most of them rely on pallets like its to survive the plaque. So I can't catch them.
---
Use whatever. Rancors kinda boring but you get clear warning
---
That must of been depressing for the killer. Did he at least get a kill?
---
Cowboys
---
spirit fury is just a terrefying perk.
---
Is prayer beads gross coming from  a survivor or killer main?   And I won‚Äôt stop using the add ons that are in the game for a reason, thanks lmfaooo
---
And they‚Äôre just hiding 24/7.
---
I get caught so often from this method I don't even get mad anymore.
---
At this point I don't even know why I still get caught out despite knowing that trappers like doing this.
---
The best feeling is when you can get so good that you destroy these teams and then they‚Äôll still say the exact same things to you. It‚Äôs what makes playing killer worth it. Just truck through it and don‚Äôt worry about what they say.
---
And thats because Im definitely more of a Survivor main. I have like 7 hours in Billy yet I get consistant 4K unless They Are a Swf, 4way I mean
---
That‚Äôs what I was expecting. This sub has ruined me
---
I‚Äôve never heard Spirit being a broken killer lmao that‚Äôs a new one!

---
&gt;Entity ***very*** pleased
---
Being killer is fun depending on who you play. Freddy, Wraith, and other low tier killers opens you up to getting picked on by Surviviors bent on ruining the fun. 
---
That's why higher tier perks. Hag, Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are the ones that toxic Surviviors are usually more hesitant to try and bully. However, all the higher tier killers are the more difficult ones (except for Billy. He's braindead af).
---
At level 30,35, and 40, perks will become available as teachables in your characters bloodweb. Teachables will cause those perks to also spawn in the bloodwebs of other characters. Some good perks to gun for as quickly as you can on the 5 killers you start the game with is Nurses calling, Enduring, Brutal Strength, and Hex: Huntresses lullaby (a substitute for Hex: Ruin). 
---
If ur willing to dip into ur $ or if you see certain perks pop up in the Shrine of Secrets, keep a close eye out for the better perks. Here's a few for killers. If ur willing to spend money on the killers with the perks, I'll put their name down next to the perk.
---
Hex: Ruin (Hag). 
---
Monitor and Abuse (Doctor). 
---
Hex: Devour Hope (Hag).
---
Spirit Fury (Spirit). 
---
Hex: Haunted ground (Spirit).
---
Barbeque and Chili (Cannibal).
---
Franklin's Demise (Cannibal). 
---
Bamboozle (Clown).
---
Surveillance (Pig). 
---
Make your Choice (Pig). 
---
Overcharge (Doctor). 
---
Discordance (Legion). 
---
Save the best for last (Michael). 
---
Dying light (Micheal). 
---
Corrupt intervention (Plague). 
---
As for Surviviors, you start off with 7 Surviviors (6 if not on PC), some perks to look out for on those 6 are Prove Thyself, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Self Care, Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing, Borrowed time, and dead hard. For other Survivior perks, here's another list of good ones to look out for, I'll list the name of the Survivior so you know who to get if you dip into ur money. 
---
Decisive strike (Laurie).
---
Object of Obsession (Laurie. Note that this perk is extremely. EXTREMELY risky) 
---
Lithe (Feng). 
---
Alert (Feng). 
---
Mettle of Man (Ash). 
---
Stake out (David Tapp). 
---
Poised (Jane). 
---
Tenacity (David Tapp). 
---
Truth be told not many good Survivior perks are on DLC Surviviors. But the good ones are there.
---
Who cares, I was pleased...
---
You see this in streams a lot, someone cautiously scans the ground, finds a trap and immediately picks up the pace after they disarm it like they have a temporary immunity.
---
 I saw that and realized I was an asshole and could exploit it.

And it‚Äôs a ruin skill check!

Imo the community is fine, people just get offended to easily
---
It's not worse but holy shit is it annoying how you can hook another surv, then still get struck after that. 
---
Also it straight up should not get a charge from kobes.
---
True i have this problem sometimes too when 4 gens left to do and the last survivors are hiding doin nothing. Then i have to search for them until somehow finally 1 of them dies
---
But also theres a simiular problem when playing survivor.  Yesterday i played a match with my kate and only me and a meg was left. Not even 1 single gen was done and i had to save my teammates all the time. The nurse was tryharding to get a 4k so instead of hooking the meg for the 3rd time she just left her to the ground searching for me. Dont get me wrong is actually a tactic some people play. But i managed to get the meg up 4 times and she was always doin the same until she saw me. I mean common just give me a little chance there is no garant i would escape after the meg died. Also she had a clear win and losing the last survivor to hatch or gate is no shame.
---
Looks like someone caught onto my joke...
---
Hex: Now There's Two of Em!
---
When a survivor is near the obsession they gain increased speed of 5/10/20% to all actions
---
If the obsession dies survivors are shown for 2 seconds and suffer from hindered for 1 min.

---
You're not wrong
---
DBD is better but noth are fun
---
Personally, I use it to mark the gen I'm working on in case the killer runs me off of it. And hopefully it also attracts other survivors to come help me on the gen or finish it. I might also mark an exit since there have been times I get turned around because I missed the exit doors alert.
---
Eh I wouldn't say its NP but id rather this the before
---
There's a 3rd Myers stalking them
---
Wound up finding him just standing after that... he was AFK the whole match. The sound of 3 generators finishing like that just seems awesome enough to share no matter the circumstances.
---
More or less, I suppose. But I've seen some of the really great and really awful ones, so my personal judgement may be skewed.
---
Very funny xD.
---
The perk now works like an anti-tunneling perk, similar to borrowed time. New DS activates as soon as you are unhooked and lasts for 60 seconds. When you are downed or interrupted/grabbed, the skill check will pop up during the killer pick up animation. If you succeed the skill check, you escape the killer‚Äôs grasp and then you become the obsession. Afterwards the perk is deactivated. If you fail the skill check the perk deactivates. If the 60 second timer runs out, the perk deactivates.

Other comment or is lucky about not getting a lot of DC‚Äôs on PS4 because I assure you is just as bad for PS4 right now. 2-4 months ago the game was virtually unplayable because of the rate of DC‚Äôs. People on PS4 literally don‚Äôt give a single fuck and with DC for anything, killer or survivor. And once you get to Rank 1-6, Killers are awful because they dodge 75% of the pregame lobbies because they don‚Äôt like what they see joining. It‚Äôs virtually impossible to play SWF at that rank on PS4. And since there aren‚Äôt a lot of people at high rank on PS4 anymore if you piss off a killer at that rank, they literally dodge you the moment they see you forever, same with survivors. I‚Äôve had to make a list of killers and survivors that I will dodge if I see because of seriously bad experiences.
---
stopped working then worked again after
---
Aw, they didn‚Äôt take their shirts off :(
---
Well at least this one is still not competely free of consquence since old one had no conditions. 
---
I agree it is to combat tunneling but at some point if a killer tunnels the DS won't be but a prolonger. The main problem DS has is slugging. I don't think it should be permanent after unhook but I think something should be changed?
---
You'd be surprised the lengths some killers go to kill you. Sad part is I don't think this has helped tunneling at all since no one really runs it anymore. (I'm looking at you MoM)
---
So you're on the boat of keeping it?
---
I will, thanks fam

how on earth do ya get it that way lol, i have tried doing this kind of style and effect myself but it c o n f u s i o n

Yeah, those are the guys you should probably watch until you get better. Watch Monto cause he‚Äôll show you a lot of builds you can do with certain killers. He dosent show how you play certain killers most of the time so just watch a few guides that way you can learn how to use them

It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been broken for like ever. Couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time it worked on PS4.

The council of oinks approves this.

I was making the point that if he was to try this in any other rank he would depip
---
Yeah, but that's how Ash was designed from the get go. He will never (assuming he gets more) get a head cosmetic that works like the other survivors. It will always be a head/torso combination.

You're in a tank. One person with an RPG isn't going to do much and you can deal with them quickly.

4 people with RPGs is a serious problem.

4 people with RPGs in bunkers, with tank traps and AT mines is unbeatable.
---
How do your downvotes taste?

I'm not leading the killer to you I'm fucking panicking and running around like a wild animal.

She really doesn't need a buff, she needs to be reworked.
---
My moment of getting back at toxicity was with a 4 man SWF (everyone's favorite!). Gates were powered, the 3 (the other one was sacrificed about halfway) who were left alive were healing their damaged Claudette. This was the mistake. Their Jake healed her to completion while the other one ran through into the exit. But surprise, NOED! Even though 2 of them escaped I was able to grab jakey boy for unententionally sand-bagging himself on the Claudette mere centimeters from escape. Glorious!
---
Nah don't play this broken shit you'll be more often frustrated than entertained and that's not what gaming is supposed to be.

---
I'd always thought it meant for killers whose power isn't all that helpful in a chase, like trapper or doctor.
---
Honestly, the best advice I can give is to just try to grin and bear it through the grinding. It gets easier over time.
---
Recommend Ardetha and OhTofu for killer guides and Ulyssis for survivor gameplay. For people I recommend you shouldn't watch I would say TydeTyme(everyone hates him) or Angrypug(I just don't like how he acts so this is my opinion.)
---
But can u turn off the non friendly?
---
Dude, its right there, last sentence.
---

It's more the issue that Epic Games doesn't have any "party" features, social features, ability to review games and has had a stupid ammount of security breaches where people's credit card info got leaked.
---
They got a long way to go to be more than just a neusance.
---
a resident evil chapter with ashley as the survivor (since she is like the only person in those games who didn‚Äôt have a gun or kill anything) and a licker as the killer (or really any of the countless other creatures from the series)
---
why does everyone hate Tyde? i keep seeing that people don't like him and i don't understand why
---
Wholesome Michaels
---
Dead hard and balanced landing?
---
Kind of a waste tbh
---
I even got to experience a 5 gen chain pop as a killer. But there's only 4 survivors you say. Yup, but if you manage to get most of the gens to 99%, pop one and then pop the closest one.
---
But then again, it was definately a 4 swf well coordinated, and it was my first game playing piggie. 
---
I ended up sacrificing 1, another died from a rbt, and the last one barely made it to the hatch, after  his friend chose his own life and escaped. Gotta love altruismüôà
---
Now this was before the 2.7 patch, and i saved up  almost 800k bp to level her.
---
Yeah but I could have sworn initially there was supposed to be unlocks via the bloodweb for cosmetics...
---
I agree, trade in add-ons/offerings, things for more bloodpoints or let them transfer to other characters at minimum.
---
Survivors make up rules that you have to follow. do yourself a favor as a killer main and close the little chat bubble and set your steam profile to only friends can send you messages.
---
**AAGH....***clink*..**OOF....***clonk.....****WHUHH...*** tonk...**HAHHG..**
---
That's okay with friend probably .
---
I‚Äôm guessing with DLC‚Äôs that include a new killer, a survivor, and a new map the price will be 6.99 while the DLC‚Äôs that only include a killer or a survivor will be 4.99. So I guess ghostface will be 4.99.
---
Interesting. Thank you for the info, may I ask what the ruin hex does exactly?
---
Qlare they gone? :(
---
tbh thats why i show all no mercy its straight if i see you i will follow you and kill you
---
We also have a special event after the double points weekend, I assume we can get extra points there aswell with objectives in game. So BLOODPOINTS.
---
This is why I play leatherface with insta saw add o a
---
Survivors complain about camping, so I don't camp.
---
Survivors complain about tunneling, so I don't tunnel.
---
Survivors complain about getting not enough bloodpoints by dying to quick, so I give them 92K extra points.
---
AND THEY STILL COMPLAIN?
---
From the google dictionary thing: Davy Jones Locker: the bottom of the sea, especially regarded as the grave of those drowned at sea. 
---
Maybe the perk could be that whenever someone enters a locker all of the survivors aura are revealed to you for 4 seconds except for the ones in your terror radius or in a 32/28/24 meter radius of that locker
---
Explanation (for the name): The places that aren't in your terror radius or the radius of that locker is the sea, and the (terror) radius of you/the locker are the ships. The "sea" is where the survivors are going to die (drown)
---
I haven't played the game yet, so I don't know if this is OP, Balanced, or Useless
---
Sadly I don‚Äôt think they can do this, it falls too close to licensed horror icons and the holders could sue for copying the ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù of the characters.
---
This is not what I expected. I clicked this link for a happy ending.
---
Just because he got extra bloodpoints doesn‚Äôt mean the match was particularly fun for him. 
---
Don‚Äôt agree with the way he lashed out but bloodpoints don‚Äôt equal fun.
---
What is the font? Asking for a "friend"
---
The problem with MoM is it drives more people to play the killers that are already really good. In a game where balance already is kind of a joke, it makes the killer imbalance actually bad instead of something most people are willing to deal with. Sure, fixing killer balance would be a great way to alleviate that, but even doing that just makes MoM better, and that means the original problem hasn't been fixed.
---
Hag and trapper. It feels soo satisfying to predict survivors movements and I love the planning ahead aspect of it. Especially with trapper since he's a weaker killer and his traps are harder to get survivors in than hags
---
It‚Äôs even more perfect that the picture has Meg
---
This comment is the truth, I don't give a fuck about tea bagging. Why should you? Omg a random stranger on the internet is pressing the control key instead of running away!!
---
The only killer I could see this really working for is Legion.
---
That's simply because after you hit someone with frenzy initiating a chase then you have a couple of seconds to dash to someone else before the chase ends and you could get a lot closer before they realise you're coming for them
---
When is the x2 weekend? Didn't get a chance go watch the stream.
---
Same. I expected this ash to save him with a flashlight, take a hit or insta heal him but I guess this works too
---
WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH
---
I was once carrying a Claudette who did this to the basement.
---
Had downed her mid-point, there was an Ace in the locker. Dropped the Ace after checking the locker, started ferrying Claudette to the hook. Claudette disconnected. Let the Ace and his friend second-Claudette go, but he wanted me to chase him around the map until EGC killed him, was very wholesome.
---
Everyone who tries to rat out their team should know that they're totally being laughed at in end-game chat, like for real.
---
Also that they will be hunted down mercilessly, I've surrendered three whole generators over this too, if they manage to run.

exactly thats why i make it my job for them to die like whats the point if tgey gonna complain like lst i check a killer kills people you be lucky if i walk away when your dying or i hit you once and idk who downvote me but its the truth
---
there was a recent update that added a new feature called ‚Äúendgame‚Äù. So basically when the timer runs out everyone who is still in the game dies by the entity. Blood warden just prevented them from exiting
---
It‚Äôs the new reworked Freddy perk, it‚Äôs called Blood Wooden.
---
I'm gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move
---
All them. But since you're limited, I'd say get The Plague &amp; Micheal Myers if you can only get two rn.
---
‚ÄòOops I dropped my magnum condom that I use for my magnum dong‚Äô - that‚Äôs the description
---
&gt;If they slug you and refuse to hook you ever then you're good for the rest of the game? That's a pretty big nerf to the slugging strat
---
You've said in a different comment that slugging is boring counterplay to ds. With the change you have proposed it's still better to slug the downed person since they might have ds. You get more map pressure out of it if you didn't get to chase the unhooker. A slug is a bait for their teammate, plus you are getting 1+ people off of gens to save them.
---
&gt;If the killer runs along you for 20 seconds and you can't find a pallet or a window to loop them around
---
Waiting out 20 seconds &gt; hitting the survivor within those 20 seconds and not being able to pick them up. You can get to the pallet loop within those 20 seconds and not be able to use your perk. What is the point in running DS at that point, might as well not use it and get the benefits of it (not getting picked up) anyway.
---
+ the perk punishes you for your teammates trying to bodyblock for you/bring borrowed time for you. It creates a bad mentality for survivors "Should I bodyblock for my teammate who's getting tunneled? What if they have ds and I screw them over?"
---
They actually had 3x BP in the summer of 2017.
---
The killer with a perk for double bloodpoints after the trial is one of the weaker killers. 
---
So ehh. I mean you could level up the weaker killer to get the bloodpoint perk on your stronger killers.
---
Means they're kinky fucks. The good little brats that they are
---
Because survivors don‚Äôt heal
---
I mean fair. Flair holds true.
---
Bc he is a base killer.
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Monto intensifies
---
- every Claudette ever
---
True but think of the spy from TF2 its kinda the same. u would think it would be useless but idk i would disagree
---
Funny picture üòÇ 
---
Yeah not always easy to find the way out before the killer got you by your neck ü§™
---
If you are interested to see all Mori Animations, check this out ‚§µÔ∏è
---
https://youtu.be/61T8uc2d3iM
---
Cool idea. But again like i said with the other guy. Its kinda like the spy from tf2. Even pros dont say ''hey is that you".
---
You just got to try to sacrafice them before they get more than 1 gen done. Your chances go down more after each gen gets done.
---
Did you ever hear of the...
---
Yeah, but that's the thing, it's not infringing on any copyrights to use a really common trope.
---
Hillbilly is legally distinct despite being a Hillbilly that uses a chainsaw, BLATANTLY based on Leatherface. There's no way "long hair" isn't legally acceptable.
---
No.
---
I prefer to play as a survivor, Dwight is my favorite but I have to level him up. Is he a good survivor with good perks?
---
Probably this Wensday because all the skin releases usually come out on Wensday
---
Nothing, no matter how hard I try, I can't rank up at all, 30K bloodpoints still doesn't even give me one pip, I've been matched with red rank players every other game for the past week, I'm fucking done, I don't pip when I get a 3k, I don't even pip when I get a 4k, not sure if this is a bug, or if the game just hates me, but I aint playing this piece of shit until I start getting pips when I do good shit.
---
I gave the toolbox human features in my head. The toolbox could have protected the Meg, but just stood there.
---
What's better is getting a 4k after camping cuz everyone tryna get big bawlz and be altruistic. 
---
Thank you, gullible sheep.
---
Bloody Party Streamers should be a secret offering.
---
Damn that's pretty accurate
---
There are two kinds of players- ones who want to be mori'd by Daddy Myres, and ones who are in denial.
---
Can we nerf survs again?
---
Dont do drugs kids
---
If you want to play killer you need Leatherface DLC. BBQ is essential for faster levelling. It's a very useful perk during the game, too.
---
It's always Claudette, Jeff, and Nea that gets me from how they look :/
---
Hag, Michael and Bubba

Legion's spent MONTHS trying to claim Freddy's dumpster, and you're just gonna hand it to Plague? Wow.
---
Camping is an available strategy, its just not a very viable strategy most of the times. 
---
I know some of the people on this sub are going to take this serious, hence the comment I made earlier.
---
With all that negative space above her where the hair was I assume, it just adds to the creepiness. Like, this would be one of those videos you remember seeing on your playlist, but is impossible to find if you look for it, and it‚Äôs just like a 7 minute video of this image accompanied by the Shepherd‚Äôs Tone or something...
---
Yeah I know was just pointing it out in case people would take it serious but wtf I already got down voted like I cant  say anything  without getting downvoted ffs
---
Because however you play, there‚Äôll always be someone who doesn‚Äôt like it. If you slug you suck, if you run strong perks you‚Äôre sweaty, if you have an endgame build you‚Äôre bad, and even if you farm it‚Äôs boring. Just play the best you can and enjoy the friendly interactions with survivors when they happen.

Well....at least he looks good in the opening cinematic.

This was my post, I deleted it out of shame.

"GET THAT SWEET KARMA" lmao
---
She is strong but in my opinion actually fun to play against.
---
He works at a walmart like store, he uses a fake name to hide his real identidy
---
Blood Warden is a Freddy perk. If you hook somebody after the gate has been opened, they aren't allowed to leave for a full minute and it will be blocked off until the timer runs out. Partnered with the endgame collapse it is finally useless. I barely ever use noed but against a toxic group with blood Warden you feel amazing.
---
Yea pallet slide, they are human, they are about the same size as your average survivor, they can run like survivors, and I think the breathing is a little similar too. Cant confirm but the other day when I played legion both me and my buddy tripped out because we heard her breathing and thought it was a survivor
---
I bet you didn't place 10 traps on hooked survivors.
---
Noob
---
To me BPS does not spark joy. I feel like it always summons a Meta Nurse or Billy who are fully committed to dashing my dreams of getting above 10 000 BP from the match.
---
That's Joey
---
People are actually downvoting you... Wow... guess you touched a nerv
---
You know you could have used the mask from the tv show Scream. Which would‚Äôve been 1000% times better.
---
This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them!
---
Yeah you're right
---
Another version would be, Rancor- I'm about the end this mans entire career
---
could be completely wrong, but iirc the menu doesn't cap your fps so the ps4 just cranks it to the max with no limits
---
Ya against good Loopers you can't catch by just running for them. You gotta start trying to mindgame them or back off and go for someone else though if they're all God's then it's really just a gg
---
I played with a Jane yesterday named mori me daddy. I unhooked him and dude went afk. We got 4k'd and I got paired with him again next game. He went afk again. Good times.
---
Watch Zubatlel or Scottjund if you want to learn something, Monto is just an entertainer with cherrypicked games and Hybrid is pure cringe.
---
Why are you being a cunt to him?
---
Tell that to the 4ks i got with camping
---
There is no point in living when you know they are coming right at you to get the save 
---
I remember one game as clown on preschool i got fucked whole game 
---
Wanted to secure atleast one kill 
---
Ended up getting 4 cause morons decided to rush gens 
---
I would probably not even camp if they didn't run at me xD play bad and make them cocky 
---
Then camp and ez 4k &lt;3
---
I mean its not that a care about rank or those 5k BP from escaping, so I may as well help my teammates
---
Pre DS was completely negated and useless of the killer juggled you,
---
Yeah but hopefully the people with game pass aren‚Äôt toxic
---
Is it you? Are *you* the pig?
---
NOED and blood warden üåö
---
I will admit I suck, which is a GIANT understatement lol. But They always Manage to get out of the mindgame and Lose Me, Im good at losing killers But no tracking AS a killer. I just need to git gud pretty much
---
Most times she‚Äôs such an innocent cutie, it‚Äôs okay. ):
---
They are adding the skull trooper to the game. His power is a gold scar that he lazers the survivors with smh my head
---
I do think Corrupt Purge needs a nerf to compensate for implementing any of these changes. Maybe a larger cooldown after using a vomit.
---
Freddy went from F tier to GOD in a matter of a year
---
Besides the shining theme sounds just like the dbd theme
---
We are obviously gonna get Bikini Clown
---
I would brb after a hook to get a drink or a snack
---
Nobody would give a shit about 10% though. That would only be useful when paired with thanatophobia but that forces a perk meta on that killer.
---
This was the order that the leaker posted:

The poor guy will have to learn from his mistakes and learn to play better. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Fuck this makes me want a ‚Äú The gang gets taken by the entity ‚Äú DLC. I need a Danny Devito survivor now.
---
Piggy is not a camper. She is a fucking tunneler. Evrry single pig I encountered the last games tunneled the shit out of the person with the trap.
---
1. Broken doesn't equal broken sickness. 
---
2. But that is the problem. At high ranks, survivors just bypass the power of the plague. How is it ridiculous that the plague should be able to even use her power. No other killer suffers from not being able to use their power like that.
---
3. What do you mean too much?
---
4. That is the point. It incentivises them to cleanse or else they get punished.
---
&gt;When someone cleans is they do not get fully healed just like legions mending action you have to heal yourself after it. 
---
This idea would make the problem worse. At least some people would cleanse to get a nice heal but now, they wouldn't even get that benefit.
---
Oh? You‚Äôre approaching me?
---
All the other ones say directly which of the four Legion members they belong to, but it just says High-Vis Horror.
---
That is why I don't like it as much lol. Good loopers wouldn't give a shit anyway. It would just give her tracking capabilities which is useful but not a complete deterrent.
---
I just tried to upvote the picture

Bioshock themed chapter?! Sign me the fuck up!
---
/s so i dont get called illiterate.
---
because this community is shit c:
---
i don't think theres any tracking from her or chainsaw. people dont play as plague very often so its not too big a deal. teh balance is in that you can heal completely and quickly at the heal-stations (that they had in ancient babylon)
---
It depends on the ranks really. If the survivors don't loop well, the Plague will do well but if they can, the Plague kind of just gets shit on.
---
&gt;You can stop no one escapes death from coming into the game.
---
In my opinion, such a power shouldn't have to be prevented by the survivors but earned by the killer.
---
I am still in mourning :(
---
Oh man! So it's likely to be Jane this week and David / Jake next week?
---
hehe stealth chainsaw. i wonder if they hear the chainsaw during the stealth walk. they really should have a mode of 2 killers vs 6-8 survivors
---
Wonder if nurse is nervous that she's gonna lose the only place in "S" teir?
---
Tunneling is even more efficient. 1 person out of the game in a short time. So fun .......
---
No perk description=downvote /s
---
That list needs to be fixed. 
---
It still describes "hatch standoff" as a thing, explains "gen rushing" as "survivors working on objective" (which is true, but we all know what real players are using this term for), and "farming" is only referred to as "survivors and killer cooperating to get bloodpoints", but not "survivors attempting unneeded and dangerous hook saves to gain points and WGLF stacks". 
---
The name "Williams" is spelled with "e".
---
The list has "P1/P2/P3" described as "Prestige1/.../3", but no word about what the heck a "Prestige" is.
---
The list tells that  "Ruin is a commonly used abbreviation for Hex: Ruin", while "Ruin" is clearly not an abbreviation.
---
Also I think that perks like "DWM", "WoO" and "MYC" are not, well, that common to be placed into the "common terms" list.
---
Don't have any expectations
---
Hag for Ruin and LF for bbq.
---
the most obvious choice is cannibal for his bbq perk. if you just unlock that perk, before you had a chance to unlock much others, you can get it easily for every killer
---
Darn, they didn't kiss :(
---
Yeah I had one that I was mori'ing cause I love the animation. Mid way he dc'd and shouted victory in the chat. I'm just like 'I liked the animation, it continued' lol
---
and when i show funny post game chats it gets removed... feels bad man
---
she can't use it. Some how we have been able to make this bug happen.
---
So? you get also a shit ton of hits that should've hit but missed.
---
It‚Äôs not. Amazing combo
---
Damn you smacked your head TWICE?
---
Self care? This isn‚Äôt 2016.
---
OP also panned the camera to their perks for a second to show bloodwarden is being used
---
to explain, I had to get into a locker because I got a phone call and I came back to see the pallet destroyed so I recorded the last minute.
---
why does my postgame chat always get removed but some don't?
---
Always there for my poor tunneled survivor friends.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter though does it. Without the bos you‚Äôd get 5k, now you get 10k and probably even more let‚Äôs be real. It‚Äôs a nice bonus
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
I guess but its hard to hide or give her the slip or even loop her while she can just throw up like she can. Idk if its a perk but she attacks me after infected. I'm a one shot full health and I'm usually okay at dodging killers attacks but ive not once been able to dodge hers
---
Yet it‚Äôs the most used perk?
---
I encountered 3 Suvivor with Neon clothes (2Nea 1 Ace) and they thought they were the best. Instant DC after first down. So annoying and all 3 of them got 2k+ hours. So fun.
---
AFAIK you don't get a discount on DLC after unlocking characters via shards.
---
Looks like a couple downvotes there. Guess we know where they fall. ;D
---
Ouch my ears!... i think i have to go to an doctor....
---
I feel if the cool down and warping to gens is small he will most likely be S tier plus if the snare is good also he could although this is a stretch S+ tier I don't see him being s+ as happening or S but he will most likely be Aish B-ish tier
---
Everyday we stray further from god
---
Only if you didn't enter the trial with that item
---
There 's  more progression on DBD, and more content so I'll pick that. But deathgarden is super fast paced, love the soundtrack, it's amazing
---
No, why?
---
DLC will still be full proce
---
Only if they have a skin for Charlie's yellow suit. "That little boy was meeee"
---
No i don't
---
Or Dennis. He is very methodical.
---
I'm guessing this is a lame attempt at a troll because no sane person would call streetwear from a different country cultural appropriation. with that logic we'd all be wearing amorphous sacks
---
Plague is pretty weak tbh.
---
Her vomit doesnt slow you, it builds up on a timer you can see (add ons can make this instant) into making you broken/injured, then she can hit you to down you. Her vomit is completely useless on you once youre broken for the most part unless you cleanse and she gets the blood vomit that can actually injure you.
---
Theres no tracking on it and she can only see exactly where you are if she has the add on that lets her know when your character does the vomit animation.
---
I'd like to say "No" but the leaker also mentioned that these banners were sequentially numbered and he placed the banner in the order of the sequence so I'm afraid the answer is "Yes". 
---
Maybe they felt it is better to release this collection closer to the double bloodpoint event where more people will be playing than usual?
---
The thing about the word "legitimate" is that it's far too close in concept to "viable" when defending it.
---
I could, for example, take a wheelbarrow full of marbles and dump them all over a floor. Ten thousand marbles. I could then legitimately transfer those marbles by picking one at a time, running it two miles down the road, and running two miles back. I could repeat this for each of those ten thousand marbles, it'd take awhile, but not a lifetime even at one a day.
---
But that's not really a viable way to deliver ten thousand marbles that are already nicely gathered in a container ready to pour into a crate or something and load into a car.
---
Similarly, camping is not a particularly viable way to secure a kill, it's "available", but it slows down how quickly you actually get a kill (usually) as represented by putting survivors through hook states - both in general (downing someone else within 60\~ seconds) and compared to generators completed; camping is a strategy generally used by the impatient, but if you have two generators left and three people on their death hook, you've reached three kill potential faster than someone camping ever would.
---
And of course without an instant-down camping against prepared survivors is still pretty bad, you're usually gonna have to hit people to drive them off, giving them Mettle of Man for free, which will then be used for a clutch Borrowed Time save.
---
This is why Leatherface is the notorious camper - his chainsaw doesn't miss just because it hit hook-immunity (though "hook immunity" really sucks for M1 killers who are trying to stop a rescue, regardless of whether they tunneled) and goes on long enough to down both players, making him better than even Hillbilly at it (since Hillbilly can be baited into a bad chainsaw). The other killers just can't viably camp unless they get lucky with a grab...
---
This is one of my favorite posts ever. Thank you.
---
They're boring.
---
If there are 2 survivors left, and one of them does absolutely nothing, I‚Äôll make sure they don‚Äôt get off that hook and give the over one the hatch
---
I started with Billy too! The more you chainsaw the better you 'll becomeeeeeeeeeeee
---
M1 - the killer's basic attack
---
M1 Killer - a killer whose power is not capable of downing survivors
---
careful, r/dbdgonewild might get you!!!!
---
well you must be God's super killer or going against bad survivors. I doubt it's your skill bc even the killer mains with thousands of hours agree with what I said and I myself am a rank 1 huntress main with over 1000 hours in her alone. No matter how good you are as a killer, if you play survivors who are at equal skill level (not rank but skill level), you're at a huge disadvantage as a killer. You have comms, swf, maps, and so on going against you. 
---
As for deliverance, yea, if you're the first one down. But the chances of that happening and you dying when you're in a swf comms is uncommon COMPARED to you actually getting to use it. we can always talk about wasted perks. Ruin, NOED, and other perks or wasted perks but if you're in comms swf, it's easy for your friend to say, "Hey he's chasing xyz. Come pull me" or "take a hit for me" and then get saved into using delieverance, I see it all the time. MoM does buy you 5 secs but if you can use those 5 secs to get to a pallet, loop, throw down a pallet, and run to the next one, and even take extra hits so the killer has to hit you to move you from a hook. Why do all top killer mains say MoM is worse than old ruin? Scottjund, Umbra, Tofu, Coconut, Zubat, and everyone has said it publicy. 
---
What a lot of people don't understand is that time is on the survivor's side. Killer fights to buy time. All I am saying is it's hard to buy time when even though you make the correct play and get the hit, they have too many safety nets. 
---
as for DH, I don't struggle with it. Thankfully, it's the easiest perk to counter but it sucks when you're the huntress like me and you get countered by it bc again, I caught them and made the right move but they can deadhard your 100% accurate hatchet. You can say, "well walk up and M1 him." True, but I am trying to hit him before he goes to Pig tree and dry humps that loop.
---
As for DS, I shouldn't have to play a certain way to counter it IF I found them first and the other person who pulled them isn't there. What am I supposed to do? Down them and let them go? That just buys more time but it's what I do. That's the problem. And that skillcheck is free as fuck to hit who we kidding? Especailly on PC. Hell, I hit 80% of my ruins skill checks on PC bc of no lag/ping.
---
Btw, I said I was a survivor main. I still play survivor a little bit but it's too easy so it's boring. I have been a killer main for over a year now with over a thousand hours in huntress. I think I know a thing or two. 
---
The Haddonfield comment comes from Umbra, Zubat, Angrypug, Scottjund, Jen Denise, Coconut, and Tofu. They said it numerous times on their streams. Umbra and Scottjund D/C if they get haddonfield.
---
Thanks for the input!  The idea with distressing is to make it more useful for terror radius builds that a lot of killers have (even wraith has one believe it or not).  It‚Äôs not meant to be a neutral game perk but one used in tandem with some killer specific addons to produce a potent effect.
---
PWYF should make you lose one stack after downing a survivor or hitting the obsession.  That sounds better
---
Also looks amazing!!!!!
---
That's a little different when the exit gates are open/in EGC/all five generators done, though.
---
The type of camping we're talking about is like catching someone when a generator hasn't popped (or only one, perhaps) and sticking them in the basement and standing in the stairs for two minutes so no one can rescue, and the killer had BBQ&amp;C (checked at endgame) so saw all of us on generators.
---
Though even BBQ&amp;C isn't an indicator survivors are close if they climb into lockers, but still.
---
It's knowing no survivors are within 40 meters and knowing exactly where they are and still camping. Or not knowing they're in the area and deciding to camp anyway, etc.
---
Dude it's a part of the fucking game and it's your fault for being in a spot where they can get a flashlight save
---
So do you DC against spirit in general or just against prayer beads spirit?
---
Legit? Probably the new rift area.
---
I also want to know why this clip makes you laugh
---
i hooked someone and had to poop really bad so i proceeded to "face camp" them. by the time they had been unhooked lol so it was all good
---
Hmm I think she might of had that perk because whenever I would try to break away she'd always find me before I Cleanse. I just dont know how to verse that
---
Theres no nudity so I don't really see why they would lol but thanks
---
What you don't already have from the dlc
---
Thanks!
---
inb4 momma myers
---
Sometimes when ur right behind ppl and hold m1 to lunge you will miss even if they just beeline, probably due to lag, I don't dodge laggy survivors.
---
"When they want you to do a yank meme but you turn it into a shitty Legion meme"
---
An additional cosmetic piece for survivor.
---
There's no reason to buy DLC, if you unlocked one/both characters with shards. It's cheaper than buying with auric cells, though.
---
Get BBQ from leatherface (cannibal)
---
I try without addons its really fokin hard. Those gens just going one after another jesus... But with atoxic respiration and catatonic boys i able get 3 or 4 kills at this moment.
---
Yeah I might‚Äôve been reaching there, I was just thinking a lot about how killers like trapper and doctor don‚Äôt have much synergy with it since they have to walk everywhere.
---
No. I only condone ‚Äúcamping‚Äù if one or more survivors are around the hook
---
My predictions : 
---
They nerf Mettle of Man ( IF they don't change their mind ).
---
They buff Legion ( or his base kit or his add-ons or both ).
---
They buff some weaker perks ( Slippery Meat, Small Game, Vigil or Boil Over for survivors and Monstrous Shrine, Unrelenting, Iron Maiden or Dark Devotion for killers ).
---
They nerf Blood Warden ( because of EGC and things ).
---
They rework Nurse's add-ons.
---
They nerf Iridescent Head or Prayer Beads Bracelet.
---
These are just my guesses, probably none of them will be true üòù.
---
Why hasn't this got more upvotes
---
She can see you for 5 seconds when she has that add on, so if you think they have it, treat it like BBQ and run in on direction once you do the animation, count 5 seconds, then turn around and go the other way
---
Change David for Dwight and you've got yourself a bargain.
---
&gt; If they teabag after 
---
What if they tbag while you're blinded?
---
No, they‚Äôre very easily avoidable and predictable
---
Haven't seen one of these in awhile.
---
yo thats my outfit and around my hours of gametime. im pretty trash tho i just like being pretty
---
No, but there is a Burger King
---
Not a massive fan of the Jane skin, but adore the David one. Have patiently waited through Legion, Meg, Trapper, Kate, David, Claudette, Hag, Spirit, Adam &amp; Clown... so it's not that much more. 
---
What about the leak for alternative Tapp &amp; Pig skins?
---
This is a rare moment in nature.  Often when these alpha predators meet it leads to a bloody conflict.  Here we see an uncommon occurrence where they embrace in a show of comraderie.
---
Oh shiet
---
Oh I know full well. She wasn't the smartest Spirit.
---
Oh they DC if they get a certain map? Yea I definitely trust their judgement. That‚Äôs BS. And you‚Äôre making the assumption I don‚Äôt also have thousands of hours? Comms are more what ifs. Not every single group you go against is SWF, when I play both killer and survivor, I see the ransoms bring the haddonfield offering and the perks for it and the same stuff will happen to ruin. Anyone can get downed when you‚Äôre in SWF. It‚Äôs the killer who determines that, they go to a certain place on the map, find a certain survivor coz they check certain areas, and chase them. Depending on their skill level the chase can end rather quick regardless of the survivors skill, this game is always dependent on the killer. So perks can become useless anytime. Out of all my own time on this game and the streamers and YouTubers I watch, I have seen deliverance, DS, dead hard, and mettle brought many of times, and used successfully hardly ever. Just coz you get rekt by it doesn‚Äôt mean anything is too good, survivors or perks, or just coz you have to run it or else the game goes too quick doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible to play without it. You‚Äôre not gonna agree with me and I‚Äôm not gonna agree with you. You‚Äôre just pulling shit out of your ass right now to defend your point with ‚Äúeveryone agrees with me‚Äù and ‚Äúkiller main streamers all said what I said‚Äù with no actual evidence and with stuff that‚Äôs easy to disprove. I‚Äôm not gonna go looking at what those people said (mostly coz I personally don‚Äôt think they are good streamers/players) so it‚Äôs irrelevant to me. And it‚Äôs just irrelevant coz this is an OPINION and it can‚Äôt be proven wrong by either of us regardless of what anyone says and who agrees with who. I‚Äôve got shit to do this is an old post now. To sum up, I just think you‚Äôre bad and nothing I can say will change that, or help you become better coz you just keep saying SURVIVORS GOT DEM PERKS AND I NEED RUIN
---
Even in the right spot flashlightsaves arent ez at all to make since the timing is so dumb
---
Trapper confirmed for smash bros. Noice.
---
Actually a cool idea. Also for the fact that farming bloodpoints sucks for survivors
---
Doctor for most bloodpoints and a great pick up n' play killer.
---
Is it just me or did the Claudette appear from thin air
---
Funny thing is that I tried to cross post before you. But automod removed it. I was like oh well I hope someone else posts it.

---
This... Does put a smile on my face...
---
I never said they should nerfed Iri Head, I said they might nerf them in this patch. However, devs already announced that they will rework Iri Head soon.
---
It's called help your fucking team and do gens, I THINK.
---
I like the look of this, but not sure how it would translate to a board game.  I'd be interested in reading the rules/how to play/guide, definitely! :D
---
I love this perk! I hope they'll add more fun/interactives perks like that.
---
They look like the uke and the seme of a yaoi. I hope Jake's skin is buyable with shards.
---
Honestly who teabags after vaulting a pallet anyway?
---
I was playing one last game for tonight, figured I'd play sort of meme-y on a level 28 Plague using Distressing + Contagious Fright even though CF requires an M1 and she tends to be a Corrupt Purge killer instead if at all possible.
---
The Dying Light obsession disconnected and another killed themselves on hook and I just turned down the heat, committed to really bad/long chases just for the lol of it - I mean there's two survivors. I had Corrupt Intervention so I could've three-genned them without any effort whatsoever but I didn't care.
---
Tried to do a chase with the Feng on my shoulder instead of hooking her (she was on death hook, I wasn't actually avoiding putting terror into them) and even after passing hooks and letting her escape my grasp, she still flashlighted and teabagged at the exit gates just because I couldn't down her before she escaped with corrupt purge.
---
It got of made me a teensy bit more tilted than it should have, but I definitely regretted not hooking and killing her - I had her dead to rights on her death hook at a hook when the other survivor wasn't anywhere within 40 meters (they didn't scream due to CF which is a 40 meter range w/ Distressing on) and just... Ugh. People who taunt you, regardless of reason, are incredibly annoying.
---
Good point
---
just leave
---
"Hitboxes are not broken"
---
Head On: hold my beer.
---
Whether camping or tunneling is a strategy or not you still shouldn't do it. It gives survivors so little points a game that it's no point in survivors finishing a game like that when they could play against a killer like me and get 20k easy.
---
It reminds of the no0b3 incident: Doing Gens You?
---
Yea but dbd would become a porn game, now... i dont mind if is the huntress who is getting porned
---
Actually started to notice the stick is kinda broken now. Instead of wiggling it i just do a circular motion. Works fine, and saves my controller
---
Ok
---
I hope she doesn't sound like Luigi.
---
Agreed
---
THE CHOSEN ONE
---
I'm curious as to why it would need to be picked up during the trial. Because I tried to word it such that you don't keep the item either way. If you want to get a BP rebate on your millions of useless maps, I don't see why not.
---
This never was found out /s
---
Now try to find in the temple map
---
I suppose you're right about that - cup half empty, the BPS got wasted, cup half full, you at least get a small boost to ease the camping scars
---
Easy dude get ur 12k bloodpoints and ur stupid 4K no pip and take it dude, 1/5 of the players in the game are enjoying themselves and the survivors get only like 8k bloodpoints for wasted time
---
And if he was hiding for the entire second phase of hook so what? It's not like he had opened gates or another teammates to help with distraction. If he would've to unhook, killer would definitely killed them both. He acted smart. The only thing he did wrong was standing still until raven arrived.
---
Carl reminds me of the truck driver from the Resident Evil remake that eats the cheeseburger.
---
Not so much dead hard because it's pretty useless. 
---
But MOM and D-Strike sure.
---
Should also add when i say dead hard is 'useless' what i mean is once the killer knows you have D-Strike they will probably just wait for you to use it before they swing nullifying the perk.
---
Deal.
---
Well yeah that's pretty srupid 
---
That's most likely because they want to piss survivors off and not even want to win
---
But what devs were trying to say  was  camping to achive a win which is a legit strat and people still kinda shit on them for saying it which is kinda stupid imo

At this point, I blame developers more than players. I don't camp because it's boring and you get fewer points. But it can be a viable strategy because the only counters use perk slots (kindred to inform and bt to give a hope) whereas camping can require 0 perks and enhanced with insidious. If you have an instadown, you can pretty much guarantee a one for one swap.
---
It's a boring ass strategy to get kills (although not bps, and maybe not pips if they are coordinated, although that's fairly true for any strategy) that the developers are allowing to keep viable.
---
Maybe those traps could even make a clone of the killer or possibly allow teleportation too, ah but that'll never happen
---
i think the pupils/irises are also too small
---
Yeah I kinda felt bad but this dude said "well this is rank 8 so what do you expect" dude acted like he was above people
---
Pebble can save a man's whole career and end it.
---
Your gunna have to deal with MOM eventually if you are an M1 killer. I don't usually tunnel anyone. On the hook and onto the next one. 
---
Only exception is if there is a survivor who is wearing bright clothes, has a flashlight and constantly tries to get my attention. I tunnel everyone else. I know I'll be lead around all game so lets get the other guys dead or dying before I tackle them!
---
Invisibility went off
---
Who cares about DS? It‚Äôs literally a perk to protect a survivor from being farmed or camped/tunneled. It‚Äôs not toxic at all. In fact, if it goes off against you a lot you may wanna look at your tactics. Dead hard is easy to counter. MoM is obnoxious, but no reason to be an ass. If this person was being toxic with behavior then fine, tunnel them. But otherwise it sounds like you‚Äôre just trying to justify your own bad behavior.
---
That's a good shout to be fair
---
The scream in question would actually sound like Pewds playing Amnesia
---
If killers tunnel over perks Imma tbag if they have ruin, noed, or bbq.
---
The only valid response to a camping killer is to focus on generators. if you play smart, at most he'll get away with 1k. It's foolish and over-altruistic survivors that end up giving campers 3-4k whenever they try to rush and save at the last minute.
---
I forgot that our names don't match our reddit ones lol but thanks haha
---
Best guess is that that belongs to either the Dad or a handyman.
---
just had a game where I thought I was facing a Baby Dwight, until he pulled out DS, MoM and DH....he didnt live very long after that
---
why cant wii buy friends
---
I usually don't tunnel myself but just mixing all those perks just make me want to tunnel
---
Had the idea to make a suicide squad name change; funnily enough the guy who goes as "suicide" has managed to die in every game. My comp kinda messed up and I was killed super early which totally worked out since our goal was to unscramble our names post game haha.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Well survivirs can enjoy themselves and get more bloodpoints if they don't run to me like brainless chickens 
---
I also don't like camping but in a game which all 4 of them are idiots , i'll choose the easier path and i'll get eay more than 12k ;) they run away and come back so i hit them way more than twiceanf there is a little bit of a chase near hook aswell which means more bloodpoints
---
Bubba has survivor masks though. Meg, Dwight, Jake and Claudette facemasks.
---
If you procc D-strike during The beggining to mid stages, it‚Äôs your fault.
---
Yeah but since I've been playing Freddy (got him P2 today hoping to finish his prestige after Ghostfaces release because I'm going to prestige him fully) it just sucks because I can't counter it at least NOED can be countered. Both NOED and MOM just are horrible perks that shouldn't be in the game but hey at least MOM is getting nerfed.
---
Freddy rework will be leaked.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the best perk. Neither is it a top 4 perk
---
Nurse is hard, but once you learn her you're gonna do well even without addons ;)   
---
Ataxic respiration and catatonic boy's treasure are actually super OP :D
---
actually I think the Change is fair, Hybridpanda claimed he had Information that Safe Hooks count towards the perk as well, which is really nice
---
I fully approve of Legion being such a wholesome icon on this subreddit.
---
You could also save up for Ghostface and Freddy

Yep but it would be harder to get because if you try to bodyblocked you can avoid them you could also smack the hooked one denying them the perk basically and it basically makes it so bad players cant use it as a get out of jail free card. I Just want to see how people would react if they had to deal with the same shit
---
I‚Äôll camp if there‚Äôs survivors just swarming around the hook but if I hook someone and gens keep popping I‚Äôd be dumb to sit there anyway. Looping can be just as irritating though.
---
way she goes, boys, way she goes.
---
What about "useless" medkits/toolboxes/flashlights?
---
I can relate
---
Omg they are so cute I wanna hug them
---
I‚Äôm not going to go out of my way to punish a player for using a perk that was intended to be used. If it‚Äôs such a problem, that‚Äôs something BHVR needs to address. Getting upset because a player used a perk that was intended to be used is just silly.
---
That being said, if they run MoM, they don‚Äôt get the sympathy card from me. What that means is I will not give them hatch or not attack them if a teammate farms them.
---
Their excuse was "he died before the entity could grab him" *points to Amanda, Bill, spirit, and Tapp" I swear they could've at least give a good reason
---
I agree hard af... But its fun, i try play others killers, but with them looks like easy play. Like Wraith (Fast af boi), Huntres (Playing darts), but with the nurse its not enough understand the game, i have to put some time. (Sorry for bad LONDON)
---
yep, agreed on that

---
 My no healing for you clown which was sloppy, Coulrophobia, distressing and nurses calling, ran flask of bleach and Garish Makeup kit. That Clown build was really fun as basically no one could heal at all and if they did they would get downed. Sadly I prestiged him so I need to recollect the perks.
---
Yeah my friend saw someone say "I run ToTH, SF, BS and BBQ" and got lost, thanks!
---
I didn‚Äôt claim you don‚Äôt, you actually have the iq of an ikea table lmao.
---
Don't know about PTB, but on live build BO was never effective.
---
Dew It
---
Should have nodded at each other.
---
Boil over should've honestly changed the speed that survivors wiggled out. Iron grasp wouldve then been uts equal, which is what a game needs for balance. Right now Boil Over is just a bad perk all around
---
Still there are alternate world's It could've taken Carl from so they still could put him in the game plus I mean Tapps Bio said he closed his eyes and awoke kinda hinting he died.
---
r/bettereveryloop
---
Yea the nerve is this meme is tired and spammed ad nauseam with all survivors patting themselves on the back for being so much better than the killers and killers fumbling over themselves to declare that they are one of "the good ones" who dont camp and give hatch and respect the 4%.
---
Where's template for this?
---
Thus it shouldn't be too strong of a change. It's should be enough just to counter a perk. People still use iron grasp or just don't.
---
Boil Over's 10 meter hook blinding for the Killer is just a distraction for you to struggle out. But struggling effects are still flawed right now.
---
My man you've returned, I've missed you!
---
I think it should just be changed to quicker wiggle. Not by 75% obviously, as that's way to fast. But maybe the exact same numbers as Iron Grasp, allowing boil over against iron to just be a normal wiggle. But it doesnt affect the hooks auras or the effect on the killer
---
The Entity will let him die though

You sure you didn't leave before her stuff was visible?

You sir/madam, Made Your Choice.
---
Pig perk: Make Your Choice:

When you unhook someone and the killer is, I believe 28meters, away from the hook you will be exposed for 60 seconds.
---
Ya, there was nothing that I could see
---
*coughing* *sad clown noises*
---
Yes I play leatherface
---
Yes I camp
---
Yes I get a lot of salt
---
This is why I will continue to camp for I require salt to survive
---
Us toxic leatherface mains thrive from extreme salt comments
---
[but seriously I just love watching survivors who KNOW I'm camping but jump into the basement anyway then blame me for their death. It's just funny to me. Now gimme my downvotes!]
---
Noodle arm Meyers.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't the survive with friends option have an effect on this? It's the first thing that comes to mind when I see posts of people upset about the match making. When I was teaching my brother to play he was a rank 20 in a party with a rank 1,4 and an 8. It makes me think about how much control Behaviour really has over situations like that.
---
Its not normal, stop being rude to newcomers
---
We are on a Carl Crusade and no one can stop us
---
What ze actuall fuck... Unless he had some sort of status effect cheat on i can't find something that makes you isnta down without perks
---
And look away if you have to break a pallet? That shit can fuck right off.
---
This is one of the only times where keeping the ‚ÄòBoogeyman or Boogeymen‚Äô part actually makes perfect sense. 
---
Also, I really want that version of ‚ÄòThe Hedge‚Äô to come back again. Fuck that was cool.
---
Damn you guys are going to be so disappointed when Freddy comes out.
---
- Teleporting to Generators is only good for finding survivors; unlike Nurse he's still highly loopable as an M1 Killer.
---
- Placing Traps means he's a killer in the same vein as Trapper and Hag; he has to run around the map prior to actually chasing anyone in order to place those traps.
---
- He has to wait an entire minute in order to even have a power other than be a straight up M1 Killer. Trapper you can place a trap during a chase if you run into someone within the first 10 seconds of the game. Freddy would have to wait 50 seconds for that trap to be relevant anyway.
---
- Freddy can only teleport to Generators, which means if there isn't a Gen next to the hook you've used you're going to have to walk back to it again.
---
Freddy is going to be a solid B tier killer. Nothing more.
---
It really do be like that  a l l  times
---
oh god people are idiots sometimes on this sub.
---
i'm sorry it happened, mate. this is, unfortunately, something we all suffer every once in a while. 
---
i went to sleep yesterday with rank 3 and 4 pips there. in the morning i played four games - two depips because killers dc midgame and one cause i failed. so still rank 3 with 1 pip. then i started loading into 5th game, someone disconnected on loading screen, i went on character menu and it was 4 with 2 pips so....
---
Empty slots for literally everything (including add-ons and offerings)?  
---
If that's the case, let me ask you a silly question: Did you waited for the game to end? (all survivors escape/die)  
---
You won't be able to see his/her perks/add-ons/offerings until that happens
---
Yea I guess, just like how every survivor has to accept spirit fury and enduring. Survivors have a lot of perk bs they have to deal with, killer can too. I'm not just being some toxic survivor main saying "oh this game only benefits killer." I just think the games pretty busted in general and killer perks are much more useful than survivor perks. Like I keep hearing killers complain about decisive but for what? I got pulled off hook with tier 3 decisive and the killer tunneled me but I looped long enough for decisive strike to run out. So I ended up being punished for outplaying?
---
Its alright. I'm just gonna grind it again
---
I have come to accept that, if I go down by a leatherface near the basement, then the camp is fine. He caught me slipping.
---
Show?
---
She has to infect to fully so as you become broken(injured and can't heal). After that she gets looped till daylight, she's not really strong.
---
You probably went to the score screen before the killer left the match. Killers stuff is hidden until the match is over since a few patches ago, so that swf can't tell each other what perks and stuff the killer has once one is dead
---
Hug me Daddy...
---
This. I've never seen a 4k with polite survivors.
---
But what about iron grasp and anticipation leatherface where he will carry you halfway across the map into the basement
---
I thought theyd smooch ngl
---
oink
---
Shortly to describe that meta perks should be nerf one or two points.
---
And NOT at an immense rate. The fact that PTB is just fixing the main problems or fixes them after PTB is just amusing. Not to mention small things slip away and making it not so fun experience.
---
Rushing everything.
---
The range of it is pretty far or shes just quick cause she was constantly getting me while I was zig zagging through obstacles and droppimg pallets and still somehow got me no matter what I did
---
oh dang. forgot constructive part.
---
so thing is sometimes game fails to save progress at some point. might have been your connection or game servers. it happens a lot and pretty often to all players. so don't worry, that's kind of normal. but if you lose a lot sometimes, as in literally a day of progress, submit a ticket to support.deadbydaylight.com 
---
they might compensate if they are able to track it.
---
I am surprised no one gets this, he is obviously lying/joking. I've done it myself back in the days,the reactions in the chat were quite funny
---
Cringe so hard
---
you still run it on plague because no one heals
---
what an incel loser! Go back to forever alone!
---
MoM won‚Äôt either
---
Grey offerings always flip though
---
I've always thought the games health would be better if the devs decided to skip a chapter in place of fixing bugs and balance issues. Yes thered be a lack of content for a few months, but I feel like long term players would appreciate it in the long run. It would only be super new players that haven't fully experienced the issues with this game that would be upset for the most part.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt played the game if you haven‚Äôt lost progress. It is normal. Stop being a little suck up bitch.
---
Definitely looked like you didn‚Äôt do that on purpose at first but upon further review.. that was amazing
---
I can relate too this really badly
---
This looks similar to a horror con I was at the other weekend.
---
Oh ya... I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm a little dumb lol
---
THE KILLER CAN CLOSE THE HATCH?????
---
its groaning storehouse
---
&gt; but I feel like long term players would appreciate it in the long run.
---
I've heard from a lot of streamers with 1k+ hours that skipping a chapter would hurt the game. So not only new players would be upset.
---
Yeah man I feel ya..
---
A younger version of karen
---
Im color blind and have trouble finding the scratch marks already. Corn field is hell.
---
New account just to come post this? Nice bait.
---
The best way to learn math. Thanks!
---
It would hurt the game. But that's what I mean. It would hurt the game in the way that no one new wants to play a game that isnt getting new content. (Games like dbd at least). At the same time, people who dont have the time in the game arent devoted enough to it to stay when too long is taken for a chapter to come out. I more mean players that have 1000+ hours would prefer to see everything fixed and rebalanced than a new killer for the most part
---
What do you mean? They literally put on the paid pass you can get it for iridescent shards or pay for it. Plus you literally don't have to buy it if it really annoys you that much but for me I'm buying it because I have nothing to do really besides prestiging the killers I play which is only 1(2 after Ghostfaces release) you are blowing this way out of proportion then it actually is. I think each tome(season) can also be revisited which is nice. Just because they won't to add something that encourages you to play doesn't make them Greedy and evil.
---
they do against me
---
......I think I see the problem.
---
I see the abbreviation "RNG" used every so often. I would like to know what it means and perhaps it should be added?
---
This is why freddy is the best killer, every map looks the same and corn is an advantage for you.
---
Tbf some of the terms are kinda stupid.
---
I had to think really hard to realize its Brutal Strenght and Spirit Fury, and I consider myself an experienced player.
---
It's hell without colour blindness I cant imagine what it must be like for you.
---
I‚Äôve played since the beta buddy. You clearly haven‚Äôt played 1k hours if you haven‚Äôt experience bugs like that. And stfu abt attitude who do you think you are, you ain‚Äôt shit.
---
Me spinning and swinging like a dumbass while they watch from just behind the corn.
---
It's not based on the terror radius anymore because if you use iridescent button you will not be able to see everyone's position on the map not affected by Deep world
---
Random Number Generator
---
Well no shit. I stated that I just started this game yesterday.
---
Because Brenda deserves the spot more. I mean can't go wrong with a parody movie character who has some of the best and hilarious quotes lol
---
Like you never engage in self love
---
I'll give you the short version, but basically in terms of game design the visual design of each character plays a huge subliminal role in how you play a given role.
---
So yes every survivor can learn every perk, but after enough matches you learn that megs run, nea sneak walks, David stands up to the killer, dwight will run at the first sign of danger (but can be a real hero in a clutch), ace is a wild card and so on.
---
Survivor: Self Care, No mither, Object of obession, Distortion.
---
I just adjust my camera to move in the direction its forcing me. Super easy imo.
---
One thing you'll come to realize is that people throw terms like camping, tunneling, gen rushing all the time. Doesn't mean that they know the meaning of those words themselves. Or they do, but they're wrong and are just throwing a fit.
---
&gt; I more mean players that have 1000+ hours would prefer to see everything fixed and rebalanced than a new killer for the most part
---
And that's not the case for streamers I talked about. They are fine with the pace of balance changes and bug fixes and don't want to wait 6 months for a new chapter. So not all veterans are the same.
---
Ok so I'm sitting here reading ur comments to get a better understanding of why u don't like MoM. I've got this to say in order to add to my other comment, u say MoM isn't counterable but there's 2 ways that it is. Firstly u could just use insta-downs perks like Make Your Choice or Haunted Grounds. Secondly u could just ignore the MoM user until the end that way they can't be unhooked let alone tank 3 hits in order to get MoM. As for that "bad players" statement about using MoM, I mean the same could be said about NoED, that's a way bigger get out of jail free card than MoM, they both reward the players for being bad. MoM rewards players for getting hit too much and NoED rewards players for not getting kills. But at the same time punishes the opposing side. MoM punishes killer for Tunneling the person a little too much. And NoED punishes survivors for not cleansing totems. Both perks are trash imo and both need nerfed simple as that
---
The PTB is today, but it's not live yet.
---
ü§£üíÄ you right
---
In a couple of hours
---
*loses all sexual desire and immediately becomes a nun*
---
Weird flex but ok
---
While it's a nice move on the killer's part, he's by no means obligated to do so and you should be more angry at the survivor that decided to unhook you in front of him(unless he was camping. nobody likes a camper).
---
That's why I said for the most part. I know not everyone would be happy with it, but almost every  veteran youtuber or streamer I watch wants the game to be fixed soon. Not like they'd stop playing out of no where if it wasn't, but they certainly wouldn't complain if it was all of the sudden fixed in a few months
---
This startled me
---
Freddy deff gonna be S-tier after the update
---
Nah I find it petty in my opinion
---
I much prefer to use my instaheal on other survivors, it's so satisfying to see the killer look at me like 'wtf did you just do?' 
---
Then I get chased lol
---
No exact time, but it is today. Just be patient, maybe take a nap or watch a movie while you wait.
---
no it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs a tactical use now
---
Is when a survivor dies and its your fault not his
---
it should be in a couple of hours
---
Excessive, but excellent execution!
---
that was a awesome juke , wp! and i hate to be that guy, but thats not even close  to being a 360
---
I get DCs when I'm not even near people.  They see the skill checks and inefficiency and just DC.  Slugs I kinda get
---
Probably 11am-12pm like most update times. I say update because even though it‚Äôs not straight to main game, business / game devs like to do tuesdays or Thursday‚Äôs for updates (whether its ptb or actual in game patch) and around 11am-12pm PST
---
nice ui
---
One of my favourite animes
---
Don‚Äôt forget you can use Billy‚Äôs or leather faces chainsaw, legions fury, trappers traps, huntress hatchets, plagues vomit on a survivor and it won‚Äôt count as a hit for MOM so many ways around MOM

I would add Hag to that as well. Idk how she's on console, but a lot of people are sleeping on her and even calling her bottom tier. Since the trap setting buff you can just pop one down in the middle of a chase at a pallet and if you get a hook in the basement the game slows down so hard since they have to crouch around if they don't wanna get smacked.
---
Probably 11am-12pm pst

Ehh there are so many ways around MOM and so many perks that can counter MOM

You dont need to boycott anything. Just dont buy it. If the majority of playera are with you, they will do the same, and then the company gets punished for the bad movement . Really you dont need being a doctor on economics to understand that.

Okay, camping is stupid and flashlight saves are fair and acceptable. But your argument here is stupid, because the exact same things could be said about camping. It is too part of the game, and it's just as "your fault for being there in the first place" as flashlight saving. Camping isn't worse than flashlight saving because it isn't a part of the game, nor because both sides don't have a play in letting it happen; it's worse because flashlight saving doesn't force someone to stop playing the game.
---
why is the stereotype of Leatherbutt that he is a face camper? I usually, at rank 7, get a 4 man within just a couple minutes, without camping once and i have never face camped?
---
They could also make it so when you struggle the killer's movement speed is reduced, like a reverse Agitation.
---
It's not invisible, it's under the ground, happened to me as well.
---
All of your points are valid and I enjoyed reading that. I hope you don't face me anytime soon because, while I love playing those killers, I do understand your dislike for them. I wish you luck in the fog otherwise my guy.
---
causes the killer to instantly orgasm every 60/50/40 seconds.
---
Good job
---
You unlock perks at random. But you‚Äôll end up finding better perks the more you level up your characters. If your talking about teachables then you can unlock them at levels 30, 35, and 40 for both killers and survivors. And as a killer main, it‚Äôs both fun and annoying but we get through it
---
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps....
---
It's badly coded, that's why? Instead of cleaning it up, they stack patches upon patches on top of each other. It's why on PC it's so high demanding as well and the graphics aren't that great.
---
youbassumed correct
---
Oh to dream.
---
Yes that would be nice
---
Considering the fact it literally has less then 50 people in its playground, it sucks at doing that
---
No, but I may break a chase to go after someone with a flashlight.

I agree
---
The funny thing is the outfit is just a denim jacket and a pink shirt and skirt lmao this user is just a boring troll.
---
Actually, I find legion is a killer more akin to pig.
---
His power gives him great first hit potential, tracking, and some stall.
---
Pig also has first hit potential, stall, but instead of tracking she has more endgame potential.
---
Dare I say Legion is better than pig because his stall isn't RNG based, and he can get the first hit of a chase guaranteed. Compared to pig who needs to stealth, and can get seen.
---
Yea, Pig can use her ambush to maybe get a second hit, but she still has to go through the first hit to get there. Her traps are RNG based and can waste no time, or a considerable amount of time, so they are either a little better than legion stall, or considerably worse.
---
Legion's ability is to be able to injure multiple survivors, and force them to waste time mending. Legion will get the first hit in a chase pretty easily, you are going to loop him injured. He also has synergy with thanataphobia for extra time wasting.
---
Being able to down everyone in what is essentially one hit is a stronger ability than most people give credit for.
---
I cannot speak for Playstation, but with Xbox's backwards compatibility program plus Dead by Daylight's addition to the GamePass, I can see it sticking around on the next gen Xbox.
---
I think it will of Dead by Daylight keeps doing well.
---
Wich I'll have to see on how the community will react to what's coming.
---
Once again, Dead hard is very easy to counter and MoM is simply an annoying perk. Killers use the exact meta perks as well, just as survivors do. Most killers use ruin, spirit fury + enduring, and barbecue or NOED if they can‚Äôt get kills themselves. While MoM is very annoying, 9/10 times it won‚Äôt make the difference between you winning a match versus losing. And it certainly isn‚Äôt a reason to be toxic.

I'd hide in a locker with Dwightta any day

Both

Why do people make these posts?   It's still morning for a lot of people (and for BVHR).  The day isn't about to end.  Updates usually come out at 11 am EST.
---
I just wanna play the nerdy botanist but no im toxic because i use a legacy cosmetic, I genuinely like Claudettes character and im put in the mixing bowl with blendettes who try their best to play immersed. 
---
No really stop using those brown cosmetics!!!!!!!! please
---
except idc about carl? Tf?
---
It doesn't seem like the nerf they planned for it was that heavy
---
Wut?
---
I need this as a wallpaper omg
---
Ps5 has backwards compatible
---
Play killer with BBQ and offerings.
---
Well game was free on Playstation so... And who cares don't like it don't pay just like the new killers they released don't like them don't pay. I will be definitely paying for the battle pass "Really Now "
---
I'm pretty sure 11pm EST but I don't remember exactly.
---
Play doctor, he's a bloodpoint machine. When playing him don't focus on actually killing people.
---
- find them for free 200 chaser points
---
- shock them and tier them up for free deviousness points
---
- kick gens and hit survivors for brutality
---
-if possible, hook survivors for sacrifice points, try to hook everyone once, every first hook gives you 200 extra 'caught' points
---
If you focus on shocking and finding survivors you will easily max out both deviousness and chaser categories which grants you 16k free bp every game. Hooks and hits aren't even taken in consideration.
---
Try to unlock the 'distressing' perk on doctor to max out deviousness faster. If you have 'BBQ and Chili' unlocked, try going for that as well
---
üòÖ I'm gonna step away from this comment üòÇ
---
Yup
---
It was an obvious joke that flew over everyones head lol. It's literally impossible for me to hold rank 1 if all I do is facecamp. I will only ever facecamp someone if they teabag me because that shit hurts my feelings :)
---
Killers also have Devour Hope, haunted ground, make your choice, surveillance, if ur Huntress you have iron maiden, Discordance, Franklin's, corrupt intervention, bamboozle,
---
"remember killers are having a boring ass game too" yeah but they decided to do that. The survivor counter is also to be boring without wanting to.
---
Seeing the killer is the problem... You had to stop working on a gen and go over to the hook and find him. That alone is a win for the killer, especially if all 3 other survivors do it, hence the need for a reveal before leaving the gen. 
---
"what have they done about loops" they've removed a lot of loops or added Los blockers for mind gaming (did you not noticed the changes on farm maps?), They removed pallet vacuums that gave a free loop, added killers whose powers shut down loops (clown, spirit, legion, even plague to an extent), changed hag/trapper to make it easier for them to shut down loops, and they're reworking old maps. How have you missed this? Some are still around (haddonfield) but it's been markedly improved. Sorry to say you don't seem to understand what looping does and doesn't do...
---
Best way to survive? Weird way to say it... Some maps have some good loops but a good killer won't let you get there and will ditch you for someone else once you get there (this is kinda killer 101). It's a great way to stall for time but you won't survive a chase unless you break los. Looping certainly doesn't guarantee a win... Camping does guarantee a kill. Not sure what you call a win (I go by 20k bp before BBQ).
---
Bringing up perks for camping (which don't always help) is kind of like saying looping isn't a problem because of perks like bamboozle, fire up etc.
---
This would be a funny ass perk to run and I would do it just because lmao. Put that with Spine Chill and maybe get an extra 2/3% speed and it might be a viable totem cruncher build of sorts.
---
There are a bunch of posts like this please check for already answered questions :/
---
Although that Danny Devito face is somewhat terrifying to see in this form lol
---
I don't know how thats possible, this meme is literally posted every week.
---
It stands for "Random Number Generator", but it's frequently used to descibed something as luck-based. For example, trying to collect high-quality items out of a chest is RNG, because you have no/very little control over the result
---
Must have been a pain in the ass, good job!
---
MoM iS bAlAnCeD.
---
Cowards...

The salt must flow.

Allows you to throw trash in order to distract the killer

You could just spill your drink over it so it will cool down instantly
---
But this is hag levels of map pressure. Hag is... kinda eh. She isnt bad but she isnt nearly as good as spirit Billy and nurse
---
Hi guys, this was a little project i made of some funny chases and moments. Keep in mind that im still a rookie when it comes to editting, and im nowhere near as good as some of the top streamers, but i sure had fun. Anyways, let me know what you think, feedback is much appreciated.
---
She who walks behind the rows?
---
*Laughs in PC.*
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be able to broadcast all totem locations for everyone, or find the hatch
---
A freaking pebble
---
So I just realized, why doesn't the nurse have an ultra rare add-on that makes her blinks silent? That way she would at least have one ultra-rare add-on. my nurse is level 50 and I noticed that you get an ebony Mori out of every single blood web because there is nothing else of that rarity that you can get for her
---
Tabletop Simulator Plugin? :D
---
I want to play DBD on my PC. There's no other way pls
---
you were running mettle and you only got one gen done. he absolutely destroyed you, meaning he deserved the 4k.
---
Why would anyone want to use these?
---
I'd buy it
---
It cost them only a couple of hundred hours in working time. Which is nothing, sure dude.
---
You need to watch more Drake and Josh.
---
Yea and I used task manager to make sure everything with steam was closed before I logged back in.
---
Seems normal.
---
adrenaline is a bad perk overal.. borrowed time is a much more useful replacement
---
What was chat like after they died during blood warden?
---
Works louder than a washing machine
---
Mikey
---
not working dude :(
---
So i guess i didn't understand what you meant in the previous comment
---
Just for fun or maybe to taunt players
---
Ya'll some ugly niggas lol.
---
I dont mind it. One of my best killer games of all time was on that map.
---
Sure the houses are a bit annoying, but survivors always hide in the same spots, so it's not a huge deal.
---
I think the prevailing theory with the new SAW cosmetics is that they'll come out with or around the same time Ghostface goes live.
---
Verify your game cache
---
I had no idea hat FF was.. turns out ts Flip Flop
---
Ok.
---
Really? I‚Äôm surprised. I usually just get DC‚Äôs and ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äùs.
---
In my experience Wraith is the most loyal killer. Once he hooks you, he never leaves your side.
---
Good job my man!  Remember that people are gonna get salty and it's a 4-on-1 situation by default so my advice is just 'gg', wait for their ggs and then leave.  If they wanna be salty and cuss you out just leave it cuz the important part is you have fun rather than let them ruin your time!
---
Hope to see you in the fog sometime!
---
I just got all trophies on ps4 a few weeks ago. How many trophies are linked to Bill? Is it the regular 3 or just the adept? Congrats tho man welcome to the 100%club
---
I know my build will get crushed by LAN parties, but even with top shelf perks it will **still** be a heavy challenge to best them. I rather play for fun and use my waifu perks such as best for last, bloodhound, and shadowborn tyvm.
---
i tried that one too i even reinstalled game still not working
---
Steam says your online and everything right? I forced closed steam with task manager and when I logged back in it got rid of this error for me. Have you tried resetting your computer?
---
You done great. as a ghostface fan... I approve this
---
I was first introduced to these weirdoes by a WoW machinima. Good memories.  Always updoot Carl.
---
Thanks Friend!
---
I was quite close to losing actually, caught the last guy trying to open the door after I closed the hatch
---
Yo congrats dude
---
Leather face has shit that actually doesn't work which gives me the big sad
---
I'll counter your final sentence: he's out of F tier so that's AMAZING for the Freddy players already. Even if his rework somehow sucks and he's **just** B tier, that's still better than always being dead last. However, consider this.
---
1. You can find survivors, but you can also find which gens need to be kicked, especially with perks like Pop Goes and Overcharge. If they come out with an add-on like Wraith and Legion have, he could see what gen progress is and teleport. Also, Tinkerer on Freddy would be super meta, as he would be able to either walk or teleport to a gen, one with big indication and instant results, or no indication and slow but startling results. Even without add-ons can't cross map a Tinkerer notification'd gen if it's far enough away.
---
2. With the way the snares work, it is likely you can be like a Hag and just place them at a loop to cut it off or weaken it so much it's useless, making survivors have to chose between a hit or a hit but sooner.
---
3. Even outside of Dream abilities, the distance flicker outside of sleep is amazing for mindgames on certain loops, crucial on an M1 killer. In the Dream, he has fake pallets and snares, so it's a bit like a Morton's Fork there. 
---
4. BBQ. That's all I'mma say right there.
---
5. Not mentioned, but the map pressure is so strong. Seriously, imagine going from one side of Azarov's to the other in 5 seconds. Not even Billy can do that without the Engravings. Also, remember, you can cancel the teleport mid-charge, so really, you could fake out and force survivors off of gens. This can buy you precious seconds in the match, and also make survivors extremely paranoid as the match goes on. Fucked up a skillcheck? He may or may not be coming for you. That blood could be a red herring, or a red warning. 
---
6. Also, think of the possibilities. You can lock down loops near gens, keep a good eye on totems (especially thanks to TOTH), and gen locking will never be easier. With I'm All Ears, if a survivor gets startled by your generator teleport, you can see which way they're going if they do a fast vault. That's a bit niche, but also think of all the other opportunities involved with teleporting. 
---
7. Remember, Nurse, Billy, and Spirit all have VERY loud indications that they're coming your way, and directional notifications too. Freddy just spurts blood out of the gen and slowly fades into existence. So you don't know if he's faking you out until it's too late. Plus, he could also pull a big brain move and use that very sneakily on certain loops, like the one near the crane on Autohaven maps, giving you free hits or mindgames. 
---
I think Freddy is going to be A tier not from sheer power, but sheer skill ceiling. It'll be even higher than it is now, but the skill cap will be so much more rewarding. Much like Spirit, he will likely rely heavily on mindgames...but also like Spirit, he'll be both fun *and* viable.
---
Like... don't you want to jump in a lake when you see your reflection in it? It's just... so beatiful.
---
your mom
---
Maybe a fanart
---
Funny way of spelling Deathgarden hehehe, They made the game aton more fun with the remake and its definatly worth hopping in.
---
The hag?
---
Oooh interesting, thank you very much for clearing that up!
---
The funny thing is, that‚Äôs genuinely been my experience with Plagues more than any other killer. They‚Äôve given the most second chances if they get cheap hits or find someone trying to hide in a corner.
---
Vommy Mommy is wholesome AF.
---
You're welcome
---
U know what, i give it up. There is literally no point trying to explain what an asshole move that is. I bet youre the kind of player that says the same to camping and tunneling. ''a completely valid tactic''. Literally no sense talking
---
Yeah, I know, he‚Äôs really good at gathering info and with his 4.6 buff and long lunge hitbox, I think he‚Äôs pretty fun to play. I‚Äôm never even toxic, and I always get shit for playing him in endgame chat, yet everyone says he‚Äôs the lowest tier, which is hella confusing too
---
Someone called him Carl the Cashier as a reply to the announcement tweet so people have been calling him that ever since

It‚Äôs been confirmed that PS5 has backwards compatibility and cross play with PS4 users. There shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, at least for the first couple years of the PS5.
---
It depends on the survivors you‚Äôre facing. Some teams will throw the match in an attempt to save their team mate, but if they‚Äôre not that altruistic they‚Äôll just let you tunnel the guy to death and do gens completely uninterrupted and by the time he‚Äôs dead, the other three will be opening the gates. Especially if the guy you tunnel is a good runner. Sometimes tunnelling isn‚Äôt a bad play but doing it blindly will start to lose you matches at a certain point.
---
So? You're running Urban. Not like you're the type of person to last long in a chase anyway.
---
Every single time I've been facecamped it's been by Leatherface. I genuinely do not understand it, except I guess it might be because his power allows him to hit multiple survivors at once?
---
I can't wait. I have good expectations.
---
Tunnelling is going after the unhooked survivor all the time, even leaving chases to return to hook to do so. Tunnelling is an efficient (the unhooked survivor is already injured, and often located within an area of the map the pallets of which have been depleted in the chase that led to them getting hooked in the first place) and effective (taking survivors out of the game as soon as possible creates a lot more winnable situations) strategy, and in regions where your average survivors actually repair generators and are capable of surviving chases for more than 30 seconds, such as the Korean region, this is a perfectly valid and at times even necessary strategy to employ. What you will often find in other regions however, is that your average survivors barely repair generators with any diligence and barely last 30 seconds in chases. A good killer can maintain a high winning rate in many of the games they will have against random survivors, without employing this strategy, and it yields more points and a better playing experience for everyone involved.
---
I tend to go out of my way not to tunnel or camp in most of my games, playing for chases or to make other strategies work instead, but sometimes you know the survivors you are facing, or otherwise find out that they won't be appreciative that you play nice, that they will do gens efficiently and are capable of leading chases well enough, that they won't make stupid mistakes and stupid decisions like so many random survivors do - in those scenarios, if you want to have a real game, employing the strategies of camping, tunnelling and slugging is pretty much a necessity.
---
From a survivor perspective, I think tunnelling is fine. The only form of tunnelling that is not fine is being downed after getting unhooked without physically being able to make it anywhere. In those cases, you could not have done anything to prevent going down, and it's just an anti-gameplay scenario that should not exist (Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are supposed to help with these instances, but there should be actual, reliable mechanics innate to the game, instead). As long as I still get into an actual chase scenario, get to play for my survival, I do not feel tunnelling is unfair or undesirable.
---
I was getting confused by the terms people used so, thank you. üëç
---
Rare Perk: Magnum Dong.
---
Hex flex tape survivors get a gem reduction of 1 per game
---
Yeah, I'm only level 14 so usually, the guys I play against will have multiple people just trying to constantly save their teammates instead of working on gens. I'm sure that'll change once I keep leveling my killer.
---
An idea I had kinda like that I‚Äôd send fake scratch marks a few meters in one direction
---
&gt;Added events for Lightbringer emblem scoring:
---
20 points for cleansing a dull totem
---
5 points if a dull totem is cleansed while you are in a chase
---
10 points if a Hex totem is cleansed while you are in a chase
---
1/3 point for each 1% of a generator repaired while you are in a chase (Capped to a maximum of 33.3 scored for each generator)
---
This is awesome. Great change for survivors.
---
It has counterplay though.
---
I disagree. Hag is a very strong killer who ignores loops if used properly.
---
&gt;Adjusted fast vault conditions: Players can no longer trigger fast vaults when beside windows or in contact with the wall. Please note that the fast vaulting mechanics are still getting tweaked and could change between the PTB and the official update.
---
As if vaults needed another nerf...
---
Offer a survivor an egg in these trying times. Instantly recover an ally from Dying to Injured, 60 seconds cooldown.
---
I mean like that new place where go and it looks like  a library
---
It's a question I have been trying to find an answer to as well. It makes 0 sense to tunnel someone with a bear trap on them, unless you can't find their rescuer, but the Pigs I encounter don't care about that.
---
when the game has about 30 seconds left *and* is countered by noed (you know that perk that 90% of the killers run) plus you give up you MoM *and* dead hard opportunities, giving you 2 free hits instead of one, top it off with borrowed time and you have 3 free hits. oh and the best part is.. you can use that combo the entire game instead of the last minute or so.. such a useful perk..
---
so mettle of man is like deliverance and we're gonna live forever I actually kinda like it but I feel like it's gonna be another farming perk
---
It's situational.  I mean, I got tunneled in a recent solo queue match, right from the start.  Hardly got off the hook without being body-slammed and put back on.  Thing was, though, this Wraith knew I knew where his Hex was, cause I'd spotted it and he saw me going for it.  I knew he knew I was going to damn well try my best to pop it if I could get to it or lead others to it.  I think I might have lasted a minute in that game? XD
---
Other people called him out for tunneling because of it, which I appreciated them doing (seriously, those randoms worked hard to try and save my butt, all for naught), but, eh, I couldn't really be mad over it, considering.  Spectating the match was actually a \*lot\* of fun, actually, since I was very much rooting for the randoms, hehe. And then the killer and I had a good laugh over him tunneling me in post-game chat.
---
The other players all went quiet when we explained the situation, so, I think that's a win?
---
Tl;dr - you're playing to have fun and win.  It's okay to consider the other person's feeling and if you'd enjoy the treatment if it was you on the receiving end, but well, the game's called 'dead by daylight', not 'dawdling until dawn', so..
---
Aren't you a mod for a certain sub? (WiNK wInK, NuDgE nUdGE)
---
Adrenaline being called a bad perk is flat out wrong. BT is an amazing perk but saying it's a better replacement over Adrenaline is flat out laughable, for one thing BT requires you to be hook saved, can't be hook saved if no one's going to help you from the hook.
---
And NOED's easily dealt with if people do totems, without NOED Killers like Freddy (especially Freddy) are gonna be destroyed if the Adrenaline Survivor know what they're doing, plus it helps if you've been pulled off the hook in the basement or an overall shitty area. 
---
Not everyone runs Dead Hard because of how painfully inconsistent it is, Adrenaline only requires exit gates to be powered, no input on your part to activate it.
---
It was the new DS, much needed nerf. Now you have to earn it.
---
Try verifying your game files in steam
---
I'm not saying he's not going to be better, and I'm not saying he's not going to have a huge skill ceiling.
---
I'm just saying that he's not going to be some S-Tier God like a lot of people seem to think he is, and everyone is just setting themselves up for disappointment. I'd hate to see an actual good rework like what Freddy is going to be moaned about because it's not "Killer Automatically 4k's the Survivors" like everyone is setting it up to be.
---
To really emphasis this, you're the first person whose tried to convince me about his mind game potential. Everyone else is just "Teleport OMG!"
---
It's only an unsafe hook if the person you unhooked goes down within 10 seconds. If they get hit without going down it's still a safe unhook.
---
Running 2 killer perks to counter 1 survivor perk is horrendously inefficent.
---
And also, even without MoM + BT being broken, that's bad fucking design, regardless. The counterplay to a perk being "just camp and tunnel loooool" is fucking awful for everyone.
---
just dont use a m1 killer
---
"stopping a gen and going to check is not a win for killers" "you waste more time changing your target cause they went for a big loop" "killers can't stop you from getting too good loops" "camping doesn't give bp but LOOPING DOES. (Probably my favorite)"
---
Ooooh ok I get it. You're new. You'll figure it out soon enough. Game gets a lot more fun when you figure out when to change targets and when to commit. My favorite thing these days is when a survivor tries to loop me during endgame or with their only friend in a hook. It's just "my dude, you got nowhere to go". 
---
As far as looping being fun, I mean it's way more fun to lose them. Fake out one way, Sprint the other, qnq lithe, all good stuff.
---
We need carl
---
But emotes of the killers acting like idiots?
---
I think their reasoning for 2-kill standard is to make the game as evenly matched as possible?  Like it's very survivor-friendly once you get to mid-higher ranks but the GOAL is so that every game is meant to be close and tense?  But again, that's their perspective rather than the actual community; plenty of people seem to think a 3k is losing and I just don't understand that mentality myself.
---
And yeah, Baby-Dwights are Dwights that have no cosmetics and tend to have few/bad perks, same with any survivor or killer actually.  Always good that you spread some positivity!  
---
And if you want to show friendliness (and it's kind of a universal symbol that people don't break the trust of?) you can just smack things repeatedly to indicate they should do them.  Stand at a pallete and smack it and nod to show you want him to stun you, smack a generator and nod to show he can do it, etc.  I don't have thousands of hours in this game but I've never come across a killer who's broken that sacred signal of "Yeah go ahead and do this thing man", and I think that's rather cool.
---
Not Groovy man
---
It's not viable unless you make it viable. I personally don't camp without an open gate, but the only reason Killers camp is because the *survivors* make it worthwhile. Stop hookdiving, run Spine Chill to see if the Killer is there, DO THE DAMN GENS
---
That's kinda stupid because how is it a safe unhook if the killer literally smacks the survivor anyways questioning Game logic aside unhooking a survivor if you have MOM basically makes you have to play smarter which is nice. I do see MOM becoming more used but less annoying for M1 killers.
---
The ptb is today right?
---
I can see the build now. MoM, Borrowed, Deliverance, Selfcare, DS or adrenalin. Pretty much adding borrowed to the old "tank build" for safe unhooks.
---
ya just dont use killers you enjoy playing as 4head
---
Everyone has a couple decent addons. I think the real question is who has the lowest number of useful addons.
---
Doctor I feel like only has one decent category really that isn't iridescent worth using.
---
I mean deranking feels scummy but its not to bully new players so its alright i guess
---
You have no idea how many times I got flashlight saved even though I was invisible to the survivor
---
One time I made a post about camping sucking. My good sir trust me when I tell you , you just opened a bag of worms you wished you never opened.
---
It‚Äôs not bad, just make sure you make it clear you don‚Äôt intend on killing them and only want to depip while also getting some BP.
---
Forcing them to take Borrowed Time means they aren't taking Adrenaline, Dead Hard, or DS, and Borrowed Time has built in counters like lowering TR or just not camping.
---
It's still a much better version of the perk, balance wise.
---
She is up to something...
---
The only guy that gets bullied on advanced ranks is me unfortunately
---
I think it could be ok if they make protection a lot better. The only change I think it needed was to make it 4 hits instead of 3 that way in order for you to use it you would have to get away at least once so unless you have a instant heal every game chances are multiple people won‚Äôt be using it in 1 game
---
Honestly the PS4 is a piece of shit in terms of hardware, obviously Somy make amazing games though so you‚Äôre stuck with it. Hope they fix it for next gen
---
&gt; Game logic aside unhooking a survivor if you have MOM basically makes you have to play smarter which is nice
---
It literally doesn't. Run MoM + Borrowed Time, literally unhook in the killer's face, the killer has to get 2 hits on that person within 10 seconds or else it's a safe unhook.
---
The new design is terrible. Solo survivors would get farmed all the time for WGLF stacks, which is noteworthy because *WGLF has no gameplay impact whatsoever*. Now MoM users have a gameplay reason to farm.
---
That sounds bad but honestly I believe we'll at least get more variety then adrenaline,DS,SC or Borrowed, MOM every single match
---
"Let's just call them new cause they don't agree with me" 
---
Lol , "when to change targets"???  Whenever you change target you've wasted time and you're also risking it cause in high ranks (which you may not be familiar with) EVERYONE loops and EVERYONE knoe hoe to do it properly and EVERYONE know the good loops 
---
It's a waste of time anyways .... Learn how to play against campers instead of complaining
---
Does feedback actually do anything?
---
His mori is eaiting your hands
---
We are gonna live forever. Its a farming perk.
---
tl;dr: ghostface is trash.
---
You know that's the point of a business right
---
&gt; We need to be bitches
---
Too late.
---
Rip spirit lol
---
Me when someone did the 2 killer glitch
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused only Billy's hair to show in the Jigsaw box aura when within 5 meters.
---
Is this a typo and supposed to be "Bill" or could it be the name of the next survivor, "Billy"?
---
omgg, thanks for the details. i'll definitely have to experiment once I have the time\~!
---
I once saw a video of a killer hacking. He was using a script that highlighted survivor items if they dropped, and the golden toolbox on Haddonfield was highlighted as well, meaning it can PROBABLY be picked up somehow.
---
This is my bored mind at work talking, but maybe there‚Äôs a secret way the devs get these and they insta-start gens somehow for when they test maps? Just making conspiracy theories üòÇ
---
please die
---
Whenever I'm out of pudding/shells, I run shroud of separation just to make the survivors extra sweaty.
---
If I face camp its because I tabbed out to check a message or something. If I come back when your unhooking thats on you
---
My P3 Leatherface is specifically for basement camping. He can do that well, at least
---
Looking forward to a Quentin rework
---
Oh I meant like just in general idk if any where coming with the ghostface chapter
---
That's just Jeff. Have you heard that poor man run?
---
Oh for sure, I've only ran BT a few times as it doesn't really fit my build anyway, and you're ultimately risking yourself and the save if you're trying to pull them off right next to the Killer in their radius, plus it's pretty much shit on by Killers with lower terror radius with MAA.
---
The player model now looks in the same direction as the camera. So i don't think that this Will work.
---
Just hide
---
I found this thread by searching for something else on reddit, read your comment and realized you guys were talking about a character in a video game. I never played the game or don‚Äôt think I even seen anyone play it... but now that I‚Äôve read your comment and it‚Äôs been 52 days, was the Freddy update good or bad?
---
I'm a hard survivor main and i am SO glad it's getting nerfed. Now it's not just given to the survivor for free because you aren't playing Billy, LF, Huntress, or Plague.
---
&gt; Fixed multiple audio issues related to the environments.
---
Will we finally be able to hear gens without having to go directly inside the room they‚Äôre in? I‚Äôm keeping everything crossed!
---
Ah dang that‚Äôs a pity. Whelp any ideas that could make it possible to use it in a chase?
---
Camping is the counterplay, duh. If you let them die before getting downed enough they can't use it! /s
---
Why did they change WoO to 20 seconds but not DwM? Dance with Me is already a weak perk alone, they should change it to 20 seconds so it can work with Q&amp;Q.
---
Sorry for my abysmal photoshop skills but i just thought it'd be fun to think about for a while.
---
It‚Äôs the name of the Saw puppet that sits on top of the box.
---
It's not a matter of opinion, everything i cited your saying was flat out wrong (looping gives bp? Da fuq?).
---
I've been red ranks regularly for both killer (been climbing with new legion) and survivor and it don't mean shit, as nearly everyone will tell you. Nice try guy. You have a hard time with looping, that's lack of skill baby. You won't get better by camping! Haddonfield is about the only map with enough window loops to be a problem (and that's only if you're unlucky with window placement) but even then, it's not too bad if you can find some survivors fucking up. 
---
Playing against campers is easy, just boring as shit. A game can be unbalanced and fun, but it can't be boring.
---
Billy's the name of the puppet that sits on top of the Jigaw boxes I think
---
Guess what
---
Good lookin' out!
---
/r/Deathgarden 
---
post about the game there please. This is /r/deadbydaylight, not that sub.
---
Ds and head on
---
It is better at pallets now bruh
---
The only other thing it would really have affected was D-Strike, which now only shits on camping and tunnelling killers. It doesn't really need any more nerfs
---
Because it effects perks like decisive strike making that perk useless
---
Why the fuck adrenaline v2.0
---
I think he will be a regular M1 killer in a chase :( his whole power is designed specifically for sneaking around.
---
So that they can make changes to stun timers for perks like Head On and DS without having to factor in the way they interact with Enduring, I think. If the stun timer is too low then Enduring hard counters it, if it‚Äôs too long then the perk is more punishing against killers who don‚Äôt run Enduring.
---
I was half expecting them to kiss
---
What's the best name for a Claudette main and why is it John Cena?
---
I mean you're already deranking to go against people below your skill level... Why would you care?
---
What about the rank 15s that feel screwed going against a clearly better killer?
---
Yeah no. if you need to secure a kill or its the only viable option for your current situation it is valid. You're not very bright if you cant even imagine a single situation where its the best option.
---
His name is Robert Scott Bean
---
They also fixed the Gold Cascade Hair for Kate so it doesn't clip into her anymore!
---
Ah alright so play him like wraith it seems.
---
What the hell did they do to my girl?
---
I mean, yeah, but DBD's protection bonus is super inconsistent.
---
Half the time I run WGLF and take a hit for someone it doesn't give me protection. Whether I body block the killer while they're chasing someone or take a hit at the exit gate with someone right next to me, protection is never guaranteed.
---
So now instead of a "reliable" perk, you nerf it while adding a lot of inconsistency.
---
All of this requires much smarter play than "Hurr Durr, I took three hits".
---
You're forgetting that Borrowed Time only works when another Survivor is there, protecting your ass. Unlike the current set-up of MoM + DS + DH + Adrenaline, new MoM forces you to get off of Gens to save allies because none of it is just blatantly happening for being hit. The current build is just selfish power that makes each survivor that much harder to catch, where as the new MoM forces you to play altruistically in order to gain the bonus.
---
Also, you say that this iteration of Mettle of Man is the same as the old one, but it's just flat out not and you having that opinion tells me that you're not thinking critically, let me give you a hint:
---
What other perk rewards Survivors for unhooking other Survivors safely and is quite known for being *actually rather difficult to get full stacks of if every survivor is running around with it*?
---
It does feel bad pulling off a stun with DS or Head On that gets reduced down to nothing by a killer running Enduring. 
---
It also makes it easier to balance the stuns from those perks when you no longer have to factor Enduring.
---
Isn't Check out just Adrenaline ?
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/fx4xols
---
Scroll all the way down.
---
In one of the streams they said it was getting too crazy to have to go thru and evaluate values in every perk (like ds and head on) with enduring. To make it easier currently and for any future perks they were changing it to only be used against pallet stuns but that now they could go back through and readjust the values in the other perks so that way it was "if you use ds it's a flat xx seconds" instead of it being xx seconds but xx.xx seconds with enduring.
---
Yes they finally gave the Queen the hair she deserves and not some wet spaghetti
---
I have to agree on this one. The fast vault change is jus a big bullshit
---
SHIT I FUCKED UP. i meant to say when an exit gate opens.
---
pfft no
---
And Head On.
---
We need more of these.
---
Die
---
I am at 46% for achievements at 155 hours. I guess I have 661 hours to go!
---
All long hairs have physics now even Claudette new hair
---
if this MoM change goes live I'm never playing killer again jesus christ.
---
Carlsade
---
I guess they have plans for more stun perks and they want them to be able to set the right time without thinking about how long it will last with Enduring like head on
---
It‚Äôs fake candles so it‚Äôs safe :‚Äô3 thanks for the concern though!
---
I come here to steal DbD memes, and am never disappointed. God-tier content :D
---
Ok, I think I get it, thank you!  So you get "Lightbringer" points for facilitating others working a gen by being a distraction, whereas before you only got them from working the generator itself.  Seems like a smart choice to reward more playstyles.
---
I find Carl Crusade sounds better
---
For solo survivors MOM is definitely nerfed. Without communication it‚Äôs hard to take protective hits.
---
They changed legions black mask to a Grey too
---
It can be a legit strategy
---
I don't understand how survivors can still complain about camping when the effectiveness of camping is entirely up to them, if you don't punish the camp or you're bad enough at the game to reward the camp then its really your own fault and you shouldn't scream at the killer
---
Shorts not short enough!
---
I mean. Maaaaybe üôÑ you better not tell anyone though!
---
It's really not.
---
Over a years worth of development, playtesting, design and qa man hours is not nothing.
---
Thank you :D
---
But seriously it is beautiful, you are very talented.
---
I really wish they kept the flip phone, the mori looked funnier with it.
---
Y E E T  on outta there
---
It actually has the NOED icon inside of the orange bottle :D
---
I always try to take a ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù view. That said, I do like the fact that people won‚Äôt be able to easily stack it on all four survivors now, and that it will affect all killers equally. Those were my biggest problems with it.
---
Yup, I'm totally ok with that. Because if you can loop the killer for like 5 gens you would still not go up in rank because you only got chased which deprives you of altruism and objective points.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I was all for the change but now I realized it's way worse then before. Well time to not play killer
---
What happens if you que up with him?
---
Killer main , i think this is a stupid nerf cuz the perk only have 2 fucking months or less, so what's the point of buying a survivor to get the perks if in 2 months the perk will get nerfed to a point that will be useless in almost every match? I really don't care about losing a hit, it's like dead hard only 20 secs until i catch the survivor again, but you know i'm happy cuz killer will be more ez
---
And my internet dies before I could finish a single game. Yup, it wouldn't be a normal day of playing DbD if something didn't break.
---
But really, my first impressions isnt good. Being spotted shouldn't instantly remove your power AND prevent you from ever using it. Ghost at the moment is literally a Killer without a power.
---
The hair seems to not sway around anymore while running or repairing a generator, when Kate moves her head... this is kind of a bummer but I'm sure it was not intended.
---
I actually like all these changes, thankfully MoM still sounds viable, especially since it can counter insta downs now when ready. Sounds like it would be the equivalent to Borrowed Time as a safety net for the unhooker going for risky saves.
---
I also love that pipping should be a bit easier for survivors who are all contributing to the match.
---
yeah idk I doubt they'll let it hit live servers but if it does I might actually just quit.
---
Lmao right? Like the entitled shit even had the gall to call me a filthy camper afterwards like lol. What was I supposed to do? Walk away when I know all 4 survivors are near me? I think he was just mad he never got to use his Insta-heal
---
I feel no matter what he will become completely broken or complete garbage sad to him be Freddy tier but it could be worse.
---
How about we add a red visual effect for stuns that no one wanted or asked for which is somewhat annoying? Good idea, Greg. I think it'll be even cooler when the killer gets stunned, screen goes red, then they get flashlighted so it looks like they're at a rave
---
I am currently sitting in a lobby waiting to find survivors. I will update when I play a game.
---
good meme but stonetoss is a nazi
---
Or a really good one üòèüò©
---
Happy green cheese day
---
They'll probably make it to 5 or so hopefully because I hate playing survivor
---
Shiiit it doesn't have it on PS4 :'( tell me all about it!
---
That's weird af

&gt; KNOWN ISSUES: The Pig's stinger audio does not play when she starts moving.
---
&lt;quiet oinking&gt;
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Tip #1: Look for movement if you know you're far away, but closing in on their area. I've caught several people who looked like their surroundings, but ended up crouch walking around cover to avoid me.
---
Tip #2: Play some survivor or watch some high level survivor gameplay to get you into the survivor mindest. If you can predict them then you can find them.
---
Tip #3: The two tips above are general tips, but if you want a more specific one then I recommend watching a yt channel called pigkiller. His game sense is amazing.
---
Survivor perks buffs and killer perk nerf, just what i needed at rank 1, where i barely kill 1-2 without a mori... :)
---
you can also just do safe unhooks
---
I know, right?
---
play him while you can, before the rework comes.
---
Dude. I came across this not knowing about it and it was super off putting and frustrating. Lol. Didn‚Äôt see a note about it.
---
They changed Kates hair. It‚Äôs way more fluffy and floats more.
---
The PTB is out
---
Yeah Freddy won't be Freddy tier soon anymore lol
---
What
---
i think you should add ‚Äúmirror myers‚Äù and ‚Äúiridescent addons‚Äù
---
It looks like you need to like directly at him with your character. Tried looking at him while hiding behind a wall and it didn't work.
---
Well. It's certainly not going to work on the PTB, or on release, because everyone will be expecting him. But I still think it's hilarious they thought a killers power being directly countered by a survivor looking at them, rather than placing it more in the killers control and balancing the power accordingly, was a good idea LOL. What the fuck?
---
"Adjusted the chase volume for Survivors."  
---
  
---
I don't understand. Why only for survivors? The music is so loud during the chase the killer can't hear footsteps.
---
I'm not completely sure, but I think it is the weekend of June 8th.
---
So what you're telling me, is I should run noed if I'm playing killer?
---
The Children of the Teabagger
---
You definitely DON'T keep the same speed when crouched. I tested this in KYF. Survivors gain distance on you when crouched.   
---
And no, you CAN cancel his power by just 'spinning the camera around.' I had many games where I was behind a wall, completely out of sight, my friend in KYF could not see me at all and I couldn't see them, and they moved their camera and cancelled the power.
---
Oh man would be awesome
---
Ghost face has a movie series.... also try dead by daylight wiki.
---
He is actually slowed when crouching and if you do an attack itll deplete your whole power
---
Well aren‚Äôt you a negative nelly?
---
Agreed,
---
As it stands he's F tier, its not even a knee jerk reaction he's just fucking trash and his power does not work right
---
I'm aware that he has a movie series. A series that is completely unrelated to the lore of the Dead By Daylight version.
---
I think it was the 14th tbh
---
His stealth doesn't last forever until he's seen anymore, either. Makes it way harder to approach survivors. 
---
Also, when you were spotted before, you had a few seconds while your meter depleted to still be stealthy. Now, it's instant. 
---
One thing that really frustrates me too, is that you can be "spotted" by downed and hooked survivors. So annoying. :T
---
This is dbd sub not a shitty deathgarden sub

Ugh just another party starter. Couldn‚Äôt they make a different item? Maybe like a toolbox or medkit?

Exactly, I don‚Äôt think DBD can capture the masterpiece of Bioshock. The cocktail of emotions, thrilling plot...all being missed out on. If they implemented it they BHVR better do a bloody good job, but it would be far too difficult

It isn't the person that got farmed in front of you fault they got unhooked by a piece of shit.  You're basically punishing them for having a scumbag teamate.  Play some survivor go up against a hard tunneling killer with farming teamates and you'll know what it feels like on the other side.  There is next to no counterplay to that for them.  You'll get a kill but it will be skilless and lack in points.  Play aggressive hook different survivors and you will get so many more bps and secure a stronger pip while having more fun for all parties.  It will train you to be a stronger killer.
---
Not to mention, hooked and downed survivors can "spot" you. It's really annoying.
---
Cringe but yea got me
---
We already have MoM why do we need egg please
---
Same energy
---
His power concept is really cool and it is heartbreaking how poopy it has started as. At least it is only the PTB and they can make changes whether it would be my idea or another one.
---
MoM is super easy to get now.
---
Unhook someone...and if the killer doesnt tunnel on the way back to the hook...potentially 2 tokens right there. AND it affects 1 shot killers and Huntress now.
---
Oh boy. :P
---
Sorry, I crashed early yesterday and slept for most of the day. 50 left, no worries!
---
That's adorable. xD Thank you!
---
Holy shit that's hot
---
Thank you so much!
---
Aww, I appreciate that. Thank you!
---
Thank you!!
---
&gt; Adjusted fast vault conditions: Players can no longer trigger fast vaults when beside windows or in contact with the wall. Please note that the fast vaulting mechanics are still getting tweaked and could change between the PTB and the official update.
---
I'm deeply concerned about this bit here because I find current fast vaults both fun and skillful to line up. There should be a learning curve to lining up some of the more difficult vaults that make it rewarding to perform. This change weakens already questionable tiles like 4 lanes and L/T walls by forcing medium vaults with a mechanic that took skill and practice to perform under the pressure of a chase. 
---
I've loved the fast vault change ever since it was implemented and would be disappointed to see it changed to remove some of that skill requirement. If the devs are looking to block fast vaults off of abusive windows they should add more rubble that blocks the running start instead (or preferably close these windows entirely).
---
3 is really broke it would make more sense for at most 15 seconds imo
---
Hey man, them giving the perk any love at all is a win in my books. Obviously tokens would be a lot nicer, but at least you can actually hit Gens with Pop on slower Killers now.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Poised maybe
---
Very cool!
---
o
---
I‚Äôve reached out to BHVR. There‚Äôs another profile on my XBOX that it works completely fine with so I‚Äôm going to say my profile is corrupted. Also there is no save game data present either which is weird. I will try a hard reset just for the heck of it though.
---
Teleport to gens gonna be like ayyy until we realize it's gonna be like, on a 60 second cooldown, with a range of like 32 meters, and survivors get a 5 second headstart warning with it so freddy can't even get a hit on them
---
I stopped running adrenaline because I like also being able to Dead Hard the killer
---
With a more creeper status. Peeping Tom creep.
---
Idk how they make powers with obvious flaws like this and let it go to the PTB
---
*applause* üëè
---
I bet he's gonna be worse
---
What system are you on?
---
Also, Ghost Face is doo doo so far. I just spin my camera while on a gen...and when he gets close I get notified and blast him out of stealth.
---
If survivors are aware of their surroundings...he can become an M1 killer with zero power through the whole round.
---
I still have 70 on my Kate since the last event.
---
Jeff wouldn't even have diabetes. He's a biker dude but he does look that fat.
---
no
---
I don't think they think it's important.  For killers at least.
---
For survivors? I'm playing The Spirit, a blind killer, and I can't hear footsteps of people running right next to me because the chase music is destroying my ears, but survivors get the fix? Wtf?
---
I'm sure you have always been able to hit survivors in lockers. I have always done it. I hit lockers as a way to see if anyone is in it rather than open it which I think takes longer.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Alright

Bro you just posted cringe you‚Äôre going to lose subscriber
---
Idk how that works
---
If BHVR doesn‚Äôt fix him I‚Äôm gonna have to go on a rampage
---
once i was playing against a killer, regular stabby blue mayonaise
---
thats it
---
go home
---
Let‚Äôs start a strike every killer run NOED red mori until Ghosface is fixed
---
His true Power is the insta teabag
---
We are talking about Left behind dude, not unbreakable.
---
This has probably been addressed before and I missed it, but is the glass-breaking sound when the spirit phases still a thing? And is it a bug or a nerf?
---
what about a heart tattoo labeled MoM?
---
The teabag, aka the only reason to bother playing him in his current state.
---
How about we rework Ghost face he's the third trash killer in a row now
---
I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs entirely accurate to how it works, but if it is, would it really surprise us at this point? Devs take eons to fix bugs, perform reworks, balance properly...
---
Ghostface is either 2nd or 3rd worst killer. It doesn't take much more testing to do this. I've been watching people play him and played 2 games myself. He's just straight up bad.
---
\- You can't stalk in chases unless you're playing against bots.
---
\- Trying to peak and stalk rarely works. You either can't get see enough for it to stalk them or they notice you immediately and run or cancel your power.
---
\- It's way too easy to cancel his power. Do a 360 as a survivor with your camera every so often and you'll counter him.
---
He's just a shit Myers. At least Myers has a much longer exposed effect, has natural stealth, can stalk during chases and doesn't have his power removed if the survivors camera has a few pixels of him in view.
---
I suggest they either remove the ability to cancel his power by looking at him all together, or only remove about 1/2 of his gauge if they do and save the stalk progress on the survivor.
---
Just to clarify: I meant nothing in terms of negative feedback or loss of support. I know they spent a lot of time and effort into the new Fred!
---
when you start a new character and find a purple toolbox but the killers has franklins
---
I said the same thing when they made Legion. How do they test this and think it‚Äôs okay.
---
yep, its pretty stupid how easy it is to cancel bis power, compared to the Time it takes you to stalk
---
yeah, i do too.. i hope they get re-added and tiers 1 &amp; 2 of all perks get removed
---
Unpopular opinion, fuck Karl, he's just a fat idiot, what does he need to be in dbd for, he's just gonna run for 10 meters then lose his breath, smh
---
Absolutely not.  Flashlight saves are the killers fault everytime when they happen.  They are so easy to defend against.  If someone facecamps you over a flashlight save they ate just really really trash.
---
Just don't spam click the light for bm at pallets.  That can trigger some killers to facecamp lol.  But saves are fine.  They shouldn't be allowed to happen anyway.
---
Yeah I got called a camper for downing people who run up to the hook AS I'M WALKING AWAY
---
YES MEGAN I SEE YOUR ASS IN THE BUSH BY THE HOOK
---
like what am I supposed to do just keep walking away despite seeing you
---
How were they toxic?
---
Honestly I‚Äôd be fine with a skin for a character. Even if it means no new perks.
---
Oh, trust me, that's how the power works in a nutshell. Go test him out yourself if you don't believe me.
---
14th to 18th
---
My God dude, just like Freddy they hype me up to the max then pull this shit on us.
---
Surely this won't be his official release, right?
---
Press touchpad.
---
I dont understand why they make the killers weak or broken during testing. I mean Im a survivor main and want a challenge, i want a strong killer to play against.
---
david, david... buddy. i am not a cloaked wraith chasing you. i am a ew III myers chasing you. trying to shine me with your flashlight isn't going to work.
---
Yup, does not surprise me one bit lol.
---
Said the same thing about Legion.
---
I told you guys ghostface was gonna suck
---
I'd like to say "no" but with BHVR, you never know.
---
Better than Twilight
---
Small price to pay from salvation
---
Not to mention that all his perks are relatively poor and have no synergy with each other. 
---
Who in the right mind thought that I'm all Ears is a good perk. it serves absolutely no purpose in the game and dosent even manage to have synergy with Furtive chase.
---
Furtive chase doesn't do very much in a chase and takes a lot of effort to gain tokens. It would be a much more fun perk if its effect was active outside of a chase and would feel like more of an award and while fitting in with Ghost Faces theme better.
---
Originally I thought that Thrilling Tremors would be a somewhat decent interruption perk. The ability to identify what gens are being worked on by survivors would be somewhat decent. It would be still outclassed by perks like BBQ but it would at least be something new that could have some potential synergy. Then they ruined it by adding a 60-second cooldown for an effect that has little impact on slowing down survivors.
---
Who said they would even fix him?
---
iridescent stone. they get caught, you hit to down, they drop their item. trap re-arms. baby dweet saves them. they run back for it. repeat until dead.
---
Imagine in his current state , ghostface vs SWF
---
Someone just chase the killer fucking up his power hahaha
---
Thank god resilience affects vaults again
---
After Ghostface reveal (Stream one, not dev build leak). I already knew he was going to be abused.
---
Don‚Äôt worry! Just wait a year and a half for the Ghostface rework!
---
They also improved some of Feng Min's hairs.
---
Delete before you give anybody some good ideas ;_____;
---
Just make it so that he cant stalk while someone actively looks at him... jesus.
---
Took me 11 minutes to realize that the proportions are 2 small. Still learning photoshop btw.
---
It'll trick killers into thinking Claudette has a mori.
---
Bushes are some serious life savers.
---
What‚Äôs going on?  I‚Äôm working an haven‚Äôt been able to play yet.
---
It's not that simple. You have to take into account unhook time when you get immediately downed as other players will have to come get you. Sometimes three survivors all try to unhook so that's 30 seconds x 3 just for your unhook because you didn't heal. Both are good perks and depending on the situation one will be better than the other.
---
&gt; for whatever reason.
---
They're chasing the high they got when they strung together a load of bullshit to save everyone in one go. Adrenaline + Borrowed Time + MoM + DS + Dead Hard + Pallet Stun Save + Flashlight save
---
Once you get a taste of it, you get greedy- but most idiots don't realize you can only really do these shenanigans when a door is open
---
just make that him can only stalk  stationary survivors, and survivors cannot break him out.
---
I've waited 3 years for Ghostface to be added to this game and this is the laughable piece of crap they come out with.... perks that no one in their right mind would bother using (what is the point of having a perk to stall gens if it doesn't stall the gens that are actually being worked on?) and a killer with a power that can be cancelled from halfway across the map by survivors rapidly spinning their cameras.
---
They would need to completely rework him like Freddy if they wanted to so I think he'll be released like what we have now then reworked
---
Ikr. Its crazy.
---
GhostFace  is worse then current Freddy basically
---
I really hope not. I'm not giving them a dime for Ghostface unless they fix him. They don't deserve money for this killer until they fix the obvious flaws.
---
The survivors can just spin their camera 360 grades and if they got you in there your power is out.
---
Hey! I was actually the person who filmed this. This was captured on snapchat when our Laurie and Michael attended a horror convention in NC.
---
No they wouldn‚Äôt just make it so the survivors have to actually turn their character towards him also the PTB is for testing killers before they are released to fix any flaws
---
‚õèHOW LONG ‚õè CAN ‚õè THIS ‚õè GO ON ‚õè
---
Fun is lost on some people.
---
Ghostface is destroyed by SWFs, he's not immune to OoO , Premonition and Spine Chill and you can cancel his whole ability by spinning your mouse.

2 things need to be changed / improved from what i've seen so far

+ Hooked survivors can break your stealth,

This is both obvious but kinda stupid, once you hook someone you're basically cutting off a section of map you can't stealth through.
---
+ The time it takes to break stealth.
---
This is way too fast right now, it's borderline impossible to actually get a successful stalk unless the survivors are potatoes.
---
Are there still some available?
---
The way it is right now is basically fucked if they try to balance him he either become strong as fuck or weaker then Freddy they just need to rework him completely
---
How is it broken? It's basically a perk designed to discourage the killer from tunneling you and you can only activate the perk two times per game. If anything it's kinda 'meh'.
---
Holy shit is that what that is? played trapper for the first time in ages and was wondering tf was going on.
---
Us
---
Object Of Obsession fucks him too
---
You go after the survivor that has it? Congratulations, you have no power
---
You don't go after the survivor that has it? Congratulations, you have no power
---
If any survivor at all ever faces their camera at him at all even if they don‚Äôt actually notice him it cancels his ability you can actually cancel his ability by spinning your camera around your head and PRESTO GhostFaces ability is useless
---
Considering it only affects windows and pallets that you have used after being hooked, i disagree. It's only there to prevent tunnelling and make a basement escape that much more plausable. plus, baring in mind generally going around windows is a valid strategy anyway.
---
My friends and I have a rule that when the killer enters the exit gate, you leave.
---
How the fuck was it released like this......
---
Honestly fair enough. Speaking as a Jane main all her perks are fucking terrible. Solidarity is too situational, Poised is a meme and you're better off running Dance With Me, and Head On is broken as shit.
---
I have used all the perks quite a few times and have only once had them ever be useful for me, and I have never had a situation where I thought "if only I had (one of Jane's perks)"
---
I honestly think they need to redo all of Jane's perks, or at least make Solidarity better. 50% healing and no use of Medkits is terrible.
---
First thing that came to mind for me was killer shack or t wall l walls
---
Safe unhooks too, it‚Äôs still viable
---
All they have to do is make it so that the survivor has to actually turn their character model to be facing him to cancel the power - or make the time required to cancel the power longer than a half second camera spin.
---
Also interesting to note: blindness from people in lockers prevents Ghostface's power from being cancelled, but blindness from Third Seal still cancels Ghostface's power.
---
pls not again

Are you really underestimating how bad these Developers are at balancing? If they have to turn their character towards him he would still be bad
---
? I‚Äôm on Xbox wdym
---
Someone bring me up to speed on the flaw, I've been at work all day
---
so that way if you see him, you just run away, keeping the ideia of spotting him.
---
&gt; I think the cooldown could be removed entirely and the perk would still not be more than "not bad", but it's a welcome change.
---
I kinda disagree with this, part of the mindgaming in chasing is knowing where pallets and windows are, the fact that you could have a perk showing you their location at all times would just make another aspect of the chase braindead easy.
---
I legit do this just to fuck with people, down them the second time, and then leave them there.
---
Have you seen their "play with the devs" session? Most are low rank, which means they probably don't move their camera around very much, etc. - all of which means they thought this power was a great idea.
---
His power is cancelled if a survivor looks at him. If survivors just look all around them while doing gens he never gets to stalk anyone. I also found that I was booted out of stealth often even when I didnt know a survivor was near me. It basically removes his power. Hes just an m1 killer.
---
That's kind of the point, it's supposed to help survivors juke mid chase and hide.
---
Just because you happened to see a bug doesn't mean the bug testers can recreate it.
---
They need to be able to recreate, and the devs need to figure out why the bug occurs.
---
They don't just look at a bug, press the "fix" button, and everything is okay.
---
It isn't that easy.
---
&gt; Instead of introducing the perk, why did they not fix the problem?
---
Because it is not a problem?
---
Fair point there but after playing both sides fairly often I can understand an argument from both sides I just think the 40 second seems really long but I like the idea of the perk
---
Instead of using billy for his map pressure you have to use him as a standard m1 killer but with an ability that can isnta down
---
If any survivor at all turns their camera towards him for even a split second his ability s cancelled they don‚Äôt even need to know where he is you can actually just spin your camera around frantically and make him almost useless
---
Wow a disconnect, you really did a great job !!!
---
I'm serions btw lol IT really is
---
So enduring does not work anymore against DS?
---
He should be able to become the tasmanian devil. Spin his blade in a whirlwind of fury at the speed of Billy. Throwing crows into the air and survivers to the ground. He can't stop to hook and he can only spin. Oh and maybe your locked into the camera spin.. ok I will stop talking but I would play it at least once.
---
üòÖ Thank you, haha. I hope I still count! üò¨
---
Wooooooow
---
Eyyyyy finally buffing Pop goes the weasel to a minute, glorious!
---
Most people don't actually understand how much work it does take, they seem to think it could just be done over night
---
1) I haven't tested his crouch speed, yet it can be useful for bm xD
---
2) that is definitely a bug, as devs said you need to look at him for a few seconds. I probably would get fixed.
---
So instead of nerfing enduring+spirit fury they make it even stronger
---
Just curious, the only reason you're buying it is because of how he looks, even though you can't see him when you play as him?
---
According to the entitled survivor mains, yes. Yes you are.
---
The only thing that prevents him from being worse than current Freddy is that he doesn't have to wait 7 seconds to attack someone, but once Freddy gets reworked, he'll be all alone in F tier by himself in his current state.
---
If you're playing Killer, you're gonna be "searching for match" for, like, ever. Because _everyone_ is trying to play Killer right now.
---
The ranking system is hilarious. I don't pay any mind to it anymore. If it wants to derank me and place me against baby killers than have it at bhvr.
---
I feel your pain
---
They're going to do the same with freddy rework, he's gonna be garbo

---
Game director plays only at rank 20 -17. That's the answer to all the balance problems.
---
thought the rework would be a buff
---
Does it cancel the exposed status when you get it?
---
Hex: Rum Ham
---
I feel like this is further proof that bhvr doesn't play their own game, they are all rank 20s, like seriously
---
Hitting ppl in lockers is a glitch
---
I get that. Is it add on reliant though? By the time I've got the chainsaw charged they're already through a window or obstructed. With the reduced move speed you cant chase and fake it out either.
---
And even then, why even bother moving around in stealth mode when you'll just get stunned out of it by someone halfway across the map rapidly spinning their camera around? It's not like it actually tells you where the survivor is (considering you can cancel Ghostface's power from a significant distance away, including from behind walls and other obstacles), all it gives you is a stun for no good reason.
---
Look at him to cancelthe stealth is a thing, but it should be like: the ghost face must be in the center of the camera (wich means that they are focusing in rather than just spining the camera around) and stay in it for 3 secs, so that means the survivor is really looking at you, it's shit right now
---
Play kill your friends
---
remember that you paid for the game, do not let the opinion of others change your way of enjoying the game when you are not doing anything that goes against the rules of it
---
Yes exactly. Not even going to lie
---
I think they should make it so the survivor has to actually face their character towards the killer and BOOM the survivor will have to stop what they are doing and will actually have to notice the killer
---
It's not unrealistic, but it's a totally different animal.
---
- Survivors now no longer gain the bonus if they are being hit while chased.
---
- If a Survivor is downed on the other side of the map, you have to decide if you want to finish the gen you're on or waste time running there to ensure you get the unhook and the stack.
---
- MoM now only grants it's benefit if the survivors are playing together. Which is where all the power of Survivors should come from.
---
- MoM no longer fits into the "I'm an idiot who needs 10 hits per game in order to not die" build and now makes for a very powerful incentive to play a "We'll Make it" type build, giving you a selfish reason to play selflessly.
---
New MoM is leagues better than the old one.
---
Ghostface only came out on the PTB like, an hour+ ago. And this particular Ghostface isn't one from any of the movies, either. He's his own dude. OP wanted the lore on DBD's Ghostface, my man.
---
People call me out for camping meanwhile im patrolling at least 30 meters away in the area paying attention to the hook and gens in range. I'm not just going to run across the map and let the survivor get unhooked for free.
---
Thank god they added safe unhooks to the mettle changes. It makes the perk pretty fun to work towards in the game instead of the protection hits alone which are a bit trickier to get for a perk like this. I‚Äôm actually pretty happy with thisüòÅ
---
I saw a white thing on the screen (kinda like in an fps game and ypu get shot so it tells you where the shot is from) t when the power gets canceled sometimes maybe telling you where the survivors saw you but I'm not sure
---
Charge time add-ons are always helpful and you can only really hope there aren't windows nearby when charging your chainsaw,if you see there is a close pallet or window it's better to just normally hit them instead and then Finnish the chase like that instead of going for the chainsaw
---
You say face the camera AND the model to him? Kinda off in a chase, but maybe yes
---
R/whoooosh
---
But still thank you for the nice advice &lt;3
---
What's Freddy's rework?
---
Wow a carbon copy item with a different description. How exciting.
---
They wouldn't be able to Dead Hard after Adrenaline pops because of Exhaustion, though.
---
They could just make it so if your in a chase all they have to do is do it with the camera but if your not in a chase then it will work like that
---
[Freddy players to Nurse mains this patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIb3GkuRHps)
---
the issue with a stealth killer peering around corners and having his power get cancelled out just by a survivor looking at him, all the while being in third person never made sense to me.
---
an iconic killer being so easy as to cancel out their power by literally looking around is just a big no no from me as to what‚Äôs to come. hopefully they‚Äôll change a lot of things for his power to actually work.
---
You don't get exposed because you just looked at him hahaha
---
Yikes, yeah. I decided to watch a livestream and his ability was only activated once in 3 whole games. It‚Äôs insane how this was not picked up during testing, it makes me question if they‚Äôre really even checking out what they‚Äôre putting out.
---
No worries dude, you do what you like :-D
---
To be fair, there's a huge difference between "Game Breaking Bug that affected no one in the Dev team" and "Literally sweeping the camera around cancels his power".
---
Dwights hide in lockers, claudettes hide in corners, Jake's are kinda derps but not bad, every Jane I see is like... Really bad. Kate is usually pretty good at looping. David always runs dead hard but doesn't know how to use it :\. Nea is the true killer. That's all I got for survivors.
---
Trapper gonna trap, bubba gonna camp.
---
Nurse= win (on console)
---
Huntress= win (on console)
---
Plague= win
---
Freddy= win
---
All those were from survivor perspective.
---
I like the change. 3 stacks with a combination of protection hits and safe unhooks might be relatively managable for a single survivor to get over the course of a regular game, but people forget the argument that was prior used against MOM: there are up to 4 survivors that can have it. And there are definitely not enough stacks to go around, in a regular game. Survivors will (have to) play in highly time-inefficient and risky ways to get their stacks, all running for saves, all trailing chases to try and get hits, blocking hooks needlessly, running across the map a lot in the process. This wastes tons of time and gives the killer a lot of opportunities to capitalize on the reckless survivor plays. Plus, now if you get tunnelled, MOM does not help you at all anymore, which similar to Deliverance, will also lead to survivors playing in ways to avoid being found/found first, which again means more wasted time.
---
I think the trade-off of more specific and strict requirements to activate Mettle is appropriate to it now also activating when healthy, and not being highly unreliable against specific killers. And I don't think that's something to complain about, either - why should MOM not protect against instant-down mechanics or work consistently against some of the most-commonly played killers in the game? And it still costs the survivor a health state, immediately consuming MOM, so the instant-down effect still is a plus, over a regular hit. I also don't really see the risk of it becoming a perk that encourages farming, since BT will be needed to make it work with any consistency, and being farmed with BT is often totally okay (unless the killer is one of those that can manually remove their terror radius).
---
The perk Surveillance makes generators yellow if someone has stopped the regression on a gen you kicked previously.
---
Discordance makes generators yellow if two or more survivors are working on the same gen.
---
Not sure if Ghostface has any perks that turn the gens yellow - maybe the one the blocks all the gens that aren't being worked on? It might make sense if the gens being worked on were highlighted in yellow.
---
I don't remember seeing that when I played, and I'm too frustrated to bother playing anymore. But even if there is some indicator of what direction the survivor was looking at you from (which I really don't think there is honestly), it doesn't matter because the distance is so great. The survivor can be behind a bush, or behind a wall, or on the generator halfway across the map, doesn't really narrow it down.
---
&gt; I dont see how this changes how altruistic survivors usually play.
---
It didn't have anything to do with altruism plays before, so it changes how non-altruistic people running it will play.
---
From what he said, there‚Äôs still quite a bit. Check the top comment. :)
---
Is Ghostface free on PTB?
---
Yeah, could be nice, also reduce BY A LOT the base distance to spot you, like terror 24 meters would be nice, or maybe the distance is based on hia current Terror radius, then in a chase with hia perk would be almost impossible to spot him from a shit tom far
---
Are you new to the game? Have you played killer before they messed up the audio to the point that they have? What is happening now is not intentional.
---
Hey I'm being honest at least
---
It does not.
---
I'd probably change it to 10/20/30 instead to make it so it's not completely useless but also stops people feeling like it's OP
---
Clean up sounds kind of bullshit
---
Same for me but 14 hours ago however the mods did respond.
---
Not if you're the one getting hit
---
They've made entire other killers kn the time it took to edit a pre existing one
---
Press the select button while in a game
---
At this point they should just merge MoM and We're Gonna Live Forever. They're triggered by the exact same thing. Except one of them does **literally nothing** during the game.
---
Get out while you still can
---
Seems like an easy fix. Draw a zone at the center of the survivor's view, require the killer to be in that zone for a specific period of time. This does not rule out the player not actually seeing the killer, but it would be more balanced.
---
Maybe follow the instructions that are right there...
---
firstly, that's now how woooosh works. secondly, there is only one h. third, why the hell would you say that.
---
Agree with everything you said. I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bwqy2j/the_problems_with_ghostface_a_summary/) that summarizes a lot of the issues, too. A lot of people are upset about the killer, including a lot of popular/big name streamers. I just hope BHVR will listen.
---
RIP Enduring
---
Nice.
---
Think about this. 
---
Is OoO in every game? 
---
Do survivors ALWAYS look around them? 
---
It‚Äôs just like when spirit came out, nobody would cleanse hex totems. 
---
Relax. People just know the killer they‚Äôre going to play against and that definitely makes it harder for him.
---
Hes really really bad. I mean the survivors seeing you should end the stealth part of the power not the stalking
---
Hey, we know from experience stealth killers are shit... So lets make a stealth killer thats shit!
---
People thinking devs will fix their game topkek
---
That's pretty amazing, I would love to play that
---
Sounds like a pretty good anti tunnel perk to me.
---
I call her most of the time Miss Piggy.
---
Ghostface gets stunned if he gets spotted ? Seriously ?
---
am i the only one confused about the fact that stunning the killer gives 50 points but doing a sick sabotage play only gives 10?
---
So don't chase the survivor who was on the hook and chase the survivor who unhooked instead?
---
Yeah but most of the time you're chasing someone else, now I get punished if he gets unhooked while I'm chasing someone? Might as well as camp at thay point
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the idea but I mean from the killer perspective when you only see one person leave the jungle gym who are you going after
---
Part of it is the sound, and how quick being "spotted" is. 
---
Part of what makes myers scary is the "oh god, how long has he been standing there?" moments.
---
Yup, quite literally this. The ptb looses game files sometimes when you go back to the main build, so literally just do what it says.
---
Yeah it's worse but we're talking about a perk going from S tier to A tier.
---
DS is still regarded as one of the best survivor perks in the game.
---
Oh shit yea, I just glossed over it!
---
Action speed increases after you open an exit gate? So it's for healing only? lol
---
Yeah but if the person unhooking you is doing so for MoM and you get hit after getting unhooked then they don't get their token for MoM.
---
I hope they add it to her when her new cosmetics drop üò≠
---
The whole stalk someone for 4 seconds without being seen is a stupid unrealistic meme they made up, it just doesn't actually happen in dbd, the vast majority of myer tier up's aren't from survivors who are unaware they're being stalked
---
I aplaud your effort sir, here take my up vote
---
"Why did you close hatch after I crouch spammed over hatch while taunting? Toxic killer reported"
---
Sometimes you can't win
---
Finally something positive that relates to Ghostfaces perks. And I agree can't wait to fall out my chair on accident because of jumpscare Myers.
---
I agree with all of these. I played my first game with him &amp; I was barely able to stalk or do anything. It just felt like an M1 killer with no power.
---
Why would they nerf it?
---
Tried him for a few games, last map was the damn cornfield.
---
Got his stalking power off once throughout all the games. With the way he is, I see him being pretty bad. I normal m1 killer with a useless ability. 
---
That‚Äôs my opinion so far, but I‚Äôm going to continue fucking around with him to see if I discover a new play style or something.
---
Not true.
---
If you know a match have a nurse in it, billy, trapper, even fucking amansa you still can make something. Ghostface Just get fucked by the fact that a single apin of camera spot him, bh don't knew how to make a propper mechanic and that's not ok
---
The funny thing are the gameplays they showed in the stream, where he could stalk 2 people at a time like yea ita gonna happen in a rank 1 game
---
How the perk plays out in theory: Everyone's super happy, randoms are perfectly altruistic, it buffs playing together instead of splitting up and rushing gens, wow!
---
In practice: Randoms farm you for their mettle of man stacks just like they did with WGLF stacks, and the person farming eats a billy chainsaw and doesn't take damage, still has their Dead Hard + Adrenaline and escape after they farmed you twice, killers camp and tunnel even harder so they don't have to deal with MoM.
---
You're seeing it as a wildly different perk because the easy-to-gain stacks are now easy to gain from a different source. I'm seeing it as still cancer because it's an insanely powerful effect (*even stronger than MoM on release*) that survivors will do anything (farm survivors) to get and killers will do anything (camp and tunnel) to stop.
---
But most survivor perks are already just buffs that make gameplay easier. There aren't many playstyle-changing perks for survivors. Windows of Opportunity providing no actual gameplay benefit for the sake of vision of interact points is ridiculously far below the power curve currently.
---
I think you're not wrong and the perk in its current state with 0 drawback or cooldown would be unhealthy for the game but I don't think it's because it makes the game any easier. Rather, I think it's because it would be used in a vaulting build if that ever reaches critical mass, similar to what Mettle of Man did for 'second chance' perks. No one was playing Dead Hard at rank 1 until Mettle of Man came out, because MoM pushed second chance perks to their critical mass, where stacking them all could significantly extend the duration of chases. If enough vault-related perks are ever implemented to stack onto Lithe (Dance with Me is a solid perk but doesn't fit this playstyle) that too could create an unhealthy build, and Windows of Opportunity would likely be included as an enabler.
---
You forgot to mention that detection perks, such as Object Of Obsession and Spine Chill or Premonition completely fuck him, and those perks aren't even bad if the killer isn't Ghost Face, unlike for example Calm Spirit, which is utter shit if the killer isn't Doctor (and even then isn't great)
---
Where are her curls!!!!!!!!!!! This is SO sad.
---
Unhooks
---
It cost them an entier killer but not many people realy know that.
---
I have an idea for Clean Up Isle 9
---
After being unhooked, leave no scratch marks for 5/10/15 seconds.
---
That way you can run away and your teammate will pull aggro instead
---
No actually, dressy actually has a real power unlike this
---
Healing, unhooking, opening up other exit gates, searching chests, breaking totems etc.
---
Cheers! My fellow Kate mains!!!!
---
meg literally saw you place the trap and still got stuck
---
Not hitting the survivors
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused The Hag's Rusty Shackles add-on to play the terror radius when the trap was triggered.
---
oh we grabbin
---
Or a vault sometimes seems to work.

Tier 3 Good Within
---
Or maybe consider his power getting affected by him getting seen is a huge buff to survivors in the PTB...where people will only play Ghostface. 
---
They‚Äôll make a fix. Relax. The community has overreacted about every killer on the PTB and have been wrong quite a few times. Posting about it every five minutes and ripping the devs isn‚Äôt going to make their fix roll out any faster.
---
&gt;Hooked survivors can break your stealth,
---
Probably to prevent camping
---
Still stupid though, being hooked means you have an elevated position and can see more
---
It's actually a good idea, I wish noed would be changed like this. Like, you have to hook every person once in order for noed to activate, so that bad killers wouldn't get cheap kills, as now survivors get cheap escapes.
---
??????????? Yes, survivors ALWAYS look around them, unless you're playing at low ranks. What kind of question is that lmao
---
Aisle*
---
&gt; Is OoO in every game?
---
No, but Spine Chill is one of the best perks in the game and with MoM's Nerf breaking up the Meta Build, it'll probably start seeing more play again.
---
&gt; Do survivors ALWAYS look around them?
---
Uh..... yeah? Anyone who isn't rank 20, anyway.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs just like when spirit came out, nobody would cleanse hex totems.
---
Hex Totems are a subset of perks you can completely avoid if you want. Ghostface's power is baked into him. That's a huge difference.
---
&gt; Relax. People just know the killer they‚Äôre going to play against and that definitely makes it harder for him.
---
There's a difference between knowing what killer you're going up against and that killer being completely worthless when you do. Wraith is a Killer that requires the element of surprise, but is still a M1 Killer who can pop out of nowhere right on top of you. The Survivors can't just cancel his Invisibility and make it useless, they have to strain and pay attention to counter it.
---
The funniest thing is both Ghostface and Freddy were the two big fan demanded killers. They were the most talked about licensed chapters/paragraphs ever before their release.
---
Both of them? Released and either gutted to trash from the gate or immediately after.
---
Gee, it's almost like PTB exists to ascertain how best to balance a killer!
---
While I don't disagree that it's often a sort of crutch perk, allowing a survivor to see something they would otherwise have to learn (on a global, map-spanning but also round-to-round basis), I'm just saying it would then still not be impactful and powerful enough for many people to actually give up a perk slot for it, forgoing other perks in its favor. Experienced and competent survivors are familiar with most window and pallet spawns, and memorize them as the round progresses, so for them it only has limited use. It still has its uses, but not too often valuable enough to always invest 25% of your perk loadout into, as opposed to other perks.
---
The Laurie is seeing the 2 killer glitch in person. lmao
---
Also not Head On, the 1% of the time it actually works properly and doesn't bug out
---
Well then survivors will learn how to counter NOED, that's bad
---
I'm very disappeared I'm hearing that ghost face sucks what a shame...
---
Feck
---
Not really, the scratch marks continue around the corner.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
WE HAVE DISCOVERED HIS TRUE POWER OF DRY HUMPING
---
What's wrong with head on?
---
Sorry but i had to be that guy
---
Holy shit. You're just so adamant that you're right, despite being wrong.
---
Guys, this is the reason they have a PTB, if it shows that this is happening, people can voice their dospleasure like yoy sre doing now, and they will fix it. 
---
(I hope)
---
This
---
It's a 2 perk combo that can be easily played around by dropping pallets earlier. No need to nerf it
---
Her bloody hair now just looks like it's dyed red instead of being like the default but with some strips of hair having blood on it.
---
Did they actually give a date for the Freddy rework? I thought it would be in with this patch
---
Nice to see you're getting weird with it
---
Seems like its the only GOOD thing about him
---
Lol it was not fine at all how it was before. It was very OP against M1 Killers.
---
Survivors learning to counter something? BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH oh give me a sec that was a really funny joke
---
totally don't see a problem here
---
Well if you're chasing someone else, unless the injured party goes through all the same pallets and windows as the guy you're chasing it shouldn't affect you.
---
*The Laurie then DCs.*
---
The wording is poor, but from what I understand, the killer vaults and smashes at 50% speed *only* for windows/pallets that the player running the perk has interacted with.
---
It's not the condition. It's the timer that I am  annoyed about
---
It's just buggy as shit. Often it won't stun the Killer seemingly at random. I've even had a situation once where I jumped out at the Killer, *I saw the stun animation* **and then got grabbed anyways.**
---
.... but it was buffed?
---
Check out - we heard survivors weren‚Äôt being very toxic since  game collapse, lets spice it up...
---
It's sas tho that they released a killer with such a big bug in his machanic (spot) streamers are playing 3 games and giving up, since he is just a m1 killer with no power that have max TR and can teabag
---
yep. Maybe she thought I was faking the movement because I was those almost invisible traps
---
Ironic isn't it, that the egc has completely ruined and nerfed into the ground pretty much all end game builds and perks
---
"get pebbled bitch"
---
Wow this post is literally 1% feedback and 99% asshole
---
Thank you I try
---
Well furthive chase only reduces terror radius while in a chase, so it doesn‚Äôt make you jumscare someone exactly and it doesn‚Äôt do well with M&amp;A
---
Pig=upvote
---
I love that you rated everyone and the match
---
This is surprisingly wholesome
---
If one random farms someone for MoM stacks, that's still one instance of having to deal with it as opposed to the four instances that would have been charged normally since it's just getting hits.
---
If each survivor is racing each other to get the stack, then they're not on Gens, and only one person is getting the stack for actually unhooking them. This is leagues different than "I just get stacks for being caught".
---
New MoM may have problems associated with it. No one is saying it won't. But it **is** a totally different beast than what it was before (You said it wasn't, don't move goalposts) and it is a net nerf for the perk.
---
Well too bad I watch alot of them and he doesn't spout that, but when he does and he's killer its accurate. Because then he plays survivor and gets the dumb as bricks survivors (I'm sure you can relate) and has to deal with body blocking, obvious unsafe saves and other easy to avoid mistakes.
---
AAAANd Ghostface is trash, im sad now
---
It‚Äôs important to assert your dominance by giving someone the hatch rather than letting them find it.
---
Micheal deserves to be tall and sassy! Sure, he may not say anything, but that‚Äôs where all the sas comes from!
---
A decisive strike buff.
---
Oh joy.
---
Bro he‚Äôs so fun!! He‚Äôs not bad he‚Äôs just hard to play at first
---
Why is hunter considered sassy
---
Roadmap indicated he'll be in the mid chapter patch I believe
---
That would be fair
---
And it would really really really discourage you from being chased after unhook
---
sorry, i ain't do the words good. but yeah, all the windows and pallets the survivor slides over or pulls down get "marked" and they slow the killer. these marks disappear either when the survivor gets downed or when the timer runs out.
---
Press the back button in game and it should revert it
---
Yeah they do. Anyone with half a brain would look around. You can literally spin your camera around and it's good.
---
These perks are kinda eh but they're a cool start
---
Oh ok cool, thanks
---
No, unfortunately you have to re-download every time.
---
You'd have to be literally retarded to believe that I was saying it's literally an identical perk to before the change. I'm saying that it's as as much of a fun issue as before and even more of a balance problem. If it's taken you half a dozen comments to realize that, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
Lmfao oh my god I feel that so hard. It's gotten to the point where I've stopped giving hatch unless the survivors are super chill. I'll carry a toxic survivor to the hatch then close it right in front of them, pick them back up, and hook them
---
It's still a buff to counter someone flicking their camera  all over the place.
---
Yea man I feel you and I appreciate you answering. Sometimes I don't understand a person's motives so I like to ask. Just genuinely curious!
---
"Why are so many killers playing billy?"
---
The fact that that most maps are still survivor sided?
---
The fact that survivors still have the best perks overall by a good amount?
---
The fact that there is a 80% survival rate at rank 1? Actually this is the only one that I should have said since it says it all.
---
Hm. Well, cant argue against that.
---
Yea it‚Äôs stupid they should had given him the ability to hide in the locker and have no heart beat when u hide
---
I believe the PTB and your full game are separate games. 
---
You should have your progress still in the actual game.
---
Yeah, that's my point. M&amp;A reduces it with myers in a chase, and furtive, as you said only reduces it in a chase. The only time where his terror radius is big.
---
u/not_queen, while you have this PTB up can you guys look at adjusting Legion‚Äôs Killer Instinct with Iridicent Button? On multiple occasions I‚Äôve hit someone and gotten no notification until I run into what would be my normal terror radius, but the button should make me see them globally.
---
Quality posting.
---
[Peanits said that the 360 degree thing to cancel his power shouldnt happen](https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a)
---
&gt;Getting hit after taking two steps after a vaulted window gets tiresome.
---
Unless you manage to get 1ms in the server located closest to you, this will still happen. 
---
The closest server to me when they were testing gives 90ms so I shouldn't expect many changes in this regard.
---
According to the official road map, it looks like September is the goal for dedicated servers:

---
They had to buff her 3 times.
---
I genuinely think they will fix him, but knowing some of the brain dead devs idk.
---
That's my situation. I can barely follow scratch marks.
---
S L U G T I M E
---
How am a wrong, what about this seems to suggest that this is the live build. Its clearly bugged, there is no getting around the fact that ghostface is in it and therefore it is impossible that it is the live build. There's no counter argument to this.
---
Forgot Pig gets = 70 points for being from my favo horror movies so she is now oficially 10 times better.
---
Hm. With my first words beeing the ptb and Ghostface beeing the only new thing in the ptb. Who could i possibly mean?
---
But is it really a downside to the survivors if they get her butt in the face? I fell this misses the point of teabagging.
---
So if i earn blood points in the ptb i wont get them in the actuall game?
---
How about a killer one where it‚Äôs 4 toolboxes that doesn‚Äôt spark joy cuz the game lasts 4 mins
---
Or those flashlights, or 4 swf joining the lobby at the same time.
---
His ability should had been to hide in the locker then his heart beat stops and u can just pop out and attack a survivor doing a generator
---
Exactly, but the devs missed that.
---
The only positive thing about this entire PTB is that he‚Äôll be changed.
---
Now imagine Skilled Huntress on PS4. Or original Deranged Pursuit.
---
;(
---
That too, and Premonition
---
While we're on the subject, what exactly are the rules to Piggy's traps in Endgame now? I've seen teammates escape with their traps on, through the gates. When I tried it, my head got popped. I was slugged though, does that matter?
---
Valve don't really have a great working relationship with Microsoft these days, Valve for example wanted the L4D DLCs for free like PC, but Microsoft basically forced their hand in charging, which I'd imagine would again happen if Bill were released on Xbox.
---
Plus, Steam itself is owned by Valve and it'd make much better sense to have Bill on their own platform than a third party, Valve get a set percentage of whatever's sold on Steam and wouldn't have to deal with working out how much they'd be getting if Bill were on Xbox as a DLC character.
---
Yep. Should be the case.
---
It literally doesn't move anymore
---
Best part is: I play as P3 Claudette.
---
No, but I hope the survivor that did it isn't expecting me to play nice afterwards.
---
Correct
---
As a Kate main I approve!
---
Going with the ol‚Äô bing bong boi eh?
---
I started with Freddy because the version of the game I bought came with him. I have had a lot of fun with Freddy, looking forward to the rework.
---
Is it the Roar? If so, I hope they see if it's a good change. Like Myers not having his EW1 stalk sound. Would be a good buff for her since SB is still a hard counter.
---
Active traps means no gate escape
---
Inactive traps mean free ecscape
---
Traps only get powered by a gen being finished so all gens done means Pig has no real power left.
---
Devs need to stop this obsession to make killers powers reliant on survivors actions. They made Plague, a killer who literally need to wait for survivors to give her full power and survivors can decide if, when and where she gets her Corrupt Purge ( which also can be countered by a simple pallet stun btw ), while Ghostface's power is literally countered by survivors existing. At least with Plague you get punished for not cleansing, with broken status effect, maybe it's not too much, but it's something, but with Ghostface's you don't get punished at all for ignoring his power, I mean at all.
---
They should also add the supermarket from the trailer with the ability to shut the lights off/on
---
Ooooh... that gives a totally different context. Yeah, it really read to me, personally, as "This change was so easy for them to do".
---
lmao imagine if this game had a less toxic, more helpful community
---
Pretty sure she is the entity tho.
---
Kate's hair looks amazing now though.
---
I honestly can‚Äôt tell if this is a joke or not...
---
Lol it didn't click with me at first that that was what it sounded like
---
110% with this post. 
---
Also sometimes having a silly name as a survivor might bait people into playing your favourable killer.
---
(That's definitely the reason why my steam name is now "choke me daddy Myers")
---
Can confirm it works
---
Survivors don‚Äôt look around them? 
---
**LMFAO!!!**
---
Or well, anybody who is above rank 20 does
---
As killer, I find BPS makes survivors vanish without a trace. 2 gens pop, then 3 in quick succession, then the game ends.
---
Lmao imagine if I had friends or a girlfriend....I AM SO SAD AND LONELY.
---
and now shes good, I think the real take away is the fact that they buffed her 3 times to make sure she was ready for live.
---
Beat me to it brother. Have an upvote haha
---
So they just made it easier to rank up for survivor? I never had a problem ranking with survivor. Killers can still depip with a 3k though.
---
lmao yeah those poor millionaires getting bullied by reddit
---
small indie gaming company btw
---
same !!
---
Gotcha. Yeah, I don't play Piggy, but I cringed when I saw a dude escape with a trap on. There were other ways to handle it. Maybe make the likelihood of getting the trap off bigger if in Endgame, maybe slow the EGC even more if there is a trap on anyone. I don't know, anything, instead of just taking it away.
---
Just got on and played for myself, it's much better
---
Well darn...
---
Any reason for ‚Äún*ob?‚Äù rather than just saying it?
---
This is interesting.
---
The TV show is called  "When They See Us"
---
Well... i saved 88 000 blood points for no reason...
---
He's flat out garbage, and so are his perks. 1 fucking second to cancel a killer's powers. ONE SECOND. They actually managed a way to bring over their insanely easy and braindead "totem cleansing" system to a killer's base powers. Now suvivors can basicly cleanse ghostface'd base powers in the EASIEST WAY POSSIBLE, with no skill at all. You truly have to work at being this bad at brainstorming a killer to achieve what BHVR is doing.
---
&gt; What is ACTUALLY FUN IN THIS GAME is doing well and not having to feel held down by the capabilities of the killer in an already survivor sided game.
---
PREACH. It's not fun being destroyed in games by survivors. Something that BHVR doesn't seem to grasp. FUN is having a great chance at winning due to your own skill, and not being dependent on survivors lack of skill.
---
What needs to happen is the spotting range needs to be reduced to 16-24m.
---
They never gave her any real love and just nerfed her. Fix her end game traps, crouch speed, add-ons and MORE OINKS!
---
I like security.
---
I mean not to sound too rude but it is a lot like a bunch of amateurs got really lucky with a game genre and market that wasn't really saturated at all. 
---
I mean shit, they use Unreal Engine 4! Some games that are some of the nicest, smoothest running games in the business with the most used engine, and they use it and it runs like fucking garbage with 0 optimization.
---
Let me just clarify some things.
---
1. Sabotage permanently sabotages that one generator for the rest of the game meaning if it is completed them it will implode. it's disadvantage is that it can be ignored considering the killer has to make a choice in the first min of the of which gen needs to be sabotaged.
---
2. As for I'll save you, I feel it has a ton of drawbacks that make it balanced. For example it has decaying movement speed so trying to outrun the killer wont work considering most Downed survivors are close to the killer. Additionally it is hard for you to pallet loop due to slow vaulting speeds.
---
I do agree with the Bravery criticism so I will re-edit it
---
I was able to understand the "chapter" being just a killer, for whatever reason. It makes no sense to me, and seems lazy, but maybe they just didn't wanna make a survivor and map that had people wouldn't care about, but when you make Ghostface, arguably one of the most HIGHLY requested killers in the game this shitty, I don't even know what to think. 
---
The killer is worse than Legion on release, and at least that was an actual chapter.
---
Its ok you dont need Anyone to be happy you are the best you have ever been and you are worth everything. If others dont see it they dont Reserve you.
---
How is ghost worst exactly?
---
This has nothing to do with bug fixing genius.
---
Ghostface is horrible and his power has major flaws that clearly were overlooked
---
No.  They buffed her two of those times on live.  She was released in a bad state.
---
Honestly this needs to be built into WGLF. Plus also extra mini sprint burst for the unhooked/protected person
---
Wow, that is so dumb. They need to rework that shit asap
---
damn i see it now. i kind of want to make another one now lol
---
Are we talking about Ghostface? I saw Tru3 playing for a bit but didn‚Äôt stay long. The power looks easy to counter and comes across as a weaker Pig.
---
Check out and clean up could use some change but I like the idea of security
---
Sorry thats my bad, my memory is poor on that part of the game.
---
Freddys sassy? 
---
Yeah actually he is
---
He can still stalk without the stealth though no?
---
Gotta dehumanise those ‚Äòsweaty killers‚Äô /S
---
It‚Äôs a cheap karma grab as the Reddit is as survivor biased as the game. 
---
Every anti killer post gets 4 times the votes
---
Anything that doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative gets 4 times the downvotes. 
---
Pretty sad really and you can tell the people who play both killer and survivor. 
---
I can‚Äôt understand the us vs them mentality, like some of them are literally playing half the game they paid for and acting like they don‚Äôt want the other half to play at all. 
---
We need both sides to be fun and fair or if one side stops playing we can‚Äôt play the game.
---
Rank 20s who never turn their cameras
---
\*waves\* hello fellow dutchmen/women
---
WGLF is basically a free blood point perk, I don't think it needs to be any better
---
Ikr
---
His way of saying it.
---
Carl best survivor
---
&gt; All Killer swing animations have been modified to match the distance at which they can hit a survivor. This was done to help mitigate situations where a Killer would hit a survivor but their weapon/ hand would not look like it was reaching the Survivor.
---
People on this sub fucking shat on me for saying there was a clear disorienting problem with killer lunges, especially with legion. This change feels so validating.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug though
---
People can make his power useless.
---
They literally nerfed the perk, what more do you want
---
Give ghostface his flip phone back!
---
If you turn your camera around as a survivor he has no power at all.
---
SO disappointing. All time hyped killer isn't even technically from it's own movie, missing it's iconic costume, no survivor, no map, and he's the worst killer yet.
---
Also his perks are shit.
---
Didn't think so. ;)
---
Just spin your camera around from what it looks like.
---
wait what happened to his cell phone :(
---
That's what the PTB is for guys, it's not the official version yet
---
Enduring is now 14% faster against pallet stuns. It no longer affects other stuns from head on or enduring, but those are much less frequent. So definitely a buff overall.
---
I thought they already had to look at you for a certain amount of time before it spotted you?
---
How long does it take from when you played?
---
Dead hard was the second most used perk by survivors ranks 1-4 pre mettle of man lmao. Confirmed by the dev statistics.
---
*waves back* hi, actually Dutch-speaking Belgian ;)
---
Nope, Stealth and stalk fucking gone because a survivor 360's his camera somewhere near you.
---
Yeah exactly 9/10 I will let last survivor out of the hatch especially if they had a quitter on their team(so like every game). But that kindness ends the second they get toxic. Like I don't mind pallet looping and using flashlights and stuff that's part of the game. But like you crouch spam every time you drop a pallet and like tease? Boi I will smack em down with the fury of NOED.
---
I understand why NOED gets so much hate but for me its just for punishing people who extend the game on purpose after exit gates are open.
---
Friendly killer mains unite!
---
He can't stalk without stealthing, and survivors have to look at you for about 0.5 seconds to break your stealth.
---
I agree but who the fuck is Greg?
---
Yes, but if people don't complain, they'll think they did a great job and pat themselves on the back and call it a day.
---
the camera fits his lore

The Plague is not a trash killer.
---
Survivors detecting you is broken right now
---
New player here and I just hate Wraith with a low cool down on his cloaking abilities due to his speed buff upon exiting and Micheal myers Because When ever i end up running into him (usually for the first time) He walks like he‚Äôs running and instantly downs be because he‚Äôs just...so..,.Fast!
---
:o
---
Hey devs, first you lied that Enduring would counter DS (a perk countering another perk - what a crazy idea), then you went back on that.
---
Then you buffed DS a few weeks later to a ridiculous 5 second stun.
---
Then you said on your stream that you'll alter that ridiculous 5 second stun time when you nerf Enduring... yet still we don't see anything in the patch notes about that stun time being reduced back to 3 seconds.
---
Killers haven't forgotten, and we aren't asleep at how you are trying to make DS even more of a god-tier perk. Keep your word and put the stun back to 3 seconds since you unnecessarily nerfed one of our only strong killer perks.
---
DEVS PLEASE WE NEED IT
---
Aaaand Ghostface is literally worse than pre-rework Freddy. Congrats BHVR, you did a pretty good job so far.
---
DLC release's centered around Ghostface. People are more interested in Carl The Cashier
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
Just don‚Äôt tunnel. Problem solved.
---
that's actually worse than what he currently is now
---
didn't the devs say they were making their "own" ghostface since the license is just the mask and anyone can be behind the mask. That's what I remember them talking about in the Anniversary Stream.
---
I was kinda hoping we would be able to use the old ones this year too but it‚Äôs not looking promising:‚Äô)
---
What does amercian kate look like?
---
yeah the man behind ghostface is either a reporter or a journalist
---
I love the growl when he gets pallet stunned though.
---
I looked through all of the hairstyles for the females and I'm very disappointed by some of the changes. All of Feng's long hairs look completely different and aren't what I paid for a year ago.
---
wheres this image from?
---
I would stand in front of the locker and simply hit with my weapon. If someone was in the locker they would take the hit and fall out. I'm sure this has worked for as long as I have played the game although I notice someones reply that it is a glitch.
---
What about making it were the survivors need to get him in the center of their fov for two seconds to kick him out?
---
If there was a dc and the player wasn‚Äôt toxic then I always give the hatch to the last player.
---
What is WGLF
---
No he cannot.
---
Survivors just have to spin their camera around and if you happen to be in a 0.00005 second frame of that camera spin your power is gone instantly.
---
Clean up, isle 9 should take affect if you get unhooked while in the terror radius similar to borrowed time.
---
Honestly this makes me wish a DBD mini series existed. The season would revolve around the survivors trying to escapee the realm but each episode shows their backstory, and as the season progresses we get closer to them opening the gates. It cold even function like the Clue movie with different endings to show who lives and dies. NETFLIX MAKE IT HAPPEN
---
How do you stand playing that guy when he moans so loud?
---
Nothing is set in stone, they can still tweak so many things.
---
do bubba
---
Pretty much unfortunately
---
I've thought on it, and either of these two could work:
---
Looking at Ghostface slows down his stalk speed, and increases the amount needed to expose.
---
Or
---
The survivor model needs to actually be facing Ghostface to prevent it
---
not much physics anymore sadly, hopefully will be getting fixed
---
Ohhh, thank you for explaining. I don't have any of the DLC characters so that would explain why I was confused
---
what is bbq?
---
It's even worse than I had feared. Not only does he have no in-chase tools, but his ability can often be rendered useless entirely, apparently even through walls, and only needing to roughly look in his direction. This is pretty terrible design.
---
check out sounds like a no one left behind ++
---
Which is a good thing because that perk needs some love
---
They cant increase the chances because it's not rng. They already said that every player is assigned a box at the beginning of the game. However, maybe they could give out a second key to everyone? Or a trap counts as being downed or hooked, effectively giving the player time if egc starts when a trap us already on their head. Still a nerf to piggy, but not as bad as before
---
https://imgur.com/a/mlTWJZ3
---
FeelsBadMan. But I think I got the original Deranged Pursuit from farming games. Eventually the survivors caught on to what I was trying to do and let me do it.
---
i suppose a camera fits *better* but it's not like being a journalist makes the cell phone not fit at all
---
it's 10000 times less funny to me with the camera than the cell phone
---
Is tier 1 Myers really immune to aura reading from survivors? I never knew.
---
bishop
---
yeah fuck fun, it's all about winning. Fun is one of the main things you should consider as it's the reason people play video games you mug, viability should be the afterthought.
---
But I totally agree that he is a doggy dogshit killer with nothing going for him except he looks cool.
---
I knew it since the stream, they can (WILL FOR FUCKING SURE) cancel your power... garbage indeed...
---
THIS. ALL IF THIS.
---
In my defense, I only play this game for 10 days, I need damn WGLF bloodpoints.
---
right so you can just run around and throw down every pallet early for the hillbilly to chainsaw it. You know. One of the most broken killers in the game getting his abusive perk combo buffed
---
Thank fuck that‚Äôs not an intended feature
---
Really? It looks like a clump to me
---
(You Spin Me) Right Round.mp3
---
That's your meta.
---
My favorite item though
---
Please make Vigil viable
---
As a future Ghostface main I agree. His power with all its counterplay is unacceptable it's too easy to counter his power and perks like Spine Chill and OoO destroy him.
---
Or, they could actually use the PTB for its intended purpose, and modify him in it before taking it to live servers.
---
He's the new Freddy
---
That's definitely true to, flashlight is for blinding a killer at the pallet and then actually getting away.
---
But idk it is what it is, I feel like survivors are way more toxic than killers. And that's from playing survivor in the past. Survivors drive killers to toxicity and then complain after
---
10/10
---
I really want to see it but no one has posted about it, not a Pc player :(
---
Honestly? it's why I just play as a gen jockey.
---
That‚Äôs why he is being tested... üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the red stain showing while crouched is probably a glitch. And you have to probably be facing him for him to get out of stalk/crouch? (Idk maybe test this). Also instead of voicing your concerns here; post your evaluation on the dbd official forums so they can see your feedback quicker ? Also the crouch leaning against obstacles to hide, is probably another glitch they will fix. Just have to let them know so they can fix it.
---
Finally, someone who actually understands the point of a PTB
---
I‚Äôm a console player so I won‚Äôt be able to play as him until he is released, but yeah he seems very underwhelming from what I‚Äôve seen. 
---
Survivors see you before you have a chance at seeing them most of the time, so good luck stalking
---
Been playing for years on Xbox one. 
---
It's fine and has a very active community. Wait times are short on survivor and killer
---
What does Spine do again I forgot cuz I never run it
---
*within
---
*aisle
---
I guess. Wouldn't be surprised if GF needs a rework tho. Left this game a year ago over incompetent devs, seems they haven't changed.
---
And perhaps make it so that his "peering" around corners doesn't count as line of sight for survivors. That way they have to run away or run towards Ghostface to get a better look at him, thus putting themselves in danger. If they aren't quick enough to react, they get hit.
---
Bill definitely died before being pulled.
---

---
Fellow new player here who downloaded the game with Game pass. The game is definitely worth trying out. 
---
Killer matchup times aren't that bad. I think it may depend on the time that you queue up. 
---
Starting out as a level 1 isn't bad at all. I feel like I've mostly been matched with people of my own skill level and it doesn't take long to get the basics down either. 
---
Overall, I'd say if you have GamePass give it a shot. Especially if you think it looks interesting as chances are you'll enjoy the game. Just dont be surprised if you get the odd salty message here and there.
---
It's a PTB, and he's not even been on there a full day
---
it's already been confirmed that the power is bugged. the powers not supposed to be countered that easily.
---
Not a good one either
---
I think they got burned by Legion. After hearing (justified) complaints of ‚Äúno counterplay‚Äù for months, they decided that every new killer must have counterplay - but in the form of the survivors having total control over the killer‚Äôs ability to use their power, for some reason. 
---
It‚Äôs sad, they‚Äôre obviously listening to the community‚Äôs feedback but I don‚Äôt think they understand what the feedback really means.
---
The problem is the fact that they released this in the first place.
---
Apparently the camera spin breaking his ability isn‚Äôt supposed to happen, so by the time the ptb is finished that should be resolved at least.
---
Fuck her p3 hair actually looks good now but I have too much content on her to prestige üò¢
---
Well it says something along the lines where she was so angry she just couldn‚Äôt let death take her so she made a vow or something but then closed her eyes so yeah she died at the time the entity took her
---
Classic bEhavior seeming like they don't actually play the game they are making.
---
you could  made the first picture like the second, like he was stalking and not stoping because someone spined his camera.
---
No. This isn‚Äôt like the Plague where it took time. His ability it literal trash.
---
Hot üòç
---
It's because he's bugged
---
Survivors can apparently see you through walls so lol
---
Isn't that the point though? The power isn't supposed to work every single time, that'd be OP. The power should be able to not work every now and then, just like a hillbilly missing a chainsaw hit or a nurse missing a blink hit.
---
I do agree that it's not fair that they can do it from across the map though, there should be a minimum distance they can spot you from.
---
If this is put into the game, I'm not buying it. Simple as that.
---
He works differently from other killers. No one has yet to learn when to use it and what situations have opened up for it. My bet is people are playing him like Myers thinking it's the same thing. 
---
I've been finding use for it to make survivors think I've left a gen or something
---
I vote for "Nea and the Pussycats"
---
I suppose the cellphone is too close to Wes Craven's Ghostface.
---
How can you complain about DS now? It's not a problem anymore, it's balanced, if you have to complain about it: you're the problem.
---
And making at least 1/3rd of the community feel scammed and have trust issues for nearly 2 years...
---
The look to break functionality isn‚Äôt working as intended, only actively looking forward with the survivors head facing him should break it, so point 1 will likely be changed.
---
Technically they are, this isn't a huge company that makes billions a year like Riot Games or Blizzard.
---
My life is complete now, thanks dude.
---
After thinking about it, no, they're just gonna need him until his only power is t-bagging and crying in the corner.
---
It has nothing to do with him working differently you‚Äôre not understanding that. The way his power functions sucks at the core.
---
Yea that's normal. Usually the walls with like lining ones yea they can see you so you would pretty much crouch walk towards the pallet back area so you just pop up and hit them.
---
Maybe if he‚Äôs reworked or massively buffed
---
I am not even a reserve?
---
Nigga, when you shut down a killers whole power just by looking at him. Theres a problem right there. Half the time the survivors dont even notice him there but because they spinning their cameras at mach 5 they just gotta catch the nigga shoe tip and it's over for him.
---
He sucks
---
There‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù about how to play him if a survivor can 360 their camera and cancel your power without them actually noticing you. 
---
Add to that the power can be cancelled by a survivor on the hook or dying state looking at you or a survivor looking in your direction through walls/obstacles. You can‚Äôt learn how to play good in that instance.
---
Since I read the supposed change, I've been thinking about a specific scenario where you get protection hits very easily (from a WGLF user). 
---
MoM is definitely in a better place because it won't punish killers mid chase but, getting 3 stacks isn't as hard as people think.
---
For those that don't know, if you get hit while standing over someone slugged or standing in front of someone hooked, it counts as a protection hit.
---
The scenario I was thinking of, is deliberately unhooking in front of the killer in order to get 2 stacks instead of just one for safe unhooking.
---
Here is a video demonstrating it: https://streamable.com/vi0on
---
I absolutely agree, holy shit. New favourite stun noise. Some people say it sounds like he's fed up with pallets tho lmao
---
There is allready r/PerkByDaylight tho
---
He is being misplayed.
---
Where do you think you're gonna get by making a post like this?
---
I agree. When they announced the new perks during the livestream I was super let down. They‚Äôre all incredibly situational and pointless. Like seriously, why would I take up a perk slot to make my terror radius a little smaller during a chase when there are tons of perk options that will actually contribute to me getting a 4K or having a better game?
---
problem is that it's already too easy to pip as survivor. So they should have compensate by reducing emblem scoring in an other category.
---
You clearly haven't played him. There's no "learning curve" when a survivor just 360 spins their camera and renders your power completely useless despite the fact that they have no idea where you are and can't actually see you.
---
His power is bad
---
You forgot to put the salt flair
---
No
---
only killer
---
Hahaha wouldn't you be Aswell? Haha. Yeah pig used to be the best as it was kinda cute but ghostface easy beats that.
---
It's still a PTB and people complaining it sucks haven't even seen the full release. BHVR has made changes before and we all know it. They will make the necessary changes so he works.
---
The more nitty gritty of his ability will be at it's core stealth which is different from how Pig works
---
Security seems ok, but the other two seem way too op
---
I really doubt you would do any better, stop harrasing a usually decent dev team. The fact they arent top tier players is irrelevant I couldnt imagine actually playing a game I developed id be bored shitless
---
Plague is fine
---
Ghostface sucks but seriously they cant fix him its a ptb
---
Get rid of the red stun affect for killers. Pretty lame too be honest.
---
OP you're an idiot. Watch 5 games or more and you literally see how trash and weak his power is.
---
it's gonna stay, sorry
---
I approve this message
---
It will probably belong to the guy stuck in the entity explaining perks.
---
What does he sound like? I haven't heard him yet.
---
Imo I think it looks nice
---
Like i said above, your fact is incredibly misleading. If you die at rank 1 then you're more than likely now a rank 2 which is what makes that stat the way it is. Unless you seriously think 80% of rank 1 survivors are escaping against the massive amounts of billys and nurses at rank 1
---
I had no idea what this was for a second until I see the red stain and I zoomed and this kinda freaked me out.
---
Running the killer is the biggest indicator of skill in DBD. I see no problem wanting to get these players up to rank 1 quickly.
---
That stat doesn't count those that depip. Literally look at any other rank
---
History has shown they don't change to much from ptb release to final release
---
Fun facts about Ghost Face that are not immediately obvious from just reading his power description:
---
- the stalking puts a "progress circle" on survivors, when it is full they are exposed
---
- the stalking circle stays on survivors even if you get spotted and knocked out of your stealth mode
---
Doesn't that sound good? Like you could slowly charge it a little bit over the course of a game even if you get spotted super quickly, kind of like how Myers can charge his power to 99% and then go to tier 3 when he wants?
---
Too bad! The progress circle expires over time, and rather quickly too!
---
Oh, and also this:
---
- when you attack a survivor that has the progress circle, the circle empties and goes away immediately
---
So if you get the stalk progress to 99% and get spotted, you can't just leave and return later to finish it and get the Exposed effect on that survivor because the progress will have expired by then. And if you attack a survivor you have partially stalked you have wasted the time you spent stalking.
---
also,  just make that him can only stalk stationary survivors, and survivors cannot break him out.  so that way if you see him, you just run away, keeping the ideia of "spotting" him.
---
Myers is as fast as every other killer once he gets to Tier 2.
---
Wraith is scary for the new players, but he's actually one of the weakest killers.
---
The cell phone was already modeled and was 10 times better. It's not like it necessarily contradicted the lore either. The camera just distances this killer from Scream even farther.
---
I would agree with you on this except about half the posts/comments state why he is broken in a very objective manner. He is broken and you can't it at all unless no one looks around.
---
Honestly, these perks are pretty good. I would like them in game, even with different names, if we didn‚Äôt get Carl.
---
Better to start weak and get buffed, than to start strong and get Freddy.
---
You made my day, I love you
---
Gee guys wait a little bit before screaming for ~~nerfs~~ buffs. üôÑ Killers not even out yet
---
Well I've played 5 games and he's not trash that's for sure. He's not top tier but he works. He does have bugs atm. My point with this post is that it's a Public TEST build. This isn't the final ghostface. They will change it and people writing him off as trash don't have play time to justify it besides piggybacking on what others say. NO ONE has experience to say if he's trash or good yet.
---
But how they didn't realise this through internal testing is mind boggling.
---
This is actually amazing
---
Which is probably why they did it.
---
Using the third person camera isn‚Äôt actually supposed to do that according to someone from bhvr, it‚Äôs intended to only work if the survivor‚Äôs head is facing forward towards ghostface. It should be fixed before release.
---
Im being honest with you, in his current state he is absolute doghsit, beyond bad and his ability is useless. He might eventually get better but trying to defend this ability right now is nonsense, its terrible.
---
Like a low spectral grunt
---
But Micheal ain‚Äôt trash
---
I mean, OoO has been fucking Pig and Wraith forever and bhvr hasn't changed that. I doubt they really give a shit about the stealth killers. Either way, OoO shouldn't work against a killer using a stealth power, having a perk being able to deny a killer their power is stupid.
---
For real?
---
I'll have to play some more matches since atm it hasn't felt like that to me. Tbf the maps I've gotten have been things like the red forest and the game where it's unlikely it would be like that. 
---
I can say that I've been in chases with the ability and been able to stalk when someone turns a corner. Might be buggy on both ends
---
They look too clean and too different from what I paid for, that's my problem.
---
care to explain?
---
Wasted opportunity :( thx!
---
You've been infected by the laughter
---
Are you sure about that? Recently if there‚Äôs a Wraith no one escapes. He uncloaks- Gets his 1 second speed buff, Lands an attack, Follows up with another attack because he seems to speed up crazy fast. It really doesn‚Äôt make sense from my experience
---
They also buffed clown multiple times. He's still shit a year later.
---
He works?.... Are you serious... You LOOK at him and he loses his power. You. Can cancel his power looking through walls and objects. 
---
As it stands his power is trash and the worst and weakest they've released.
---
Two weeks isn't much time to fix his issued to make him remotely viable.
---
Cool. I just don't trust these devs to make any good changes. Have a good one.
---
They don't. We learned this from several large updates they have put out over the years.
---
I love BHVR and will continue to support them, but they are the worst company I've seen when it comes to Quality Assurance testing. (Besides maybe FO76)
---
I think a good change would be force survivors to actually turn themselves towards him, would take more effort to cancel it. To compensate the time it takes to do that, maybe slow down the timer when you only turn your camera ?
---
The description says the red stain will disappear if the gauge is full.
---
Anyway, that's another problem. I cannot stalk because my TR doesn't even disappear so I will always alert survivors (even the ones that doesn't look around).
---
Point 2 is how it‚Äôs actually supposed to work, 360 camera breaking it is a bug, not sure if point 1 is intended though, hope that changes.
---
I bought all feng min hair but disliked the long one cause it looked like a child cut her hair, I respect your opinion though, its diffrent then what we bought.
---
I just think yelling "He's trash" ATM instead of giving the devs what's going on and how people feel before a full release is stupid. 
---
I don't mind if people want to tell me things I haven't noticed yet or haven't experienced but despite all that I still stand by that no one can justify calling the character trash until people have played him enough
---
Ghostface is bugged currently. 360 shouldnt be working to spot him.
---
sorry to hear that :(
---
I have not yet acquired the skills nor perks to counter tryhard behaviour :(
---
In the moment you see him with the camera, you will automatically stop and move your character. So... still useless.
---
I never play as Jeff, but holy shit that is bad. Lmao that explains why I‚Äôm always able to find injured Jeff‚Äôs so easily when I‚Äôm playing Killer
---
No. Hes bad curtrently because his power is bugged and working incorrectly.
---
Ah ah ah! None of the sass!
---
Yes, MOMMMMM
---
Dem sunglasses tho
---
Alrighty, I'll update the list quick
---
360 isnt supposed to work as someone confirmed. Hes just bugged
---
Right now. He's the worst. 
---
His power is cancelled by a survivor following you around
---
Ooops. My mistake. I started with Meg about a week ago. Should have double checked. Thanks for the correction.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this an intended change when the Plag came out ?
---
I have always liked Pop and these changes are amazing to me.
---
I want Myers EW1 sound back though :(pax
---
This perks actually dope, not gonna lie
---
It is still here, it got slightly buffed and slightly nerfed, a good survivor can now use it better, a bad survivor can now still use it just less perfectly.

---
Ahh thank you. I wish he made a bit more noise in game, I think you can hear him breathing but I haven't played ptb yet.
---
Yep, and they're not busy doing gens or anything, they have nothing else to do up on that hook except make sure that Ghosty loses his power.
---
Yeah, a medium-speed circle will do much better than rapid-fire wiggling it
---
Admittedly I missed that, and that‚Äôs entirely on me. Aside from that though, you could easily have been talking about Freddy or the Legion.
---
I see your point though.
---
I've played for years, but I don't have the free time to grind bloodpoints. I love that perk and I don't think it needs any improvement. If you don't need it, don't use it
---
Stalks someone for 2-4 seconds and can oneshot the  person for the next 15 seconds
---
Hes just bugged! 360 isnt supposed to stop his power.
---
Instead of punching you, he stabs you.
---
Cue suicidal bodyblocking
---
It's a bug. Been confirmed.
---
The killer snatched her weave.
---
Well for me it's so adjusted that I can't even hear it anymore
---
hmm, not sure. I was just trying to slap something on to make it more viable than just an end game perk
---
He is the worst. The low tier killers at least have a power. His power doesn't do anything.
---
I‚Äôve seen people saying that the volume is reduced for killers on the PTB as well so maybe they just forgot to include it.
---
That sounds like what the devs are wanting to do with the upcoming Archive.
---
Hes bugged. His power isnt supposed to be stopped by a 360, survivors to meant to acaullty look at him with their characters
---
I really like that idea. Forcing a certain number of hooks for it to activate would make it fair and still incredibly powerful.
---
How is it too late, at most you will get hit once, after that you can drop the pallets early. If the killer has Enduring, which you can tell easily from how long their stun is, you can reasonably expect Spirit Fury as well and play around it. It's two perks, for a free hit (which isn't even guaranteed, there's spots in the game where you can get to a vault or another pallet even if the killer breaks a pallet with Spirit Fury+Enduring) once per game.
---
#GOOD JOB MCOTE
---
Changed Feng's long hair cosmetic too.
---
That also doesn't work.
---
But will they?
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs a bug
---
Honestly, I'd rather have 2 good maps than 4 rushed ones needing reworks all the time.
---
Freddy is getting buffed to Mid Tier.
---
Well, if we're going entirely based off of fun, the entire experience of survivor is *more than likely* to be negative just based on how the game functions entirely. Unless the killer is ungodly terrible or just letting you win, they are more than likely to get anywhere from 1-3k. If you consider dying as a survivor to be 'not fun' then you aren't going to enjoy the experience.
---
I just straight up refuse to stream survivor anymore based purely on how frustrating the experience is. It makes the stream really negative and I can't have that. It's much less frustrating to get 1k on killer than it is to die as a survivor.
---
Somebody want to inform this guy what "TEST build" means?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it is or isn‚Äôt overpowered. I‚Äôm just saying (in Ash‚Äôs way) I don‚Äôt need it to play well.
---
Surveillance and that new Ghosty perk will be god-tier on Freddy
---
Ghostface is just bugged
---
Did you even look at the stream? We're getting 2 maps, and 2 MAP REWORKS.
---
Lol. Do people seriously go back to the hook like Pavlov's dog when they get unhook notification? Talk about amateur play.
---
This is how you lose other survivors easily. The fact is, when you wasting time going back, someone is doing their gen duty uninterrupted thanks to your single minded obsession. 
---
Instead you could have been patrolling the gens. Then those gens won't get ' rushed' like some people claim they are.
---
Plus the thing I don't like is that it's on Laurie, who's perks are designed to make her a powerful Survivior. But bc Decisive got the rework, which was a hard nerf to the obsession, OOO is just too risky. 
---
That's why I kinda wish they kept DS as a perk that Surviviors had more agency over, even tho I understand why they decided to rework it. Just saying the way I would have reworked it would have been a lot different
---
Remember when Legion was on PTB and they did nothing to fix his core issues? That's why I don't trust them. If they let Legion go through, a killer considered by most to be one of the worst things to happen to this game - what won't they let through
---
Hes bugged! His power is not working as its supposed to.
---
Is this out on Xbox?
---
Yeah the vault changes are pretty bad.
---
Work in progress note tho! There is hope that it won't go through.
---
That still doesn't mean it's not good. You would still need hands on match experience. Doesn't work in a bugged sense? I can agree with that to a degree.
---
Doesn't work because it's bad? Ya no one has the experience for that yet
---
But there is no reason for these sounds. You can't do anything without alerting them.
---
Ghostface is just bugged!
---
https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a
---
1) to cancel his power look at him with the center pf your screen (middle 11%, like ... play tik tak toe on your screen, pick the middle square, there. This size.)
---
2) look at him for 1 full second. 
---
3) make it only within 30 Meters. OR: make it 45 Meters with 4 seconds looking, 30 Meters with 3 Seconds looking, 25 Meters with 2 sec, 20 or less Meters 1 second. This way you can only "interact" with ghostfaces Ability in close range. 
---
4) fix your Line of Sight bullshit. Walls should stop that ofc. Michael Myers Line of Sight Mechanics work, so why not Ghostface? 
---
... I buy every DBD DLC. Every. Single. One. But now i think we should stop buying bugged shit, until they fix it. :-/ there's still a lot of potential with Ghostface. They'll fix it, hopefully. Probably.
---
What? This is blatant misinformation. Right on the data sheets it states that they were for the week leading up to April 7. Ash was released April 2.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests
---
I'm also a huge fan of how they changed Pop Goes the Weasel, actually. Having that extra time is going to be damn nice if you have a specific target in mind. I can't count the amount of times I've booked it to the generator that needs its ass whooped only to just barely not get the extra regression.
---
People have been asking for map reworks for a long time.
---
Thanks
---
Ok but does that really change the fact you can just look at him for a single second and destroy his ability?
---
It now seems like it'll be more useful
---
Ghostface is jsut bugged anyway. 
---
[https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a](https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a)
---
Hes just bugged!   
---
Bug...
---
Like you cant move without them cancelling your power my main huge deal is you can cancel his power through walls and you get a notif if you‚Äôre being stalked
---
A killer, survivor, and map every 3 months was already an absurd amount of content. I think we can survive a few extra months without a new map.
---
Why not change MoM to a healing yourself three times perk? This seems kinda dumb..
---
It's one free hit for the killer and then you can adjust your play, I don't see what the big deal is. Sometimes they don't even get the hit if the map is in your favour.
---
I'm a bit sad that we can't look at our character's face anymore by facing a wall and moving the camera to look behind them :c
---
Didn't they say Springwood would be getting 4 new maps? I could be wrong though
---
Points 1-3 aren‚Äôt intended, his ability is bugged, it‚Äôs only supposed to break if the survivor is directly facing them, so looking behind with the camera and breaking it through walls will hopefully be resolved by full release.
---
Not sure about the perk counters though.
---
Hes just bugged! His power is not working as its supposed to!   
---
It's not a big deal. It's why I suck as killer and play as the P3 Claudette. I still play the game way too much and still get way too pissed.
---
They mentioned it will be in mid chapter patch along Freddy in the stream before the anniversary stream. Might need to double verify but im lazy.
---
Yes. It is a rather big deal since Ghostface is meant to hide behind walls to get up to someone then stalk them.
---
I downloaded the game when it was put up on Game Pass, too, and I looooove it. Killer wait times (in my experience) are significantly longer to find a trial, but I'd say I wait an average of 3 minutes for Killer. **Max** of 5 minutes. As a Survivor, it's almost an immediate match.
---
I'd say it's 100% worth it.
---
Or just make it that your stalking can only be interrupted by your stalkee, and only if they have their camera fixed on you for "x" seconds.
---
Do you have to get p3 to get consistently good addons? Like, I get a purple one here and there but it's nowhere near every game, but I've never been above p1, I'm relatively new, 120 hours, so idk if it gets better. How do people afford to play a purple add on every game, like is that possible? Assuming you do well most of the games
---
If you cant find an immersed teammate, esp without whispers...sometimes it wastes less time going back to the unhook area and chasing the two survivors there.
---
I know! It's obvious now, but the first few times I saw it I thought Ghostface was the only CG thing in the video
---
If you have a good game where not many people are hooked, it‚Äôs useless. It needs a buff.
---
Hes jsut bugged!   
---
Oh boy, more firecrackers to be added to my collection of 200+ winter party starters.
---
His power is like a Trapper without traps
---
Honestly, so far...there is nothing I want to go live from the PTB. Not even Ghost Face in this state.  
---
Most disappointing PTB since the introduction of PTBs for me personally.   
---
Things I definitely don't want to hit live:
---
\- the weird red light on pallet stuns
---
\- Ghost Face before he gets some love, that ability is useless, he can be spotted by anyone across the map, sounds like a flag waving and what not. Very disappointing. 
---
\-  all those weird sound bugs
---
\- the MoM change as it now PROMOTES instant-saves and tunneling (It triggers off of protection and safe unhooks. Instant unhook = 2 possible protection stacks to get next to the unhook; killers will just tunnel the other person to stop you from gaining the stack after they know you got it...)
---
Edit: I found 1 single thing that I like which is the change to Enduring. That's cool and a lot less confusing that the whole Stun Recovery calculation you had to perform if you wanted to know how good the effect is.
---
I hate the games where the killer shuts hatch then slugs you and waits for endgame timer to run out, just let me die
---
*cries in Legion*
---
Mettle of Man isn't gone, it just went from a brain dead perk to one that only goes into certain builds.
---
Borrowed Time and Mettle of Man is going to be disgusting. It's just going to be a much more fair version of Disgusting. The true thing that's being made gone is the stupid MoM+DS+DH+Adrenaline build. That's going by-by.
---
Good
---
Worth trying out.  You won‚Äôt feel left behind, they are constantly adding new content every 3 months.  You will also be facing a lot of other game pass players at first so perk-wise you would be on a level playing field with most of them.  Yes it‚Äôs 3 years old, but they plan to keep it going well into the future with content and updates, the devs are very committed to the future of the game
---
I think you should still have time to make it to the next loop if you factor in the time to breaks the pallet, but it will be harder to break LOS for sure.
---
I think it mostly helps killers ensure that survivors can‚Äôt get away when enduring/spirit fury are used in combination.
---
No. Your supposed to directly LOOK at him with your character. Not camara resting it.
---
Instead of aisle 9 I would replace it with something like "Restock" where the survivor can pick up a pallet that has been dropped but not destroyed.
---
This is a bug
---
The map will have 4 entirely different shapes and layouts but all the same structures and such. It‚Äôs still technically the same map? But yeah it‚Äôs pretty much 4 separate ones.
---
Plays like these are the reason why I never take borrowed time off.
---
It‚Äôs ptb what‚Äôd you expect?
---
Cant even find a match as ghostface lmao
---
Yeah
---
None of that was said in the post though. You are just saying "problems". Sorry I can't read minds.
---
Don't expect me to just know exactly what you're talking about when what you are saying is pretty ambiguous in meaning.
---
a game where not a lot of people are hooked is a bad game to me. So boring
---
Have you ever been rank 1? You can still get more pips after getting rank 1. So no, you dont suddenly go into rank 2 after dying at rank 1.
---
I'm surprised people didn't realize this sooner. Big pros in this community like Ardetha was saying he would be better then Myers. Myers can make EVERYONE exposed and the survivors can't cancel him by looking in his general direction. No way this killer is gonna be good on anything other then really dark Macmillan maps and possibly Lery's
---
How can YOU be so greedy of only getting 2 maps and thinking they cheating out when their planner table is giving us other great content like the archives and the in-game friend list (so we stick with our friends and don‚Äôt have to keep inviting them back after every match). You don‚Äôt understand dev time at all. yes there are multiple teams but even then they have to pace themself and do a few things at once so they don‚Äôt get overwhelmed and can make sure one implementation works before adding the next. We are getting game quality improvement (fixing bugs and issues for example). Balancing of perks and characters (a given obvious necessity). Maps aren‚Äôt everything. Very fun and of course great for new maps, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the big picture is they are able to update the game with more stuff to explore and do. Go make your own game with 34 maps then and counting and such if that‚Äôs what u expect. Maps will come, it‚Äôs not ‚Äú2 maps + 2 map reworks and then no more maps‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚Äúadding 2 maps and reworking 2 maps for now until more maps get revealed over time.
---
Its easy to pip if the game is full of interactions either by explicitly looking for the killer or when the killer is well, good. Pipping in a game where the killer is outclassed or has tunnelvision on 1 survivor its nearly impossible to pip for any and all survivors.
---
Not to mention running the killer around is basically the only indication of actual skill in this game. If you can run a killer around for an extended period of time imo you deserve to pip. Both for the survivor‚Äôs sake and the other killers in the same rank. Imagine being rank 10 and every match you run the killer around the map, you will not pip a single time. So you will keep going against killers of the same skill level (in theory cause they could be godtier just passing through to rank 1) and thus providing not so fun gameplay for either side. And maybe this will incentivize scared/stealth players to play more risky or atleast interact with the killer more knowing they are also getting ‚Äúgenpoints‚Äù at the same time. So personally im a big fan of these changes and I hope they stay.
---
Ghostface is bugged
---
Yeah but having a killer straight up not work is not at all "fun".
---
Not chapter 14. Just 13 and 15. 14's getting a rework.
---
Ok I get that but still takes 1 second for his whole ability to get shutdown. I'm happy he is getting fixed but still once survivors get better at spotting him it will still be as bad as before
---
His power is: cause everyone to play killer, thus making finding a game impossible
---
Never have this problem if you have great headphone. Survivors breathing noise, when when uninjured is too obvious. Blendette in particular is such a give-away.
---
also happy cank day
---
Its bugged. They are supposed to have to look at him to make it work.   
---
instead of a free hit with the free broken pallet the killer would have to kick the pallet which can allow the survivor to win the chase.
---
It's a huge difference.
---
Devs: "We don't want survivors to fast vault certain spots if they're not approaching from the 'correct side'"
---
Players: "LuL we're gonna do it anyway."
---
Devs: "Oops, let's just fix that bit of sloppy code up. There, now you shouldn't be able fast vault those"
---
Players: "WTF BHVR?! How could you do this!?!"
---
Everyone please take the time to upvote this post to BHVR can make the right changes
---
Oh yeah me too tbh the DS rework kind of blew the point of the perk into the trash imo
---
I swear that looks like a killer.
---
This!
---
Exactly
---
Yeah. But considering that he‚Äôs bugged, even one second won‚Äôt be long enough. A survivor can glance in Ghostfaces direction for a second and not even realize it but it sounds like it will still be the same problem.
---
but now survivor cleaning dull totems will have it easier to rank up while not being able to run the killer maybe.
---
I'm also pretty sure that looking at him isnt supposed to disable his stalking either.
---
I think it should be 2 seconds and give you a notification that someone is looking at you, so you can maybe duck into cover and keep your power.
---
My original post is at 3 points. Your eyes not work or something?
---
Also your original post is literally - "You clearly DON'T KNOW why". Short term memory loss or just have your head that far up your own ass?
---
Well everybody else got the memo except you so maybe you‚Äôre due for some self evaluation
---
History shows that just cus it's PTB does not mean he will get better.

---
ha! love the outlook tho. i‚Äôm not great at killer either but it‚Äôs just fun to be my favorite characters whether i get a bunch of kills or not
---
They tweaked Plague, Legion, and Spirit right after the PTB though... Spirit later got additional tweaks in her mid chapter patch as well.
---
If it was balanced it didn‚Äôt need buffed.
---
There is a lmitd range and the same person confirmed that they will likely change the distance for it to trigger.
---
Not all killers do.
---
my issue right now is not ranking up while also farming bp. seem to always pip just playing.
---
I didn't know that this was a fecking subreddit
---
They'll have to be within 32m and looking fairly close to you. We're going to be keeping an eye out for this specifically (among other things) during the PTB. The goal is to make sure that it's forgiving enough that it'll work as long as you know they're there, but strict enough that it won't detect them if you don't know they're there.
---
Something like that, although we can control how big that "spotted" area is. We can always make adjustments if it doesn't feel right.
---
sorry I have different opinions?
---
That's a very nice idea tbh
---
So then what would happen if we got a non-reworked Freddy-Face?
---
If you play on PC, the top 5 I would recommend are Hag, Michael, Leatherface, Spirit, and Huntress. If you play on console swap Hag with Pig. But hey LF first. BBQ and chill is absolutely a must get perk

---
Too bad the survivors are looking in his direction
---
More like bore ragnarok
---
This has happened for a while. I even made a bug report on the forum.
---
PC MASTER RACE here, pal
---
I would‚Äôve said Pig &lt; Michael ‚â† Ghostface
---
Considering they changed the cellphone in his mori to a camera?
---
This will never fly. I'm assuming cell phones connected to Ghostface are tied up with the movie rights.
---
These issues should have been caught before they released the ptb.  Also why is it so hard lately for BHVR to release a chapter without major flaws or balance issues.  It‚Äôs like they have actual potatos testing the game.  Why should we as consumers be encouraged to pay for a shoddy product for them to just fix multiple times down the road.
---
Cries in leatherface and legion.
---
I found the survivor main
---
Worse than Freddy.
---
Love how this killer's been wanted from the developers for years and turns out he's dogshit.
---
The world would stop turning.
---
wasting points, unless you have every other killer already.
---
\*upset oink\*
---
Except spirit, she was bad and now she's A tier
---
It was still a fun idea to make, also I edited some stuff check them out if u want :D
---
Yeah sound was much better. Footsteps are still a little quieter than they used to be, but being able to actually hear pain sounds and gens through walls makes me actually excited to play again. Can't wait for this to go live (assuming they don't re-break it again in some random hotfix).
---
If it was a Scream DLC I would be excited for Ghostface. This just feels like an off-brand with similar packaging.  So Carl actually seems to have more honesty to him rather than Falseface.
---
That happened to me in one match, i just hooked the survivor and then injured the other guy that was farming him, then the nvidia alt+z shit opens and i can't close it, so they heal the other guy and then unhook the other one, i was like ._.
---
freddy is probably a good option with his rework coming soon, and spirit is very high tier also
---
Yeah after 3 buffs. Which weren't right after PTB/release
---
Security feels like a better bond for me. I thought if you are in the 48m range of the killer you see all survivors so thats why i think its too overpowered. But if it acts how you said for example bbq then itd be useless bc the chances you can actually benefit from are too rare
---
I'm honestly extremely sad at how Ghostface is in his current state.  It just doesn't give me any hope for the future.
---
isn‚Äôt every killer just hard countered by sprint burst...?
---
If the cell phone was the thing for his Mori I would wish to just send it to the other survivors and type "WASSSUPPP"
---
I love the music from the new movie
---
True, but it doesn't change the fact that she did get better, and the patches weren't that far apart either
---
It took a year and a half to rework freddy.
---
Just sayin'.
---
Dude. This is BHVR you are talking about. PTBs do not get much use in the "iron out kinks" are of their time. We are gonna have to wait till the next chapter for ghostface to be worth a damn (he says with cynical tones).
---
Oh geez man.
---
We need to make sure he's actually working as intended before we can start tweaking what he's intended to work as.
---
As ive been saying,. hes just bugged.
---
How many ghostfaces did you see that were able to use their power
---
What?? Nooooo! That was my favorite thing to do while on a gen.
---
The duration is a bug, they said one second on the stream when they were explaining the ability, it's the looking directly at him that's the bugged right now.
---
game auto sends a message to the survivor you mori'd with a screenshot of them being mori'd with that text
---
Do you just complain about everything?
---
They may not have been far apart, but they were up to 8 months after her release.
---
I‚Äôm probably older than you, so settle down. Secondly, I listed off each of the major flaws with Ghostface in a concise manner. If that bugs you so much, then ignore it.
---
He is bugged.
---
Can I buy this? I want to buy this. Like now.
---
Also - √ßarl
---
Your head turns to look behind you now :c
---
You only get to see your neck and the back of your head.
---
GHOSTFACE IS BUGGED
---
There's nothing toxic in that though. A Killer that gives you the Hatch is something you should consider as a lucky exception, not something you should expect.
---
DAMMIT EVERY TIME.
---
A lot of misinformation in this post. The range you can break ghostface out of shroud is limited, and you have to see him in the camera. In other words, you can't break it through walls. Definitely needs a lot of tweaks though that's for sure.
---
I‚Äôm assuming playing as Freddy-Face would be about running and hiding from Survivors trying to hook you
---
PepeLaugh
---
His power gets cancelled by downed or hooked survivors. That's either bugged or bad design and honestly does not take experience to see.
---
Having a power that only works in specific circumstances because that's how it's intended (like Plague): experience.
---
Having a power that is cancelled 90%+ of the time in any circumstance because of how the game is designed: bad or bugged
---
Could somebody link the rework to me, i must have missed it.
---
yeah you're right dude. They can't afford to *pour* what little breadcrumbs of money they have into something like having functioning sounds in a video game that's been out for 3 years. Those poor guys.
---
To my knowledge, it's still in the game.
---
This is pretty impressive.
---
Sam?
---
When you get higher ranks and you see bright colored outfits, bring a mori!  They're guaranteed to be running the adrenaline, mettle of man, decisive strike, dead hard/balanced landing combo.
---
until they make it so he acts like tier 1 myers while crouched (not activating detection perks) he won't raise above wraith. that post is also a shitpost
---
You don‚Äôt have to see him in the camera currently, which is the problem, though that‚Äôs apparently a bug. I played on KYF for hours this afternoon and while playing both Ghostface and survivor, I could cancel the power when I couldn‚Äôt see the killer and the killer couldn‚Äôt see me, just by spinning my camera around.
---
You will have more than 1 sec: 1sec stun by pallet + the time required to drop the survivor
---
The dev stream
---
The perk was pretty much pointless with the previous stun.  Enduring should not be able to completely negate the point of another perk.
---
They gotta replace that F tier man. Why else is Ghostface a freddy replacement
---
PTB - Public Test Build
---
You must be an expert. Everything you say is true.
---
Finally bought the game, starting totally fresh. 2 quick questions:
---
1) Which survivor to level first? I'm torn between Meg (adrenaline) and Claudette (Self Care/Botany). Can someone help push me one way or the other?
---
2) Watching YouTube vids, it feels like the survivors have some sort of free look cam movement; is this a thing, or are they just really good at using their movement keys while looking all around. For example; in World of Warcraft, I run forward pushing W, but can look anywhere and still, W makes me continue to go straight. Doing the tutorial, I couldn't seem to find a feel for this.
---
Thanks in advance,
---
TheSmokey
---
Anything that gets in my way of downing is OP :(
---
Thank you. That is why I made the post. In hopes they see it. Sure, I gave harsh criticism and didn't give any solutions but they won't listen to my solutions. They go by numbers and consensus which i sdumb. These are the same sucky players who screamed Freddy is overpowered and then give him a nerf when he already sucked.
---
Man I expect alot of people to fall for this bait
---
Im speaking the truth
---
Like they still allow for billy to be in his current state after all this time, so who knows.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or not. I hope it is.
---
As a survivor I have no chase music. It's funny but kinda deceptive. It makes me think more
---
One of these killers has a power that is very weak, completely negated by perks and mouse movement, and doesn't feel fun to use because of it. 
---
The other is Legion.
---
I totally wanna do this now. I can just screen cap with the share button (PS4) and then message it to the survivor after the match.
---
Has the DBD community always been this toxic or is it only on Reddit? Sheesh, I can‚Äôt imagine how any dev could appeal to this kind of fanbase
---
Yeah but ghostface is cooler for sure
---
Yeah except it's BHVR who almost never actually fixes bugs found in the PTB before the update's release.
---
The legion isn't worth the buy in the current state. I'm still a legion main but his power makes him m1 killer after first hit and it's kinda sad
---
I actually play more killer than survivor. I go back and forth though.
---
In the past 14 days you‚Äôve bitched about: German players, the design team, this stupid post, and the battle pass. 
---
None of this adds any value to the sub. Also it‚Äôs a pretty distorted view of the truth. Quit crying.
---
Shit "chapter"
---
Yea but pipping doesn't matter. Not to a lot of people at least. I care two shits if I pip or not since it's broken. I feel if I ran your ass or played well I am satisfied. There is no correlation between pipping and playing well. You can get gens done and a pull but if you avoid chases and hide from the killer you don't pip.
---
Wait is there a play testing thing out for ghostface?
---
1st and second one are really cool, third one is just wwekplj
---
What!!?? You missed the most important thing?! Wow... tough luck man... i think you can find the whole stream on their youtube channel or twitch channel... good luck!
---
You can tell when its supposed to be directly at you.
---
Yes PTB has ghostface currently.
---
Yes maybe one second is too low, but 360 isnt supposed to work.
---
You mean the eta for Richthofen to be added to the game?
---
Because bugs are hard to find?
---
I really like the work you put into this. All of the perks seem like ones you could actually find in the game. Check out works great with the addition of EGC, it‚Äôs powerful but the requirements to achieve it seem balanced. I also really like clean up as an anti tunnel perk that seems decent. Security seems interesting but overall not that useful. Overall great job
---
Ok but that has nothing to do with the guy thinking theres an 80% pip rate at rank 1
---
All of them are true tho
---
And if I dont voice my concerns how can devs tell what needs fixing?
---
Sorry, at work, what's the bug?

---
The devs aren‚Äôt going to listen to a whiny bitch who knows nothing about game design. Lmao.
---
Have a good day, boss.
---
i'm not bothered about the shared emblem points for when you're are getting chased. it's a cool concept to prevent people being tunneled to be killed with almost o points.
---
But still, you can still pip as survivor doing basic stuff like repairing a gen. They should lowered the emblem points you get from fixing gens and increased points if you manage to get great skill check.
---
'cause the difference between a good survivor and a basic survivor(for the lightbringer emblem) is the ability to constantly hit those great skill check. Which prevent killers to get easy game just thanks to ruin for exemple.
---
I think a lot of my survivor pips should have just been black pip.
---
This is pretty cool and funny.
---
Clean up, isle 9 is the most useful perk. Imagine it, MOM, D-strike, Clean up, isle 9,  and adrenaline. Best endgame build. Especially for campers
---
The true high tier play is running bond with pebble, so you can throw it at teammates and create a better distraction
---
And what did it cost?
---
\- Ghostface
---
If the last survivor doesn‚Äôt struggle, I‚Äôll look for the hatch with them. If they struggle, they are hooked.
---
Exceptions occasionally made for baby Dweets.
---
Next they'll nerf huntress into the ground to create the H tier, just you wait
---
I‚Äôm sorry friend, I was just playing off the idea that I am just that bad and that even the most ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and ‚Äúlow tier‚Äù killers still manage to have their way with me.
---
Very fund guy, thanks everyone who suggested him :D
---
For Myers i just think it would be cool if he can change tiers.   
---
Why the fuck would you nerf Wrath hes already one of the worst killers.   
---
Freddy is getting a rework.   
---
That Hag change is just really stupid.   
---
Nurse doesnt need nerfs other killers need buffs. 
---
Why in the abosutle fuck would you nerf the Trapper? 
---
Thats dumb too.
---
I'm All Ears seems like it could be very good in the right builds. If spirit can use it while in haunting mode she could see if a survivor who fast vaulted slow vaults back over or walks away. Doctor with calm addons can get to 0 terror radius with Furtive chase while in punishment mode. With I'm All Ears and Furtive Chase, any fast vault would give him xray eyes. Zero mind games. Wraith can use "The Ghost" soot addon to have no terror radius for 6 seconds after uncloaking, so I'm All Ears would give him xray eyes on any vault after uncloaking.
---
Sums it up perfectly lol
---
If Ghostface is this much of a shit show, I'm dreading the Freddy rework. QA seems to be either nonexistent or incompetent.
---
thanks to everyone who told me to get Legion, he's really fun, love chasing down people and watch them try to run away lol
---
Ah ok, that sucks. I enjoy using Jane but I don't bother with her perks often
---
Hey uh, real quick just remind me what a PTB is?
---
Thanks! Definitely went for a comedic and fun orientated style haha
---
Even when it did actually blind the killer, did anyone actually ever get blinded by one of these?
---
OH DO YA?
---
Consider this  
---
The Scream  
---
The mask was literally based on the painting
---
What are the new ghost perks?
---
Plz tell me one time devs ever listened to feedback from a ptb
---
There‚Äôs already a perk for that, detectives hunch
---
Dummy, don‚Äôt you know hooked survivors have a 30 meter safe zone? Once you hook a survivor you are REQUIRED to immediately run away from the hook until you are at least 30 meters away, you can stop for nothing, then once you are gone you must wait until they unhooked to go back, even if you see a survivor in that zone you are not allowed to pursue. If I see I doing otherwise I‚Äôm gonna report you for cheating because I make the rules
---
honestly i feel like they should do a test where survivors play in first person, or even have a fixed camera, i would be curious how much harder it is to play survivor like that
---
‚ÄúThe Grind‚Äù is one of the most underrated parts of the Halloween score. Probably because there‚Äôs so much greatness in it.
---
When a survivor‚Äôs camera 360‚Äôs, his power instantly deactivates. It is not supposed to do that, it is a bug.
---
Exactly! If they had made it one word or had added a dash I wouldn't have cared but otherwise, I'm pretty mildly infuriated.
---
Making 360's with the camera, since just pointing the camera at him for a split second currently counts as looking at him, and it currently works through wall. Supposedly, both of those are bugs.
---
Particularly bc it used to just be the ghost.  No face
---
I'd like to have a power that I can use. The plague can have her power turned off by survivors, but at least they're always injured if that happens.
---
True that
---
I think it's more a hypothetical. Like, if he was getting a map, what would it be?
---
Is it bad that I find both ladies in the picture attractive?
---
Not that I know of, but this was posted earlier:  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/vNq06eD](https://imgur.com/a/vNq06eD)
---
It doesn't slow down killer movement speed at all while walking. Only while climbing through windows or destroying pallets, and only pallets nad windows used by the hooked guy. you could very easily target the person doing the unhooking and still be just as efficient on time. 
---
check out is high risk high reward. If you want to play SWF and want to make sure you can get your hooked friend after the gate is opened, that'd be a lot better than adrenaline or any other end game perk. but it does have its risk, like deliverance for example.
---
Right?? Probably not true, but I like conspiracies :P
---
Because they're not good designers. We love this game with all of its flaws, but the core design is awful. For survivors especially. You sit half the match on a generator, hitting skill checks. Then hang on a hook for minutes. Then spend 30 seconds healing. Even clensing a fucking totem has you doing nothing for 10 or so seconds. And sometimes (often) you get the honor and pleasure of crawling on the floor for 4 minutes as you bleed out. This is core gameplay that someone came up with at that company, and then a bunch of people had to approve it and said "yeah, wow, sounds great, it's gonna be amazing" somehow. So when they release new content, which is again badly designed, I don't understand how anyone is surprised. It's BHVR, what did you expect?
---
His stealth can be broken by looking at him, but it‚Äôs only supposed to work when the survivor is facing him, currently it can be broken with the 360 degree third person camera.
---
Or just shortened it to the Ghost would've been better but I mean if you are gonna go with the GhostFace at least not space it.
---
It should be one word, imo.
---
Prob. a survivor main that is happy freddy v.2 is going to be added
---
Agreed.
---
When is next patch?
---
Weird this isn't even a lagswitch...
---
The Ash knew where you actually were. If it was he'd be super confused as well ü§î
---
lmao that explains it. I've never used any Tapp perks lol
---
You can currently cancel his power by just pointing the camera at him for a split second, which means you can keep him from stalking by just spinning your camera around and not even need to realize he's here. And that works through walls. Both of those are not supposed to happen.
---
And then the nurse blinked once and he died. The end
---
Only via add-ons, though. His default is M1.
---
I feel like the stalk time for ghost face should be decreased a lot, it's currently barely faster than myers
---
It's just a snapshot of your save on the 30th. When you switch back to live you will have ALL your progress back and any items that you used in the ptb. In other words, you can burn all your offerings and use every item you have and it will still be on your live game. (Great time to practice flashlight saves)
---
Poised is not a meme. Its one of the only good stealth perks in the game. Dance with me is a meme.
---
ok this makes way more sense than whatever the hell the other typed with his face
---
Yeah i get and agree with the points made for the record. It's just this sub has such a hard on for losing their shit over things that are either being tested or were datamined. You're entire post was written like this is a live killer release and you're mad at the state of it....
---
I sometimes would, or sometimes it would be dropped behind me and I‚Äôd get blinded, or it would randomly work/not work. :/
---
I love Feng's new long hair
---
It's not toxic but your suggestions for killers nerfs who are mid low tier is a disgrace.
---
Screams survivor main who has played 2 hours and thinks every killer is op...
---
Seriously. How many nerf posts do you see for wraith, Myers and hag?
---
None.
---
Kinda a reason for that
---
To be fair, plague becomes an m1 killer like infinite t3 Myers (i.e one hit and they're down). No use for the m2 but the power still matters
---
Even if he was working as intended, he'd suck ass.
---
bruh, I do coding for a living. I still have no idea how something such big could go through
---
Ghostfaces power. For one, 360 spinning isnt supposed to cancel his power. Two, I'm pretty sure hooked, downed survivors arent supposed to cancel it either. Also with a werid things if it being stopped though walls. 
---
This isnt cofirmed either, but im pretty sure the sound cues for it is also bugged.
---
Not a fan of just adding more visual noise. I already hate playing Legion, a killer I used to love, now that I spend all game looking at my hands.
---
I thought so too at first, but the red caption makes me think OP didn't just mean it as a "What if ?"
---
Spinning the camara
---
üëçüèΩ
---
Guess who‚Äôs about to become the new Freddy
---
It‚Äôs not misleading if it explains how they collect the data.
---
No. More people should play it. More testers, more opinions added, more data collected. That's what BHVR needs to fix Ghost face.
---
lol if he's over 18 and unironically used "full offense"
---
If you did do coding for a living then you know that doing one simple change cna break 50 other things, including fixing it, then relasing it.
---
Think of the PTB as an alternate timeline starting from May 30th. You have the BP, shards, and bloodweb you had on May 30th in the PTB. Anything you spend, use, or gain in the PTB does not affect the live version and vice versa.
---
What makes you so sure? We dont know what is a bug and what isnt a bug anymore, since im pretty sure most of it is bugged
---
I honestly don‚Äôt have an answer that is suitable for your question. Take my upvote anyway for making me depressed üòû
---
Looks like GF main power is more to be able to get rid of his red stain and surprised a survivor in a jungle gym and being able to crouch to mindgame a strong loop.
---
The stalk feature is more like something you might have the chance to use in some niche situations
---
The other dude probably just assumed you already knew about the current problems with Ghostface and just didn't know they were bugs.
---
The basement is supposed to be dangerous. It's the killer's domain. They already can't block the stairs anymore. If it were any easier to get out of there would be no point in putting anyone there.
---
Thank you! üòÑ

They did fine with Pig, and Myers tho which confuses the shit out of me

Cross map, I believe just hide and yeet that shit when they're about to find you

You just seem to have a very negative opinion and are thinking the worst of them. I don't know if you do or not but I certainly don't know how the game works to know how easy the sounds are to fix. As for posts just look at other posts many have managed to put across viewpoints of issues with the PTB without insulting the devs and have explained themselves coherently so if a dev read it they could understand what is wrong.

This game isn't perfect but we all know this its been this way for years as its a pet project. They are improving it year by year but if you hate it this much then just play something else. It is clearly a game you have to see the positives in to properly enjoy as again for years it has had issues and bugs.
---
Sometimes they do fix killers though, spirit released better than her initial entry in the PTB.
---
Turning your survivor mid chase and completely negating his power isnt hard.
---
All I see is Claudette revealing her true nature as a killer. She has the red stain and everything.
---
They still did it though. Which is the point of a PTB.
---
Not giving someone the hatch is fine. It's when they let you on the ground to die at the endgame timer. It was fine the first week but now it gets annoying lol. Just kill me!
---
Right. People said he was gonna be the mix between Mikey and Pig, but honestly, Amanda with no bear traps is better than this atrocity in his current state.
---
To be fair, his core concept is just shit.
---
Dang, I wish they‚Äôd address it. :/
---
Also was pointed out a survivor can follow you around like they do Trapper and just make it impossible to ever activate it...
---
I actually like his perks tbh. They‚Äôre not great obviously but im sure people will find use for them. There‚Äôs been killers with perks that are a lot worse
---
Dude you're unironically suggesting a Wraith and Trapper nerf. You can't blame the community for this one.
---
Its misleading if you use that 80% survival figure as proof that survivors are way too OP without the context of how the majority of rank 1 deaths dont even count into that statistic.
---
What about after being unhooked fake scratch marl trails are left going in several random directions as well as the real one, making it ‚Äúmessy‚Äù ya know?
---
Kinda, we‚Äôve all got kinks so don‚Äôt worry about it
---
People thought Freddy was bad! But oh boy, what a surprise bhvr gived us
---
Gave me a chuckle.
---
As an avid dbd and doctor who fan, this is the best thing i have ever seen on this subreddit. Thank you so so much
---
Thank you! I've been trying to speard this around EVERYWHERE thats hes bugged, both so the devs can fix it and so people stop over reacting, wait, and then see how he is after he is bug fixed. 
---
For all we know, he could be god tier when the power works as its meant to. 
---
And from my understanding, his power is meant to only go away once he is looked at directly withten a small range, and not with a camara spin. 
---
Hes meant to sneak up to use the leaning and crouching to stalk, then run in and stab them before they can react. 
---
Once it gets to that point, they can work on balacning, the range of the dection, stalk timers, CD, timer to look at him.
---
The point is that spinning your camera shouldn't cancel a killer's power. Imagine if spinning your camera could stop a nurse mid blink, stop Myers from stalking you, or make Billy turn off his chainsaw. It was supposed to be your character physically looking at him. Like facing him. But their spaghetti code fucked up again.
---
Every map since Haddonfield
---
Ok, turning around isn't that hard.
---
There was a PTB for Freddy if I‚Äôm not mistaken. And here we are,  a year and a half later and just now getting a rework. Let‚Äôs act like they‚Äôre gonna do anything because that‚Äôs just how BHVR works. :)
---
He‚Äôs out only on the PTB.
---
What skin is this?
---
that's a kinda neat idea too
---
great thx for the feedback i already knew
---
It would then force you to have to get off a Gen or any other action. And in a chase, fully turning around means your going to run towards him.
---
And there was a PTB for clown, and spirit, which both got buffs. 
---
It‚Äôs genuinely amazing how people cry over a changing concept.
---
It would be better if they had to look at you with there character, or they have to look at you for a curtain amount of time.
---
Id be happy with that. Her only current counter is iron will, she needs more counters for how effective (op I'm) she is
---
There is no other thing we can do besides that and show the devs how we hate what they have done.
---
I see. Well if that's their intent then they'll fix it. Seems unfair to me to have people have to stop doing a generator or something just to face the killer.
---
Preach! No one asked for the Dollar Store discount version of Ghostface.
---
Also, the Ghostface and Sidney arch is iconically 90s. So them not securing the film rights to get the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Ghostface along with Sidney Prescott reinforces the cheap, discount feelings. 
---
Releasing only Freddy or Leatherface or the Pig without a survivor is understandable cuz their victims weren‚Äôt consistent a la Laurie and Sidney.  I‚Äôd rather original IPs than Dollar Store licensed killers.  üíØ
---
The point of the ptb is for the player base to get into a poorly informed frenzy. Don't take this away from them.
---
you have posted this on r/leaksbydaylight ?
---
Thank ya, glad to hear that some of what seems to be so weak about him is unintentional
---
Wassup with billy what am I missing
---
Ah thanks
---
but it's so basic thing... you check exactly those things after every change
---
He gets the same ppl as ANY of us that are in red ranks so it's bullshit.
---
That and it gives you the opportunity to use pebble, or cause a disturbance in a different direction. Or, with your own aura reading perks, it helps you coordinate your movement.
---
Yeah. I think once it is fixed, Stalking ppl will be easy. I think the difficult thing will be getting someone quick enough before the exposed state expires. 
---
Either way, ppl gotta chill, stop asking for all these changes until we get to test him without the bugs. Can‚Äôt fully assess someone if it isn‚Äôt working properly
---
In a chase? Like, as a distraction or for the person who somehow manages to cleanse while being chased?
---
Get ride of noed because it debilitates your ability to learn and get unnerving presence instead
---
I think the saddest thing about this game is tha if looping wasn't in it's current state and as strong as it is, you could nerf all the top tier killers and all the fun, lower tier killers would be fun and viable. But due to how the game works, how fast gens get done, how looping is, well, a killer like Ghostface is so bad it's hilarious.
---
Its stupid when its bugged and not even working as its supposed to do though? Why judge something broken. Wait until they at least fix his bugs, then we can judge alot better.
---
I love this!
---
Would love an abandoned supermarket.
---
Some more than others, while their isn‚Äôt a killer who necessarily does well against sprint burst, pig for example is countered very easily by a sprint burst when ambush is triggered.
---
Walking backwards? And getting off a gen for 1 sec is fine because you will be in a chase anyway.
---
A year and a half to rework Freddy.  I wouldn't expect them to do anything drastic so quickly and within a few weeks of release.
---
That is only from a lore standpoint. From a gameplay standpoint basement used to be balanced because hooks didn't regenerate and weren't viable, chases lasted much longer, wiggling was more reliable, etc.
---
Nowadays, hooks are perfectly viable, chases are much, much shorter without knowing where every pallet is or being incredibly good at looping, and wiggling being much less reliable even with the killer is not running Agitation, Iron Grasp, or Mad Grit.
---
The basement right now is just a free hit one or even two survivors without having to initiate a chase, especially for high-mobility killers.
---
Clown still sucks, and Spirit is blatantly overpowered. It‚Äôs genuinely amazing how much you‚Äôre bent over for the devs.
---
Billy has always been and still is completely balanced. He is what the bar should be set to in terms of killer power level. He has great map control and insta-down with fair conditions and a very high skill-level. Can still be looped for days if the survivors in question play correctly, even more so if the billy is a real m2 gamer and the survivors exploit that fact. He is strong but not broke.
---
You can use whatever perks you want! But a lot of people say, and I agree, NOED will never help you become a better player. I don‚Äôt say this because noed = downvotes. No, I cleanse totems. 
---
But you‚Äôll never improve if you rely on one hit downs end game. You want to try to not get to end game as much as possible. 
---
I suggest trying to get something that will prevent gens popping left and right. Ruin, pop goes the weasel, huntress lullaby etc etc. Unnerving Presence is great if you enjoy overcharge.
---
Ahhh
---
We thought Nea was the real killer, but it was Claudette all along.
---
Oh wow i didn't realise it was on the Year 3 stream lmao.  I thought it was a separate stream.  My b!
---
You walk backwards into a wall then.
---
Exactly what I said before I saw your comment lol.
---
Finally. I'd rather have it at 300 seconds, but we gotta take what we get.
---
Yeah, just waiting until you hit the wall and then blinking 2 feet back to do the fast animation was clearly unintentional.
---
Not when it comes out.
---
Thats what im trying to explain and why ive been spamming hes bugged
---
&gt;Plague was a great addition to the game 
---
Lmao no, and Legion is still bad.
---
I said they made changes on the PTB. You disagreed. I proved you wrong and you said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre bent over for the devs‚Äù. 
---
Incredible. Have a good day.
---
You see that analogy might have worked if Freddy was EVER strong problem is Freddy was only ever mid tier at best and that was before they kicked him 10 feet under.
---
Of course. There is a reason ive been spamming the fact hes bugged over this entire subreddit. This needs to be known.
---
This is way too accurate.
---
Not if you arent brain dead. You just *look* beforehand.
---
Personally I think self care is a waste of time and at some point most higher rank players end up just not healing themselves altogether and just doing gens, so id say Meg personally. Plus you can always just bring in a medkit and usually find one in most cases.
---
Theres no free look, you just have to get good at moving your character and the camera at the same time
---
Tfw you stalkin and A David King a hundred thousand miles away in Saint John Canada eatin a donut drops the donut and When he looks back up when he picks up the donut you get ripped out of night shroud
---
But the dev said ‚Äústare‚Äù which I assume means you can‚Äôt be moving/running in the chase
---
thats pretty stupid and unfun, its old ds but for killer
---
I like this, a lot different to anything we have now and still gives the killer somewhat of a chance.
---
Distressing and Overcharge without Unnerving Presence barely have any effect against veteran survivors. They will become less and less useful as you rank up. 
---
NOED is an ok perk. The more you learn about the game, the less you will use it as preventing generators from being done is the main goal of killers. By using NOED you are playing with just 3 perks which increases the likelihood of losing the game. 
---
Nurse's Calling is alright. It used to be better back in the day where you could also see the auras of survivors Snapping Out of It.
---
I especially since pallet stuns are free on any killer who isn't slamming the s key anytime they get close to a pallet.
---
Why would you not be able to. You can move and stare at something.
---
Why would someone down vote you?
---
This was a helpful answer.   Maybe it was one of those odd salty messages lol.
---
Hey do you still have any of these available?
---
Thanks, I'm going to give killer a shot and pick one purely on aesthetics.
---
They‚Äôre just examples, it can be other things too
---
Np man, you shold not be nervous about asking, if you need help, ask its nothing to be ashamed of
---
Also nerfed one of his biggest strength's down the road, "accidentally" and kinda just swept it under the rug. Before if you walked into his gas and attempted to vault a vault point it was ALWAYS a slow vault. Now you can fucking fast vault straight through his gas because fuck bhvr and forethought ammirite?
---
"Just accept that it has bugs loool"
---
Yeah nah. I'll shit on incompetent game devs all day long. This shit isn't and shouldn't be considered acceptable.
---
Actually many people agree that Myers is strong, You ignore Freddy who was included because he‚Äôs being reworked?? Can‚Äôt point that out huh?
---
And the reason would be people like you making a game that‚Äôs meant to be a ‚Äúfun experience‚Äù into some hyper competitive cesspool, These days everyone wants a ranked mode in every single game, no matter how casual it actually is
---
The basement should be a dangerous place though - if you don't want to risk getting injured down there, then stay away. Every time I venture/end up down there, I know that I'm risking not coming back out. If the killer wants to use his/her slots for a basement build and hangs out near the basement, then I'm just going to do gens elsewhere. On most maps, the range where the killer can take someone to the basement usually isn't that big.
---
The game is very much active on Xbox. The only time I‚Äôll remember playing with the same person is if it‚Äôs late at night but other than that you find games almost instantly and most likely be with different people. Especially with the game coming to game pass there will be a lot of new players who will stick to the game
---
Yes! I don't know if this is related or not but does anyone else's "sleep effect" on a Survivor with MoM when they get hit bugs and makes them look awake?
---
Wtf's wrong with it literally just being "The Ghost"?
---
I suggest changing overcharge for sloppy butcher, because it takes a lot more to heal and during that time they are not rushing gens.
---
I'd replace Nurse's with BBQ. Also, you likely won't always get a pink add-on so you could swap it out with something else (unless you're playing KYF)
---
I already suspected he was going to be a low tier Killer if stealth was his main strength purely on the fact that ain't nobody got time for that. This just confirms it.
---
Yeah, now he cant even post it.
---
Fair enough. I'm glad they got around to changing his kit. The problem with Freddy was that losing to him was like losing a game of monopoly, slow and agonizing. I think the new kit will be more fun to play, and more fun to play against.
---
I would put on sloppy instead of probably distressing I know distressing is good with the doctor but nurses and distressing sont really work toghter but sloppy butcher works well with nurses because the survivors will be healing for longer
---
Yeah I don't like the effect either.
---
I'm guessing they did this so Ghostface can see when someone is looking at him.
---
Or you could replace overcharge for sloppy
---
Does it affect killers as well? Regardless, I'd like it if they changed the green ones to affect the killer. Gotta spread the love.
---
Don't play a stealth killer if you aren't going to bother being good at stealth then
---
Yeah, how bout the pig?
---
This doesn‚Äôt seem like a discussion more like a salty post
---
I think the downvotes are because it's stonetoss...
---
Its the eyes
---
I actually did forget the wraith buff and only added a nerf, You and other stupid people (Can‚Äôt blame a typo for this one), Are taking the Trapper buff as a nerf, He starts with 1 trap and has to pick up others from the ground. With the buff he would start with 3 Traps but those 3 would have a much longer respawn time due to their versatility. What‚Äôs wrong with that?
---
Ghost face has that covered already.
---
Because you have to be facing the killer, not camera, character body facing the killer / head. You wouldn‚Äôt want to run towards the killer (even if it disables his power. You are getting closer for him to still slash). I think the point is to stare at him at he is crouched behind a wall staring back at u
---
Are those emblem changes a joke? Survivors get a ranking buff and the completely broken killer ranking isn't even mentioned? Are you fucking high?
---
Ironically the one thing consistently agreed upon by the community is how hilariously bad the emblem system is, and for me the emblem system update is the only thing that reflects they understand their game in the 3.0.0 Chapter. 
---
Ghostface *will* get better. There is absolutely no way they put such an awful killer into the live game with the state he is in now. This isn't the core problem, it never should've gotten to this point. Their internal testing team has to have known this killer was going to not feel fun to play, and how poorly he would perform. 
---
I've been playing since slightly after Spirit's release and I've never been more disinterested in the game. Hell, the Mettle changes reflect that they don't fully understand the issues with the perk, and serves as either a slight nerf to Cannibal/Billy/Myers or a direct nerf.
---
Please, show me my sanity is in check. Evading the killer, and hunting survivors are the most fun part about the game. Not holding M1 in front of a generator, not hunting totems, not running across the map to a generator. But what are you supposed to do if you're not in a chase? Follow the killer around and watch the chase? While that's trolly and kinda funny, it doesn't accelerate the game state at all.
---
Immersion really isn't my cup of tea, and playing versus immersive survivors is slightly annoying as well, but it's way more fun than making generators the only neutral objective. The changes they implement patch after patch seem to not reflect this, further specifying the need to focus on generators. Hell, four killers in a row got generator related perks. Mettle is actually a great addition of extending the fun part about the game, but when one hit against a better team is so damning that you lose the game, it really takes a lot of fun out of it. 
---
It's not an issue with how killers play, it's not an issue with how survivors play, it's an issue with the game itself. The game is focused on a killer chasing a singular survivor while the other three are given something to do so that they're not bored. I don't see a way of fixing this, and now it's just an off-topic salt filled rant.
---
3.0.0 is a major no for me, Ghostface is very lame in his current state (I am sure this will get better), and I'll still end up playing the game because there truly is nothing like it.
---
Move backwards.
---
I suggest you hide, becasue in about 10minutes I am going to you and I will oink the shit out of you.
---
Thanks!  I look forward to running into palates, not killing anyone and being the worst killer on xbone lol.
---
That isn't KYF. There are more than 2 pages of killer perks in KYF
---
Distressing has no purpose, id get rid of it. 
---
Overcharge is not that good, even on doc.
---
NOED is kinda cheap but on doc its not that bad a perk
---
Nurses is okay, but on doc its not a great perk. Especially if you have distressing
---
Ayeeeee, I freaking love Mystery Men, great film.
---
Year 4 just started, dude. It's not like they're going to fix every last little issue on the first week. Low-effort complaint post
---
It was kinda obvious that he wouldn't be that good 
---
Knocking him out of his power just by looking in his direction is a bit too much ... 
---
But who knows , maybe people actually find a way to play better with him
---
Replace Noed and u should be good. If you like overcharge, run it alongside unnerving presence.
---
Fuck yeah, lanterns are overdue in this sp00py game
---
Just ignore salty haters
---
If this particular issue isn't fixed by release, then OoO will become meta until Ghost fades from popularity.
---
Aren't they red add ons?
---
Yep hate em there are some who just say gg and theres the entitled survivors
---
üôÑ
---
or point at him
---
Overcharge slows down the gen progress a ton though, i was under the impression that overcharge was a high tier perk
---
Situations like this make me want to throw my chair into my monitor.
---
I straight up sold my PS4 OG with 2 controllers, just to buy the slim version so my console would shut the hell up at the title or whenever I played Clown.
---
It worked. Give it a try if you dont wanna invest in a pro.
---
Don‚Äôt worry haha! Everyone started there. All I say is, be persistent and keep trying if you fail at something. I‚Äôve had many friends not give the game a chance and refuse to go back again because they weren‚Äôt good their first couple of games. If you practice and get good at the game the game becomes 1000 times more enjoyable and you‚Äôll see why so many people have 1000 upon 1000 of hours played
---
Your both acting like children, your opinion is of no more value than his and vise versa. Regardless @PCPHOUNDsystem you have to look at this issue objectively. What BHVR is doing is objectively lazy, short sighted and irritating to the consumer. They have a long history of releasing broken shit and refusing to fix it for months, sometimes years ala Freddy.
---
You also need to understand how reddit works, if you don't make a post in such a way that it garners sufficient popularity and attention it will simply die off. Using the WELL EARNED distrust and anger most of this games community BHVR has garnered is the only way to actually get them to make a big enough impact as for anything to change.
---
You can try to say a well articulated, well thought-out respectful post does a better job at fixing issues in general but that isn't how THIS subreddit works. The fact that consumers have to go as far as this in the first place to fix a defective product that they are PAYING money for mind you is beyond inexcusable.
---
Sadly true :(
---
Lmao
---
Just play how you want.
---
Yeah, as a nurse it throws me off because I cannot hear a single thing. I have to play with higher volume or I can‚Äôt hear anyone, but if I do that I have the chase music blasting my ears out.
---
Have they said what the PTB access code will be by chance?
---
That bloody hair is dark...
---
Swap what for sloppy? Noed?
---
yeah i do ill dm you it
---
the leopard print shirt and short shorts.
---
Again, I don‚Äôt think they want it activated while the survivor moves. Staring usually means you aren‚Äôt moving.
---
The funniest thing is they released Legion in response to players' outcry for Ghostface, and said players *still* demanded they made Ghostface part of the game.  
---
They already made Ghostface part of the game, with a power befitting Ghostface, being all about that slashing, only it was in the form of Legion, an unlicensed killer with whom they could go ham on those cosmetics, and there's no denying that Legion's cosmetics are among the coolest in the game. You can say what you want about Legion in terms of gameplay, but they are top tier when it comes to how they look.  
---
So, because Legion exists, the devs couldn't just make Ghostface the new Legion. So instead, they had to make this neutered, weird, lackluster crossbreed between Myers and Amanda, all because the fanbase wasn't satisfied with Legion, the best solution to adding a licensed killer without having to actually add a licensed killer and go through all the contract shit.  
---
**TL;DR:**  
---
I blame the playerbase for this fiasco that Ghostface is turning out to be. We should have settled with Legion, like the devs did.
---
Wait are they changing MoM to be after an unhook like deliverance?
---
i did
---
/r/antifastonetoss
---
Will Ruin get cleansed within the first 20 seconds?
---
Big yikes lmao
---
I'm a P 3 Claudette :/ but I promise im not like the rest
---
Out of interest are you a game designer? If not I think your comparing them harshly to other huge companies, take fortnite I believe there dev team for that game is around the same as the entire workforce that work for Behaviour. 
---
Like I keep reiterating neither of us know how this game is made, how easy it is to add and fix things in the game or the financial structure of the company to know how much of the resource is put towards DBD. You might mock my attitude but I choose to look positive. I remember being a kid wishing I could play a game that had Freddy in it and now not only do I have that but I can play as him. I appreciate what they have given us, that doesn't mean the bugs or issues don't irritate me but I accept this isn't a multi million dollar company like EA so it isn't going to be perfect. 
---
They have chosen to go the route of adding more content in a world were entitled people demand more after only a few weeks of playing. If they went the other way and just fixed all the issues before adding stuff their would be people going mental that they weren't getting maps or killers. At least they are also looking to fix these things alongside still bringing content and again its a PTB that has not even been out 24 hours maybe just give them a break.
---
how is looping boring?
---
Additionally* I have 30 Hours in this game, Horrible guess shitposter, And It doesn‚Äôt take 30 Hours to see the flaws in a game idiot, It takes 30+ to get used to them.
---
Yea, good luck programming it in.
---
lol that was a terrible juke that killer has autismo.. all he had to do was hit you then chainsaw when you ran in a straight line
---
Leatherface yes, Freddy......Nancy and Alice would have a word with you.
---
He also said he's a new player. How's a new player have so many perks for Doc already?
---
Also, the whole KYF thing was a comment directed at having the Iridescent Glass as part of his build.
---
It's supposed to be like Small Game then? Your character has to physically turn towards him to spot him.
---
These are really neat. Not sure about checkout just because of Endgame / collapse
---
Well I enjoy him, I don‚Äôt necessarily care if he‚Äôs good or bad. I‚Äôm just glad there‚Äôs another enjoyable killer to play as
---
No it doesnt?
---
I thought it was The Hag at first lol.
---
Found the survivor main.
---
or we could settle with a killer that isnt terrible, nothing about legion existing necessitates that ghostface's ability be garbage
---
I'm aware. But if you look at the perk List it says page 1/2 and starts with Nurses calling. 
---
For starters, Nurses calling isn't the first killer perk alphabetically, and the killer perk list breaches 2 pages long (iirc it's 4 pages). 
---
He might be full of shit about being new, but downvoting me for pointing out that he isn't in a KYF lobby isn't doing any good
---
Source?
---
as much as i agree, you have to remember that the ptb exists to literally test these things (altho after they let legion thru like he was im a tad worried). I hope if he is bad they change him in some reguard.
---
Did you look in the mirror or are you wrong?
---
Both sides got some buffs and nerfs.
---
Enduring, PGtW both got nice buffs. Territorial Imperative did too, even if not a commonly used perk. Killers can now see which direction a survivor is looking.
---
MoM got a nerf. Unbreakable got a buff, but it's pretty situational. The other survivor perks that were buffed aren't commonly used. Survivors vaulting was nerfed (or maybe fixed if it was a bug).
---
I love him to one of my favorite killers and I‚Äôm also going to play him anyway but he is one of the worst killers in the game and I hope they give him some love while in ptb
---
You bitchs act like it's already live and not PTB rofl. The last several killers all had many many tweaks as well as all major bugs being fixed before going live.
---
Not really good against experienced survivors, it works well with unnerving presence tho, the perk alone is good in the 3 gen strat.
---
It is but higher tier Surviviors get through it pretty easily
---
The abandoned supermarket is a really good idea since it can be large and have plenty of space but personally I would love the huge house from the original scream movie that the house party was in. It was a enormous house so would be awesome and it would have an outdoor area and a barn and stuff etc so it could possibly work. Just my opinion though.
---
Distressing is not good on doc? Come one dude
---
I never said he was in a KYF lobby. You really need to stop putting words in people's mouths.
---
Edit: 
---
&gt;...unless you're playing KYF...
---
he didn't say that
---
I wish things were different too :(  
---
But the good news is, they will probably scramble and try to fix him up given the reaction. Remember, the want to sell that DLC.
---
You do you boo, but NOED on Huntress is just as questionable as NOED on Myers.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you are being downvoted as I‚Äôve heard the same thing you‚Äôve heard. If someone would like to say you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôd love to see a source.
---
You're suggesting nerfing several killers into the ground, despite the fact that several of them weren't even very good to begin with. Everyone sees your angle, friend.
---
It contradicts the time period of his lore. 1993 did not feature cameras in cell phones.
---
You haven't tested his crouch speed but you just said in your last comment that it's the same as his base move speed.
---
Stop pulling shit out of your ass.
---
It takes longer for the killer to get there, they have to do down near it, and it's almost always in a very safe building. Basement is just fine how it is.
---
Right now only Myers is still in a good spot.  And he came out right between Nurse and Hag.
---
It's so ridiculously concerning to me that we need a PTB to point these issues out to them at this point.
---
You don't have to play him. Doc is a good blood point farming killer so you can just farm BP with him and then put the points into trapper for his teachables.
---
mean critisism is still critisism and if they say it with such intensity in their choice of words the devs will know that hes shit and useless real quick (but i havent played him yet so i dont know if all these is true or not)
---
And I hear the same whining crying and excuses from people JUST LIKE YOU
---
Wait. So now you're speaking for OP now? Good job.
---
Very easy. Whatever checks now happen on every frame, make that happen on emote, in direction of the character, instead of camera.
---
I'd argue Spirit bc she can't see blood while phasing without father glasses
---
yeah, it‚Äôd be sad to see Freddy, which is an s++ killer, better than nurse with 5 blinks, be nerfed hard during this rework, I really don‚Äôt want Freddy to be a bad killer. /s for the oblivious
---
Sorry, I am a solo queue survivor and get farmed in basement every few matches *shrug*
---
I am complaining that it has absolutely no variety or counterplay. Just one entrance/exit and that's it, otherwise you play ring around the rosey with lockers.
---
Even better, 2 people end up in basement and now the game is completely forfeit and most of the time teammates just DC or kill themselves. Great mechanic, very enjoyable for everyone involved.
---
It‚Äôs one thing to give the hatch out of mercy.
---
But can we agree it is a total dick move if the last survivor who is hooked manages to get off (keep in mind the chances) and is heading towards the exit and you just down them and hook again?
---
This has happened three times too many to me
---
I think people just get excited whenever it‚Äôs time to shit on BHVR. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even know PTB stands for public TEST build
---
You don't need nurses (or any tracking perk) on doctor. Your fake doctor auras and screaming is more than enough.
---
the only problem is that it completely destroys basically all looping
---
That is literally me *quoting you dude*. You said in your first comment that he won't get red add ons that much "UNLESS UR PLAYING KYF". 
---
Jfc its like I'm talking to a kindergartener.
---
You willing to make a imgur of all the hair to see ?
---
DARN
---
But he can teabag tho so hes instantly the best killer in the game, what are you talking about? /s
---
Read my first comment again, i said that i can be mistaken about crouch speed. And yes, i have played ptb and he's okay. Sure his power doesn't work as it should, but PTB is made to reveal such troubles and fix them. It's been less then 12 hours since GF ptb release and everyone is crying like he's gonna remain that way on live.
---
Or better: Their FoV is restricted to how much their heads can rotate. So you can't look directly behind you, unless the Exorcist girl is added as survivor
---
I might do that because trapper has good perks
---
I jus loaded up the ptb, and my 200k bp I had farmed for the ptb has been eliminated to 2k. It also reset my rank down from 15 to 17, and reset levels on characters. Basically two days worth of progress are gone now thanks to it.
---
It‚Äôs quite the opposite and applies to you...
---
Security and check out sound super powerful, it's an awesome character
---
Playing the Bing Bong Boi, I see you are a man of culture as well
---
I don't understand why Object of Obsession and Spine Chill works against him. It makes more sense to not work against him than to not work against EW1 Myers ...
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Why are people downvoting you for dissing a perk tf?
---
&gt;I never said he was in a KYF lobby. You really need to stop putting words in people's mouths.
---
&gt;Edit: 
---

---
You wanna say you didn't say "unless ur in KYF" again??
---
The PTB takes your save file from quite a bit before the actual day it starts. It's not a same day file transfer kind of thing.
---
The passive effect isnt great and the buff from distressing isnt much either. It really isnt good unless you build your whole build around his terror radius effects. There are better perks than distressing.
---
1) have you tested it with addons? Anyway it's good for confusing survivors, as they tend to make mistakes when they suddenly lose you.
---
2) camera spin thing is confirmed to be a bug by devs. Too bad I can't give you the link to it, yet it would definitely be fixed. Night shroud should disappear only if being watched for a second.
---
BTW, have you tested his addons that decrease the range he can be spotted? Do they work?
---
If you like overcharge, you can also run it alongside Hex: Huntresses Lullaby. Since lullaby adds an increase in failed skill check penalty. Which also stacks with overcharge so you can get like a 10%+ instant progress kick by combining the perks.
---
I started like a month ago I consider that new
---
I tested it in KYF and I was able to detect the killer at the same range (basically the terror radius distance)
---
Stop stressing with what other ppl say and enjoy the game
---
You but she can only injure you with that. Once you learn how to loop properly she's trash.
---
Take my upvote and go
---
Not disagreeing with your first statement, but the killer can still block the stairs by standing in the doorway at the top.
---
God dammit. And here I was trying to save up for ghost face. Why though?
---
They added to Yamaoka the tiles introduced with Mount Ormond which are also present in Red Forest maps.
---
Then you probably dedicated a lot of time for the stuff you have. These guys are assuming ur in a "kill your friends" lobby bc you have Iridescent king. I'm only telling them that you aren't bc the screenshot has evidence that indicates otherwise
---
I guess you mean money? ;)
---
Yeah the way I see it is without me and the killers they dont have a game
---
In that situation, I'd just offer them a headstart to give them a slight chance, but that's all.
---
Oh shit, I read it wrong, thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah but he seems to be kinda in Ash‚Äôs sight sooo
---
A first person view wouldn‚Äôt really work.
---
I mean, the entire reason survivors have a third person view is to give them a better sense of their surroundings than the killers have.
---
For me, I like both, but definitely two different experiences completely. Sometimes I'm in the mood for one over the other. Try them out! You might actually like Survivor better than you think!
---
Idk man Ghostface was always just a mask, not a persistent character like Jason or Michael Myers. Different killers donned the mask.
---
The entire concept is shit. Your power effectiveness shouldn't have to depend on the survivors aiming their camera at you. He'll pretty much be a M1 killer until it's reworked.
---
Happened to me today, actually.
---
Spirit and Hag are both really strong Meta killers, definitely good ones to be working on.
---
Huntress definitely isn't for everyone, she has a whole different playstyle compared to pretty much every other killer. Fun to whip out every now and then though, and she's a good time in KYF if you want maximum salt.
---
Either way, as long as you are having fun, doesn't really matter who you play :)
---
Good survivors will just hit the skill check and render it pointless. It's definitely a low tier perk at high ranks.
---
That was basically the Legion experience prior to the rework
---
You didn‚Äôt even use his good add ons. 
---
Those survivors should be really embarrassed lol
---
looking at Ghostface with object of obsession deactivates his stealth
---
Maybe he's secretly a survivor for a later killer
---
Hes objectively worse just from his power description. Myers's ability effects all survivors and gives him longer lunge and faster vault speed. Ghostfaces only gives expsosed on one survivor, he cant stalk when being stared at and the stalk metre goes down when the surv isnt being stalked so it cant be 99%'ed.
---
I was gonna write a pissed off comment, then I reread the first paragraph and realized it was a joke.
---
Top tier shitpost, my friend, top tier.
---
STBFL is good for him, as it is for all M1 killers... and Sloppy Butcher, but thats about it i can think. Oh and of course NOED and Ruin
---
Standing still I'm assuming no?
---
No wonder it takes 9 years for her to crouch. God damnit, Kramer.
---
Pig
---
I was gonna get every cosmetic for him (even the shitty re colors) but if he's still trash on release, you can guarantee I won't. And Scream is my favorite movie.
---
It‚Äôs an opinion and they can have it. I like the first and 4th one. Haven‚Äôt seen the others
---
Sadly, yeah, I've also got this kind of games a lot lately, Behaviour's new measures cant come fast enough... I hope players that do this get punished hard with temporal and perma bans since it sucks.
---
In your second statement. Literally the first sentence.
---
I think it's due to translation issues as in some languages The Ghost and The Spirit would mean exactly the same thing
---
She makes up for it by actually having a power :^)
---
Both. ghost piggy!
---
Scream is one of the shiniest horror gems in my book.
---
can't argue with that
---
Easy: Amanda's stealth is not being broken when someone sees her.
---
Damn you Slow Ass Motherfucking Jeff if you wouldn't have shot Amanda maybe she wouldnt take a year to crouch
---
so far it's been 100% pig
---
it really is sad. When survivors DC, they really screw over the rest of the team.
---
when i get two DCs, i know i'm not getting out, i just have to content myself with doing the best i can.
---
as a killer, i just want my fucking bbq stacks.
---
They won‚Äôt do perma bans most likely temp like siege
---
this is clearly satire 
---
or at least i hope so
---
&gt; perma bans
---
i'm not so much in support of this, because i've had my game crash a few times, and i'll be damned if i'm going to get permabanned because of a buggy game
---
That's a good point...
---
I know right it's like giving someone a new console and them liking the box or something. -.-
---
It‚Äôs more to prevent him from stalking the new player and killing others because of it but agreed. 
---
Forgot about his buff, My bad
---
I wonder how that‚Äôs going 
---
It‚Äôs meant to stop trap campers that anchor survivors via 4 traps 
---
Ehh I don‚Äôt think so
---
That‚Äôs a buff if you read it right.
---
Interesting (not really)
---
Amanda doesn't have her power countered by the Survivor panning their camera. She's safe.
---
...for now. [*Dun-Dun-DUN!*](https://youtu.be/zyVKJXfRm_g?t=8)
---
There have actually been three different killers for Jason to my knowledge
---
What would people think if they added Carl after caving to pressure from the community BUT
---
Carl doesn't have any unique perks, BUT hes free... or only iridescent shards. I don't know, but I think we are far more likely to get Carl as an actual character if they don't have to completely design a bunch of perks, balance them etc.
---
We all know how good BHVR is at making changes and fixing bugs from the PTB /s
---
And yet they still reworked DS. 
---
Funny how that worked out, hm
---
Good flavor though!
---
Damn you play alot
---
&gt; Spirit is blatantly overpowered.
---
Are you actually saying that seriously?
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure its that thing where if killers stand still long enough and move it makes a screech noise. I don't really understand why it's a feature anyway outside of Insidious but yeah.
---
There should be some indicator, that let's you know, if a survivor is looking at you or not.
---
Kate looks badass in bloodface.
---
People who Stan by noed will downvote for having an opinion. My comment has been downvoted too lol.   Karma means nothing on this subbreddit, people are just weird lol.
---
Oh no not them again!
---
Watch out for fake baby Dwights.
---
nah u won't hear that from me since I stopped playing red ranks after the devs showed that they don't give a shit about highrank balance.
---
The Nea Karlsson
---
That seems reasonable, thanks for pointing that out.
---
nobody:
---
me with check out: ***im fast as fucc boiiii***
---
He said they changed him and that they arent putting out shitty DLC but hes still shit.
---
Only if they add official VR support and make it an option for survivors (with maybe a BP bonus for doing it the hard way)
---
oh geeze these comments became real fun.
---
50k BP is almost nothing.  
---
You should focus on getting BBQ &amp; Chili from Bubba; it gives 100% more bp each game.
---
It's because this company sucks at what they do.
---
Scream sucks? you must know know horror. It's a cult classic. A 90s slasher gem.
---
They need to disable the ability for survivors to cancel it. Instead, looking at him should make his expose charge time slower. I think that would be a fair trade off.
---
They could even change add ons to affect how slow survivors can make his expose charge time. 
---
For this to work his expose charge time may need adjusting AND so may how long survivors stay exposed.
---
I'm not sure, fixing him could be tricky.
---

---
Well in a match the max bp gain is 32k. If you are playing survivor and playing well you are likely to make an average of around 13 to 18k bp per match.
---
As killer you will make around 20 to 28k per match if you are playing relatively well through the match and managing to hook survivors. 
---
Its easy to gain bp back once you get certain perks and offerings to increase your bp gainage throughout a match. 
---
The smart way to invest your bp is to choose who you are likely going to play/try first. 
---
If you plan on playing survivor then invest the bp into David King. Every survivor has unique perks that once you level them to 30, 35 and 40 you unlock them for all the other characters. 
---
David King has a perk called "We are going to live forever" that will increase the amount of bp you earn while playing survivor if you safely unhook survivors. If you unlock and use that perk you will gain more bp through all your survivor matches which will increase your bp gainainge and potentialy allow you to earn around 20 to 40k bp per match depending on how well you are doing and how many unhooks you performed
---
If you plan on playing killer then you will on average earn more bp than playing survivor. Invest the points into any killer that you wish to play and go on from there. Experiment with the different killer and find the one you prefer best.
---
Oh, well, this changes literally everything, my bad.
---
I bet I could find someone on the street who would agree with both of these points.
---
Here's what I actually said:
---
&gt;I'd replace Nurse's with BBQ. Also, you likely won't always get a pink add-on so you could swap it out with something else (unless you're playing KYF)
---
Nah from a power dynamic perspective I completely understand why Decisive was reworked. I'm only saying if I was in charge of reworking it, I'd have allowed it to work more in tandem with OOO from a thematic standpoint
---
They both get cancelled and returned to their owners.
---
What if being spotted didn't end the power, but stalking was simply cumulative? The longer you stalk, the longer your target(s) will be exposed when you lunge. If you stalk meg and feng working on a generator, and feng sees you, feng is gonna run of course. Meg might just think she left to go heal the dwight. Little does she know ghostface is stocking up precious seconds of exposed.
---
50,000 is not a lot of bloodpoints.
---
i'm not very good, and it takes me 2-4 matches to get around that amount, based on how well i do and whatnot.
---
but i feel like i should tell you that i think you may be confusing terminology. you cannot buy killers/survivors with bloodpoints. you can only "level" them up in their bloodweb.
---
Amen to that.
---
Which insinuated that he was in a KYF lobby. The quote in parentheses btw you went on to deny that you said.
---
Here's the full quote:
---
I'd hit
---
A German guy hier,is dear somezing we make Schnitzel of?
---
Gr√º√üe
---
Funny how accurate this was
---
I told him to switch out Iridescent Glass ***UNLESS HE IS PLAYING KYF***
---
New MoM will activate regardless of being injured, so that's good.
---
While we're at it, Cloaked Wraith should be immune as well. That alone would be an amazing buff.
---
Bloodpoints are for the bloodweb (perks, items, add-ons, etc.) so you can't use them to buy killers. to do that you need either Iridescent shards, which you get by leveling up your devotion (account level- the big yellow circle next to rank) or auric cells which you buy with real dollars. 
---
The first thing you want to do is look at all of the characters "Teachable perks"- those are the orange perks that are unique to each killer/survivor. When you find perks you really like, put as many blood points into that character. When you get a character to levels 30, 35 and 40, you unlock each of their teachable perks for all the other characters, which means when you start leveling up other characters, theres a chance for the teachable will appear in the bloodweb. some useful/meta perks on the free characters which i would recommend going for first are Hex: Ruin from  Hag, Nurse's Calling from Nurse, and Enduring from Hill Billy. For survivors Self Care from Claudette and either Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, or Lithe from Meg, Nea, or Feng Min repsectively.
---
Rin was dying
---
To answer the title, it's because he could use it.
---
its scary how accurate this is even for ranks 12-15 lmao
---
Had a guy tell me how OP Freddy is and that the devs are crazy for buffing him
---
I laughed more than I should have, because I always run Franklin's on Clown.
---
Understandable have a great day
---
This was explained in the second dev diary from what i remember by the devs, the survivors get a third person camera to allow them to be able to multitask and be more aware of the environment and their surroundings, the killers camera is first person, which helps them focus on chasing.
---
His power is confirmed to be bugged and should only be able to be taken away by a survs model looking at GF
---
Beautifully written. This speaks directly to my heart.
---
You then went on to say that the quote you said in parentheses was never said by you and then claimed I was speaking for the OP by pointing out to you that he ISN'T in a KYF. 
---
You also then went on to ask how he has so many perks and a red add on for doctor if he's new to the game, insinuating that he's in a Lobby where he'd have access to perks a newer killer wouldn't have access to in your mind, which defended an assertion that he was in a KYF lobby.
---
Legion was always better than Freddy, simply because when survivors DCd against legion it was because they knew it would be a hard match. Challenge
---
Against Freddy the DCs were because nobody wants to fuck with the dream world bullshit. Annoying
---
Why would you try to unhook yourself and waste other people's time doing gens?
---
And that's my point, the counter play is "avoid the area of the map that has basement" which isn't really counter play because it doesn't involve any situation where you are already hooked in basement.. What's wrong with just adding an extra set of stairs so that it isn't just a 1 entrance room? I have never liked any map design that involves rooms with 1 entrance. Limiting options isn't good game design.
---
Welcome to the Fog! 
---
Alright, so BPs are the currency used to progress your survivors and your killers. It can‚Äôt be used to buy DLC characters unfortunately. Rather, they can be purchased with Auric Cells (real money) or Iridescent Shards (earned by playing a lot). 
---
50k BP isn‚Äôt too much sadly. It‚Äôll get you a little bit of progress in the start but it will go faster than you realize. Every game is different but in general, survivors earn anywhere from 0 to 32k depending on how it goes, but usually landing around 10-15k in the start. Killers can also earn up to 32k, and generally have better BP earnings, usually around 20-25k. There are consumable items called Offerings that can give you extra BP as well. 
---
If I were you, I‚Äôd choose one survivor and one killer and split them among them, so you have at least a little progression in both roles so you can play them a bit more comfortably and see what you like to play. You can save them up if you want to, but in the beginning, you‚Äôll benefit more from steady and slow progression than waiting to spend them all at once. It will also give you the opportunity to learn the perks as you go and keep you from getting too overwhelmed. 
---
There are a few ways to increase your BP gains. For killers, there is a perk called BBQ and Chili (earned from leveling Leatherface) which can give you up to 2x BP and also provides huge in-game benefits to the killer. For survivors, David King has a perk called We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever. This also grants you BP bonuses for being a team players but is less reliable than BBQC. Other than that, offerings can be used to increase gains as well and are obtained by spending BP (ironically) in the bloodweb. 
---
Also, the game has regular events called Bloodhunts in which BP gains are doubled. There‚Äôs one coming soon fortunately, from June 14-18, I think, and it‚Äôs highly recommended to play as much as you can during this time as the game is a heck of a grind.
---
You can't buy killers with Bloodpoints (BP), only Iridescent Shards or Auric Cells. However, assuming you mean levelling up killers instead of buying them, I wouldn't spend too many BP just yet. Try each killer for a game or two, then spend them on your favourite. Later on, you'll potentially be able to earn 50k BP in a single killer game, but without the right perks or addons, you'll earn BP much more slowly. Once you've spent those starting points on your favourite killer that killer will be better equipped to earn you more BP more quickly. Hope I was clear enough, good luck.
---
First they nerf ds ... it had it coming ... then they buff the stun bcuz resilience made it a joke ... well it fucks people that dont use resilience but ok ... now resilience doesnt affect it and its still 5 seconds god help us.
---
By that logic, stuff like someone giving you the middle finger doesn't mean anything.
---
Unfortunately this is due to Trapper recently having some back troubles. I've been working on a fund to get him a chiropractor.
---
I think a way to go about it would be that people who DC lots get put in lobby's with other people who do and they stay out of the pool of players that do not DC so they can all have fun with there people and see how fun it is
---
That‚Äôs what they all say üëÄ
---
Here is what I actually wrote:
---
So, reading comprehension time. I never insinuated he was in KYF. You inferred that.
---
I insinuated that Iridescent Glass isn't practical for a build unless he is in KYF.
---
Didn't spirit absolutely fucking suck in her ptb?
---
I'd smash.
---
You also then went on to assume he had more perks than a newer player would which asserts a claim that he's in KYF
---
Wraith is pretty solid, but I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs harder to play at the purple+ ranks. I‚Äôm not sure I believe that though as a wraith demolishes my SWF group the other day and we‚Äôre all rank 2-8 on survivor. 
---
I‚Äôve only played Trapper a few times but I can‚Äôt really get the hang of him
---
She did. They buffed her to her awesome status now.
---
It is way to early to be deciding if he is shit or not. Just like every time. Let the killers adapt and let the survivors adapt and then we should assess where he is. Any nerfs/buffs they do now ALWAYS lead to the killer being problematic in a few weeks.
---
Exactly or ps party
---
Oh oops, I guess I read it wrong lol. Thanks for the advice.
---
made with memeatic
---
And people are acting like Ghostface is always gonna be like how he is now.
---
Lol. That doesn't insinuate that he is! That's like me saying, "ketchup is good, unless you're eating soup". Did I just insinuate he was going to eat soup with ketchup or that he was eating soup? No.
---
Wow these are really good
---
Well you would not be able to loop at all.
---
If she chases you, you cannot recover from the attack.  So if she chases you for some time even without catching up its like a distance hit. So yeah, plague is strong
---
As a Pig main that really enjoys Michael Myers, I'd rather have a power that makes sense with the Scream movie. Only saw the first Scream, but pretty sure Ghostface never crouched or stalked.
---
They're stupid inconsistent. Sometimes I'd stare straight up and still get blinded and other times they'd just do nothing.
---
Or ur further assumption that he shouldn't have the perks he has if he's new, which is a blatant assumption that he's in KYF
---
The game would stop being the same. Personally I think I wouldn‚Äôt be playing this if it truly were an horror game
---
Easily, she‚Äôs a good killer.
---
Get to a million, then just spend 100k at a time(or 30k-50k if you're a survivor main).
---
seems a little political for a game (yes i am aware its a shitpost, just think it could offend people)
---
Only after tho, not evrry game gets that far
---
You should see the second one, it's alright but not that great. And probably just skip three. It's just not Scream
---
Best reply ever to a mistake haha
---
It's not even a cult classic, its just a straight up classic.
---
Or like spine chill (killer has to be facing u)
---
At 1 1/2 hours a day, I'd say 3-4 days
---
Sweet, I can't wait to see everything. Console player here :(
---
I like that it speeds up the game tbh. It‚Äôs only 1 dude getting away
---
Same here. May the frame rates be with you
---
Slug the 3rd guy, problem solved üóø
---
See what you average out daily, and then X it by how many days you have left
---
i can appreciate an office reference.
---
To add on, it's likely that you will have to mouse over a visible part of him so his lean actually makes sense.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury(only with enduring), Sloppy Butcher, Deerstalker, BBQ &amp; Chili, Whispers(only tier 3), Nurse's Calling, Agitation.    
---
I've never played on PS4, but you get better with practice.  
---
Learn how to curve properly, what can you slide on, and how to chainsaw-bait. When in close range, try chainsawing unless the survivor's at a window.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Enduring and either Spirit Fury, Nurses, or Overcharge is a great build on him.  The first three are pretty much meta on him.  There is the most room to play with that fourth slot.
---
I know, but im sort of a perfectionist.  It just bothers me that this guy is escaping for a bs reason
---
They fixed it and banned everybody that took advantage of that bug...they were able to track everybody who did it.
---
There is a big difference between the backstory of Jason and the teens who wore the Scream mask.
---
I won't recommend Ruin on Billy, as I think you learn better with him by getting your ass handed to you.
---
Yikes
---
PWYF is good, you can Dislike it, but that doesnt make it bad
---
You got a point
---
Lowering the camera a tiny bit could actually work debatably, that or making to closer to your back.
---
&gt;Can we please rework the basement to have more exits and entrances before we start encouraging these builds? Even just 2 sets of stairs would be nice so that it is not a certain death trap when you try to leave as a survivor.
---
It's the fucking *basement,* it's supposed to be the Killer's strongest area and a danger for Survivors. So no. Your idea is stupid.
---
Slug number 3 and then camp them while they bleed out, guaranteed that last survivor will linger near you because they have nothing better to do.
---
Or you can just not give a shit about the hatch.  
---
Slugging is a good idea, though.
---
I keep seeing "M1" what does it mean?
---
I also play solo queue. It's not an issue.
---
Pamela and Jason, who am I missing? Not an avid fan of f13.
---
Revolutionized? Now that's bold.  What do you think it brought to the table?
---
How is PWYF good? You need to let a survivor go for you to get stacks, and it's way too easy to lose them.
---
This is a good idea, or at the very least have them look at him with their model rather than their camera.
---
They fixed the problem with the camera jerk when picking up traps at least, it seems they've solved it so that you stay facing down after picking up a trap.
---
.....
---
Jumpscare...
---
How does that work though?  Cant they just like crawl away?
---
Save the Best for Last is legit pretty great.  That's a staple on several of my m1 killer builds.
---
Perfection doesn't exi-
---
The survivor can just fling their mouse and stop you from using your power; I don't think you can possibly learn how to use something like that effectively.
---
Sounds like your ping sucks
---
If that particular person is the only person who did anything at all, it‚Äôs definitely not BS.
---
I don‚Äôt agree, the hatch is perfectly fine. Who ever finds it first usually wins.
---
That‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration
---
Save the Best for Last is his best perk in my opinion. There are much better perks for M1 builds though.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do like it. I just wish they would‚Äôve done something similar for Myers. If I had to pick between either of the 2 to have an obnoxiously loud grunt when having a wooden pallet slammed on them it‚Äôd be Ghostface though.
---
Save the best for Last, I always confused the two. sorry
---
The fact that you said this just makes everything you have said even better LUL
---
Congratulations on getting heard by BHVR

That‚Äôs right, I meant ‚ÄúPlayers‚Äù And Here‚Äôs prime example, They make a tier list, Abide by said tier list, Laugh at the bad characters and pick the strongest ones on said list. All of this and how many buffs have they suggested for those ‚ÄúLow tier‚Äù killers? Or did they resort to the broken record of ‚ÄúHe should just be scrapped and re-done entirely‚Äù. They are the worst to take tips from.
---
Well you can unhook with deliverance without ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with the killer having one area on the map that they can completely dominate? Half the time there isn‚Äôt even a gen above it unless it‚Äôs the hospital. 
---
As a killer I don‚Äôt even waste my time there unless I down someone right above it. As a survivor I try to work around the area.
---
I agree with Save the Best for Last being okay.  
---
PWYF is still shit though.
---
Plus Totems others break. Definitely a good change. Killer still needs fixed, though. I snowballed a game yesterday and got a 4k and only safety pipped. That's ridiculous.
---
I like to think it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs more ‚Äúghostly‚Äù in the Entity‚Äôs realm so he‚Äôs less human now.
---
means all he has is his basic attack
---
I'm a little late to the party, does Ghostface not have a theme song, or are they just not included in the ptb?
---
There's a double bloodpoint event the weekend before Ghostface is available (June 14 - 18). You should be able to make a million fairly easy if you can play at least a day on that weekend.
---
They all look great, IMO! I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre finally touching up some of the older cosmetics.
---
Only cool thing about him is his design and the noises made for him and his power.
---
Apparently the 360 camera swivel disabling his power is a bug, but I still agree with this statement. All you have to do is stay aware of your surroundings and he becomes a Pig with no traps.
---
Hopefully they buff him after fixing this bug, because I don't really see a reason to use him instead of Myers (besides his looks).
---
Can I get this template
---
I mean once the problems are addressed yes? Like day one of PTB is known to have issues.
---
Until we the main killers get tired of having only 4 or 5 viable killers at red rank and decide to left the game.
---
Dude have you ever played spirit? Its fucking hard. Some would argue harder than nurse due to the mental component.
---
As a Dwight main I gotta say... he lookin like a baddie
---
All they have to do is turn around and your power is rendered useless
---
You‚Äôre talking about Nea right? I agree it‚Äôs a underwhelming cosmetic still all the same. I wish they‚Äôd give her some good long hair like Kate, Jane and Min tho.
---
It served its purpose and is probably accurate. And Excuse you? You‚Äôre trying to putting a lot of words in my typing history in an order that is not my own, The toxicity comes from the immediate attempts to completely dismiss something which in the title was in my opinion, That‚Äôs a toxic community right there
---
Then you wake up
---
Basically revitalized the slasher genre after it had died down in the late 80s by introducing a meta perspective and characters who wastched horror movies and were aware of the tropes. Having the cast be genre savvy made for cool references and more interesting and smart characters, instead of big guy going through horny teen A through Z like butter.
---
It inspired a new wave of slashers and paved the way for most of the other meta horror movies that came after it.
---
Oh did they? So if they see you, you can't stalk?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think Saw, Halloween, TCM, or NoES license holders are concerned, especially since none of them have upcoming releases (that I‚Äôm aware of, at least). Its also the Test Build and Ghost Face is confirmed not working as intended. Bare in mind this isn‚Äôt the final release, but even so I don‚Äôt think his counters were well thought out.
---
one was salty as fuck (the looper), and the others were having a laugh about it with me
---
Another thing: even if they don't spot you, he is extremely loud, you must be deaf not to hear him coming.
---
I've had people try. After the second trap, you place one down near a building, and walk around the building. You then find them and slug them. Ghostface will have the same thing
---
Did you also got something about claudettes hair?
---
If they turn your forced out of stealth, you need to be in stealth to stalk, so yea
---
Need some confirmation from other people who played the PTB for us console scrubs
---
Wait did I miss that the ptb is live?
---
He has sounded insanely loud since his PTB
---
I feel like pyro would make more sense as a killer but this is still a very good concept
---
Along with him being loud as hell even in stealth mode. You can hear him coming from a mile away, it makes no sense at all. Sounds like a freaking airplane.
---
No, it was because the Legion took all skill fron the game and was completely unfun to go against. He could down you no matter what, he could tunnel you and there would be nothing you could do about it, he added a new layer of hold down one button to do something, you can't lose him because he just smacks your teammate and comes right back to you, his add-ons were stupid as fuck. It wasn't a hard match it was a boring match that might as well be played against bots, he was literally rewarded by respecting pallets. He was not fun to play against at all and made survivors wonder what the point of playing that game was.
---
PTB is live.
---
We are not being toxic, you are a player who is new to the game. You are then coming with suggestions that are  beyond reasonable, and we can see that. We are not toxic for saying that you first need to play the game to have a good view on the game.
---
The selfie taker.
---
How did u get rid of UI?
---
a while back, I yanked a Jane from a locker as Huntress. I wondered why she didnt use Head On, since she clearly was planning it. I figured she got the timing wrong. I hooked her, then walked back to the same locker to reload. after I di, I took two steps away, and the locker flew open on its own with no one in it. didnt stun me, though.
---
Woah you actually got a kill as ghostface?
---
Woooooosh
---
Awesome! how have I not heard of that before this post :D
---
Then when I versus a Head On user as killer I always get stunned
---
The instagramer
---
ik right like pallet stuns should stun killers for 2 minutes and only end when a generator gets completed like omg killers are op as hell
---
for starters one had a flashlight, prestige claud is a typical stereotype sadly, they looped me all game, teabagged on the opposite side of pallets in safety, used every single pallet (i dont know how the fuck there were so many, there 4 within a short range of killer shack) and 99ing gates
---
Moonwalking will finally have a purpose besides style points and flexing on the killer
---
Thanks but it's not that big of a deal. Any other map I'm usually good to go.
---
You have to be shrouded to stalk. If the survivors look in your general direction your shroud and ability to stalk go away for a while.
---
Yupp
---
Sometimes they wiggle out and give me a friendly tbag whilst I guide them to the hatch also I love your flair
---
I edited it photoshop
---
He has a song, this person has their menu music off.
---
but it was mostly the previous round that was super toxic, i just forgot to change my build, i never really check it lol
---
They could just make it so when being looked at stalking takes longer like in the dev build.
---
That's completely retarded
---
It was mentioned on several occasions. Not to mention all the posts on this sub about how bad Ghost Face is.  
---
Also, I have no idea why he's called "The Ghost Face" and not "The Ghost".
---
these tiles are confusing af but it is nice to see some map change
---
i never whined? i only stated the events that happened lol, ur silly
---
This is honestly my favorite thing lmao
---
This is so annoying. And then you watch them proceed to self heal for 5 minutes instead of letting me do it in 1 minute.
---
Maybe. All I know is, if Ghostface stays the way he is; this will be the first killer DLC I'll be passing on. Survivors being capable of actually pulling you out of your own power just sounds frustrating to me. At least Freddy rework is coming out soon after, so it'll still be like having a new killer with that.
---
That's a pretty solid Wraith buff.
---
Sorry :D
---
I mean until it's fixes he's bad. People aren't wrong.
---
Dude all you parrot all day is "tHis iS pTb"
---
Find something better to do, Ghostface is weak as shit right now.
---
Oh he‚Äôs bad? üòï that‚Äôs disappointing
---
I mean pallets are one thing survivors SHOULD feel safe at. They took out half of what there used to be, and they are more separated than they used to be as well. So I think removing killers being able to NOT hit a survivor through a pallet when getting stunned is the way it's SUPPOSED to be. No more killers getting a hit they didn't deserve. And no more survivors getting downed even tho they successfully stunned a killer. For the longest, pallets felt useless because of the "hit while getting stunned" thing.
---
I mean, he's bugged on PTB. So don't make your judgement off his current state
---
Which is why Ghostface is currently on PTB. 
---
You whine exactly like the cry babies posting. Bye now.
---
Exactly... First I have to get to a pallet and how the hell would I know where a pallet is if they are so randomly distributed?

He said it incorrectly. Spirit is incredibility annoying to VS as everything against it is just a guessing game.
---
Sure, but if you can watch their head looking around you can tell if it's safe to dash out for the grab, or if they rotate in a steady direction you can time cover (or just stop moving as Wraith). Or you can tell that they're a potato who doesn't look around and you can approach without fear. That sort of thing.
---
The hair looks like spaghetti on low quality though so rip
---
Since the "secret" offerings aren't really a secret: you can figure out a Shroud of Separation instantly and a Splinter is visible instantly 60% of the time, and if you notice *any* perk, you know it's not Splinter.
---
Hiding in a locker meanwhile generators are getting done everywhere else while you wait.
---
Oh ye I worded it wrong, even made of plastic they're a pain to deal with so there's not much going around, thats why I said AC has some plastic props but that's about it cause they're very annoying to deal with
---
&gt;His stealth doesn't last forever until he's seen anymore, either. Makes it way harder to approach survivors. 
---
Yes it does.
---
&gt;Also, when you were spotted before, you had a few seconds while your meter depleted to still be stealthy. Now, it's instant. 
---
This is a bug BHVR are aware of as of today
---
&gt;One thing that really frustrates me too, is that you can be "spotted" by downed and hooked survivors. So annoying. :T
---
Agreed, this needs to be changed
---
Yeah man you go! Gotta defend Behavior, they are a small indie company who doesn't need any criticism.
---
It's a free escape, I feel they should nerf it by increasing the total hits to reward high risk play, 3 hits is a free escape since it will trigger 90% of games and pretty much doesn't require much skill to activate
---
That wig is laid for the gods, bitch.
---
It's misleading...
---
I always want to run non meta perks or just try new things out once in a while but I just get destroyed by sweats or something else happens. Like when I try to run Autodidact but get no skillchecks or people run map wide to self care
---
Glad to see "yikes" catching on
---
What the guy said about the cannibal being underpowered is true, but don't let that stop you from playing him. He's actually one of the most friendly killers, and at your level of playing, you really shouldn't worry about killers' power levels since they mostly depend on your grasp of more advanced concepts.
---
Nurse on the other hand is the exact opposite. By far the strongest killer in the right hands, but probably the hardest to play. 
---
As you start to face better survivors you'll probably understand why different killers are considered stronger than others, but for now just worry about solidifying your bases, and the best way to do that is to have fun playing a balanced game, even if that means using an easy killer.
---
Ah thanks. Regardless not many people know Pamela is the og killer (like the girl in scream 1) and I'd bet even less know about Roy. Jason is the star of the show. That's not really the same with Ghostface.
---
Bye? Alright bud have fun. I'm expecting about 100 more of these comments from you complaining about complainers. What a very great use of your time.
---
Ya that's why I'm annoyed. They could have called him The Ghost or The Ghostface, but The Ghost Face is mildly infuriating.
---
Even if they fix it, his ability is just bad. Even if you somehow manage to get that stalk Meg will just Sprint burst away and loop you for 20 seconds.
---
Spirit Fury optional.  Very good but so are both Nurses and Overcharge due to his mobility.  Easy to take advantage of both.  Say what you want about ruin but that's a personal call to go without it.  Like it or not it's meta in general.
---
Taking a smoke break murdered tf out of all of us.
---
Do all the survivors lol
---
Or just "Ghostface"
---
They are not out yet. Technically the summer season has not began yet
---
Stop playing dickhead and go have a read (:
---
Additionally it wasn‚Äôt mentioned nor was it clear that i was a new player, Someone randomly suggested it which is actually common for toxic communities, You gotta dismiss their opinions in anyway you can
---
It triggers me. The Ghost was fine.
---
They're going to come out sometime after the ghostface update.
---
New Franklin‚Äôs buff: Allows killer to completely deactivate a perk upon hitting a survivor.
---
Hag excuse me?
---
Does anybody have images of the other hair updates so us console plebs can see them?
---
You said yourself you have 30 hours in this game.
---
You mean feel safe apart from the 2-3 safe spots on the map or ridiculously easy/long loops? You will soon have more pallets on the map when they redistribute them. Are we balancing this game for the 80% potato playerbase now that is not capable of looping for more than 30 seconds?
---
&gt;1. Ghostface could use his power behind a wall...... you look AT THE WALL and his power is wasted
---
2. Seriously..... a survivor looks at you and your powers on recharge
---
3. 360 spin your camera - Congrats you've now seen ghost face and his power is useless
---
These are all bugs. Stop freaking out over this.
---
&gt;4. Object of obsession = Ghostface useless
---
5. Spinechill = Ghostface useless
---
Meh, not really. Spinechill counters Ghostface just as bad as it does to Myers, and Myers is still fun. Same with OoO. OoO is bugged with the survivor detection thing, too.
---
Make a macro
---
Because D-Strike is arguably stronger now than it's ever been. It's certainly run more than it used to be.
---
Get the Nvidia Experience to change the colors
---
I love the thought of chonky ghost face trying to sneak up on me. Just breathing loudly and stepping heavily.
---
YES! I‚Äôve also been getting this at least half the time I try to make a killer lobby on ps4. Super annoying having to go back to the main screen and reload into the game :/
---
I agree, I mean I get it's called "struggle" for a reason but I wish it was "push x to give up" rather than "mash x to struggle and live"
---
*heavy breathing*
---
*"DO YOU LIKE ANIME?"*
---
Enduring for the 85th time
---
Thanks to noed anyone can get a kill as any killer
---
he used to be a lot more fun
---
Roy was a paramedic who snapped when his son took an axe to the back, and he should be forgotten.
---
I agree with you. In Friday the 13th you cheer for Jason, while in the Scream franchise you try to guess the identity behind the mask.
---
dammit. now i got downvoted. a little too late for a /s.
---
Pre- The majority of the comments
---
Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, Premonition, and Security make the ultimate killer avoidance build.
---
Furthermore Amanda doesn‚Äôt squeak and actually is silent when stunned 50% of the time ??? She should always squeak and Michael should never make noise periodT
---
Oh so you magically have 500 more hours after all these comments?
---
The emblem additions for survs was sorely needed. Thank you BHVR gods
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Survivors need help, let one have a free escape
---
An average player can get 1 mil BP in 4 1/2 to 6 hours?
---
Or they hid the whole time....
---
I love m1 killers for some reason. I just enjoy the simplicity and in all honesty, it‚Äôs ultimately more of a challenge because your ability is trash tier. So you have to rely on your wits and skill.
---
We should have a word for every killer just in case they nerf them to the ground
---
Pig= frick
---
LF= shucks
---
wraith= god fucking dammit
---
I think he means the moving speed while stalking...
---
agreed. there's absolutely nothing wrong with one survivor getting away. 
---
if you expect a 4k every match, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
We need benevolent points somehow m8
---
That's about how long it takes me to, using BP offerings.
---
Yeah lol, that first part was from my first game as him. Apparently I was being spotted immediately every time I used the power, so it always looked like it didn't last forever.
---
I think it's a great addition. It means you cant just hang there. Your on deaths door the killer has hooked you twice. The light is fading you have to struggle to not give in to the strength of the entity. Thematically awesome imo
---
I petition for Nurse to have "bollocks"
---
Really? A perk that let's you instantly escape a Killers grasp doesn't work against, say, Iron Grasp, a perk intended to hold Survivors longer And you can't try to argue it's not negation because then you just get into semantics because Enduring didn't negate DS either. It countered the stun, reducing its effectiveness. Same as an instant escape counters the effectiveness of IG.
---
But Spinechill and other detection perks already don't work against Myers.
---
Well, like I said on another post, killers wouldn't have to worry about loops if they would just break the pallet a survivor is trying to loop at, would save a lot of time and have less loop spots in the end. And it doesn't matter if the players are potatoes or not, it doesn't change the fact that pallets are supposed to be safe and they aren't when u got killers totally ignoring the stun and getting a hit that shouldn't happen to begin with.
---
He is the wordt killer in the game, now he would teleport to gens, place traps, and create fake pallets, also he can hit u in the real world now.
---
They‚Äôre adding back pallets at the expense of shorter loops though. So its nice to not get hit with bs hits through pallets like before
---
Nope
---
Overpowered as fuck lol how is he the worst killer
---
Indeed, the stealth seems incredibly weak, it just goes away instantly when any survivor is remotely nearby
---
Wrong flair. Check out the shitpost option.
---
He's not getting a buff, he's getting a rework. He will be totally different
---
Spirit Fury is much better for him than Nurse's and Overcharge.  
---
Nurse's doesn't do much since you're better off not healing against Billy, and Overcharge is just not needed.
---
Could be your internet. I'm fine running as killer on PS4, out on an island even.
---
I fucking love it
---
Chonky Ghost face‚Äôs ability is just typing novel long reddit shit posts about how toxic the community is. And his add ons are Doritos/Mountain Dew. Increase the duration/effectiveness of ‚ÄòReddit Shitposting‚Äô.
---
So they can force you to lose stacks; they just bodyblock.
---
Funny, that's exactly what I do as the Clown. Because every game, someone sneaks in a purple flashlight up their asshole, or it's an Ace, so I can never be to prepared.
---
I guess the community did devolve at some point...

---
This conversation- post Random suggestions 
---
And you‚Äôre saying that 3 is the reason 2 happened? Thinking straight?
---
Ah. I see. I though the issue was over adding the "the" to the name since traditionally he's just "Ghostface." 
---
Yeah, it should be Ghostface. That's the official spelling, without the space.
---
I think someone got mori'd by a freddy today
---
Explain why it‚Äôs shit?
---
Yeah, played him for a bit and he seems pretty weak
---
Ah, I had not heard that. Got a link by any chance? I'd like to see what exactly is bugged about him.
---
The blood wipe is still a fair nod.
---
I honestly don't understand what you just tried to say.
---
You explained that the reason you came with these suggestions was because you are a new player, is that it?
---
I think you chose the wrong flair
---
Omg that's funny xD
---
That's not a realistic concern though.  How often is the obsession going to spend the game bodyblocking hooks the whole time following a chase?  Seems like a niche concern.  Also I'll take a free hit on anyone if they're offering and you get stacks fast anyways.  They can't make the next safe area post hit you recover so quickly once your tokens are up there.
---
Clean up aisle 9 really encourages the killer to camp
---
Someone else posted about cellphones attached to the survivors and theorizing his power would be to call the phones to reveal them. Building from that, I think survivors should have to call the killer in order to make him turn off his power. Then, if a survivor is calling the killer who is NOT being stalked, they are exposed and the aura is revealed.
---
Isnt that the same thing as the drivers license?
---
I love it! uwu
---
I'm sure they will
---
No you're not the only one literally everyone on the subreddit thinks this lol
---
&gt;these tiles are confusing af but it is nice to see some map change
---
The top one is really strong if you know how to loop it. 
---
[Ormond Version](https://i.imgur.com/JNWDRfp.jpg) (easier to see).
---
You go past the pallet, the killer will usually respect it and then you fast vault the window from both directions, doesn't matter whether you are going in circles to the left or right around the pallet.
---
Put it this way, the hatch is the survivors version of NoED, they get an escape they didn't deserve (unless they were the only person doing anything) just like killers who get 2-4 kills using NoED didn't deserve them. They are clutch mechanics, simple as that
---
I am not one of those folks. I like both. This one just seems neither fish nor fowl.
---
It's like you jumped through a fuckin Stargate lol
---
fun is fun
---
Where can I find these stats?
---
Virgin Ghostface versus Chad Spine Chill
---
yeah i made it for the contest! and thanks!
---
Watchu mean? All cosmetics so far are avaliable with shards
---
Leatherface is called the cannibal in game. (Der Kannibale in german) So who knows how they‚Äôre gonna call Ghostface
---
From what I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre changing he will be OP
---
Is his activateable ability canceled by looking at him or just the ability to stalk?
---
I will have to look those up
---
It should cancel if the survivor‚Äôs head is facing Ghostface. They made it so the camera moves the head too. This means if Ghostface is behind you you will need to turn your whole body around to face him.
---
I think that is supposed to be how it works but maybe it‚Äôs bugged.
---
Yeah that was mentioned, It‚Äôs a mistake lol
---
Claudette is a soldier who fights for our freedom!
---
Okay, fair enough.
---
Thankfully the 360 exploit is a bug, so that's already being patched.
---
But either way, I feel like his power drains way too fast. Survivors should, at the very least have to face their model in GF's direction to break his stealth.
---
Hooked and Downed survivors should not have any effect on GF's stealth at all.
---
Thrilling Tremors should block gens that are being worked on rather than gens that aren't being worked on, and it should have a lower cooldown.
---
I'm all Ears is mostly worthless except for Rework Freddy and maybe if GF still manages to stay in stealth during a chase.
---
The leaning mechanic is meh as a whole because there's something in the way of the survivor 90% of the time.
---
Ah, understood, have a great day
---
Are you somewhat new to the game?
---
Well, i guess nobody undestand the sarcasm.
---
What is?
---
Good job son, you've made me very proud.
---
...thats how literally every mori but 1 works
---
You also forgot the part where Ghostface sounds like a fucking vacuum cleaner while stealthed. Who the fuck thought it would be a good idea to make a stealth Killer have permanent Spirit phasing sounds around him, with absolutely zero addons to lessen it?
---
People like you are disgusting
---
Try re-reading it until it makes sense, Could take a while for you
---
Yes I‚Äôm new, started a few days ago, I‚Äôm starting to watch videos to understand the game
---
Ah, resorting to passive-aggressive insulting instead of coming with arguments. Classic.
---
I'm still going with using the pointing emote at him. Make that shit useful.
---
I‚Äôm still confused why they thought MoM needed any kind of nerf. I‚Äôm convinced they just acquiesced to a lot of upset complaints from killers and youtubers because one extra hit once a match, that a survivor is far from guaranteed to even activate, on a perk that came with a paid DLC is just nonsense. It‚Äôs so much weaker than Dead Hard and even more so now.
---
It's been happening since Plague. 1-3 survivors will be kicked from the match at the same time, and the disconnect audio cue won't play. To the survivors, it looked like the killer disconnected even though the match is still going. They get their points and keep their items.
---
I was being serious, but as I thought, it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm new and shit at the game so I can‚Äôt counter
---
No offence, but if you're new to a game don't talk about what's over/underpowered. Games aren't balanced around new players and something can seem strong in lower levels at first but actually be really weak at high levels and something can seem really weak at low levels but strong in high levels.
---
I don‚Äôt think his post is sarcastic. 
---
He‚Äôs obviously a game pass player.
---
I only have one Version. I don't think that I'm allowed to sale it. The Devs get a Version. But Im not done finishing it.
---
Fair point.  
---
I still think there are better M1 perks like Brutal Strength, Bamboozle(ew), and MYC.  
---
If I had to pick what perks to use in any of my M1 builds, I probably won't take STBFL unless I want some change. I'd probably consider using BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, SF, Whispers, Brutal Strength, or MYC first.
---
Ah, Pointing out the Pitfall trap without the foliage yet too daft to understand a simple explanation at a point you‚Äôve missed.
---
Considering his power only takes 4 seconds to put a survivor in exposed? Yes.
---
Ah right, that makes sense with the original post, you'll learn to counter stealth killers like Freddy and wraith,  at higher ranks they're weaker.
---
That's very interesting..

What's the problem with Enduring?
---
Damn, and I like the scream movies, really hope they fix it and do it justice even if they don‚Äôt actually have the rights to the character (just the mask üòï)
---
We have alot of killer perks that are really good but don't require skill
---
It no longer works on D Strike. That's pretty much it.
---
Jumpscare Myers sucks on the game when you realize every gen (except the bathroom) is out in the open near a safe loop
---
Its nice because it will reward the survivor for not running the killer to where the gens are being done
---
If I have missed the point maybe the problem is with the explanation no?
---
they had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
There are two elements to survivors detecting Ghost Face ‚Äî one is a distance within which they can detect you and break stealth, and the other is an alert which tells you roughly where the survivor breaking your stealth is.
---
If the survivor breaking your stealth is more than a certain distance away, you'll get a notification. This add-on reduces that minimum distance, so you can detect them even if they're closer to you.

Survivors can't flick their mouse if you hunt down and break every mouse except for yours 4head.

How to tell someone‚Äôs new at the game üòÇ
---
Oh, well, at least he is new, then i don't lost all my faith in the community of this game.
---
I honestly only made the post to confirm that I was shit and that he is actually counter-able. I don‚Äôt know why, I‚Äôll delete
---
Of course, cus nothing is your fault and everything you say is correct.
---
Use a macro...
---
Using 'the serpent' instantly uncloaks you.
---
Previously, you couldn't attack for 3 seconds.
---
No, I'm talking both. They banned people doing it in kyf also.
---
Wow man thanks for all of this. I haven‚Äôt tried huntress yet but does look like it would be fun to play. When I first started I was kind of tunneling really hard until I realized that I was getting baited while they did gens. Now that I‚Äôve gotten used to how the game goes I just try to keep as much pressure on gens as possible and I‚Äôve gotten a good bit of 4 kill games
---
Tru3ta1ent also got photo bombed mori.
---
But it's better against pallets; the thing it was meant to be used for.

Lol true
---
Most likely, it's been a long time since I saw the scream movies
---
That's how they make you actually struggle tho my dude, it's not meant to be easy
---
Exactly. I fail to see the issue. D Strike is too situational to be countered by such a staple perk
---
can we get an F in the chat for that wasted pallet
---
I mentioned messing up the flair and forgetting a buff for wraith but Yeah, yeah okay whine on about things you need to feel are true to feel right.
---
Right on the mark feesbadman
---
Man rank 20 really is a completely different game isn‚Äôt it

Like you thinking wraith is op? And Myers being strong?

Your time as a manager helps you to better organize to complete a task
---
By pointing to a object (closed chest, totem or unfinished generator) reveal the aura of the objective in yellow to all survivors, until it is completed.  All survivors who finish the objective gain a bonus 1000 bloodpoints  divided by the number of survivors who finished it.
---
Only one object can be revealed at a time.
---
The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-Trial.

I think it's fine if Enduring doesn't work on perks, and works only on pallets instead.

Saying spine chill makes ghostface useless is like saying small game makes trapper useless. It‚Äôs really easy to counter a killer when you know what killer you‚Äôre facing 100% of the time. There‚Äôs no new survivor or perks to try out, and everyone is testing ghostface. 
---
Easy counter, easy life.
---
The players who know how to play the game beat Freddy. 
---
However Freddy is the best killer in the game for lower rank players. 
---
You‚Äôll learn.
---
Where did i say Wraith was op? I mentioned he was annoying in a different post but that doesn‚Äôt apply to my suggestion/s
---
Yeah but when there is a lag spike? It's a bit shit of a mechanic
---
Because you were trying to suggest crazy nerfs to him?
---
True, but that's not really on the mechanic it's on the internet connection
---
I'd be saltier than them; I lost my stack.
---
I think it's safe to assume they will tweak him first thing because I haven't seen a single person saying something positive about his power. It's just trash.
---
psst i know who you are hail sithis
---
"just don't get hit lol"
---
No. His power can work fine if they fix the bugs and make adjusments. Maybe not tying his stalk to the power and adding some immunity to dection perks. 
---
Just changing the numbers and his bugs will fix him.
---
killer queues are always bonkers on the ptb because the survivor population is so much smaller. Add in ranking/mm and it gets harder, but yea, everyone wants to try GF
---
Nope, you are a funny one
---
Do they even have QA testers?
---
(Feels like I‚Äôm explaining to a kid who keeps asking ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù as an fyi, No wonder it‚Äôs become more of a discussion), And Wraith? I mentioned I forgot his buff which would need the light nerf to balance it out. I mentioned it twice now, One is in this conversation if you read it....
---
Well, you better look up how to do that step by step, oh and it's only for PC and when you have a Nvidia GPU
---
What exactly are you having problems with regarding Freddy? I've never really played much survivor, but he's one of my most played killers, so maybe I could help with something.
---
You must be a survivor main
---
I like that, someone show BHVR
---
no, if they look in your general direction you cant stalk, as far as i can tell walls dont even matter.
---
That was the intent of it acaullty. Its just  bugged right now.
---
But how are you supposed to focus in the game, looking that good?
---
That doesn't make up for it.
---
Ash always gets hatch for me
---
I hear some people saying it's issues about bugs, and that the Spirit was trash too, but considering the Dev build, we know there's been considerable amounts of time and effort put into Ghostface. And I'll give that to BHVR: I'm still happy we even have Ghostface, and I'm appreciative of all the time and effort the team put into him. But either the balance team went on lunch break, or the QA team did. So now Ghostface has the unanimous verdict of garbage, even if its not their fault.
---
I can't beat the shit outta you without getting closer
---
At least its the PTB and they can still change the killer, maybe BHVR can make him great
---
Why in the fuck is he called "The Ghost Face" it sounds dumb as fuck.
---
What are you referring to?
---
Um...she was buffed before release though? Also Legion is now much better. Ghost is also supper buggy and his power isnt working as its intended to.
---
Is probably cause the Davis has No Mither, and that perk counter Tier 3.
---
Why does the perk need any buff? Thought it was great already.
---

Well he is bugged and isnt even working as the devs intended so that defetinly doesnt help.
---
I'd move immunity to detection from "using the power" to crouching
---
I would need to look for them as well. But I Update this comment when I find them
---
Yea thats what i meant. Crouching in his power
---
I'd argue the rework was a net negative for a few reasons. 
---
For starters, now instead of any Survivior getting at least a chance to use it (for non obsessions you did have to wiggle) before they got on the hook, now all Surviviors were required to be hooked and only had a window of time to use it after being unhooked. Then I think this is a neglected piece of information but the rework was such a nerf that it needed buffed a patch later to fix the stun time. 
---
And as for this quote. 
---
&gt;It's certainly run more than it used to be.
---
Please cite your sources first of all. Second of all I think it's still used a lot bc it's still a quick escape off the killers shoulders, which is very good.
---
hatch is the survivors mori* but otherwise correct
---
playing a normal game against ghostface like
---
Nobody above rank 13 is using spine chill or premonition or ooo lol.
---
it's on the PTB
---
[i feel that](https://prntscr.com/nxousj)
---
I remember watching the Freddy spotlight and listening to the power.
---
"Freddy starts off in the dream world, unable to injure survivors but invisible to them. He can drag survivors into his world to attack them normally."
---
My first thought was
---
"...and? What's the power?"
---
Imagine if Ghost face was two weaker killers who both have to hit a surv once to down them. They could see each other's and the hit survivor's auras, and the survivor could be affected with broken for 60 seconds after the hit, so that the second killer had a decent window of time.
---
Myers takes 5 seconds for each tier increase (without add ons), so no it's not so much faster, it's only 1 second faster
---
Seems so.
---
Just make it so you can‚Äôt use his power in a chase
---
His perks are honestly so bad. They literally only work against Rank 20s. This Killer seems to be designed purely to be the new Freddy after Freddy gets reworked: his power only works against Rank 20s and his perks only work against Rank 20s.
---
I'm All Ears is a fucking meme that only works against that one Big Brain Meg Main who fast vaults everything with Quick and Quiet. Why the fuck doesn't it reveal people who fast vault while in your Terror Radius / in a chase? It has a cooldown specifically to stop that interaction from being too OP. Revealing people who vault for 6 seconds would have interesting interactions and would make for a strong counter to Quick and Quiet / Dance With Me but currently it's worthless.
---
Furtive Chase is a fucking worthless meme. Why would you need a reduced terror radius while in a chase? Literally what Killer cares about their Terror Radius while in a chase? The literal only use I see for the perk is if you're playing EW2 Mirror Myers, and even then you're still better off running M&amp;A instead. Why can't it just remove the Terror Radius in general? It would make for a really interesting gameplay loop to swap between targets in order to be more stealthy but currently it's just a joke. I guess they're too scared of the interactions with M&amp;A? Well then just make it so the perk doesn't stack with M&amp;A or something jeeze...
---
Thrilling Tremors is the literal only good perk he has and it's a worse Barbeque with a cool-down. There's maybe like 5 Killers I'd run this on |(Trapper is my main pick because any form of stall is good for him. Billy, Spirit, and Nurse are also decent with it because they're god tier with BBQ, but the problem is that they down people before the 60 second cool-down is up. This perk is maybe good on Myers and Ghostface but you're better off with Surveillance instead. Doctor can also use it since he's generally good with BBQ, and Wraith / Legion can use their mobility to get value out of it maybe. - Basically I'd use it on Trapper, Doctor, Wraith, and Legion)| and even then Discordance, Surveillance, Corrupt Intervention, Overcharge, or just plain old Ruin are better for game stall. And BBQ and Whispers are both better for tracking.
---
Ghostface needs serious buffs and his perks need buffs if not flat out reworks. They all have the potential to be good but Behavior is too scared of making good perks or good Killers. And then they wonder why everyone at high ranks play Billy and Nurse and why every build at high ranks is some combination of Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy, Nurse's, NOED, and anti-pallet perks.
---
Idk what you‚Äôre talking about man, having to point you character in his direction is going to be way better. Makes it easy to stalk people who are preoccupied. That‚Äôs the only problem with him, everything else is fine it‚Äôs just the instant loss of his power by such a simple means
---
This why they do a ptb.. geez they'll fix him.. calm your tits.
---
It's longer than that speaking from SWF experience. It's about the same as Myers.
---
but you need to do the same thing in order to benefit from them
---
His power is gonna be convincing the survivors to join his cause and kill the entity to take the benefits of it's life insurance.
---
what do you think the PTB functions for genius
---
The entity must have someone at F tier, ghostface wax the sacrifice so Freddy could live a normal life with the D-S tier killers
---
Y'know, I'm *more than probably* a little biased toward the whole Carl thing, but I must say I find it all very hilarious. 
---
Maybe with 2k upvotes ( and more? ) BHVR will think about adding "thicc and juicy" boi to the game at some point. If all they need is some kind of legal rights, they probably know who and where to ask after all *\*wink wink, devs, wink wink.\**
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked at all if the only internal testing they did at all was for compliance. Between this and the Pig nerf it feels like they just write things down, put them in the game, and wait until the PTB to see how they work.
---
I ran into a team that had one mamajamma sequentially move from gen to gen and intentionally miss skill checks while the other 3 worked on the opposite side of the map. Once I realized it and adjusted I was able to 3k them but was super frustrating and confusing at the start of the game when I got sequential skill check fails. I thought I hit the jackpot but then gens started to pop haha
---
And I didn't remove their names because they can fuck off if they DC like that
---
a singular survivor where that survivor's entire team can counter his ability by 360ing
---
[source](https://gyazo.com/a966c19654c95c68fb9ed6e09a49015a)
---
yeah fair enough
---
It takes him 4 seconds for him to mark someone as exposed and during these times he'd still be able to stalk and mark someone.
---
The funniest part is that Ghostface's lore is literally the exact opposite of this. He's supposed to be an extremely arrogant and narcissistic Killer who literally only gets found out because of how flashy he is and how much popularity he wants.
---
Talk about ludonarrative dissonance.
---
I think that could be considered cheating though
---
So survivors who got pips and didn't do gens get easier pips, and survivors who just do gens still don't get pips?
---
Feng genuinely looks happy and like she‚Äôs having a good time
---
&gt;now shes good
---
(Laughs in Prayer Beads)
---
&gt; So survivors have to pretty much ditch everyone else in the match at ANY POINT once the end game starts to escape?
---
Yes, your own survival should come first &amp; foremost and be the highest priority.
---
&gt;So let‚Äôs pretty much remove the chance of getting and iridescent or gold in altruism because they shouldn‚Äôt save others when the end game starts?
---
You get 1:30 with max-rank Blood Warden, that's plenty of time to save someone off hook or get a protection hit in.
---
&gt;You literally can‚Äôt save in the end game because you never know if the killer is running blood warden?
---
I mean, yeah? Its like how people bitch about NOED, then downvote someone when they say to cleanse totems. You're at a natural disadvantage and that's the risk you take. Simple as that.
---
&gt;So we can‚Äôt save anymore we need to open the gate and ditch?
---
See above.
---
**top 10 shitposts of all time**
---
Not really? The core concept of a Killer who can slow Survivors down at loops is fine. It's a very simple concept that fits this game very well. The problem is that 15% is nothing and there are many safe loops where 15% slow doesn't help you at all.
---
There are other issues as well (throwing Clown's 2 second 15% slow will slow Clown down by 15% for 2 seconds) but the main issue is the design of several loop objects.
---
Im just saying that people think teaming is some sort of ‚Äúgodly tactic‚Äù when in reality I end up getting the same (and sometimes better results) playing solo as compared to playing with teams. 
---
And I am at about rank 8 and a majority of games I have are pretty lengthy and close when I play with randoms as compared to teams where we get our shit rocked even with our mad communication and team work, it normally will only be a close game 2/10 times
---
Well then maybe those languages need to up their wordcount. &gt;:(
---
Then use The Shadow 
---
it fits as well
---
Yeah, it's honestly a pretty gamebreaking bug. I get that this is PTB, but this should be something that gets ironed out in the earliest stages of character development. And if it's a bug that's that hard to get rid of, or it keeps coming back, they need to rebuild the power from the ground up because it'll break every patch
---
They probably didn't want to risk being associated with the movie. (Also why simple formula became thrilling tremors)
---
OoO literally cancels his power if his aura is revealed to the surv.  
---
He can be 72 metres away and lose his power if a surv uses OoO
---
Spine Chill is not activated when Tier 1 Michael, the stealthiest tier, looks at you. Meanwhile, Ghostface, a killer meant to do a very similar job to Myers, activates spine chill
---
Me too, if I see a key i switch to clown with a red Mori, anyone who touches the key die.
---
Spirit was absolutely terrible on release. That's why they do PTBs. Spirit went from Bottom tier to Top 3 very quickly. Keep the faith.
---
Ghostface literally only works against Rank 20s. I was dicking around in KYF and every time the Killer went into stealth I'd jokingly say "Oh no the Killer is stealthed! Let me just do this gen and not look behind me like a Rank 20!"
---
Not a substitution for QA moron.

Main post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bwuxzx/leaked\_sounds\_dont\_match\_ghostface\_pinhead/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bwuxzx/leaked_sounds_dont_match_ghostface_pinhead/)
---
What ticks me off is that Myers proves that there's already an in-game counter to "stalking" Killers; it's called "running the fuck away and hiding behind a tree." I don't know why Ghostface has to have more "counters" when his stalk already goes down if he loses sight of a Survivor.
---
Billy is the bar for balance tbh
---
I can't dead hard you without getting closer
---
You can hold the game hostage by doing that and afking
---
You say that like its the only problem with him
---
He's on the PTB. His negatives are mostly bugs. He'll be fine.
---
&gt;OoO literally cancels his power if his aura is revealed to the surv.
---
You don't need OoO to do this. He is bugged. Stop judging his power off bugs.
---
&gt;Spine Chill is not activated when Tier 1 Michael, the stealthiest tier, looks at you. Meanwhile, Ghostface, a killer meant to do a very similar job to Myers, activates spine chill
---
But it does activate when Myers' stalk is dangerous to you, I.E. he is building exposed on you
---
Freddy is known as a "noob stomper" for a reason. New players have no idea how to counter him (and that's why he got nerfed in the first place), while experienced players destroy him with altruism and coordination.
---
Hell yeah! I know you got this! Huntress is so satisfying when you hit those long distance throws
---
It‚Äôs bugged. A survivor should be able to actually see ghost face instead of just spinning their camera in a circle. Even without the bug he‚Äôs still pretty weak

‚ÄúRevolutionized‚Äù implies that horror studios learned from Scream, but they didn‚Äôt and we still mostly get garbage horror with the same cliches and a few new ones. Scream was really solidly put together though, held up against most slashers around and before it‚Äôs time it makes them look like a joke. Characters feel somewhat relatable and the killers ‚Äúpowers‚Äù (being in 2 places at once) end up being explained rationally in a way that enhances the story instead of a half assed cop out that doesn‚Äôt make sense, or just not explaining them at all.
---
You know he's bugged, right? Players can spot him through walls and end his power earlier than they should, it's a bug.
---
Things on the PTB are subject to massive change, as well as bugs. Which is why they're put on the PTB first. 
---
Why does everyone just assume he's meant to be like that?
---
the entire reason i refuse to cleanse hexes before  a confirmed effect
---
It's exceptionally stupid that a perfect information perk is given to the side that isn't *supposed* to be played on voice chat but is.
---
So then they synergize
---
What happens if SWF though?
---
It's not but it's just another nail in his coffin. If you can't stalk survivors through the corn, survivors shouldn't be able to detect you through it either.
---
No? They literally have no correlation with one another.
---
I am, because Spirit is great now.
---
Well done. Take my upwote sir.
---
It's really dumb.
---
Calm yours and think, why wouldn't they have these issues fixed before the PTB even launched? The devs sorta have their own PTB, the Dev build, which has dedicated playtesters and QA members on it. And somehow, someway, we still got Ghostface.
---
How is he bugged?
---
Myers saids hi too. He gets fucked by corn too. Almost every killer does because  corn is dumb. It might work that way though its just bugged like his entire power
---
Power to Thicc people.
---
That all sounds pretty nice.
---
Maybe aesthetically, yeah. Gameplay wise, Legion works better. Though GF is bugged right now so hopefully he's fixed up soon
---
With most games I play, regardless of who I team up with, it's ALWAYS more successful with randoms than with friends. Maybe it's me that's the problem? LOL! Who knows, but I have your same experience.
---
&gt;I mean pallets are one thing survivors SHOULD feel safe at.
---
Wrong. Survivors should never feel 100% safe anywhere. The devs have even said this. 
---
&gt; So I think removing killers being able to hit a survivor through a pallet when getting stunned is the way it's SUPPOSED to be. No more killers getting a hit they didn't deserve. And no more survivors getting downed even tho they successfully stunned a killer.
---
If you mistimed it to where the killer can get a hit on you even though you're throwing the pallet down, you mistimed it and deserve the trade of getting hit and the killer gets stunned.
---
He's gotta be talking about MoM using safe unhooks and protection hits in the ptb
---
I agree. We need to at least wait until they fix his bugs then it will be easier to judge him.
---
&gt;pallets are supposed to be safe
---
Since when? Pallets are supposed to be tools to help the survivors to survive, but not infallible. Survivors aren't meant to feel 100% safe anywhere.
---
&gt;so naturally i saw the leaked ability of ghost face and IMMEDIATELY put in the money to steam so i can buy him day 1
---
Sounds like you have a problem with preordering that you need to fix asap.
---
Well for one thing, survivors that 360 camara isnt supposed to take him out of the power. Survivors are supposed to face him with their player character, not the camara. 
---
This isnt confirmed but im pretty sure things liek downed and hooked survivors stopping it is also a bug.
---
The 360¬∞ spin that spots him is a bug, as well as being seen through obstacles. Does nobody know it's a bug and this is why things are put on the PTB first? To spot and squash stuff like this?
---
I said update, not rework
---
Ssh only killers are allowed to have insta down perks! Survivors should never have sec chance perks! 
---
*goes on to play easy make your choice spirit match*
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It also now works on any hit, meaning it can counter insta downs like Myers EW3 or Noed.
---
Np
---
easy, there are loading tips for your few first times vs each killer.
---
having one of those hints be "The ghost face can remove his terror radius and stalk survivors. Using the point emote towards the ghost face will cancels this power" should be reasonable.
---
I didnt check out, my day was busy
---
If you don't want to read that i can summarize it for you: I am a salty survivor who want to nerf 5 (Freddy is gettting a rework already and i am not sure if i understand Michael's change) killers cause i am bad in the game.
---
lmaoo
---
That's not what you asked. They said it wasnt intentional.
---
for both perks you gain a stack everytime you take a hit to protect a survivor or make a safe rescue
---
It's a cool idea, however, its not apparent that you would have to point at him. What i mean by that is think of piggy, her box locations only light up when she puts a helmet on a survivor, making it pretty damn apparent what you have to do. Or doctor, who wont let you do any actions, but will instead make you snap out of it.
---
what do more bloodpoints have to do with tanking a hit? you pick them for the effect, not for the way they get to work
---
They buffed freddy, so they obviously had to make a new worst killer, duh.
---
I'm kind of tempted to buy one as a pregnancy pillow. May as well enjoy it.
---
Yeah idk why killers think basement is supposed to a free kill zone. It should be a harder area to get out of but not a free kill area.
---
Context to this tweet was that someone was asking if the Freddy rework was on the current PTB.
---
Well, just a reason to dc on corn, as i did it before on any short killer/shape/nurse
---
i wasn't talking about the effect, i'm talking about having to do literally the same shit to benefit from the perks
---
You'll probably find out shortly
---
It's still in testing, hopefully they'll fix it b4 live
---
The new Freddy
---
IMO even if he is bugged I think it still needs to be the survivor has to turn the character model towards you but that may just be me
---
For MoM you gain a stack if you take a hit in any situation. Doesn't have to be from a protection. And also you don't gain a stack for MoM from a safe hook rescue.
---
Rn he has to wait 7 secs to hit someone, his counter is self care, u can loop him for ages, overcharge sucks for him, poor map control, want me to continuous?
---
Lmaoo you‚Äôll probably be fine just don‚Äôt make it a habit
---
Are those not mostly bugs that they are working on, hence the ptb so the bugs are ironed out.
---
Yeah, and that sucks, but that's also not her primary power. Ghostface's entire power revolves around stealth, so it's a HARD counter.
---
But we already got the torches and pitchforks
---
its a thing that is countered by the thing its supposed to counter...
---
Pretty sure it's handled locally, like skill checks.  So both independent of lags, and potentially exploitable.
---
That is the intended effect
---
I only show mercy if they message me asking for help with 'Where Did They Go?' Otherwise the key is mine!
---
I do the same with Trapper, once those items drop they gettin' trapped. Chests too.
---
i forgot to mention that i'm talking about the new MoM
---
can someone explain why people want to save 1,000,000bp? I'm confused
---
Even without the space, The Ghostface is such a werid name compared to other kills. Why didnt they kept his leak name of just: The Ghost.
---
It's Max bp
---
It was just The Ghost on the leak so idk why they changed it
---
Y'all be playing like a normal killer, running up to a pallet then crouching and staring at someone like we don't know you're there lmao
---
PLAY STEALTHY.  change how you act before you pick up a guy for 2 matches across 2 hours and scream that he's bad because you don't know how to play him yet. 
---
People still scream that the Plague is bad but I regularly get 2-3 kills at least with her :/
---
What‚Äôs so special about this?
---
One way is to combine them using a photo editing tool and then post that picture here.
---
You need to blur names out
---
Shit I hope so
---
Seeing the pig crouch doesn't completely negate her traps or her dash. If Ghostface's spotted, it completely gets rid of his entire power.
---
Nope from what they said the bug is that people are getting him out of stalk to fast they never said your supposed to point your character at him the bug is your not supposed to be able to just spin your camera around like a top and knock him out of stealth
---
I hardly ever play killer so I‚Äôm always between rank 20‚Äì17, but boy do I love running Wraith with a silent bell and the 6 seconds of heartbeat suppression. Nabbing rank 20‚Äôs off gens all match is so much fun! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Can wait for a digital release
---
This.
---
The difference between GF and every other stealth Killer is that they have abilities outside of sneaking around. GF doesn't.
---
That guy is a known DDOS‚Äôer. He deserves to be blasted.
---
Mash tap it doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs just a useless annoying mechanic that adds nothing to the game.
---
It definitely depends on the group so there isn't a definitive situation. Some play for fun and are there for laughs/to hang out, some play to win at all costs.
---
Secretly... the reason why I prefer playing with randoms is that you don't have to hear "the killers on me" when in fact the killer is absolutely no where near the person who said that. That grinds my gears &gt;.&gt;
---
He did but it sounded more like he was having an asthma attack rather than grunting loudly.
---
This is the first nea is a killer joke to make me actually laugh omg
---
Jimmy Neutron = upvote
---
Can you be banned for griefing and sandbagging your team? Absolutely.
---
I hope bhvr makes quick work of this.
---
Yea that would defeat the purpose. My internet is still down because of him. I hope someone hacks him back and fucks up his while day TbH.
---
The last shroud I saw the game didnt even start bc some noob left the game closing the match bc 3v1 lol.
---
That is also true. But i think the intent is that your supposed to at least look at him generally and not use the camara, along with it being too fast. 
---
I might be wrong  but it would be werid otherwise
---
That is the best moment of Myers stalk. O.F. &lt;Scooby do run&gt;
---
Dont you even compare my Amanda to this garbage :3
---
Even if those versions are, the people who play in those consoles deserved to play DBD too.
---
This is accurate. It seems when ever I play during the middle of the day I get farmed
---
i wasnt talking about the one second thing, i was talking in general.  Also, i know that's not what i asked, never said it was.
---
Get this to front page
---
the question is "so basically MoM is a better version of WGLF?". tell me, what the fuck does that have to deal with it?
---
They either need to boost up the time it takes and make it so it‚Äôs a smaller cone like area you have to look at him in OR make it so you have to turn your character towards him
---
They should go back to calling him The Ghost
---
theoretically two killers would break any existing mechanics for keeping the killer busy chasing.
---
Any loops? come from both sides of the loop. Once the first one gets a hit in, that first one can bodyblock for the second on any further loops.
---
I imagine the system will be similar to starting a chase as a killer
---
I am not going to say it, is such an old joke, just move along...fine...I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Gotta keep the meme value up!
---
That doesn't make any sense. You're asking for killer competency to use a crutch perk, so the killers who need it don't get it and the killers who get it don't need it.
---
It should just be an automatic fifth perk for killers who fail, so that they shouldn't just DC to depip faster, not that matchmaking works, and not be something you take in.
---
I think they did for a bit but people abused it
---
I run rancor bbq and chili noed and sloppy or monitor and abuse with decreased activate times and increased speed as power add ons
---
Seeing ghost face takes him out of his power and punishes him by draining the whole gauge. Pigs dash can still be used to counter some loops and her crouch can be used for mind games while he can't even hit while crouched (without killing his power gauge anyway)
---
Lol i'd be fine making noed a stack based system, 1 hook=2 hits with exposed up to the max number of hooks, of course if they did make it a stack based system then it wouldn't be a totem anymore and I am fairly certain that would make the survivor community implode. 
---
As is now if you really hate the perk then just break the totems before it reaches generators powered or afterwards. You have plenty of counter-play currently, MoM on the other-hand has 0 counter-play and is completely busted hence its change.
---
You sly dog, you almost got me
---
I use: ruin, bbq nurses and make your choice.
---
Seriously, WGLF and WMI need to be combined into one perk and have that addition. Speedy healing is equivalent to aura reading since the killer knows where you were hooked.
---
lol this makes me chuckle.
---
You're right about that. I just wish it were real somehow, because it'd be pretty cool. What if only one could break gens, but they had 110% movement speed, and the other couldn't break gens, but had 115% movement speed to make it perfectly balanced as all things should be? Maybe a mod to their abilities each?
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more with this
---
BBQ, Ruin, Stridor/Monitor, and Nurse's Calling.
---
a shame i can't change the title
---
Yes tools to survive which means it also makes the survivors feel somewhat feel safe, what's the point of a pallet if a killer can just hit through it especially after getting stunned?

---
more like he's taking a shit.
---
&gt; My whole point was saying these people didn't do their jobs.
---
because they fired them to let us pay them for the privilege to do the testing.
---
I think having the character forced to turn towards him and make it  be like 2-3 seconds would be good. Maybe a lower range to like 20 meters.
---
BBQ, Surveillance, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher you could throw in Discordance or Monitor and Abuse if you want insteam of Sloppy Butcher.
---
I can't remember the last camping Bubba that I
---
Well, doing gens on my own is hard. When Freddy is the killer, people go down pretty quickly (including me). How am I supposed to save them so we have a chance to win when whenever I‚Äôm near Freddy his song plays and I get sleepy? Then we have one or more guys down and I‚Äôm also down. Like how do you combat that, when failing skill checks is the only thing to do but you won‚Äôt always be able to fail one especially when you‚Äôre getting chased
---
I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs satire or not
---
So 360 and his power is gone lol
---
Then I don't understand your point. Once they fix the 360 thing, do you still think looking at him for a second makes his power useless?
---
I think they did sorta. a easy fix would be like the one person said if survivors are within a certain distance from the hook then the timer will go down as normal
---
All "NEW RELEASED KILLERS AND SURVIVORS" are free if you don't own the killer you can't test the new killer or survivor if it isn't from THAT patch. Because who needs to test killers they don't own on a PTB ammirite lads?
---
That's a nice plot twist to this post
---
I'd rather he be, "The Slasher" or something like that.
---
Sauce?
---
I accidentally found this out for survivor! I just happened to click and drag and was like apskxnxhygcekspagsg and then passed the info along to my team mates and blew their minds haha
---
You are not good if you need NOED your opinion is invalid.
---
This guy really thinks he‚Äôs the shit because he can DDOS people, I‚Äôve come into contact with him too. If only Sony banned this cunt.
---
How is it not, I never specified what percentage. U did
---
You I was asking why you felt the need to jump into a civil discussion and be hostile. We are literally just bickering. I'm not replying because it's unproductive to continue arguing with you.
---
I think the Clown wants to be rid of his sins. Everything has a message.  
---
Remember Christian folk, play Doom and kill demons for Jesus, Play DBD and uh tea bag killers for jesus? Does Jeff count? FOR JEFF!
---
Discordance, Monitor and Abuse, Surveillance, and Hex: Ruin.
---
The "percentage" is irrelevant.
---
I don't see why they don't.
---
If freddy doesnt look down when placeing his traps he can use them to force survivors to abandon loop without needing to guess like trapper and can also more reluably catch them inbetween loops. Its a big deal.
---
What do you mean, prayer beads are balanced.
---
It's a good tracking perk but the 60-second cooldown really harms its uses in my opinion. If it was reduced to 30 or 20 seconds then it wouldnt be too bad but 60 is taking it to far.
---
I am looking at the animation correctly. People are acting like they shouldn't be able to be hit anywhere in the pallet animation, despite if the pallet has actually hit the killer yet or not.
---
I suspect that since the leak they‚Äôve been advised to change certain things in order to not get in trouble with the holders of the Scream license.
---
oh yeah, i forgot about that. Thanks mate!
---
Grindy grind
---
How do I use a macro on Xbox?
---
If you see him while 360ing your **3rd person camera** then you can just focus on him and counter his ability by looking at him for the amount of time required, therefore, rendering his power unusable.
---
They still fixed spirit though. It took a while, yeah, but now she's top tier.
---
Yep. That's bannable. And extremely assholeish.
---
Franklin's tear gas
---
I mean that basically never happened before the change and even now end game collapse keeps you from being there too long.
---
I got called a shitty killer last night cuz I ran exhaustion add-ons on Huntress and sac'd a guy... he was running dead hard lmao
---
OP asked for people's spirit builds, so this dude commenting with his spirit build is of course valid.
---
Just cleanse totems then
---
SAMF Jeff, Dead Meat reference ?
---
r/suspiciouslyspecific
---
Mike manages to stalk players just fine already and he has to stalk longer than 4 fucking seconds. You're exaggerating...
---
Well if it does hit the killer obviously they shouldn't get hit, common sense. If it doesn't hit the killer then idc about that.
---
Not on the PTB they didn't.
---
Is his name actually Carl?
---
Give it a rest, babbys first gatekeeping.
---
Maybe not on the ptb, but it still happened.
---
No it's not, u said 100% guaranteed safe as I just said safe which could imply any percentage.
---
To be fair the perk will barely ever activate anyway so it's not like your losing anything for having such a massive cooldown.
---
Just Messing around
---
Hey Mom can I have **The Ghost**
---
No we have **The Ghost** at home
---
**The Ghost** at home: tHe GhOsT fAcE!
---
Eh, I mean I won't hardcore "camp".
---
I'll proxy around the two hooked survivors checking generators and seeing if I can catch a third survivor trying to hide nearby for the survive, then I'll start wandering in wider circles - I might rush to a far generator and check, then pop back over to the 30\~ meters around the hooks.
---
They'll pop one of the survivors off the hooks and if I see it happen, I'll go chase. If I don't see it happen, I'll slide over to the other hook and see if the rescuer is going for a double-unhook.
---
If they're not, I'll probably go back in the direction of the first unhook and see where they ran.
---
But I'll not actually camp to the point where it's absolutely impossible to unhook them or I'm not doing anything besides camping.
---
That would be why I tagged it as salty
---
BBQ for the points, Ruin, Haunted Grounds and then rotate between Stridor, Discordance, Surveillance.
---
Ghostface: "time to stealth"  
---
\*Loud ass noise notification indicating he has entered stealth\*
---
I'd love a link to where anyone said this. People keep reporting this as the intended mechanic, but I haven't been able to find any communication from BHVR or anyone affiliated with them that even implies this.
---
They‚Äôre not gonna release ghostface as is because he‚Äôs BUGGED
---
Well, people should learn. Else, all survivors first view, which would be undisputedly a good idea for the game, but hated by the survivors mains
---
how many killers can down a survivor every 20 seconds?
---
You're just arguing semantics now. I'm done here.
---
And yes, I'm aware of the standard "get gud" response.
---
I'm just at a loss how all 5 gens we're done within minutes of the match beginning.
---
That's what pisses me off about Ghostface. Myers already proves there's a counter to stalking Killers: it's called *running the fuck away and hiding behind a tree.* If Ghostface just moved at 110% (or even 100%) while using his power then there would be a tangible downside to make him stop using it. But instead he has to have his power canceled by a light breeze.
---
Camera on both sides of the phone bud
---
You absolutely can.  A streamer was banned for it.

This is the best i can find on it.
