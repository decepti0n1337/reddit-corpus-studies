Same. I've witnessed a shit ton of mories go down.
---
---
---
Good.
---
Is it red at all 3 levels?
---
No one knows...some say it's to maximize points..some say it's out of fear..
---
Yea I gotta say no add ons puts wraith in a very very tough position. He also absolutely needs spirit fury and enduring to be good as well. Otherwise... yeah it’s gonna be a bad time lol
---
I think it's moreso with the devs/mods than it is anticheat. If you aren't lucky and they see you using it, you're out, but people also have reports of popular Twitch DBD streamers using them without problem.
---
"and do nothing arbitrarily" But there's other stuff to do, like totems, chests, etc.
---
Cant find this in Civ
---
So is there a place to find these mods? I am just tired of the look of all the perks and items and want to make it a little nicer and some of the work that these people put into mods are really well done.
---
It smelled like killer propaganda from the get go. Self care is still a great perk that comes in a pinch.
---
Plank lol, seriously though what about Salty Sam? Hes very capable of being a killer, anyone remember this scene? 
---

i think it's monto who used that name for some videos
---
New player here, why not cleanse when uninjured?
---
I don’t want to farm though that’s so boring. After a long day of work I just want to play...
---
You favorite?
---
Add-ons are what make it impossible to balance.
---
She not op but dawg she’s top tier her lunge is killer. I main her and feel that more often than not I’m getting hits I shouldn’t.
---
I feel like this sub is an elite training ground for memeologists, toppest quality shit comes from here.
---
Not even gonna bother to reply the "insert basic joke about baby killers" comments lol if you don't do these things I mentioned, you're pretty much okay. It is my personal opinion that body blocking is stupid, and thats it. The "Salt / Rant" flair means I'm complaining about something I find stupid, and I couldn't care less if a bunch of Claudette only mains think its funny lol
---
It's fine to rant about Nurse being OP, but when people talk about survivor shit, its suddenly a big tabboo, gets downvoted to oblivion? Funny how this sub works lol anyway, tks for the replies anyway, stay safe u guys.
---
Hag cant get looped. She slows the game to a crawl because you have to crouch everywhere and if you get chased you’re screwed because she has every good area trapped.
---
Mess with the planko you get the shanko
---
Tbh Idk where. I'm a PS4 player. I can't even get customizable shit. :(
---
Idk man some of them are completely clueless, especially the newer survivors. I’d say if you plan on being nice, do it with the expectation you won’t receive gratitude.
---
And bloodpoints
---
*bing, bong*
---
You did well at baiting.
---
You have 99 of them.
---
Couldn’t help but die laughing that whole time oh my. It’s the buff to Distressing that we’ve all wanted for so long. I’m CRYING
---
I agree but I don’t blame them. Any time they have these type of events, just expect this type of shit from everyone.
---
I’ve easily cleared 400k just goofing off with Myers. Those Vanity Mirrors really pay off.
---
Coms don't make shitty survivors any better at the game.  Undeniable advantage for good players on a swf.  But most are just friends playing with each other.  Very few depip squads out there in comparison.
---
Oh that's understandable
---
[removed]
---
Shaq is absolutely a generational talent and one of the all time greats but I wouldn't consider him synonymous with god.
---
Oh god. That would actually make me scared for once in this game.
---
her lunge is the same as others
---
The Spirit is the best and most fun DLC killer.
---
I hope so. I have been anticipating the rework for so long as a Freddy main. to be honest i am a little scared of what they will do to him, because base Freddy is garbage, with the right addons, Freddy is actually quite fun to play, and you saw how to legion rework went.
---
So you're dragging him? Especially if hes not good at the game?
---
if he held the cube and chains with fish hooks shot out and chased survivor up to a certain distance and injured healthy survivors or snagged injured survivors and dragged them back to him would be cool :)
---
I don't understand why this was downvoted, i found it quite hilarious.
---
Oh no worries. I'm sure a million posts like this would get annoying quick. Thanks for letting me know about the community tab!
---
Nice now i can tunnel my friends in real life
---
You can still Dead Hard when Broken, can't you? It would require good timing/knowledge of her power, but it's possible, I think...
---
Correct me if I'm wrong there, been a while since I've played against any Plagues with DH equipped. 
---
Also, would you consider a survivor getting pinned in a corner by Hillbilly the same kind of play? Should I let every survivor who runs themselves into a pinnable corner back into the chase every time?
---
If anything, I would stay away from Legion until the developers decide what to do with him,. Other than that, the developer made killers and survivors are fun to play as, and against. Pick whichever one sounds fun to play as!
---
bollocks. as survivor rank potato 15 i get matches instantly and rank spread is all over the place sometimes i get yellow fellows sometimes mix between babies (20-16) and yellows and about every 3rd match i get fucking purple/greens/reds. while when i queue in green rank as killer i wait like a fucktard for couple of mins up to 10 even to get a match and most often i get reds and purples with one baby or smth like that - the matchmaking change was implemented and then reverted by the way (cuz it sucked donkey tities) :P
---
Literally.
---
My point
---
Matchmaking is very hard to get right
---
Well, yeah it's a bug. I'm just thinking,  this is BHVR.
---
Oh yes
---
How are you gonna coo that raw meat though?
---
I am a Freddy main for the most part, and Freddy really is not good a camping or tunneling. Freddy excels in splitting aggro, and hit and run tactics. Because of how easy it is to find someone in the dream world, you will frequently drop chases only to start them 15 seconds later. Your goal as Freddy is to have as much information as possible and sneak up on survivors trying to wake up. A good Freddy main will tell you that with a yellow and brown addon Freddy is a very decent killer, that absolutely does not camp and rarely tunnels. Still, good post.
---
Here's a very good post about it for your homework
---
http://joostdevblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/why-good-matchmaking-requires-enormous.html?m=1
---
You two should stop arguing about stupid shit and do something useful like jerk each other off.
---
Oh brother, not this guy again
---
Though I agree I played for an hour earlier and all but 1 of my matches had DCs. So when that happens I’m cool with the killer farming with me cause like we would probably have lost anyway thanks to DCs.
---
Tbh, I've had mostly good luck today. A lot of killers who were a bit sweatier than I would be, but if that's how they have fun, fine by me.
---
That said? I just died in a match vs a Myers who slugged 3 people, let the other pick us all up, repeat. 3 of us have bled out, waiting right now to see if the last guy gets hatch or not. I'm not optimistic. (No, none of us had DS. There were no Obsession perks at all.) ETA: He did get hatch! &amp; also, I stood literally right in front of a hook and pointed at it for this Myers to just hook me &amp; he shook his head no. Sigh.
---
So play survivor. I main killer, but I noticed that queues are awfully long right now, so I play survivor. For survivor it takes me well over 5 minutes to find one match but with the event, I find instant lobbies. Just switch it up a bit.
---
Killers CAN benifit from camping, because most of the time survivors just kill themselves to find a better game, or the other survivors crouch around the hook waiting for an opportunity to save that will not come.
---
on the contrary if the survivor hangs in there till they die (despite getting literally nothing for it) and the survivors do gens killer can get pretty boned in the long run
---
Just buy the DLC with money. Those shards aren’t fun to farm. Use them for teachable perks.
---
The threat of death is something YOU provide by doing your job as killer. You are not entitled to it. You have to earn it by killing, injuring, and scaring the survivors. What you're saying is that you want to walk around as a killer and have people afraid that you could kill them at any time. I'm sorry, that's your misconception of how the game is.
---
It seems that you've had some bad experiences with this very specific situation. We all run in to situations that bug us. It doesn't mean they are game breaking.
---
Freddy or doctor 
---
Bbq,thrill of the hunt and distressing for doc 
---
Bbq and toth for Freddy
---
This subreddit is full of victimized killer mains though.
---
Everyone want to play killer, because they get more points and survivors who are left are fucking potatoes
---
That’s a thicc hag
---
What's LF?
---
Wow, swf makes up half of all players? That's crazy, it's really time to move it out of ranked.
---
I don't know if it's just for the one game I played earlier but lockers are possible broke on PS4 as you can't leave them once entered.

Whilst EAC and BHVR do not ban for the use of these custom perks yet, it is still altering the icon files and there is always the chance later on that EAC might detect this as an exploit and ban you. BHVR have made it very clear while these custom perks are not bannable, if EAC bans you for them, the Dead by Daylight customer support will not help you. In the very unlikely chance that EAC do eventually ban for it, you may be able to appeal to them directly.
---
I kinda like when people take forever, I turned a 2k deviousness on Billy (we were in The Game) into an 8k cause they just there for twenty minutes while I dashed back and forth.
---
When a Billy sees a pallet drop in front of them. They stop, rev up the full chainsaw and use it to break the pallet, then laugh that they didn't get stunned by the survivor they aren't in a chase with any more.
---
Those graphs do not display yellow or brown ranks. 
---
Ruin is not mandatory, but everybody sure loves it
---
What a poet :)
---
Lil peep huh i see you’re also a man of culture
---
Sigh like weve said before its not reflective of matchmaking.
---
Because these are averages and half the time someone dcs or doesnt connect. On top of that. That doesnt mean there isnt 2-2  swf or 3 to 1 or 2-1-1
---
Swf lobbies on average are around 50-70 percent.
---
Pretty much the only time I decide to farm as killer it’s cause of early game DC’s
---

---
This shouldnt be a place to promote your videos.

IF THE KILLER IS TUNNELING, DONT TAKE OTHERS OFF THE HOOK

Thank you so much :)
---
Thanks :)
---
Thanks for the feedback, hope you enjoy them if you end up using them :)
---
Play survivor then, that's what I did, you should find instant lobbies. You people need to learn how to solve problems on your own.
---
I added the template to my dropbox link, you can simply just colour replace the background with the one you want and there you have it. :)  
---
EDIT: Colour replacement tool on Photoshop, if you have it.

The Trashman killer
---
Throws trash everywhere and sometimes accidentally nicks a survivors artery
---
My best guess is that it would be community made skins that are chosen by the devs or voted on by the community that get implemented. If they let any skin get in then it'd probably kill their current business model for cosmetics.
---
Wait it out or bait the Hit before broken.
---
Everyone should just play Nurse in response, have him DC every game.
---
You gotta be a cool kid to get the reference :p
---
“I got tunneled!” No, you got caught three times in a row. Either your teammate rescued you while you were still in my terror radius or you ran out into the open. Probably both. In the first case, blame your teammate, not me. In the second case, learn to hide. I mean you of all people should know what direction the Killer was going after they hooked you.

It'S a LeGiTiMaTe StRaTeGy

Aight.  And how do I change them?  I’d like to use these.  They look amazing
---
People say these kinds of things and then go I DONT WANT STUPID FORTNITE EMOTES AND STUFF. Because its cool to bag on fortnite.
---
Saying its not cool to fuck with the "dark theme"
---
Then go around saying GROOVYYYY NEED SHIRTLESS MYERS NEED SHIRTLESS DAVID BODY PILLOW. NEED NEON BRIGHT SHIRTLESS AND PANTSLESS SURVIVOR COSMETICS WITH LEOPARD PRINT PANTS.
---
the internet is a strange place.
---
Thanks im on mobile so, yeh.
---
If you check out /u/NRocky, he has started making killer specific perks that I think you would enjoy. He's also responsible for this amazing design. :)
---
Well they have a team dedicated to making cosmetics so it wouldn't change anything. And regardless of whether they do or don't have a team for that, it still frees up their time because they won't have to make as many skins to get a moderate amount implemented every few weeks.
---
Do it.
---
What?
---
thats exactly like it always should be. Thats the whole point of being nice
---
Thanks and funny enough my daily is to do two sac with the doc
---
I've seen a lot of people complaining about the grind so I'm thinking that the devs might change it to be easier. If they do that, perhaps they could re-introduce legacy skins because it's practically the same situation: too much grind, change progression system, compensate people who have prestiged their characters already
---
I get him in my lobbies all the time on both killer and survivor side. There are definitely tons of matches he doesn't put in his videos. Friend ran him when he was doing his hag build for the whole match.
---
I only lost because the survivors won
---
2 mouth breathing insidious Bubbas in a row. For me.
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
You should be mad at the devs for making the rank system so cancerous
---
I had a killer earlier whose profile included "&lt;3" &amp; then a person's name.
---
Someone with that name was one of my fellow survivors.
---
Guess which one of us didn't die?
---
Purposeful dcs. If an accident happens a bận Is too harsh.
---
damn thats tough
---
Of ocourse but the devs can tell the difference.
---
Play a salty survivor. Jk
---
Don't need to run for long, just to the exit gate.
---
The Plague is also dependent on survivor behavior. At high ranks, survivors are smart enough to know not to cleanse their sickness making the Plague a basic M1 killer for most of the game.
---
This. I dc’d once because I did a generator just fine. 
---
But after that first gen, I stopped getting the skillcheck visual. Still get the sound, and the gen would blow up. Couldn’t really do shit
---
Quitter bonus: 4k bp, dc = unable to join lobby for 15 minutes.
---
Ugh I hate that shit. Just play the damn game. If I by chance match up with someone I know (I make a number of friends bc I normally use a survivor as a play thing if I give them too hard of a time and if they play along I’ll let them live) I don’t try do that shit. I play the game normally and if I get matched with them we play the game and I do what I would’ve done regardless of if they were there or not. Selling everybody out and not being punished bc you know the killer is so annoying
---
"I know you're happy with what you got, but I got more cause I'm better"

Evidence is against you there is no disagreeing you're wrong.

I Stan this idea! ☺️✨

:)
---
Wow, you’re an unbelievable obnoxious moron and are not clever in any way whatsoever.
---
Kind of giving other rodents a bad name
---
Plank's gone mad!
---
Do you think you'll make it in time...
---
That's like saying hate the government for setting the rules, not the people who abuse them to hurt other people for their own gain. Poor argument. Not convinced. At the very very least, you'd hate both parties. And one who points the finger above them is often one of the guilty. Just saying.
---
Christmas all over
---
Probably a region thing then
---
False, the devs in the past have said they don't care if you modify files that don't give an in game advantage, however if anticheat bans you, they won't lift the ban
---
&gt; Not from my experience. Most players at low rank are pretty bad. Survivors and killers both. So it is a toss up usually between who sucks more.
---
But...the Survival Rate graphic clearly shows that there is a 35% survival rate at Rank 20, vs a 75% survival rate at Rank 1.
---
Nah fam
---
But it’s mostly on console
---
Emotes would be nice. The meyers head tilt and some kind of dance or shoulder shrug wouldn't ruin the game.
---
Your flair is my name and I have a wedding to attend on Saturday as well, AND this is my first double BP event. Like what does this mean ?!?!?!? Jokes aside I’m bummed out. I’ll be busy all day today and won’t have free time until literally Monday. God damn it.
---
Seems like the most reliable solution. 
---
Start with five minute bans. Gives you a nice, “Hey, you seem to be having connection issues. Let’s wait a while before you try to play again.” If you get 4-5 of those in a 24 hour period it bumps up to 30 minutes. Get three to four of those and we go to two hours. Too many of those in a week and we bump up to six hours. Get a bunch of those in a month and we go to twenty four hour bans. At that point your account is officially flagged and if you get too many you’re done with DBD. 
---
That’s the stick, though. There should also be a carrot. Smite does something where each consecutive match you complete without dropping gives you “goodwill” or something similar. Higher good will gives a bonus to in-game currency. I’d like to see them do something similar in DBD with blood points.
---
The stats don't say anything about how good a perk is. Only how many people use it. Correlation, not causation.
---
This needs a Hex: Haunted Grounds, but yeah idk where to put it...
---
OMG OMG OMG I HEAR THE HEARTBEAT 😫 OMG THIS IS SO SCARY OMG THE KILLER COME COME 😫
---
Literally unnecessary response for a simple question.
---
&gt;That's like saying hate the government for setting the rules.
---
Not even close to the same.
---
If pipping was illegal in DbD, then you'd have a point, but its not, so you dont.
---
If the government made stealing perfectly legal, then yes, hate the government, not the thief.
---
I stand by what i said
---
Exactly. If I'm in my boyfriend's lobby (he plays killer far more than I do,) he treats me exactly the same as he would anyone else, because we're not assholes and the game's not that serious.
---
Mr. Speaker, we are for the big.
---
Yessss
---
Wait, does Mettle of Man beat NOED? I've never tried it.
---
No if you internet sucks the game isnt fun. Its 2019 we expect people to have good internet. I also think he means a ban timer like 30 min.
---
You did.
---
Blurry this place is a factory of sadness. Why are you here!
---
Knew it was Ephemeral Rift before I saw the name
---
What they do in the bedroom is no concern of yours
---
They made decisive strike useless when they nerfed it.
---
No, seriously: use Small Game until you learn all the spawn placements.
---
The streamers said God Pallet is the most important thing in the game. I stopped playing so i don't waste them.
---
do more please
---
Jane as a killer
---
Fair, I'm a Doctor junkie.
---
As a Russian, I can't really agree. I'm sure you've played with many Russians who weren't using cyrillic characters for their names. There is a certain type of Russian that is a complete shithead troll, but they exist in every culture, It'd be nice to not lumped in with that.
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
It's a small community but we already got a good share of custom perks if you wanna check them out
---
It's so weird seeing her from this angle due to her having no chin.
---
Damn bro that's awesome, I got 100k with a scratched mirror Micheal, love these events
---
Surveillance is amazing though.
---
Damn why didn't I think of that
---
There's a difference between "the entity puts 4 people and a killer together because it eats fear" vs "the entity is lazy/dumb so the worlds it makes aren't accurate". The first is a reason for the game to exist, the second is an excuse for poor craftsmanship.
---
edit: minor text fixes
---
Old stats I guess.
---
MoM not being in the top 5 survivor perks doesn't really check out.
---
Surveillance is better than discordance don’t @ me
---
Wanna watch it together &gt;&gt;
---
Your suggestion of picking up and dropping survivors makes no sense at all.
---
surveillance is very very good. bad meme
---
I just had an entire 4-man DC against me. And I brought BPS. I was playing Hag and they weren’t even doing badly. My Ruin was still up and I was maybe slightly ahead. I guess that’s enough for them to quit?
---
So what's the counter to the scenario described?
---
True, but then she's effectively a tier 3 Myers, so every chase is cut in half.
---
It doesn't make her weak, it just makes her less interesting to play when it happens.
---
Plus I wouldn't say it doesn't happen too often at higher ranks, you don't see good players too often.
---
He's not sandbagging someone and killing them, he's wasting god pallet with 4 1/2 gens done and 4 alive.
---
You didn't read it because if you did you would see that there's no camping.
---
You can shock pulse over and over
---
Masochistic survivor build: no mither, self-healing, auto-didact, and and mettle of man.
---
&gt;Although I do have rather controversial opinions on tier list placements (cough cough Freddy at mid)
---
I agree that when played in his most effective way, Freddy isn't bad. But I find that way (the game stalling strat with range add ons) to be really boring to use and play vs, kinda like hostage Doc. I'm more of a straight up chase sprit fury/enduring kind of person.
---
I'm assuming you are refering to that when talking about him, if there is some other way I haven't heard about then please forgive my misinformation!
---
So even tho he's not that bad power level wise, I still think he needs a rework because as he is rn I don't find him fun.
---
Probably because Hag is unpopular but the people who DO play her are very dedicated and good with her. Meanwhile I'm sure there's tons of people playing Spirit but are garbo with her.
---
It's like if you play one round as trapper, ever, and 4k...you will have a 100% kill rate with trapper. Even though you might be a Wraith main and be waaaay better with Wraith.
---
Dang, it's almost like it's a bad perk and the daily "NOED is bullshit" post has no basis.
---
You can even have NOED show up in less than 3.7% of your games just by being good enough to reach red ranks... Nope, more reddit posts.
---
People get so overworked over this game. It’s honestly concerning.
---
THATS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY ON XBOX IS PRETTY SMALL COMPARED TO PS4 AND PC. BUT YES PC GETS LEX TOXIC PEOPLE, AND REAL REPORT FUNCTIONS.
---
HOWEVER THE TRADE OFF IS MORE LAG-SWITCHERS AND HACKERS BUT AT LEAST THEY CAN REALT BE REPORTED AND BANNED.
---
Is that huntress one shot hatched add-ons
---
Doc is good for point farming since his power racks up points pretty quickly.
---
Legion isn't a bad choice either since by the nature of Feral Frenzy you're gonna be hitting people a lot.
---
Report him to Xbox for the actual threat on your life. They take that ahit seriously. (I would hope.)
---
Legion, Doctor, Freddy. 
---
Anyone you use their ability a lot. 
---
I use Spirit. I’m ALWAYS phasing.
---
Oh. My. I feel bad. Well i dont feel anything. But i like your content so that unfortunate. By the way you should have killed kittychipz with a mori. I told you how toxic she was.
---
Trapper!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
---
It's so painful to see him that low!
---
Doctor is the best to farm Deviousness points but he is fairly weak so you might struggle to get points in the remaining categories while also having control over the match. Farming as Doctor also causes matches to last quite a while since he isn't able to end chases quickly so your gain per hour is not the best.
---
My personal favorite is Nurse because every hit nets you points in 3 categories (Hunting, Brutality and Deviousness). She can easily control the match and matches won't last long, which means you will be earning a lot more bloodpoints per hour. 
---
With Doctor you will reach ~8k Deviousness points in the first minute and from that moment on, you will be wasting time since you won't be able to get points in Deviousness once maxed. 
---
With Nurse you will average about 6k in every category by the end of the match (8k if it drags out a little bit) but the match will be over already.
---
What they were doing inside the locker? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I understand your point. it's an easy concept, except it's hugely philosophical and hardly true in practice. I'm still not convinced. I never complained. I just asked to be convinced otherwise. None of your responses have been compelling.
---
Don't need to be an asshole. His response answered your question...
---
PRESTIGE THEM!!! I cringe everytime I see someone only level them up to 40.
---
Controller sticks being changed makes sense given the stats for the aim-dependent killer kill rates.
---
Yea but I’m not about to  be toxic because she is ya know? And with joe much I whined about Moris today I wasn’t about to use one
---
Shocking people doesn’t give an unlimited amount. It stops giving bp eventually. But if you shock them then hit them it will give you even more bp and this is unlimited (until you hit the 8k deviousness cap)
---
Blood Hunt has begun. Looks like people are gaming the system. 😞
---
DCs are out of control lately.  But I’ve been playing with my friend the last few nights and he gets disconnected mid game all of the time. It’s not his network because he’s still in the party chat. 
---
3/5 games he doesn’t make it in the game. Or disconnects from the lobby. 
---
It’s been worse as of lately. I’m trying not to put it passed anyone because you know when someone DCs out of rage or mid match randomly.
---
"weird flex but okay"
---
What did they do to it and when
---
&gt;Mettle of Man doesn't counter NOED. You still need to be injured to work.
---
You need to be injured for the perk to work in any other scenario so technically, it does counter NOED.
---
This is gonna have to wait for me 
---
Didn’t level up Dwight :(
---
Don’t think he’s that far tho
---
Doc's power naturally can take advantage of the perk that increases terror radius and gives you 50% gains in Deviousness. Add that in with being able to find immersed survivors from them screaming, your charge shock to rack up tons of BP (I think you need like 8 to completely fill your deviousness with that perk), BBQ for stacks, and even Unnerving Presence to make skill checks even harder, you have a formidible BP farming machine.
---
Most survivors who understand the mechanic don’t bother trying the window again because it means certain death. I’ve seen plenty of survivors jump through it like it’s not even there, though.
---
Fair enough blurry....I guess...thats ok....sorry about the dots.....its a thing....you have a nice day.
---
Just wait for next mori day
---
Splinters - The Plank shares a special connection with wood. Splinters allow The Plank to turn Survivors' greatest weapons against them.
---
Splinters can be placed on Windows and Pallets of all kinds. When a Survivor uses a Window or Pallet with Splinters on it, the Survivor will take damage.
---
A maximum of 7 sets of Splinters can be placed without add-ons.
---
I'd tell you more about the add-ons, but I'm pretty sure that I'd go over the character limit if I did. That shit is worth it's own post lol.
---
Nice Repost dude
---
nope, fine for me
---
Used to be able to use it whenever you got picked up the first time. Only once per trial. Now you have to be hooked for it to work. Don't know when they nerfed it. I came back to DBD about a month ago and noticed it was changed.
---
Weird, all my friends are lagging too
---
Funny.
---
If everyone was playing as &lt;insert killer&gt; for the double bloodpoints, I just wouldn’t play at all during that time. Nice try tho
---
I had a game with (I believe) 2 streamers and 2 escape cakes. As the killer, I got a 4k and didn't pip
---
low fps or like rubberbanding and stuff?
---
I was hooked before tho, I got knocked and was about to be hooked for the 2nd time and the skill check never came? Was on the killers shoulder for at least 6 seconds.
---
My brother has that problem with DBD. I think it’s because it’s a disc and mines digital. Any disc games he has make it sound like it’s going to take off. DBD really gets the fan going. I could be wrong, it’s just an observation
---
Yeah, that and the best extra hatchets add-on
---
what is here?
---
"If you're not ready don't queue up."
---
It's easy to say when queuing can take anywhere from 1 min to 10 for me. People aren't always at their screens when a game loads and I feel enough guilt making the others wait as is. Sometimes people have commitments where they may have to briefly leave their screens and don't prioritise quitting, it's not always deliberate.
---
I personaly use tracking and anti heal perks and use Freddy's dream transition as well as dead zones for downing.
---
My desired loadout with freddy is.
---
-Sloppy butcher
---
-Nurses calling
---
-Surveillance
---
-Ruin
---
Oooo a good idea for a killer , a witch who holds a voodo dolls being cursed to the person
---
Exactly, I haven’t been on here that long to know which have been reposted.
---
Might want to get Spirit Fury which you can then run with Enduring.
---
Easy dont camp, if the gates are open and you do camp and someone gets bt oh well accept the L and move on you arent entitled to kills
---
You have to accept that some people will do whatever it takes to win, no matter the cost. Some people value rank waaaaay more than you ever will, and some people value it enough to not want to deal with the stigma of falling into the lower ranks.
---
You take the loss, you be on your way, and you be what you want to see in the world. You can't control other people's actions, only your own.
---
It seems like I'm in the minority but I would love a Battlepass similar to Dota 2's yearly compendium. Pay a small one time fee of anywhere from $6 to $10 and get access to a large set of challenges that will encourage you to play the game in different ways (such as encouraging survivor mains to play killer and vice versa, using new perk setups, etc.). Upon completing enough of these challenges you can unlock special themed skins for different characters.
---
It's great because it has no gameplay advantages for anybody and therefore is optional, it takes little effort to implement because you're mostly using up artists' time and not programmers' time, and it gives players additional incentives to play the game.
---
Personally I typically only play a few matches a day to get my dailies done and that's it so I would quite enjoy extra challenges of the same nature.
---
Spirit
---
Legion
---
Do want.
---
That’s one hell of a tactical evac.
---
Report this to Xbox and the DbD devs I'm sure he'll enjoy that sweet ban and having to probably make a new account.
---
I dont have that issue i play nurse.
---
"cool story bro"
---
Havent been able to get passed the loading screen all night
---
Your right I dont.  I dont have gigabit internet to play a laggy game.  Gonna make people walk a marathon cause a fat guy wants to try and he isnt able to keep up?
---
Most people just play for lulz and fun.  
---
  
---
Those that play seriously though ruin it for everyone.
---
I can relate except that multiple survivors decide to use BPS instead getting disconnected. I know I don't have any obligation to farm but I'm a BP whore
---
Go directly to Microsoft chat support tell them about this and if you want to make action go quicker tell them you're a father and this was sent to your son. 👍
---
Just sacrifice them on the hook.
---
You have no obligations to survivors.
---
I play wraith. I stay cloaked when I see unhooks so BT simply can't go off. But when I'm playing groups that are super altruistic/farming teammates, I slug them. If I have to deal with MoM, I'll make sure I focus that survivor. You should not be surprised by MoM by end game, because you should know who's getting hit. 
---
I play a low tier killer and literally never, ever experience your scenario because there is *plenty* you can do about it. It's nowhere near gamebreaking.
---
This pro gen rush argument is also pro camping
---
I use surveillance for the purpose of sleeping more survivors and nurses for tracking injured survivors who have woken up for a second mindgame. I dont realy take chase perks as my style of playing freddy is only downing with transition unless there are no pallets. In my eyes skillchecks as freddy is good as it gives you another opertunity to mindgame and is often lethal.
---
As someone who plays a lot of Trapper recently, don't do this.
---
Please await transport to the nearest Hook.
---
Sidenote: Got one of the funniest, most cruel moments of my DBD career yesterday as the Trapper. I was playing on Spirit's map against a 2-man SWF and two randoms. How do I know they were SWF? 
---
Because whenever I hooked one of them and placed a trap next to the hook, that trap got disabled every time. How do I know the other two were randoms? Because that Dwight literally walked into every single one.
---
Hook, set trap, walk away, trap is triggered. Every single time. 
---
The funniest part is that I hooked Kate on top of a hill next to the killer shack and set a trap in the grass at the base of the hill. Sure enough, at about halfway through Hook 2, dwight steps in it..... and struggles long enough that Kate gets sacrificed. He was literally caught in that bear trap for long enough that Kate struggled on hook till death.
---
The kicker? The moment the sacrifice animation started to play, Dwight freed himself XD
---
When people on this subreddit say that Freddy has no power I just cringe
---
Works if nobody ever cleanses.
---
It's basically either facing a m1 1-shot killer, or a much more powerful huntress
---
Fedora man bad, i cant hit claudette.
---
It's dumb personally, I play for fun (well, farming but I find farming doc very fun). I feel no need to facecamp, and while I do tunnel unhooks (I am p bad at spotting people and usually the person hooked runs for their life and makes themselves a huge target) I just slug them and move on. On my totally arbitrary honor system I occasionally do and do not give some survivors the hatch.
---
I personally see every game as a commitment to spend time together with your other players, just like a boardgame. 5 people looking to make the game fun and interesting. While I am not the best survivor, I do try my best to help the team. Just like you wouldn't want to cheese monopoly with your friends by buying all the houses and keeping them, not upgrading to hotels to stifle their chances, I don't face camp.
---
There is just no one willing to be in the middle ground anymore, people who want to test their mettle without being soul-suckingly competitive that you have to do everything in your power to the maximum to win.
---
All I can do though is reflect my thoughts in my actions and interractions and hope others will follow.
---
LMFAO
---
Yeah idk why this clip is funny.
---
How can people get so satisfied from these “lolz” moments
---
Frank! Watch out for the banana peel! Oh no he can't hear us, he has airpods in!
---
He ain’t wrong......
---
i don’t believe in tier lists and rather i believe that killers are good at different things
---
as they were meant to be and as they are!
---
New Hag buffs looking good!!
---
But is DBD on sale tho?
---
This is why I don't play killer, because all the killers can do once they get you on the hook is whack you and camp, while the other players are popping gens. So even if I die, at least he bms me so much that he forgets what he actually has to do. As killer you legit can't do anything if you can't do it right. Just them genrushing you and spamming flashlight at you is something I would avoid.
---
Is endgame live on consoles?
---
Thanks this was helpful
---
Great point
---
I don't get the problem what did you do?
---
Like I dropped to r10 after being an r1 billy by waiting for 3 resets after hating the game, then realized braindead r10 survivors can be rushed down easily
---
You just said pretty much every reason I needed to still not buy this game :(
---
Shame, it looks super fun.
---
all good 😊

I just got the game and I’ve realized it’s very fun at rank 11-13 anything lower and to try hard anything higher and it’s to nooby lol
---
It's not about how "often" it happens. It's that it can happen. If it can happen then it does happen. If it does happen, then its something to be addressed.  For the good or the bad, you cant remove it from your argument because of the occurrence rate. Its not an outlier. Thats like saying "well not many people are good at nurse so what does it matter if once their good that shes broken". Thats faulty logic. The premise is that nurse is still broken when mastered. Or that 4 survivors with mettle of men DOES indeed equal 4 extra hits. Which was the OPs original claim. I broke this down piece by piece because you seem slower than most people, but there you go!\~
---
The most used stats honestly reveal a lot of problems with the meta. All Killers run Ruin, BBQ, Nurse's, and Sloppy, with the only difference being less NOEDs and more Endurings at high ranks. (This is because high rank Killers disrespect the shit out of pallets because high rank Survivors will punish pallet respect very hard. Also high rank Survivors know how to cleanse dull totems.) All Survivors run Self Care, Adredaline, Borrowed Time, and Dead Hard (don't know why you'd use Bug Hard over Balanced Landing or Better Sprintburst tbh) at high ranks.
---
It also makes me a little kappasad as a PC Clown main to see Clown with such a low kill rate. But it does also make me hopeful because that might mean that they'll buff Clown soon, because honestly the poor guy has needed it for awhile.
---
Mine's a disc, but I also have For Honor, KF2, R6S, and a bunch of other games on disc aswell and it doesn't do it for them either

Same. Been every rank on Survivor and killer, mid green is best. In rank one you get infinite red mori’s try hard survivors, ect. While I still get camped occasionally in r10, it’s a lot less toxic and more chill. But no one does gens, soooo.

oh, the pixel thing on the right?

Fair enough. So why don’t you delete your posts now that you know that they are reposts?

Why should I at this point? Not everyone has seen it either it. You can give credit to whoever actually made it. But why delete it?
---
He got picked up the same time he escaped the trap. It's like when adren away/unbreakable the same time he picks him up. Rest of the game will be pretty glitchy until trapper picks him up. Things that can happen:
---
He will vault nothing when the trapper vaults a window, which may cause game being held hostage in a locker in accident.
---
His character will get in the picked up pose when the trapper attacks. Like, flying.
---
Several random things such as fast leaving a locker 10 times instead of 1.
---
He will get the hooked animation when someone else gets hooked
---
He's going through some shit.

I MAIN KILLER AND USUALLY HAVE A BLAST PLAYING THIS GAME (RELATIVELY NEW-ISH PLAYER). SURE I'D FACE THE OCCASIONAL BRUTAL SWF THAT MOPS THE FLOOR WITH ME, BUT IT'D USUALLY BE SPREAD OUT MOST OF THE TIME, SO IT NEVER REALLY BOTHERED ME. BUT LAST NIGHT WAS ANOTHER STORY! I KEPT FIGHTING TEAMS OF GOOD SURVIVORS GAME AFTER GAME AFTER GAME. SO FUCKING FRUSTRATING! I GET I'M NOT GOING TO WIN EVERY GAME! TRUST ME, I DON'T HAVE TO IN ORDER TO HAVE FUN. BUT NOT GETTING A SINGLE KILL, OR 1 AT MOST, FOR LIKE 7 GAMES IN A ROW IS JUST EXHAUSTING. FIRST TIME NOT HAVING FUN WITH THIS GAME SINCE I STARTED. JUST NOW POSTING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I'M STILL SALTY.
---
Lmao why? Would you like other people reposting your own stuff? Yeah I didn’t make it, I found it just like you long ago. And you didn’t do a good job either giving credit to the OG. Which probably shows you won’t credit your future reposts. I was just like you, posting funny shit I found elsewhere on reddit until I learned the hard way; reddit is not Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. People really care about plagiarism here, it’s crazy I know. And if you keep reposting, they will catch on. You’ll get recognized and they will call you out and give you a really hard time. What if you reposted a post from a moderator? Yeah that won’t end well on your side. If your whole profile consists of just reposts then people will start to know who you are, making all of your reposts redundant. So really, you’re just building up your own reputation right now. My care for this repost is probably 2/10 and I’m actually trying to be nice. Giving you some reddit advice newbie. Imagine how someone caring 10/10 would be like. So yeah bud, up to you what you wanna do next. It’s just sad it takes a complete stranger online to teach you that stealing in any way is frowned upon. Lmao take care

Believe it or not that’s not the original I believe. I think the original was a baby dressed as naruto and he said “why would he enjoy being a fucking weeaboo?”
---
Still a good one and works just as well tho
---
Ya this happens to my friend all the time on PS4
---
I know, right? But I'm glad to see it worked out this time. I got one of these earlier--the Survivors were so nice.
---
Groovy
---
I'm going to try Legion after his changes. But i know survivors will keep disconnecting. I think it will even worse, because the "nerfs" only affect bad players, Legion will be stronger in decent hands.
---
Yeh, man, it's a super annoying thing that I think people just get used to. My PS4 gets so fucking loud I can't even hear the in-game audio sometimes. Which kinda makes no sense when you see the low quality graphics and general slow-paced gameplay of the game. I heard this kinda shit can really fuck up your hardware in the long run so I never really play DbD on console any more.
---
So, guess I'll stay in a corner until the hatch spawn. That's doing the objective.
---
Gens are objective, as they are mandatory to escape (outside of hatch after 2.7.0).
---
Thrill of the Hunt's even worse because the bonus only sticks around if there are Dull Totems on the map.
---
It is exam week, after all.
---
Played a solo game against a Huntress last night who hooked me first then stood 3 feet away with her hatchet aimed and ready and didn’t move until I died on hook. Any teammate that tried to save got hatcheted but she did not move an inch. Could’ve been saved if the team had worked together but that didn’t happen. She then did exactly the same to each survivor. I have no idea how they can find any fun in that, she wouldn’t be getting many points either.
---
I love seeing these posts &lt;3
---
Ninja Wraith.
---
He’s a lighthouse!
---
yeah no i was talking about actual tier lists lol
---
Oh oof, well I can't even play it because it just shuts down, I had my KF2 save jeopardized because of it, my harddrive got corrupt and my PS4 was out of commission for about 4-5 months until I found out how to fix it, which now it works perfectly fine, except for DbD.

So what's the counter to it?

No but it negates the purpose of instadown perks since you’re already injured
---
Top tier
---
If you have a good headset, Spirit.
---
If not, Clown.
---
Hearing is essential for high rank at as a Spirit, Clown is a loop ender and has a lower skill ceiling 
---
Both are good choices
---
If you'd read the main post you'd know that camping isn't the issue here.

/r/ihadastroke
---
You only get 60 seconds after being unhooked to use it.
---
I like to prestige for the cosmetics and the grind it takes to level up. Then again, keeping a killer/survivor with all the perks you want just to earn BP’s for other characters is also nice
---
 they aren't descriptions. I'm putting what the perk does to show why i think that way
---
oh yeah lolz i didnt even notice my bad. that's been a bug for a minute now, ideally itll be patched next update
---
Yeah tbh
---
"gen rushing" is only an issue when you run into a SWF team that's tryhard. Having 3-4 gens pop within seconds of each other is annoying, having survivors sabo hooks/cleanse totems at ludicrously fast speeds is annoying, and survivors getting several perks' benefits for free is bullshit. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
that being said, I personally hate people that split up and play "max efficiency" and tryhard.  You do that, and I'm playing killer "max efficiency", and you definitely won't like that.
---
I wouldn’t put it past a Claudette player to kick someone in the ribs for no reason
---
I’d like this to be fixed but let’s be real, this is the least of the games issues
---
you get 3 vaults on a window, it wasn't blocked
---
I stopped reading when you said "I listen to Music anyway". You may have your opinion but for people that try to get Good this is not a Good baseline. Also most Are descriptive not opinions.
---
For every positive message I get on PS4 I get probably 20 toxic ones. 
---
It’s a breath of fresh air
---
What’s the deal with all the sweaty ass killers coming out of the woodwork for double bp weekend????
---
Corvus as a killer when
---
Nothing much to digest here, more or less stuff we already know to be true (at least for the PC)
---
I'm pretty amused at that survival rate drop around rank 12 on ps4. It's the kind of thing that I'd thought was just my mind bullshitting me and it's funny to see it actually distinctly show up in the stats
---
That sucks.. :( I haven't been trying to kill everyone on killer atm, just wanting hooks for bbq. I did kill someone that was literally sandbagging his teammates, that was well deserved.. I hate people that sandbag or just throw the game :/ not cool.  I let those survivors leave.
---
Forcing them to farm is, it's not bannable if they're in on it. But if someone wants out og the farming-match you have to kill them.
---
My bro mains Nurse and gets these all the time.
---
Ehhh I thought clown was cool at first but he gets gen rushed TF out of
---
"Kofi is a paper champ" lmao! Well we agree on one thing
---
I'm pretty leanient on letting people leave depending on how the match goes. If one good person is with some potatoes I let them go. If the match has been productive enough for a good amount of BP and I have 4 bbq stacks I'm good.
---
That sounds actually painful
---
Well said :)

Just had this happen to me yesterday. I wrote the killer to just kill me.
---
Check servers, you can see the ping before the game.
---
&gt;He did this in one match, with you, and you assume a whole bunch of stuff about him that is not true nor is it proven?
---
You can tell a lot about someone in little time. I was simply guessing, not assuming. Because it doesn't make sense to me why people are toxic for no reason
---
&gt;What're the chances that you do this to survivors and got a taste of your own medicine? 
---
I'd say pretty slim because I'm only toxic to survivors who are also being toxic, and at this point I don't even care enough about them to go out of my way to camp and/or tunnel them
---
&gt;It's one game, relax. Accept the defeat and move onto the next game.
---
The flair is "Salt/Rant" for a reason. This toxic player annoyed me so I wanted to rant about it. If the only thing you can add to a rant is "relax dude", then why do you even read them? I am relaxed, I was that whole match, and I am now. I'm not flipping my shit over this, all I did was make a Reddit post lmao
---
Loved it
---
Learn how to juke, loop, be immersed, and deal with the fact that some killers aren’t complete garbage
---
The number of things that need to happen in order for MoM to be used more than once per match make it so it doesn't happen very often. If it triggers more than once, the killer is either farming, or has really lost control of the game.
---
You have to stop calling for unreasonable nerfs. People are already struggling to take you seriously.
---
I recommend watching this video, he goes over good points to learn from.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Jcc55adkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Jcc55adkw)
---
&gt;Nobody said a damn thing about survivors "letting" the killer win.
---
You said it when you implied Survivors should be getting totems and chests.
---
&gt;If you lose if you do chests or totems, maybe you aren't that good, anyway.
---
I could say the same to you if you're losing games in five minutes. Wanna know why Ruin is so good? Because it either forces you to try to eat through it, or look for the totem.
---
&gt;And it's not about spoonfeeding anything.
---
It's exactly about spoonfeeding. Do your job, stop asking others to make it easier for you.
---
&gt;Like I said before, who wants five minute games?
---
Hmm, let me ask the Nurse and Huntresses with Iri Heads. By the way, did you know Nurse has the highest pick rate at rank 1 on PC? Yeah, a lot of people want five minute games.
---
&gt;You're also forgetting about the bit where I said that I play survivor. So stop acting like I'm just a killer main and putting your assumptions on me.
---
I don't care if you're a Survivor main, a Killer main or anything in between. You come off as extremely entitled regardless.
---

At least Leatherface has an instadown. It's more like Trapper, Wraith, or Freddy.

i dont really believe anyone outside of bhvr has stats on every match that happens in the game so if someone came out saying its false im pretty sure bhvr wouldnt really give a fuck since they know its probably some troll, and not sure why they would lie on their own shit anyways that wouldnt even benefit them in any way. Whoever 'disproved it' was probably just some angrygamer that refuses to believe that he should be winning more games than he is. anywayyyss if u have a link to the disproven evideence id like to see it before i make anymore shitty opinions
---
Not the point exactly, no one is owed you being nice to them but it's the "treat others how you wish to be treated" do whatcha want though because I'm not your boss
---
This EXACT GLITCH happens to be EVERY SINGLE TIME the killer is running dying light and I'm the obsession. (PS4)
---
Sorry to nitpick, but max in a farming game is 256,000 bp for both survivors and killer. This generally involves a lot of self caring, or having the killer be the trapper. :P
---
DC dude
---
If you grind to 1M blood points during this double bp event, then you can get most of the way to 50 after prestige. Rinse and repeat for any character.
---
A perk can be called, “can I offer you an egg in this trying time?”
---
Right but the point is that this time it was a joke. Throwing god pallet in literally the first 10 seconds of the game? Yeah that's either a dick move or an ignorant teammate. But here there is half a gen left and everybody is alive while killer is on the other side of the map. This was a light hearted joke that both parties participated in, so there isnt a lot of need to get angry and tilted at *this* particular video. Definitely a lot more toxic things going on in game than this.
---
Horseshit. Fuck people who do this.
---
I will say i'm actually very surprised at the SWF percentage rates(although I think it's always been about 50/50 iirc from seeing previous stats) but the rest of the data doesn't really change much from what we know. Trapper killing that much is very wierd, so i'd be interested in just having more in-depth data, such as kill rates for every killer for each set of ranks, and same with survivors(maybe not per survivor character though). I suspect he might just be getting boosted by low ranks using him and steamrolling other low ranks, but who knows honestly. Maybe he's a lot better since his addons and trap speed were buffed.
---
I will say though that I still doubt the survival statistics, mostly because i'm fairly certain they still consider a DC a kill, and they probably still include games with DC's and games that start with less than 4 survivors in these stats, which would pad the kill stats(only having to do 4 gens starting with 3 survivors would be like having 5 survivors having to do 6 generators, which I think we would agree would make the game substantially more difficult on the killer side).
---
I will say that they probably should work more on buffing bad perks still(especially on killer, who has even worse perk variety apparantly) because the lack of variety in these charts is pretty terrible, and most of these have been in the meta since they came out and have continued to be stupid popular.
---
Gonna have to say that you can get higher as survivor. Back around Christmas i had a group that would do this and we’d sometimes hit 270000
---
I tried throwing down a pallet to save someone, and it definitely should have worked, but the game was SO LAGGY that the killer got away and the pallet went down five seconds later
---
This is why we need skill based matchmaking because the ranks can be manipulated. High skilled players purposefully derank so they can torture the lower skill level players.
---
Yea but, that would require me being an asshole. That’s not what a farming match is. A farming match is when both sides agree to help each other maximize points as best as they can. That includes not killing them.
---
Maybe if you read my posts over again, you'd realize exactly what my point is......
---
Still, getting that high is a grind and cutting short at like 230 is pretty good for time
---
Okay. I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
---
Depends on the definition of toxic. In the end a bit of head nodding, flashlight clicking, hook hitting, doesnt really make you a dick head unless you do it super excessively and then are rude in the post game chat.
---
I like your legion cosplay
---
Uh, might want to check the ritual again...
---
Wow. His previous names on his profile are disgusting: [https://imgur.com/a/YLp6zGA](https://imgur.com/a/YLp6zGA)
---
Because it fucking isn't! You are trying to tell me (unless I'm missing something hidden between the lines), that they should just, not do gens because it makes the games shorter, I said "well yeah, but that's not the survivors fault, that's just the devs fault for making it too fast", of course I get back "yeah but I mean like they're doing only gens!!!", golly gee I don't know, why would the survivors, in a game where you are meant to do generators, and escape, do generators.
---
Your point is basically "the enemy is doing their thing too well, I want them to stop and go do something else so I can win".
---
You want the next COD game to have a mandatory "stop and smell the flowers" grace period? Like I'm just genuinely confused at what you expect, should survivors get one "You have to stop chasing me because I don't want to die right away" card?
---
They honestly remind me of Predator or Terminator, even though neither would obviously be the killer. 
---
I originally thought Ghostface would be dull to add, since we already have Legion. But I recently saw someone suggest they could work as a mixture between Legion and Michael with a stalk mechanic. Made me interested in the idea of a Scream chapter again.
---
Noooo. You inferred all of that. Swf is harder. Just because of communication. You dont have two people going for saves you know what you can probably get away with and what you cant. It's just a more efficient survivor group. Its organized. I have played with randoms though that totally trash a killer without swf though too. But if that same group was swf they'd trash the killer even more.
---
Yeah they sound like retro stalking music kinda
---
How are you able to see auras of survivors on gens? That ability isn't described in any wiki for DBD.
---
why?
---
&gt;Downvoted
---
They hated u/slightlysychotoc because he told them the truth.
---
&gt;You implied doing chests and totems loses you the game. I'm saying that doing so doesn't mean an insta-lose, unless you're really bad.
---
If you're against a good Killer, such as Zubat or Ryanpez, yes, you will lose. But I'm guessing you don't have too much experience with that.
---
I also never said what I spend my time on. I'm actually an Ace main that plunders, but if you think anyone outside of a 4man deathsquad can beat a good Killer without focusing gens, you're kidding yourself.
---
&gt;Again, nobody said anything about spoonfeeding anything except you. And it's not about making anything "easier". I don't want to go into a game and be back in the lobby less than ten minutes later, on either side.
---
Then work on getting better. Use perks to slow down the game. In my entire 4k hours, the only time I've *ever* had a game end in five minutes or less was when old BNPs were a thing. Nowadays, there simply isn't enough pallets and setups for Survivors to consistently win in five minutes, unless you're not good at Killer.
---
&gt;It couldn't possibly have anything to do with how the general consensus is people slam out gens really fast and are good loopers at high ranks, no, that couldn't possibly be it....
---
I literally said nowhere that gens can't go by fast. It's up to you to stop the gens, not for the Survivors to slow down, hence the spoonfeeding and entitled comments. A competent Killer will *never* lose a game in 5 minutes, no matter the Killer.
---
&gt;I'm not entitled
---
That's exactly what an entitled person would say :)
---
You see that shit a lot around here. Everyone should play to win. You shouldn't take it too seriously but if you don't take it seriously at all then why not play something else?
---
Wait...isn’t killer host? So shouldn’t everyone be lagging if this was the case?
---
Prestige is only worth it if you want the bloody clothes or you're like me and will be uncomfortable if your main isn't maxed out.
---
60% extra at best actually
---
The "gen rushing is okay because it's the objective" excuse is often used by people who cry over killers camping even though "it's the objective"
---
F
---
Exactly my point. Thank you.
---
If you're going to reply, what is the point of "have a nice day"? Now *I'm* confused. Did you just want to have the last word, or something?
---
And IIRC, I said I'm mad at both survivors ***and*** the devs, so shove it with the "yeah but I mean like they're doing only gens!!!" bullcrap. 
---
You're completely missing the point. Besides, with that logic, why on Earth are chests, totems, and sabo-able hooks in game? They might as well not even be there, with your line of thinking. 
---
And for fucks sake, I never said anything about winning. I just want games to be longer than the current time survivors trying to slam out gens as fast as possible can do. For fucks sake. I've said this before, even.
---
Legion is still pretty good imo
---
Bloodpoint offerings have nothing to do with pips. Was it a fast game? If so then that’s most likely why you didn’t pip, coz apparently being a good killer isn’t good?
---
It's crazy,  guess the only thing we are aloud to do is make sammiches. :/ He really acted like girl gamers are such a new thing to him. Lol.
---
You outplayed them.
---
Sure if I was them I’d be pissed.
---
Reporting for something like this is bullshit though
---
When I play hillbilly and I’m trying to farm, I start and stop the chainsaw repeatedly super fast
---
Guess we should only have 480i because bot everyone has an hd tv too.
---
There's a difference between going for the win as the game intended (solo survivors having to work together despite the lack of communication to escape), and going for the win not as intended (people actively talking to each other and working together with far more coordination than they were ever intended to have).
---
Well it worked. And I miss out on 24 hours of double BP
---
Frankly you should be compensated a few thousand bp at least. Too bad they won’t notice or care
---
I don't know what's real anymore 😔
---
Thanatophobia is laughing
---
That's not a lie. I got a 4k the other night on a level 4  hag for a daily with no perks. I dont play hag I was just setting up traps it shut down saves it shut down loops basically if you want to shut shit down then do it.
---
It's a rare bug. 
---
Were you standing like normal inside of the locker?
---
It reminds me of https://youtu.be/wHnOlb9hs_8 (not the very beginning, but there's a sound that's similar to this)
---
Survivors in silly looking clothes - Check  
---
Teens dressed as killer (Legion) - Check  
---
Bedroom with silly decorations (Arguably Hattonfield and sections of Springwood) - Check   
---
This is closer to reality than we may think
---
How is people on the same team talking to each other and strategizing, not intended? Are you serious right now?! If it wasn't intended, then the game would simply not have headset support. Of course communication between teammates is intended. Are you kidding?!
---
I had a game yesterday where the killer DCed 2 seconds after the games started and I just got 0 pips
---
Fun fact: I broke the shit out of her jaw to angle it into the partial smile that it is
---
Keep Andy AWAY from Nightmare
---
Headset support? Lmao, the fuck?
---
And communication between survivors is ***not*** intended, the devs said as much themselves in stream. You ever wonder why there's no voice chat in game? Because it's not intended. This game was built from the ground up to put people in a situation where they have to try to work with each other despite the lack of direct communication with each other. People being able to talk directly with each other in that situation is broken as fuck.

---
It's hyperbole. Wow, 60% is more than I thought.
---
I encountered that too, I was survivor and was looking all over for Ruin and couldn't find it. Killer eventually led me to it and then killed me. He deserved it though for being a good sport.
---
It's not that I don't understand, but fuck that. I'm not gonna dc and waste my offerings because people refuse to play the game
---
They had the Moonrise Lunar New Year event. Not a Bloodhunt, but there was lots of opportunities to get extra BP, especially if you were trying to grind for the cosmetics.
---
Also likely to have another Anniversary Event around mid-late June which would probably have a legit Bloodhunt.
---
Then maybe another event or BH early Autumn/possibly another Halloween, and then a holiday event.
---
It's friday my dudes
---
It's nice that I go to the website next to the shoes and it's not showing me dbd shoes
---
Guess he's in for a world of shock, lol.
---
*nea* fixed it :)
---
YES. Had a P3 Claud tell us to stack a bps on top of “hers”. So me and my two friends offered up bps. She didn’t offer up shit. And kept farming us right off hook. And we would get tunneled down. We let her die on her first hook. I don’t feel bad at all.
---
Anybody else find the rank 1 statistic of survival a bit out there? If we go by what the devs say is balanced at 50% survival rate that means survivors are surviving 30% more than they should which is a crazy amount more. 
---
I just thought that was interesting as rank 1 is what we should really care about with balance not the lower ranks.
---
I play doctor and usually people dc so most of the time I let the last go. Conversation like these is what makes me like the game
---
Feng min is pulling some spicy plays

It's true. It's also, apparently, the only line in and "Nightmare on Elm Street" that he improvised. It was too good to not use

I think I posted in the wrong thread. This is the Situation of Plague blocking the basement stairs for 20 seconds to ensure broken Status?

Ash has been leaked from mortal kombat 11, so he'll probably act there too.
---
Why are you sorry???
---
I've had this happen to me on multiple occasions.
---
pray devs will change the killer Adept conditions or de-rank till 15, wait for 1-2 rank resets and try it.
---
Lol. *cough* Sorry. ROFLMAO! Better.
---
You just get less lmfao
---
As worn by the Legion
---
While true BHVR did make a killer lose emblem points for Camping, but eh
---
Or, you just refuse to play the game how it's meant to be played, because doing otherwise makes it easier on you.
---
this is getting downvoted but that’s actually funny and evil. especially evil because it’s blood hunt.

I'd pay to have Julie or Susie from legion twerk me on hook
---
Yes daddie
---
That would... remain useless. You don’t gain overall bp, just makes it easier to reach that 8k for that category
---
This so much. If you're going into a match with the intent to farm, Trapper is the best way to ensure survivors max their survivor points in a reasonable time.
---
I’ve been asking for Ace’s bouncer beard to get fixed for years. He’s got a huge patch of missing hair.

&gt; but if you don't take it seriously at all then why not play something else?
---
Because winning means nothing in this game. I couldn't care less if survivors escape/i get killed. Doesn't mean i won't try my best but i certainly won't sweat about it, i'm mainly interested in BP.
---
Didn't you use the word either? I prefer you tho.
---
yeah i ran into a streamer party just trying to farm. when i played it like a normal game they started cussing me out in the post-match chat.
---
This spot is so common i always check it.
---
Killers who complain about "gen rush" don't usually know how to pressure properly, are bad at chases and don't know when to drop the chase, resort in tunneling and camping and are just overall bad at the game be it due to inexperience or their blame-others mentality (or laziness) with no will to improve.
---
How do I get into a farming game?
---
Um....What?
---
Good job...
---
It's easy to say that when you can't see from the killer's perspective lol
---
I’m sorry is the legions dick too big for all of you? What a shame
---
😉
---
I love machine gun Myers.
---
Its Pig or nothing!
---
Had that a few times and nobody has ever found it.
---
New doctor mask is honorary corvus
---
I dont believe the data i need to see how they came up with this.
---
Lol there's literally a graph that explains you're wrong.
---
Survivors just dc man its disease in the community.
---
most people dislike it. Because they feel attacked. when instead the killer is bad or its poor game design. I also realized I responded on the wrong comment.
---
I haven't been able to ask as I don't speak the local language, but I think it's about 1200. You could also let the others step in your traps in a circle provided you could get them all in a chat together to make it faster.
---
Wiki says 500 a grasp escape but I'm pretty sure that's false.
---
This. They ran small game so even knew there was a trap there so got extra points.
---
I DEMAND a rework of mettle where instead it only triggers on insta down, like noed  or chainsaw, iridescent etc. Because of the crap it puts m1 killers like nurse just now where I had caught some dude right in front of the gate and he just tanks it and walks out tbagging,  thanks dip I was supposed to know you had it and do something about it with my ONLY ATTACK
---
That's the sight Leatherface sees every morning.
---
Yeah. I can play solo and gen rush the shit out of the killer with 3 other random people and the first thing the killer will say in the post-game chat is "toxic" and "swf".
---
What should I do other than repair gens? Urban Evade the killer as a P3 Claudette or hide in a locker as Dwight?
---
I'm not even trying to gen rush, but I'm just going to the next gen as soon as one gets done.
---
It's the killer's job to apply map pressure and patrol gens instead of tunnelling that one survivor for 5 minutes straight.
---
Like honestly, what did you expect? That we're just gonna stand there waiting until you've hooked the first survivor? C'mon.
---
Send more positive messages
---
This ruins the community and in other games it's a bannable offense
---
I get ignored whenever I do :-(
---
There's literally a graph on survival rates by rank.
---
The devs have literally said so on stream. McCote even talked about this very thing in an old gameplay footage clip that explained the game. The fact that there's no built-in voice chat should be enough, for crying out loud. No voice chat communication of any kind was intended to be in this game. And fyi, not everyone plays on PS4. AFAIK, there's nothing about headsets on the PC version.
---
I'm rank 15 and cant rank up because of 15's who should be 20
---
The game knows that no killer would, realistically, be willing to hurt the god that is David King
---
His high mobility is only effective in open areas. You need to utilize jungle gyms and t-walls.
---
Are you me? Just finished bingeing the movies a couple days ago and noticed the same thing.
---
Freddy mains rise up! *Please don't run him devs he really doesn't need much tweaking*
---
Wait am I missing something ? I know the player survey mentioned it but they didn't confirm one did they ?
---
The average person doesn't follow streams. So how are they supposed to know the intended way? And again, how stupid do you have to be to not want communication, but allow me to turn on a fucking headset and talk to my teammates?
---
It’s an interesting concept, but it would be hell to balance, and even worse to play against 
---
Example, let’s say I down someone, throw ‘em up on the hook, then buddy camps them to death while I continue to hunt
---
Yeah, that's actually why it was even funnier!
---
 I was essentially sayin that  if this build isn't good enough by design, the gens will get done super fast.
---
As a killer, I've slaughtered every survivor since the event began. So you're welcome!
---
I don't think so I was more on the premise if we do get one I personally feel it has potential
---
A heavily salted pudding.
---
Yeah wouldn’t be too bad. Maybe add a bit of sway..
---
Removed for salty after game chat.
---
I've been on Spirit all day, some survivors wanted to farm.. Some just left.  I'm just playing normally now since I'm the only one dropping streamers :(
---
Seems the amount of killers willing to farm this blood hunt is dramatically less than any I've experienced before.
---
Terrible! it started one hour before I went to bed and I was like atleast one hour and then my gf pulled out a coupon from valentine so I had to massage her feet and watch a stupid show. But now. I am awake and she sleeps. time for points.
---
I’m not I hope enough people said no honestly lol
---
Wait, is the bloodhunt out?!
---
Trap webs are just camping with extra steps bruh
---
Same happens to me, all the time
---
How does this extremely rare occurrence sum up your Bloodhunt experience?
---
It’s been out for 12 and a half hours dude
---
I’m such a lenient killer on double blood point weekend.  I want people to get a lot of points but also a 4K maxing everything.
---
dying instantly in bubba's basement):
---
No way no sway. Just make him take a second or two to sight stop movement and shoot. It would be a basic hit. The other attack could be a knife. A little slower movement speed and no quick succession of shots. I dodge huntress hatchets sometimes so you could do that same with the gun. Idk about ammo though. Maybe refill it after five shots or so.
---
That's pretty lame you're running in to that,  but good of you to do and attempt to help.
---
Yeah it's always those coupons you gotta watch out for.
---
TIL trapping pallets and crossroads is camping
---
Do you know what the guy is called? Because YES
---
So no different than normal matches.
---
yeah sounds about right
---
How funny, was just talking about how fun this add-on is yesterday in another thread. I also love using it with surveillance. Need to get clown teachables so I can pair it with pop goes.
---
I have never seen streamers on the bloodweb maybe mine is broken

Honestly, if he did some voicework, cool. Model? no. There is no good reason for that.
---
Damn, I didn't even think of that! The Pig lives on! Haha 😂
---
I had a grest plan. Give her the coupon, get her to use one that night on Valentine, when she sleeps I hide like 80% of the coupons, she drinks I don't so she believes me when I said she used them last night. Then next year give her the 80% and some others, repeat. But she found them all last tuesday and she was a bit mad and decided to use them all this weekend. So I will get 2/3 hours a day for bp.

Main attack would have to be the Bowie knife.

Can i join in? I'll bring the popcorn and lube

That's a fair view knowing the devs they probably will make it full of teachable or stuff that gets ppl ahead for buying it which isn't how it should be as someone who use to be super into battle royale genre a good battle pass holds no actual value in game so only the ppl who want extra cosmetics need to buy it
---
Your not gonna need popcorn if you’re joining.

I had a match, yesterday, against a Hillbilly who was constantly trying to chainsaw.
---
I ended up taking him on a 3 minute chase...
---
Will link the video as soon as I upload it.
---
Trapper proud of himself today for getting 60k - i shake my head at him. Did you win? Did you?
---
Terrible teamate decisions lol.  Like why would you do that to us?
---
During chases sure, but the point was urban evasion after spawning, which is not a waste in all cases. And even in cases where you could sprint, how moch time do you save by sprinting, half a second to get to the gen?
---
I played as killer. Put on BPS. And saw two others did so I suggested farming. And then after the match after we all got like &gt;180K, one of the players who didn’t put any offerings called the game boring and that it was a waste of their time. And I’m like wow what are you complaining about? That I didn’t tunnel and kill you for 5K!!?
---
Even better, MoM should be base kit and trigger after EVERY hit!
---
Again, thank you so very much for shitting on those who are less well off. I do hope you always stay in the majority friend. I'll try not to impact your fun that you are having, Sorry Milord.

hell yeah! amen, brother
---
Yeah. That is true. So the odds likely are in the killers favor at low ranks. 
---
However, I pointed this out in another comment. The rank 1 survival rate is probably faulty because of the Pip mechanics at rank 1.

That's my boi

"it's just a plank, bro!"
---
Yeah, true. The killer has the advantage in lower ranks for sure. Don't know if I would call it survivors getting "stomped" from 20-10 but they do survive less than high rank ones.
---
What he was saying made him sound like a kid too
---
How long did the game last?
---
Yeah Freddy really just needed a different play style. Like Hag, you don't chase. If everyone was just chasing with Hag, the sub would be demanding a rework for her too but the community actually understands how to play her. Sad that no one learned Freddy and now we're possibly gonna lose a unique character because of it

It's not for the video. It's for something a lot more fun. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I posted this here already somewhere but reply here as well for clarity .
---
The 80% survival rate is very very likely misleading. You should be looking at the rank 2 stats for more accuracy.
---
IIRC a depip at rank 1 immediately deranks you to rank 2. So it is likely that people who depipped were not counted towards the survival rate at rank 1 (since they were rank 2 at the end of the match).  So the rank 1 survival rates only shows the survival rate of survivors who **pipped or safetypipped** at rank 1 which inflated the survival rate for rank 1 by ~20-30% in these statistics.
---
Otherwise the jump from rank 2 to rank 1 makes no sense since rank 2 and rank 1 requirements are the same. The jump from 2 to 1 can't really be explained otherwise. This was likely a minor fuckup why BHVR.
---
Who takes the time and effort to do this over a single match in a online game what a loser.  He wants your attention probably. Maybe some daddy issues I assume.  This is just sad man
---
He probably wanted attention but I didn't give him any.
---
I'm glad you keep doing these, my friends dig your Legion cosplay and your dancing is lit / hilarious
---
And all the people here will still claim the game is balanced.
---
Wait, why is there no more talk about this, or did I miss some big thread?
---
&gt; I was simply guessing, not assuming
---
You weren't guessing, you were assuming. "so I feel like he does this shit a lot" is not guessing.
---
&gt; I'd say pretty slim because I'm only toxic to survivors who are also being toxic,
---
"he started it" - Congrats, you're both toxic.
---
&gt; I am relaxed
---
Proceeds to stop gaming, open up reddit, post a long post about how he's angry, and say he's not angry. Stop being the victim
---
"Aw jeez" -Survivors
---
I did 6 moris right after bloodhunt started. Just 'coz i wanted to prestiege spirit
---
Ephemeral Rift unlocked Tier 4 Evil Within
---
[According to Know Your Meme this is the original](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-gonna-kick-your-son-in-the-ribs) but idk how reliable you consider that lol
---
I can't say anything else to you other than what I've already said, so fuck off and stop wasting both of our time lol
---
not as bad as the view from the other side
---
Great point.
---
Sadly too late.
---
I suspect a significant number of killers that don't allow farming during events have already learned it only leads to BM and abuse.
---
They'll never reintroduce something like legacy skins. The legacy skins were for PC players who grinded through the old blood webs. I understand that the grind is rough now, but it's not nearly as rough as it used to be. Skins or going to be either bought or earned from events, I don't think that's going to change.
---
Just make sure you fill out the survey because suggestions here tend to get buried under memes and bitching. If you have nothing to grind, either switch to a different role or take a break. Burnout is real.
---
ew
---
whats sad is the way the piping system is if you dont get any sacs throughout the entire match you dont pip pretty much making you have to camp towards the end even if  you had a great match if you dont get any sacs you dont pip
---
Wow so toxic
---
X2
---
Pip system sucks. I have been rank 1 (solo) survivor every reset. I simply don't have the time to grind to rank 1 under the new rank system. Yesterday I had a match against a myers. I did 1 full gen, didn't save or heal cause the hooked guy dcs. I got hooked had two chases which I escaped and healed myself. Opened a door and escaped...-1 pip.
---
Tunneled and facecamped sad
---
Again why are you quoting everything lol.
---
I found him it's u/yasurebout
---
yeah, they better offer refunds if they change him so he doesn't play similarly.
---
You dont.  You had to prestige back before the blood webs were considerably shortened/cheapened.
---
fuck this model looks like shit.
---
I just finished a game, went with Leatherface and put on every bonus BP perk I had. One game went well and got 3 stacks on BBQ the other just 1.
---
Whenever someone uses this expression, I always think, with my stupid brain, "But someone will go blind first"
---
Ash sucks
---
How dare you
---
Might i suggest you give insidous a try with him. it helps to find people that you lose nearby, you can know if someone went to a locker, and it offers great ambush opportunities if you can see one running back for a gen, just wait at a wall for an easy hit.
---
Like dbd flavored FridayThe13thios.  I can dig it.
---
I hope you got killed for tbagging
---
Might be in the minority but definitely the most annoying character and a waste of space in Dbd.
---
It's a fun perk on paper with freddy but there are better options for him.
---
I can tell I don't like you from the way you quote everything.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Git gud
---
I think they'll post a blog post about what they intend to do with him soon, and hopefully we get a PTB for him too. this will be our time to voice our concerns if they remove freddy and add a new hero  who looks exactly like freddy.
---
Maybe swap bbq and sloppy butcher with m&amp;a and surveillance
---
She way out of my league 😓
---
Following this logic Nurse needs a buff too!
---
You're not helping yourself here bud
---
It's happened to me several times, also had a game where someone wasn't able to wake me up against Freddy.
---
Survivor main dominated subreddit. There are atleast 4x as many survivor mains as killer mains.
---
Was farming as huntress, I started downing people with long shots just for shits and giggles and suddenly the skilled huntress achievement pops up.
---
I even forgot that achievement existed lmao.
---
I use MoM but not adrenaline for this very reason sooo
---
That's already a thing. Why do you thin your green ping becomes yellow a few times in the lobby? It's the killer opening your profiles to check friends list.
---
Who's your main??
---
Yea, most people I play with just dick around and have a good time. Like if we play against pig, we all crouch and see if piggy joins in. 
---
Where will always will be tryhards on both sides, who blame everything but themselves. It's why strategy genre pretty much died, 1v1 and nothing to blame to but yourself for loosing.
---
I've been using it as long as i've unlocked it basically, I think freddy is the only one to make proper use with it. can't see myself go without it, but to each their own \^\_\^
---
My entire family died in a car crash, upvotes to the left
---
I'm a killer and I use a bps every game and the survivors use a haddonfield or farm offering. No side is any better.
---
Definitely. Though the latest statistics the devs published did prove that the survival rate for a 4 man SWF player is just marginally higher than a solo player (all under 50% survival rate!)
---
That may be so but we don't need to make it any more convenient for them.
---
Can we take a moment and look at the fact that this data is from April 1st to 7th only? 
---
It‘s one week. Not that representative.
---
Also, how many killers don‘t kill on purpose in red ranks cause they want to derank? 
---
There‘s a lot to consider before boasting „survivor OP!!“
---
and innoncent
---
I trapped 2 survivors there once. Stood there shaking my hand before letting them go with a hit each. A++ hiding spot.
---
You better run, better run  
---
Outrun my chainsaw
---
That‘s the risk of running the perk.
---
I was playing a full swf and 3 of us dc'd without wanting to. It's not always forceful.
---
It's a risk. All I'm saying is they should spawn close enough to find it in 10 seconds. The hiding spots aren't really hidden good at all. I wish I could pick them.
---
All the other plebs with the pumped up megs better run better. Outrun im my no ed.
---
My idea was the classic slasher villain teleports when no one is looking.
---
Essentially he would hide in a locker and could teleport to other lockers and sneak around without a terror radius until he attacks.
---
Another option is to jumpscare a survivor if they get too close and if a survivor opens the locker he's in he exits the locker anf grabs them.
---
As for what else he could do with it I figured when he has a token he can teleport to other lockers without having to enter one even during a Chase.
---
This would be balanced by a cool down timer as well.
---
Add ons couple improve the power like shorter cool down time and Such
---
This would give him strong map pressure since he could teleport anywhere on the map and be stealthy as well making him a dangerous for.
---
Cowshed is also annoying
---
Before, only 3 gens max where highlighted and ONLY for 16s (basically it was meant to let you know if someone is sneaking around the gen you just kicked right then and there). Now they are highlighted in white until complete regression or turn yellow if touched. So basically now it can give you information long after you kicked it whereas before the information was within a very small time window.
---
you used to have to get it to tier 3 so at least people had to work for it now they really do not need to work for it and there is like no point to the other tiers
---
I don‘t think they are supposed to be good. If hex totems were really well hidden and no one breaks it all game it would kind of take away the logic of having a breakable perk
---
Why someone would aspire to be a disgusting immature pedophile is beyond my understanding.
---
Noeds always been viewed as a shitty perk that rewards bad killers with free kills. It feels cheap to die to.
---
Recent rise is more due to DS often considered the survivors equivelant got drastically changed
---
I always smoke some in those 60 seconds.
---
Really smoker-friendly game.
---
No.
---
now we know from who Leatherface took his mask from
---
k
---
Sure it is, it's only 30% away! /s
---
Remind me never to play DBD on Xbox
---
Proof positive of this: Dead Hard is extremely popular across all ranks, while being arguably the worst exhaustion perk
---
Okay I might hate tik tok but I could watch this 24/7
---
Check out /u/NRocky, he worked on this amazing design and he has done a few other killers with the plan to continue on more, I think. :)
---
You know that bug on a console when the controller would hold left but you aren‘t even touching it? 
---
This.
---
Shhh math is for dummies
---
You don't need skill to tally up how many dull totems have been done (and where), or to report where the killer is, or tell each other what gates are open or where pallets have been dropped. SWF gives even potatoes a massive advantage.
---
Killer sometimes is still able to pick you up but i had this bug once so i dont know how it works
---
Same thing a dude did earlier on this map
---
Wait. How did that 800 come to be? Cause 32k is the max in one game, so with 7  times that it would be 224k. Did you complete a daily in the match too?
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury frequently let me get downs that I would not, could not have got otherwise. Stridor lets me play pre-nerf spirit. 
---
But hey, maybe pallets stun your killers for less time because you're just that good.
---
I like playing as the legion
---
#NobodyCares
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
Noones saying you're not allowed to play with friends, it would just be nice if the massive advantage that you guys have is accounted for in some way.
---
Not yet, it's only in the beta on PC.
---
Darn..
---
yep, gotta push them to save, do gens, be in chase with you longer than you need to down them. it's pure farming simulator after red ranks. so you do all these things and then Gatekeeper cucks you and it's not double pip.
---
Fair, I suppose
---
If I got decent bps for monsterous shrine I would absolutely equip it
---
I don't, the other guy does.
---
Totems are literally 15 second gens that don't progress the game whatsoever.
---
Yikes can’t believe nobody got the joke
---
I like the idea. The clown is definitely strong enough to do so. As for my ideas - I tried to play a bit with their abilities rather than their M1 attacks or appearance (except for Plague lol).
---
well atleast he tried.
---
We gave Myers 4 BPS so he could tombstone us
---
because they are idiots
---
HYPERDOCTOR HYPERCLAP
---
Higher chance killers will farm. And if they do itd way more worth using bps
---
Wraith without Enduring is pretty yikers tbh, I'd swap Whispers or Nurse's for that
---
As a killer main, I do use NOED.
---
Because as much as I like playing Nurse and Billy, killers that aren't them just don't have the map control to actually stop generators unless the survivors are dumb as shit.
---
Oh nooo! I forgot there was an event 😭
---
A. Party Streamers are a limited resource, so of course everyone wants to play a full match to capitalize on it, this doesn’t mean “you have to farm”
---
B. Ebony Mori it literally anti-fun and prevents people from playing a full match, because you can very easily get hooked once, found again and then just instakilled with no chance, not even so much as struggle points. What are you gonna do? Just don’t get hooked 4Head
---
He had the third worst kills at rank 1, beating Wraith and Hag, and then they both got buffed and he didn't, so I dunno mang.
---
It feels shitty to run a killer for 5 gens and get smacked with NOED.
---
Personally I don't mind the perk though as it does have a 100% counter that can completely prevent it from activating, it's called not ignoring dull totems.
---
"Max" is a relative term, I always kill 2 of the survivors when farming because to me that's more fair from a game play point, the disparity in blood points is about 4k or less between the people who lived and died. Also, this prevents the survivors from not being efficient. I don't usually farm because it defeats the purpose, but when more than half the people drop party streamers and one of them PMs me, I'm like okay... but the survivors always start wasting too much of my time, so I just kill half and shove my face in a corner so they know I'm over it.
---
not something to take lightly, if something as simple as a video game perk idea makes you even joke about contemplating suicide you should call a hotline like now.
---
Yeah, I do replace Whispers and Nurse's Calling for Enduring and Spirit's Fury whenever I run other addons.
---
did you win?
---
Cherry picking at it's finest lmao.
---
1 death and you lose your rank 1.
---
No. Her ass is though.
---
I don’t need luck at all I do fine with him ?
---
If they don’t farm with 5 streamers I dc lol
---
I guess mathematically it doesn’t make a difference in the long run, but it feels really nice to play one match with double BP and one or two BPS and end up with a ton of points. Plus, people are less likely to rage quit during bloodhunt in my experience so you’re more likely to get better use of them.
---
Some of the earlier killers definitely need to have their mori redone.
---
Not like it matters, really. The entity probably gave them super strength or some shite
---
because you were triggered
---
U late honey
---
People feel that because it’s brother DS got nerfed, it’s only fair to nerf it as well.
---
It’s a reasonably common bug at the moment. I think the devs are aware of it, people have been reporting it on the official forums at least.
---
All i see is two killers
---
I mean. In response. Bloody party streamers are limited. I get that. But when your in pregame I’m not to know if they are running them or not plus it was a 4 man swf so. One of them. I tend to only use Moris if its a 4 man. I don’t like farming either. It’s just annoying. 
---
I also think I hooked them twice each giving them an opportunity. I did feel bad because they didn’t all load in but. As a killer your aim is to kill all. 
---
To top this off I’m on PS4 and I play the nurse so correct me if I’m wrong but I’m at a disadvantage from the start.
---
Go to "myreadingmanga.info" and search "Dead by daylight" !
---
(Warning, lot of gay porn )
---
You are husband now
---
ho ok i can understand this logic thanks
---
OMG yes! I think they look so boring compared to the new ones
---
Which means the survival rate should plummet since it's so easy for killers, right?
---
If it's so goddamn hard to survive AND pip repeatidly at Rank 1, why is the survival rate so high?
---
I just roll my eyes at the wraiths.
---
Ive being boosting with survivor as a killer every game almost, lots of fun and lots of bp
---
DCing prevents playing a full match way more than ebony mori
---
how? teach me.
---
look guys it totally doesnt counter it in this one specific instance where you were ignored all game!
---
More or less then 200lbs?
---
It allows Killers to instantly down Survivors and gives them a small movement boost which has potential to snowball very quickly from a 0/1 kill  to 3/4 kill in a short span of time where Survivors would usually be escaping because they're close enough to a open gate when getting M1'd from Healthy to Injured by the Killer.
---
So all the effort of a Survivor keeping a Killer distracted for a large portion of the match could potentially be pointless because the Killer can M1 2/3 Survivors once each and get sacrifices they may not deserve because they didn't put much effort or ever interact with the Survivors before.
---
I think NOED is fine but they need a way to help Survivors know to cleanse dull totems (besides SWF the chances of 4 solo survivors all trying to cleanse the totems is very unlikely) or give a one time visual cue so any Survivor near the Killer when NOED activates knows to be extremely cautious.
---
Well then maybe they joined the wrong weekend.
---
its fuckin dead anywayyyyy
---
Guys, we can farm the Legion achievement now.
---
hmm today i will play my favourite horror survival game
---
\&gt;clueless
---
\*gets facecamped\*
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Don't know why you get downvoted for that. Double BP doesn't make anyone obligated to farm. You still get double points in normally played games. Not everyone cares about optimizing their point gains...
---
Say cheese seems like the biggest fuck you to killers.
---
Yeah but it's hard countered by Spirit Fury
---
But with a pickrate of well under 10%. By the complains youd think it had at least 80-90%

---
they're already on Epic's dick, who owns the unreal engine?
---
A perk shouldn't only be playable against if you bring another perk. And spirit fury would be nerfed by this.
---
I like your ideas. The only Mori I dislike a bit is the Nurse's plastic bag one solely for the reason that it does not quite fit the time she was pulled out of (There were no plastic bags in the early 2000s)
---
But overall pretty cool ideas. I like the Legion one where the others hold the survivors. Maybe the others just appear behind the Legions back. I would love to see a Mori with all angsty teens together.
---
And me getting killer who don't want to farm do u have any answer lol
---
Well maybe say cheese is to op tbh
---
If you decreased it to 0.5/0.75/1 it would be less op.
---
Yes, cleanse all the totems while your team is being anally destroyed by just decent nurse while you're out there urban evading and trying to get all the totems done instead of fixing all gens as soon as possible and minimizing downtime to escape.
---
And before you tell me "fix them as you go do gens" no, some totems are purposely way out there. I've had experience with small game, there are some stupid ass totems that are on the corners of map (I'm looking at you Lery and Pale Rose). Imagine getting 3 to 4 totems and losing that one totem. You just wasted a hell lot of time and fucked yourself, great job.
---
Don't do totems, cleanse end-game. It's more efficient.
---
Noed killers on M1 were never the problem, it's when a decent/good killer uses it. It allows a stomp to be a bulldozer. Imagine ruin and noed ran by a hillybilly.
---
Maybe 1/1.5/2
---
they quit cuz YOURE having a good game or start, just survivor things
---
That hurt to watch...
---
Total domination!
---
How would they even balance this tho? Low rank survivors already have a really hard time against killers. Maybe increase the amount of generators that need to be completed by rank?
---
I play survivor as well, you just have to think hmmmm where would I loop and try to escape from, there also super popular loops on every map that you can lock off with traps, don’t put traps on pallets that’s super obvious, if there’s a loop put the trap on the outer rim on the loop it usually gets someone.
---
Leatherface, and the Hags are amazing they need to take those as inspiration.
---
The devs won't do that because that would lead to more basement builds and those are not fun to go up against. Especially if it's an insidious leather face or something like that.
---
Not sure if this is bait but the fastest killers move exactly 15% faster than survivors when running in a straight line with no obstacles. Obviously any vault, pallet, or even corner (due to killers having a larger player model and thus take longer to turn corners) flips this the other way. That's why bloodlust and the 3-vault limit on vault points were implemented; back before they were in the game a competent survivor could very literally never be caught by the killer, despite the base movement speed difference.

&gt;Or Just Don’t Heal
---
This post was brought to you be the Legion Gang
---
what
---
I had this as the plauge, was accused of no-clipping my hex into the map, because they couldn’t find it, they where like “I have 2000 hours I know every single ruin spot”
---
Why does no one sees the post
---
A few patches ago, they have some really good spots in certain maps now, but they still have dumb ones as well.
---
You can't force someone else to farm, if they want to play the game normally they will play the game normally
---
Nice, I can appreciate survivors healing at dead ends. Unfortunately it's safe from long-range hatchets :(
---
I'd sprint burst my nut
---
Is a visual bug, it wasn't blocked from the view of the survivor, you can test by bodyblocking a window with the killer and a survivor tries jump that window, you can see how suddenly the window get blocked and the survivor didn't never jump.
---
Jane is heavier than everyone
---
They sound very metallic, it doesn’t fit ghosty at all.
---
Adrenaline is a reward for completing 5 gens, NOED is a reward for not applying pressure..  I don't get the argument for that. Since the introduction of MOM I can understand but Adrenaline and DH is in no way a reason to permanently run NOED :/
---
Clown maybe?
---
Please, all you need to against Clown is to camp the pallet or not be too greedy with loops and he literally doesn't have a power in that situation. It's so easy to counter even good Clowns if you have a brain. And it's impossible for a killer to have chances against good survivors or just simply gen rushers when he doesn't have map pressure or snow ball potential and Clown has none of them.
---
Even heavier than the clown her booty has it's own zipcode
---
like you said ruin and bbq are very solid perks, pretty much for any killer. for spirit i would recommend nurses calling for the third slot since it synergizes greatly with her kit. last spot can either be a fun perk or whispers if you wanna go hard. addons: addons like wakazashi saya and yakuyoke amulet and equals with lower rarity are broken as fuck. but basicly any addons except the passive phasing once are super solid. and no survivors dont hear the vacuum while they are in your terror redius, thats what makes her mindgames strong.  overall: pretty hard killer if you are new to killer gameplay and you definitly need some decent headphones, but if you get good with her, she becomes one of the strongest killers
---
Only if you're overly altruistic.
---
See NoED? GTFO.
---
whats that for survivors?
---
Bloodhound might be nice if it’s hard for you to track blood
---
If the killer uses sloppy butcher, self caring can get really bad. I tend to use leader a lot, which cuts time to heal by a few seconds so it's usually worth it to heal me as a result. Pair that with botany knowledge and you're looking at 10 second heals.
---
Sure, self care alone can save time but this method can save even more time. Feeling safe is nice, but I'd rather just get gens done faster, not slower.
---
Why cant we just have tick marks next to our totems?
---
If the box is ticked, you enter the trial with your totem deactivated for 1m, and you are shown the auras of all hex totems on the map.  Within 1m, you're able to place your hex on a totem of your choosing.  If you fail to do so within 1m, you dont get to use your hex that match.
---
Leaving the box unticked means it spawns in the game like it does now.  Everyone wins.
---
This is where I go when I need a little me time.
---
must be dumb not to be farming.
---
2000 hours but they apparently missed the part where Behaviour added new totem spots.
---
Sorry for the french text tho
---
You should feel sorry for us,
---
They weren't hiding. That's the secret hang out spot. Just a casual place to go to get away from it all. We really need to put up a "no killerz allowed" sign.
---
Nope, runs fine for me.
---
nice
---
I could just feel the Nurses rage
---
I dread the day I run into a 7 man SWF.
---
NOED is very op and rewards bad gameplay. But, as a survivor main, I think it makes the endgame more exciting. Don’t get me wrong, it frustrates me when it kills me, but it does make the game more interesting
---
The same thought crossed my mind. These arbitrary rules or flowcharts (if you do X, I do Y). 
---
Just play the goddamn game, no one needs to justify themselves for doing so.
---
kids chances are
---
generally a helpful perk for new killers but it wont work with the spirit since she cant see any blood while using her power without using ultra rare addons
---
Balanced it*
---
Pc players are such pussies when it comes to legion.
---
A few months ago on a stream, I don't remember which stream or which month, but they mentioned that the survival rate was 40% across all platforms. These numbers seem odd in relation to that previous statement. Hopefully we can get a more detailed answer on the Live Q&amp;A today.
---
Yeah daddy ! Take it off ! Take it all off !
---
Inb4 using wiggles to morse code: „no rescue, gonna yeet“
---
Use them all before BHVR removes them. Has anyone got an idea of how they will change?
---
I thought it was that she can’t see scratch marks, then the perk where the scratch marks are together and last longer
---
This...
---
Hola^
---
But they're not on a exclusive paycheck nor on the store. So not yet.
---
Hopefully.
---
You’re looking at It wrong mate. You’re comparing a free killer to a DLC killer. The numbers are going to be higher on Hag rather than the Spirit. The Spirit is still easily one of the best killers in the game. Just isn’t played as often as hag because she’s DLC and harder to play.
---
BT negates MoM
---
I guess you like long wait times
---
Ah cool. Thanks.
---
Yeah that'd be a PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR.
---
Sorry I had to do it, nice idea btw
---
it could be a few selected killers, basically we only have a few that are considered viable per platform anyways.  this would attempt to diversify it.  
---
the best thing is that most survivor queues are low wait
---
Made with mematic
---
there isn't the repartition of solo and 4 man premade regarding rank.
---
No, but I have had countless games where everyone on my team with Urban goes down in 0.4 seconds flat and coats the team a win.
---
Bootleg toys are my weird hobby and I love seeing Sharp Hand Joe in this subreddit so often.
---
Xbox players aren’t pussies, they don’t rage against legion.
---
The most interesting thing I see is how low SWF four mans are. Maybe we can lower the pitchfork on the “Depip squad Navy Seal Squadette” that happen to be ‘everywhere’ and see that majority of people are two/three mans and even so they aren’t surviving exceptionally higher than solo. 
---
Also no one should be surprised by the killer or survivor perks being picked. What I would have rather liked to see were the bottom 10 across perk selection because I wouldn’t want to nerf the most used perks but buff the least picked ones or at the very least put them on the table and ask why. 
---
I like this post all over though. Hopefully we can use this data to clear up some myths and habit about this community.
---
Blondes...
---
no. You don't fucking selfcare. You bring a medkit or just make your gens. You'd better just pick Mom over self care it's most likely going to help your team to win.
---
Except it's not?
---
Spirit fury breaks the pallet, it doesn't do anything about the stun. You're thinking Enduring.
---
Even then, it's a bad idea.
---
2 extra seconds is still a HELL of a long time to get stunned in this game.
---
Why would we believe stats that aren't at all transparent and are only coming from the devs? Let us see the data and we'll make our own interpretations.
---
Yeah
---
With \^ on this one. Who cares enough to post that?
---
Who would have thought a character that's core existence is in the minds of his victims, would be designed around mindgames? 
---
/s
---
Really
---
Just kill anyone who didn't put up a bps
---
I will say the one exception is when I see multiple party streamers. Cant pass up the opportunity
---
Out of every killer, Trapper is probably the one that you need experience playing Survivor the most.
---
Traps are all about preemptive placement and forcing the survivors to run into them. That means you have to know how the scared little rabbits move and think in order to catch them.
---
The new perk, "the DC" is making for interesting matches also.
---
Wow that sucks. Thanks for information.
---
I think i fucked that math up, i said that last night barely awake.
---
where u see this at?
---
Wdym
---
Then you're the stupid one.
---
are you high? lery's is amazing for survivors. half the top tier killers suck on that map and with some good rng there's several god windows on that map
---
Stridor is very good on her. They've nerfed sounds recently, but with Stridor you can track people while phasing even if they try to juke you, and you'll still be able to hear people a little even if they run Iron Will. You can bump into people to find where they are, but if they're far away, you'll mostly just want to make sure you're facing in the right direction for your lunge when you come out of phase.
---
I also like Make Your Choice on her. She does well with instadowns, and she can get back to hooks quickly to capitalise on MYC, and MYC's proximity requirement triggers off your husk's location, not where you are when you're phasing.
---
You do not hear her whooshing phase-sounds if you're within her terror radius when she's phasing. Your terror radius when phasing is centred on your husk. The Prayer Beads addon (very rare) removes the whooshing sound entirely.
---
Addon wise, Father-Daughter Ring (ultra rare) + Prayer beads (very rare) is a nice combo. Combine it with Monitor and Abuse, Discordance and/or Surveillance, and you'll be able to approach generators stealthily, and then just before the range they'd hear your terror radius you can phase in the rest of the way and grab someone, because of how much ground the ring lets you cover.
---
Otherwise Yakuyoke Amulets (very rare) are always nice, though bear in mind they increase charge time as in, *make it take longer*, as opposed to the other addon that increases charge time as in, *makes it charge faster*, pretty good job so far, etc. The Wakizashi Saya (very rare) is very good for those amazing post-phase lunges, though you move so fast that you can overshoot your target if you're not sure where they are. Stridor helps with this, and they're a very strong pairing.
---
Otherwise, the green addons Rusty Flute, Katsumori Talisman, and Dirty Uwabaki are good. The bad ones are the ones that "increases passive phasing" and the green one that's like a wakizashi saya, but shittier. Rusty Flute and Katsumori Talisman don't pair well together, but either one goes nicely with the dirty shoes or Yakuyoke Amulet.
---
Where did you get the bullet belt or the pants? Only things missing from me posting about my quirky Frank Cosplay.
---
What do you men
---
What do you mean
---
ive had one game out of the 4 i was able to play so far where there were any streamers used. There were 2, and my game crashed on loading. I no longer hold good will for bloodhunts.
---
So you just hear his heavy breathing?

That‘s gonna be a wet dream.

---
Hag's only free on Xbox, right? She's DLC everywhere else.
---
no it's very much intended and it also just makes a lot of sense. the first thing you're gonna do like as a person when something jumps out of nowhere two feet in front of you is spin around to look at it. so the camera snapping to the phantasm makes perfect sense and is a big part of hag's strength.
---
Yes, really.
---
If you suddenly made every pallet stun for 5 seconds, plus the time it takes to destroy the pallet, means that every single Pallet just became ridiculously safe to the point that you *have* to respect pallets as Killer, which means chases last that much longer.
---
What's more, because Say Cheese turns every pallet into a safe pallet, it's a perk that Survivors would *have* to include in their builds, limiting build diversity. And because every survivor is running it, every Killer would have to run Enduring, limiting *their* diversity.
---
This kind of perk is how you completely cause one side of the game to leave.
---
Is this from the most recent episode? Because if so it needs spoilers
---
REEEEE
---
She can't see survivors but she can see scratch marks.
---
Gurgling in happiness.
---
I changed it
---
There is alot of evidence for ghostface as our next killer. Not just in the files. The producer of scream tweeted alot with the devs and he said that we will be getting a surprise may 28th or so :)
---
Makota
---
People have it wrong, it's not that it's skill-less, it is. But that's not the problem, the problem is that it is not fun.
---
no its the other way around. yea predator isnt a bad tracking perk, especially on unexperienced killers but I think its not something you should get used to. kind of like when you start out with the nurse, you wanna practice it without any perks
---
Actually that's not a half bad idea. I feel like I still don't know half of the spawn places.
---
They won't. Did they offer refunds for Legion?
---
This isn’t even my final form
---
Username checks out
---
&gt; because they sit in corners doing it while everyone else dies.
---
Literally where in the perk description does it say you can only heal in corners? People keep parroting this bullshit hypothetical scenario in which the perk is used by the worst players in the worst way possible, but when you look exclusively the *facts*, there are no innate downsides to running SC aside from it taking up a Perk slot (a downside shared by every single Perk in the game)
---
By offering up a single perk slot SC allows you to heal whenever you you want, without a med-kit, without the need of an ally, without losing you a single second compared to being healed by a teammate. It all depends on how you utilize these qualities that makes or breaks the perk.
---
Those hypothetical Rank 20 Blendettes that crouch into the corner to Self-Care that you and other people keep using as an argument against the perk, would still be absolute dogshit even if they ran DS, MoM, DH, and Adrenaline.
---
^^woah
---
i know i was arguing with someone on here the other day about it he didnt believe me hahaha and up until i saw a video explaining the found powers and stuff i believed they cucked us because the sounds match pinhead better than ghostface...thank god it is ghostface.
---
He don't use Ruin on Nurse anymore. He also said that Omega Blink, Prayer Beads and Iridescent Head are add-ons which take away your skill as killer because it makes your matches too easy and he refuse to use them. He used these add-ons before, but now he don't use them. He even said that NOED and Ebony Mori shouldn't exist in their current form.
---
So stop shit talk about Tru3, when you clearly don't watch his stream. If you would watch his stream, you would clearly know these things.
---
Her power isn’t consistent
---
Plus there are other bp gaining perks, distressing, thrill, beast of prey.
---
You are an honest god, thank you
---
^^^yeah they usually just tell me the game is lagging or something
---
I always respect the BPS because I'm not a C word.
---
if only there was a crawling on the floor type killer, would be creepy l.
---
Maybe doesn’t one shot but gives like two status effects?
---
I'd really like a legion mori where all the kids come out of the shadows and stab you a bunch together. Would really be unique to them and they could just fade back into the shadows when it's  done.
---
"I was just BMing to get the Killer's attention."
---
"Why won't the Killer leave me to get other people?" "Because you got his attention...."
---
coulda done the same to the skull tattoo.
---
is there really double bp?
---
It's not your computer, it's a problem with the game that started with the last patch
---
as a Trapper, its p good tho
---
Autodidact only saves time if you heal them right when unhooking (where we'll make it is better) or they come to you when you are working on something. Because every other time, the travel costs of finding them removes part of the bonus autodidact gives (healing up to 50% of the bar, sometimes).
---
Even with sloppy butcher, self care is just as effective as getting healed when no other healing perks are involved. Lets do a little test, what generates more gen progress within 40 seconds if 2 survivors are next to a generator, one injured with sloppy butcher, but he has self care. Is it a) when he self cares b)when he gets healed and helps on the gen. Answer is a, since the other person gets 40 seconds gen progress done. If he gets healed (which takes 20 seconds) both of the survivors work together for 20 seconds on the gen, generating around 36 of progress, so 4 seconds less. It is not a lot of saving, but if no other perks are involved, Self Care is always at least the same, if not better at time saving. Ofc there is more potent healing perks, but they require some kind of set up. Self Care is good because it requires less setup then a normal heal, it depends 100% on when you want to get healed, meaning it is the only healing perk that gives you more opportunity when to get healed effectively, not less like with other healing perks
---
Leader is interesting. I did not consider running it yet. Stat wise, it is a worse Botany Knowledge, but it buffs a few other things, so it might work? Time wise, it would also be slightly more efficient running Leader plus Botany Knowledge on yourself then Self Care plus Botany Knowledge, but you pay with opportunities to heal, so it does balance out. The only thing that literally beats any other way to heal is using a medkit to heal yourself (don't heal others with med kits, you are wasting resources on a barely faster heal). Healing yourself with a medkit saves 16 seconds of team time, healing someone else with a medkit in the best cases only saves around 8
---
Hi thatcher
---
A killer that could climb walls and stay on the ceiling would be perfect
---
It does sound like a distorted phone call - at a stretch.
---
You still have tons of time! Good luck on the grind!
---
Praise geraldo
---
you had me worried when you made noise vaulting over the window
---
They are never going to add in a killer who can mimic survivors.
---
Not only is it a stupid idea from the Killer's perspective ("I'll sit on this Gen, pretending to do it so someone joins me.... why did four gens just pop?"), but it also COMPLETELY fails against SWFs to the point of ridiculousness.
---
It is a crutch perk. Had an insidious blood warden NOED nurse camp the exit yesterday.  I was solo survivor so she got a 4 kill after not hooking 1 person while the gens were up. If that isnt a perfect example of crutch, I don't know what is. Good luck learning Nurse playing with thos perks.
---
The max is 8 times and not 7. Base points + double blood points event + 5 party streamers + BBQ. 32k base + 7 times 32k = 256k
---
This is so wholesome.
---
I think this goes under the saying of „Look before you leap“
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
---
Exactly, they have always have banned exploits so you should just not exploit

I watched this nice little guide when I got Spirit and it majorly helped me learn her quick!
---
Maybe it can help you too :)
---
i had about 10 messages in the first hour asking to farm, makes the game boring
---
so when it s starting this event?
---
well even if there is not a bloodhunt it's still a decent 500% my question was why especially during
---
Camping and tunneling is a way to play, but it honestly ruins the fun for the survivor. I know, I know, *survivors aren't supposed to have fun! Its my job to kill them!* Theres a reason it take 10 min on ps4 to find a game as survivor but only 2 as a killer. No one likes a camper or tunneler and the more people who do that make people not want to play killer because they dont want to get stereotyped with people like you who are literaly no fun to play with.
---
I had a bad moment the other day where someone vaulted it, I vaulted after them, then turned around to see them on the other side.
---
Actually had that bug a few days ago, except I was the killer and saw all survivors this way while they all seemed to see everything normally. Couldnt hit anyone.
---
I'm assuming doc? xd
---
They stated clearly on the news page thingy that anyone using that glitch that got caught would be banned, and that was quite a while ago.
---
Shoulda Killed em for the extra sacrifice points, they don't need to live &lt;3
---
My gut says that one of them saw him placing the trap and went and cleansed it immediately.
---
If you make a change that pisses off 1000 survivors and a change that pisses off 1000 killers, whose queue times gets worse than the others?
---
For the extra 100%? It's something. I personally don't save my BPS for bloodhunts but I can understand why someone would.
---
That’s true. The amount of times where I’ve only ran the killer around and lost a pip while escaping has been insane. So many undeserved depips.
---
Ban evasion is a thing.
---
I must just be bad on it. Don’t get it often though.
---
I'd like to see a PTB test or something where they double the generators survivors have to repair from 5 to 10, but also halve the repair time per generator from 80s to 40s. The time spent M1ing will be the same, but it forces survivors to run around the map more and also makes 3 gens popping at the same time a whole let less punishing for the killer. Overall it should increase match time without increasing M1ing time.
---
Don’t run out in the open, stay next to buildings just in case he comes near you. Bonus if you’re on Lery’s, Game, Haddonfield or Springwood.   
---
If there’s no where to hide, keep a eye out, if you see him take cover if you can but if you can’t do a little spin around him so the chainsaw doesn’t hit you
---
Seems fair, can other survivors help the jumper person get the doll off?
---
Am perks are crutches, in the sense that they aid the basic kit of a killer or survivor. Likewise I don't think survivors still complain much about perks. They too have a ton of "second chances" nowadays
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
If you don't want to be banned don't abuse bugs problem solved.
---
&gt; literally where on the forum or anywhere does it say anything about that if you get banned on 1 account you will not have any soft bans on your new account?
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
&gt; CROSSPLATFORM BAN EVASION: Players who have violated our rules multiple times leading to permanent bans could get their access revoked on any accounts they make if the player is seen committing bannable offenses after the very first permanent ban. The structure and severity of these bans are followed throughout any platform.
---
I understand that this is frustrating and it's a drastic punishment to get a permanent ban, but you did break the rules again after already getting a ban before. The 2 killer exploit wasn't such a big deal, which is why they only banned 24h for that, but breaking the rules so much that you get banned several times is and you knew that you already had a permanent ban. They probably see it as someone not having learned the first time.
---
What
---
Dunno why the "pretty good job so far", it's literally intended. The killer is occupying the space that you need in order to slam down a pallet. You can't just stretch around him.
---
This gave me a good laugh!
---
how come No0b3 is still playing? he has been banned twice so he's ban evading?
---
Ah, i see your a man of culture aswell.
---
On xbox it isnt any different for me, i feel you my dude
---
Yeah sorry not sorry, you literally and deliberately abused a glitch. Just Because you're not smart enough to realize that doing so will get you banned dosent excuse it.
---
You must be really dense if you think that if a company bans you from using their services and you think using another account to get around being banned is okay. They banned you for a reason. It's called ban evasion. Also, you knew full well you were intentionally exploiting a bug since you coordinated with another person to do so. You can't abuse a bug, claim you did not hard then jump on reddit and complain about being banned for something you did intentionally.
---
You get 3 chances and then a hardware ban.
---
yeah and no0b3 totally ain't ban evading or anything
---
Did the game crash?
---
yeah a 24h ban not a fucking permaban
---
Kate looks...  Okay...
---
Exactly this and also the fact is that he actually attempts to sync the perks in his build to make it even better gameplay, also helps he skips the boring bits like if he stays on a gen or something
---
Gained stage 4 depression and t3 cancer
---
xD
---
Clown is easier to face against....     
---
Real answer is Spirit
---
Or make the run better in console. That would be better.
---
You accepted their rules when yoz clicked "read terms" etc.
---
Pretty much any company that sells digital stuff actuallynjust lends it to you. The company owns it. They can do whatever they want with it, you're just allowed to use some of their stuff.
---
Where do they announce these events, I pretty much only pay attention to the subreddit and didn’t see it till now.
---
Nope
---
Oh. so the rumor was either false, it's not 100% or it's patched
---
The stats they recently released, shows pc and PS4 players dc against legion constantly.
---
Yet people always bring the "NOED rewards killers for failing" every time the discussion comes up.
---
There'll never be a productive discussion as long as we allow nonsense like this to fly.
---
Come buba time to farm distresin,bbq and thril the hunt.
---
P.s: I'm never camping but fck buba have 50 bbs have it...
---
Party streamers are just +100% of base points. Double points event is a hidden party streamers offering itself as it gives +100%. It does not matter if you use streamers during event or not , because it will give same so say +29600 bonus per offering like in the previous example. People just tend to believe it gives more, or just try to make event even more special and see crazy numbers.
---
P sure I've ruined a few pairs of pants scaring the life out of people as pig. Michael might give me heart attacks early in the game, but Pig can get you anytime.

---
That looks so terrifying but yet so cool. Nice work
---
Not sure if its just cuz im playing the doctor or not but ive gotten brutal killer plenty of times while all 4 survivors escape
---
Most of those shitty camping killers are the survivors flocking to the killer side for the event.
---
I follow the devs on Twitter, but I also follow the "Upcoming Events" in the sidebar. https://i.imgur.com/i9q1JTr.png
---
That's why I purposefully leave myself at 99% healed if the gates are about to be open. Getting hit with Mettle of Man active will not reset heal progress [as seen here.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/419346940?t=04h32m42s)
---
Twitter. A lot of their news is posted there, especially events.
---
Yeah, if you hide well in a match you can never get hooked.
---
I was downloading perk icons from your dropbox and saw this after I refreshed the page, it was a great surprise :)
---
Another amazing icon, thank you &lt;3
---
I don't think dailies is included in the post-match round-up.
---
Thanks for the fast response, but i only want the Gold Perk Icons without any background. Because you may still have the Gold Perks without Background saved somewhere.
---
Yea I too sometimes refresh his profile to see if he uploaded anything new! This looks really cool as the others
---
Say Cheese is broke AF man
---
howdy
---
I love spirit :) hrre my tips:
---
BBQ, Hex Ruin, Surveillance, Make your Choice.
---
These are my go to perks. Other good perks would be:
---
Sloppy Butcher, Thrill of the Hunt (with Ruin and/or Haunted Ground), Hex: Devour Hope (especially good with Make your Choice together!), Brutal Strengh (Surveillance combo), Spirit Fury+Enduring (normal strong combo) ... Discordance is decent as well.
---
I enjoy Prayer Bands a lot. It removes the Vacuum noise when phasing away. It allows you to grab people of stuff a lot.
---
But did you pip?
---
I'm new to reddit. Only in two groups: dbd and game of thrones.
---
So of course I love that you put both together xD
---
[So you're like me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxY4ZN3QOE)
---
A smaller sample size would suggest less accurate results. How many people honestly play Hag on a regular basis compared to other killers?
---
There are still 12.8k more points than there should be
---
Perk 1 seems fine, Iron Maiden would be a nice counter to it and the perk itself can be used for some smart plays during a chase. Especially on the temple map
---
Perk 2 is definitely unhealthy for the game. Pallets don’t need a buff with how powerful loops are already. Certain pallet city maps could become stupidly broken with even an extra second per pallet
---
Perk 3 is nice in theory but I really don’t like how it hard counters any Wraith mindgames at all, turning him purely into an M1 killer without a power during a chase. Imagine a perk that disables Trapper’s ability during a chase, or stops Hillbilly using his chainsaw for anything but mobility
---
Overall I think only the first perk is good on paper, and I could totally see it being an addition to the game
---
It's not artificially extending anything if the game goes longer. It *should* be longer.
---
Yesterday I got 216k in one game as survivor. Was pretty happy with that
---
They really ought to add Cyprus mori function to the other 2
---
Been playing almost non-stop since event started, been down for farming the whole time.  
---
But survivors like taking advantage of a friendly killer to try-hard.
---
This meme doesn't make any sense, Surveillance is really good now.
---
Shredded David because why the bloodeh 'ell no
---
Please tell me that's not your actual fps
---
The game has absolutely zip to do with you turning on a headset. What, you think it's possible for them to disable you being able to plug in a headset and talk to your teammates through a third party app? Please.
---
&gt; With NOED 0 kill games can turn intov3 kill games due to the snowball
---
That’s how late game perks are supposed to be, even if NOED is the strongest of them. I will agree it gives free kills and sucks to die too, but there is SO MUCH counterplay to it, that the easy benefits from it is balanced
---
So fucking true
---
I FEEL LIKE IM GOING TO FUCKING PUNCH SOMETHING WHEN IM LOOPING AND FINALLY THROW DOWN TBE PALLET OR BAIT THE KILLER AND IT EITHER DOSENT REGISTER (I HAVE GOOD PING DONT QUESTION IT) OR THE KILLER ENDS UP OTHER MY SIDE OF THE PALLET SOMEHOW AND GETS AN EZ HIT ON ME, ALSO FIX HIT BOXES, THIS SHOULD BE FUCKING CLEAR BY NOW!
---
The entity would actually love this according to the lore.
---
You'd think that producers would spend 30 seconds to Google the franchise they invest in.
---
I played almost all night and 70% of my games the killers camp, tunnel vision..etc. its so boring.
---
I meant activate Windows
---
I respect your opinions an thank you for your insight.
---
The hook is exactly what that's used for, it's to pull the killer away from tunneling another survivor, an to focus on you, even if it would just get you taken out, also, its optimal use would be for late to end game to make that clutch save on a greedy killer focusing on that poor soul on his last hook.
---
The first is for taking "Protection" hits technically, but even when your the one being focused a 30% reduction for 3 secs isn't too bad, any half good killer won't be so easily bamboozled an would surely pick the trail right back up.
---
Also, since DS only works after being unhooked you'd have to be the one being tunneled for it to synergize with these perks, or it would take surgical like communication an timing to use these based off your teammates DS lol.
---
The last bit about David King is probably a reflection of my playstyle, I always go for saves an will gladly trade you spots on the hook if it means you'll get out, and King is my current survivor main as his perks are a reflection of Altruism as well. They are pretty similar but also Kings perks are more about being safe and making saves and this is more about being a willing sacrifice.
---
Played for about 6 hours got roughly 1.5 mil bp in that time
---
In terms of bugs? I thought so too.
---
But like, head on doe
---
The real maths is 29600x8= 236800. 100% base + 100% event + 100% BBQ + 500% (X5 streamers). Conclusion - additive ^-^
---
Since when did getting flamed in post-game chat was ever an obstacle for random shitheads from farming their team mates?
---
OP is complaining about rank 1 survival rates... nevermind the fact that solo survivors have a survival rate of around 40%. You can't just balance the best of the best, because where does that leave the players that don't play 10 hours a day?
---
If someone made this for me, I would feel genuine pity that their life has literally *nothing* else going for it.
---
I mean, that's a lot of games for one week. You wouldn't expect a massive variance in week to week unless it included an event or something. 
---
At red rank? I don't think killers purposely stop killing at red. If they wanted to depip, they'd do it long before they hit red. If they are there, they are going for rank 1
---
Kate &amp; Claudette
---
i play mostly Kate 'cause i have every perk for her, but i also play Adam, Jake and Laurie
---
There's a double blood point event happening? 
---
F.
---
Killers queue times get worse because EVERYONE and their mom is a killer main.
---
yeah i deserve this ban and xxxtentacion deserved to die
---
Call bullshit all you can. Devs have the numbers and you don’t. Not all swf groups are like yours.
---
Dunno why you’re getting downvoted, this is right.
---
People just like seeing big numbers, but you gain nothing by sitting on your streamers.
---
Stalking my post history I see?
---
The whole thread started from double points event farm xD
---
What are those offerings? Sorry but im new this is my first double xp weekend. Any tips to maximize?
---
People just refuse to do the counter (cleanse the totems) so they can focus on just gens, and then whine when they get hit by NOED, which punishes survivors for focusing on just gens.
---
Username checks out.
---
Then those people are dumb as fuck for staying in an expressly stated farming lobby.
---
Sorry for late response
---
You can reach over 100 of any add-ons (Jumpscare Myers the youtuber has a video where he shows off his add-ons, and a majority were over 100.
---
Yeah people do this shit all the time that sucks
---
A survivor can still get 32k by dying, it would be time consuming, sure, but a full self care is worth 300 survival points, wiggling off is worth 500, and stuns through DS or Head on are worth 500 points. May be worth taking in case a game turns into a farm game (if you dont care to keep an item, anyways)
---
Also, when repairing a gen, get off occasionally to sprint for a second, gives the killer hunting points and you escape points when you get back on the gen, it's faster than pallet hunting.
---
Tapping the gen and letting the killer break repeatedly is good brutality too.
---
didn't need to when i saw your profile pic
---
My friends and I like to take turns throwing 1 bps at a time, just in case this happens or if the killer is sweaty and doesnt want to share the bps
---
Because survivors are full of shit and victim complexes, as usual.
---
Feng. Usual cosmetics are just the day off wrap, the Qipao skirt, and the bun
---
Who the fuck uses any add-ons for flashlights other than double batteries? The flashlights got nerfed so hard the only add-on worth using are batteries. Lenses don't do a damn thing any more.
---
It’s not being overly altruistic, it’s being a team.
---
Let’s suppose the fact that you have your mate get chased and then the last gen pops and the killer has noed. 
---
Of course you want to try to save him because 1. It’s a team game, 2. If a survivor get hooked everyone loses points from the emblem and 3. It get you point.
---
That is not being overly altruistic
---
I don’t know if your trying to focus perks or just have fun in all but micheal is really fun and at some times toxic
---
I got fookin' Dead 'Ard, lads
---
Used to main Jake until Ash came along. Now he's my one and only!
---
Ash or Claudette, depending on if I feel toxic
---
I like for the fast queue times
---
Never
---
Im not gonna lie. Ive been told UwU means furry. Is that true? Can you use it in any other way?
---
I had 256k as survivor in 1 game
---
That's probably because the Legion can't see anything with 20 fps anyway
---
Haha fair enough dude
---
Nice title.
---
BYE BITCH
---
I don’t know. I feel like I don’t use the flashlight enough to make it drain.
---
ZubatLEL is a streamer who got permabanned for hacking legacies. He streams on a new account and a lot of devs hang around in his chat.
---
&gt;Stat wise, it is a worse Botany Knowledge
---
It is. And don't forget it works for -other people-, not yourself, so if you're healing someone else you won't get leader benefits (unless they have leader) But it's completely worth it, trust me, especially if you play with other people or generally are altruistic I can't go back to not using it. It soft-counters sloppy butcher (not by a large amount, just a bit), can destroy totems, open gates a lot faster and generally just do things faster, like unhooking.
---
And I agree with you, self-care is a great perk and time-saver, I used to use it all the time... buut I just think that sometimes we survivors can over-estimate the benefits a little bit.
---
Even now though I still go into matches and regret not bringing self-care as they bring this huge peace of mind when I play solo, sometimes I can't heal when I'm 2 vs 1 or 1 vs 1. But still..
---
You wrote in another thread that medkits are a resource that runs out. They are, but it depends on your medkit + addons. A purple medkit with more charges will last quite a while, 3 addons and then some. If you use botany knowledge with this medkit, you get 4 heals which I honestly think is probably enough for the match, and it beats self-care way outta the water considering you save so much time AND you heal teammates faster at the same time. While self-care can be the best option (or very good option), there are certainly alternatives and these are worth pursuing in the hunt for better time-savers or at least more situations. We'll Make It has always been a good contender for this, considering it lasts 90 seconds so you can use it outside of its intended use (if killer is slugging you can yeet that guy up pretty quick)
---
Alright, I'd cop out but M16 bullets are expensive, $116 is just a bit too much on top of the Leather jacket lmao
---
*laughs in 4% movement speed*
---
i did adept plague by asking the survivors to help me out
---
Yup
---
Freddy or Pig, they actually have useful perks
---
yea bad luck games happen. but i wouldnt try to kill anyone anyway. just try to get the 4 BBQ hookings, then spend the rest of the matching f*cking with them
---
Freddy
---
not at all...he hacked legacy, yes and got banned for it. so he purchased a new Account and leveld with the help of fans ans friends.
---
His Second Account got banned because he showcased an exploit in kyf, which many did before him, so he got his final Account and repeated the leveling
---
Change it up a lot, my main is probably nea but i also have mained David, quentin, Jane and most recently my P3 Claudette
---
And yet, look at all 0 of the posts complaining about unbreakable/deliverance.
---
I didn't think alot about them so they could be changes if you want to give some
---
I have never seen this......
---
I’m a purple rank 8, matchmaking has been pretty quick for me this morning. Maybe you’re just having bad luck?
---
Kate because I'm gorgeous, dahhhhhhling.
---
I’m only scared that this would motivate killers to bring Moris more often
---
God these are so clean. I hate the ones that make all the perks ridiculously saturated but this is just beautiful.
---
Myers and Spirit
---
just for context for those who don't play fortnite, there's creative mode where you can make your own game modes, this is user created.
---
I guess DCing on third hook is the least toxic DC possible, but why? Just to keep your flashlight?
---
Unless survivors are bringing BPS, no. I want to play the game.
---
Where is this data? I've seen this referenced several times and every time I ask for a source I get data that doesn't have SWF accounted for.
---
Let's be honest, that was a pretty cool valyrian steel dagger (and maybe we get some more lore to this cause imo that whole scene was a surprise but VERY anticlimactic)
---
It sucks that you have lost all your progress and bloodpoints, it is a little extreme.
---
Must be some pretty shit killers at r1 lmao
---
Holy shit
---
How to optimize farming?
---
The odds of a player doing nothing towards the groups progress is pretty slim or non existent. Your argument seems to be that they have to do gens but on a team of 4 you're contribution can be spread out. You could be the distraction, the one going for saves, gen jockey like you said, etc.. they all still contribute toward those gens being completed
---
what? no. I just dont like BR Games cause of the weird Match making and getting killed by People that you dont even see. That together with that annyonig artstyle is just enough to stop me playing.  Apex at least has an okay graphic, so I sometimes play it uf friends ask me
---
I got a full room of party streamers and my lobby failed and it ate my only party streamer on that killer, which i had a daily for
---
You’ve got the part regarding personal right, but stacks means that an offering will combine its effects with other offerings (ie. you burn an escape cake and a teammate burns a bound envelope, which stacks to you getting 125% bonus bp in all categories that game). To know which bloodpoint offerings share with others, they just don’t say “personal” in the description.
---
Stop with these fairy tales
---
I use them often to conceal my groaning while healing.
---
You still clicked on my account no?
---
Pig, Legion and Spirit
---
distresing is bad in my opinion. switch it for smth else
---
nope, just some "funny" people that think no one should get extra BP as well as the usual crashes
---
Of course, it's a free down with MYC if they fucked up
---
I used to main Clown but now I just play whatever I feel like at the time. Bubba has been common lately
---
what is this? is this fan-made manga inpsired by dbd?
---
&gt;  They too have a ton of "second chances" nowadays
---
I love how Survivors complain about NOED but god forbid you complain about MoM or Adrenaline.
---
They're so great to just hide behind.. So many times I've had a killer searching for me and I'm just hidden in plain sight.. Also, I'm mostly deaf.. So the audio has never really been an issue for me.
---
Pipping at rank 1 is all down to luck as Survivor because you can't work towards all your emblems at once like Killers can. For every pip you'll have 4-5 safety pips, which is why you'll rarely see a rank 1 Survivor nowadays, which goes to show how little any of you in this thread actually pay attention to the survivor side, lmao.
---
Doctor but because he's really buggy and I'm waiting for them to tweak him I've been playing more Billy.
---
Claudette, David, and Kate.
---
Huntress. Gotta love them hatchets
---
Hag FTW
---
The Legion change is a buff, unless you consider the removal of a literal exploit and the need to actually be decent at DBD a nerf that is.
---
I almost had adept freddy, but one guy disconnected so his friend could take the hatch
---
I don't know where but I found someone who made that exact mori animation somewhere. It looked really clean
---
Legion. Used to be Spirit, but then I just abruptly stopped one day.
---
I am so ~~pro~~disgusted~~ud~~ of this community.
---
Wraiths mori is an absolute joke
---
Look on the bright side: at least this subreddit's inspired rules prohibited these three worthless trash-people's screennames from being shared.
---
I’ve done no dailies.
---
I want to play the game sorry :)
---
i would think that based on the wording after the stats that the perk stats show the percentage a perk is used based on all the perk slots. not how many games it is in
---
Don't have a main, I love all killers but I'm playing a lot of trapper. He's soo fun
---
damn 15 seconds of Aura reading.....thats like 3 times the duration of all other Aura perks
---
This is the double bp event. Of course people are going to want to optimize this rare event as best as they could.
---
The two are interchangeable depending on preference, I know. I run surv on Pig and Myers, it's just a dumb meme lads. I never notice surveillance triggering so I prefer discordance overall. Calm, calm.
---
yeah that forehead would be hard to miss
---
Can’t relate. I haven’t seen a party streamer in 100 years.
---
I have kill 4 survivors in one game and all escape through the hatch left to do on PS4 to platinum the game. Honestly not sure how I'll do either with the constant DCs and such.
---
As I said I just had a thought
---
It's not.
---
It's a 3-strike system, ban evasion is only a thing after your 3rd acc is banned.
---
Granted I've only had to get one adept achievement (killer side, since it's still easy af for survs) since the change. I got adept plague my third try. I don't know it just doesn't seem that hard to me. Granted, it's harder to get killer adepts than survivor adepts, but really, it's not that bad depending on the killer (adept nurse too me the longest to get cause I am a shit nurse lmao, everyone else was fairly okay).
---
I agree. I did this last night and I messaged the unlucky victim so quickly. I'm still adamant that SWF shouldn't be in the game or at least limit it to 2 people. The problem is I genuinely feel bullied by SWF and just get ultra sad. I'm sorry survivor!
---
Too sad for words trash camper.  Zero effort trolls.
---
I luckily got the platinum on PS4 for the base game already, but I haven't bothered with adept Plague yet because of the new requirements. It's the only adept I need now. I still need some trophies from the DLC, but the only one I'll probably never get is Skilled Huntress. The requirements for that one are insane.
---
I don’t exactly farm but when I play killer, if I give somebody a hard time and they’re on their last hook, I’ll leave them live and if they want to farm I’ll let em. Either that or turn them into a play thing, made a few friends doing it lmao
---
Depending on what you did you got multiple bans on your first account leading to a permanent one (or just straight up permanent due to hacking, ...). You then exploited on your second account which shows that you still haven’t learned from your mistakes. You get one more chance so don’t waste it again.
---
Ah ok thanks very much. Only just found out that your two add ons work in order from left to right. Can you confirm that?
---
So you got your first account banned, and you decided to do something against the EULA on your second account despite having already been banned once. Idk why you thought that would be a good idea.
---
I'd kinda just prefer to play the game. Farming is pretty boring.
---
Definitely!
---
P3 Ace at heart. But I have been playing Tapp man because I love the way his bloody vest looks.
---
I was trying to draw attention away, it's my job as Bill to sacrifice myself for the others...but then they got out so I did too :D
---
Oh my bad I’ve had someone complain that their anxiety is the reason they always lose and now I just think that’s the case with most people
---
Its a good time for where did they go trophy if you can msg everyone and farm for dbl bp event and just tell then you need trophy and everyone needs to leave hatch. The kill one just requires a mori and hopefully no one disconnects
---
Certain devs have hinted that add-ons like iri head and omegablink/instasaw are going to be nerfed/changed in the future. Tuning guide was specifically mentioned as something that will almost definitely be changed.
---
Ive been playing killer for 4 hours now, all survs use op stuff genrush tbag message me ez
---
Idk why you got downvoted, you’re right and it’s the same thing across all platforms. If someone gets found too early in the game, they’ll DC. If someone else DCs, they’ll DC. If someone gets downed, they’ll DC. It’s a pain in the ass, definitely not PS4 exclusive.
---
Thankfully I got platinum a while ago, but yeah I feel really bad for people who are trying to get it. Back then even if all 4 survivors dced you'd get the trophy but now it's just a nightmare
---
I'd love to see one shot, but the hatchet has to fly over 30 meters or something like that. Really good, but still has counterplay.
---
Don’t she’s not worth it in my opinion
---
I think it's honestly more that people are terrible at dealing with Hag traps. When I play Hag, I can often get away with putting traps in the same place over and over (right next to generators, not very hidden) and people will just continuously set them off. It's the same with trapper, but the Hag can teleport which makes her more efficient.
---
Yeah, so for example when using a flashlight, you’d want to use a battery and then the filament in order for the filament to reduce consumption of both the flashlight and the battery
---
Yeah the lack of variety of perks on both ends should be REALLY telling to the developers, though I am zero percent surprised. They really need to work on balancing the perks.
---
Stop telling survivor mains where all the good spots are 😤
---
Don't worry, no one ever gets to rank 1 anymore anyways.
---
Dwighty boy
---
From what I can see, they're playing on ironworks. God forbid they use one of the strongest windows in the game to loop the killer over shack pallet.
---
Lol, it would. I heard a mori idea a while ago that kinda nerfed them, but made them more fair.
---
Get rid if yellow mori, make it default. So that the killer can always mori the last survivor. Adds a hook to the emblems.
---
Green mori, can mori any survivor after they have been hook twice or the killer has gotten 5 hooks already. 
---
Iridescent, can kill a survivor after 3 hooks, 6 hooks, and 9 hooks, or if the survivor has already been hooked twice. Counts as a hook. If there been hooked twice, and say you've hooked 4 people, then when they get moried the killer wouldnt get another mori at 6 hooks. That would be exploitable.
---
It nerfs moris, but I like the idea that I need to work for my iridescent kills rather than a game over at 4 gens.
---
Yeah, I actually really appreciate these stats because they counteract so much of the whining you hear on both ends in this game.
---
Same variety of all the perks "haha"  
---
Wtf lol
---
Because if you slam it right on their heels touching the same hitbox, they won't get stunned due to latency 9/10 times.
---
Hol' up. There's Nea, Dwight, Claudette and Meg. The only player left is a killer. Oh shit..
---
Michael needs a neck snapping one. He's breaking a lot of necks with his bare hands in a lot of the movies. And man would I love it if they gave him a head tilt.
---
Then where did these points come from?
---
Meghead detected.
---
Yeah that perk data is pretty bad. If you have as many perks as this game does and literally only about four are being used on each end, you've clearly done some poor balancing.
---
That back massage
---
I did the math.
---
29,600 X 8 = 236,800
---
Why yes, ruin stayed up the whole match
---
Should've been playing DbD on switch too
---
Someone else already pointed out that this is likely because if you die at rank one, you often depip to rank two, which would skew the results pretty badly up there.
---
Wraith should get a part time job at massage places
---
That's a good strat though. Granted, not for nurse, but I snowballed my 1k to a 4k with Freddy with that setup. Of course I anticipated it in my build, so I didn't equip NOED to save me from failure; I wanted the endgame to start so I could get my kills in. 
---
Most killers just use NOED as a fail safe though, which is okay, but sucks when you loop the killer for ages only to be downed by NOED in the end because you barely had a chance to break totems and you play with potato survivors.
---
i'm fine with long wait times. I have stuff to do in between games
---
Myers with some Clown and Spirit on the side.
---
agreed, it is very boring.  Especially for a killer it is 10x more boring.
---
Surveillance is in the Shrine of Secrets this week too
---
Do you have statistics? Xbox has SWF mostly.
---
Reminds me of a game the other night I had as Huntress. I usually don’t care too much about survivor BM’ing - you want to teabag me because you hit the space bar and dropped a pallet, go for it. But I had this one SWF group and one of them was doing nothing but following me around clicking her flashlight at me nonstop. You can bet I tunneled her ass into the ground and felt no remorse about it. And afterwards they were all like “she was doing the objective LOL stay salty baby killer”... didn’t realize BMing a killer counted as an objective but 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
This whole thread reeks of whiny Killers trying to find any reason to justify why they are trash. Do any of you really believe Killers get less than 1 kill on average? Considering, y'know, to get to rank 1 as Killer you have to get kills? And do any of you believe there's an actual skill disparity between rank 2 and rank 1 the same way there's a skill difference between Platinum and Diamond in Siege?
---
Is anyone gonna talk about how it's practically impossible to pip past rank 4 as Survivor? You need an extremely lucky game as the requirements ramp up quite high, and that's not even accounting for the games you'll swiftly depip because the Killer brought dumb addons and proceeded to sweat his dick off like he was performing as ESL? Nah, that would go against the narrative that Killers are *severely* underpowered. There's still plenty of balancing issues left in this game, such as Mettle of Man, but even Killers in 2016 averaged more than a kill a game barring they were completely new.
---
While it's sad so many of you are this delusional to believe this stats literally proves how UP Killer is, it's quite amusing seeing you all inadvertently admit you get less than one kill a game. Never change, r/deadbydaylight.
---
I used to main nea (she reminded me of Chloe from life is strange. The clothes though, not the face) but now I slowly switched to Jeff. I love Jeff or Jesus
---
This is where I go to masturbate.
---
yeah and my opinion is its boring i dont play this game for BP i play it for fun
---
A seperate objective is sorta already there with totems, but survivors are complaining that they have to do totems to avoid NOED.
---
I thought that said “bananable” at first
---
Pig and Hag, swapping to nurse and spirit if I get bodied
---
I don’t see the issue
---
David (but not shirtless because that always makes me feel cold)
---
Spirit and Fedora man
---
2000 hours and they can't even power through ruin.
---
I’m not 12 I’m 15
---
If you're good at high skill gap killers, pick spirit. She has very good perks and she's very strong if you know how to use her. Other wise I'd suggest clown. He has good perks and he's pretty good+ easy to use
---
Farming is so boring i’d rather play the game how it is supposed to
---
Exactly and now that self heal is eh, might as well stack DS and Dead hard on that :p then there's a ton of little perks that just waste the killers time, like the pebble is used correctly, head On, survivors unhooking themselves and so on
---
Double Sac points would be welcome as its the one status that needs something specific to happen to max (12 hooks)
---
Either that or the killer is nea
---
i honestly don’t see leatherface that much, i probably see more wraith than him (rank 8). the issue isn’t that people aren’t willing to experiment, it’s that they get punished for not using meta killers. that’s why you probably don’t see many freddies, or doctors, or trappers
---
I have custom perk icons not made by me, custom killer icons made by me, working on survivor add-ons and maybe killer add-ons if it's popular. I'll edit with a link to it when I get home.
---
I like all the killers except billy and bubba
---
Yeah it allows you to mori the last survivor regardless if they have been hooked or not
---
I got thermite let’s make a big fucking hole
---
Oh my god, I would have been so sad. I'm so sorry
---
**IMPACT TEXT**
---
Just my two cents on some of the categories:
---
*Party size survival rate is an interesting statistic, but I don't think it says what a lot of people think it says.  It doesn't tell us that SWF is only slightly more effective than solo.  What it does tell us is that when someone levels out at whatever rank they end at, that means they have a more or less 50% survival rate.  I'd be curious how these numbers look at ranks 1 and 15, since a rank 1 survivor could in theory survive more often than the average, since there isn't a way to get ranked higher, which leads into my next point.
---
*Survival rate by rank: 50% average survival rate is good.  I'm real curious why PS4 has that huge dip around rank 10, but I wouldn't be able to explain it.  The huge increase as rank 1 is approached (particularly on PC) basically says that perfect survivors, possibly also in SWF, will outmatch perfect killers.  The big question is what about survivors has the survival rate balanced up until that point.  People do infinites, pallet loop, SWF, etc outside of ranks 3, 2, 1.  So what beyond that are the highest rank survivors doing that is so good?
---
*Highest and lowest kill rates: There is nothing surprising about the console killers with the lowest kill rates.  These are all killers where fast, accurate aiming is required, and that's just not as easy on console for most people.  The most effective killers aren't surprising.  Billy is consistently a popular, powerful pick.  Hag literally starts with Ruin, which is straight up overpowered at lower rank play.  Both Hag and Trapper utilize traps, which newer players are going to struggle with, since they can easily be hard to see and deal with.  I would be curious to see most effective killer per rank (as opposed to most popular by rank, or most effective overall).
---
*Most used survivor perks.  Many of these are well known popular picks.  Self Care, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time.  I bet given enough time Mettle of Man will become more popular, bringing these percents down.  Will it topple these perks?  It sounds like it won't, but more quality options are good for survivors.
---
*Most used killer perks.  Ruin and BBQ &amp; Chili are at the top, of course.  After that though we see a sharp decline.  NOED is popular at the mid and lower ranks here, and I think part of that is because the lack of a perk slot for most of the game hurts a killer who is able to utilize a different perk in its place for that time.  The old argument of "okay, what do you gain by using something else instead?"
---
A Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher aren't surprising either.  It's an opportunity to pull survivors out of the game longer when injured, and then find them while they are spending extra time healing.  Many survivors run self care, so it is immediately obvious that survivors will be healing throughout the trial, else they wouldn't use it in their loadout.  The counter to killers doing this would be to utilize some of the perks that benefit you for being wounded.  Dead Hard doesn't count because most of the time players aren't getting instantly downed anyway.  Many of the perks that benefit survivors for being injured aren't that good, but I also get the sense that despite knowing killers run Sloppy Bitcher and A Nurse's Calling, that's not enough to keep survivors from usually wanting to heal, so maybe this is all balanced.
---
Evan McSwoles because oh his metal costumes and the sound of bear traps going off successfully is music to my ears. Phillip ghost speedo because I always liked his design and simple character background. Also the day he got his Bell was probably the day I sealed the contract of getting him to P3 first. Lastly I play Mr.Stalks a lot. So satisfying pulling people off generators as a T1 Myers in he game or Lerys. These are my only P3 killers and I have been working on others but Legion or Freddy might make it to P2 before the end of the blood hunt.
---
 p3 claudette but unlike other claudettes my clothes are bright as fuck and i never run urban immersion
---
when you really need the bloodpoints as killer so you just hook yourself
---
Still not fixed? I had this over a month ago...
---
Lmao, may your loading screens function properly, and your killers want to farm. I wish thee many bloody party streamers 🙏
---
Wouldnt the opposite be the case though? If you depip purposefully wouldnt the survival rate be a lot lower because that means at rank 1 they get sacrificed and do very few gens or objectives? That makes no sense to me that they manage to escape and DEPIP.
---
Guess
---
Never said I dislike it pal.
---
Can't even gen tap smh my head my head
---
all my game's have been against tunnelers and campers lol, only thing that this stupid event has done is made every single game i play more toxic.
---
farming is boring but honestly, i would prefer farming matches over regular matches. at least until bloodpoints are useless to me. i want to prestige all characters and so far i only have one character fully prestiged. that shit takes a while, u know? so if the killers willing to farm, im more than happy to do it as well - even tho its boring
---
TBH it's the same on both sides. I'm on PS4 as well.
---
When I'm playing as killer, anytime I have a Mori or get off to a great start then I see a disconnect. There's also times where if I'm a survivor and the ping is terrible causing us to teleport everywhere, or killer uses a lag switch, ppl will disconnect quick. And with every disconnect there's bound to be 1-2 more sometimes all 4. Jokes on them tho, they get no points and u get a Quit bonus.
---
As for survivors I have ran into multiple killers who disconnect cause 2 or more gens get done around the same time. That or they get looped, body blocked from hooking someone, blinded, etc. But same as the last section, jokes on the killer, survivors get a Quit bonus. 
---
Generally both sides d/c if the have a bad game. It's just the way it goes I guess. But obviously u will see it more with survivors since it's a 4:1 ratio. Try not to worry too much. U will get that merciless sooner or later. Hang in there bud
---
Oh I wasn't thinking purposefully, just that it's really hard to stay pipped at Rank 1 form what I've heard (I'm nowhere near active enough in the game to have person experience). So then the statistics are taking into account everyone who reaches rank 1, but not the people who lose a match there and then depip to rank 2? That's the way it was explained further up, I'm not doing as good a job of it down here. xD
---
Yes and no. When I break 3 totems and then get chased until the last gen pops, it's not refusing to do totems. It's being unable to and being teamed with absolute potatoes who either don't look for them or don't care about them.
---
They need to finally add a Mori for Nea
---
She's lower A tidler - upper B tier in my opinion. She's very fun to play. I'd definitely say that she's worth it.
---
Oh, wait, the DCs. I thought you were talking about the Half-Life 1 Quality
---
Hag, Myers, Piggy and Legion
---
i would dc lul
---
Killer or Survivor? 'Cause I'm a Killer and cam't find amy Survivors...
---
Trapper, Wraith, and Myers. Kick ass so much they forget to take names.
---
People think the perk is supposed to be named "Everyone Escapes Alive"
---
Ps4 as well.
---
Nice! My exact choices!
---
You don't understand because I never said I had an issue with Ruin billy. I only said Ruin and Noed at the same time
---
And those perks are meant to keep them alive! Our objective is to survive, and we will use perks that do that!
---
I think it’s like when the survivor finishes the unhook bar and you hit them between the time in the finished bar and touching the ground.
---
Oh my God
---
About a month ago, there were about 60 sessions in the DBD community on ps4 and now I can only see 10. No one is playing DBD on ps4
---
I really don't mind playing against Dead Hard and I can't stand using it. I feel like it's only necessary vs Nurse and Spirit. DS isn't a big deal at all anymore. MoM just punishes M1 killers even further than they are already punished (for simply playing an M1 killer).
---
Honestly I just rotate between all the killers after each game but I enjoy playing huntress the most for sure
---
UwU is basically affection. Only use it with someone comfortable with it or for the memes/ironically
---
I do both. I play the game normally, hunt, hit and hook everyone, but after two hooks I let them escape. It helps me further improve my skills as killer, while also getting the BP I need and maybe also getting the poor survs the BP they need. If they didnt do much all game after all hooks are done and I throw em out, then thats on them.
---
you can check out mcleans stream vod where he actually talks about that exact reddit post if you like (i think it starts at pretty much 1 hour mark

Pig for fun. Hillbilly for going for wins
---
They just didn't include him on console versions and left his perks in the general perk pool.
---
I'm kind of surprised that they hadn't headed over there, honestly.

Yeah you’re in middle school I don’t know any mature people watching bodacious horseman

Yeah yeah never said farming ain’t allowed

It's because they feel like it's unfair that they get one shotted down and sacrificed even though the gens are done. You'll get a lot of bad faith answers in this thread, but the simple fact is that they're just too lazy to cleanse totems
---
Meanwhile my event as killer so far has been 4 matches, not including the three times my game crashed in loading screen. Only one of those matches did not have SWF or hookswarming teabag squads who fail their first loop and DC before I have the chance to pick them up.
---
Seems almost everyone is playing killer during the event, making killer queues even longer than normal. Ofc people want to maximize BP gains and if camping survivors not smart enough to lead killer away from hook or tunneling survivors who don't know how to loop, stealth or mindgame is the way to do it, then people will be doing just that.
---
Thank you. Lol.
---
Actually there was a play test and the filament for batteries decrease consumption and a green battery is more light then a green and yellow battery.
---
I literally had a hag camp me yesterday, like dude you literally have a teleport right back to me
---
New survivor, Johnny 2x4.... “Plaaaankkkkk?....what happeneddd......”
---
Space? I’m on PS4...
---
Nea since I started, still nea. Don’t need anyone else right now, I have all the useful teachables.
---
I'm a filthy Altruistic Laurie main (No One Left Behind, We'll Make It, We're Gonna Live Forever, and either Botany Knowledge, Self Care, or Urban Evasion as my fourth perk being my current build for her), with Claudette (SC, BK, Empathy, and either Kindred or WMI) and Kate(BO, WoO, DWM, and UE) as my second and third respectively.
---
This is wholesome. :]
---
Yeah I read too that there's supposedly a 50/50 chance for each box, except the last one which has 100% chance. Makes sense to me, though I seem to rarely be lucky with the coin toss haha.
---
Nah Rather play the game and get the 2x BP
---
It isnt the company its the idea of them doing that to squeeze more money out the people
---
Didn't really talk about it other than "he's lying" (bit of a paraphrase but that's what he implies).
---
Assuming the Reddit user is telling the truth though, the math doesn't add up if what McLean said is true
---
So you think it's unfair that you have to face a perk that isn't active 90 percent of the game and has a hard counter but it's totally fair that newer players have to face an experienced rank 1 survivor?
---
come the fuck on
---
When you say things like MoM can be used more than once, then you better believe that a perk that MANY ALREADY believe is OP will be asked to be nerfed. RIGHT NOW I am focusing on BT but maybe I'll start focusing on MoM too.
---
If I ever run pink heads I make a point to not reveal the add on until later when everyone has gotten enough blood points to make the DC a hard choice, but I only run iridescent against SWF   I didn’t like that I run into again
---
BoJack Horseman is made for young adults, the content and messages it portrays is literally meant for young adults to relate to, have you watched it? I dont suggest watching it now because you wouldnt get what it's about, like your literally not emotionally developed enough to understand, that isnt an insult by the way its literal fact. The themes are complex and dark in a way where you wouldnt know what's really going on at any moment, the surface level of the show is really funny, but knowing what's really going on is another entire layer, which you most likely wouldnt understand
---
The cunt also let me die! 
---
I died that hook. Two other survivors did gens and were being chased by Trapper. She hid in a locker!
---
I’ve just tried both killer and survivor before giving up. usually don’t have a problem finding game
---
So relatable. Every 1 - 2 games after a Trapper game have me checking for traps in the first 5 minutes.
---
I'm beyond corn blind with Hag. Don't beat yourself up over it. She's so damn short and corn is OP
---
Thank you so much!!! It means a lot
---
Nope. Cosmetics mean nothing except that either they have a lot of hours in the game, or have money to spend on it (this coming from someone who has bought at least one outfit from every set they've released recently). 
---
The exception is legacy. If I see legacy I admire that shit. There is no killing or surviving, only admiring.
---
Feng and Tapp
---
Also Balanced Landing is arguably really good but I don't see it anywhere in these stats lol. I also see lots of people running it, which makes the stats even weirder.
---
Lol RIP survivors.
---
Didn’t they say they were thinking about changing Self-Care because it’s “too much of a crutch perk and everyone’s running it” but like killers use the same 4 (very strong)perks across all ranks... 🤔 hmmm
---
but how are you supposed to kill anyone as a M1 killer ?
---
tapping is for people who can't stick the skill check reliably. Hell, I'm a killer main and ruin doesn't bother me any.
---
Consoles are just store fronts.  It's like when they had character-specific licenses for Soul Calibur games on PS4, Xbox, and Gamecube. Or this recent thing where PS4 versions of DMC5 are censoring butt cracks.
---
Epic is just another store front.  I'm pretty sure that Bill is only allowed on steam, so I doubt that he would appear on an Epic Games version.
---
Useing
---
Happy days
---
Bloodhunt should be a once a month thing, not once every 5-6 months thing.
---
Thanks. The wiki does not specify aura's for Amanda's Letter, it only specifies outlines of survivors. However, it does specify generator aura's when it comes to the Surveillance perk. Strange.
---
P3 Michael's usually have infinite tier 3 against me
---
*cries in doctor running ruin on console on Anna's map*
---
I agree. I prefer the old borrowed time. They should bring back the old borrowed time but make it useless against insta down perks or add ons. Same with MoM. It shouldn’t go off if you hit the injured person when they have the exposed effect.
---
You must be that one guy that keeps dodging me when I'm the only one in the lobby :o
---
I dont see this statistic on the site? Where can I find it?
---
I dunno, something like Hex: Mega Farm may help.  Maybe killers near you just suck.  I've gotten into several games where the killers were all about farming -- I guess it really is just their choice.
---
EXACTLY!   
---
This is one of those situations where the devs really nailed it. They added in spots to better hide totems, thus making hex perks a little more viable (still fucking hate hexes as a killer main, but w/e), but ALSO gave survivors clever little hiding spots to quickly lose LOS on the killer.
---
Well put! I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to quote you under a reply to the person that asked the question. Thanks for taking the time!
---
I never pointed out any typos... but yeah exactly you just proved my point, you dont get the show yet, and that's cool, but I'm just saying, wait a while, a long while, and look back on it, I guarentee you'll have a 100% different understanding. Also I have nothing to gain from one upping a random 15 year old on the internet, what would that give me
---
NOED as a crutch and NOED as part of an end game build are very different things to me. I'll never get salty over a killer that actually knows how to play who uses Blood Warden/Remember Me/NOED. I don't like seeing killers that legitimately don't know how to loop tiles get rewarded with 3k or 4k games because of NOED and potato survivors, but it is what it is
---
i absolutly agree. the whole mechanic around the RBT is kinda stupid. but then again i cant find myself liking any mechanic that is as rng based as the RBT.
---
yea i really grew to like his stream a lot lately. cool guy and one of the devs that is actually quite decent at the game :p i like how openly he talks about dev stuff without spilling any cruical stuff
---
Are they still counting DCs as kills? If so, is skewed.
---
Yeah, ok. I'll give ya that one.
---
“Wasn’t the show about being bad”
---
“Class A line right there”
---
Oh that's a tough one. Me personally I'd have to go with Ash but I'm not anywhere near your level lol. My highest character is Claudette at 40 for self care teachable.
---
There'll always be top of the line meta perks
---
Something has to be top
---
But self care is just crazy powerful and goes against the teamplay aspect the game has. Everyone runs it and it makes being injured less of a problem. 
---
Play without self care and you become so much more fragile and careful cause you can't heal on demand or can only heal so many times with a medkit
---
There's tons of cool perks to run but it always feel like Adrenaline, self care and an exhaustion perk are necessary perks to run
---
&gt;The Pigs Ultra Rare add-on: Amanda's Letter, it reduces you to 1 Reverse bear trap, and reduces the amount of Jigsaw boxes in the trial grounds by 1, but grants her a 12m radius of Aura vision while she's crouched. He also equipped another add-on of hers that gives him 1 more RBT otherwise he'd only have 1 of them.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Also if a gen is white or Yellow due to the Surveillance perk, survivors Auras show up brightly against that, and he also had BBQ &amp; Chili which reveals the auras of all survivors further than 40m from you after you hook someone.
---
Like TWiXT122 said below, the surveillance shows generator auras after they've been kicked. They'll be white until a survivor starts working on one again, then they go yellow. 
---
If it's one of the times that the survivors were really close when the auras were shown, it's the pink letter. If it's when they were far away, it's bbq and chili.
---
I had 3 BPS an escape cake and some luck bonus. 3 man group at the time. My DBD crashes. Another of us just doesn't load in and so doesn't the random. My last friend is solo against a hag who pretty much Insta kills him. Then in end chat goes "I'm a moron I didn't even realise you were the only person in the game wtf happened" wtf is DBD rn
---
hey, sorry to request anything but i'm a freddy main and i was wondering if you could some freddy dlc themed perks. just asking. not demanding.
---
PEOPLE WHO SAY "RESPECT THE 4%"SINCERELY.
---
I sure hope I'm reading this wrong, and excuse me if I am, but are you trying to say that survivors shouldn't do their job?? If you're defending a killer tunneling/camping a survivor for bringing a toolbox into the match and doing gens (again, the survivors' **job**), I don't even know what to say.
---
God no please no. I like playing the game not having every killer and half the survivors trying to farm. I want to play.
---
Full p3 usually means hard tunnel/tryhard. Even more likely the more time the killers been out.
---
Everyone knows the teacher is best girl.
---
“Wah! These survivors want to play the game and not farm they’re toxic! Wah”
---
that's not "camping more efficiently" fuck off
---
fucking christ
---
What? Its the single best perk in the game against nurse.
---
That alone puts it above the other exhaustion perks.
---
are you a crybaby survivor simulator
---
Yknow you don’t need to farm to get blood points
---
Looks good for a start, my only complaints are that the first perk feels a little strong (maybe change the penalty to 20%, or have it induce Exhaustion on the survivor for x amount of time?) while the second perk feels a little weak (maybe have it give you a token each time you use it, and each token grants +X% BP, or maybe have it so that your wiggle meter is automatically increased X%?)
---
I've been called scary a few times on Spirit. Love those rare wholesome postgame chats.
---
Rewards bad killers for not applying enough pressure*
---
Yeah i am thinking of going with ash too, my claudette already has dome good perks and I really like ash so i may just do that.
---
Killers are allowed to use add-ons, but survivor are not allowed to use items, you know that. :D
---
nice emerald look to the perks

---
That's funny.
---
Wait where on the home screen? I've never noticed that before
---
I'd love for Survivors to be more unique. Some people have proposed passives and shit, I don't think that's the way to go.
---
Right now they're essentially reskins of the Survivor role, they need something that individualizes them other than their height and skin color.
---
Killers get BP faster, BP event occurs, run into less rank 20 P3 squadettes and a lot more basement camping killers.
---
Big think.png
---
I had devour hope there a few weeks ago and was finally able to get the kill all survivors by your own hand trophy.
---
Wtf survivor buffs are you talking about? Also, use the load out distressing, unnerving presence, iron maiden, and ruin... boom. Easy 4ks... your Twitter radius while in treatment mode will help root out survivors who are hiding. Iron maiden will expose them if they hide in lockers which most do against a doctor. Ruin is just obvious. Then unnerving presence makes skill checks hard as fuck to hit. Though you can switch this with that one clown perk (forget the name but makes healing harder and slower in your terror radius) or even swap it with huntress lullaby. That way as you hook people they get less notifications about skill checks mixed with the fact that the skill checks pop up at random spots on the screen....
---
So yeah, doctor is mid tier but in the right hands he can dip into the top tier.
---
... Then your problem clearly lies with how your teammates act, and not NOED itself. NOED shouldn't be changed because you don't like how your teammates perform.
---
I love trapper. Some games can be over in a couple minutes if you randomly catch multiple people in traps and sometimes i'm hustling to get traps to create a minefield around the hatch. The higher I get the harder it is for me though so maybe I should learn others.
---
So true xD
---
I sympathize. I've only run into tryhards since the event started.
---
Matchmaking would be based on your skills, not ranks that could be manipulated by DC-ing.
---
Dude. There is so much to that scene that's unsaid. Basically, her entire life was for the purpose of defeating the night king. 
---
For example, when she was running through the castle, it was as if she was back in training chasing cats. And the trick attack she used is the same one that was used against her when she was training. 
---
And the dagger is also the same dagger that was used in the assassination attempt against bran. 
---
I'm sure I missed a hunch of other things as well. But it's a very in-depth scene that ends with a very climactic triumph of arya.
---
What is MLGA?
---
I stopped putting them in, I am just using those cakes. Everyone is selfish as fuck
---
What about
---
toxic survivor: tbag and flashlight spam
---
5th gen: gets completed
---
Other survivors \*body block\* toxic survivior
---
the toxic survivor:
---
I saw a poat on the sub a few days agos where a guy did the stats and proved you get off on the 1st Box like 50% of the time. And the devs said that its innaccurate but i dont trust the devs on shit anymore they could lie to us and we'd never notice.
---
Yeah, i'm about as hardcore a killer main as you can get, and i even think that prayer beads are bullshit. How BHVR ever fucking let something that powerful in the game is beyond me.
---
Ruin should be reworked. Most survivors cannot deal with it unless it's in an obvious place
---
The corn is an abomination and too hard to see in for killer
---
map balance is needed. too often pallet spawns are insane and will create total dead zones while a pallet city exists elsewhere
---
As a killer main, I feel that NOED gives to much for too little. It makes me feel guilty. Instead I use devour hope. You gotta work for your insta downs and Ive had a few survivors say that its like the fun version of NOED. Gets the adrenaline pumping for the killer and survivor rather than just, I see you *Dead*.
---
Did you just call a severed pig head cute?
---
You must have been getting unlucky. I would usually get 1-2 bps a game last night.
---
Imo perk recolors, don't effect gameplay for others, however mlga does which shouldn't be allowed since the main reason it was used in the first place is to detect ping which it already does in lobby.
---
Using mlga to "ban" certain players so you don't have to play against them should result in a ban because that gives a unfair competitive edge.
---
I guess you can use that but that’s only if you want to use a perk slot just to increase efficiency for those items.
---
Is there still a good way to get into a 5 man lobby? I mean the killer is a friend. I think this was easy to get by changing the steam server location in the steam setting. Anyone has any input on that?
---
People need to stoo DCing.
---
Perhaps they just want to play the game as it was intended to be played? Have that thought occurred in your mind at some point?
---
Would that cost a bear trap though? Any Trapper worth his salt knows he needs to make use of every trap.
---
I’d guess he’s doing all of them, and they don’t take super long to come out, so even if he doesn’t do them next I’d bet you’ll get them soon anyways
---
I'd argue it's because survivors have a lot more "fantastic"-tier perks to choose from. They have a lot more "tank/avoid a third hit" perks that are all fantastic; the killer equivalent are "one hit down", which is basically just NOED. The other ones are much, much more conditional (Rancor, etc).
---
You know, this game is not enjoyable as a solo in low ranks. Just because you lose a game doesn’t mean you should start camping for your ego smh
---
Just wait in a lobby with him selected
---
go for the cuteness, but P3 anyway because shes worth it
---
5 mins literally isn't anything. It could be much worse. And you answered your own question. It's the bloodhunt. The game has a lot of traffic now. Take your 5 mins and wait again. Join the party.
---
Yeah, I don't use NOED myself, mostly because I'd just rather have 4 perks all game. And I definitely agree on Devour. It's a staple of my Freddy builds.
---
lol
---
yep, this map is dumb.
---
Also auras are almost completly invisible.
---
I wish the doctor had a addon to extend the time at which after a survivor is shocked they can't interact with a pallet or window, maybe it is already a addon.
---
I got to rank one with huntress. Realised I had no fun as her, deranked to 10 one rank reset, then trapper with devour hope all the way.
---
I think the volume is fine, but the actual sound is a little too similar to a totem being cleansed
---
Jesus, no need to get so toxic.
---
Oh shit I forgot to tell you, dude I'm 18, I'm not some old guy, that's why I'm explaining stuff to you
---
Yes!  Where's my ruin.....?   Dunno!
---
When you're guaranteed to survive, that's a problem. BT needs a nerf and maybe MoM needs one as well!
---
I don't know why but my game actually has no noise for the chainsaw don't know if that's a game feature or if my game is that fucked
---
oh my gosh yah the hex you cant see them on the map
---
Exactly!
---
I chose to main Kate Denson because she looks the most like me irl. She’s got the straight blonde hair cosmetic (which comes with... glasses, unfortunately... but whatever), ripped up pants because I never got over my punk rock phase, and a plaid shirt. I love me some plaid, though I wish all her stuff didn’t show her midriff.
---
If they added an oversized Led Zeppelin shirt for her, and the hair **without** glasses, that’d be perfect.
---
A lot of people don't like playing against Freddy. I don't mind going against him, but I guess a lot of survivors find him annoying
---
They were working on other stuff too. BHVR can't just fix what you want. everyone downvotes me for being sensible so I might as well deserve the downvotes. This community is utter trash, full of entitled people who dont know anything about making games, yet they talk to bHVR like it's the easiest thing to do and you all expect bHVR to fix 50 bugs all at the same time, just shut the fuck up.
---
r/woooosh
---
Hope you get stuck in a wall lol
---
Four of those and a Mori sums it up nicely
---
People from October 2017 hehe :P
---
It's like a weird fusion of The Hag, The Witch, and The Spitter.
---
it allows u to jump
---
THERES NO PROBLEM WITH PICKING THEM UP OR LEAVING THEM. PERKS LIKE DEERSTALKER CAN ACTUALLY BE USEFUL AND I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF NURSE PLAYERS WILL SLUG EVERYONE TO INSURE A 4K. ALSO YOU CAN USE BBQ OR PASSIVE POWER PERKS OR ADDONS LIKE AITH FREDDY. IN FACT I USED TO BE A SLUGGING HUNTRESS AT ONE POINT. 
---
MY ISSUE IS ADDING YET ANOTHER KILLER ABILITY THAT REALY ISNT NEEDED AT ALL AND IS ALSO UNBALANCED AND UNFAIR AGAINST THE SURVIVORS. IT ALSO MAKES NO SENSE REALISTICALLY SPEAKING. THAT TINY BIT OF HEALING WONT HURT YOU IF YOURE GOOD ENOUGH. AND IF ITS A COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE SURVIVORS OF COURSE THERES A RISK OF BEING OUTPLAYED. 
---
ALSO IM SORRY IF THIS COMES OFF CUNTY BUT I AM STILL REQUIRED TO SCREAM.
---
ELI5: Whats with all the custom icons recently?
---
Exactly my man. Not sure I'm getting downvoted, but I agree.
---
 🙏  🙏  🙏  🙏
---
I went with 30% because it's just a slow an I feel like 70% killer speed for maximum 3 secs is not so bad, but now that I just did literally any math at all I see your point. A 30% reduction drops the speed to 80m while the surviver gets the 50% speed boost off the hit giving them a 150m speed creating quite a deficit.
---
20% would drop it to..92(?) Which still seems a little much but I feel like I would need to feel it in game. So I'm going to change that for sure. 
---
I feel like tokens for BPs would be a little too much of stepping on WGLF's metaphorical toes.
---
But the struggle sounds good, but I'm not sure if it can be implemented without either being horribly OP or horribly UP an I see no middle ground...hmm
---
Very mature of you to offend other people. Not everyone has your opinion and yet I do not insult you.
---
I keep saying that the tactic of killing people with for example facecamp is just not exciting, effective or great. My opinion.
---
And it remains that killers sometimes dodge lobbies, if survivor have an item in their hand.
---
I love you too!
---
Shut your up
---
David gonna get the shirtless version at some point
---
I can't sympathize, expecting killers/survivors to farm is ludacris imo!
---
Groovy.
---
Yeah, I agree, it's like every other game now.
---
We're not complaining about killers playing effectively. Killers who are good deserve the win and more blood points. All I said was killers are camping and tunneling just for the 2x blood points on 1 guaranteed kill, and that if they actually play the game well they can get a lot more. Also, your reasoning makes no sense. Survivors try to speed up the game to win, they're doing exactly what they're supposed to. Killers are doing the same thing. I don't understand what you're trying to get across lmao
---
i wasn’t so lucky :(
---
What rank are you? I just got done playing for the past few hours on PS4. Played my first two games as survivor and then the rest were killer. My 2 survivor games I found almost instantly. The killer games took anywhere from 2 or 3 minutes to find a full game. A few were found quicker. I'm rank 12 as killer and 18 as survivor (I don't play survivor much lol).
---
I've delt with the opposite. Sweaty killer mains
---
Im on PC. I can't even imagine playing nurse on console.  30 fps,  no way. I can play well with a controller pad, but the 30 fps would make that 2nd blink almost impossible.
---
IF YOU GET HIT THAT LONG AFTER VAULTING THE KILLER IS LAG SWITCHING, IT'S NOT JUST BAD PING
---
They just need to.instaban once you click the button. Just an hour ban.
---
Yes, double bloodpoint weekend started 15 hours ago and lasts until the 5th.
---
oh god,rank 18 Urban Evasion players ruined it didn’t they?
---
I love Devour Hope but I had to remove it after game after game people found it before i got to 3 stacks.
---
The one week im actually looking for 4 man SWFs, I only find single players all using brown bloodpoint offerings
---
Add an exit timer. When you press "leave" you will face a 10-second timer before it actually disconnects you. If you press anything during this 10-second period you will stop the disconnecting process. This way any salty survivor won't be able to DC out of spite and it will encourage them to finish the game regardless of how poorly they performed.
---
I know that ultra rare addons shouldn't be taken into account, but if she's using the one that gives auras on vomiting survivors against people who don't cleanse then she's a perma tier 3 Michael with Freddy wallhacks, which is big lol.
---
They shouldn't have been a dismissive little shit behind my back.
---
Nah, not an hour immediately. Rocket League has a decent ban system, if you leave a ranked game then you get 15 minutes, if you do it again it escalates every time. I think that'd be better, cause the game just randomly kicks people as well and makes it look like DC's. Don't want those people to get punished for the game sucking ass :/
---
Wow mate this is some Groovy shit.
---
damn teenagers and their hippity hopity dance routines
---
bet thanks for the info
---
I don't like hearing the terror radius when I'm on a different level. I understand the map is unique in that regard but its annoying for me at least
---
Im a freddy/Myers main.
---
That's part of the risk and gameplay you agree to undertake when you click the "play solo" button.
---
I feel it needs to be significant enough to just stop it.
---
Make Lobbies Great Again. It's a java plug in that examines when someone's IP hooks into your internet (at least that's the most basic explanation I can find). It shows you the real time ping of Killers in match if you are a Survivor and allows you to see the real time ping of Survivors in match as Killer.   
---
I use it just to make sure I'm not hitting an infinite load since I have a bug in my download.
---
“Make lobbies great again” let’s you more accurately see the pings of everyone else in the lobby as well as block certain pings.
---
Yeah that's a location and it's really dumb. I sometimes like to hide there as Survivor when I hear the Terror Radius.
---
eliminate as many sources of rng as possible. im talking hex totem spawn (the whole mechanic is just rng lackluster), piggy RBTs, skillchecks on autodidact and the list goes on. if we can get as much rng out and more constant ways to outplay the opponent in i think that would make the game better for everybody
---
Wait, bloodhunt is active?
---
Oooh so grown up dude I don’t care
---
excuse me? what this sounds like is you're a toxic killer main who is mad because you're getting genrushed. It happens to all of us, calm down. You're the only one being aggressive here. In a competitive game like this, both sides obviously try their best to win. Survivors win by doing gens, killers win by killing survivors. Are you saying you just want everyone to farm? Also yes, I'm aware killlers get more points if they don't camp/tunnel, that's literally what you got mad at in the first place
---
So I teabagged to see what happend.  Noting changed but a random guy on the street saying "That guy is a gamer".
---
Haven’t played much since the last rank reset, so probably near the bottom
---
I slept at 2 am and can't wait to put more  survivors on the BBQ stick when I get back from work.
---
Wait why wouldn’t you run BBQ in a no event
---
Wait then why emphasize I'm old
---
I'm telling your I'm Not old
---
I said you’re a young adult aka older than me
---
Now hang on just a second
---
Bloody head, reg body, Bloody weapon
---
I didn’t even now about this spot.
---
Very sneaky indeed.
---
I agree. If he was the same size as Claudette he would be impossible to find
---
Can't wait because they are so beautiful.
---
Ash probably unhooked himself running that perk that gives him 100% chance to escape hook if he unhooked another survivor.  Can't think of the name of it because I only have like two survivors that are worth a shit.
---
To quote my friend from a Discord call I was having with him the other day:
---
&gt;Okay so I'm standing beside a gen hitting it and these Survivors all run around pallets and teabag me? Like how dense are these people why the hell would I be hitting gens if I didn't want to farm.
---
~
---
&gt;This Nea sabotages every hook in the area then runs into a corner and teabags me. Post game chat she complains why I didn't farm. How the fuck am I supposed to tell that you sabotaging every hook in existence and then running away from me means that you want to farm?
---
&gt;Three of you guys had Brand New Parts. I'm not fucking farming with you.
---
Just watch this and you'll understand
---
https://youtu.be/r2tA-0JH-is
---
And I play both killer and survivor equally just in case if you tell me that the facts are wrong and that I'm a petty survivor main
---
Okay old man
---
Different actions I’d bet
---
are you a piece of shit?
---
Behind your back? What are you talking about?
---
Lol imagine thinking noed isn’t a crutch
---
can u do not
---
Lockers be one time use, then the door breaks. Unused perk slots grant 25% bp bonus for p3 only. All killers have a universal 30 second cool down "terrifying scream" that creates a difficult skill check if you're on a gen. Perk that allows killers to repair totems.
---
If i dont see Ruin i literally expect and EZ Escape
---
There are not millions and millions of players in rank 1, and the ranking system is broken rn as well
---
IM SADLY A POTATO PLAGUE BUT I WILL SAY REMEMBER TO SPIT ON LITERALLY EVERYTHING TO INFECT IT. ESPECIALLY LOOPS. MOST PLAGUES IVE SEEN WAIT UNTIL YOUR BROKEN FIRST AND WILL JUST KEEP SPITTING TO INCREASE THE INFECTION RATE, BUT IDK OF THATS HELPFUL IM SORRY. YOU COULD ALWAYS MAKE A POST ASKING PLAGUE MAINS FOR TIPS TOO.
---
You need to get a one x then. I get 23 fps easy.
---
I mean... if they intended people to play with their friends. They clearly expected comms.
---
imo the yoink build is the best.. m&amp;a +ruin + discordance + 1 perk (corrupt intervention).. m&amp;a makes it so you can start phase walking towards a Gen that is being worked on outside your terror radius and yoink them off the Gen coming out of phasing
---
If it was really bannable,90% of the Killer players from Xbox in Brazil would be banned.
---
and so begins the lobby simulator.
---
&gt; Lockers be one time use, then the door breaks.
---
don't nerf iron maiden pls
---
They have literally said they did not intend for people to play on comms. I just told you what they said. Also, the fact that they have done little to balance around comms feeds into that.
---
You are going to get lynched for saying this just a heads up
---
It says after being exposed and downed from a BASIC attack. Hillbilly and lf dont insta down with basic attacks so it would only work against myers and situational perks. Not a good rework
---
holy shit this is game changing information
---
They should fix their game first,then do something like that.
---
Very true, I was on a bp grind yesterday for about 6 hours (PS4) and I guess every survivor had the same idea and used were gonna live forever so no one was doing gens because they were too busy trying to save every hooked person. As for killers, the usual camping and tunneling that happens even when there isn’t a blood hunt. 
---
Unrelated question, killer mains feel free to reply to this: when you’re tier 3 madness, was it always intended to not let you do anything, such as heal yourself or others, vault windows, do gens?
---
Valve being Valve.
---
I personally agree with this but oh boy 90% of the sub won’t like this
---
Other than being Mr. Default, there's really not much more satisfying than a well placed bear trap.
---
Had it happen once loaded into a lobby with four different TTV streamers not well known ofc but regardless got hooked with one gen done leatherface didnt even camp they all got out. I had to switch to my spare mouse after that game
---
She's rough without perks.  Thankfully I'm still in the lower ranks that don't realize they should crouch walk to their hooked friends or deal with Make Your Choice.
---
Every game I just hear constant chainsaws with almost zero downtime, if nurse gets fatigued after blinking why doesn’t hillbilly have some kind of downside to a insta down ability? Doesn’t make any sense as far as game balance.
---
yeah exactly, i know its a small chance but it still scares me :/
---
hhhhhhh
---
This type of stats reveal was done ~2 years ago and Hag had the highest kill rate. Apparently even new killers, killer nerfs and buffs, and different maps didn't change that.
---
I main Survivor, but when I do play Killer, it's always the Trapper. He's the pick up and play type of Killer, with no special timings or gimmiks to learn. This is why it is very easy to translate your Survivor experience on him: map awareness, general Survivor routes &amp; tactics and perks knowledge.
---
Oh no don't be. I get why. it's the internet.
---
It's kinda sad to see almost no perk variety.
---
too simialr to CI imo if that was the case. and speaking of which, i think CI isn't that good but at least it's interesting
---
Thanks! I also like Ace Capone lol
---
Its on the front page of the internet, its got as much to do with anyone as it does with you lol, see look im involved now, stop me.
---
That screen name totally appeared in one of my games and did exactly that. We might have been in the same game, lol.
---
Nea is the entity
---
Legion and spirit. I find these two the most fun to play as. Spirit for some jumpscares and mind games and legion for some interesting chases
---
I do as well we should add eachother. What time do you usually play?
---
It's annoying but I'd say it's fairly balanced now
---
i dont think so because its both good for the killer and survivor for killer it slows the game a little bit and for survivor i makes them better at the game when it comes down to generator skill checks its a win-win
---
The patience meta is upon us
---
:(
---
To be fair maybe she was anticipating BBQ? I mean it was very recently in shrine and a large percentage of killers are running it now because of it.
---
Honestly they don’t have to be low rank for this to happen, high ranks do it too. Played a match yesterday where I got hooked, someone was working on a gen while another was making their way to me but got found, and the last survivor was a p3 Claudette literally just urban evading around. I died on first hook.
---
no kidding. if you look at his account it's just toxic comment after toxic comment. some people are just assholes ig
---
Not doing the objective and only hiding is a bannable offence I believe. It's called keeping the game hostage. You can report them and bhvr will most likely do fuck all about it
---
I switch off between We'll Make It and BT, depending on what the team wants. I would preferably only ever use We'll Make It because it's super powerful and applicable to every game. But each time I use it, I unhook someone, they get the notification that I can super heal them, and they just run away to another universe.
---
buy a pc
---
i think the main problem is the totem spots are really bad most of the time i think we need to find ways to make them more hidden
---
Thanks. But yeah, like you said. BHVR will do fuck all about it.
---
It’s the other way around
---
I was giving examples to explain my point. Again, none of my comment was aimed at how you specifically play the game. It was a comment largely on how I have experienced my games since the double BP event started. 
---
I play 50/50 on killer and survivor. I'm only rank 8 on survivor so I'm not terrible but not great either. I was simply giving my opinion on "respecting the bloody party streamers." mentality.
---
Most survivors, even good ones, don't buckle down and just work through Ruin. And good survivors still hit more good skill checks than ruin skill checks. and good survivors will still work on gens with ruin with other survivors
---
go and watch videos by objectively good players who play with other players around their skill level and compare their games when they have ruin versus when they don't. it's noticeable
---
Tried doing this with my friends all night long.
---
All Killers played the most scummiest way possible, being sure to reach Levels of Maximum Camping and Tunneling.
---
I get it if you dont want to farm and just wanna play, what I dont get is why you decide to ALSO play camping.
---
Also, all of them, NOED gamers. Wtf. This is what makes me hate NOED, is not NOED itself, but the fact that is such a Symbol of Toxicity.
---
honestly, just go and do something else while letting those Idiots waste their time.
---
And Endgame collapse will be the end to such Bull shit
---
Or killers should just play how they feel and you should just be comfortable with the idea that it's a popular perk because it has a lot of utility. You have to put up with Ruin just like killers have to put up with MoM and BT.
---
Some people just don’t know the correct usage of this perk.
---
For instance,the killer didn’t spot you,you’re behind and object small enough for you to crouch and not be seen,the killer is going around the Object,you go around it using UE and most likely you won’t be seen.
---
Definitely. What I'm saying is a bad killer who had a bad game can snowball a game with a perk.
---
Weekdays I am usually on around 6 pm PST until about 9 pm. Then weekends it's random, could be for 12 hours could be for 3. How's about yourself? Also do you really want to deal with a pleb lol
---
Had a david dc on me last night because I picked him up bc I wanted that fat bbq stack. Was gunna let him teammates unhook him as I brought party streamers and wanted to be nice n let them farm a lil. But he dc’d n got nothin lol
---
Wraith, Trapper and Piggy need new moris, the three are uninspiring af
---
monstrous shrine was nice
---
Just use ruin to slow the game down just a little bit.
---
I watch alot of YouTubers like Monto or Noob3 and Monto can easily finish a gen while working through ruin and so can many others. Even I can get through a ruin gen without too many problems
---
I’ve sadly been that Meg before, and felt awful when I’ve failed and ended up killing a teammate as a result. Desperately trying to save the teammate with a pallet that doesn’t go down until after the fact is infuriating. Couldn’t tell you how many times I should have gotten a save only to watch the killer teleport away and the pallet to fall 5 seconds later. The standing there watching you get carried away pretty much says all. 
---
“WTF NOOO HOW DIDNT THAT WORK.”
---
Even when I time it right, 9/10 times my pallet saves never work because of connection.
---
I wish more people were like you
---
Exact same thing is happening to me rn, servers are probably broken
---
you're taking this a bit too seriously, if they put SWF into the game they obviously intended people to play together, regardless of comms or not lmao
---
based on stats they released SWF isn't even that problematic and everybody overexaggerates it (like you are right now)
---
I play with current purple and red rank players and it's a problem for them there, too. you can go and watch videos of good killers playing with good survivors and compare videos where Ruin is used versus when it isn't. there is an objective difference
---
I mean the endgame collapse wouldn't of even affected this. But I am praising it already.
---
Yes, crouch everywhere and start running at random points for short intervals while making the angry noises. Or run around gripping your hand then releasing in a certain direction and shrieking like Nurse. Or do the same but then laugh like Doc.
---
I stopped using mine because you'd have 4/5 and get tunnel-camp-fucked into the void because the killer wanted a quick and over game. :S
---
I find myself hunting for this spot on maps all the time now. Frequently a game ending totem spot but also a decent hiding place!
---
Yeah, they should have included the sample size its probably very small for the rank 1 category.
---
I really like it if killer play hard. Escpecially if they play well, they destroy the team in a few minutes. Totally okay and fair. But these people play so well that they don't even need to camp or tunnel other players. Yesterday I had a wraith who played really well, but did not even tunnel someone. So everyone had a good and fair game and it was a lot of fun and he owned us. But everyone got a lot of BP from the event.
---
On the other hand, there are also these killers who play really well and just slug around and then camp. In the end they have around 15k BP and wasting so much time. They could have got so much more from the Bloodhunt, Partystreamers and fun.
---
Yeah I’ve rarely ever seen a killer without noed it’s practically a game mechanic at low ranks instead of a perk
---
It's true about the skill checks. I've been playing for like two years and I still struggle with getting 'greats' because latency makes things sort of unpredictable.
---
Kinda the same. I used to be on everyday after 6 bc thats when my group gets on, but the fiances been wanting me off more, so i usually try to wake up early and play from about 7am CST to noon. Although i do still get to play evenings sometimes. Really depends. And yeah i usually play for at least 2 or 3 hours at a time, but sometimes i go for 6+ lol
---
Preach!
---
I still don’t know why people choose NOW to use all their mori’s
---
I play on PS4 and almost every time I have an action to preform, like the gen skill check, vaulting, or attacking a survivor, the game’s frame rate drops and I mess it up.
---
sorry not everyone can afford high end graphic cards stop being a prick
---
My work schedule is kinda all over the place so i will be on weekdays and weekends depending
---
yeah but i want at least 5 players not any lower and i also want bloodpoints and i want to play killer with another killer
---
the vast, vast majority of players are not like that. and you know it. monto was actually someone i had in mind. his killer videos where he doesn't have ruin always have many more gens popped than ones where he has it, where survivors often barely hit two gens
---
added
---
Yeah the fiance does come before games often i'd imagine. You kinda want to keep them happy lol. Hit me up then, PSN is Thebiggyreigns.
---
Hope so. Really looking forward to the doc or wraith’s icons 😁😁
---
I was just poking at ya man, sorry you took it that way lol.
---
I can understand that, but the Trapper went after the other two survivors doing gens. There was no heartbeat around us to cause her to hide lol!
---
Maybe it was a kid playing or something?
---
david dead hard and wglf, ash mettle, laurie ds. (Ds was gutted but is now incredibly useful due to people farming you without borrowed time.)
---
I don't think Deja Vu rn is shit. It can help prevent a 3 gen strategy, a strategy that can easily turn a good game into a bad game if the killer utilizes it effectively. I will admit, giving a gen repair boost would be nice, but I don't think they would add it because of the recent patches trying to remove gen rushing.
---
Never even remotely implied that he said that there is something wrong. And what massive advantage exactly? "I'm being chased, do gens"? "Can some me off the hook"? And none of us can't do flashlight saves worth a damn. Slightly better coordination isn't a massive advantage for a casual swf. On solo, you just have to make educated guesses and stay observant.  Guy on other side of the map hooked? I don't go for him until he is almost second state. Teammate  being chased? HUD changes and the entity's claws wiggle when the obsession. Solo is only bit more harder because you really need to be observant and pay attention to every little detail in the game.
---
When your guaranteed a kill, that’s a problem. NoEd needs a nerf and maybe Rancor needs one as well!
---
Always the case with double BP events. Too many people play killer, so not enough survivors to go around
---
Claudette (not toxic though!)
---
Oh I see what you meant now. Yeah that would be nice
---
I love WMIT but ya, they always zoom off and I'm just standing there like....this could've taken literally 5 seconds and we both could of been on our way. 
---
I've just started leaving those people. If you won't let me heal you, then I'm not going to bother.
---
Will do next time, I got out by using an old trick: I said I would give her a foot rub for 1hour per foot. We home in like 5min. I can try it on my neighbour.
---
BT is a weak perk unless the gates are open
---
&gt; Or killers should just play how they feel and you should just be comfortable with the idea that it's a popular perk because it has a lot of utility.
---
clearly it's bad for the game, though. survivors are unable to deal with it effectively at all. it's been out *for years* and survivors still struggle with it at every rank a lot
---
My typical generic meta loadout is self care, balanced landing, mettle of man and adrenaline
---
*Gets moried instantly*
---
I circled it just in case a few players would think the maximum is on the right instead of left. Meant for very new players.
---
It’s supposed to be a tracking perk for killers once you find someone you have no use for ruin but some terrible killers feel the need to protect it
---
Spine Chill (knowing when the killer's looking at you can give you so much info and allow you to make better decisions) 
---
Balanced Landing (almost useless on some maps, but fucking godlike on others, turns otherwise deadzones into the most safe spots on the map and allows you to run some places for a long time)
---
Bond (find others for healing, to learn the game more easily and many other things)  
---
Adrenaline (You should always have it. people expect everyone to have it)
---
I agree that noed doesn't reward for playing badly, it's just hands down too rewarding
---
I’m trying both
---
Honestly that would be even better.
---
it's also dependent on where the wheel pops up. not every skill check is going to be placed so that you have 3/4 of a second to register it, and you'll mostly be hitting goods on the quicker ones and blowing the check if you try for a great on those quick ones. people really in here acting like survivors hit greats like they're playing whack-a-mole lol
---
No, the right is totaling up how much BP I have in my account in total now, which was not what I wanted to show.
---
Ruin is useless when people are actually good. don't look for it, learn to go through it. Killer who runs it is FUCKED if people are good at landing skillchecks
---
I'm not expecting them to always farm but I've seen so many moris and ultra rare add-ons since the event started
---
I WISH I had any on survivor, I only have envelopes mostly on a few. I unloaded all my bloodpoints I farmed yesterday on Wraith, but I don’t have a build I want yet, so hopefully I can get Enduring / Spirit Fury today on him
---
the first one is just quick and quiet but broken and snap's numbers are way too high, and there's no cooldown so it's also pretty broken...
---
Oh my bad, I didn't read properly, sorry.  I'm that case, the servers might be out. Try googling "dead by daylight servers", top hit should be a site to check if it is down, I forget the name because it's so easy to Google I never remember it lol
---
That's not true at all. High-mid tiers deal with it just fine. Even in low ranks people are starting to catch on and realize that just sending 1 person out to look for it while the others do gens it still fairly effective. Also maybe look at my argument as a whole not just what you want to pick apart. Because I went on to say that while survivors have to deal with that, killers have to deal with dumb shit from survivors like BT and MoM. So both sides have perks that cause frustration and make the game more annoying from the other side.
---
They are not thought it
---
First priority for points, I’d say David’s We’re Gonna Live Forever. Dead Hard ain’t bad, either. 
---
Feng Min’s perk Alert is really nice to have too, but not super worth it- I’d recommend David’s WGLF and Nea’s Urban Evasion.
---
I love UE because you crouch-walk fast as fucc boi, won’t alert crows (unless you walk into them), and urban evading around a generator as the killer is breaking it is super useful. You can always hop right back on that bitch when the coast is clear.
---
&gt; most players aren't like Monto and don't have ruin skill check super powers 
---
super powers? I'd call "Git Gut Scrub" on that one. It's not that hard.
---
It succks because the snow is so pleasing to look at and the map looks fantastic just auras and marks.
---
its just telling you to do it
---
Feng
---
They used to be a common offering
---
Nea is the killer. Rookie mistake.
---
so why do survivors struggle so much with it at all ranks, then?
---
The DREAM!
---
Wait time is long for killers in general due to the blood hunt a lot of people want to play killer since more blood points.
---
I noticed it yesterday. I typically wait a few minutes as survivor and playing killer is instant. But yesterday it was the opposite and it took a minute as killer to load in. Maybe more people are playing killer than survivor for the double BPs since survivors are farming each other and killers are tunneling hard.
---
Eww no
---
Low amp is good too.
---
That is really somethin!
---
Kate and Adam
---
Yeah. Vastly overestimating the ability of survivors is kind of a trend in this reddit.
---
I've been working on leveling up everyone to get all the teachables but my favorites to play are probably Jeff and Nea. I also like Feng.
---
Same for me, rank 11 for killer though
---
Adrenaline next. It's a Meg Thomas perk that comes in clutch in the end game. Her others aren't bad either, but as you acquire more perks, you probably won't use them as much.
---
I run Balanced Landing (Nea) a lot, but some people really like Lithe (Feng). Both give you options for evading the killer during a chase.
---
Dwight has some great teamwork perks. Prove Thyself and Leader encourage co-op play, and Bond lets you find people similarly to Empathy (Claudette), but they don't have to be injured.
---
Like nurse being op was not enough
---
Tfw also play in Brazil and every three matches there’s a camping pig
---
Freddy.    
---
If I had him I would play Doctor a ton too
---
&gt; It becomes nigh on impossible to deal with if the doors are open.
---
if this is an issue for you then stop attacking the person going for the save and pull them off instead. use blood warden.
---
Okay sure be offended if you must I don't give a fuck. Tried to apologise, tried to talk civilised but you wanna play white knight keyboard warrior. Maybe just get better at being a grown up?
---
I already answered this same comment elsewhere
---
False. I’m rank 7 and go against killers my rank or lower very often. If a killer finds the hex ruin before survivors and patrols that and 3 or 4 gens and is willing to give up chases to protect the hex ruin it is hard to defeat. Very good survivor perks could counter nicely IF you have them.
---
r/gaming is truly the cesspool of "culture"
---
OMG, OTHER SMART FREDDYS EXIST YASSS
---
Also Red Paint Brush And Class Photo or Pill Bottle are a a fantastic combo FYI.
---
How so? wouldn't it be as simple as rendering a 2d model of the survivor with the cosmetics? or better (and easier) yet, couldn't they just screenshot all of the different combinations of heads &amp; torso cosmetics (you can't even see the legs so why bother) and replacing them with whatever you're equipped with?
---
You need to play the game more.
---
lol no, its really not, its for some reason much MUCH sweatier than normal.
---
Props for trying to help them out, good on you
---
Yeah, everyone is going to be hit once in the first two minutes of every match.
---
You have done well my son, we are proud of you.
---
that's just a way to learn that more easily. people practice in every game. Don't you remember times when there was no tutorial and you had to ask a friend to launch a KYF game to teach you the basics?
---
If you take into account that the kill rate includes survivors that intentionally suicide on the hook, that a trash perk is the most used survivor perk at all ranks and that a lot of survivors don't bring items (personal experience, data does not include stats about item usage) then yes the number is way too low. Survivors are playing very suboptimally, the death % should be higher than it is
---
I'm not offended because I'm not the original person you made fun of. Just pointing out it was rude. You're a bit ironic.
---
Wait there's 5 survivors now ?
---
At the very least hook suicides will be included
---
When I started this game a couple months ago it was Bill but as soon as Jane came out I started playing her
---
You are a sad, sad little boy. Zero effort life; going nowhere.
---
&gt; people practice in every game.
---
i'm trying to think of a game where you apparently have to go out of your way to make practice lobbies to be able to compete in normal gameplay
---
anyway, this has nothing to do with the fact that higher ranked and more experienced players still get smacked by ruin pretty hard even after years have gone by
---
Yeah, I know, but if I played SWF, killer mains would also be complaining. It also kinda throws your argument of 'not willing to break totems' out the window, because there's probably enough survivors that are willing to do it, but are unable to. 
---
Since NOED got buffed, I think it's only fair to have a counter of number of totems in the HUD, since every killer and their dog runs Ruin and NOED, but for solo players it's almost impossible to keep track of all totems by themselves, even with Small Game. If a rando team mate does break a totem in an obscure place, a solo survivor would never know about it until the find that heap of bones.
---
I would even trade in MoM for it, because otherwise "survivors would be OP"
---
I know. I even loved old Hag and valued her as high tier. She had the highest 0 kill ratio too though.
---
I mean they're not hypothetical, I see them every other game and it's not at rank 20 because people like you love shouting about how "good" a perk it is. I also see them when watching other people stream their survivor games and they struggle on the hook while Nea sits in the basement self-caring. If you need to be constantly healing and it's not for a reason like tanking hits for WGLF stacks, you're bad.
---
I won't farm with survivors, but I won't kill anyone. I'll kick gens, break pallets, down and hook people, but in the end, everyone gets out with lots of points :)
---
Rage quitting killer, even after 4 BPS are burnt... Can't take good survivors on.
---
That would be almost useless In any situation you’d normally use hatchets though, you’d basically be forced to get gen snipes which isn’t even possible on a lot of maps
---
bond is easily one of the best perks in the game for survivors to run. it's extremely useful and you get a lot of information
---
What I meant is that if you don’t have a good team, common in solo, and you spend 3-4 minutes searching from the last totem, when you finally find that all your team is dead and who knows how many gens are done
---
honestly thats a great build. My build rn is deliverance, ds, adrenaline, mom. Tank build=fun build
---
So, Hag is overpowered, and only bad killers use NOED?
---
"Paulie Esther"
---
no
---
Why?
---
And if ruin is an issue for you then look for it and learn to loop better.
---
This happened to me! Everyone had used a BPS, we went our merry way farming BP then at some point, my game just randomly crashed. All those BPs...gone...
---
True. I like to change it up a lot though. A really fun one that I was using before Monto put it on youtube is the houdini. Its lithe, dance w me, Q&amp;Q and poised. Its so fun to confuse the killer and break chase with this build.
---
Survivors your against as killer
---
What's the song? Nice cosplay
---
Also kinda toxic is insta heal, dead hard, MoM, adrenaline and DS
---
obviously more gens get done if there is no ruin, thats the point of the perk. But even really good players like Monto have a hard Time winning on rank 1...
---
Leatherface = Harley    Billy= Kawasaki ....   you sir are wrong
---
bitch where? I tell people I have streamers on and they say "same" and don't. Or the killer runs a mori or camps/tunnels.
---
Iron Will from Jake, Bond from Dwight, Lithe from Feng, Balanced Landing from Nea, Dead Hard from David, DS from Laurie, MoM from Ash, Deliverance from Adam, Adrenaline from Meg, Stake Out from Tapp is pretty nice (not the best but a counter to Ruin), Aftercare and Distortion from Jeff are also decent perks
---
most accurate post ever. This is the most irritating shit in this game.
---
They already did. That's what the endgame collapse is!
---
Who on earth is arguing dead hard is the worst exhaustion perk?? Like I understand thinking balanced landing is better (I personally choose dead hard but I know some who vehemently choose balanced), but anyone who thinks that dead hard is worse than head on or sprint burst is delusional.
---
MoM, adrenaline, borrowed time, any exhaustion perk of your choice, bond
---
i don't play survivor. it's extremely boring. 
---
bruh i'm one of the most notoriously biased killer players on this subreddit lol it's hilarious you think this is me complaining as a survivor
---
ruin has been out for years. higher ranked and more experienced players still get dinked by it if it's not found early. clearly it's an issue that extends past "git gud lol"
---
Myers taking Sam trick or treating is the best.  Horror Big Brothers ftw!
---
you clearly don't know anything about trying to get good at anything
---
The maps are small. Locations of survivors are easy to predict. Not worth a perk slot
---
sometimes my audio cuts out. i think it’s a glitch.
---
Playing DBD during Bloodhunt is looking at this screen, be excited and not getting past this image cause of infinite Loading Screen :)
---
Lets be real here, the Claudettes running urban don't stay in the game past the first time getting downed. Blendette + UE is a sure DC combo.
---
yea, having all the info and not having to waste upwards to a minute per match isn't worth using
---
Tho I usually prefer playing Surv, Nurse. And sometimes to annnoy people; Spirit.
---
We've just added one more stat to the post, due to popular demand:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/456471/#Comment\_456471](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/456471/#Comment_456471) 
---
&gt;!It's obviously not the real stats, it's just a joke.!&lt;
---
yeah and i'm saying that ruin essentially shuts down gens getting done completely if it isn't quickly found. that's the issue. it's too good at slowing down repairs and after years of it being out the survivor base has not adapted to it
---
&gt; But even really good players like Monto have a hard Time winning on rank 1...
---
monto hasn't played at rank 1 for a good amount of time now
---
Rn I'm maining Bill.
---
lmfao that's not an argument bruh bruh. you're still ignoring *so hard* how experienced and higher ranked players still struggle with ruin a lot despite it being out for years. that fact just takes down your argument
---
When you play as survivor:
---
Urban evasion, Spine chill, sprint burst self care.
---
When you play as killer:
---
Borrowed time, DS, Adrenaline, Mettle of Man
---
So does not letting survivors get 5 gens.
---
?
---
As a killer main you're an asshole for using mories during bloodhunts.
---
It’s a new old one
---
David King
---
It almost looks like your teammate collided with something invisible that vaulted the window....just as it happened too...weird.
---
You forgot “Nothing” in the survivor category.  Somehow and for some reason your level 5 teammates will only be running 1 level 1 perk.
---
What are you talking about? Lmao. As if anyone ACTUALLY cares about escaping in that pile of shit
---
I'll add you when I get home.  Same name here &amp; PSN.
---
They use the whole "bloodpoint economy" thing as the reason they don't do it more frequently, which I think is a bit BS, but w/e. They'll probably never do it more frequently sadly.
---
I hope you get to do this again, as well, then maybe with a little more time to crunch numbers. I would like if this were to become a more regular thing, even. While more detailed or specific stats would be great to have, getting more general stats at the end of every rank season would also be nice.
---
I appreciate the response. I know that you are going to be holding a Q&amp;A regarding these statistics later on in Discord, but now that we have you here, I would like to have something in post-form, so I hope you can answer here: How is the 80% survival rate at rank 1 explained? The new Emblem system makes it so rank 1 is hardly populated with survivors, and survivors also immediately get booted to rank 2 upon depipping - are those the reasons why the rank 1 stats are so inflated, only counting the few rank 1 survivors that actually pipped in their games? Thank you.
---
I played a rank 12 Plague Game and all gens got done with ruin being not touched. And even if you dont Hit greats, you can still finish a gen...
---
Flashy Visconti with pink clothing, I'm practicing getting chased... a lot!
---
Rose-tinted glasses made it even better!
---
Yeah we get it
---
What the fuck! This is a spoiler meme for got!
---
oh shit that happened in one single game? well fuck totally disproved lmfao
---
you know that on average most ruin games are not like that. you know it. come on.
---
Plague is interesting she has a unique play style but can kinda be abused by those that know how, overall I would rate her as fun to play but overall not the best.
---
Gotta watch out for Nurse’s though mate 👌🏻 Was playing some spirit last night and this Feng was trying to heal in that spot but Nurse’s Calling screwed her lol
---
This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time.
---
In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the starts from a week later.
---
actions such as healing and repairing yes, tier 3 makes you unable to do that 
---
but vaulting isn't blocked in tier 3, if I'm not mistaken there is a 2 second window after you get shocked that prohibits you from vaulting or dropping pallets though
---
that's not supposed to accomplish a pallet save though lmfao
---
Wasn’t there evidence of an SCP that can hide in in his own pocket dimensions in the data mind of those audio files? I believe someone found a name of the files that was a reference to the Old Man scp-106.
---
No ?
---
That's one more perk than my allies are running at Rank 8.
---
Just throwing in my two cents here! I feel like Legion was BHVR's own attempt at a ghost face, since they're a gang of 4 rather than a single person.
---
I've been waiting ages for a killer ability/survivor perk that teleports you to another locker - I'm dying for it to be called 'Vanishing Act'.
---
wow....I give you an example and you just claim "most of time its different" way to go bud....Im done trying to Talk into a wall
---
Tbh Hag is one of the best killers to play without perks/addons.
---
do you plan on making a full icon pack in the future? Your killer/survivor styled perks are really awesome and I'd love to have one for each
---
I just thought about them for a minute
---
...smaller maps make it even better! it's not just about kind of knowing where they might be, it's about seeing where they're going and where you should be going. It's about sitting on a gen and knowing what the survivor up in the house next to you is doing.
---
Bungo?.
---
i only use my streamers when im either with SWF or with randos that agree to use theirs, im fairly low level and i use them sparingly
---
It's horrible, blinking feels so slow as well. As if I'm dragging Sally through quicksand. Nothing like Nurse plays I see on YouTube
---
Same, I pulled an Ash off a gen with a 3man and he DCd on the way
---
A joke: The community actually being helpful.
---
She's a basic M1 killer with a limited power that is entirely RNG reliant, and a gimmicky secondary ability that will occasionally get free hits. She's not awful, there's just little to no reason to play her over other more consistent killers.
---
;n;
---
how do I order a hitman
---
oh shit i'm sorry. i didn't realize your single rank 12 example outweighed all of my purple and red rank exampels oops
---
Why not?
---
omg
---
This. I've been playing more survivor since the update and I've been getting teammates who do this, sans the gens. At this point, unless I see the hatch, I'll just let you kill me. Ain't even worth it.
---
Ah never mind, it was a theory on the video of the audio files that were found but the person was proven wrong recently. (Didn’t see that before).
---
My mistake.
---
SCP-106 would be a damn cool killer though.
---
Yup I also think it's bullshit.
---
because you're not actually hitting them 4head
---
I could see that, if you're already experienced with her.  If you're starting out new on her and don't know where to put on map pressure most effectively, she just gets kited around.
---
Funny how I open my Reddit to see this post while playing DBD. The next game I go in to is this exact offering line up or it would be if I didn't ruin it putting on a common one.
---
The devs literally say it in the stats. When you depip as a rank 1 survivor, the endgame screen records you as rank 2, and endgame screen is where the stats are collected. The only recorded deaths in rank 1 are where people died but still safetied/pipped.
---
so basicly
---
if i can't toss a ball the ball's bad so I should never touch it again
---
top tier life advice
---
I'm convinced people were too busy meme'ing up the Plagues name as the "plag" and watching 'Thick as a Brick' Jane butt jiggle to pay attention to what her power does and how to play against her.
---
Because its funny
---
Trapper, Clown, Pig, Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Bill, Ash, Jeff
---
Meg. But because of bullying and toxic people I’m probably going to switch soon. :(
---
ANOTHER MEG!
---
Yeah, the start is rough. But once you know where to trap and have good predicts, 3/4ks with her are pretty easy
---
I really like DH too its a fun perk and I agree with everything you said. Also like you said though its too bad it gets destroyed so early :( but when it doesnt boy is it fun
---
if that's how you put it, every perk is useless and y'all should run no mither as their only perk
---
It’s a great stealth kill depending on it’s spawn if you’re killer has an insta-down aka bubba you can get to tier 5 without them noticing
---
if you can't toss a ball after trying to toss the ball for years then yeah something might be wrong with the ball
---
never mind that isn't an adequate analogy at all but whatever
---
Where in my post did I ever call SC a good Perk??
---
And again, you're proving my very point in that your *only* argument is about bad **players** using the Perk at a bad **time**. Those same players would still be bad at the game even if they took whatever fucking perk it is that you consider to be good.
---
These are sick
---
It is without a doubt my favourite perk, I just wish I wasn’t constantly getting screwed over by the totem spawns
---
This game has possibly the WORST RNG I’ve ever seen on a game. The more they attempt to “fix” it the worse it gets too.
---
Gen rush is not even a thing— it’s an excuse to failing to apply pressure
---
Hag &lt;3 She's such a blast to play as.
---
Oh yeah, doctor made me scream in there once, he was confused for a good solid 10 seconds. I typically leave scratch marks around it then go hide for the luls
---
Death whatnow? I don't know her.
---
In most cases you're absolutely right, but there have been some tests like the 4 man BNP test that showed how fast a gen can be completed. It was really fucking fast.
---
I use it as a killer occasionally if I run into SWFs constantly. If I see someone's team is being a dick and only one person is doing the gens, I'll let them go. As a survivor, however, I don't like it when I'm the only one doing gens five minutes into the game (I clean totems when I see them), end up doing all of them and power the exit gate, only to find out that the killer has NOED and I get swiped.
---
I don't think you understand how this meme works. This picture would make a lot more sense if the images were reversed.
---
Today i tried to farm but 2 survivors got scared and dc.. I m so sad
---
ii-Momo
---
Just make sure you say you’re from Reddit of something because I get a crap ton of requests from randoms. And my request list is huge right now.
---
bodyblocking and flashlights are toxic REEEEEEE
---
They publicly addressed this. It was a typo, still somewhere  on there twitter.
---
Trapper isn't really the most popular killer. he's just used most by newer players
---
i wouldnt go as far as saying its the worst, considering examples like hearthstone and the kind but yea there are definitly certain weaknesses with its current state that could be combatted with degrees of entropic mechanics
---
Feng Min, Detective Tapp, Nea, Adam, Dwight, and Bill. I just rotate when I'm feeling bored. 
---
Feng was the first I got to a prestige level.
---
Head on and dead hard are double exhaustion perks, how did this guy get to rank 5?
---
Ok tbh you’re right. Current bnp still saves a lot of time and pre nerf bnp was broken
---
I thought of the same thing
---
I loved the themed ones
---
most killers don't have an innate ability to protect their DH like trapper can and need TOTH if they actively want to. hag is better than most tho and really you should web out your traps a little bit to catch runners in the area to protect it if that's your goal
---
“Died”= staying too far from the exit gate and gets hit picked up and hooked and teammates won’t come to save their ass
---
Do you still get those for buying deathgatan?
---
I've had one BPS... and it was mine
---
he's pretty fun when he works so makes sense.
---
This ain’t me but it’s good to know that other people message nice things to PS4 nurse players
---
I like Feng and Nea a lot, but i really dislike Ace,Quentin and Ash.
---
What a troll.
---
I think it’s great! &gt;:)
---
Except when you choke the skill check :(
---
Bloody heaven
---
I always gen tap towards the end because I get so mad at regressions at the 90% mark.
---
Thats like looking at a rainbow thats on fire with a Unicorn sliding down it.
---
The anime community also uses it
---
The Hag, although I just unlocked the Plague and she's been pretty fun the whole day I've had her.
---
So you are suggesting that in the games with low ping where it works, it's a bug? 
---
You know pallet stuns aren't based on direction, right? They're based on proximity to a hitbox.
---
You're ignorant about how the game mechanics work, and are trying to hide that ignorance by saying it's a victim complex.
---
I already gave him the Link in a Private :b
---
Had an aneurism reading that
---
I was in the game and we all d-pipped.   I was at 9 and went back down to 10.
---
understandable dude
---
It was a typo. They fixed it later.
---
Because your a hot tier killer that relies on op Add-Ons. You probably used the bugged blades and franks
---
I mean they shouldn't have just been standing there but he was camping you. Seemed like no NOED, so a save was definitely possible but also depends on if they know how to yoink people off the unhook. Solo Survivor really blows at times. :(
---
Survivor stresses me out because I get easily scared by horror games. I like playing Killer because then I'm the one doing the scaring. It's stressful when you get memed on, but it's *so* satisfying when you punish that (it's great as Spirit to stand still, watch them emote, and then actually phase and fuck them up).
---
Ok but I had a game were 2 people played BPStreamers AND no one disconnected during loading. This jake gets downed once and DCs. 
---
Like ???? why would you squander an opportunity like that. The killer wasn't particularly sweaty and we all survived anyway.
---
Funniest guy ever.
---
Nurse and spirit because I like mind game killers
---
Favorite - Tapp
---
Hate - Neas
---
I mean if you can really only get to rank 1 by being swf (since solo queue survivors get screwed over in every which way, especially now that DCs are so rampant) then it makes sense if true.
---
&gt;only 3-5% are playing in a full Survive With Friends group.
---
plainly false above rank 12. they're either lying like with the console optimization "pass" or including ranks that arent relevant to the meta.
---
If there isn't a hex then the totems will be dull
---
Claudette. I'm good at stealth and her P3 outfit makes it easy.
---
Granted I'm getting up there with Ash cause, well.
---
If double BP events were more common people would just play and not focus on farming.
---
I don’t play Legion. And I can destroy swf’s with Freddy so chill. 😂
---
Oh okay then ahah, on the same site ? Because if it's anywhere else, I'm interested :p
---
If ruin is a thing I pointedly work alone on gens. I hate having other people regress them
---
Stop caring so much about the flawed ranking system.
---
I think Nea for Urban Evasion; it is probably one of the best perks that have helped me.
---
not if agaisnt a toxic player REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
“Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player...”
---
yeah right.
---
I never specified the role i played.
---
this is insanely try hard and unfunny wow
---
I like the idea of the survivor pushing away from the ground trying to avoid the trap, and he’s just crushing their head into it with his boot
---
I’m so so so sooooo sorry. Doesn’t change the fact that you’re acting like a dick, but ok.
---
There's no way they'd add headshots, hitboxes are fucked as they are. If it seems like the case on ptb, I think Monto suggested it, that's not true. The server isn't always deleteing them as they hit so it registers as two hits and is a bug.
---
I know, I was agreeing with you. XD 
---
When my team-mates are just standing there it's just so incredibly frustrating. I play a lot of Survivor, so I feel your pain.
---
This sub: Rank is meaningless.
---
Also this sub: reeeee i lost a pip
---
It is bullshit. I’ve gotten 1.3k hours and you know what I’ve noticed? The bloodwebs are utter dogshit when it comes to getting bloodpoint offerings. I got Laurie p3 lv50 before clown came out and I have a fuckton if bloodpoint offerings on her. I just recently got Kate to p3 lv50 and she only has 2-3 of each offering (disregarding common, and bloody party streamers). They nerfed bloodwebs without saying a word then say, the bloodpoint economy excuse. Like, we need this boost to get our characters done. People stockpile escape cakes and streamers for these! I wish the devs listen to us more.
---
*bringing back exclusive cosmetics would be nice too*
---
I'm so proud of this community, through all the toxicness of normal games every so often we see something so great it brings a tear to my eye, this is beautiful
---
I really like Quentin because he looks like a wimp but in P3 he looks like a kid that was bullied at school but now he will make you a sibling, give you AIDS and marry your girlfriend if you mess with him.
---
Most disliked would be Ace because he looks like a cocky douchebag.
---
More like toxic survivors
---
In terms of perks:    
---
Favorite: Nea, Ash     
---
Least: Quentin, Ace      
---
For design:    
---
Favorite: Jane    
---
Least: Quentin       
---
For lore:    
---
Favorite: Claudette     
---
Least: any of the licensed characters
---
I'm sure the Laurie will stumble on this random post on the internet
---
Yeah, but you have to be a good Nurse to pull that off and for the life of me I just cannot blink and attack, and I'd rather not waste a half an hour queue just to be called "baby killer, gg ez" over and over again.
---
If you are then hell yeah, Nurse sounds good due to that gem about getting 3 categories in one action. I did not consider it before.
---
Thats a pretty toxic build any ways. Like an iridesent heand infantry belt huntress.
---
Warning: Can cause exhaustation for several minutes
---
Sure, the abilities are different, but both of them having a chainsaw *and* a hammer is just an odd choice.
---
Also, I assume you meant "disgrace.". But it's not because they are in fact, the same weapons, regardless of how they are used.
---
It bothers me how inconsistent Jake icons look. They seem nice. If it was 100% safe to use them I would :P.
---
To answer your question,
---
Tier 3 is basically the “hinderance.” It’s purposely meant to force you to snap out of it then resume playing. You can still run and vault, unless the doctor zaps you and you scream, but then his bloodlust timer resets. Back in the day, you were able to use items while tier 3 madness lol.
---
It's the way his walk is animated
---
That said the survival rate for rank 2 is 60% so at best that means the average survival rate between the top 2 ranks is around 70% or 3 out of 4 survivors surviving.
---
Not exactly healthy when 2 deaths is a tie.
---
Yes.
---
I wasn't dead on hook. In the video you see my second hook and the part where my team does nothing for a solid minute.
---
I don't know if he broke the pallet, but I can't linger aroumd it. Not with clown. Survivors trying to mindgame is the clowns string point. 
---
Besides, I thought they were done, or at least close when I went over there. Not in the clips is an extra minute or so of me buying time for the team.
---
Hag is a DLC as well, at least on PC. And where you see more Hags than Spirits ? I see a lot of Spirits at rank, I barely see any Hag there, Imao.
---
well, i do care about my rank and others should too
---
/u/NRocky Made these, you'll have to ask them ^^
---
They are all amazing.
---
Not related,but since the idea of perk icon swapping became popular,i instantly regretted playing on console.
---
Usually Dwight players are pretty relaxed, especially pizza Dwight’s
---
I rarely, and I mean rarely, meet a Claud player that I like, when I’m a survivor they do every stupid thing imaginable, often are the first to DC, and regularly get me killed 
---
When I’m killer they are about as immersed as possible Claud’s of the “GG EEEZZZZ JUST KYS LOL BABYKILLER” variety, who if you so much as shutdown their loop will instantly DC screwing over the other survivors
---
Can I also just point out that one person snaked the other survivors with that escape cake. 😂😂😂
---
Doesn't the exposed icon appear once someone gets downed? Or is it only with m1 hits?
---
Right when I died I unmuted and basically screamed at my friend who just got back lmao. Never again.
---
This describes my experiences lol
---
No but seriously, the infinite loading screens, freezes and crashes has spiked during this event dramatically. I am already starting to hate it.
---
Brown streamers? Oh, thats old, thats old.
---
Whats up with all the opera questions and info???
---
&gt;discrace
---
Is that some kind of frisbee competition?
---
At red ranks playing killer gets significantly harder. Playing survivor seems harder because you have to rely on teammates. Anything lower than red ranks means that you have teammates who dont really know how to play optimally.
---
Looks like it
---
Why meg ash and Jane? Quentin’s are way worse
---
Imagine being the kind of person who messes up the Drake meme format.  
---
Good thing you're not that kind of guy, right, OP?  ^^... ^^OP?
---
I just get genrushed at rank 14..
---
Edit-&gt;Edit Flair-&gt;Salt/Rant
---
I mean obviously we can only speculate, but at least we're on the same page as to having a punishment for DCing!
---
Have you warn them that you were bringing BPS? People tend to bring another BPS if able if they see someone bringing it too, unless they got fooled once with "Bringing BPS" and then no BPS, then, yeah, is easier if you warn them.
---
Yeah, I’m still learning how to be mentally prepared for 360’s, because I fall for those a lot lol
---
Yo is that best girl
---
Ditto.  Few times I was high so blame my self but others it was a frame rate drop. I envy PC macros for only holding a button.
---
At that point, you just gotta start destroying totems, looting chests and the like. Maybe grab a toolbox and sabo. Although this is mainly a problem at the lower ranks I feel, where killers don’t prioritize very well and chases can go on for many minutes
---
Yeah I don't get it either, it's so weird. They could try to stay alive whilst helping teammates and doing objectives. Hell, even cleanse totems, just do something! And they would get double whatever they do, you can't really lose unless you get hooked 3 seconds in and then not rescued!
---
Yeah thats what I'm sayin'.  My internet was fine and usually is.  I play a lot of online games and only ever DC when there is a storm or something and the internet has gone out completely for like a block.
---
Same, had a hag and a pig face camp me in 2 matches. Legit wanted to uninstall because they were basically back to back and even with the bonus BP I got like 4k points to sit in a que and load for 20mins
---
Had a legion bring in a Mori when we brought in 2 streamers, maybe just wait on the mori until after the damn event.
---
Was this yesterday? I played a lot of Claud and David yesterday, but I also saw quite a few pumpkin head nurses.
---
Plus if that guy is DC'ing all the time, it's very possible it was a different game.
---
How do the other usernames start out. Give me the first 4 letters, I'll know if one was me.
---
If you ever come across it again let me know
---
Surivors are all the same tho. I just think some diversity would spice things up.
---
You can use WGLF (We're gonna live forever) from David's unique perk, which can grant you 100% bonus points. As far as I know, you can get a 700% bonus this weekend (5 BPS, WGLF, Bloodhound) That'd be almost 300k points if you make 32bp in a match.
---
Killers already dom most matches and get the most points. This is a horrible suggestion.
---
Even when I play as lvl 1 killer, I walk away with 4k and atleast triple the bloodpoints of the survivors 4 out of 5 times.
---
Ah it might depend on rank, I'm rank 10, so I don't see a lot of those even if there's an event. But it sucks that you're getting games like that :/
---
All it would do is force people to be mostly the same survivor and would kill diversity. I would stop playing if that were the case. Better to make them just skins.
---
Find the house or basement or cow tree spots. Lay them down and rest go for tall grass by pallets. Have ruin on and Hurd everyone you can towards the big loop spots . I get 3k 80% of the time. Sometimes he will get wreaked but that's a mid tier killer for you.
---
I mean they use the same weapons but the play style is nowhere near the same.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/subredditdrama] [\/r\/DeadByDaylight users get into slapfight over who's the REAL pre-teen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/bkbd9m/rdeadbydaylight_users_get_into_slapfight_over/)

&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
---
What survivors would everyone play as? Because all that would mean is the devs would have to tweak perks to  make all survivors viable.
---
Oh girl, I was wondering where the unnecessary “I don’t like this post but I’m going to take time out of my day to let you know” post was.
---
Because, like, the amount of bitching I saw in here at a brief glance over that does not reflect the graph showing that a 4 man swf is a minority by a long shot.
---
People still DC when Moried, even during Bloodhunt.
---
I would use them but I never find them, is there an optimal level in the web to find them or something? I'm using p3 level 50 webs
---
Stats say otherwise..  its roughly 50percent.  but keep going
---
My allies in a nutshell. I seriously don't know how you fuck up pallet saves it's the easiest thing in the game.
---
i despise the characters, not the players themselves
---
Survivor:  Solid Snake build.  **Diversion** (Huh?  What was that noise?), **Urban Evasion** (Sneaking suit, huh?), **Stakeout** (what do you know about Metal Gear?), **Alert** (ALERT!)
---
Killer:  Trap Daddy’s Loveshack.  **Agitation**, **Iron Grasp**, **Mad Grit**, **Brutal Strength** on Trapper.  Take them to the loveshack and they ain’t never coming back!
---
Should’ve turned the gut into Ash
---
It's meant to be more of an anti-loop tool than a chase tool, but it does nothing at most loops and any Survivor with half a brain will just leave the loop if you throw a bottle at it. You want a Killer who denies loops just play Hag.
---
r/punpatrol I NEED YOUR BEST MEN HERE.
---
I'm serious, they look so dmn dope.
---
Should have had pikachu
---
Lolwut BHVR showed stats in a stream a few months ago. Killers *are* most likely to win most matches. 
---
Where are your stats from?
---
^did it work?
---
The vast, vast majority of players are solo-ing.
---
Why though? It's a dbd meme and Dwight is more appropriate.
---
I wasn't bringing that stuff in until I started getting tunneled and camped. So I started bringing in tool boxes with a bnp and spool of wire so at least one can get hatch.  It works
---
True, baby dwight is probably the cutest thing ever to exist
---
They dont struggle with it at all ranks.
---
Funny thing, it worked in reddit, but not on my notification.
---
lowkey thats my only offer
---
No thanks to buffs. It’s still possible for Nurse to be completely broken on console, it’s just way way way harder to use her. They need to improve FPS and game performance and give us higher sensitivity options and Nurse will become more of a threat.
---
I haven’t had these issues to this extent at all. You’re probably being dramatic
---
No
---
That's because I didn't realize you had to put ^ in front of EACH word, and I had to edit it xD
---
20% of survivors run self care. That IS a lot but not as much as i think you believe it is. Meg has sprint burst/adrenaline + two flex picks. Which is arguably better. Nea has balanced landing plus urban evasion plus two flex picks David has wglf plus dead hard. And the characters that have 1 or no good perks would just have their teachables buffed
---
Piggy,Doc and Spirit
---
doc looks less bulky in 1080p?
---
As a killer main swf are pretty fun to play against because they offer a challenge. also didn't the devs show most people solo or partner up with one friend instead of a whole group?
---
lmfao
---
Just dont get the point of nerfing something if you arent camping? That's legit the only way it activates.
---
No i meant i can see the symbol in my notifications (mobile) but olwhen i open reddit everthing is tiny and hidden.
---
I was a Claudette main when I first started playing (which was probably a good choice, she’s one of the best for learning how to play) and honestly I ran her base three perks for so so long. I found empathy useful for knowing where the killer was, self care is obvious and I’d run We’ll make it too so botany knowledge made it nearly an insta-heal after unhook. 
---
Eventually I got bored of that though and wanted to run something more exciting and less team focused. I always liked the look of Kate (she’s b-e-a-utiful) so I looked at her perks and worked out the ninja build. (DWM, Lithe, Quick &amp; Quiet + whatever extra perk you fancy, sometimes I do Adrenaline, sometimes WMI) and since I’ve already really enjoyed playing her and probably have more hours on her now then Claudette.
---
Such try hards.. like not much you can do if they're good with those hatchets
---
I don't know if my eyes are broken, but I genuinely can't see a difference lol.
---
I mostly want to bring this up because I feel like the current AA that DBD uses doesn't do the models justice. I feel like more open graphical settings (not for an advantage) would make the game work alot better since there is ALOT of detail lost with the currently Anti-Aliasing in the game.
---
I hope that with the recent survey, we'll at the very least get the option to choose what kind of AA is used.
---
Dead Hard is situational, and therefore must be worse than everything but Head On (tbh I don't even really count that perk since 0 ppl use it, and it shouldn't be an exhaustion perk)
---
I want a vegan version, please.
---
Yep but it would 100% either be re skins or stuff u can get already from the bloodweb
---
LF chainsaw stresses me out so much more. Not because of the sounds of the saws, but LF with his fucking donkey yowling scares the hell out of me. I need to stop playing with headphones...
---
Yeah I do see Balanced Landing in almost every single game I play in mid/high ranks, like ranks 10-5
---
r/thathappened
---
I feel ya I played last night against 4 megs with matching redshirts and flashlights. They when I downed one they would all surround me and flash me or block the way and etc.
---
it's not "considerably easier" lol they're about the same in terms of difficulty. The only difference is that for survivor your success is tied to your teammates to various extents so their skill and their interest intersects with you
---
What do you think about the TINH rework? good? bad?
---
Also  i can understand the anti-deja vu proposed buff
---
I really hate these types of comments. I mean I get it they wanted to play the game normal and not farm bcuz it's boring, but...
---
1. It's only for a few days, not forever.
---
2. You're getting free BP, and I mean a sht ton of BP for free basically.
---
I really enjoyed the event so far because of the farming games. It's really relaxing and chilling compared to the normal routine when there's hardloop, genrush, facecamp and tunnel.
---
Thank you? Your liked too.
---
Stop crying and get better at the game.
---
Meg, the only one I have and will prestige with
---
Yeah I was discussing with my friends how ridiculous it is that they chose to do double BP before they pushed the mid-chapter patch to live. The same patch that fixed all the disconnects and 3v1's. It really doesn't make any sense.
---
Doctor is good as long as you use good add-ons and perks. Impossible skill checks for example.
---
I haven't played as long as you have so I have only known (I think) the amount of offerings I get but now that I think about it they do seem low. I want bloodhunt to be once a week because that would actually made me play more often, because that way I can see some progress get done without being glued to the game grinding low bloodpoints, it is a nice boost to have now and then.
---
I prefer SWF when I'm killer... because they tend to be overly altruistic. Once a person is hooked it's guaranteed at least 1 if not more of the other survivors have come running to save their buddy. Makes for some easy hook farms
---
I had a killer bring streamers and then we had a three person load-in. THEN someone DC'ed. And the killer went full sweaty. Literally got under 15,000 bloodpoints because he destroyed two people. I get farming is boring, I don't like it either. But in a two person game, playing that hard is unnecessary, especially with x2 bloodpoints.
---
Spirit is probably my all time favorite. I also like the Hag and Plague a lot.
---
Of all the perks posts I've seen, these are my fav :)  
---
Is there a way we can use them in game yet? I've seen other people posting how to do that.
---
lol you're not even trying to deny it either. and the obnoxious emoji just seals the deal. nice try tho
---
if you wanted to make it believable you could have said you were getting a bunch of 3ks but nah you had to make it sound like you had 2000 4ks in a row
---
Being a Dwight main do you also use Prove Thyself? I found using PT and WGLF gave me blood points galore. If people bring in BPS I will probably pee myself.
---
There could be the clown in a drinking contest and people screaming "chug! chug! chug! chug!"
---
Same
---
When I play LF I use the fear of them thinking that's what I am  gping to do and that is a powerful mindgame. If there is a chance that I can get to basement then sure. I rather have zero hooks then make that meme build. Just mho
---
And you can't use lithe without a vault, balanced without a ledge, and head on without a locker. So I guess sprint burst is the best exhaustion perk /s

I stand by what I said. Never once took anything back. And no, it’s not an agenda post because a video game isn’t that serious enough to havens agenda lmao
---
Well there definitely won’t be as many disconnects just because players could be properly punished for leaving
---
wait you think the mods gave me that flair? lmfao
---
&gt; You act like someone that'd likes being a troll tbh. Worthless.
---
all I'm saying is that if your problems are that common, it's a you issue.
---
My point is that perks definitely do equal advantage. Skilled survivors perform better with perks. Unskilled survivors perform better with perks. Poor perk builds will hurt you a lot at higher ranks.
---
That was triple bloodpoints if I remember correctly
---
I mean, I didnt say it would only give you that BP for basement hooks.
---
Just happened to me last night. I jumped like never before.
---
now look
---
It's a horrible experience. I genuinely feel bullied and the worst part is the survivors still hate mail me :(
---
I'm not a fan Nea, because I honestly I get more toxic Neas than any other character. The kind that will blind you constantly, then D/C when you down after they mess up a loop.
---
I don't really have a strong dislike for any of the male survivors, but I find Bill kind of boring tbh.
---
Steam workshop just for the icons has to be a thing
---
I understand that, but it would help get that 8k for people who have trouble hooking a lot, or are too efficient with skills. Every other category has a way to get to that 8k right now
---
Usually my line up has a pink mori on the right end, when I play survivor.
---
anyone found where the sound named 1002 from Global\_Gameplay come from? like what gives out that sound?
---
lol you take the term agenda post so seriously it's cute
---
again, try again with the edits I suggested
---
numerous 4ks with spirit using bloodhound lmao okay guy
---
It's been doing that to me on ps4 as well
---
Feng/Jane
---
there should be at least 4 for each killer, makes the ebony mori a little more interesting.
---
It's been vice versa for me. It used to freeze every 3 games or so, but during the event so far I haven't disconnected or froze once.
---
Happened to me today as well, its dbd that is the issue
---
I usually just keep running behind them without hitting and smack the gens with M1. However, some survivors are too dumb to take the hint or don't care about farming and will continue with the game normally.
---
lmao the cat shitting rainbow
---
the only instance where Cypress Mori's are OP
---
didn't even address the points I made just got mad I called you out smh
---
It seems to be filled with bugs. Everytime I access the bloodweb it freezes and won’t let me press any other buttons.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: In-game
---
Description: Claudettes who have the Bell of the Ball outfit equipped do not activate Hag traps
---
Screenshot / Video: Don't have one on hand, but this happened in two separate games multiple times per game.
---
Steps to reproduce: Have a Claudette equip all three of the Bell of the Ball cosmetics and have a Hag place a trap (Hag had her Queen of the Mire cosmetic equipped, but I don't know if that's necessary to activate the bug). This happened on two different maps, one was a Farm map and the other was Ormond, but I think the map is inconsequential to reproducing the bug.
---
Expected result: Claudette would trigger the Hag trap as she runs or walks over it.
---
Actual result: The trap remains inactive until another survivor activates it.
---
Reproduction rate: As far as I can tell 100%
---
System Specs: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz, 16.0 GB RAM

Rank 2 swf groups is the highest I’ve seen
---
The colours are different for each in comparison to others.
---
I like killer ranking. Let's me play the way o want to play, and keeps me at the ranks where its competitive.
---
Nope they didn't and surprisingly they didn't even ask where it was
---
You were right:
---
&gt;This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;**In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the starts from a week later.**
---
Claudette with white jacket and object of obsession
---
Is it though? I tried using it and it always sucked
---
Omg Jason with the little feeties kicking.  Adorable.
---
WGLF - BT - DH
---
I'll let you figure out why :-) 
---
^(it's not sandbagging if you get the safe-rescue score :\^))
---
I had this map last night twice with ruin. I checked that spot first each time lol.
---
I am surprised that it's just 22% pick rate. If you would tell me that the pick rate for Nurse at red ranks is 50-60%, I would've believe you.
---
Deliverance and Decisive Strike go good together.
---
Doc and Billy, hate Huntress
---
I think you could absolutely make the argument that Sprint Burst is the best, exactly because it's the least situational. But that also means that some people think you have to be very careful with how you use it (not necessarily true either). But even you have to admit that being injured is a far worse situation to be in just to activate your perk.
---
No One Left Behind doesn't give you bonus BP. It just makes it easier to max out in the Altruism category. WGLF does though
---
I agree with you buddy , their just griping cause they want to keep their huge advantage
---
It's not 80%. The stats for that rank was misleading.
---
See Peanits' comment:
---
Once a week is too much. But once a month is good. Especially with how many characters there are now and how shit the offering spawns are, we **NEED** it.
---
Legion :(
---
The Susie skin is too cute. I avoid using add-ons in an attempt to be hated less, haha. Kinda wish the patch for them had hit before the Blood Hunt.
---
browsing reddit while my game is loading and see this
---
Rank 1 no. Rank 2 and 3 yes. I'd like to assume the rank 2 and 3 reached rank 1 but I dont know.
---
Me ready to fucking kill someone after getting backwater swamp for the twelfth time in a row
---
Nope... I'm rank 6 and I keep getting rank 1 killers tho.
---
Looks exactly the same
---
Daddy Myers &lt;3
---
Nyan cat!
---
We all know it’s hard to pip in the current system
---
but I like it better than how it used to be. There’s no reason to be there so I like losing a pip every now and then
---
Thanks.
---
I went on survivor and got left to die on my first hook while everyone else escaped, this tells me I'm better off on killer where I have control of who lives and dies.. :(
---
I mean, DH is literally the weakest exhaustion perk in many scenarios. If you play against a decent killer, they're not gonna fall for a DH if they don't know you have it lol. They've played for thousands of hours, they just get close enough and bait it out. Works like, 100% of the time
---
I’ve only seen one since pip requirements were initially changed, saw him yesterday. 
---
He threw on a Haddonfield offering with balanced landing. He ended up DC’ing.
---
He just explained how.
---
Billy and hag isn't that surprising. Trapper has been using noed since forever, which means he on average secures one more kill than any other killer who does poorly. This of course has changed more in recent times(Where noed is super common nowadays)
---
But doesn't follow the colour scheme theme though. It feels like having a single blue tile in the bathroom full of while tiles, still the same material but the colour doesn't match.
---
That's because Spirit is kind of a bullshit killer. 
---
There's not a single spot on the map you are safe against her. Why learn how to chase when you can just stand still and purchase a good pair of headphones? 4Head. That's all Spirit is - how good are your pair of headphones.
---
Guy ragequits instantly because Legion. I actually ended up farming with the people who stuck around so... memes.
---
People would either play Meg, Claudette, David or Nea most of the time. This would decrease diversity and make people regret buying characters that they got for design or only one perk for.
---
PS4 player here: yeah that seems about right
---
Be right back and chilli
---
Laurie cause shes leveled up more than anyone
---
Would you mind sharing them at r/PerkByDaylight ?
---
I HIGHLY doubt that a rank 1 group of competent SWF has a nearly equal survival rate to solo players. Any solo game I play, at least(And usually 3-4) die. Also, I don't think they should count hatch into those statistics, because anyone, SWF or otherwise can escape that. I want to see statistics purely based on people who run out the exit gates. I can guarantee that alone would put a much larger gap between SWF and solo
---
Claudette already has camouflage for nearly every map
---
Hahahah so many people run more than one exhaustion perk im like how???
---
This is pathetic. People can be so pathetic.
---
Plague is also the only killer in the game that is able to counter Adrenaline without any crazy addons.  Sadly she doesn't counter Mettle or Dead Hard, but her red puke does.  If you bring an apple then survivors are going to suffer, regardless of whether or not they cleanse themselves.
---
Looks pretty damn good, keep it up. Even though I just met you last night I look forward to checking in on more streams.
---
Cool
---
I don’t typically play survivor that much but when I do for any significant amount of time I’ll typically get at least one invite. Got one last night as a matter of fact. The Killer disconnected before the game loaded (thankfully didn’t lose my escape cake) at which point they told me to get the fuck out and called me the N word. 😑
---
Just comes to show how fast games go by, for a perk like ruin, which doesn't even help in chase, to be used more than perks like bamboozle or spirit fury which can dramatically shorten down the chase. It's the only perk that can screw over all four survivors simultaneously(Thana exists, but  10% slowdown is only 8 seconds per generator. As for dying light, it takes so long for it to procc that half the time, you've thrown the game by camping, or the game's over by the time the obsession dies)
---
I go in expecting to farm and play the hook everyone twice game, but every game has people going full try hard and being toxic so I have no choice but to kill them all. Then they have the nerve to complain I’m not farming or letting them get blood points.
---
... I thought this was from r/apexlegends when I first clicked XD
---
neither of those things mean that killer is considerably easier tho
---
There was a bug a few patches ago, at least for Leatherface, that made his chainsaw entirely silent, but as far as I know it was fixed. Maybe a bug, but you could start by verifying file integrity through Steam assuming you're a pc player
---
I was hitting a pretty bad stride for a while as killer and I was just looking for a decent match, and I brought an ebony mori. And then I see someone brought a BPS, so the guilt train started immediately, and then two people DC'd before the match started (including the person who brought the streamers) And I just decided to farm with the last two people, I probably wasn't gonna use the mori anyway but that was some major killer guilt.
---
it's nyan cat!
---
ikr
---
Thank you! I appreciate the kind words! It is very humbling to hear such good things And I look forward to the same!
---
LF literally runs around REEEEEEing
---
They follow a theme. Good god stop being such a fucking crybaby. OCD much?
---
Single blue tile in a bathroom of whites? All three of those perks are different color. All the bathroom tiles are different. BESIDES, if you’re using them in game, it won’t matter anyway since everyone mixes and matches perks anyway. 
---
Why the ever loving fuck are you whining about this?
---
thanks a lot &lt;3
---
"Regardless of how poorly they performed"
---
Excuse me but do you have any choice if killer tunnels you when someone unhooks you at the hook. So they performed poorly because they couldn´t do anything. I will dc if killer does not play fair. What a stupid idea. It should work the other way too right mate :)
---
So if survivours genrush or "bully" the killer he has to wait and it will encourage him to finish the game regardless of how poorly he performed.
---
aw, thanks! You just have to replace the perk icons that are in your game files with custom ones.
---
Pretty. Good. Job. So. Far.
---
Maybe you should message them to see if they want to farm...
---
i had to lmfaoo
---
Legion's emblem system is skewered. While nurse may be able to get a 4K the easiest, legion's good at protecting his rank, even when playing poorly
---
On pig
---
Ruin,thantaphobia,dying light,and overcharge.  Box o’ gears and tamperd timer 
---
You know, *to slow the game down just a lil’ bit*
---
Try again with grammar
---
Yeah god forbid you play a game just to have fun...
---
Oh, banana.
---
ive only ever played the doc for dailys but i can see why
---
Thot have you ever SEEN a balla Claudette? They look like glow sticks
---
This is me but with MK11.
---
&gt; Why learn how to chase when you can just stand still and purchase a good pair of headphones? 4Head.
---
wanna know how i know you don't play spirit?
---
Eh, I guess it's better to say that she's one of the two killers against whom Adrenaline doesn't really matter.
---
You won't get a heal vs Plague, and against Nurse the heal doesn't matter.
---
She does counter Mettle imo, if you get downed with just 3 hits then unless you had DS or get FL saved, you're dead.
---
My main is the Pig.  Like the Huntress and Billy too.
---
Michael myers baby
---
I guess no one in the sub can take a joke. I was joking saying this game is cancer so get a doctor who  specializes in cancer
---
There's nothing to bait out though, you use it to get extra distance out of range of the killer. It's free extra loops, as a killer you can't do anything if the survivor uses it for that purpose. You keep saying killers can bait it out, which makes me think you don't know how to use it lmao
---
why none play nurse on consoles?
---
good job bhvr lmao
---
if not the AoE part, it'd be fine
---
I'll put them in a google drive package later :)
---
this could called data shit because of the game
---
Me. Hag main, sometimes I play doctor, but 95% of my killer time is hag.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I vaulted the window and it lagged right as I vaulted so it immediately got blocked. Same thing happened to you, yet it was even more extreme so you never actually vaulted, but the check that blocks it when you go over it three times was activated.
---
Look I get it. You're trying to find a way to explain how lower killer queue times equates to the idea that people dont want to play like that as a killer therefore they dont play it.
---
I dont believe that's the case. If that was the case wouldnt there be players who just play killer but not play like that?
---
I would be more willing to bet that killer queue times are low because there simply isnt a lot of reason to play killer. You get a way higher chance of running into toxicity and often the experience is just frustrating especially without perks. There isnt much out there for learning how to play killer and while the initial ranks are fun as soon as you get to ranks higher than 10 it gets increasingly frustrating. There are some people who can handle it but in most cases a newer player will just straight out quit or go play survivor due to that frustration which obviously makes the killer pool a lot smaller.
---
You pretty much have to a. Reach rank 1 and b. Escape to stay at rank 1. You get tunneled once, you go back to rank 2.
---
Does Legion farm BP better than the Doctor?

Frank and Julie are together yes, you can tell by the description of some of their items, stuff like "A couple that kills together stays together" (not exact quote) or something.
---
Susie and Joey are not dating, Frank just got with Julie and Susie was Julie's best friend, afaik Joey just happened to be at a party and got along really well with the three.
---
Change the character give them a different weapon with the same insta down aoe mechanic n your opinion on it would be completely different.
---
You just see two chainsaw and link them as being the same.
---
The playstyle is nowhere near the same.
---
Also it depends on what teachable perks you have unlocked
---
Then you're going against killers that aren't especially good. /shrug
---
As Killer Legion gets a ton of Bloodpoints, especially in Brutality since every hit in Feral Frenzy gives quite a bit of BP. As Survivor Deep Wounds awards 100 Survival BP much like Snap Out of It, but allies can heal you for Altruism.
---
she's just a wendigo everyone
---
Well that explains it
---
SWEET! also, you've never gotten into any trouble with this? I haven't HEARD of anyone getting banned for it, and I did read a post earlier saying that the Devs apparently don't care if we use custom perks. But it also said that if the anti-cheat software picks it up and you get banned, they won't un-ban you either.
---
People usually take Dead Hard over Balanced Landing because DH is more fun to use. It's more interactive.
---
It's the only exhaustion perk which lets you press a button to make something happen, it kinda feels like a roll in Dark Souls.
---
Alright then buddy, you know everything about how to use Dead Hard. You're the Dead Hard Master. I should have never questioned someone with so much experience and wisdom about the best ever exhaustion perk
---
The only thing Iv'e done with game files before now is removing the intro video, because it's loud and annoying. Nothing negative has come of that. BUT every time the game updates, they add the video back in.
---
Ooh I like that
---
Feel like I have seen the exact same situation in a video lol I think otzdarva
---
So true.
---
duh because he was taught by the creature of the black lagoon
---
So... Maybe a couple reworks for these perks?
---
my god you are extremely smug and cunty
---
A surprise, for sure, but a welcome one.
---
I already agreed to that.  My original post was that they carry the same weapons.  Which is true.  The hammers are slightly different, but the whole point was that Billy was already made to be a Great Value Leatherface, so licensing Leatherface seems like an odd choice.
---
Anyone got any tips for the flashlight timing? I dont use them except for the double bloodpoint events so I dont know when to aim.
---
Same happened to me today.
---
It was a Hag - downed me, placed a couple of traps ('cause - you know - gotta get some points in, nevermind the fact that I could've done some repairs in the meantime to get some too, but who cares, right?!) and finally hooked me.
---
Thanks, Hag, very cool!
---
Nah, they do what they’re supposed to do. Just that there’s better options out there
---
well okay but also because no one just sits still while phasing like you said. congrats on wasting your power bar as the survivor gets a ton of distance
---
While bloodhunt i'm still wait 5 minutes for team.
---
My biggest thoughts on add-ons is tampered timer either needs to be removed, or changed so it is not as over powered as it is. IMO there should not be 2 add-ons that allow for extra boxes, even if one does give more time to the timer. It is redundant. The rule set is worthless imo, especially for the price. Most survivors either do a gen first anyway, or are already ticking when unhooked. pretty much the only add-ons I use at all are last will, combat straps, syringe, video tape, and sometimes Amanda's letter if I am feeling like I want to scare people.
---
Survivor wise level up: Claudette for self care, nea for balanced landing, then meg for sprint burst and adrenaline. The rest can be up to you knowing your level i would recomend Ash with Mettle of Man but you probably will mess up doing it.
---
Killer. 
---
I cannot stress this enough Hag please level up the hag, she has ruin and devour hope noth hex perks but at that rank the survivors struggle to find totems. Next is hillbilly for enduring trust it will come in handy. Hillbilly's coudin leathrrface for bbq, its not bad to have but there are a lot of counters to it so when you get to around rank 10 it wont be as reliable. So i would recommend freddy so yoh have an endgame perk available bloodwarden while situational is pretty strong at that rank. Next i would say Myers for STBFL(Save the best for last), its pretty good in concert with unrelenting which is a free perk, basically its fast recovery for connects and misses. Nurse is another one i would stress to level up Thantaphobia can help slow the game down enough for you to get certain things done, its no ruin but it help a lot. Spirit is probably the last major one i recomend spirit fury and rancor are great for starting out. When you use spirit fury make sure you have enduring. 
---
Now just general tips Stealth isnt praised as much as it should be, you dont need to run all the time, just hide or remain out of sight. For killer make swings count dont hit them until youre right on top of them. Make smart decisions on chases if the chase ladt for than 1 minute to a 1 minute 30 then leave and find someone else. Map pressure is a huge thing maintain pressure. I would recommend starting with trapper or billy and expand from there.
---
I've done but basically when I know I'm completely fucked in the next second anyway. Figure it adds like a couple seconds to the chase so might as well.
---
I won't farm. It's boring as hell, sorry for not being cool.
---
It's still way too boring for me to want to just farm. If I'm going into the game from either side I want to play the game out and try to achieve bloodpoints by good gameplay.
---
Asking the real questions
---
It is not run by people who are not afraid to be injured and are confident in their play. But that's probably around 5% of people. I play on ps4, and most people in red ranks runs self care + urban evasion combo and are terrified of killers. At high level people understand it's not worth wasting time healing and being scared, this is why adrenaline is one of the most popular perks.
---
Not really. There are a ton of aura reading perks. And distortion isn't even a good perk as is. If there was a way to get more tokens then it would be far better
---
Fun.
---
The official wiki doesn't mention it, I rare play Clown so I might've missed it. I'll check again later.
---
&lt;3
---
that is so sad and true tbh
---
They both feel the same to me &gt;.&gt;
---
Exactly the game would be better if instead of just one better option we have many equal different options. There's no reason that bad/unused perks go unnoticed just because the meta doesn't call for them.
---
Dew it!
---
Adjust your tv brightness to basically max and fuck with contrast and saturation. Trust me it works
---
Pretty much this. Also have accidentally locker juked when trying to vault a window
---
If you hit the locker it waits just a little extra time for the killet
---
Make sure to always report the farmers
---
Is that a fucking Mario 64 font
---
Every fucking game at least one guy: No BPS? Better quit and search a new game.
---
Well, a QOL buff to Monstrous Shrine would be cool.  
---
The killer should, in my opinion, be able to see the aura of the basements hooks at all times while using MS.
---
I WANT THEM
---
r/wholesomeDbD
---
First off head on takes 3 seconds so the locker juke with head on isnt a thing. I use head on every game and im red ranks so its not like im trash or something. The locker juke literally just buys time. Thats it. Youre out of options, nowhere near a window or anything so might as well make them miss an attack. Ive seen noob locker juke then 360 the killer and get away. Its always funny
---
SWF probably gets a massively higher escape rate on hatches in fact, since people will call out the hatch if they see/hear it as well, and will kill themselves on hook/dc if they're told the other person found the hatch. But yeah, I want to trust their statistics but they're not detailed enough, and in the past they've included some stuff that definitely skews the stats.
---
I will always say Freddy is a powerful killer and I will never understand what a hell people thinking calling him weak. I escape more against good billies than against Freddie's.
---
Farming sounds good to me, waiting sounds even better though.
---
That doesn't work. :)
---
Dwight’s background 😂
---
Guess we just die then :)
---
What rank are you? I wouldn't recommend using dead hard as it rarely works against killers with an iq higher than 10. (High rank killers usually) You should only stick with balanced landing.
---
Yeah, he is *a bit out there* so this should not be a surpise.
---
You can't really do that easily on pc
---
If you use the ebony mori during blood hunt, that goes beyond “playing how you want”. You’re doing it deliberately to ruin other people’s game, and deserved to get kicked in the face.
---
When this happens the killer only wants to farm points in the match. Not saying this is bad, but I don't wanna farm forever, I wanna play the game.
---
Wish I can rename titles but it’s for rank 1 killers as well
---
Playing killer is stressful, any killer main with more than 100 hours would agree, it's considerably less fun than playing survior
---
Have you seen the new graphs? Swf only adds an extra ~5% extra chance of survival. I don’t get it. Why do you have a problem with swf? I love playing against swf because they always have more personality.
---
Ive disscused that exact thing before. You get your speed boost at 2 tokens (althougth as many times as ive used devoure hope, Ive never even notice the speed boost). But 2 is too close to the insta down, but if a dull turned into devour hope after one hook, then it remains a dull long enough for survivors to be done with their initial exploring.
---
Just making conversation, my friend.
---
I'd love to use these. This is the first perk set I've seen that I genuinely would like to use. If you do end up uploading them let me know please &lt;3
---
I didn’t believe it until the stats were released.
---
At least crop it
---
Good to know
---
We'll Make It says at the bottom. It does not stack over 100%.
---
Theres a blast from the past, man i really wish these still existed
---
I'm sorry but what rank are you playing killer at vs survivor? The difficulties are reversed. At rank 20 to 15 for survivor the game is HARD because you have to rely on potato teammates. But at higher ranks it is much easier because they can look and genrush.
---
However at 20 to 15 as killer, the game is super easy for the exact same reasons it is hard as survivor... because they all suck. Similarly at purple and red ranks a killer's job is FAR harder because you'll get looped and genrushed and lose before the game even gets going.
---
I have no idea. It might just be my mind playing tricks on me.
---
Look man I got a doctor daily to mori someone and I’m all out of ivories
---
I want my 60k points
---
You’re both wrong, you can play how you want but being more confident and being good at chases is the most fun for most people, and helps your team the most
---
I’ve seen them jump into lockers by accident a few times lol
---
Also in regards to your edit: If Survivors didn't get such a huge burst of speed after being hit once then people would be way less inclined to play instadown Killers and the two high movement speed Killers who can actually catch up.
---
I do obviously think that it should come with some nerfs to instadowns and Nurse / Billy so that they're more in-line with everyone else. But I think a small general buff to every Killer would honestly be at least moderately tolerable.
---
I would love to get more then 5000 x 2 (thank you event)
---
🚨 IFUNNY WATERMARK 🚨
---
gl stabbing out there :)
---
Yep, don't like it? Come back Monday
---
So horny girls and men I guess, explain to me why you find murderous psychopath with captains Kirk mask and car mechanic suit hot?
---
That’s only really a problem in low ranks, high rank killers don’t have difficulty seeing those immersed Claudettes. You’ll get better at spotting them the more you play
---
Cheat? Youre a fucking idiot
---
thank you for being kind to the not dc'ers :)
---
You're allowed to play the game you paid for with any of the mechanics present in the game. The only thing that is "not" allowed is cheating through external programs or specifically exploiting to gain a significant advantage or ruin the fun for others. (Holding the game hostage.)
---
The thing that's surprising is how low it is. I didn't think people found survivor interesting enough to play on their own
---
You can't report the Killer for not killing. As u/OppositeBet said if you work with the Killer it's bannable but that's about it.
---
I agree, also you both pushing the blame at “get better at this part of the game” is childish and does not help anything
---
Dead hard only works if you know how to use it to reach a pallet or window, and sprint burst can be viable if you get your exhaustion to 1 second left
---
If you see a guy running something like level 1 dead heart and nothing else, you know he is hardcore.
---
I definitely wouldn't that buff small, it's actually really impactful.
---
Does anyone have the sheets on imgur or something? On mobile I can't click to enlarge the photos and zooming in makes ittoo blurry to see
---
You know im not even talking about the meme build right? I don't even use it. I was just talking about unhooking in general
---
It’s not supposed to help, this isn’t a tip thing this is a skill thing. This is like asking “how do I get better at throwing hatchets” and accusing people who say “play huntress more” of being childish
---
Camping yeah probably but tunneling not at all
---
For Survivor, I would level up *Claudette* first. She has Self Care, which is very useful at low ranks and playing solo. She has Empathy, which will help you get a better understanding of where the killer is (since you can see whoever the Killer has hit, it helps you figure out who is in a chase and whatnot). Then I would suggest *Meg*, because Adrenaline is amazing. Sprint Burst can help if you're bad at chases. I would level *Feng* because Alert is another great learning perk (shows you the killer every time they break a pallet, kick a generator etc. so gives you a lot of data) and Lithe which can be used in place of Sprint Burst (or Balancing Landing or Dead Hard as your exhaustion, "help me get away" perk).
---
this is an argument?
---
he actually survived the drowning he just chose to live in the woods after that for some reason 
---
then he started killing people 
---
the he died for real in part 4
---
then in part 6 he came back as a zombie
---
I got ebony mori nurse with 3 blinks who tunneled off hook 3 times while using my streamers last night. I got called a cringe lord for being mad at that for the 3rd time :)
---
Being able to last in a chase is a crucial part of the game, you shouldn’t rely on immersion and be completely incapable to fend for yourself once found
---
It's a running joke
---
I literally just stated I want to play the game normally, at no point is that what I stated. But it's fine to do that, as long as you're having fun. It's a video game after all.
---
Looks like a discussion of preferences, so I don't think either of you are right or wrong. They were a little rude telling you that you don't understand the game tho
---
I also use those, but I don’t do risky saves unless the killer is a camper or it’s end of game.
---
I’m also guilty of: MoM &amp; DH combos.
---
It's 2 minutes per hook, plenty of time to have some bananas.
---
Ty. Honest I don't play that way Was checking for double stsndards
---
I thought you were talking about me until the DC part.
---
Im a mediocre survivor at best and i work through ruin easily. I've been getting much better at hex skill checks and it really isn't that hard. Killers absolutely need something to slow the game down otherwise mid tier killers have no time to chase.
---
Every lobby I go in as killer at rank 4-5, the survivors just work through it. Sure they don't hit every hex skillcheck but enough for ruin to not matter much.
---
My problem isn't spotting them and with basic killers that primarily use m1 I can get by just fine. It's just that my eyes aren't the best and blendettes tend to 'blend' in with dark environments a lot easier when it's coupled with fast moving killers like nurse, spirit specifically.
---
 It doesn't help that these particular killers have a small window in which to use their attacks effectively.
---
Yea I dont get it, playing as killer you're getting that fat bbq stack which gives you more bp plus they save and heal everyone wins if you saw me put BPS I'm not gonna kill you I'm just trying to gets stacks better then the survivors who put on WGLF and instant save you in front of a killer who is just trying to play the game and you end up dying
---
Same. On top of that I only got super toxic trolls today that did nothing but bm and teabag. Seems like they were high ranks purposefully deranking for the event to be asshats, because no way all my games should have P3 survivors being dicks to a rank 16 killer.
---
I like it, could make games a lot more interesting!
---
Was about to upvote then I looked in the corner. Professionals have STANDARDS.
---
Each their own. I also prefer females over male characters in general, but thats another story.
---
The thing about Noed, is it should not be considered by killers that can do great without it, and leave it for the killers that are less skilled, because it makes the casual killers a bit more scary.
---
If Noed was taken out, less skilled killers would get laughed at, and that should not happen. Every killer should be a threat, and there is no excuse for having bad killers going against good survivors. Thus, Noed. A deterrent to being arrogant when you recognize the killer is not adept. 
---
Also, gens are not the killers objective, they are just hot spots for finding survivors. The best Killers don't even bother kicking gens, and can get away with it.
---
The ranking system says gen protection is an objective, but that has to be changed. There is no way for any killer to protect gens vs good survivors, and the only thing left is hooking and killing. I've seen and played 4k games with Irridescent on all but gatekeeper. Sometimes a 12 hook 4k with 0 points on GK. That's an indication that gen control is not up to the killer.
---
You shouldn’t be ascared of chases. You gotta get chased, to build up those sweet Boldness category points. Also yeah, having a good chase is fun for both killer and survivor. If you never get hooked, sure that’s cool... but also means less altruism points for everyone in the long run. Sometimes it’s your turn to get hooked- sometimes it’s your turn to distract the killer in a chase. Spread the work load, comrade.
---
Well that's the thing she's the only character with a benefit to her. She's also female which gives her a smaller frame. How is that fair?
---
This is do cool how can I download this?
---
Thanks man. Took me a bit to come up with these and make them balanced.
---
The problem with Balance Landing is not that it's boring, but it's map dependent. On maps like Ironworks of Misery, Coal Tower, Haddonfield, Badham Preschool, The Game, Crotus Prenn Asylum, Father Campbell's Chapel, Mother's Dwelling and The Temple of Purgation, Balance Landing creates very, very strong loops due to his passive effect and you can waste a lot of the killer time with it, but on maps like Shelter Woods, Wrecker's Yard, Rotten Fields or Family Residence is not that good. Yeah, you can still use BL even on these maps if you know where hills ( or in case of Shelter Woods the tree ) are, but it's probably not gonna help you so much and his passive effect it's not gonna make such a different.
---
Dead Hard is just more consistent ( even if smart killers can bait it out ), because it's not map dependent and you can use it without worrying about map layout.
---
A lot of survivors on ps4 at rank 1 are really bad
---
These are badass! Reply whenever Killer perks are done!!
---
I mean most players past 10 hours have more fun being chased but you do you. 
---
Looking for immersed survivors has to be the most boring thing ever

Seriously, in that case especially I'd farm. Hook each twice, let them wiggle free a few times and let them pallet and flashlight stun, then leave. Takes under ten minutes.
---
it can be a last second ttime waster if you know you are gonna be downed no matter what.
---
[you'd be surprised how many people swing multiple times at a locker](https://www.twitch.tv/brobq/clip/SweetZanyShrewBabyRage)
---
Perhaps, though according to the devs, camping and tunneling are valid strategies, I'll play the game the way you want me to, it'll give me a good 12k during this holiday and I'll give everyone else that sweet 64k ish.
---
Banana Land
---
Yeah, it’s very little, but it’s a good add on.
---
I mostly play against high rank survivors and that is not at all my experience when I have ruin on
---
Also BL is pretty boring on top of all that.
---
Only get the top one, and it's a nurse who tunnels off hook too :) 4k bps each x 400%, amazing killer got a whopping 14.5k
---
I have the Hatch trophy left too! We could do It together if you want

You did fine. You escaped and completed the goal. You also had fun which is most important. :)
---
As killer I would rather have a teabagging bm survivor then an immersed urban crawldette.  Immersion is painfully boring for both sides.  Not difficult mind you, immersed survivors generally cost their teamates more games than they win for them but still painfully  boring nonetheless.  As both a killer and survivor I want action not hiding so hard I'm falling asleep at the wheel.

---
okay troll detected
---
Sorry to hear about your DC
---
Iconic.
---
Yes, being the map would definitely help with killing survivors.
---
Why would you report them tho
---
&gt;Band-Aid fix
---
Bruh, it's the original online multiplayer lobby format, that was ditched for anonymous random lobbies that you can't do anything about if someone cheats or is a toxic asshole.
---
SWF is 4 people that are friends and won't BM eachother, totally willing to BM the killer because there is no sense of sportsmanship. The killer is nobody to them. In a big lobby system, the killer is part of the group, and there is little room for bad blood. 
---
If a survivor calls me bad, and brags about getting a 4k vs 4 SWF as Freddy and no perks, then he can put his money where his mouth is and swap with me to back it up, but we have a system where people can lie, and BM, and gloat even if they die. 
---
Fuck that shit. We should all get out of games and have constructive criticism and accolades, not toxic shit shows.
---
What advantage. It literally shows a less than 50% survival rate for 4mans. The game becomes balanced with 4mans its in the killers favor otherwise.

So this is what the third chapter of MGS5 would have been like.
---
I havent had any of the issues you speak of on Xbox. I never have lobbies that freeze during loading.
---
If you plan on using items and searching chests and using those items it's a decent perk to have. 2 uses out of a brown med kit. Maybe pushing 3 if you're using botany knowledge as well. Flashlights that last all match, toolboxes that can rip through 3 full gens and a half. (Still only going to get 1 gen done with a brown toolbox. Yellow and green gonna wreck gens though.) The perk everyone sleeps on just because it isn't "meta" is way more useful than anyone gives it credit for.
---
Drinking with friends while playing DBD! Even tho I don’t have any 🙃
---
I hear that and I agree but I also gotta point out it is hard to get better when you get stomped on either side. 
---
If you get downed in 10 seconds you learned very little besides "dont do that"
---
If you get super gen rushed and looped the entire game you get absolutely no feedback on what worked and what didnt. 
---
This compounds the problem vs killers bc they feel like they need to camp or tunnel because there are few easily accessible resources to get better. They certainly exist but knowing how to run loops is something that there isnt a lot of resources out there to help.
---
For survivors at least you can learn from loops where the killer is visible by simply avoiding them.
---
But there isnt such learning with how to run say the double window L wall and T wall loops and others. I actually didnt know about what are the conditions for a slow vault for the longest time or how to manipulate which direction the loop is going so the vault is slow.
---
I approve this

---
As a killer main and someone who also plays a decent bit if survivor when my friends are on, farming is boring as shit. Even during bloodhunt. Only ever farm when there are DC's and steamers are used, or only 2 survivors in a match.
---
No problem, glad to help
---
The 28th can't come here fast enough.
---
one thing goes wrong? better rage quit and fuck my team
---
Why not both!? 😂
---
God I remember when dailies were opening a gate for 5000 BP
---
Yea, apparently we're losers for that lol. I will farm/agree to farm if there's only 2 survivors or a DC and party streamers are used. But even then that's not a steadfast rule.
---
I dunno man, I’ve seen a ton of people on discord actually thirsting over Myers. And Huntress. And Nurse and Spirit...
---
Whereas the only person we should be thirsting over is Bubba with his beautiful body~
---
Heres my take on it. Ruin isnt that hard to deal with and I can do gens with it there, I sometimes will do 1 gen, but a lot of the time i go looking for it. For me its alright, but it is the most annoying perk just because its in 9 out of 10 games. It gets boring having to look foe ruin every time and I wish I was up against mpre variety, but what can you do.
---
What else would you call abusing an external system to apply an advantage for yourself in a video game? A strategy?
---
Ah, I see by your opinion and by your username that I have encountered someone of culture like myself.
---
I disagree on adam, he's pretty big and i've never had issues with him.
---
From what I remember and correct me if i'm wrong females breathe heavier and have louder pain noices. My issue isn't with the size differences between characters. My issue is with claudette being able to turn invisible in some grass. I'm not asking for every character to be the same, it would be nice if they could just brighten her cosmetics a little.
---
What if they disabled Ebony Moro during blood hunt? Oh what a dream.
---
I killed it with the ones that you had to escape with an item 2 times, pretty sure that's how I got my P3 Nea
---
Part VIII in the sewers as well
---
lol, you didnt see the whole match, it was the second time it happened in THIS match, I've had enough dbd for today :)
---
Impossible to prove you wrong when your so right
---
These are very annoying. Sorry mate.. Mine was a cannibal who immediately hooked me I must say that I didn't move and flickered into the sky with my flashlight tho.
---
It doesn't add to humor of the meme at all.
---
It's true
---
     The full tombstone moderately decreases movement speed and takes tremendously more Evil Within(time spent stalking) to get Tier III. At Tier III you can grab and kill any healthy or injured survivor within range at no penalty to your power meter. 
---
The Tombstone piece however, only takes considerably more energy and has no movement penalty. You get to do the same thing with the killing survivors, but only once, as it instantly drains your power meter back to Tier II
---
Not bHVR's fault some people are just dipshits.
---
It doesn't take away from it. Besides, plenty of things in the picture (like a lot of the background details) don't *add* to the humour. Should they be erased too?
---
so you can kill 1 survival with the piece but with the J Tombstone you can kill all of them?
---
\*Gets Moried
---
Hell yeah!
---
My reaction always.
---
3 people in that game assumed you were gonna camp. I never camp so that every survivor with narrowed time has a wasted perk :p
---
Complaining about whispers?? Dude nó. I am cool with farming, just some people would complain about it or be okay with it but whine about a different play style. I picked one of the more "toxic" plays. BTW moonwalk is part of the game because it helps in mind games.
---
Truth
---
Doctors power does more than any other killers power though. It can stop vaults and pallets like you said but it also makes it so survs cant work on gens unless they snap out of it, cant use items, cant heal skillchecks shake on sides of screen makes it so doctor can see you with illusions, makes you scream so yoy cant stealth and then his add ons fuck with survivors more. Im not disagreeing with you, maybe he does need a buff but to say he has nothing is a lie. No other killer has as much utility built into their power
---
This is definitely me right now. I heard my friend let out a little cough on the mic though so I'm gonna say I can't go cause I don't wanna get the black plague
---
Ok thanks :)
---
As killer I've been getting a lot more toxic tryhards, and as survivor a bunch of facecampers. It's ridiculous that the assholes of our community can't even get their shit together for double bloodpoints. Why tunnel survivors or teabag the killer this weekend?? It's baffling.
---
the only legion I faced used double blade and mocked us for not pushing gens fast enough
---
I’ve just P1 Claud and I’m starting to get ultra rare offerings appear when I had never seen them before on it but that’s the only noticeable difference so far, nearly P2 though!
---
Last night I legit I started wondering if something is wrong with my game. I prestiged Nurse and David all the way to P2 without ever seeing a BP in the blood web. I saw a couple people using it, but so far zip for me.
---
Jone’s BBQ and foot massage
---
Nyan cat FTW.
---
You can kill all with either of them but with the piece every time you get a kill it drains and you have to fill it up again.
---
Yeah, i mean i get so many people asking me why I prestige, then ask me how i have so many ultra rare offerings and add ons
---
Why do I experience this problem more than others then if it's not me. In these swf games I am often the only one to drop, even if it's only me.
---
^^^^ I'm bouta head out
---
The increase at rank 1 or huge jump is an oversight. It jumps because those people that depip get placed in rank 2 and then get counted. So the data is skewed. The person who made the post commented on it
---
I've only ever done it just to avoid getting hit during a chase
---
Jack breaking hooks
---
David avoiding the killer while trying to get to you with WGLF and NM
---
You’re not making a lick of sense
---
To be honest I like the idea a lot but non of these perks would be really worth using. They all actually not that strong to get picked over to other perks. Thickened flesh seems more like a disadvantage after all because you get so slow after the hit that it would be like a worser Version of MoM that can get triggered more then once but don't give you as much distance and chase potential. The altruistic one has no purpose or I'm missing it. Why should you get exposed for the effect of aura reading and unhookinf unnecessary fast? 
---
The first one for killer has no effect because no killer would actually benefit from this effect also the downsides and the timer makes it useless anyway. 
---
The Endgame on would only work with Remember me, Bloodwarden, Bitter Murmur and Noed. But that's not possible because you can only  equip two of these. Also it let you play perkless the whole match
---
As a survivor my favorite to have on my team is Quentin.  A Quentins seem to always be willing to be sacrificed to get me out of the gate.  I play Dwight though because he’s cute.
---
My least favorite is Kate.  I’ll be on a hook and see someone running to me and her hair bugs out and I’m like just go away.  She’ll undoubtedly grab the killer’s attention during her journey and loop my hook until second state then desperately unhook me while the killer is breaking a pallet two feet from my face.
---
As a killer I hate Claudette’s as they are the first to flame if their stealth strategy didn’t work.  Love Neas as they’ve seen too much Noob3 and make the shortest chases.
---
You can use dead hard when jumping out but its pretty useless
---
Because it’s fun as fuck. Gonna go down anyway cuz killer is so ez, might as well have some laughs jumping in and out of lockers.
---
Assuming you didnt hit space too late this shouldve been a guaranteed vault
---
It's noticeable for sure, but it also means that it's gonna take you 2 or 3 times as many BPS to max the tree out, which makes farming for perks a pain :p
---
oh right, woops.
---
Somebody yesterday got like 256k on a screenshot and said it was the most possible
---
He wouldnt
---
i think it's just a trend rn. someone made or shared a pretty cool set a little while ago and that made people want to try (and by extension, share) their own, i think.
---
regardless if it happened 100 times. Rage quitting is fucking stupid this why it should be punished with 1 hr time out up until 2 weeks. How are you that weak minded that you need to leave a game lol.
---
Lol, I wasn't hatch camping. Once I encountered the bug I stopped playing and started experimenting with it. I had no intention of winning or I wouldn't have hooked the other person I downed. I don't know why people assume the worst. Especially since I let him go by smacking him at the end.
---
Abusing!? 10/10 nice trolling. You got me
---
Eh, as long as you know how the bloodweb works I havent had much of an issue, it seems to me like there are just as many common, and less uncommon and rare to make room for the ultra rare
---
Legion and Freddy. I love them so much asethically, but they don't do my rank any favors
---
Pretty much. Helps with people trying to get that one difficult achievement
---
I’ve been having a ton of fun using bond, iron will, head on, and quick and quiet.
---
You can fix it by unreadying and readying again
---
It really do b like that
---
Obviously he wouldn't LOL.
---
Fast vault would save my life there.
---
Prob right but that's all the extra bp perks I could find. No wonder i filled my exp red circles so fast. Each trap popped I think said 800.
---
On Xbox legion is basically billy.
---
I’ve found that coming from an angle like around a corner or something won’t let me fast vault most of the time.
---
yes he would have. the myers ran that completely wrong
---
Can confirm Billy best boi
---
yes he would. whether or not you fast vaulted would be irrelevant if he ran the right route
---
I recorded my game and time was at just over 7 min.
---
Trapping the hook isn't camping you ding-dong, it's just using their power. Just crouch or use a flashlight. That's literally all it takes to render her unable to teleport back to the unhook.
---
Out of all the inside jokes that could have spawned within this community, it still amazes me that shirtless Myers is the longest running of them all. How'd it even start?
---
On that note, ^^Mori Me Daddy^^
---
If they do that then yeah I totally agree, there wouldn’t be a need for a buff. I kinda have faith that they’ll get around to doing that in the next year. We’ll have to see anyway.
---
how are hit boxes relevant in this clip? the issue is that the fast vault didn't proc for some reason. it has nothing to do with hit boxes
---
I mean this shows theres more OoO users than SS
---
I personally only prestige’d today because it’s double BP and I wanted the achievement to do so, but apart from that I wasn’t aware it made much of a difference. I shall keep testing as I move Claud up and see what stuff she gets!
---
I use....exactly one of those (Iron Will).
---
I think my absolute favorite time I trapped a survivor was when I hit a Claudette with my normal M1 and using her little post-hit speed burst she ran directly into a bear trap about 5 feet in front of her at the entrance of a jungle gym.
---
Lmao it's crazy some survivors dont understand the common signs of farming for any killer hit the gen with m1, I play wraith so I just ring my bell and look deep within their souls @-@
---
What fix would they put in to prevent people from leaving, other than taking out the pause menu?
---
Tuft has to be paired with the full Tombstone. The piece will put you back in Evil II. Beware though, it takes insane amounts of evil to power up Tuft+Full Tombstone, you pretty much have to drain everyone fully. I'd suggest also throwing up an offering for a map that's not a pain in the ass for Michael and stalking.
---
You can delay space bar pretty late and still get a fast vault. It's actually necessary on some very tricky spots (cow tree, suffocation pit, ironworks vault etc.), allowing you to run just a little bit longer to guarantee your fast vault. 
---
This really should've been a fast vault.
---
yup, sadly doesnt increase the total BP
---
Tbh I hate playing in lower ranks because there way to often dumb survivors. I don’t want to end up there just because I got facecamped or two Claudettes waiting for the farm two sec after killer hooked me. If I lose because I sucked, I don’t do it. I deserve the detail then. But if stuff like this happens... I don’t know :/ it doesn’t hurt anyone does it
---

The problem is, Claudette is inherently more stealthy than most, if not all, other survivors. Survivors are meant to be interchangeable skins, and be no better or worse than any other.
---
It's perfectly fine for the chainsaw tho
---
I've validated twice. and full reinstalled twice.
---
People with attitudes like this give the actually chill PS4 players a bad rep.
---
Adjusting your settings isn't cheating.....
---
They already confirmed that there will never be a killer that disguises themselves as a survivor. This is why legion has frenzy instead despite their trailer.
---
This is still my phones background from when the dude posted it up on reddit when he created it, I was hoping an updated version would be whipped up sooner or later
---
ohhhhhh i get it now..! thank you so much 👍👍👍❤️
---
Are you serious? How the heck was this a hit box issue and not an issue with the fast vault being buggy?
---
$20 says it would be bugged like Legion's blades. Every time you shocked a survivor they wouldn't be able to use pallets and windows for the next &lt;checks watch&gt; five hours.
---
The other day I ran into two traps on The Game so I’m feelin this pretty heavy right now
---
I get you did not wanna farm and that’s fine but your sorta a ass for just making them bleed out instead of just hooking them
---
I just don't like that it's no scratch marks and no aura. If Freddy loses you, that's essentially 30 seconds of saying "fuck you" to the only power he has, while you get half a minute's potential to escape the dreamworld with no warning to Freddy. Thankfully, there's only 3 tokens, but still.
---
P3 and paid
---
Lery’s? That stupid bathroom window
---
I was more so thinking about making the game playable without having a mental breakdown.
---
are those the official stats?
---
If so, where is DS lol
---
Wooosh
---
Ahhhh! I knew that was gonna happen I got so nervous for you as soon as you got on the totem!
---
I'll say it: it's not cool /u/RetroGamer1224
---
I didn't woosh. their point is batfuck stupid
---
But how will they know I'm really a Dwight if l am not bond trolling?
---
Adam in his black coat and trousers is as stealthy as a Claudette, I know because that is my stealth main if I feel like I cba with chasing and I have hidden in some fantastic spots with that skin.
---
yea i know i realized that, i just thought they would've gotten the message without me having to cheese free hooks
---
It’s cute but it might piss fans off. Being how Michael is supposed to be scary.
---
Have you tried upping the brightness on your screen?
---
"noun bad" bad
---
Sure certain characters have certain cosmetics that let them blend well in certain parts of certain maps.
---
 The thing with claudette is she doesn't need to be in a certain part of a map to stealth well all she needs is darkness which is a pretty major thing across most maps.
---
 She is the jack of all trades when it comes to stealth. The issue is she's unfairly rewarded due to 2 cosmetics that highten her stealth capabilities. And i'm not saying she's gamebraking or this needs to be fixed immediately, she just shitty to go against on dark maps 
---
I don't play nurse that much at all actually, I prefer spirit and wraith.
---
DBD becomes a completely different game when you’re drunk
---
It's a decent way to waste just that tiny bit of extra time if you're gonna be hit anyway.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/
---
That happened to me and my friends twice in a row.
---
Meanwhile, I can have a perfect game everyone 3 hooked and still not be max in the sacrifice category.
---
The Pig, The Trapper, The Shape
---
They do. As you said, it's a bloodhunt. It's generally accepted that during bloodhunt, especially with bps, everyone works together to get the most out of the event and offering. If that makes you tilted then use the bp offering made for individual players instead of the one that benefits everyone.
---
I used to main huntress but I play plague now. I still play huntress occasionally though if I feel like getting curbstomped.
---
I know but it isn't live yet. I prefer cooldown und extended frenzy
---
I think the game was better before all aura revealing perks. It was more fun to play stealthy. This game was supposed to be a stealth game in the beginning.
---
Give Dwight hatch
---
Lol you have too much faith. It is hard as a survivor to know who is a farming killer and not, why I appreciate them messaging in lobby. If you don't want to do it just play the game normal they will work it out when you hook everyone and if they don't you get kills and if they DC ohwell you don't wanna farm anyway so move on to the next game.
---
Amazing. I'd love to use these
---
What isnt cool?
---
It's then fact that he's not scary in this that makes it funny.
---
Sorry I meant more so "if people are" instead of "if you are". Bad habit.
---
I know it's easy to straw man but I don't think there is anything wrong with people not being interested in farming every game.
---
I try to get points via normal gameplay, if the survivors are making it clear to me that they want to farm I'll try to oblige them, but I don't think anyone should shame others for wanting to play the game normally and just treat the 2x points as a bonus.

---
My point is that is in no way a good measure of one's skills. You could be a shit survivor, hide the entire match while your team does 2 gens and play for hatch, escaping. As killer it almost pigeon holes you into playing only a couple of the killers with meta builds.
---
Your idea in no way accounts for the normal game flow of a match and instead forces people into a scenario where playing selfishly or only with meta perks is the required way of play in a game that was made to have options and variety.
---
You could still easily de-rank by dying on first hook or standing in a corner as killer.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I definitely still love a good mind game. My builds are just geared more towards a "I'm phasing, what are you gonna do about it" style. I typically run Save The Best For Last and reduced charge time add-ons. I'll also throw on a Mother Daughter Ring and end chases in under 10 seconds when SBTFL is at 8 stacks and I'm not being a boosted potato.
---
Make your choice-for when nerds touch other survivors
---
Love these! I really hope the devs offer like a perk skinpack thing officially in the game so console players can get them too.
---
I never said that this instance was just a hit box issue lmao. Learn to read &amp; stay in school.
---
G R O O V Y
---
SPINE CHILL IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!
---
that's really well explained (not to say that others here aren't as helpful!), i really appreciate it. 
---
between this and the other suggestions here, it sounds like i'll be going for claudette/nea/meg/david/feng min, and for killers it's looking like hag/nurse/bubba

I found this pack online! Copy the icons to the usual folder and you will have the custom sky pack!
---
I know this is a joke but I’m gonna comment so I can see when someone takes this seriously
---
I'd love for there to be SOMETHING for getting a direct bottle hit.  Increased slow duration or even more visual disorientation, just...  SOMETHING for a direct hit that's already tough to land
---
With pc you only get salt from the morons that paint giant neon targets on their back by having ttv in their name. Its honestly really funny how upset people get. All you have to do is bring a mori into the game and roughly 3/10 times the ttv person just DC's because they think it's for them and only for them. 
---
Only other time people get salty is a basement bubba.
---
Scrubs playing as legion is no joke. Play as Freddie kramer if you think you really get the skills for 4ks
---
That’s actually not correct. Red was red ranks, blue-purple is purple ranks, and green is green ranks. They did not incorporate yellow or brown because people run whatever they have when they are starting out
---
""noun bad" bad" bad
---
Damn, they buffed flashlights hard as hell /s
---
This tbh. Most of the killer perks are aura-centric (ie. finding the survivors, like Nurse's Calling), and several are there to slow the game down (Ruin). Survivor perks are, like you said, second chances. Stuff like Dead Hard, Sprint Burst, BT, Adrenaline, etc etc etc are indeed second chances that are there to be used AFTER you fuck up.
---
Wish survivors had more of a variety of perks about different things. As of now, everyone's running one or two "well, technically I should be downed, BUT, I got this perk that lets me gtfo". super annoying
---
If we're being entirely honest, Adam isn't so much a Neckbeard as he is screwed over completely.
---
I mean, yeah he wanted a wife and yeah he was an asshole, but his circumstances are quite a bit different than any neckbeard.
---
I just made a post with some add-ons now and consolidated everything else with it. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bke612/new_killer_concept_the_plank/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

*myers is shirtless*

this must be a shit post lol
---
Obvious troll.
---
Nea is my favourite
---
Yeah,  the two extremes are expecting to farm every game or the people who want to ruin people's fun and fuck them out of BP. I wish people would just play normally.
---
I play in console, i dont have gg
---
Oh please, no more visual distortion.
---
I legit get motion sickness vs Clown and I know that there is a lot of people who also have that problem.
---
There's nothing wrong with it but you have those people who get freaking triggered because people want Bloodpoints.
---
I was like a deer in headlights I was backing away from it like don’t hurt me please.
---
Let's forget about tgat...
---
I’d recommend iron will over premonition. Stops them from hearing you in lockers
---
I don't even care if I'm good as Myers, I just want this reaction out of survivors.
---
Obvious self care scrub

Every time id use streamers on killer the survivors always gen rush and I get no points

Ive been hearing this issue all day. Just got off work gonns be on in probably 30 min hope its gone by then

Piss off
---
And I'm the other 50% haha
---
You know what? This is the first coloured perk icon set that I don't absolutely despise. I might use this, but a few critiques:
---
* Jake's perks should all be one colour, I think green. They look out of place comapred to all the other teachables
---
* Feng Min's perks still look messy. I still think there's a better way you could design those
---
* Claudette's, Meg's, and Ace's seem a bit too bright compared to the rest. I think you should try and mute the colours like you did for Jane
---
Other than those few gripes, these are perfect! I escpecially like that you gave each non-teachable its own flair :)
---
Lol survivor mains. “If you don't play by my fake rules you deserve to be physically beaten”
---
As a killer main, nothing beats being drunk and getting spooked when you turn a corner and theres an unexpected survivor right there.
---
...Don't start. We don't wanna go down that rabbit hole.
---
Do u know any other insults besides scrub, or is that just how ur rolling today?
---
Farming gets boring, yeah, but people just need to expect it this weekend. Collect your bp and wait till Tuesday. 
---
That said, Killers who spend the whole "farm" game downing people so other Survivors can pick them up drive me batshit. There's more to farm than just heals and hits. Mix that shit up a bit, I'm getting carpal tunnel.
---
I got teabagged at exit gates for that.
---
not sure I just saw them on a forum
---
That is honestly the first time I've ever read a somewhat argumentative reason to use NOED, although I still can't bring myself to use it. It's just the game, but on "Easy" mode.
---
Legion is either broken or he is OP, cant this lot make up their mind?
---
I don't think I've ever struggled with Malicious and Chaser when playing Legion. If he's good for something, it's getting points in those two categories.
---
Lol. Then remove Mettle of Man, Adrenaline und Borrowed Time.
---
Yes I know that. I am comparing it to the number of people playing dbd a month ago to that playing rn who opted in. Using that I am making a general comparison
---
Somebuddy suggested that we might be getting Ghostface as the next licensed killer, there was someone with the rights to the character on twitter saying news about him would drop soon.
---
But honestly, that’s probably what Legion is, a B-Movie knockoff of Ghostface. Just like how Trapper is Jason and Billy is Leatherface.
---
I had my messages disabled for a while, then opened them again. So far I haven't gotten too much from people. Probably 2 negative ones from two dipshits and one positive one from someone I gave the hatch to. Other than that, people have been pretty chill on hatemail. On PS4 at least.
---
I had 4 dc's with the hag so I will main her 😄. Also I like the spirit
---
You'll need to remove my foot from your ass first
---
I absolutely love myers and Sam, I now suddenly want a sam killer but idk how that would even work
---
Ah. That makes sense and was wise on your part, I don't believe it would have been appreciated to link hacking here.
---
And then you struggle out of it while they pick up the trap in confusion while you drop a pallet on them.
---
Just for you, ill use my moris during the bloodhunt
---
That's fucking shitty, sorry to hear that.
---
This is adorable 🥺
---
She is just so simple to use and understand if you think just for a second. You can't really loop her if you know how to use traps. Her only downside is big maps like swamp
---
I love the Spine Chill one!
---
I am so glad this went where I was hoping it would.
---
Love me a good shitpost
---
#10/10 wood be a great killer
---
Translation: I played a high tier killer at low ranks and it was EASY. Killer is EASY.
---
Typical survivor main clown.
---
There was one game I played where I was the dying light obsession and I was hooked. The Michael had just hooked someone across the map and everyone was hook diving him and left me there across the map to sit on the hook. I ended up dying my first hook that game and I really hope they enjoyed their penalty. I don't think anyone made it out that match.
---
I fucking lost my farm bloodpoints 2 times. Survivor pudding and bps once.
---
Slap another trap down there and then patrol it like the big boys do, amateur.

---
These look so good! Pog!
---
I got that one game for no reason once lol
---
I’m gonna call bs that you’ve NEVER rage quit before buddy.
---
I cleanse totems as I come across them.  But NOED is 100% on the survivors, it's a 100% avoidable situation.
---
&gt; It is hard as a survivor to know who is a farming killer and not
---
i agree with the rest of your comment other than this statement. if the killer wants to farm they will initiate it by hitting gens
---
For a second there I thought you referenced from Ed,Edd and Eddy lol
---
Plus, killers are spooky. Unless you stand there waking a gen and staring at them, most will assume the worst.
---
Waaa I died in video game better DC
---
Or a shard
---
When I'm off work, I'll PM you my steam friend link. Add me and let's play!
---
There is a ton of people with custom perks that stream this game to the public, if these were bannable they'd all get punished by now.
---
This meme wasn't used right.
---
Just saying.
---
&gt;It's generally accepted that during bloodhunt, especially with bps, everyone works together to get the most out of the event and offering
---
I know, and I obviously adjust my playstyle to accomplish that during bloodhunt. But I still want to play and use my streamers without farming
---
I’m sorta new to this game but what is farming?
---
Tye thing is you can actually get in trouble for abusing the report function on not reportable offenses
---
I guess, I just like stacking the BPS to get a ton of bloodpoints at once even though its not actually any more. 
---
&gt;don't just slug people and walk away if you aren't trying to farm, because that's taken as a sign that you are initiating farming.
---
youre right
---
Dude you will bleed out. Glhf :D
---
Like the idea of perks that are strong but have severe drawbacks
---
At least when you’re the first survivor found he doesn’t insta tier3 on you🙂
---
People attack him on sight because he looks like a monster, and he wants a companion because literally no human will accept him or talk to him.
---
Then deal with the salt my guy. You don't need to bend to how others play but they don't have to play by your rules either
---
Not like there's anything hard about repairing gens when you're not the one being chased.
---
I undertuned them on purpose because people like to mass-downvote overpowered stuff
---
Lighthouse Legion
---
That too, but those are far more rare than Shrouds. I had only one experience with a shard. I actually forgot shards were even a thing.
---
Basically not killing survi it's and working with the killer via paper stuns, letting yourself be hooked only twice to not die etc to maximize bloodpoint gains for each side. Since it 2x bloodpoints people want to farm but not everybody wants to farm that's the issue a lot of people face. It's up to you whether you want to farm or not but if you want / 100000 blood points in one match I recommend it
---
Okay, thanks dude
---
Hmm most of the matches I’ve been in there’s been salt
---
&gt; none are thiccer than Best-Boy Bubba
---
I think the clown would like a word
---
Botany Knowledge + Pharmacy is my go to healing. I can get two quick heals and keep the kit even if I lose some charge by Franklin's Demise or missing a skill check (which helps against Freddy).
---
I can also get one heal out + my teammate I give the medkit get one heal too even if they have no healing efficency perks and still keep the kit. I do this normally if they ask for heals but I have priority on something else.
---
Botany Knowledge is nice for really cutting off healing time on everything too. Like 5.33 secs off a normal heal or 6.66 secs off Sloppy Butcher. It saves a lot of time healing.
---
I've used separation shrouds as doc, and had all survivors scream next to eachother so who knows how well it actually works. 
---
There's also splinters that are hidden, but who would want to play as Perkless Freddy?
---
Leatherface uses his chainsaw far more responsibly. Everyone knows you shouldn't run with a chainsaw.
---
I'm using Monstrous Shrine AMA.
---
I told my team I was gonna burn bps.
---
Jk I burned Gideon offering
---
Yea it’s not anything all that special imo. It’s not like that would drastically improve the game.
---
Territorial is the only one of these that I am surprised to see here. All the others are basically useless, but that one at least has some niche utility.
---
Last year: The nightmare then..
---
Will I also get 100 likes???
---
What is Sam from?
---
There is no redemption for your sin
---
I blame the the fact that the perk seems to be bugged as I have found myself being miles away from the basement and the perk doesn’t activate when a survivor enters in the basement to unhook
---
I think TECHNICALLY it is, but never/virtually never punished for it.
---
Trick r’ Treat
---
The kid’s a demon disguised as a small child trick or treating
---
You must have never faced a good Nurse then. Good nurse's don't let you juke
---
I have had killers do this only to bait survivors in and kill them. My point was more it is easy for killers to decieve even if they do the usual signs for farming. Why I generally just play the game out and if the killer is farming clearly deep into the game then I will go over.
---
Legion's power is just the Sloppy Butcher mini-meta personified. Pressure through injuring everyone, keeping them off of the gens to heal. But they did it wrong in the end by making mending so easy when he uses his power to maximum efficiency. Hit all four Survivors is what was intended, but going after one person make his power weak. Hitting the same person multiple times will stun Legion, and only reduce the DW timer by a fraction. Which is why moonwalking became a thing. Hit someone, break chase, then just follow them around until they went down.
---
Frankly, I just play Legion like a basic Killer who walks slower. The 15% speed update will make chases a little better. Overall, Legion's power is still weak. I will probably just use it to find people and not necessarily to down people.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
People attacked him on sight, he was defending himself. And I don't remember him ever actually killing someone until Victor refused to solve his problem, in which he only killed Victor's family members.
---
He didn't blame other people, he blamed Victor for abandoning him and leaving him to the wolves in a world he didn't understand.
---
And lastly, Adam didn't want to get laid, he wanted someone to talk to and hold dear. *Victor* was the one who realized that if they did the nasty it could lead to Uber men, and that there was no guarantee that she would love him back.
---
I think a 50% boost would be fair.
---
Are you the same person that was asking that Claudette have a perk slot removed due to having “Claudette Camo” or is Claudette really this frustrating for some killers?
---
Clown for bambizzle
---
Nice
---
Thanks for confirming. The jump was way to big to be natural.
---
Man this is great. Picked up dbd when it was free and I’ve learned so much more then I ever thought this game would need. Still love/hate it though
---
Imagine an underwater map...
---
Sam from Trick r’ Treat
---
Now, you can let those two add-ons gather dust.
---
Go on the DBD forums, and report him through there

For me I'm getting better survivors than normal

You haven't seen /u/NRocky 's stuff? They make the best themed icons. Some of these look vaguely like theirs, actually.

~~Miss Piggy~~ The Pig is my main and most go to killer. First character I got to P3 50 too. I just really like her aesthetics and ability. Sure, her lunge mindgames are less effective against better players and her RBTs are quite RNG, but she's just so fun to play. Still grinding to get the last few perks I want, but while leveling her I fell in love with Surveillance. It's a nice perk, but just don't forget to kick a gen :P
---
Besides The Pig that I also play Huntress, The Spirit, and Myers.
---
Exactly! Playing nurse on console vs PC is two different worlds. I wonder how many people are on PS4 vs PC player wise
---
yeah that was a shitty comeback from op lol
---
Awe this is so good
---
Yeah PS4 too, been happening all evening
---
Do you get double blood points for dailies during a blood hunt?
---
That's pretty small reason lol, noed's impact is at least 10 times greater than adrenaline's impact. It makes the game infinitely easier while it's active whereas adrenaline is only sometimes useful and when it is it's usually only useful to 1/4 of survivors.
---
i don’t play the game enough to wanna spend upwards of 15 minutes doing boring non exciting shit so yeah
---
There is a distance limit on how far away you can be for it to activate, that is built into the perk.
---
Oh, you know what? That's the guy I thought made these perks. I'm confusing the two lol
---
Yeah I get it, but what really pisses me off is that the guy complaining is Japanese or something, like, you're literally in the other fucking side of the world, why did you expect to have a good ping anyways?
---
I just make my team guess a number and if they don’t get it it’s Lerys time
---
Leatherface has been around longer than Hannibal, so why is he getting lessons 🤔
---
Farming with 5 BPS is boring to me.
---
Okay what does p3 stand for I’m new to the game and the subreddit
---
Sadly no, pretty much from level 45+, all webs have 6 Rare nodes.  No matter which side you play it's going to be pretty congested at the Green Rarity. Prestige has been proven to have an almost zero effect on this.  That being said, You probably want to focus on Killer if you're digging for BPS. Take a look at the item pool to see why:
---
######Killers
---
* 5 Power add-ons (Doctor only has 3)
---
* Green Mori
---
* Green Hook offering 
---
######Survivors
---
* 6 Rare Item Types
---
* 9 Add-ons for Survivor items
---
* 2 Luck Offerings
---
* 1 Extra BP Offering (Bound Envelope)
---
######Both
---
* 4 Category 100% Bonus offerings
---
* 12 Map Offerings
---
* And finally, Bloody Party Streamers
---
Killers have a possible item pool of 24 items (22 for the Doctor). So each web has 6 "rolls" and duplicates can occur obviously.
---
Survivors meanwhile still have 6 "rolls", but their item pool is 35 items.
---
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING
---
I think the main problem is your character's hitbox is actually behind them, so you get billy's doing impossible chainsaws through vaults and stupid shit like that. Even with dedicated servers, it doesn't fix the shitty hitboxes.
---
I've been playing the game since it came out. I remember back when nurse had 3 blinks, and couldn't blink on second floors. Trust me, I've gone against good nurse, I'm telling you, you just need to adjust your playstyle and not let the nurse predict you. And don't use one trick over and over again. A good nurse won't let you juke them, but a good survivor won't let a nurse hit them. Just learn to abuse the nurse weaknesses and avoid playing to her strengths.
---

---
Yup, just lost a BPS. This is crap.
---
People behaving like shit is the exact reason we shouldn't get double BP events at all.
---
Maybe, but the amount of farmers last night and today make the game so damn boring, I don't get it, you can earn more BP playing normally, yet not everyone gets as much but the game is meant to be competitive
---
It's still the 3rd most popular perk at most ranks, as well as the most annoying/powerful killer perk by far, it's obviously going to be the one most complained about.
---
Also I imagine it'd be very rare to see noed at lower ranks as it's basically impossible to be below rank 12 while running it imo.
---
you seem very defensive and get triggered pretty easily, like i said, you're overexaggerating lul, you're a typical DBD Reddit user who cries about SWF on the daily I'm guessing 
---
who hurt you?
---
How is this related to the random disconnects ?
---
yeah, I know it's an event, but not everyone wants to farm, and you bet I will live and leave as soon as the doors are powered cuz farming is boring af
---
Also give survivors a quitters bonus if other survivors DC

Woops, sorry. Thought you meant random survivors dcing.
---
Loving this trend
---
I’ve put so many hours into this game, and i still get a shock when I scan my screen and see this big boi staring me down from a distance!
---
People wanted it long before david. I remember the first comments on that cosmetic being something to the effect of "Where's mikey's?
---
I think a lot of people have thought of that Mori for trapper
---
That happens 24/7   365 . XD
---
The frame rate issue is a console problem that also happens on PS4. The only things, beside a bug, that I know that may prevent your down is borrowed time or mettle of man.
---
Sounds like you're the one who's very defensive and gets triggered pretty easily, considering you had to go through my post history to get an argument and attempt to rile me up, not to mention calling me "a typical DBD Reddit user who cries about SWF and everything else regarding DBD on the daily" and saying shit like "who hurt you?". What a pathetic attempt.
---
and that’s your prerogative. This person stayed the whole time and they all escaped hatch with a key. They didn’t need to.
---
“We don’t do that here”
---
Controversial opinion: Territorial Imperative is really decent on Spirit
---
Same here. It's pretty annoying
---
I feel like killers give everyone a chance to get BP, but survivors...smh.
---
as nostalgic as red perks.
---
I also picked it up when it was free on psn. The game can be extremely frustrating and toxic at times. Learn the mechanics and meta of the game. Be patient. Try to have fun. Refrain from leaving hate mail. There will always be the next trial to look forward to.
---
Congrats, at least you weren't cheap and took screenshots from a streamer without permission, wish more people put as much effort as you do
---
Huntress: “You underestimate my power!”
---
I usually hate this meme, but I love this.  
---
Not just because it's true.  
---
But because "ash" sounds like "ass" which is also true.
---
The code I live by my man, don’t dc, don’t be toxic, at the end of the day- just play the next trial
---
I played a perkless freddy before I had splinter to try him out and everyone dc'd before I could do anything.
---
the way i see it, i'm a hostage in a game of farming, where I am the only one doing gens while the others are chasing and getting hooked, that's torture, not enough to shout, but imagine having 5 games like that in a row

Similar to a pallet save. Start the blind as the killer gets the survivor on their shoulder, maybe a split second before the survivor "settles" on the shoulder. Aim for the neck/chin area.
---
ok
---
Ahhh, finally some AHS again
---
"look at what you've done
---
now we're going to get a chain of """"noun bad" bad" bad" bad" and so on." bad.
---
I had this earlier today too (PS4)
---
And to this, I give 100 OOF's
---
1. 200% Fuck you for DC'ing because you medium vaulted.
---
2. Looks to me like the wall is not long enough to give you enough momentum for a fast vault. You probably could have, but it looks like you hit space too early.
---
I have the perfect idea how to play Huntress.
---
1034 hours and I mained her the moment I started playing her.
---
And plus, you try being funny at fucking midnight.
---
Plus, who died and made you the fuckin' king of comedy? You do something better then. Go on. I'll wait.
---
Just saw the 200k+ BP posts. I thought I was living the high life..
---
I have a soft spot for Jeffs
---
SPIRIT
---
As much as I like Legion these are, imo, broken. One button removes a perk. Vault speed is fine and doesn't need increase. Leave the tapes alone.
---
Prestige 3. Whenever you prestige a character you get a cosmetic of their basic gear covered in blood. It’s arguably the darkest outfit on Claudette.
---
Thanks man
---
Exactly why I hate double BP events. Seems like the most toxic people come out for it. I never use streamers during the event simply bc I know I won't get any use out if them if the killer sees me first.
---
Cmon man, we all know you can do better bait than this
---
I actually lol'ed irl from this
---
Then die!
---
In game I mean
---
why
---
most of my friends are saving BPS only if the killer is messaging them that s/he wants to farm
---
I saw a Michael high up in the window and I ran. He saw me. 😥
---
Opposite has been true for me this time around.
---
Guide on how to get killers to be friendly:
---
Have a teammate and yourself to go a little fire barrel and crouch around it while looking up to have your character’s chin touch it.  This has worked for me and a friend multiple times, often they are friendly, or walk away.
---
There's no way they're not announcing Ghostface right? There's so much hinting towards it almost feels like they're trying to fool us.
---
You can call it all you want I've never rage quit a dead by daylight game. Im sure I've rage quit a halo game way back when but I cant necessarily remember it. I'd call that a weak moment regardless. I've certainly raged make no mistake but not quit and ruin the game for everyone else and certainly not for something that happens all the time in this game. At that point just dont play.
---
Not completely true...  water has served both as a means to imprison Jason and kill him in his own movies.  When he's in New York and they drown him in the sewer stands out.
---
This is so wholesome
---
Quality meme.
---
No... where did you get this from lmao?
---
well, youre not wrong in saying i need help, but that doesnt make your idea any better
---
I like the idea of having survivors slowly falling asleep the whole game--that was the best part of the Freddy movies was the fact that you HAD to go to sleep sometime.
---
Maybe you can stave it off with a skill check which start coming faster and get harder as well.
---
Another possibility would be a survivor not know if they are awake or asleep--that was the other cool part of the movies. But like your fellow survivors could tell you are asleep and wake you up.
---
I've gotten exactly 0 BPS leveling up the last 3 survivors, sadly. :'(
---
I’ve honestly really been enjoying Legion.
---
The better question would be how did you get on the hook instead of all these awful players?
---
Would be a cool mod if the game allowed Steam workshop
